The matter has been written or chosen with a view to\r\ninterest and instruct, to cultivate a taste for the best literature, to\r\nbuild up a strong moral character and to imbue our children with an\r\nintelligent love of Faith and Country. The methods are those approved by\r\nthe most experienced and progressive teachers of reading in Europe and\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThese Readers have also been specially designed to elicit thought and\r\nfacilitate literary composition. In furtherance of this idea, class\r\ntalks, word study, the structure of sentences, drills on certain correct\r\nforms of expression, the proper arrangement of ideas, explanation of\r\nphrases and literary expressions, oral and written reproductions of\r\nnarrations and descriptions, and exercises in original composition, all\r\nreceive the attention which their importance demands. Thus will the\r\npupils, while learning to read and from their earliest years, acquire\r\nthat readiness in grasping the thoughts of others and that fluency in\r\nexpressing their own, which are so essential to a good English\r\neducation.\r\n\r\nIn teaching the art of Reading as well as that of Composition, the\r\nprinciple of order should in a great measure determine the value of the\r\nmethods to be employed. In the acquisition of knowledge, the child\r\ninstinctively follows the order of nature. This order is first,\r\n_observation_; second, _thought_; third, _expression_. It becomes the\r\nduty of the teacher, consequently, to lead the child to observe\r\n_accurately_, to think _clearly_, and to express his thoughts\r\n_correctly_. And text-books are useful only in so far as they supply the\r\nteacher with the material and the system best calculated to accomplish\r\nsuch results.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore hoped that the present new series of Readers, having\r\nbeen planned in accordance with the principle just enunciated, will\r\nprove a valuable adjunct in our Catholic schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_3_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this Fifth Reader of the De La Salle Series the plan of the preceding\r\nnumbers has been continued. The pupil has now mastered the mechanical\r\ndifficulties of learning to read, and has acquired a fairly good working\r\nvocabulary. Hence he is prepared to read intelligently and with some\r\ndegree of fluency and pleasure. Now is the time to lead him to acquire a\r\ntaste for good reading. The selections have been drawn mainly from\r\nauthors whose writings are distinguished for their moral and literary\r\nvalue, and whose style is sure to excite a lasting interest.\r\n\r\nIn addition to giving the pupil practice in reading and forming a basis\r\nfor oral and written composition work, these selections will raise his\r\nideas of right living, will quicken his imagination, will give him his\r\nfirst knowledge of many things, stimulate his powers of observation,\r\nenlarge his vocabulary, and correct and refine his mode of expression. A\r\nwholesome reading habit, so important to-day, will thus be easily,\r\npleasantly and unconsciously formed.\r\n\r\nThe following are some of the features of the book:\r\n\r\nGUIDE TO PRONUNCIATION.--This Guide is to be referred to again and\r\nagain, and the diacritical marks carefully taught. Instruction in the\r\nvowel sounds is an excellent drill in articulation, while a knowledge of\r\nthe diacritical marks enables the pupil to master these sounds for\r\nhimself when consulting the dictionary.\r\n\r\nVARIETY OF MATTER.--In the volume will be found the best sentiments of\r\nthe best writers. The pupil will find fables, nature studies, tales of\r\ntravel and adventure, brave deeds from history and fiction, stories of\r\nloyalty and heroism, examples of sublime Christian self-sacrifice, and\r\nselections that teach industry, contentment, respect for authority,\r\nreverence for all things sacred, attachment to home, and fidelity to\r\nfaith and Country.\r\n\r\nLANGUAGE STUDY.--If reading is to hold its proper place in the class\r\nroom, the teaching of it must not be confined to the mere reading of the\r\ntext. In its truest sense, reading is far more comprehensive. The\r\nteacher will question the pupil on what he has read, point out to him\r\nthe beauties of thought and language, find out what hold the reading has\r\ntaken upon his memory, how it has aroused his imagination, assisted his\r\njudgment, directed his will, and contributed to his fund of general\r\ninformation. To assist in this most important work is the object aimed\r\nat in the matter given for Language Study. Such study will also give\r\nfuller powers of interpretation and corresponding appreciation of the\r\nselection considered simply as literature.\r\n\r\nRECITATIONS.--There are some selections marked for recitation. The\r\npublic recitation of these extracts will banish awkwardness of manner,\r\nbeget self-confidence, and lay the foundation for subsequent\r\nelocutionary work. Besides, experience teaches that a single poem or\r\naddress based upon some heroic or historic event, recited before a class\r\nor a school, will often do more to build up a noble character and foster\r\na love of history, than a full term of instruction by question and\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\nPOETRY.--The numerous poetic selections, some of which are partly\r\nanalyzed by way of suggestion, will create a love for the highest and\r\npurest forms of literature, will broaden the field of knowledge, and\r\nemphasize the teachings of some of the prose selections. Many of them\r\nhave been written by American authors. Every American boy and girl\r\nshould be acquainted with the works of poets who have done so much for\r\nthe development of American literature and nationality.\r\n\r\nMEMORY GEMS.--"The memorizing of choice bits of prose and poetry\r\nenriches the vocabulary of the pupils, adorns their memory, suggests\r\ndelicate and noble thoughts, and puts them in possession of sentences of\r\nthe best construction. The recitation of these expressive texts\r\naccustoms the children to speak with ease, grace and elegance."\r\n("Elements of Practical Pedagogy.")\r\n\r\nBIOGRAPHIES.--Young children enjoy literature for its own sake, and take\r\nlittle interest in the personality of the writer; but as they grow\r\nolder, pleasure in the work of an author arouses an interest in the\r\nwriter himself. Brief biographical sketches are given at the close of\r\nthe volume as helps in the study of the authors from whom selections are\r\ndrawn, and to induce the pupils to read further.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_4_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nWORD STUDY.--The pupil should know how to spell and pronounce correctly\r\nall the words of the selection he is preparing to read. He should know\r\ntheir ordinary meanings and the special meanings they may have in the\r\ntext. He should be able to write them correctly from dictation and to\r\nuse them in sentences of his own. He should examine if they are\r\nprimitive, derivative, or compound; he should be able to name the\r\nprefixes and suffixes and show how the meanings of the original words\r\nare modified by their use. He should cultivate the habit of word\r\nmastery. What is read will not otherwise be understood. Without it there\r\ncan be no good reading, speaking or writing.\r\n\r\nEXPRESSIVE READING.--There should be constant drill to secure correct\r\npronunciation, distinct articulation, proper emphasis, and an agreeable\r\ntone of voice, without which there can be no expressive reading. This is\r\na difficult task, and will take much time, trouble and practice; but it\r\nhas far-reaching results. It enlarges the sympathy of the pupil and lays\r\nthe foundation for a genuine love of literature. Do not, then, let the\r\nreading lesson drift into a dull and monotonous calling of words. On the\r\ncontrary, let it be intelligent, spirited, enthusiastic. Emotion comes\r\nlargely from the imagination. The pupil himself must be taught not only\r\nto feel what he reads, but to make its meaning clear to others. It is\r\nimportant that children be taught to acquire thought through the ear.\r\n\r\nCONCERT READING.--Reading in concert is generally of little value, and\r\nthe time given to it ill-spent. It does not aid the children in getting\r\nthought, or in expressing it fluently. As an exercise in teaching\r\nreading it is ineffective and often positively harmful. A concert\r\nrecitation to which special training has been given partakes of the\r\nnature of a hymn or a song, and then becomes an element of value. If\r\noccasionally there must be concert reading in the class room, it should\r\nalways be preceded by individual mastery of the selection.\r\n\r\nPOEMS.--In the first lesson, a poem, like a picture, should be presented\r\nas a whole, and never dissected. The teacher should first read it\r\nthrough, not stopping for note or comment. He should then read it again,\r\npart by part, stopping, for question, explanation and discussion.\r\nLastly, the whole poem, should be read with suitable emotion, so that\r\nthe final impression may be made by the author\'s own words. It is\r\nimportant that the pupil get the message which the author intended to\r\ngive. In teaching a descriptive poem, make the pictures as vivid as\r\npossible, and thus awaken the imagination. In dealing with a narrative\r\npoem, the sequence of events must first be made clear. When this is\r\ndone, the aim should be to give fuller meaning to the story by bringing\r\nout clearly the causes, motives and results of acts. All this will take\r\ntime. Be it so. One poem well read, well studied, is worth more than a\r\nvolume carelessly read over. In reading poetry, be careful that the\r\npupils, while giving the rhythm of the lines, do not fall into the\r\nsingsong tone so common and so disagreeable.\r\n\r\nEXPLANATIONS.--Explanations should accompany every reading lesson,\r\nwithout which there can be no serious teaching of the vernacular. By\r\ntheir means the teacher enters into communication with his pupils; he\r\ngets them to speak, he corrects their errors, trains their reason, and\r\nforms their taste. It has been said that a teacher able to explain\r\nselections in prose and poetry "holds his class in the hollow of his\r\nhand." The teacher should insist that the pupil express himself clearly\r\nand correctly, not only during the reading lesson, but on every subject\r\nhe has occasion to deal with, either orally or in writing, throughout\r\nthe day\'s recitations.\r\n\r\nREVIEWS.--As the memory of children, though prompt, is weak, frequent\r\nreviews should be held. They are necessary for the backward pupils and\r\nadvantageous for the others. Have an informal talk with the children on\r\nwhat they have read, what they have learned, what they have liked, and\r\nwhat has interested them. Some important parts of the prose and poetry\r\npreviously studied might, during this exercise, be re-read with profit.\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITION.--Continue oral and written composition. The correct use of\r\nwritten language is best taught by selecting for compositions\r\nsubject-matter that deeply interests the children. If persevered in,\r\nthis will secure a good, strong, idiomatic use of English. If the words\r\nof a selection that has been studied appear now and then in the\r\nchildren\'s conversation or writing, it should be a matter for praise;\r\nfor this means that new words have been added to their vocabulary, and\r\nthat the children have a new conception of beauty of thought and speech.\r\n\r\nSee that all written work be done neatly and legibly. Slovenly or\r\ncareless habits should never be allowed in any written work.\r\n\r\nMEMORY GEMS.--Do not lose sight of the memory gems. Familiarize the\r\npupil with them. Their value to the child lies more in future good\r\nresulting from them than in present good. These treasures of thought\r\nwill live in the memory and influence the daily lives of the children\r\nwho learn them by heart.\r\n\r\nTHE DICTIONARY.--The use of the dictionary is a necessary part of\r\neducation. It is a powerful aid in self-education. Its use will double\r\nthe value of study in connection with reading and language. Every\r\nGrammar School, High School and College should be supplied with several\r\ncopies of a good unabridged dictionary, and every pupil taught how to\r\nconsult it, and encouraged to do so. The dictionary should be the book\r\nof first and last and constant resort.\r\n\r\nUSE OF THE LIBRARY.--The teacher should endeavor to create an interest\r\nin those books from which the selections in the Reader are taken, and in\r\nothers of equal grade and quality. Encourage the children to take books\r\nfrom the library. Direct them in their choice. Encourage home reading.\r\nThe reading of good books should be a part of regular school work;\r\notherwise little or no true progress can be made in speaking and\r\nwriting. The best way to learn to speak and write good English is to\r\nread good English.\r\n\r\nFor additional suggestions as to the best means of teaching Reading and\r\nLanguage, teachers are referred to Chapters II and IV, Part IV, of\r\n"Elements of Practical Pedagogy," by the Christian Brothers, and\r\npublished by the La Salle Bureau of Supplies, 50 Second Street, New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nAcknowledgments are gratefully made to the following authors,\r\npublishers, and owners of copyright, who have courteously granted\r\npermission to use the selections which bear their names:\r\n\r\n"Mercedes," Miss Eleanor C.

All around the tiny plant were many others, but none of them so\r\ngraceful and delicate as this one I tell you of. Every day the cheery\r\nbreezes sought out their playmate, and the merry sunbeams darted in and\r\nout, playing hide-and-seek among reeds and rushes; and when the twilight\r\nshadows deepened, and the sunbeams had all gone away, the little fern\r\ncurled itself up for the night with only the dewdrops for company.\r\n\r\nSo day after day went by: and no one knew of, or found the sweet wild\r\nfern, or the beautiful valley it grew in. But--for this was a very long\r\ntime ago--a great change took place in the earth; and rocks and soil\r\nwere upturned, and the rivers found new channels to flow in.\r\n\r\nNow, when all this happened, the little fern was quite covered up with\r\nthe soft moist clay, and perhaps you think it might as well never have\r\nlived as to have been hidden away where none could see it.\r\n\r\nBut after all, it was not really lost; for hundreds of years afterwards,\r\nwhen all that clay had become stone, and had broken into many fragments,\r\na very wise and learned man found the bit of rock upon which was all the\r\ndelicate tracery of the little fern leaf, with outline just as perfect\r\nand lovely as when, long, long ago it had swayed to the breezes in its\r\nown beautiful valley.\r\n\r\nAnd so wonderful did it seem to the wise man, that he took the fern leaf\r\nhome with him and placed it in his cabinet where all could admire it;\r\nand where, if they were thoughtful and clever enough, they could think\r\nout the story for themselves and find the lesson which was hidden away\r\nwith the fern in the bit of rock.\r\n\r\nLesson! did I say? Well, let\'s not call it a lesson, but only a truth\r\nwhich it will do every one of us good to remember; and that is, that\r\nnone of the beauty in this fair world around us, nor anything that is\r\nsweet and lovely in our own hearts, and lives, will ever be useless and\r\nlost. For, as the little fern leaf lay hidden away for years and years,\r\nand yet finally was found by the wise man and given a place with his\r\nother rare and precious possessions where it could still, though\r\nsilently, aid those who looked upon it; so we, as boys and girls, men\r\nand women who are to be, can now, day by day, cultivate all lovely\r\ntraits of character, making ourselves ready to take our place in the\r\nworld\'s work. And when that time comes we shall not only be able to aid\r\nothers silently, as did the little fern, but may also, by word and deed,\r\nlend a hand to each and every one around us.\r\n\r\n_Mara L.

"Does this land on which\r\nyou are working so hard belong to you?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir," replied the laborer, who knew not that it was the king; "I am\r\nnot so rich as that; I plow for wages."\r\n\r\n"How much do you get a day?" asked the king.\r\n\r\n"Two dollars," said the laborer.\r\n\r\n"That is not much," replied the king; "can you get along with that?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; and have something left."\r\n\r\n"How is that?"\r\n\r\nThe laborer smiled, and said, "Well, if I must tell you, fifty cents are\r\nfor myself and wife; with fifty I pay my old debts, fifty I lend, and\r\nfifty I give away for the Lord\'s sake."\r\n\r\n"That is a mystery which I cannot solve," replied the king.\r\n\r\n"Then I will solve it for you," said the laborer. "I have two old\r\nparents at home, who kept me when I was weak and needed help; and now,\r\nthat they are weak and need help, I keep them. This is my debt, towards\r\nwhich I pay fifty cents a day. The third fifty cents, which I lend, I\r\nspend for my children, that they may receive Christian instruction. This\r\nwill come handy to me and my wife when we get old. With the last fifty I\r\nmaintain two sick sisters. This I give for the Lord\'s sake."\r\n\r\nThe king, well pleased with his answer, said, "Bravely spoken, old man.\r\nNow I will also give you something to guess.

First, the toil worn craftsman, that with\r\nearth-made implement laboriously conquers the earth, and makes her\r\nman\'s. Venerable to me is the hard hand, crooked, coarse, wherein,\r\nnotwithstanding, lies a cunning virtue, indefeasibly royal, as of the\r\nscepter of this planet. Venerable, too, is the rugged face, all weather\r\ntanned, besoiled, with its rude intelligence; for it is the face of a\r\nman living manlike.\r\n\r\nOh, but the more venerable for thy rudeness, and even because I must\r\npity as well as love thee! Hardly entreated brother! For us was thy back\r\nso bent, for us were thy straight limbs and fingers so deformed. Thou\r\nwert our conscript on whom the lot fell and, fighting our battles, wert\r\nso marred. Yet toil on, toil on; ... thou toilest for the altogether\r\nindispensable,--for daily bread.\r\n\r\nA second man I honor, and still more highly; him who is seen toiling for\r\nthe spiritually indispensable; not daily bread, but the bread of life.\r\nIs not he, too, in his duty; endeavoring towards inward harmony;\r\nrevealing this, by act or word, through all his outward endeavors, be\r\nthey high or low? Highest of all, when his outward and his inward\r\nendeavor are one; when we can name him artist; not earthly craftsman\r\nonly, but inspired thinker, that with heaven-made implement conquers\r\nheaven for us!\r\n\r\nIf the poor and humble toil that we may have food, must not the high and\r\nglorious toil for him, in return, that he may have light and guidance,\r\nfreedom, immortality?--these two, in all their degrees, I honor; all\r\nelse is chaff and dust, which let the wind blow whither it listeth.\r\n\r\nUnspeakably touching it is, however, when I find both dignities united;\r\nand he, that must toil outwardly for the lowest of man\'s wants, is also\r\ntoiling inwardly for the highest. Sublimer in this world know I nothing\r\nthan a peasant saint. Such a one will take thee back to Nazareth itself;\r\nthou wilt see the splendor of heaven spring forth from the humblest\r\ndepths of earth like a light shining in great darkness.\r\n\r\n_Thomas Carlyle._\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLaws are like cobwebs, where the small flies are caught, and the great\r\nbreak through.\r\n\r\n_Bacon_.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_13_\r\n\r\n\r\ngust\r\nthief\r\nmop\' ing\r\nawk\' ward\r\npet\' tish ly\r\nin dig\' nant\r\nun bear\' a ble\r\nmed\' dle some\r\nen light\' ened\r\nin quis\' i tive\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRUMBLING PUSS.\r\n\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?" said Growler to the gray cat, as she sat moping on\r\nthe top of the garden wall.\r\n\r\n"Matter enough," said the cat, turning her head another way, "Our cook\r\nis very fond of talking of hanging me. I wish heartily some one would\r\nhang _her_."\r\n\r\n"Why, what _is_ the matter?" repeated Growler.\r\n\r\n"Hasn\'t she beaten me, and called me a thief, and threatened to be the\r\ndeath of me?"\r\n\r\n"Dear, dear!" said Growler; "pray what has brought it about?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, nothing at all; it is her temper. All the servants complain of it.\r\nI wonder they haven\'t hanged her long ago."\r\n\r\n"Well, you see," said Growler, "cooks are awkward things to hang; you\r\nand I might be managed much more easily."\r\n\r\n"Not a drop of milk have I had this day!" said the gray cat; "and such a\r\npain in my side!"\r\n\r\n"But what," said Growler, "what is the cause?"\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t I told you?" said the gray cat, pettishly; "it\'s her\r\ntemper:--oh, what I have had to suffer from it! Everything she breaks\r\nshe lays to me; everything that is stolen she lays to me. Really, it is\r\nquite unbearable!"\r\n\r\nGrowler was quite indignant; but, being of a reflective turn, after the\r\nfirst gust of wrath had passed, he asked: "But was there no particular\r\ncause this morning?"\r\n\r\n"She chose to be very angry because I--I offended her," said the cat.\r\n\r\n"How, may I ask?" gently inquired Growler.\r\n\r\n"Oh, nothing worth telling,--a mere mistake of mine."\r\n\r\nGrowler looked at her with such a questioning expression, that she was\r\ncompelled to say, "I took the wrong thing for my breakfast."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said Growler, much enlightened.\r\n\r\n"Why, the fact is," said the gray cat, "I was springing at a mouse, and\r\nknocked down a dish, and, not knowing exactly what it was, I smelt it,\r\nand it was rather nice, and--"\r\n\r\n"You finished it," hinted Growler.\r\n\r\n"Well, I believe I should have done so, if that meddlesome cook hadn\'t\r\ncome in. As it was, I left the head."\r\n\r\n"The head of what?" said Growler.\r\n\r\n"How inquisitive you are!" said the gray cat.\r\n\r\n"Nay, but I should like to know," said Growler.\r\n\r\n"Well, then, of a certain fine fish that was meant for dinner."\r\n\r\n"Then," said Growler, "say what you please; but, now that I\'ve heard the\r\nwhole story, I only wonder she did _not_ hang you."\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nFill the following blanks with words that will make complete sentences:\r\n\r\nMary -- here, and Susan and Agnes -- coming.

Then he flew away\r\nimmediately, because he had much to look after.\r\n\r\nThat was in the dark evening, and the seed could not see where it was\r\nplaced, and besides, the leaf covered it.\r\n\r\nSomething heavy came now, and pressed so hard that the seed came near\r\nbeing destroyed; but the leaf, weak though it was, protected it.\r\n\r\nIt was a human foot which walked along over the ground, and pressed the\r\ndowny seed into the earth. When the foot was withdrawn, the earth fell,\r\nand filled the little pit it had made.\r\n\r\nThe cold came, and the snow fell several feet deep; but the seed lay\r\nquietly down there, waiting for warmth and light. When the spring came,\r\nand the snow melted away, the plant shot up out of the earth.\r\n\r\nThere was a little gray cottage beside which it grew up. The tiny plant\r\ncould not see very far around, because rubbish and brush-heaps lay near\r\nit, and the little window was so gray and dusty that it could not peep\r\ninto the cottage either.\r\n\r\n"Who lives here?" asked the little thing.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you know that?" asked the ragged shoe, which lay near. "Why, the\r\nsmith who drinks so much lives here, and his wife who wore me out."\r\n\r\nAnd then she told how it looked inside, how life went on there, and it\r\nwas not cheering; no, but fearfully sad. The shoe knew it all well, and\r\ntold a whole lot in a few minutes, because she had such a well-hung\r\ntongue.\r\n\r\nNow there came a pair of ragged children, running--the smith\'s boy and\r\ngirl; he was six years old and the girl eight, so the shoe said, after\r\nthey were gone.\r\n\r\n"Oh, see, what a pretty little plant!" said the girl. "So now, I shall\r\npull it up," said the boy, and the plant trembled to the root\'s heart.\r\n\r\n"No, do not do it!" said the girl. "We must let it grow. Do you not see\r\nwhat pretty crinkly leaves it has? It will have lovely flowers, I know,\r\nwhen it grows bigger."\r\n\r\nAnd it was allowed to stay there. The children took a stick and dug up\r\nthe earth round about, so it looked like a plowed field. Then they threw\r\nthe shoe and the sweepings a little way off, because they thought to\r\nmake the place look better.\r\n\r\n"You cannot think," said the shoe, after the children had gone, "you\r\ncannot think how in the way folks are!"\r\n\r\n"The children have to give themselves airs, and pretend to be very\r\norderly," said the half of a coffee-cup; and she broke in another place\r\nshe was so disturbed.\r\n\r\nBut the sun shone warmly and the rain filtered down in the upturned\r\nearth. Then leaf after leaf unfolded, and in a few days the plant was\r\nseveral inches high.\r\n\r\n"Oh, see!" said the children, who came again; "see how beautiful it is\r\ngetting!"\r\n\r\n"Come, father, come! brother and I have discovered such a pretty plant!\r\nCome and see it!" begged the girl.\r\n\r\nThe father glanced at it. The plant looked so lovely on the little rough\r\nbit of soil which lay between the piles of sweepings.\r\n\r\nThe smith nodded to the children.\r\n\r\n"It looks very disorderly here," he said to himself, and stopped an\r\ninstant. "Yes, indeed, it does!" He went along, but thought of the\r\nlittle green spot, with the lovely plant in the midst of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\npet\' als\r\nin\' mates\r\nscrubbed\r\nfra\' grant\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe children ran into the house.\r\n\r\n"Mother," said they, "there is such a rare plant growing right by the\r\nwindow!"\r\n\r\nThe mother wished to glance out, but the window was so thick with dust\r\nthat she could not do so. She wiped off a little spot.\r\n\r\n"My! My!" said she, when she noticed how dirty the window looked beside\r\nthe cleaned spot; so she wiped the whole window.\r\n\r\n"That is an odd plant," said she, looking at it. "But how dreadfully\r\ndirty it is out in the yard!"\r\n\r\nNow that the sun shone in through the window it became very light in the\r\ncottage. The mother looked at the ragged children and at the rubbish in\r\nthe room, and the blood rushed over her pale cheeks.\r\n\r\n"It is a perfect shame!" she murmured. "I have never noticed that it was\r\nso untidy here."\r\n\r\nShe hurried around, and set the room to rights, and, when that was done,\r\nshe washed the dirty floor. She scrubbed it so hard that her hands\r\nsmarted as if she had burned them in the fire; she did not stop until\r\nevery spot was white.\r\n\r\nIt was evening; the husband came home from work. The wife sat mending\r\nthe girl\'s ragged dress. The man stopped in the door. It looked so\r\nstrange to him within, and the look his wife gave him was brighter than\r\never before, he thought.\r\n\r\n"Go--God\'s peace!" he stammered. It was a long time since such a\r\ngreeting had been heard in here.\r\n\r\n"God\'s peace!" answered she; "wel--welcome home!" She had not said this\r\nfor many years.\r\n\r\nThe smith stepped forward to the window; on the bed beside it the two\r\nchildren lay sleeping. He looked at them, then he looked out on the\r\nmound where the little plant stood. After a few minutes he went out.\r\n\r\nA deep sigh rose from the woman\'s breast. She had hoped that he would\r\nstay home that evening. Two great tears fell on the little dress.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes she heard a noise outside. She went to the window to\r\nsee what it could be. Her husband had not gone away! He was out in the\r\nyard clearing up the brush-heaps and rubbish.\r\n\r\nShe became more happy than she had been for a long time. He glanced in\r\nthrough the window and saw her. Then she nodded, he nodded back, and\r\nthey both smiled.\r\n\r\n"Be careful, above all, of the little plant!" said she.\r\n\r\nWarm and sunny days came. The smith stayed at home now every evening. It\r\nwas green and lovely round the little cottage, and outside the window\r\nthere was a whole flower-bed, with many blossoms; but in the midst stood\r\nthe little plant the autumn wind had brought thither.\r\n\r\nThe smith\'s family stood around the flower-bed, and talked about the\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\n"But the plant that brother and I found is the most beautiful of all,"\r\nsaid the girl.\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed it is," said the parents.\r\n\r\nThe smith bent down and took one of the leaves in his hand, but very\r\ncarefully, because he was afraid he might hurt it with his thick, coarse\r\nfingers.\r\n\r\nThen a bell was heard ringing in the distance. The sound floated out\r\nover field and lake, and rang so peacefully in the eventide, just as the\r\nsun sank behind the tree-tops in the forest. And every one bowed the\r\nhead, because it was Saturday evening, and it was a sacred voice that\r\nsounded.\r\n\r\nIn a little while all was silent in the cottage; the inmates slumbered,\r\nmore tired, perhaps, than before, after the week\'s toils, but also much,\r\nmuch happier. And round about, all was calm and peaceful.\r\n\r\nBut when Sunday\'s sun came up, the plant opened its bud,--and it bore\r\nbut a single one. When the cottage folks passed the little\r\nflower-garden, they all stopped and looked at the beautiful, fragrant\r\nblossom.\r\n\r\n"It shall go with us to the house of God," said the wife, turning to her\r\nhusband. He nodded, and then she broke off the flower. The wife looked\r\nat the husband, and he looked at her, and then their eyes rested on both\r\nchildren; then their eyes grew dim, but became immediately bright again,\r\nfor the tears were not of sorrow, but of happiness.\r\n\r\nWhen the organ\'s tones swelled and the people sang in the temple, the\r\nflower folded its petals, for it had fulfilled its mission; but on the\r\nwaves of song its perfume floated upwards.

Yet\r\nhe sat humming to keep up his spirits.\r\n\r\nStill, at times, he thought of his loneliness and hunger, and he could\r\nscarcely keep the tears from his eyes; for he knew that nothing would be\r\nso welcome to his poor invalid mother as a good sweet orange; and yet he\r\nhad not a penny in the world.\r\n\r\nThe little song he was singing was his own,--one he had composed, both\r\nair and words; for the child was a genius. He went to the window, and,\r\nlooking out, saw a man putting up a great poster with yellow letters,\r\nannouncing that Madame Malibran would sing that night in public.\r\n\r\n"Oh, if I could only go!" thought little Pierre; and then, pausing a\r\nmoment, he clasped his hands; his eyes sparkled with a new hope. Running\r\nto the looking-glass, he smoothed his yellow curls, and, taking from a\r\nlittle box an old, stained paper, he gave one eager glance at his\r\nmother, who slept, and ran speedily from the house.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n"Who, do you say, is waiting for me?" said the lady to her servant. "I\r\nam already worn out with company."\r\n\r\n"Only a very pretty little boy, with yellow curls, who says that if he\r\ncan just see you, he is sure you will not be sorry, and he will not keep\r\nyou a moment."\r\n\r\n"Oh, well, let him come!" said the beautiful singer, with a smile; "I\r\ncan never refuse children."\r\n\r\nLittle Pierre came in, his hat under his arm; and in his hand a little\r\nroll of paper. With a manliness unusual in a child, he walked straight\r\nup to the lady, and, bowing, said: "I have come to see you, because my\r\nmother is very sick, and we are too poor to get food and medicine. I\r\nthought that, perhaps, if you would only sing my little song at one of\r\nyour grand concerts, some publisher might buy it, for a small sum; and\r\nso I could get food and medicine for my mother."\r\n\r\nThe beautiful woman rose from her seat; very tall and stately she\r\nwas;--she took the little roll from his hand, and lightly hummed the\r\nair.\r\n\r\n"Did you compose it?" she asked,--"you, a child! And the words?--Would\r\nyou like to come to my concert?" she asked, after a few moments of\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes!" and the boy\'s eyes grew bright with happiness; "but I\r\ncouldn\'t leave my mother."\r\n\r\n"I will send somebody to take care of your mother for the evening; and\r\nhere is a crown, with which you may go and get food and medicine. Here\r\nis also one of my tickets; come to-night; and that will admit you to a\r\nseat near me."\r\n\r\nAlmost beside himself with joy, Pierre bought some oranges, and many a\r\nlittle luxury besides, and carried them home to the poor invalid,\r\ntelling her, not without tears, of his good fortune.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen evening came, and Pierre was admitted to the concert hall, he felt\r\nthat never in his life had he been in so grand a place. The music, the\r\nglare of lights, the beauty, the flashing of diamonds and the rustling\r\nof silks, completely bewildered him. At last _she_ came; and the\r\nchild sat with his eyes riveted on her face. Could it be that the grand\r\nlady, glittering with jewels, and whom everybody seemed to worship,\r\nwould really sing his little song?\r\n\r\nBreathless he waited:--the band, the whole band, struck up a little\r\nplaintive melody: he knew it, and clapped his hands for joy! And oh, how\r\nshe sang it! It was so simple, so mournful, so soul-subduing. Many a\r\nbright eye was dimmed with tears, many a heart was moved, by the\r\ntouching words of that little song.\r\n\r\nPierre walked home as if he were moving on the air. What cared he for\r\nmoney now? The greatest singer in Europe had sung his little song, and\r\nthousands had wept at his grief.\r\n\r\nThe next day he was frightened by a visit from Madame Malibran. She laid\r\nher hand on his yellow curls, and, turning to the sick woman, said:\r\n"Your little boy, madam, has brought you a fortune. I was offered, this\r\nmorning, by the first publisher in London, a large sum for his little\r\nsong. Madam, thank God that your son has a gift from heaven."\r\n\r\nThe noble-hearted singer and the poor woman wept together. As for\r\nPierre, always mindful of Him who watches over the tried and the\r\ntempted, he knelt down by his mother\'s bedside and uttered a simple\r\nprayer, asking God\'s blessing on the kind lady who had deigned to notice\r\ntheir affliction.\r\n\r\nThe memory of that prayer made the singer even more tender-hearted; and\r\nshe now went about doing good. And on her early death, he who stood by\r\nher bed, and smoothed her pillow, and lightened her last moments by his\r\naffection, was the little Pierre of former days,--now rich,\r\naccomplished, and one of the most talented composers of the day.\r\n\r\nAll honor to those great hearts who, from their high stations, send down\r\nbounty to the widow and the fatherless!\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nPIERRE (pe [^a]r\'), Peter.\r\n\r\nMALIBRAN, a French singer and actress.

One\r\nbeautiful morning while the slaves were at work in the cornfield and the\r\nsun was shining with a mighty splendor on the waving grass, first giving\r\nit a light red, then changing it to a golden hue, there were seated upon\r\na bench in front of the Rowan homestead two young people, a brother and\r\na sister.\r\n\r\nHigh up in the top of a tree was a mocking bird warbling its sweet\r\nnotes. Over in a hidden recess of a small brush, the thrush\'s mellow\r\nsong could be heard. A number of small negro children were playing not\r\nfar away. When Foster had finished the first verse of the song his\r\nsister took it from his hand and sang in a sweet, mellow voice:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       The sun shines bright on the old Kentucky home;\r\n         \'Tis summer, the darkies are gay;\r\n       The corn top\'s ripe and the meadows in the bloom,\r\n         While the birds make music all the day.\r\n\r\n       The young folks roll on the little cabin floor,\r\n         All merry, all happy, all bright;\r\n       By\'n by hard times comes a-knockin\' at the door--\r\n         Then, my old Kentucky home, good night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn her finishing the first verse the mocking bird descended to a lower\r\nbranch. The feathery songster drew his head to one side and appeared to\r\nbe completely enraptured at the wonderful voice of the young singer.\r\nWhen the last note died away upon the air, her fond brother sang in deep\r\nbass voice:\r\n\r\n\r\n       Weep no more, my lady; oh, weep no more to-day,\r\n         Well sing one song for the old Kentucky home,\r\n       For our old Kentucky home far away.\r\n\r\n       A few more days for to tote the weary load,\r\n         No matter, \'twill never be light;\r\n       A few more days till we totter on the road--\r\n         Then, my old Kentucky home, good night.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe negroes had laid down their hoes and rakes; the little tots had\r\nplaced themselves behind the large, sheltering trees, while the old\r\nblack women were peeping around the corner of the house. The faithful\r\nold house dog never took his eyes off the young singers. Everything was\r\nstill; not even the stirring of the leaves seemed to break the wonderful\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nAgain the brother and sister took hold of the remaining notes, and sang\r\nin sweet accents:\r\n\r\n\r\n       They hunt no more for the \'possum and the coon\r\n         On the meadow, the hill and the shore;\r\n       They sing no more by the glimmer of the moon,\r\n         On the bench by the old cabin door.\r\n\r\n       The day goes by like a shadow o\'er the heart,\r\n         With sorrow where all was delight:\r\n       The time has come when the darkies have to part--\r\n         Then, my old Kentucky home, good night.\r\n\r\n       The head must bow and the back will have to bend\r\n         Wherever the darkies may go;\r\n       A few more days and the trouble all will end\r\n         In the fields where the sugar cane grow.\r\n\r\n       Then weep no more, my lady; oh, weep no more to-day,\r\n         We\'ll sing one song for the old Kentucky home,\r\n       For our old Kentucky home far away.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the song was finished tears flowed down the old people\'s cheeks; the\r\nchildren crept from their hiding place behind the trees, their faces\r\nwreathed in smiles. The mocking bird and the thrush sought their home in\r\nthe thicket, while the old house dog still lay basking in the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mrs. T.A.

And Jesus also was invited to the marriage." Mary was\r\ninvited to be one of the honored guests because she was, no doubt, an\r\nintimate friend of the family. She preceded her Son to the wedding in\r\norder to lend her aid in the necessary preparations.\r\n\r\nJesus also was asked, and He did not refuse the invitation. He went as\r\nfreely to this house of feasting as He afterwards went pityingly to so\r\nmany houses of mourning. Though worn and weary with his long fast and\r\nstruggle in the desert, He was pleased to attend this merry wedding\r\nfeast, and by this loving and kindly act to sanctify the bond of\r\nMarriage, which was to become in His Church one of the seven Sacraments.\r\n\r\nThe feast went gayly onward until an incident occurred that greatly\r\ndisturbed the host. The wine failed. The host had not calculated\r\nrightly, or perhaps he had not counted on so many guests.\r\n\r\nMary, with her motherly heart, was the first to notice the confusion of\r\nthe servants when they discovered that the wine vessels had become\r\nempty; and leaning towards her Son, whispered, "They have no wine." "My\r\nhour is not yet come," He answered her, meaning that His time for\r\nworking miracles had not yet arrived. He knew on the instant what the\r\ngentle heart of His Mother desired. His words sounded like a refusal of\r\nthe request which Mary made rather with her eyes than with her tongue;\r\nbut the sequel shows that the Blessed Mother fully believed that her\r\nprayer would be granted.\r\n\r\nShe quietly said to the servants, "Whatsoever He shall say to you, do\r\nye." They had not long to wait. There were standing close at hand six\r\ngreat urns of stone, covered with branches, as is the custom in the\r\nEast, in order to keep the water cool and fresh. These vessels\r\n"containing two or three measures apiece," were kept in readiness for\r\nthe guests, who were required not only to wash their feet before\r\ntouching the linen and drapery of the couches, but even during the meal\r\nfrequently to purify their hands. Already there had been many of these\r\nablutions performed, and the urns were being rapidly emptied.\r\n\r\n"Fill the waterpots with water," said Jesus to the servants.\r\n\r\nThey filled them up to the brim with clear, fresh water.\r\n\r\n"Draw out now, and carry to the chief steward of the feast."\r\n\r\nAnd they carried it.\r\n\r\nWhen the chief steward had tasted the water made wine, and knew not\r\nwhence it was, he called the bridegroom and said to him: "Every man at\r\nfirst setteth forth good wine, and when men have well drunk then that\r\nwhich is worse; but thou hast kept the good wine until now."\r\n\r\nThe steward had supposed at first that the host had wished to give an\r\nagreeable surprise to the company assembled at his table; but the\r\nlatter, to his amazement, was at once made aware that a wondrous deed\r\nhad been accomplished--that water had been changed into wine!\r\n\r\nJesus had performed His first Miracle.\r\n\r\nFrom this beautiful story of the first miracle of Jesus, we learn that\r\nJesus Christ is God, and that Mary, the Mother of God, whose\r\nintercession is all-powerful with her Divine Son, has a loving and\r\nmotherly care over the smallest of our life\'s concerns.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FEAST _Veronese_.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nPRECEDED, went before in order of time.

She\r\nwas one of the poor but respectable old ladies who dress in rusty black,\r\nwear old-fashioned bonnets, and carry big bags.\r\n\r\nSome young folks laugh at these antiquated figures; but those who are\r\nbetter bred treat them with respect. They find something touching in the\r\nfaded suits, the withered faces, and the knowledge that these lonely old\r\nladies have lost youth, friends, and often fortune, and are patiently\r\nwaiting to be called away from a world that seems to have passed by and\r\nforgotten them.\r\n\r\nWell, as I slipped and shuffled along, I watched the little black bonnet\r\nin front, expecting every minute to see it go down, and trying to hurry,\r\nthat I might offer my help.\r\n\r\nAt the corner, I passed three little school-girls, and heard one say to\r\nanother, "O, I wouldn\'t; she will do well enough, and we shall lose our\r\ncoasting, unless we hurry."\r\n\r\n"But if she should tumble and break her poor old bones, I should feel so\r\nbad," returned the second, a pleasant-faced child, whose eyes, full of a\r\nsweet, pitiful expression, followed the old lady.\r\n\r\n"She\'s such a funny-looking woman, I shouldn\'t like to be seen walking\r\nwith her," said the third, as if she thought it a kind thing to do, but\r\nhad not the courage to try it.\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t care; she\'s old, and ought to be helped, and I\'m going to\r\ndo it," cried the pleasant-faced girl; and, running by me, I saw her\r\novertake the old lady, who stood at a crossing, looking wistfully over\r\nthe dangerous sheet of ice before her.\r\n\r\n"Please, ma\'am, may I help you, it\'s so bad here?" said the kind little\r\nvoice, as the hands in the red mittens were helpfully out-stretched.\r\n\r\n"O, thank you, dear. I\'d no idea the walking was so bad; but I must get\r\nhome." And the old face lighted up with a grateful smile, which was\r\nworth a dozen of the best coasts in Boston.\r\n\r\n"Take my arm then; I\'ll help you down the street, for I\'m afraid you\r\nmight fall," said the child, offering her arm.\r\n\r\n"Yes, dear, so I will. Now we shall get on beautifully. I\'ve been having\r\na dreadful time, for my over-socks are all holes, and I slip at every\r\nstep."\r\n\r\n"Keep hold, ma\'am, I won\'t fall. I have rubber boots, and can\'t tumble."\r\n\r\nSo chatting, the two went safely across, leaving me and the other girls\r\nto look after them and wish that we had done the little act of kindness,\r\nwhich now looked so lovely in another.\r\n\r\n"I think Katy is a very good girl, don\'t you?" said one child to the\r\nother.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do; let\'s wait till she comes back. No matter if we do lose some\r\ncoasts," answered the child who had tried to dissuade her playmate from\r\ngoing to the rescue.\r\n\r\nThen I left them; but I think they learned a lesson that day in real\r\npoliteness; for, as they watched little Katy dutifully supporting the\r\nold lady, undaunted by the rusty dress, the big bag, the old socks, and\r\nthe queer bonnet, both their faces lighted up with new respect and\r\naffection for their playmate.\r\n\r\n_Louisa M.

Let\'s begin right away."\r\n\r\n"Maggie, you said," continued James, "that you never could find out\r\n_when_ the angels were created. Neither could our teacher tell me. And\r\nI\'m told St. Augustine could only make a guess when they were created.\r\n\r\n"He thought the angels were created when God separated the light from\r\nthe darkness. But that\'s no matter, anyhow. We\'re sure there are angels;\r\nthat\'s the chief point."\r\n\r\n"Are you quite certain?" asked Maggie.\r\n\r\n"To be sure I am," said James. "If I met a man in the street I would\r\nknow he must have a father and a mother, although I had never heard when\r\nhe was born."\r\n\r\n"That\'s so," chimed in the proud mother.\r\n\r\n"Well, then, mother, many angels have been seen on earth, and they must\r\nhave been created some time. Let me tell you some of the places where it\r\nis said in the Bible that angels have been seen, and where they spoke,\r\ntoo."\r\n\r\n"Now, James," said the father, "let Maggie see if _she_ can find out\r\nsome of those places herself. Here is the Bible."\r\n\r\nWith the help of mother and James, Maggie soon found the history of Adam\r\nand Eve, where it is recorded that an angel with a flaming sword was\r\nplaced at the gate of Paradise.\r\n\r\n"Poor Adam and Eve," said Maggie, "they must have felt very sad."\r\n\r\n"Yes," answered Father Kennedy, who dropped in just then, and beheld his\r\nyoung theologians with the holy Book before them. "They felt very sorry,\r\nindeed, but they were consoled when told that a Savior would come to\r\nredeem them."\r\n\r\n"So you told us last Sunday," chimed in James. "Then you spoke about the\r\nangels at Bethlehem who sang glory to God in the highest."\r\n\r\n"And there was an angel in the desert when our Lord was tempted,"\r\nproceeded the father.\r\n\r\n"Oh! did you hear papa say the devil was an angel?" exclaimed James.\r\n\r\n"Of course the devil is an angel," said Maggie, glad to trip up her big\r\nbrother, "but he is a bad one."\r\n\r\n"I say yet that there were angels with our Lord after His forty days\'\r\nfast," insisted James.\r\n\r\n"So I say, too," retorted Maggie; "but while only one _bad angel_\r\ntempted our Lord, many good angels came to minister unto Him."\r\n\r\n"Very well, indeed," said Father Kennedy. "But let\'s hurry over some\r\nother points about the angels. Your turn; Master James, and give only\r\nthe place and person in each case."\r\n\r\n"Well, let me see; there were Abraham and the three angels who went to\r\nSodom, and the angels who beat the man that wanted to steal money from\r\nthe temple, and the angel who took Tobias on a long journey."\r\n\r\n"Please, Father Kennedy, wasn\'t it an _Archangel?_" inquired Maggie,\r\nstill determined to surpass her brother.\r\n\r\n"Never mind that," said the priest. "Go on, James; \'twill be Maggie\'s\r\nturn soon."\r\n\r\n"Well, there was an angel in the Garden of Olives, and angels at the\r\nResurrection of our Lord, and angels at His Ascension."\r\n\r\nHere Maggie exclaimed, "Please, Father Kennedy, may I have till next\r\nSunday to search out some angels? James has taken all mine."\r\n\r\n"No," mildly said the delighted clergyman, "_your _angel is always with\r\nyou, and James has his, too."\r\n\r\n"Father Kennedy, there\'s a man dying in the block behind the church,"\r\nsaid the servant from the half-open parlor door. "Excuse my coming in\r\nwithout knocking. They\'re in a great hurry."\r\n\r\n"Good night, children," said the devoted priest, "till next Sunday. May\r\nyour angels watch over you in the meantime."\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nARCHANGEL ([:a]rk [=a]n\' j[)e]l), a chief angel.\r\n\r\nARCHBISHOP ([:a]rch bish\' [)u]p), a chief bishop.\r\n\r\nARCH, as a prefix, means _chief_, and in nearly every case\r\nthe _ch_ is soft, as in archbishop.

But the colonists were fighting for a\r\nprinciple,--that of no taxation without representation, and would not\r\nbuy the tea. In New York and Philadelphia the people would not allow the\r\nvessels to land their cargoes.\r\n\r\nThe women of America held meetings in many towns, and declared they\r\nwould drink no tea until the hated tax was removed. The ladies had a\r\nhard time of it without their consoling cup of tea, but they stood out\r\nnobly.\r\n\r\nThree shiploads of tea were sent to Boston. On the night of December 16,\r\n1773, a party of young Americans, painted and dressed like Indians,\r\nboarded the three vessels lying in the harbor, opened the chests, and\r\nemptied all the tea into the water. They then slipped away to their\r\nhomes, and were never found out by the British. One of the leaders of\r\nthese daring young men was Paul Revere, whose famous midnight ride has\r\nbeen immortalized by Longfellow.\r\n\r\nWhen the news of the Boston Tea Party was carried across the ocean, the\r\nanger of the King was aroused, and he sent a strong force of soldiers to\r\nBoston to bring the rebels to terms. This act only increased the spirit\r\nof patriotism that burned in the breasts of all Americans.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:]\r\n\r\n\r\nGeorge P. Morris, the poet, describes this Tea Party, and the origin of\r\nthe tune "Yankee Doodle," in the following verses, which our American\r\nboys and girls of to-day will gladly read and sing:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       Once on a time old Johnny Bull flew in a raging fury,\r\n       And swore that Jonathan should have no trials, sir, by jury;\r\n       That no elections should be held, across the briny waters;\r\n       "And now," said he, "I\'ll tax the tea of all his sons and daughters."\r\n       Then down he sate in burly state, and blustered like a grandee,\r\n       And in derision made a tune called "Yankee doodle dandy."\r\n       "Yankee doodle"--these are facts--"Yankee doodle dandy;"\r\n       My son of wax, your tea I\'ll tax; you Yankee doodle dandy!"\r\n\r\n       John sent the tea from o\'er the sea, with heavy duties rated;\r\n       But whether hyson or bohea, I never heard it stated.\r\n       Then Jonathan to pout began--he laid a strong embargo--\r\n       "I\'ll drink no tea, by Jove!" so he threw overboard the cargo.\r\n       Then Johnny sent a regiment, big words and looks to bandy,\r\n       Whose martial band, when near the land, played "Yankee doodle dandy."\r\n       "Yankee doodle--keep it up--Yankee doodle dandy--\r\n       I\'ll poison with a tax your cup, you Yankee doodle dandy."\r\n\r\n       A long war then they had, in which John was at last defeated,\r\n       And "Yankee Doodle" was the march to which his troops retreated.\r\n       Cute Jonathan, to see them fly, could not restrain his laughter;\r\n       "That tune," said he, "suits to a T--I\'ll sing it ever after!"\r\n       Old Johnny\'s face, to his disgrace, was flushed with beer and brandy,\r\n       E\'en while he swore to sing no more this Yankee doodle dandy.\r\n       Yankee doodle,--ho-ha-he--Yankee doodle dandy,\r\n       We kept the tune, but not the tea--Yankee doodle dandy.\r\n\r\n       I\'ve told you now the origin of this most lively ditty,\r\n       Which Johnny Bull dislikes as "dull and stupid"--what a pity!\r\n       With "Hail Columbia" it is sung, in chorus full and hearty--\r\n       On land and main we breathe the strain John made for his tea party,\r\n       No matter how we rhyme the words, the music speaks them handy,\r\n       And where\'s the fair can\'t sing the air of Yankee doodle dandy?\r\n       Yankee doodle, firm and true--Yankee doodle dandy--\r\n       Yankee doodle, doodle do, Yankee doodle dandy!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nThe people of the thirteen original colonies adopted as a principle, "No\r\ntaxation without representation."

He intended it for a child whose\r\nappetite was gone, and who could be coaxed to eat only by amusing him.\r\nHe thought that such a pretty loaf might tempt even the sick. While he\r\nwaited for his change, a little boy six or eight years old, in poor but\r\nperfectly clean clothes, entered the baker\'s shop. "Ma\'am," said he to\r\nthe baker\'s wife, "mother sent me for a loaf of bread." The woman\r\nclimbed upon the counter (this happened in a country town), took from\r\nthe shelf of four-pound loaves the best one she could find, and put it\r\ninto the arms of the little boy.\r\n\r\nMy friend Jacques then first observed the thin and thoughtful face of\r\nthe little fellow. It contrasted strongly with the round, open\r\ncountenance of the great loaf, of which he was taking the greatest care.\r\n\r\n"Have you any money?" said the baker\'s wife.\r\n\r\nThe little boy\'s eyes grew sad.\r\n\r\n"No, ma\'am," said he, hugging the loaf closer to his thin blouse; "but\r\nmother told me to say that she would come and speak to you about it\r\nto-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Run along," said the good woman; "carry your bread home, child."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, ma\'am," said the poor little fellow.\r\n\r\nMy friend Jacques came forward for his money. He had put his purchase\r\ninto his pocket, and was about to go, when he found the child with the\r\nbig loaf, whom he had supposed to be halfway home, standing stock-still\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\n"What are you doing there?" said the baker\'s wife to the child, whom she\r\nalso had thought to be fairly off. "Don\'t you like the bread?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, ma\'am!" said the child.\r\n\r\n"Well, then, carry it to your mother, my little friend. If you wait any\r\nlonger, she will think you are playing by the way, and you will get a\r\nscolding."\r\n\r\nThe child did not seem to hear. Something else absorbed his attention.\r\n\r\nThe baker\'s wife went up to him, and gave him a friendly tap on the\r\nshoulder, "What _are_ you thinking about?" said she.\r\n\r\n"Ma\'am," said the little boy, "what is it that sings?"\r\n\r\n"There is no singing," said she.\r\n\r\n"Yes!" cried the little fellow. "Hear it! Queek, queek, queek, queek!"\r\n\r\nMy friend and the woman both listened, but they could hear nothing,\r\nunless it was the song of the crickets, frequent guests in bakers\'\r\nhouses.\r\n\r\n"It is a little bird," said the dear little fellow; "or perhaps the\r\nbread sings when it bakes, as apples do?"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed, little goosey!" said the baker\'s wife; "those are crickets.\r\nThey sing in the bakehouse because we are lighting the oven, and they\r\nlike to see the fire."\r\n\r\n"Crickets!" said the child; "are they really crickets?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, to be sure," said she good-humoredly. The child\'s face lighted up.\r\n\r\n"Ma\'am," said he, blushing at the boldness of his request, "I would like\r\nit very much if you would give me a cricket."\r\n\r\n"A cricket!" said the baker\'s wife, smiling; "what in the world would\r\nyou do with a cricket, my little friend? I would gladly give you all\r\nthere are in the house, to get rid of them, they run about so."\r\n\r\n"O ma\'am, give me one, only one, if you please!" said the child,\r\nclasping his little thin hands under the big loaf. "They say that\r\ncrickets bring good luck into houses; and perhaps if we had one at home,\r\nmother, who has so much trouble, wouldn\'t cry any more."\r\n\r\n"Why does your poor mamma cry?" said my friend, who could no longer help\r\njoining in the conversation.\r\n\r\n"On account of her bills, sir," said the little fellow. "Father is dead,\r\nand mother works very hard, but she cannot pay them all."\r\n\r\nMy friend took the child, and with him the great loaf, into his arms,\r\nand I really believe he kissed them both. Meanwhile the baker\'s wife,\r\nwho did not dare to touch a cricket herself, had gone into the\r\nbakehouse. She made her husband catch four, and put them into a box with\r\nholes in the cover, so that they might breathe. She gave the box to the\r\nchild, who went away perfectly happy.\r\n\r\nWhen he had gone, the baker\'s wife and my friend gave each other a good\r\nsqueeze of the hand. "Poor little fellow!" said they both together. Then\r\nshe took down her account book, and, finding the page where the mother\'s\r\ncharges were written, made a great dash all down the page, and then\r\nwrote at the bottom, "Paid."\r\n\r\nMeanwhile my friend, to lose no time, had put up in paper all the money\r\nin his pockets, where fortunately he had quite a sum that day, and had\r\nbegged the good wife to send it at once to the mother of the little\r\ncricket-boy, with her bill receipted, and a note, in which he told her\r\nshe had a son who would one day be her joy and pride.\r\n\r\nThey gave it to a baker\'s boy with long legs, and told him to make\r\nhaste. The child, with his big loaf, his four crickets, and his little\r\nshort legs, could not run very fast, so that, when he reached home, he\r\nfound his mother, for the first time in many weeks, with her eyes raised\r\nfrom her work, and a smile of peace and happiness upon her lips.\r\n\r\nThe boy believed that it was the arrival of his four little black things\r\nwhich had worked this miracle, and I do not think he was mistaken.\r\nWithout the crickets, and his good little heart, would this happy change\r\nhave taken place in his mother\'s fortunes?\r\n\r\n_From the French of Pierre J.

When it struck\r\none, Tom\'s wife laid the baby in the cradle, and took a saucepan off the\r\nfire, from which came a very savory smell.\r\n\r\n"If father doesn\'t come soon," she observed, "the apple dumplings will\r\nbe too much done."\r\n\r\n"There he is!" cried the little boy; "he is coming around by the wood;\r\nand now he\'s going over the bridge. O father! make haste, and have some\r\napple dumpling."\r\n\r\n"Tom," said his wife, as he came near, "art tired to-day?"\r\n\r\n"Uncommon tired," said Tom, as he threw himself on the bench, in the\r\nshadow of the thatch.\r\n\r\n"Has anything gone wrong?" asked his wife; "what\'s the matter?"\r\n\r\n"Matter!" repeated Tom; "is anything the matter? The matter is this,\r\nmother, that I\'m a miserable, hard-worked slave;" and he clapped his\r\nhands upon his knees and uttered in a deep voice, which frightened the\r\nchildren--"a miserable slave!"\r\n\r\n"Bless us!" said the wife, but could not make out what he meant.\r\n\r\n"A miserable, ill-used slave," continued Tom, "and always have been."\r\n\r\n"Always have been?" said his wife: "why, father, I thought thou used to\r\nsay, at the election time, that thou wast a free-born Briton."\r\n\r\n"Women have no business with politics," said Tom, getting up rather\r\nsulkily. Whether it was the force of habit, or the smell of the dinner,\r\nthat made him do it, has not been ascertained; but it is certain that he\r\nwalked into the house, ate plenty of pork and greens, and then took a\r\ntolerable share in demolishing the apple dumpling.\r\n\r\nWhen the little children were gone out to play, Tom\'s wife said to him,\r\n"I hope thou and thy master haven\'t had words to-day."\r\n\r\n"We\'ve had no words," said Tom, impatiently; "but I\'m sick of being at\r\nanother man\'s beck and call. It\'s, \'Tom, do this,\' and \'Tom do that,\'\r\nand nothing but work, work, work, from Monday morning till Saturday\r\nnight. I was thinking as I walked over to Squire Morton\'s to ask for the\r\nturnip seed for master,--I was thinking, Sally, that I am nothing but a\r\npoor workingman after all. In short, I\'m a slave; and my spirit won\'t\r\nstand it."\r\n\r\nSo saying, Tom flung himself out at the cottage door, and his wife\r\nthought he was going back to his work as usual; but she was mistaken. He\r\nwalked to the wood, and there, when he came to the border of a little\r\ntinkling stream, he sat down and began to brood over his grievances.\r\n\r\n"Now, I\'ll tell you what," said Tom to himself, "it\'s much pleasanter\r\nsitting here in the shade, than broiling over celery trenches, and\r\nthinning wall fruit, with a baking sun at one\'s back, and a hot wall\r\nbefore one\'s eyes. But I\'m a miserable slave. I must either work or see\r\nmy family starve; a very hard lot it is to be a workingman."\r\n\r\n"Ahem," said a voice close to him. Tom started, and, to his great\r\nsurprise, saw a small man about the size of his own baby, sitting\r\ncomposedly at his elbow. He was dressed in green,--green hat, green\r\ncoat, and green shoes. He had very bright black eyes, and they twinkled\r\nvery much as he looked at Tom and smiled.\r\n\r\n"Servant, sir!" said Tom, edging himself a little farther off.\r\n\r\n"Miserable slave," said the small man, "art thou so far lost to the\r\nnoble sense of freedom that thy very salutation acknowledges a mere\r\nstranger as thy master?\'\r\n\r\n"Who are you," said Tom, "and how dare you call me a slave?"\r\n\r\n"Tom," said the small man, with a knowing look, "don\'t speak roughly.\r\nKeep your rough words for your wife, my man; she is bound to bear them."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll thank you to let my affairs alone," interrupted Tom, shortly.\r\n\r\n"Tom, I\'m your friend; I think I can help you out of your difficulty.\r\nEvery minnow in this stream--they are very scarce, mind you--has a\r\nsilver tail."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t say so," exclaimed Tom, opening his eyes very wide; "fishing\r\nfor minnows and being one\'s own master would be much pleasanter than the\r\nsort of life I\'ve been leading this many a day."\r\n\r\n"Well, keep the secret as to where you get them, and much good may it do\r\nyou," said the man in green. "Farewell; I wish you joy in your freedom."\r\nSo saying, he walked away, leaving Tom on the brink of the stream, full\r\nof joy and pride.\r\n\r\nHe went to his master and told him that he had an opportunity for\r\nbettering himself, and should not work for him any longer.\r\n\r\nThe next day, he arose with the dawn, and went in search of minnows. But\r\nof all the minnows in the world, never were any so nimble as those with\r\nsilver tails. They were very shy, too, and had as many turns and doubles\r\nas a hare; what a life they led him!\r\n\r\nThey made him troll up the stream for miles; then, just as he thought\r\nhis chase was at an end and he was sure of them, they would leap quite\r\nout of the water, and dart down the stream again like little silver\r\narrows. Miles and miles he went, tired, wet, and hungry. He came home\r\nlate in the evening, wearied and footsore, with only three minnows in\r\nhis pocket, each with a silver tail.\r\n\r\n"But, at any rate," he said to himself, as he lay down in his bed,\r\n"though they lead me a pretty life, and I have to work harder than ever,\r\nyet I certainly am free; no man can now order me about."\r\n\r\nThis went on for a whole week; he worked very hard; but, up to Saturday\r\nafternoon, he had caught only fourteen minnows.\r\n\r\nAfter all, however, his fish were really great curiosities; and when he\r\nhad exhibited them all over the town, set them out in all lights,\r\npraised their perfections, and taken immense pains to conceal his\r\nimpatience and ill temper, he, at length, contrived to sell them all,\r\nand get exactly fourteen shillings for them, and no more.\r\n\r\n"Now, I\'ll tell you what, Tom Turner," said he to himself, "I\'ve found\r\nout this afternoon, and I don\'t mind your knowing it,--that every one of\r\nthose customers of yours was your master. Why! you were at the beck of\r\nevery man, woman, and child that came near you;--obliged to be in a good\r\ntemper, too, which was very aggravating."\r\n\r\n"True, Tom," said the man in green, starting up in his path. "I knew you\r\nwere a man of sense; look you, you are all workingmen; and you must all\r\nplease your customers. Your master was your customer; what he bought of\r\nyou was your work. Well, you must let the work be such as will please\r\nthe customer."\r\n\r\n"All workingmen? How do you make that out?" said Tom, chinking the\r\nfourteen shillings in his hand. "Is my master a workingman; and has he a\r\nmaster of his own? Nonsense!"\r\n\r\n"No nonsense at all; he works with his head, keeps his books, and\r\nmanages his great mills. He has many masters; else why was he nearly\r\nruined last year?"\r\n\r\n"He was nearly ruined because he made some newfangled kinds of patterns\r\nat his works, and people would not buy them," said Tom. "Well, in a way\r\nof speaking, then, he works to please his masters, poor fellow! He is,\r\nas one may say, a fellow-servant, and plagued with very awkward masters.\r\nSo I should not mind his being my master, and I think I\'ll go and tell\r\nhim so."\r\n\r\n"I would, Tom," said the man in green. "Tell him you have not been able\r\nto better yourself, and you have no objection now to dig up the\r\nasparagus bed."\r\n\r\nSo Tom trudged home to his wife, gave her the money he had earned, got\r\nhis old master to take him back, and kept a profound secret his\r\nadventures with the man in green.\r\n\r\n_Jean Ingelow._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:]\r\n\r\n\r\n"Every minnow in the stream (they are very scarce, mind you) has a\r\nsilver tail."

You notice that you have read the words in\r\nparenthesis in a _lower tone_ and _faster time._ Groups of words like\r\nthe above are not always enclosed by marks of parenthesis; but that\r\nmakes no difference in the reading of them.\r\n\r\nThe following examples are taken from "The Martyr\'s Boy," page 243.\r\nPractice on them till you believe you have mastered the method.\r\n\r\nI never heard anything so cold and insipid (I hope it is not wrong to\r\nsay so) as the compositions read by my companions.\r\n\r\nOnly, I know not why, he seems ever to have a grudge against me.\r\n\r\nI felt that I was strong enough--my rising anger made me so--to seize my\r\nunjust assailant by the throat, and cast him gasping to the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\nMemorize:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       "Work! and the clouds of care will fly;\r\n         Pale want will pass away.\r\n       Work! and the leprosy of crime\r\n         And tyrants must decay.\r\n       Leave the dead ages in their urns:\r\n         The present time be ours,\r\n       To grapple bravely with our lot,\r\n         And strew our path with flowers."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_36_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BROOK.\r\n\r\n\r\n       I come from haunts of coot and hern,\r\n         I make a sudden sally,\r\n       And sparkle out among the fern,\r\n         To bicker down a valley.\r\n       By thirty hills I hurry down,\r\n         Or slip between the ridges,\r\n       By twenty thorps, a little town,\r\n         And half a hundred bridges.\r\n       Till last by Philip\'s farm I flow\r\n         To join the brimming river;\r\n       For men may come, and men may go,\r\n         But I go on forever.\r\n\r\n       I chatter over stony ways\r\n         In little sharps and trebles;\r\n       I bubble into eddying bays;\r\n         I babble on the pebbles.\r\n       With many a curve my banks I fret\r\n         By many a field and fallow.\r\n       And many a fairy foreland set\r\n         With willow-weed and mallow.\r\n       I chatter, chatter, as I flow\r\n         To join the brimming river;\r\n       For men may come, and men may go,\r\n         But I go on forever.\r\n\r\n       I steal by lawns and grassy plots,\r\n         I slide by hazel covers,\r\n       I move the sweet forget-me-nots\r\n         That grow for happy lovers.\r\n       I slip, I slide, I gloom, I glance,\r\n         Among my skimming swallows;\r\n       I make the netted sunbeams dance\r\n         Against my sandy shallows.\r\n\r\n       I murmur under moon and stars\r\n         In brambly wildernesses;\r\n       I linger by my shingly bars;\r\n         I loiter round my cresses.\r\n       And out again I curve and flow\r\n         To join the brimming river;\r\n       For men may come, and men may go,\r\n         But I go on forever.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Tennyson_.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nHAUNTS, places of frequent resort.\r\n\r\nCOOT and hern, water fowls that frequent lakes and other still\r\nwaters.\r\n\r\nBICKER, to move quickly and unsteadily, like flame or water.\r\n\r\nTHORP, a cluster of houses; a hamlet.\r\n\r\nSHARPS and trebles, terms in music.

Suppose the cake has\r\nto be divided among you, Arthur and Winnie. If I cut off a very thin\r\nslice for you, and divide what is left between your brother and sister,\r\nwill that be fair?"\r\n\r\n"No, that would not be at all fair, Grandpa."\r\n\r\n"Why not? Did I not divide the cake according to your advice? Did I not\r\ncut it into three parts?"\r\n\r\n"But one was larger than the other, and they ought to have been exactly\r\nthe same size."\r\n\r\n"Then you think, that if I had divided the cake into three equal parts,\r\nit would have been quite fair?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; if you had done so, I should have no cause to complain."\r\n\r\n"Now, Norman, let us suppose that I have three baskets to send to a\r\ndistance by three persons; shall I act fairly if I give each a basket to\r\ncarry?"\r\n\r\n"Stop a minute, Grandpa, I must think a little. No, it might not be\r\nfair, for one of the baskets might be a great deal larger than the\r\nothers."\r\n\r\n"Come, Norman, I see that you are really beginning to think. But we will\r\ntake care that the baskets are all of the same size."\r\n\r\n"Then it would be quite fair for each one to take a basket."\r\n\r\n"What! if one was full of lead, and the other two were filled with\r\nfeathers?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no! I never thought of that. Let the baskets be of the same weight,\r\nand all will be right."\r\n\r\n"Are you quite sure of that? Suppose one of the three persons is a\r\nstrong man, another a weak woman, and the third a little child?"\r\n\r\n"Grandpa! Grandpa! Why, I am altogether wrong. How many things there are\r\nto think about."\r\n\r\n"Well, Norman, I hope you see that if burdens have to be equally borne,\r\nthey must be suited to the strength of those who have to bear them."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I see that clearly now. Put one more question to me, Grandpa, and\r\nI will try to answer it properly this time."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, my next question is this: If I want a man to dig for me,\r\nand three persons apply for the situation, will it not be fair if I set\r\nthem to work to try them, and choose the one who does his task in the\r\nquickest time?"\r\n\r\n"Are they all to begin their work at the same time?"\r\n\r\n"A very proper question, Norman: yes, they shall all start together."\r\n\r\n"Has one just as much ground to dig as another?"\r\n\r\n"Exactly the same."\r\n\r\n"And will each man have a good spade?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, their spades shall be exactly alike."\r\n\r\n"But one part of the field may be soft earth, and the other hard and\r\nstony."\r\n\r\n"I will take care of that. All shall be fairly dealt with. The ground\r\nshall be everywhere alike."\r\n\r\n"Well, I think, Grandpa, that he who does his work first, if done as\r\nwell as that of either of the other two, is the best man."\r\n\r\n"And I think so, too, Norman; and if you go on in this way it will be\r\ngreatly to your advantage. Only form the habit of being thoughtful in\r\nlittle things, and you will be sure to judge wisely in important ones."\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the words _suit_ (s[=u]t) and _soon_ (s[=oo]n), have the marked\r\nvowels the same sound?\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the two statements,--\r\n\r\n\r\n       I give it to you because it\'s good;\r\n       Virtue brings its own reward;\r\n\r\n\r\nwhy is there an apostrophe in the first "it\'s," and none in the second?\r\n\r\n\r\n       Let your hands be honest and clean--\r\n       Let your conscience be honest and clean--\r\n\r\n\r\nCombine these two sentences by the word _and_; rewrite them, omitting\r\nall needless words.\r\n\r\nCompose two sentences, one having the action-word _learned_; the other\r\nthe word _taught_.\r\n\r\nFill each of the following blank spaces with the correct form of the\r\naction-word _bear_:\r\n\r\n\r\nAs Christ -- His cross, so must we -- ours.\r\nOur cross must be --.

It was for a good motive that little Peter\r\ndesired to come to Florence: he wanted to be an artist, and he knew\r\nthere was a school for artists there. When he had seen the town well,\r\nPeter stationed himself at the Cardinal\'s palace; and inhaling the odor\r\nof the cooking, he waited patiently till his Eminence was served, that\r\nhe might speak to his old companion, Thomas. He had to wait a long time;\r\nbut at length Thomas appeared.\r\n\r\n"You here, Peter! What have you come to Florence for?"\r\n\r\n"I am come to learn painting."\r\n\r\n"You had much better learn kitchen work to begin with; one is then sure\r\nnot to die of hunger."\r\n\r\n"You have as much to eat as you want here, then?" replied Peter.\r\n\r\n"Indeed I have," said Thomas; "I might eat till I made myself ill every\r\nday, if I chose to do it."\r\n\r\n"Then," said Peter, "I see we shall do very well. As you have too much\r\nand I not enough, I will bring my appetite, and you will bring the food;\r\nand we shall get on famously."\r\n\r\n"Very well," said Thomas.\r\n\r\n"Let us begin at once, then," said Peter; "for as I have eaten nothing\r\nto-day, I should like to try the plan directly."\r\n\r\nThomas then took little Peter into the garret where he slept, and bade\r\nhim wait there till he brought him some fragments that he was freely\r\npermitted to take. The repast was a merry one, for Thomas was in high\r\nspirits, and little Peter had a famous appetite.\r\n\r\n"Ah," cried Thomas, "here you are fed and lodged. Now the question is,\r\nhow are you going to study?"\r\n\r\n"I shall study like all artists--with pencil and paper."\r\n\r\n"But then, Peter, have you money to buy the paper and pencils?"\r\n\r\n"No, I have nothing; but I said to myself, \'Thomas, who is scullion at\r\nhis lordship\'s, must have plenty of money!\' As you are rich, it is just\r\nthe same as if I was."\r\n\r\nThomas scratched his head and replied, that as to broken victuals, he\r\nhad plenty of them; but that he would have to wait three years before he\r\nshould receive wages. Peter did not mind. The garret walls were white.\r\nThomas could give him charcoal, and so he set to draw on the walls with\r\nthat; and after a little while somebody gave Thomas a silver coin.\r\n\r\nWith joy he brought it to his friend. Pencils and paper were bought.\r\nEarly in the morning Peter went out studying the pictures in the\r\ngalleries, the statues in the streets, the landscapes in the\r\nneighborhood; and in the evening, tired and hungry, but enchanted with\r\nwhat he had seen, he crept back into the garret, where he was always\r\nsure to find his dinner hidden under the mattress, _to keep it warm,_ as\r\nThomas said. Very soon the first charcoal drawings were rubbed off, and\r\nPeter drew his best designs to ornament his friend\'s room.\r\n\r\nOne day Cardinal Sachetti, who was restoring his palace, came with the\r\narchitect to the very top of the house, and happened to enter the\r\nscullion\'s garret. The room was empty; but both Cardinal and architect\r\nwere struck with the genius of the drawings. They thought they were\r\nexecuted by Thomas, and his Eminence sent for him. When poor Thomas\r\nheard that the Cardinal had been in the garret, and had seen what he\r\ncalled Peter\'s daubs, he thought all was lost.\r\n\r\n"You will no longer be a scullion," said the Cardinal to him; and\r\nThomas, thinking this meant banishment and disgrace, fell on his knees,\r\nand cried, "Oh! my lord, what will become of poor Peter?"\r\n\r\nThe Cardinal made him tell his story.\r\n\r\n"Bring him to me when he comes in to-night," said he, smiling.\r\n\r\nBut Peter did not return that night, nor the next, till at length a\r\nfortnight had passed without a sign of him. At last came the news that\r\nthe monks of a distant convent had received and kept with them a boy of\r\nfourteen, who had come to ask permission to copy a painting of Raphael\r\nin the chapel of the convent. This boy was Peter. Finally, the Cardinal\r\nsent him as a pupil to one of the first artists in Rome.\r\n\r\nFifty years afterwards there were two old men who lived as brothers in\r\none of the most beautiful houses in Florence. One said of the other, "He\r\nis the greatest painter of our age." The other said of the first, "He is\r\na model for evermore of a faithful friend."\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nPETER OF CORTONA, a great Italian painter and architect.

He was a studious\r\nreader of the learned and sacred volumes in the convent library. One day\r\nhe read in the Epistles of St. Peter the words, "One day is with the\r\nLord as a thousand years, and a thousand years as one day;" and this\r\nsaying seemed impossible in his eyes, so that he spent many an hour in\r\nmeditating upon it.\r\n\r\nThen one morning it happened that the monk descended from the library\r\ninto the cloister garden, and there he saw a little bird perched on the\r\nbough of a tree, singing sweetly, like a nightingale. The bird did not\r\nmove as the monk approached her, till he came quite close, and then she\r\nflew to another bough, and again another, as the monk pursued her. Still\r\nsinging the same sweet song, the nightingale flew on; and the monk,\r\nentranced by the sound, followed her out of the garden into the wide\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nAt last he stopped, and turned back to the cloister; but every thing\r\nseemed changed to him. Every thing had become larger, more beautiful,\r\nand older,--the buildings, the garden; and in the place of the low,\r\nhumble cloister church, a lofty minster with three towers reared its\r\nhead to the sky. This seemed very strange to the monk, indeed marvelous;\r\nbut he walked on to the cloister gate and timidly rang the bell. A\r\nporter entirely unknown to him answered his summons, and drew back in\r\namazement when he saw the monk.\r\n\r\nThe latter went in, and wandered through the church, gazing with\r\nastonishment on memorial stones which he never remembered to have seen\r\nbefore. Presently the brethren of the cloister entered the church; but\r\nall retreated when they saw the strange figure of the monk. The abbot\r\nonly (but not his abbot) stopped, and stretching a crucifix before him,\r\nexclaimed, "In the name of Christ, who art thou, spirit or mortal? And\r\nwhat dost thou seek here, coming from the dead among us, the living?"\r\n\r\nThe monk, trembling and tottering like an old man, cast his eyes to the\r\nground, and for the first time became aware that a long silvery beard\r\ndescended from his chin over his girdle, to which was still suspended\r\nthe key of the library. To the monks around, the stranger seemed some\r\nmarvelous appearance; and, with a mixture of awe and admiration, they\r\nled him to the chair of the abbot. There he gave the key to a young\r\nmonk, who opened the library, and brought out a chronicle wherein it was\r\nwritten that three hundred years ago the monk Urban had disappeared; and\r\nno one knew whither he had gone.\r\n\r\n"Ah, bird of the forest, was it then thy song?" said the monk Urban,\r\nwith a sigh. "I followed thee for scarce three minutes, listening to thy\r\nnotes, and yet three hundred years have passed away! Thou hast sung to\r\nme the song of eternity which I could never before learn. Now I know it;\r\nand, dust myself, I pray to God kneeling in the dust." With these words\r\nhe sank to the ground, and his spirit ascended to heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nCopy the last paragraph, omitting all marks of punctuation.\r\n\r\nClose the book, and punctuate what you have written.

Early in the\r\nevening the wise old Cedars had shaken their heads and told of strange\r\nthings that were to happen. They had lived in the Forest many, many\r\nyears; but never had they seen such marvelous sights as were to be seen\r\nnow in the sky, and upon the hills, and in the distant village.\r\n\r\n"Pray tell us what you see," pleaded a little Vine; "we who are not so\r\ntall as you can behold none of these wonderful things."\r\n\r\n"The whole sky seems to be aflame," said one of the Cedars, "and the\r\nStars appear to be dancing among the clouds; angels walk down from\r\nheaven to the earth and talk with the shepherds upon the hills."\r\n\r\nThe Vine trembled with excitement. Its nearest neighbor was a tiny tree,\r\nso small it was scarcely ever noticed; yet it was a very beautiful\r\nlittle tree, and the Vines and Ferns and Mosses loved it very dearly.\r\n\r\n"How I should like to see the Angels!" sighed the little Tree; "and how\r\nI should like to see the Stars dancing among the clouds! It must be very\r\nbeautiful. Oh, listen to the music! I wonder whence it comes."\r\n\r\n"The Angels are singing," said a Cedar; "for none but angels could make\r\nsuch sweet music."\r\n\r\n"And the Stars are singing, too," said another Cedar; "yes, and the\r\nshepherds on the hills join in the song."\r\n\r\nThe trees listened to the singing. It was a strange song about a Child\r\nthat had been born. But further than this they did not understand. The\r\nstrange and glorious song continued all the night.\r\n\r\nIn the early morning the Angels came to the Forest singing the same song\r\nabout the Child, and the Stars sang in chorus with them, until every\r\npart of the woods rang with echoes of that wondrous song. They were clad\r\nall in white, and there were crowns upon their fair heads, and golden\r\nharps in their hands. Love, hope, joy and compassion beamed from their\r\nbeautiful faces. The Angels came through the Forest to where the little\r\nTree stood, and gathering around it, they touched it with their hands,\r\nkissed its little branches, and sang even more sweetly than before. And\r\ntheir song was about the Child, the Child, the Child, that had been\r\nborn. Then the Stars came down from the skies and danced and hung upon\r\nthe branches of the little Tree, and they, too, sang the song of the\r\nChild.\r\n\r\nWhen they left the Forest, one Angel remained to guard the little Tree.\r\nNight and day he watched so that no harm should come to it. Day by day\r\nit grew in strength and beauty. The sun sent it his choicest rays,\r\nheaven dropped its sweetest dew upon it, and the winds sang to it their\r\nprettiest songs.\r\n\r\nSo the years passed, and the little Tree grew until it became the pride\r\nand glory of the Forest.\r\n\r\nOne day the Tree heard some one coming through the Forest. "Have no\r\nfear," said the Angel, "for He who comes is the Master."\r\n\r\nAnd the Master came to the Tree and placed His Hands upon its smooth\r\ntrunk and branches. He stooped and kissed the Tree, and then turned and\r\nwent away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _A. Bida._]\r\n\r\nMany times after that the Master came to the Forest, rested beneath the\r\nTree and enjoyed the shade of its foliage. Many times He slept there and\r\nthe Tree watched over Him. Many times men came with the Master to the\r\nForest, sat with Him in the shade of the Tree, and talked with Him of\r\nthings which the Tree never could understand. It heard them tell how the\r\nMaster healed the sick and raised the dead and bestowed blessings\r\nwherever He walked.\r\n\r\nBut one night the Master came alone into the Forest. His Face was pale\r\nand wet with tears. He fell upon His knees and prayed. The Tree heard\r\nHim, and all the Forest was still. In the morning there was a sound of\r\nrude voices and a clashing of swords.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Hofmann._]\r\n\r\nStrange men plied their axes with cruel vigor, and the Tree was hewn to\r\nthe ground. Its beautiful branches were cut away, and its soft, thick\r\nfoliage was strewn to the winds. The Trees of the Forest wept.\r\n\r\nThe cruel men dragged the hewn Tree away, and the Forest saw it no more.\r\n\r\nBut the Night Wind that swept down from the City of the Great King\r\nstayed that night in the Forest awhile to say that it had seen that day\r\na Cross raised on Calvary,--the Tree on which was nailed the Body of the\r\ndying Master.\r\n\r\n_Eugene Field._\r\n\r\nFrom "A Little Book of Profitable Tales."

The first course\r\nconsisted of tongues, cooked in different ways and served with\r\nappropriate sauces. This gave rise to much mirth and many witty remarks\r\nby the guests. The second course was also nothing but tongues, and so\r\nwith the third and fourth. This seemed to go beyond a joke, and Xanthus\r\ndemanded in an angry manner of Aesop, "Did I not tell you to provide the\r\nchoicest dainties that money could procure?" "And what excels the\r\ntongue?" replied Aesop, "It is the channel of learning and philosophy.\r\nBy it addresses and eulogies are made, and commerce carried on,\r\ncontracts executed, and marriages consummated. Nothing is equal to the\r\ntongue." The company applauded Aesop\'s wit, and good feeling was\r\nrestored.\r\n\r\n"Well," said Xanthus to the guests, "pray do me the favor of dining with\r\nme again to-morrow. I have a mind to change the feast; to-morrow," said\r\nhe, turning to Aesop, "provide us with the worst meat you can find." The\r\nnext day the guests assembled as before, and to their astonishment and\r\nthe anger of Xanthus nothing but tongues was provided. "How, sir," said\r\nXanthus, "should tongues be the best of meat one day and the worst\r\nanother?" "What," replied Aesop, "can be worse than the tongue? What\r\nwickedness is there under the sun that it has not a part in? Treasons,\r\nviolence, injustice, fraud, are debated and resolved upon, and\r\ncommunicated by the tongue. It is the ruin of empires, cities, and of\r\nprivate friendships."

GOING! GONE!"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other day, as I was walking through a side street in one of our\r\nlarge cities, I heard these words ringing out from a room so crowded\r\nwith people that I could but just see the auctioneer\'s face and uplifted\r\nhammer above the heads of the crowd.\r\n\r\n"Going! Going! Going! Gone!" and down came the hammer with a sharp rap.\r\n\r\nI do not know how or why it was, but the words struck me with a new\r\nforce and significance. I had heard them hundreds of times before, with\r\nonly a sense of amusement. This time they sounded solemn.\r\n\r\n"Going! Going! Gone!"\r\n\r\n"That is the way it is with life," I said to myself;--"with time." This\r\nworld is a sort of auction-room; we do not know that we are buyers: we\r\nare, in fact, more like beggars; we have brought no money to exchange\r\nfor precious minutes, hours, days, or years; they are given to us. There\r\nis no calling out of terms, no noisy auctioneer, no hammer; but\r\nnevertheless, the time is "going! going! gone!"\r\n\r\nThe more I thought of it, the more solemn did the words sound, and the\r\nmore did they seem to me a good motto to remind one of the value of\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nWhen we are young we think old people are preaching and prosing when\r\nthey say so much about it,--when they declare so often that days, weeks,\r\neven years, are short. I can remember when a holiday, a whole day long,\r\nappeared to me an almost inexhaustible play-spell; when one afternoon,\r\neven, seemed an endless round of pleasure, and the week that was to come\r\nseemed longer than does a whole year now.\r\n\r\nOne needs to live many years before one learns how little time there is\r\nin a year,--how little, indeed, there will be even in the longest\r\npossible life,--how many things one will still be obliged to leave\r\nundone.\r\n\r\nBut there is one thing, boys and girls, that you can realize if you will\r\ntry--if you will stop and think about it a little; and that is, how fast\r\nand how steadily the present time is slipping away. However long life\r\nmay seem to you as you look forward to the whole of it, the present hour\r\nhas only sixty minutes, and minute by minute, second by second, it is\r\n"going! going! gone!" If you gather nothing from it as it passes, it is\r\n"gone" forever. Nothing is so utterly, hopelessly lost as "lost time."\r\nIt makes me unhappy when I look back and see how much time I have\r\nwasted; how much I might have learned and done if I had but understood\r\nhow short is the longest hour.\r\n\r\nAll the men and women who have made the world better, happier or wiser\r\nfor their having lived in it, have done so by working diligently and\r\npersistently. Yet, I am certain that not even one of these, when\r\n"looking backward from his manhood\'s prime, saw not the specter of his\r\nmis-spent time." Now, don\'t suppose I am so foolish as to think that all\r\nthe preaching in the world can make anything look to young eyes as it\r\nlooks to old eyes; not a bit of it.\r\n\r\nBut think about it a little; don\'t let time slip away by the minute,\r\nhour, day, without getting something out of it! Look at the clock now\r\nand then, and listen to the pendulum, saying of every minute, as it\r\nflies,--"Going! going! gone!"\r\n\r\n_Helen Hunt Jackson._\r\n\r\nFrom "Bits of Talk."

Since that mournful period, a great change\r\nhad come over me. My childish years had passed away, and with them my\r\nyouthful character. The world was altered, too; and as I stood at my\r\nmother\'s grave, I could hardly realize that I was the same thoughtless,\r\nhappy creature, whose cheeks she so often kissed in an excess of\r\ntenderness.\r\n\r\nBut the varied events of thirteen years had not effaced the remembrance\r\nof that mother\'s smile. It seemed as if I had seen her but yesterday--as\r\nif the blessed sound of her well-remembered voice was in my ear. The gay\r\ndreams of my infancy and childhood were brought back so distinctly to my\r\nmind that, had it not been for one bitter recollection, the tears I shed\r\nwould have been gentle and refreshing.\r\n\r\nThe circumstance may seem a trifling one, but the thought of it now\r\npains my heart; and I relate it, that those children who have parents to\r\nlove them may learn to value them as they ought.\r\n\r\nMy mother had been ill a long time, and I had become so accustomed to\r\nher pale face and weak voice, that I was not frightened at them, as\r\nchildren usually are. At first, it is true, I sobbed violently; but\r\nwhen, day after day, I returned from school, and found her the same, I\r\nbegan to believe she would always be spared to me; but they told me she\r\nwould die.\r\n\r\nOne day when I had lost my place in the class, I came home discouraged\r\nand fretful. I went to my mother\'s chamber. She was paler than usual,\r\nbut she met me with the same affectionate smile that always welcomed my\r\nreturn. Alas! when I look back through the lapse of thirteen years, I\r\nthink my heart must have been stone not to have been melted by it. She\r\nrequested me to go downstairs and bring her a glass of water. I\r\npettishly asked her why she did not call a domestic to do it. With a\r\nlook of mild reproach, which I shall never forget if I live to be a\r\nhundred years old, she said, "Will not my daughter bring a glass of\r\nwater for her poor, sick mother?"\r\n\r\nI went and brought her the water, but I did not do it kindly. Instead of\r\nsmiling, and kissing her as I had been wont to do, I set the glass down\r\nvery quickly, and left the room. After playing a short time, I went to\r\nbed without bidding my mother good night; but when alone in my room, in\r\ndarkness and silence, I remembered how pale she looked, and how her\r\nvoice trembled when she said, "Will not my daughter bring a glass of\r\nwater for her poor, sick mother?" I could not sleep. I stole into her\r\nchamber to ask forgiveness. She had sunk into an easy slumber, and they\r\ntold me I must not waken her.\r\n\r\nI did not tell anyone what troubled me, but stole back to my bed,\r\nresolved to rise early in the morning and tell her how sorry I was for\r\nmy conduct. The sun was shining brightly when I awoke, and, hurrying on\r\nmy clothes, I hastened to my mother\'s chamber. She was dead! She never\r\nspoke more--never smiled upon me again; and when I touched the hand that\r\nused to rest upon my head in blessing, it was so cold that it made me\r\nstart.\r\n\r\nI bowed down by her side, and sobbed in the bitterness of my heart. I\r\nthen wished that I might die, and be buried with her; and, old as I now\r\nam, I would give worlds, were they mine to give, could my mother but\r\nhave lived to tell me she forgave my childish ingratitude.

It was given amidst\r\nfire and smoke, thunders and lightnings, and whatever else could fill\r\nthe minds of the Jews with fear and wonder. Compelled, as it were, by\r\nthe idolatrous acts of His chosen people, by their repeated rebellions,\r\nand their endless murmurings, God showed Himself to them as the almighty\r\nSovereign, the King of kings, the Lord of lords, whose holiness, power,\r\nmajesty, and severity in punishing sin, filled their minds with awe and\r\ndread.\r\n\r\nIt was not thus that the New Law, the Law of grace and love, was given\r\nto the world. No dark cloud covered the mount of the Beatitudes from\r\nwhich our Lord preached; no deafening thunders were heard; no angry\r\nflashes of lightning were visible. There was nothing forbidding in the\r\nvoice, words, or appearance of the Divine Lawgiver. In the whole\r\nexterior of our Savior there was a something so sweet, so humble, so\r\nmeek and captivating, that the people were filled with admiration and\r\nlove.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable features of this first sermon that Christ\r\npreached is the fact that He constantly called God our Father. How\r\nbeautifully His teachings reveal the spirit of the Law of love! Listen\r\nto Him attentively, and ponder upon His words:\r\n\r\n"Take heed that you do not your justice before men, to be seen by them:\r\notherwise you shall not have a reward of your FATHER WHO is in\r\nheaven.... But when thou dost alms, let not thy left hand know what thy\r\nright hand doth; that thy alms may be in secret, and thy FATHER WHO\r\nseeth in secret will repay thee.... Love your enemies; do good to them\r\nthat hate you; and pray for them that persecute and calumniate you; that\r\nyou may be the children of your FATHER WHO is in heaven, Who maketh His\r\nsun to rise upon the good and bad, and raineth upon the just and the\r\nunjust.\r\n\r\n"Behold the birds of the air, for they neither sow, nor do they reap,\r\nnor gather into barns: and your heavenly FATHER feedeth them. Are not\r\nyou of much more value than they?... If you, then, being evil, know how\r\nto give good gifts to your children, how much more will your FATHER WHO\r\nis in heaven give good things to them that ask Him.... For if you will\r\nforgive men their offenses, your heavenly FATHER will forgive you also\r\nyour offenses. But if you will not forgive men, neither will your FATHER\r\nforgive you your offenses.... Thus therefore shall you pray: OUR FATHER\r\nWho art in heaven."\r\n\r\nFrom these and many other similar expressions found in the very first\r\nsermon which Jesus Christ ever preached, we learn that it is the\r\nexpressed will of God that we should look upon Him as our loving Father;\r\nand that, however unworthy we may be, we should look upon ourselves as\r\nHis beloved children. There cannot be a possible doubt of this, since it\r\nis taught so positively by His only begotten Son, Who is "the Way, the\r\nTruth, and the Life."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Henry le Jeune._]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nSinai (s[=i]\' n[=a]), a mountain in Arabia.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_56_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHAPPY OLD AGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n       "You are old, Father William," the young man cried;\r\n         "The few locks that are left you are gray;\r\n       You are hale, Father William, a hearty old man;\r\n         Now, tell me the reason, I pray."\r\n\r\n       "In the days of my youth," Father William replied,\r\n         "I remembered that youth would fly fast,\r\n       And abused not my health and my vigor at first,\r\n         That I never might need them at last."\r\n\r\n       "You are old, Father William," the young man cried,\r\n         "And life must be hastening away;\r\n       You are cheerful, and love to converse upon death!\r\n         Now, tell me the reason, I pray."\r\n\r\n       "I am cheerful, young man," Father William replied;\r\n         "Let the cause thy attention engage;\r\n       In the days of my youth I remembered my God!\r\n         And He hath not forgotten my age."\r\n\r\n\r\n_Robert Southey._\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nTell the story of the poem in your own words.

They have a power which seems to\r\nbe beyond natural causes, as if they were some angel\'s song, which had\r\nlost its way and come on earth, and sang on undyingly, smiting the\r\nhearts of men with sweetest wounds, and putting for the while an angel\'s\r\nnature into us.\r\n\r\nLet us then think first of all of the power of kind words. In truth,\r\nthere is hardly a power on earth equal to them. It seems as they could\r\nalmost do what in reality God alone can do, namely, soften the hard and\r\nangry hearts of men. Many a friendship, long, loyal, and\r\nself-sacrificing, rested at first on no thicker a foundation than a kind\r\nword.\r\n\r\nKind words produce happiness. How often have we ourselves been made\r\nhappy by kind words, in a manner and to an extent which we are unable to\r\nexplain! And happiness is a great power of holiness. Thus, kind words,\r\nby their power of producing happiness, have also a power of producing\r\nholiness, and so of winning men to God.\r\n\r\nIf I may use such a word when I am speaking of religious subjects, it is\r\nby voice and words that men mesmerize each other. Hence it is that the\r\nworld is converted by the voice of the preacher. Hence it is that an\r\nangry word rankles longer in the heart than an angry gesture, nay, very\r\noften even longer than a blow. Thus, all that has been said of the power\r\nof kindness in general applies with an additional and peculiar force to\r\nkind words.\r\n\r\n_Father Faber._\r\n\r\nFrom "Spiritual Conferences."\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nExplain: Kind words are the music of the world--An angel\'s song that had\r\nlost its way and come on earth--Smiting the hearts of men with sweetest\r\nwounds--Putting an angel\'s nature into us--Hard and angry hearts of\r\nmen--An angry word rankles longer in the heart than even a blow.\r\n\r\nMention some occasions when kind words addressed to you made you very\r\nhappy.

Some were to die on the morrow, and to\r\nthese it was necessary to send the Holy Viaticum to strengthen their\r\nsouls for the battle before them. On this day, when the hostile passions\r\nof heathen Rome were unusually excited by the coming slaughter of so\r\nmany Christian victims, it was a work of more than common danger to\r\ndischarge this duty.\r\n\r\nThe Sacred Bread was prepared, and the priest turned round from the\r\naltar on which it was placed, to see who would be its safest bearer.\r\nBefore any other could step forward, the young acolyte Tarcisius knelt\r\nat his feet. With his hands extended before him, ready to receive the\r\nsacred deposit, with a countenance beautiful in its lovely innocence as\r\nan angel\'s, he seemed to entreat for preference, and even to claim it.\r\n\r\n"Thou art too young, my child," said the kind priest, filled with\r\nadmiration of the picture before him.\r\n\r\n"My youth, holy father, will be my best protection. Oh! do not refuse me\r\nthis great honor." The tears stood in the boy\'s eyes, and his cheeks\r\nglowed with a modest emotion, as he spoke these words. He stretched\r\nforth his hands eagerly, and his entreaty was so full of fervor and\r\ncourage, that the plea was irresistible. The priest took the Divine\r\nMysteries, wrapped up carefully in a linen cloth, then in an outer\r\ncovering, and put them on his palms, saying--\r\n\r\n"Remember, Tarcisius, what a treasure is intrusted to thy feeble care.\r\nAvoid public places as thou goest along; and remember that holy things\r\nmust not be delivered to dogs, nor pearls be cast before swine. Thou\r\nwilt keep safely God\'s sacred gifts?"\r\n\r\n"I will die rather than betray them," answered the holy youth, as he\r\nfolded the heavenly trust in the bosom of his tunic, and with cheerful\r\nreverence started on his journey. There was a gravity beyond the usual\r\nexpression of his years stamped upon his countenance, as he tripped\r\nlightly along the streets, avoiding equally the more public, and the too\r\nlow, thoroughfares.\r\n\r\nAs he was approaching the door of a large mansion, its mistress, a rich\r\nlady without children, saw him coming, and was struck with his beauty\r\nand sweetness, as, with arms folded on his breast, he was hastening on.\r\n"Stay one moment, dear child," she said, putting herself in his way;\r\n"tell me thy name, and where do thy parents live?"\r\n\r\n"I am Tarcisius, an orphan boy," he replied, looking up smilingly; "and\r\nI have no home, save one which it might be displeasing to thee to hear."\r\n\r\n"Then come into my house and rest; I wish to speak to thee. Oh, that I\r\nhad a child like thee!"\r\n\r\n"Not now, noble lady, not now. I have intrusted to me a most solemn and\r\nsacred duty, and I must not tarry a moment in its performance."\r\n\r\n"Then promise to come to me tomorrow; this is my house."\r\n\r\n"If I am alive, I will," answered the boy, with a kindled look, which\r\nmade him appear to her as a messenger from a higher sphere. She watched\r\nhim a long time, and after some deliberation determined to follow him.\r\nSoon, however, she heard a tumult with horrid cries, which made her\r\npause on her way until they had ceased, when she went on again.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, Tarcisius, with his thoughts fixed on better things\r\nthan her inheritance, hastened on, and shortly came into an open space,\r\nwhere boys, just escaped from school, were beginning to play.\r\n\r\n"We just want one to make up the game; where shall we get him?" said\r\ntheir leader.\r\n\r\n"Capital!" exclaimed another; "here comes Tarcisius, whom I have not\r\nseen for an age. He used to be an excellent hand at all sports. Come,\r\nTarcisius," he added, stopping him by seizing his arm, "whither so fast?\r\ntake a part in our game, that\'s a good fellow."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t now; I really can\'t. I am going on business of great\r\nimportance."\r\n\r\n"But you shall," exclaimed the first speaker, a strong and bullying\r\nyouth, laying hold of him. "I will have no sulking, when I want anything\r\ndone. So come, join us at once."\r\n\r\n"I entreat you," said the poor boy feelingly, "do let me go."\r\n\r\n"No such thing," replied the other. "What is that you seem to be\r\ncarrying so carefully in your bosom? A letter, I suppose; well, it will\r\nnot addle by being for half an hour out of its nest. Give it to me, and\r\nI will put it by safe while we play."\r\n\r\n"Never, never," answered the child, looking up towards heaven.\r\n\r\n"I _will_ see it," insisted the other rudely; "I will know what is this\r\nwonderful secret." And he commenced pulling him roughly about. A crowd\r\nof men from the neighborhood soon got round, and all asked eagerly what\r\nwas the matter. They saw a boy, who, with folded arms, seemed endowed\r\nwith a supernatural strength, as he resisted every effort of one much\r\nbigger and stronger, to make him reveal what he was bearing. Cuffs,\r\npulls, blows, kicks, seemed to have no effect. He bore them all without\r\na murmur, or an attempt to retaliate; but he unflinchingly kept his\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n"What is it? what can it be?" one began to ask the other; when Fulvius\r\nchanced to pass by, and joined the circle round the combatants. He at\r\nonce recognized Tarcisius, having seen him at the Ordination; and being\r\nasked, as a better-dressed man, the same question, he replied\r\ncontemptuously, as he turned on his heel, "What is it? Why, only a\r\nChristian, bearing the Mysteries."\r\n\r\nThis was enough. Heathen curiosity, to see the Mysteries of the\r\nChristians revealed, and to insult them, was aroused, and a general\r\ndemand was made to Tarcisius to yield up his charge. "Never with life,"\r\nwas his only reply. A heavy blow from a smith\'s fist nearly stunned him,\r\nwhile the blood flowed from the wound. Another and another followed,\r\ntill, covered with bruises, but with his arms crossed fast upon his\r\nbreast, he fell heavily on the ground. The mob closed upon him, and were\r\njust seizing, him to tear open his thrice-holy trust, when they felt\r\nthemselves pushed aside right and left by some giant strength. Some went\r\nreeling to the further side of the square, others were spun round and\r\nround, they knew not how, till they fell where they were, and the rest\r\nretired before a tall athletic officer, who was the author of this\r\noverthrow. He had no sooner cleared the ground than he was on his knees,\r\nand with tears in his eyes raised up the bruised and fainting boy as\r\ntenderly as a mother could have done, and in most gentle tones asked\r\nhim, "Are you much hurt, Tarcisius?"\r\n\r\n"Never mind me, Quadratus," answered he, opening his eyes with a smile;\r\n"but I am carrying the Divine Mysteries; take care of them."\r\n\r\nThe soldier raised the boy in his arms with tenfold reverence, as if\r\nbearing, not only the sweet victim of a youthful sacrifice, a martyr\'s\r\nrelics, but the very King and Lord of Martyrs, and the divine Victim of\r\neternal salvation. The child\'s head leaned in confidence on the stout\r\nsoldier\'s neck, but his arms and hands never left their watchful custody\r\nof the confided gift; and his gallant bearer felt no weight in the\r\nhallowed double burden which he carried. No one stopped him, till a lady\r\nmet him and stared amazedly at him. She drew nearer, and looked closer\r\nat what he carried. "Is it possible?" she exclaimed with terror, "is\r\nthat Tarcisius, whom I met a few moments ago, so fair and lovely?"\r\n\r\n"Madam," replied Quadratus, "they have murdered him because he was a\r\nChristian."\r\n\r\nThe lady looked for an instant on the child\'s countenance. He opened his\r\neyes upon her, smiled, and expired. From that look came the light of\r\nfaith--she hastened to be a Christian.\r\n\r\nThe venerable Dionysius could hardly see for weeping, as he removed the\r\nchild\'s hands, and took from his bosom, unviolated, the Holy of Holies;\r\nand he thought he looked more like an angel now, sleeping the martyr\'s\r\nslumber, than he did when living scarcely an hour before. Quadratus\r\nhimself bore him to the cemetery of Callistus, where he was buried\r\namidst the admiration of older believers; and later a holy Pope composed\r\nfor him an epitaph, which no one can read without concluding that the\r\nbelief in the real presence of Our Lord\'s Body in the Blessed Eucharist\r\nwas the same then as now:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n       "Christ\'s secret gifts, by good Tarcisius borne,\r\n         The mob profanely bade him to display;\r\n       He rather gave his own limbs to be torn,\r\n         Than Christ\'s Body to mad dogs betray."\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cardinal Wiseman._\r\n\r\nFrom "Fabiola; or, The Church of the Catacombs."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nADDLE, to become rotten, as eggs.\r\n\r\nTUNIC, a loose garment, reaching to the knees, and confined at the\r\nwaist by a girdle.\r\n\r\nSUPERNATURAL, = prefix _super_, meaning _above_ or _beyond,_ +\r\n_natural_.\r\n\r\n-ION, a suffix denoting _act, state, condition of_.

But, while Daffy-down-dilly was yet a\r\nlittle boy, his mother sent him away from his pleasant home, and put him\r\nunder the care of a very strict schoolmaster, who went by the name of\r\nMr. Toil. Those who knew him best, affirmed that this Mr. Toil was a\r\nvery worthy character, and that he had done more good, both to children\r\nand grown people, than anybody else in the world. Nevertheless, Mr. Toil\r\nhad a severe countenance; his voice, too, was harsh; and all his ways\r\nseemed very disagreeable to our friend Daffy-down-dilly.\r\n\r\nThe whole day long, this terrible old schoolmaster sat at his desk,\r\noverlooking the pupils, or stalked about the room with a certain awful\r\nbirch rod in his hand. Now came a rap over the shoulders of a boy whom\r\nMr. Toil had caught at play; now he punished a whole class who were\r\nbehindhand with their lessons; and, in short, unless a lad chose to\r\nattend constantly to his book, he had no chance of enjoying a quiet\r\nmoment in the schoolroom of Mr. Toil.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t bear it any longer," said Daffy-down-dilly to himself, when he\r\nhad been at school about a week. "I\'ll run away, and try to find my dear\r\nmother; at any rate, I shall never find anybody half so disagreeable as\r\nthis old Mr. Toil." So, the very next morning, off started poor\r\nDaffy-down-dilly, and began his rambles about the world, with only some\r\nbread and cheese for his breakfast, and very little pocket money to pay\r\nhis expenses. But he had gone only a short distance, when he overtook a\r\nman of grave and sedate appearance, who was trudging along the road at a\r\nmoderate pace.\r\n\r\n"Good-morning, my fine little lad," said the stranger; "whence do you\r\ncome so early, and whither are you going?" Daffy-down-dilly hesitated a\r\nmoment or two, but finally confessed that he had run away from school,\r\non account of his great dislike to Mr. Toil; and that he was resolved to\r\nfind some place in the world where he should never see nor hear of the\r\nold schoolmaster again. "Very well, my little friend," answered the\r\nstranger, "we will go together; for I, also, have had a great deal to do\r\nwith Mr. Toil, and should be glad to find some place where his name was\r\nnever heard."\r\n\r\nThey had not gone far, when they passed a field where some haymakers\r\nwere at work, mowing down the tall grass, and spreading it out in the\r\nsun to dry. Daffy-down-dilly was delighted with the sweet smell of the\r\nnew-mown grass, and thought how much pleasanter it must be to make hay\r\nin the sunshine, under the blue sky, and with the birds singing sweetly\r\nin the neighboring trees and bushes, than to be shut up in a dismal\r\nschoolroom, learning lessons all day long, and continually scolded by\r\nMr. Toil.\r\n\r\nBut, in the midst of these thoughts, while he was stopping to peep over\r\nthe stone wall, he started back, caught hold of his companion\'s hand,\r\nand cried, "Quick, quick! Let us run away, or he will catch us!"\r\n\r\n"Who will catch us?" asked the stranger.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Toil, the old schoolmaster!" answered Daffy-down-dilly. "Don\'t you\r\nsee him among the haymakers?"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t be afraid," said the stranger. "This is not Mr. Toil, the\r\nschoolmaster, but a brother of his, who was bred a farmer; and people\r\nsay he is the more disagreeable man of the two. However, he won\'t\r\ntrouble you, unless you become a laborer on the farm."\r\n\r\nThey went on a little farther, and soon heard the sound of a drum and\r\nfife. Daffy-down-dilly besought his companion to hurry forward, that\r\nthey might not miss seeing the soldiers.\r\n\r\n"Quick step! Forward march!" shouted a gruff voice.\r\n\r\nLittle Daffy-down-dilly started in great dismay; and, turning his eyes\r\nto the captain of the company, what should he see but the very image of\r\nold Mr. Toil himself, with a smart cap and feather on his head, a pair\r\nof gold epaulets on his shoulders, a laced coat on his back, a purple\r\nsash round his waist, and a long sword, instead of a birch rod, in his\r\nhand! Though he held his head high and strutted like a rooster, still he\r\nlooked quite as ugly and disagreeable as when he was hearing lessons in\r\nthe schoolroom.\r\n\r\n"This is certainly old Mr. Toil," said Daffy-down-dilly, in a trembling\r\nvoice. "Let us run away, for fear he will make us enlist in his\r\ncompany!"\r\n\r\n"You are mistaken again, my little friend," replied the stranger, very\r\ncomposedly. "This is not Mr. Toil, the schoolmaster, but a brother of\r\nhis, who has served in the army all his life. People say he\'s a very\r\nsevere fellow, but you and I need not be afraid of him."\r\n\r\n"Well, well," said Daffy-down-dilly, "but, if you please, sir, I don\'t\r\nwant to see the soldiers any more."\r\n\r\nSo the child and the stranger resumed their journey; and, by and by,\r\nthey came to a house by the roadside, where some people were making\r\nmerry. Young men and rosy-cheeked girls, with smiles on their faces,\r\nwere dancing to the sound of a fiddle.\r\n\r\n"Let us stop here," cried Daffy-down-dilly to his companion; "for Mr.\r\nToil will never dare to show his face where there is a fiddler, and\r\nwhere people are dancing and making merry. We shall be quite safe here."\r\n\r\nBut these last words died away upon Daffy-down-dilly\'s tongue, for,\r\nhappening to cast his eyes on the fiddler, whom should he behold again,\r\nbut the likeness of Mr. Toil, holding a fiddle bow instead of a birch\r\nrod.\r\n\r\n"Oh, dear!" whispered he, turning pale, "it seems as if there was nobody\r\nbut Mr. Toil in the world. Who could have thought of his playing on a\r\nfiddle!"\r\n\r\n"This is not your old schoolmaster," said the stranger, "but another\r\nbrother of his, who was bred in France, where he learned the profession\r\nof a fiddler. He is ashamed of his family, and generally calls himself\r\nMr. Pleasure; but his real name is Toil, and those who have known him\r\nbest, think him still more disagreeable than his brother."\r\n\r\n"Pray let us go a little farther," said Daffy-down-dilly. "I don\'t like\r\nthe looks of this fiddler."\r\n\r\nThus the stranger and little Daffy-down-dilly went wandering along the\r\nhighway, and in shady lanes, and through pleasant villages; and,\r\nwhithersoever they went, behold! there was the image of old Mr. Toil.\r\n\r\nHe stood like a scarecrow in the cornfields. If they entered a house, he\r\nsat in the parlor; if they peeped into the kitchen, he was there. He\r\nmade himself at home in every cottage, and, under one disguise or\r\nanother, stole into the most splendid mansions.\r\n\r\n"Oh, take me back!--take me back!" said poor little Daffy-down-dilly,\r\nbursting into tears. "If there is nothing but Toil all the world over, I\r\nmay just as well go back to the schoolhouse."\r\n\r\n"Yonder it is,--there is the schoolhouse!" said the stranger; for,\r\nthough he and little Daffy-down-dilly had taken a great many steps, they\r\nhad traveled in a circle, instead of a straight line. "Come; we will go\r\nback to school together."\r\n\r\nThere was something in his companion\'s voice that little\r\nDaffy-down-dilly now remembered; and it is strange that he had not\r\nremembered it sooner. Looking up into his face, behold! there again was\r\nthe likeness of old Mr. Toil; so the poor child had been in company with\r\nToil all day, even while he was doing his best to run away from him.\r\n\r\nWhen Daffy-down-dilly became better acquainted with Mr. Toil, he began\r\nto think that his ways were not so very disagreeable, and that the old\r\nschoolmaster\'s smile of approbation made his face almost as pleasant as\r\nthe face of his own dear mother.\r\n\r\n_Nathaniel Hawthorne._\r\n\r\n\r\n"Little Daffy-down-dilly and Other Stories."

I will try to recall\r\none," said Frank.\r\n\r\n"Let me see. Well--perhaps--I think that the most wonderful story I have\r\never read is that of the solar system, or the sun\'s family."\r\n\r\n"Solar system!" repeated Philip. "That certainly sounds hard enough to\r\npuzzle even a fairy. Please tell me all about it."\r\n\r\n"That I should find much too hard" answered Frank. "But I\'ll try to tell\r\nyou what little I know. You see the sun there, don\'t you--the great\r\nshining sun? Do you think the sun moves?"\r\n\r\n"Of course it moves," said Philip. "I always see it in the morning when\r\nI am in the garden. It rises first above the bushes, then over the trees\r\nand houses; by evening it has traveled across the sky, when it sinks\r\nbelow the houses and trees, out of sight on the other side of the town."\r\n\r\n"Now that is quite a mistake," said Frank, "You think that the sun is\r\ntraveling all that way along the sky, whereas it is really we--we on\r\nthis big ball of earth--who are moving. We are whirling around on the\r\nouter surface, rushing on at the rate--let me think--at the rate of more\r\nthan one thousand miles a minute!"\r\n\r\n"Frank, what do you mean?" cried Philip.\r\n\r\n"I mean that the earth is moving many times faster than a ball moves\r\nwhen shot from the mouth of a cannon!"\r\n\r\n"Do you expect me to believe that, Frank! I can hardly believe that this\r\nbig, solid earth moves at all; but to think of it with all the cities,\r\ntowns, and people whirling round and round faster than a ball from the\r\nmouth of a cannon, while we never feel that it stirs one inch,--this is\r\nmuch harder to believe than all that the fairies have ever told us."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but it is quite true for all that," replied Frank.\r\n\r\n"I have learned much about the motions of the planets, and viewed the\r\nstars one night through a telescope. As I looked through this\r\ninstrument, the stars appeared to me much larger than ever before. The\r\nearth is a planet, and there are besides our earth seven large planets\r\nand many small ones, which also whirl around the sun. Some of these\r\nplanets are larger than our world. Some of them also move much faster.\r\n\r\n"The sun is in the middle with the planets moving around him. The one\r\nnearest to the sun is Mercury."\r\n\r\n"It must be hot there!" cried Philip.\r\n\r\n"I dare say that if we were in Mercury we should be scorched to ashes;\r\nbut if creatures live on that planet, God has given them a different\r\nnature from ours, so that they may enjoy what would be dreadful to us.\r\n\r\n"The next planet to Mercury is Venus. Venus is sometimes seen shining so\r\nbright after sunset; then she is called the evening star. Some of the\r\ntime, a little before sunrise, she may be seen in the east; she is then\r\ncalled the morning star.\r\n\r\n"Venus can never be an evening star and a morning star at the same time\r\nof the year. If you are watching her this evening before or after\r\nsundown, there is no use getting up early to-morrow to look for her\r\nagain. For several weeks Venus remains an evening star, then gradually\r\ndisappears. Two months later you may see her in the east--a bright\r\nmorning star.\r\n\r\n"Our earth is the third planet, and Mars is the fourth from the sun. Now\r\nlet us make a drawing of what we have been talking about.\r\n\r\n"First open the compasses one inch; describe a circle, and make a dot on\r\nits circumference, naming it Mercury. Write on this circle eighty-eight\r\ndays; this shows the time it takes Mercury to travel around the sun.\r\nMake another circle three and one-half inches in diameter and make a dot\r\non it. This represents Venus. It takes Venus two hundred twenty-five\r\ndays to journey around the sun.\r\n\r\n"The next circle we have to draw is a very interesting one to us. The\r\ncompasses must be opened two and one-half inches. The path made\r\nrepresents the journey we take in three hundred sixty-five days.\r\n\r\n"One more circle must be drawn to complete our little plan. This circle\r\nmust be eight inches in diameter. You see Mars is much farther from the\r\nsun than our earth is. It takes him six hundred eighty-seven days to\r\nmake the trip around the sun. The other planets are too far away to be\r\nput in this plan."\r\n\r\n"O, Frank, you have missed the biggest of all--the moon!" said Philip.\r\n\r\n"O, no, no!" exclaimed Frank. "The moon is quite a little ball. It is\r\nless than seven thousand miles around her, while our earth is\r\ntwenty-five thousand miles around."\r\n\r\n"Is that a little ball, Frank?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, compared with the sun and the planets. The moon is what is called\r\na satellite--that is, a servant or an attendant. She is a satellite of\r\nour earth. She keeps circling round and round our earth, while we go\r\ncircling round and round the sun.\r\n\r\n"How fast the moon must travel! If I were to go rushing round a field,\r\nand a bird should keep flying around my head, you see that the movements\r\nof the bird would be much quicker than mine."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t understand it, Frank," said Philip. "The moon always looks so\r\nquiet in the sky. If she is darting about like lightning, why is it that\r\nshe scarcely seems to move more than an inch in ten minutes?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose," said Frank, after a thoughtful silence, "that what to us\r\nseems an inch in the sky is really many miles. You know how very fast\r\nthe steam cars seem to go when one is quite near them, yet I have seen a\r\ntrain of cars far off which seemed to go so slowly that I could fancy it\r\nwas painted on the sky."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that must be the reason; but how do people find out these curious\r\nthings about the sun and the stars--to know how large they are and how\r\nfast they go?" asked Philip.\r\n\r\n"That is something we shall understand when we are older," said Frank.\r\n"We must gain a little knowledge every day."\r\n\r\n"Is the earth the only planet that has a moon?" asked Philip.\r\n\r\n"Mercury and Venus have no moons. Mars has two, and Jupiter has four,\r\nbut we can see them only when we look through a telescope." replied\r\nFrank.\r\n\r\n"Are all the twinkling stars which one sees on a fine clear night,\r\nplanets?" inquired Philip.\r\n\r\n"Those that twinkle are not planets; they are fixed stars," said Frank.\r\n"A planet does not twinkle. It has no light of its own. It shines just\r\nas the moon shines, because the sun gives it light."\r\n\r\n"But our earth does not shine!" said Philip.\r\n\r\n"Indeed it does," explained Frank. "Our earth appears to Venus and Mars\r\nas a shining planet."\r\n\r\n"There must be many more fixed stars than planets, then, for almost\r\nevery star that I can see twinkles and sparkles like a diamond. Do these\r\nfixed stars all go around the sun?" asked Philip.\r\n\r\n"O, Philip! haven\'t you noticed that they are called fixed stars to show\r\nthat they do not move like planets? The word _planet_ means to _wander._\r\nThese fixed stars are suns themselves, which may have planets of their\r\nown. They are so very far away that we cannot know much about them,\r\nexcept that they shine of themselves just as our sun does.\r\n\r\n"We know that our sun gives light and heat to the planets and satellites\r\nwith which he is surrounded. We know that without his warm rays there\r\nwould not be any flowers or birds or any living thing on the earth. So\r\nwe can easily imagine that all other suns are shining in the same way\r\nfor the worlds that surround them."\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nMake a drawing of the sun and the three planets nearest it, as directed\r\nin the lesson.\r\n\r\nFill each blank space in the following sentences with the correct form\r\nof the action-word _draw_:\r\n\r\n\r\nMy boys like to --.\r\n\r\nYesterday they -- the picture of an old mill.\r\n\r\nThey are now -- a picture of the solar system.\r\n\r\nThe lines on the blackboard were -- by John.\r\nHe -- well.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_65_\r\n\r\n\r\ndew\' y\r\nclos\'es\r\nca ress\'\r\ntwined\r\nwreaths\r\nweath\'er\r\nbrook\' let\r\ntogeth\'er\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWILL AND I\r\n\r\n\r\n       We roam the hills together,\r\n       In the golden summer weather,\r\n                 Will and I;\r\n       And the glowing sunbeams bless us,\r\n       And the winds of heaven caress us,\r\n         As we wander hand in hand\r\n         Through the blissful summer land,\r\n                 Will and I.\r\n\r\n       Where the tinkling brooklet passes\r\n       Through the heart of dewy grasses,\r\n                 Will and I\r\n       Have heard the mock-bird singing,\r\n       And the field lark seen upspringing,\r\n         In his happy flight afar,\r\n         Like a tiny winged star--\r\n                 Will and I.\r\n\r\n       Amid cool forest closes,\r\n       We have plucked the wild wood-roses,\r\n                 Will and I;\r\n       And have twined, with tender duty,\r\n       Sweet wreaths to crown the beauty\r\n         Of the purest brows that shine\r\n         With a mother-love divine,\r\n                 Will and I.\r\n\r\n       Ah! thus we roam together,\r\n       Through the golden summer weather,\r\n                 Will and I;\r\n       While the glowing sunbeams bless us,\r\n       And the winds of heaven caress us,\r\n         As we wander hand in hand\r\n         O\'er the blissful summer land,\r\n                 Will and I.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Paul H.

And now\r\ntwo smaller Cratchits, boy and girl, came tearing in, screaming that\r\noutside the baker\'s they had smelt the goose, and known it for their\r\nown; and, basking in luxurious thoughts of sage and onions, they danced\r\nabout the table, and exalted Master Peter Cratchit to the skies, while\r\nhe (not proud, although his collar nearly choked him) blew the fire,\r\nuntil the potatoes, bubbling up, knocked loudly at the saucepan-lid to\r\nbe let out and peeled.\r\n\r\n"What has ever kept your precious father, then?" said Mrs. Cratchit.\r\n"And your brother, Tiny Tim? And Martha wasn\'t as late last Christmas\r\nDay by half an hour!"\r\n\r\n"Here\'s Martha, mother!" cried the two young Cratchits. "Hurrah! There\'s\r\n_such_ a goose, Martha!"\r\n\r\n"Why, bless your heart alive, my dear, how late you are!" said Mrs.\r\nCratchit, kissing her a dozen times, and taking off her shawl and bonnet\r\nfor her with officious zeal.\r\n\r\n"We\'d a deal of work to finish up last night, and had to clear away this\r\nmorning, mother!"\r\n\r\n"Well, never mind so long as you are come," said Mrs. Cratchit. "Sit ye\r\ndown before the fire, my dear, and have a warm, Lord bless ye!"\r\n\r\n"No, no! There\'s father coming," cried the two young Cratchits, who were\r\neverywhere at once. "Hide, Martha, hide!"\r\n\r\nSo Martha hid herself, and in came the father, with at least three feet\r\nof comforter, exclusive of the fringe, hanging down before him; and his\r\nthreadbare clothes darned up and brushed, to look seasonable; and Tiny\r\nTim upon his shoulder. Alas for Tiny Tim, he bore a little crutch, and\r\nhad his limb supported by an iron frame.\r\n\r\n"Why, where\'s our Martha?" cried Bob Cratchit, looking round.\r\n\r\n"Not coming," said Mrs. Cratchit.\r\n\r\n"Not coming!" said Bob, with a sudden declension in his high spirits;\r\nfor he had been Tim\'s blood-horse all the way from church, and had come\r\nhome rampant. "Not coming upon Christmas Day!"\r\n\r\nMartha didn\'t like to see him disappointed, if it were only in joke; so\r\nshe came out prematurely from behind the closet door, and ran into his\r\narms, while the two young Cratchits hustled Tiny Tim, and bore him off\r\nto the wash-house, that he might hear the pudding singing in the copper.\r\n\r\n"And how did little Tim behave?" asked Mrs. Cratchit, when she had\r\nrallied Bob on his credulity, and Bob had hugged his daughter to his\r\nheart\'s content.\r\n\r\n"As good as gold," said Bob, "and better. Somehow he gets thoughtful,\r\nsitting by himself so much, and thinks the strangest things you ever\r\nheard. He told me, coming home, that he hoped the people saw him in the\r\nchurch, because he was a cripple, and it might be pleasant to them to\r\nremember, upon Christmas Day, who made lame beggars walk and blind men\r\nsee."\r\n\r\nBob\'s voice was tremulous when he told them this, and trembled more when\r\nhe said that Tiny Tim was growing strong and hearty.\r\n\r\nHis active little crutch was heard upon the floor, and back came Tiny\r\nTim before another word was spoken, escorted by his brother and sister\r\nto his stool beside the fire; and while Bob compounded some hot mixture\r\nin a jug, and put it on the hob to simmer, Master Peter and the two\r\nubiquitous young Cratchits went to fetch the goose, with which they soon\r\nreturned in high procession.\r\n\r\nSuch a bustle ensued that you might have thought a goose the rarest of\r\nall birds; a feathered phenomenon, to which a black swan was a matter of\r\ncourse--and in truth it was something very like it in that house. Mrs.\r\nCratchit made the gravy hissing hot; Master Peter mashed the potatoes\r\nwith incredible vigor; Miss Belinda sweetened up the apple sauce; Martha\r\ndusted the hot plates; Bob took Tiny Tim beside him in a tiny corner at\r\nthe table; the two young Cratchits set chairs for everybody, not\r\nforgetting themselves, and, mounting guard upon their posts, crammed\r\nspoons into their mouths, lest they should shriek for goose before their\r\nturn came to be helped. At last the dishes were set on, and grace was\r\nsaid. It was succeeded by a breathless pause, as Mrs. Cratchit, looking\r\nslowly all along the carving knife, prepared to plunge it in the breast;\r\nbut when she did, and when the long-expected gush of stuffing issued\r\nforth, one murmur of delight arose all round the board, and even Tiny\r\nTim, excited by the two young Cratchits, beat on the table with the\r\nhandle of his knife, and feebly cried Hurrah!\r\n\r\nBob said he didn\'t believe there ever was such a goose cooked. Its\r\ntenderness and flavor, size and cheapness, were the themes of universal\r\nadmiration. Eked out by apple sauce and mashed potatoes, it was a\r\nsufficient dinner for the whole family; indeed, as Mrs. Cratchit said\r\nwith great delight (surveying one small atom of a bone upon the dish),\r\nthey hadn\'t eaten it all at last! Yet every one had had enough, and the\r\nyoungest Cratchits in particular were steeped in sage and onion to the\r\neyebrows! But now, the plates being changed by Miss Belinda, Mrs.\r\nCratchit left the room alone--too nervous to bear witnesses--to take the\r\npudding up and bring it in.\r\n\r\nSuppose it should not be done enough! Suppose it should break in turning\r\nout! Suppose somebody should have got over the wall of the backyard and\r\nstolen it, while they were merry with the goose--a supposition at which\r\nthe two young Cratchits became livid. All sorts of horrors were\r\nsupposed.\r\n\r\nHalloa! A great deal of steam! The pudding was out of the copper. A\r\nsmell like a washing day! That was the cloth. A smell like an eating\r\nhouse and a pastry cook\'s next door to each other, with a laundress\'s\r\nnext door to that! That was the pudding! In half a minute Mrs. Cratchit\r\nentered--flushed, but smiling proudly--with the pudding like a speckled\r\ncannon ball, so hard and firm, smoking hot, and bedight with Christmas\r\nholly stuck into the top.\r\n\r\nOh, a wonderful pudding! Bob Cratchit said, and calmly too, that he\r\nregarded it as the greatest success achieved by Mrs. Cratchit since\r\ntheir marriage. Mrs. Cratchit said that, now the weight was off her\r\nmind, she would confess she had her doubts about the quantity of flour.\r\nEverybody had something to say about it, but nobody said or thought it\r\nwas at all a small pudding for so large a family. It would have been\r\nflat heresy to do so. Any Cratchit would have blushed to hint at such a\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nAt last the dinner was all done, the cloth was cleared, the hearth\r\nswept, and the fire made up. The compound in the jug being tasted, and\r\nconsidered perfect, apples and oranges were put upon the table, and a\r\nshovelful of chestnuts on the fire. Then all the Cratchit family drew\r\nround the hearth in what Bob Cratchit called a circle, meaning half a\r\none; and at Bob Cratchit\'s elbow stood the family display of glass,--two\r\ntumblers and a custard cup without a handle.\r\n\r\nThese held the hot stuff from the jug, however, as well as golden\r\ngoblets would have done; and Bob served it out with beaming looks, while\r\nthe chestnuts on the fire sputtered and cracked noisily. Then Bob\r\nproposed: "A Merry Christmas to us all, my dears. God bless us!"\r\n\r\nWhich all the family re[:e]choed.\r\n\r\n"God bless us every one!" said Tiny Tim, the last of all.\r\n\r\nHe sat very close to his father\'s side, upon his little stool. Bob held\r\nhis withered little hand in his, as if he loved the child, and wished to\r\nkeep him by his side, and dreaded that he might be taken from him.\r\n\r\n_Charles Dickens._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Portrait of Dickens.]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDECLENSION, a falling downward.\r\n\r\nCOPPER, a boiler made of copper.\r\n\r\nRALLIED, indulged in pleasant humor.\r\n\r\nUBIQUITOUS (u b[)i]k\' w[)i] t[)u]s), appearing to be everywhere at\r\nthe same time.\r\n\r\nEKED OUT, added to; increased.\r\n\r\nBEDIGHT, bedecked; adorned.\r\n\r\nRE[:E]CHOED (re\xc3\xabchoed): What is the mark placed over the second _\xc3\xab_ called,\r\nand what does it denote?\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.--"A Christmas Carol," from which the selection is taken, is\r\nconsidered the best short story that Dickens wrote, and one of the best\r\nChristmas stories ever written.

Which shall it be?\r\n       I looked at John, John looked at me;\r\n       And when I found that I must speak,\r\n       My voice seemed strangely low and weak:\r\n       "Tell me again what Robert said,"\r\n       And then I, listening, bent my head--\r\n       This is his letter: "I will give\r\n       A house and land while you shall live,\r\n       If in return from out your seven\r\n       One child to me for aye is given."\r\n\r\n       I looked at John\'s old garments worn;\r\n       I thought of all that he had borne\r\n       Of poverty, and work, and care,\r\n       Which I, though willing, could not share;\r\n       I thought of seven young mouths to feed,\r\n       Of seven little children\'s need,\r\n             And then of this.\r\n\r\n             "Come, John," said I,\r\n       "We\'ll choose among them as they lie\r\n       Asleep."  So, walking hand in hand,\r\n       Dear John and I surveyed our band:\r\n       First to the cradle lightly stepped,\r\n       Where Lilian, the baby, slept.\r\n       Softly the father stooped to lay\r\n       His rough hand down in loving way,\r\n       When dream or whisper made her stir,\r\n       And huskily he said: "Not her!"\r\n\r\n       We stooped beside the trundle-bed,\r\n       And one long ray of lamplight shed\r\n       Athwart the boyish faces there,\r\n       In sleep so pitiful and fair;\r\n       I saw on Jamie\'s rough, red cheek\r\n       A tear undried. Ere John could speak,\r\n       "He\'s but a baby too," said I,\r\n       And kissed him as we hurried by.\r\n       Pale, patient Robbie\'s angel face\r\n       Still in his sleep bore suffering\'s trace--\r\n       "No, for a thousand crowns, not him!"\r\n       He whispered, while our eyes were dim.\r\n\r\n       Poor Dick! bad Dick, our wayward son--\r\n       Turbulent, restless, idle one--\r\n       Could he be spared? Nay, He who gave\r\n       Bade us befriend him to the grave;\r\n       Only a mother\'s heart could be\r\n       Patient enough for such as he;\r\n       "And so," said John, "I would not dare\r\n       To take him from her bedside prayer."\r\n\r\n       Then stole we softly up above,\r\n       And knelt by Mary, child of love;\r\n       "Perhaps for her \'twould better be,"\r\n       I said to John. Quite silently\r\n       He lifted up a curl that lay\r\n       Across her cheek in wilful way,\r\n       And shook his head: "Nay, love, not thee,"\r\n       The while my heart beat audibly.\r\n\r\n       Only one more, our eldest lad,\r\n       Trusty and truthful, good and glad,\r\n       So like his father.

DOROTHY, MARTYR\r\n\r\n\r\nThe names of St. Catherine and St. Agnes, St. Lucy and St. Cecilia, are\r\nfamiliar to us all; and to many of us, no doubt, their histories are\r\nwell known also. Young as they were, they despised alike the pleasures\r\nand the flatteries of the world. They chose God alone as their portion\r\nand inheritance; and He has highly exalted them, and placed their names\r\namongst those glorious martyrs whose memory is daily honored in the holy\r\nSacrifice of the Mass.\r\n\r\nSt. Dorothy was another of these virgin saints. She was born in the city\r\nof C\xc3\xa6sarea, and was descended of a rich and noble family. While the last\r\nof the ten terrible persecutions, which for three hundred years steeped\r\nthe Church in the blood of martyrs, was raging, Dorothy embraced the\r\nfaith of Christ, and, in consequence, was seized and carried before the\r\nRoman Prefect of the city.\r\n\r\nShe was put to the most cruel tortures, and, at length, condemned to\r\ndeath. When the executioners were preparing to behead her, the Prefect\r\nsaid, "Now, at least, confess your folly, and pray to the immortal gods\r\nfor pardon."\r\n\r\n"I pray," replied the martyr, "that the God of heaven and earth may\r\npardon and have mercy on you; and I will also pray when I reach the land\r\nwhither I am going."\r\n\r\n"Of what land do you speak?" asked the judge, who, like most of the\r\npagans, had very little notion of another world.\r\n\r\n"I speak of that land where Christ, the Son of God, dwells with his\r\nsaints," replied St. Dorothy. "_There_ is neither night nor sorrow;\r\n_there_ is the river of life, and the brightness of eternal glory; and\r\n_there_ is a paradise of all delight, and flowers that shall never\r\nfade."\r\n\r\n"I pray you, then," said a young man, named Theophilus, who was\r\nlistening to her words with pity mingled with wonder, "if these things\r\nbe so, to send me some of those flowers, when you shall have reached the\r\nland you speak of."\r\n\r\nDorothy looked at him as he spoke; and then answered: "Theophilus, you\r\nshall have the sign you ask for." There was no time for more; the\r\nexecutioner placed her before the block, and, in another moment, with\r\none blow, he struck off the head of the holy martyr.\r\n\r\n"Those were strange words," said Theophilus to one of his friends, as\r\nthey were about to leave the court; "but these Christians are not like\r\nother people." "Their obstinacy is altogether surprising," rejoined his\r\nfriend; "death itself will never make them waver. But who is this,\r\nTheophilus?" he continued, as a young boy came up to them, of such\r\nsingular beauty that the eyes of all were fixed upon him with wonder and\r\nadmiration. He seemed not more than ten years old; his golden hair fell\r\non his shoulders, and in his hand he bore four roses, two white and two\r\nred, and of so brilliant a color and rich a fragrance that their like\r\nhad never before been seen. He held them out to Theophilus. "These\r\nflowers are for you," said he; "will you not take them?" "And whence do\r\nyou bring them, my boy?" asked Theophilus. "From Dorothy," he replied,\r\n"and they are the sign you even now asked for." "Roses, and in winter\r\ntime!" said Theophilus, as he took the flowers; "yea, and such roses as\r\nnever blossomed in any earthly garden. Prefect, your task is not yet\r\nended; your sword has slain one Christian, but it has made another; I,\r\ntoo, profess the faith for which Dorothy died."\r\n\r\nWithin another hour, Theophilus was condemned to death by the enraged\r\nPrefect; and on the spot where Dorothy had been beheaded, he too poured\r\nforth his blood, and obtained the crown of martyrdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nC\xc3\x86SAREA (s[)e]s [.a] r[=e]\' [.a]), an ancient city of Palestine.

What will the\r\nnext thing be? It is wonderful!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, certainly," said the Inkstand. "It\'s extraordinary--that\'s what I\r\nalways say," he exclaimed to the pen and to the other articles on the\r\ntable that were near enough to hear. "It is wonderful what a number of\r\nthings can come out of me. It\'s quite incredible. And I really don\'t\r\nmyself know what will be the next thing, when that man begins to dip\r\ninto me. One drop out of me is enough for half a page of paper; and what\r\ncannot be contained in half a page?\r\n\r\n"From me all the works of the poet go forth--all these living men, whom\r\npeople can imagine they have met--all the deep feeling, the humor, the\r\nvivid pictures of nature. I myself don\'t understand how it is, for I am\r\nnot acquainted with nature, but it certainly is in me. From me all\r\nthings have gone forth, and from me proceed the troops of charming\r\nmaidens, and of brave knights on prancing steeds, and all the lame and\r\nthe blind, and I don\'t know what more--I assure you I don\'t think of\r\nanything."\r\n\r\n"There you are right," said the Pen; "you don\'t think at all; for if you\r\ndid, you would comprehend that you only furnish the fluid. You give the\r\nfluid, that I may exhibit upon the paper what dwells in me, and what I\r\nwould bring to the day. It is the pen that writes. No man doubts that;\r\nand, indeed, most people have about as much insight into poetry as an\r\nold inkstand."\r\n\r\n"You have but little experience," replied the Inkstand. "You\'ve hardly\r\nbeen in service a week, and are already half worn out. Do you fancy you\r\nare the poet? You are only a servant; and before you came I had many of\r\nyour sorts, some of the goose family, and others of English manufacture.\r\nI know the quill as well as the steel pen. Many have been in my service,\r\nand I shall have many more when _he_ comes--the man who goes through the\r\nmotions for me, and writes down what he derives from me. I should like\r\nto know what will be the next thing he\'ll take out of me."\r\n\r\n"Inkpot!" exclaimed the Pen.\r\n\r\nLate in the evening the poet came home. He had been to a concert, where\r\nhe had heard a famous violinist, with whose admirable performances he\r\nwas quite enchanted. The player had drawn a wonderful wealth of tone\r\nfrom the instrument; sometimes it had sounded like tinkling water-drops,\r\nlike rolling pearls, sometimes like birds twittering in chorus, and then\r\nagain it went swelling on like the wind through the fir trees.\r\n\r\nThe poet thought he heard his own heart weeping, but weeping\r\nmelodiously, like the sound of woman\'s voice. It seemed as though not\r\nonly the strings sounded, but every part of the instrument.\r\n\r\nIt was a wonderful performance; and difficult as the piece was, the bow\r\nseemed to glide easily to and fro over the strings, and it looked as\r\nthough every one might do it. The violin seemed to sound of itself, and\r\nthe bow to move of itself--those two appeared to do everything; and the\r\naudience forgot the master who guided them and breathed soul and spirit\r\ninto them. The master was forgotten; but the poet remembered him, and\r\nnamed him, and wrote down his thoughts concerning the subject:\r\n\r\n"How foolish it would be of the violin and the bow to boast of their\r\nachievements. And yet we men often commit this folly--the poet, the\r\nartist, the laborer in the domain of science, the general--we all do it.\r\nWe are only the instruments which the Almighty uses: to Him alone be the\r\nhonor! We have nothing of which we should be proud."\r\n\r\nYes, that is what the poet wrote down. He wrote it in the form of a\r\nparable, which he called "The Master and the Instrument."\r\n\r\n"That is what you get, madam," said the Pen to the Inkstand, when the\r\ntwo were alone again. "Did you not hear him read aloud what I have\r\nwritten down?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, what I gave you to write," retorted the Inkstand. "That was a cut\r\nat you, because of your conceit. That you should not even have\r\nunderstood that you were being quizzed! I gave you a cut from within\r\nme--surely I must know my own satire!"\r\n\r\n"Ink-pipkin!" cried the Pen.\r\n\r\n"Writing-stick!" cried the Inkstand.\r\n\r\nAnd each of them felt a conviction that he had answered well; and it is\r\na pleasing conviction to feel that one has given a good answer--a\r\nconviction on which one can sleep; and accordingly they slept upon it.\r\nBut the poet did not sleep. Thoughts welled up from within him, like the\r\ntones from the violin, falling like pearls, rushing like the storm-wind\r\nthrough the forests. He understood his own heart in these thoughts, and\r\ncaught a ray from the Eternal Master.

There were\r\nnot many pictures for him to look at, for he lived long ago near a great\r\nAmerican forest. His father and mother had come from England, but his\r\nfather was dead now. His mother was very poor, but there were still a\r\nfew beautiful pictures on the walls of her house.\r\n\r\nThe little boy liked to copy these pictures; but as he was not fond of\r\nwork, he often threw his drawings away before they were half done. He\r\nsaid that he wished that some good fairy would finish them for him.\r\n\r\n"Child," said his mother, "I don\'t believe that there are any fairies. I\r\nnever saw one, and your father never saw one. Mind your books, my child,\r\nand never mind the fairies."\r\n\r\n"Very well, mother," said the boy.\r\n\r\n"It makes me sad to see you stand looking at the pictures," said his\r\nmother another day, as she laid her hand on his curly head. "Why, child,\r\npictures can\'t feed a body, pictures can\'t clothe a body, and a log of\r\nwood is far better to burn and warm a body."\r\n\r\n"All that is quite true, mother," said the boy.\r\n\r\n"Then why do you keep looking at them, child?" but the boy could only\r\nsay, "I don\'t know, mother."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t know! Nor I, neither! Why, child, you look at the dumb things\r\nas if you loved them! Put on your cap and run out to play."\r\n\r\nSo the boy wandered off into the forest till he came to the brink of a\r\nlittle sheet of water. It was too small to be called a lake; but it was\r\ndeep and clear, and was overhung with tall trees. It was evening, and\r\nthe sun was getting low. The boy stood still beside the water and\r\nthought how beautiful it was to see the sun, red and glorious, between\r\nthe black trunks of the pine trees. Then he looked up at the great blue\r\nsky and thought how beautiful it was to see the little clouds folding\r\nover one another like a belt of rose-colored waves. Then he looked at\r\nthe lake and saw the clouds and the sky and the trees all reflected\r\nthere, down among the lilies.\r\n\r\nAnd he wished that he were a painter, for he said to himself, "I am sure\r\nthere are no trees in the world with such beautiful leaves as these\r\npines. I am sure there are no clouds in the world so lovely as these. I\r\nknow this is the prettiest little lake in the world, and if I could\r\npaint it, every one else would know it, too."\r\n\r\nBut he had nothing to paint with. So he picked a lily and sat down with\r\nit in his hand and tried very hard to make a correct drawing of it. But\r\nhe could not make a very good picture. At last he threw down his drawing\r\nand said to the lily:\r\n\r\n"You are too beautiful to draw with a pencil. How I wish I were a\r\npainter!"\r\n\r\nAs he said these words he felt the flower move. He looked, and the\r\ncluster of stamens at the bottom of the lily-cup glittered like a crown\r\nof gold. The dewdrops which hung upon the stamens changed to diamonds\r\nbefore his eyes. The white petals flowed together, and the next moment a\r\nbeautiful little fairy stood on his hand. She was no taller than the\r\nlily from which she came, and she was dressed in a robe of the purest\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\n"Child, are you happy?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"No," said the boy in a low voice, "because I want to paint and I\r\ncannot."\r\n\r\n"How do you know that you cannot?" asked the fairy.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I have tried a great many times. It is of no use to try any more."\r\n\r\n"But I will help you."\r\n\r\n"Oh," said the boy. "Then I might succeed."\r\n\r\n"I heard your wish, and I am willing to help you," said the fairy. "I\r\nknow a charm which will give you success. But you must do exactly as I\r\ntell you. Do you promise to obey?"\r\n\r\n"Spirit of a water lily!" said the boy, "I promise with all my heart."\r\n\r\n"Go home, then," said the fairy, "and you will find a little key on the\r\ndoorstep. Take it up and carry it to the nearest pine tree; strike the\r\ntrunk with it, and a keyhole will appear. Do not be afraid to unlock the\r\ndoor. Slip in your hand, and you will bring out a magic palette. You\r\nmust be very careful to paint with colors from that palette every day.\r\nOn this depends the success of the charm. You will find that it will\r\nmake your pictures beautiful and full of grace.\r\n\r\n"If you do not break the spell, I promise you that in a few years you\r\nshall be able to paint this lily so well that you will be satisfied; and\r\nthat you shall become a truly great painter."\r\n\r\n"Can it be possible?" said the boy. And the hand on which the fairy\r\nstood trembled for joy.\r\n\r\n"It shall be so, if only you do not break the charm," said the fairy.\r\n"But lest you forget what you owe to me, and as you grow older even\r\nbegin to doubt that you have ever seen me, the lily you gathered to-day\r\nwill never fade till my promise is fulfilled."\r\n\r\nThe boy raised his eyes, and when he looked again there was nothing in\r\nhis hand but the flower.\r\n\r\nHe arose with the lily in his hand, and went home at once. There on the\r\ndoorstep was the little key, and in the pine tree he found the magic\r\npalette. He was so delighted with it and so afraid that he might break\r\nthe spell that he began to work that very night. After that he spent\r\nnearly all his time working with the magic palette. He often passed\r\nwhole days beside the sheet of water in the forest. He painted it when\r\nthe sun shone on it and it was spotted all over with the reflections of\r\nfleeting white clouds. He painted it covered with water lilies rocking\r\non the ripples. He painted it by moonlight, when but two or three stars\r\nin the empty sky shone down upon it; and at sunset, when it lay\r\ntrembling like liquid gold.\r\n\r\nSo the years passed, and the boy grew to be a man. He had never broken\r\nthe charm. The lily had never faded, and he still worked every day with\r\nhis magic palette.\r\n\r\nBut no one cared for his pictures. Even his mother did not like them.\r\nHis forests and misty hills and common clouds were too much like the\r\nreal ones. She said she could see as good any day by looking out of her\r\nwindow. All this made the young man very unhappy. He began to doubt\r\nwhether he should ever be a painter, and one day he threw down his\r\npalette. He thought the fairy had deserted him.\r\n\r\nHe threw himself on his bed. It grew dark, and he soon fell asleep; but\r\nin the middle of the night he awoke with a start. His chamber was full\r\nof light, and his fairy friend stood near.\r\n\r\n"Shall I take back my gift?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, no, no!" he cried. He was rested now, and he did not feel so\r\nmuch discouraged.\r\n\r\n"If you still wish to go on working, take this ring," said the fairy.\r\n"My sister sends it to you. Wear it, and it will greatly assist the\r\ncharm."\r\n\r\nHe took the ring, and the fairy was gone. The ring was set with a\r\nbeautiful blue stone, which reflected everything bright that came near\r\nit; and he thought he saw inside the ring the one word--"Hope."\r\n\r\nMany more years passed. The young man\'s mother died, and he went far,\r\nfar from home. In the strange land to which he went people thought his\r\npictures were wonderful; and he had become a great and famous painter.\r\n\r\nOne day he went to see a large collection of pictures in a great city.\r\nHe saw many of his own pictures, and some of them had been painted\r\nbefore he left his forest home. All the people and the painters praised\r\nthem; but there was one that they liked better than the others. It was a\r\npicture of a little child, holding in its hands several water lilies.\r\n\r\nToward evening the people departed one by one, till he was left alone\r\nwith his masterpieces. He was sitting in a chair thinking of leaving the\r\nplace, when he suddenly fell asleep. And he dreamed that he was again\r\nstanding near the little lake in his native land, watching the rays of\r\nthe setting sun as they melted away from its surface. The beautiful lily\r\nwas in his hand, and while he looked at it the leaves became withered,\r\nand fell at his feet. Then he felt a light touch on his hand. He looked\r\nup, and there on the chair beside him stood the little fairy.\r\n\r\n"O wonderful fairy!" he cried, "how can I thank you for your magic gift?\r\nI can give you nothing but my thanks. But at least tell me your name, so\r\nthat I may cut it on a ring and always wear it."\r\n\r\n"My name," replied the fairy, "is Perseverance."\r\n\r\n_Jean Ingelow._\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:]\r\n\r\n\r\nName the different objects you see in the picture.

To the inquiry, what course she had pursued in\r\nrearing one so truly illustrious, she replied, "Only to require\r\nobedience, diligence, and truth."\r\n\r\nThese simple rules, faithfully enforced, and incorporated with the\r\nrudiments of character, had a powerful influence over his future\r\ngreatness.\r\n\r\nHe was early accustomed to accuracy in all his statements, and to speak\r\nof his faults and omissions without prevarication or disguise. Hence\r\narose that noble openness of soul, and contempt of deceit in others,\r\nwhich ever distinguished him. Once, by an inadvertence of his youth,\r\nconsiderable loss had been incurred, and of such a nature as to\r\ninterfere with the plans of his mother. He came to her, frankly owning\r\nhis error, and she replied, while tears of affection moistened her eyes,\r\n"I had rather it should be so, than that my son should have been guilty\r\nof a falsehood."\r\n\r\nShe was careful not to enervate him by luxury or weak indulgence. He was\r\ninured to early rising, and never permitted to be idle. Sometimes he\r\nengaged in labors which the children of wealthy parents would now\r\naccount severe, and thus acquired firmness of frame and a disregard of\r\nhardship.\r\n\r\nThe systematic employment of time, which from childhood he had been\r\ntaught, was of great service when the weight of a nation\'s concerns\r\ndevolved upon him. It was then observed by those who surrounded him,\r\nthat he was never known to be in a hurry, but found time for the\r\ntransaction of the smallest affairs in the midst of the greatest and\r\nmost conflicting duties.\r\n\r\nSuch benefit did he derive from attention to the counsels of his mother.\r\nHis obedience to her commands, when a child, was cheerful and strict;\r\nand as he approached to maturer years, the expression of her slightest\r\nwish was law.\r\n\r\nAt length, America having secured her independence, and the war being\r\nended, Washington, who for eight years had not tasted the repose of\r\nhome, hastened with filial reverence to ask his mother\'s blessing. The\r\nhero, "first in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his\r\ncountrymen," came to lay his laurels at his mother\'s feet.\r\n\r\nThis venerable woman continued, till past her ninetieth year, to be\r\nrespected and beloved by all around. With pious grief, Washington closed\r\nher eyes and laid her in the grave which she had selected for herself.\r\n\r\nWe have now seen the man who was the leader of victorious armies, the\r\nconqueror of a mighty kingdom, and the admiration of the world, in the\r\ndelightful attitude of an obedient and affectionate son. She, whom he\r\nhonored with such filial reverence, said that "he had learned to command\r\nothers by first learning to obey."\r\n\r\nLet those, then, who in the morning of life are ambitious of future\r\neminence, cultivate the virtue of filial obedience, and remember that\r\nthey cannot be either fortunate or happy while they neglect the\r\ninjunction, "My son, keep thy father\'s commandments, and forsake not the\r\nlaw of thy mother."\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _L.E.

He is about fourteen years old, but tall for that age, with\r\nelegance of form and manliness of bearing. His bare neck and limbs are\r\nwell developed by healthy exercise; his features display an open and\r\nwarm heart, while his lofty forehead, round which his brown hair\r\nnaturally curls, beams with a bright intelligence. He wears the usual\r\nyouth\'s garment, the short toga, reaching below the knee, and a hollow\r\nspheroid of gold suspended round his neck. A bundle of papers and vellum\r\nrolls fastened together, and carried by an old servant behind him, shows\r\nus that he is just returning home from school.\r\n\r\nWhile we have been thus noting him, he has received his mother\'s\r\nembrace, and has sat himself low by her feet. She gazes upon him for\r\nsome time in silence, as if to discover in his countenance the cause of\r\nhis unusual delay, for he is an hour late in his return. But he meets\r\nher glance with so frank a look, and with such a smile of innocence,\r\nthat every cloud of doubt is in a moment dispelled, and she addresses\r\nhim as follows:\r\n\r\n"What has detained you to-day, my dearest boy? No accident, I trust, has\r\nhappened to you on the way."\r\n\r\n"Oh, none, I assure you, sweetest mother; on the contrary, all has been\r\nso delightful that I can scarcely venture to tell you."\r\n\r\nA look of smiling, expostulation drew from the open-hearted boy a\r\ndelicious laugh, as he continued: "Well, I suppose I must. You know I am\r\nnever happy if I have failed to tell you all the bad and the good of the\r\nday about myself. But, to-day, for the first time, I have a doubt\r\nwhether I ought to tell you all."\r\n\r\nDid the mother\'s heart flutter more than usual, as from a first anxiety,\r\nor was there a softer solicitude dimming her eye, that the youth should\r\nseize her hand and put it tenderly to his lips, while he thus replied:\r\n\r\n"Fear nothing, mother most beloved, your son has done nothing that may\r\ngive you pain. Only say, do you wish to hear _all_ that has befallen me\r\nto-day, or only the cause of my late return home?"\r\n\r\n"Tell me all, dear Pancratius," she answered; "nothing that concerns you\r\ncan be indifferent to me."\r\n\r\n"Well, then," he began, "this last day of my frequenting school appears\r\nto me to have been singularly blessed. First, I was crowned as the\r\nsuccessful competitor in a declamation, which our good master Cassianus\r\nset us for our work during the morning hours; and this led, as you will\r\nhear, to some singular discoveries. The subject was, \'That the real\r\nphilosopher should be ever ready to die for the truth.\' I never heard\r\nanything so cold or insipid (I hope it is not wrong to say so) as the\r\ncompositions read by my companions. It was not their fault, poor\r\nfellows! what truth can they possess, and what inducements can they have\r\nto die for any of their vain opinions? But to a Christian, what charming\r\nsuggestions such a theme naturally makes! And so I felt it. My heart\r\nglowed, and all my thoughts seemed to burn, as I wrote my essay, full of\r\nthe lessons you have taught me, and of the domestic examples that are\r\nbefore me. The son of a martyr could not feel otherwise. But when my\r\nturn came to read my declamation, I found that my feelings had nearly\r\nbetrayed me. In the warmth of my recitation, the word \'Christian\'\r\nescaped my lips instead of \'philosopher,\' and \'faith\' instead of\r\n\'truth,\' At the first mistake, I saw Cassianus start; at the second, I\r\nsaw a tear glisten in his eye, as bending affectionately towards me, he\r\nsaid, in a whisper, \'Beware, my child, there are sharp ears listening.\'"\r\n\r\n"What, then," interrupted the mother, "is Cassianus a Christian? I chose\r\nhis school because it was in the highest repute for learning and\r\nmorality; and now indeed I thank God that I did so. But in these days of\r\ndanger we are obliged to live as strangers in our own land. Certainly,\r\nhad Cassianus proclaimed his faith, his school would soon have been\r\ndeserted. But go on, my dear boy. Were his apprehensions well grounded?"\r\n\r\n"I fear so; for while the great body of my school-fellows vehemently\r\napplauded my hearty declamation, I saw the dark eyes of Corvinus bent\r\nscowlingly upon me, as he bit his lip in manifest anger."\r\n\r\n"And who is he, my child, that was so displeased, and wherefore?"\r\n\r\n"He is the strongest, but, unfortunately, the dullest boy in the school.\r\nBut this, you know, is not his fault. Only, I know not why, he seems\r\never to have had a grudge against me, the cause of which I cannot\r\nunderstand."\r\n\r\n"Did he say aught to you, or do?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, and was the cause of my delay. For when we went forth from school\r\ninto the field by the river, he addressed me insultingly in the presence\r\nof our companions, and said, \'Come, Pancratius, this, I understand, is\r\nthe last time we meet _here_; but I have a long score to demand payment\r\nof from you. You have loved to show your superiority in school over me\r\nand others older and better than yourself; I saw your supercilious looks\r\nat me as you spouted your high-flown declamation to-day; ay, and I\r\ncaught expressions in it which you may live to rue, and that very soon.\r\nBefore you leave us, I must have my revenge. If you are worthy of your\r\nname let us fairly contend in more manly strife than that of the style\r\nand tables. Wrestle with me, or try the cestus against me. I burn to\r\nhumble you as you deserve, before these witnesses of your insolent\r\ntriumphs.\'"\r\n\r\nThe anxious mother bent eagerly forward as she listened, and scarcely\r\nbreathed. "And what," she exclaimed, "did you answer, my dear son?"\r\n\r\n"I told him gently that he was quite mistaken; for never had I\r\nconsciously done anything that could give pain to him or any of my\r\nschool-fellows; nor did I ever dream of claiming superiority over them.\r\n\'And as to what you propose,\' I added, \'you know, Corvinus, that I have\r\nalways refused to indulge in personal combats, which, beginning in a\r\ncool trial of skill, end in an angry strife, hatred, and wish for\r\nrevenge. How much less could I think of entering on them now, when you\r\navow that you are anxious to begin them with those evil feelings which\r\nare usually their bad end?\' Our school-mates had now formed a circle\r\nround us; and I clearly saw that they were all against me, for they had\r\nhoped to enjoy some of the delights of their cruel games; I therefore\r\ncheerfully added, \'And now, my comrades, good-by, and may all happiness\r\nattend you. I part from you, as I have lived with you, in peace,\' \'Not\r\nso,\' replied Corvinus, now purple in the face with fury; \'but--\'"\r\n\r\nThe boy\'s countenance became crimsoned, his voice quivered, his body\r\ntrembled, and, half-choked, he sobbed out, "I cannot go on; I dare not\r\ntell the rest!"\r\n\r\n"I entreat you, for God\'s sake, and for the love you bear your father\'s\r\nmemory," said the mother, placing her hand upon her son\'s head, "conceal\r\nnothing from me. I shall never again have rest if you tell me not all.\r\nWhat further said or did Corvinus?"\r\n\r\nThe boy recovered himself by a moment\'s pause and a silent prayer, and\r\nthen proceeded:\r\n\r\n"\'Not so!\' exclaimed Corvinus, \'not so do you depart! You have concealed\r\nyour abode from us, but I will find you out; till then bear this token\r\nof my determined purpose to be revenged!\' So saying, he dealt me a\r\nfurious blow upon the face, which made me reel and stagger, while a\r\nshout of savage delight broke forth from the boys around us."\r\n\r\nHe burst into tears, which relieved him, and then went on:\r\n\r\n"Oh, how I felt my blood boil at that moment; how my heart seemed\r\nbursting within me; and a voice appeared to whisper in my ear the name\r\nof \'coward!\' It surely was an evil spirit. I felt that I was strong\r\nenough--my rising anger made me so--to seize my unjust assailant by the\r\nthroat, and cast him gasping on the ground. I heard already the shout of\r\napplause that would have hailed my victory and turned the tables against\r\nhim. It was the hardest struggle of my life; never were flesh and blood\r\nso strong within me. O God! may they never be again so tremendously\r\npowerful."\r\n\r\n"And what did you do, then, my darling boy?" gasped forth the trembling\r\nmatron.\r\n\r\nHe replied, "My good angel conquered the demon at my side. I stretched\r\nforth my hand to Corvinus, and said, \'May God forgive you, as I freely\r\nand fully do; and may He bless you abundantly.\' Cassianus came up at\r\nthat moment, having seen all from a distance, and the youthful crowd\r\nquickly dispersed. I entreated him, by our common faith, now\r\nacknowledged between us, not to pursue Corvinus for what he had done;\r\nand I obtained his promise. And now, sweet mother," murmured the boy, in\r\nsoft, gentle accents, into his parent\'s bosom, "do you think I may call\r\nthis a happy day?"\r\n\r\n_"Fabiola"--Cardinal Wiseman._\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nSPHEROID (sf[=e]\'), a body or figure in shape like a sphere.\r\n\r\nVELLUM, a fine kind of parchment, made of the skin of a lamb, goat,\r\nsheep or young calf, for writing on.\r\n\r\nTHEME, a subject or topic on which a person writes or speaks.\r\n\r\nSCORE, bill, account, reckoning.\r\n\r\nSUPERCIL\'IOUS, proud, haughty.\r\n\r\nSTYLES AND TABLES, writing implements for schools.

throughout the City\r\n         Almost matched their gleaming light;\r\n       While the winter snow was lying,\r\n       And the winter winds were sighing,\r\n         Long ago, one Christmas night.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n       Rich and poor felt love and blessing\r\n         From the gracious season fall;\r\n       Joy and plenty in the cottage,\r\n         Peace and feasting in the hall;\r\n       And the voices of the children\r\n         Ringing clear above it all.\r\n\r\n       Yet one house was dim and darkened;\r\n         Gloom, and sickness, and despair,\r\n       Dwelling in the gilded chambers,\r\n         Creeping up the marble stair,\r\n       Even stilled the voice of mourning,--\r\n         For a child lay dying there.\r\n\r\n       Silken curtains fell around him,\r\n         Velvet carpets hushed the tread,\r\n       Many costly toys were lying\r\n         All unheeded by his bed;\r\n       And his tangled golden ringlets\r\n         Were on downy pillows spread.\r\n\r\n       The skill of all that mighty City\r\n         To save one little life was vain,--\r\n       One little thread from being broken,\r\n       One fatal word from being spoken;\r\n         Nay, his very mother\'s pain\r\n       And the mighty love within her\r\n         Could not give him health again.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n       Suddenly an unseen Presence\r\n         Checked those constant moaning cries,\r\n       Stilled the little heart\'s quick fluttering,\r\n         Raised those blue and wondering eyes,\r\n       Fixed on some mysterious vision\r\n         With a startled, sweet surprise.\r\n\r\n       For a radiant angel hovered,\r\n         Smiling, o\'er the little bed;\r\n       White his raiment; from his shoulders\r\n         Snowy dove-like pinions spread,\r\n       And a starlike light was shining\r\n         In a glory round his head.\r\n\r\n       While, with tender love, the angel,\r\n         Leaning o\'er the little nest,\r\n       In his arms the sick child folding,\r\n         Laid him gently on his breast,\r\n       Sobs and wailings told the mother\r\n         That her darling was at rest.\r\n\r\n       So the angel, slowly rising,\r\n         Spread his wings, and through the air\r\n       Bore the child; and, while he held him\r\n         To his heart with loving care,\r\n       Placed a branch of crimson roses\r\n         Tenderly beside him there.\r\n\r\n       While the child, thus clinging, floated\r\n         Towards the mansions of the Blest,\r\n       Gazing from his shining guardian\r\n         To the flowers upon his breast,\r\n       Thus the angel spake, still smiling\r\n         On the little heavenly guest:\r\n\r\n       "Know, dear little one, that Heaven\r\n         Does no earthly thing disdain;\r\n       Man\'s poor joys find there an echo\r\n         Just as surely as his pain;\r\n       Love, on earth so feebly striving,\r\n         Lives divine in Heaven again.\r\n\r\n       "Once, in that great town below us,\r\n         In a poor and narrow street,\r\n       Dwelt a little sickly orphan;\r\n         Gentle aid, or pity sweet,\r\n       Never in life\'s rugged pathway\r\n         Guided his poor tottering feet.\r\n\r\n       "All the striving, anxious fore-thought\r\n         That should only come with age\r\n       Weighed upon his baby spirit,\r\n         Showed him soon life\'s sternest page;\r\n       Grim Want was his nurse, and Sorrow\r\n         Was his only heritage."\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n       "One bright day, with feeble footsteps\r\n         Slowly forth he tried to crawl\r\n       Through the crowded city\'s pathways,\r\n         Till he reached a garden-wall,\r\n       Where \'mid princely halls and mansions\r\n         Stood the lordliest of all.\r\n\r\n       "There were trees with giant branches,\r\n       Velvet glades where shadows hide;\r\n       There were sparkling fountains glancing,\r\n         Flowers, which in luxuriant pride\r\n       Even wafted breaths of perfume\r\n         To the child who stood outside.\r\n\r\n       "He against the gate of iron\r\n         Pressed his wan and wistful face,\r\n       Gazing with an awe-struck pleasure\r\n         At the glories of the place;\r\n       Never had his brightest day-dream\r\n         Shone with half such wondrous grace.\r\n\r\n       "You were playing in that garden,\r\n         Throwing blossoms in the air,\r\n       Laughing when the petals floated\r\n         Downwards on your golden hair;\r\n       And the fond eyes watching o\'er you,\r\n       And the splendor spread before you,\r\n         Told a House\'s Hope was there.\r\n\r\n       "When your servants, tired of seeing\r\n         Such a face of want and woe,\r\n       Turning to the ragged orphan,\r\n         Gave him coin, and bade him go,\r\n       Down his cheeks so thin and wasted\r\n         Bitter tears began to flow.\r\n\r\n       "But that look of childish sorrow\r\n         On your tender child-heart fell,\r\n       And you plucked the reddest roses\r\n         From the tree you loved so well,\r\n       Passed them through the stern cold grating,\r\n         Gently bidding him \'Farewell!\'\r\n\r\n       "Dazzled by the fragrant treasure\r\n         And the gentle voice he heard,\r\n       In the poor forlorn boy\'s spirit,\r\n         Joy, the sleeping Seraph, stirred;\r\n       In his hand he took the flowers,\r\n         In his heart the loving word.\r\n\r\n       "So he crept to his poor garret;\r\n         Poor no more, but rich and bright;\r\n       For the holy dreams of childhood--\r\n         Love, and Rest, and Hope, and Light--\r\n       Floated round the orphan\'s pillow\r\n         Through the starry summer night.\r\n\r\n       "Day dawned, yet the visions lasted;\r\n         All too weak to rise he lay;\r\n       Did he dream that none spake harshly,--\r\n         All were strangely kind that day?\r\n       Surely then his treasured roses\r\n         Must have charmed all ills away.\r\n\r\n       "And he smiled, though they were fading;\r\n         One by one their leaves were shed;\r\n       \'Such bright things could never perish,\r\n         They would bloom again,\' he said.\r\n       When the next day\'s sun had risen\r\n         Child and flowers both were dead.\r\n\r\n       "Know, dear little one, our Father\r\n         Will no gentle deed disdain;\r\n       Love on the cold earth beginning\r\n         Lives divine in Heaven again;\r\n       While the angel hearts that beat there\r\n         Still all tender thoughts retain."\r\n\r\n       So the angel ceased, and gently\r\n         O\'er his little burden leant;\r\n       While the child gazed from the shining,\r\n         Loving eyes that o\'er him bent,\r\n       To the blooming roses by him.\r\n         Wondering what that mystery meant.\r\n\r\n       Thus the radiant angel answered,\r\n         And with tender meaning smiled:\r\n       "Ere your childlike, loving spirit,\r\n         Sin and the hard world defiled,\r\n       God has given me leave to seek you,--\r\n         I was once that little child!"\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n       In the churchyard of that city\r\n         Rose a tomb of marble rare,\r\n       Decked, as soon as Spring awakened,\r\n         With her buds and blossoms fair,--\r\n       And a humble grave beside it,--\r\n         No one knew who rested there.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adelaide A.

Gluck sat down quite close to the fire, for it\r\nwas raining very hard. He turned and turned, and the roast got nice and\r\nbrown.\r\n\r\n"What a pity," thought Gluck, "that my brothers never ask anybody to\r\ndinner. I\'m sure, when they have such a nice piece of mutton as this, it\r\nwould do their hearts good to have somebody to eat it with them." Just\r\nas he spoke there came a double knock at the house door, yet heavy and\r\ndull, as though the knocker had been tied up. "It must be the wind,"\r\nsaid Gluck; "nobody else would venture to knock double knocks at our\r\ndoor."\r\n\r\nNo; it wasn\'t the wind. There it came again very hard, and what was\r\nparticularly astounding the knocker seemed to be in a hurry, and not to\r\nbe in the least afraid of the consequences. Gluck put his head out the\r\nwindow to see who it was.\r\n\r\nIt was the most extraordinary looking little gentleman he had ever seen\r\nin his life. He had a very large nose, slightly brass-colored; his\r\ncheeks were very round and very red; his eyes twinkled merrily through\r\nlong, silky eyelashes; his mustaches curled twice round like a corkscrew\r\non each side of his mouth, and his hair, of a curious mixed\r\npepper-and-salt color, descended far over his shoulders. He was about\r\nfour feet six in height, and wore a conical pointed cap of nearly the\r\nsame altitude, decorated with a black feather some three feet long. He\r\nwore an enormous black, glossy-looking cloak, which must have been very\r\nmuch too long in calm weather, as the wind carried it clear out from the\r\nwearer\'s shoulders to about four times his own length.\r\n\r\nGluck was so perfectly paralyzed by the appearance of his visitor that\r\nhe remained fixed, without uttering a word, until the old gentleman\r\nturned round to look after his fly-away cloak. In so doing he caught\r\nsight of Gluck\'s little yellow head jammed in the window, with its mouth\r\nand eyes very wide open indeed.\r\n\r\n"Hello!" said the little gentleman, "that\'s not the way to answer the\r\ndoor. I\'m wet; let me in." To do the little gentleman justice, he _was_\r\nwet. His feather hung down between his legs like a beaten puppy\'s tail,\r\ndripping like an umbrella; and from the end of his mustaches the water\r\nwas running into his waistcoat pockets, and out again like a mill\r\nstream.\r\n\r\n"I\'m very sorry" said Gluck, "but I really can\'t."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t what?" said the old gentleman.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t let you in, sir. My brothers would beat me to death, sir, if I\r\nthought of such a thing. What do you want, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Want?" said the old gentleman. "I want fire and shelter; and there\'s\r\nyour great fire there blazing, crackling, and dancing on the walls, with\r\nnobody to feel it. Let me in, I say."\r\n\r\nGluck had had his head, by this time, so long out of the window that he\r\nbegan to feel it was really unpleasantly cold. When he turned and saw\r\nthe beautiful fire rustling and roaring, and throwing long, bright\r\ntongues up the chimney, as if it were licking its chops at the savory\r\nsmell of the leg of mutton, his heart melted within him that it should\r\nbe burning away for nothing.\r\n\r\n"He does look _very_ wet," said little Gluck; "I\'ll just let him in for\r\na quarter of an hour."\r\n\r\nAs the little gentleman walked in, there came a gust of wind through the\r\nhouse that made the old chimney totter.\r\n\r\n"That\'s a good boy. Never mind your brothers. I\'ll talk to them."\r\n\r\n"Pray, sir, don\'t do any such thing," said Gluck. "I can\'t let you stay\r\ntill they come; they\'d be the death of me."\r\n\r\n"Dear me," said the old gentleman, "I\'m sorry to hear that. How long may\r\nI stay?"\r\n\r\n"Only till the mutton is done, sir," replied Gluck, "and it\'s very\r\nbrown." Then the old gentleman walked into the kitchen and sat himself\r\ndown on the hob, with the top of his cap up the chimney, for it was much\r\ntoo high for the roof.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll soon dry there; sir," said Gluck, and sat down again to turn the\r\nmutton. But the old gentleman did _not_ dry there, but went on drip,\r\ndrip, dripping among the cinders, so that the fire fizzed and sputtered\r\nand began to look very black and uncomfortable. Never was such a cloak;\r\nevery fold in it ran like a gutter.\r\n\r\n"I beg pardon, sir," said Gluck, at length, after watching the water\r\nspreading in long, quicksilver-like streams over the floor; "mayn\'t I\r\ntake your cloak?"\r\n\r\n"No, thank you," said the old gentleman.\r\n\r\n"Your cap, sir?"\r\n\r\n"I am all right, thank you," said the old gentleman, rather gruffly.\r\n\r\n"But--sir--I\'m very sorry," said Gluck, hesitatingly,\r\n"but--really--sir--you\'re putting the fire out."\r\n\r\n"It\'ll take longer to do the mutton, then."\r\n\r\nGluck was very much puzzled by the behavior of his guest; it was such a\r\nstrange mixture of coolness and humility.\r\n\r\n"That mutton looks very nice," said the old gentleman. "Can\'t you give\r\nme a little bit?"\r\n\r\n"Impossible, sir," said Gluck.\r\n\r\n"I\'m very hungry," continued the old gentleman; "I\'ve had nothing to eat\r\nyesterday nor to-day. They surely couldn\'t miss a bit from the knuckle!"\r\n\r\nHe spoke in so very melancholy a tone that it quite melted Gluck\'s\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n"They promised me one slice to-day, sir," said he; "I can give you that,\r\nbut no more."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a good boy," said the old gentleman again.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care if I do get beaten for it," thought Gluck.\r\n\r\nJust as he had cut a large slice out of the mutton, there came a\r\ntremendous rap at the door. The old gentleman jumped; Gluck fitted the\r\nslice into the mutton again, and ran to open the door.\r\n\r\n"What did you keep us waiting in the rain for?" said Schwartz, as he\r\nwalked in, throwing his umbrella in Gluck\'s face.\r\n\r\n"Aye; what for, indeed, you little vagabond?" said Hans, administering\r\nan educational box on the ear, as he followed his brother.\r\n\r\n"Bless my soul!" said Schwartz, when he opened the door.\r\n\r\n"Amen," said the little gentleman, who had taken his cap off, and was\r\nstanding in the middle of the kitchen, bowing with the utmost velocity.\r\n\r\n"Who\'s that?" said Schwartz, catching up a rolling-pin, and turning\r\nfiercely to Gluck.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, indeed, brother," said Gluck, in great terror.\r\n\r\n"How did he get in?" roared Schwartz.\r\n\r\n"My dear brother, he was so _very_ wet!"\r\n\r\nThe rolling-pin was descending on Gluck\'s head; but, at that instant,\r\nthe old gentleman interposed his conical cap, on which it crashed with a\r\nshock that shook the water out of it all over the room. What was very\r\nodd, the rolling-pin no sooner touched the cap, than it flew out of\r\nSchwartz\'s hand, spinning like a straw in a high wind, and fell into the\r\ncorner at the farther end of the room.\r\n\r\n"Who are you sir?" demanded Schwartz.\r\n\r\n"What\'s your business?" snarled Hans.\r\n\r\n"I\'m a poor old man, sir," the little gentleman began, very modestly,\r\n"and I saw your fire through the window, and begged shelter for a\r\nquarter of an hour."\r\n\r\n"Have the goodness to walk out again, then," said Schwartz. "We\'ve quite\r\nenough water in our kitchen, without making it a drying house."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a very cold day, sir, to turn an old man out in, sir; look at my\r\ngray hairs."\r\n\r\n"Aye!" said Hans, "there are enough of them to keep you warm. Walk!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m very, very hungry, sir; couldn\'t you spare me a bit of bread before\r\nI go?"\r\n\r\n"Bread, indeed!" said Schwartz; "do you suppose we\'ve nothing to do with\r\nour bread but to give it to such fellows as you?"\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you sell your feather?" said Hans, sneeringly. "Out with\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"A little bit," said the old gentleman.\r\n\r\n"Be off!" said Schwartz.\r\n\r\n"Pray, gentlemen."\r\n\r\n"Off!" cried Hans, seizing him by the collar. But he had no sooner\r\ntouched the old gentleman\'s collar than away he went after the\r\nrolling-pin, spinning round and round, till he fell into the corner on\r\nthe top of it.\r\n\r\nThen Schwartz was very angry, and ran at the old gentleman to turn him\r\nout. But he also had hardly touched him, when away he went after Hans\r\nand the rolling-pin, and hit his head against the wall as he tumbled\r\ninto the corner. And so there they lay, all three.\r\n\r\nThen the old gentleman spun himself round until his long cloak was all\r\nwound neatly about him, clapped his cap on his head, very much on one\r\nside, gave a twist to his corkscrew mustaches, and replied, with perfect\r\ncoolness: "Gentlemen, I wish you a very good morning. At twelve o\'clock\r\nto-night, I\'ll call again."\r\n\r\n_John Ruskin._\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.--"The King of the Golden River," from which the selection is\r\ntaken, is a charming story for children.

NICHOLAS.\r\n\r\n\r\n       \'Twas the  night  before  Christmas,  when  all through the house\r\n       Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse:\r\n       The stockings were hung by the chimney with care,\r\n       In the hope that St. Nicholas soon would be there.\r\n       The children were nestled all snug in their beds,\r\n       While visions of sugar-plums danced in their heads;\r\n       And Mamma in her kerchief, and I in my cap,\r\n       Had just settled our brains for a long winter\'s nap,\r\n       When out on the lawn there rose such a clatter,\r\n       I sprang from my bed to see what was the matter.\r\n       Away to the window I flew like a flash,\r\n       Tore open the shutters, and threw up the sash.\r\n       The moon on the breast of the new-fallen snow\r\n       Gave the luster of midday to objects below;\r\n       When, what  to  my wondering eyes should appear\r\n       But a miniature sleigh, and eight tiny reindeer,\r\n       With a little old driver, so lively and quick,\r\n       I knew in a moment it must be St. Nick!\r\n       More rapid than eagles his coursers they came,\r\n       And he whistled, and shouted  and called them by name:\r\n       "Now, Dasher! now, Dancer! now, Prancer! now, Vixen!\r\n       On, Comet! on, Cupid! on, Donder and Blitzen!\r\n       To the top of the porch, to the top of the wall,\r\n       Now, dash away! dash away! dash away, all!"\r\n       As dry leaves, that before the wild hurricane fly\r\n       When they meet with an obstacle, mount to the sky,\r\n       So, up to the house-top the coursers they flew,\r\n       With the sleigh full of toys, and St. Nicholas, too;\r\n       And then, in a twinkling, I heard on the roof\r\n       The prancing and pawing of each little hoof.\r\n       As I drew in my head, and was turning around,\r\n       Down the chimney St. Nicholas came with a bound.\r\n       He was dressed all in fur from his head to his foot,\r\n       And his clothes were all tarnished with ashes and soot;\r\n       A bundle of toys he had flung on his back,\r\n       And he looked like a peddler just opening his pack;\r\n       His eyes, how they twinkled! his dimples, how merry!\r\n       His cheeks were like roses, his nose like a cherry;\r\n       His droll little mouth was drawn up like a bow,\r\n       And the beard on his chin was as white as the snow;\r\n       The stump of a pipe he held tight in his teeth,\r\n       And the smoke it  encircled his head like a wreath;\r\n       He had a broad face, and a little round belly,\r\n       That shook, when he laughed, like a bowlful of jelly.\r\n       He was chubby and plump,--a right jolly old elf--\r\n       And I laughed when I saw him, in spite of myself.\r\n       A wink of his eye and a twist of his head\r\n       Soon gave me to know I had nothing to dread.\r\n       He spoke not a word, but went straight to his work,\r\n       And filled all the stockings; then turned with a jerk,\r\n       And, laying his finger aside of his nose,\r\n       And giving a nod, up the chimney he rose.\r\n       He sprang to his sleigh, to his team gave a whistle,\r\n       And away they all flew like the down of a thistle;\r\n       But I heard him exclaim, ere he drove out of sight,\r\n       "Merry Christmas to all, and to all a good-night!"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Clement C.

From the\r\nearly days of Barry and Jones, when it swept the decks of King George\'s\r\nproud ships with merciless fire, down to the glories achieved by\r\nAdmirals Dewey and Schley in our war with Spain, the story of our Navy\r\nis the pride and glory of our Republic. The glowing track of its\r\nvictories extends around the world.\r\n\r\nOf the many distinguished men whose names and whose deeds adorn the\r\npages of our country\'s history, there is none more deserving of our\r\ngratitude and admiration than Commodore John Barry. His name and fame\r\nwill live in the naval annals of our country as long as the history of\r\nAmerica lasts.\r\n\r\nCommodore Barry, the founder of the American Navy, was born in County\r\nWexford, Ireland, in the year 1745. At the age of fourteen he left home\r\nfor a life on\r\n\r\n       "The sea, the sea, the open sea,\r\n       The blue, the fresh, the ever free."\r\n\r\n\r\nOn board trading vessels he made several voyages to America. He spent\r\nhis leisure hours in reading and study, and in this way soon acquired a\r\ngeneral and practical education. By fidelity to duty, he advanced so\r\nrapidly in his profession that at the age of twenty-five we find him in\r\ncommand of the _Black Prince,_ one of the finest merchant vessels then\r\nrunning between Philadelphia and London.\r\n\r\nWhen the Revolution broke out between the Colonies and England, our\r\ngallant Commodore gave up the command of his ship, and without delay or\r\nhesitation espoused the cause of his adopted country. Congress purchased\r\na few vessels, had them fitted out for war, and placed the little fleet\r\nunder the command of Captain Barry. His flagship was the _Lexington_,\r\nnamed after the first battle of the Revolution; and Congress having at\r\nthis time adopted a national flag, the Star-spangled Banner, the\r\n_Lexington_ was the first to hoist this ensign of freedom.\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the fitting out of the _Lexington_ down to the time of\r\nthe declaration of peace, which assured the liberation of the Colonies\r\nfrom the thraldom of Great Britain, Commodore Barry was constantly\r\nengaged on shore and afloat. Though he actually participated in upwards\r\nof twenty sea fights, always against a force superior to his own, he\r\nnever once struck his flag to the enemy. The field of his operations\r\nranged all the way from the capes of the Delaware to the West Indies,\r\nand as far east as the coast of Maine and Newfoundland. His victories\r\nwere hailed with joy throughout the country, and Barry and his men were\r\npublicly thanked by General Washington.\r\n\r\nDuring the darkest days of the War, while Washington was spending the\r\nwinter of 1777 in camp at Valley Forge, with our brave soldiers\r\nperishing for want of provisions, blankets, clothing and tents, an\r\nincident occurred which shows how supremely loyal and devoted Commodore\r\nBarry was to the American cause. The British troops were occupying\r\nPhiladelphia. Lord Howe, their commander, offered our great sea fighter\r\na bribe of fifty thousand guineas and the command of a ship of war, if\r\nhe would abandon the American cause and enter the service of England.\r\nBarry\'s indignant reply should be written in letters of gold: "I have\r\nengaged in the service of my adopted country, and neither the value nor\r\nthe command of the whole British fleet can seduce me from it."\r\n\r\nGeneral Washington had the utmost confidence in the pluck and daring and\r\nloyalty of Barry. He selected him as the best and safest man to be\r\ntrusted with the important mission of carrying our commissioners to\r\nFrance to secure that alliance and assistance which we then so sorely\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nOn his homeward trip, it is related that being hailed by a British\r\nman-of-war with the usual questions as to the name of his ship, captain,\r\nand destination, he gave the following bold and characteristic reply:\r\n"This is the United States ship _Alliance_: Jack Barry, half Irishman\r\nand half Yankee, commander: who are you?" In the engagement that\r\nfollowed, Barry and his band of heroes performed such deeds of valor\r\nthat after a few hours of terrific cannonading, the English ship was\r\nforced to strike its colors and surrender to the "half Irishman and half\r\nYankee."\r\n\r\nThis illustrious man, who was the first that bore the title of Commodore\r\nin the service of our Republic, continued at the head of our infant Navy\r\ntill his death, which took place in Philadelphia, on the 13th of\r\nSeptember, 1803. During life he was generous and charitable, and at his\r\ndeath made the children of the Catholic Orphan Asylum of Philadelphia\r\nthe chief recipients of his wealth. His remains repose in the little\r\ngraveyard attached to St. Mary\'s Catholic church.\r\n\r\nThrough the generous patriotism of the "Friendly Sons of St. Patrick," a\r\nsociety of which General Washington himself was a member, a magnificent\r\nmonument was erected to the memory of Commodore Barry, in Independence\r\nSquare, Philadelphia, under the shadow of Independence Hall, the cradle\r\nof American liberty. Miss Elise Hazel Hepburn, a great-great-grandniece\r\nof the Commodore, had a prominent part at the ceremonies of the\r\nunveiling, which took place on Saint Patrick\'s Day, 1907.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n       There are gallant hearts whose glory\r\n         Columbia loves to name,\r\n       Whose deeds shall live in story\r\n         And everlasting fame.\r\n       But never yet one braver\r\n         Our starry banner bore\r\n       Than saucy old Jack Barry,\r\n         The Irish Commodore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat is meant by the Congress of the U.S.?

When a young girl, she gave herself\r\n  so completely up to reading that her father threatened to burn her\r\n  books. She began to write at an early age, and contributed poems and\r\n  essays to various periodicals. She is the author of many poems that will\r\n  live. She died in 1889.\r\n\r\nCOWPER, WILLIAM, is one of the most eminent and popular of all\r\n  English poets. He was born in the year 1731. His mother dying when he\r\n  was only six years old, the child was sent away from home to boarding\r\n  school, where he suffered so much from the cruelty of a bigger boy that\r\n  he was obliged to leave that school for another. At the completion of\r\n  his college course he expressed regrets that his education was not\r\n  received in a school where he could be taught his duty to God. "I have\r\n  been graduated," he writes, "but I understand neither the law nor the\r\n  gospel." His longest poem is "The Task," upon which his reputation as a\r\n  poet chiefly depends. He died in the year 1800.\r\n\r\nDICKENS, CHARLES, one of the greatest and most popular of the\r\n  novelists of England, was born in 1812. By hard, persistent work he\r\n  raised himself from obscurity and poverty to fame and fortune. After\r\n  only two years of schooling he was obliged to go to work. His first job\r\n  was pasting labels on blacking-pots, for which he received twenty-five\r\n  cents a day! He next became office boy in a lawyer\'s office, and then\r\n  reporter for a London daily paper. He learned shorthand by himself from\r\n  a book he found in a public reading-room. In 1841, and again in 1867, he\r\n  lectured in America. He died suddenly in 1870, and is buried in\r\n  Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nDONNELLY, ELEANOR CECILIA, began to write verses when she was but\r\n  eight years old. Her early education was directed by her mother, a\r\n  gifted and accomplished lady. Her pen has ever been devoted to the cause\r\n  of Catholic truth and the elevation of Catholic literature. Besides\r\n  hundreds of charming stories and essays, she has published several\r\n  volumes of poems. Her writings on sacred subjects display a strong,\r\n  intelligent faith, and a tender piety. She is a writer whose pathos,\r\n  originality, grace of diction, sweetness of rhythm, purity of sentiment,\r\n  and sublimity of thought entitle her to rank among the first of our\r\n  American poets. Miss Donnelly has lived all her life in her native city\r\n  of Philadelphia, where she is the center of a cultured circle of\r\n  admiring friends, and where she edifies all by the practice of every\r\n  Christian virtue and by a life of devotedness to the honor and glory of\r\n  Almighty God.\r\n\r\nGOULD, HANNAH F., an American poetess, has written many pleasant\r\n  poems for children. "Jack Frost" and "The Winter King" have long been\r\n  favorites. She was born in Vermont in the year 1789, and died in 1865.\r\n\r\nHAWTHORNE, NATHANIEL, was born in Salem, Mass., on July 4, 1804.\r\n  When still quite young he showed a great fondness for reading. At the\r\n  early age of six his favorite book was Bunyan\'s "Pilgrim\'s Progress." At\r\n  college he was a classmate of Longfellow. Among his writings are a\r\n  number of stories for children: "The Tanglewood Tales," "The\r\n  Snow-Image," "The Wonder Books," and some stories of American history.\r\n  His volumes of short stories charm old and young alike. His Book, "The\r\n  Scarlet Letter," has made him famous. It was while he lived at Lenox,\r\n  Mass., among the Berkshire Hills, that he published "The House of the\r\n  Seven Gables." He visited Italy in 1857, where he began "The Marble\r\n  Faun," which is considered his greatest novel. He died in 1864, and is\r\n  buried in Concord, Mass. Hawthorne possessed a delicate and exquisite\r\n  humor, and a marvelous felicity in the use of language. His style may be\r\n  said to combine almost every excellence--elegance, simplicity, grace,\r\n  clearness and force.\r\n\r\nHAYNE, PAUL HAMILTON, an American poet, was born in South Carolina\r\n  in the year 1831. In 1854 he published a volume of poems. His death\r\n  occurred in 1886. He was a descendant of the American patriot, Isaac\r\n  Hayne, who, at the siege of Charleston in 1780, fell into the hands of\r\n  the British, and was hanged by them because he refused to join their\r\n  ranks and fight against his country.\r\n\r\nHOLLAND, JOSIAH GILBERT, a popular American author who wrote under\r\n  the assumed name of _Timothy Titcomb,_ was born in Massachusetts in the\r\n  year 1819. He began life as a physician, but after a few years of\r\n  practice gave up his profession and went to Vicksburg, Miss., as\r\n  Superintendent of Schools. He wrote a number of novels and several\r\n  volumes of essays. In 1870 he became editor of _Scribner\'s Magazine._ He\r\n  died in 1881.\r\n\r\nHUNT, LEIGH, editor, essayist, critic, and poet, and an intimate\r\n  friend of Byron, Moore, Keats, and Shelley, was born near London,\r\n  England, in 1784, and died in 1859.\r\n\r\nJACKSON, HELEN HUNT, a noted American writer of prose and poetry,\r\n  and known for years by her pen name of "H.H." (the initials of her\r\n  name), was born in Massachusetts in the year 1831. She is the author of\r\n  many charming poems, short stories, and novels. Read her "Bits of Talk"\r\n  and "Bits of Travel." She lived some years in Colorado, where her life\r\n  brought to her notice the wrongs done the Indians. In their defense she\r\n  wrote "A Century of Dishonor," The last book she wrote is "Ramona," an\r\n  Indian romance, which she hoped would do for the Indian what "Uncle\r\n  Tom\'s Cabin" had done for the slave. Mrs. Jackson died in California in\r\n  1885.\r\n\r\n"MERCEDES" is the pen name of an able, zealous, and devoted Sister\r\n  of one of our great Teaching Communities. She has written several\r\n  excellent "Plays" for use in Convent Schools which have met the test of\r\n  successful production. Her "Wild Flowers from the Mountain-side" is a\r\n  volume of Poems and Dramas that exhibit "the heart and soul and faith of\r\n  true poetry." A competent critic calls these "Wild Flowers sweet, their\r\n  hues most delicate, their fragrance most agreeable." Mercedes has also\r\n  enriched the columns of _The Missionary_ and other publications with\r\n  several true stories, in attractive prose, of edifying conversions\r\n  resulting from the missionary zeal of priest and teacher. Her graceful\r\n  pen is ever at the service of every cause tending to the glory of God\r\n  and the good of souls.\r\n\r\nMOORE, THOMAS, was born in the city of Dublin, Ireland, in the year\r\n  1779, and was educated at Trinity College. His matchless "Melodies" are\r\n  the delight of all lovers of music, and are sung all over the world.\r\n  Archbishop McHale of Tuam translated them into the grand old Celtic\r\n  tongue. Moore is the greatest of Ireland\'s song-writers, and one of the\r\n  world\'s greatest. As a poet few have equaled him in the power to write\r\n  poetry which charms the ear by its delightful cadence. His lines display\r\n  an exquisite harmony, and are perfectly adapted to the thoughts which\r\n  they express and inspire. His grave is in England, where he spent the\r\n  later years of his life, and where he died in 1852. In 1896, the Moore\r\n  Memorial Committee of Dublin erected over his grave a monument\r\n  consisting of a magnificent and beautiful Celtic cross.\r\n\r\nMOORE, CLEMENT C., poet and teacher, was born in New York in 1779.\r\n  In 1821 he was appointed professor in a Seminary founded by his father,\r\n  who was Bishop Benjamin Moore of the Protestant Episcopal diocese of New\r\n  York. He died in 1863.\r\n\r\nMORRIS, GEORGE P., poet and journalist, wrote several popular\r\n  poems, but is remembered chiefly for his songs and ballads. He was born\r\n  in Philadelphia in the year 1802, and died in New York in 1864.\r\n\r\nMCCARTHY, DENIS ALOYSIUS, poet, lecturer and journalist, was born\r\n  in Carrick-on-Suir, County Tipperary, Ireland, in the year 1871, and\r\n  made his elementary and intermediate studies in the Christian Brothers\'\r\n  School of his native town. Since his arrival in America in 1886, he has\r\n  published two volumes of poems which he modestly calls "A Round of\r\n  Rimes" and "Voices from Erin." "His poetry," says a distinguished critic\r\n  who is neither Irish nor Catholic, "is soulful and sweet, and sings\r\n  itself into the heart of anyone who has a bit of sentiment in his\r\n  make-up." Mr. McCarthy is at present Associate Editor of the _Sacred\r\n  Heart Review_ of Boston. He lectures on literary and Irish themes, and\r\n  contributes poems, stories, essays, book reviews, etc., to various\r\n  papers and magazines.\r\n\r\nNEWMAN, CARDINAL JOHN HENRY, was born in London in 1801, and\r\n  studied at Trinity College, Oxford. In 1824 he became a minister of the\r\n  Church of England, and rose rapidly in his profession. In 1845 he\r\n  abandoned the English ministry, renounced the errors of Protestantism,\r\n  and entered the Catholic Church, of which he remained till death a most\r\n  faithful, devoted, and zealous son. He was ordained priest in 1848, was\r\n  made Rector of the Catholic University of Dublin in 1854, and in 1879\r\n  was raised to the rank of Cardinal by Pope Leo XIII. Cardinal Newman\'s\r\n  writings are beyond the grasp of young minds, yet they will profit by\r\n  and enjoy the perusal of his two great novels, "Loss and Gain" and\r\n  "Callista." The former is the story of a convert; the latter a tale of\r\n  the third century, in which the beautiful heroine and martyr, Callista,\r\n  is presented with a master\'s art. Newman is the greatest master of\r\n  English prose. In this field he holds the same rank that Shakespeare\r\n  does in English poetry. To his style, Augustine Birrell, a noted English\r\n  essayist, pays the following graceful and eloquent tribute: "The charm\r\n  of Dr. Newman\'s style baffles description. As well might one seek to\r\n  analyze the fragrance of a flower, or to expound in words the jumping of\r\n  one\'s heart when a beloved friend unexpectedly enters the room." This\r\n  great Prince of the Church died the death of the saints in the year\r\n  1890.\r\n\r\nO\'REILLY, JOHN BOYLE, patriot, author, poet and journalist, was\r\n  born on the banks of the famous river Boyne, in County Meath, Ireland,\r\n  in the year 1844. In 1860 he went over to England as agent of the Fenian\r\n  Brotherhood, an organization whose purpose was the freedom of Ireland\r\n  from English rule. In 1863 he joined the English army in order to sow\r\n  the seeds of revolution among the soldiers. In 1866 he was arrested,\r\n  tried for treason, and sentenced to death. This was afterwards commuted\r\n  to twenty years\' penal servitude. In 1867 he was transported to\r\n  Australia to serve out his sentence, whence he escaped in 1869, and made\r\n  his way to Philadelphia. He became editor of the Boston _Pilot_ in 1874.\r\n  He is the author of "Songs from the Southern Seas," "Songs, Legends and\r\n  Ballads," and of other works. He died in 1890. All through life the\r\n  voice and pen of Boyle O\'Reilly were at the service of his Church, his\r\n  native land, and his adopted country. Kindness was the keynote of his\r\n  character. In 1896 Boston erected in his honor a magnificent memorial\r\n  monument.\r\n\r\nRILEY, JAMES WHITCOMB, called the "Hoosier Poet," was born in\r\n  Indiana in the year 1852. In many of his poems there is a strong sense\r\n  of humor. What he writes comes from the heart and goes to the heart. He\r\n  has written much in dialect. His home is in Indianapolis.\r\n\r\nRUSKIN, JOHN, one of the most famous of English authors, was born\r\n  in London in 1819, and educated at Oxford. He spent several years in\r\n  Italy in the study of art. He wrote many volumes of essays and lectures,\r\n  chiefly on matters connected with art and art criticism. In his writings\r\n  we find many beautiful pen-pictures of statues and fine buildings and\r\n  such things. His "Modern Painters," a treatise on art and nature,\r\n  established his reputation as the greatest art critic of England. He\r\n  died in 1900.\r\n\r\nSANGSTER, MRS. MARGARET E., editor and poet, was born in New\r\n  Rochelle, N.Y., on the 22d of February, 1838, and educated in Vienna.\r\n  She has successfully edited such periodicals as _Hearth and Home,\r\n  Harpers\' Young People, and Harpers\' Bazaar,_ in which much of her prose\r\n  and poetry has appeared. She is at present (1909) the editor of _The\r\n  Woman\'s Home Companion._\r\n\r\nSOUTHEY, ROBERT, an eminent English poet and author, was born in\r\n  the year 1774. He began to write verse at the age of ten. In 1792 he was\r\n  expelled from the Westminster School for writing an essay against\r\n  corporal punishment. He then entered one of the colleges of Oxford\r\n  University, where he became an intimate friend of Coleridge. While\r\n  residing at Lisbon he began a special study of Spanish and Portuguese\r\n  literature. In 1813 he was appointed poet-laureate of England, and in\r\n  1835 received a pension from the government. He died in 1843. Southey,\r\n  Coleridge and Wordsworth are often called "The Lake Poets," because they\r\n  lived together for years in the lake country of England, and in their\r\n  writings described the scenery of that beautiful region.\r\n\r\nTENNYSON, ALFRED, is considered the greatest poet of his age, and\r\n  one of the great English poets of modern times. He was born in the year\r\n  1809, and educated at Cambridge University. In 1850 he gave to the world\r\n  "In Memoriam," his lament for the loss by death of his friend, Arthur H.\r\n  Hallam. In 1851 he succeeded Wordsworth as poet-laureate of England. His\r\n  poems, long and short, are general favorites. His "Idyls of the King,"\r\n  "The Princess," "Maud," and "In Memoriam" are his chief long poems.\r\n  These are remarkable for beauty of expression and richness of thought,\r\n  of which Tennyson was master. He died in 1892, lamented by the entire\r\n  English-speaking world, and was buried in Westminster Abbey. Tennyson\r\n  always loved the sea, the music of whose restless waves awakened an\r\n  answering echo in his heart.\r\n\r\nWALLACE, WILLIAM R., was born at Lexington, Ky., in the year 1819.\r\n  As a poet he is best known as the author of "The Sword of Bunker Hill."\r\n\r\nWESTWOOD, THOMAS, an English poet, was born in the year 1814, and\r\n  died in 1888. He wrote several volumes of poetry, one of which was\r\n  "Beads from a Rosary."\r\n\r\nWHITTIER, JOHN G., called the "Quaker Poet," was born in\r\n  Massachusetts in the year 1807. His parents were Quakers and were poor.\r\n  When young he learned to make shoes, and with the money thus earned he\r\n  paid his way at school. He was a boy of nineteen when his first verses\r\n  were published. His poems were inspired by current events, and their\r\n  patriotic spirit gives them a strong hold upon the public. "Snow-bound"\r\n  is considered his greatest poem. Whittier loved home so much that he\r\n  never visited a foreign country, and traveled but little in his own. He\r\n  gave thirty of the best years of his life to the anti-slavery struggle.\r\n  While other poets traveled in foreign lands or studied in their\r\n  libraries, Whittier worked hard for the freedom of the slave. Of this he\r\n  wrote--\r\n         "Forego the dreams of lettered ease,\r\n         Put thou the scholar\'s promise by;\r\n         The rights of man are more than these."\r\n\r\n  Mr. Whittier died in the year 1892.\r\n\r\nWISEMAN, CARDINAL NICHOLAS PATRICK, was born in the year 1802 in\r\n  Seville, Spain, of an Irish family settled there. His family returned to\r\n  Ireland, where he was educated. When he was sixteen he entered the\r\n  English College, Rome, and was ordained priest in 1825. In 1840 he was\r\n  appointed Coadjutor Bishop, and in 1850 the Pope named him Archbishop of\r\n  Westminster, and at the same time created him a Cardinal. He was a\r\n  profound scholar, an eloquent preacher, and a brilliant writer, and is\r\n  the author of many able works. He was one of the founders of the _Dublin\r\n  Review._ He died in 1865. His "Fabiola or the Church of the Catacombs,"\r\n  from which some selections have been taken for this Reader, is one of\r\n  the classics of our language. It was written in 1854.\r\n\r\nWOODWORTH, SAMUEL, editor and poet, was born in Massachusetts in\r\n  1785, and died in 1842. With George P. Morris, he founded the _New York\r\n  Mirror._ "The Old Oaken Bucket" is the best known of his poems.\r\n\r\n  For sketches of other authors from whom selections are taken for this\r\n  book, see the Third and the Fourth Reader of the series.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of De La Salle Fifth Reader\r\nby Brothers of the Christian Schools\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK DE LA SALLE FIFTH READER ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 10811-8.txt or 10811-8.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/8/1/10811/\r\n\r\nProduced by Juliet Sutherland, David Gundry and PG Distributed\r\nProofreaders\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook\'s\r\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\r\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\r\n\r\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\r\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\r\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\r\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\r\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\r\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\r\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\r\ndownload by the etext year.\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06\r\n\r\n    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\r\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\r\n\r\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\r\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\r\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\r\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\r\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\r\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234\r\n\r\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689\r\n\r\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL\r\n\r\n'
