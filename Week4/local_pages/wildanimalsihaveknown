Although I have left the strict line of\r\nhistorical truth in many places, the animals in this book were all real\r\ncharacters. They lived the lives I have depicted, and showed the stamp\r\nof heroism and personality more strongly by far than it has been in the\r\npower of my pen to tell.\r\n\r\nI believe that natural history has lost much by the vague general\r\ntreatment that is so common. What satisfaction would be derived from\r\na ten-page sketch of the habits and customs of Man? How much more\r\nprofitable it would be to devote that space to the life of some one\r\ngreat man. This is the principle I have endeavored to apply to my\r\nanimals. The real personality of the individual, and his view of life\r\nare my theme, rather than the ways of the race in general, as viewed by\r\na casual and hostile human eye.\r\n\r\nThis may sound inconsistent in view of my having pieced together some of\r\nthe characters, but that was made necessary by the fragmentary nature\r\nof the records. There is, however, almost no deviation from the truth in\r\nLobo, Bingo, and the Mustang.\r\n\r\nLobo lived his wild romantic life from 1889 to 1894 in the Currumpaw\r\nregion, as the ranchmen know too well, and died, precisely as related,\r\non January 31, 1894.\r\n\r\nBingo was my dog from 1882 to 1888, in spite of interruptions, caused by\r\nlengthy visits to New York, as my Manitoban friends will remember. And\r\nmy old friend, the owner of Tan, will learn from these pages how his dog\r\nreally died.\r\n\r\nThe Mustang lived not far from Lobo in the early nineties. The story is\r\ngiven strictly as it occurred, excepting that there is a dispute as to\r\nthe manner of his death. According to some testimony he broke his neck\r\nin the corral that he was first taken to. Old Turkeytrack is where he\r\ncannot be consulted to settle it.\r\n\r\nWully is, in a sense, a compound of two dogs; both were mongrels, of\r\nsome collie blood, and were raised as sheep-dogs. The first part of\r\nWully is given as it happened, after that it was known only that he\r\nbecame a savage, treacherous sheep-killer. The details of the second\r\npart belong really to another, a similar yaller dog, who long lived\r\nthe double-life---a faithful sheep-dog by day, and a bloodthirsty,\r\ntreacherous monster by night. Such things are less rare than is\r\nsupposed, and since writing these stories I have heard of another\r\ndouble-lived sheep-dog that added to its night amusements the crowning\r\nbarbarity of murdering the smaller dogs of the neighborhood. He had\r\nkilled twenty, and hidden them in a sandpit, when discovered by his\r\nmaster. He died just as Wully did.\r\n\r\nAll told, I now have information of six of these Jekyll-Hyde dogs. In\r\neach case it happened to be a collie.\r\n\r\nRedruff really lived in the Don Valley north of Toronto, and many of my\r\ncompanions will remember him. He was killed in 1889, between the Sugar\r\nLoaf and Castle Frank, by a creature whose name I have withheld, as it\r\nis the species, rather than the individual, that I wish to expose.\r\n\r\nSilverspot, Raggylug, and Vixen are founded on real characters. Though\r\nI have ascribed to them the adventures of more than one of their kind,\r\nevery incident in their biographies is from life.\r\n\r\nThe fact that these stories are true is the reason why all are tragic.\r\nThe life of a wild animal always has a tragic end.\r\n\r\nSuch a collection of histories naturally suggests a common thought--a\r\nmoral it would have been called in the last century. No doubt each\r\ndifferent mind will find a moral to its taste, but I hope some will\r\nherein find emphasized a moral as old as Scripture--we and the beasts\r\nare kin. Man has nothing that the animals have not at least a vestige\r\nof, the animals have nothing that man does not in some degree share.\r\n\r\nSince, then, the animals are creatures with wants and feelings differing\r\nin degree only from our own, they surely have their rights. This\r\nfact, now beginning to be recognized by the Caucasian world, was first\r\nproclaimed by Moses and was emphasized by the Buddhist over 2,000 years\r\nago.\r\n\r\nERNEST THOMPSON SETON\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLOBO, The King of Currumpaw\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nCURRUMPAW is a vast cattle range in northern New Mexico. It is a land of\r\nrich pastures and teeming flocks and herds, a land of rolling mesas and\r\nprecious running waters that at length unite in the Currumpaw River,\r\nfrom which the whole region is named. And the king whose despotic power\r\nwas felt over its entire extent was an old gray wolf.\r\n\r\nOld Lobo, or the king, as the Mexicans called him, was the gigantic\r\nleader of a remarkable pack of gray wolves, that had ravaged the\r\nCurrumpaw Valley for a number of years. All the shepherds and ranchmen\r\nknew him well, and, wherever he appeared with his trusty band, terror\r\nreigned supreme among the cattle, and wrath and despair among their\r\nowners. Old Lobo was a giant among wolves, and was cunning and strong\r\nin proportion to his size. His voice at night was well-known and easily\r\ndistinguished from that of any of his fellows. An ordinary wolf might\r\nhowl half the night about the herdsman\'s bivouac without attracting\r\nmore than a passing notice, but when the deep roar of the old king came\r\nbooming down the canon, the watcher bestirred himself and prepared to\r\nlearn in the morning that fresh and serious inroads had been made among\r\nthe herds.\r\n\r\nOld Lobo\'s band was but a small one. This I never quite understood, for\r\nusually, when a wolf rises to the position and power that he had, he\r\nattracts a numerous following. It may be that he had as many as he\r\ndesired, or perhaps his ferocious temper prevented the increase of his\r\npack. Certain is it that Lobo had only five followers during the latter\r\npart of his reign. Each of these, however, was a wolf of renown, most\r\nof them were above the ordinary size, one in particular, the second in\r\ncommand, was a veritable giant, but even he was far below the leader\r\nin size and prowess. Several of the band, besides the two leaders, were\r\nespecially noted. One of those was a beautiful white wolf, that the\r\nMexicans called Blanca; this was supposed to be a female, possibly\r\nLobo\'s mate. Another was a yellow wolf of remarkable swiftness, which,\r\naccording to current stories had, on several occasions, captured an\r\nantelope for the pack.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, then, that these wolves were thoroughly well-known to\r\nthe cowboys and shepherds. They were frequently seen and oftener heard,\r\nand their lives were intimately associated with those of the cattlemen,\r\nwho would so gladly have destroyed them. There was not a stockman on the\r\nCurrumpaw who would not readily have given the value of many steers for\r\nthe scalp of any one of Lobo\'s band, but they seemed to possess charmed\r\nlives, and defied all manner of devices to kill them. They scorned all\r\nhunters, derided all poisons, and continued, for at least five years,\r\nto exact their tribute from the Currumpaw ranchers to the extent, many\r\nsaid, of a cow each day. According to this estimate, therefore, the band\r\nhad killed more than two thousand of the finest stock, for, as was only\r\ntoo well-known, they selected the best in every instance.\r\n\r\nThe old idea that a wolf was constantly in a starving state, and\r\ntherefore ready to eat anything, was as far as possible from the\r\ntruth in this case, for these freebooters were always sleek and\r\nwell-conditioned, and were in fact most fastidious about what they ate.\r\nAny animal that had died from natural causes, or that was diseased or\r\ntainted, they would not touch, and they even rejected anything that\r\nhad been killed by the stockmen. Their choice and daily food was the\r\ntenderer part of a freshly killed yearling heifer. An old bull or cow\r\nthey disdained, and though they occasionally took a young calf or colt,\r\nit was quite clear that veal or horseflesh was not their favorite diet.\r\nIt was also known that they were not fond of mutton, although they often\r\namused themselves by killing sheep. One night in November, 1893, Blanca\r\nand the yellow wolf killed two hundred and fifty sheep, apparently for\r\nthe fun of it, and did not eat an ounce of their flesh.\r\n\r\nThese are examples of many stories which I might repeat, to show the\r\nravages of this destructive band. Many new devices for their extinction\r\nwere tried each year, but still they lived and throve in spite of all\r\nthe efforts of their foes. A great price was set on Lobo\'s head, and in\r\nconsequence poison in a score of subtle forms was put out for him, but\r\nhe never failed to detect and avoid it. One thing only he feared--that\r\nwas firearms, and knowing full well that all men in this region carried\r\nthem, he never was known to attack or face a human being. Indeed, the\r\nset policy of his band was to take refuge in flight whenever, in the\r\ndaytime, a man was descried, no matter at what distance. Lobo\'s habit of\r\npermitting the pack to eat only that which they themselves had killed,\r\nwas in numerous cases their salvation, and the keenness of his scent to\r\ndetect the taint of human hands or the poison itself, completed their\r\nimmunity.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion, one of the cowboys heard the too familiar rallying-cry\r\nof Old Lobo, and, stealthily approaching, he found the Currumpaw pack in\r\na hollow, where they had \'rounded\' up a small herd of cattle. Lobo sat\r\napart on a knoll, while Blanca with the rest was endeavoring to \'cut\r\nout\' a young cow, which they had selected; but the cattle were standing\r\nin a compact mass with their heads outward, and presented to the foe a\r\nline of horns, unbroken save when some cow, frightened by a fresh onset\r\nof the wolves, tried to retreat into the middle of the herd. It was only\r\nby taking advantage of these breaks that the wolves had succeeded at all\r\nin wounding the selected cow, but she was far from being disabled, and\r\nit seemed that Lobo at length lost patience with his followers, for he\r\nleft his position on the hill, and, uttering a deep roar, dashed toward\r\nthe herd. The terrified rank broke at his charge, and he sprang in among\r\nthem. Then the cattle scattered like the pieces of a bursting bomb. Away\r\nwent the chosen victim, but ere she had gone twenty-five yards Lobo was\r\nupon her. Seizing her by the neck, he suddenly held back with all his\r\nforce and so threw her heavily to the ground. The shock must have been\r\ntremendous, for the heifer was thrown heels over head. Lobo also turned\r\na somersault, but immediately recovered himself, and his followers\r\nfalling on the poor cow, killed her in a few seconds. Lobo took no part\r\nin the killing--after having thrown the victim, he seemed to say, "Now,\r\nwhy could not some of you have done that at once without wasting so much\r\ntime?"\r\n\r\nThe man now rode up shouting, the wolves as usual retired, and he,\r\nhaving a bottle of strychnine, quickly poisoned the carcass in three\r\nplaces, then went away, knowing they would return to feed, as they had\r\nkilled the animal themselves. But next morning, on going to look for\r\nhis expected victims, he found that, although the wolves had eaten the\r\nheifer, they had carefully cut out and thrown aside all those parts that\r\nhad been poisoned.\r\n\r\nThe dread of this great wolf spread yearly among the ranchmen, and\r\neach year a larger price was set on his head, until at last it reached\r\n$1,000, an unparalleled wolf-bounty, surely; many a good man has been\r\nhunted down for less, Tempted by the promised reward, a Texan ranger\r\nnamed Tannerey came one day galloping up the canyon of the Currumpaw. He\r\nhad a superb outfit for wolf-hunting--the best of guns and horses, and a\r\npack of enormous wolf-hounds. Far out on the plains of the Panhandle,\r\nhe and his dogs had killed many a wolf, and now he never doubted that,\r\nwithin a few days, Old Lobo\'s scalp would dangle at his saddlebow.\r\n\r\nAway they went bravely on their hunt in the gray dawn of a summer\r\nmorning, and soon the great dogs gave joyous tongue to say that they\r\nwere already on the track of their quarry. Within two miles, the grizzly\r\nband of Currumpaw leaped into view, and the chase grew fast and furious.\r\nThe part of the wolf-hounds was merely to hold the wolves at bay till\r\nthe hunter could ride up and shoot them, and this usually was easy on\r\nthe open plains of Texas; but here a new feature of the country came\r\ninto play, and showed how well Lobo had chosen his range; for the rocky\r\ncanyons of the Currumpaw and its tributaries intersect the prairies in\r\nevery direction. The old wolf at once made for the nearest of these\r\nand by crossing it got rid of the horseman. His band then scattered and\r\nthereby scattered the dogs, and when they reunited at a distant point\r\nof course all of the dogs did not turn up, and the wolves, no longer\r\noutnumbered, turned on their pursuers and killed or desperately wounded\r\nthem all. That night when Tannerey mustered his dogs, only six of them\r\nreturned, and of these, two were terribly lacerated. This hunter made\r\ntwo other attempts to capture the royal scalp, but neither of them was\r\nmore successful than the first, and on the last occasion his best horse\r\nmet its death by a fall; so he gave up the chase in disgust and went\r\nback to Texas, leaving Lobo more than ever the despot of the region.\r\n\r\nNext year, two other hunters appeared, determined to win the promised\r\nbounty. Each believed he could destroy this noted wolf, the first by\r\nmeans of a newly devised poison, which was to be laid out in an entirely\r\nnew manner; the other a French Canadian, by poison assisted with certain\r\nspells and charms, for he firmly believed that Lobo was a veritable\r\n"loup-garou," and could not be killed by ordinary means. But cunningly\r\ncompounded poisons, charms, and incantations were all of no avail\r\nagainst this grizzly devastator. He made his weekly rounds and daily\r\nbanquets as aforetime, and before many weeks had passed, Calone and\r\nLaloche gave up in despair and went elsewhere to hunt.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1893, after his unsuccessful attempt to capture Lobo,\r\nJoe Calone had a humiliating experience, which seems to show that the\r\nbig wolf simply scorned his enemies, and had absolute confidence in\r\nhimself. Calone\'s farm was on a small tributary of the Currumpaw, in a\r\npicturesque canyon, and among the rocks of this very canyon, within a\r\nthousand yards of the house, Old Lobo and his mate selected their den\r\nand raised their family that season. There they lived all summer and\r\nkilled Joe\'s cattle, sheep, and dogs, but laughed at all his poisons and\r\ntraps and rested securely among the recesses of the cavernous cliffs,\r\nwhile Joe vainly racked his brain for some method of smoking them out,\r\nor of reaching them with dynamite. But they escaped entirely unscathed,\r\nand continued their ravages as before. "There\'s where he lived all last\r\nsummer," said Joe, pointing to the face of the cliff, "and I couldn\'t do\r\na thing with him. I was like a fool to him."\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThis history, gathered so far from the cowboys, I found hard to\r\nbelieve until, in the fall of 1893, I made the acquaintance of the wily\r\nmarauder, and at length came to know him more thoroughly than anyone\r\nelse. Some years before, in the Bingo days, I had been a wolf-hunter,\r\nbut my occupations since then had been of another sort, chaining me to\r\nstool and desk. I was much in need of a change, and when a friend, who\r\nwas also a ranch-owner on the Currumpaw, asked me to come to New Mexico\r\nand try if I could do anything with this predatory pack, I accepted the\r\ninvitation and, eager to make the acquaintance of its king, was as soon\r\nas possible among the mesas of that region. I spent some time riding\r\nabout to learn the country, and at intervals my guide would point to the\r\nskeleton of a cow to which the hide still adhered, and remark, "That\'s\r\nsome of his work."\r\n\r\nIt became quite clear to me that, in this rough country, it was useless\r\nto think of pursuing Lobo with hounds and horses, so that poison or\r\ntraps were the only available expedients. At present we had no traps\r\nlarge enough, so I set to work with poison.\r\n\r\nI need not enter into the details of a hundred devices that I employed\r\nto circumvent this \'loup-garou\'; there was no combination of strychnine,\r\narsenic, cyanide, or prussic acid, that I did not essay; there was no\r\nmanner of flesh that I did not try as bait; but morning after morning,\r\nas I rode forth to learn the result, I found that all my efforts had\r\nbeen useless. The old king was too cunning for me. A single instance\r\nwill show his wonderful sagacity. Acting on the hint of an old trapper,\r\nI melted some cheese together with the kidney fat of a freshly killed\r\nheifer, stewing it in a china dish, and cutting it with a bone knife to\r\navoid the taint of metal.\r\n\r\nWhen the mixture was cool, I cut it into lumps, and making a hole in one\r\nside of each lump, I inserted a large dose of strychnine and cyanide,\r\ncontained, in a capsule that was impermeable by any odor; finally I\r\nsealed the holes up with pieces of the cheese itself. During the whole\r\nprocess, I wore a pair of gloves steeped in the hot blood of the heifer,\r\nand even avoided breathing on the baits. When all was ready, I put them\r\nin a raw-hide bag rubbed all over with blood, and rode forth dragging\r\nthe liver and kidneys of the beef at the end of a rope. With this I\r\nmade a ten-mile circuit, dropping a bait at each quarter of a mile, and\r\ntaking the utmost care, always, not to touch any with my hands.\r\n\r\nLobo, generally, came into this part of the range in the early part of\r\neach week, and passed the latter part, it was supposed, around the base\r\nof Sierra Grande. This was Monday, and that same evening, as we were\r\nabout to retire, I heard the deep bass howl of his majesty. On hearing\r\nit one of the boys briefly remarked, "There he is, we\'ll see."\r\n\r\nThe next morning I went forth, eager to know the result. I soon came\r\non the fresh trail of the robbers, with Lobo in the lead--his track was\r\nalways easily distinguished. An ordinary wolf\'s forefoot is 4 1/2 inches\r\nlong, that of a large wolf 4 3/4 inches, but Lobo\'s, as measured a\r\nnumber of times, was 5 1/2 inches from claw to heel; I afterward found\r\nthat his other proportions were commensurate, for he stood three feet\r\nhigh at the shoulder, and weighed 150 pounds. His trail, therefore,\r\nthough obscured by those of his followers, was never difficult to trace.\r\nThe pack had soon found the track of my drag, and as usual followed it.\r\nI could see that Lobo had come to the first bait, sniffed about it, and\r\nfinally had picked it up.\r\n\r\nThen I could not conceal my delight. "I\'ve got him at last," I\r\nexclaimed; "I shall find him stark within a mile," and I galloped on\r\nwith eager eyes fixed on the great broad track in the dust. It led me to\r\nthe second bait and that also was gone. How I exulted--I surely have\r\nhim now and perhaps several of his band. But there was the broad pawmark\r\nstill on the drag; and though I stood in the stirrup and scanned the\r\nplain I saw nothing that looked like a dead wolf. Again I followed--to\r\nfind now that the third bait was gone--and the king-wolf\'s track led\r\non to the fourth, there to learn that he had not really taken a bait\r\nat all, but had merely carried them in his mouth, Then having piled the\r\nthree on the fourth, he scattered filth over them to express his utter\r\ncontempt for my devices. After this he left my drag and went about his\r\nbusiness with the pack he guarded so effectively.\r\n\r\nThis is only one of many similar experiences which convinced me that\r\npoison would never avail to destroy this robber, and though I continued\r\nto use it while awaiting the arrival of the traps, it was only because\r\nit was meanwhile a sure means of killing many prairie wolves and other\r\ndestructive vermin.\r\n\r\nAbout this time there came under my observation an incident that will\r\nillustrate Lobo\'s diabolic cunning. These wolves had at least one\r\npursuit which was merely an amusement; it was stampeding and killing\r\nsheep, though they rarely ate them. The sheep are usually kept in flocks\r\nof from one thousand to three thousand under one or more shepherds. At\r\nnight they are gathered in the most sheltered place available, and a\r\nherdsman sleeps on each side of the flock to give additional protection.\r\nSheep are such senseless creatures that they are liable to be stampeded\r\nby the veriest trifle, but they have deeply ingrained in their nature\r\none, and perhaps only one, strong weakness, namely, to follow their\r\nleader. And this the shepherds turn to good account by putting half a\r\ndozen goats in the flock of sheep. The latter recognize the superior\r\nintelligence of their bearded cousins, and when a night alarm occurs\r\nthey crowd around them, and usually are thus saved from a stampede and\r\nare easily protected. But it was not always so. One night late in last\r\nNovember, two Perico shepherds were aroused by an onset of wolves. Their\r\nflocks huddled around the goats, which, being neither fools nor cowards,\r\nstood their ground and were bravely defiant; but alas for them, no\r\ncommon wolf was heading this attack. Old Lobo, the werewolf, knew as\r\nwell as the shepherds that the goats were the moral force of the flock,\r\nso, hastily running over the backs of the densely packed sheep, he\r\nfell on these leaders, slew them all in a few minutes, and soon had the\r\nluckless sheep stampeding in a thousand different directions. For weeks\r\nafterward I was almost daily accosted by some anxious shepherd, who\r\nasked, "Have you seen any stray OTO sheep lately?" and usually I was\r\nobliged to say I had; one day it was, "Yes, I came on some five or six\r\ncarcasses by Diamond Springs;" or another, it was to the effect that I\r\nhad seen a small "bunch" running on the Malpai Mesa; or again, "No, but\r\nJuan Meira saw about twenty, freshly killed, on the Cedra Monte two days\r\nago."\r\n\r\nAt length the wolf traps arrived, and with two men I worked a whole week\r\nto get them properly set out. We spared no labor or pains, I adopted\r\nevery device I could think of that might help to insure success. The\r\nsecond day after the traps arrived, I rode around to inspect, and soon\r\ncame upon Lobo\'s trail running from trap to trap. In the dust I could\r\nread the whole story of his doings that night. He had trotted along in\r\nthe darkness, and although the traps were so carefully concealed, he had\r\ninstantly detected the first one. Stopping the onward march of the pack,\r\nhe had cautiously scratched around it until he had disclosed the trap,\r\nthe chain, and the log, then left them wholly exposed to view with the\r\ntrap still unsprung, and passing on he treated over a dozen traps in the\r\nsame fashion. Very soon I noticed that he stopped and turned aside as\r\nsoon as he detected suspicious signs on the trail, and a new plan to\r\noutwit him at once suggested itself. I set the traps in the form of an\r\nH; that is, with a row of traps on each side of the trail, and one on\r\nthe trail for the cross-bar of the H. Before long, I had an opportunity\r\nto count another failure. Lobo came trotting along the trail, and was\r\nfairly between the parallel lines before he detected the single trap\r\nin the trail, but he stopped in time, and why or how he knew enough I\r\ncannot tell, the Angel of the wild things must have been with him, but\r\nwithout turning an inch to the right or left, he slowly and cautiously\r\nbacked on his own tracks, putting each paw exactly in its old track\r\nuntil he was off the dangerous ground. Then returning at one side he\r\nscratched clods and stones with his hind feet till he had sprung every\r\ntrap. This he did on many other occasions, and although I varied\r\nmy methods and redoubled my precautions, he was never deceived, his\r\nsagacity seemed never at fault, and he might have been pursuing his\r\ncareer of rapine to-day, but for an unfortunate alliance that proved\r\nhis ruin and added his name to the long list of heroes who, unassailable\r\nwhen alone, have fallen through the indiscretion of a trusted ally.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nOnce or twice, I had found indications that everything was not\r\nquite right in the Currumpaw pack. There were signs of irregularity,\r\nI thought; for instance there was clearly the trail of a smaller wolf\r\nrunning ahead of the leader, at times, and this I could not understand\r\nuntil a cowboy made a remark which explained the matter.\r\n\r\n"I saw them to-day," he said, "and the wild one that breaks away is\r\nBlanca." Then the truth dawned upon me, and I added, "Now, I know that\r\nBlanca is a she-wolf, because were a he-wolf to act thus, Lobo would\r\nkill him at once."\r\n\r\nThis suggested a new plan. I killed a heifer, and set one or two rather\r\nobvious traps about the carcass. Then cutting off the head, which is\r\nconsidered useless offal, and quite beneath the notice of a wolf, I set\r\nit a little apart and around it placed six powerful steel traps properly\r\ndeodorized and concealed with the utmost care. During my operations\r\nI kept my hands, boots, and implements smeared with fresh blood, and\r\nafterward sprinkled the ground with the same, as though it had flowed\r\nfrom the head; and when the traps were buried in the dust I brushed the\r\nplace over with the skin of a coyote, and with a foot of the same animal\r\nmade a number of tracks over the traps. The head was so placed that\r\nthere was a narrow passage between it and some tussocks, and in this\r\npassage I buried two of my best traps, fastening them to the head\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nWolves have a habit of approaching every carcass they get the wind of,\r\nin order to examine it, even when they have no intention of eating it,\r\nand I hoped that this habit would bring the Currumpaw pack within\r\nreach of my latest stratagem. I did not doubt that Lobo would detect my\r\nhandiwork about the meat, and prevent the pack approaching it, but I did\r\nbuild some hopes on the head, for it looked as though it had been thrown\r\naside as useless.\r\n\r\nNext morning, I sallied forth to inspect the traps, and there, oh, joy!\r\nwere the tracks of the pack, and the place where the beef-head and its\r\ntraps had been was empty. A hasty study of the trail showed that Lobo\r\nhad kept the pack from approaching the meat, but one, a small wolf, had\r\nevidently gone on to examine the head as it lay apart and had walked\r\nright into one of the traps.\r\n\r\nWe set out on the trail, and within a mile discovered that the hapless\r\nwolf was Blanca. Away she went, however, at a gallop, and although\r\nencumbered by the beef-head, which weighed over fifty pounds, she\r\nspeedily distanced my companion, who was on foot. But we overtook her\r\nwhen she reached the rocks, for the horns of the cow\'s head became\r\ncaught and held her fast. She was the handsomest wolf I had ever seen.\r\nHer coat was in perfect condition and nearly white.\r\n\r\nShe turned to fight, and, raising her voice in the rallying cry of her\r\nrace, sent a long howl rolling over the canyon. From far away upon the\r\nmesa came a deep response, the cry of Old Lobo. That was her last call,\r\nfor now we had closed in on her, and all her energy and breath were\r\ndevoted to combat.\r\n\r\nThen followed the inevitable tragedy, the idea of which I shrank from\r\nafterward more than at the time. We each threw a lasso over the neck of\r\nthe doomed wolf, and strained our horses in opposite directions until\r\nthe blood burst from her mouth, her eyes glazed, her limbs stiffened\r\nand then fell limp. Homeward then we rode, carrying the dead wolf, and\r\nexulting over this, the first death-blow we had been able to inflict on\r\nthe Currumpaw pack.\r\n\r\nAt intervals during the tragedy, and afterward as we rode homeward, we\r\nheard the roar of Lobo as he wandered about on the distant mesas, where\r\nhe seemed to be searching for Blanca. He had never really deserted\r\nher, but, knowing that he could not save her, his deep-rooted dread of\r\nfirearms had been too much for him when he saw us approaching. All that\r\nday we heard him wailing as he roamed in his quest, and I remarked at\r\nlength to one of the boys, "Now, indeed, I truly know that Blanca was\r\nhis mate."\r\n\r\nAs evening fell he seemed to be coming toward the home canyon, for his\r\nvoice sounded continually nearer.\r\n\r\nThere was an unmistakable note of sorrow in it now. It was no longer\r\nthe loud, defiant howl, but a long, plaintive wail; "Blanca! Blanca!"\r\nhe seemed to call. And as night came down, I noticed that he was not far\r\nfrom the place where we had overtaken her. At length he seemed to find\r\nthe trail, and when he came to the spot where we had killed her, his\r\nheartbroken wailing was piteous to hear. It was sadder than I could\r\npossibly have believed. Even the stolid cowboys noticed it, and said\r\nthey had "never heard a wolf carry on like that before." He seemed to\r\nknow exactly what had taken place, for her blood had stained the place\r\nof her death.\r\n\r\nThen he took up the trail of the horses and followed it to the\r\nranch-house. Whether in hopes of finding her there, or in quest of\r\nrevenge, I know not, but the latter was what he found, for he surprised\r\nour unfortunate watchdog outside and tore him to little bits within\r\nfifty yards of the door. He evidently came alone this time, for I found\r\nbut one trail next morning, and he had galloped about in a reckless\r\nmanner that was very unusual with him. I had half expected this, and had\r\nset a number of additional traps about the pasture. Afterward I found\r\nthat he had indeed fallen into one of these, but, such was his strength,\r\nhe had torn himself loose and cast it aside.\r\n\r\nI believed that he would continue in the neighborhood until he found her\r\nbody at least, so I concentrated all my energies on this one enterprise\r\nof catching him before he left the region, and while yet in this\r\nreckless mood. Then I realized what a mistake I had made in killing\r\nBlanca, for by using her as a decoy I might have secured him the next\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nI gathered in all the traps I could command, one hundred and thirty\r\nstrong steel wolf-traps, and set them in fours in every trail that led\r\ninto the canyon; each trap was separately fastened to a log, and each\r\nlog was separately buried. In burying them, I carefully removed the sod\r\nand every particle of earth that was lifted we put in blankets, so that\r\nafter the sod was replaced and all was finished the eye could detect no\r\ntrace of human handiwork. When the traps were concealed I trailed the\r\nbody of poor Blanca over each place, and made of it a drag that circled\r\nall about the ranch, and finally I took off one of her paws and made\r\nwith it a line of tracks over each trap. Every precaution and device\r\nknown to me I used, and retired at a late hour to await the result.\r\n\r\nOnce during the night I thought I heard Old Lobo, but was not sure of\r\nit. Next day I rode around, but darkness came on before I completed the\r\ncircuit of the north canon, and I had nothing to report. At supper one\r\nof the cowboys said, "There was a great row among the cattle in the\r\nnorth canyon this morning, maybe there is something in the traps there."\r\nIt was afternoon of the next day before I got to the place referred to,\r\nand as I drew near a great grizzly form arose from the ground, vainly\r\nendeavoring to escape, and there revealed before me stood Lobo, King\r\nof the Currumpaw, firmly held in the traps. Poor old hero, he had never\r\nceased to search for his darling, and when he found the trail her body\r\nhad made he followed it recklessly, and so fell into the snare prepared\r\nfor him. There he lay in the iron grasp of all four traps, perfectly\r\nhelpless, and all around him were numerous tracks showing how the cattle\r\nhad gathered about him to insult the fallen despot, without daring\r\nto approach within his reach. For two days and two nights he had lain\r\nthere, and now was worn out with struggling. Yet, when I went near him,\r\nhe rose up with bristling mane and raised his voice, and for the last\r\ntime made the canyon reverberate with his deep bass roar, a call for\r\nhelp, the muster call of his band. But there was none to answer him,\r\nand, left alone in his extremity, he whirled about with all his strength\r\nand made a desperate effort to get at me. All in vain, each trap was a\r\ndead drag of over three hundred pounds, and in their relentless fourfold\r\ngrasp, with great steel jaws on every foot, and the heavy logs and\r\nchains all entangled together, he was absolutely powerless. How his\r\nhuge ivory tusks did grind on those cruel chains, and when I ventured to\r\ntouch him with my rifle-barrel he left grooves on it which are there to\r\nthis day. His eyes glared green with hate and fury, and his jaws\r\nsnapped with a hollow \'chop,\' as he vainly endeavored to reach me and my\r\ntrembling horse. But he was worn out with hunger and struggling and loss\r\nof blood, and he soon sank exhausted to the ground.\r\n\r\nSomething like compunction came over me, as I prepared to deal out to\r\nhim that which so many had suffered at his hands.\r\n\r\n"Grand old outlaw, hero of a thousand lawless raids, in a few minutes\r\nyou will be but a great load of carrion. It cannot be otherwise." Then I\r\nswung my lasso and sent it whistling over his head. But not so fast; he\r\nwas yet far from being subdued, and before the supple coils had fallen\r\non his neck he seized the noose and, with one fierce chop, cut through\r\nits hard thick strands, and dropped it in two pieces at his feet.\r\n\r\nOf course I had my rifle as a last resource, but I did not wish to spoil\r\nhis royal hide, so I galloped back to the camp and returned with a cowboy\r\nand a fresh lasso. We threw to our victim a stick of wood which he\r\nseized in his teeth, and before he could relinquish it our lassoes\r\nwhistled through the air and tightened on his neck.\r\n\r\nYet before the light had died from his fierce eyes, I cried, "Stay,\r\nwe will not kill him; let us take him alive to the camp." He was so\r\ncompletely powerless now that it was easy to put a stout stick through\r\nhis mouth, behind his tusks, and then lash his jaws with a heavy cord\r\nwhich was also fastened to the stick. The stick kept the cord in, and\r\nthe cord kept the stick in so he was harmless. As soon as he felt his\r\njaws were tied he made no further resistance, and uttered no sound, but\r\nlooked calmly at us and seemed to say, "Well, you have got me at last,\r\ndo as you please with me." And from that time he took no more notice of\r\nus.\r\n\r\nWe tied his feet securely, but he never groaned, nor growled, nor turned\r\nhis head. Then with our united strength we were just able to put him on\r\nmy horse. His breath came evenly as though sleeping, and his eyes\r\nwere bright and clear again, but did not rest on us. Afar on the great\r\nrolling mesas they were fixed, his passing kingdom, where his famous\r\nband was now scattered. And he gazed till the pony descended the pathway\r\ninto the canyon, and the rocks cut off the view.\r\n\r\nBy travelling slowly we reached the ranch in safety, and after securing\r\nhim with a collar and a strong chain, we staked him out in the pasture\r\nand removed the cords.\r\n\r\nThen for the first time I could examine him closely, and proved how\r\nunreliable is vulgar report when a living hero or tyrant is concerned.\r\nHe had not a collar of gold about his neck, nor was there on his\r\nshoulders an inverted cross to denote that he had leagued himself with\r\nSatan. But I did find on one haunch a great broad scar, that tradition\r\nsays was the fang-mark of Juno, the leader of Tannerey\'s wolf-hounds--a\r\nmark which she gave him the moment before he stretched her lifeless on\r\nthe sand of the canyon.\r\n\r\nI set meat and water beside him, but he paid no heed. He lay calmly on\r\nhis breast, and gazed with those steadfast yellow eyes away past me down\r\nthrough the gateway of the canyon, over the open plains--his plains--nor\r\nmoved a muscle when I touched him. When the sun went down he was still\r\ngazing fixedly across the prairie. I expected he would call up his band\r\nwhen night came, and prepared for them, but he had called once in his\r\nextremity, and none had come; he would never call again.\r\n\r\nA lion shorn of his strength, an eagle robbed of his freedom, or a dove\r\nbereft of his mate, all die, it is said, of a broken heart; and who will\r\naver that this grim bandit could bear the three-fold brunt, heart-whole?\r\nThis only I know, that when the morning dawned, he was lying there still\r\nin his position of calm repose, his body unwounded, but his spirit was\r\ngone--the old kingwolf was dead.\r\n\r\nI took the chain from his neck, a cowboy helped me to carry him to the\r\nshed where lay the remains of Blanca, and as we laid him beside her,\r\nthe cattle-man exclaimed: "There, you would come to her, now you are\r\ntogether again."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSILVERSPOT, The Story of a Crow\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nHOW MANY of us have ever got to know a wild animal? I do not mean merely\r\nto meet with one once or twice, or to have one in a cage, but to really\r\nknow it for a long time while it is wild, and to get an insight into its\r\nlife and history. The trouble usually is to know one creature from his\r\nfellow. One fox or crow is so much like another that we cannot be sure\r\nthat it really is the same next time we meet. But once in awhile there\r\narises an animal who is stronger or wiser than his fellow, who becomes a\r\ngreat leader, who is, as we would say, a genius, and if he is bigger, or\r\nhas some mark by which men can know him, he soon becomes famous in his\r\ncountry, and shows us that the life of a wild animal may be far more\r\ninteresting and exciting than that of many human beings.\r\n\r\nOf this class were Courtant, the bob-tailed wolf that terrorized\r\nthe whole city of Paris for about ten years in the beginning of the\r\nfourteenth century; Clubfoot, the lame grizzly bear that left such\r\na terrific record in the San Joaquin Valley of California; Lobo, the\r\nking-wolf of New Mexico, that killed a cow every day for five years,\r\nand the Seonee panther that in less than two years killed nearly three\r\nhundred human beings--and such also was Silverspot, whose history, so\r\nfar as I could learn it, I shall now briefly tell.\r\n\r\nSilverspot was simply a wise old crow; his name was given because of\r\nthe silvery white spot that was like a nickel, stuck on his right side,\r\nbetween the eye and the bill, and it was owing to this spot that I was\r\nable to know him from the other crows, and put together the parts of his\r\nhistory that came to my knowledge.\r\n\r\nCrows are, as you must know, our most intelligent birds.--\'Wise as an\r\nold crow\' did not become a saying without good reason. Crows know the\r\nvalue of organization, and are as well drilled as soldiers--very much\r\nbetter than some soldiers, in fact, for crows are always on duty, always\r\nat war, and always dependent on each other for life and safety. Their\r\nleaders not only are the oldest and wisest of the band, but also the\r\nstrongest and bravest, for they must be ready at any time with sheer\r\nforce to put down an upstart or a rebel. The rank and file are the\r\nyoungsters and the crows without special gifts.\r\n\r\nOld Silverspot was the leader of a large band of crows that made\r\ntheir headquarters near Toronto, Canada, in Castle Frank, which is a\r\npine-clad hill on the northeast edge of the city. This band numbered\r\nabout two hundred, and for reasons that I never understood did not\r\nincrease. In mild winters they stayed along the Niagara River; in cold\r\nwinters they went much farther south. But each year in the last week of\r\nFebruary, Old Silverspot would muster his followers and boldly cross the\r\nforty miles of open water that lies between Toronto and Niagara; not,\r\nhowever, in a straight line would he go, but always in a curve to\r\nthe west, whereby he kept in sight of the familiar landmark of Dundas\r\nMountain, until the pine-clad hill itself came in view. Each year he\r\ncame with his troop, and for about six weeks took up his abode on\r\nthe hill. Each morning thereafter the crows set out in three bands to\r\nforage. One band went southeast to Ashbridge\'s Bay. One went north up\r\nthe Don, and one, the largest, went northwestward up the ravine. The\r\nlast, Silverspot led in person. Who led the others I never found out.\r\n\r\nOn calm mornings they flew high and straight away. But when it was\r\nwindy the band flew low, and followed the ravine for shelter. My windows\r\noverlooked the ravine, and it was thus that in 1885 I first noticed this\r\nold crow. I was a newcomer in the neighborhood, but an old resident\r\nsaid to me then "that there old crow has been a-flying up and down this\r\nravine for more than twenty years." My chances to watch were in the\r\nravine, and Silverspot doggedly clinging to the old route, though now\r\nit was edged with houses and spanned by bridges, became a very familiar\r\nacquaintance. Twice each day in March and part of April, then again\r\nin the late summer and the fall, he passed and repassed, and gave me\r\nchances to see his movements, and hear his orders to his bands, and so,\r\nlittle by little, opened my eyes to the fact that the crows, though a\r\nlittle people, are of great wit, a race of birds with a language and a\r\nsocial system that is wonderfully human in many of its chief points, and\r\nin some is better carried out than our own.\r\n\r\nOne windy day I stood on the high bridge across the ravine, as the old\r\ncrow, heading his long, straggling troop, came flying down homeward.\r\nHalf a mile away I could hear the contented \'All\'s well, come right\r\nalong!\' as we should say, or as he put it, and as also his lieutenant\r\nechoed it at the rear of the band. They were flying very low to be out\r\nof the wind, and would have to rise a little to clear the bridge on\r\nwhich I was. Silverspot saw me standing there, and as I was closely\r\nwatching him he didn\'t like it. He checked his flight and called out,\r\n\'Be on your guard,\' and rose much higher in the air. Then seeing that I\r\nwas not armed he flew over my head about twenty feet, and his followers\r\nin turn did the same, dipping again to the old level when past the\r\nbridge.\r\n\r\nNext day I was at the same place, and as the crows came near I raised my\r\nwalking stick and pointed it at them. The old fellow at once cried out\r\n\'Danger,\' and rose fifty feet higher than before. Seeing that it was not\r\na gun, he ventured to fly over. But on the third day I took with me a\r\ngun, and at once he cried out, \'Great danger--a gun.\' His lieutenant\r\nrepeated the cry, and every crow in the troop began to tower and scatter\r\nfrom the rest, till they were far above gun shot, and so passed safely\r\nover, coming down again to the shelter of the valley when well beyond\r\nreach. Another time, as the long, straggling troop came down the valley,\r\na red-tailed hawk alighted on a tree close by their intended route. The\r\nleader cried out, \'Hawk, hawk,\' and stayed his flight, as did each crow\r\non nearing him, until all were massed in a solid body. Then, no longer\r\nfearing the hawk, they passed on. But a quarter of a mile farther on\r\na man with a gun appeared below, and the cry, \'Great danger--a gun,\r\na--gun; scatter fur your lives,\' at once caused them to scatter widely\r\nand tower till far beyond range. Many others of his words of command I\r\nlearned in the course of my long acquaintance, and found that sometimes\r\na very little difference in the sound makes a very great difference in\r\nmeaning. Thus while No. 5 means hawk, or any large, dangerous bird, this\r\nmeans \'wheel around,\' evidently a combination of No. 5, whose root idea\r\nis danger, and of No. 4, whose root idea is retreat, and this again is a\r\nmere \'good day,\' to a far away comrade. This is usually addressed to the\r\nranks and means \'attention.\'\r\n\r\nEarly in April there began to be great doings among the crows. Some new\r\ncause of excitement seemed to have come on them. They spent half the\r\nday among the pines, instead of foraging from dawn till dark. Pairs\r\nand trios might be seen chasing each other, and from time to time they\r\nshowed off in various feats of flight. A favorite sport was to dart down\r\nsuddenly from a great height toward some perching crow, and just before\r\ntouching it to turn at a hairbreadth and rebound in the air so fast\r\nthat the wings of the swooper whirred with a sound like distant thunder.\r\nSometimes one crow would lower his head, raise every feather, and coming\r\nclose to another would gurgle out a long note like. What did it all\r\nmean? I soon learned. They were making love and pairing off. The males\r\nwere showing off their wing powers and their voices to the lady crows.\r\nAnd they must have been highly appreciated, for by the middle of April\r\nall had mated and had scattered over the country for their honeymoon,\r\nleaving the sombre old pines of Castle Frank deserted and silent.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe Sugar Loaf hill stands alone in the Don Valley. It is still covered\r\nwith woods that join with those of Castle Frank, a quarter of a mile\r\noff in the woods, between the two hills, is a pine-tree in whose top\r\nis a deserted hawk\'s nest. Every Toronto school-boy knows the nest, and,\r\nexcepting that I had once shot a black squirrel on its edge, no one had\r\never seen a sign of life about it. There it was year after year, ragged\r\nand old, and falling to pieces. Yet, strange to tell, in all that time\r\nit never did drop to pieces, like other old nests.\r\n\r\nOne morning in May I was out at gray dawn, and stealing gently through\r\nthe woods, whose dead leaves were so wet that no rustle was made. I\r\nchanced to pass under the old nest, and was surprised to see a black\r\ntail sticking over the edge. I struck the tree a smart blow, off flew a\r\ncrow, and the secret was out. I had long suspected that a pair of\r\ncrows nested each year about the pines, but now I realized that it was\r\nSilverspot and his wife. The old nest was theirs, and they were too wise\r\nto give it an air of spring-cleaning and housekeeping each year. Here\r\nthey had nested for long, though guns in the hands of men and boys\r\nhungry to shoot crows were carried under their home every day. I never\r\nsurprised the old fellow again, though I several times saw him through\r\nmy telescope.\r\n\r\nOne day while watching I saw a crow crossing the Don Valley with\r\nsomething white in his beak. He flew to the mouth of the Rosedale Brook,\r\nthen took a short flight to the Beaver Elm. There he dropped the white\r\nobject, and looking about gave me a chance to recognize my old friend\r\nSilverspot. After a minute he picked up the white thing--a shell--and\r\nwalked over past the spring, and here, among the docks and the\r\nskunk-cabbages, he unearthed a pile of shells and other white, shiny\r\nthings. He spread them out in the sun, turned them over, turned them one\r\nby one in his beak, dropped them, nestled on them as though they were\r\neggs, toyed with them and gloated over them like a miser. This was his\r\nhobby, his weakness. He could not have explained why he enjoyed them,\r\nany more than a boy can explain why he collects postage-stamps, or a\r\ngirl why she prefers pearls to rubies; but his pleasure in them was very\r\nreal, and after half an hour he covered them all, including the new\r\none, with earth and leaves, and flew off. I went at once to the spot\r\nand examined the hoard; there was about a hatfull in all, chiefly white\r\npebbles, clam-shells, and some bits of tin, but there was also the\r\nhandle of a china cup, which must have been the gem of the collection.\r\nThat was the last time I saw them. Silverspot knew that I had found his\r\ntreasures, and he removed them at once; where, I never knew.\r\n\r\nDuring the space that I watched him so closely he had many little\r\nadventures and escapes. He was once severely handled by a sparrowhawk,\r\nand often he was chased and worried by kingbirds. Not that these did him\r\nmuch harm, but they were such noisy pests that he avoided their company\r\nas quickly as possible, just as a grown man avoids a conflict with a\r\nnoisy and impudent small boy. He had some cruel tricks, too. He had a\r\nway of going the round of the small birds\' nests each morning to eat the\r\nnew laid eggs, as regularly as a doctor visiting his patients. But we\r\nmust not judge him for that, as it is just what we ourselves do to the\r\nhens in the barnyard.\r\n\r\nHis quickness of wit was often shown. One day I saw him flying down the\r\nravine with a large piece of bread in his bill. The stream below him was\r\nat this time being bricked over as a sewer. There was one part of two\r\nhundred yards quite finished, and, as he flew over the open water just\r\nabove this, the bread fell from his bill, and was swept by the current\r\nout of sight into the tunnel. He flew down and peered vainly into\r\nthe dark cavern, then, acting upon a happy thought, he flew to the\r\ndownstream end of the tunnel, and awaiting the reappearance of the\r\nfloating bread, as it was swept onward by the current, he seized and\r\nbore it off in triumph.\r\n\r\nSilverspot was a crow of the world. He was truly a successful crow. He\r\nlived in a region that, though full of dangers, abounded with food. In\r\nthe old, unrepaired nest he raised a brood each year with his wife,\r\nwhom, by the way, I never could distinguish, and when the crows again\r\ngathered together he was their acknowledged chief.\r\n\r\nThe reassembling takes place about the end of June--the young crows with\r\ntheir bob-tails, soft wings, and falsetto voices are brought by their\r\nparents, whom they nearly equal in size, and introduced to society at\r\nthe old pine woods, a woods that is at once their fortress and college.\r\nHere they find security in numbers and in lofty yet sheltered perches,\r\nand here they begin their schooling and are taught all the secrets of\r\nsuccess in crow life, and in crow life the least failure does not simply\r\nmean begin again. It means death.\r\n\r\nThe first week or two after their arrival is spent by the young ones in\r\ngetting acquainted, for each crow must know personally all the others in\r\nthe band. Their parents meanwhile have time to rest a little after the\r\nwork of raising them, for now the youngsters are able to feed themselves\r\nand roost on a branch in a row, just like big folks.\r\n\r\nIn a week or two the moulting season comes. At this time the old crows\r\nare usually irritable and nervous, but it does not stop them from\r\nbeginning to drill the youngsters, who, of course, do not much enjoy the\r\npunishment and nagging they get so soon after they have been mamma\'s own\r\ndarlings. But it is all for their good, as the old lady said when she\r\nskinned the eels, and old Silverspot is an excellent teacher. Sometimes\r\nhe seems to make a speech to them. What he says I cannot guess, but\r\njudging by the way they receive it, it must be extremely witty. Each\r\nmorning there is a company drill, for the young ones naturally drop into\r\ntwo or three squads according to their age and strength. The rest of the\r\nday they forage with their parents.\r\n\r\nWhen at length September comes we find a great change. The rabble of\r\nsilly little crows have begun to learn sense. The delicate blue iris of\r\ntheir eyes, the sign of a fool-crow, has given place to the dark brown\r\neye of the old stager. They know their drill now and have learned sentry\r\nduty. They have been taught guns and traps and taken a special course in\r\nwireworms and green-corn. They know that a fat old farmer\'s wife is much\r\nless dangerous, though so much larger, than her fifteen-year-old son,\r\nand they can tell the boy from his sister. They know that an umbrella is\r\nnot a gun, and they can count up to six, which is fair for young crows,\r\nthough Silverspot can go up nearly to thirty. They know the smell of\r\ngunpowder and the south side of a hemlock-tree, and begin to plume\r\nthemselves upon being crows of the world. They always fold their wings\r\nthree times after alighting, to be sure that it is neatly done. They\r\nknow how to worry a fox into giving up half his dinner, and also that\r\nwhen the kingbird or the purple martin assails them they must dash into\r\na bush, for it is as impossible to fight the little pests as it is for\r\nthe fat apple-woman to catch the small boys who have raided her basket.\r\nAll these things do the young crows know; but they have taken no lessons\r\nin egg-hunting yet, for it is not the season. They are unacquainted with\r\nclams, and have never tasted horses\' eyes, or seen sprouted corn, and\r\nthey don\'t know a thing about travel, the greatest educator of all. They\r\ndid not think of that two months ago, and since then they have thought\r\nof it, but have learned to wait till their betters are ready.\r\n\r\nSeptember sees a great change in the old crows, too, Their moulting is\r\nover. They are now in full feather again and proud of their handsome\r\ncoats. Their health is again good, and with it their tempers are\r\nimproved. Even old Silverspot, the strict teacher, becomes quite jolly,\r\nand the youngsters, who have long ago learned to respect him, begin\r\nreally to love him.\r\n\r\nHe has hammered away at drill, teaching them all the signals and words\r\nof command in use, and now it is a pleasure to see them in the early\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n\'Company I!\' the old chieftain would cry in crow, and Company I would\r\nanswer with a great clamor.\r\n\r\n\'Fly!\' and himself leading them, they would all fly straight forward.\r\n\r\n\'Mount!\' and straight upward they turned in a moment.\r\n\r\n\'Bunch!\' and they all massed into a dense black flock.\r\n\r\n\'Scatter!\' and they spread out like leaves before the wind.\r\n\r\n\'Form line!\' and they strung out into the long line of ordinary flight.\r\n\r\n\'Descend!\' and they all dropped nearly to the ground.\r\n\r\n\'Forage!\' and they alighted and scattered about to feed, while two of\r\nthe permanent sentries mounted duty--one on a tree to the right, the\r\nother on a mound to the far left. A minute or two later Silverspot\r\nwould cry out, \'A man with a gun!\' The sentries repeated the cry and\r\nthe company flew at once in open order as quickly as possible toward the\r\ntrees. Once behind these, they formed line again in safety and returned\r\nto the home pines.\r\n\r\nSentry duty is not taken in turn by all the crows, but a certain number\r\nwhose watchfulness has been often proved are the perpetual sentries, and\r\nare expected to watch and forage at the same time. Rather hard on them\r\nit seems to us, but it works well and the crow organization is admitted\r\nby all birds to be the very best in existence.\r\n\r\nFinally, each November sees the troop sail away southward to learn new\r\nmodes of life, new landmarks and new kinds of food, under the guidance\r\nof the everwise Silverspot.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThere is only one time when a crow is a fool, and that is at night.\r\nThere is only one bird that terrifies the crow, and that is the owl.\r\nWhen, therefore, these come together it is a woeful thing for the sable\r\nbirds. The distant hoot of an owl after dark is enough to make them\r\nwithdraw their heads from under their wings, and sit trembling and\r\nmiserable till morning. In very cold weather the exposure of their faces\r\nthus has often resulted in a crow having one or both of his eyes frozen,\r\nso that blindness followed and therefore death. There are no hospitals\r\nfor sick crows.\r\n\r\nBut with the morning their courage comes again, and arousing themselves\r\nthey ransack the woods for a mile around till they find that owl, and if\r\nthey do not kill him they at least worry him half to death and drive him\r\ntwenty miles away.\r\n\r\nIn 1893 the crows had come as usual to Castle Frank. I was walking in\r\nthese woods a few days afterward when I chanced upon the track of a\r\nrabbit that had been running at full speed over the snow and dodging\r\nabout among the trees as though pursued. Strange to tell, I could see no\r\ntrack of the pursuer. I followed the trail and presently saw a drop of\r\nblood on the snow, and a little farther on found the partly devoured\r\nremains of a little brown bunny. What had killed him was a mystery until\r\na careful search showed in the snow a great double-toed track and a\r\nbeautifully pencilled brown feather. Then all was clear--a horned owl.\r\nHalf an hour later, in passing again by the place, there, in a tree,\r\nwithin ten feet of the bones of his victim, was the fierce-eyed owl\r\nhimself. The murderer still hung about the scene of his crime. For once\r\ncircumstantial evidence had not lied. At my approach he gave a guttural\r\n\'grrr-oo\' and flew off with low flagging flight to haunt the distant\r\nsombre woods.\r\n\r\nTwo days afterward, at dawn, there was a great uproar among the crows.\r\nI went out early to see, and found some black feathers drifting over the\r\nsnow. I followed up the wind in the direction from which they came and\r\nsoon saw the bloody remains of a crow and the great double-toed track\r\nwhich again told me that the murderer was the owl. All around were signs\r\nof the struggle, but the fell destroyer was too strong. The poor crow\r\nhad been dragged from his perch at night, when the darkness bad put him\r\nat a hopeless disadvantage.\r\n\r\nI turned over the remains, and by chance unburied the head--then started\r\nwith an exclamation of sorrow. Alas! It was the head of old Silverspot.\r\nHis long life of usefulness to his tribe was over--slain at last by the\r\nowl that he had taught so many hundreds of young crows to beware of.\r\n\r\nThe old nest on the Sugar Loaf is abandoned now. The crows still come\r\nin spring-time to Castle Frank, but without their famous leader their\r\nnumbers are dwindling, and soon they will be seen no more about the old\r\npine-grove in which they and their forefathers had lived and learned for\r\nages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRAGGYLUG, The Story of a Cottontail Rabbit\r\n\r\nRAGGYLUG, or Rag, was the name of a young cottontail rabbit. It was\r\ngiven him from his torn and ragged ear, a life-mark that he got in his\r\nfirst adventure. He lived with his mother in Olifant\'s Swamp, where I\r\nmade their acquaintance and gathered, in a hundred different ways, the\r\nlittle bits of proof and scraps of truth that at length enabled me to\r\nwrite this history.\r\n\r\nThose who do not know the animals well may think I have humanized them,\r\nbut those who have lived so near them as to know somewhat of their ways\r\nand their minds will not think so.\r\n\r\nTruly rabbits have no speech as we understand it, but they have a way of\r\nconveying ideas by a system of sounds, signs, scents, whisker-touches,\r\nmovements, and example that answers the purpose of speech; and it must\r\nbe remembered that though in telling this story I freely translate from\r\nrabbit into English, I repeat nothing that they did not say.\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe rank swamp grass bent over and concealed the snug nest where\r\nRaggylug\'s mother had hidden him. She had partly covered him with some\r\nof the bedding, and, as always, her last warning was to lie low and say\r\nnothing, whatever happens. Though tucked in bed, he was wide awake and\r\nhis bright eyes were taking in that part of his little green world that\r\nwas straight above. A bluejay and a red-squirrel, two notorious thieves,\r\nwere loudly berating each other for stealing, and at one time Rag\'s\r\nhome bush was the centre of their fight; a yellow warbler caught a blue\r\nbutterfly but six inches from his nose, and a scarlet and black ladybug,\r\nserenely waving her knobbed feelers, took a long walk up one grass-blade,\r\ndown another, and across the nest and over Rag\'s face--and yet he never\r\nmoved nor even winked.\r\n\r\nAfter a while he heard a strange rustling of the leaves in the near\r\nthicket. It was an odd, continuous sound, and though it went this way\r\nand that way and came ever nearer, there was no patter of feet with it.\r\nRag had lived his whole life in the Swamp (he was three weeks old) and\r\nyet had never heard anything like this. Of course his curiosity was\r\ngreatly aroused. His mother had cautioned him to lie low, but that\r\nwas understood to be in case of danger, and this strange sound without\r\nfootfalls could not be anything to fear.\r\n\r\nThe low rasping went past close at hand, then to the right, then back,\r\nand seemed going away. Rag felt he knew what he was about; he wasn\'t\r\na baby; it was his duty to learn what it was. He slowly raised his\r\nrolypoly body on his short fluffy legs, lifted his little round head\r\nabove the covering of his nest and peeped out into the woods. The sound\r\nhad ceased as soon as he moved. He saw nothing, so took one step forward\r\nto a clear view, and instantly found himself face to face with an\r\nenormous Black Serpent.\r\n\r\n"Mammy," he screamed in mortal terror as the monster darted at him. With\r\nall the strength of his tiny limbs he tried to run. But in a flash the\r\nSnake had him by one ear and whipped around him with his coils to gloat\r\nover the helpless little baby bunny he had secured for dinner.\r\n\r\n"Mam-my--Mam-my," gasped poor little Raggylug as the cruel monster began\r\nslowly choking him to death. Very soon the little one\'s cry would have\r\nceased, but bounding through the woods straight as an arrow came Mammy.\r\nNo longer a shy, helpless little Molly Cottontail, ready to fly from\r\na shadow: the mother\'s love was strong in her. The cry of her baby had\r\nfilled her with the courage of a hero, and--hop, she went over that\r\nhorrible reptile. Whack, she struck down at him with her sharp hind\r\nclaws as she passed, giving him such a stinging blow that he squirmed\r\nwith pain and hissed with anger.\r\n\r\n"M-a-m-my," came feebly from the little one. And Mammy came leaping\r\nagain and again and struck harder and fiercer until the loathsome\r\nreptile let go the little one\'s ear and tried to bite the old one as\r\nshe leaped over. But all he got was a mouthful of wool each time, and\r\nMolly\'s fierce blows began to tell, as long bloody rips were torn in the\r\nBlack Snake\'s scaly armor.\r\n\r\nThings were now looking bad for the Snake; and bracing himself for the\r\nnext charge, he lost his tight hold on Baby Bunny, who at once wriggled\r\nout of the coils and away into the underbrush, breathless and terribly\r\nfrightened, but unhurt save that his left ear was much torn by the teeth\r\nof that dreadful Serpent.\r\n\r\nMolly now had gained all she wanted. She had no notion of fighting\r\nfor glory or revenge. Away she went into the woods and the little one\r\nfollowed the shining beacon of her snow-white tail until she led him to\r\na safe corner of the Swamp.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nOld Olifant\'s Swamp was a rough, brambly tract of second-growth woods,\r\nwith a marshy pond and a stream through the middle. A few ragged\r\nremnants of the old forest still stood in it and a few of the still\r\nolder trunks were lying about as dead logs in the brushwood. The land\r\nabout the pond was of that willow-grown sedgy kind that cats and horses\r\navoid, but that cattle do not fear. The drier zones were overgrown with\r\nbriars and young trees. The outermost belt of all, that next the fields,\r\nwas of thrifty, gummy-trunked young pines whose living needles in air\r\nand dead ones on earth offer so delicious an odor to the nostrils of the\r\npasser-by, and so deadly a breath to those seedlings that would compete\r\nwith them for the worthless waste they grow on.\r\n\r\nAll around for a long way were smooth fields, and the only wild tracks\r\nthat ever crossed these fields were those of a thoroughly bad and\r\nunscrupulous fox that lived only too near.\r\n\r\nThe chief indwellers of the swamp were Molly and Rag. Their nearest\r\nneighbors were far away, and their nearest kin were dead. This was their\r\nhome, and here they lived together, and here Rag received the training\r\nthat made his success in life.\r\n\r\nMolly was a good little mother and gave him a careful bringing up. The\r\nfirst thing he learned was to lie low and say nothing. His adventure\r\nwith the snake taught him the wisdom of this. Rag never forgot that\r\nlesson; afterward he did as he was told, and it made the other things\r\ncome more easily.\r\n\r\nThe second lesson he learned was \'freeze.\' It grows out of the first,\r\nand Rag was taught it as soon as he could run.\r\n\r\n\'Freezing\' is simply doing nothing, turning into a statue. As soon as he\r\nfinds a foe near, no matter what he is doing, a well-trained Cottontail\r\nkeeps just as he is and stops all movement, for the creatures of the\r\nwoods are of the same color as the things in the woods and catch the eye\r\nonly while moving. So when enemies chance together, the one who first\r\nsees the other can keep himself unseen by \'freezing\' and thus have all\r\nthe advantage of choosing the time for attack or escape. Only those who\r\nlive in the woods know the importance of this; every wild creature and\r\nevery hunter must learn it; all learn to do it well, but not one of them\r\ncan beat Molly Cottontail in the doing. Rag\'s mother taught him this\r\ntrick by example. When the white cotton cushion that she always carried\r\nto sit on went bobbing away through the woods, of course Rag ran his\r\nhardest to keep up. But when Molly stopped and \'froze,\' the natural wish\r\nto copy made him do the same.\r\n\r\nBut the best lesson of all that Rag learned from his mother was the\r\nsecret of the Brierbrush. It is a very old secret now, and to make it\r\nplain you must first hear why the Brierbrush quarrelled with the beasts.\r\n\r\nLong ago the Roses used to grow on bushes that had no thorns. But the\r\nSquirrels and Mice used to climb after them, the Cattle used to knock\r\nthem off with their horns, the Possum would twitch them off with his\r\nlong tail, and the Deer, with his sharp hoofs, would break them down.\r\nSo the Brierbrush armed itself with spikes to protect its roses and\r\ndeclared eternal war on all creatures that climbed trees, or had horns,\r\nor hoofs, or long tails. This left the Brierbrush at peace with none but\r\nMolly Cottontail, who could not climb, was hornless, hoofless, and had\r\nscarcely any tail at all.\r\n\r\nIn truth the Cottontail had never harmed a Brierrose, and having now so\r\nmany enemies the Rose took the Rabbit into especial friendship, and when\r\ndangers are threatening poor Bunny he flies to the nearest Brierbrush,\r\ncertain that it is ready with a million keen and poisoned daggers to\r\ndefend him.\r\n\r\nSo the secret that Rag learned from his mother was, "The Brierbrush is\r\nyour best friend."\r\n\r\nMuch of the time that season was spent in learning the lay of the land,\r\nand the bramble and brier mazes. And Rag learned them so well that he\r\ncould go all around the swamp by two different ways and never leave the\r\nfriendly briers at any place for more than five hops.\r\n\r\nIt is not long since the foes of the Cottontails were disgusted to find\r\nthat man had brought a new kind of bramble and planted it in long lines\r\nthroughout the country. It was so strong that no creatures could break\r\nit down, and so sharp that the toughest skin was torn by it. Each year\r\nthere was more of it and each year it became a more serious matter to\r\nthe wild creatures. But Molly Cottontail had no fear of it. She was not\r\nbrought up in the briers for nothing. Dogs and foxes, cattle and sheep,\r\nand even man himself might be torn by those fearful spikes: but Molly\r\nunderstands it and lives and thrives under it. And the further it\r\nspreads the more safe country there is for the Cottontail. And the name\r\nof this new and dreaded bramble is--the barbed-wire fence.\r\n\r\n III\r\n\r\nMolly had no other children to look after now, so Rag had all her\r\ncare. He was unusually quick and bright as well as strong, and he had\r\nuncommonly good chances; so he got on remarkably well.\r\n\r\nAll the season she kept him busy learning the tricks of the trail, and\r\nwhat to eat and drink and what not to touch. Day by day she worked\r\nto train him; little by little she taught him, putting into his mind\r\nhundreds of ideas that her own life or early training had stored in\r\nhers, and so equipped him with the knowledge that makes life possible to\r\ntheir kind.\r\n\r\nClose by her side in the clover-field or the thicket he would sit and\r\ncopy her when she wobbled her nose \'to keep her smeller clear,\' and pull\r\nthe bite from her mouth or taste her lips to make sure he was getting\r\nthe same kind of fodder. Still copying her, he learned to comb his ears\r\nwith his claws and to dress his coat and to bite the burrs out of his\r\nvest and socks. He learned, too, that nothing but clear dewdrops from\r\nthe briers were fit for a rabbit to drink, as water which has once\r\ntouched the earth must surely bear some taint. Thus he began the study\r\nof woodcraft, the oldest of all sciences.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Rag was big enough to go out alone, his mother taught him the\r\nsignal code. Rabbits telegraph each other by thumping on the ground with\r\ntheir hind feet. Along the ground sound carries far; a thump that at six\r\nfeet from the earth is not heard at twenty yards will, near the ground,\r\nbe heard at least one hundred yards. Rabbits have very keen hearing, and\r\nso might hear this same thump at two hundred yards, and that would reach\r\nfrom end to end of Olifant\'s Swamp. A single thump means \'look out\'\r\nor \'freeze.\' A slow thump thump means \'come.\' A fast thump thump means\r\n\'danger\'; and a very fast thump thump thump means \'run for dear life.\'\r\n\r\nAt another time, when the weather was fine and the bluejays were\r\nquarrelling among themselves, a sure sign that no dangerous foe was\r\nabout, Rag began a new study. Molly, by flattening her ears, gave\r\nthe sign to squat. Then she ran far away in the thicket and gave the\r\nthumping signal for \'come.\' Rag set out at a run to the place but could\r\nnot find Molly. He thumped, but got no reply. Setting carefully about\r\nhis search he found her foot-scent and, following this strange guide,\r\nthat the beasts all know so well and man does not know at all, he worked\r\nout the trail and found her where she was hidden. Thus he got his first\r\nlesson in trailing, and thus it was that the games of hide and seek they\r\nplayed became the schooling for the serious chase of which there was so\r\nmuch in his after life.\r\n\r\nBefore that first season of schooling was over he had learnt all the\r\nprincipal tricks by which a rabbit lives and in not a few problems\r\nshowed himself a veritable genius.\r\n\r\nHe was an adept at \'tree,\' \'dodge,\' and \'squat,\' he could play\r\n\'log-lump,\' with \'wind\' and \'baulk\' with \'back-track\' so well that he\r\nscarcely needed any other tricks. He had not yet tried it, but he knew\r\njust how to play \'barb-wire,\' which is a new trick of the brilliant\r\norder; he had made a special study of \'sand,\' which burns up all scent,\r\nand was deeply versed in \'change-off,\' \'fence,\' and \'double\' as well as\r\n\'hole-up,\' which is a trick requiring longer notice, and yet he never\r\nforgot that \'lie-low\' is the beginning of all wisdom and \'brierbrush\'\r\nthe only trick that is always safe.\r\n\r\nHe was taught the signs by which to know all his foes and then the way\r\nto baffle them. For hawks, owls, foxes, hounds, curs, minks, weasels,\r\ncats, skunks, coons, and--men, each have a different plan of pursuit,\r\nand for each and all of these evils he was taught a remedy.\r\n\r\nAnd for knowledge of the enemy\'s approach he learnt to depend first\r\non himself and his mother, and then on the bluejay. "Never neglect the\r\nbluejay\'s warning," said Molly; "he is a mischief-maker, a marplot, and\r\na thief all the time, but nothing escapes him. He wouldn\'t mind harming\r\nus, but he cannot, thanks to the briers, and his enemies are ours, so\r\nit is well to heed him. If the woodpecker cries a warning you can trust\r\nhim, he is honest; but he is a fool beside the bluejay, and though the\r\nbluejay often tells lies for mischief you are safe to believe him when\r\nhe brings ill news."\r\n\r\nThe barb-wire trick takes a deal of nerve and the best of legs. It was\r\nlong before Rag ventured to play it, but as he came to his full powers\r\nit became one of his favorites.\r\n\r\n"It\'s fine play for those who can do it," said Molly. "First you lead\r\noff your dog on a straightaway and warm him up a bit by nearly letting\r\nhim catch you. Then keeping just one hop ahead, you lead him at a long\r\nslant full tilt into a breast-high barb-wire. I\'ve seen many a dog and\r\nfox crippled, and one big hound killed outright this way. But I\'ve also\r\nseen more than one rabbit lose his life in trying it."\r\n\r\nRag early learnt what some rabbits never learn at all, that \'hole-up\' is\r\nnot such a fine ruse as it seems; it may be the certain safety of a wise\r\nrabbit, but soon or late is a sure death-trap to a fool. A young rabbit\r\nalways thinks of it first, an old rabbit never tries it till all others\r\nfail. It means escape from a man or dog, a fox or a bird of prey, but it\r\nmeans sudden death if the foe is a ferret, mink, skunk, or weasel.\r\n\r\nThere were but two ground-holes in the Swamp. One on the Sunning Bank,\r\nwhich was a dry sheltered knoll in the South-end. It was open and\r\nsloping to the sun, and here on fine days the Cottontails took their\r\nsun-baths. They stretched out among the fragrant pine needles and\r\nwinter-green in odd cat-like positions, and turned slowly over as though\r\nroasting and wishing all sides well done. And they blinked and panted,\r\nand squirmed as if in dreadful pain; yet this was one of the keenest\r\nenjoyments they knew.\r\n\r\nJust over the brow of the knoll was a large pine stump. Its grotesque\r\nroots wriggled out above the yellow sand-bank like dragons, and under\r\ntheir protecting claws a sulky old woodchuck had digged a den long ago.\r\n\r\nHe became more sour and ill-tempered as weeks went by, and one day\r\nwaited to quarrel with Olifant\'s dog instead of going in so that Molly\r\nCottontail was able to take possession of the den an hour later.\r\n\r\nThis, the pine-root hole, was afterward very coolly taken by a\r\nself-sufficient young skunk who with less valor might have enjoyed\r\ngreater longevity, for he imagined--that even man with a gun would fly\r\nfrom him. Instead of keeping Molly from the den for good, therefore, his\r\nreign, like that of a certain Hebrew king, was over in seven days.\r\n\r\nThe other, the fern-hole, was in a fern thicket next the clover field.\r\nIt was small and damp, and useless except as a last retreat. It also\r\nwas the work of a woodchuck, a well-meaning friendly neighbor, but\r\na harebrained youngster whose skin in the form of a whiplash was now\r\ndeveloping higher horse-power in the Olifant working team.\r\n\r\n"Simple justice," said the old man, "for that hide was raised on stolen\r\nfeed that the team would a\' turned into horse-power anyway."\r\n\r\nThe Cottontails were now sole owners of the holes, and did not go near\r\nthem when they could help it, lest anything like a path should be made\r\nthat might betray these last retreats to an enemy. There was also the\r\nhollow hickory, which, though nearly fallen, was still green, and had\r\nthe great advantage of being open at both ends. This had long been the\r\nresidence of one Lotor, a solitary old coon whose ostensible calling was\r\nfrog-hunting, and who, like the monks of old, was supposed to abstain\r\nfrom all flesh food. But it was shrewdly suspected that he needed but\r\na chance to indulge in a diet of rabbit. When at last one dark night he\r\nwas killed while raiding Olifant\'s henhouse, Molly, so far from feeling\r\na pang of regret, took possession of his cosy nest with a sense of\r\nunbounded relief.\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nBright August sunlight was flooding the Swamp in the morning. Everything\r\nseemed soaking in the warm radiance. A little brown swamp-sparrow was\r\nteetering on a long rush in the pond. Beneath him there were open spaces\r\nof dirty water that brought down a few scraps of the blue sky, and\r\nworked it and the yellow duck-weed into an exquisite mosaic, with a\r\nlittle wrong-side picture of the bird in the middle. On the bank behind\r\nwas a great vigorous growth of golden green skunk-cabbage, that cast\r\ndense shadow over the brown swamp tussocks.\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the swamp-sparrow were not trained to take in the color\r\nglories, but he saw what we might have missed; that two of the\r\nnumberless leafy brown bumps under the broad cabbage-leaves were\r\nfurry living things, with noses that never ceased to move up and down,\r\nwhatever else was still.\r\n\r\nIt was Molly and Rag. They were stretched under the skunk-cabbage, not\r\nbecause they liked its rank smell, but because the winged ticks could\r\nnot stand it at all and so left them in peace.\r\n\r\nRabbits have no set time for lessons, they are always learning; but what\r\nthe lesson is depends on the present stress, and that must arrive before\r\nit is known. They went to this place for a quiet rest, but had not been\r\nlong there when suddenly a warning note from the ever-watchful bluejay\r\ncaused Molly\'s nose and ears to go up and her tail to tighten to her\r\nback. Away across the Swamp was Olifant\'s big black and white dog,\r\ncoming straight toward them.\r\n\r\n"Now," said Molly, "squat while I go and keep that fool out of\r\nmischief." Away she went to meet him and she fearlessly dashed across\r\nthe dog\'s path.\r\n\r\n"Bow-ow-ow," he fairly yelled as he bounded after Molly, but she kept\r\njust beyond his reach and led him where the million daggers struck fast\r\nand deep, till his tender ears were scratched raw, and guided him at\r\nlast plump into a hidden barbed-wire fence, where he got such a gashing\r\nthat he went homeward howling with pain. After making a short double,\r\na loop and a baulk in case the dog should come back, Molly returned to\r\nfind that Rag in his eagerness was standing bolt upright and craning his\r\nneck to see the sport.\r\n\r\nThis disobedience made her so angry that she struck him with her hind\r\nfoot and knocked him over in the mud.\r\n\r\nOne day as they fed on the near clover field a red-tailed hawk came\r\nswooping after them. Molly kicked up her hind legs to make fun of him\r\nand skipped into the briers along one of their old pathways, where\r\nof course the hawk could not follow. It was the main path from the\r\nCreekside Thicket to the Stove-pipe brushpile. Several creepers had\r\ngrown across it, and Molly, keeping one eye on the hawk, set to work and\r\ncut the creepers off. Rag watched her, then ran on ahead, and cut some\r\nmore that were across the path. "That\'s right," said Molly, "always keep\r\nthe runways clear, you will need them often enough. Not wide, but clear.\r\nCut everything like a creeper across them and some day you will find you\r\nhave cut a snare." "A what?" asked Rag, as he scratched his right ear\r\nwith his left hind foot.\r\n\r\n"A snare is something that looks like a creeper, but it doesn\'t grow and\r\nit\'s worse than all the hawks in the world," said Molly, glancing at the\r\nnow far-away red-tail, "for there it hides night and day in the runway\r\ntill the chance to catch you comes."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe it could catch me," said Rag, with the pride of youth\r\nas he rose on his heels to rub his chin and whiskers high up on a smooth\r\nsapling. Rag did not know he was doing this, but his mother saw and knew\r\nit was a sign, like the changing of a boy\'s voice, that her little one\r\nwas no longer a baby but would soon be a grown-up Cottontail.\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThere is magic in running water. Who does not know it and feel it? The\r\nrailroad builder fearlessly throws his bank across the wide bog or lake,\r\nor the sea itself, but the tiniest ril of running water he treats with\r\ngreat respect, studies its wish and its way and gives it all it seems to\r\nask. The thirst-parched traveller in the poisonous alkali deserts holds\r\nback in deadly fear from the sedgy ponds till he finds one down whose\r\ncentre is a thin, clear line, and a faint flow, the sign of running,\r\nliving water, and joyfully he drinks.\r\n\r\nThere is magic in running water, no evil spell can cross it. Tam\r\nO\'Shanter proved its potency in time of sorest need. The wild-wood\r\ncreature with its deadly foe following tireless on the trail scent,\r\nrealizes its nearing doom and feels an awful spell. Its strength is\r\nspent, its every trick is tried in vain till the good Angel leads it\r\nto the water, the running, living water, and dashing in it follows the\r\ncooling stream, and then with force renewed--takes to the woods again.\r\n\r\nThere is magic in running water. The hounds come to the very spot and\r\nhalt and cast about; and halt and cast in vain. Their spell is broken by\r\nthe merry stream, and the wild thing lives its life.\r\n\r\nAnd this was one of the great secrets that Raggylug learned from his\r\nmother--"after the Brierrose, the Water is your friend."\r\n\r\nOne hot, muggy night in August, Molly led Rag through the woods. The\r\ncotton-white cushion she wore under her tail twinkled ahead and was his\r\nguiding lantern, though it went out as soon as she stopped and sat on\r\nit. After a few runs and stops to listen, they came to the edge of the\r\npond. The hylas in the trees above them were singing \'sleep, sleep,\'\r\nand away out on a sunken log in the deep water, up to his chin in the\r\ncooling bath, a bloated bullfrog was singing the praises of a \'jug o\'\r\nrum.\'\r\n\r\n"Follow me still," said Molly, in rabbit, and \'flop\' she went into the\r\npond and struck out for the sunken log in the middle. Rag flinched but\r\nplunged with a little \'ouch,\' gasping and wobbling his nose very fast\r\nbut still copying his mother. The same movements as on land sent him\r\nthrough the water, and thus he found he could swim, On he went till he\r\nreached the sunken log and scrambled up by his dripping mother on the\r\nhigh dry end, with a rushy screen around them and the Water that\r\ntells no tales. After this on warm black nights when that old fox from\r\nSpringfield came prowling through the Swamp, Rag would note the place of\r\nthe bullfrog\'s voice, for in case of direst need it might be a guide\r\nto safety. And thenceforth the words of the song that the bullfrog sang\r\nwere \'Come, come, in danger come.\'\r\n\r\nThis was the latest study that Rag took up with his mother--it was\r\nreally a post-graduate course, for many little rabbits never learn it at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nNo wild animal dies of old age. Its life has soon or late a tragic end.\r\nIt is only a question of how long it can hold out against its foes. But\r\nRag\'s life was proof that once a rabbit passes out of his youth he is\r\nlikely to outlive his prime and be killed only in the last third of\r\nlife, the downhill third we call old age.\r\n\r\nThe Cottontails had enemies on every side. Their daily life was a\r\nseries of escapes. For dogs, foxes, cats, skunks, coons, weasels, minks,\r\nsnakes, hawks, owls, and men, and even insects were all plotting to kill\r\nthem. They had hundreds of adventures, and at least once a day they had\r\nto fly for their lives and save themselves by their legs and wits.\r\n\r\nMore than once that hateful fox from Springfield drove them to taking\r\nrefuge under the wreck of a barbedwire hog-pen by the spring. But once\r\nthere they could look calmly at him while he spiked his legs in vain\r\nattempts to reach them.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice Rag when hunted had played off the hound against a skunk\r\nthat had seemed likely to be quite as dangerous as the dog.\r\n\r\nOnce he was caught alive by a hunter who had a hound and a ferret to\r\nhelp him. But Rag had the luck to escape next day, with a yet deeper\r\ndistrust of ground holes. He was several times run into the water by the\r\ncat, and many times was chased by hawks and owls, but for each kind\r\nof danger there was a safeguard. His mother taught him the principal\r\ndodges, and he improved on them and made many new ones as he grew older.\r\nAnd the older and wiser he grew the less he trusted to his legs, and the\r\nmore to his wits for safety.\r\n\r\nRanger was the name of a young hound in the neighborhood. To train him\r\nhis master used to put him on the trail of one of the Cottontails. It\r\nwas nearly always Rag that they ran, for the young buck enjoyed the runs\r\nas much as they did, the spice of danger in them being just enough for\r\nzest. He would say:\r\n\r\n"Oh, mother! here comes the dog again, I must have a run to-day."\r\n\r\n"You are too bold, Raggy, my son!" she might reply. "I fear you will\r\nrun once too often."\r\n\r\n"But, mother, it is such glorious fun to tease that fool dog, and it\'s\r\nall good training. I\'ll thump if I am too hard pressed, then you can\r\ncome and change off while I get my second wind."\r\n\r\nOn he would come, and Ranger would take the trail and follow till Rag\r\ngot tired of it. Then he either sent a thumping telegram for help, which\r\nbrought Molly to take charge of the dog, or he got rid of the dog by\r\nsome clever trick. A description of one of these shows how well Rag had\r\nlearned the arts of the woods.\r\n\r\nHe knew that his scent lay best near the ground, and was strongest when\r\nhe was warm. So if he could get off the ground, and be left in peace for\r\nhalf an hour to cool off, and for the trail to stale, he knew he\r\nwould be safe. When, therefore, he tired of the chase, he made for the\r\nCreekside brier-patch, where he \'wound\'--that is, zig-zagged--till he\r\nleft a course so crooked that the dog was sure to be greatly delayed in\r\nworking it out. He then went straight to D in the woods, passing one hop\r\nto windward of the high log E. Stopping at D, he followed his back trail\r\nto F; here he leaped aside and ran toward G. Then, returning on his\r\ntrail to J, he waited till the hound passed on his trail at I. Rag then\r\ngot back on his old trail at H, and followed it to E, where, with a\r\nscentbaulk or great leap aside, he reached the high log, and running to\r\nits higher end, he sat like a bump.\r\n\r\nRanger lost much time in the bramble maze, and the scent was very poor\r\nwhen he got it straightened out, and came to D. Here he began to circle\r\nto pick it up, and after losing much time, struck the trail which ended\r\nsuddenly at G. Again he was at fault, and had to circle to find the\r\ntrail. Wider and wider circles, until at last, he passed right under the\r\nlog Rag was on. But a cold scent, on a cold day, does not go downward\r\nmuch. Rag never budged nor winked, and the hound passed.\r\n\r\nAgain the dog came round. This time he crossed the low part of the log,\r\nand stopped to smell it. \'Yes, clearly it was rabbity,\' but it was a\r\nstale scent now; still he mounted the log.\r\n\r\nIt was a trying moment for Rag, as the great hound came sniff-sniffing\r\nalong the log. But his nerve did not forsake him; the wind was right; he\r\nhad his mind made up to bolt as soon as Ranger came half way up. But he\r\ndidn\'t come. A yellow cur would have seen the rabbit sitting there, but\r\nthe hound did not, and the scent seemed stale, so he leaped off the log,\r\nand Rag had won.\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nRag had never seen any other rabbit than his mother. Indeed he had\r\nscarcely thought about there being any other. He was more and more away\r\nfrom her now, and yet he never felt lonely, for rabbits do not hanker\r\nfor company. But one day in December, while he was among the red dogwood\r\nbrush, cutting a new path to the great Creekside thicket, he saw all\r\nat once against the sky over the Sunning Bank the head and ears of a\r\nstrange rabbit. The newcomer had the air of a well-pleased discoverer\r\nand soon came hopping Rag\'s way along one of his paths into his Swamp.\r\nA new feeling rushed over him, that boiling mixture of anger and hatred\r\ncalled jealousy.\r\n\r\nThe stranger stopped at one of Rag\'s rubbing-trees--that is, a tree\r\nagainst which he used to stand on his heels and rub his chin as far up\r\nas he could reach. He thought he did this simply because he liked it;\r\nbut all buckrabbits do so, and several ends are served. It makes the\r\ntree rabbity, so that other rabbits know that this swamp already belongs\r\nto a rabbit family and is not open for settlement. It also lets the next\r\none know by the scent if the last caller was an acquaintance, and the\r\nheight from the ground of the rubbing-places shows how tall the rabbit\r\nis.\r\n\r\nNow to his disgust Rag noticed that the new-comer was a head taller\r\nthan himself, and a big, stout buck at that. This was a wholly new\r\nexperience and filled Rag with a wholly new feeling. The spirit of\r\nmurder entered his heart; he chewed very hard at nothing in his mouth,\r\nand hopping forward onto a smooth piece of hard ground he struck slowly:\r\n\r\n\'Thump--thump--thump,\' which is a rabbit telegram for \'Get out of my\r\nswamp, or fight.\'\r\n\r\nThe new-comer made a big V with his ears, sat upright for a few\r\nseconds, then, dropping on his fore-feet, sent along the ground a\r\nlouder, stronger, \'Thump--thump--thump.\'\r\n\r\nAnd so war was declared.\r\n\r\nThey came together by short runs side-wise, each one trying to get the\r\nwind of the other and watching for a chance advantage. The stranger was\r\na big, heavy buck with plenty of muscle, but one or two trifles such as\r\ntreading on a turnover and failing to close when Rag was on low ground\r\nshowed that he had not much cunning and counted on winning his battles\r\nby his weight. On he came at last and Rag met him like a little fury. As\r\nthey came together they leaped up and struck out with their hind feet.\r\nThud, thud they came, and down went poor little Rag. In a moment the\r\nstranger was on him with his teeth and Rag was bitten, and lost several\r\ntufts of hair before he could get up. But he was swift of foot and got\r\nout of reach. Again he charged and again he was knocked down and bitten\r\nseverely. He was no match for his foe, and it soon became a question of\r\nsaving his own life.\r\n\r\nHurt as he was, he sprang away, with the stranger in full chase, and\r\nbound to kill him as well as to oust him from the Swamp where he was\r\nborn. Rag\'s legs were good and so was his wind. The stranger was big and\r\nso heavy that he soon gave up the chase, and it was well for poor Rag\r\nthat he did, for he was getting stiff from his wounds as well as tired.\r\nFrom that day began a reign of terror for Rag. His training had been\r\nagainst owls, dogs, weasels, men, and so on, but what to do when chased\r\nby another rabbit, he did not know. All he knew was to lie low till he\r\nwas found, then run.\r\n\r\nPoor little Molly was completely terrorized; she could not help Rag and\r\nsought only to hide. But the big buck soon found her out. She tried to\r\nrun from him, but she was not now so swift as Rag. The stranger made no\r\nattempt to kill her, but he made love to her, and because she hated\r\nhim and tried to get away, he treated her shamefully. Day after day he\r\nworried her by following her about, and often, furious at her lasting\r\nhatred, he would knock her down and tear out mouthfuls of her soft fur\r\ntill his rage cooled somewhat, when he would let her go for a while. But\r\nhis fixed purpose was to kill Rag, whose escape seemed hopeless. There\r\nwas no other swamp he could go to, and whenever he took a nap now he had\r\nto be ready at any moment to dash for his life. A dozen times a day\r\nthe big stranger came creeping up to where he slept, but each time the\r\nwatchful Rag awoke in time to escape. To escape yet not to escape. He\r\nsaved his life indeed, but oh! what a miserable life it had become. How\r\nmaddening to be thus helpless, to see his little mother daily beaten\r\nand torn, as well as to see all his favorite feeding-grounds, the cosy\r\nnooks, and the pathways he had made with so much labor, forced from him\r\nby this hateful brute. Unhappy Rag realized that to the victor belong\r\nthe spoils, and he hated him more than ever he did fox or ferret.\r\n\r\nHow was it to end? He was wearing out with running and watching and bad\r\nfood, and little Molly\'s strength and spirit were breaking down under\r\nthe long persecution. The stranger was ready to go to all lengths to\r\ndestroy poor Rag, and at last stooped to the worst crime known among\r\nrabbits. However much they may hate each other, all good rabbits forget\r\ntheir feuds when their common enemy appears. Yet one day when a great\r\ngoshawk came swooping over the Swamp, the stranger, keeping well under\r\ncover himself, tried again and again to drive Rag into the open.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice the hawk nearly had him, but still the briers saved him,\r\nand it was only when the big buck himself came near being caught that he\r\ngave it up. And again Rag escaped, but-was no better off. He made up his\r\nmind to leave, with his mother, if possible, next night and go into the\r\nworld in quest of some new home when he heard old Thunder, the hound,\r\nsniffing and searching about the outskirts of the swamp, and he resolved\r\non playing a desperate game. He deliberately crossed the hound\'s view,\r\nand the chase that then began was fast and furious. Thrice around the\r\nSwamp they went till Rag had made sure that his mother was hidden safely\r\nand that his hated foe was in his usual nest. Then right into that nest\r\nand plump over him he jumped, giving him a rap with one hind foot as he\r\npassed over his head.\r\n\r\n"You miserable fool, I\'ll kill you yet," cried the stranger, and up he\r\njumped only to find himself between Rag and the dog and heir to all the\r\nperil of the chase.\r\n\r\nOn came the hound baying hotly on the straight-away scent. The buck\'s\r\nweight and size were great advantages in a rabbit fight, but now they\r\nwere fatal. He did not know many tricks. Just the simple ones like\r\n\'double,\' \'wind,\' and \'hole-up,\' that every baby Bunny knows. But the\r\nchase was too close for doubling and winding, and he didn\'t know where\r\nthe holes were.\r\n\r\nIt was a straight race. The brierrose, kind to all rabbits alike,\r\ndid its best, but it was no use. The baying of the hound was fast and\r\nsteady. The crashing of the brush and the yelping of the hound each time\r\nthe briers tore his tender ears were borne to the two rabbits where\r\nthey crouched in hiding. But suddenly these sounds stopped, there was a\r\nscuffle, then loud and terrible screaming. Rag knew what it meant and it\r\nsent a shiver through him, but he soon forgot that when all was over and\r\nrejoiced to be once more the master of the dear old Swamp.\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nOld Olifant had doubtless a right to burn all those brush-piles in\r\nthe east and south of the Swamp and to clear up the wreck of the old\r\nbarbed-wire hog-pen just below the spring. But it was none the less\r\nhard on Rag and his mother. The first were their various residences and\r\noutposts, and the second their grand fastness and safe retreat.\r\n\r\nThey had so long held the Swamp and felt it to be their very own in\r\nevery part and suburb--including Olifant\'s grounds and buildings--that\r\nthey would have resented the appearance of another rabbit even about the\r\nadjoining barnyard.\r\n\r\nTheir claim, that of long, successful occupancy, was exactly the same as\r\nthat by which most nations hold their land, and it would be hard to find\r\na better right.\r\n\r\nDuring the time of the January thaw the Olifants had cut the rest of the\r\nlarge wood about the pond and curtailed the Cottontails\' domain on all\r\nsides. But they still clung to the dwindling Swamp, for it was their\r\nhome and they were loath to move to foreign parts. Their life of daily\r\nperils went on, but they were still fleet of foot, long of wind, and\r\nbright of wit. Of late they had been somewhat troubled by a mink that\r\nhad wandered upstream to their quiet nook. A little judicious guidance\r\nhad transferred the uncomfortable visitor to Olifant\'s hen-house. But\r\nthey were not yet quite sure that he had been properly looked after.\r\nSo for the present they gave up using the ground-holes, which were, of\r\ncourse, dangerous blind-alleys, and stuck closer than ever to the briers\r\nand the brush-piles that were left.\r\n\r\nThat first snow had quite gone and the weather was bright and warm until\r\nnow. Molly, feeling a touch of rheumatism, was somewhere in the lower\r\nthicket seeking a teaberry tonic. Rag was sitting in the weak sunlight\r\non a bank in the east side. The smoke from the familiar gable chimney\r\nof Olifant\'s house came fitfully drifting a pale blue haze through the\r\nunderwoods and showing as a dull brown against the brightness of the\r\nsky. The sun-gilt gable was cut off midway by the banks of brier brush,\r\nthat, purple in shadow, shone like rods of blazing crimson and gold in\r\nthe light. Beyond the house the barn with its gable and roof, new gift\r\nat the house, stood up like a Noah\'s ark.\r\n\r\nThe sounds that came from it, and yet more the delicious smell that\r\nmingled with the smoke, told Rag that the animals were being fed cabbage\r\nin the yard. Rag\'s mouth watered at the idea of the feast. He blinked and\r\nblinked as he snuffed its odorous promises, for he loved cabbage dearly.\r\nBut then he had been to the barnyard the night before after a few paltry\r\nclover-tops, and no wise rabbit would go two nights running to the same\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nTherefore he did the wise thing. He moved across where he could not\r\nsmell the cabbage and made his supper of a bundle of hay that had been\r\nblown from the stack. Later, when about to settle for the night, he was\r\njoined by Molly, who had taken her teaberry and then eaten her frugal\r\nmeal of sweet birch near the Sunning Bank.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the sun had gone about his business elsewhere, taking all\r\nhis gold and glory with him. Off in the east a big black shutter came\r\npushing up and rising higher and higher; it spread over the whole sky,\r\nshut out all light and left the world a very gloomy place indeed. Then\r\nanother mischief-maker, the wind, taking advantage of the sun\'s absence,\r\ncame on the scene and set about brewing trouble. The weather turned\r\ncolder and colder; it seemed worse than when the ground had been\r\ncovered with snow.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t this terribly cold? How I wish we had our stove-pipe brush-pile,"\r\nsaid Rag.\r\n\r\n"A good night for the pine-root hole," replied Molly, "but we have not\r\nyet seen the pelt of that mink on the end of the barn, and it is not\r\nsafe till we do."\r\n\r\nThe hollow hickory was gone--in fact at this very moment its trunk,\r\nlying in the wood-yard, was harboring the mink they feared. So the\r\nCottontails hopped to the south side of the pond and, choosing a\r\nbrush-pile, they crept under and snuggled down for the night, facing\r\nthe wind but with their noses in different directions so as to go out\r\ndifferent ways in case of alarm. The wind blew harder and colder as the\r\nhours went by, and about midnight a fine icy snow came ticking down on\r\nthe dead leaves and hissing through the brush-heap. It might seem a poor\r\nnight for hunting, but that old fox from Springfield was out. He came\r\npointing up the wind in the shelter of the Swamp and chanced in the lee\r\nof the brush-pile, where he scented the sleeping Cotton-tails. He halted\r\nfor a moment, then came stealthily sneaking up toward the brush under\r\nwhich his nose told him the rabbits were crouching. The noise of the\r\nwind and the sleet enabled him to come quite close before Molly\r\nheard the faint crunch of a dry leaf under his paw. She touched Rag\'s\r\nwhiskers, and both were fully awake just as the fox sprang on them; but\r\nthey always slept with their legs ready for a jump. Molly darted out\r\ninto the blinding storm. The fox missed his spring but followed like a\r\nracer, while Rag dashed off to one side.\r\n\r\nThere was only one road for Molly; that was straight up the wind, and\r\nbounding for her life she gained a little over the unfrozen mud that\r\nwould not carry the fox, till she reached the margin of the pond. No\r\nchance to turn now, on she must go.\r\n\r\nSplash! splash! through the weeds she went, then plunge into the deep\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nAnd plunge went the fox close behind. But it was too much for Reynard\r\non such a night. He turned back, and Molly, seeing only one course,\r\nstruggled through the reeds into the deep water and struck out for the\r\nother shore. But there was a strong headwind. The little waves, icy\r\ncold, broke over her head as she swam, and the water was full of snow\r\nthat blocked her way like soft ice, or floating mud. The dark line of\r\nthe other shore seemed far, far away, with perhaps the fox waiting for\r\nher there.\r\n\r\nBut she laid her ears flat to be out of the gale, and bravely put forth\r\nall her strength with wind and tide against her. After a long, weary\r\nswim in the cold water, she had nearly reached the farther reeds when a\r\ngreat mass of floating snow barred her road; then the wind on the bank\r\nmade strange, fox-like sounds that robbed her of all force, and she was\r\ndrifted far backward before she could get free from the floating bar.\r\n\r\nAgain she struck out, but slowly--oh so slowly now. And when at last she\r\nreached the lee of the tall reeds, her limbs were numbed, her strength\r\nspent, her brave little heart was sinking, and she cared no more whether\r\nthe fox were there or not. Through the reeds she did indeed pass, but\r\nonce in the weeds her course wavered and slowed, her feeble strokes\r\nno longer sent her landward, the ice forming around her stopped her\r\naltogether. In a little while the cold, weak limbs ceased to move, the\r\nfurry nose-tip of the little mother Cottontail wobbled no more, and the\r\nsoft brown eyes were closed in death.\r\n\r\nBut there was no fox waiting to tear her with ravenous jaws. Rag had\r\nescaped the first onset of the foe, and as soon as he regained his wits\r\nhe came running back to change-off and so help his mother. He met the\r\nold fox going round the pond to meet Molly and led him far and away,\r\nthen dismissed him with a barbed-wire gash on his head, and came to the\r\nbank and sought about and trailed and thumped, but all his searching was\r\nin vain; he could not find his little mother. He never saw her again,\r\nand he never knew whither she went, for she slept her never-waking sleep\r\nin the ice-arms of her friend the Water that tells no tales.\r\n\r\nPoor little Molly Cottontail! She was a true heroine, yet only one of\r\nunnumbered millions that without a thought of heroism have lived and\r\ndone their best in their little world, and died. She fought a good fight\r\nin the battle of life. She was good stuff; the stuff that never dies.\r\nFor flesh of her flesh and brain of her brain was Rag. She lives in him,\r\nand through him transmits a finer fibre to her race.\r\n\r\nAnd Rag still lives in the Swamp. Old Olifant died that winter, and the\r\nunthrifty sons ceased to clear the Swamp or mend the wire fences. Within\r\na single year it was a wilder place than ever; fresh trees and brambles\r\ngrew, and falling wires made many Cottontail castles and last retreats\r\nthat dogs and foxes dared not storm. And there to this day lives Rag. He\r\nis a big strong buck now and fears no rivals. He has a large family of\r\nhis own, and a pretty brown wife that he got I know not where. There,\r\nno doubt, he and his children\'s children will flourish for many years\r\nto come, and there you may see them any sunny evening if you have learnt\r\ntheir signal 5 code, and, choosing a good spot on the ground, know just\r\nhow and when to thump it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                    BINGO\r\n\r\n     "Ye Franckelyn\'s dogge leaped over a style,\r\n     And yey yclept him lyttel Bingo,\r\n      B-I-N-G-O,\r\n\r\n     And yey yclept him lyttel Bingo.\r\n     Ye Franchelyn\'s wyfe brewed nutte-brown ayle,\r\n\r\n     And he yclept ytte rare-goode Stingo,\r\n      S-T-I-N-G-O,\r\n\r\n     And he yclept ytte rare goode Stingo.\r\n     Now ys not this a prettye rhyme,\r\n     I thynke ytte ys bye Jingo,\r\n      J-I-N-G-O,\r\n\r\n     I thynke ytte ys bye Jingo."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBINGO, The Story of My Dog\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nIT WAS EARLY in November, 1882, and the Manitoba winter had just set in.\r\nI was tilting back in my chair for a few lazy moments after breakfast,\r\nidly alternating my gaze from the one window-pane of our shanty, through\r\nwhich was framed a bit of the prairie and the end of our cowshed, to the\r\nold rhyme of the \'Franckelyn\'s dogge\' pinned on the logs near by. But\r\nthe dreamy mixture of rhyme and view was quickly dispelled by the sight\r\nof a large gray animal dashing across the prairie into the cowshed, with\r\na smaller black and white animal in hot pursuit.\r\n\r\n"A wolf," I exclaimed, and seizing a rifle dashed out to help the dog.\r\nBut before I could get there they had left the stable, and after a\r\nshort run over the snow the wolf again turned at bay, and the dog, our\r\nneighbor\'s collie, circled about watching his chance to snap.\r\n\r\nI fired a couple of long shots, which had the effect only of setting\r\nthem off again over the prairie. After another run this matchless dog\r\nclosed and seized the wolf by the haunch, but again retreated to avoid\r\nthe fierce return chop. Then there was another stand at bay, and again a\r\nrace over the snow. Every few hundred yards this scene was repeated, the\r\ndog managing so that each fresh rush should be toward the settlement,\r\nwhile the wolf vainly tried to break back toward the dark belt of\r\ntrees in the east. At last after a mile of this fighting and running I\r\novertook them, and the dog, seeing that he now had good backing, closed\r\nin for the finish.\r\n\r\nAfter a few seconds the whirl of struggling animals resolved itself into\r\na wolf, on his back, with a bleeding collie gripping his throat, and\r\nit was now easy for me to step up and end the fight by putting a ball\r\nthrough the wolf\'s head.\r\n\r\nThen, when this dog of marvellous wind saw that his foe was dead, he\r\ngave him no second glance, but set out at a lope for a farm four miles\r\nacross the snow where he had left his master when first the wolf\r\nwas started. He was a wonderful dog, and even if I had not come he\r\nundoubtedly would have killed the wolf alone, as I learned he had\r\nalready done with others of the kind, in spite of the fact that the\r\nwolf, though of the smaller or prairie race, was much larger than\r\nhimself. I was filled with admiration for the dog\'s prowess and at once\r\nsought to buy him at any price. The scornful reply of his owner was,\r\n"Why don\'t you try to buy one of the children?"\r\n\r\nSince Frank was not in the market I was obliged to content myself with\r\nthe next best thing, one of his alleged progeny. That is, a son of his\r\nwife. This probable offspring of an illustrious sire was a roly-poly\r\nball of black fur that looked more like a long-tailed bearcub than a\r\npuppy. But he had some tan markings like those on Frank\'s coat,\r\nthat were, I hoped, guarantees of future greatness, and also a very\r\ncharacteristic ring of white that he always wore on his muzzle.\r\n\r\nHaving got possession of his person, the next thing was to find him\r\na name. Surely this puzzle was already solved. The rhyme of the\r\n\'Franckelyn\'s dogge\' was in-built with the foundation of our\r\nacquaintance, so with adequate pomp \'we yclept him little Bingo.\'\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe rest of that winter Bingo spent in our shanty, living the life of a\r\nblubbery, fat, well-meaning, ill-doing puppy; gorging himself with food\r\nand growing bigger and clumsier each day. Even sad experience failed\r\nto teach him that he must keep his nose out of the rat trap. His most\r\nfriendly overtures to the cat were wholly misunderstood and resulted\r\nonly in an armed neutrality that varied by occasional reigns of terror,\r\ncontinued to the end; which came when Bingo, who early showed a mind of\r\nhis own, got a notion for sleeping at the barn and avoiding the shanty\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nWhen the spring came I set about his serious education. After much pains\r\non my behalf and many pains on his, he learned to go at the word in\r\nquest of our old yellow cow, that pastured at will on the unfenced\r\nprairie.\r\n\r\nOnce he had learned his business, he became very fond of it and nothing\r\npleased him more than an order to go and fetch the cow. Away he would\r\ndash, barking with pleasure and leaping high in the air that he might\r\nbetter scan the plain for his victim. In a short time he would return\r\ndriving her at full gallop before him, and gave her no peace until,\r\npuffing and blowing, she was safely driven into the farthest corner of\r\nher stable.\r\n\r\nLess energy on his part would have been more satisfactory, but we bore\r\nwith him until he grew so fond of this semi-daily hunt that he began to\r\nbring \'old Dunne\' without being told. And at length not once or twice\r\nbut a dozen times a day this energetic cowherd would sally forth on his\r\nown responsibility and drive the cow home to the stable.\r\n\r\nAt last things came to such a pass that whenever he felt like taking a\r\nlittle exercise, or had a few minutes of spare time, or even happened to\r\nthink of it, Bingo would sally forth at racing speed over the plain\r\nand a few minutes later return, driving the unhappy yellow cow at full\r\ngallop before him.\r\n\r\nAt first this did not seem very bad, as it kept the cow from straying\r\ntoo far; but soon it was seen that it hindered her feeding. She became\r\nthin and gave less milk; it seemed to weigh on her mind too, as she\r\nwas always watching nervously for that hateful dog, and in the mornings\r\nwould hang around the stable as though afraid to venture off and subject\r\nherself at once to an onset.\r\n\r\nThis was going too far. All attempts to make Bingo more moderate in his\r\npleasure were failures, so he was compelled to give it up altogether.\r\nAfter this, though he dared not bring her home, he continued to show his\r\ninterest by lying at her stable door while she was being milked.\r\n\r\nAs the summer came on the mosquitoes became a dreadful plague, and the\r\nconsequent vicious switching of Dunne\'s tail at milking-time was even\r\nmore annoying than the mosquitoes.\r\n\r\nFred, the brother who did the milking, was of an inventive as well as\r\nan impatient turn of mind, and he devised a simple plan to stop the\r\nswitching. He fastened a brick to the cow\'s tail, then set blithely\r\nabout his work assured of unusual comfort while the rest of us looked on\r\nin doubt.\r\n\r\nSuddenly through the mist of mosquitoes came a dull whack and an\r\noutburst of \'language.\' The cow went on placidly chewing till Fred got\r\non his feet and furiously attacked her with the milking-stool. It was\r\nbad enough to be whacked on the ear with a brick by a stupid old cow,\r\nbut the uproarious enjoyment and ridicule of the bystanders made it\r\nunendurable.\r\n\r\nBingo, hearing the uproar, and divining that he was needed, rushed in\r\nand attacked Dunne on the other side. Before the affair quieted down the\r\nmilk was spilt, the pail and stool were broken, and the cow and the dog\r\nseverely beaten.\r\n\r\nPoor Bingo could not understand it at all. He had long ago learned to\r\ndespise that cow, and now in utter disgust he decided to forsake even\r\nher stable door, and from that time be attached himself exclusively to\r\nthe horses and their stable.\r\n\r\nThe cattle were mine, the horses were my brother\'s, and in transferring\r\nhis allegiance from the cow-stable to the horse-stable Bingo seemed to\r\ngive me up too, and anything like daily companionship ceased, and yet,\r\nwhenever any emergency arose Bingo turned to me and I to him, and both\r\nseemed to feel that the bond between man and dog is one that lasts as\r\nlong as life.\r\n\r\nThe only other occasion on which Bingo acted as cowherd was in the\r\nautumn of the same year at the annual Carberry Fair. Among the dazzling\r\ninducements to enter one\'s stock there was, in addition to a prospect of\r\nglory, a cash prize of \'two dollars\' for the \'best collie in training\'.\r\n\r\nMisled by a false friend, I entered Bingo, and early on the day fixed,\r\nthe cow was driven to the prairie just outside of the village. When the\r\ntime came she was pointed out to Bingo and the word given--\'Go fetch the\r\ncow.\' It was the intention, of course, that he should bring her to me at\r\nthe judge\'s stand.\r\n\r\nBut the animals knew better. They hadn\'t rehearsed all summer for\r\nnothing. When Dunne saw Bingo\'s careering form she knew that her only\r\nhope for safety was to get into her stable, and Bingo was equally sure\r\nthat his sole mission in life was to quicken her pace in that direction.\r\nSo off they raced over the prairie, like a wolf after a deer, and\r\nheading straight toward their home two miles way, they disappeared from\r\nview.\r\n\r\nThat was the last that judge or jury ever saw of dog or cow. The prize\r\nwas awarded to the only other entry.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nBingo\'s loyalty to the horses was quite remarkable; by day he trotted\r\nbeside them, and by night he slept at the stable door. Where the team\r\nwent Bingo went, and nothing kept him away from them. This interesting\r\nassumption of ownership lent the greater significance to the following\r\ncircumstance.\r\n\r\nI was not superstitious, and up to this time had had no faith in omens,\r\nbut was now deeply impressed by a strange occurrence in which Bingo took\r\na leading part. There were but two of us now living on the De Winton\r\nFarm. One morning my brother set out for Boggy Creek for a load of hay.\r\nIt was a long day\'s journey there and back, and he made an early start.\r\nStrange to tell, Bingo for once in his life did not follow the team. My\r\nbrother called to him, but still he stood at a safe distance, and eyeing\r\nthe team askance, refused to stir. Suddenly he raised his nose in the\r\nair and gave vent to a long, melancholy howl. He watched the wagon out\r\nof sight, and even followed for a hundred yards or so, raising his voice\r\nfrom time to time in the most doleful howlings.\r\n\r\nAll that day he stayed about the barn, the only time that he was\r\nwillingly separated from the horses, and at intervals howled a very\r\ndeath dirge. I was alone, and the dog\'s behavior inspired me with an\r\nawful foreboding of calamity, that weighed upon us more and more as the\r\nhours passed away.\r\n\r\nAbout six o\'clock Bingo\'s howlings became unbearable, so that for lack\r\nof a better thought I threw something at him, and ordered him away. But\r\noh, the feeling of horror that filled me! Why did I let my brother go\r\naway alone? Should I ever again see him alive? I might have known from\r\nthe dog\'s actions that something dreadful was about to happen.\r\n\r\nAt length the hour for his return arrived, and there was John on his\r\nload. I took charge of the horses, vastly relieved, and with an air of\r\nassumed unconcern, asked, "All right?"\r\n\r\n"Right," was the laconic answer.\r\n\r\nWho now can say that there is nothing in omens?\r\n\r\nAnd yet when, long afterward, I told this to one skilled in the occult,\r\nhe looked grave, and said, "Bingo always turned to you in a crisis?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Then do not smile. It was you that were in danger that day; he stayed\r\nand saved your life, though you never knew from what."\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nEarly in the spring I had begun Bingo\'s education. Very shortly\r\nafterward he began mine.\r\n\r\nMidway on the two-mile stretch of prairie that lay between our shanty\r\nand the village of Carberry, was the corner-stake of the farm; it was a\r\nstout post in a low mound of earth, and was visible from afar.\r\n\r\nI soon noticed that Bingo never passed without minutely examining this\r\nmysterious post. Next I learned that it was also visited by the prairie\r\nwolves as well as by all the dogs in the neighborhood, and at length,\r\nwith the aid of a telescope, I made a number of observations that helped\r\nme to an understanding of the matter and enabled me to enter more fully\r\ninto Bingo\'s private life.\r\n\r\nThe post was by common agreement a registry of the canine tribes. Their\r\nexquisite sense of smell enabled each individual to tell at once by the\r\ntrack and trace what other had recently been at the post. When the snow\r\ncame much more was revealed. I then discovered that this post was but\r\none of a system that covered the country; that, in short, the entire\r\nregion was laid out in signal stations at convenient intervals. These\r\nwere marked by any conspicuous post, stone, buffalo skull, or other\r\nobject that chanced to be in the desired locality, and extensive\r\nobservation showed that it was a very complete system for getting and\r\ngiving the news.\r\n\r\nEach dog or wolf makes a point of calling at those stations that are\r\nnear his line of travel to learn who has recently been there, just as a\r\nman calls at his club on returning to town and looks up the register.\r\n\r\nI have seen Bingo approach the post, sniff, examine the ground about,\r\nthen growl, and with bristling mane and glowing eyes, scratch fiercely\r\nand contemptuously with his hind feet, finally walking off very stiffly,\r\nglancing back from time to time. All of which, being interpreted, said:\r\n\r\n"Grrrh! woof! there\'s that dirty cur of McCarthy\'s. Woof! I\'ll \'tend to\r\nhim tonight. Woof! woof!" On another occasion, after the preliminaries,\r\nhe became keenly interested and studied a coyote\'s track that came and\r\nwent, saying to himself, as I afterward learned:\r\n\r\n"A coyote track coming from the north, smelling of dead cow. Indeed?\r\nPollworth\'s old Brindle must be dead at last. This is worth looking\r\ninto."\r\n\r\nAt other times he would wag his tail, trot about the vicinity and come\r\nagain and again to make his own visit more evident, perhaps for the\r\nbenefit of his brother Bill just back from Brandon! So that it was not\r\nby chance that one night Bill turned up at Bingo\'s home and was taken\r\nto the hills, where a delicious dead horse afforded a chance to suitably\r\ncelebrate the reunion.\r\n\r\nAt other times he would be suddenly aroused by the news, take up the\r\ntrail, and race to the next station for later information.\r\n\r\nSometimes his inspection produced only an air of grave attention, as\r\nthough he said to himself, "Dear me, who the deuce is this?" or "It\r\nseems to me I met that fellow at the Portage last summer."\r\n\r\nOne morning on approaching the post Bingo\'s every hair stood on end, his\r\ntail dropped and quivered, and he gave proof that he was suddenly sick\r\nat the stomach, sure signs of terror. He showed no desire to follow up\r\nor know more of the matter, but returned to the house, and half an hour\r\nafterward his mane was still bristling and his expression one of hate or\r\nfear.\r\n\r\nI studied the dreaded track and learned that in Bingo\'s language the\r\nhalf-terrified, deep-gurgled \'grr-wff\' means \'timber wolf.\'\r\n\r\nThese were among the things that Bingo taught me. And in the after time\r\nwhen I might chance to see him arouse from his frosty nest by the stable\r\ndoor, and after stretching himself and shaking the snow from his shaggy\r\ncoat, disappear into the gloom at a steady trot, trot, trot, I used to\r\nthink:\r\n\r\n"Ahh! old dog, I know where you are off to, and why you eschew the\r\nshelter of the shanty. Now I know why your nightly trips over the\r\ncountry are so well timed, and how you know just where to go for what\r\nyou want, and when and how to seek it."\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1884, the shanty at De Winton farm was closed and Bingo\r\nchanged his home to the establishment--that is, to the stable, not the\r\nhouse--of Gordon Wright, our most intimate neighbor.\r\n\r\nSince the winter of his puppyhood he had declined to enter a house at\r\nany time excepting during a thunderstorm. Of thunder and guns he had a\r\ndeep dread--no doubt the fear of the first originated in the second, and\r\nthat arose from some unpleasant shot-gun experiences, the cause of which\r\nwill be seen. His nightly couch was outside the stable, even during\r\nthe coldest weather, and it was easy to see he enjoyed to the full\r\nthe complete nocturnal liberty entailed. Bingo\'s midnight wanderings\r\nextended across the plains for miles. There was plenty of proof of this.\r\nSome farmers at very remote points sent word to old Gordon that if\r\nhe did not keep his dog home nights, they would use the shot-gun, and\r\nBingo\'s terror of firearms would indicate that the threats were not\r\nidle. A man living as far away as Petrel said he saw a large black wolf\r\nkill a coyote on the snow one winter evening, but afterward he changed\r\nhis opinion and \'reckoned it must \'a\' been Wright\'s dog.\' Whenever\r\nthe body of a winter-killed ox or horse was exposed, Bingo was sure\r\nto repair to it nightly, and driving away the prairie wolves, feast to\r\nrepletion.\r\n\r\nSometimes the object of a night foray was merely to maul some distant\r\nneighbor\'s dog, and notwithstanding vengeful threats, there seemed no\r\nreason to fear that the Bingo breed would die out. One man even avowed\r\nthat he had seen a prairie wolf accompanied by three young ones which\r\nresembled the mother, excepting that they were very large and black and\r\nhad a ring of white around the muzzle.\r\n\r\nTrue or not as that may be, I know that late in March, while we were\r\nout in the sleigh with Bingo trotting behind, a prairie wolf was started\r\nfrom a hollow. Away it went with Bingo in full chase, but the wolf did\r\nnot greatly exert itself to escape, and within a short distance Bingo\r\nwas close up, yet strange to tell, there was no grappling, no fight!\r\n\r\nBingo trotted amiably alongside and licked the wolf\'s nose.\r\n\r\nWe were astounded, and shouted to urge Bingo on. Our shouting and\r\napproach several times started the wolf off at speed and Bingo again\r\npursued until he had overtaken it, but his gentleness was too obvious.\r\n\r\n"It is a she-wolf, he won\'t harm her," I exclaimed as the truth dawned\r\non me. And Gordon said: "Well, I be darned."\r\n\r\nSo we called our unwilling dog and drove on.\r\n\r\nFor weeks after this we were annoyed by the depredations of a prairie\r\nwolf who killed our chickens, stole pieces of pork from the end of the\r\nhouse, and several times terrified the children by looking into the\r\nwindow of the shanty while the men were away.\r\n\r\nAgainst this animal Bingo seemed to be no safeguard. At length the wolf,\r\na female, was killed, and then Bingo plainly showed his hand by his\r\nlasting enmity toward Oliver, the man who did the deed.\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nIt is wonderful and beautiful how a man and his dog will stick to one\r\nanother, through thick and thin. Butler tells of an undivided Indian\r\ntribe, in the Far North which was all but exterminated by an internecine\r\nfeud over a dog that belonged to one man and was killed by his neighbor;\r\nand among ourselves we have lawsuits, fights, and deadly feuds, all\r\npointing the same old moral, \'Love me, love my dog.\'\r\n\r\nOne of our neighbors had a very fine hound that he thought the best and\r\ndearest dog in the world. I loved him, so I loved his dog, and when\r\none day poor Tan crawled home terribly mangled and died by the door, I\r\njoined my threats of vengeance with those of his master and thenceforth\r\nlost no opportunity of tracing the miscreant, both by offering rewards\r\nand by collecting scraps of evidence. At length it was clear that one of\r\nthree men to the southward had had a hand in the cruel affair. The scent\r\nwas warming up, and soon we should have been in a position to exact\r\nrigorous justice, at least, from the wretch who had murdered poor old\r\nTan.\r\n\r\nThen something took place which at once changed my mind and led me\r\nto believe that the mangling of the old hound was not by any means an\r\nunpardonable crime, but indeed on second thoughts was rather commendable\r\nthan otherwise.\r\n\r\nGordon Wright\'s farm lay to the south of us, and while there one day,\r\nGordon Jr., knowing that I was tracking the murderer, took me aside and\r\nlooking about furtively, he whispered, in tragic tones:\r\n\r\n"It was Bing done it."\r\n\r\nAnd the matter dropped right there. For I confess that from that moment\r\nI did all in my power to baffle the justice I had previously striven so\r\nhard to further. I had given Bingo away long before, but the feeling of\r\nownership did not die; and of this indissoluble fellowship of dog and\r\nman he was soon to take part in another important illustration.\r\n\r\nOld Gordon and Oliver were close neighbors and friends; they joined in\r\na contract to cut wood, and worked together harmoniously till late on in\r\nwinter. Then Oliver\'s old horse died, and he, determining to profit as\r\nfar as possible, dragged it out on the plain and laid poison baits for\r\nwolves around it. Alas for poor Bingo! He would lead a wolfish life,\r\nthough again and again it brought him into wolfish misfortunes.\r\n\r\nHe was as fond of dead horse as any of his wild kindred. That very\r\nnight, with Wright\'s own dog Curley, he visited the carcass. It seemed\r\nas though Bing had busied himself chiefly keeping off the wolves, but\r\nCurley feasted immoderately. The tracks in the snow told the story of\r\nthe banquet; the interruption as the poison began to work, and of\r\nthe dreadful spasms of pain during the erratic course back home where\r\nCurley, falling in convulsions at Gordon\'s feet, died in the greatest\r\nagony.\r\n\r\n\'Love me, love my dog,\' No explanations or apology were acceptable;\r\nit was useless to urge that it was accidental; the long-standing feud\r\nbetween Bingo and Oliver was now remembered as an important sidelight.\r\nThe wood-contract was thrown up, all friendly relations ceased, and to\r\nthis day there is no county big enough to hold the rival factions which\r\nwere called at once into existence and to arms by Curley\'s dying yell.\r\n\r\nIt was months before Bingo really recovered from the poison. We believed\r\nindeed that he never again would be the sturdy old-time Bingo. But when\r\nthe spring came he began to gain strength, and bettering as the grass\r\ngrew, he was within a few weeks once more in full health and vigor to be\r\na pride to his friends and a nuisance to his neighbors.\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nChanges took me far away from Manitoba, and on my return in 1886 Bingo\r\nwas still a member of Wright\'s household. I thought he would have\r\nforgotten me after two years\' absence, but not so. One day early in the\r\nwinter, after having been lost for forty-eight hours, he crawled home to\r\nWright\'s with a wolf-trap and a heavy log fast to one foot, and the foot\r\nfrozen to stony hardness. No one had been able to approach to help him,\r\nhe was so savage, when I, the stranger now, stooped down and laid hold\r\nof the trap with one hand and his leg with the other. Instantly he\r\nseized my wrist in his teeth.\r\n\r\nWithout stirring I said, "Bing, don\'t you know me?"\r\n\r\nHe had not broken the skin and at once released his hold and offered no\r\nfurther resistance, although he whined a good deal during the removal of\r\nthe trap. He still acknowledged me his master in spite of his change\r\nof residence and my long absence, and notwithstanding my surrender of\r\nownership I still felt that he was my dog.\r\n\r\nBing was carried into the house much against his will and his frozen\r\nfoot thawed out. During the rest of the winter he went lame and two of\r\nhis toes eventually dropped off. But before the return of warm weather\r\nhis health and strength were fully restored, and to a casual glance he\r\nbore no mark of his dreadful experience in the steel trap.\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nDuring that same winter I caught many wolves and foxes who did not have\r\nBingo\'s good luck in escaping the traps, which I kept out right into the\r\nspring, for bounties are good even when fur is not.\r\n\r\nKennedy\'s Plain was always a good trapping ground because it was\r\nunfrequented by man and yet lay between the heavy woods and the\r\nsettlement. I had been fortunate with the fur here, and late in April\r\nrode in on one of my regular rounds.\r\n\r\nThe wolf-traps are made of heavy steel and have two springs, each of one\r\nhundred pounds power. They are set in fours around a buried bait, and\r\nafter being strongly fastened to concealed logs are carefully covered in\r\ncotton and in fine sand so as to be quite invisible. A prairie wolf was\r\ncaught in one of these. I killed him with a club and throwing him aside\r\nproceeded to reset the trap as I had done so many hundred times before.\r\nAll was quickly done. I threw the trap-wrench over toward the pony, and\r\nseeing some fine sand nearby, I reached out for a handful of it to add a\r\ngood finish to the setting.\r\n\r\nOh, unlucky thought! Oh, mad heedlessness born of long immunity! That\r\nfine sand was on the next wolftrap and in an instant I was a prisoner.\r\nAlthough not wounded, for the traps have no teeth, and my thick trapping\r\ngloves deadened the snap, I was firmly caught across the hand above the\r\nknuckles. Not greatly alarmed at this, I tried to reach the trap-wrench\r\nwith my right foot. Stretching out at full length, face downward, I\r\nworked myself toward it, making my imprisoned arm as long and straight\r\nas possible. I could not see and reach at the same time, but counted on\r\nmy toe telling me when I touched the little iron key to my fetters. My\r\nfirst effort was a failure; strain as I might at the chain my toe struck\r\nno metal. I swung slowly around my anchor, but still failed. Then a\r\npainfully taken observation showed I was much too far to the west. I set\r\nabout working around, tapping blindly with my toe to discover the key.\r\nThus wildly groping with my right foot I forgot about the other till\r\nthere was a sharp \'clank\' and the iron jaws of trap No. 5 closed tight\r\non my left foot.\r\n\r\nThe terrors of the situation did not, at first, impress me, but I soon\r\nfound that all my struggles were in vain. I could not get free from\r\neither trap or move the traps together, and there I lay stretched out\r\nand firmly staked to the ground.\r\n\r\nWhat would become of me now? There was not much danger of freezing for\r\nthe cold weather was over, but Kennedy\'s Plain was never visited by the\r\nwinter wood-cutters. No one knew where I had gone, and unless I could\r\nmanage to free myself there was no prospect ahead but to be devoured by\r\nwolves, or else die of cold and starvation.\r\n\r\nAs I lay there the red sun went down over the spruce swamp west of the\r\nplain, and a shorelark on a gopher mound a few yards off twittered his\r\nevening song, just as one had done the night before at our shanty door,\r\nand though the numb pains were creeping up my arm, and a deadly chill\r\npossessed me, I noticed how long his little ear-tufts were. Then my\r\nthoughts went to the comfortable supper-table at Wright\'s shanty, and I\r\nthought, now they are frying the pork for supper, or just sitting\r\ndown. My pony still stood as I left him with his bridle on the ground\r\npatiently waiting to take me home. He did not understand the long delay,\r\nand when I called, he ceased nibbling the grass and looked at me in\r\ndumb, helpless inquiry. If he would only go home the empty saddle might\r\ntell the tale and bring help. But his very faithfulness kept him waiting\r\nhour after hour while I was perishing of cold and hunger.\r\n\r\nThen I remembered how old Girou the trapper had been lost, and in the\r\nfollowing spring his comrades found his skeleton held by the leg in a\r\nbear-trap. I wondered which part of my clothing would show my identity.\r\nThen a new thought came to me. This is how a wolf feels when he is\r\ntrapped. Oh! what misery have I been responsible for! Now I\'m to pay for\r\nit.\r\n\r\nNight came slowly on. A prairie wolf howled, the pony pricked up his\r\nears and, walking nearer to me, stood with his head down. Then another\r\nprairie wolf howled and another, and I could make out that they were\r\ngathering in the neighborhood. There I lay prone and helpless, wondering\r\nif it would not be strictly just that they should come and tear me to\r\npieces. I heard them calling for a long time before I realized that\r\ndim, shadowy forms were sneaking near. The horse saw them first, and his\r\nterrified snort drove them back at first, but they came nearer next\r\ntime and sat around me on the prairie. Soon one bolder than the others\r\ncrawled up and tugged at the body of his dead relative. I shouted and he\r\nretreated growling. The pony ran to a distance in terror. Presently\r\nthe wolf returned, and after after two or three of these retreats and\r\nreturns, the body was dragged off and devoured by the rest in a few\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\nAfter this they gathered nearer and sat on their haunches to look at\r\nme, and the boldest one smelt the rifle and scratched dirt on it.\r\nHe retreated when I kicked at him with my free foot and shouted, but\r\ngrowing bolder as I grew weaker he came and snarled right in my face.\r\nAt this several others snarled and came up closer, and I realized that I\r\nwas to be devoured by the foe that I most despised; when suddenly out\r\nof the gloom with a guttural roar sprang a great black wolf. The prairie\r\nwolves scattered like chaff except the bold one, which, seized by the\r\nblack new-comer, was in a few moments a draggled corpse, and then, oh\r\nhorrors! this mighty brute bounded at me and--Bingo--noble Bingo, rubbed\r\nhis shaggy, panting sides against me and licked my cold face.\r\n\r\n"Bingo--Bing--old--boy--Fetch me the trap wrench!" Away he went and\r\nreturned dragging the rifle, for he knew only that I wanted something.\r\n\r\n"No--Bing--the trap-wrench." This time it was my sash, but at last\r\nhe brought the wrench and wagged his tail in joy that it was right.\r\nReaching out with my free hand, after much difficulty I unscrewed the\r\npillar-nut. The trap fell apart and my hand was released, and a minute\r\nlater I was free. Bing brought the pony up, and after slowly walking to\r\nrestore the circulation I was able to mount. Then slowly at first but\r\nsoon at a gallop, with Bingo as herald careering and barking ahead, we\r\nset out for home, there to learn that the night before, though never\r\ntaken on the trapping rounds, the brave dog had acted strangely,\r\nwhimpering and watching the timber-trail; and at last when night came\r\non, in spite of attempts to detain him he had set out in the gloom and\r\nguided by a knowledge that is beyond us had reached the spot in time to\r\navenge me as well as set me free.\r\n\r\nStaunch old Bing--he was a strange dog. Though his heart was with me,\r\nhe passed me next day with scarcely a look, but responded with alacrity\r\nwhen little Gordon called him to a gopher-hunt. And it was so to the\r\nend; and to the end also he lived the wolfish life that he loved, and\r\nnever failed to seek the winter-killed horses and found one again with\r\na poisoned bait, and wolfishly bolted that; then feeling the pang, set\r\nout, not for Wright\'s but to find me, and reached the door of my shanty\r\nwhere I should have been. Next day on returning I found him dead in the\r\nsnow with his head on the sill of the door--the door of his puppyhood\'s\r\ndays; my dog to the last in his heart of hearts--it was my help he\r\nsought, and vainly sought, in the hour of his bitter extremity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPRINGFIELD FOX\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE HENS had been mysteriously disappearing for over a month; and when I\r\ncame home to Springfield for the summer holidays it was my duty to find\r\nthe cause. This was soon done. The fowls were carried away bodily one\r\nat a time, before going to roost or else after leaving, which put tramps\r\nand neighbors out of court; they were not taken from the high perches,\r\nwhich cleared all coons and owls; or left partly eaten, so that weasels,\r\nskunks, or minks were not the guilty ones, and the blame, therefore, was\r\nsurely left at Reynard\'s door.\r\n\r\nThe great pine wood of Erindale was on the other bank of the river, and\r\non looking carefully about the lower ford I saw a few fox-tracks and a\r\nbarred feather from one of our Plymouth Rock chickens. On climbing the\r\nfarther bank in search of more clews, I heard a great outcry of crows\r\nbehind me, and turning, saw a number of these birds darting down at\r\nsomething in the ford. A better view showed that it was the old story,\r\nthief catch thief, for there in the middle of the ford was a fox with\r\nsomething in his jaws--he was returning from our barnyard with another\r\nhen. The crows, though shameless robbers themselves, are ever first to\r\ncry \'Stop thief,\' and yet more than ready to take \'hush-money\' in the\r\nform of a share in the plunder.\r\n\r\nAnd this was their game now. The fox to get back home must cross the\r\nriver, where he was exposed to the full brunt of the crow mob. He made a\r\ndash for it, and would doubtless have gotten across with his booty had I\r\nnot joined in the attack, whereupon he dropped the hen, scarce dead, and\r\ndisappeared in the woods.\r\n\r\nThis large and regular levy of provisions wholly carried off could mean\r\nbut one thing, a family of little foxes at home; and to find them I now\r\nwas bound.\r\n\r\nThat evening I went with Ranger, my hound, across the river into the\r\nErindale woods. As soon as the hound began to circle, we heard the\r\nshort, sharp bark of a fox from a thickly wooded ravine close by.\r\nRanger dashed in at once, struck a hot scent and went off on a lively\r\nstraight-away till his voice was lost in the distance away over the\r\nupland.\r\n\r\nAfter nearly an hour he came back, panting and warm, for it was baking\r\nAugust weather, and lay down at my feet.\r\n\r\nBut almost immediately the same foxy \'Yap yurrr\' was heard close at hand\r\nand off dashed the dog on another chase.\r\n\r\nAway he went in the darkness, baying like a foghorn, straight away to\r\nthe north. And the loud \'Boo, boo,\' became a low \'oo, oo,\' and that a\r\nfeeble \'o-o\' and then was lost. They must have gone some miles away, for\r\neven with ear to the ground I heard nothing of them though a mile was\r\neasy distance for Ranger\'s brazen voice.\r\n\r\nAs I waited in the black woods I heard a sweet sound of dripping water:\r\n\'Tink tank tenk tink, Ta tink tank tenk tonk.\'\r\n\r\nI did not know of any spring so near, and in the hot night it was a glad\r\nfind. But the sound led me to the bough of a oak-tree, where I found its\r\nsource. Such a soft sweet song; full of delightful suggestion on such a\r\nnight:\r\n\r\n     Tonk tank tenk tink\r\n     Ta tink a tonk a tank a tink a\r\n     Ta ta tink tank ta ta tonk tink\r\n     Drink a tank a drink a drunk.\r\n\r\nIt was the \'water-dripping\' song of the saw-whet owl.\r\n\r\nBut suddenly a deep raucous breathing and a rustle of leaves showed that\r\nRanger was back. He was completely fagged out. His tongue hung almost\r\nto the ground and was dripping with foam, his flanks were heaving and\r\nspume-flecks dribbled from his breast and sides. He stopped panting a\r\nmoment to give my hand a dutiful lick, then flung himself flop on the\r\nleaves to drown all other sounds with his noisy panting.\r\n\r\nBut again that tantilizing \'Yap yurrr\' was heard a few feet away, and\r\nthe meaning of it all dawned on me. We were close to the den where the\r\nlittle foxes were, and the old ones were taking turns in trying to lead\r\nus away.\r\n\r\nIt was late night now, so we went home feeling sure that the problem was\r\nnearly solved.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nIt was well known that there was an old fox with his family living in\r\nthe neighborhood, but no one supposed them so near.\r\n\r\nThis fox had been called \'Scarface,\' because of a scar reaching from his\r\neye through and back of his ear; this was supposed to have been given\r\nhim by a barbed-wire fence during a rabbit hunt, and as the hair came in\r\nwhite after it healed it was always a strong mark.\r\n\r\nThe winter before I had met with him and had had a sample of his\r\ncraftiness. I was out shooting, after a fall of snow, and had crossed\r\nthe open fields to the edge of the brushy hollow back of the old mill.\r\nAs my head rose to a view of the hollow I caught sight of a fox trotting\r\nat long range down the other side, in line to cross my course. Instantly\r\nI held motionless, and did not even lower or turn my head lest I should\r\ncatch his eye by moving, until he went on out of sight in the thick\r\ncover at the bottom. As soon as he was hidden I bobbed down and ran to\r\nhead him off where he should leave the cover on the other side, and\r\nwas there in good time awaiting, but no fox came forth. A careful look\r\nshowed the fresh track of a fox that had bounded from the cover, and\r\nfollowing it with my eye I saw old Scarface himself far out of range\r\nbehind me, sitting on his haunches and grinning as though much amused.\r\n\r\nA study of the trail made all clear. He had seen me at the moment I saw\r\nhim, but he, also like a true hunter, had concealed the fact, putting\r\non an air of unconcern till out of sight, when he had run for his life\r\naround behind me and amused himself by watching my still-born trick.\r\n\r\nIn the springtime I had yet another instance of Scarface\'s cunning.\r\nI was walking with a friend along the road over the high pasture. We\r\npassed within thirty feet of a ridge on which were several gray and\r\nbrown boulders. When at the nearest point my friend said:\r\n\r\n"Stone number three looks to me very much like a fox curled up."\r\n\r\nBut I could not see it, and we passed. We had not gone many yards\r\nfarther when the wind blew on this boulder as on fur.\r\n\r\nMy friend said, "I am sure that is a fox, lying asleep."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll soon settle that," I replied, and turned back, but as soon as I\r\nhad taken one step from the road, up jumped Scarface, for it was he, and\r\nran. A fire had swept the middle of the pasture, leaving a broad belt\r\nof black; over this he scurried till he came to the unburnt yellow grass\r\nagain, where he squatted down and was lost to view. He had been watching\r\nus all the time, and would not have moved had we kept to the road. The\r\nwonderful part of this is, not that he resembled the round stones and\r\ndry grass, but that he knew he did, and was ready to profit by it.\r\n\r\nWe soon found that it was Scarface and his wife Vixen that had made our\r\nwoods their home and our barnyard their base of supplies.\r\n\r\nNext morning a search in the pines showed a great bank of earth that had\r\nbeen scratched up within a few months. It must have come from a hole,\r\nand yet there was none to be seen. It is well known that a really cute\r\nfox, on digging a new den, brings all the earth out at the first hole\r\nmade, but carries on a tunnel into some distant thicket. Then closing up\r\nfor good the first made and too well-marked door, uses only the entrance\r\nhidden in the thicket.\r\n\r\nSo after a little search at the other side of a knoll, I found the real\r\nentry and good proof that there was a nest of little foxes inside.\r\n\r\nRising above the brush on the hillside was a great hollow basswood. It\r\nleaned a good deal and had a large hole at the bottom, and a smaller one\r\nat top.\r\n\r\nWe boys had often used this tree in playing Swiss Family Robinson, and\r\nby cutting steps in its soft punky walls had made it easy to go up and\r\ndown in the hollow. Now it came in handy, for next day when the sun was\r\nwarm I went there to watch, and from this perch on the roof, I soon saw\r\nthe interesting family that lived in the cellar near by. There were four\r\nlittle foxes; they looked curiously like little lambs, with their woolly\r\ncoats, their long thick legs and innocent expressions, and yet a second\r\nglance at their broad, sharp-nosed, sharp-eyed visages showed that each\r\nof these innocents was the makings of a crafty old fox.\r\n\r\nThey played about, basking in the sun, or wrestling with each other\r\ntill a slight sound made them scurry under ground. But their alarm was\r\nneedless, for the cause of it was their mother; she stepped from the\r\nbushes bringing another hen--number seventeen as I remember. A low call\r\nfrom her and the little fellows came tumbling out. Then began a scene\r\nthat I thought charming, but which my uncle would not have enjoyed at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThey rushed on the hen, and tussled and fought with it, and each other,\r\nwhile the mother, keeping a sharp eye for enemies, looked on with fond\r\ndelight. The expression on her face was remarkable. It was first a\r\ngrinning of delight, but her usual look of wildness and cunning was\r\nthere, nor were cruelty and nervousness lacking, but over all was the\r\nunmistakable look of the mother\'s pride and love.\r\n\r\nThe base of my tree was hidden in bushes and much lower than the knoll\r\nwhere the den was, so I could come and go at will without scaring the\r\nfoxes.\r\n\r\nFor many days I went there and saw much of the training of the young\r\nones. They early learned to turn to statuettes sound, and then\r\non hearing it again or finding other cause for fear, to run for shelter.\r\n\r\nSome animals have so much mother-love that it overflows and benefits\r\noutsiders. Not so old Vixen it would seem. Her pleasure in the cubs led\r\nto most refined cruelty. For she often brought home to them mice and\r\nbirds alive, and with diabolic gentleness would avoid doing them serious\r\nhurt so that the cubs might have larger scope to torment them.\r\n\r\nThere was a woodchuck that lived over in the hill orchard. He was\r\nneither handsome nor interesting, but he knew how to take care of\r\nhimself. He had dug a den between the roots of an old pine stump, so\r\nthat the foxes could not follow him by digging. But hard work was not\r\ntheir way of life; wits they believed worth more then elbowgrease. This\r\nwoodchuck usually sunned himself on the stump each morning. If he saw a\r\nfox near he went down in the door of his den, or if the enemy was very\r\nnear he went inside and stayed long enough for the danger to pass.\r\n\r\nOne morning Vixen and her mate seemed to decide that it was time the\r\nchildren knew something about the broad subject of Woodchucks,\r\nand further that this orchard woodchuck would serve nicely for an\r\nobject-lesson. So they went together to the orchard-fence unseen by old\r\nChuckie on his stump. Scarface then showed himself in the orchard and\r\nquietly walked in a line so as to pass by the stump at a distance, but\r\nnever once turned his head or allowed the ever-watchful woodchuck to\r\nthink himself seen. When the fox entered the field the woodchuck quietly\r\ndropped down to the mouth of his den: here he waited as the fox passed,\r\nbut concluding that after all wisdom is the better part, went into his\r\nhole.\r\n\r\nThis was what the foxes wanted. Vixen had kept out of sight, but now ran\r\nswiftly to the stump and hid behind it. Scarface had kept straight on,\r\ngoing very slowly. The woodchuck had not been frightened, so before long\r\nhis head popped up between the roots and he looked around. There was\r\nthat fox still going on, farther and farther away. The woodchuck grew\r\nbold as the fox went, and came out farther, and then seeing the coast\r\nclear, he scrambled onto the stump, and with one spring Vixen had him\r\nand shook him till he lay senseless. Scarface had watched out of the\r\ncorner of his eye and now came running back. But Vixen took the chuck in\r\nher jaws and made for the den, so he saw he wasn\'t needed.\r\n\r\nBack to the den came Vix, and carried the chuck so carefully that he was\r\nable to struggle a little when she got there. A low \'woof\' at the den\r\nbrought the little fellows out like schoolboys to play. She threw the\r\nwounded animal to them and they set on him like four little furies,\r\nuttering little growls and biting little bites with all the strength of\r\ntheir baby jaws, but the woodchuck fought for his life and beating them\r\noff slowly hobbled to the shelter of a thicket. The little ones pursued\r\nlike a pack of hounds and dragged at his tail and flanks, but could not\r\nhold him back. So Vixen overtook him with a couple of bounds and dragged\r\nhim again into the open for the children to worry. Again and again this\r\nrough sport went on till one of the little ones was badly bitten, and\r\nhis squeal of pain roused Vix to end the woodchuck\'s misery and serve\r\nhim up at once.\r\n\r\nNot far from the den was a hollow overgrown with coarse grass, the\r\nplayground of a colony of field-mice. The earliest lesson in woodcraft\r\nthat the little ones took, away from the den, was in this hollow.\r\nHere they had their first course of mice, the easiest of all game. In\r\nteaching, the main thing was example, aided by a deep-set instinct.\r\nThe old fox, also, had one or two signs meaning "lie still and watch,"\r\n"come, do as I do," and so on, that were much used.\r\n\r\nSo the merry lot went to this hollow one calm evening and Mother Fox\r\nmade them lie still in the grass. Presently a faint squeak showed that\r\nthe game was astir. Vix rose up and went on tiptoe into the grass--not\r\ncrouching but as high as she could stand, sometimes on her hind legs so\r\nas to get a better view. The runs that the mice follow are hidden under\r\nthe grass tangle, and the only way to know the whereabouts of a mouse is\r\nby seeing the slight shaking of the grass, which is the reason why mice\r\nare hunted only on calm days.\r\n\r\nAnd the trick is to locate the mouse and seize him first and see him\r\nafterward. Vix soon made a spring, and in the middle of the bunch of\r\ndead grass that she grabbed was a field-mouse squeaking his last squeak.\r\n\r\nHe was soon gobbled, and the four awkward little foxes tried to do the\r\nsame as their mother, and when at length the eldest for the first time\r\nin his life caught game, he quivered with excitement and ground his\r\npearly little milk-teeth into the mouse with a rush of inborn savageness\r\nthat must have surprised even himself.\r\n\r\nAnother home lesson was on the red-squirrel. One of these noisy, vulgar\r\ncreatures, lived close by and used to waste part of each day scolding\r\nthe foxes from some safe perch. The cubs made many vain attempts to\r\ncatch him as he ran across their glade from one tree to an other, or\r\nspluttered and scolded at them a foot or so out of reach. But old Vixen\r\nwas up in natural history--she knew squirrel nature and took the case in\r\nhand when the proper time came. She hid the children and lay down flat\r\nin the middle of the open glade. The saucy low-minded squirrel came\r\nand scolded as usual. But she moved no hair. He came nearer and at last\r\nright over head to chatter:\r\n\r\n"You brute you, you brute you."\r\n\r\nBut Vix lay as dead. This was very perplexing, so the squirrel came down\r\nthe trunk and peeping about made a nervous dash across the grass, to\r\nanother tree, again to scold from a safe perch.\r\n\r\n"You brute you, you useless brute, scarrr-scarrrr."\r\n\r\nBut flat and lifeless on the grass lay Vix. This was most tantilizing to\r\nthe squirrel. He was naturally curious and disposed to be venturesome,\r\nso again he came to the ground and scurried across the glade nearer than\r\nbefore. Still as death lay Vix, "surely she was dead." And the little\r\nfoxes began to wonder if their mother wasn\'t asleep.\r\n\r\nBut the squirrel was working himself into a little craze of foolhardy\r\ncuriosity. He had dropped a piece of bark on Vix\'s head, he had used up\r\nhis list of bad words and he had done it all over again, without getting\r\na sign of life. So after a couple more dashes across the glade he\r\nventured within a few feet of the really watchful Vix, who sprang to her\r\nfeet and pinned him in a twinkling.\r\n\r\n"And the little ones picked the bones e-oh."\r\n\r\nThus the rudiments of their education were laid, and afterward as\r\nthey grew stronger they were taken farther afield to begin the higher\r\nbranches of trailing and scenting.\r\n\r\nFor each kind of prey they were taught a way to hunt, for every animal\r\nhas some great strength or it could not live, and some great weakness\r\nor the others could not live. The squirrel\'s weakness was foolish\r\ncuriosity; the fox\'s that he can\'t climb a tree. And the training of\r\nthe little foxes was all shaped to take advantage of the weakness of the\r\nother creatures and to make up for their own by defter play where they\r\nare strong.\r\n\r\nFrom their parents they learned the chief axioms of the fox world. How,\r\nis not easy to say. But that they learned this in company with their\r\nparents was clear.\r\n\r\nHere are some that foxes taught me, without saying a word:--\r\n\r\nNever sleep on your straight track.\r\n\r\nYour nose is before your eyes, then trust it first.\r\n\r\nA fool runs down the wind.\r\n\r\nRunning rills cure many ills.\r\n\r\nNever take the open if you can keep the cover.\r\n\r\nNever leave a straight trail if a crooked one will do.\r\n\r\nIf it\'s strange, it\'s hostile.\r\n\r\nDust and water burn the scent.\r\n\r\nNever hunt mice in a rabbit-woods, or rabbits in a henyard.\r\n\r\nKeep off the grass.\r\n\r\nInklings of the meanings of these were already entering the little ones\'\r\nminds--thus, \'Never follow what you can\'t smell,\' was wise, they could\r\nsee, because if you can\'t smell it, then the wind is so that it must\r\nsmell you.\r\n\r\nOne by one they learned the birds and beasts of their home woods, and\r\nthen as they were able to go abroad with their parents they learned new\r\nanimals. They were beginning to think they knew the scent of everything\r\nthat moved. But one night the mother took them to a field where there\r\nwas a strange black flat thing on the ground. She brought them on\r\npurpose to smell it, but at the first whiff their every hair stood on\r\nend, they trembled, they knew not why--it seemed to tingle through their\r\nblood and fill them with instinctive hate and fear.\r\n\r\nAnd when she saw its full effect she told them--\r\n\r\n"That is man-scent."\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the hens continued to disappear. I had not betrayed the den\r\nof cubs. Indeed, I thought a good deal more of the little rascals than\r\nI did of the hens; but uncle was dreadfully wrought up and made most\r\ndisparaging remarks about my woodcraft. To please him I one day took\r\nthe hound across to the woods and seating myself on a stump on the open\r\nhillside, I bade the dog go on. Within three minutes he sang out in the\r\ntongue all hunters know so well, "Fox! fox! fox! straight away down the\r\nvalley."\r\n\r\nAfter awhile I heard them coming back. There I saw the\r\nfox--Scarface--loping lightly across the river-bottom to the stream. In\r\nhe went and trotted along in the shallow water near the margin for two\r\nhundred yards, then came out straight toward me. Though in full view,\r\nhe saw me not but came up the hill watching over his shoulder for the\r\nhound. Within ten feet of me he turned and sat with his back to me\r\nwhile he craned his neck and showed an eager interest in the doings\r\nof the hound. Ranger came bawling along the trail till he came to the\r\nrunning water, the killer of scent, and here he was puzzled; but there\r\nwas only one thing to do; that was by going up and down both banks find\r\nwhere the fox had left the river.\r\n\r\nThe fox before me shifted his position a little to get a better view and\r\nwatched with a most human interest all the circling of the hound. He was\r\nso close that I saw the hair of his shoulder bristle a little when the\r\ndog came in sight. I could see the jumping of his heart on his ribs,\r\nand the gleam of his yellow eye. When the dog was wholly baulked by the\r\nwater trick, it was comical to see:--he could not sit still, but rocked\r\nup and down in glee, and reared on his hind feet to get a better view\r\nof the slow-plodding hound. With mouth opened nearly to his ears, though\r\nnot at all winded, he panted noisily for a moment, or rather he laughed\r\ngleefully, just as a dog laughs by grinning and panting.\r\n\r\nOld Scarface wriggled in huge enjoyment as the hound puzzled over the\r\ntrail so long that when he did find it, it was so stale he could barely\r\nfollow it, and did not feel justified in tonguing on it at all.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the hound was working up the hill, the fox quietly went into\r\nthe woods. I had been sitting in plain view only ten feet away, but I\r\nhad the wind and kept still and the fox never knew that his life had for\r\ntwenty minutes been in the power of the foe he most feared.\r\n\r\nRanger also would have passed me as near as the fox, but I spoke to him,\r\nand with a little nervous start he quit the trail and looking sheepish\r\nlay down by my feet.\r\n\r\nThis little comedy was played with variations for several days, but\r\nit was all in plain view from the house across the river. My uncle,\r\nimpatient at the daily loss of hens, went out himself, sat on the open\r\nknoll, and when old Scarface trotted to his lookout to watch the dull\r\nhound on the river flat below, my uncle remorselessly shot him in the\r\nback, at the very moment when he was grinning over a new triumph.\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nBut still the hens were disappearing. My uncle was wrathy. He determined\r\nto conduct the war himself, and sowed the woods with poison baits,\r\ntrusting to luck that our own dogs would not get them. He indulged in\r\ncontemptuous remarks on my by-gone woodcraft, and went out evenings with\r\na gun and the two dogs, to see what he could destroy.\r\n\r\nVix knew right well what a poisoned bait was; she passed them by or else\r\ntreated them with active contempt, but one she dropped down the hole\r\nof an old enemy, a skunk, who was never afterward seen. Formerly old\r\nScarface was always ready to take charge of the dogs, and keep them out\r\nof mischief. But now that Vix had the whole burden of the brood, she\r\ncould no longer spend time in breaking every track to the den, and was\r\nnot always at hand to meet and mislead the foes that might be coming too\r\nnear.\r\n\r\nThe end is easily foreseen. Ranger followed a hot trail to the den, and\r\nSpot, the fox-terrier, announced that the family was at home, and then\r\ndid his best to go in after them.\r\n\r\nThe whole secret was now out, and the whole family doomed. The hired man\r\ncame around with pick and shovel to dig them out, while we and the dogs\r\nstood by. Old Vix soon showed herself in the near woods, and led the\r\ndogs away off down the river, where she shook them off when she thought\r\nproper, by the simple device of springing on a sheep\'s back. The\r\nfrightened animal ran for several hundred yards, then Vix got off,\r\nknowing that there was now a hopeless gap in the scent, and returned to\r\nthe den. But the dogs, baffled by the break in the trail, soon did the\r\nsame, to find Vix hanging about in despair, vainly trying to decoy us\r\naway from her treasures.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Paddy plied both pick and shovel with vigor and effect. The\r\nyellow, gravelly sand was heaping on both sides, and the shoulders of\r\nthe sturdy digger were sinking below the level. After an hour\'s digging,\r\nenlivened by frantic rushes of the dogs after the old fox, who hovered\r\nnear in the woods, Pat called:\r\n\r\n"Here they are, sot!"\r\n\r\nIt was the den at the end of the burrow, and cowering as far back as\r\nthey could, were the four little woolly cubs.\r\n\r\nBefore I could interfere, a murderous blow from the shovel, and a sudden\r\nrush for the fierce little terrier, ended the lives of three. The fourth\r\nand smallest was barely saved by holding him by his tail high out of\r\nreach of the excited dogs.\r\n\r\nHe gave one short squeal, and his poor mother came at the cry, and\r\ncircled so near that she would have been shot but for the accidental\r\nprotection of the dogs, who somehow always seemed to get between, and\r\nwhom she once more led away on a fruitless chase.\r\n\r\nThe little one saved alive was dropped into a bag, where he lay quite\r\nstill. His unfortunate brothers were thrown back into their nursery bed,\r\nand buried under a few shovelfuls of earth.\r\n\r\nWe guilty ones then went back into the house, and the little fox was\r\nsoon chained in the yard. No one knew just why he was kept alive, but\r\nin all a change of feeling had set in, and the idea of killing him was\r\nwithout a supporter.\r\n\r\nHe was a pretty little fellow, like a cross between a fox and a lamb.\r\nHis woolly visage and form were strangely lamb-like and innocent, but\r\none could find in his yellow eyes a gleam of cunning and savageness as\r\nunlamb-like as it possibly could be.\r\n\r\nAs long as anyone was near he crouched sullen and cowed in his\r\nshelter-box, and it was a full hour after being left alone before he\r\nventured to look out.\r\n\r\nMy window now took the place of the hollow bass wood. A number of hens\r\nof the breed he knew so well were about the cub in the yard. Late that\r\nafternoon as they strayed near the captive there was a sudden rattle of\r\nthe chain, and the youngster dashed at the nearest one and would have\r\ncaught him but for the chain which brought him up with a jerk. He got on\r\nhis feet and slunk back to his box, and though he afterward made several\r\nrushes he so gauged his leap as to win or fail within the length of the\r\nchain and never again was brought up by its cruel jerk.\r\n\r\nAs night came down the little fellow became very uneasy, sneaking out of\r\nhis box, but going back at each slight alarm, tugging at his chain, or\r\nat times biting it in fury while he held it down with his fore paws.\r\nSuddenly he paused as though listening, then raising his little black\r\nnose he poured out a short quavering cry. Once or twice this was\r\nrepeated, the time between being occupied in worrying the chain and\r\nrunning about. Then an answer came. The far-away Yap-yurrr of the old\r\nfox. A few minutes later a shadowy form appeared on the wood-pile. The\r\nlittle one slunk into his box, but at once returned and ran to meet his\r\nmother with all the gladness that a fox could show. Quick as a flash\r\nshe seized him and turned to bear him away by the road she came. But the\r\nmoment the end of the chain was reached the cub was rudely jerked from\r\nthe old one\'s mouth, and she, scared by the opening of a window, fled\r\nover the wood-pile.\r\n\r\nAn hour afterward the cub had ceased to run about or cry. I peeped out,\r\nand by the light of the moon saw the form of the mother at full length\r\non the ground by the little one, gnawing at something--the clank of iron\r\ntold what, it was that cruel chain. And Tip, the little one, meanwhile\r\nwas helping himself to a warm drink.\r\n\r\nOn my going out she fled into the dark woods, but there by the\r\nshelter-box were two little mice, bloody and still warm, food for the\r\ncub brought by the devoted mother. And in the morning I found the chain\r\nwas very bright for a foot or two next the little one\'s collar.\r\n\r\nOn walking across the woods to the ruined den, I again found signs of\r\nVixen. The poor heart-broken mother had come and dug out the bedraggled\r\nbodies of her little ones.\r\n\r\nThere lay the three little baby foxes all licked smooth now, and by them\r\nwere two of our hens fresh killed. The newly heaved earth was printed\r\nall over with telltale signs--signs that told me that here by the side\r\nof her dead she had watched like Rizpah. Here she had brought their\r\nusual meal, the spoil of her nightly hunt. Here she had stretched\r\nherself beside them and vainly offered them their natural drink and\r\nyearned to feed and warm them as of old, but only stiff little bodies\r\nunder their soft wool she found, and little cold noses still and\r\nunresponsive.\r\n\r\nA deep impress of elbows, breasts, and hocks showed where she had laid\r\nin silent grief and watched them for long and mourned as a wild mother\r\ncan mourn for its young. But from that time she came no more to the\r\nruined den, for now she surely knew that her little ones were dead.\r\nTip the captive, the weakling of the brood, was now the heir to all her\r\nlove. The dogs were loosed to guard the hens. The hired man had orders\r\nto shoot the old fox on sight--so had I but was resolved never to see\r\nher. Chicken-heads, that a fox loves and a dog will not touch, had been\r\npoisoned and scattered through the woods; and the only way to the yard\r\nwhere Tip was tied, was by climbing the wood-pile after braving all\r\nother dangers.\r\n\r\nAnd yet each night old Vix was there to nurse her baby and bring it\r\nfresh-killed hens and game. Again and again I saw her, although she came\r\nnow without awaiting the querulous cry of the captive.\r\n\r\nThe second night of the captivity I heard the rattle of the chain, and\r\nthen made out that the old fox was there, hard at work digging a hole by\r\nthe little one\'s kennel. When it was deep enough to half bury her, she\r\ngathered into it all the slack of the chain, and filled it again with\r\nearth. Then in triumph thinking she had gotten rid of the chain, she\r\nseized little Tip by the neck and turned to dash off up the wood-pile,\r\nbut alas! only to have him jerked roughly from her grasp.\r\n\r\nPoor little fellow, he whimpered sadly as he crawled into his box. After\r\nhalf an hour there was a great out cry among the dogs, and by their\r\nstraight-away tonguing through the far wood I knew they were chasing\r\nVix. Away up north they went in the direction of the railway and their\r\nnoise faded from hearing. Next morning the hound had not come back.\r\nWe soon knew why. Foxes long ago learned what a railroad is; they soon\r\ndevised several ways of turning it to account. One way is when hunted to\r\nwalk the rails for a long distance just before a train comes. The scent,\r\nalways poor on iron, is destroyed by the train and there is always a\r\nchance of hounds being killed by the engine. But another way more sure,\r\nbut harder to play, is to lead the hounds straight to a high trestle\r\njust ahead of the train, so that the engine overtakes them on it and\r\nthey are surely dashed to destruction.\r\n\r\nThis trick was skilfully played, and down below we found the mangled\r\nremains of old Ranger and learned that Vix was already wreaking her\r\nrevenge.\r\n\r\nThat same night she returned to the yard before Spot\'s weary limbs\r\ncould bring him back and killed another hen and brought it to Tip, and\r\nstretched her panting length beside him that he might quench his thirst.\r\nFor she seemed to think he had no food but what she brought.\r\n\r\nIt was that hen that betrayed to my uncle the nightly visits.\r\n\r\nMy own sympathies were all turning to Vix, and I would have no hand in\r\nplanning further murders. Next night my uncle himself watched, gun in\r\nhand, for an hour. Then when it became cold and the moon clouded over\r\nhe remembered other important business elsewhere, and left Paddy in his\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nBut Paddy was "onaisy" as the stillness and anxiety of watching worked\r\non his nerves. And the loud bang! bang! an hour later left us sure only\r\nthat powder had been burned.\r\n\r\nIn the morning we found Vix had not failed her young one. Again next\r\nnight found my uncle on guard for another hen had been taken. Soon\r\nafter dark a single shot was heard, but Vix dropped the game she was\r\nbringing and escaped. Another attempt made that night called forth\r\nanother gunshot. Yet next day it was seen by the brightness of the chain\r\nthat she had come again and vainly tried for hours to cut that hateful\r\nbond.\r\n\r\nSuch courage and stanch fidelity were bound to win respect, if not\r\ntoleration. At any rate, there was no gunner in wait next night, when\r\nall was still. Could it be of any use? Driven off thrice with gunshots,\r\nwould she make another try to feed or free her captive young one? Would\r\nshe? Hers was a mother\'s love. There was but one to watch them this\r\ntime, the fourth night, when the quavering whine of the little one was\r\nfollowed by that shadowy form above the wood pile.\r\n\r\nBut carrying no fowl or food that could be seen. Had the keen huntress\r\nfailed at last? Had she no head of game for this her only charge, or had\r\nshe learned to trust his captors for his food?\r\n\r\nNo, far from all this. The wild-wood mother\'s heart and hate were true.\r\nHer only thought had been to set him free. All means she knew she tried,\r\nand every danger braved to tend him well and help him to be free. But\r\nall had failed.\r\n\r\nLike a shadow she came and in a moment was gone, and Tip seized on\r\nsomething dropped, and crunched and chewed with relish what she brought.\r\nBut even as he ate, a knife-like pang shot through and a scream of pain\r\nescaped him. Then there was a momentary struggle and the little fox was\r\ndead.\r\n\r\nThe mother\'s love was strong in Vix, but a higher thought was stronger.\r\nShe knew right well the poison\'s power; she knew the poison bait, and\r\nwould have taught him had he lived to know and shun it too. But now at\r\nlast when she must choose for him a wretched prisoner\'s life or sudden\r\ndeath, she quenched the mother in her breast and freed him by the one\r\nremaining door.\r\n\r\nIt is when the snow is on the ground that we take the census of the\r\nwoods, and when the winter came it told me that Vix no longer roamed the\r\nwoods of Erindale. Where she went it never told, but only this, that she\r\nwas gone.\r\n\r\nGone, perhaps, to some other far-off haunt to leave behind the sad\r\nremembrance of her murdered little ones and mate. Or gone, may be,\r\ndeliberately, from the scene of a sorrowful life, as many a wild-wood\r\nmother has gone, by the means that she herself had used to free her\r\nyoung one, the last of all her brood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PACING MUSTANG\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nJO CALONE threw down his saddle on the dusty ground, turned his horses\r\nloose, and went clanking into the ranchhouse.\r\n\r\n"Nigh about chuck time?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"Seventeen minutes," said the cook glancing at the Waterbury, with the\r\nair of a train starter, though this show of precision had never yet been\r\njustified by events.\r\n\r\n"How\'s things on the Perico?" said Jo\'s pard.\r\n\r\n"Hotter\'n hinges," said Jo. "Cattle seem O.K.; lots of calves."\r\n\r\n"I seen that bunch o\' mustangs that waters at Antelope Springs; couple\r\no\' colts along; one little dark one, a fair dandy; a born pacer. I run\r\nthem a mile or two, and he led the bunch, an\' never broke his pace.\r\nCut loose, an\' pushed them jest for fun, an\' darned if I could make him\r\nbreak."\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t have no reefreshments along?" said Scarth, incredulously.\r\n\r\n"That\'s all right, Scarth. You had to crawl on our last bet, an\' you\'ll\r\nget another chance soon as you\'re man enough."\r\n\r\n"Chuck," shouted the cook, and the subject was dropped. Next day the\r\nscene of the roundup was changed, and the mustangs were forgotten.\r\n\r\nA year later the same corner of New Mexico was worked over by the\r\nroundup, and again the mustang bunch was seen. The dark colt was now a\r\nblack yearling, with thin, clean legs and glossy flanks; and more than\r\none of the boys saw with his own eyes this oddity--the mustang was a\r\nborn pacer. Jo was along, and the idea now struck him that that colt\r\nwas worth having. To an Easterner this thought may not seem startling\r\nor original, but in the West, where an unbroken horse is worth $5, and\r\nwhere an ordinary saddlehorse is worth $15 or $20, the idea of a wild\r\nmustang being desirable property does not occur to the average cowboy,\r\nfor mustangs are hard to catch, and when caught are merely wild animal\r\nprisoners, perfectly useless and untamable to the last. Not a few of the\r\ncattle-owners make a point of shooting all mustangs at sight, they are\r\nnot only useless cumberers of the feeding-grounds, but commonly lead\r\naway domestic horses, which soon take to wild life and are thenceforth\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nWild Jo Calone knew a \'bronk right down to subsoil.\' "I never seen a\r\nwhite that wasn\'t soft, nor a chestnut that wasn\'t nervous, nor a bay\r\nthat wasn\'t good if broke right, nor a black that wasn\'t hard as nails,\r\nan\' full of the old Harry. All a black bronk wants is claws to be wus\'n\r\nDaniel\'s hull outfit of lions."\r\n\r\nSince, then, a mustang is worthless vermin, and a black mustang ten\r\ntimes worse than worthless, Jo\'s pard "didn\'t see no sense in Jo\'s\r\nwantin\' to corral the yearling," as he now seemed intent on doing. But\r\nJo got no chance to try that year.\r\n\r\nHe was only a cow-puncher on $25 a month, and tied to hours. Like most\r\nof the boys, he always looked forward to having a ranch and an outfit\r\nof his own. His brand, the hogpen, of sinister suggestion, was already\r\nregistered at Santa Fe, but of horned stock it was borne by a single old\r\ncow, so as to give him a legal right to put his brand on any maverick\r\n(or unbranded animal) he might chance to find.\r\n\r\nYet each fall, when paid off, Jo could not resist the temptation to go\r\nto town with the boys and have a good time \'while the stuff held out.\'\r\nSo that his property consisted of little more than his saddle, his bed,\r\nand his old cow. He kept on hoping to make a strike that would leave him\r\nwell fixed with a fair start, and when the thought came that the Black\r\nMustang was his mascot, he only needed a chance to \'make the try.\'\r\n\r\nThe roundup circled down to the Canadian River, and back in the fall by\r\nthe Don Carlos Hills, and Jo saw no more of the Pacer, though he heard\r\nof him from many quarters, for the colt, now a vigorous, young horse,\r\nrising three, was beginning to be talked of.\r\n\r\nAntelope Springs is in the middle of a great level plain. When the water\r\nis high it spreads into a small lake with a belt of sedge around it;\r\nwhen it is low there is a wide flat of black mud, glistening white with\r\nalkali in places, and the spring a water-hole in the middle. It has no\r\nflow or outlet and is fairly good water, the only drinking-place for\r\nmany miles.\r\n\r\nThis flat, or prairie as it would be called farther north, was the\r\nfavorite feeding-ground of the Black Stallion, but it was also the\r\npasture of many herds of range horses and cattle. Chiefly interested was\r\nthe \'L cross F\' outfit. Foster, the manager and part owner, was a man of\r\nenterprise. He believed it would pay to handle a better class of cattle\r\nand horses on the range, and one of his ventures was ten half-blooded\r\nmares, tall, clean-limbed, deer-eyed creatures that made the scrub\r\ncow-ponies look like pitiful starvelings of some degenerate and quite\r\ndifferent species.\r\n\r\nOne of these was kept stabled for use, but the nine, after the weaning\r\nof their colts, managed to get away and wandered off on the range.\r\n\r\nA horse has a fine instinct for the road to the best feed, and the nine\r\nmares drifted, of course, to the prairie of Antelope Springs, twenty\r\nmiles to the southward. And when, later that summer Foster went to round\r\nthem up, he found the nine indeed, but with them and guarding them with\r\nan air of more than mere comradeship was a coal-black stallion, prancing\r\naround and rounding up the bunch like an expert, his jet-black coat a\r\nvivid contrast to the golden hides of his harem.\r\n\r\nThe mares were gentle, and would have been easily driven homeward\r\nbut for a new and unexpected thing. The Black Stallion became greatly\r\naroused. He seemed to inspire them too with his wildness, and flying\r\nthis way and that way drove the whole band at full gallop where he\r\nwould. Away they went, and the little cow-ponies that carried the men\r\nwere easily left behind.\r\n\r\nThis was maddening, and both men at last drew their guns and sought a\r\nchance to drop that \'blasted stallion.\' But no chance came that was not\r\n9 to 1 of dropping one of the mares. A long day of manoeuvring made\r\nno change. The Pacer, for it was he, kept his family together and\r\ndisappeared among the southern sand-hills. The cattlemen on their jaded\r\nponies set out for home with the poor satisfaction of vowing vengeance\r\nfor their failure on the superb cause of it.\r\n\r\nOne of the most aggravating parts of it was that one or two experiences\r\nlike this would surely make the mares as wild as the Mustang, and there\r\nseemed to be no way of saving them from it.\r\n\r\nScientists differ on the power of beauty and prowess to attract female\r\nadmiration among the lower animals, but whether it is admiration or the\r\nprowess itself, it is certain that a wild animal of uncommon gifts soon\r\nwins a large following from the harems of his rivals. And the great\r\nBlack Horse, with his inky mane and tail and his green-lighted eyes,\r\nranged through all that region and added to his following from many\r\nbands till not less than a score of mares were in his \'bunch.\' Most were\r\nmerely humble cow-ponies turned out to range, but the nine great mares\r\nwere there, a striking group by themselves. According to all reports,\r\nthis bunch was always kept rounded up and guarded with such energy and\r\njealously that a mare, once in it, was a lost animal so far as man was\r\nconcerned, and the ranchmen realized soon that they had gotten on the\r\nrange a mustang that was doing them more harm than all other sources of\r\nloss put together.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nIt was December, 1893. I was new in the country, and was setting out\r\nfrom the ranch-house on the Pinavetitos, to go with a wagon to the\r\nCanadian River. As I was leaving, Foster finished his remark by: "And if\r\nyou get a chance to draw a bead on that accursed mustang, don\'t fail to\r\ndrop him in his tracks."\r\n\r\nThis was the first I had heard of him, and as I rode along I gathered\r\nfrom Burns, my guide, the history that has been given. I was full\r\nof curiosity to see the famous three-year-old, and was not a little\r\ndisappointed on the second day when we came to the prairie on Antelope\r\nSprings and saw no sign of the Pacer or his band.\r\n\r\nBut on the next day, as we crossed the Alamosa Arroyo, and were rising\r\nto the rolling prairie again, Jack Burns, who was riding on ahead,\r\nsuddenly dropped flat on the neck of his horse, and swung back to me in\r\nthe wagon, saying:\r\n\r\n"Get out your rifle, here\'s that--stallion."\r\n\r\nI seized my rifle, and hurried forward to a view over the prairie ridge.\r\nIn the hollow below was a band of horses, and there at one end was the\r\nGreat Black Mustang. He had heard some sound of our approach, and was\r\nnot unsuspicious of danger. There he stood with head and tail erect,\r\nand nostrils wide, an image of horse perfection and beauty, as noble an\r\nanimal as ever ranged the plains, and the mere notion of turning that\r\nmagnificent creature into a mass of carrion was horrible. In spite\r\nof Jack\'s exhortation to \'shoot quick,\' I delayed, and threw open\r\nthe breach, whereupon he, always hot and hasty, swore at my slowness,\r\ngrowled, \'Gi\' me that gun,\' and as he seized it I turned the muzzle up,\r\nand accidentally the gun went off.\r\n\r\nInstantly the herd below was all alarm, the great black leader snorted\r\nand neighed and dashed about. And the mares bunched, and away all went\r\nin a rumble of hoofs, and a cloud of dust.\r\n\r\nThe Stallion careered now on this side, now on that, and kept his eye on\r\nall and led and drove them far away. As long as I could see I watched,\r\nand never once did he break his pace.\r\n\r\nJack made Western remarks about me and my gun, as well as that mustang,\r\nbut I rejoiced in the Pacer\'s strength and beauty, and not for all the\r\nmares in the bunch would I have harmed his glossy hide.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThere are several ways of capturing wild horses. One is by\r\ncreasing--that is, grazing the animal\'s nape with a rifle-ball so that\r\nhe is stunned long enough for hobbling.\r\n\r\n"Yes! I seen about a hundred necks broke trying it, but I never seen a\r\nmustang creased yet," was Wild Jo\'s critical remark.\r\n\r\nSometimes, if the shape of the country abets it, the herd can be driven\r\ninto a corral; sometimes with extra fine mounts they can be run down,\r\nbut by far the commonest way, paradoxical as it may seem, is to walk\r\nthem down.\r\n\r\nThe fame of the Stallion that never was known to gallop was spreading.\r\nExtraordinary stories were told of his gait, his speed, and his wind,\r\nand when old Montgomery of the \'triangle-bar\' outfit came out plump at\r\nWell\'s Hotel in Clayton, and in presence of witnesses said he\'d give one\r\nthousand dollars cash for him safe in a box-car, providing the stories\r\nwere true, a dozen young cow-punchers were eager to cut loose and win\r\nthe purse, as soon as present engagements were up. But Wild Jo had had\r\nhis eye on this very deal for quite a while; there was no time to\r\nlose, so ignoring present contracts he rustled all night to raise the\r\nnecessary equipment for the game.\r\n\r\nBy straining his already overstrained credit, and taxing the already\r\novertaxed generosity of his friends, he got together an expedition\r\nconsisting of twenty good saddle-horses, a mess-wagon, and a fortnight\'s\r\nstuff for three men--himself, his \'pard,\' Charley, and the cook.\r\n\r\nThen they set out from Clayton, with the avowed intention of walking\r\ndown the wonderfully swift wild horse. The third day they arrived at\r\nAntelope Springs, and as it was about noon they were not surprised to\r\nsee the black Pacer marching down to drink with all his band behind him.\r\nJo kept out of sight until the wild horses each and all had drunk their\r\nfill, for a thirsty animal always travels better than one laden with\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nJo then rode quietly forward. The Pacer took alarm at half a mile, and\r\nled his band away out of sight on the soapweed mesa to the southeast. Jo\r\nfollowed at a gallop till he once more sighted them, then came back and\r\ninstructed the cook, who was also teamster, to make for Alamosa Arroyo\r\nin the south. Then away to the southeast he went after the mustangs.\r\nAfter a mile or two he once more sighted them, and walked his horse\r\nquietly till so near that they again took alarm and circled away to the\r\nsouth. An hour\'s trot, not on the trail, but cutting across to where\r\nthey ought to go, brought Jo again in close sight. Again he walked\r\nquietly toward the herd, and again there was the alarm and fright. And\r\nso they passed the afternoon, but circled ever more and more to the\r\nsouth, so that when the sun was low they were, as Jo had expected, not\r\nfar from Alamosa Arroyo. The band was again close at hand, and Jo,\r\nafter starting them off, rode to the wagon, while his pard, who had been\r\ntaking it easy, took up the slow chase on a fresh horse.\r\n\r\nAfter supper the wagon moved on to the upper ford of the Alamosa, as\r\narranged, and there camped for the night.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Charley followed the herd. They had not run so far as at\r\nfirst, for their pursuer made no sign of attack, and they were getting\r\nused to his company. They were more easily found, as the shadows fell,\r\non account of a snow-white mare that was in the bunch. A young moon in\r\nthe sky now gave some help, and relying on his horse to choose the path,\r\nCharley kept him quietly walking after the herd, represented by that\r\nghost-white mare, till they were lost in the night. He then got off,\r\nunsaddled and picketed his horse, and in his blanket quickly went to\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nAt the first streak of dawn he was up, and within a short half-mile,\r\nthanks to the snowy mare, he found the band. At his approach, the shrill\r\nneigh of the Pacer bugled his troop into a flying squad. But on the\r\nfirst mesa they stopped, and faced about to see what this persistent\r\nfollower was, and what he wanted. For a moment or so they stood against\r\nthe sky to gaze, and then deciding that he knew him as well as he wished\r\nto, that black meteor flung his mane on the wind, and led off at his\r\ntireless, even swing, while the mares came streaming after.\r\n\r\nAway they went, circling now to the west, and after several repetitions\r\nof this same play, flying, following, and overtaking, and flying again,\r\nthey passed, near noon, the old Apache look-out, Buffalo Bluff. And\r\nhere, on watch, was Jo. A long thin column of smoke told Charley to come\r\nto camp, and with a flashing pocket-mirror he made response. Jo, freshly\r\nmounted, rode across, and again took up the chase, and back came Charley\r\nto camp to eat and rest, and then move on up stream.\r\n\r\nAll that day Jo followed, and managed, when it was needed, that the herd\r\nshould keep the great circle, of which the wagon cut a small chord. At\r\nsundown he came to Verde Crossing, and there was Charley with a fresh\r\nhorse and food, and Jo went on in the same calm, dogged way. All the\r\nevening he followed, and far into the night, for the wild herd was now\r\ngetting somewhat used to the presence of the harmless strangers, and\r\nwere more easily followed; moreover, they were tiring out with perpetual\r\ntraveling. They were no longer in the good grass country, they were not\r\ngrain-fed like the horses on their track, and above all, the slight\r\nbut continuous nervous tension was surely telling. It spoiled their\r\nappetites, but made them very thirsty. They were allowed, and as far\r\nas possible encouraged, to drink deeply at every chance. The effect of\r\nlarge quantities of water on a running animal is well known; it tends to\r\nstiffen the limbs and spoil the wind. Jo carefully guarded his own horse\r\nagainst such excess, and both he and his horse were fresh when they\r\ncamped that night on the trail of the jaded mustangs.\r\n\r\nAt dawn he found them easily close at hand, and though they ran at first\r\nthey did not go far before they dropped into a walk. The battle seemed\r\nnearly won now, for the chief difficulty in the \'walk-down\' is to keep\r\ntrack of the herd the first two or three days when they are fresh.\r\n\r\nAll that morning Jo kept in sight, generally in close sight, of the\r\nband. About ten o\'clock, Charley relieved him near Jos. Peak and that\r\nday the mustangs walked only a quarter of a mile ahead with much less\r\nspirit than the day before and circled now more north again. At night\r\nCharley was supplied with a fresh horse and followed as before.\r\n\r\nNext day the mustangs walked with heads held low, and in spite of the\r\nefforts of the Black Pacer at times they were less than a hundred yards\r\nahead of their pursuer.\r\n\r\nThe fourth and fifth days passed the same way, and now the herd was\r\nnearly back to Antelope Springs. So far all had come out as expected.\r\nThe chase had been in a great circle with the wagon following a lesser\r\ncircle. The wild herd was back to its starting-point, worn out; and the\r\nhunters were back, fresh and on fresh horses. The herd was kept from\r\ndrinking till late in the afternoon and then driven to the Springs to\r\nswell themselves with a perfect water gorge. Now was the chance for the\r\nskilful ropers on the grain-fed horses to close in, for the sudden heavy\r\ndrink was ruination, almost paralysis, of wind and limb, and it would be\r\neasy to rope and hobble them one by one.\r\n\r\nThere was only one weak spot in the programme, the Black Stallion, the\r\ncause of the hunt, seemed made of iron, that ceaseless swinging pace\r\nseemed as swift and vigorous now as on the morning when the chase began.\r\nUp and down he went rounding up the herd and urging them on by voice and\r\nexample to escape. But they were played out. The old white mare that\r\nhad been such help in sighting them at night, had dropped out hours ago,\r\ndead beat. The half-bloods seemed to be losing all fear of the horsemen,\r\nthe band was clearly in Jo\'s power. But the one who was the prize of all\r\nthe hunt seemed just as far as ever out of reach.\r\n\r\nHere was a puzzle. Jo\'s comrades knew him well and would not have been\r\nsurprised to see him in a sudden rage attempt to shoot the Stallion\r\ndown. But Jo had no such mind. During that long week of following he\r\nhad watched the horse all day at speed and never once had he seen him\r\ngallop.\r\n\r\nThe horseman\'s adoration of a noble horse had grown and grown, till now\r\nhe would as soon have thought of shooting his best mount as firing on\r\nthat splendid beast.\r\n\r\nJo even asked himself whether he would take the handsome sum that was\r\noffered for the prize. Such an animal would be a fortune in himself to\r\nsire a race of pacers for the track.\r\n\r\nBut the prize was still at large--the time had come to finish up the\r\nhunt. Jo\'s finest mount was caught. She was a mare of Eastern blood, but\r\nraised on the plains. She never would have come into Jo\'s possession but\r\nfor a curious weakness. The loco is a poisonous weed that grows in these\r\nregions. Most stock will not touch it; but sometimes an animal tries it\r\nand becomes addicted to it.\r\n\r\nIt acts somewhat like morphine, but the animal, though sane for long\r\nintervals, has always a passion for the herb and finally dies mad. A\r\nbeast with the craze is said to be locoed. And Jo\'s best mount had a\r\nwild gleam in her eye that to an expert told the tale.\r\n\r\nBut she was swift and strong and Jo chose her for the grand finish of\r\nthe chase. It would have been an easy matter now to rope the mares, but\r\nwas no longer necessary. They could be separated from their black leader\r\nand driven home to the corral. But that leader still had the look of\r\nuntamed strength. Jo, rejoicing in a worthy foe, went bounding forth to\r\ntry the odds. The lasso was flung on the ground and trailed to take out\r\nevery kink, and gathered as he rode into neatest coils across his left\r\npalm. Then putting on the spur the first time in that chase he rode\r\nstraight for the Stallion a quarter of a mile beyond. Away he went, and\r\naway went Jo, each at his best, while the fagged-out mares scattered\r\nright and left and let them pass. Straight across the open plain the\r\nfresh horse went at its hardest gallop, and the Stallion, leading off,\r\nstill kept his start and kept his famous swing.\r\n\r\nIt was incredible, and Jo put on more spur and shouted to his horse,\r\nwhich fairly flew, but shortened up the space between by not a single\r\ninch. For the Black One whirled across the flat and up and passed a\r\nsoap-weed mesa and down across a sandy treacherous plain, then over a\r\ngrassy stretch where prairie dogs barked, then hid below, and on came\r\nJo, but there to see, could he believe his eyes, the Stallion\'s start\r\ngrown longer still, and Jo began to curse his luck, and urge and spur\r\nhis horse until the poor uncertain brute got into such a state of\r\nnervous fright, her eyes began to roll, she wildly shook her head from\r\nside to side, no longer picked her ground--a badger-hole received her\r\nfoot and down she went, and Jo went flying to the earth. Though badly\r\nbruised, he gained his feet and tried to mount his crazy beast. But she,\r\npoor brute, was done for--her off fore-leg hung loose.\r\n\r\nThere was but one thing to do. Jo loosed the cinch, put Lightfoot out of\r\npain, and carried back the saddle to the camp. While the Pacer steamed\r\naway till lost to view.\r\n\r\nThis was not quite defeat, for all the mares were manageable now, and Jo\r\nand Charley drove them carefully to the \'L cross F\' corral and claimed a\r\ngood reward. But Jo was more than ever bound to own the Stallion. He had\r\nseen what stuff he was made of, he prized him more and more, and only\r\nsought to strike some better plan to catch him.\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nThe cook on that trip was Bates--Mr. Thomas Bates, he called himself at\r\nthe post-office where he regularly went for the letters and remittance\r\nwhich never came. Old Tom Turkeytrack, the boys called him, from\r\nhis cattle-brand, which he said was on record at Denver, and which,\r\naccording to his story, was also borne by countless beef and saddle\r\nstock on the plains of the unknown North.\r\n\r\nWhen asked to join the trip as a partner, Bates made some sarcastic\r\nremarks about horses not fetching $12 a dozen, which had been literally\r\ntrue within the year, and he preferred to go on a very meagre salary.\r\nBut no one who once saw the Pacer going had failed to catch the craze.\r\nTurkeytrack experienced the usual change of heart. He now wanted to own\r\nthat mustang. How this was to be brought about he did not clearly see\r\ntill one day there called at the ranch that had \'secured his services,\'\r\nas he put it, one, Bill Smith, more usually known as Horseshoe Billy,\r\nfrom his cattle-brand. While the excellent fresh beef and bread and the\r\nvile coffee, dried peaches and molasses were being consumed, he of the\r\nhorseshoe remarked, in tones which percolated through a huge stop-gap of\r\nbread:\r\n\r\n"Wall, I seen that thar Pacer to-day, nigh enough to put a plait in his\r\ntail."\r\n\r\n"What, you didn\'t shoot?"\r\n\r\n"No, but I come mighty near it."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you be led into no sich foolishness," said a \'double-bar H\'\r\ncow-puncher at the other end of the table. "I calc\'late that maverick\r\n\'ill carry my brand before the moon changes."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll have to be pretty spry or you\'ll find a \'triangle dot\' on his\r\nweather side when you get there."\r\n\r\n"Where did you run across him?"\r\n\r\n"Wail, it was like this; I was riding the flat by Antelope Springs and\r\nI sees a lump on the dry mud inside the rush belt. I knowed I never seen\r\nthat before, so I rides up, thinking it might be some of our stock, an\'\r\nseen it was a horse lying plumb flat. The wind was blowing like--from\r\nhim to me, so I rides up close and seen it was the Pacer, dead as a\r\nmackerel. Still, he didn\'t look swelled or cut, and there wa\'n\'t no\r\nsmell, an\' I didn\'t know what to think till I seen his ear twitch off a\r\nfly and then I knowed he was sleeping. I gits down me rope and coils it,\r\nand seen it was old and pretty shaky in spots, and me saddle a single\r\ncinch, an\' me pony about 700 again a 1,200 lbs. stallion, an\' I sez to\r\nmeself, sez I: \'Tain\'t no use, I\'ll only break me cinch and git throwed\r\nan\' lose me saddle.\' So I hits the saddle-horn a crack with the hondu,\r\nand I wish\'t you\'d a seen that mustang. He lept six foot in the air an\'\r\nsnorted like he was shunting cars. His eyes fairly bugged out an\' he\r\nlighted out lickety split for California, and he orter be there about\r\nnow if he kep\' on like he started--and I swear he never made a break the\r\nhull trip."\r\n\r\nThe story was not quite so consecutive as given here. It was much\r\npunctuated by present engrossments, and from first to last was more or\r\nless infiltrated through the necessaries of life, for Bill was a healthy\r\nyoung man without a trace of false shame. But the account was complete\r\nand everyone believed it, for Billy was known to be reliable. Of all\r\nthose who heard, old Turkeytrack talked the least and probably thought\r\nthe most, for it gave him a new idea.\r\n\r\nDuring his after-dinner pipe he studied it out and deciding that he\r\ncould not go it alone, he took Horseshoe Billy into his council and the\r\nresult was a partnership in a new venture to capture the Pacer; that is,\r\nthe $5,000 that was now said to be the offer for him safe in a box-car.\r\n\r\nAntelope Springs was still the usual watering-place of the Pacer. The\r\nwater being low left a broad belt of dry black mud between the sedge and\r\nthe spring. At two places this belt was broken by a well-marked trail\r\nmade by the animals coming to drink. Horses and wild animals usually\r\nkept to these trails, though the horned cattle had no hesitation in\r\ntaking a short cut through the sedge.\r\n\r\nIn the most used of these trails the two men set to work with shovels\r\nand dug a pit 15 feet long, 6 feet wide and 7 feet deep. It was a\r\nhard twenty hours work for them as it had to be completed between\r\nthe Mustang\'s drinks, and it began to be very damp work before it was\r\nfinished. With poles, brush, and earth it was then cleverly covered over\r\nand concealed. And the men went to a distance and hid in pits made for\r\nthe purpose.\r\n\r\nAbout noon the Pacer came, alone now since the capture of his band.\r\nThe trail on the opposite side of the mud belt was little used, and old\r\nTom, by throwing some fresh rushes across it, expected to make sure\r\nthat the Stallion would enter by the other, if indeed he should by any\r\ncaprice try to come by the unusual path.\r\n\r\nWhat sleepless angel is it watches over and cares for the wild animals?\r\nIn spite of all reasons to take the usual path, the Pacer came along the\r\nother. The suspicious-looking rushes did not stop him; he walked calmly\r\nto the water and drank. There was only one way now to prevent utter\r\nfailure; when he lowered his head for the second draft which horses\r\nalways take, Bates and Smith quit their holes and ran swiftly toward\r\nthe trail behind him, and when he raised his proud head Smith sent a\r\nrevolver shot into the ground behind him.\r\n\r\nAway went the Pacer at his famous gait straight to the trap. Another\r\nsecond and he would be into it. Already he is on the trail, and already\r\nthey feel they have him, but the Angel of the wild things is with him,\r\nthat incomprehensible warning comes, and with one mighty bound he clears\r\nthe fifteen feet of treacherous ground and spurns the earth as he fades\r\naway unharmed, never again to visit Antelope Springs by either of the\r\nbeaten paths.\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nWild Jo never lacked energy. He meant to catch that Mustang, and when he\r\nlearned that others were bestirring themselves for the same purpose\r\nhe at once set about trying the best untried plan he knew--the plan by\r\nwhich the coyote catches the fleeter jackrabbit, and the mounted Indian\r\nthe far swifter antelope--the old plan of the relay chase.\r\n\r\nThe Canadian River on the south, its affluent, the Pinavetitos Arroyo,\r\non the northeast, and the Don Carlos Hills with the Ute Creek Canyon on\r\nthe west, formed a sixty-mile triangle that was the range of the Pacer.\r\nIt was believed that he never went outside this, and at all times\r\nAntelope Springs was his headquarters.\r\n\r\nJo knew this country well, all the water-holes and canon crossings as\r\nwell as the ways of the Pacer.\r\n\r\nIf he could have gotten fifty good horses he could have posted them to\r\nadvantage so as to cover all points, but twenty mounts and five good\r\nriders were all that proved available.\r\n\r\nThe horses, grain-fed for two weeks before, were sent on ahead; each man\r\nwas instructed how to play his part and sent to his post the day before\r\nthe race. On the day of the start Jo with his wagon drove to the plain\r\nof Antelope Springs and, camping far off in a little draw, waited.\r\n\r\nAt last he came, that coal-black Horse, out from the sand-hills at the\r\nsouth, alone as always now, and walked calmly down to the Springs and\r\ncircled quite around it to sniff for any hidden foe. Then he approached\r\nwhere there was no trail at all and drank.\r\n\r\nJo watched and wished that he would drink a hogs-head. But the moment\r\nthat he turned and sought the grass Jo spurred his steed. The Pacer\r\nheard the hoofs, then saw the running horse, and did not want a nearer\r\nview but led away. Across the flat he went down to the south, and kept\r\nthe famous swinging gait that made his start grow longer. Now through\r\nthe sandy dunes he went, and steadying to an even pace he gained\r\nconsiderably and Jo\'s too-laden horse plunged through the sand and\r\nsinking fetlock deep, he lost at every bound. Then came a level stretch\r\nwhere the runner seemed to gain, and then a long decline where Jo\'s\r\nhorse dared not run his best, so lost again at every step.\r\n\r\nBut on they went, and Jo spared neither spur nor quirt. A mile--a\r\nmile--and another mile, and the far-off rock at Arriba loomed up ahead.\r\n\r\nAnd there Jo knew fresh mounts were held, and on they dashed. But the\r\nnight-black mane out level on the breeze ahead was gaining more and\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nArriba Canon reached at last, the watcher stood aside, for it was not\r\nwished to turn the race, and the Stallion passed--dashed down, across\r\nand up the slope, with that unbroken pace, the only one he knew.\r\n\r\nAnd Jo came bounding on his foaming steed, and on the waiting mount,\r\nthen urged him down the slope and up upon the track, and on the upland\r\nonce more drove in the spurs, and raced and raced, and raced, but not a\r\nsingle inch he gained.\r\n\r\nGa-lump, ga-lump, ga-lump, with measured beat he went--an hour--an hour,\r\nand another hour--Arroyo Alamosa just ahead with fresh relays, and Jo\r\nyelled at his horse and pushed him on and on. Straight for the place the\r\nBlack One made, but on the last two miles some strange foreboding turned\r\nhim to the left, and Jo foresaw escape in this, and pushed his jaded\r\nmount at any cost to head him off, and hard as they had raced this was\r\nthe hardest race of all, with gasps for breath and leather squeaks at\r\nevery straining bound. Then cutting right across, Jo seemed to gain, and\r\ndrawing his gun he fired shot after shot to toss the dust, and so turned\r\nthe Stallion\'s head and forced him back to take the crossing to the\r\nright.\r\n\r\nDown they went. The Stallion crossed and Jo sprang to the ground. His\r\nhorse was done, for thirty miles had passed in the last stretch, and Jo\r\nhimself was worn out. His eyes were burnt with flying alkali dust. He\r\nwas half blind so he motioned to his \'pard\' to "go ahead and keep him\r\nstraight for Alamosa ford."\r\n\r\nOut shot the rider on a strong, fresh steed, and away they went--up and\r\ndown on the rolling plain--the Black Horse flecked with snowy foam.\r\nHis heaving ribs and noisy breath showed what he felt--but on and on he\r\nWent.\r\n\r\nAnd Tom on Ginger seemed to gain, then lose and lose, when in an hour\r\nthe long decline of Alamosa came.\r\n\r\nAnd there a freshly mounted lad took up the chase and turned it west,\r\nand on they went past towns of prairie dogs, through soapweed tracts and\r\ncactus brakes by scores, and pricked and wrenched rode on. With dust and\r\nsweat the Black was now a dappled brown, but still he stepped the same.\r\nYoung Carrington, who followed, bad hurt his steed by pushing at the\r\nvery start, and spurred and urged him now to cut across a gulch at which\r\nthe Pacer shied. Just one misstep and down they went.\r\n\r\nThe boy escaped, but the pony lies there yet, and the wild Black Horse\r\nkept on.\r\n\r\nThis was close to old Gallego\'s ranch where Jo himself had cut across\r\nrefreshed to push the chase. Within thirty minutes he was again\r\nscorching the Pacer\'s trail.\r\n\r\nFar in the west the Carlos Hills were seen, and there Jo knew fresh men\r\nand mounts were waiting, and that way the indomitable rider tried\r\nto turn, the race, but by a sudden whim, of the inner warning born\r\nperhaps--the Pacer turned. Sharp to the north he went, and Jo, the\r\nskilful wrangler, rode and rode and yelled and tossed the dust with\r\nshots, but down on a gulch the wild black meteor streamed and Jo\r\ncould only follow. Then came the hardest race of all; Jo, cruel to the\r\nMustang, was crueller to his mount and to himself. The sun was hot, the\r\nscorching plain was dim in shimmering heat, his eyes and lips were burnt\r\nwith sand and salt, and yet the chase sped on. The only chance to win\r\nwould be if he could drive the Mustang back to the Big Arroyo Crossing.\r\nNow almost for the first time he saw signs of weakening in the Black.\r\nHis mane and tail were not just quite so high, and his short half mile\r\nof start was down by more than half, but still he stayed ahead and paced\r\nand paced and paced.\r\n\r\nAn hour and another hour, and still they went the same. But they turned\r\nagain, and night was near when Big Arroyo ford was reached--fully twenty\r\nmiles. But Jo was game, he seized the waiting horse. The one he left\r\nwent gasping to the stream and gorged himself with water till he died.\r\n\r\nThen Jo held back in hopes the foaming Black would drink. But he was\r\nwise; he gulped a single gulp, splashed through the stream and then\r\npassed on with Jo at speed behind him. And when they last were seen the\r\nBlack was on ahead just out of reach and Jo\'s horse bounding on.\r\n\r\nIt was morning when Jo came to camp on foot. His tale was briefly\r\ntold:--eight horses dead--five men worn out--the matchless Pacer safe\r\nand free.\r\n\r\n"Tain\'t possible; it can\'t be done. Sorry I didn\'t bore his hellish\r\ncarcass through when I had the chance," said Jo, and gave it up.\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nOld Turkeytrack was cook on this trip. He had watched the chase with as\r\nmuch interest as anyone, and when it failed he grinned into the pot and\r\nsaid: "That mustang\'s mine unless I\'m a darned fool." Then falling back\r\non Scripture for a precedent, as was his habit, he still addressed the\r\npot:\r\n\r\n"Reckon the Philistines tried to run Samson down and they got done up,\r\nan\' would a stayed don ony for a nat\'ral weakness on his part. An\' Adam\r\nwould a loafed in Eden yit it ony for a leetle failing, which we all\r\nonder stand. An\' it aint $5,000 I\'ll take for him nuther."\r\n\r\nMuch persecution had made the Pacer wilder than ever. But it did not\r\ndrive him away from Antelope Springs. That was the only drinking-place\r\nwith absolutely no shelter for a mile on every side to hide an enemy.\r\nHere he came almost every day about noon, and after thoroughly spying\r\nthe land approached to drink.\r\n\r\nHis had been a lonely life all winter since the capture of his harem,\r\nand of this old Turkeytrack was fully aware. The old cook\'s chum had a\r\nnice little brown mare which he judged would serve his ends, and taking\r\na pair of the strongest hobbles, a spade, a spare lasso, and a stout\r\npost he mounted the mare and rode away to the famous Springs.\r\n\r\nA few antelope skimmed over the plain before him in the early freshness\r\nof the day. Cattle were lying about in groups, and the loud, sweet song\r\nof the prairie lark was\' heard on every side. For the bright snowless\r\nwinter of the mesas was gone and the springtime was at hand. The grass\r\nwas greening and all nature seemed turning to thoughts of love.\r\n\r\nIt was in the air, and when the little brown mare was picketed out to\r\ngraze she raised her nose from time to time to pour forth a long shrill\r\nwhinny that surely was her song, if song she had, of love.\r\n\r\nOld Turkeytrack studied the wind and the lay of the land. There was the\r\npit he had labored at, now opened and filled with water that was rank\r\nwith drowned prairie dogs and mice. Here was the new trail the animals\r\nwere forced to make by the pit. He selected a sedgy clump near some\r\nsmooth, grassy ground, and first firmly sunk the post, then dug a hole\r\nlarge enough to hide in, and spread his blanket in it. He shortened\r\nup the little mare\'s tether, till she could scarcely move; then on the\r\nground between he spread his open lasso, tying the long end to the\r\npost, then covered the rope with dust and grass, and went into his\r\nhiding-place.\r\n\r\nAbout noon, after long waiting, the amorous whinny of the mare was\r\nanswered from the high ground, away to the west, and there, black\r\nagainst the sky, was the famous Mustang.\r\n\r\nDown he came at that long swinging gait, but grown crafty with much\r\npursuit, he often stopped to gaze and whinny, and got answer that surely\r\ntouched his heart.\r\n\r\nNearer he came again to call, then took alarm, and paced all around in\r\na great circle to try the wind for his foes, and seemed in doubt. The\r\nAngel whispered "Don\'t go." But the brown mare called again. He circled\r\nnearer still, and neighed once more, and got reply that seemed to quell\r\nall fears, and set his heart aglow.\r\n\r\nNearer still he pranced, till he touched Solly\'s nose with his own,\r\nand finding her as responsive as he well could wish, thrust aside all\r\nthoughts of danger, and abandoned himself to the delight of conquest,\r\nuntil, as he pranced around, his hind legs for a moment stood within the\r\nevil circle of the rope. One deft sharp twitch, the noose flew tight,\r\nand he was caught.\r\n\r\nA snort of terror and a bound in the air gave Tom the chance to add the\r\ndouble hitch. The loop flashed up the line, and snake-like bound those\r\nmighty hoofs.\r\n\r\nTerror lent speed and double strength for a moment, but the end of the\r\nrope was reached, and down he went a captive, a hopeless prisoner\r\nat last. Old Tom\'s ugly, little crooked form sprang from the pit to\r\ncomplete the mastering of the great glorious creature whose mighty\r\nstrength had proved as nothing when matched with the wits of a little\r\nold man. With snorts and desperate bounds of awful force the great beast\r\ndashed and struggled to be free; but all in vain. The rope was strong.\r\n\r\nThe second lasso was deftly swung, and the forefeet caught, and then\r\nwith a skilful move the feet were drawn together, and down went the\r\nraging Pacer to lie a moment later \'hog-tied\' and helpless on the\r\nground. There he struggled till worn out, sobbing great convulsive sobs\r\nwhile tears ran down his cheeks.\r\n\r\nTom stood by and watched, but a strange revulsion of feeling came over\r\nthe old cow-puncher. He trembled nervously from head to foot, as he\r\nhad not done since he roped his first steer, and for a while could do\r\nnothing but gaze on his tremendous prisoner. But the feeling soon passed\r\naway. He saddled Delilah, and taking the second lasso, roped the great\r\nhorse about the neck, and left the mare to hold the Stallion\'s head,\r\nwhile he put on the hobbles. This was soon done, and sure of him now old\r\nBates was about to loose the ropes, but on a sudden thought he stopped.\r\nHe had quite forgotten, and had come unprepared for something of\r\nimportance. In Western law the Mustang was the property of the first\r\nman to mark him with his brand; how was this to be done with the nearest\r\nbranding-iron twenty miles away?\r\n\r\nOld Tom went to his mare, took up her hoofs one at a time, and examined\r\neach shoe. Yes! one was a little loose; he pushed and pried it with the\r\nspade, and got it off. Buffalo chips and kindred fuel were plentiful\r\nabout the plain, so a fire was quickly made, and he soon had one arm of\r\nthe horse-shoe red hot, then holding the other wrapped in his sock\r\nhe rudely sketched on the left shoulder of the helpless mustang a\r\nturkeytrack, his brand, the first time really that it had ever been\r\nused. The Pacer shuddered as the hot iron seared his flesh, but it was\r\nquickly done, and the famous Mustang Stallion was a maverick no more.\r\n\r\nNow all there was to do was to take him home. The ropes were loosed, the\r\nMustang felt himself freed, thought he was free, and sprang to his feet\r\nonly to fall as soon as he tried to take a stride. His forefeet were\r\nstrongly tied together, his only possible gait a shuffling walk, or else\r\na desperate labored bounding with feet so unnaturally held that within a\r\nfew yards he was inevitably thrown each time he tired to break away.\r\nTom on the light pony headed him off again and again, and by dint of\r\ndriving, threatening, and maneuvering, contrived to force his foaming,\r\ncrazy captive northward toward the Pinavetitos Canyon. But the wild horse\r\nwould not drive, would not give in. With snorts of terror or of rage and\r\nmaddest bounds, he tried and tried to get away. It was one long cruel\r\nfight; his glossy sides were thick with dark foam, and the foam was\r\nstained with blood. Countless hard falls and exhaustion that a long\r\nday\'s chase was powerless to produce were telling on him; his straining\r\nbounds first this way and then that, were not now quite so strong, and\r\nthe spray he snorted as he gasped was half a spray of blood. But his\r\ncaptor, relentless, masterful and cool, still forced him on. Down the\r\nslope toward the canyon they had come, every yard a fight, and now\r\nthey were at the head of the draw that took the trail down to the only\r\ncrossing of the canon, the northmost limit of the Pacer\'s ancient range.\r\n\r\nFrom this the first corral and ranch-house were in sight. The man\r\nrejoiced, but the Mustang gathered his remaining strength for one more\r\ndesperate dash. Up, up the grassy slope from the trail he went, defied\r\nthe swinging, slashing rope and the gunshot fired in air, in vain\r\nattempt to turn his frenzied course. Up, up and on, above the sheerest\r\ncliff he dashed then sprang away into the vacant air, down--down--two\r\nhundred downward feet to fall, and land upon the rocks below, a lifeless\r\nwreck--but free.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWULLY, The Story of a Yaller Dog\r\n\r\nWULLY WAS a little yaller dog. A yaller dog, be it understood, is not\r\nnecessarily the same as a yellow dog. He is not simply a canine whose\r\ncapillary covering is highly charged with yellow pigment. He is the\r\nmongrelest mixture of all mongrels, the least common multiple of all\r\ndogs, the breedless union of all breeds, and though of no breed at all,\r\nhe is yet of older, better breed than any of his aristocratic relations,\r\nfor he is nature\'s attempt to restore the ancestral jackal, the parent\r\nstock of all dogs.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the scientific name of the jackal (Canis aureus) means simply\r\n\'yellow dog,\' and not a few of that animal\'s characteristics are seen in\r\nhis domesticated representative. For the plebeian cur is shrewd, active,\r\nand hardy, and far better equipped for the real struggle of life than\r\nany of his \'thoroughbred\' kinsmen.\r\n\r\nIf we were to abandon a yaller dog, a greyhound, and a bulldog on a\r\ndesert island, which of them after six months would be alive and well?\r\nUnquestionably it would be the despised yellow cur. He has not the speed\r\nof the greyhound, but neither does he bear the seeds of lung and skin\r\ndiseases. He has not the strength or reckless courage of the bulldog,\r\nbut he has something a thousand times better, he has common sense.\r\nHealth and wit are no mean equipment for the life struggle, and when the\r\ndog-world is not \'managed\' by man, they have never yet failed to bring\r\nout the yellow mongrel as the sole and triumphant survivor.\r\n\r\nOnce in a while the reversion to the jackal type is more complete, and\r\nthe yaller dog has pricked and pointed ears. Beware of him then. He is\r\ncunning and plucky and can bite like a wolf. There is a strange, wild\r\nstreak in his nature too, that under cruelty or long adversity may\r\ndevelop into deadliest treachery in spite of the better traits that are\r\nthe foundation of man\'s love for the dog.\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nAway up in the Cheviots little Wully was born. He and one other of the\r\nlitter were kept; his brother because he resembled the best dog in the\r\nvicinity, and himself because he was a little yellow beauty.\r\n\r\nHis early life was that of a sheep-dog, in company with an experienced\r\ncollie who trained him, and an old shepherd who was scarcely inferior\r\nto them in intelligence. By the time he was two years old Wully was\r\nfull grown and had taken a thorough course in sheep. He knew them from\r\nram-horn to lamb-hoof, and old Robin, his master, at length had such\r\nconfidence in his sagacity that he would frequently stay at the tavern\r\nall night while Wully guarded the woolly idiots in the hills. His\r\neducation had been wisely bestowed and in most ways he was a very bright\r\nlittle dog with a future before him, Yet he never learned to despise\r\nthat addle-pated Robin. The old shepherd, with all his faults, his\r\ncontinual striving after his ideal state--intoxication--and his\r\nmind-shrivelling life in general was rarely brutal to Wully, and Wully\r\nrepaid him with an exaggerated worship that the greatest and wisest in\r\nthe land would have aspired to in vain.\r\n\r\nWully could not have imagined any greater being than Robin, and yet for\r\nthe sum of five shillings a week all Robin\'s vital energy and mental\r\nforce were pledged to the service of a not very great cattle and sheep\r\ndealer, the real proprietor of Wully\'s charge, and when this man, really\r\nless great than the neighboring laird, ordered Robin to drive his flock\r\nby stages to the Yorkshire moors and markets, of all the 376 mentalities\r\nconcerned, Wully\'s was the most interested and interesting.\r\n\r\nThe journey through Northumberland was uneventful. At the River Tyne\r\nthe sheep were driven on to the ferry and landed safely in smoky South\r\nShields. The great factory chimneys were just starting up for the day\r\nand belching out fogbanks and thunder-rollers of opaque leaden smoke\r\nthat darkened the air and hung low like a storm-cloud over the streets.\r\nThe sheep thought that they recognized the fuming dun of an unusually\r\nheavy Cheviot storm. They became alarmed, and in spite of their keepers\r\nstampeded through the town in 374 different directions.\r\n\r\nRobin was vexed to the inmost recesses of his tiny soul. He stared\r\nstupidly after the sheep for half a minute, then gave the order, "Wully,\r\nfetch them in." After this mental effort he sat down, lit his pipe, and\r\ntaking out his knitting began work on a half-finished sock.\r\n\r\nTo Wully the voice of Robin was the voice of God. Away he ran in 374\r\ndifferent directions, and headed off and rounded up the 374 different\r\nwanderers, and brought them back to the ferry-house before Robin, who\r\nwas stolidly watching the process, had toed off his sock.\r\n\r\nFinally Wully--not Robin--gave the sign that all were in. The old\r\nshepherd proceeded to count them--370, 371, 372, 373.\r\n\r\n"Wully," he said reproachfully, "thar no\' a\' here. Thur\'s anither." And\r\nWully, stung with shame, bounded off to scour the whole city for the\r\nmissing one. He was not long gone when a small boy pointed out to\r\nRobin that the sheep were all there, the whole 374. Now Robin was in a\r\nquandary. His order was to hasten on to Yorkshire, and yet he knew that\r\nWully\'s pride would prevent his coming back without another sheep, even\r\nif he had to steal it. Such things had happened before, and resulted in\r\nembarrassing complications. What should he do?\r\n\r\nThere was five shillings a week at stake. Wully was a good dog, it was\r\na pity to lose him, but then, his orders from the master; and again,\r\nif Wully stole an extra sheep to make up the number, then what--in a\r\nforeign land too? He decided to abandon Wully, and push on alone with\r\nthe sheep. And how he fared no one knows or cares.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Wully careered through miles of streets hunting in vain for\r\nhis lost sheep. All day he searched, and at night, famished and worn\r\nout, he sneaked shamefacedly back to the ferry, only to find that\r\nmaster and sheep had gone. His sorrow was pitiful to see. He ran about\r\nwhimpering, then took the ferryboat across to the other side, and\r\nsearched everywhere for Robin. He returned to South Shields and searched\r\nthere, and spent the rest of the night seeking for his wretched idol.\r\nThe next day he continued his search, he crossed and recrossed the\r\nriver many times. He watched and smelt everyone that came over, and with\r\nsignificant shrewdness he sought unceasingly in the neighboring taverns\r\nfor his master. The next day he set to work systematically to smell\r\neveryone that might cross the ferry.\r\n\r\nThe ferry makes fifty trips a day, with an average of one hundred\r\npersons a trip, yet never once did Wully fail to be on the gang-plank\r\nand smell every pair of legs that crossed--5,000 pairs, 10,000 legs that\r\nday did Wully examine after his own fashion. And the next day, and\r\nthe next, and all the week he kept his post, and seemed indifferent to\r\nfeeding himself. Soon starvation and worry began to tell on him. He\r\ngrew thin and ill-tempered. No one could touch him, and any attempt\r\nto interfere with his daily occupation of leg-smelling roused him to\r\ndesperation.\r\n\r\nDay after day, week after week Wully watched and waited for his master,\r\nwho never came. The ferry men learned to respect Wully\'s fidelity. At\r\nfirst he scorned their proffered food and shelter, and lived no one knew\r\nhow, but starved to it at last, he accepted the gifts and learned to\r\ntolerate the givers. Although embittered against the world, his heart\r\nwas true to his worthless master.\r\n\r\nFourteen months afterward I made his acquaintance. He was still on rigid\r\nduty at his post. He had regained his good looks. His bright, keen face\r\nset off by his white ruff and pricked ears made a dog to catch the eye\r\nanywhere. But he gave me no second glance, once he found my legs were\r\nnot those he sought, and in spite of my friendly overtures during the\r\nten months following that he continued his watch. I got no farther into\r\nhis confidence than any other stranger.\r\n\r\nFor two whole years did this devoted creature attend that ferry. There\r\nwas only one thing to prevent him going home to the hills, not the\r\ndistance nor the chance of getting lost, but the conviction that Robin,\r\nthe godlike Robin, wished him to stay by the ferry; and he stayed.\r\n\r\nBut he crossed the water as often as he felt it would serve his purpose.\r\nThe fare for a dog was one penny, and it was calculated that Wully owed\r\nthe company hundreds of pounds before he gave up his quest. He\r\nnever failed to sense every pair of nethers that crossed the\r\ngangplank--6,000,000 legs by computation had been pronounced upon by\r\nthis expert. But all to no purpose.\r\n\r\nHis unswerving fidelity never faltered, though his temper was obviously\r\nsouring under the long strain.\r\n\r\nWe had never heard what became of Robin, but one day a sturdy drover\r\nstrode down the ferry-slip and Wully mechanically assaying the new\r\npersonality, suddenly started, his mane bristled, he trembled, a low\r\ngrowl escaped him, and he fixed his every sense on the drover.\r\n\r\nOne of the ferry hands not understanding, called to the stranger, "Hoot\r\nmon, ye maunna hort oor dawg."\r\n\r\n"Whaes hortin \'im, ye fule; he is mair like to hort me." But further\r\nexplanation was not necessary. Wully\'s manner had wholly changed. He\r\nfawned on the drover, and his tail was wagging violently for the first\r\ntime in years. A few words made it all clear. Dorley, the drover, had\r\nknown Robin very well, and the mittens and comforter he wore were\r\nof Robin\'s own make and had once been part of his wardrobe. Wully\r\nrecognized the traces of his master, and despairing of any nearer\r\napproach to his lost idol, he abandoned his post at the ferry and\r\nplainly announced his intention of sticking to the owner of the mittens,\r\nand Dorley was well pleased to take Wully along to his home among the\r\nhills of Derbyshire, where he became once more a sheep-dog in charge of\r\na flock.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nMonsaldale is one of the best-known valleys in Derbyshire. The Pig\r\nand Whistle is its single but celebrated inn, and Jo Greatorex, the\r\nlandlord, is a shrewd and sturdy Yorkshireman. Nature meant him for a\r\nfrontiersman, but circumstances made him an innkeeper and his inborn\r\ntastes made him a--well, never mind; there was a great deal of poaching\r\ndone in that country.\r\n\r\nWully\'s new home was on the upland east of the valley above Jo\'s inn,\r\nand that fact was not without weight in bringing me to Monsaldale. His\r\nmaster, Dorley, farmed in a small way on the lowland, and on the moors\r\nhad a large number of sheep. These Wully guarded with his old-time\r\nsagacity, watching them while they fed and bringing them to the fold at\r\nnight. He was reserved and preoccupied for a dog, and rather too\r\nready to show his teeth to strangers, but he was so unremitting in\r\nhis attention to his flock that Dorley did not lose a lamb that year,\r\nalthough the neighboring farmers paid the usual tribute to eagles and to\r\nfoxes.\r\n\r\nThe dales are poor fox-hunting country at best. The rocky ridges, high\r\nstone walls, and precipices are too numerous to please the riders, and\r\nthe final retreats in the rocks are so plentiful that it was a marvel\r\nthe foxes did not overrun Monsaldale. But they didn\'t. There had been\r\nbut little reason for complaint until the year 1881, when a sly old fox\r\nquartered himself on the fat parish, like a mouse inside a cheese, and\r\nlaughed equally at the hounds of the huntsmen and the lurchers of the\r\nfarmers. He was several times run by the Peak hounds, and escaped by\r\nmaking for the Devil\'s Hole. Once in this gorge, where the cracks in the\r\nrocks extend unknown distances, he was safe. The country folk began to\r\nsee something more than chance in the fact that he always escaped at the\r\nDevil\'s Hole, and when one of the hounds who nearly caught this Devil\'s\r\nFox soon after went mad, it removed all doubt as to the spiritual\r\npaternity of said fox.\r\n\r\nHe continued his career of rapine, making audacious raids and\r\nhair-breadth escapes, and finally began, as do many old foxes, to kill\r\nfrom a mania for slaughter. Thus it was that Digby lost ten lambs in one\r\nnight. Carroll lost seven the next night. Later, the vicarage duck-pond\r\nwas wholly devastated, and scarcely a night passed but someone in the\r\nregion had to report a carnage of poultry, lambs or sheep, and, finally\r\neven calves.\r\n\r\nOf course all the slaughter was attributed to this one fox of the\r\nDevil\'s Hole. It was known only that he was a very large fox, at least\r\none that made a very large track. He never was clearly seen, even by the\r\nhuntsmen. And it was noticed that Thunder and Bell, the stanchest hounds\r\nin the pack, had refused to tongue or even to follow the trail when he\r\nwas hunted.\r\n\r\nHis reputation for madness sufficed to make the master of the Peak\r\nhounds avoid the neighborhood. The farmers in Monsaldale, led by Jo,\r\nagreed among themselves that if it would only come on a snow, they would\r\nassemble and beat the whole country, and in defiance of all rules of the\r\nhunt, get rid of the \'daft\' fox in any way they could. But the snow did\r\nnot come, and the red-haired gentleman lived his life. Notwithstanding\r\nhis madness, he did not lack method. He never came two successive nights\r\nto the same farm. He never ate where he killed, and he never left a\r\ntrack that betrayed his re-treat. He usually finished up his night\'s\r\ntrail on the turf, or on a public highway.\r\n\r\nOnce I saw him. I was walking to Monsaldale from Bakewell late one night\r\nduring a heavy storm, and as I turned the corner of Stead\'s sheep-fold\r\nthere was a vivid flash of lightning. By its light, there was fixed on\r\nmy retina a picture that made me start. Sitting on his haunches by the\r\nroadside, twenty yards away, was a very large fox gazing at me with\r\nmalignant eyes, and licking his muzzle in a suggestive manner. All\r\nthis I saw, but no more, and might have forgotten it, or thought myself\r\nmistaken, but the next morning, in that very fold, were found the bodies\r\nof twenty-three lambs and sheep, and the unmistakable signs that brought\r\nhome the crime to the well-known marauder.\r\n\r\nThere was only one man who escaped, and that was Dorley. This was the\r\nmore remarkable because he lived in the centre of the region raided, and\r\nwithin one mile of the Devil\'s Hole. Faithful Wully proved himself worth\r\nall the dogs in the neighborhood. Night after night he brought in the\r\nsheep, and never one was missing. The Mad Fox might prowl about the\r\nDorley homestead if he wished, but Wully, shrewd, brave, active Wully\r\nwas more than a match for him, and not only saved his master\'s flock,\r\nbut himself escaped with a whole skin. Everyone entertained a profound\r\nrespect for him, and he might have been a popular pet but for his temper\r\nwhich, never genial, became more and more crabbed. He seemed to like\r\nDorley, and Huldah, Dorley\'s eldest daughter, a shrewd, handsome, young\r\nwoman, who, in the capacity of general manager of the house, was Wully\'s\r\nspecial guardian. The other members of Dorley\'s family Wully learned to\r\ntolerate, but the rest of the world, men and dogs, he seemed to hate.\r\n\r\nHis uncanny disposition was well shown in the last meeting I had with\r\nhim. I was walking on a pathway across the moor behind Dorley\'s house.\r\nWully was lying on the doorstep. As I drew near he arose, and without\r\nappearing to see me trotted toward my pathway and placed himself across\r\nit about ten yards ahead of me. There he stood silently and intently\r\nregarding the distant moor, his slightly bristling mane the only sign\r\nthat he had not been suddenly turned to stone. He did not stir as I\r\ncame up, and not wishing to quarrel, I stepped around past his nose and\r\nwalked on. Wully at once left his position and in the same eerie silence\r\ntrotted on some twenty feet and again stood across the pathway. Once\r\nmore I came up and, stepping into the grass, brushed past his nose.\r\nInstantly, but without a sound, he seized my left heel. I kicked out\r\nwith the other foot, but he escaped. Not having a stick, I flung a large\r\nstone at him. He leaped forward and the stone struck him in the ham,\r\nbowling him over into a ditch. He gasped out a savage growl as he fell,\r\nbut scrambled out of the ditch and limped away in silence.\r\n\r\nYet sullen and ferocious as Wully was to the world, he was always gentle\r\nwith Dorley\'s sheep. Many were the tales of rescues told of him. Many\r\na poor lamb that had fallen into a pond or hole would have perished but\r\nfor his timely and sagacious aid, many a far-weltered ewe did he turn\r\nright side up; while his keen eye discerned and his fierce courage\r\nbaffled every eagle that had appeared on the moor in his time.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nThe Monsaldale farmers were still paying their nightly tribute to the\r\nMad Fox, when the snow came, late in December. Poor Widow Cot lost her\r\nentire flock of twenty sheep, and the fiery cross went forth early in\r\nthe morning. With guns unconcealed the burly farmers set out to follow\r\nto the finish the tell-tale tracks in the snow, those of a very large\r\nfox, undoubtedly the multo-murderous villain. For a while the trail was\r\nclear enough, then it came to the river and the habitual cunning of the\r\nanimal was shown. He reached the water at a long angle pointing down\r\nstream and jumped into the shallow, unfrozen current. But at the\r\nother side there was no track leading out, and it was only after long\r\nsearching that, a quarter of a mile higher up the stream, they found\r\nwhere he had come out. The track then ran to the top of Henley\'s high\r\nstone wall, where there was no snow left to tell tales. But the patient\r\nhunters persevered. When it crossed the smooth snow from the wall to the\r\nhigh road there was a difference of opinion. Some claimed that the track\r\nwent up, others down the road. But Jo settled it, and after another long\r\nsearch they found where apparently the same trail, though some said a\r\nlarger one, had left the road to enter a sheep-fold, and leaving this\r\nwithout harming the occupants, the track-maker had stepped in the\r\nfootmarks of a countryman, thereby getting to the moor road, along which\r\nhe had trotted straight to Dorley\'s farm.\r\n\r\nThat day the sheep were kept in on account of the snow and Wully,\r\nwithout his usual occupation, was lying on some planks in the sun. As\r\nthe hunters drew near the house, he growled savagely and sneaked around\r\nto where the sheep were. Jo Greatorex walked up to where Wully had\r\ncrossed the fresh snow, gave a glance, looked dumbfounded, then pointing\r\nto the retreating sheep-dog, he said, with emphasis:\r\n\r\n"Lads, we\'re off the track of the Fox. But there\'s the killer of the\r\nWidder\'s yowes."\r\n\r\nSome agreed with Jo, others recalled the doubt in the trail and were for\r\ngoing back to make a fresh follow. At this juncture, Dorley himself came\r\nout of the house.\r\n\r\n"Tom," said Jo, "that dog o\' thine \'as killed twenty of Widder Gelt\'s\r\nsheep, last night. An\' ah fur one don\'t believe as its \'is first\r\nkillin\'."\r\n\r\n"Why, mon, thou art crazy," said Tom. "Ah never \'ad a better\r\nsheep-dog--\'e fair loves the sheep."\r\n\r\n"Aye! We\'s seen summat o\' that in las\' night\'s work," replied Jo.\r\n\r\nIn vain the company related the history of the morning. Tom swore that\r\nit was nothing but a jealous conspiracy to rob him of Wully.\r\n\r\n"Wully sleeps i\' the kitchen every night. Never is oot till he\'s let\r\nto bide wi\' the yowes. Why, mon, he\'s wi\' oor sheep the year round, and\r\nnever a hoof have ah lost."\r\n\r\nTom became much excited over this abominable attempt against Wully\'s\r\nreputation and life. Jo and his partisans got equally angry, and it was\r\na wise suggestion of Huldah\'s that quieted them.\r\n\r\n"Feyther," said she, "ah\'ll sleep i\' the kitchen the night. If Wully\r\n\'as ae way of gettin\' oot ah\'ll see it, an\' if he\'s no oot an\' sheep\'s\r\nkilled on the country-side, we\'ll ha\' proof it\'s na Wully."\r\n\r\nThat night Huldah stretched herself on the settee and Wully slept as\r\nusual underneath the table. As night wore on the dog became restless. He\r\nturned on his bed and once or twice got up, stretched, looked at Huldah\r\nand lay down again. About two o\'clock he seemed no longer able to resist\r\nsome strange impulse. He arose quietly, looked toward the low window,\r\nthen at the motionless girl. Huldah lay still and breathed as though\r\nsleeping. Wully slowly came near and sniffed and breathed his doggy\r\nbreath in her face. She made no move. He nudged her gently with his\r\nnose. Then, with his sharp ears forward and his head on one side he\r\nstudied her calm face. Still no sign. He walked quietly to the window,\r\nmounted the table without noise, placed his nose under the sash-bar\r\nand raised the light frame until he could put one paw underneath. Then\r\nchanging, he put his nose under the sash and raised it high enough to\r\nslip out, easing down the frame finally on his rump and tail with an\r\nadroitness that told of long practice. Then he disappeared into the\r\ndarkness.\r\n\r\nFrom her couch Huldah watched in amazement. After waiting for some time\r\nto make sure that he was gone, she arose, intending to call her father\r\nat once, but on second thought she decided to await more conclusive\r\nproof. She peered into the darkness, but no sign of Wully was to be\r\nseen. She put more wood on the fire, and lay down again. For over an\r\nhour she lay wide awake listening to the kitchen clock, and starting at\r\neach trifling sound, and wondering what the dog was doing. Could it\r\nbe possible that he had really killed the widow\'s sheep? Then the\r\nrecollection of his gentleness to their own sheep came, and completed\r\nher perplexity.\r\n\r\nAnother hour slowly tick-tocked. She heard a slight sound at the window\r\nthat made her heart jump. The scratching sound was soon followed by the\r\nlifting of the sash, and in a short time Wully was back in the kitchen\r\nwith the window closed behind him.\r\n\r\nBy the flickering fire-light Huldah could see a strange, wild gleam in\r\nhis eye, and his jaws and snowy breast were dashed with fresh blood. The\r\ndog ceased his slight panting as he scrutinized the girl. Then, as\r\nshe did not move, he lay down, and began to lick his paws and muzzle,\r\ngrowling lowly once or twice as though at the remembrance of some recent\r\noccurrence.\r\n\r\nHuldah had seen enough. There could no longer be any doubt that Jo was\r\nright and more--a new thought flashed into her quick brain, she realized\r\nthat the weird fox of Monsal was before her. Raising herself, she looked\r\nstraight at Wully, and exclaimed:\r\n\r\n"Wully! Wully! so it\'s a\' true--oh, Wully, ye terrible brute."\r\n\r\nHer voice was fiercely reproachful, it rang in the quiet kitchen, and\r\nWully recoiled as though shot. He gave a desperate glance toward the\r\nclosed window. His eye gleamed, and his mane bristled. But he cowered\r\nunder her gaze, and grovelled on the floor as though begging for mercy.\r\nSlowly he crawled nearer and nearer, as if to lick her feet, until quite\r\nclose, then, with the fury of a tiger, but without a sound, he sprang\r\nfor her throat.\r\n\r\nThe girl was taken unawares, but she threw up her arm in time, and\r\nWully\'s long, gleaming tusks sank into her flesh, and grated on the\r\nbone.\r\n\r\n"Help! help! feyther! feyther!" she shrieked.\r\n\r\nWully was a light weight, and for a moment she flung him off. But there\r\ncould be no mistaking his purpose. The game was up, it was his life or\r\nhers now.\r\n\r\n"Feyther! feyther!" she screamed, as the yellow fury, striving to kill\r\nher, bit and tore the unprotected hands that had so often fed him.\r\n\r\nIn vain she fought to hold him off, he would soon have had her by the\r\nthroat, when in rushed Dorley.\r\n\r\nStraight at him, now in the same horrid silence sprang Wully, and\r\nsavagely tore him again and again before a deadly blow from the\r\nfagot-hook disabled him, dashing him, gasping and writhing, on the\r\nstone floor, desperate, and done for, but game and defiant to the last.\r\nAnother quick blow scattered his brains on the hearthstone, where so\r\nlong he had been a faithful and honored retainer--and Wully, bright,\r\nfierce, trusty, treacherous Wully, quivered a moment, then straightened\r\nout, and lay forever still.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREDRUFF, The Story of the Don Valley Partridge\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nDOWN THE wooded slope of Taylor\'s Hill the Mother Partridge led her\r\nbrood; down toward the crystal brook that by some strange whim was\r\ncalled Mud Creek. Her little ones were one day old but already quick on\r\nfoot, and she was taking them for the first time to drink.\r\n\r\nShe walked slowly, crouching low as she went, for the woods were full of\r\nenemies. She was uttering a soft little cluck in her throat, a call\r\nto the little balls of mottled down that on their tiny pink legs came\r\ntoddling after, and peeping softly and plaintively if left even a few\r\ninches behind, and seeming so fragile they made the very chickadees look\r\nbig and coarse. There were twelve of them, but Mother Grouse watched\r\nthem all, and she watched every bush and tree and thicket, and the whole\r\nwoods and the sky itself. Always for enemies she seemed seeking--friends\r\nwere too scarce to be looked for--and an enemy she found. Away across\r\nthe level beaver meadow was a great brute of a fox. He was coming their\r\nway, and in a few moments would surely wind them or strike their trail.\r\nThere was no time to lose.\r\n\r\n\'Krrr! Krrr!\' (Hide!! Hide!) cried the mother in a low firm voice, and\r\nthe little bits of things, scarcely bigger than acorns and but a day\r\nold, scattered far (a few inches) apart to hide. One dived under a leaf,\r\nanother between two roots, a third crawled into a curl of birchbark, a\r\nfourth into a hole, and so on, till all were hidden but one who could\r\nfind no cover, so squatted on a broad yellow chip and lay very flat, and\r\nclosed his eyes very tight, sure that now he was safe from being seen.\r\nThey ceased their frightened peeping and all was still.\r\n\r\nMother Partridge flew straight toward the dreaded beast, alighted\r\nfearlessly a few yards to one side of him, and then flung herself on the\r\nground, flopping as though winged and lame--oh, so dreadfully lame--and\r\nwhining like a distressed puppy. Was she begging for mercy--mercy from\r\na bloodthirsty, cruel fox? Oh, dear no! She was no fool. One often hears\r\nof the cunning of the fox. Wait and see what a fool he is compared with\r\na mother-partridge. Elated at the prize so suddenly within his reach,\r\nthe fox turned with a dash and caught--at least, no, he didn\'t quite\r\ncatch the bird; she flopped by chance just a foot out of reach. He\r\nfollowed with another jump and would have seized her this time surely,\r\nbut somehow a sapling came just between, and the partridge dragged\r\nherself awkwardly away and under a log, but the great brute snapped his\r\njaws and hounded over the log, while she, seeming a trifle less lame,\r\nmade another clumsy forward spring and tumbled down a bank, and Reynard,\r\nkeenly following, almost caught her tail, but, oddly enough, fast as\r\nhe went and leaped, she still seemed just a trifle faster. It was most\r\nextraordinary. A winged partridge and he, Reynard, the Swift-foot, had\r\nnot caught her in five minutes\' racing. It was really shameful. But the\r\npartridge seemed to gain strength as the fox put forth his, and after a\r\nquarter of a mile race, racing that was somehow all away from Taylor\'s\r\nHill, the bird got unaccountably quite well, and, rising with a derisive\r\nwhirr, flew off through the woods leaving the fox utterly dumfounded\r\nto realize that he had been made a fool of, and, worst of all, he now\r\nremembered that this was not the first time he had been served this very\r\ntrick, though he never knew the reason for it.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mother Partridge skimmed in a great circle and came by a\r\nroundabout way back to the little fuzz-balls she had left hidden in the\r\nwoods.\r\n\r\nWith a wild bird\'s keen memory for places, she went to the very\r\ngrass-blade she last trod on, and stood for a moment fondly to admire\r\nthe perfect stillness of her children. Even at her step not one had\r\nstirred, and the little fellow on the chip, not so very badly concealed\r\nafter all, had not budged, nor did he now; he only closed his eyes a\r\ntiny little bit harder, till the mother said:\r\n\r\n\'K-reet!\' (Come, children) and instantly like a fairy story, every hole\r\ngave up its little baby-partridge, and the wee fellow on the chip, the\r\nbiggest of them all really, opened his big-little eyes and ran to the\r\nshelter of her broad tail, with a sweet little \'peep peep\' which an\r\nenemy could not have heard three feet away, but which his mother could\r\nnot have missed thrice as far, and all the other thimblefuls of down\r\njoined in, and no doubt thought themselves dreadfully noisy, and were\r\nproportionately happy.\r\n\r\nThe sun was hot now. There was an open space to cross on the road to the\r\nwater, and, after a careful lookout for enemies, the mother gathered the\r\nlittle things under the shadow of her spread fantail and kept off all\r\ndanger of sunstroke until they reached the brier thicket by the stream.\r\n\r\nHere a cottontail rabbit leaped out and gave them a great scare. But the\r\nflag of truce he carried behind was enough. He was an old friend; and\r\namong other things the little ones learned that day that Bunny always\r\nsails under a flag of truce, and lives up to it too.\r\n\r\nAnd then came the drink, the purest of living water, though silly men\r\nhad called it Mud Creek.\r\n\r\nAt first the little fellows didn\'t know how to drink, but they copied\r\ntheir mother, and soon learned to drink like her and give thanks after\r\nevery sip. There they stood in a row along the edge, twelve little brown\r\nand golden balls on twenty-four little pink-toed, in-turned feet, with\r\ntwelve sweet little golden heads gravely bowing, drinking and giving\r\nthanks like their mother.\r\n\r\nThen she led them by short stages, keeping the cover, to the far side of\r\nthe beaver-meadow, where was a great grassy dome. The mother had made a\r\nnote of this dome some time before. It takes a number of such domes to\r\nraise a brood of partridges. For this was an ant\'s nest. The old one\r\nstepped on top, looked about a moment, then gave half a dozen vigorous\r\nrakes with her claws, The friable ant-hill was broken open, and the\r\nearthen galleries scattered in ruins down the slope. The ants swarmed\r\nout and quarreled with each other for lack of a better plan. Some ran\r\naround the hill with vast energy and little purpose, while a few of the\r\nmore sensible began to carry away fat white eggs. But the old partridge,\r\ncoming to the little ones, picked up one of these juicy-looking bags and\r\nclucked and dropped it, and picked it up again and again and clucked,\r\nthen swallowed it. The young ones stood around, then one little yellow\r\nfellow, the one that sat on the chip, picked up an ant-egg, dropped it\r\na few times, then yielding to a sudden impulse, swallowed it, and so had\r\nlearned to eat. Within twenty minutes even the runt had learned, and a\r\nmerry time they had scrambling after the delicious eggs as their mother\r\nbroke open more ant-galleries, and sent them and their contents rolling\r\ndown the bank, till every little partridge had so crammed his little\r\ncrop that he was positively misshapen and could eat no more.\r\n\r\nThen all went cautiously up the stream, and on a sandy bank, well\r\nscreened by brambles, they lay for all that afternoon, and learned how\r\npleasant it was to feel the cool powdery dust running between their hot\r\nlittle toes. With their strong bent for copying, they lay on their sides\r\nlike their mother and scratched with their tiny feet and flopped with\r\ntheir wings, though they had no wings to flop with, only a little tag\r\namong the down on each side, to show where the wings would come. That\r\nnight she took them to a dry thicket near by, and there among the crisp,\r\ndead leaves that would prevent an enemy\'s silent approach on foot, and\r\nunder the interlacing briers that kept off all foes of the air, she\r\ncradled them in their feather-shingled nursery and rejoiced in the\r\nfulness of a mother\'s joy over the wee cuddling things that peeped in\r\ntheir sleep and snuggled so trustfully against her warm body.\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe third day the chicks were much stronger on their feet. They\r\nno longer had to go around an acorn; they could even scramble over\r\npine-cones, and on the little tags that marked the places for their\r\nwings, were now to be seen blue rows of fat blood-quills.\r\n\r\nTheir start in life was a good mother, good legs, a few reliable\r\ninstincts, and a germ of reason. It was instinct, that is, inherited\r\nhabit, which taught them to hide at the word from their mother; it was\r\ninstinct that taught them to follow her, but it was reason which made\r\nthem keep under the shadow of her tail when the sun was smiting down,\r\nand from that day reason entered more and more into their expanding\r\nlives.\r\n\r\nNext day the blood-quills had sprouted the tips of feathers. On the\r\nnext, the feathers were well out, and a week later the whole family of\r\ndown-clad babies were strong on the wing.\r\n\r\nAnd yet not all--poor little Runtie had been sickly from the first. He\r\nbore his half-shell on his back for hours after he came out; he ran less\r\nand cheeped more than his brothers, and when one evening at the onset\r\nof a skunk the mother gave the word \'Kwit, kwit\' (Fly, fly), Runtie was\r\nleft behind, and when she gathered her brood on the piney hill he was\r\nmissing, and they saw him no more.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, their training had gone on. They knew that the finest\r\ngrasshoppers abounded in the long grass by the brook; they knew that the\r\ncurrant-bushes dropped fatness in the form of smooth, green worms; they\r\nknew that the dome of an ant-hill rising against the distant woods stood\r\nfor a garner of plenty; they knew that strawberries, though not really\r\ninsects, were almost as delicious; they knew that the huge danaid\r\nbutterflies were good, safe game, if they could only catch them, and\r\nthat a slab of bark dropping from the side of a rotten log was sure to\r\nabound in good things of many different kinds; and they had learned,\r\nalso, that yellow-jackets, mud-wasps, woolly worms, and hundred-leggers\r\nwere better let alone.\r\n\r\nIt was now July, the Moon of Berries. The chicks had grown and\r\nflourished amazingly during this last month, and were now so large that\r\nin her efforts to cover them the mother was kept standing all night.\r\n\r\nThey took their daily dust-bath, but of late had changed to another\r\nhigher on the hill. It was one in use by many different birds, and at\r\nfirst the mother disliked the idea of such a second-hand bath. But the\r\ndust was of such a fine, agreeable quality, and the children led the way\r\nwith such enthusiasm, that she forgot her mistrust.\r\n\r\nAfter a fortnight the little ones began to droop and she herself did not\r\nfeel very well. They were always hungry, and though they ate enormously,\r\nthey one and all grew thinner and thinner. The mother was the last to be\r\naffected. But when it came, it came as hard on her--a ravenous hunger, a\r\nfeverish headache, and a wasting weakness. She never knew the cause. She\r\ncould not know that the dust of the much-used dust-bath, that her true\r\ninstinct taught her to mistrust at first, and now again to shun, was\r\nsown with parasitic worms, and that all of the family were infested.\r\n\r\nNo natural impulse is without a purpose. The mother-bird\'s knowledge of\r\nhealing was only to follow natural impulse. The eager, feverish craving\r\nfor something, she knew not what, led her to eat, or try, everything\r\nthat looked eatable and to seek the coolest woods. And there she found a\r\ndeadly sumac laden with its poison fruit.\r\n\r\nA month ago she would have passed it by, but now she tried the\r\nunattractive berries. The acrid burning juice seemed to answer some\r\nstrange demand of her body; she ate and ate, and all her family joined\r\nin the strange feast of physic. No human doctor could have hit it\r\nbetter; it proved a biting, drastic purge, the dreadful secret foe was\r\ndowned, the danger passed. But not for all--Nature, the old nurse, had\r\ncome too late for two of them. The weakest, by inexorable law, dropped\r\nout. Enfeebled by the disease, the remedy was too severe for them. They\r\ndrank and drank by the stream, and next morning did not move when the\r\nothers followed the mother. Strange vengeance was theirs now, for\r\na skunk, the same that could have told where Runtie went, found and\r\ndevoured their bodies and died of the poison they had eaten.\r\n\r\nSeven little partridges now obeyed the mother\'s call. Their individual\r\ncharacters were early shown and now developed fast. The weaklings were\r\ngone, but there were still a fool and a lazy one. The mother could not\r\nhelp caring for some more than for others, and her favorite was the\r\nbiggest, he who once sat on the yellow chip for concealment. He was not\r\nonly the biggest, strongest, and handsomest of the brood, but best of\r\nall, the most obedient. His mother\'s warning \'rrrrr\' (danger) did\r\nnot always keep the others from a risky path or a doubtful food, but\r\nobedience seemed natural to him, and he never failed to respond to her\r\nsoft \'K-reet\' (Come), and of this obedience he reaped the reward, for\r\nhis days were longest in the land.\r\n\r\nAugust, the Molting Moon, went by; the young ones were now three parts\r\ngrown. They knew just enough to think themselves wonderfully wise. When\r\nthey were small it was necessary to sleep on the ground so their mother\r\ncould shelter them, but now they were too big to need that, and the\r\nmother began to introduce grownup ways of life. It was time to roost in\r\nthe trees. The young weasels, foxes, skunks, and minks were beginning\r\nto run. The ground grew more dangerous each night, so at sundown Mother\r\nPartridge called \'K-reet,\' and flew into a thick, low tree.\r\n\r\nThe little ones followed, except one, an obstinate little fool who\r\npersisted in sleeping on the ground as heretofore. It was all right that\r\ntime, but the next night his brothers were awakened by his cries. There\r\nwas a slight scuffle, then stillness, broken only by a horrid sound\r\nof crunching bones and a smacking of lips. They peered down into the\r\nterrible darkness below, where the glint of two close-set eyes and a\r\npeculiar musty smell told them that a mink was the killer of their fool\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\nSix little partridges now sat in a row at night, with their mother in\r\nthe middle, though it was not unusual for some little one with cold feet\r\nto perch on her back.\r\n\r\nTheir education went on, and about this time they were taught\r\n\'whirring.\' A partridge can rise on the wing silently if it wishes, but\r\nwhirring is so important at times that all are taught how and when to\r\nrise on thundering wings. Many ends are gained by the whirr. It warns\r\nall other partridges near that danger is at hand, it unnerves the\r\ngunner, or it fixes the foe\'s attention on the whirrer, while the others\r\nsneak off in silence, or by squatting, escape notice.\r\n\r\nA partridge adage might well be \'foes and food for every moon.\'\r\nSeptember came, with seeds and grain in place of berries and ant-eggs,\r\nand gunners in place of skunks and minks.\r\n\r\nThe partridges knew well what a fox was, but had scarcely seen a dog. A\r\nfox they knew they could easily baffle by taking to a tree, but when\r\nin the Gunner Moon old Cuddy came prowling through the ravine with his\r\nbob-tailed yellow cur, the mother spied the dog and cried out, \'Kwit!\r\nkwit!\' (Fly, fly). Two of the brood thought it a pity their mother\r\nshould lose her wits so easily over a fox, and were pleased to show\r\ntheir superior nerve by springing into a tree in spite of her earnestly\r\nrepeated \'Kwit! kwit!\' and her example of speeding away on silent wings.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the strange bob-tailed fox came under the tree and yapped\r\nand yapped at them. They were much amused at him and at their mother and\r\nbrothers, so much that they never noticed a rustling in the bushes\r\ntill there was a loud Bang! bang! and down fell two bloody, flopping\r\npartridges, to be seized and mangled by the yellow cur until the gunner\r\nran from the bushes and rescued the remains.\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nCuddy lived in a wretched shanty near the Don, north of Toronto. His was\r\nwhat Greek philosophy would have demonstrated to be an ideal existence.\r\nHe had no wealth, no taxes, no social pretensions, and no property to\r\nspeak of. His life was made up of a very little work and a great deal\r\nof play, with as much outdoor life as he chose. He considered himself\r\na true sportsman because he was \'fond o\' huntin\',\' and \'took a sight o\'\r\ncomfort out of seein\' the critters hit the mud, when his gun was fired.\r\nThe neighbors called him a squatter, and looked on him merely as an\r\nanchored tramp. He shot and trapped the year round, and varied his game\r\nsomewhat with the season perforce, but had been heard to remark he could\r\ntell the month by the \'taste o\' the partridges,\' if he didn\'t happen to\r\nknow by the almanac. This, no doubt, showed keen observation, but was\r\nalso unfortunate proof of something not so creditable. The lawful season\r\nfor murdering partridges began September 15th, but there was nothing\r\nsurprising in Cuddy\'s being out a fortnight ahead of time. Yet he\r\nmanaged to escape punishment year after year, and even contrived to pose\r\nin a newspaper interview as an interesting character.\r\n\r\nHe rarely shot on the wing, preferring to pot his birds, which was not\r\neasy to do when the leaves were on, and accounted for the brood in the\r\nthird ravine going so long unharmed; but the near prospect of other\r\ngunners finding them now, had stirred him to go after \'a mess o\' birds.\'\r\nHe had heard no roar of wings when the mother-bird led off her four\r\nsurvivors, so pocketed the two he had killed and returned to the shanty.\r\n\r\nThe little grouse thus learned that a dog is not a fox, and must\r\nbe differently played; and an old lesson was yet more deeply\r\ngraven--\'Obedience is long life.\'\r\n\r\nThe rest of September was passed in keeping quietly out of the way of\r\ngunners as well as some old enemies. They still roosted on the long\r\nthin branches of the hardwood trees among the thickest leaves, which\r\nprotected them from foes in the air; the height saved them from foes on\r\nthe ground, and left them nothing to fear but coons, whose slow, heavy\r\ntread on the timber boughs never failed to give them timely warning. But\r\nthe leaves were falling now--every month its foes and its food. This\r\nwas nut time, and it was owl time, too. Barred owls coming down from\r\nthe north doubled or trebled the owl population. The nights were getting\r\nfrosty and the coons less dangerous, so the mother changed the place of\r\nroosting to the thickest foliage of a hemlock-tree.\r\n\r\nOnly one of the brood disregarded the warning \'Kreet, kreet.\' He stuck\r\nto his swinging elm-bough, now nearly naked, and a great yellow-eyed owl\r\nbore him off before morning.\r\n\r\nMother and three young ones now were left, but they were as big as she\r\nwas; indeed one, the eldest, he of the chip, was bigger. Their ruffs\r\nhad begun to show. Just the tips, to tell what they would be like when\r\ngrown, and not a little proud they were of them.\r\n\r\nThe ruff is to the partridge what the train is to the peacock--his chief\r\nbeauty and his pride. A hen\'s ruff is black with a slight green gloss.\r\nA cock\'s is much larger and blacker and is glossed with more vivid\r\nbottle-green. Once in a while a partridge is born of unusual size\r\nand vigor, whose ruff is not only larger, but by a peculiar kind of\r\nintensification is of a deep coppery red, iridescent with violet, green,\r\nand gold. Such a bird is sure to be a wonder to all who know him, and\r\nthe little one who had squatted on the chip, and had always done what\r\nhe was told, developed before the Acorn Moon had changed, into all\r\nthe glory of a gold and copper ruff--for this was Redruff, the famous\r\npartridge of the Don Valley.\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nOne day late in the Acorn Moon, that is, about mid-October, as the\r\ngrouse family were basking with full crops near a great pine log on the\r\nsunlit edge of the beaver-meadow, they heard the far-away bang of a\r\ngun, and Redruff, acting on some impulse from within, leaped on the log,\r\nstrutted up and down a couple of times, then, yielding to the elation of\r\nthe bright, clear, bracing air, he whirred his wings in loud defiance.\r\nThen, giving fuller vent to this expression of vigor, just as a colt\r\nfrisks to show how well he feels, he whirred yet more loudly, until,\r\nunwittingly, he found himself drumming, and tickled with the discovery\r\nof his new power, thumped the air again and again till he filled the\r\nnear woods with the loud tattoo of the fully grown cock-partridge. His\r\nbrother and sister heard and looked on with admiration and surprise, so\r\ndid his mother, but from that time she began to be a little afraid of\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nIn early November comes the moon of a weird foe. By a strange law of\r\nnature, not wholly without parallel among mankind, all partridges go\r\ncrazy in the November moon of their first year. They become possessed of\r\na mad hankering to get away somewhere, it does not matter much where.\r\nAnd the wisest of them do all sorts of foolish things at this period.\r\nThey go drifting, perhaps, at speed over the country by night and are\r\ncut in two by wires, or dash into lighthouses, or locomotive headlights.\r\nDaylight finds them in all sorts of absurd places, in buildings, in open\r\nmarshes, perched on telephone wires in a great city, or even on board\r\nof coasting vessels. The craze seems to be a relic of a bygone habit\r\nof migration, and it has at least one good effect, it breaks up the\r\nfamilies and prevents the constant intermarrying, which would surely be\r\nfatal to their race. It always takes the young badly their first year,\r\nand they may have it again the second fall, for it is very catching; but\r\nin the third season it is practically unknown.\r\n\r\nRedruff\'s mother knew it was coming as soon as she saw the frost grapes\r\nblackening, and the maples shedding their crimson and gold. There was\r\nnothing to do but care for their health and keep them in the quietest\r\npart of the woods.\r\n\r\nThe first sign of it came when a flock of wild geese went honking\r\nsouthward overhead. The young ones had never before seen such\r\nlong-necked hawks, and were afraid of them. But seeing that their mother\r\nhad no fear, they took courage, and watched them with intense interest.\r\nWas it the wild, clanging cry that moved them, or was it solely the\r\ninner prompting then come to the surface? A strange longing to follow\r\ntook possession of each of the young ones. They watched those arrowy\r\ntrumpeters fading away to the south, and sought out higher perches to\r\nwatch them farther yet, and from that time things were no more the same.\r\nThe November Moon was waxing, and when it was full, the November madness\r\ncame.\r\n\r\nThe least vigorous of the flock were most affected. The little family\r\nwas scattered. Redruff himself flew on several long erratic night\r\njourneys. The impulse took him southward, but there lay the boundless\r\nstretch of Lake Ontario, so he turned again, and the waning of the Mad\r\nMoon found him once more in the Mud Creek Glen, but absolutely alone.\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nFood grew scarce as winter wore on. Redruff clung to the old ravine and\r\nthe piney sides of Taylor\'s Hill, but every month brought its food and\r\nits foes. The Mad Moon brought madness, solitude, and grapes; the Snow\r\nMoon came with rosehips; and the Stormy Moon brought browse of birch and\r\nsilver storms that sheathed the woods in ice, and made it hard to keep\r\none\'s perch while pulling off the frozen buds. Redruff\'s beak grew\r\nterribly worn with the work, so that even when closed there was still\r\nan opening through behind the hook. But nature had prepared him for the\r\nslippery footing; his toes, so slim and trim in September, had sprouted\r\nrows of sharp, horny points, and these grew with the growing cold,\r\ntill the first snow had found him fully equipped with snow-shoes and\r\nicecreepers. The cold weather had driven away most of the hawks and\r\nowls, and made it impossible for his four-footed enemies to approach\r\nunseen, so that things were nearly balanced.\r\n\r\nHis flight in search of food had daily led him farther on, till he\r\nhad discovered and explored the Rosedale Creek, with its banks of\r\nsilver-birch, and Castle Frank, with its grapes and rowan berries, as\r\nwell as Chester woods, where amelanchier and Virginia-creeper swung\r\ntheir fruit-bunches, and checkerberries glowed beneath the snow.\r\n\r\nHe soon found out that for some strange reason men with guns did not go\r\nwithin the high fence of Castle Frank. So among these scenes he lived\r\nhis life, learning new places, new foods, and grew wiser and more\r\nbeautiful every day.\r\n\r\nHe was quite alone so far as kindred were concerned, but that scarcely\r\nseemed a hardship. Wherever he went he could see the jolly chickadees\r\nscrambling merrily about, and he remembered the time when they had\r\nseemed such big, important creatures. They were the most absurdly\r\ncheerful things in the woods. Before the autumn was fairly over they had\r\nbegun to sing their famous refrain, \'Spring Soon,\' and kept it up with\r\ngood heart more or less all through the winter\'s direst storms, till\r\nat length the waning of the Hunger Moon, our February, seemed really\r\nto lend some point to the ditty, and they redoubled their optimistic\r\nannouncement to the world in an \'I-told-you-so\' mood. Soon good support\r\nwas found, for the sun gained strength and melted the snow from the\r\nsouthern slope of Castle Frank Hill, and exposed great banks of fragrant\r\nwintergreen, whose berries were a bounteous feast for Redruff, and,\r\nending the hard work of pulling frozen browse, gave his bill the needed\r\nchance to grow into its proper shape again. Very soon the first bluebird\r\ncame flying over and warbled as he flew \'The spring is coming.\' The\r\nsun kept gaining, and early one day in the dark of the Wakening Moon of\r\nMarch there was a loud \'Caw, caw,\' and old Silver-spot, the king-crow,\r\ncame swinging along from the south at the head of his troops and\r\nofficially announced,\r\n\r\n\'THE SPRING HAS COME\'\r\n\r\nAll nature seemed to respond to this, the opening of the birds\' New\r\nYear, and yet it was something within that chiefly seemed to move them.\r\nThe chickadees went simply wild; they sang their \'Spring now, spring now\r\nnow--Spring now now,\' so persistently that one wondered how they found\r\ntime to get a living.\r\n\r\nAnd Redruff felt it thrill him through and through. He sprang with\r\njoyous vigor on a stump and sent rolling down the little valley, again\r\nand again, a thundering \'Thump, thump, thump, thunderrrrrrrrr,\' that\r\nwakened dull echoes as it rolled, and voiced his gladness in the coming\r\nof the spring.\r\n\r\nAway down the valley was Cuddy\'s shanty. He heard the drum-call on the\r\nstill morning air and \'reckoned there was a cock patridge to git,\' and\r\ncame sneaking up the ravine with his gun. But Redruff skimmed away\r\nin silence, nor rested till once more in Mud Creek Glen. And there he\r\nmounted the very log where first he had drummed and rolled his loud\r\ntattoo again and again, till a small boy who had taken a short cut to\r\nthe mill through the woods, ran home, badly scared, to tell his mother\r\nhe was sure the Indians were on the war-path, for he heard their\r\nwar-drums beating in the glen.\r\n\r\nWhy does a happy boy holla? Why does a lonesome youth sigh? They don\'t\r\nknow any more than Redruff knew why every day now he mounted some dead\r\nlog and thumped and thundered to the woods; then strutted and admired\r\nhis gorgeous blazing ruffs as they flashed their jewels in the sunlight,\r\nand then thundered out again. Whence now came the strange wish for\r\nsomeone else to admire the plumes? And why had such a notion never come\r\ntill the Pussywillow Moon?\r\n\r\n\'Thump, thump, thunder-r-r-r-r-r-rrrr\'\r\n\r\n\'Thump, thump, thunder-r-r-r-r-r-rrrr\'\r\n\r\nhe rumbled again and again.\r\n\r\nDay after day he sought the favorite log, and a new beauty, a rose-red\r\ncomb, grew out above each clear, keen eye, and the clumsy snowshoes were\r\nwholly shed from his feet. His ruff grew finer, his eye brighter, and\r\nhis whole appearance splendid to behold, as he strutted and flashed in\r\nthe sun. But--oh! he was so lonesome now.\r\n\r\nYet what could he do but blindly vent his hankering in this daily\r\ndrum-parade, till on a day early in loveliest May, when the trilliums\r\nhad fringed his log with silver stars, and he had drummed and longed,\r\nthen drummed again, his keen ear caught a sound, a gentle footfall\r\nin the brush. He turned to a statue and watched; he knew he had been\r\nwatched. Could it be possible? Yes! there it was--a form--another--a shy\r\nlittle lady grouse, now bashfully seeking to hide. In a moment he was\r\nby her side. His whole nature swamped by a new feeling--burnt up with\r\nthirst--a cooling spring in sight. And how he spread and flashed his\r\nproud array! How came he to know that that would please? He puffed\r\nhis plumes and contrived to stand just right to catch the sun, and he\r\nstrutted and uttered a low, soft chuckle that must have been as good as\r\nthe \'sweet nothings\' of another race, for clearly now her heart was won.\r\nWon, really, days ago, if only he had known. For full three days she\r\nhad come at the loud tattoo and coyly admired him from afar, and felt a\r\nlittle piqued that he had not yet found out her, so close at hand. So it\r\nwas not quite all mischance, perhaps, that little stamp that caught his\r\near. But now she meekly bowed her head with sweet, submissive grace--the\r\ndesert passed, the parch-burnt wanderer found the spring at last.\r\n\r\nOh, those were bright, glad days in the lovely glen of the unlovely\r\nname. The sun was never so bright, and the piney air was balmier sweet\r\nthan dreams. And that great noble bird came daily on his log, sometimes\r\nwith her and sometimes quite alone, and drummed for very joy of being\r\nalive. But why sometimes alone? Why not forever with his Brownie bride?\r\nWhy should she stay to feast and play with him for hours, then take some\r\nstealthy chance to slip away and see him no more for hours or till next\r\nday, when his martial music from the log announced him restless for her\r\nquick return? There was a woodland mystery here he could not clear. Why\r\nshould her stay with him grow daily less till it was down to minutes,\r\nand one day at last she never came at all. Nor the next, nor the next,\r\nand Redruff, wild, careered on lightning wing and drummed on the old\r\nlog, then away up-stream on another log, and skimmed the hill to another\r\nravine to drum and drum. But on the fourth day, when he came and loudly\r\ncalled her, as of old, at their earliest tryst, he heard a sound in the\r\nbushes, as at first, and there was his missing Brownie bride with ten\r\nlittle peeping partridges following after.\r\n\r\nRedruff skimmed to her side, terribly frightening the bright-eyed\r\ndownlings, and was just a little dashed to find the brood with claims\r\nfar stronger than his own. But he soon accepted the change, and\r\nthenceforth joined himself to the brood, caring for them as his father\r\nnever had for him.\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nGood fathers are rare in the grouse world. The mother-grouse builds her\r\nnest and hatches out her young without help. She even hides the place\r\nof the nest from the father and meets him only at the drum-log and the\r\nfeeding-ground, or perhaps the dusting-place, which is the club-house of\r\nthe grouse kind.\r\n\r\nWhen Brownie\'s little ones came out they had filled her every thought,\r\neven to the forgetting of their splendid father. But on the third\r\nday, when they were strong enough, she had taken them with her at the\r\nfather\'s call.\r\n\r\nSome fathers take no interest in their little ones, but Redruff joined\r\nat once to help Brownie in the task of rearing the brood. They had\r\nlearned to eat and drink just as their father had learned long ago, and\r\ncould toddle along, with their mother leading the way, while the father\r\nranged near by or followed far behind.\r\n\r\nThe very next day, as they went from the hill-side down toward the creek\r\nin a somewhat drawn-out string, like beads with a big one at each end,\r\na red squirrel, peeping around a pine-trunk, watched the procession of\r\ndownlings with the Runtie straggling far in the rear. Redruff, yards\r\nbehind, preening his feathers on a high log, had escaped the eye of the\r\nsquirrel, whose strange perverted thirst for birdling blood was roused\r\nat what seemed so fair a chance. With murderous intent to cut off the\r\nhindmost straggler, he made a dash. Brownie could not have seen him\r\nuntil too late, but Redruff did. He flew for that red-haired cutthroat;\r\nhis weapons were his fists, that is, the knob-joints of the wings, and\r\nwhat a blow he could strike! At the first onset he struck the squirrel\r\nsquare on the end of the nose, his weakest spot, and sent him reeling;\r\nhe staggered and wriggled into a brush-pile, where he had expected to\r\ncarry the little grouse, and there lay gasping with red drops trickling\r\ndown his wicked snout. The partridges left him lying there, and what\r\nbecame of him they never knew, but he troubled them no more.\r\n\r\nThe family went on toward the water, but a cow had left deep tracks in\r\nthe sandy loam, and into one of these fell one of the chicks and peeped\r\nin dire distress when he found he could not get out.\r\n\r\nThis was a fix. Neither old one seemed to know what to do, but as they\r\ntrampled vainly round the edge, the sandy bank caved in, and, running\r\ndown, formed a long slope, up which the young one ran and rejoined his\r\nbrothers under the broad veranda of their mother\'s tail.\r\n\r\nBrownie was a bright little mother, of small stature, but keen of wit\r\nand sense, and was, night and day, alert to care for her darling chicks.\r\nHow proudly she stepped and clucked through the arching woods with her\r\ndainty brood behind her; how she strained her little brown tail almost\r\nto a half-circle to give them a broader shade, and never flinched at\r\nsight of any foe, but held ready to fight or fly, whichever seemed the\r\nbest for her little ones.\r\n\r\nBefore the chicks could fly they had a meeting with old Cuddy; though\r\nit was June, he was out with his gun. Up the third ravine he went, and\r\nTike, his dog, ranging ahead, came so dangerously near the Brownie brood\r\nthat Redruff ran to meet him, and by the old but never failing trick led\r\nhim on a foolish chase away back down the valley of the Don.\r\n\r\nBut Cuddy, as it chanced, came right along, straight for the brood, and\r\nBrownie, giving the signal to the children, \'Krrr, krrr\' (Hide, hide),\r\nran to lead the man away just as her mate had led the dog. Full of a\r\nmother\'s devoted love, and skilled in the learning of the woods, she ran\r\nin silence till quite near, then sprang with a roar of wings right in\r\nhis face, and tumbling on the leaves she shammed a lameness that for a\r\nmoment deceived the poacher. But when she dragged one wing and\r\nwhined about his feet, then slowly crawled away, he knew just what it\r\nmeant--that it was all a trick to lead him from her brood, and he struck\r\nat her a savage blow; but little Brownie was quick, she avoided the blow\r\nand limped behind a sapling, there to beat herself upon the leaves again\r\nin sore distress, and seem so lame that Cuddy made another try to strike\r\nher down with a stick. But she moved in time to balk him, and bravely,\r\nsteadfast still to lead him from her helpless little ones, she flung\r\nherself before him and beat her gentle breast upon the ground, and\r\nmoaned as though begging for mercy. And Cuddy, failing again to strike\r\nher, raised his gun and firing charge enough to kill a bear, he blew\r\npoor brave, devoted Brownie into quivering, bloody rags.\r\n\r\nThis gunner brute knew the young must be hiding near, so looked about to\r\nfind them. But no one moved or peeped. He saw not one, but as he tramped\r\nabout with heedless, hateful feet, he crossed and crossed again their\r\nhiding-ground, and more than one of the silent little sufferers he\r\ntrampled to death, and neither knew nor cared.\r\n\r\nRedruff had taken the yellow brute away off downstream, and now returned\r\nto where he left his mate. The murderer had gone, taking her remains,\r\nto be thrown to the dog. Redruff sought about and found the bloody spot\r\nwith feathers, Brownie\'s feathers, scattered around, and now he knew the\r\nmeaning of that shot.\r\n\r\nWho can tell what his horror and his mourning were? The outward signs\r\nwere few, some minutes dumbly gazing at the place with downcast,\r\ndraggled look, and then a change at the thought of their helpless brood.\r\nBack to the hiding-place he went, and called the well-known \'kreet,\r\nkreet.\' Did every grave give up its little inmate at the magic word? No,\r\nbarely more than half; six little balls of down unveiled their lustrous\r\neyes, and, rising, ran to meet him, but four feathered little bodies had\r\nfound their graves indeed. Redruff called again and again, till he\r\nwas sure that all who could respond had come, and led them from that\r\ndreadful place, far, far away up-stream, where barb-wire fences and\r\nbramble thickets were found to offer a less grateful, but more reliable,\r\nshelter.\r\n\r\nHere the brood grew and were trained by their father just as his mother\r\nhad trained him; though wider knowledge and experience gave him\r\nmany advantages. He knew so well the country round and all the\r\nfeeding-grounds, and how to meet the ills that harass partridge-life,\r\nthat the summer passed and not a chick was lost. They grew and\r\nflourished, and when the Gunner Moon arrived they were a fine family\r\nof six grown-up grouse with Redruff, splendid in his gleaming copper\r\nfeathers, at their head. He had ceased to drum during the summer after\r\nthe loss of Brownie, but drumming is to the partridge what singing is\r\nto the lark; while it is his lovesong, it is also an expression of\r\nexuberance born of health, and when the molt was over and September food\r\nand weather had renewed his splendid plumes and braced himself up again,\r\nhis spirits revived, and finding himself one day near the old log he\r\nmounted impulsively, and drummed again and again.\r\n\r\nFrom that time he often drummed, while his children sat around, or one\r\nwho showed his father\'s blood would mount some nearby stump or stone,\r\nand beat the air in the loud tattoo.\r\n\r\nThe black grapes and the Mad Moon now came on. But Redruff\'s brood were\r\nof a vigorous stock; their robust health meant robust wits, and though\r\nthey got the craze, it passed within a week, and only three had flown\r\naway for good.\r\n\r\nRedruff, with his remaining three, was living in the glen when the snow\r\ncame. It was light, flaky snow, and as the weather was not very cold,\r\nthe family squatted for the night under the low, flat boughs of a\r\ncedar-tree. But next day the storm continued, it grew colder, and the\r\ndrifts piled up all day. At night, the snow-fall ceased, but the frost\r\ngrew harder still, so Redruff, leading the family to a birch-tree above\r\na deep drift, dived into the snow, and the others did the same.\r\nThen into the holes the wind blew the loose snow--their pure white\r\nbed-clothes, and thus tucked in they slept in comfort, for the snow is\r\na warm wrap, and the air passes through it easily enough for breathing.\r\nNext morning each partridge found a solid wall of ice before him from\r\nhis frozen breath, but easily turned to one side and rose on the wing at\r\nRedruff\'s morning \'Kreet, kreet, kwit,\' (Come children, come children,\r\nfly.)\r\n\r\nThis was the first night for them in a snow-drift, though it was an old\r\nstory to Redruff, and next night they merrily dived again into bed, and\r\nthe north wind tucked them in as before. But a change of weather was\r\nbrewing. The night wind veered to the east. A fall of heavy flakes gave\r\nplace to sleet, and that to silver rain.\r\n\r\nThe whole wide world was sheathed in ice, and when the grouse awoke to\r\nquit their beds, they found themselves sealed in with a great cruel\r\nsheet of edgeless ice. The deeper snow was still quite soft, and Redruff\r\nbored his way to the top, but there the hard, white sheet defied his\r\nstrength. Hammer and struggle as he might he could make no impression,\r\nand only bruised his wings and head. His life had been made up of keen\r\njoys and dull hardships, with frequent sudden desperate straits, but\r\nthis seemed the hardest brunt of all, as the slow hours wore on and\r\nfound him weakening with his struggles, but no nearer to freedom. He\r\ncould hear the struggling of his family, too, or sometimes heard\r\nthem calling to him for help with their long-drawn plaintive\r\n\'p-e-e-e-e-e-t-e, p-e-e-e-e-e-t-e.\'\r\n\r\nThey were hidden from many of their enemies, but not from the pangs of\r\nhunger, and when the night came down the weary prisoners, worn out with\r\nhunger and useless toil, grew quiet in despair. At first they had been\r\nafraid the fox would come and find them imprisoned there at his mercy,\r\nbut as the second night went slowly by they no longer cared, and even\r\nwished he would come and break the crusted snow, and so give them at\r\nleast a fighting chance for life.\r\n\r\nBut when the fox really did come padding over the frozen drift, the\r\ndeep-laid love of life revived, and they crouched in utter stillness\r\ntill he passed. The second day was one of driving storm. The north\r\nwind sent his snow-horses, hissing and careering over the white earth,\r\ntossing and curling their white manes and kicking up more snow as they\r\ndashed on. The long, hard grinding of the granular snow seemed to be\r\nthinning the snow-crust, for though far from dark below, it kept on\r\ngrowing lighter. Redruff had pecked and pecked at the under side all\r\nday, till his head ached and his bill was wearing blunt, but when the\r\nsun went down he seemed as far as ever from escape. The night passed\r\nlike the others, except no fox went trotting overhead. In the morning he\r\nrenewed his pecking, though now with scarcely any force, and the voices\r\nor struggles of the others were no more heard. As the daylight grew\r\nstronger he could see that his long efforts had made a brighter spot\r\nabove him in the snow, and he continued feebly pecking. Outside, the\r\nstorm-horses kept on trampling all day, the crust was really growing\r\nthin under their heels, and late that afternoon his bill went through\r\ninto the open air. New life came with this gain, and he pecked away,\r\ntill just before the sun went down he had made a hole that his head, his\r\nneck, and his ever-beautiful ruffs could pass. His great broad shoulders\r\nwere too large, but he could now strike downward, which gave him\r\nfourfold force; the snow-crust crumbled quickly, and in a little while\r\nhe sprang from his icy prison once more free.\r\n\r\nBut the young ones! Redruff flew to the nearest bank, hastily gathered\r\na few red hips to stay his gnawing hunger, then returned to the\r\nprison-drift and clucked and stamped. He got only one reply, a feeble\r\n\'peete, peete,\' and scratching with his sharp claws on the thinned\r\ngranular sheet he soon broke through, and Graytail feebly crawled out\r\nof the hole. But that was all; the others, scattered he could not tell\r\nwhere in the drift, made no reply, gave no sign of life, and he was\r\nforced to leave them. When the snow melted in the spring their bodies\r\ncame to view, skin, bones, and feathers--nothing more.\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nIt was long before Redruff and Graytail fully recovered, but food and\r\nrest in plenty are sure cure-alls, and a bright clear day in midwinter\r\nhad the usual effect of setting the vigorous Redruff to drumming on the\r\nlog. Was it the drumming, or the tell-tale tracks of their snow-shoes\r\non the omnipresent snow, that betrayed them to Cuddy? He came prowling\r\nagain and again up the ravine, with dog and gun, intent to hunt the\r\npartridges down. They knew him of old, and he was coming now to know\r\nthem well. That great copper-ruffed cock was becoming famous up and\r\ndown the valley. During the Gunner Moon many a one had tried to end his\r\nsplendid life, just as a worthless wretch of old sought fame by burning\r\nthe Ephesian wonder of the world. But Redruff was deep in woodcraft. He\r\nknew just where to hide, and when to rise on silent wing, and when\r\nto squat till overstepped, then rise on thunder wing within a yard to\r\nshield himself at once behind some mighty tree-trunk and speed away.\r\n\r\nBut Cuddy never ceased to follow with his gun that red-ruffed cock; many\r\na long snapshot he tried, but somehow always found a tree, a bank, or\r\nsome safe shield between, and Redruff lived and throve and drummed.\r\n\r\nWhen the Snow Moon came he moved with Graytail to the Castle Frank\r\nwoods, where food was plenty as well as grand old trees. There was in\r\nparticular, on the east slope among the creeping hemlocks, a splendid\r\npine. It was six feet through, and its first branches began at the tops\r\nof the other trees. Its top in summer-time was a famous resort for\r\nthe bluejay and his bride. Here, far beyond the reach of shot, in warm\r\nspring days the jay would sing and dance before his mate, spread his\r\nbright blue plumes and warble the sweetest fairyland music, so sweet and\r\nsoft that few hear it but the one for whom it is meant, and books know\r\nnothing at all about it.\r\n\r\nThis great pine had an especial interest for Redruff, now living near\r\nwith his remaining young one, but its base, not its far-away crown,\r\nconcerned him. All around were low, creeping hemlocks, and among them\r\nthe partridge-vine and the wintergreen grew, and the sweet black\r\nacorns could be scratched from under the snow. There was no better\r\nfeeding-ground, for when that insatiable gunner came on them there it\r\nwas easy to run low among the hemlocks to the great pine, then rise with\r\na derisive whirr behind its bulk, and keeping the huge trunk in line\r\nwith the deadly gun, skim off in safety. A dozen times at least the pine\r\nhad saved them during the lawful murder season, and here it was that\r\nCuddy, knowing their feeding habits, laid a new trap. Under the bank he\r\nsneaked and watched in ambush while an accomplice went around the Sugar\r\nLoaf to drive the birds. He came trampling through the low thicket\r\nwhere Redruff and Graytail were feeding, and long before the gunner was\r\ndangerously near Redruff gave a low warning \'rrrrr\' (danger) and walked\r\nquickly toward the great pine in case they had to rise.\r\n\r\nGraytail was some distance up the hill, and suddenly caught sight of a\r\nnew foe close at hand, the yellow cur, coming right on. Redruff, much\r\nfarther off, could not see him for the bushes, and Graytail became\r\ngreatly alarmed.\r\n\r\n\'Kwit, kwit\' (Fly, fly), she cried, running down the hill for a start.\r\n\'Kreet, k-r-r-r\' (This way, hide), cried the cooler Redruff, for he saw\r\nthat now the man with the gun was getting in range. He gained the\r\ngreat trunk, and behind it, as he paused a moment to call earnestly to\r\nGraytail, \'This way, this way,\' he heard a slight noise under the bank\r\nbefore him that betrayed the ambush, then there was a terrified cry from\r\nGraytail as the dog sprang at her, she rose in air and skimmed behind\r\nthe shielding trunk, away from the gunner in the open, right into the\r\npower of the miserable wretch under the bank.\r\n\r\nWhirr, and up she went, a beautiful, sentient, noble being.\r\n\r\nBang, and down she fell--battered and bleeding, to gasp her life out and\r\nto lie, mere carrion in the snow.\r\n\r\nIt was a perilous place for Redruff. There was no chance for a safe\r\nrise, so he squatted low. The dog came within ten feet of him, and the\r\nstranger, coming across to Cuddy, passed at five feet, but he never\r\nmoved till a chance came to slip behind the great trunk away from both.\r\nThen he safely rose and flew to the lonely glen by Taylor\'s Hill.\r\n\r\nOne by one the deadly cruel gun had stricken his near ones down, till\r\nnow, once more, he was alone. The Snow Moon slowly passed with many a\r\nnarrow escape, and Redruff, now known to be the only survivor of his\r\nkind, was relentlessly pursued, and grew wilder every day.\r\n\r\nIt seemed, at length, a waste of time to follow him with a gun, so when\r\nthe snow was deepest, and food scarcest, Cuddy hatched a new plot. Right\r\nacross the feeding-ground, almost the only good one now in the Stormy\r\nMoon, he set a row of snares. A cottontail rabbit, an old friend, cut\r\nseveral of these with his sharp teeth, but some remained, and Redruff,\r\nwatching a far-off speck that might turn out a hawk, trod right in one\r\nof them, and in an instant was jerked into the air to dangle by one\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\nHave the wild things no moral or legal rights? What right has man to\r\ninflict such long and fearful agony on a fellow-creature, simply because\r\nthat creature does not speak his language? All that day, with growing,\r\nracking pains, poor Redruff hung and beat his great, strong wings in\r\nhelpless struggles to be free. All day, all night, with growing torture,\r\nuntil he only longed for death. But no one came. The morning broke, the\r\nday wore on, and still he hung there, slowly dying; his very strength a\r\ncurse. The second night crawled slowly down, and when, in the dawdling\r\nhours of darkness, a great Horned Owl, drawn by the feeble flutter of a\r\ndying wing, cut short the pain, the deed was wholly kind.\r\n\r\nThe wind blew down the valley from the north. The snow-horses went\r\nracing over the wrinkled ice, over the Don Flats, and over the marsh\r\ntoward the lake, white, for they were driven snow, but on them,\r\nscattered dark, were riding plumy fragments of partridge ruffs--the\r\nfamous rainbow ruffs. And they rode on the winter wind that night, away\r\nand away to the south, over the dark and boisterous lake, as they rode\r\nin the gloom of his Mad Moon flight, riding and riding on till they were\r\nengulfed, the last trace of the last of the Don Valley race.\r\n\r\nFor now no partridge comes to Castle Frank. Its wood-birds miss the\r\nmartial spring salute, and in Mud Creek Ravine the old pine drumlog,\r\nsince unused, has rotted in silence away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Wild Animals I Have  Known, by\r\nErnest Thompson Seton\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK WILD ANIMALS I HAVE  KNOWN ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 3031.txt or 3031.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/3/0/3/3031/\r\n\r\nProduced by David Reed\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
