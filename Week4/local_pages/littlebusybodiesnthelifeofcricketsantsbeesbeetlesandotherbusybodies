They are real, and the good times they have are\r\nreal, as any boy or girl who has lived out-of-doors will know. And the\r\nstories are true. Peter is not always good. But do you expect a child\r\n_always_ to be good? We do not. Sometimes, too, the frolics turn in to a\r\nscramble to catch a dragon-fly that will not be caught, and there are\r\naccidents. Also, Betty and Jack work hard to win a prize which the guide\r\ngives to the child who learns most about ants.\r\n\r\nOf course it would be impossible for five children to go in search of\r\nlocusts, grasshoppers, crickets, katydids, dragon-flies, May-flies,\r\nleaf-hoppers, lace-wings, caddis-worms, butterflies, beetles, bees,\r\nwasps--and so many other six-legged creatures that among them they have\r\nwings and legs enough to fill a new Pandora\'s box--without having a\r\ngood deal happen. And a good deal does happen. It is all true enough,\r\nand every word about the six-legged busybodies is true as true. The\r\nother books, too, that come after this in our _Story-Told Science\r\nSeries_ will be every word true.\r\n\r\nAnd we who wrote this book? Well, we, too, have been children. We used\r\nto climb trees and turn somersaults; why--But that is another story! And\r\nwe remember so well what it used to be like to have to learn dull things\r\nwe did not wish to know. So we said to ourselves, as we looked over our\r\nspectacles at each other, "No, they sha\'n\'t be told a single\r\nuninteresting fact; they sha\'n\'t be dull, poor dears, as we were so long\r\nago, before we put on spectacles and began to call ourselves wise."\r\n\r\nAnd so, although we sat down and wrote a book just about long enough for\r\na school-year\'s work; although we felt very proud because our stories\r\nhad more wonderful six-legged creatures than any book written for\r\nchildren; although we took pains to have in the book only such little\r\ncreatures as any one of us could see any day; although we hoped that\r\nmothers and teachers would say, "At last, this is a book the children\r\nand I can like and find useful!" or, "There, that will help as a\r\nstarting-point to tell about the bees and the flowers!" or, "This story\r\nabout the flies will teach the children what it means to be clean!"\r\nAlthough, I say, we hoped all these things, yet our chief hope was that\r\nwe might give all sorts of children a good time.\r\n\r\nSo we put our spectacles on and looked very wise, and took a quantity of\r\nink on our pens and began to write. And we wrote and wrote and wrote.\r\nAnd part of the time, while one of us was writing and hoping the stories\r\nwould be so interesting the children would want to write about them,\r\ntoo, the other was drawing and labelling each sketch so plainly that any\r\nchild could understand it, even if the ears were quite where they could\r\nnot be expected to be, or there were more eyes than, seemingly, one\r\ncreature ought to have, or wings and legs served to make music, as no\r\nsensible child could possibly guess.\r\n\r\nAnd now we can\'t do better than wish you a good time before we say\r\ngood-bye. We wish you to enjoy all the frolics, to feel how jolly it is\r\nto be out-of-doors in the woods and fields and lakes, climbing,\r\ncanoeing, picnicing, and swimming.\r\n\r\nBut still more, we hope that you will realize that more wonderful than\r\nthe most wonderful fairy story ever told is the marvel of the created\r\nlife of these little insects; we want you to come to know something of\r\ntheir joys and troubles; we want you to learn how to be kind to them,\r\nand how they may be useful to you; and we want you to find out for\r\nyourselves the places they take in the great plan of creation.\r\n\r\nIn other words, we want you to think and feel about the lives of these\r\nsix-legged busybodies, and see for yourselves how much even a butterfly\r\ncan add to the interest and beauty of living. Does this seem a little\r\nbit like a sermon? Well, you see, we forgot we had kept on our\r\nspectacles so long, and somehow spectacles always turn into sermons.\r\nPerhaps it is because both begin with the letter S.\r\n\r\nAnd now this is all of our short word to the wise. We expect to make\r\neach one of our books better than the last, and you can help us to do\r\nthis by writing any suggestions you may have. We shall be glad to hear\r\nfrom children, big or little.\r\n\r\nJ. M. and J. M.\r\n\r\nSouth Hadley, Massachusetts,\r\nJanuary 27, 1909.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITTLE BUSYBODIES\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTHE JOURNEY\r\n\r\n\r\n"It will be stories all summer, won\'t it?" said Betty to her mother.\r\n\r\n"Yes, dear."\r\n\r\n"And hunting, too?" said Jimmie.\r\n\r\n"Hunting with your new gun and hunting with your camera."\r\n\r\nJimmie unfastened the case of his new camera and looked in. What a\r\nbeautiful one it was, and what pictures he meant to take, and how the\r\ncamera would impress Ben Gile! Jimmie looked about proudly. He knew no\r\nother boy in that whole great train had a camera like the one his father\r\nhad given him.\r\n\r\n"Mother, when will it be lunch?" asked Betty.\r\n\r\n"Luncheon so soon!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m as hungry as a bear," declared Jimmie.\r\n\r\n"And hear Kitty mewing; she\'s hungry, too." Betty looked at the big\r\nround basket, whose cover kept restlessly stirring.\r\n\r\n"Did you leave something in the baggage-car for Max to eat?" Mrs. Reece\r\nasked Jimmie.\r\n\r\n"Yes, mum. It\'s one o\'clock; can\'t we have something now?"\r\n\r\n"As late as that! No wonder you chickens are hungry for--"\r\n\r\n"Chicken!" squealed Betty.\r\n\r\n"And ham sandwiches!" added Jimmie.\r\n\r\n"And chocolate cake!"\r\n\r\n"And root-beer!"\r\n\r\n"And peppermints!"\r\n\r\n"Ssh!" said Mrs. Reece, "or every one in the car will know what little\r\npiggies you are. Ask Lizzie for the basket."\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n_A._ Outer wing of locust.\r\n_B._ Inner wing of locust.\r\n_C._ Sideview of locust.\r\n   _a._ Antenna.\r\n   _b._ Simple eye.\r\n   _c._ Compound eye.\r\n   _d._ Thorax.\r\n   _e._ Abdomen.\r\n   _f._ Breathing pore.\r\n   _g._ Ear.\r\n_D._ Hind leg of locust.]\r\n\r\nEvery minute the air was growing cooler. The children could smell the\r\npine woods, and once in a while the train flashed by a great big\r\nsawmill, or a lake set like a sapphire in the deep green of the forests.\r\nAnd the hills were rolling nearer and nearer in great shadows. The\r\nchildren ate their luncheon contentedly, looking out of the windows and\r\nthinking of the mountains there would be to climb, the ponds, the\r\nstreams to fish, the pictures to take, and the stories they were to hear\r\nthe summer long.\r\n\r\n"Mother," said Betty, eating her second piece of chocolate\r\ncake--"mother, what will Ben Gile tell us this summer?"\r\n\r\n"Let me see," said her mother, "perhaps it will be about the little\r\ncreatures--grasshoppers and katydids, butterflies and bees."\r\n\r\n"Goody!"\r\n\r\n"Pooh!" said Jimmie, "I don\'t see what you want to know of those old\r\nthings. I\'d much rather hear about porcupines. There isn\'t anything to\r\nsay about a grasshopper except that it hops."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t there, my son? Well, that shows that you don\'t use your eyes.\r\nSuppose some one said there was nothing to say about you except that you\r\nwhistle?"\r\n\r\n"Well, what is there about an old grasshopper, anyhow?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, but Ben will."\r\n\r\n"But tell us something, mum," urged Jimmie, who loved his mother dearly,\r\nand was certain she knew more than anybody else, in part because she had\r\nbeen to college, but chiefly because she was his mother.\r\n\r\n"Let me see," said Mrs. Reece, "I shall have to think about it." Both\r\nof the children came as close to her as they could, while she continued:\r\n\r\n"What a strange world it would be if there were no insects in it! We\r\nshould have no little crickets chirping in the sunny fields or in the\r\ndark corners and cracks of our houses. There would be no katydids\r\nsinging all night, no clacking of the locusts in the tall grass along\r\ndusty roads, no drowsy hum of bees. There would be no little ants and\r\nbig ants digging out underground tunnels and carrying the grains of sand\r\nas far from their doorways as possible. There would be no brightly\r\ncolored moths and butterflies flitting from flower to flower. We should\r\nfind no sparkling fairy webs spun anew for us every morning."\r\n\r\n"But, mother, all these creatures aren\'t insects," said Jimmie.\r\n\r\n"Yes, they are, dear. It is hard to believe that they all belong to the\r\nsame family called insecta, but they do."\r\n\r\n"Mother, what\'s that word mean?"\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t mean anything more than cut up into parts. You see, Betty,\r\nall these insect bodies are made up of separate rings joined nicely\r\ntogether. If you look carefully you will find that behind the head there\r\nis another distinct part. This is called the thorax, which means chest.\r\nBehind that there is a pointed part of the body, which is called the\r\nabdomen. Then, if you look again, you will see that all these little\r\ncreatures are alike in that they have six jointed legs."\r\n\r\n"And are they all good, like the bee and the butterfly?" asked Betty,\r\nwho wasn\'t always a good little girl herself, and who thought it would\r\nbe much nicer if insects were naughty sometimes.\r\n\r\n"Not all, dear," answered Mrs. Reece; "some do us real service, but\r\nothers are troublesome; insects are such hungry little fellows, and they\r\ndon\'t have chocolate cake every day to keep them from getting hungry.\r\nThey are hungry when they are babies and hungry when they grow up. Some\r\neat all they can see--like a little boy I know--and some prefer the\r\ntender leaves and twigs. Some care only for the sweet sap flowing into\r\nthe new leaves and buds. And still others like best the tender new roots\r\nof plants."\r\n\r\n"Mother, what are the baddest ones?" asked Betty.\r\n\r\n"Pooh! I know," said Jimmie; "the beetles are, because they eat\r\neverything. Why, they\'d eat the buttons off your coat or the nose off\r\nyour face or--"\r\n\r\n"Jim! Jim! do tell the truth! The beetles, and bugs, too, are the most\r\ntroublesome. Many of the bugs are such tiny little creatures that it is\r\nhard to realize that they can hurt a plant. But bugs have sucking beaks.\r\nWith these beaks they bore into the leaves or the buds of the plant, and\r\nthen by means of tiny muscles at the back of the mouth they pump up the\r\nsap. To be sure, one little pump could do no harm; but think of millions\r\nof little sucking beaks, millions of little pumps busy at work on a\r\nsingle plant! Do you remember the pansies mother had in the winter, and\r\nhow they were all covered by green plant-lice? Well, those are bugs\r\ncalled aphids. You remember they were pale green, just the color of the\r\nplant, and so transparent and soft they looked most harmless. The scale\r\ninsects are very troublesome, too, but mother doesn\'t know anything\r\nabout them."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know what _they_ are," announced Jimmie, "they get into the fruit\r\ntrees."\r\n\r\n"And sometimes onto shrubs, too. Mother has heard of a scale insect out\r\nin California which has been a great nuisance to fruit-growers. A\r\ncertain ladybug finds this cottony-cushion scale a tender morsel, so\r\nmany ladybugs were taken out there to help the owners of the fruit farms\r\nget rid of the scale."\r\n\r\n"Did they carry them all the way out, mother?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," answered Jimmie; "they got a Pullman car for them, and Mr. and\r\nMrs. Ladybug and family travelled in style."\r\n\r\n"Mother, tell Jim to be still." Betty, not unlike other little sisters,\r\nhated to be teased by her brother.\r\n\r\n"And now, let me see," said Mrs. Reece. "I don\'t know that I can tell\r\nyou any more until I know more myself. Yes, I do know what baby beetles\r\nare called. They are called grubs, and they live in the ground until it\r\nis time for them to turn into grown-up beetles. While they are babies\r\nthey eat as much and as fast as they can, as no baby but a beetle\r\nshould. The more they eat the sooner they come out into the bright world\r\nas a June-bug or some other kind of beetle. They eat all the tender\r\nlittle roots they can find. This is very nice--"\r\n\r\n"For Mary Ann, but rather hard on Abraham."\r\n\r\n"You horrid boy," said Betty, "you don\'t even let me hear a story in\r\npeace! It\'s very nice what, mother?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s very nice for the little grubs, but it\'s rather hard on the\r\nplants, for if too many roots are nibbled away the plants die. The\r\ncaterpillars are great eaters, too."\r\n\r\nBetty leaned over and whispered something to her mother; then they both\r\ngiggled.\r\n\r\n"I know what you\'re saying," said Jimmie, but after that he was quieter.\r\n\r\n"Sometimes a caterpillar will thrive on just one kind of a plant; it may\r\nbe carrot, it may be milkweed. On that it feeds until it has grown as\r\nlarge as possible. Then it spins itself a nice silken cocoon, or rolls\r\nitself up in a soft leaf and takes a long, long nap. And now it is time\r\nfor us to take a nap, too, for we shall soon reach Bemis, and then there\r\nwill be still two long lakes to cross and a carry to walk."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nRANGELEY VILLAGE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning great was the stir in the town, for it was known by the\r\nvillage children that Betty and Jimmie had come, and by the grown-ups\r\nthat Mrs. Reece was there. All winter long the children had looked\r\nforward to their coming, for it meant jolly times: picnics, parties,\r\nexpeditions, and games. Then, too, Ben Gile would begin to tell them\r\nwonderful things. Through the winter he had been teaching school, and it\r\nwas only when the ice broke up in the big lake and the beavers decided\r\nto stop sleeping that Ben Gile came back to his guiding.\r\n\r\nThere was great excitement about Turtle Lodge. Lizzie kept flying out\r\nwith rugs, and then forgetting they hadn\'t been brushed and flying in\r\nagain. The cat was playing croquet with the balls and spools of an open\r\nwork-basket, and Max had discovered an old straw hat which tasted very\r\ngood to him. Only Mrs. Reece kept her head and stayed indoors, moving\r\nabout quietly from room to room, putting the house in that beautiful\r\norder which little children never think about.\r\n\r\nOut on the grass that sloped down to the street, which, in its turn,\r\ntumbled head over heels down to the lake, Betty and Jimmie were playing\r\nwith their playmates. They were all so wild with joy that every time\r\nJimmie saw another boy he shouted, "Come over!" when the boy was coming,\r\nanyway, just as fast as he could.\r\n\r\nUp, up from the foot of the lake climbed an old man; up, up, up the\r\nsteep street he came, his white hair shaking and shining in the brisk\r\nJune breeze, his long, white beard caught every once in a while by the\r\nwind and tossed sideways.\r\n\r\n"Mother," called Jimmie, "Ben Gile is coming!"\r\n\r\nOut came Mrs. Reece to greet the old man.\r\n\r\nThen, one by one, the children spoke with Ben Gile.\r\n\r\n"You\'re having a good time before you can say Jack Robinson, aren\'t\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," came in a chorus of voices. Then, "Tell us a story; tell us\r\na story!"\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n_A._ A few facets of the compound eye of an insect.\r\n_B._ Brain and nerve cord of an insect.]\r\n\r\n"Not to-day," said the old man. "Why, you want a story before you\'ve had\r\ntime to turn around."\r\n\r\nBetty stuck her head out from behind her mother. "Mother said you would\r\ntell us about crickets and moths, and everything."\r\n\r\n"Well, well, well," murmured the old man, "did she? But I can\'t tell a\r\nstory to-day. I\'ll tell you, though, something, so that when you come to\r\ncollect the little creatures you\'ll know what to do. All sit down."\r\n\r\nThey all sat down cross-legged on the ground, the old man in the middle.\r\n\r\n"Here, you big Jim-boy, catch me that butterfly."\r\n\r\nThere was a wild rush, and the bright wings were soon caught.\r\n\r\n"There, you\'ve torn off one of its legs," said the old man.\r\n\r\nJimmie looked troubled. "I didn\'t mean to, sir."\r\n\r\n"Do you know how it hurts to have your leg torn off, boy? Do you know,\r\nchildren?"\r\n\r\n"No," came in a chorus.\r\n\r\nThe guide took out a piece of paper and drew a picture on it. "There,\r\nevery part of that little fellow\'s body I\'ve drawn has muscles, such\r\nfine muscles no naked eye could ever see them. I\'ll show them to you\r\nunder the microscope in my cabin. Those muscles move the body, and each\r\nmuscle is controlled by threads, still more fine, called nerves."\r\n\r\nThe old man reached out like a flash and pinched Jimmie.\r\n\r\n"Ouch!" cried the boy, and there was a shout of laughter from the\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n"You felt that?"\r\n\r\n"I guess I did," said Jim, sulkily.\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s because you\'re made something the same way this butterfly\r\nis. When anything hurts us it\'s because some of our nerves are hurt, and\r\nquick as a flash the news travels to the brain, and we try to get away\r\nfrom the thing that causes pain--a pinch, perhaps, or, still worse, the\r\nhurt of a poor leg that has been torn off."\r\n\r\n"But a butterfly hasn\'t any brain," objected Jimmie, who was still\r\ncross.\r\n\r\n"Hasn\'t it? Well, we\'ll see. Now, you watch my pencil." He pointed to\r\nthe head of the butterfly. "This little fellow has a very tiny brain\r\nthere. Also running through the body, from end to end, is a little tube\r\nthrough which the food passes. It is in the head above this tube where\r\nthe tiny brain is, and from which two little threads run down around\r\nthe tube and join to form another little knot of nerve cells like that\r\nof the brain. Then, from this second one there runs a series of little\r\nknots united by fine threads the entire length of the body, one in each\r\nring of the body. Do you understand that?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," piped up Betty, "mother told us an insect is made up of rings,\r\nand--and--" she stammered, surprised at her own boldness, "the word\r\nmeans cut up into parts."\r\n\r\n"Good! Why, that\'s a real bright girl. Well, from each one of these\r\nknots nerves go to the muscles of the body."\r\n\r\n"It\'s just like a lot of beads on a string," said Hope Stanton.\r\n\r\n"So it is, child. So, you see, if we handle an insect roughly, squeezing\r\nit too hard, or breaking a leg or a wing, a message is sent to one of\r\nthese little beads or knots or nerve cells, and the poor, helpless\r\ncreature suffers pain."\r\n\r\n"But I didn\'t mean to hurt that butterfly!"\r\n\r\n"No, of course you didn\'t. The only way to do," said the old man, "is to\r\ncatch them in a net. Make it of bobinet with a rounded bottom, sewing it\r\nto a wire ring and fastening it to a handle that is the right weight and\r\nlength for your arm."\r\n\r\n"But then, after you caught it, how could you keep it, sir?" asked\r\nBetty.\r\n\r\n"There are two merciful ways," said the old man, "of killing insects,\r\nbut neither way is safe for children to try. Put a few drops of\r\nchloroform on a piece of cotton under a tumbler turned upside down. Put\r\nthe insect inside. It will soon fall asleep without pain. The other is a\r\ncyanide bottle. I have one down at the cabin. It must be kept tightly\r\ncorked and never smelled. The cyanide in the bottle is hard and dry.\r\nSeveral insects may be put into the bottle at the same time. Once there\r\nthey die very quickly. After large insects are killed the wings should\r\nbe folded over the back, and they should be placed in a little case like\r\nthis. See, I\'m folding a piece of paper to form a three-cornered case.\r\nThen I bend down one edge to keep the little case closed."\r\n\r\nAt this moment out flew Lizzie with a curtain which she was going to\r\nshake.\r\n\r\n"Here, here!" shouted the old man, "don\'t shake that; catch that\r\ncaterpillar on it. I want it."\r\n\r\nLizzie made a good-natured grab at the caterpillar, and then there was a\r\ncry of pain. "Oh, begorra, begorra, I\'m stung by a wasp, I am! Ow!" But\r\nshe still kept tight hold of the caterpillar as she danced about.\r\n\r\n"No," said the guide, "you\'re not stung by any wasp. Bring me that!\r\nThere, open your hand. You see, the caterpillar stung you."\r\n\r\n"Oh my, what a beauty!" exclaimed the children. "But caterpillars don\'t\r\nsting."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, they do," continued Ben Gile, with a twinkle in his eye; "ask\r\nLizzie." Lizzie was looking at the palm of her hand, which showed how\r\nbadly it had been stung.\r\n\r\n"Now, you see, we\'ll need something to pick up these little creatures\r\nwith--a pair of forceps or something of that kind. At least, you must be\r\nvery careful."\r\n\r\n"And what else do we need?" asked the children.\r\n\r\n"A little hand lens will magnify the small parts of an insect a great\r\ndeal. It will show you all the tiny hairs on the body, and the little\r\nrings and the feelers and the facets of the eyes, and many another\r\nwonderful thing."\r\n\r\n"What are we going to put the bugs in?" inquired Jimmie.\r\n\r\n"Lizzie will get you a small wooden box," said Mrs. Reece.\r\n\r\nLizzie went off grumbling something about guides and bites and insects,\r\nbut soon she came back with a nice box, and in a minute all the\r\nchildren\'s heads were clustered about Ben Gile as he showed them how to\r\nline the box with a layer of cork, how to steam the insects a little if\r\nthey were dry, and then how to put the long, slender pins through the\r\nchest of the insect and stick it into the cork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTHE LITTLE ARMY\r\n\r\n\r\nBen Gile shook his head. As his hair was long and white, and his hands\r\nmoved with his head, just as if he were a lot of dried branches moving\r\nin the wind, it was enough to frighten little Betty. "Plagues of Egypt!\r\nPlagues of Egypt!" he kept muttering. Now, Betty had been to school a\r\nlong time--I think it must have been as much as two whole years, which\r\nis a very _long_ time for school and a very _short_ time for climbing\r\ntrees--now, Betty had been to school and knew better. She crept behind a\r\nbig beech-tree, but she stuck her little head out and said, in a\r\ntrembling voice:\r\n\r\n"It was locusts, sir, wasn\'t it--and wild honey?"\r\n\r\nBetty wasn\'t at all certain that any kind of honey could be a plague.\r\n\r\n"It was locusts, child--yes, you\'re right," answered the old man.\r\n"Locusts it was; but you eat wild honey."\r\n\r\nBetty came out from behind the tree and whispered, "You eat them\r\n_both_?"\r\n\r\n"So men did in the Bible," said Ben Gile, and washing his sugar-pails,\r\nand putting his maple sugar camp--a very sweet place for a little girl\r\nto be when there are still piles of maple sugar packed away on the\r\nshelves--in order for the summer.\r\n\r\nIn all her short life Betty had never known another old man like him. In\r\nthe winter he taught school; in spring he made maple sugar; in summer he\r\nwas guiding about the ponds or looking up into the trees most of the\r\ntime; and in the fall he cut wood before he went back to teaching; but\r\nwhat was oddest of all to Betty was that he knew the squirrels and deer\r\nand rabbits as well as he seemed to know little girls or little boys.\r\nThere was a story told in those woods about his taming even a trout so\r\nthat one morning it hopped out of the water and followed him everywhere\r\nhe went--hop, hop, flop behind him. And in the evening, as Ben Gile and\r\nhis tame trout were passing by the pond again, the trout fell in and was\r\ndrowned. But, dear me, that is a fish story, and you mustn\'t believe any\r\nfish stories whatever except those your father tells! Still, if your\r\ngrandpa is fond of fishing, you may believe his fish stories, too.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n_A._ A locust.\r\n_B._ Cast-off skin of a young locust.]\r\n\r\nBetty came out farther from behind the tree. "Please, sir, do _you_ eat\r\ngrasshoppers?"\r\n\r\n"Not yet, my dear." The old man\'s eyes twinkled. "I knew a little boy\r\nonce"--Betty was wondering whether this old man had ever been a little\r\nboy himself--"I knew a little boy once who wasn\'t afraid to swallow even\r\na caterpillar, but I think that little boy never thought of eating a\r\ngrasshopper." The old man shook his head gravely. "No, not a\r\ngrasshopper."\r\n\r\n"Please, sir," said Betty, coming right up to the bucket he was washing\r\nin the brook--"please, sir, do you know any stories about grasshoppers?"\r\n\r\nBen Gile laid his finger along his nose and thought. Betty was sure he\r\nknew a hundred million stories, and that he could tell her something\r\nabout anything she might ask for in all the world.\r\n\r\n"Well, once upon a time," the old man began, "there was another old man\r\nwho was a great deal wiser than I am, and a great deal richer, my dear,\r\nfor he owned a whole kingdom and lived in a palace, and his name was--"\r\n\r\n"Solomon!" called out Betty, dancing up and down, out of pride in her\r\nown wisdom.\r\n\r\n"Right! And this other old man said:\r\n\r\n     "There are four things which are little upon the earth, but\r\n     they are exceedingly wise:\r\n\r\n     "The ants are a people not strong, yet they prepare their\r\n     meat in the summer;\r\n\r\n     "The conies are but a feeble folk, yet make they their houses\r\n     in the rocks;\r\n\r\n     "The locusts have no king, yet go they forth all of them by\r\n     bands;\r\n\r\n     "The spider taketh hold with her hands and is in kings\'\r\n     palaces."\r\n\r\n"But that\'s not a story."\r\n\r\nThe guide shook his head. "You don\'t know a story, child, when you hear\r\none. It began, \'Once upon a time,\' didn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir; but please tell me another."\r\n\r\n"Well, there are others in the Bible, my dear, about locusts and\r\ngrasshoppers."\r\n\r\n"But, please, sir," said Betty, who was almost ready to cry, she was so\r\nteased--"please tell me one of your _own_ stories."\r\n\r\nBen Gile began to swash his bucket up and down, up and down, in the\r\nstream until the water fairly rocked. Then he pulled the bucket out of\r\nthe water, set it beside him, and reached out after a locust.\r\n\r\n"Here he is." There was a long pause. Betty thought he would never go\r\non. "Well, once upon a time there was a little army and all its uniforms\r\nwere brown and green, and from the meanest soldier in the ranks to the\r\nlieutenant-commander this little army was made up of insects who\r\nbelonged to the same tribe. Let me see--there were the grasshoppers and\r\nthe locusts and the katydids and the crickets."\r\n\r\n"Please, sir, were they cousins?"\r\n\r\n"I think they were, my dear. Yes, first cousins, and, unlike even my\r\nfirst cousins, they all have wings, and straight wings like this."\r\n\r\nThe guide gently spread out one of the wings.\r\n\r\n"Just where the back of your chest is these wings grow--two pairs of\r\nwings, my dear, and two pairs of wings mean a good deal more than two\r\npairs of new shoes. This first pair is straight and narrow and hard,\r\nbecause it is meant to cover the gauzy wings underneath. Puff!"\r\n\r\nAway flew the locust.\r\n\r\n"You see, he doesn\'t use his first pair, but holds them out straight\r\nfrom his body while he spreads out the gauzy ones like a--like a--"\r\n\r\n"Fan!" shouted Betty, quite forgetting the tiny squirrel who had come up\r\nnear her, and, at her shout, nearly jumped out of his little red\r\njacket.\r\n\r\n"A yellow fan," said the old man. "And some have a red fan. Well, I\r\nthink," said he, reaching for his pail, "there isn\'t going to be any\r\nmore of this story."\r\n\r\n"Not any more? But there must be more, sir; I\'ve seen hundreds and\r\nhundreds of them on a dusty road, and, please, they\'re just the color of\r\nthe dirt."\r\n\r\nThe guide shook his head. "Not to-day."\r\n\r\nBy this time Betty was so eager to have him go on that she had forgotten\r\nall about being afraid of him. "And when they whir up from the road,\r\nsir, they say, \'Clack! clack! clack!\'"\r\n\r\nThe old man made a sound like the noise of a locust.\r\n\r\n"How does it make its mouth move, sir?"\r\n\r\n"It doesn\'t make its mouth move, child. It makes the noise by striking\r\nthe edges of the gauzy wings and hard wing covers together. See, this\r\nway!" And the old man struck his arm and leg together. "It has another\r\nfiddle, too, which it uses when it makes the long, rasping, drowsy sound\r\nof summer days. Then it rubs the rough edges of its hind leg against the\r\nedge of its wing-cover."\r\n\r\n"Please, is it happy, then?" asked Betty.\r\n\r\n"Just as happy as a healthy locust, who lives in long, sweet-smelling\r\ngrass and is contented with his own singing, can be, and that is very\r\nhappy."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" said Betty, "it doesn\'t use its mouth, then? Jimmie said it did."\r\n\r\n"Jimmie\'s a stupid boy. See this fellow." The old man held the locust\r\ntoward Betty. "With its upper lip, broad, you see; and there is the\r\nlower lip made in two scallops, and there\'s a short feeler on either\r\nside, and another pair of soft jaws with a feeler. Hidden away under\r\nthose parts is a pair of dark-brown, horny jaws which open like two big\r\nswinging gates."\r\n\r\n"What makes them so big?"\r\n\r\n"The better to eat you with, my dear." The guide worked his jaws until\r\nBetty, half afraid and half pleased, screamed and ran behind a tree.\r\n"Oh, how they can eat!" growled the old man, "more than any little girl\r\nor boy I ever knew! Years and years ago, when your mamma was a baby,\r\nthey mounted up into the air from the Rocky Mountains and flew eastward\r\nin a great cloud. Down they swooped upon the fertile valleys in rustling\r\nhordes, and ate everything in sight--grass, grains, vegetables, and\r\nbushes. They ate and ate and ate until they had eaten up fifty million\r\ndollars\' worth of food, and the poor farmer could hear nothing but the\r\nsound of the chewing of those ever-swinging jaws. Now, be off, little\r\ngirl, or my pails won\'t be clean."\r\n\r\n"Oh, please, sir, just tell me how they jump and breathe."\r\n\r\n"Dear, dear, see this fellow!" He had wet a little grain of maple sugar,\r\nand a tiny meadow grasshopper which had alighted on his knee was pushing\r\nthe sweet stuff into its mouth with both fore legs. "Child, you must\r\nnever," said the old man, savagely, "push your food in that way."\r\n\r\n"Please, sir," answered Betty, "I never do, because I eat with my fork\r\nand my knife. Please, sir, are they happy when they jump?"\r\n\r\n"Looks like a horse, doesn\'t it?" asked the old man. "It\'s made for\r\njumping. Think of all the training it takes to make a jumper of your\r\nbrother at school. Well, this chap can jump ten times as far. It\'s born\r\nwith a better jump than the longest-legged boy you ever saw. But the\r\nlocust might get its head cut off when jumping if it weren\'t for this\r\nlittle saddle that covers the soft part of the neck. Mr. Locust can\'t\r\nalways look before he leaps, as a little girl can, and the knife edge of\r\na blade of grass would cut its head right off if it weren\'t for this\r\nsaddle. See, here are its long leaping-legs, and on the back edge of\r\nthese are some spines to keep it from slipping, and the feet are padded\r\nwith several soft little cushions that keep it from chin-chopping itself\r\nto pieces when it lands after a long jump. And here, my dear, are little\r\nrest-legs just behind the front legs. With these Mr. Locust hangs on to\r\na blade of grass when tired--a fine idea, child; every little boy and\r\ngirl ought to have some rest-legs like the locust. And the locust has\r\nsome extra eyes, too."\r\n\r\nBen Gile was going so fast now that Betty was listening to him, mouth\r\nopen, as he pointed with a blade of grass to one thing after another.\r\n\r\n"You see, the locust has two big eyes, and there in the middle of the\r\nforehead it has three little eyes, and with five eyes there isn\'t much\r\nit can\'t see. And here on the body are two tiny shining oval windows.\r\nThese are ear-laps, and that, my dear, is the way it hears. And upon the\r\nsides of the body (the thorax--that is, just the chest) and his abdomen\r\nare tiny holes. The air enters through these, and that is the way Mr.\r\nLocust breathes."\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Betty, "then it hasn\'t got any nose? I thought everything in\r\nthe world had a nose."\r\n\r\n"And this little body," the old man went on, "is as strong as a grub\r\nhoe. With it the locust makes holes in fence rails, logs, stumps, and\r\nthe earth, and in those holes mother locust lays her eggs. See, those\r\nfour spines are for boring holes. With these Mrs. Locust bores a hole in\r\nthe ground, and then with these same spines she guides the bundles of\r\neggs into the hole and covers them up with a gummy stuff. There the eggs\r\nstay until next spring, when, my dear, out comes a little hopper with no\r\nwings, and this little hopper is called a nymph. It grows and splits its\r\nskin, grows and splits its skin, and with its new skin--it has five or\r\nsix skins, and leaves all its old clothes hanging around on the\r\nbushes--its wings grow bigger and bigger. At last it flies off just as\r\nits mother and father did a year ago."\r\n\r\nBen Gile tossed the locust into the air and called out, "Shoo!" clapping\r\nhis hands loudly together. Out from the woods came two baby deer, a\r\nwise, gentle old cow; from the cabin came a mother cat and three kittens\r\nand a big black dog; and from the trees scampered down a half a dozen\r\nsquirrels.\r\n\r\n"Time for dinner."\r\n\r\nBetty went up to him and whispered something in his ear. The old man\r\nnodded his head solemnly, and the little girl went trotting along the\r\npath to Rangeley Village.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nFIDDLERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was the greatest scurrying around in the fields on the edge of the\r\nwoods about Ben Gile\'s cabin. Little girls and boys were flitting hither\r\nand thither with pretty nets and small boxes strapped over their\r\nshoulders. Inside the boxes there seemed to be just as much hopping\r\nabout as there was outside.\r\n\r\nBy-and-by the guide put his head out of his cabin door and called, "How\r\nmany have you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, lots and lots!" the children answered.\r\n\r\n"Bring them in." And the children trooped into the cabin, which they\r\nthought quite the most wonderful place in the world. Its walls were\r\nlined with books and cases. The books were not only in English, but also\r\nin French, German, Italian, Latin, Greek, and other languages, and the\r\ncases were filled with scores of specimens, the most beautiful\r\nbutterflies, moths, beetles, birds, flowers, and rare stones. The floor\r\nof the cabin was covered by different kinds of skins. Besides, there\r\nwere telescopes, field-glasses, magnifying-glasses, specimen cases, old\r\nweapons, and a flute. And by the great wide fireplace, in front of which\r\nthe guide was cooking biscuits and cookies in a reflector oven, lay\r\nseveral kittens, the old black dog, Thor, and a dappled fawn which Thor\r\nwas licking.\r\n\r\n"Those crickets sound like pop-guns," said the old man, slipping more\r\ncookies into the oven and setting a pan of biscuits on a shelf by the\r\nhearth.\r\n\r\n"Oh, please," said little Hope, "we\'ve got bushels of them!"\r\n\r\n"Now we\'ll let those cookies bake while we \'tend to the fiddlers. Are\r\nfour pans of cookies enough for five children?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes."\r\n\r\n"Now, Hope, let me have your bushel box. H\'m," he murmured, peeping in,\r\n"all dressed for the party. What color?"\r\n\r\n"Brown, sir."\r\n\r\n"Black, too," said Betty; "and on a few," she added, "there\'s a stripe\r\nor a weeny spot of color."\r\n\r\n"Oho!" exclaimed the old man, "what have we here?" He took a pale little\r\ncreature from Hope\'s basket.\r\n\r\n"Why, it\'s white and green tinted," called Jimmie. "That isn\'t a\r\ncricket."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it? Well, it\'s a first cousin which lives in the trees and loves\r\nits tree home so much, like the sensible little fellow it is, that it\r\nsings \'Tr-e-e-e, tr-e-e-e,\' as fast as it can trill all summer long. But\r\nit is very harmful to the tree, because when egg-laying time comes it\r\ncuts a long slit in the trees in which to lay its eggs. Just a minute!"\r\nThe old man shifted the position of the baker, and out came such a good\r\nodor of cookies that all the children sniffed with delight. "Here,\r\nJack," he said, to a brown little fellow in ragged clothes and bare\r\nfeet, "you have a singer in your box."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t catch but one," said the lad.\r\n\r\n"Briers aren\'t good for bare legs, are they? Never mind, your crickets\r\nwon\'t eat one another."\r\n\r\n"Eat one another?" cried the children.\r\n\r\n"Yes, crickets are cannibals, like some other insects, and they\r\nfrequently eat a near relation or a friend, as the people in the Fiji\r\nIslands used to do. This is a nice brown little chap, Jack. Do you know\r\nhow he makes his music?"\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n_A._ File on wing of cricket.\r\n_B._ Scraper on wing of cricket.\r\n_C._ Mrs. Cricket.]\r\n\r\n"Why, I suppose," said the boy, "he opens his mouth the way Mr. Tucker\r\ndoes in the church choir, and--"\r\n\r\nThere was a shout of laughter from Jimmie, who was sure he knew a great\r\ndeal.\r\n\r\n"Well," said the guide to Jim, "then how does it make its music, since\r\nyou know?"\r\n\r\n"Not with its mouth."\r\n\r\n"Then how?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, sir," stammered Jimmie, who found he didn\'t know as much\r\nas he thought he did.\r\n\r\n"When Mr. Cricket sings," went on the hermit, "it lifts its two wing\r\ncovers so that the edges meet like the pointed roof of a house. Then\r\nyour little fiddler, Jack, rubs one edge against the other."\r\n\r\nAll this time Peter Beech had been waving his hand about, the way\r\nchildren do in school, and giving big sniffs.\r\n\r\n"Please, sir, the cookies are burning."\r\n\r\n"Bless my soul!" The guide whisked the cookies away.\r\n\r\n"Please, sir," said Jack, "are we going to have something soon?" Jack\r\ndid not look as if he had his share of food to eat, for he was as thin\r\nas the fawn which had curled up near him. Jack had twelve brothers and\r\nsisters, and a father who wasn\'t what he ought to be, so there were\r\ntimes when there was no food for Jack.\r\n\r\n"Yes, my son," said the guide, kindly, for the old man could guess how\r\nhungry the lad was. "But, first, where do you suppose the crickets and\r\nkatydids have their ears?"\r\n\r\n"Near those big eyes," called Peter.\r\n\r\n"No, no, on the joint of the fore leg is a little membrane, which is\r\njust a thinner, tighter place in the skin of the leg. There!" Ben Gile\r\nhad the fore leg of Jack\'s cricket stretched under the magnifying-glass.\r\nThe children could see plainly the film of tight skin. "Underneath the\r\nthin, tight skin is a fine nerve which, when the air makes the skin\r\nshake, changes the motion into sound. Mrs. Cricket listens with her fore\r\nleg while Mr. Cricket sings his love-song to her."\r\n\r\nAt this the children laughed and laughed, and comical little Peter put\r\nup his leg as if listening.\r\n\r\n"Here, Pete, give me your box. Do you remember what I told you about\r\nMrs. Locust, Betty, and the way she lays her eggs?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir. She has four straight spines at the end of her body, and\r\nafter she has bored a hole with her body she guides the eggs in with the\r\nfour spines."\r\n\r\n"Good! Well, Mrs. Cricket wears at the end of her body a long spear. See\r\nthis cricket of Peter\'s. Now she bores her hole with this spear and\r\nthen guides her eggs carefully into the hole. Why, see here, Pete, what\r\nhave you got here?"\r\n\r\nThe children gazed eagerly over the old man\'s shoulder.\r\n\r\n"My, isn\'t it like velvet!" exclaimed Peter.\r\n\r\n"And isn\'t it brown!" added Hope.\r\n\r\n"But look at its stumpy front legs!" called Jack, who had forgotten his\r\nempty stomach in the excitement about this little creature, which looked\r\nlike a cricket and yet was so different.\r\n\r\n"And its little beads of eyes!" said Betty.\r\n\r\n"Do you know what it is?" No one knew. "Well, it\'s a mole cricket. You\r\nrarely ever see one because they live underground and bore their way\r\nalong just like moles, leaving tiny tracks and nibbling the roots of\r\ntender plants. You see, it doesn\'t need eyes any more than the mole\r\ndoes. But it does need those thickened fore legs to do its underground\r\ndigging. Now, children, run out into the fields and let your crickets\r\ngo. Be careful not to hurt them. We\'ll have supper, and after supper\r\nwe\'ll catch a katydid."\r\n\r\nOut ran the children. Soon they were setting the long wooden tables\r\nunder the trees with delicious trout the boys had caught, with hot\r\nbiscuits and jugs of maple syrup, with berries and cookies, with milk\r\nfrom the old cow, who, contentedly chewing her cud, was looking at them\r\nthrough the low crotch of a tree, and with little cakes of maple sugar\r\nwhich the guide had moulded into the shape of hearts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nHOW KATY DID\r\n\r\n\r\nNever did trout, cookies, and maple sugar disappear so quickly; never\r\nwere such appetites; never such laughing, and such interesting stories\r\ntold by the guide.\r\n\r\n"Hush!" said Ben Gile. "Do you hear that?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," cried Peter.\r\n\r\n"What is it?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s a katydid," said Betty, "over there."\r\n\r\n"Listen, children, what does it say?"\r\n\r\n"It says, \'Chic-a-chee, chic-a-chee,\' over and over again," answered\r\nJack.\r\n\r\n"Pooh," interrupted Jimmie, "it says, \'Katy did, Katy didn\'t!\'"\r\n\r\n"It says, \'Katy broke a china plate; yes, she did; no, she didn\'t,\'"\r\ncalled Betty.\r\n\r\n"Yes, she did; no, she didn\'t!" the children shouted, merrily, together.\r\n\r\n"Well," said the old man, "anyway, it\'s all about what Katy did do and\r\nwhat Katy didn\'t do. Probably Mr. Katy, like other good husbands in the\r\nworld, is singing of the wonderful things Katy did do and the naughty\r\nthings she didn\'t do. That is Mr. Katy\'s love-song. Ah, he finds Mrs.\r\nKaty very charming--her beautiful wings, her gracefully waving antenn\xc3\xa6,\r\nher knowing, shining eyes! Now, listen again. Katydid carries its\r\nmusical instrument at the base of its wing cover. On each side is a tiny\r\nmembrane and a strong vein. When the wing covers are rubbed together the\r\nmembrane speaks, and you hear--"\r\n\r\n"Katy did, Katy didn\'t!" shouted the children.\r\n\r\n"Do you think you know where they are? Well, take these lanterns"--the\r\nguide had lighted half a dozen--"and find them."\r\n\r\nThe children scurried off, certain of a quick victory. In the woods\r\nabout the cabin you could hear them shouting: "It\'s here!" "No, it\r\nisn\'t!" "Where is it?"\r\n\r\n"A will-o\'-the-wisp," murmured the old man; "may they never have a\r\nharder one to find!"\r\n\r\nBy-and-by the children came trotting back. They couldn\'t find the\r\nkatydid in any place, and they had looked everywhere.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n_A._ Eggs of the katydid.\r\n_B._ A katydid.\r\n_C._ Leg, showing katydid\'s ear.\r\n_D._ Musical instrument at base of wings.]\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t? How did you look?" He took one of the lanterns, went to a\r\nnear-by tree, and held the lantern close to the leaves. "Here it is!\r\nWhy, it\'s a great fellow!"\r\n\r\nThe children trooped into the cabin after him, crowding to look at the\r\nkatydid.\r\n\r\n"I thought they were brown," said Hope.\r\n\r\n"So did I," echoed Betty.\r\n\r\n"See, you can\'t tell this fellow from the leaf, it is such a bright,\r\nfresh green. Woe to the katydid if it were anything but this bright\r\ngreen! Just think how easily the birds would find them. What nice salad\r\nKaty would make for a young robin!"\r\n\r\n"Do the birds eat katydids?" asked the children, in surprise.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, and they haven\'t any stated luncheon or supper time for doing\r\nit. They are very informal. One time is as good as another, and the\r\noftener the merrier. If Katy doesn\'t keep very quiet and demure, like\r\nher leafy background, whist! and Father Robin or Mother Bluebird has a\r\nmeal for the youngsters."\r\n\r\n"Is that why it doesn\'t sing by day?" asked Peter.\r\n\r\n"They wait till the birds go to bed, I suppose. See what a comical look\r\nthis fellow has, waving its long, fine, silky antenn\xc3\xa6 about. Probably\r\nit\'s trying to find out what it is on, looking out for another nice\r\ngreen leaf to eat. They do a lot of damage eating leaves from the\r\ntrees."\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?" asked Betty, pointing to the edge of a leaf.\r\n\r\n"Well, you have sharp eyes," said the old man. "Mrs. Katydid has laid\r\nher eggs there. See, the eggs are rounded and flattened, and each egg\r\nlaps a little over the one in front of it. Once another man saw a row of\r\nkatydid eggs laid as neatly as could be on the edge of a clean linen\r\ncollar. I\'ll keep these eggs; then, in the spring, the young ones will\r\nhatch out. They will grow and shed their skins from time to time, just\r\nthe way the locusts do. Ah, they leave so many old clothes about that\r\nthey need an old clothes man! I wish I could tell you about the katydid\r\nI knew once upon a time who spent her days collecting old clothes, and\r\nhow she made a fortune selling them to--"\r\n\r\nBen Gile paused and sighed deeply.\r\n\r\n"Selling them to what?" shouted the children.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t tell that to you," replied the old man, shaking his head sadly.\r\n"It\'s the story of \'How Katy Did.\' I have to be very careful, for Mr.\r\nJohn Burroughs, who is a wiser old man than I am, says I mustn\'t. Lately\r\nthe scientists almost killed one man I know, and a good, clever, useful\r\nman, for telling that story--very savage, very savage."\r\n\r\nThe children began to look troubled. "Will Mr. Burroughs hurt us?"\r\ninquired Hope. "My papa would--"\r\n\r\n"No, no, child, you\'re too small. He likes something big, and he\'s\r\nespecially fond of the Big Stick."\r\n\r\n"Is that what he does his beating with?" Jack\'s eyes were frightened.\r\n\r\n"He hunts with the Big Stick," answered the guide. "Dear me, where are\r\nwe? It\'s half-past eight, and you children should have been in bed this\r\ntime long, long ago. Hurry! Skip! Get the lanterns or we\'ll all be\r\nscolded."\r\n\r\nAnd they scampered for the village, the guide driving them before him,\r\nand all the lights waving to and fro like so many crazy fireflies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nFISHING\r\n\r\n\r\nHave you ever started off on a bright, cool morning to fish? At the last\r\nit seems as if you would never get started, which, I suppose, is partly\r\nthe eagerness to be gone; then you do get off, only to find you\'ve\r\nforgot the can of worms or the salt for the luncheon-basket.\r\n\r\nJimmie and Betty were prancing on the lawn in front of Turtle Lodge.\r\nJimmie had his camera over his back and a jointed steel rod done up in a\r\nneat little case in his hands, on his feet long rubber boots. Betty wore\r\na big straw hat; she carried a little rod like Jim\'s and a pretty little\r\nknapsack, which held part of the luncheon. They were waiting for Jack\r\nand Ben Gile, who were to go with them to fish a stream that lay far\r\nback from the pond. It was to be a great day\'s sport. They had a creel\r\nand a rod for Jack; for the guide they needed to take nothing, for he\r\nhad the most wonderful collection of rods and flies they had ever seen.\r\n\r\nAt last they saw him coming up the hill, Jack with him. Hastily they\r\nkissed Mrs. Reece, and ran shouting and jumping toward the old man and\r\nthe boy, Lizzie after them, for they had left half the luncheon on the\r\ngrass. "Faith!" she panted, catching up with them, "and what can you be\r\ndoing without the victuals, I\'d like to know?"\r\n\r\nThe guide took part of the bundles and Jack the rest. Off they went\r\ngayly talking and laughing.\r\n\r\nSoon they were following the stream, Jack catching his line and fly in\r\nthe alders almost every time he cast.\r\n\r\nJack was too poor ever to have had any rod except an alder stick cut\r\nbeside the stream, a short line and hook, and any worm or grasshopper he\r\nmight find. He was wonderfully proud of the rod he held. The children\r\nmeant to give it to him at the end of the summer. But Jack did not know\r\nthis good news yet.\r\n\r\nBen Gile led the way, and almost every time he cast his fly there was a\r\nswirl, the end of the slender rod bent, there was a minute of\r\nexcitement, and then upon the bank lay a beautiful speckled trout. On,\r\non, on they went over the cool, green leaves and bright red berries of\r\nthe partridge vine, and past raspberries wherever the sun had struck in\r\nthrough the heavy trees to ripen them. The stream was running more and\r\nmore swiftly as they travelled up grade; quick water was growing more\r\nfrequent and the pools deeper.\r\n\r\nAt last they came to a deep, round pool, and the guide said, "Now, Jim,\r\nyou\'ve the first try."\r\n\r\nJimmie cast his fly, there was a strike, a plunge, and out, out, out ran\r\nJimmie\'s line. The boy\'s face turned quite pale. "What shall I do, sir?"\r\n\r\n"You have a big one," answered Ben, calmly. "If you can play him long\r\nenough we may get him; otherwise he\'ll get your fly and line. Steady\r\nthere, steady; let out a little more line, and now reel in a bit."\r\n\r\nIt seemed like hours to Jimmie as he let the line out and reeled it in\r\nagain. Really, it was only a few minutes before the guide said: "Seems\r\nto be getting a little tired; bring him in closer. That\'s it. There!"\r\n\r\nThey had no landing-net with them, so at the last moment Ben Gile seized\r\nthe line, and out came a two-pound trout. Jimmie\'s eyes were popping\r\nnearly out of his head, and Betty was jumping about and clapping her\r\nhands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n_A._ Front view of dragon-fly nymph.\r\n_B._ Top view of damsel-fly nymph.\r\n_C._ Adult dragon-fly.]\r\n\r\n"Tired?" asked the old man.\r\n\r\n"Some," said the boy.\r\n\r\n"Well, this is the best place we shall find to eat our luncheon. We\'ll\r\ncamp here. Now for the fire! Boys, get the wood and a small strip of\r\nbirch bark! Then these two stones will hold the frying-pan. Now for the\r\nfish; we\'ll keep that big one of yours and I\'ll mount it for you, if\r\nyou\'d like me to. We\'ll eat the little fellows. After luncheon we must\r\ncatch more for your mother, Betty, and for Jack to take home with him."\r\n\r\nSoon the frying-pan was hot, and the trout were sizzling and curling up\r\nwith the bacon in the pan. Never did a luncheon taste so good as that,\r\nwith fried trout and bacon, and hard-boiled eggs, soda biscuits, and a\r\nmammoth apple pie. They listened to the fire crackling; they looked up\r\ninto the shining trees; they watched the water beyond the pool go\r\ntumbling downhill.\r\n\r\nFinally the old man said, "It\'s going to be a clear day to-morrow."\r\n\r\nThe children gazed up into the sky.\r\n\r\nAt this Ben Gile laughed. "Don\'t look at the sky, look at your plates."\r\n\r\nPuzzled by this, the children did look at their plates.\r\n\r\n"But there\'s nothing left to look at," said Jack.\r\n\r\n"That\'s just it. There\'s an old saying that people who eat all their\r\nfood make a clear day for the morrow. Now," he continued, "I\'ll smoke my\r\npipe of peace before we go on. Just look at that fellow darting about\r\nover the pool!"\r\n\r\n"Oh!" cried Betty, "it\'s a darning-needle, and it will sew up my mouth\r\nand my eyes--oh, oh!"\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, child, that\'s silly. The dragon-fly is a very useful and a\r\nvery harmless fellow. It\'s a pity that there are so many superstitions\r\nabout it."\r\n\r\n"There\'s another name for it," said Jack--"devil\'s darning-needle."\r\n\r\n"And in the South the darkies call it the mule-killer, and believe it\r\nhas power to bring snakes to life. It\'s all nonsense. They are not only\r\nharmless to human beings but also very useful, for they eat flies and\r\nmosquitoes at a great rate. Once upon a time I fed a dragon-fly forty\r\nhouse flies in two hours. And they eat beetles and spiders and\r\ncentipedes. And sometimes they eat one another."\r\n\r\n"Like the crickets?" said Betty.\r\n\r\n"Yes, like the crickets. Just see that fellow dart about. The sharpest\r\nsort of angles. There, it has something! It caught that lace-wing in its\r\nleg-basket."\r\n\r\n"Leg-basket!" exclaimed the children.\r\n\r\n"Yes; it draws its six legs together, and makes a sort of basket right\r\nunder its head. Then the dragon-fly devours what it catches by these\r\nstrong-toothed jaws. It is a hungry fellow, it is."\r\n\r\nThe old man puffed away quietly for a few minutes, while the children\r\nwatched the darning-needle and hoped Ben Gile would say something soon.\r\n\r\n"Those scientists," he continued, "who are working on flying-machines\r\ncould learn a good deal from this fellow. The dragon-fly is made for\r\nflight. A long, slender, tapering body that cuts the air, moved by four\r\nnarrow, gauzy wings, and steered by that pointed abdomen. They eat,\r\nmate, and lay their eggs while they are flying. I don\'t know that they\r\nare still for more than a few seconds."\r\n\r\n"Can you find their eggs?" asked Betty.\r\n\r\n"Yes; their eggs are laid in the water or fastened to the stems of water\r\nplants. See that damsel fly, the slender, smaller, pretty-colored\r\ndarning-needle? Well, it goes entirely under water, cuts a slit in the\r\nstem with the sharp end of the abdomen, and lays the eggs in the groove\r\nit has made. And they lay thousands of eggs."\r\n\r\n"When they hatch out, what do they look like?" asked Jack, who grew\r\ndaily more interested in the creatures about him, and who, in the years\r\nto come, was destined to be a great scientist.\r\n\r\n"It looks a little like the mother," said Ben Gile, taking out his pipe,\r\n"but not much. It goes through a great many changes before it is really\r\ngrown up. All told, the growth takes from a few months to a whole year.\r\nThe young one, called a nymph, is an ugly little fellow, dingy black\r\nwith six sprawling legs, two staring eyes, and a big lower lip which\r\ncovers up its cruel face like a mask. It is a true ogre, lurking under\r\nstones and in rubbish at the bottom of the pond seeking whom it may\r\ndevour. It eats the smaller and weaker nymphs."\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Betty, studying the picture the guide had drawn, "what an\r\nugly, ugly fellow!"\r\n\r\n"It changes its skin a good many times, and sometimes it looks a little\r\nbetter while the skin is still clean and light gray. But it soon turns\r\ndingy again. See these three little leaf-shaped gills I\'ve drawn?"\r\n\r\n"They are like the screw on a steamer," commented Jimmie.\r\n\r\n"They are, a little. Well, this chap uses these gills for the same\r\npurpose as the steamer uses its screw--to scull through the water."\r\n\r\n"What happens when it changes?" asked Jack.\r\n\r\n"After the nymph has its full growth, some sunny morning soon after\r\ndaylight, it makes its way up out of the water on to a stem and waits\r\nquietly for the old dark skin to split. Then out crawls a soft-skinned\r\ncreature with gauzy wings. But the body is so moist and weak it has to\r\nwait awhile for the warm sunshine to harden the skin and strengthen the\r\nmuscle. When this is done the new dragon-fly, with its glistening body,\r\nflies out from the pond in the bright, warm light."\r\n\r\n"Then does it live forever?" asked Betty.\r\n\r\n"No; it dies after twenty-five to forty-five days of its flight. Here,\r\nJack, catch that fellow!"\r\n\r\nThere was a wild scramble, but every time Jack just missed the\r\ndragon-fly. Finally Betty lent him her broad hat, and at last Jack\r\ncaught the insect.\r\n\r\n"Gee! aren\'t its eyes big?"\r\n\r\n"And beautiful, too," said the guide. "They are made up of thousands of\r\nfacets (a facet is just a small, plain surface) as many as thirty\r\nthousand facets in one eye. Some look up, some look down, some look out,\r\nsome look in; so that there is nothing that escapes the sight of this\r\nhawk of the air. Look at the wings on this fellow, and look at the\r\npicture I drew for you of the nymph. Well, this fellow\'s wings begin in\r\nthe nymph as tiny sacs, or pads, made by the pushing out of the wall of\r\nthe body. Running all through between the two layers of the wing are\r\nthickened lines of chitin, which divide and subdivide, forming this fine\r\nnetwork. In the new wing, protected by these thickenings, are air-tubes,\r\nwhich divide and branch into all parts of the wing. But as the wing\r\nreaches its full growth most of the air-tubes die." The guide paused.\r\n"We are talking too much and fishing too little. Time to go on. Put out\r\nthe fire, boys. Be sure that it\'s out. Run water all around it. Now\r\nwe\'re off!" And up, up, up the brook they went.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nTHE SWIMMING-POOL\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo or three days after the fishing expedition the boys had gathered\r\ntogether at the swimming-pool, Ben Gile with them. They had been racing,\r\nand climbing trees, and were very warm. "Come, boys," said the guide,\r\n"let\'s sit down a minute before you go into the water. It won\'t do to\r\nbathe when you\'re too warm. Look round on the stones under the water and\r\nsee what you can find."\r\n\r\n"Look at this," called Peter; "it\'s just like a sponge."\r\n\r\n"It is a fresh-water sponge."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t suppose sponges grew in these parts at all," said Jimmie.\r\n\r\n"Oh yes, there are many of them in the ponds."\r\n\r\n"See this, sir," shouted Jack; "what funny little legs it has!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s a May-fly or shad-fly nymph. He was hiding carefully under that\r\nstone and keeping out of the way of the dragon-fly nymph, who would so\r\ngladly gobble him up."\r\n\r\n"It\'s prettier," said Jimmie, "than that dragon-fly nymph you drew a\r\npicture of."\r\n\r\n"So it is. See, here on each side of its body are these fine little\r\ngill-plates, moving, moving, moving, so that they may get as much fresh\r\nair as possible out of the water. Each gill-plate is a tiny sac, and\r\nwithin these are the fine branches of the air-tubes. It\'s wonderful the\r\nway these creatures breathe."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t they breathe just the way we do?" asked Jack.\r\n\r\n"No; throughout the body of an insect is a system of tiny white tubes.\r\nSome day we\'ll look at these tubes under the microscope, and you will\r\nsee that they are made up of rings. From end to end of the tube is a\r\nfine thread of chitin twisted in a close spiral like a spring. It is\r\nthese little coils which look like rings. The coiled thread holds the\r\nlittle tube open so that the air may pass readily. But your little\r\nfellow, Jack, cannot have pores on the sides of the body like the last\r\nnymph. It lives under water, and the water would get into its tubes;\r\ninstead, it has tracheal gills."\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n_A._ May-fly.\r\n_B._ Nymph of May-fly.]\r\n\r\n"That\'s a pretty big word," said Peter, looking up at the guide. He was\r\ngrowing impatient, and wished to begin the swim. If he had known what\r\nthat swim was to mean to him, probably he would not have been so\r\nanxious.\r\n\r\n"They aren\'t so hard to understand; they are just little oval sacs,\r\ninside of which is a limb of the air tube divided into tiny branches.\r\nThe fresh air in the water passes through the thin wall of the gill and\r\nis taken by the air-tubes to all parts of the body, while the impure air\r\npasses out in the water. This is all that breathing means in any\r\ncreature--a changing of impure for pure air."\r\n\r\n"Then that is what my nymph is doing," asked Jack, "when it wiggles its\r\ngills so?"\r\n\r\n"Just that. Your May-fly nymph, Jack, hatched from a tiny egg first. But\r\nit grows rapidly, and splits and sheds its skin sometimes as often as\r\ntwenty times. During the last few months wings appear, which grow a\r\nlittle larger with each shedding of the skin. Finally, after three\r\nyears--sometimes three years spent in growing and hiding away from its\r\nenemies--the little nymph floats up to the surface of the water. In a\r\nfew minutes the old skin splits along the back, and from it flies forth\r\na frail little May-fly. Its body is very soft and delicate. Its four\r\nwings are of a gauzy texture. At the tip of the body are two long, fine\r\nhairs. Its jaws are small and weak, but the life of this little creature\r\nis so short that it never eats. Up it flies into the air with thousands\r\nof its brothers and sisters, whirls in a mad dance for a few hours, then\r\nfalls exhausted to the ground to die.\r\n\r\n"Well, now I think we\'d better go into the water," ended the guide. "You\r\nboys can go in just as you are." For three little boys had been sitting\r\nundressed in the bright sunshine. "Good for their pores," Ben Gile had\r\ntold them, which is all very true.\r\n\r\nSoon there was the greatest splashing and paddling and shouts of, "My\r\ngoodness, isn\'t the water cold!" "Can you swim this way?" "How far can\r\nyou go, anyway?"\r\n\r\nJimmie and the guide were swimming around near the shore when suddenly,\r\ntwo hundred feet ahead of them, they saw Peter disappear in what they\r\nsupposed was shallow water. Jack was half-way the distance between the\r\nguide and Peter. It did not take him an instant to realize what had\r\nhappened. But before he could get to the place where Peter had gone\r\ndown, the lad had come up, struggled, and gone down again. As he came\r\nup once more Jack caught him by his curly hair, turned over on his back,\r\nholding Peter\'s head high out of the water, and swam calmly for the\r\nshallow place. Once there, the old man took Peter in his arms and\r\nhurried to shore, where they rolled him until they had the water out of\r\nhim. Not a word was said, and modest, quiet Jack did not seem to think\r\nthat he had been brave.\r\n\r\nWhen Peter opened his eyes he said, "Guess my pores weren\'t in the right\r\nplace."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII\r\n\r\nTHE RAINY DAY\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a rainy day. Poor Betty flattened her little nose against the\r\nwindow-panes of Turtle Lodge a dozen times. But outside all she could\r\nsee were just the long, straight lines of the down-coming rain and an\r\nempty road leading downhill to the edge of the pond; all she could hear\r\nwas the drum of the water upon the roof. Inside, Jimmie was developing\r\nfilms in his laboratory, and was not in the least interested in what\r\nBetty might be doing.\r\n\r\n"Oh, mother," called Betty, "I am so tired; there isn\'t anything to do!"\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you sew on a dress for Belinda?" asked Mrs. Reece.\r\n\r\n"Belinda has too many clothes; she has more than I have, mother, and\r\nshe\'s a naughty dolly to-day."\r\n\r\n"Well, let me see--get Lizzie to let you make cake."\r\n\r\n"Lizzie\'s cross, and I\'m afraid to. I wish the guide were here. He\'s\r\nnever cross, and never too busy to tell you something that\'s\r\ninteresting." Betty looked out of the window. "He\'s coming now! Goody!\r\nGoody!"\r\n\r\nWhen old Ben Gile reached the steps there was a little girl dancing\r\ninside the door and still shouting "Goody!"\r\n\r\n"What\'s this?"\r\n\r\n"You\'ll tell me a story, won\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Tell you a story! Dear, dear, I never knew such a little greedy for\r\nstories. I\'ve brought you something."\r\n\r\nBetty\'s face was shining now. She had forgotten the rain, the dreary\r\nday, cross Lizzie, and everything. Ben Gile took a box out of his\r\npocket. "What is it?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"I have a box full of little elves for you."\r\n\r\n"Elves!" exclaimed Betty.\r\n\r\n"Yes, little elves, little brownies."\r\n\r\n"Come into the study, where there is a fire." Mrs. Reece led the way.\r\n"Then you can tell us all about these elves." They sat down around the\r\nfire, and Mrs. Reece continued, "Don\'t you think it would be fun to pop\r\ncorn while we\'re hearing about the brownies?"\r\n\r\nBetty was delighted, and ran for a corn-popper, and soon there was the\r\nmerry sound of crackling wood, popping corn, and happy voices--all\r\nsounds that proved so tempting that before long Jimmie joined the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n"My little elf is a bug," began the hermit.\r\n\r\n"A _bug_ an elf?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, a bug; and when he doesn\'t look like an elf, he looks like a king\r\nwith a high crown on his head or a naughty boy with a dunce cap."\r\n\r\n"Let\'s see him, please," said Betty.\r\n\r\nThe old man opened his box. Inside lay a lot of little creatures with\r\nbacks like beechnuts. "See, look through the lens!"\r\n\r\nBetty laughed. "Oh, aren\'t they funny! The eyes are so big and so far\r\napart."\r\n\r\n"And the lines on their heads make them look as if they were gazing\r\nthrough heavy-bowed spectacles," said Mrs. Reece.\r\n\r\n"There is a very wise man, and his name is Mr. Comstock, who says that\r\nNature must have been in a joking mood when she made these little tree\r\nand leaf hoppers, they are so impish and knowing-looking. Ah, they are\r\nthe naughty brownies of the insect world!"\r\n\r\n"Betty, Betty," called Mrs. Reece, "your popcorn is burning!"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tree and Leaf Hoppers]\r\n\r\n"Mother, I don\'t care to pop any more; let me just listen now. What\r\nmakes them bad?"\r\n\r\n"Well, they are born with a naughty desire to suck everything they can\r\nget their tiny sucking beaks upon. They hop around in great numbers on\r\nthe fruit trees and pierce the leaves with their sharp beaks. Then, with\r\na tubelike lower lip, they suck up the sap. They also make slits in the\r\ntwigs in which to lay their eggs. In the following spring the eggs\r\nhatch, and there is a fresh supply of tree-hoppers ready to begin the\r\nmischief their parents left off only when they died."\r\n\r\n"And what is the difference between the leaf-hoppers and the\r\ntree-hoppers?" asked Mr. Reece.\r\n\r\n"Not much. They are cousins--cousins in naughtiness. The leaf-hoppers\r\nare a great nuisance. Every year they destroy from one-fourth to\r\none-fifth of the grass that springs up. They also suck the sap of the\r\nrose, the grape-vine, and of many grains. These sturdy fellows live\r\nduring the winter by hiding under the rubbish in the fields and\r\nvineyards, ready when the warm spring does come to begin their naughty\r\nwork."\r\n\r\n"What makes a little fellow like this able to do so much damage?" asked\r\nJimmie, who had come in, his hands all stained with chemicals.\r\n\r\n"Well, it is well covered by this horny substance called chitin, and\r\nthen it is very active. You see, the chitin acts both as armor-plate for\r\nthe soft parts and also as a firm support to the many muscles. As many\r\nas two thousand separate, tiny muscles have been counted in a certain\r\ncaterpillar. That shows how very active insects are."\r\n\r\n"And they all have such big eyes they can see everything," said Betty.\r\n\r\n"So they have--bigger eyes than the old wolf of the story had."\r\n\r\n"You remember, I told you about the thousands of facets in the big eyes\r\nof the darning-needle? Not contented with these large eyes, most insects\r\nhave three small eyes arranged in the form of a triangle on the front of\r\nthe head."\r\n\r\n"This bug has feelers, too," said Jimmie.\r\n\r\n"So it has. Insects use these feelers, or antenn\xc3\xa6, for all sorts of\r\npurposes--some for touch, some for smell, some for hearing. Ants\r\nexchange greetings by touching antenn\xc3\xa6, and recognize a friend or an\r\nenemy by the odor. The antenn\xc3\xa6 of a male mosquito are covered with fine\r\nhairs. When Mrs. Mosquito sings, all the tiny hairs on Mr. Mosquito\'s\r\nfeelers are set in motion, and he becomes aware of Mrs. Mosquito."\r\n\r\nMrs. Reece laughed. "That\'s a new kind of romance!"\r\n\r\n"Mother, what\'s a romance?" asked Betty.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll know, dear, in time."\r\n\r\n"Notice this imp\'s mouth," said the guide. "It\'s made for sucking. But\r\nthere\'s a great difference in the mouths of insects: some are made for\r\nbiting, some for lapping, some for piercing, and some for sucking. The\r\nbutterfly, which lives on nectar in the depths of the flowers, has a\r\nlong, coiled tube which scientists call a proboscis. This it unrolls and\r\nburies in the throat of the flower. Mrs. Mosquito has a file and pump,\r\nfor it is she, and not her husband, who does all the singing and biting.\r\nThe male mosquito has nothing more than a mouth for sucking nectar. And\r\nI told you about the biting jaws of the locust with which it nibbles\r\ngrass and leaves."\r\n\r\n"And does the tree-hopper breathe the way the locust does--through those\r\npores on the side?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, child," said the old man, "and the air-pores are protected by fine\r\nhairs which surround the openings, just the way the hairs in your\r\nnostrils keep the dust from getting up your nose and into your throat."\r\n\r\n"Things in the bugs," said Betty, "are so like us."\r\n\r\n"The world becomes more and more like one great whole as you grow\r\nolder," added Ben Gile. "Those are interesting elves I\'ve been telling\r\nyou about, aren\'t they?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t know bug elves could be so interesting."\r\n\r\n"Now run and get us some of the fresh cake Lizzie has been baking," said\r\nMrs. Reece. "I hope it will taste as good as it smells."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX\r\n\r\nTHE PRIZE\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were two canoes going up the little river which led out from the\r\npond. In the first were Ben Gile with Betty, Hope, and Jack. In the\r\nsecond Jimmie and Peter paddled Mrs. Reece. They had trout rods,\r\nalthough they did not plan to fish very much, and well-filled\r\nluncheon-baskets, magnifying-glasses, cameras, boxes, and various other\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nIn two weeks they were to go on a camping expedition, and to-day\'s trip\r\nwas taken chiefly to find a good place for the first night\'s stop.\r\n\r\nThe children were all excitement about the camping, which was to be the\r\nlast jollity of their happy summer, and they asked so many questions\r\nabout what they were to take with them, and they asked the same\r\nquestions over so many times, that at last Mrs. Reece put her hands on\r\nher ears and called to the guide, who was paddling vigorously ahead.\r\n\r\n"Well," he called back, "a frying-pan and an axe, and perhaps a tent."\r\nHe allowed his canoe to drop nearer Mrs. Reece\'s. "What naughty children\r\nyou are," he continued, "to bother the life out of your poor mother! I\r\nknow of some other children, too, who are very naughty. I see one flying\r\nnow."\r\n\r\n"That pretty little thing," exclaimed Betty, "with the gauzy wings?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, that pretty little thing; its wings have many, many veins. When\r\nLace-Wing is a baby and is called a larva, it does not look like this,\r\nfor its jaws are strong and very sharp. After it has eaten and grown for\r\nsome time it makes a house for itself, where it rolls up for a nap.\r\nWhile it is lying very still in this little house many things are\r\nhappening."\r\n\r\n"What happens?" asked Jack.\r\n\r\n"Well, it is changing from a baby to a grown-up, and while it is growing\r\nup into an insect it is called a pupa. Don\'t mistake this for papa--it\r\ndoes not look like your papa at all."\r\n\r\nBetty thought this was very funny, because her father was a great big\r\nman over six feet tall.\r\n\r\n"After its wings are made and it looks just like its mamma, Lace-Wing\r\ncrawls out of its house and flies away."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pit of the Ant-Lion]\r\n\r\n"Has it any cousins, like the locust?" asked Betty.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it has cousins; the ant-lion and caddis-fly both belong to this\r\nfamily. But little Lace-Wing, with its beautiful green body, gauzy\r\nwings, and golden eyes, is the most graceful member of the family."\r\n\r\n"How do they live when they are babies?" asked Hope.\r\n\r\n"When they are babies," said Ben Gile, opening his eyes wide and\r\nspeaking in a loud, deep voice, "they go about like lions seeking whom\r\nthey may devour."\r\n\r\nBetty was frightened.\r\n\r\n"No, no, child," said Mrs. Reece, "not a real lion."\r\n\r\n"Just an aphis-lion," explained the guide, his eyes twinkling. "They are\r\ncalled aphis-lions because they are very cruel to the little green\r\nplant-lice I told you about. You remember, the plant-lice live on\r\nplants, and with their sucking beaks pump the sap from the plants. The\r\naphis-lions crawling over the plants come across the little aphid. Quick\r\nas a wink they stick their sharp claws in the soft body of the\r\nplant-louse and drink the blood with their sharp-pointed jaws. They are\r\nvery fond of eggs, too, and Mamma Lace-Wing is careful of her eggs,\r\nbecause she knows the mischievous ways of her children."\r\n\r\n"What does Mamma Lace-Wing do with her eggs?" inquired Mrs. Reece.\r\n\r\n"Each egg which she lays has a tiny stem, and the stems are fastened to\r\na leaf or twig. When the babies hatch out they crawl down onto the leaf\r\nand hunt around for something to eat. Perhaps if they knew more they\r\nwould crawl up the little egg stems and eat their own brothers and\r\nsisters."\r\n\r\n"Oh, what cannibals!" cried Betty.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is not pleasant, this Fiji Island of the insects, but it is\r\ntheir nature."\r\n\r\n"They do seek their meat from God," murmured Mrs. Reece.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is a mystery," answered the old man. "But, dear me, I have\r\nforgotten my story. Well, in about ten days they find a nicely sheltered\r\nspot and spin a little silken cocoon about themselves. In this they stay\r\nfor a couple of weeks, while they are changing into grown-up lace-wings.\r\nWhen they are finished they cut a round door in their silken house,\r\nspread their gauzy wings, stretch their delicate green bodies, rub their\r\neyes in wonder at the sunny world, and fly away to lay some little eggs\r\non slender stems just like those which their mothers laid and from\r\nwhich they came."\r\n\r\n"See," said Jimmie, "what a place for camping!"\r\n\r\n"But it is too near home," objected Peter. "We could get here in two\r\nhours."\r\n\r\n"So we could," admitted Jimmie.\r\n\r\n"Tell us something about the cousins, sir," said Jack.\r\n\r\n"We can\'t have much more now," replied the guide, "for we shall have to\r\nstop for luncheon soon. But I\'ll tell you about a little fellow called\r\nthe ant-lion. Along the side of almost any country path or road, if you\r\nkeep your eyes open, you may notice some day little pits of sand with\r\nsloping sides, and down at the bottom of this is a hole. The hole is\r\nvery dark, and unless you look sharply you will think it just a hole.\r\nBut if you examine it you will see a little head and two little sharp,\r\ncurved jaws. These are the jaws of the ant-lion, lying in wait to gobble\r\nup the first passer-by. The rest of the body is in a little tunnel\r\nburrowed out in the sand. They get their name, I suppose, because they\r\nthink an ant an excellent dinner. They lie there knowing very well that\r\nMr. and Mrs. Ant will surely slip on the steep-sloping sides. And if by\r\nany chance they don\'t, these ant-lions have been seen to throw up sand\r\nwith their heads in order to hit a helpless little ant and knock it down\r\ninto the pit."\r\n\r\nThe children exclaimed at this cleverness.\r\n\r\n"After it has eaten its fill, this cruel, greedy fellow makes a little\r\nroom for itself of fine grains of sand firmly held together with silky\r\nfibres. In this room it lies quietly, sometimes all winter, until it\r\nchanges into a grown-up ant-lion with four long, narrow wings. Then Mrs.\r\nAnt-Lion lays her eggs in the sand, and when the young ones hatch out\r\nthey build the \'pits of destruction\' which I told you about. What book\r\nis it, children, that uses the \'pit of destruction\' so often as a\r\nfigure?"\r\n\r\n"The Bible!" shouted Peter, who was the minister\'s son in Rangeley\r\nVillage.\r\n\r\n"Good! Now, no more for the present, and here we are at a splendid place\r\nfor luncheon--clear spring, dry ground, handy wood, and all."\r\n\r\nThe canoe beached noiselessly on the river\'s edge, the boys jumped out\r\nwith a whoop, and soon luncheon and frying-pans were out of the canoes,\r\nand there was the sound of the axe chopping the dry wood, the good smell\r\nof smoke, and the sizzling of bacon. Betty and Hope went for water. The\r\nboys fetched wood. Mrs. Reece and the guide took care of the luncheon,\r\nMrs. Reece spreading the table on the ground, and the guide frying the\r\npotatoes and bacon.\r\n\r\n"Oh, mother," said Jimmie, "what does make things taste so good\r\nout-of-doors?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"And, mother," asked Betty, "what does make everything so pretty?"\r\n\r\n"You ask mother a hard question."\r\n\r\n"And oh, Mrs. Reece," exclaimed Jack, his thin, eager face shining with\r\nexcitement, "everything in the world is so wonderful!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s all so different in the winter," said Peter, in between bites of\r\nbread-and-butter. "It isn\'t half so nice, but I suppose it would be\r\nlovely if we could have you and Mr. Gile--"\r\n\r\n"You dear child!"\r\n\r\n"It is about three miles above here," the guide spoke, "on the last of\r\nthe Dead River Ponds, where we shall find our first camping ground. I\r\nwant you to look at it."\r\n\r\n"And we\'ll be gone days and days."\r\n\r\n"Goody! goody!" called Betty, clapping her hands. "And we\'ll sleep\r\nout-of-doors, cook out-of-doors, and do everything out-of-doors."\r\n\r\nEvery one smiled with her, for there was not a person there who was not\r\nlooking forward with happiness to this trip.\r\n\r\n"Before we start on I\'ll smoke my pipe," said the old man.\r\n\r\n"Then, please, sir, won\'t you tell us something else?" asked Betty.\r\n\r\n"Why, I have nothing left in my head, you child."\r\n\r\n"Oh, please, sir, you said there was another cousin called the\r\ncaddis-worm."\r\n\r\n"So I did," said the old man. "Fetch me that stone, Jack." He pointed to\r\na stone lying in the water. Jack brought it to him, and he broke\r\nsomething off from it. "What\'s that?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s a stick," answered Betty.\r\n\r\n"No, that\'s not a stick, that\'s a caddis-worm. This little fellow,\r\nunlike some spoiled children I know, has to find its own dinner, change\r\nits own clothes, tuck itself into bed, and build its own house. And it\r\nis brighter than some children I know," said the old man, looking kindly\r\nat Peter. "The caddis-worm builds itself different kinds of houses. Some\r\nof the houses are shaped like the horns you blow on the Fourth of July,\r\nand one kind of house is made of the finest sand, fastened together with\r\nbands of finest silk, which the caddis spins. Our caddis-worm has\r\npatience," said the old man, shaking his head and looking at\r\nJimmie--"patience, plenty of patience." He puffed away at his pipe for a\r\nfew seconds. "Some build rougher houses, choosing small pebbles instead\r\nof sand. Of these it builds a long tube. Others make a little green\r\nsummer cottage with twigs, grasses, and pine-needles, from which they\r\nbuild an attractive bungalow by laying down four pieces and crossing the\r\nends like this: # These cottages are built about an inch long, and in\r\nthem the young caddis-worms have a cool and cosey summer home. Often\r\nthese little houses have silken hangings inside. The little owners\r\nfasten the hooks at the ends of their bodies to these and moor\r\nthemselves securely."\r\n\r\n"What do you call it a worm for?" asked Mrs. Reece.\r\n\r\n"Well, it looks a little like a worm. It has a long, slender body, but\r\nit has six jointed legs, which real worms don\'t have. See this fellow!"\r\nBen Gile pulled the worm out of its case.\r\n\r\n"Oh, see! part of the body is so pale and soft!"\r\n\r\n"That, child, is because it is always covered by the little house. The\r\nfront end and the legs, however, are darker. That\'s sunburn, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"When young Master Caddis-Worm goes out for a swim or a walk it pushes\r\nits six legs out-of-doors, and walks along, carrying its house with it.\r\nVery convenient, you see! No doors to lock! And if it gets tired it does\r\nnot have to walk home; it just walks in and goes to sleep under a nice,\r\nsmooth stone. Some roam about and some stay at home. These creatures are\r\npretty much like human beings in their ways.\r\n\r\n"One of the young caddis-worms prefers fishing to walking, like some\r\nother young fellows I know. On a stone near its house it spins a fine\r\nweb, turned up-stream, so that any tender little insects floating\r\ndown-stream get lodged in it. An easy way to get your dinner--just to go\r\nto a net and eat."\r\n\r\nThe guide paused for a long time, clouds of smoke circling about his\r\nwhite beard and white hair. The children thought he would never go on.\r\n"I\'ve had something on my mind for days," he said, "and I\'ll speak of it\r\nnow. The boy or girl who learns most about the ants before September\r\n15th shall win a prize. This prize is to be a magnifying-glass, a book\r\nof colored plates of the insects, very beautiful and very big, and a\r\nfive-dollar gold piece."\r\n\r\n"A prize, a prize!" shouted the children, jumping madly about, while\r\nMrs. Reece and the guide smiled at each other.\r\n\r\n"Now we\'ve had our dinner, our rest, our pipe of peace, a plan for a\r\nprize, and we must push on for the camping-ground. Get the canoes\r\nready."\r\n\r\nAnd, with laughter and talking, the canoes were off up the river again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX\r\n\r\nA NAGGING FAMILY\r\n\r\n\r\n"Do you know of a family around here whom no one likes?" asked Ben Gile.\r\n\r\nThe lanterns were burning brightly out on the lawn of Turtle Lodge, and\r\nMrs. Reece had just stopped playing so that the children might rest from\r\ndancing. All the lanterns moved gently to and fro on the piazza; the\r\nchildren were running about, and everybody seemed to be having a\r\nbeautiful and breathless time. "Do you know of a family around here,"\r\ncalled the guide, "whom nobody likes?"\r\n\r\n"I do," replied Mrs. Reece, laughing and slapping the side of her face.\r\n"They are just like some people, nagging, annoying, and numerous."\r\n\r\n"Do any children here," called Ben Gile, for the third time, "know of a\r\nfamily nobody likes? For the child who guesses I have a pocket-knife."\r\n\r\n"The Smiths!" shouted Peter. "My father says Mrs. Smith is always\r\nquarrelling with the choir."\r\n\r\n"Hush!" said Mrs. Reece, seeing danger ahead. "Ben means a family right\r\nhere on the piazza."\r\n\r\nThe children looked at one another, and then Jack turned shrewdly to the\r\nguide. "I guess, sir, it is mosquitoes and flies."\r\n\r\n"Good boy, and here\'s the knife."\r\n\r\nJack thought he had never seen such a wonderful knife. It had three\r\nblades, a corkscrew, a file, and a pair of scissors, and to this day\r\nJack has that knife.\r\n\r\n"Come," said Mrs. Reece, "let us all sit down for a few minutes while\r\nLizzie is getting supper ready inside."\r\n\r\n"How many wings," asked Mrs. Reece, "has a fly?"\r\n\r\n"Four," answered Jimmie.\r\n\r\n"No," corrected the guide; "a real fly has only two wings. In the place\r\nof the second pair they have queer little knobbed rods which are called\r\nbalancers--something like the out-riggers on your scull, Jim. These\r\nsteer and steady the fly\'s body."\r\n\r\n"What makes a fly bite?" asked Hope.\r\n\r\n"They do not bite, child. A beetle or a grasshopper can really bite,\r\nbecause beetles and grasshoppers have heavy, horny jaws, toothed on the\r\nedge, with which to do it. But a fly has fine, sharp-pointed jaws. With\r\nthese needlelike jaws they pierce a hole in the skin, then with a tiny\r\nsucking-beak, made by the rolled lower lip, they draw up the blood\r\nthrough this opening."\r\n\r\n"I wonder whether any little girl here knows why flies should not be\r\nallowed in the house?" asked Mrs. Reece. No little girl did know\r\nanything except that their mothers were always driving flies out, and\r\nthat these creatures buzzed and were a nuisance. "Do tell them," said\r\nMrs. Reece.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n_A._ House-fly.\r\n_B._ A grown-up mosquito, two larv\xc3\xa6, and a pupa.]\r\n\r\n"Well," said the guide, "the fly is such a little acrobat it can crawl\r\nup the steepest and most slippery wall and walk upside down or right\r\nside up with the greatest ease. Perhaps some day you can make a fly keep\r\nstill long enough so that you can look at its foot. At the end of the\r\nfoot are two little round pads thickly covered with downy hair. On each\r\nside are two sharp claws and many stiff, clinging hairs. With this\r\nflattened foot it can go wherever it wishes.\r\n\r\n"But this same little foot is the chief reason why a fly should never be\r\nallowed in the house, for flies crawl into all sorts of dirty places,\r\nand the fine hairs catch and hold the dirt. When the fly lights on us\r\nor on the table, some of the pieces of dirt are shaken off."\r\n\r\n"But they are so hard to catch," said Betty; "it takes Lizzie forever\r\nand forever to get them out of the dining-room in the morning."\r\n\r\n"I know why they are hard to catch," added Jack, "for I\'ve looked at a\r\ndead fly. They have such big eyes, like lighthouses, they can see all\r\naround."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Ben Gile; "there is no such thing as creeping up on a fly\r\nunawares. Flies are dirty creatures," continued the old man, "and the\r\ntime is not very far distant when people will make war on them just as\r\nthey do on mosquitoes. Mrs. Fly lays her eggs in unclean places, and as\r\nmany as a hundred eggs at a time. These eggs hatch out quickly. It takes\r\nonly twenty-one days to make a chicken out of an egg, but to make a baby\r\nfly it takes only a few hours, and ugly babies they are--little white\r\nmaggots, or worms, that live and feed and grow rapidly in dirty places.\r\nWithin six days the maggot becomes a tiny, dark-brown pupa, and after\r\nfive days the pupa hatches out into a grown-up fly."\r\n\r\nA dozen little girls at the party made up their minds promptly that\r\nafter this evening they, at least, would make war on flies.\r\n\r\n"And aren\'t flies of any use?" asked Betty.\r\n\r\n"There is one little fly, Mrs. Tachina-Fly, who is of some use. She is a\r\ncousin of the house-fly. She is of use because she chooses a queer place\r\nto lay her eggs--on the back of a young caterpillar. After these\r\ncaterpillars grow and shut themselves up into a cocoon to change into a\r\nbutterfly the little fly eggs hatch out into maggots. Of course they are\r\nhungry--all babies are; and finding the nice, fat caterpillar in the\r\nround house, like dutiful babies they eat what is set before them until\r\nthe fat, tender caterpillar is eaten up. After they are satisfied they\r\nlie still in their brown skins and change into grown-up tachina-flies,\r\nand at last out come a lot of busy, _buzzing_, bothersome flies. It is\r\nrather hard on the caterpillar. But when we think what harmful, greedy\r\nthings most caterpillars are, perhaps it is good that there are\r\ntachina-flies to eat them. Is it time for supper yet?"\r\n\r\n"No, not yet," replied Mrs. Reece. "Do tell the children something about\r\nmosquitoes."\r\n\r\n"If I had to choose between Mr. and Mrs. Mosquito, I should take Mr.\r\nMosquito, for he neither bites nor buzzes, but attends strictly to his\r\nown business. Perhaps he thinks Mrs. Mosquito\'s voice pretty. Perhaps he\r\nlikes to hear about her adventures. But most people do not, for they\r\nthink Mrs. Mosquito a busybody, always going where she is not wished,\r\nalways breaking up conversations, and always coming back after she has\r\nbeen plainly told that she is not wanted. Yet her singing is music in\r\nthe ears of her husband. Perhaps if we had long, slender antenn\xc3\xa6, all\r\ncovered with hairs, like his, we, too, might like her song. When she\r\nsings these hairs begin to tremble, to vibrate, and a little nerve in\r\nthe antenn\xc3\xa6 changes this trembling to sound.\r\n\r\n"In every way Mr. Mosquito seems a more pleasant body. He eats very\r\nlittle, and contents himself with nectar. But she, knowing that\r\nexcitement makes the blood flow faster, and being a hearty eater, begins\r\nher song gently at first, then louder and louder, nearer and nearer.\r\nFinally, with her long, slender, sharp stylets, she makes a hole in your\r\ncheek or your arm, pushes in her sucking-beak, and pumps up the blood.\r\nAnd there she sucks and sucks until her stomach is full or she is\r\nbrushed off or killed."\r\n\r\n"Where do mosquitoes lay eggs?" asked Jack, who was certain that\r\neverything in the insect world did lay eggs, as indeed everything does.\r\n\r\n"In the water; any puddle will do. When the eggs hatch out they are\r\nfunny-looking fellows, long, tapering bodies with a big head end. At the\r\nother end are two little prongs. This baby, like some other babies, is\r\nnever quiet, but squirms and wriggles so that it is called a wriggler.\r\nUpon its thick head are two little tufts of hair. These it waves every\r\nmoment, so that all the food which comes its way will go into its hungry\r\nlittle mouth. One of the prongs at the other end of the body is an\r\nair-tube, so that the baby mosquito has to stand on its head to breathe.\r\nIt hangs head downward, and holds its air-tube above the surface of the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n"When people pour kerosene upon the water the wriggler cannot get any\r\nair to breathe, and therefore dies. Within a few days the wriggler\r\nchanges its skin three times; after the third change it looks very\r\ndifferent, and is called a pupa. Now, instead of having an air-tube at\r\nthe end, it has two on the back of the thorax. At the tail end are two\r\nflaps to help it swim. Even the pupa is never still a minute, but holds\r\nits air-tubes above the water\'s surface.\r\n\r\n"When anything comes to disturb it, it uses its flaps and swims safely\r\nto the bottom of the pool. At the end of two days out of the pupa skin\r\ncomes a grown-up mosquito. If it is a Mrs. Mosquito, she promptly begins\r\nto bite people and to carry about fevers or malaria from person to\r\nperson. The bite of a mosquito may sometimes be as dangerous as the bite\r\nof a rattlesnake."\r\n\r\nThe children had been slapping the mosquitoes buzzing about on the\r\n_piazza_. "And now," said the guide, "before we go into supper, I will\r\ntell you a real and a true story. Mosquitoes sometimes carry sickness\r\nfrom one person to another until it spreads throughout a large city. We\r\ndidn\'t realize how dangerous mosquitoes were till a short time ago.\r\nPeople had malaria, and were very ill with it. In some countries many\r\ndied. Every one thought, however, that the malaria came in some\r\nmysterious way from the mists of the low-lying swamps and marshes. But\r\none day some one happened to think it might not be in the marshes, after\r\nall; rather that it might be a certain little two-winged insect with a\r\nshort, piercing instrument, which spent its babyhood days in these same\r\nmarshes.\r\n\r\n"And so two English doctors determined to find out the truth of the\r\nmatter. In the faraway land of Italy was a place where thousands of\r\npeople were suffering from this disease. There these doctors went and\r\nbuilt a comfortable little house in the very worst place they could\r\nfind. They were careful to screen every door and window, and to leave\r\nnot a crack for a mosquito to crawl in.\r\n\r\n"There they lived, always going into the house at sundown, shutting all\r\nthe screen doors, but allowing the damp night air to pour in. It was\r\nthis night air which every one supposed gave people malaria. But the two\r\nphysicians in the snug little house, free from mosquitoes, kept well,\r\nstrong, and happy, although the people outside in the other houses were\r\nvery ill and suffering with chills and fever.\r\n\r\n"You see, these little Anopheles, for that is their name, bite some one\r\nill with malaria. Perhaps the next person they stab with their sharp\r\nneedle is well. In this way they leave some of the poisoned blood in the\r\nwound. There is another illness which is a hundred times worse than\r\nmalaria. This is called yellow fever. In some countries thousands of\r\npeople died from this every year, and doctors did not know just how it\r\nwas carried from place to place.\r\n\r\n"Our Government appointed a commission to study the matter. Dr. Walter\r\nReed, a surgeon of the United States Army, with three assistants, went\r\nto Havana and built a house, carefully screened, just like that of the\r\nEnglish physicians in Italy. People thought that the fever was carried\r\nin the clothes and on the sheets of those who were ill. To prove that\r\nthis was not so, these men wore the clothes of sick people, and even\r\nslept on the sheets taken from the sickbed. They did this disagreeable\r\nthing for twenty days, keeping the little house very warm, and shutting\r\nout the fresh air and sunshine. But in spite of all these things the men\r\ncontinued well and strong.\r\n\r\n"They wanted to prove even more surely that it was a certain kind of\r\nmosquito which really did the harm. So they built another house.\r\nEverything in this house was pure and clean. The rooms were flooded with\r\nfresh air and sunshine. Half of the house was carefully screened and\r\nshut off from the other half. The men in the half that was screened kept\r\nperfectly well. Those in the other half let themselves be bitten by\r\nmosquitoes which had been in the houses where there was yellow fever.\r\nAll became dangerously ill with the fever. Two of these brave physicians\r\ndied of the fever while trying to find the cause, in order that they\r\nmight save the lives of thousands of people."\r\n\r\n"That is modern heroism," said Mrs. Reece, "and service of the highest\r\nsort. All humanity is indebted to those brave men. There is no doubt but\r\nthat our Panama Canal could not be in progress to-day were it not for\r\nthe extermination of the mosquito in the canal zone. Since we can never\r\ntell where a mosquito has been, or what kind of a mosquito it is, I\r\nsuppose it is best to keep mosquitoes from biting, and always to keep\r\nthem out of the house. And now, children, supper is ready, and after\r\nthat games. Let us go to the dining-room!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI\r\n\r\nCAMPING OUT\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last the day, expected all summer long, had come. The children, Hope\r\nand Betty, Jack, Peter, and Jimmy, Mrs. Reece and Ben Gile, were\r\ngathered on the edge of the pond, their packs in the canoes, their\r\npaddles at bow and stern. Other guides had taken the food and tents\r\nahead the day before. Their friends had gathered to bid them good-bye,\r\nand finally, amid the farewells, they were off, Jimmie in a canoe by\r\nhimself, Jack and Peter paddling Mrs. Reece, and Ben Gile with the two\r\nlittle girls. Everybody was so excited that all talked at once, and\r\nnobody could hear any one else. Hope and Betty had never been camping\r\nbefore, and the boys meant to show the girls all the wonders of sleeping\r\nand eating out in the woods.\r\n\r\nFinally they came to a "carry"--that is, a path leading from one lake to\r\nanother, across which the food and canoes have to be lugged. The girls\r\nand Mrs. Reece carried the packs and food over, making several trips in\r\norder to do so; and the boys and the guide, crossing their paddles under\r\nthe thwarts of the canoes and raising the blades on their shoulders,\r\nbalanced the canoes and trotted swiftly over the carry. Nothing seemed\r\nany trouble that glorious, beautiful day--nothing too heavy, nothing too\r\nhard. Betty and Hope could have skipped over every inch of the trail,\r\nand they were quite sure that they could have done all the paddling,\r\ntoo. And Betty did learn, in after years, not only to paddle, but also\r\nto carry her own canoe, for she grew to be a big, strong, athletic girl,\r\nwith rosy cheeks and a quick, sure step.\r\n\r\nHour after hour they went from one pond to another. The ponds were\r\nlarger and wilder at each crossing, and already they were in a\r\nwilderness of woods and lakes, and heard the whistle of the hawk, the\r\nscream of the lonely eagle, and the crazy cries of the loon. Every once\r\nin a while a big heron mounted lazily upward and flew off solemnly to a\r\nplace where his peace need not be disturbed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n_A._ Moth.\r\n_B._ Caterpillar.\r\n_C._ Side view of head of moth.\r\n_D._ and _E._ Scales from the wing of a butterfly.]\r\n\r\nAlthough Hope and Peter and Jack lived all the year around in Rangeley\r\nVillage, yet they had never been so far away from home before, and to\r\nthem it seemed very wonderful. Even in the midst of it all, however,\r\nJack did not forget the prize Ben Gile had offered. He hurried over\r\ncarry after carry, and at the end of each one might be found flat on his\r\nface studying some little hill of ants.\r\n\r\nAt last, after travelling five hours, they came to a halt, ravenously\r\nhungry. Dinner was cooked and eaten, and then, after dinner, they began\r\ntheir long ascent of Saddleback, for they were going to a lonely little\r\npond on the second highest mountain in the State of Maine. There, at\r\nCamp-in-the-Clouds, was a cabin in which Mrs. Reece could sleep, and the\r\ngirls, too, if they wished, although they declared that they would not.\r\n\r\nUp, up the hill they trudged, stepping over blow-downs, following their\r\nfooting carefully, and watching with interest the little animals that\r\nscampered out of their way. But never did packs grow so heavy, and at\r\nlast Mrs. Reece, who was carrying nothing but Jack\'s camera, sat down\r\npanting and laughing.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t go a step farther," she declared, "until I catch my breath."\r\n\r\n"This is a good place to rest," assented the guide. "Some deer found it\r\nso this morning, I think. Here, catch that butterfly, Jack!"\r\n\r\nIn a flash Jack had caught the butterfly, and brought it, gently, to Ben\r\nGile.\r\n\r\n"You don\'t see this fellow up here often. Who knows the difference\r\nbetween a butterfly and a moth? No one? Well, that is because most\r\nchildren are going to bed about the time the moth begins to fly. Doesn\'t\r\nany one know? You have all seen moths and butterflies? Well, well, well!\r\n\r\n"The first thing you see is that when the moth lights on the edge of a\r\nflower-cup, instead of holding the wings up above the body, as the\r\nbutterfly does, it spreads its wings flat over the body. Then a\r\nbutterfly has little knobs at the tips of its slender antenn\xc3\xa6, while\r\nthe moth has slender ones without knobs, or pretty, feathery ones that\r\nlook like plumes."\r\n\r\n"I supposed," said Peter, "that moths and butterflies were just the\r\nsame, except that moths will fly into the house and burn their wings on\r\nthe lamps." Peter didn\'t in the least care about moths and butterflies.\r\nHe was longing to get to the top of the mountain, but he was too polite\r\nto seem impatient.\r\n\r\n"They are alike in many ways. You remember, do you not, that the locust\r\nhas a pair of soft jaws covering over the dark, hard ones? In the moths\r\nand butterflies these jaws are different. Each one is long, and has a\r\ndeep groove on the inner side. These two grooves fit together, and make\r\na slender tube called a proboscis. When flying this long tube is rolled\r\nup in a tight coil under the head; alighting, the proboscis is quickly\r\nuncoiled and dipped into the throat of the flower, and the sweet nectar\r\nsipped from it. See here, Jack, what have you on your fingers?"\r\n\r\n"The dust from the butterfly\'s wings, sir."\r\n\r\n"No, not quite dust, or powder, either. That dust is tiny hair and\r\nscales. If I had a powerful lens in my pocket I could show you how\r\ndeeply some of these tiny scales are scalloped, so that they look like a\r\nhand with fingers. If you rubbed all the scales off that wing there\r\nwould be no color left, for the scales are like little sacs, and many of\r\nthem contain grains of color called pigment--red, yellow, or brown. You\r\nhave all seen the rainbow of colors on a soap-bubble? Well, the\r\nbrilliant colors of the wing are made in just the same way as the colors\r\non a bubble: by the light striking the little ridges on the overlapping\r\nscales."\r\n\r\n"It is not only we who are fearfully and wonderfully made," said Mrs.\r\nReece, "but even the tiniest creatures God has created, and all with a\r\npurpose, all with a place."\r\n\r\nThe guide nodded his head. "The more you study, the more you see how\r\nevery least thing is part of a great mysterious whole. If you look at a\r\nbutterfly\'s wing from which the scales have been rubbed you will see\r\nplan and purpose in the placing of even those scales; for the little\r\npits into which the stems of the scale fit are turned all one way,\r\ntoward the base of the wing."\r\n\r\n"They are so beautiful!" exclaimed Betty. "Are they always pretty?"\r\n\r\n"That depends," replied the old man, "whether in their caterpillar youth\r\nyou think them pretty. They have a bad name, then, for being homely, and\r\ndo a good deal of damage."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I hate caterpillars!" cried Hope.\r\n\r\n"Fuzzy caterpillars hump so and crawl," said Betty.\r\n\r\n"You mean woolly bears?"\r\n\r\n"Woolly bears!" exclaimed the children.\r\n\r\n"Yes; not Teddy bears. They have to play somehow, so they wiggle for\r\njoy, and this takes them along very fast--that is, fast for a\r\ncaterpillar. Sometimes they spin a long thread by which they take a\r\nflying short cut and land--on your back."\r\n\r\nJimmie dropped a tiny twig down Betty\'s back, which made her scream.\r\n\r\n"But they don\'t harm us," said Ben Gile. "They are so fussy about what\r\nthey eat for dinner that they wouldn\'t think of biting even the sweetest\r\nlittle boy or girl. They prefer something far more tender. Ah, you\r\nwouldn\'t like Isabella!" The old man shook his head sadly.\r\n\r\n"Isabella! Who is Isabella?" questioned the children.\r\n\r\n"Isabella is always in a hurry," said the guide--"always. She is brown\r\nin the middle, and black on the head and tail end, Isabella is, and she\r\nwalks rapidly, as if she had a great deal to do before she could take\r\ntime to be made over into a tiger-moth. She stops every once in a while\r\nto make sure she is on the right road; then she hurries along in a\r\nnervous, fidgety way, looking for a nice, comfortable stone under which\r\nto have a winter home, for Isabella is in such haste that she could\r\nnever think of taking time to spin a cocoon."\r\n\r\n"But do all caterpillars turn into moths or butterflies?" asked Jack.\r\n\r\n"Yes, every one, my son, that lives long enough, just as surely as a boy\r\nwill turn into a man. The butterfly lays the egg, and after the egg has\r\nbeen quiet for a while out comes a little worm; the worm spins the\r\ncocoon, and out of the cocoon comes a perfect moth, or butterfly. It is\r\na wonderful cycle, a wonderful series of changes. Little boys and girls\r\nseem to be surrounded with more love and don\'t change their skins as\r\nmoths do, but the mystery of life belongs quite as much to the helpless\r\nmoth as it does to any one of us."\r\n\r\n"But is a caterpillar an insect, and is a butterfly an insect?" asked\r\nBetty.\r\n\r\n"Of course, you goose," said Jimmie; "you don\'t expect to hatch a duck\r\nfrom a hen\'s egg, do you?"\r\n\r\nBut Ben Gile, who was older than Jimmie and decidedly more patient,\r\nexplained, carefully: "If you look at a caterpillar and a moth you will\r\nsee that their bodies aren\'t so unlike, after all. They are made up of\r\nrings, and both the moth and the caterpillar have six legs apiece. Most\r\ncaterpillars have little prop legs, but these aren\'t real legs and\r\nshouldn\'t be counted. Caterpillars eat and eat and eat; they are such\r\nsolid little chaps they must need a good many legs, real and false, to\r\nkeep moving at all. Well, heigho! stretch your own legs, boys! We\'ll\r\nleave the caterpillar where it is, and move on to the top of the\r\nmountain, or we\'ll never be there in time to eat our own supper. One,\r\ntwo, three, march!"\r\n\r\nAnd off they went, talking and laughing and scrambling up the side of\r\nthe mountain, which swung dark and steep above them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII\r\n\r\nCAMP-IN-THE-CLOUDS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe camp was reached. Once there, the children found the other two\r\nguides in the cabin. The cook-tent was already pitched; the\r\nsleeping-tents had been left so that the boys might choose their own\r\nlocations and help in pitching them. It was a beautiful place--remote,\r\nwild, two-thirds up the side of the great mountain.\r\n\r\nIn front was the famous trout pond, and beyond the little valley made by\r\nthe pond the crest of the mountain rose higher and higher. Dusk was\r\ncoming on, and the crisp mountain air was filled with the shadows of the\r\nwoods; along the mountain summit lay streamers of white cloud. Down,\r\ndown, down reached the long fingers of cloud, and up, up, up reached the\r\ndeep shadows, just as if a great hand were closing the world in dusk.\r\nEvery little sound was as clear in the evening air as the water of the\r\npond was transparent. Small shadows moved about the edge of the\r\npond--deer, they were, said Ben Gile, that had come down to the edge to\r\ndrink.\r\n\r\n"Phew, isn\'t it cold!" shouted the children, as they ran from one thing\r\nto another; "and won\'t supper taste good!"\r\n\r\nJack, who hadn\'t on any stout boots like Jimmie\'s, and whose jacket was\r\nthreadbare and thin, began to think the sleeping-blankets would feel\r\ngood when it was time to crawl in. In front of the cabin blazed a big\r\ncamp-fire, and around this fire supper was served. "Did stewed apricots,\r\nsoda-biscuits, bacon, eggs, hot cakes, ever taste so good? Will they\r\never taste so good again? Did hot cakes and syrup ever make the butter\r\nfly so fast?" asked Ben Gile.\r\n\r\n"And, speaking of the butterfly," he went on, "it\'s not time to turn in\r\nyet, it\'s too dark to fish or explore, so let me tell you a little more\r\nabout the butterfly, and if you don\'t like it you can just imagine it is\r\na hot-cake butterfly."\r\n\r\nThe children thought this was a great joke. But Peter, who had eaten so\r\nmuch he was almost asleep, didn\'t hear what Ben Gile said.\r\n\r\n"Well," the old man continued, just as if he were beginning where he had\r\nleft off in the afternoon--"well, the caterpillar eats so much--it eats\r\nalmost as much as Peter does"--at this Peter opened his eyes\r\ngood-naturedly--"it eats so much that very soon it grows too big for its\r\nskin, so the old skin splits for the growing body, and out comes young\r\ncaterpillar in a clean, new dress--a very easy way for Mrs. Butterfly to\r\nhave her babies get new clothes. Don\'t you think it is, Mrs. Reece?--no\r\nhems to stitch, no buttons to sew on, no darning. The only things their\r\nmothers ever do for them is to start them with the food they like.\r\n\r\n"And such a butterfly this mother is that little she cares whether her\r\nchildren are considered pests or not, because they eat everything green\r\nthat they like, and eat before they are invited. A long sigh of relief\r\nthe gardener or farmer draws when the caterpillars lie quiet to pupate.\r\nThey lie very, very quiet, with wings, antenn\xc3\xa6, and legs folded under\r\nthe body."\r\n\r\n"What does pupate mean?" asked Betty, who was poking the fire and\r\nlistening hard to every word the old man spoke.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n_A._ Cocoon of a polyphemus moth.\r\n_B._ Cocoon of a cecropian moth.]\r\n\r\n"It means just that--to lie quiet and change. They do it in different\r\nways. Some crawl down into the ground and some pull out their silky\r\nhairs, and with these and the silk they can spin they make a soft,\r\nsilken cocoon. Some make over their last skin into a hard covering. The\r\nmonarch butterfly does this.\r\n\r\n"And there is a troublesome creature called the clothes moth--Mrs. Reece\r\ncan tell you about that--who lays its eggs on anything woollen it can\r\nfind. After a while a baby clothes moth, a whitish worm, hatches out.\r\nThen this little fellow eats the fibres of the wool, and finally spins a\r\ncocoon out of these fibres and its own silk.\r\n\r\n"Some caterpillars are leaf-rollers--that is, when they pupate they roll\r\nover the corners of a leaf, make themselves a neat hammock, and there\r\nlie quite still in a cool and comfortable place to sleep."\r\n\r\nPoor Peter had tumbled over, his head on Mrs. Reece\'s lap. Betty and\r\nHope, wide awake, were thinking just as much of the wonderful tent in\r\nwhich they were to sleep as of the butterflies and moths. They were wide\r\nawake enough to point their fingers at sleepy Peter.\r\n\r\n"I think there is one kind of moth," said Mrs. Reece, stroking Peter\'s\r\nsilky hair, "that spins something almost as soft as this."\r\n\r\n"Softer," affirmed Ben Gile; "and that is the silk-worm."\r\n\r\n"Does the caterpillar make the silk our dresses are made from?" asked\r\nBetty.\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed. The mother moth is a creamy-white. She lays several\r\nhundred eggs; from each of these eggs comes a little worm. These little\r\nworms have been cared for so long by men that they don\'t know how to\r\ntake care of themselves any more.\r\n\r\n"They like to eat the leaves of the mulberry-tree. If these leaves are\r\nnot to be found they will sometimes eat lettuce. For forty-five days\r\nthey eat as fast as they can, which is a good deal faster than greedy\r\nchildren can eat.\r\n\r\n"Every ten days or so they cast aside their old skin and come out in a\r\nnew one. After the last moulting of the skin the worm begins to spin a\r\ncocoon about itself. At first the cocoon is not very smooth, but in a\r\nwhile the worm gets well started and spins the rest of it with one long,\r\nsilky thread."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t that wonderful!" exclaimed one of the guides. "I suppose that\r\nsilk is finer than the finest trout-line."\r\n\r\n"A hundred times finer," answered Ben. "Usually it is three hundred\r\nyards long. Before the pupa has a chance to make its way out, and so\r\ndestroy the long, silken thread, the man who has taken such care of the\r\nworm drops the cocoon into boiling water, which kills the pupa at once.\r\nThen the precious silk thread is carefully unwound on to little spools,\r\nand is ready to be made into thread or spun into silk.\r\n\r\n"And now, children, it\'s time for you to spin your dreams. Shake up\r\nPeter, and we\'ll get ready for the night. Too bad to leave this fire,\r\nbut we can have one as often as we want."\r\n\r\nThe boys slept like tops, but there were two little girls who lay rather\r\nwide awake most of the night, listening to the strangest grunting sounds\r\nin the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII\r\n\r\nSTORM-BOUND\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter two glorious days of exploring--"exploricating," the guides called\r\nit--the children went to bed early, expecting to make an early start to\r\nhunt partridge. They were so tired from their good times that for two or\r\nthree hours they slept like tops.\r\n\r\nBut in front of the cabin Ben Gile and Mrs. Reece and the other guides\r\nwere looking at the night sky anxiously. The lightning flashed more and\r\nmore vividly, black clouds were coming nearer and nearer. What was a\r\ndistant rumble soon became a near-by, long undertow of ominous sound.\r\nNearer and nearer it came, until every flash was followed by a sound\r\nlike ripping.\r\n\r\nMrs. Reece was very uneasy, for she did not like to have the children in\r\nthe tents alone. But soon Betty and Hope came scampering through the\r\ndark to the cabin. They were surprised to see the older people up.\r\nBefore long the boys also came to the cabin rubbing their eyes, yawning,\r\nand pretending not to care whether there was to be a cyclone or a\r\ncloud-burst.\r\n\r\nFor a while all sat waiting for the storm to break. When it did break,\r\nwhat torrents of rain and wind descended! How the trees groaned and\r\ncracked! How the rain roared upon the shingled roof, and how the wind\r\nhowled through the mountain valley!\r\n\r\n"Well," said Ben Gile, "let\'s have a fire in the fireplace, then we can\r\nhave a crackle of our own." He had noticed how nervous Mrs. Reece grew,\r\nand that the little girls were watching her. He could not help thinking\r\nthat it was foolish, even wicked, to waste strength in fear of something\r\nwhich no one of them could stop. "Build a fire, boys." And build a fire\r\nthey did--a royal good blaze. "Now throw on some of those pine-cones you\r\nchildren gathered." There was a flare in the cabin almost as bright as\r\nthe incessant flare of the lightning outside. "I\'ll tell you what we\'ll\r\ndo," he continued, "we will have a midnight spread. We will have some of\r\nTom\'s famous flapjacks. Mrs. Reece, don\'t you want to make molasses\r\ncandy, and then the children can pull it."\r\n\r\nThe storm was forgotten by the children as, with many squeals of glee,\r\nthey rushed into this midnight frolic.\r\n\r\n"And now, Ben," said Tom, the guide, "I\'ve just found something; I have\r\nit in my hand. I propose, Ben, while the rest of us work, that you make\r\none of your stories out of it, and tell us all about it."\r\n\r\nTom opened his hand, and the children crowded around to see. There was a\r\nshout of laughter.\r\n\r\n"Why, that\'s only a dead June-bug!"\r\n\r\n"Who wants to know about a June-bug?" exclaimed Jimmie, much to the\r\ndiscomfiture of the guide, who knew a great deal about moose and deer\r\nand bears and beavers, even if he didn\'t know much about a June-bug. The\r\nguides had profound respect for the schoolmaster, Ben Gile, who was\r\nreally too wise and kind to laugh at another\'s ignorance. But this is\r\nanother story, and Jimmie learned better in the years to come.\r\n\r\n"You\'re right, Tom," said Ben, "to want to know. Sometimes it\'s about\r\nthese commonest things folks know the least. When I was a boy it was\r\nalways so with me. There are several facts about a June-bug that are\r\ninteresting. First, it is not a bug at all; and, second, it comes in\r\nMay and not in June. It is really a May-beetle, and a great, clumsy,\r\nbuzzing, blundering fellow it is, as careless about its appearance as it\r\nis about the way it enters a room. You know the old adage, \'Haste makes\r\nwaste\'? Perhaps it\'s the haste that makes the June-bug\'s untidiness.\r\nBeetles have hard wing covers--see these little shell-like casings?--to\r\ncover the more delicate wings underneath. The June-bug has wing covers,\r\ntoo, but it never keeps its best wings tucked in. They are always\r\nhanging out in a crumpled way. These bugs eat the leaves of the trees,\r\nand their children, little, fat, white grubs with horny heads, nibble,\r\nas they crawl around under the surface of the earth, the tender roots of\r\nthe grass and the strawberry plants."\r\n\r\n"Why, Ben, you\'ve told me more already," said Tom, "than any dullard\r\nlike me could ever learn from a book. To think it\'s a beetle! But I\r\nmight have known from looking at it. Are all the beetles harmful?"\r\n\r\n"Most of them are pests, and do a good deal of damage. Its cousin,\r\nrose-beetle, is pretty, her body covered with soft, yellow hairs, and\r\nshe has rose-colored legs. But handsome is as handsome does, and\r\nrose-beetle causes more damage than her clumsy cousin, for Rose feeds\r\non rose-bushes as well as on fruit trees. Indeed, almost everything that\r\ncomes to her mill is grist. She\'s as bad--and worse--than the\r\nelm-beetle."\r\n\r\nBy this time the cooking molasses smelled so good, the cabin fire roared\r\nso pleasantly, and the smell of the flapjacks Adam was frying was so\r\nappetizing, that the children had quite forgotten the storm outside, and\r\nwere having one of the jolliest frolics of their lives--one they never\r\nforgot.\r\n\r\n"Tell us something more, sir," urged Jack, "about the beetles."\r\n\r\n"There is one comical fellow who makes me think of Peter. In the books\r\nit is called a click-beetle, but it is also called a skip-jack because\r\nof the somersaults it can turn. On the under side of its thorax is a\r\nspine resting on the edge of a hole. This funny beetle, by pushing the\r\nspine down over the hole and then letting it go, throws itself up in the\r\nair with a sharp click."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know them," called Hope, "for I have seen them doing it, but I\r\nnever knew how they did it!"\r\n\r\n"And now," said Master All-Wise, very soberly, "after I tell you that\r\nthe children of the click-beetle are called wire-worms, and that they\r\neat and kill the roots of plants, I want to tell you about a beetle no\r\none of you has ever seen--a most extraordinary beetle."\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n_A._ Lady-beetle.\r\n_B._ Burying-beetle.\r\n_C._ Oil-beetle.]\r\n\r\nAll were attention at once.\r\n\r\n"Many years ago there lived away out in California a little, round,\r\nbrownish, striped beetle, which crawled about and ate heartily of a\r\nplant called the sand-bur. One day one of the family happened to wander\r\nup to a nice, juicy potato plant. After eating its fill it probably\r\nlooked up some of its brothers and sisters, and told them about these\r\ngood plants growing in the fields. With one accord they left the\r\nsand-burs and began to eat the potato plant. Farther and farther they\r\nwandered, until thousands of them reached the eastern part of our\r\ncountry, eating the potato plants wherever they found them on the way.\r\nNow, these beetles are to be seen everywhere in our country, spoiling\r\ncrop after crop."\r\n\r\nBy this time Jack\'s eager face was smiling, and he was looking\r\nquestioningly at Ben Gile.\r\n\r\n"What kind of a beetle do you suppose it was?" asked the old man.\r\n\r\nNobody knew. At last Jack ventured, "Was it a potato-bug, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Oh, of course!" shouted the children. "Why didn\'t we think of that?\r\nBut you said we had never seen it."\r\n\r\n"So I did," said the guide, "and I don\'t believe there is one child here\r\nwho has ever carefully watched the potato-bug. And there\'s the\r\ncarpet-beetle, whose babies eat carpets unless your mother tempts them\r\nwith pieces of red flannel. And there\'s the searcher-beetle, with its\r\npretty green or violet wing covers, who is always on the search for\r\ncaterpillars. And there\'s the fire-fly, which is a soft-bodied beetle.\r\n\r\n"And there\'s the very useful little beetle we call the ladybug, which is\r\nnot a bug, but a beetle. The ladybug is a great help to men who own\r\nfruit orchards in the West. All over the country are to be found little\r\nbugs called scale insects. These scales are very bad for trees, because\r\nwith their long, slender beaks the scales pump out the sap. Sometimes\r\nthey are so thick on the branch that they coat it entirely. You remember\r\nthat I told you that one of these troublesome scales is the\r\ncottony-cushion scale, and that one day it was discovered that a\r\nlady-beetle from Australia liked these scales very much. So a great many\r\nof them were taken to California to eat the scales. The ladybugs eat\r\nlittle green aphids, too, and often Mrs. Ladybug will lay her eggs\r\nright in the midst of a family of aphids; and then the larv\xc3\xa6 are\r\nsurrounded by a hearty lunch when they come out of the egg. They eat the\r\naphids, the scales, and sometimes the eggs of other insects."\r\n\r\n"Time, Ben," said Adam, "to have the flapjacks. I guess the storm must\r\nbe blowing over."\r\n\r\nAll drew up to the cabin table, and ate as heartily as if they were\r\neating dinner. It really looked as if the children had had no supper.\r\n\r\n"In about half an hour," said Tom, "the storm will be over. Aren\'t there\r\nany beetles that live in the water, Ben?"\r\n\r\n"Oh yes; you can see them any day if you go by a brook. The\r\ndiving-beetles are skimming about, rowing themselves along with their\r\nflattened hind legs. Every few minutes they come to the surface and lift\r\ntheir wings to get a little air under them, then down they go into the\r\nbrook. They are very hungry beetles, eating other insects which they\r\nfind in the water. The boldest often try to take a bite out of a fish.\r\nJust think of calling a baby beetle a water-tiger! Well, these babies\r\nare as savage and ferocious to the little creatures living about them in\r\nthe water as a big tiger would be to us, if we should happen to meet\r\none.\r\n\r\n"I like best the whirligig-beetles, they are such frisky fellows, always\r\nhaving a good time, frolicking about with dozens of other little\r\nwhirligigs. They are bluish-black and shiny, and if you look carefully\r\nyou will see a little bubble at the tip of every tail. This little\r\nbubble is held there by tiny hairs, and because whirligig has it, it can\r\nbreathe while it stays under the water. From time to time it comes to\r\nthe surface to get a new bubble, then is off again for another race or\r\ngame of tag with its friends, and at the same time to snap up a few\r\nwater creatures for dinner. It looks as though it had four eyes, but it\r\nhas not, just two, divided into upper and lower halves. The upper halves\r\nlook up through the water and the lower ones down at the bottom of the\r\nbrooks. So, you see, insects must step lively if they want to keep out\r\nof its clutches.\r\n\r\n"The babies of some beetles, instead of liking nice, clean food, prefer\r\ndead animals. The mother and father hunt around until they find a dead\r\nmouse or bird; then they begin to dig away the earth under the mouse or\r\nbird and around it. Finally the poor dead thing is in a deep hole; then\r\nMrs. Burying-beetle lays her eggs on it, and together they cover it up\r\nwith earth. When the grubs hatch they find plenty to eat, and are soon\r\nbig burying-beetles, like their mothers and fathers.\r\n\r\n"Did you ever wonder how the little fat worms get inside of chestnuts\r\nand acorns? A beetle called a weevil is the creature which puts the fat\r\nworms there. Mrs. Weevil has a long, slender, curved beak. She crawls up\r\non to the side of a chestnut, bores a hole in the side, then lays an egg\r\ndeep down in it. After a while the egg hatches and a tiny grub begins to\r\nfeed on the nut. Fatter and fatter it gets; sometimes it lies in the nut\r\nall winter, but more often it crawls out and buries itself in the ground\r\nwhile it grows into a weevil.\r\n\r\n"Some day, as you are walking along a sunny road in the country, you may\r\nmeet a blister-beetle. It is a pretty, bluish-green color, and when you\r\npick it up you will see drops of oil oozing out of its joints. The dried\r\nbodies will raise a blister on the skin, and that is the reason we call\r\nsuch beetles blister-beetles. There is a queer blister-beetle who lays\r\nher eggs near bees\' nests. The baby beetles then wait for a bee to come\r\nalong. They fasten themselves to the hairs on the bee\'s body. When the\r\nbee goes to its nest to put in the honey the young beetle manages to\r\nget into a honey-cell with the egg. Mrs. Bee does not see that anything\r\nis amiss, seals up the cell, and flies away for another load. The larva\r\nfirst eats the egg of Mrs. Bee, then it changes into a clumsy kind of a\r\nfellow, floats in the honey, and eats all it can so that it will quickly\r\nbecome a grown-up.\r\n\r\n"There is one beetle which plants a tiny fungus in its home in the\r\nground. The babies run along and eat the tips of this delicacy, while\r\nthe mothers and fathers take larger bites. These are called\r\nambrosia-beetles, because of the dainty food they eat. Now that the\r\nstorm is over, I mustn\'t tell you anything more than a few words about\r\nthe engraver-beetle, which lives between the bark and the live wood of a\r\ntree. Mr. and Mrs. Engraver-Beetle make a long tunnel under the bark.\r\nMrs. Engraver makes notches along the sides, and in every notch lays an\r\negg. When the babies hatch, each one begins a tunnel for itself, running\r\nout straight from the long one. And now that\'s the end of this story."\r\n\r\n"Well, Ben," said Tom, respectfully, "these children don\'t know the\r\nvalue of the things they are learning. It\'s a privilege, sir, to have a\r\nchance to guide with you. I\'ve learned more in these last years about\r\nGod\'s wonders from you than ever I learned in all my long life. I didn\'t\r\nknow there were so many beetles in the world."\r\n\r\n"These are only half a dozen of a multitude of beetles which we haven\'t\r\nthe time to name."\r\n\r\n"Now, off to bed, children," said Mrs. Reece, "or you\'ll never be able\r\nto get up early. Good-night to every one!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV\r\n\r\nA DAY\'S HUNTING\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a glorious day after the night\'s storm. By five o\'clock the\r\nchildren were ready to go hunting with Ben Gile.\r\n\r\nAlthough they were rather sleepy, yet they managed to get an early\r\nbreakfast--five o\'clock is an early breakfast, isn\'t it?--and by six\r\no\'clock they were off into the woods. Ben Gile made the children follow\r\nbehind him in single file, and so in line, making as little noise as\r\npossible, they went through the woods. The birch-trees and poplars, in\r\nthe midst of the darker, heavier foliage, seemed golden with the early\r\nsunlight. Everywhere the bushes sparkled with the rain of the night\r\nbefore. They took a path that ran almost in a curve around one entire\r\nside of the mountain. Ben Gile kept a sharp lookout, for the partridge,\r\nhe knew, would be upon the ground or up in the trees. He pointed to\r\nseveral places where partridge had been scratching. The woods were full\r\nof them, and every minute he expected to hear the whir of their wings as\r\nthey started up. And, sure enough, there was suddenly a loud beating of\r\nwings, and then, crack! crack! crack! from the shot-gun. Down came three\r\nplump partridges. Not more than ten minutes later the old man brought\r\ndown three more. Then he let Jack, who was a good shot, take his gun,\r\nand down came two more.\r\n\r\n"Eight partridge," he exclaimed, "and quite enough for us all! We shoot\r\nonly what we actually need for food, not a bird more. Oho! somebody else\r\nmade a home here. Old Paw Bear has been tearing it out and licking his\r\nchops."\r\n\r\nThe children leaned forward, looking eagerly. "What was it?" they asked.\r\n\r\n"Honey," said the guide. "Paw Bear has a sweet tooth for honey and\r\nberries."\r\n\r\n"I should think the bees would sting him," said Jimmie.\r\n\r\n"They do try to, but little he cares, with his thick coat of hair. Not a\r\nbit. The bees have another enemy, too, which is always hovering about to\r\nfind a chance to get into the busy little house; that is the bee-moth.\r\nIf she gets the least opportunity Mother Bee-Moth lays her eggs in the\r\nwax of the honeycomb, for the baby moths are very fond of wax. It\'s not\r\nan easy matter to get in when the bees are not looking, but she manages\r\nit quite often; and when the little larvas hatch out of the eggs, they\r\neat the wax and the mischief is done. When Mother Bee-Moth is seen the\r\nbees rush upon her and sting her to death. They have good cause to hate\r\nher, for the wax is precious, hard to make and to mould into the little\r\ncells. It is not pleasant to have some miserable worm eat the roof from\r\nyour head. Oftentimes the bees are so discouraged that they decide, as\r\nthey talk it over in bee language, that it is easier to build a new home\r\nthan to repair the old one. They settle upon an hour of departure, and\r\noff they go."\r\n\r\n"But I didn\'t know," said Betty, "that bees live in their hives; I\r\nthought that they just stored their honey there."\r\n\r\n"So did I," said Jimmie.\r\n\r\nIt was Jack\'s time to smile, for, a country boy, he had often watched\r\nthe hives. "Couldn\'t you tell us something, sir? Here\'s a bit of the\r\ncone left."\r\n\r\n"Do you want to hear?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I think bees are so interesting!" Betty clapped her hands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LEAF-CUTTER BEE]\r\n\r\n"Did you ever look closely at a bee? Their bodies are covered with\r\nhairs, unlike the hairs found on other insects, for each hair is a tiny\r\nplume. And their mouths, which they have to use for so many different\r\nthings, are remarkably made; each part is formed to do a certain kind of\r\nwork. First there are the strong biting jaws, then another pair of jaws\r\njoined to the lower lip, which move easily back and forth. This forms a\r\nsucking instrument, which the bees use for drinking nectar."\r\n\r\n"My," exclaimed Peter, "it must be convenient to have two pairs of\r\njaws!"\r\n\r\n"On the head, too, are antenn\xc3\xa6, which form little elbows, like those of\r\nthe ant. With these the bee smells and feels. Some bees have short\r\ntongues, and usually live alone; others have long tongues, and generally\r\nlive in colonies. Perhaps a long tongue makes an insect sociable, and\r\nperhaps sociability makes a tongue grow long."\r\n\r\nThe children were looking at their tongues to see which had the longest.\r\nPeter scanned his anxiously. "Your tongue is awfully long, Pete," said\r\nJack.\r\n\r\n"I know an interesting short-tongued bee who lives in a house by\r\nherself. Her name is Andrena. She bores a hole in the ground, digging\r\nout a wide hallway. From this she digs side passages, each one ending\r\nin a little closed room. The walls of these rooms are hard and shiny,\r\nlike porcelain. When Andrena finishes her house she makes a nourishing\r\npaste of nectar and pollen. Pollen is the yellow powder from flowers.\r\nYou know bees, by carrying about the pollen, help in fertilizing the\r\nflowers. But of this we shall learn more some day when we are talking\r\nabout the flowers. This powder the bee packs down into the little rooms.\r\nThen she lays an egg on each pile of food and builds a door to shut the\r\negg away safely."\r\n\r\n"Do bees always feed their children on nectar and pollen?" asked Hope.\r\n\r\n"Always," replied the old man. "They never feed their babies on other\r\ninsects, as the ants and wasps do. Then there are the little\r\nshort-tongued bees who live in apartments, the apartments all clustered\r\ntogether, with a common wide passageway into the ground and separate\r\nhallways. Around the main opening is an odd chimney, built on a slant,\r\nwhich prevents the rain from pouring into the open doorway."\r\n\r\nThe children were wide-eyed with astonishment. That bees should build\r\nchimneys was more than they could believe!\r\n\r\n"Goodness!" said Jimmie, "if that is what a short-tongued bee can do,\r\nwhat can a long-tongued bee do?"\r\n\r\n"They are very clever. Some are carpenters, some masons, some miners,\r\nsome tailors. The leaf-cutter bee makes a neat home, covering the walls\r\nwith pretty, green leaves. First she digs a tunnel in a suitable branch\r\nof wood; then she goes to a rosebush, cuts out an oval piece of a rose\r\nleaf, and arranges it smoothly on the walls of the tunnel; cuts other\r\noval pieces and puts them on, fastening the edges neatly together. In\r\nthe bottom of the tunnel she puts some pollen paste, lays an egg on the\r\npaste, cuts some circular pieces of rose leaf, which she presses on the\r\ntop of the egg and pollen, forming a green roof for the room and a floor\r\nfor the room above. She puts in more food and another egg, until the\r\ntunnel is full of little rooms."\r\n\r\n"And what does the carpenter-bee do?" asked Jack, looking with new\r\nrespect at the bit of honeycomb he held in his hand.\r\n\r\n"She makes doors of pith, and, like the tender mother she is, sits on\r\ntop of the nest waiting for her babies to grow up. This is a most\r\nunusual thing for a bee mother to do. The egg at the very bottom of the\r\ntube hatches first, but it has to wait until the others hatch.\r\nBy-and-by Mrs. Carpenter-Bee takes them all out for a sunny flight in\r\nthe summer air."\r\n\r\n"And they never come back any more!" sang out Peter.\r\n\r\n"Indeed they do, you care-free youngster. The pith doors have been taken\r\ndown, and they come back to put things in order. They clean house; they\r\nbring out every scrap piece by piece. There is a big carpenter-bee that\r\nmakes its doors of chips of wood, usually neatly glued together. There\r\nis just one lazy bee in the world of which I know, and that is a\r\nvisiting-bee."\r\n\r\n"Visiting-bees?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, the guest-bees, who visit their friends the year round, let their\r\nhosts wait upon them, and never help to keep anything clean or to\r\ncollect nectar and pollen. Mrs. Guest-Bee even lays her eggs in Mrs.\r\nBumblebee\'s nest, and when the guest babies hatch out, it is not their\r\nmother, but Mrs. Bumblebee, who feeds them from the food she has stored\r\nup for her own children. The guest-bees are so lazy that no little\r\nbaskets are found on their legs for carrying pollen."\r\n\r\n"But aren\'t the bees ever idle?" asked Peter, whose conscience hurt him\r\nbecause he never liked to work.\r\n\r\n"No bee except the guest-bee and drone is ever idle. The happy-go-lucky\r\nbumblebee, which buzzes so near us on these warm summer days, is always\r\non the go, although she is easy-going and happy-go-lucky. Mrs. Bumblebee\r\nisn\'t an over-particular person, as bee persons go. She is not a careful\r\nhousekeeper, like her cousin Mrs. Honey-Bee, but she carries her own\r\nburdens just the same, and probably is as contented in her roughly made,\r\nuntidy house as Mrs. Honey-Bee is in her beautifully neat one. Sometimes\r\nshe has a nest as big as your head, with rooms in it of all sizes and\r\nshapes. She probably thinks the honey-bee family would get along just as\r\nwell if they were a little less fussy, and probably she is right. Early\r\nin the spring Mrs. Bumblebee starts out house-hunting. When she finds\r\nthe place she wants she puts some honey and pollen there, and lays an\r\negg on the little pile. After a while the larvas come out of the eggs.\r\nWhen they have eaten what they want they make a cocoon, and curl up for\r\na rest while they are being made into little workers. You know, the bee\r\nfamily is made up of the mother bee, who is called the queen, and many\r\nfathers, who are called drones; all the rest are workers."\r\n\r\n"That\'s something like the ants, sir, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, something, Jack; but you mustn\'t tell that story yet. Every one of\r\nMrs. Bumblebee\'s first family are workers. While the first workers are\r\nout getting food for their brothers and sisters, Mrs. Bumblebee takes\r\nthe old cocoons which they have left behind and makes them over into\r\nrooms for the new babies, who are to be drones and queens.\r\n\r\n"They are very happy all summer long, but as it grows colder they begin\r\nto shiver and shake. At last all die except the young queens, who have\r\ncrawled away from the nest and found a warm crack somewhere in which to\r\ntake a long nap. When the spring comes the young queens rub their eyes,\r\nstretch their legs and wings, and are off looking for a home for their\r\ncoming families."\r\n\r\n"But what kind of bee\'s-nest did old Paw Bear get into?" asked Hope.\r\n\r\n"This nest was a wild honey-bee\'s nest. Some honey-bees are wild this\r\nway, but most live close to the homes of men. When they live in our\r\ngardens they live in a hive we make for them, and the families consist\r\nof Mrs. Honey-Bee, the queen, about a hundred Mr. Honey-Bees, and many\r\nthousands of workers. The workers are the little bees, the drones the\r\nmiddle-sized ones, and the queen is the great big bee.\r\n\r\n"Men often help the workers to build the little cells in which they\r\nstore the honey and in which the queen lays the eggs. These cells are\r\nsix-sided rooms. Every day the queen lays an egg in one of the little\r\nrooms, and with it the workers put some pollen and honey. In three days\r\nout comes the larva from the egg. It is a helpless creature, soft and\r\nwhite, and without feet.\r\n\r\n"Busy, busy workers are always on hand to take the best care of the\r\nbabies. The first food the nurses give them is bee jelly, which looks\r\nsomething like blanc-mange. This bee jelly the workers make in their\r\nstomach, then feed it from their own mouths into the baby mouths. After\r\nlunching a couple of days on bee jelly they are old enough to eat pollen\r\nand honey, which the workers get out of the six-sided rooms where they\r\nhave packed it away.\r\n\r\n"These babies grow very quickly. Soon they are so long that they almost\r\nfill their rooms. Then the nurses put in some extra food, tuck in the\r\nbabies, and make a roof of wax over each room. For a whole day the baby\r\nhas to feed itself, shut away all alone; then it stops eating, and lies\r\nvery quietly while it is being made into a real bee. In about thirteen\r\ndays it splits its dried skin, in which it has been napping, gnaws a\r\nhole in the wax roof, and out it comes--a full-fledged bee.\r\n\r\n"But it is too new and young to go out in the big world yet, so for a\r\nfew weeks it is kept busy in the hive nursing other baby bees. When it\r\nhas grown stronger it leaves the hive, flying out over the sunny\r\npastures in search of buttercups and clover heads.\r\n\r\n"Whenever the honey-bees want to make a queen they know just how to do\r\nit. You know, a queen is a very important person. A bee queen is like an\r\nant queen, not the ruler of a kingdom, but the mother of many, many\r\nchildren. Since a queen is a person of such note, she must have a larger\r\nroom than an ordinary worker, so they set to work and tear down the\r\npartitions between two or three cells. When the egg in the large room\r\nhatches the white larva is fed bee jelly, just like the little worker\r\nlarva, but it is never given any pollen or honey. When it is five days\r\nold some jelly is put in the room with it and a roof is built over its\r\nhead. For seven long days the baby stays here all alone, then it gnaws\r\nits way out, and, wonder of wonders, we have a queen instead of a\r\nworker!\r\n\r\n"Now, Mrs. Honey-Bee has been the queen of the family so long she is\r\nvery angry to have a young queen hatch out, and does all she can to kill\r\nher. But the workers have spent much time and labor in making this\r\nqueen, and they stand close around her to protect her from the jealous\r\nold queen. The honey-bee family, however, has grown so big that there is\r\nroom for no new babies in the hive, and that is the reason that the\r\nworkers have raised a new queen, so that she may start a new family.\r\n\r\n"There is not room in one house for two queens; one must go, and it is\r\nusually old Mrs. Honey-Bee. Surrounded by part of the family, she flies\r\nout of the old home in search of a new place. If she is living in some\r\none\'s garden a new hive is all ready for her, and she soon settles down\r\nagain to her egg-laying, while the workers hurry to bring in food for\r\nthe new babies. If there is no hive ready for this exiled family, it\r\nswarms in a tree or any other good place it happens to find."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Betty; "but do the workers have to work all the time?"\r\n\r\n"They do everything except the egg-laying. All the pollen and honey\r\nmust be brought into the hive by them. Have you ever seen the little\r\nbaskets which working bees have for carrying pollen? Perhaps you do not\r\nknow what pollen is. Well, some day look right down in the centre of a\r\nflower and you will find some fine yellow powder. That is pollen, or bee\r\nbread, and the bees are very fond of it. On the hind leg of the worker\r\nis a nice smooth place, and on each side of it are stiff, curved hairs\r\nwhich cover it over. Into this little cage the bees push the pollen,\r\nthen fly swiftly away toward the hive. Here this heavily laden little\r\nfellow stands over one of the rooms and pushes the pollen off his hind\r\nlegs by scraping with his middle legs.\r\n\r\n"You have eaten honey, and know how thick and sweet it is. Very unlike\r\nthe sweetened water in the flower-cups, isn\'t it? The bees make this\r\nhoney out of the watery nectar, and I will tell you how they do it. The\r\nbee sips this sweet nectar into its mouth, then the nectar goes down a\r\ntiny tube into a little pouch called the honey sac. This sac opens into\r\nthe stomach, but between the two are little lips which guard the\r\nentrance. If the worker is hungry the little lips open, and the nectar\r\ngoes from the honey sac into the stomach. But if it wants to carry it\r\nback to the hive the lips stay tightly closed. When the honey sac is\r\nfull the worker flies back to the hive and empties it into one of the\r\nrooms.\r\n\r\n"Then a number of bees stand with their heads bent downward and move\r\ntheir wings just as fast as they can, looking like miniature electric\r\nfans. Of course they grow very warm, and this makes the hive warm. This\r\nwarm air evaporates the extra water in the nectar, and soon the honey is\r\nall finished. These bees which beat the air so tirelessly keep the hive\r\nfresh and sweet, which is very necessary when so many bees live in one\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n"The workers make the cells as well as fill them, and now a very queer\r\nthing happens. A great many bees eat a great deal of honey. They eat all\r\nthey can hold, then crawl up to the top of the hive. There are as many\r\nthere as can find room; the rest hang on to these until a curtain of\r\nbees is formed. Sometimes they hang quietly and patiently for several\r\ndays until, on the under side of the abdomen, tiny shining plates of wax\r\nappear. Other workers break off these pieces of wax and build them up\r\ninto cells. You know how big a pound is, don\'t you? Well, just think how\r\nmany, many times the bees must carry honey to the hives when I tell you\r\nthat twenty-one pounds of honey will make but one pound of wax. Bees are\r\nvery economical with their wax. When they have to patch up holes and\r\nfill in cracks in their hives they do it with a gum which they scrape\r\noff sticky buds.\r\n\r\n"All summer long these workers are laying in food to keep this large\r\nfamily during the cold weather. If for any reason the supply of food is\r\nlow the workers sting the babies to death rather than have them starve.\r\nIs it any wonder that these workers, who have so much to do and so many\r\ncares from morning until night, die very young? The queen may live for\r\ntwo or three years, but the workers do not live longer than six or eight\r\nweeks."\r\n\r\n"Goodness me!" said Jimmie, "I wouldn\'t have believed there was any\r\ninsect on the face of the earth as clever as those bees! If insects were\r\nall like that, I\'d want to know about every one of them. Can\'t you tell\r\nus something of the wasp? They must be clever fellows, too."\r\n\r\n"Not to-day," answered Ben Gile; "it is getting toward noon, and we must\r\nstart home for dinner and to get our partridge cooked. Pick up the\r\nbirds, Jack, and put them in your game-bag. We must be off."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV\r\n\r\nLEAVING CAMP\r\n\r\n\r\nAt last the day had come, and the children were to leave\r\nCamp-in-the-Clouds. They had been there for one whole glorious week of\r\nfishing, hunting, camping, picnicing, stories, and sleeping in tents.\r\nBetty and Jimmie felt rather sober, for the time for them to go back to\r\nthe city was drawing near. A week now, and their good times for the\r\nsummer would be over. Already the leaves were turning a little, and the\r\nair growing crisper every day. Indeed, up in Camp-in-the-Clouds they had\r\ntwice in the early morning to break the ice on the spring in order to\r\nget the water, and at night the blankets felt warm and cosey. Betty and\r\nJimmie liked their city home, and after they were once in it they\r\nenjoyed their school work, too. They had many friends, entertainments,\r\nparties, and made many expeditions to the Zoo and to the parks. But,\r\nsomehow, the happiest days of all the year came in the summer in\r\nRangeley Village. Every hour seemed precious to them now, and the\r\nfingers on Betty\'s right hand--the number of days that were left--were\r\nall too few. Even Jimmie, who cared less for the country than Betty did,\r\nwas sorry. And the children were sorry to have them go. All through the\r\ncold, white winter in Rangeley Village they were expecting the Reece\r\nchildren and the old guide. With their coming, good times began again.\r\n\r\nAnd this morning, on which they were leaving camp, they felt rather\r\nblue, for, although they expected to come back the next summer, as\r\nindeed they did, yet it seemed such a long, long time to wait! They\r\nfollowed Ben Gile single file down the mountain at a good pace, but\r\nwithout saying very much. By noon they had reached the Dead River Ponds,\r\nand were ready for luncheon.\r\n\r\n"I think some of that birch, Tom," said Ben Gile, "would make a good\r\nfire for us."\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n_A._ Feeding the baby wasps.\r\n_B._ A grown-up wasp.]\r\n\r\nTom, who was a famous woodchopper in winter, went off toward the tree,\r\nfollowed by lazy little Peter, who loved to see others work. Soon the\r\nchips were flying right and left. Suddenly there was a yell from Peter.\r\nTom dropped his axe. Ben Gile hurried over to the boy, and the others\r\ncrowded around. Tom was sure a splinter had gone into Peter\'s eye. The\r\nlad was holding on to his eye, and jumping up and down with pain. But as\r\nBen Gile was trying to make the boy take his hand away, Tom exclaimed,\r\ngrabbed one hand with the other, and made for the pond. "It\'s hornets,\r\nBen!" he called; and before the others could say anything he had clapped\r\nsome mud on his own hand and brought mud for Peter\'s eye, which he\r\npoulticed with this useful material, and tied around it a big white\r\nhandkerchief. Although Peter did not in the least like the bite, yet he\r\nfelt rather proud of the bandage, and for the first time in his life he,\r\ntoo, wanted to know about the creatures who could give so much pain.\r\n\r\n"Tell us, sir," the children cried, "about the wasps while dinner is\r\ncooking."\r\n\r\nSo Ben Gile, who had left the cooking to the other guides, gathered the\r\nchildren and Mrs. Reece about him, and began: "One day last fall I saw,\r\nhigh up in a tree near the pond, the pretty, gray nest of Mrs.\r\nVespa-Wasp. It did not look like a real house, with windows in it and\r\nsteps leading up to it. But there it hung, swinging in the bare\r\nbranches, its walls of pretty, soft gray blending so beautifully with\r\nthe pale-blue sky.\r\n\r\n"I wondered whether any of the wasp family was at home, but the house\r\nwas too high for me to reach, so I went away to find a long pole with\r\nwhich to knock. With my long pole I knocked gently at first, then louder\r\nand louder, but no one stirred within. So I poked harder, trying to\r\nbreak off a strong branch which ran straight through the top of the\r\nhouse. At last it broke off, and down came the gray house almost into my\r\narms.\r\n\r\n"It was big and round, like a Japanese lantern. Guess of what it was\r\nmade? Just paper. But not our kind of paper; it was wasp-paper. Mrs.\r\nVespa and her family make this paper out of wood-pulp, which they get by\r\nscraping off the weathered wood from trees and fences. Of course this\r\nold wood is of various colors, but that makes the house so much the\r\nprettier. One wasp comes back with its burden of woody pulp rolled up in\r\na little pellet. This it takes and spreads in thin ribbons along the\r\nedge of the wall which is being made. Perhaps this edge is dark gray.\r\nThen off it flies for more material, while another takes its place with\r\na pellet of light gray, which is soon skilfully moulded on to the edge.\r\nSometimes the outer wall consists of several layers of this wasp-paper,\r\nwhich is strong and waterproof. Within the wall are many stories of\r\ncone, built like different floors in our own houses.\r\n\r\n"Early in the spring Mrs. Vespa-Wasp, who has been passing the cold\r\nwinter days tucked away in a warm crevice somewhere, comes out and finds\r\na site for her summer home. She begins this as a very small and simple\r\none, starting with just a few rooms fastened to the branch of a tree.\r\nHere she lays an egg in each little room, then brings in food for the\r\nnew baby wasps which are in the making. The kind of food which is stored\r\naway depends upon the kind of wasps. Some like beetles, some spiders,\r\nsome caterpillars, and others grasshoppers and cicadas.\r\n\r\n"As in the bee family, the first children are all workers, because Mrs.\r\nVespa-Wasp needs assistance in building up the home and feeding the\r\nchildren. This first home is small, not nearly large enough for the\r\ngrowing family, so new rooms must be built at once. These are added on\r\nto the first ones until there is a good-sized layer of them. If Mrs.\r\nWasp should go on making this upper story larger and larger, it would be\r\nbuffeted about by the wind and rain, and perhaps broken. So the family\r\nstarts a second story under the first. On the under side of the top\r\nfloor some of the cells are broken away and a stem is made to start the\r\nnext floor, and so on, until there are four or five combs in the house.\r\nThey are always building the house over, tearing down the walls to make\r\nroom for new floors; but this does not make the house unsafe in the mean\r\ntime, as the walls are not connected with the floors, but form a loose\r\nenvelope about them.\r\n\r\n"Later in the season, after the family has become very large, some of\r\nthe upper cells are torn out, making a nice, warm attic, where the\r\nfamily may go to keep out of the wind and rain. They dislike the cold\r\nand wet very much.\r\n\r\n"I carried this big house to my cabin with me, so that I might look it\r\nover and see just how it was arranged. Very carefully I cut away a\r\nlittle of the outer wall until I had a place large enough to look\r\nthrough. Guess what I saw lying cuddled down in many of these rooms?\r\nLittle, soft, white baby wasps. When the Vespa family are grown up they\r\nare called hornets, and Peter and Tom know how hornets sting! I was not\r\nafraid of the babies, but was not sure that all the old wasps were out.\r\nIt was a cold day, and wasps get stiff very quickly, so I watched\r\ncarefully to see whether the warm air of the room would not limber up\r\nsome stiff joints which were perhaps in hiding up-stairs in the house.\r\nSure enough, in a few moments out crawled a worker, looking quite dazed\r\nand sheepish at the change in temperature. I did not wait for it to\r\nbecome thoroughly awake, but picked it up with the forceps and put it\r\nout of the window. I was kept busy, for twenty-five old fellows walked\r\nout, thinking, no doubt, that they had made a mistake in the season, and\r\nthat it was not time, after all, for them to die. All the wasp family,\r\nexcept the queens, expect to die, and do die in the autumn.\r\n\r\n"I could not find either flies or spiders for the babies, and even if\r\nthere had been a few about I could not have used them, as there was no\r\nworker wasp to chew them soft and fine for them. So I made a nice,\r\nappetizing syrup of sugar and water, and found that young wasps were as\r\neager for sweets as little children are. They worked their baby mouths\r\nbusily as long as I had the patience to feed them. When the Vespa family\r\nare grown up they eat honey dew from the little aphids, fruit juice, and\r\nthe nectar from flowers, or, if fortune favors them, they may gain\r\nentrance to Mrs. Honey-Bee\'s home, and feast from her well-filled\r\nhoneycombs. But the babies all eat insects which their mothers put in\r\nthe little rooms beside the eggs.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Polistes is a cousin of Mrs. Vespa. She is long and slender, while\r\nMrs. Vespa is rather broad. Her house is a much simpler affair. It has\r\njust one layer of rooms suspended by a stem from the under side of a\r\nporch, or maybe the eaves, of a house."\r\n\r\n"Are there solitary wasps," asked Jimmie, "just as there are solitary\r\nbees?"\r\n\r\n"Many wasps prefer to live alone rather than in a big house with\r\nhundreds of others. They are like bees in their cleverness, knowing how\r\nto tunnel in wood, dig deep pits in the ground, or make nests of mud.\r\nMr. Kellogg, a very wise man, and young to be so wise, tells of one\r\ninteresting little wasp, called the thread-waisted sand-digger, which\r\nlives in California in the salt-marshes. These marshes are covered by\r\nplants, but in between are little smooth places covered with a\r\nglistening crust of salt. It is in these open spots that Mrs.\r\nSand-Digger makes her home. She has strong jaws, and with these she cuts\r\nout a neat little circle of salty crust. Then she begins to dig a\r\ntunnel, humming away to herself all the time. After the hole is ready\r\nshe very carefully backs out of it and puts a circular door on.\r\n\r\n"Then she flies away to find food to store up for her children. These\r\nbabies like tender, green inch-worms, so Mrs. Digger-Wasp hunts around\r\nuntil she finds a fat one, and then proceeds to paralyze it, so that it\r\nwill stay quietly in the house until the babies are ready to eat it, for\r\nbaby digger-wasps are little cannibals, preferring living caterpillars\r\nto any pre-digested spiders or flies. It is very wonderful that Mrs.\r\nDigger-Wasp knows where to sting a caterpillar in order to paralyze it\r\nand yet not kill it. But she does. Perhaps you remember that insects\r\nhave knots of nerve cells, connected by nerve threads, extending from\r\none end of the body to the other? Jimmie remembers that I pinched him to\r\nillustrate this point. The knot on the top of the food-tubes is the\r\nbrain, then underneath there are usually three in the thorax and several\r\nin the abdomen. Well, Mrs. Digger-Wasp stings one or more of these\r\nlittle knots, which we call ganglia. That paralyzes the young inch-worm,\r\nso that it becomes limp and helpless, but still lives. Then Mrs. Wasp\r\npicks it up and carries it to her house, and packs it in the bottom of\r\nthe tunnel.\r\n\r\n"After putting in five or ten she lays an egg, fastening it on the body\r\nof one of the worms. She backs out of the tunnel, and flies off to\r\ncollect balls of dirt. With these she fills up the tunnel completely.\r\nCarefully she puts the little round door on. One day some one saw her do\r\na curious thing. She wished to be very sure that the door was fast shut.\r\nPerhaps it did not fit well. So she found a tiny pebble, held it in her\r\njaws, and hammered the door down with it. Wasn\'t that a clever thing for\r\na wasp to do? The door closed, this is all the attention she gives to\r\nbaby digger-wasps. She has put in plenty of food, even for the hungriest\r\nlarva. Now it must look out for itself, eat, grow fat and strong, and\r\nthen dig its way out into the salt-marsh.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Eumenes is a good-looking little wasp dressed in black and yellow.\r\nShe is a mason, making a pretty mud vase for a home. The clay, or mud,\r\nshe moistens, then moulds it, little by little, into the vase, which she\r\nfastens on to a twig. Some mud-daubers make small cylinders placed side\r\nby side. Into these they put stung spiders, after tearing off their legs\r\nto make sure they will not recover and run away before the eggs hatch.\r\nSometimes the mud-daubers plaster up the keyholes in a house, and so\r\nhave snug homes.\r\n\r\n"One day last summer, as I was sitting outside my cabin, I noticed a\r\nwasp carrying something green in its mouth. It came close to my head,\r\nthen finally crawled up under the shingles on the side wall. All the\r\nafternoon it came and went, each time bringing something green. The next\r\nafternoon I was loading my guns, and had put a hollow gun-barrel on a\r\ntable at my side. Soon I heard a whir of insect wings, and there, on the\r\ntable, was my wasp friend. It walked up and down, examining very\r\ncarefully the hollow barrel, then cautiously it crawled in. In about\r\nfive minutes it crawled out again and flew away. Soon it was back with a\r\npiece of green in its mouth. It crawled into the barrel and left the\r\ngreen. Six times the wasp did this; then my curiosity became so great I\r\ncould wait no longer. When she flew away I tapped the barrel on the\r\ntable and emptied out six little green worms, all limp and still. But\r\nMrs. Wasp was back again, and I guiltily withdrew. She had brought the\r\nseventh worm, and when she saw the six lying on the table she was much\r\npuzzled. She went around and poked each one to see whether it was limp,\r\nfearing, perhaps, that she had not stung them hard enough; but, finding\r\nthem helpless, she picked them up one by one and patiently carried them\r\nback into the gun-barrel. Three times I emptied them out, and three\r\ntimes she put them back, then flew away, never to return. I suppose the\r\nlast time she went in she laid the egg among the little worms, and then,\r\nher duty done, was off to find another good place to start a family.\r\n\r\n"Have you ever seen a big cicada which makes the long, rasping sound in\r\nthe trees? Some wasps like these very much for food. So, when cicada\r\nsings, Mrs. Wasp swoops down on it, stings it, and then, big and clumsy\r\nas it is, carries it to her home for her children to feast upon."\r\n\r\n"A cicada is three or four times as large as a wasp, isn\'t it?" asked\r\nMrs. Reece.\r\n\r\n"Yes; but there is nothing the wasps can\'t do," replied Ben Gile.\r\n\r\n"I should think not!" exclaimed Peter, who by this time was able to\r\nsmile again.\r\n\r\n"The trout are ready, Ben," said Adam, "and everything else, too, I\r\nguess."\r\n\r\nWith running and laughter the children were soon about the fire, eating\r\ntheir last delicious out-of-door dinner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI\r\n\r\nEYES AND NO EYES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe evening party at Ben Gile\'s cabin was to be the last of all the\r\nbeautiful summer, for the next day Betty and Jimmie were to leave with\r\ntheir mother for the city, and this was the evening which was to decide\r\nwho was to receive the prize.\r\n\r\nBetty had been working very hard for it, and wanted it. But Jimmie\r\ncouldn\'t see any use in lying with your nose on an ant-hill. As for\r\nPeter, he giggled whenever ants were mentioned to him, and seemed not to\r\ncare much one way or another. Hope, however, was often with Betty, and\r\nthe two girls, flat on the grass, tried to discover as many mysteries as\r\nthey could about the busy little fellows. As for Jack, he was as busy as\r\nthe ants, following them about, lying quietly for hours, and borrowing\r\nany book he could find that would tell about them. It seemed to him that\r\nif he could have that magnifying-glass, that book of colored plates,\r\nand the five-dollar gold piece, he would be the richest boy in all the\r\nworld! He thought about it by night and by day, and he was certain that\r\nwith the insect book and the glass, he should discover things nobody\r\nelse in the world had ever seen.\r\n\r\nThe poor boy was trembling with eagerness on this evening of the party\r\nat the guide\'s cabin. The children took their turn in telling what they\r\nknew. Peter giggled, and said they seemed to lug a good deal of food.\r\nJimmie said they ran in and out of their ant hills very fast, and knew\r\nhow to build big hills. Hope was so frightened that, when it came her\r\nturn, the child could not tell even the little she knew.\r\n\r\nBut Betty, who loved everything in the out-of-door world, forgot herself\r\nand her fright in the true love which she had for natural history. She\r\nsaid she had spent hours in a neighborhood of ants, near the doorways\r\nthey had in the ground. Some of the doorways were large, and some were\r\nsmall, and the little ants who went in and out of the doors carried off\r\nthe pieces of cake she fed to them. Sometimes the crumbs were three or\r\nfour times as big as the ants. She had seen two little ants attack a\r\nlarge piece of cake, but it proved too much for them, so one mounted\r\nguard over it while the other scurried off. In a few moments it came\r\nback with a whole squad of ants, who surrounded the cake and pushed and\r\npulled with all their might. They actually got it to the door, Betty\r\nsaid, and after that she could see it no more. Then Betty spoke a little\r\nwistfully: "If only I had been an ant I could have gone down after it. I\r\ncould have seen what they did with it, sir."\r\n\r\n"Well, my dear," said Ben Gile, "if you want to see what they do, start\r\na colony of them some day in a glass case. That will solve a good many\r\nof your problems. And now, what else?"\r\n\r\n"I saw them doing a good deal that was interesting, sir, but I couldn\'t\r\nunderstand it."\r\n\r\n"It\'s your turn, Jack. We will come back to Betty by-and-by."\r\n\r\n"I found out, sir, that in every ant colony there are always three kinds\r\nof ants--the queens, the males, and the workers. It\'s much like what you\r\ntold us of the bees. And it seemed to me, sir, every time I looked at\r\nthem, that they were happy together, busy with their work and never\r\nquarrelling with one another. I suppose they were happy because each one\r\nhad some special work to do. I looked it all up in the books, and I\r\nfound that some are born queens, to be waited on, while others are born\r\nworkers, to do the serving. But they are all contented.\r\n\r\n"The queen ant is not a real queen ruling a little kingdom; she is the\r\nmother ant, and lays all the eggs. She is well cared for and protected\r\nby the workers. These are the active little ants who do the work. They\r\nare happy, too, running about, digging new passageways, clearing the\r\npaths to their front doors, and bringing in food, which they store in\r\ntheir granaries. Some ants, sir, build their tunnels very deep\r\nunderground. A doorway opens into a wide gallery, from which others\r\nbranch and wind their way down into the dark ground. Sometimes they\r\nbuild a high mound around the entrance, and often a large colony will\r\nhave many such mounds."\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n_A._ Honey ant.\r\n_B._ Ants exchanging greetings.]\r\n\r\n"Some ants," added Ben Gile, "dig out their homes in dead logs or hollow\r\nstems. I know of one little fellow who is clever enough to build a shed.\r\nIt hunts around to find decayed wood. This it chews into a fine pulp,\r\nthen spreads it out into a roof; sometimes it is a good-sized roof. This\r\nsame ant dearly loves the honeydew which aphids secrete. So in order to\r\nprotect these helpless little green bugs, and make them as comfortable\r\nand contented as possible, they build a neat shed over them. When the\r\nants wish a dainty luncheon of honeydew they crawl up under the little\r\nshed and get a drink of this sweet juice. Although a colony of ants\r\nlives together so peacefully, Jack, they are apt to be very quarrelsome\r\nwith their neighbors; often they go to war with another colony if the\r\nmembers of that colony happen to trespass on their grounds."\r\n\r\n"I found out about some naughty, lazy ants, sir. Instead of taking care\r\nof their own homes and hunting up their own food, they go out to war\r\nagainst another kind of ant, which is living quietly and attending to\r\nits own business. All the grown-up ants these little fighters either\r\nkill or frighten so that they run away as fast and as far as their legs\r\nwill carry them. Then these lazy ants steal the eggs and the babies.\r\nSome of them they eat on the way home, but most of them they carry to\r\ntheir underground galleries. There they take good care of them until\r\nthey are grown up. Then these stolen babies become the slaves of the\r\nlazy ants; but the poor little slaves have never known any other life,\r\nso they cheerfully serve their masters, doing everything for them; in\r\nfact, so long have these masters had little slaves to wait upon them\r\nthat they do not know at all how to look out for themselves. They have\r\nbeen known to starve to death rather than to feed themselves."\r\n\r\n"But there are many respectable ants," objected Ben Gile, "and I will\r\ntell you how a well-regulated household behaves. One day last summer,\r\nwhen I was walking in the afternoon, I found myself suddenly surrounded\r\nby a cloud of winged insects--thousands and thousands of them. I caught\r\none of them and found that it was a winged ant, for the males and queens\r\nhave wings with which to fly away on their wedding journey. This journey\r\nlasts only a short time, and usually many colonies fly up together in\r\nthe bright summer air. The wedding journey is a picnic for hungry birds.\r\nJust think of finding such a mass of juicy morsels at one time. They fly\r\ninto the crowd and eat as many of the ants as they can. But many escape.\r\nAt last they become exhausted. The males fall to the ground and die. The\r\nqueens break off their wings, because they never need them after the\r\nwedding journey.\r\n\r\n"They look about for a good place to start a new home. The first thing\r\nthe queen does is to lay her eggs in a neat little pile. These soon\r\nhatch out into larv\xc3\xa6; tiny, worm-like grubs without any legs. Queen\r\nants feed their babies faithfully with nice, tender insects, which they\r\nchew for them. Sometimes these larv\xc3\xa6 spin a tiny cocoon, in which\r\nthey lie quietly while they are being made over into ants--perhaps into\r\na queen, like the mother, or a male, like the father; perhaps into a\r\nworker, which is the mainstay of the whole colony. This first family of\r\nbabies the queen mother must look out for herself, but just as soon as\r\nthe baby workers are grown up it is their turn to help her.\r\n\r\n"The first set of workers are very small. From morning until night they\r\nare busy. Early in the morning they must go out for food, to catch\r\ninsects for the queen\'s breakfast and for the queen\'s baby ants. To be\r\nsure, it does not take long to prepare this meal, as it is chewed for\r\nthe babies instead of cooked. Then the house must be set to rights,\r\nextra grains of sand must be cleared out of the paths and galleries.\r\nPerhaps some careless little girl or boy may have stepped on the mound\r\naround the entrance and crushed it. The workers hurry to clear away the\r\nruins, and soon have a new mound neatly piled up. Tell us, Jack, what\r\nyou know about these workers."\r\n\r\nJack\'s face was bright with eagerness. "Well, sir, in ant homes there\r\nare always babies, lots of them, just as in other homes. These little\r\nlarv\xc3\xa6 must be fed often and kept clean. The workers are the nurses as\r\nwell as housekeepers. If the babies happen to be in a cool, damp part of\r\nthe house they must be carried into a warmer, drier place. So the\r\nworkers pick them up and take them out for an airing. Often they carry\r\nthe little cocoons out into the warm sunshine or move them about from\r\nplace to place. In some families of ants there are some with very big\r\nheads and strong jaws. These are the soldiers. If there is any trouble\r\nin their village these big-headed fellows go out as scouts or act as\r\nsentinels around the ant-hill. But the head of the worker is rather\r\nsmall. It\'s a clever head, though, sir. On it are two antenn\xc3\xa6,\r\nbent, sir, like sharp little elbows. You told us that ants talk with\r\ntheir antenn\xc3\xa6. These feelers are very sensitive. I watched two ants\r\none day and saw them rubbing them together."\r\n\r\n"I am sure," said Ben Gile, "that some very exciting and interesting\r\nconversations are carried on by these fellows."\r\n\r\n"Back of the head," continued Jack, "is the thorax, with the six legs,\r\nthen a very narrow piece joining the thorax and abdomen."\r\n\r\n"I know of one ant," added the guide, "who is nothing more or less than\r\na honey-jar. This honey-ant hangs by its legs from the roof of its home.\r\nThe little workers go out and visit the oak-trees and hunt around for\r\nballs called oak galls. From these they get honey, which they carry home\r\nand feed to the little fellows hanging on the ceiling by their heels.\r\nThe honey is stored away in their crops. All day these honey-jar ants\r\nare fed, until the abdomens are as big as a currant, and the sweet,\r\nyellow honey shines through the skin. When any of the family gets hungry\r\nit crawls up to one of these fat little fellows and takes a refreshing\r\nsip."\r\n\r\n"I know of another ant," began Jack, who could scarcely wait to begin,\r\n"who lives in the home of a larger ant. This one builds small tunnels\r\nconnected with the large ones of the big ant, but is careful to make the\r\ndoorways so small that the big ones cannot creep in and eat up the\r\nbabies. When Little Ant gets hungry it crawls up on Big Ant\'s back. Very\r\ngently it strokes its head, then licks its cheek until the mouth of Big\r\nAnt fairly waters. This is just what Little Ant intends the mouth shall\r\ndo. It laps up the drop of sweetness, crawls down, climbs on the back of\r\nanother big ant, and has a second luncheon. Sometimes little thief ants\r\nlive in other ants\' houses, stealing the food which the workers have\r\nbeen so busy collecting all the long day."\r\n\r\nBy this time the children were listening in open-eyed astonishment to\r\nJack, who had absorbed so much of the spirit and the information of the\r\nold guide that he could talk almost as interestingly.\r\n\r\n"Mother aphids," interrupted Ben Gile, "who like corn very well, lay\r\ntheir eggs at the roots of the corn. But if the babies hatch out before\r\nthe corn roots are ready there is a family of ants who come to the\r\nrescue. They carry these babies over to some other roots, where they may\r\nfeed until the corn roots grow. Later they carry them carefully back\r\nagain. Of course, they do not do this because they care for the welfare\r\nof the aphids, but because they know if the little corn lice have plenty\r\nto eat they themselves will have plenty of honeydew, which they love."\r\n\r\n"And there\'s a harvester, sir, who builds a big mound around its front\r\ndoor and carefully clears away the grass. Into the long galleries of its\r\nhome it carries a great many seeds, and stores them away. All the chaff\r\nand hard parts which it cannot eat it carries out again."\r\n\r\n"Leading up to the big mound," added Ben Gile, "are clear pathways as\r\ndistinct as any path you or I make through the grassy fields. Perhaps\r\nants are too little to do very much thinking, but they do many things\r\nwhich you and I would have to think about a long time before we should\r\nbe able to do them. They have a good government which runs along without\r\nfriction. They can build roads, dig tunnels, spin silken webs, build\r\nsheds, go to war, harvest grain into the storehouses, and keep a farm of\r\naphids."\r\n\r\nBy the time the old guide had finished Betty was waving her hand the way\r\nshe did in school. "Please, sir, I don\'t know half as much as Jack does.\r\nHe has told all I know, and more, too."\r\n\r\nBen Gile smiled at Betty, for he was very fond of her. He stroked his\r\nwhite beard, and went on smiling as if he had some pleasant thought in\r\nthe back of his head. "Well, now, we must decide who has won the prize.\r\nMrs. Reece, what do you think?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Reece was proud of her Betty, and would rather have had her the\r\ngenerous little girl she was than have her win all the prizes in the\r\nworld. "I think Jack has abundantly earned the prize."\r\n\r\n"And now, children, what do you think?"\r\n\r\n"Jack!" they all shouted.\r\n\r\n"Jack," said the guide, bringing forward three parcels, "here is the\r\nfive-dollar gold piece--this will help you buy what you need; here is\r\nthe book, which will help you to identify what you see; and here is the\r\nmagnifying-glass. Remember, my boy, as you look through it, that it is\r\nGod\'s work you are seeing. We have been through the old story of \'Eyes\r\nand No Eyes\' with you boys. Peter, I\'m afraid, goes out and sees\r\nnothing. You, Jack, have used your eyes, and already you have learned\r\nmuch that ought to make you a wiser man. As you look through the glass\r\nit is well to reflect that you will never see a cathedral window as\r\nbeautiful as some wings you look upon, from the clear lights of the\r\ncicada\'s wing to the gorgeous dyes of the moth. You will never see groin\r\nor arch or hinge more wonderful than the covers of a wing or the\r\nexquisite joint of some little insect. You may travel the world over\r\nbefore you can find, made by man\'s hand, such mystery and beauty as lie\r\nabout you in the natural world. All the dynasties of Egypt could not\r\nshape the scale on a moth\'s wing. All the religion of the past can shape\r\nnothing that will do the Creator so much reverence as the world He has\r\ncreated, the world we have about us. There, my boy, that is a long\r\nsermon, but you will profit by it, for the world will hear of you yet.\r\n\r\n"And now there\'s a little girl in this room who has worked faithfully to\r\nfind out what she could. She is five years younger than you, Jack, and I\r\nwant her to have something, too."\r\n\r\nFor a minute Jack looked troubled; then he said, resolutely, "Let me\r\ngive her my book, sir."\r\n\r\n"No, no, Jack," replied Ben Gile, pleased with the lad\'s generosity. "I\r\nhave an extra book here." Betty\'s face was beaming. "Now let me write in\r\nyour books; then to supper, around our last camp-fire for this summer."\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes the children were about the fire, and there was the\r\nsmell of roasting corn, the sizzle of broiling partridge tied around\r\nwith bacon, and the fragrance of coffee for the older people. The\r\nfirelight seemed particularly jolly. Betty was very happy with her book\r\n(nor would she be parted from it the next day on the train), and Jack\r\nwas radiant. They ate and talked and sang about the camp-fire, thought\r\nBen Gile the wisest man in the world, Mrs. Reece the kindest of mothers,\r\nhoped that next year would come soon, and wanted to know what stories\r\nthey were to hear when the long winter was over.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it will be birds," said the guide; "perhaps fish; perhaps\r\nflowers; maybe it will be spiders and crabs. Next summer is a long way\r\noff. And now I have to go back to my school."\r\n\r\nIn a short time a line of lanterns was seen swinging and dancing up the\r\nhill of Rangeley as the children filed homeward. The summer was over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n***END OF THE PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK LITTLE BUSYBODIES***\r\n\r\n\r\n******* This file should be named 21948-8.txt or 21948-8.zip *******\r\n\r\n\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/1/9/4/21948\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
