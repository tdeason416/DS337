In fact perhaps no term could have been\r\nfound that would have been less appropriate. For Walter King possessed\r\nneither dignity of rank nor of stature. On the contrary he was a\r\nshort, snub-nosed boy of fifteen, the epitome of good humor and\r\ndemocracy.\r\n\r\nHis hair was red and towsled, his face spangled with great golden\r\nfreckles which sea winds and sunshine had multiplied until there was\r\nscarce room for another on his beaming countenance. Hands and arms\r\nwere freckled too, for when one lives in a bathing suit six months of\r\nthe year and is either in the water or on it most of the time the skin\r\nfails to retain its pristine whiteness of hue. But His Highness did\r\nnot care a fig for that. He was far too busy baiting eel and lobster\r\ntraps, mending fish nets, untangling lines, and painting boats to give\r\na thought to his personal beauty.\r\n\r\nIndeed his mother often bewailed the fact that he was not more\r\ninterested in his appearance and there were times when it seemed as if\r\nshe were right. Certainly when her son ambled home at dusk with every\r\nrebellious hair standing upended upon his head and a string of\r\nflounders dripping salt from the tips of their slimy tails she was\r\njustified to a degree in wishing he had more regard for the niceties\r\nof life.\r\n\r\n"Look at the mess you\'re making!" she would pipe indignantly. "I\'ve\r\njust mopped this floor, Walter."\r\n\r\n"You have? Now isn\'t that the dickens! Well, no matter, Ma; I\'ll swab\r\nthe place down again when I\'ve finished cleaning these fish. They\'re\r\nbeauties, aren\'t they? A batch of them fried won\'t go bad for supper\r\nto-night. I\'m hungry as a bear. Shouldn\'t think I\'d eaten anything in\r\nten years. Say, Ma, what do you s\'pose? Dave Corbett was out in the\r\n_Nancy_ three hours and never got a bite. What do you think of that?\r\nThe wind died down, his engine got stalled, and he and Hosey Talbot\r\nhad to row home from the Bell Reef Shoals. Haw, haw! Maybe I didn\'t\r\nroar when I saw them come pulling in against the tide, mad as two\r\nman-eating sharks. Fit to harpoon the first person they met, they\r\nwere. I sung out and asked them were they practicing for the Harvard\r\nand Yale boat race and Dave was that peeved he shied an oarlock after\r\nme. Haw, haw, haw!"\r\n\r\n"You ought not to provoke Dave, Walter."\r\n\r\n"Provoke him? But he was provoked already, Ma. There\'s no harm\r\nputting an extra stick on the fire when it\'s burning, anyhow. Besides,\r\nDave is never in earnest when he bawls me out. He just likes to hear\r\nhimself scold."\r\n\r\n"He has a terrible temper."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know half the town is scart to death of him. But he always will\r\ntake a jolly from me. We understand each other, Dave and I. Say, Ma,\r\nthese rubber boots leak. Did you know that? Yes, siree! They leak like\r\nsieves. I might as well be without \'em."\r\n\r\nMrs. King sighed.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see," murmured she, "how you manage to go through everything\r\nyou have so quickly, Walter. Nothing you wear lasts you more than a\r\nweek."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I say, make it a month. Do, now!"\r\n\r\nHe saw his mother smile faintly.\r\n\r\n"Well, a month then."\r\n\r\n"You couldn\'t stretch it to two?"\r\n\r\n"Not possibly. Four weeks seems to be your limit."\r\n\r\nThe sharpness of her tone, however, had weakened.\r\n\r\n"Four weeks, eh? I did think I\'d had these rubber boots longer than\r\nthat. It is amazing how attached you can get to things even in a\r\nlittle while."\r\n\r\nHolding aloft the knife with which he was preparing to behead the\r\nunlucky flounders, His Highness gazed reflectively down at his feet.\r\n\r\n"It\'s awful that I have to keep having so many things, isn\'t it? I\r\nhate to be costing you money all the time. Now if you\'d only let me\r\nship for the Grand Banks when the _Katie B._ goes out----"\r\n\r\n"Walter! What is the use of digging up that old bone again? I never\r\nshall let you ship for the Grand Banks or any other Banks so long as I\r\nlive. We\'ve had this out hundreds of times before. You know you and\r\nBob are all I\'ve got in the world. Do you suppose I want you lost in a\r\nfog and never heard from again?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Great Scott, Ma! They don\'t lose fishing boats now as they used\r\nto. They carry wireless, and the fleet keeps in touch every minute."\r\n\r\n"The dories have no wireless aboard them," observed Mrs. King grimly.\r\n\r\n"I suppose not, no, probably they don\'t," His Highness admitted\r\nreluctantly.\r\n\r\n"Anyway, wireless or no wireless, you are not going on a fishing\r\ncruise to the Grand Banks."\r\n\r\n"I hear you, Ma," grinned the boy.\r\n\r\n"There is plenty of work right here on the land if you\'re looking for\r\nit. Why must you always be wanting to go to sea to earn money?"\r\n\r\n"Faith, Mother, I don\'t know," laughed Walter. "I expect it\'s because\r\nI see chores to do when I\'m afloat that I can\'t see ashore. It is the\r\nway I was born."\r\n\r\n"A poor way."\r\n\r\n"Maybe it is. At any rate I can\'t help it."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid you do not try to help it very hard."\r\n\r\nThe lad shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n"There\'s that chance you have to hire out at the Crowninshields\' for\r\nthe summer."\r\n\r\n"Those snobs."\r\n\r\n"Beggars cannot be choosers. Besides, they may not be snobs at all.\r\nWhat makes you think they are?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t mind the lugs they put on," protested Walter, evading the\r\nissue. "I suppose all New York swells do that. It\'s what they want me\r\nfor that gets my goat." Again the knife he held was tragically\r\nupraised. "How would you like to be nursemaid to six or eight\r\nbrainless little pups no bigger than rats? Not but what I like dogs.\r\nI\'d like nothing better than to own a fine dog of some spirit. But\r\nthose imitations! Why, before a week was out, I\'d have their necks\r\nwrung."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Crowninshield promised to pay you well."\r\n\r\n"What\'s money if all the kids in town are going to josh you?"\r\n\r\n"Money is a good deal when you need it." His mother shook her head\r\ngravely. "Have you ever considered how badly we are in want of money,\r\nWalter?"\r\n\r\n"What do you mean, Ma?" The boy wheeled about, startled.\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t said anything about it, dear, because I could not bear to\r\nhave you boys bothered," was the quiet answer. "But lately things have\r\nnot been going well and I have been pretty much worried. The money\r\nyour Uncle Henry invested for us isn\'t paying any dividends; there\r\nseems to be something the matter with the company\'s affairs. As for\r\nyour Uncle Mark Miller, I\'ve heard nothing from him in months. His\r\nship was to put in at Shanghai for cargo and I ought to have had a\r\nletter by now; but none has come and I am afraid something must be the\r\ntrouble. He is a good brother and never fails to send me money. I can\r\nill afford to be without help now when the mortgage is coming due and\r\nI have so many bills to meet. It takes a deal of money to live\r\nnowadays. You boys do not realize that."\r\n\r\n"Why, I had no idea you were fussed, Mother, and I\'m sure Bob hadn\'t\r\neither," declared Walter soberly.\r\n\r\n"Then I have done better than I thought I had," returned his mother,\r\nwith the shadow of a smile. "I wanted to keep it secret if I could."\r\n\r\n"But you shouldn\'t have tried to keep it a secret, Mater dear," Walter\r\nreplied. "I\'m sure we\'d rather know--at least I would."\r\n\r\n"But what use is it?"\r\n\r\n"Use? Why, all the use in the world, Ma. I shall go ahead and take Mr.\r\nCrowninshield\'s job for one thing."\r\n\r\n"But you said----"\r\n\r\n"Shucks! I was only fooling about the dogs, Mother. I shan\'t really\r\nmind exercising and taking care of them at all. Of course, I won\'t\r\ndeny I\'d rather they were Great Danes or police dogs; I\'d even prefer\r\nAiredales or Cockers. Still I suppose these little mopsey Pekingese\r\nmust have some brains or the Lord would not have made them. No doubt I\r\nshall get used to them in time."\r\n\r\n"It is only for the summer vacation anyway, you know," ventured his\r\nmother. "The Crowninshields go back to New York in October."\r\n\r\n"I certainly ought to be able to bear up a few months," laughed\r\nWalter, with a ludicrously wry twist of his mouth. "I hate to think\r\nyou\'ve been bothered and have been keeping it all to yourself."\r\n\r\n"Misery does like company," Mrs. King returned with an unsteady laugh.\r\n"I believe I feel better already for having told you. But you must not\r\nworry, dear. We shall pull through all right, I guess. How I came to\r\nspeak of it I don\'t know. It was only that it seemed such a pity to\r\ntoss the Crowninshield offer aside without even considering it. Nobody\r\nknows where it might end. The village people say Mr. Crowninshield is\r\na very generous man, especially if he takes a fancy to anybody."\r\n\r\n"But he may not take a fancy to me."\r\n\r\n"He must have done so already to be asking you to help with the dogs."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, Ma! Did you think Mr. Crowninshield picked me out himself?\r\nWhy, he\'s never laid eyes on me. That great privilege is still in\r\nstore for him. No, he simply told Jerry Thomas, the caretaker, to find\r\nsomebody for the job before the family arrived. He doesn\'t care a darn\r\nwho it is so long as he has a person who can be trusted with his\r\npriceless pups. Why, I heard the other day that a dealer from New York\r\nhad offered five thousand dollars for the smallest one."\r\n\r\n"Walter!"\r\n\r\n"Straight goods!"\r\n\r\n"Five thousand dollars for a dog!" gasped Mrs. King.\r\n\r\nHer son chuckled at her incredulity.\r\n\r\n"Sure!"\r\n\r\n"But it\'s a fortune," murmured she. "I had no idea there was a dog on\r\nearth worth that much."\r\n\r\n"All of them are not."\r\n\r\n"But five thousand dollars!" she repeated. "Why, Walter, I wouldn\'t\r\nhave you responsible for a creature like that for anything in the\r\nworld. You might as well attempt to be custodian of a lot of gold\r\nbonds. I shouldn\'t have a happy moment or sleep a wink thinking of it.\r\nSuppose some of the little wretches were to run away and get lost? Or\r\nsuppose they were to be stolen? Or they might get sick and die on your\r\nhands."\r\n\r\n"That is why they want a responsible person to keep an eye on them."\r\n\r\nHis Highness squared his shoulders and threw out his chest.\r\n\r\n"But you are not a responsible person," burst out Mrs. King with\r\nunflattering candor.\r\n\r\n"Mother!"\r\n\r\n"Well--are you?" she insisted.\r\n\r\nThe boy\'s figure shriveled.\r\n\r\n"No," he confessed frankly, "I\'m afraid I\'m not."\r\n\r\n"Of course you\'re not," continued his mother with the same brutal\r\ntruthfulness. "It isn\'t that you do not mean to be, sonny," added she\r\nkindly. "But your mind wanders off on all sorts of things instead of\r\nthe thing you\'re doing. That is why you do not get on better in\r\nschool. All your teachers say you are bright enough if you only had\r\nsome concentration to back it up. What you can be thinking of all the\r\ntime I cannot imagine; but certainly it isn\'t your lessons."\r\n\r\n"I know," nodded Walter without resentment. "My mind does flop about\r\nlike a kite. I think of everything but what I ought to. It\'s a rotten\r\nhabit."\r\n\r\n"Well, all I can say is you\'d be an almighty poor one to look after a\r\nlot of valuable dogs," sniffed his mother.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll bet I could do it if I set out to."\r\n\r\n"But would you set out to--that is the question? Would you really put\r\nyour entire attention on those dogs so that other people could drop\r\nthem from their minds? That is what taking care means."\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t promise. I could only try."\r\n\r\n"I should never dare to have you undertake it."\r\n\r\n"That settles it, Ma," announced His Highness. "I\'ve evidently got to\r\nprove to you that you are wrong. I\'m going up to Crowninshields\' this\r\nminute to tell Jerry he can count on me from July until October."\r\n\r\n"You\'re crazy."\r\n\r\n"Wait and see."\r\n\r\n"I know what I\'ll see," was the sharp retort. "I shall see all those\r\npuppies kicking up their heels and racing off to Provincetown, and Mr.\r\nCrowninshield insisting that you either find them and bring them back\r\nor pay him what they cost him."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you believe it."\r\n\r\n"That is what will happen," was the solemn prophecy.\r\n\r\n"But you were keen for me to take the job."\r\n\r\n"That was before I knew what the little rats were worth."\r\n\r\n"You just thought it was a cheap sort of a position and that I was to\r\nrace round and make it pleasant for a lot of ordinary curs, didn\'t\r\nyou?" interrogated the lad with mock indignation.\r\n\r\nIn spite of herself his mother smiled.\r\n\r\n"Well, you see you were wrong," went on Walter. "It is not that sort\r\nof thing at all. It is a job for a trustworthy man, Jerry Thomas said,\r\nand will bring in good wages."\r\n\r\n"It ought to," replied his mother sarcastically, "if a person must\r\nspend every day for three months sitting with his eyes glued on those\r\nmites watching every breath they draw."\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t just days, Mother; I\'d have to be there nights as well."\r\n\r\n"_What!_"\r\n\r\n"That\'s what Jerry told me. I\'d have to sleep on the place. Mr.\r\nCrowninshield wants some one there all the time."\r\n\r\n"But Walter----!" Mrs. King broke off in dismay.\r\n\r\n"I know that would mean leaving you alone now that Bob has a regular\r\nposition at the Seaver Bay Wireless station. Still, why should you\r\nmind? I have always been gone all day, anyhow; and at night I sleep so\r\nsoundly that you yourself have often said burglars might carry away\r\nthe bed from under me and I not know it."\r\n\r\n"You are not much protection, that\'s a fact," confessed Mrs. King.\r\n"Fortunately, though, I am not a timid person. It is not that I am\r\nafraid to stay here alone. My chief objection is that it seems foolish\r\nto run a great house like this simply for myself."\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t you get some one to come and keep you company?"\r\n\r\n"Who, I should like to know?"\r\n\r\n"Why--why--well, I haven\'t thought about it. Of course there\'s Aunt\r\nMarcia King."\r\n\r\n"Mercy on us!" exclaimed his mother, instantly flaring up. "I\'d rather\r\nsee the evil one himself put in an appearance than your Aunt Marcia.\r\nOf all the fault-finding, critical, sharp-tongued creatures in the\r\nworld she is the worst. Why, I\'d let burglars carry away every stick\r\nand stone I possess and myself thrown in before I would ask her here\r\nto board."\r\n\r\n"My, Mother! I\'d no idea you had such a temper. You\'re as bad as Dave\r\nCorbett," asserted Walter teasingly.\r\n\r\nHis mother tossed her head but he saw her flush uncomfortably.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you wouldn\'t want a regular boarder," suggested the boy in\r\norder to turn the conversation.\r\n\r\n"A _boarder_!" There was less disapproval than surprise in the\r\nejaculation, however.\r\n\r\n"Lots of people in the town do take summer boarders," added he.\r\n\r\n"The thought never entered my head before," reflected his mother\r\naloud. "There certainly is plenty of room in the house, and we have a\r\nroyal view of the water. Besides, there\'s the garden. Strangers are\r\nalways coming here in vacation time and asking if they may look at it\r\nor sketch it. It never seemed anything very remarkable to me for most\r\nof the flowers have sown themselves and grow like weeds, but of course\r\nthere\'s no denying the hollyhocks, poppies, and larkspur are pretty.\r\nBut visitors always call it wonderful."\r\n\r\n"Most likely you could get a big price if you were to rent rooms."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure I could," replied Mrs. King thoughtfully. "It would help\r\ntoward the mortgage and the other bills, too. I\'ve half a mind to try\r\nit, Walter."\r\n\r\n"It would mean extra work for you."\r\n\r\n"Pooh! What do I care for that? Not a fig! In fact, with both of you\r\nboys away I\'d rather be busy than not," was the quick retort.\r\n\r\n"Do you suppose Bob would mind?"\r\n\r\n"Bob? Why, he\'s seldom at home nowadays. Why should he care?"\r\n\r\n"Aunt Marcia might think----" began the boy mischievously. But the\r\ncomment was cut short.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know what your Aunt Marcia would say," broke in Mrs. King.\r\n"She\'d hold up her hands in horror and announce that it was beneath\r\nthe dignity of the family to take boarders."\r\n\r\nThey both laughed.\r\n\r\n"I believe the very notion of scandalizing her will be what will\r\ndecide me," concluded his mother with finality. "I\'ll put an\r\nadvertisement in the Boston paper to-morrow and see what luck I have.\r\nIf the right people do not turn up, why I don\'t have to take them."\r\n\r\n"Sure you don\'t."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a good plan, a splendid plan, Walter. Boarders will give me\r\ncompany and money too. I wonder it never occurred to me to do it\r\nbefore." Then she patted the lad\'s shoulder, adding playfully, "I\r\nguess if you have brains in one direction you must have them in\r\nanother. Still, as I said before, I do not fancy your being\r\nresponsible for those dogs."\r\n\r\n"Pooh! You quit worrying, Ma, or I shall be sorry I told you they were\r\nblue ribbon pups."\r\n\r\n"I should have heard of it, never fear. You hear of everything in this\r\ntown. You can\'t help it. Like as not everybody in the place will know\r\nby to-morrow morning that I am going to take boarders. Luckily I don\'t\r\ncare--that\'s one good thing. And as to the dogs, if you are resolved\r\nto accept that position all I can say is that you must keep a head on\r\nyour shoulders. You cannot hire out for a job unless you are prepared\r\nto give a full return for the money paid you. It is not honest. So\r\nthink carefully what you mean to do before you embark. And remember,\r\nif you get into some careless scrape you cannot come back on me for\r\nmoney for I haven\'t any to hand over."\r\n\r\n"I shall shoulder my own blame," responded Walter, drawing in his\r\nchin.\r\n\r\n"Well and good then. If you are ready to do that, it is your affair\r\nand I have nothing more to say," announced Mrs. King, preparing to\r\nleave the room.\r\n\r\nBut Walter stayed her on the threshold.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see," he began, "why you always seem to expect I\'m going to\r\nget into a scrape. You are never looking for trouble with Bob."\r\n\r\n"Bob! Bless your heart I never have to! You know that as well as I do.\r\nAny one could trust Bob until the Day of Judgment. He never forgets a\r\nword you tell him. Ask him to do an errand and it is as good as done.\r\nYou can drop it from your mind. From a little child he was dependable\r\nlike that. His teachers couldn\'t say enough about him. Wasn\'t he\r\nalways at the head of his class? The way he\'s turned out is no\r\nsurprise. Think of his picking up wireless enough outside school hours\r\nto get a radio job during the war, and afterward that fine position at\r\nSeaver Bay! Few lads his age could have done it. And think of the\r\nmessages he\'s entrusted with--government work, and sinking ships, and\r\ngoodness knows what not!"\r\n\r\nThe proud mother ceased for lack of breath.\r\n\r\n"I wish I was like Bob," sighed Walter gloomily.\r\n\r\n"Nonsense!" was the instant exclamation. "You\'re yourself, and\r\nscatter-brain as you are, I\'d want you no different. You\'re but a lad\r\nyet. When you are Bob\'s age you may be like him. Who knows?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid not," came dismally from Walter. "I haven\'t started out as\r\nBob did."\r\n\r\n"What if you haven\'t? There\'s time enough to catch up if you hurry.\r\nAnd anyway, I do not want my children all alike. Variety is the spice\r\nof life. I wouldn\'t have you patterned after Bob if I could speak the\r\nword."\r\n\r\n"You wouldn\'t?" the boy brightened.\r\n\r\n"Indeed I wouldn\'t! Who would I be patching torn trousers or darning\r\nripped sweaters for if you were like Bob, I\'d like to know? Who\'d be\r\npestering me to hunt up his cap and mittens? And who would I be frying\r\nclams for?"\r\n\r\n"Bob never could abide clam fritters, could he?" put in the younger\r\nbrother.\r\n\r\n"Bob never had any frivolities," mused Mrs. King, shaking her head.\r\n"Sometimes I\'ve almost wished he had if only to keep the rest of us in\r\ncountenance. Many\'s the time I\'ve feared lest he was going to die he\r\nwas that near perfect."\r\n\r\n"Well, Ma, you haven\'t had to lie awake worrying because I was too\r\ngood for this world, have you?" chuckled His Highness, breaking into a\r\ngrin.\r\n\r\nHis mother regarded him affectionately.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you\'ll make your way too, sonny, some day. It won\'t be as Bob has\r\ndone it; but you\'ll make it nevertheless. Folks are going to do things\r\nfor you simply because they cannot help it."\r\n\r\nThe boy studied her with a puzzled expression.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean, Mater?"\r\n\r\nAs if coming out of a reverie Mrs. King started, the mistiness that\r\nhad softened her eyes vanishing.\r\n\r\n"There! Look at the way you\'ve splashed up my nice clean sink!"\r\ncomplained she tartly. "Did any one ever see such a child--always\r\nmessing up everything! Come, clear out of here and take your fish with\r\nyou. It does seem as if you needed four nursemaids and a valet at your\r\nheels to pick up after you. Be off this minute."\r\n\r\nWith a cloth in one hand and a bar of soap in the other, she elbowed\r\nhim away from the dishpan.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll fry these flounders for supper, won\'t you, Ma?" called the lad\r\nas he disappeared into the shed.\r\n\r\n"Fry \'em? I reckon I\'ll have to. It\'s wicked to catch fish and not use\r\n\'em."\r\n\r\nBut he saw his mother\'s eyes twinkle and her grumbling assent did not\r\ntrouble him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE NEW JOB\r\n\r\n\r\nMay at Lovell\'s Harbor was one of the most beautiful seasons of the\r\nyear. In fact the inhabitants of the town often remarked that they put\r\nup with the winters the small isolated village offered for the sake of\r\nits springs and summers. Certain it was that when easterly storms\r\nswept the marshes and lashed the harbor into foam; when every boat\r\nthat struggled out of the channel returned whitened to the gunwale\r\nwith ice, there was little to induce anybody to take up residence in\r\nthe hamlet. How cold and blue the water looked! How the surf boomed up\r\non the lonely beach and the winds howled and whined around the eaves\r\nof the low cottages!\r\n\r\nOne buttoned himself tightly into a greatcoat then, twisted a muffler\r\nmany times about his neck, pulled his cap over his ears, and rushed\r\nfor school with a velocity that almost equaled the scudding schooners\r\nwhose sails billowed large against the horizon. At least that was what\r\nHis Highness, Walter King, invariably did.\r\n\r\nBut from the instant the breath of spring stole into the air,--ah,\r\nthen Lovell\'s Harbor became a different place altogether. The stems of\r\nthe willows fringing the small fresh-water ponds mellowed to bronze\r\nbefore one\'s very eyes; the dull reaches of salt grass turned emerald;\r\nthe steely tint of the sea softened to azure and glinted golden in the\r\nsun. How shrill sounded the cries of the redwings in the marsh! How\r\njolly the frogs\' twilight chorus!\r\n\r\nThe miracle went on with amazing rapidity. Soon you were scouring the\r\nhollows in the woods for arbutus or splashing bare-legged into the\r\nbogs for cowslips. You even ventured knee-deep into the sea which\r\nalthough still chill was no longer frigid. And then, before you knew\r\nit, you were hauling out your fishing tackle and looking over your\r\nflies; inspecting the old dory and calking her seams with a coat of\r\nfresh paint. Then came the raking of the leaves, the uncovering of the\r\nhollyhocks, and the burning of brush; and through the mists of smoke\r\nthat rose high in air you could hear the resonant chee-ee of the\r\nblackbirds swinging on the reeds along the margin of the creek.\r\n\r\nAnd afterward, when summer had really made its appearance, what days\r\nof blue and gold followed! Was ever sky so cloudless, grass so vividly\r\ngreen, or ocean so sparkling? Ah, a boy never lacked amusement now! He\r\nwriggled into his bathing suit directly after breakfast and was off to\r\nthe shore to swim, fish, or sail, or do any of the thousand-and-one\r\nalluring things that turned up. And things always did turn up in that\r\nsmall horseshoe where the boats made in. It was the club of Lovell\'s\r\nHarbor.\r\n\r\nHere all the men of the village congregated daily to smoke, swap\r\njokes, and heckle those who worked.\r\n\r\n"That\'s no way to mend a net, Eph," one of the spectators would\r\nprotest. "Where was you fetched up, man? Tote the durn thing over here\r\nand I\'ll show you how they do it off the Horn."\r\n\r\nOr another member of the audience would call:\r\n\r\n"Was you reckonin\' you\'d have enough paint in that keg to finish your\r\nyawl, Eddie? Never in the world! What are you so scrimpin\' of it for?\r\nSlither it on good and thick and let it trickle down into the cracks.\r\n\'Twill keep \'em tight."\r\n\r\nOh, one learned to curb his temper and bend to the higher criticism if\r\nhe carried his work down to the beach. He got an abundance of advice\r\nwhether he asked for it or not and for the most part the counsel was\r\nsound and helpful. There you heard also tales of tempests, wrecks,\r\nstrange ports, and sea serpents,--weird tales that chilled your blood;\r\nand sometimes the piping note of an old chanty was raised by one whose\r\nsailing days were now only a memory.\r\n\r\nWhat marvel that to be a boy at Lovell\'s Harbor was a boon to be\r\ncoveted even if along with the distinction went a throng of homely\r\ntasks such as shucking clams, cleaning cod, baiting lobster pots, and\r\nrunning errands? No cake is all frosting and no chowder all broth. You\r\nhad to take the bad along with the good if you lived at Lovell\'s\r\nHarbor. And while you were sandwiching in work and fun what an\r\neducation you got! Why, it was better than a dozen schools. Not only\r\ndid you learn to swim like a spaniel, pull a strong oar, hoist a sail,\r\nand gain an understanding of winds and tides, but also you came to\r\nhandle tools with an ease no manual training school could teach you.\r\nYou made a wooden pin do if you had no nail; and a bit of rope serve\r\nif the whittled pin were lacking. Instead of hurrying to a shop to\r\npurchase new you patched up the old, and the triumph of doing it\r\nafforded a satisfaction very pleasant to experience.\r\n\r\nMoreover, as a result, you had more pennies in your pocket and more\r\nbrains in your head. Both Bob and Walter King, as well as most of the\r\nother village lads, outranked the town-bred boy in all-round practical\r\nskill. They may not have cut such a fine figure at golf or dancing;\r\nperhaps they did not excel at Latin or French; but they had at the\r\ntips of their tongues numberless useful facts which they had tried out\r\nand proven workable and which no city dweller could possibly have\r\ngleaned.\r\n\r\nHis Highness might be freckled and towsled and, as his mother\r\naffirmed, forgetful and careless, but like a sponge his active young\r\nmind had soaked up a deal no books could have given him. You would\r\nbest beware how you jollied Walter King or put him down for a "Rube."\r\nMore than likely you would later regret your snap judgment.\r\n\r\nNo doubt it was this realization that had stimulated Jerry Thomas to\r\nask him to come to Surfside, the Crowninshields\' big summer estate,\r\nand look after the dogs. Jerry was an old resident of Lovell\'s Harbor,\r\nand having watched the boy grow up, he unquestionably knew what he\r\nwas about. That there were plenty of other boys at the Harbor to\r\nchoose from was certain. If the honor descended to His Highness rest\r\nassured it was not without reason.\r\n\r\nHence Jerry was not only pleased but immensely gratified when on the\r\nmorning following Walter rounded the corner of the great barn and\r\nappeared in the doorway.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve come to say Yes to that job you offered me the other day,"\r\nannounced he, without wasting words on preliminaries.\r\n\r\n"Good, youngster!"\r\n\r\n"When shall you want me?"\r\n\r\n"When can you come?" grinned Jerry.\r\n\r\nHe was a lank, sharp-featured man with china blue eyes that narrowed\r\nto a mere slit when he smiled, and from the corners of which\r\ncrowsfeet, like fan-shaped streaks of light from the rising sun,\r\nradiated across his temples. His skin was tanned to the hue of old\r\nhickory and deep down in its furrows were lines of white. He had a big\r\nnose that was always sunburned, powerful hands with a reddish fuzz on\r\ntheir backs, and gnarled fingers that bore the scars of innumerable\r\nnautical disasters. But the chief glory he possessed was a neatly\r\ntattooed schooner that sailed under full canvas upon his forearm and\r\nbore beneath it the inscription:\r\n\r\n    The Mollie D. The finest ship afloat.\r\n\r\nThe words had been intended as a tribute rather than a challenge for\r\nJerry was a peaceful soul, but unfortunately they had proved\r\nprovocative of many a brawl, and had the truth been known a certain\r\nodd slant of Jerry\'s chin could have been traced back to this\r\napparently harmless assertion. Possibly had this mate of the _Mollie\r\nD._ foreseen into what straits his boast was to lead him he might not\r\nhave expressed it so baldly in all the naked glory of blue ink; but\r\nwith the sentiment once immortalized what choice had he but to defend\r\nit? Therefore, being no coward but a sturdy seaman with a swinging\r\nundercut, he had in times past delivered many a blow in order to\r\nuphold the _Mollie D.\'s_ nautical reputation, after which encounters\r\nhis challengers were wont to emerge with a more profound respect not\r\nonly for the bark but for Jerry Thomas as well.\r\n\r\nAll that, however, was long ago. Since the great storm of 1890 when so\r\nmany ships had perished and the _Mollie D._, bound from Norfolk to\r\nFairhaven, had gone down with the rest, Jerry had abandoned the sea.\r\nIt was not the perils of the deep, nevertheless, that had driven him\r\nlandward, or the fear of future disasters; it was only that since his\r\nfirst love was lost he could not bring himself to ship on any other\r\nvessel.\r\n\r\nAccordingly he took to the shore and for a time a very strange misfit\r\nhe was there. How he fumed and fidgeted and roamed from one place to\r\nanother, searching for some spot in which his restless spirit would\r\nfind peace! And then one day he had wandered into Lovell\'s Harbor and\r\nthere he had stayed ever since. For several seasons he had taken out\r\nsailing parties of summer boarders or piloted amateur fishermen out to\r\nthe Ledges; but the timidity and lack of sophistication of these city\r\npatrons at length so rasped his nerves that he gave up the task and\r\nwas about to betake himself to pastures new when he fell beneath the\r\neye of Mr. Glenmore Archibald Crowninshield, a New York banker, who\r\nhad bought the strip of land forming one arm of the bay and was on the\r\npoint of erecting there a diminutive summer palace.\r\n\r\nFrom that instant Jerry\'s fortune was made. Mr. Crowninshield was a\r\nkeen student of human nature and was immediately attracted to the\r\nsailor with his ambling gait and twinkling blue eyes. Moreover, the\r\nNew Yorker happened to be in search of just such a man to look out for\r\nhis interests when he was not at Lovell\'s Harbor. Hence Jerry was\r\nelevated to the post of caretaker and delegated to keep guard over the\r\nedifice that was about to be erected.\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that up to the moment Jerry had been the most\r\ncare-free mortal alive and had never from day to day been able to\r\nremember the whereabouts of his sou\'wester or his rubber boots, his\r\nensuing transformation was nothing short of a miracle. Promptly\r\nsettling down with doglike fidelity he began mildly to urge on the\r\nlagging carpenters; but presently, magnificent in his wrath, he rose\r\nabove them, whiplash in hand, and drove them forward. His watery blue\r\neyes followed every stick of timber, every foot of piping, every nail\r\nthat was placed. There was no escaping his watchfulness. If corners\r\nwere not true or moldings did not meet he saw and called attention to\r\nit. Many a time a slipshod workman was ready to throw him over the\r\ncliff into the sea and perhaps might have done so had he not been\r\nconscious of the justice of the criticism.\r\n\r\nIn consequence the Crowninshield house was built on honor; and when\r\nthe bills began to come in and showed a marked falling off in\r\nmagnitude the owner of the mansion could not but express gratitude.\r\nJerry, however, did not covet thanks. Instead he tagged along at his\r\nemployer\'s heels, proudly calling notice first to one skillful bit of\r\nwork and then to another. The house and all that concerned it became\r\nhis hobby. It was to him what the _Mollie D._ had been, the primary\r\ninterest of his life. He knew every inch of plumbing; where every\r\nshut-off, valve, ventilator, and stopcock was located. Moreover, he\r\ncould have told, had not his jaws been clamped together tightly as a\r\nscallop shell, exactly how much every article in the mansion cost.\r\n\r\nLater he superintended the grading of the lawns, the laying out of\r\ntennis courts, and the building of garages, boathouses, and\r\nbathhouses. By this time Mr. Crowninshield would willingly have\r\ntrusted him with every farthing he possessed so complete was his\r\nconfidence in his man Friday.\r\n\r\nJerry, however, was modest. He declared he had only done his duty and\r\ninsisted that it go at that. But having set this high standard of\r\nfidelity for himself it followed that he demanded a like faithfulness\r\nin others; and if he were not merciful to those who came under his\r\ndictatorship at least no one of them could deny that he was just.\r\nHence Walter King did not shrink from the prospect of working with\r\nhim, stern though he was reputed to be. One can only do one\'s best and\r\nthat the boy was determined to do. Therefore he smiled up into Jerry\'s\r\nmisty blue eyes and answered:\r\n\r\n"I could begin work when school closes toward the end of June."\r\n\r\n"Humph! I wish you could make it earlier. Well, we must put up with\r\nthat since it is the best you can do. Goodness knows I\'d be the last\r\none to discourage learning in the young. I got all too little of it\r\nwhen I was a shaver. Not a day goes by that I don\'t wish I\'d had my\r\nchance. I shipped to sea when I was only twelve--would go--nothing\r\nwould stop me--and I\'ve been knocking round ever since, picking up\r\nhere and there what scraps of knowledge I could get. Don\'t let\r\nanything tempt you to sea till you\'re full-grown, sonny, for you\'ll\r\nlive to regret it, sure as my name is Jerry Taylor."\r\n\r\nWalter flushed guiltily, wondering as he did so whether Jerry\'s little\r\nblue eyes had bored their way into his skull and read there his\r\naspirations.\r\n\r\n"Nope!" went on the sailor. "Take it from me, seafaring is a man\'s\r\njob. You much better stay ashore and----" he stopped as if at a loss\r\nand then smiling broadly added, "play governess to a pack of dogs."\r\n\r\n"I figure that is about what I\'m going to do," replied His Highness\r\nwith a comic air of resignation.\r\n\r\n"Well, what\'s the matter with that?" inquired Jerry sharply. "You\'ll\r\nbe getting paid for it, won\'t you--well paid? And you\'ll have cozy\r\nquarters all to yourself, and three good meals a day. Land alive! Some\r\nfolks want the earth! Why, when I was your age, I was swung up in a\r\nhammock between decks with not an inch of space that I could call my\r\nown. If I wanted to stow away anything I hadn\'t a place to put it\r\nwhere it wasn\'t common property. As for meals I took what I could get\r\nand was thankful that I didn\'t starve. And here you come along and\r\ntilt up your freckled pug nose at a room and board and ten a week.\r\nBah! What\'s come over this generation anyway?"\r\n\r\n"I wasn\'t turning up my nose," Walter ventured to protest. "It turns\r\nup anyhow."\r\n\r\n"Then you need to be careful how you make it go higher," grinned\r\nJerry.\r\n\r\n"And--and--I had no idea you meant to pay me that much."\r\n\r\n"What do you think we are up here?" bristled Jerry. "A sweatshop? No\r\nsiree! We stand for the square deal every time, we do. Only you\'ve got\r\nto understand, young one, that it\'s to be square on both sides. You\'re\r\nto do no shirking; if you do you\'ll get fired so quick you\'ll wonder\r\nwhat hit you. But if you do your part you need have no worries. Now\r\nthink good and plenty before you embark on the cruise."\r\n\r\n"I have thought."\r\n\r\n"All right then. We\'ll haul up anchor and be off the latter part of\r\nJune."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll have to tell me exactly what you want me to do."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'ll tell you right \'nough," drawled Jerry, with a humorous twist\r\nof his lips. "You\'ll get a chart to sail by. Still, it won\'t wholly\r\ncover your duties. The thing for you to do is to keep your eyes peeled\r\nand look alive. Watch out and see where there\'s a hole an\' be in that\r\nhole so it won\'t be empty. That\'s the best recipe I know for being\r\nuseful."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll try."\r\n\r\n"If you honestly do that I reckon there\'ll be no cause for you to\r\nworry," observed the caretaker kindly. "Towards the end of June, then,\r\nI\'ll be on the lookout for you. Your quarters will be all ready,\r\nshipshape and trim as a liner\'s cabin."\r\n\r\n"Where will they be?" inquired Walter.\r\n\r\n"Want to see \'em?"\r\n\r\n"I\'d like to, yes."\r\n\r\n"I s\'pose you would," nodded Jerry. "You can as well as not; only they\r\nain\'t fixed up as they\'ll be later. Look kinder dismal."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I shan\'t mind."\r\n\r\nThe big man smiled at the eagerness of the boy\'s tone.\r\n\r\n"Likely you ain\'t never been away from home before, son," said he, as\r\nhe took a key out of a glass case on the wall of the barn and slipped\r\nit into his pocket.\r\n\r\n"No--that is, not to stay."\r\n\r\n"Quite some adventure, eh?"\r\n\r\nThe lad shot a bright glance toward him.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Well, well! Count yourself lucky, youngster, that you\'ve had a good\r\nhome and a good mother up to now; and bless your stars, too, that\r\nsince you are going to start branching out you\'re coming to a place\r\nlike Surfside rather\'n somewhere else."\r\n\r\nHis voice was gentle and his misty eyes mistier than ever.\r\n\r\nStriding ahead he crossed the lawn, unlocked a low building, and\r\nmounting the stairs, stopped before a door in the hall above. With a\r\nturn of the key it swung open, disclosing a small sheathed room\r\ncontaining a white iron bed, bureau, table, chairs, and bookshelves.\r\n\r\n"Think this will suit your Highness?" grinned he.\r\n\r\n"It\'s--it\'s corking!" stammered Walter, almost too delighted to reply.\r\n\r\n"\'Tain\'t bad," admitted Jerry, strolling over to one of the windows\r\nthat faced the sea and looking out. "Mr. Crowninshield makes it a rule\r\nnever to stow away other folks where he wouldn\'t be stowed himself. It\r\nisn\'t a bad principle, either. You\'ll have a couple of the chauffeurs\r\nfor company." With his thumb he motioned to other rooms flanking the\r\nnarrow hall. "They may josh you some at first. That\'s part of starting\r\nout in the world. Keep a civil tongue in your head and if you don\'t\r\nmind \'em they\'ll soon quit. If they don\'t it\'s up to you to find the\r\nway to get on with \'em. Half of life is learning to shy round the\r\ncorners of the folks about you. And old Tim, who used to be gardener\r\nfor Mr. Crowninshield\'s father and has been in the family \'most half a\r\ncentury, bides here, too. A rare soul, Tim. You\'ll like him. Everybody\r\ndoes. Simple as a child, he is, and so gentle that it well-nigh breaks\r\nhis heart to kill a potato bug. You can count on Tim standing your\r\nfriend no matter what the rest may do, so cheer up."\r\n\r\n"And the dogs?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, the kennels, you mean? They\'re close by where you\'ll get the full\r\nbenefit of the pups\' barking in the early morning," said Jerry, with a\r\ntwinkle. "\'Twill give you a pleasant feeling to be certain your\r\ncharges are alive. Most often, though, they do no yammering until\r\nabout six, and goodness knows all Christians ought to be up at that\r\nhour. You\'ll find the dogs fitted out comfortable as the rest of us.\r\nThey\'ve a fine enclosure to stay in when they want to be out of doors;\r\na big airy room if it\'s better to have \'em under cover; steam heat\r\nwhen it\'s cold; and blankets and brushes without end. Sometimes Lola,\r\nthe pet of \'em all, sleeps up at the big house; but mostly she\'s here\r\nwith the rest. There\'s too big a caravan of \'em to have the lot live\r\nwith the family. Besides, the folks like to sleep late in the morning\r\nand not be disturbed by the noise of a pack of puppies. Then there\'s\r\nguests here off and on. So take it all in all, the dogs are best by\r\nthemselves."\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t know anything about taking care of dogs," faltered\r\nWalter.\r\n\r\n"I thought you\'d had a dog yourself."\r\n\r\n"So I had once. But he wasn\'t like any of these. He was just a dog.\r\nAll you had to do was to chuck him a bone."\r\n\r\n"Well, you\'ll have a darn sight more to do for these critters than\r\nthat," announced Jerry.\r\n\r\n"But how\'ll I know----" began the boy, alarmed by the prospect before\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you\'ll get your instructions from the Madam, most likely--get \'em\r\nall written down in black and white along with the history of every\r\ndog. She\'ll tell you just what every one of \'em is to eat, and how\r\nmuch; and where they\'re all to sleep. And if she don\'t Miss Nancy or\r\nMr. Dick will. You\'ll get yards and yards of directions before you\'re\r\nthrough," chuckled Jerry. "You want to listen well to every word you\r\nhear too, son, for these dogs ain\'t like your Towser--or whatever his\r\nname was; a crumb of food too much might kill \'em. Or a blast of air."\r\n\r\n"Scott!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, there\'s no use getting panicky at the outset," declared Jerry\r\ncomfortably. "Follow orders and use your brains; and remember that if\r\nyou get addled you can always consult Tim. Tim has a world of common\r\nsense and a heap of knowledge of odd sorts. And more than that, he\'s\r\nnever swept off his feet by the cost of things. Having been brought up\r\nin the company of Rolls-Royce cars, and diamond rings, and\r\nthousand-dollar dogs they don\'t move him an inch. He just treats \'em\r\nsame\'s he would anything else and often it\'s the best plan. Instead\r\nof losing his head, and standing wringing his hands \'cause the prize\r\nroses have got bugs on \'em he sets to work and kills the bugs; sprays\r\nthe plants same\'s he would ordinary bushes, and they go to growing\r\nagain like any other civilized flowers. An orchid ain\'t no more to him\r\nthan a buttercup. He\'s too used to \'em. He\'s used to dogs as well, and\r\nwith the shifting fashions he\'s seen during his fifty years with the\r\nfamily he\'s had experience with most every kind of dog that ever was.\r\nFor there\'s fashions in dogs, you know, as well as in coats and hats.\r\nSo turn to Tim when you\'re in a tight place. He\'ll help you, never\r\nfear."\r\n\r\n"I hope he will," sighed His Highness ruefully. "I shall need him."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense! Why, Mr. Dick has often cared for the pups when there was\r\nno one else; and certainly you ought to have as many brains as he."\r\n\r\n"Tell me about him."\r\n\r\n"Richard? You\'ve seen him round town lots of times--you must have. At\r\nthe village and other places."\r\n\r\n"Oh, of course I\'ve seen him," agreed Walter quickly. "In the summer\r\nhe drives past our house almost every day in his car. But I don\'t know\r\nhim any."\r\n\r\n"You will now," asserted Jerry. "He\'s a great chap, Mr. Dick is! About\r\nyour age, too, I guess. Quite a mechanic and always tinkering with\r\ntools and machinery. If there\'s anything wrong with the motor boat he\r\ncan usually fix her up all right. As for mending a car, he beats all\r\nthe chauffeurs out. They know it and have to say so. Likely you\'ve\r\nseen him fluking through the main street in his racer. She\'s a trim\r\nlittle thing and could go like the wind if his Pa hadn\'t forbidden\r\nletting out the engine. I reckon Mr. Crowninshield is afraid he\'ll\r\neither kill himself or somebody else, and I will own the thing ain\'t\r\nno proper toy for a lad his age. Still, city folks ain\'t content with\r\nwhat would please you or me. They must have the biggest, the fastest,\r\nthe most expensive article there is or \'tain\'t good for nothin\'. The\r\nmere knowin\' it\'s the biggest, fastest, and cost the most seems to\r\nmake \'em happy somehow. Funny, ain\'t it?"\r\n\r\nHis Highness did not reply. He was thinking.\r\n\r\n"And Miss Nancy?" interrogated he presently.\r\n\r\n"Ha! There\'s a girl for you!" ejaculated Jerry with enthusiasm.\r\n"She\'ll be either seventeen or eighteen come June. Swims like a fish.\r\nIn fact, I ain\'t sure she couldn\'t outdistance some of \'em. And such\r\nan oar as she pulls! It\'s strong and steady as any man\'s. Besides\r\nthat, she can beat the crowd at tennis, golf, and those other fool\r\ngames such folks play. Has a runabout of her own, too, and drives it\r\nneat as a pin."\r\n\r\n"She\'s better at sports than Mr. Dick, then."\r\n\r\n"Oh, she can wipe the ground up with him," sniffed Jerry. "She can\r\nswim overhand to the raft and get back almost before her brother has\r\nstarted. By Guy! I never saw a woman swim as she does! Dick gets\r\nkinder peeved with her sometimes when she jollies him. But let her car\r\nplay a prank and he has her, for she\'s no more idea what to do with\r\nan engine than the man in the moon. She treats brother Richard with\r\nproper respect then, I can tell you."\r\n\r\nWalter smiled.\r\n\r\n"And Mrs. Crowninshield?"\r\n\r\n"She? She\'s all right! You\'ll like her and she\'ll like you--that is,\r\nif you get on with the pups. Dogs are her hobby. What she don\'t know\r\nabout raisin\' \'em ain\'t worth knowin\'. But I just warn you not to\r\nthink that because she\'s so pleasant she\'s easy goin\', \'cause she\r\nain\'t. Slip up on your job and she\'ll be down on you like a thousand\r\nof brick. She\'s a fair-weather sailin\' craft--that\'s what she is;\r\nfloats along nice as anything until something goes wrong and then--my\r\nsoul--but she kicks up a sea. Yet with all that you\'ll like her. We\r\nall do. Almost everybody on the place would get down and let her walk\r\non \'em. She has a kind of way with her that makes you itch to please\r\nher. Tim would let her cut his head clean off if she wanted to and I\r\nain\'t sure I wouldn\'t. Have a smart sore throat once and see the\r\nthings she\'ll do for you. And she\'ll do \'em herself, too--not set\r\nother people on the job. I believe that woman has the biggest heart in\r\nthe world."\r\n\r\n"And--and--Mr. Crowninshield?" ventured Walter.\r\n\r\n"The boss?" Jerry cleared his throat and for the first time hesitated.\r\n"You\'ve got to understand the boss, my son," said he earnestly. "He\r\nain\'t like other men. And in order that you may, I better give you a\r\npointer or two for it will most probably save you trouble. The boss\r\nis something like a big dog that barks fit to murder you and don\'t\r\nmean a thing by it. You\'ve seen the kind. To hear him go on when he\'s\r\nroused you\'d believe he was going to have your blood. My, how he does\r\norate!" Jerry smiled and shook his head indulgently. "I\'ve seen the\r\nmen stand up before him with their knees shaking until you\'d expect\r\n\'em to give way every second. And the master would rage and rage\r\nbecause they\'d done something he didn\'t want done. And then, like a\r\nhurricane that\'s blown itself out, he\'ll calm down and the next you\r\nknow he\'s given you a smile that\'s made you forget all the rest of it.\r\nThat\'s him all over. Learn not to be afraid of him, that\'s the only\r\nthing to do. He wouldn\'t hurt a fly really. He just gets to blusterin\'\r\nand tearin\' round from force of habit. It don\'t mean nothin\'--not a\r\nthing in the world. And with all his money he ain\'t a mite cocky. To\r\nsee him you\'d scarce dream he had a copper in his pocket. Yet he could\r\npaper the house with thousand-dollar bills was he so minded. There\'s\r\nno end to his money, seems to me. Just the same, you don\'t want to go\r\nwastin\' it for him on that account. Remember you ain\'t got the right\r\nto, not havin\' earned it. If he chooses to splash it round that\'s his\r\nhunt. He made it. But it ain\'t yours or mine to slosh away. Jot that\r\ndown in your log. It may help you later."\r\n\r\nJerry paused.\r\n\r\n"You deal square and honorable with the boss, standing up to what\r\nyou\'ve done like you was a trooper at your gun, and he\'ll deal square\r\nand honorable with you. But go to hoodwinking and imposing on him and\r\ninstead of a lamb you\'ll find you\'ve got a rattlesnake at your heels.\r\nNow you have an idea, I guess, what you\'re going to be up against\r\nhere," concluded the caretaker, taking out his pipe and cramming it\r\nwith tobacco. "If there\'s anything else you want to know now\'s your\r\nchance, for after to-day I am never going to open my lips again about\r\nany of the Crowninshield family. You\'ll be one of the employees and\r\nyour job will be to hold your tongue on them and their affairs, and be\r\nloyal to \'em. Their bread will be feeding you and \'twill be only\r\ndecent. After you once have got your place the keeping of it will rest\r\nwith you. That\'s fair, ain\'t it?"\r\n\r\nWalter nodded.\r\n\r\nYet he turned slowly toward home, depressed by a throng of misgivings.\r\nSuppose he was not able to hold the job at Surfside once it was his?\r\nWhat then?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nWHAT WORRIED MRS. KING\r\n\r\n\r\nBy the middle of May Lovell\'s Harbor had fully awakened from its\r\nwinter\'s sleep. Freshly painted dories were slipped into the water;\r\nnewly rigged yawls and knockabouts were anchored in the bay; the float\r\nwas equipped with renovated bumpers, and a general air of anticipation\r\npervaded the community.\r\n\r\nYes, hot weather was really on the way. Already the summer cottages\r\nwere being opened, aired, and put in order, and even some of the\r\nhouses had gayly figured hangings at the windows and a film of smoke\r\ncould be seen issuing from the chimneys.\r\n\r\nAt Surfside workmen bustled about, hurrying across the lawn with\r\nboards, paint pots, and hammers. Tim Cavenough and his little host of\r\nhelpers scurried to uncover the flower beds, and from morning to night\r\ntrudged back and forth from the greenhouses bearing shallow boxes of\r\nseedlings which they transplanted to the gardens. Shutters were\r\nremoved and stored away, piazza chairs brought out, awnings put up,\r\nand lawns and tennis courts rolled and cut.\r\n\r\nAs far as one could see a spangled expanse of ocean dazzled the eye\r\nand the tiny salt creeks that meandered across the meadows were like\r\nwinding ribbons of blue. Certainly it was no weather to be shut up in\r\nschool and boys and girls went hither with reluctant feet, checking\r\noff the days on their fingers and even counting the hours that must\r\ndrag by before they would be free to roam at will amid this panorama\r\nof beauty.\r\n\r\nTo Walter King it seemed as if the closing period of his captivity\r\nwould never be at an end. He studied rebelliously, and with only a\r\nhalf--nay, rather a quarter--of his mind on his lessons. All his\r\nthought was centered around Surfside and the novel experiences that\r\nbeckoned him there. So impatient was he to begin his new duties that\r\nhe found it impossible to settle down to anything.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll be failing in your last examinations, Walter, if you don\'t\r\nwatch what you\'re doing," cautioned his mother. "And should you do\r\nthat, little profit would it be that you are hired out to Mr.\r\nCrowninshield for the summer. In the fall you\'d have to stay behind\r\nyour class, and think of the disgrace of that! Why, I\'d be ready to\r\nhide my head with shame! Money or no money, you must buck up and put\r\nthe Crowninshields and their doings out of your head. To lose a year\r\nnow would mean just that much longer before you could graduate and\r\ntake a regular job. I almost wish Jerry Thomas had never asked you to\r\ncome up there, I do indeed."\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t go getting all fussed up, Ma," returned His Highness,\r\nirritated because he recognized the truth of his mother\'s words. "I\'m\r\ngoing to buckle down until the term is over, honest I am. It is hard,\r\nthough, with the weather so fine. It seems as if I must be out. It\'s\r\nlike being on a leash."\r\n\r\n"You\'re thinking of those dogs again!"\r\n\r\nThe lad flushed sheepishly.\r\n\r\n"No, I wasn\'t."\r\n\r\n"But you were--whether you realized it or not. It is all you talk of\r\nnowadays--_dogs_! What it will be after they get here and you\'re up at\r\nSurfside living with them I don\'t know. Whatever else you do, though,\r\nyou must not fail in your lessons and at the last moment spoil your\r\nwhole year\'s record. School is your first duty now and you have no\r\nmoral right to put anything else in its place."\r\n\r\n"I know it, Ma," Walter agreed.\r\n\r\n"Of course you know it," was the tart response. "Just see that you do\r\nnot forget it, that\'s all."\r\n\r\nWith this final admonition Mrs. King whisked about and taking up her\r\ncake of Sapolio and pail of steaming water ascended the stairs. Like\r\nthe rest of Lovell\'s Harbor she was busy as a bee in clovertime. She\r\nhad rented all her rooms and had so many things to do in preparation\r\nfor her expected guests that she had not a second to waste.\r\n\r\nAfter she had gone Walter loitered in the kitchen, whistling absently\r\nand at the same time winding a piece of string aimlessly over his\r\nfingers. His mother\'s words had stirred a vague, uncomfortable\r\npossibility in his mind. What if he were to fail in those final exams?\r\nIt would be terrible. Such a disaster did not seem real. It couldn\'t\r\nhappen--actually happen--to him. It would be too awful. Nevertheless,\r\ntry as he would to banish them, visions of Surfside with its myriad\r\nfascinations would dance in his head.\r\n\r\nHe had never been away from home for more than a night before and to\r\ntake up residence elsewhere for an entire season was in itself a\r\nnovelty. Then there were the tennis courts, the golf links, the\r\nautomobiles, motor boats, and the yacht! Why, it would be like\r\nfairyland! The next instant, however, his spirits drooped. It was\r\nabsurd to imagine for a moment that he was to have any part in those\r\nmagic amusements. He was not going to Surfside for recreation but for\r\nwork. Notwithstanding that fact, though, it was beyond his power to\r\nforget that all these many activities would be going on about him and\r\nthere was the chance, the bare chance, that an occasion might arise\r\nwhen he would be invited to participate in some of them.\r\n\r\nFancy spinning over the sandy roads of the Cape in that wonderful\r\nracing car! Or sailing the blue waters of the harbor in one of those\r\nsnowy motor boats! As for the yacht, with its trimmings of glistening\r\nbrass and spotless decks, had he not dreamed of going aboard it ever\r\nsince the day it had first steamed into the bay two summers ago?\r\nPeople said there was every imaginable contrivance aboard: ice-making\r\nmachines, electric lights, and electric piano, goodness only knew\r\nwhat! Simply to see such things would be wonderful. And if it ever\r\nshould come about (of course it never would and it was absurd to\r\npicture it--ridiculous) but if it ever _did_ that he should go sailing\r\nout of the bay on that mystic craft what a miracle that would be!\r\n\r\nWith such visions floating through his mind what marvel that it was\r\nwell-nigh out of the question for Walter King to focus his attention\r\non algebra, Latin, history, and physics. X + Y seemed of very little\r\nconsequence, and as for the Punic Wars they were so far away as to be\r\nhazy beyond any reality at all.\r\n\r\nPossibly, although she was quite unconscious of it, some of the fault\r\nwas his mother\'s for she kept the topic of his departure to the\r\nCrowninshields\' ever before him.\r\n\r\n"I have your new shirts almost finished, son," she would assert with\r\nsatisfaction, "and they\'re as neat and well made as any New York\r\ntailor could make them, if I do say it; and you\'ve three pairs of\r\nkhaki trousers besides your old woolen ones and corduroys. With your\r\nSunday suit of blue serge and those fresh ties and cap you\'ll have\r\nnothing to be ashamed of. Then you\'ve those denim overalls, and your\r\nslicker, and Bob\'s outgrown pea-coat. I can\'t see but what you have\r\neverything you can possibly need. Do be watchful of your shoes and use\r\nthem carefully, won\'t you, for they cost a mint of money? And remember\r\nwhenever you can to work in your old duds and save your others. You\r\ncan just as well as not if you only think of it. Your washing you\'ll\r\nbring home and don\'t forget that I want you to keep neat and clean.\r\nRich folks notice those things a lot. So scrub your hands and neck\r\nand clean your nails, even if I\'m not there to tell you to. Just\r\nbecause you are going to traipse round with the dogs is no excuse for\r\nlooking like \'em," concluded she.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll remember, Ma," returned His Highness patiently.\r\n\r\n"And if you eat with the chauffeurs and a pack of men, don\'t go\r\nstuffing yourself with food until you\'re sick. There\'s a time to stop,\r\nyou know. Don\'t wait until you\'ve got past it and are so crammed that\r\nyou can\'t swallow another mouthful."\r\n\r\n"I won\'t, Ma," was the meek response.\r\n\r\n"Brush your teeth faithfully, too. I\'ve spent too much money on them\r\nto have them go to waste now."\r\n\r\n"Yes," came wearily from Walter.\r\n\r\n"Of course there\'s no call for me to talk to a person your age about\r\nsmoking," continued his mother. "When you\'ve got your full growth and\r\ncan earn money enough to pay for such foolishness you\'ve a right to\r\nindulge in it if you see fit; but until then don\'t start a habit that\r\nwill do you no good and may make a pigmy of you for life."\r\n\r\n"I promise you right now, Ma, that I----"\r\n\r\n"No, don\'t promise. A promise is a sacred thing and one that it is a\r\nsacrilege to break. Never make a promise lightly. But just remember,\r\nladdie, that I\'d far rather you didn\'t smoke for a few years yet. But\r\nshould you feel you must why come and tell me, that\'s all."\r\n\r\n"I will, Ma," answered the boy soberly. Somehow going away from home\r\nsuddenly seemed a very solemn business.\r\n\r\n"I guess that\'s the end of my cautions," smiled Mrs. King, "the end,\r\nexcept to say that I hope you won\'t like Surfside so well that you\'ll\r\nforget to come home now and then and tell me how you are making out.\r\nOf course I\'ll have my boarders and work same\'s you; still, there\'ll\r\nbe times when we won\'t be busy and can see each other," her voice\r\ntrembled a little. "Nobody will be more anxious to hear of your doings\r\nthan I--remember that. I shall miss you, sonny. It\'s the first time\r\nyou\'ve been away from me and I can\'t but feel it\'s a sort of\r\nmilestone. You\'ll be getting grown up and leaving home for good now\r\nbefore I know it, same as Bob has."\r\n\r\nHer eyes glistened and for an instant she turned her head aside.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I shan\'t be branching out to make my fortune yet, Mother,"\r\nprotested Walter gayly. "I don\'t know enough. I\'m not clever like\r\nBob--you said so yourself only the other day."\r\n\r\n"You\'re clever as is good for you," was the ambiguous retort. "I\'m\r\nglad you\'re no different."\r\n\r\n"Think of the money I\'d be handing in if I could only earn as much as\r\nBob."\r\n\r\n"The money? Aye, there\'s no denying it would be a help. However, with\r\nwhat you and Bob and I are going to earn this summer we should make\r\nout very well, even if your Uncle Mark Miller has left us in the lurch\r\nand your Uncle Henry King\'s investments have gone bad on us. I\'ll be\r\nturning a tidy penny with my boarders, thanks to you. And for a lad\r\nyour age ten dollars a week is not to be sneezed at. Why, we\'ll have\r\nquite a little fortune between us!"\r\n\r\nHe saw her face brighten.\r\n\r\n"Now if Bob could only be near at hand like you I believe I should be\r\nentirely happy," she sighed. "I hate to think of him way out there on\r\nthat spit of sand with the sea booming all around him and nothing for\r\ncompany but the other fellow, who\'s asleep whenever he\'s awake, and\r\nthat clicking wireless instrument. Imagine the loneliness of it! The\r\nsolitude would drive me crazy inside a week--I know it would."\r\n\r\n"Bob doesn\'t mind."\r\n\r\n"He\'s not the lad to say so if he did," replied the mother grimly.\r\n"Nobody\'d be any the wiser for what Bob thinks. Often at night I fall\r\nto wondering what he\'d do was he to be taken sick."\r\n\r\n"Oh, he\'d be all right, Mother," answered His Highness cheerfully.\r\n"O\'Connel is there, you know."\r\n\r\n"And what kind of a nurse would he be, do you think, with his ear to\r\nthat switchboard from daylight until dark?"\r\n\r\n"Not quite that. Mother."\r\n\r\n"Well, almost that, anyhow. It is all well enough for you to say so\r\njauntily that Bob doesn\'t mind being off there with the wind howling\r\nround him and nothing to do but listen to it."\r\n\r\n"Nothing to do!" repeated Walter. "Why, Ma, he\'s busy all the time."\r\n\r\n"Tinkering with those wires, you mean?" was the indignant question.\r\n"Yes, I grant he has plenty of that, especially in bad weather. But I\r\nmean pleasures----"\r\n\r\n"Moving pictures, church sociables, strawberry festivals," interrupted\r\nthe lad mischievously.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do," maintained Mrs. King stoutly. "Folks must have something\r\nto brighten up their lives. Bob doesn\'t have a thing."\r\n\r\n"He often has days that are lively enough, according to his stories."\r\n\r\n"When there\'s wrecks, you mean?" She shook her head gravely. "It isn\'t\r\nthose that I\'m talking about. It\'s sitting day after day and listening\r\nto the meaningless taps and buzzings that come whining through that\r\ninstrument."\r\n\r\n"They\'re not meaningless to him."\r\n\r\n"No-o, I suppose not," sighed the woman. For a moment she paused only\r\nto resume her complaints. "Then there\'s the responsibility of it. I\r\nnever did like to think of that. Should he tap once too much or too\r\nlittle when sending one of those dot and dash messages, think what it\r\nmight mean! And suppose he heard a dot too much and didn\'t get the\r\nthing the other fellow was trying to tell him straight?"\r\n\r\n"But he has been trained so he does not make mistakes."\r\n\r\n"All human clay makes mistakes," was the tragic answer, "although I\r\nwill say Bob makes fewer than most. And then the thunder storms--I\'m\r\nalways worried about those."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'ll confess there is some danger from lightning," owned Walter\r\nunwillingly. "And of course there is danger from the current at all\r\ntimes if one is not careful. Even then accidents sometimes happen.\r\nHowever, Bob explained once that accidental shocks seldom result\r\nfatally unless the person is left too long without help. The man in\r\ncharge of the radio outfit would almost never get the full force of\r\nthe current, because part of it would be carried off through the wires\r\nand ground. Such accidents are mainly due to the temporary and faulty\r\ncontact of the conductors."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t help what they\'re due to," sniffed Mrs. King. "The point is\r\nthat Bob might get knocked out and die."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, Mother. You would not worry if you understood more about\r\nit. Besides, should a man get a shock, if you go promptly to work over\r\nhim and keep at it long enough, you can almost always bring him back\r\nto consciousness. They do just about the same things to restore him\r\nthat they do for a person that\'s been drowned. The aim is to make him\r\nbreathe. If you can get him to, he will probably live. Of course,\r\nthough, you have to break the circuit first."\r\n\r\n"The circuit?"\r\n\r\n"Stop the current that is going through his body," explained Walter.\r\n\r\n"But how can you?"\r\n\r\n"Bob told me how. He saw a chap knocked out once and helped fix him\r\nup. You had to be awfully careful about moving him away from the\r\napparatus, Bob said, or you might get a shock yourself. They took a\r\ndry stick because it was a nonconductor of electricity, you know, and\r\nrolled the man over to one side, so he was out of reach of the wires.\r\nHad you covered your hands with dry cloth you could have moved him,\r\ntoo; rubber gloves are best but Bob did not happen to have any handy\r\nat the minute. So they poked the fellow out of the way with the stick,\r\nturned him over on his back, loosened his collar and clothing, and\r\nwent to work on him. You know how they always roll up a coat or\r\nsomething and stuff it under drowned persons\' shoulders to throw their\r\nhead backward? Well, they did that; and afterward they began to move\r\nhis arms up and down to make him breathe. The idea is to depress and\r\nexpand the chest. We learned it in our \'first aid\' class. Of course\r\nthere are lots of things you have to do besides, and if you can get a\r\ndoctor he will know of others that are better still. But Bob said the\r\nchief point was not to get discouraged and give up. Sometimes people\r\ndie just because the folks fussing over them do not keep at it long\r\nenough. They get tired and when they see no results they decide it is\r\nno use and stop trying. You ought to work an hour anyhow, repeating\r\nthe exercises at the rate of sixteen times a minute, Bob said. Then,\r\nif the poor chap does not come to, you can at least feel you have done\r\nall you can."\r\n\r\n"Ugh! It makes me shiver to think of it!"\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t shiver when Minnie Carlton fell off the float and almost\r\ngot drowned," remarked Walter significantly.\r\n\r\n"I had too much to think of," was Mrs. King\'s laconic reply.\r\n\r\n"It was the fussing you did over her that saved her life."\r\n\r\n"They said so."\r\n\r\n"You know it was."\r\n\r\n"Mebbe it was," admitted his mother modestly. "But it wasn\'t any\r\ncredit to me. I\'ve always lived near the water and I feel at home with\r\ndrowned people."\r\n\r\n"These electric accidents are much the same--easier, if anything,\r\nbecause the lungs are not filled with water."\r\n\r\n"I hadn\'t thought of that."\r\n\r\n"This is just a straight case of making a man breathe. You did that\r\nfor Minnie."\r\n\r\n"I contrived to, yes."\r\n\r\n"Well, this stunt is the same. Bob said if you once got that through\r\nyour head and kept in mind what you were driving at instead of flying\r\noff the handle you would get on all right."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps he\'s right. He generally is," sighed Mrs. King. "Still it is\r\na worrisome business having him tinkering with those wires all the\r\ntime. I am thankful you are not doing it. I\'d rather you tended dogs."\r\n\r\n"But you\'ve forgotten what they\'re worth," put in His Highness.\r\n\r\n"So I had. Oh, dear! I don\'t see but what I\'ve got to worry about both\r\nof you."\r\n\r\n"Pooh, Ma! Don\'t be foolish. Think of the money we\'ll have by fall,\r\nthe three of us. Why, we\'ll be rich!"\r\n\r\n"Not rich, with that last payment on the mortgage looming ahead."\r\n\r\n"But it _is_ the last--think of that! We won\'t ever have another to\r\nmake."\r\n\r\nA radiant smile flitted over Mrs. King\'s face but a moment later it\r\nwas eclipsed by a cloud.\r\n\r\n"There\'ll be other things to pay; there always are," fretted she.\r\n\r\n"Oh, shucks, Ma! Why borrow trouble? It\'s always hanging round wanting\r\nto be borrowed. Why gratify it?"\r\n\r\n"I know. It is a foolish habit, isn\'t it? Still, it was always my way\r\nto be prepared for the worst. I\'ve done it all my life."\r\n\r\n"Then why not whiffle round now and just for a change be prepared for\r\nthe best?"\r\n\r\nIn spite of herself his mother laughed.\r\n\r\n"I expect that if I was as young as you and as happy-go-lucky I\'d\r\nnever worry," she answered not unkindly. "But since I\'m made with a\r\nworrying disposition and bound to worry anyhow, at least I\'ve got\r\nsomething perfectly legitimate to worry about this summer, and you\r\ncan\'t deny it. With one son liable to be electrocuted by wireless and\r\nthe other likely to be run into jail for losing a million-dollar dog I\r\nshall have plenty to occupy my mind, not to mention all those\r\nboarders that are coming."\r\n\r\n"Now, Ma, you know you are actually looking forward to the boarders,"\r\nWalter declared. "Already you are simply itching to see them and find\r\nout what they are like."\r\n\r\n"And if I am, what then?" admitted his mother flushing that she should\r\nhave been read so accurately. "Seeing them isn\'t all there is to it by\r\na good sight. There is feeding them, and to keep them filled up in\r\nthis bracing climate is no small matter."\r\n\r\n"Did you ever know any one to go hungry in this house?"\r\n\r\n"Well, no; I can\'t say I ever did."\r\n\r\n"Do you imagine boarders will eat more than Bob or I?"\r\n\r\n"Mercy on us! I hope not."\r\n\r\n"Well, you always gave us enough to eat. I guess if you contrived to\r\ndo that you needn\'t worry about your boarders," chuckled His Highness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nWALTER MAKES HIS BOW TO HIS EMPLOYER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last day of June dawned dismal and foggy. A grim gray veil\r\nenshrouded Lovell\'s Harbor, rendering it cold and dreary. Had one been\r\nvisiting it for the first time he would probably have turned his back\r\non its forlornity and never have come again. The sea was wrapped in a\r\nmist so dense that its vast reach of waves was as complete a secret as\r\nif they had been actually curtained off from the land. On every leaf\r\ntrembled beads of moisture and from the eaves of the sodden houses the\r\nwater dripped with a melancholy trickle.\r\n\r\nIt was wretched weather for the Crowninshields to be coming to\r\nSurfside and yet that they were already on the way the jangling\r\ntelephone attested.\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t have had \'em put in an appearance a day like this for the\r\nworld!" fretted Jerry Taylor, who for some unaccountable reason seemed\r\nto hold himself responsible for the general dampness and discomfort.\r\n"Fog ain\'t nothin\' to us folks who are used to it. We\'ve lived by the\r\nocean long enough to love it no matter how it behaves. But for it to\r\ngo actin\' up this way for strangers is a pity. It gives \'em a bad\r\nimpression same\'s a ill-behaved child does."\r\n\r\n"But you can\'t help it," ventured Walter, who had just come into\r\nsight.\r\n\r\n"N-o. Still, somehow, I\'m always that anxious for the place to look\r\nit\'s prettiest that I feel to blame when it doesn\'t."\r\n\r\nThe boy nodded sympathetically. Deep down within him lay an\r\ninarticulate affection for the hamlet in which he had been born and\r\nthe great throbbing sea that lapped its shores. He therefore\r\nunderstood Jerry\'s attitude and shared in it far more than he would,\r\nperhaps, have been willing to admit. Nevertheless he merely knocked\r\nthe drops from his rubber hat, muttered that it was a rotten day, and\r\nloitered awkwardly about, wondering just what to do.\r\n\r\nAt last school was at an end. He had squeaked through the examinations\r\nwith safety if not with glory, and having wheeled his small trunk up\r\nto Surfside on a wheelbarrow and deposited it in his room he\r\nspeculated as to what to do next. There was plenty he might have done.\r\nThere was no question about that. He might at the very moment have\r\nbeen unpacking his possessions, hanging his clothes in the closet, and\r\nstowing away his undergarments in the chest of drawers provided for\r\nthe purpose. Moreover, there were books to tuck into place on his\r\nbookshelves and other minor duties relative to the settling of his new\r\nquarters.\r\n\r\nOh, there were a score of things he might have done. His Highness,\r\nhowever, was in much too agitated a frame of mind to turn his\r\nattention to such humdrum tasks. Furthermore, since he had pledged\r\nhimself to bear a hand wherever it was needed, he felt he should be on\r\nthe spot and within call. And if beneath this worthy motive lurked a\r\ncertain desire to see whatever there was to be seen, who can say his\r\ncuriosity was not pardonable? One does not set forth every day to make\r\nhis fortune. The adventure was very alluring to him who had never\r\ntried it.\r\n\r\nPossibly Jerry Taylor had enough of the boy in him to understand this.\r\nHowever that might be, he did not hurry the lad indoors to unpack even\r\nthough he sensed full well that precious time was being wasted;\r\ninstead, as he started across the lawn he called back over his\r\nshoulder:\r\n\r\n"If you\'ve nothing better to do, sonny, than to stand shivering in the\r\nbarn, come along up to the house with me and help bring up some wood;\r\nI\'m going to start fires burning in the rooms to cheer the folks up\r\nand dry \'em off when they get here. To my mind there ain\'t nothin\'\r\nlike an open fire to right you if you\'re out of sorts. And likely they\r\nwill be out of sorts. Mr. Crowninshield will, that\'s sure. Now I\r\nmyself don\'t mind a gray day off and on. It\'s sorter restful and\r\ncalming. But these city people can\'t see it that way. My eye, no! They\r\nbegin to groan so you can hear \'em a mile away the minute the sun is\r\nclouded over; and by the second day of a good northeaster they are\r\ndone for. You\'d think to listen to \'em that the end of the world had\r\ncome. No motoring! No golf! No tennis! Why, they might as well be\r\ndead. They begin to wonder why they ever came here anyway and talk of\r\nnothing but how nice it is in New York. Why, you would split your\r\nsides laughing to hear Mr. Crowninshield moan for Wall Street and\r\nFifth Avenue. Three days of fog is his limit. After that ropes\r\ncouldn\'t tie him here. He tumbles his traps into a suitcase and off he\r\ngoes to the city."\r\n\r\n"Great Scott!" Walter ejaculated.\r\n\r\n"Oh, \'tain\'t a bad thing to have him go, take it by and large. He\r\nain\'t much addition here when he\'s fidgeting round, poking into\r\neverything and suggesting it better be done some other way. He\'s much\r\nbetter off somewhere else--he\'s happier and so are we. By and by he\r\ncomes back again cheerful as if nothing had happened. Mebbe it\'s as\r\nwell you should be told what\'s in store for you in foggy weather,"\r\nconcluded Jerry, with a touch of humor, "for you\'ll come in for your\r\nshare together with the rest of us. Everybody gets it. Most likely\r\nyou\'ll hear that an egg-beater is a much better thing to smooth down a\r\ndog\'s hair with than a brush; that all the world knows that and only\r\nan idiot uses anything else. Don\'t smile or venture a yip in reply.\r\nJust say you\'ll be glad to use the egg-beater if he prefers it. Remark\r\nthat, in fact, you quite hanker to try the egg-beater. To agree with\r\nhim always takes the wind out of his sails quicker\'n anything else.\r\nHe\'ll calm down soon as he sees you aren\'t ruffled and go off and hunt\r\nup somebody else to reform. And when the fog blows out to sea his\r\ntemper will go with it and he will forget he ever suggested an\r\negg-beater. Oh, we understand the boss. He\'s all right! If you only\r\nknow how to take him you\'ll never have a mite of trouble with him."\r\n\r\nBy this time they had reached the house and having removed rubbers and\r\ndripping coats they entered the basement door and proceeded to the\r\ncellar. It was not the sort of cellar with which His Highness was\r\nfamiliar although his mother\'s cellar was clean, as cellars go. This\r\none was immaculate. Indeed it seemed, on glancing about, that one\r\nmight have done far worse than live in the Crowninshields\' cellar.\r\nEvery inch of the interior was light, dry, and spotless with\r\nwhitewash, paint, and tiling. Even the coal that filled the bins had\r\ntaken on a borrowed glory and shone as if polished.\r\n\r\n"This is my kingdom!" announced Jerry proudly. "You could eat off the\r\nfloor were you so minded."\r\n\r\n"I should say you could!"\r\n\r\n"When once you\'ve set out it\'s no more work to keep things shipshape\r\nthan to let \'em go helter-skelter. Now here\'s a basket. Load into it\r\nas many of those birch logs as you can carry and bring \'em upstairs.\r\nI\'ve kindlings there already."\r\n\r\nWhile Walter was obeying these instructions Jerry himself was piling\r\nup on his lank arm a pyramid of wood, and together the two ascended\r\nthe stairway and tiptoed through the kitchen. As they went the boy\r\ncaught a glimpse of gleaming porcelain walls; ebon-hued stoves\r\nresplendent with nickel trimmings; a blue and white tiled floor; and\r\nsmart little window hangings that matched it.\r\n\r\n"They don\'t cook here!" he gasped.\r\n\r\n"Everything in the house is electric," explained Jerry, as if he were\r\nconducting a sight-seeing party through the Louvre. "All the baking,\r\nwashing, ironing, bread-making, and cleaning is done by electricity.\r\nThere\'s even an electric sewing-machine to sew with, and an electric\r\nbreeze to keep you cool while you\'re doing it. If I hadn\'t seen the\r\nthing with my own eyes I\'d never have believed it."\r\n\r\nHe paused to watch the effect of his words.\r\n\r\n"\'Tain\'t much like the way you and me are used to," he grinned.\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"I suppose in time you get so nothing knocks the breath out of you.\r\nI\'m just coming to looking round here without feeling all of a\r\nflutter. The place did used to turn me endwise at first, it was so\r\nwhite and awesome. I actually hated to set foot within its walls.\r\nSeems \'s if my fingers was always all thumbs every time I come inside\r\nthe room. Still, I had to come in though; there were things I had to\r\ndo here. So I schooled myself to forget the whiteness, and the\r\nblueness, and all the silvery glisten and call it just a kitchen.\r\nBesides, I found that grand as it is, it ain\'t a patch on some of the\r\nother things in the house. My eye! It\'s like the Arabian Nights!"\r\n\r\nThe Cape Codder stopped quite speechless from retailing these marvels.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he went on presently, "they\'ve got almost everything the\r\nelectric market has to offer. Last year, though, Mr. Dick got a\r\nhankerin\' for a wireless set. It appears that you can buy an outfit\r\nthat will make you hear concerts, sermons, speeches, and about\r\neverything that\'s going on; at least that\'s what Mr. Crowninshield\r\nundertook to tell me, though whether he was fooling or not I couldn\'t\r\nquite make out. Still, it may be true. After what I\'ve seen in this\r\nhouse I\'m ready to believe about anything. Was he to say you could put\r\nyour eye to a hole in the wall and see the Chinese eating rice in\r\nHongkong it wouldn\'t astonish me."\r\n\r\nWalter laughed.\r\n\r\n"You _can_ hear music and such things. My brother, who is a\r\nwireless operator, told me so. They broadcast all sorts of\r\nentertainments--songs, band-playing, sermons, and stories so that\r\nthose who have amateur apparatus can listen in."\r\n\r\n"Broadcast? Listen in?" repeated Jerry vaguely.\r\n\r\n"Broadcasting means sending out stuff of a specified wave length from\r\na central station so that amateurs with a range of from two hundred to\r\nthree hundred meters can pick it up."\r\n\r\nJerry halted midway in the passage.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to say," inquired he, "that a person can sling a song off\r\nthe top of a wire into the air and tell it to stop when it\'s gone two\r\nhundred meters?"\r\n\r\n"Something like that," chuckled Walter, amused.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe it!" declared Jerry bluntly.\r\n\r\n"But it can be done; really it can."\r\n\r\n"No doubt you think you are speaking the truth, youngster," returned\r\nthe skeptic mildly. "Somebody\'s stuffed you, though. Such a thing\r\ncouldn\'t be, any way in the world."\r\n\r\nAs if that were the end of the matter Jerry opened a door confronting\r\nhim and stepped into the great hall, the splendor of which instantly\r\nblotted every other thought from Walter King\'s mind.\r\n\r\nNot only was the interior spacious and imposing but it was\r\nbewilderingly beautiful and contained marvel after marvel that the lad\r\nlonged to examine. The large tiger-skin rugs that covered the floor\r\npiqued his interest, so did the chiming clock, and a fountain that\r\nwelled up and splashed into a marble pool filled with goldfish. Why,\r\nhe could have entertained himself for an hour with this latter wonder\r\nalone!\r\n\r\nThere was, however, no leisure for loitering for on hearing the\r\ncadence of the chimes Jerry ejaculated in consternation:\r\n\r\n"Eleven o\'clock already! Land alive! We\'ll have to get the fires\r\nblazing lively. Why, the folks may be here any minute now. Here, hand\r\nme one of those long sticks you\'ve got, sonny; or rather--wait! You\r\nknow how to lay a fire, don\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"I reckon I\'ve done such a thing once or twice in my lifetime," was\r\nthe dry response.\r\n\r\n"Then go ahead. You build this fire while I go upstairs and start the\r\nothers," said Jerry. "After you\'ve got this one going you can make one\r\nin the library, that red room through those curtains."\r\n\r\n"All right."\r\n\r\n"Step lively! Don\'t take all day about it."\r\n\r\nWith awkward gesture Jerry swooped up some of the logs with his long\r\narm and disappeared into the hall above.\r\n\r\nAs for Walter, he had built too many fires in his mother\'s kitchen\r\nstove and started too many blazes of driftwood on the beach to be at a\r\nloss as to how to proceed. Almost in a twinkling scarlet flames were\r\nroaring up the wide-throated chimneys and he had placed fenders before\r\nthem to keep in captivity any straying sparks. While he looked about\r\nfor a spot in which to deposit the remaining birch sticks there was a\r\nsound of horns, a crunching of gravel, and Jerry\'s scurrying feet came\r\npattering down the stairs.\r\n\r\n"It\'s the folks!" he announced excitedly. "We warn\'t a minute too\r\nsoon. Tuck those logs into the brass box; pick up your cap, laddie,\r\nand light out of here quick."\r\n\r\nThe order, alas, came too late. His Highness had only time enough to\r\nhurry the birch wood into the box and bang down the cover before\r\nflying footsteps filled the house, maids appeared from every door, and\r\nthere was a blast of wind, a babel of voices, and the discomfited boy\r\nfound himself face to face with his employers.\r\n\r\nHis first impression of Mr. Crowninshield, muffled to the chin in a\r\nheavy motor coat, was of a large, red-cheeked man who, although he\r\nmoved with little apparent stir, nevertheless in an incredibly short\r\ninterval had shaken hands with most of the servants, directed where\r\neach piece of luggage was to be put, commented on a new lock on the\r\nfront door, and noticed that the clock was two minutes slow. His\r\nmoving eye had also been caught by the roses on the table and he\r\nturned to ask from which garden they came.\r\n\r\n"All this he did, Ma," explained Walter to his mother afterward,\r\n"before you could say Jack Robinson. And in between he was scolding\r\nall the time about the weather and saying how idiotic it was to leave\r\na warm, comfortable city like New York and come to a damp hole like\r\nthe Cape."\r\n\r\n"Is this the best day you could manage to get together, Jerry?"\r\ngrowled he. "Pretty beastly, I call it."\r\n\r\n"It certainly is wet, sir."\r\n\r\n"Wet! I should say it was! It\'s infernally wet! How long is it going\r\nto keep up like this?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t say, sir."\r\n\r\n"Well, you have the sun out to-morrow or I shall go straight back\r\nwhere I came from. Little old New York is good enough for me when the\r\nplace looks like this."\r\n\r\nAt that instant he espied His Highness lurking near a distant window.\r\n\r\n"Who are you, young man?" he called.\r\n\r\n"Walter King, sir."\r\n\r\n"Oh, the young chap who is going to look after the dogs?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"Humph! Like dogs?"\r\n\r\n"I--yes, sir," answered the lad at a warning glance from Jerry.\r\n\r\nRuthlessly the hawklike eyes devoured him.\r\n\r\n"So you think you can take care of a lot of prize pups, do you?"\r\n\r\n"I am going to try," was the modest reply.\r\n\r\n"You can\'t stop with trying, my son. You\'ve got to do it," announced\r\nthe man sharply.\r\n\r\n"I shall do my best."\r\n\r\n"That is all I shall ask."\r\n\r\nA sudden smile melted the stern countenance into geniality and the\r\nmaster held out a hand.\r\n\r\n"So King is your name."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"It is a royal one and gives you something to live up to."\r\n\r\nAs the boy did not know what to answer he was silent.\r\n\r\n"And you like dogs?" said the inquisitor more kindly.\r\n\r\n"I like all animals," returned Walter evasively, "and I am sure I\r\nshall like your dogs because you always like anything you take care\r\nof."\r\n\r\n"So you do! I remember when I was about your age I tamed an old brown\r\nweasel. He was a wretch of a creature with scarcely a virtue--cruel,\r\ndeceitful, cold-blooded; and yet I grew to love that brute as much as\r\nif he had had the gentleness of a dove. You know how it is."\r\n\r\nWalter nodded. For the moment the two came together on a plane of real\r\ncontact and sympathy, and the smile the elder gave him bound the lad\r\nto his new employer as no spoken words could possibly have done.\r\n\r\nBut a second later Mr. Crowninshield\'s mood had changed and he was\r\nstorming at Mary, the waitress, and demanding whether she meant to\r\nfreeze them all by leaving the outside door open. Walter could see the\r\ngirl flush red and as he leaped forward to close the door she flashed\r\nhim a grateful, tremulous smile. Then Mr. Crowninshield turned toward\r\nhis wife.\r\n\r\n"Mollie," he replied, "this is Walter King who is going to look after\r\nyour dogs. Come and speak to him."\r\n\r\nThe mistress of the house came. She was wearing a long blue traveling\r\ncoat and a jaunty little hat against which the gold of her hair was\r\nresplendent as sunshine. Tucked under her arm was a wee dog with soft\r\nbrown fur and sharp little eyes. Mrs. Crowninshield was very pretty,\r\nespecially when she spoke. As Walter looked into her face he found it\r\nso amazingly youthful that it was difficult for him to believe she was\r\nactually the mother of a grown son and daughter.\r\n\r\n"So it is you who are to be master of the kennels?" smiled she,\r\nshowing her even white teeth.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mrs. Crowninshield," faltered His Highness, a trifle overcome by\r\nthis new title.\r\n\r\nFrom head to foot her glance swept over him.\r\n\r\n"Well," said she at length, "if you keep the puppies as tidy as you\r\nkeep yourself I fancy we shall get on nicely together."\r\n\r\nA flood of color mounted to the lad\'s forehead. He had not anticipated\r\nsuch close inspection and instinctively he began to fumble with the\r\ncorner of his sweater and look nervously down at his hands. They must\r\nbe very dirty from making the fires. And he had been actually greeting\r\nMr. and Mrs. Crowninshield with paws like those! The horror of it\r\nchilled his blood.\r\n\r\nApparently the woman, with swift intuition, read his thought for she\r\ndimpled at him in friendly fashion.\r\n\r\n"Do not worry about your hands, my boy," said she. "You have been\r\ndoing useful things to soil them, things to bid us welcome and make us\r\nmore comfortable. I can see you started out clean. I have a boy of my\r\nown, you know. Richard," she went on, turning to a tall youth who was\r\nbending over the luggage, "this is Walter King who is coming to look\r\nafter the kennels. He must be about your age."\r\n\r\nThe boys stared at each other awkwardly.\r\n\r\n"I am fifteen," announced Walter for the lack of something more\r\nbrilliant to say.\r\n\r\n"I beat you by a year," was the shy retort of the other boy. "I am\r\nsixteen."\r\n\r\nThen Nancy interrupted them with her breezy comment.\r\n\r\n"Fifteen, are you?" she put in. "My, I should not have thought it! You\r\nmust be pretty crazy about dogs to give up all your summer vacation to\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"My mother needs the money," was the simple answer.\r\n\r\n"Oh!"\r\n\r\nHe saw her blush as if regretting her thoughtless remark.\r\n\r\n"It is nice of you to help your mother," she observed quickly. "I am\r\nsure you will not find the place so bad. We shall try to make you\r\nhappy."\r\n\r\nWith that she was gone but she left behind her a memory of sweetness\r\nand appealing kindliness.\r\n\r\n"You might run out to the garage now, sonny," declared Jerry with a\r\ndesire to help the lad make his escape. "They will be landing the pups\r\nthere soon, and you may as well be on hand."\r\n\r\nOnly too glad to beat a retreat His Highness picked up his cap and\r\nslipping from the room raced across the lawn in the direction of his\r\nown quarters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE CONQUEST OF ACHILLES\r\n\r\n\r\nJerry\'s prediction proved to be quite true for as His Highness neared\r\nthe garage a hum of activity pervaded it. Four mud-caked cars stood in\r\nthe driveway and chauffeurs in their shirt sleeves hurried in and out\r\nthe building, shouting to one another and carrying in their hands\r\ngrimy rags and cans of oil. A short half hour had transformed the\r\nquiet spot to a beehive of noise and bustle. The rush seemed\r\ncontagious for wherever one looked moving figures could be seen. Some\r\ncrossed the lawn bearing belated satchels or traveling wraps which in\r\nthe confusion had found their way into the wrong place; some strode\r\ntoward the boathouse, some toward the garden, some to the stables. Men\r\nappeared to have risen through the earth so quickly had their numbers\r\nmultiplied.\r\n\r\nNo longer was there the leisurely loitering and smoking that had\r\nmarked the week before. A spirit of activity was infused into the air\r\nuntil even those who had no cause to hurry scrambled with the rest.\r\n\r\nAs Walter approached the garage he was waylaid by a young chauffeur\r\nwith rosy cheeks and a crisp, pleasant voice:\r\n\r\n"Say, youngster, don\'t you want to lend a hand with these cushions?"\r\ninterrogated he, beaming ingratiatingly. "They have got to be beaten\r\nand brushed before they can go back in the car. Chuck them over on the\r\nfloor for me, won\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Sure!" was the ready answer. "I\'ll beat them for you if you like."\r\n\r\n"You\'re a good-natured little cuss," grinned the man. "I\'m not asking\r\nyou to do that, though."\r\n\r\n"But I\'d be glad to."\r\n\r\n"Suit yourself. But in my opinion you are a fool to take on jobs you\r\nare not hired to do and get no money for."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t care about the money."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t, eh?" chimed in the derisive note of another chauffeur who\r\nhad at the instant come out of the doorway. "Say, who are you, anyway?\r\nOne of the Vanderbilts?"\r\n\r\n"Quit heckling the young one, Peters," put in the chauffeur of the red\r\ncheeks. "He\'s a good sort, all right."\r\n\r\n"Ha, ha, Wheeler! You think that because you\'ve jollied him into doing\r\nyour work for you, you old shirk."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t jolly him into anything. He offered."\r\n\r\n"A likely story."\r\n\r\n"But he did."\r\n\r\n"Then you should have told him better," sniffed the other. "You know\r\nwell enough it isn\'t etiquette round here to do a stroke of work for\r\nanybody else or accept a stroke. _Every man for himself_ is the\r\nmotto."\r\n\r\n"But that\'s a rotten way!" Walter ejaculated impulsively. "I\'d hate to\r\nlive like that--never being willing to help anybody or ask them to\r\nhelp me."\r\n\r\nThe man called Peters gave him a contemptuous stare.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll find there\'s no whining or asking help of other people here,"\r\nannounced he, with a sneer. "Those that are darn fools enough to get\r\ninto holes get out of them as best they can. It\'s their hunt."\r\n\r\nSpitting emphatically on the ground he proceeded to go into the garage\r\nwith the tire he was carrying.\r\n\r\nWalter took up a stick he saw lying near by.\r\n\r\n"What are you going to do?" demanded the red-cheeked man, regarding\r\nhim with unconcealed surprise.\r\n\r\n"Beat the cushions."\r\n\r\n"But--but--heavens, sonny! Didn\'t you hear what Peters said?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I heard. I don\'t have to sign up to a creed like that,\r\nthough, if I don\'t want to, do I?"\r\n\r\n"We all do. We agree neither to borrow, lend, nor ask favors."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid I shan\'t make one of the gang then," observed Walter, with\r\na smile so good-humored that the words could not offend.\r\n\r\n"Then the more fool you, that is all I can say," laughed Wheeler. "By\r\nthe end of a month you won\'t have so much as a collar button to your\r\nname. Everything you own will be gone, especially your tools. We\'re a\r\nlot of pirates. I give you fair warning."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not afraid you\'ll want much that I\'ve got," grinned Walter.\r\n\r\nThe upraised stick descended in a series of rhythmic blows, sending\r\ninto the air a cloud of dust.\r\n\r\n"Where\'s the brush?" panted the boy, when he had beaten until his arm\r\nached.\r\n\r\n"Say, kid, I\'m not going to have you breaking your back over my job,"\r\nasserted Wheeler in a friendly tone.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not breaking my back."\r\n\r\n"But what on earth are you doing it _for_?" questioned the man, his\r\neyes narrowing with curiosity.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know myself," returned the lad shyly. "It was just the way I\r\nwas brought up, I guess."\r\n\r\nFor an interval only the sweeping of the brush broke the stillness.\r\n\r\n"I was brought up to be decent, too," observed Wheeler slowly, "but\r\nsomehow since I\'ve been knocking round I\'ve got to be an awful brute.\r\nThere isn\'t any very high standard among the crowd I mix in. Still,\r\nI\'m afraid that isn\'t much of an excuse for shifting back into a\r\nsavage." He paused thoughtfully, then added, "I\'m much obliged to you,\r\nsonny, for your help, and just to show you I don\'t forget it, sometime\r\nwhen you are hard put hunt me up and ask me to give you a lift. I\'m a\r\nhuman being though you may not think so."\r\n\r\nWith a little glow at his heart Walter moved away toward the kennels.\r\n\r\nHe had made a friend, and in this new environment where he was\r\nconscious of being very much of an outsider the consciousness brought\r\nhim a sense of comradeship and happiness.\r\n\r\nIt was fortunate, however, that his altruism had detained him no\r\nlonger for before he reached the spot where the dogs were to be\r\nquartered he heard a chorus of sharp yelps and saw what appeared to be\r\na dozen dogs coming across the lawn accompanied by Mrs. Crowninshield\r\nand two of the stablemen. Some of the pack were being led, while\r\nothers, wild with joy at finding themselves unconfined, leaped and\r\ncapered wildly about their mistress. A great police dog, straining at\r\nthe leash, gave Walter a thrill of mingled admiration and timidity. He\r\nwas a huge creature with mottled coat and mighty jaws, and within his\r\nopen mouth, from which lolled his red tongue, were cruel white teeth\r\nthat could do unthinkable things. His wide brown eyes, his pointing\r\ntail, his upright ears moving with every sound, his alert poise all\r\nbespoke keenness and intelligence. A dog one would far rather have for\r\nan ally than an enemy, thought the boy.\r\n\r\nBeside pranced two Airedales and a white Sealyham and to their babel\r\nof barking was added the shrill, sympathetic note of five or six\r\nPekingese, one of which Mrs. Crowninshield carried under her arm.\r\n\r\n"Hush, Achilles!" she cried. "Hush, all of you! Stop your racket this\r\ninstant! They are excited at being together again," explained she to\r\nWalter who had approached. "The Belgian and Airedales have been\r\nboarded out during the winter and have not seen the others for months.\r\nSo, you see, this is a sort of reunion for them and they have to bark\r\nto show their delight. Moreover, they have had a long trip and are\r\ntired and hungry. I am going to feed them now and this meal will last\r\nmost of them until to-morrow at the same hour."\r\n\r\n"Are they fed only once a day?" gasped Walter.\r\n\r\n"That is all. You see you will not have many meals to prepare,"\r\nlaughed Mrs. Crowninshield. "Only the Peeks have breakfast, but only\r\npart of a square of puppy biscuit or some bread; so it is very simple.\r\nDinner, however, is much more complicated and later I shall give you\r\nyour directions as to just what every dog must have; to-night we are\r\nto treat the lot to some raw meat, toast, and spinach."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll let me help you," pleaded Walter.\r\n\r\n"Certainly. That is why I came out. I want you to feed the dogs and\r\nlearn their names. In order to get on with them you must get\r\nacquainted with them and understand the peculiarities of each one.\r\nThey are just persons, you know, and have their little whims and\r\nqueernesses. But kindness will win them to you very quickly. It is far\r\nbetter than a whip. So is feeding. A dog usually obeys the person who\r\nfeeds him. He is afraid not to."\r\n\r\nAs she spoke she entered the wired enclosure and putting the smaller\r\ndogs in half of it and shutting the wicket gate upon them she told the\r\nmen to slip the leashes from the collars of the others. In a second\r\nthe Belgian, Airedales, and the fluffy Sealyham were bounding about\r\nher. Then she beckoned to Walter.\r\n\r\n"This is Achilles," went on she, with her hand on the head of the\r\ngreat monster. "He is as gentle and kind as a kitten, although he does\r\nlook as if he could swallow us alive. Don\'t touch him but stand still\r\nand let him sniff you all over. It is his way of getting acquainted."\r\n\r\nObediently the boy remained motionless while the panting jaws and\r\nmoist black nose of the dog came nearer. He could feel the creature\'s\r\nhot breath on his hands, face, and hair. Then over his clothing moved\r\nthe quivering nostrils. At length the brown eyes met his and he\r\nwhispered softly:\r\n\r\n"Achilles!"\r\n\r\nThe dog wagged his tail.\r\n\r\n"You have nothing to fear from him now," announced Mrs. Crowninshield.\r\n"The Airedales are Jack Horner and Boy Blue. And the Sealyham, Miss\r\nNancy\'s dog, is called Rags."\r\n\r\nSensing that he was being talked about, the dog blinked with friendly\r\neyes at Walter through its mop of coarse white hair.\r\n\r\n"In the other pen," continued Mrs. Crowninshield, "are the Pekingese\r\npups and I shall expect you to take the best of care of them. They are\r\nsensitive little creatures and very valuable. I myself, however, care\r\nvery little for the money value of a dog. It is the lovable traits it\r\nhas that interest me. I should adore wee Lola, here, if she were not\r\nworth a cent. But Mr. Crowninshield likes to own blue ribbon dogs and\r\nenter them at the shows and therefore I will caution you that Lola,\r\nMimi, and Fifi," as she spoke she pointed out the dogs in question,\r\n"cost quite a fortune and their loss or illness would be a great\r\ncalamity. So you must follow the directions concerning them most\r\ncarefully. And should any question arise about them come at once to\r\nme."\r\n\r\nAs she spoke she occasionally glanced at the boy beside her with a\r\nquick, bright smile.\r\n\r\n"I shall have the menu for each dog sent you every day--at least for\r\nthe present--together with directions as to how to prepare the meal as\r\nit should be prepared. The meat for the small dogs must be put through\r\na meat chopper and no gristle allowed to get into it; the larger dogs\r\ncan have bigger pieces, and Achilles a bone. You will find in the room\r\ninside an ice chest in which to keep such foods as spoil. There are\r\nalso glassed-in shelves where tins of various kinds of dog bread and\r\npuppy biscuit will be stored that they may be out of the dampness. You\r\nare not to trouble the servants at the big house for anything. They do\r\nnot like to be interfered with. All your supplies will be here, and\r\nyou can warm whatever it is necessary to heat on your small electric\r\nstove. Be sure to scald out the dishes after they have been used; and\r\nalso never forget to keep the bowls filled with plenty of fresh\r\nwater."\r\n\r\n"I will, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"I am sure you will," returned Mrs. Crowninshield kindly. "And do not\r\nworry if it takes a little time to win all the dogs over to your\r\nauthority. Dogs are like children when they change masters. They will\r\ntry to play it on you at first. Just be firm with them and soon you\r\nwill have them tagging at your heels, docile as lambs."\r\n\r\nThe task of preparing the food was soon completed and the mistress\r\nlooked on and encouraged while Walter doled it out to the famished\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nHow daintily the wee dogs coquetted with what was given them! And how\r\ngreedily the larger ones gobbled down their allowance and lapped the\r\nplate for more! Achilles, crouched on the lawn with his bone, crunched\r\nit with terrifying zeal, cracking the big joint between his jaws as if\r\nit were made of paper. His dinner devoured he ambled over toward\r\nWalter, once more sniffed his shoes and clothing, at last nestled his\r\nmoist nose against the boy\'s hand.\r\n\r\n"I think you have won Achilles to your colors already," said Mrs.\r\nCrowninshield.\r\n\r\n"He does seem friendly," returned His Highness, more pleased by the\r\ndog\'s good will than he would have been willing to own.\r\n\r\n"Achilles can be very friendly when he chooses," retorted his owner.\r\n"He can also be quite the reverse. You should see him sometime when he\r\nis on the scent of a foe. Last summer when a man broke into the\r\nboathouse it transformed Achilles into a lion. I was certain he would\r\nkill the fellow; as it was he mauled him badly before we could coax\r\nhim off. The thief almost died of fright and I do not wonder. He did\r\nnot need any further punishment."\r\n\r\nShe unfastened the gate to go back to the house.\r\n\r\nImmediately there was a rush.\r\n\r\n"No, you can\'t come, not one of you," declared she, addressing the\r\nyelping pack through the netting. "I have far too much to do to be\r\nbothered with any of you. Be good and take a nap. You\'re tired enough\r\nto rest."\r\n\r\nStill the animals barked, rebellious at their captivity.\r\n\r\n"When I am out of sight you can let Achilles out," called she, as she\r\nmoved away. "He can be trusted to roam the place and always does when\r\nwe\'re here. The Airedales and the Sealyham can also run about alone as\r\nsoon as they get used to obeying you. But the little dogs must never\r\nbe let off the leash unless they are watched every instant, for\r\nsomething might happen to them."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be careful."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right; do."\r\n\r\nThe woman gave him a pleasant nod of farewell and walked with\r\nspringing step back in the direction of the house. As she went Walter\r\nsaw her halt and speak to old Tim, who was at work in the rose garden,\r\nand beheld the gardener leap proudly forward to cut for her a blossom\r\nshe had evidently admired.\r\n\r\nIt was even as Jerry had said. She was the idol of Surfside.\r\n\r\nAfter she had disappeared he opened the wicket and stepped out,\r\nletting Achilles follow him.\r\n\r\nInstantly the great creature put his nose to the ground and with a\r\njoyous bark he was gone in search of his mistress.\r\n\r\nIt was now or never with the new master of the hounds.\r\n\r\nThe lad whistled but the dog did not turn. Again he gave a quick call.\r\nThis time the rushing beast paused, looked round, and then slackening\r\nhis pace, continued to jog along on his way.\r\n\r\nHelplessly the boy saw him go farther and farther out of reach.\r\n\r\nHe must compel obedience somehow.\r\n\r\n"Achilles!" shouted he sternly. "Achilles! Back, sir!"\r\n\r\nAlthough he uttered the words he had not the slightest faith they\r\nwould have any effect and was amazed to see the dog waver in his\r\ntracks.\r\n\r\n"Achilles, come here!" repeated he sharply.\r\n\r\nWith reluctance the dog turned and looked at him.\r\n\r\n"Here, sir!" called Walter, with coaxing cadence.\r\n\r\nThe dog continued to regard him intently but he did not move. Then\r\nsuddenly there was a rush and with panting jaws widespread the Belgian\r\ncame bounding toward him. It was not until he was close at hand that\r\nhe abated his speed. Then he came to the side of his new master and\r\ngently laid his cold nose on his sleeve.\r\n\r\nWalter patted the great head affectionately.\r\n\r\nThe battle was won. He had conquered Achilles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nHIS HIGHNESS IN A NEW ROLE\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore a week had passed the strangeness of living at Surfside had to\r\na certain extent abated and Walter found himself not only content in\r\nhis new position but enjoying it. He rose early, feeding the dogs,\r\nexercising them, and making fresh their quarters before he breakfasted\r\nhimself. Afterward, despite the score of odd duties with which the\r\nmorning was filled, he contrived to do many little kindnesses for\r\nJerry, Tim, Wheeler, and the other men. He was always willing to do a\r\nfavor and amid an atmosphere where generosity was rare the virtue of\r\naiding others rendered him immensely popular.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime he had made such headway in the affections of Achilles\r\nthat the big Belgian not only tagged at his heels everywhere he went,\r\nbut at night insisted upon extending his giant frame before the boy\'s\r\ndoorsill from which vantage ground neither threats nor persuasions\r\ncould stir him. In consequence the lonely hours the lad might have\r\nexperienced were put to rout by the companionship of this silent\r\ncomrade.\r\n\r\nThe Airedales, on the other hand, were less successfully won over to a\r\nnew allegiance. Although Richard, who owned them, took not the\r\nsmallest care of them and serenely passed them over to some one else\r\nto be ministered unto, nevertheless they apparently sensed the\r\narrangement was one of convenience and returned scant gratitude for\r\nwhat was done for them. They were polite, tolerant, but never\r\nwhole-heartedly cordial. Dick was their master and they would have no\r\nother.\r\n\r\nFortunately Miss Nancy\'s Sealyham, Rags, was more responsive;\r\nnevertheless, although she frolicked about Walter\'s feet and accepted\r\nfood from his hand it was more because she loved to play and was\r\nhungry than because her affection for the boy went very deep.\r\n\r\nAs for the troupe of Pekingese, with aristocratic noses tilted high in\r\nair, they submitted to being washed, brushed, and fed by Walter much\r\nas they would have accepted the services of any other maid or valet.\r\nThey seemed to be conscious of their pedigree and claim attention as\r\ntheir right. An occasional wag of the tail or the rare passage of a\r\nrough little tongue across one\'s hand was all the gratitude His\r\nHighness ever received from them.\r\n\r\nWith the Crowninshield family, however, the boy made better progress\r\nand as he and Dick became acquainted many a pleasant hour did they\r\nspend together. Not infrequently, when the eager yelps of the dogs\r\nheralded the fact that they were off for their afternoon run, the New\r\nYork lad would join the party and while the animals raced this way and\r\nthat the two boys would discuss boats, fishing, and kindred\r\ninterests.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The two boys would discuss boats, fishing, and kindred\r\ninterests. _Page_ 76.]\r\n\r\n"Do you happen to know anything about wireless?" inquired Richard one\r\nday when, with Achilles prancing far ahead and Boy Blue, Jack Horner,\r\nand Rags dashing to keep up with him, the group strode along the\r\nbeach.\r\n\r\n"I ought to," was Walter\'s smiling response. "I\'ve a brother who is an\r\noperator at the Seaver Bay station."\r\n\r\n"No! Really?" The exclamations voiced both surprise and admiration.\r\n"How old is he?"\r\n\r\n"Twenty-two or three."\r\n\r\n"Gee! And he can really send and receive messages?"\r\n\r\n"He sure can."\r\n\r\n"How did he learn?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, he first got interested in wireless through the papers and picked\r\nup quite a lot of information that way. Later he and his chum Billy\r\nHicks bought a manual and with the help of the physics teacher at the\r\nHigh School they rigged up a homemade receiving apparatus on Billy\'s\r\ngrandfather\'s barn. For a while it wouldn\'t work for a cent, although\r\nthey tinkered with it night and day. Then one evening they did\r\nsomething to it and caught their first message. You should have seen\r\nBob! He was crazy and came rushing straight home to make Ma drop\r\neverything she was doing and go down to Hicks\'s. Now Mother was\r\nelbow-deep in bread and declared she couldn\'t spoil her biscuit for\r\nany wireless on earth. Besides, she had never had any faith in the\r\nthing. You see, Bob had teased her for wireless money and she had told\r\nhim time and time again it was dollars thrown into a hole. My father\r\nused to joke her about not having a scientific mind and I guess she\r\nhasn\'t one. At any rate, whenever Bob would read her the wonderful\r\nthings being done with wireless, all she would say was that it wasn\'t\r\nlikely folks could send speeches and music loose through the air.\r\nThose who pretended to hear them were either fibbing or were genuinely\r\nmistaken. So when Bob did get a broadcast you can imagine how wild he\r\nwas to convince her it wasn\'t all bluff."\r\n\r\n"And did he?" asked Dick with interest.\r\n\r\n"Well, after a fashion," replied Walter, smiling at some amusing\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\n"Like enough I shouldn\'t have known much about it, either, if Bob had\r\nnot told me," continued Walter. "Bob, however, talked nothing else\r\nmorning, noon, and night. Often I would drop asleep while he was\r\nchattering of induction coils, wave lengths, and antenna. It makes me\r\nyawn now to think of it. My goodness, weren\'t Ma and I sick to death\r\nof hearing nothing but radio! Bob would rush into the house at\r\nmealtime, swallow his food whole, and tear off to Hicks\'s with a piece\r\nof pie in his hand, leaving all the chores to me. I got pretty sore, I\r\ncan tell you." He gave a short laugh.\r\n\r\n"Between Mother begrudging the poor chap every cent he spent for\r\nbatteries and wire, and me pitching into him for forgetting to chop\r\nthe kindlings, I\'m afraid his early wireless career wasn\'t a very\r\npleasant one."\r\n\r\nOnce more the lad laughed, this time with comic ruefulness.\r\n\r\n"Even when the apparatus actually did begin to work and Bob and Billy\r\nwere able to get a concert or lecture now and then, Ma insisted they\r\nwere bluffing her. She listened in but wasn\'t convinced, declaring\r\nthey had fastened a victrola to the receivers and that such sounds\r\nnever could come through the air. Finally they did succeed in getting\r\nher to half believe they were telling her the truth and were not just\r\nworking her for money. But when they tried to explain the outfit to\r\nher in detail, she put her hands over her ears, protesting that they\r\nwere wasting their breath to tell her of damped and undamped waves,\r\ndetectors, and generators. With that they gave up further attempts to\r\neducate her."\r\n\r\nBoth boys chuckled.\r\n\r\n"But she must be proud of your brother now," asserted Dick.\r\n\r\n"Oh, she is--tremendously, although what she chiefly thinks about is\r\nthe danger Bob is in of getting struck by lightning or electrocuted."\r\n\r\nAchilles, who had been pursuing some sandpipers along the rim of the\r\nsurf and sent them circling into the air, now raced back to his\r\nfriends with a sharp bark of salutation and Dick bent to pat the\r\nshaggy head.\r\n\r\n"So really," reflected he, "your brother taught himself wireless."\r\n\r\n"Not wholly. He simply laid a foundation," the other boy explained.\r\n"He could never have taken a job on what he had picked up because,\r\nyou see, he knew nothing of sending messages, was ignorant of all the\r\nrules an operator has to have at his tongue\'s end, and had no very\r\nthorough knowledge of electricity. It was not like a complete\r\ntraining, by any means. The war gave him that. When it broke out he\r\nenlisted in the navy, and because he was partially equipped in radio\r\nthey sent him off posthaste to a wireless school. At the time he was\r\ncrazy because his dream was to get across and be in the fighting. To\r\nsit at home studying was the last thing he wanted to do. Later,\r\nthough, when he began to see what a big part wireless was playing in\r\nthe scrimmage, he commenced to be more resigned to his lot. Besides he\r\ngot his chance before long, for he worked into being a crackerjack at\r\nspeed and passed his exams so well that he had no trouble in winning\r\nhis first-class operator\'s certificate.\r\n\r\n"There are grades of radio men, you know, just as there are grades of\r\neverything else. There are the sharks, or first-class chaps, who are\r\nable to pass every sort of test on the adjustment of apparatus and how\r\nto use it; who can both send and receive messages at the rate of at\r\nleast twenty words a minute, and who can often go much faster; and who\r\nhave all the rules governing the exchange of radio messages stowed\r\naway in their heads. They are the A1 men and every first-class ship is\r\nobliged by law to have aboard it two of them. Then there are the\r\nsecond-class certificate fellows who practically have as much radio\r\nbut cannot hit such a gait, and can only manage to send between\r\ntwelve and nineteen words a minute. They can go on first-class ships\r\nprovided more skilled operators are aboard. Sometimes, even, they\r\nsubstitute for them under supervision. Their chief jobs, however, are\r\non ships that use wireless only for their personal benefit; that is,\r\nto talk with their own crews. Often a fishing fleet, for instance,\r\nwill carry a man of this class to communicate with its other vessels.\r\nThey can talk, too, with shore stations when it is necessary. But the\r\nlaw does not allow them to take positions where there is a great rush\r\nof business and general responsibility. They must have the topnotchers\r\nfor such work."\r\n\r\n"I had no idea there were so many rules about radio," mused Dick.\r\n\r\n"There are--strict ones, too," replied his companion. "Moreover, the\r\ngovernment keeps tabs on all radio people to see they obey the rules.\r\nEvery wireless man is examined, classified, and given a license just\r\nas an automobile driver is. He has to keep it handy, too, and be ready\r\nto trot it out on request. You can\'t get by with bluffing. If an\r\noperator is found to be unfamiliar with the rules, or is discovered\r\nbreaking any of them, his certificate can be withdrawn. No chap wants\r\nto risk that, especially if he is trying to earn his living by\r\nwireless. And if a ship, and not its radio operator, is found to be\r\nbreaking the rules, the coastal stations may be notified not to have\r\nanything to do with her. In other words she is boycotted and the land\r\noperators told neither to receive her messages nor answer them."\r\n\r\n"That would be some boycott!"\r\n\r\n"The shipboard radio stations, you see, come under the authority of\r\nthe commanding officer of the ship. It has to be so, because in case\r\nof accident he would be the person responsible for sending out\r\ndistress calls and answering them. The radio man couldn\'t just grab\r\nthe power. There has to be one boss of every job."\r\n\r\n"I can see that," nodded Dick. "But why such a network of other\r\nrules?"\r\n\r\n"There have to be. It all has to be charted in black and white or\r\nthere would be terrible mix-ups."\r\n\r\n"And do foreign ships have to fall into line and do as our ships do\r\nwhen they come here?"\r\n\r\n"They are expected to, Bob said," answered Walter. "In case they do\r\nnot, however, they cannot be meddled with by underlings. Instead they\r\nare immediately reported to the government and the two countries\r\ninvolved settle their dispute by arbitration. It is too delicate a\r\nmatter for others to butt in on, for some blunderer might offend\r\nanother country and get us into war just through being stupid.\r\nConversely, when our ships are in foreign waters they must keep the\r\nnaval rules of the nation they are visiting."\r\n\r\n"That\'s fair."\r\n\r\n"It sure is," agreed Walter. "Besides that, all the shipboard radio\r\nstations have to carry with them their license to prove that they are\r\nauthorized by their countries to operate a wireless outfit, and that\r\nthey fulfil the requirements of the government whose flag they fly.\r\nShould any trouble arise when they are in a foreign port they can be\r\nasked to produce this license; and if the foreign authorities whom\r\nthey are visiting have reason to suspect they are not meeting the\r\nstandards the license demands they can complain to the government that\r\nis responsible for the ship."\r\n\r\n"But suppose the government didn\'t know anything about such a ship?"\r\n\r\n"Great Scott! But it does, man," ejaculated Walter. "There are lists\r\nthat contain not only the name and nationality of all ships but even\r\nthe names and addresses of its radio operators. There is no getting by\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"So the ships themselves are not allowed to take up their own quarrel\r\nif they are challenged?" commented Dick.\r\n\r\n"No. They simply have to stay perfectly polite and keep their mouths\r\nshut, no matter how mad they are," grinned His Highness. "Otherwise\r\nthere would be squabbles all the time, for there are always\r\nmisunderstandings and grudges, and people who enjoy picking on one\r\nanother. All the ships would be fighting and the countries that owned\r\nthem, too, if everybody rolled up his sleeves and pitched into the\r\nother fellow when things went wrong. Governments are supposed to be\r\nmore slow-moving, fair, and impartial. And anyhow, it is their job to\r\nlook out for their own citizens and see they are squarely treated. Bob\r\nsays it is a more dignified way than for individuals to fight out\r\ntheir own quarrels. It certainly carries more weight. Nobody is going\r\nto bully a ship and make trouble for its crew if a big nation stands\r\nbehind it. It serves as a check on the men, too, Bob told me, for when\r\nthey are in other countries and have shore leave they have to remember\r\nthat they must behave themselves and not disgrace their governments."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t sail out of reach of Uncle Sam, eh? Apparently he knows in\r\na general way just how you are conducting yourself all the time,"\r\nsmiled Dick.\r\n\r\n"That\'s about it," acquiesced Walter.\r\n\r\nWhistling to the dogs, they turned about.\r\n\r\n"What a pile you know about all this," Dick presently observed.\r\n\r\n"Shucks! No, I don\'t," blushed His Highness. "I am only repeating what\r\nBob spieled off to me. He likes to talk when he\'s home and I like to\r\nlisten. It\'s interesting--at least I think so. Besides, I\'m proud of\r\nBob knowing such a lot. I wish I did."\r\n\r\nThe lad dug his heel into the moist sand and watched the hole fill\r\nwith water.\r\n\r\n"Somehow I\'m an awful boob at books," he suddenly confessed. "I hate\r\nso to study that Ma fairly has to haul me along by the hair or I\'d\r\nnever go to school. I barely skinned through this year. Up to the very\r\nlast minute we all had cold chills for fear I wouldn\'t."\r\n\r\nDick shot the offender a sympathetic glance.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t like reading about things myself so well as doing them," he\r\nconfided. "I\'m crazy about machinery. It\'s fun to tinker with\r\nit--take it to pieces and put it together again. I like nothing better\r\nthan to overhaul an engine."\r\n\r\nHe held up two grease-stained hands.\r\n\r\n"It horrifies my mother," he continued, "but my father doesn\'t seem to\r\nmind if I am all black with oil from my car or the motor boats. What I\r\nwant now is a wireless outfit. I\'m going to strike Dad for one my\r\nbirthday. It comes the last of this month and he might as well give me\r\nthat as anything else. Do you suppose if he got it we could rig it up\r\ntogether?"\r\n\r\nWalter\'s eyes opened at the casualness of the observation.\r\n\r\nIn his family a birthday was an occasion for a chocolate cake, some\r\nneckties, and perhaps a pair of rubber boots or a similar useful gift.\r\nOr it sometimes brought with it a book and a box of candy. Never by\r\nany chance did its felicitations expand into a gift so colossal as a\r\nwireless apparatus. The breach between the two lads, which during the\r\nexchange of confidences had narrowed into nothingness, widened\r\nabruptly.\r\n\r\n"A good set would be some present," he commented, thinking, perhaps,\r\nthe other boy might be ignorant of its value.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I guess it would not break Dad," smiled Dick serenely. "He gave\r\nme my car last year, and the year before--let me think--oh, the pups!"\r\nHe pointed to the Airedales, a streak of buff against the green of the\r\ndistant marsh. "Wireless couldn\'t cost much more."\r\n\r\n"N--o, I don\'t believe it would," His Highness admitted slowly, the\r\ncontrast in their financial standards seeping in on him.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I imagine I could have a set all right if I said the word,"\r\ncontinued Dick, with the indifference of one to whom such presents\r\nbrought no agitation. "The question is, could we set it up if we had\r\nit?"\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t," came promptly from Walter. "I think, though, that if Bob\r\nwas home on leave he might help us."\r\n\r\n"Your brother? I had forgotten him. So he is at home sometimes?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes. He gets off for a day now and then."\r\n\r\n"It must be a whole lot of a bore to be tied down in a wireless\r\nstation listening for messages all the time," observed Dick\r\ncarelessly.\r\n\r\n"Operators do not have to sit with their ears glued to the receivers\r\nevery second, man," declared the village lad. "The men are relieved at\r\nregular hours. Besides, all stations both on shore and on shipboard\r\nare divided into classes and have their hours carefully mapped out for\r\nthem. There are three different varieties of shipboard stations, for\r\nexample. Some have constant service; that is, operators are always\r\nlistening while the ship is underway. Then there is a second sort\r\nwhere the operator listens in only during specified hours when the\r\noffice is open for business. A third class has no fixed hours at all,\r\nthe radio man just listening the first ten minutes of each hour."\r\n\r\n"So the men just suit themselves, eh?"\r\n\r\n"Suit themselves! You bet they don\'t," laughed Walter. "The government\r\ndefines their hours when their license is issued. The class they are\r\nput in decides it."\r\n\r\n"That\'s news to me," said Dick. "And the shore stations?"\r\n\r\n"The shore stations are a chapter in themselves," Walter replied.\r\n"There are several different kinds and each kind has its own rules."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t propose to tell me about them, then," retorted the New\r\nYorker mischievously.\r\n\r\n"It\'s too long a yarn," answered the other. "Besides, I might not get\r\nit straight. Sometime, though, if you want me to, I\'ll pass on what I\r\nknow. But to-day I guess we ought to be hiking back. It is close onto\r\nthe time the pack is fed and I may have them yelping at my throat if I\r\ndon\'t hurry."\r\n\r\nQuickening their pace the boys whistled to the dogs who came dashing\r\nthrough the clumps of bayberry that dotted the field. They were\r\npanting with thirst and only too ready to turn homeward. Across the\r\nsandy hillocks, through pine-shaded stretches of woods, along the road\r\nwalled in with June roses they raced and chased, stopping now and\r\nagain to look back and make certain that their masters were following.\r\nWhen the spit of sand narrowed to a ribbon and the entrance to\r\nSurfside was reached they halted, lying down to cool off in the fresh\r\nsea breeze until they should be overtaken. At the gate Dick and Walter\r\nparted.\r\n\r\nIt was amusing to see the Airedales waver, then lured by hunger,\r\ndesert their owner and pursue Walter and Achilles.\r\n\r\nThey came up with lolling tongues at the kennels just as His Highness\r\nwas unlocking the door.\r\n\r\nWhile he fumbled with the latch he noticed they sniffed excitedly\r\nabout and that Achilles barked.\r\n\r\n"You\'re starved, poor old chaps!" remarked he aloud. "Well, no matter.\r\nYou shall have your dinner right off now."\r\n\r\nCoaxing them in he banged the wicket behind him and passed through\r\ninto the pen where the Pekingese, clamoring for their food, came\r\nyelping to meet him.\r\n\r\nInstinctively he scanned the fluffy-coated group. Lola was not there.\r\n\r\nThe discovery, however, caused him no concern for often Mrs.\r\nCrowninshield carried the prize-winner up to the big house or took her\r\nfor a ride in the car. Therefore, although her bright eyes were\r\nmissing he did not worry, but fed the other dogs and gave them fresh\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nThe task completed, he sauntered toward the garage.\r\n\r\nHow still it was everywhere. With the exception of Dick\'s racer every\r\ncar was gone and all the chauffeurs with them. Even Jerry was nowhere\r\nabout; and the gardeners were far down on the south slope where he\r\ncould just detect the clip of their shears as they trimmed the privet\r\nhedge.\r\n\r\nThe grounds were as deserted as if the earth had swallowed up every\r\ninhabitant. Surfside, deprived of its accustomed hum and bustle, was\r\nactually lonely. With uncertain step the boy loitered in the sun,\r\nglancing at the expanse of sea and at a knockabout that heeled\r\ndangerously in the rising wind. Thinking he might find Jerry and thus\r\nbanish solitude he meandered up the avenue toward the house.\r\n\r\nJerry, however, was nowhere to be seen but the silence was broken by\r\nthe siren horns of approaching motors and the Crowninshield cars came\r\nrolling in through the broad entrance.\r\n\r\nSince he chanced to be on the spot he may as well go up to the\r\nveranda, meet the family, and bring Lola back with him to be fed and\r\ntucked up for the night.\r\n\r\nAccordingly he hurried along and was at the steps almost as soon as\r\nthe automobiles came to a stop.\r\n\r\nTogether with a company of laughing guests, Nancy and Mr. and Mrs.\r\nCrowninshield alighted.\r\n\r\n"Such a beautiful ride as we\'ve had, Dick!" called Mrs. Crowninshield\r\nto her son. "We\'ve been over to Harwich and picked up the Davenports,\r\nyou see, and brought them home for the evening. I think, Mrs.\r\nDavenport, you remember my son, Richard. Nancy, take Janet and Marie\r\nin with you so they can leave their wraps. You young people will have\r\njust about time for a set of tennis before dinner."\r\n\r\nThe cars had shot away and she was about to go indoors when the\r\nmistress of the house espied Walter.\r\n\r\n"Did you wish to see me?" she called.\r\n\r\n"I thought I\'d take Lola down to the kennels."\r\n\r\n"Lola! Is she here?"\r\n\r\n"I thought you had her."\r\n\r\n"No, indeed."\r\n\r\n"But she must be here at the house."\r\n\r\n"No, she isn\'t. I never leave her with the maids. She is at the\r\nkennels."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve just come from there."\r\n\r\n"And she wasn\'t there?"\r\n\r\n"No, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n"Are you sure?"\r\n\r\n"Positive!"\r\n\r\n"But my dear boy, didn\'t you leave her there?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. But I thought you took her when you went to drive. You have a\r\nkey."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t."\r\n\r\n"And you did not give the key to any of the maids?"\r\n\r\n"Of course not."\r\n\r\n"Well, she isn\'t there," announced Walter, a tremor of trepidation\r\npassing over him.\r\n\r\n"Nonsense! She must be. Where else could she be?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you haven\'t half looked," smiled Mrs. Crowninshield reassuringly.\r\n"Lola is such a tiny dog she often gets hidden away out of sight. I\'ll\r\ncome and find her for you."\r\n\r\nExcusing herself to her guests she followed Walter across the grass\r\nand in silence they unfastened the wire gate that led into the\r\nenclosure where the Pekingese were kept. But search as they would they\r\nfailed to discover the missing dog. Lola was gone! _Gone!_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nTHE PURSUIT OF LOLA\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, Lola was gone; there could be no question about that.\r\n\r\nHad not Walter scented trouble he would soon have been made aware of\r\nit by the excitement that prevailed in the Peeks\' kennels. Every dog\r\nof the lot was barking furiously and with gleaming eyes and tail erect\r\nstriving to communicate tidings of importance. Yet bark as they might,\r\nthe message they sought to voice remained, alas, untold.\r\n\r\n"If they could only speak we should soon know what has happened,"\r\nbewailed the lad to Mrs. Crowninshield, as for the hundredth time they\r\nsearched every nook and corner for a clue to the mystery.\r\n\r\n"Yes, they know--poor little things," their mistress agreed. "They are\r\ntrying their best to tell the story, too. I\'d give worlds to know what\r\nit is."\r\n\r\n"And I."\r\n\r\n"You are certain you locked everything up when you took the other dogs\r\nout."\r\n\r\n"Positive. Dick was with me and we both tried the gate before we\r\nstarted."\r\n\r\n"Nothing seems to be disturbed."\r\n\r\n"No. That is the strange part of it."\r\n\r\nMrs. Crowninshield stopped, hot and breathless from her search.\r\n\r\n"I cannot believe but that the mite will turn up. Have you asked Jerry\r\nor Tim?"\r\n\r\n"They were nowhere about when I got back," Walter replied. "The whole\r\nplace was still as the grave. I was just going to hunt up Jerry when I\r\nsaw the cars coming up the avenue."\r\n\r\n"Well, I must not delay any longer now," announced Mrs. Crowninshield.\r\n"The Davenports will be wondering what has become of me and so will\r\neverybody else. Just find Jerry and Tim and quietly make sure they\r\nhave not taken the dog. In the meantime I will inquire of the maids at\r\nthe house. We will not, however, make too much talk about it, and send\r\nout an alarm until we are certain there is a real tragedy. If I can\r\nkeep Mr. Crowninshield in ignorance of the matter until our guests\r\nhave gone I shall be glad. He will be dreadfully upset for he took\r\ngreat pride in his possession of Lola and has declined numberless\r\noffers to sell her."\r\n\r\n"I know it," groaned Walter. "If it were only one of the other dogs\r\nthat was missing!"\r\n\r\n"The fact that it isn\'t is what alarms me," returned the woman. "Lola\r\nis a quiet little thing and has been petted so much that it would not\r\nbe like her to run away. Some of the other dogs might but she\r\nwouldn\'t. She is far too timid."\r\n\r\n"How could she run away, even if she had a mind to, with the gate\r\nlocked?"\r\n\r\n"I know. That is another ominous fact." Mrs. Crowninshield shook her\r\nhead. "I\'m afraid----"\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"That she has been stolen."\r\n\r\n"Stolen!" gasped Walter. "But how could she with--with everybody\r\naround?"\r\n\r\n"But you yourself just said that nobody was around."\r\n\r\n"Jove! That\'s true. Still somebody must have been here some time\r\nduring the afternoon. It is not likely Jerry, Tim, and all the rest\r\nwere out of hearing all the time I was gone."\r\n\r\n"That is what we must find out."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll go and hunt up Jerry now."\r\n\r\n"Do. But work quietly; do not make a fuss. It will be time enough to\r\nget everybody up in arms when we have to. I dread to think what Mr.\r\nCrowninshield will say. He will be furious, simply furious."\r\n\r\nWith this dubious prediction his wife walked away.\r\n\r\nShe herself was upset. It was easy enough to see that. She strove,\r\nhowever, to be calm, clinging desperately to the hope that the dog\r\nmight be discovered in the care of some of the men or maids. She\r\nidolized Lola and although she did not admit it, His Highness knew\r\nonly too well that if it really proved that her pet was gone she, too,\r\nwould be furious.\r\n\r\n"A nice mess!" commented the lad to himself as he hurried across the\r\nlawn in search of Jerry. "A nice hole I am in the very first thing!\r\nBetween them they will tear me to pieces. And Ma--Ma will say, \'_I\r\ntold you so!_\' That\'s all the sympathy I\'ll get from her. She\'ll have\r\nto know, of course, for Mr. Crowninshield will fire me bag and\r\nbaggage. I must expect that. Jerry as good as told me so when I came.\r\nI sha\'n\'t have a chance to defend myself. They will just believe I\r\nleft the gate of the kennels unlocked when I went out and that Lola\r\nmade off as fast as her four small feet could carry her. They will\r\neither think that, or they will think--" he stopped aghast at the\r\npossibility that had taken possession of his mind. "They couldn\'t\r\nthink I left it open on purpose for some one to get in and _take_\r\nLola! They couldn\'t think that! But suppose Mr. Crowninshield did\r\ndecide I was an accomplice what proof have I but my word that I\r\nwasn\'t. It does look bad--my being gone and taking Achilles and the\r\nother dogs with me. Still, I\'ve done it every day since I\'ve been\r\nhere. And anyway, they would know I could not entice Jerry and Tim\r\naway even if I had wanted to."\r\n\r\nThe boy took courage.\r\n\r\n"No, of course they couldn\'t think _I_ had anything to do with Lola\r\nbeing gone," he murmured.\r\n\r\nBy this time he had overtaken Tim and his fellow workers who were\r\nstill busy clipping the hedge.\r\n\r\n"Tim!" he called.\r\n\r\nThere was no answer but the crisp snip, snip of the shears.\r\n\r\n"Tim!"\r\n\r\n"Did you call?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. You haven\'t seen Lola, have you?"\r\n\r\n"Lola? Indeed I haven\'t. What would she be doing round here, I\'d like\r\nto know?"\r\n\r\nHis Highness struggled to smile.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I just thought you might have seen her."\r\n\r\n"She\'s not at the kennels?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Oh, then the mistress took her up to the house. She often does. She\r\nis clean daffy over that dog. Give yourself no concern, sonny; the pup\r\nis with the master and missis, being shown off to company, most\r\nlikely."\r\n\r\n"Probably she is. So you and the men have been here all the\r\nafternoon?"\r\n\r\n"That we have. A hot job, the cutting of this hedge."\r\n\r\n"It looks fine," declared Walter, turning away.\r\n\r\n"It ought to," Tim growled. "Goodness knows it\'s trouble enough! A\r\nprivet hedge is the devil to keep even."\r\n\r\nWalter, however, did not wait to hear the virtues and vices of privet\r\nhedges discussed. He was in too much of a hurry. Furthermore, he had\r\nsecured the information which he had come to seek. Tim and his host\r\nknew nothing of the whereabouts of Lola. Nothing else mattered. In\r\nfact, bewildered, anxious, and excited, it seemed at the moment as if\r\nnothing else would ever matter again. He must find that dog--he\r\n_must_!\r\n\r\nNevertheless he remembered he must not appear agitated and therefore,\r\ninstead of racing across the lawn and shouting for Jerry as would have\r\nbeen his inclination, he walked decorously along the path until he\r\ncame to the boathouse from which door Jerry was at that instant\r\nissuing.\r\n\r\n"You haven\'t seen Lola, have you, Jerry?" he asked as indifferently as\r\nhe could.\r\n\r\n"Lola? No. Why?"\r\n\r\n"It--it is just her dinner time," stammered the lad, "and I wanted to\r\nfind her."\r\n\r\n"She\'ll be up at the house, most likely, if she isn\'t at the kennels,"\r\nannounced Jerry. "There\'s visitors and Lola will be on deck to see\r\n\'em. She\'s a vain little lady and likes to be shown off."\r\n\r\nWalter greeted the remark with a sickly grin.\r\n\r\n"What have you been doing?" inquired he idly.\r\n\r\n"Me? Why, I was just starting to fix that hasp on the gate to the\r\nchicken coop when Minnie came running down from the house to say\r\nsomebody wanted to speak to me on the telephone. It was a\r\nlong-distance call and kept me there most half an hour; and what it\r\nwas all about I don\'t know now. Some feller I never heard of kept\r\ntalking and talking, and I couldn\'t make head nor tail out of anything\r\nhe said. Finally I told him so and hung up the receiver. I can\'t\r\nimagine who he was. Nobody ever telephones me."\r\n\r\n"So you didn\'t get the hasp fixed on the hen yard."\r\n\r\n"I would have hadn\'t the cook held me up just as I was leaving and\r\nwanted I should put a new washer on the kitchen faucet. I saw it\r\nneeded it the worst way. In fact, I had planned to do it before the\r\nfolks came and it had slipped my mind. So I tinkered with that and\r\ngot nothing else done. I\'m just after mending a hinge on the boathouse\r\ndoor. A profitless afternoon, I call it."\r\n\r\n"So you haven\'t been back to your diggings since noon."\r\n\r\n"Not a once. Why? Did you want me?"\r\n\r\n"N--o. Oh, no."\r\n\r\n"That\'s lucky. Apparently everybody else did," concluded Jerry grimly.\r\n\r\nSo went Walter\'s quest! Nobody had seen Lola. Nobody knew anything\r\nabout her. Question as he would, not the faintest trace of the missing\r\ndog could be obtained; and when the Davenports rolled down the drive\r\nthe lad faced the awful moment when his secret must be divulged and\r\nthe alarm sounded that Lola, the Crowninshields\' most valued\r\npossession, was missing. Rapidly he turned the prospect of the coming\r\nstorm over in his mind.\r\n\r\nSince the dog had been left in his charge the only manly thing to do,\r\nhe argued, was to go directly to Mr. Crowninshield and himself\r\nacquaint him with the direful tidings. It would be cowardly to shunt\r\nthis wretched task off on somebody else. It was his duty and his\r\nalone. Nevertheless, as he stood for a moment summoning his courage,\r\nhe would have given all he possessed to escape the interview that\r\nawaited him.\r\n\r\nHe would be scolded, blamed, discharged--that he knew--and he must\r\nbear bravely censure for something which he could not feel was his\r\nfault. Yet notwithstanding the fact that his conscience exonerated\r\nhim it made the coming scene no less dreadful to anticipate.\r\n\r\nIf Bob were only at hand to offer him his advice and sympathy. Bob was\r\nsuch a bully comforter. He never jumped on a man when he was down.\r\nBesides, he had a level head and always knew exactly what to do in an\r\nemergency. The instant this awful talk with Mr. Crowninshield was over\r\nand he was actually "fired" he should call Bob on the telephone and\r\ntell him the whole story. He must tell somebody, and Bob would\r\nunderstand better than anyone else just how everything had happened.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime there was nothing to be gained by further delay.\r\n\r\nPulling himself together, His Highness (a very meek bit of royalty\r\nnow) dragged himself up the flower-bordered path toward Surfside. As\r\nhe went it seemed as if every pansy flanking the walk stared out at\r\nhim and whispered, "Aha, young man! You\'re in for it now!"\r\n\r\nAlas, he did not need to be told that! He knew it only too well. He\r\ncleared his throat, wondering how he should begin his confession.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Crowninshield, I have some very sad news to impart to you--etc.";\r\nor "Mr. Crowninshield, I regret to say a very terrible thing has\r\nhappened." Such an introduction was easily delivered. It was the next\r\nsentence that appalled him. He could not get it off his tongue. "_Lola\r\nhas disappeared!_" He could see now the great man\'s face as it\r\nflushed with anger and surprise. What would _he_ say--that was the\r\nquestion?\r\n\r\nProbably his reply would be something like this.\r\n\r\n"Young fellow, when I hired you, you undertook to look out for my dogs\r\nand see that nothing happened to them. I agreed to pay you good wages\r\nto perform that service and you, on your part, promised to do it\r\nsatisfactorily. How have you kept that promise? You knew Lola\'s value\r\nand you should have looked out for her. It\'s up to you. You must\r\neither produce that dog or you must pay for her."\r\n\r\nHe had by this time reached the house and like a criminal who faces\r\nexecution and mounts the scaffold steps he climbed the broad flight\r\nleading to the front door. Mr. Crowninshield was on the veranda,\r\nsitting quietly in a big wicker chair, looking out toward the sea. He\r\nwas thinking so intently on some imagining of his own that he did not\r\nhear the lad\'s footfall and Walter was obliged to address him twice\r\nbefore he answered. Then he started suddenly, as if annoyed at being\r\ndisturbed.\r\n\r\n"Well?" interrogated he.\r\n\r\nThe fine introduction that His Highness had planned to utter, together\r\nwith everything else he had arranged to say, fled from his memory and\r\nhe stood speechless before his employer.\r\n\r\n"You wish to see me?" Mr. Crowninshield repeated in a less sharp tone.\r\n\r\n"I--yes, sir."\r\n\r\nNevertheless, despite the heavy pause the words the boy sought would\r\nnot come. Instead a plaintive jumble of phrases tumbled incoherently\r\nforth, astounding the lad himself almost as much as they did the\r\nperson to whom they were addressed:\r\n\r\n"Oh, sir, I\'ve lost your dog, Lola! I didn\'t mean to and I didn\'t\r\nreally lose her. She was gone when I got back from my walk with\r\nAchilles and the others. I left her locked in all right--I know I did.\r\nWhere she is or how she got out I\'ve no idea. I\'m terribly sorry. I\r\ncan\'t possibly pay for her, and you\'ll just have to put me in prison.\r\nIt\'s the only way, I guess. Don\'t blame my mother or Bob, please, or\r\nJerry either, because I\'ve turned out to be such a duffer. It isn\'t\r\ntheir fault. And perhaps I better go straight home. I suppose you\r\nwon\'t want me round here any more."\r\n\r\nA great gasp strangled any further utterance and only the lad\'s\r\nsobbing breath broke the stillness.\r\n\r\nNerved to receive a scourge of maledictions or a blow the culprit\r\nwaited. But nothing came--neither vindictives nor chastisement. He\r\nventured to raise his head and confront his judge.\r\n\r\nMr. Crowninshield was sitting looking far out to sea exactly as before\r\nand Walter actually began to wonder whether he had been turned to\r\nstone or had been stricken with deafness.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Crowninshield!" he at last ejaculated when the silence had become\r\nintolerable.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Did you hear what I said?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sonny."\r\n\r\n"Well--well--what are you going to do with me?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing, my boy."\r\n\r\n"_What?_"\r\n\r\n"This job about Lola is nothing to do with you, my son. It has\r\nevidently been planned for a long time and carefully executed by\r\nprofessionals. Had you been on the spot they would have contrived to\r\ncircumvent you just as they did Jerry. A gang have beaten us, that\'s\r\nall. But I will show them I am not to be beaten so easily. I\'ll have\r\nthat dog back if it takes every dollar I have in the world. And I\'ll\r\nland those chaps behind the bars, every one of them, or my name isn\'t\r\nCrowninshield."\r\n\r\nA tide of angry color surged over the face of the speaker and he rose\r\nabruptly, as if forgetting the lad\'s presence.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir!" he continued. "I\'ll round up those thieves. They needn\'t\r\nput me down for such an ass. Of course it\'s Daly and that New York\r\nbunch that set them on. They have always wanted Lola and been mad as\r\nhatters that I refused to sell her. Only the last time I saw Jake Daly\r\nhe said, \'What I can\'t get by fair means I sometimes get by foul,\r\nCrowninshield, so you\'d better look out for your precious dog.\' I did\r\nnot heed the threat at the time, attributing it to temper. But\r\nevidently he meant just what he said. He intended to have the dog,\r\nwhether or no. But by thunder," Mr. Crowninshield brought down his\r\nfist on the piazza rail, "he won\'t win out in the deal! I\'ll jail him\r\nand all his tribe--see if I don\'t!"\r\n\r\nWalter, watching, hardly knew whether to go or stay. The man\'s rage\r\nwas terrible and he thanked his lucky stars that it was not directed\r\ntoward himself.\r\n\r\n"Is--is--there anything I can do, Mr. Crowninshield?" he at last\r\nmanaged to stammer after the master had ceased his pacing of the\r\nveranda and at length became conscious of his presence.\r\n\r\n"Not a thing, little chap," returned his employer, flashing him one of\r\nhis rare smiles. "You have been mighty white about this, though. I\r\nguess it took some nerve to come up here and tell me this, didn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, it did."\r\n\r\n"I wondered what you\'d do."\r\n\r\n"Wondered?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. Mrs. Crowninshield told me about Lola the minute the Davenports\r\nwent. I saw the affair had nothing to do with you. Nevertheless, I\r\nwasn\'t sorry to try you out and see how much of the man was in you.\r\nYou\'re all right, boy. Cheer up! Nobody is going to pack you home to\r\nyour mother, so don\'t worry. And far from blaming you, if I want help\r\nabout finding Lola, I\'ll add you to my detective force. You may be\r\nuseful, who knows?"\r\n\r\nThe words, designed merely to be comforting, were idly, kindly spoken,\r\nand carried little real weight. Had the master of the house really\r\nsuspected how true they were to prove he would have been astonished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nA BLUNDER AND WHAT CAME OF IT\r\n\r\n\r\nAs if a weight had been removed from his soul Walter moved away. The\r\nwhole world had suddenly become a different place. Although the\r\ncalamity of Lola\'s disappearance was none the less distressing at\r\nleast on his own particular horizon there no longer loomed the spectre\r\nof discharge and all the disgrace that accompanied it. He could have\r\ntossed his cap into the air for very joy and gratitude. In his relief\r\nhe was bursting to talk to somebody, and as he had permission to use\r\nthe telephone in order to keep in touch with his family it occurred to\r\nhim that now was the moment to call up Bob and impart the exciting\r\ntidings of the afternoon. Bob was always off duty at this hour and if\r\nhe had the good luck to find him at the station just the sound of his\r\nvoice would be infinitely comforting.\r\n\r\nHastening in the side door he glanced into the wee telephone closet.\r\n\r\nNo one was there, and he took down the receiver and called the Seaver\r\nBay station. In another instant Bob\'s _Hello_ came cheerily over the\r\nwire.\r\n\r\n"It\'s Walter, Bob."\r\n\r\n"Anything the matter, kid?"\r\n\r\n"N--o. Yes. That is, something _was_ the matter but it is all over\r\nnow. I just wanted to talk to you."\r\n\r\n"Well, fire ahead. What do you want to say?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, a lot. I hardly know how to start." The boy laughed nervously.\r\n\r\n"You\'re not sick?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no."\r\n\r\n"Well, we can\'t hold this line forever, son, so break away and tell\r\nyour tale as fast as you can."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll try to, Bob."\r\n\r\nIncoherently the lad poured out his story. Once launched it came\r\nreadily from his tongue and he continued to the end of it without\r\ninterruption from his distant listener. When, however, he had\r\nfinished, Bob\'s crisp tones came singing over the wire:\r\n\r\n"You went out to walk about three, you say?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"And returned?"\r\n\r\n"It must have been half-past four or five, I guess."\r\n\r\n"And there was nobody about the place all that time?"\r\n\r\n"The men were all busy somewhere else. Strangely enough even Jerry,\r\nwho usually is on deck, had a telephone call and had to go up to the\r\nbig house."\r\n\r\n"Oh, he did!"\r\n\r\n"Yes. It was funny, too, because it was somebody he didn\'t know at all\r\nand he couldn\'t find out what the fellow wanted."\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?" The interrogation was sharp and tense.\r\n\r\n"Jerry just said it was some man up in Brockton whom he didn\'t know\r\nand as he couldn\'t make head nor tail out of the message he hung up\r\nthe receiver. Nobody ever telephones to Jerry. It was queer they\r\nshould do it to-day, wasn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Very. Did you tell Mr. Crowninshield about it?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, indeed. He was too busy about Lola to think of anything\r\nelse."\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless, I would tell him."\r\n\r\n"What for? It wouldn\'t interest him."\r\n\r\n"I think it might--a good deal. You tell him. Do you know whether he\r\nhas done anything yet or not?"\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t. I didn\'t dare ask him what he was going to do."\r\n\r\n"I suppose not. Well, I\'m glad you got out of this snarl so well, kid.\r\nIt\'s a pity they\'ve lost the dog. You take mighty good care of the\r\nrest of the pups and don\'t let any more of them disappear."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll try. And Bob----"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t stop to talk any longer now, old chap. So long! If they get a\r\nline on the thief you might ring me up again. I shall be interested.\r\nGood-by."\r\n\r\n"Good-by, Bob."\r\n\r\nHow fair Bob always was, reflected the boy, as he emerged into the\r\nopen and made his way back to the kennels. Some brothers would\r\nprobably have blurted out, "That\'s you all over!" or "Trust you to get\r\ninto a mess!" But Bob never enjoyed seeing somebody else miserable.\r\nInstead he always tried to make everybody\'s troubles smaller than they\r\nreally were. One could confess one\'s sins to Bob, knowing that he\r\nwould be merciful.\r\n\r\nSo thought Walter as he sped down the gravel path to greet the\r\nclamoring pack of animals that hungrily awaited his coming.\r\n\r\n"Well, old sports!" called he as he turned the key in the lock, "I\r\nguess you are ready for your supper. Wondering where your boss was,\r\neh? I\'m not very late. Only a quarter of an hour. It isn\'t late enough\r\nto warrant your making such a fuss. Down, Achilles! What\'s the matter\r\nwith you? Anybody\'d think you were crazy to see you jumping up and\r\nwhining this way. What\'s got you, old man? Down, I say!"\r\n\r\nHe pushed the dog from him and started to enter the room where the\r\nfood was kept; but again Achilles was in his path.\r\n\r\n"Get out of my way, you beggar!" smiled Walter, playfully attempting\r\nto shake the creature off. "What is it? Are you clean starved? If you\r\nare you must stand out of the way so I can get you something to eat."\r\n\r\nBut the dog refused to move.\r\n\r\nPlanting himself squarely in the lad\'s pathway he began to bark\r\nfuriously.\r\n\r\nThen he raced to the gate, sniffed, and struggled to get out.\r\n\r\n"What on earth has struck you, you giant?" inquired Walter, regarding\r\nthe great creature in bewilderment. "Don\'t you want your dinner?"\r\n\r\nIt was plain in an instant that no matter what the lure of a bone\r\nmight ordinarily be to-day, it held no charms for the big police dog.\r\nHe had one wish and only one, and that was to be released from the\r\nwire enclosure in which he was penned and left free to follow some\r\nplan of his own which evidently absorbed him. So insistent was his\r\ndemand that it was not to be denied and Walter slipped the bolt and\r\nallowed him to race away. Then the boy turned his attention to feeding\r\nthe other dogs.\r\n\r\n"Achilles probably has a bone buried somewhere," he muttered to\r\nhimself, "and is going to dig it up. Just why he prefers stale food to\r\nfresh I can\'t see; but apparently he does."\r\n\r\nNevertheless His Highness had scarcely finished giving the dogs their\r\ndinner before Achilles was back again, and with no bone, either. On\r\nthe contrary he was hot, breathless, and panting from what had\r\nobviously been a long run through the woods. Pine needles clinging to\r\nhis furry coat attested that he had been over in the grove that\r\nflanked the estate on the west.\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t find your hidden treasure, eh, old boy?" commented Walter.\r\n"Gone, was it? Some other dog taken it?"\r\n\r\nBut Achilles failed to accept the jest with the cordiality such jokes\r\ncommonly evoked. He neither wagged his tail nor stretched his jaws\r\ninto a grin. Instead he began to yelp and bound back and forth upon\r\nthe lawn.\r\n\r\n"You act possessed. What on earth is the matter?" asked the boy,\r\ncoming toward the gate and starting to open it.\r\n\r\nNo sooner was his hand on the latch, however, than the Belgian raced\r\nup with sharp barks of delight.\r\n\r\n"Want me to come out, do you? Got something to show me?"\r\n\r\nAgain Achilles barked joyfully.\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t you the tyrant, though?" remarked Walter. "I\'ve just been to\r\nwalk and am tired as the deuce. What do I wish to go tramping over the\r\ncountry again for?"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, despite his grudging protest, nothing else would satisfy\r\nthe dog and at length, curious to see what caused the creature\'s\r\nexcitement, he slipped the lock and stepped outside on to the turf.\r\nInstantly an exultant bark came from Achilles and he dashed away, only\r\nto return and take the lead through the woods, his nose to the ground\r\nand his ears erect. The boy followed. It was a race to keep up with\r\nthe rapidly running vanguard. Now the chase skirted the lawn, now\r\ndipped into the pine woods. On and on went the dog, and in pursuit of\r\nhim on and on went Walter.\r\n\r\nThey floundered along the slippery matting of copper, stumbling this\r\nway and that, and presently emerged where the land dropped down to the\r\nshore. The lad paused. He had no mind to scramble through the tall\r\nsalt grass or sink ankle deep in the stretch of sand that adjoined it.\r\nBut Achilles compelled. It was now no longer a matter of choice. The\r\nbeast approached and catching the corner of the lad\'s sweater in his\r\nmouth tugged at it resolutely, even angrily.\r\n\r\nWalter dared not resist. He let himself down over the edge of the bank\r\ninto the sharp-edged grass, and wading through it reached the sand.\r\nHere Achilles halted. The end of their pilgrimage had, then, been\r\nreached. What was it all about? For a moment dog and man faced one\r\nanother. Then, glancing about, His Highness gave a little cry. There\r\nwere footprints in the sand,--deep footprints that the moisture had\r\nkept indelible. A train of them came and went toward a ribbon of\r\nautomobile tracks that narrowed away up the beach and were finally\r\nlost in the confusion of a much traveled wood road.\r\n\r\nWalter\'s heart leaped within him as the significance of the discovery\r\nrose before his imagination. This was the way Lola had gone.\r\n\r\nA thief, familiar with the country and knowing the isolation of this\r\nsequestered cove, had driven through the wood road, left the car\r\nbehind the dunes, and skulking through the woods, had successfully\r\ncarried out a daring robbery. Perhaps he had been lingering concealed\r\nabout the gardens all day or even many days. Who could tell? At any\r\nrate, he had chosen a propitious moment, provided himself with a\r\nskeleton key, and carried Lola away in the waiting motor car. Where\r\nthey were now, who could tell? A car travels fast and a long distance\r\ncould be covered in the two hours that had elapsed. Certainly no more\r\ntime must be wasted.\r\n\r\nWith Achilles leaping before him Walter raced back to Surfside. Mr.\r\nCrowninshield, irritable and excited, was just coming out of the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n"May I speak to you a moment, sir?" panted the boy.\r\n\r\n"Yes, if it is important. I\'m in a rush so do not delay me."\r\n\r\n"But it\'s about Lola."\r\n\r\n"Lola! Go ahead, then, if you have anything to say."\r\n\r\nThe lad told his story.\r\n\r\n"Ha! Well done, Achilles!" exclaimed the financier when the tale was\r\ntold. "Well done, old fellow! And well done you too, little shaver!\r\nBetween you you have given us a big boost toward catching the thief.\r\nNow just one thing, sonny. I meant to caution you before you left but\r\nforgot it. You are not to speak of this affair to any one--not to any\r\none at all. Do you understand? A false move on our part might undo\r\neverything and ruin our cause. Nobody is going to be caught red-handed\r\nwith that dog in his possession. Rather than be trapped he would kill\r\nher. We mustn\'t let that happen. We shall follow up our man quietly\r\nwithout letting him suspect that he is being watched. That is the only\r\nway we can hope to get the pup back again. So mind you hold your\r\ntongue. Not a word to anybody on your life. Not a syllable. Be dumb as\r\nthe grave and let me see how capable you are of keeping your own\r\ncounsel. The trouble with most people is they blab everything. They\r\ncan\'t wait to tell it. Let anything happen and they are off to confide\r\nit to some one before you can say Jack Robinson. Now don\'t you do\r\nthat--at least not this time. Hold your tongue. This isn\'t your\r\nsecret; it\'s mine."\r\n\r\nIn terror Walter hung his head. Should he confess that he had already\r\ntelephoned Bob or should he keep silent.\r\n\r\nOf course Bob wouldn\'t tell. There wouldn\'t be anybody to tell way off\r\nthere at Seaver Bay. Besides, he himself could ring him up and caution\r\nhim not to. Why need Mr. Crowninshield know anything about it?\r\n\r\nBut suppose Bob had told already and harm was done? Certainly it would\r\nbe more honest to speak.\r\n\r\nThe boy took a big swallow.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid, sir, that I have already told some one," he blurted out\r\nmiserably. "I didn\'t know it would do any harm and so I called up my\r\nbrother and----"\r\n\r\n"You young idiot!" burst out Mr. Crowninshield indignantly. "Why in\r\nthunder couldn\'t you keep still? We\'re in a nice mess now! If the\r\nstory gets about and the police start to track down the thief it is\r\ngood-by to Lola. Why did you have to run hot-footed to the telephone\r\nthe first thing? Jove!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m very sorry, sir. I had no idea it would do any harm."\r\n\r\n"But you have an idea of it now, haven\'t you?" inquired the master\r\ngrimly.\r\n\r\n"Yes. I see what you mean."\r\n\r\nMr. Crowninshield heaved an exasperated sigh.\r\n\r\n"The game\'s up now, I guess," he muttered.\r\n\r\n"But my brother lives off by himself in a very lonely place," the lad\r\nexplained desperately. "Just he and another fellow have a house out on\r\na point of land a long way off from everywhere. They couldn\'t tell\r\nanybody about Lola if they wanted to, especially if I call them right\r\nup and ask them not to."\r\n\r\n"Where is it?"\r\n\r\n"Seaver Bay."\r\n\r\n"Never heard of it--or, stop a minute, isn\'t there a wireless station\r\nthere or something?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir. My brother----"\r\n\r\n"Well, no matter about your brother now. You go into the house and\r\ncall him up. When you get the line let me know and I will speak with\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir." Nevertheless the lad lingered. "I\'m--I\'m awfully sorry,"\r\nrepeated he.\r\n\r\n"There, there, go along. You meant no harm. You just blundered. But\r\nblunders are expensive things sometimes and this one may prove so\r\nunless we can prevent it."\r\n\r\nStill His Highness did not go.\r\n\r\n"Well, what are you waiting for?" asked his employer impatiently.\r\n\r\n"My brother told me to tell you that Jerry had a telephone message\r\nthis afternoon."\r\n\r\n"A telephone message? What has that got to do with it?" burst out Mr.\r\nCrowninshield at the end of his patience.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. Bob just said to tell you."\r\n\r\n"Go ahead then."\r\n\r\nHurriedly the boy related the facts of the mysterious communication.\r\n\r\n"So! Your brother has some brains if you haven\'t," said Mr.\r\nCrowninshield on hearing the story, and Walter saw him smile. "That\r\nwas neat of them, very! They took the precaution to get Jerry, who is\r\nunfailingly about, out of the way."\r\n\r\n"They?"\r\n\r\n"The thieves, youngster. It was a Brockton call, you say."\r\n\r\n"That was what Jerry told me."\r\n\r\n"Good! That gives us another clue."\r\n\r\nIt was evident the information had put the master in rare good humor.\r\n\r\n"Trot along, now, and call up this brother of yours. I shall be glad\r\nto talk with him, for he sounds as if he might be worth talking to. As\r\nfor you, son, cheer up! No milk is spilled yet and perhaps it won\'t be\r\nif you have as wise a big brother as it appears. I might never have\r\nknown of Jerry\'s message but for him. Jerry himself would not have\r\nplaced enough importance on it to tell me, I am sure--or you, either,\r\nfor that matter. So perhaps, after all, you did a good thing to enlist\r\nyour brother in our behalf."\r\n\r\n"I hope so, sir. I meant no harm; really I didn\'t."\r\n\r\n"There, there, don\'t think of it again," said Mr. Crowninshield\r\nkindly. "I should have remembered you are not a man\'s age and cannot\r\nbe expected to have the judgment that goes with fifty or sixty years\r\nof living. Even old codgers like myself blunder sometimes."\r\n\r\nHis eyes twinkled and in the radiance of his smile Walter saw the last\r\ncloud of wrath roll from his brow. Truly, as Jerry had affirmed, Mr.\r\nCrowninshield\'s rages were like thunderstorms--awesome while they\r\nlasted but unfailingly followed by sunshine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nMORE CLUES\r\n\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding Mr. Crowninshield\'s comforting words, however, Walter\r\ncould not shake off the consciousness that take it all in all he had\r\nblundered desperately throughout the entire train of events connected\r\nwith Lola and his vanity was sadly hurt. If any good had come out of\r\nwhat he had done it was more by chance than as a result of wise\r\ncalculation. He had meant well, that was all that could be said, and\r\nthe patronage these words implied was by no means flattering to one\r\nanxious to make himself valuable to his employer.\r\n\r\nWhat a boob he was; what a blunderer! The name Mr. Crowninshield had\r\nso wrathfully bestowed on him was unquestionably deserved. It fitted\r\nhim like a glove. The fact that the great man had afterward sought to\r\npalliate the sting of the term did not actually help matters any. What\r\nhe had thought in the beginning and so spontaneously declared was what\r\nhe really believed, and as his dispirited retainer observed to\r\nhimself, who could blame him?\r\n\r\nHe couldn\'t have made a worse start at a job had he tried. In his\r\ndepression he almost wished he had never seen Surfside, the\r\nCrowninshields, or anything belonging to them.\r\n\r\nNor was his melancholy lightened when he found on entering the house\r\nthat the telephone line was busy and that some one was calling Mr.\r\nCrowninshield. Goodness only knew how long it might be now before the\r\nwire would be free for the master to reach and warn Bob to keep secret\r\nthe tidings his brother had tattled to him. Wasn\'t it infernal luck to\r\nencounter this delay? If he had only held his tongue in the first\r\nplace! Well, it had taught him a lesson. The next time he got mixed up\r\nin somebody else\'s affairs he would keep them to himself.\r\n\r\nMeandering aimlessly outdoors he sat down on the steps to wait until\r\nthe owner of the house should finish his conversation.\r\n\r\nFor a time he remained quite quiet; but when the minutes lengthened\r\ninto a quarter of an hour he began to fidget. Would the talkers never\r\nstop? Why, their chattering seemed to be endless? Even through the\r\ndoor he could hear Mr. Crowninshield\'s curt tones and the eager rise\r\nand fall of his voice. Once he laughed as if pleased, and twice Walter\r\nheard a cry of "_Good!_" When he did appear on the piazza his face was\r\nwreathed in smiles.\r\n\r\n"That brother of yours is a Jim Dandy!" he exclaimed, rubbing his\r\nhands. "You did a mighty clever thing, young one, to get him on the\r\njob. We never can thank you enough."\r\n\r\n"Me?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly you! Why didn\'t you tell me more about this family paragon\r\nof yours? I didn\'t take in he was a radio operator."\r\n\r\n"I--I--I don\'t know," replied Walter, bewildered.\r\n\r\n"Well, his quick action has helped us no end--that is all I can say,"\r\nannounced the owner of Surfside triumphantly. "The instant he got your\r\nmessage he went to work with his wireless outfit. He flashed messages\r\nto all the stations in the outlying cities or else telephoned, and\r\ninside of half an hour every road to Boston and to New York was\r\nwatched. You see a man with a little dog had stopped at his station\r\nfor water. The wood road skirting our shore goes right by Seaver Bay\r\nand probably the thief reasoned that no one would be on the lookout\r\nfor him on such an out-of-the-way thoroughfare. At any rate he had to\r\nhave water for his engine and he took a chance. He told your brother\r\nhe was touring the Cape, and had you not called Bob up he would have\r\nthought no more of the happening. But when you told him about Lola\r\nimmediately he pricked up his ears. The dog tallied perfectly with\r\nwhat you had previously told him and the fact that it was a Pekingese\r\nmade him suspicious. Leaping at the possibility that his visitor was\r\nin reality the man wanted, he sent out a broadcast describing the\r\nculprit.\r\n\r\n"With an accurate description of the man, car, and dog we cannot fail\r\nto get tidings soon. And at any rate we have something definite to\r\nwork on. We know what the thief looks like, what he had on, the make\r\nof his car and all about him. Unquestionably he will be stopped either\r\nbetween here and Boston or between here and New York,--for he is\r\nprobably aiming for one of those cities. I myself rather think he will\r\ngo straight through to Boston. He would not venture to try New York\r\nuntil later because he would be well aware that the authorities there\r\nwould be waiting for him. He isn\'t going to be trapped. So he will try\r\nto do the thing he figures I will not calculate upon." Mr.\r\nCrowninshield rubbed his hands and laughed. "Little does he know we\r\nhave him down cold already! And it has all been so quietly and\r\npromptly done. That is the beauty of it. You must have got home from\r\nyour walk very soon after the wretch had left. Therefore the loss was\r\ndiscovered sooner than he had planned. Doubtless he was delayed by\r\nJerry\'s being about and had to wait until his accomplice up in\r\nBrockton called him off. I presume they had agreed upon some hour when\r\nthey would summon the unsuspecting caretaker to the telephone." As the\r\nscheme of the robbery began to unfold, Walter mirrored his employer\'s\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n"And if the other chap is in Brockton doesn\'t that indicate that this\r\nfellow who was here will most likely expect to pass through there and\r\npick him up?" he ventured, feeling very much of a personage to be thus\r\ntaken into Mr. Crowninshield\'s confidence.\r\n\r\n"Exactly!"\r\n\r\nHis Highness glowed with satisfaction. Some of his self-esteem was\r\nreturning.\r\n\r\n"Fortunately your brother had the good sense to warn his allies to act\r\ncarefully and not alarm the thief, so that the life of the dog might\r\nnot be jeopardized. He seems to have thought of everything, this\r\nbrother Bob of yours. If we get Lola back it will be largely his\r\ndoing--and yours. I sha\'n\'t forget the fact, either."\r\n\r\nWalter flushed under the great man\'s praise.\r\n\r\n"It was just a happen," murmured he. "I thought I had blundered."\r\n\r\nHe saw Mr. Crowninshield color at having his own word hurled back at\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"Some of the most fortunate strokes in our lives are achieved by\r\nchance," replied he, laughing. "See how capable I am of shifting my\r\nphilosophy," he added with good humor. "Nevertheless, although this\r\nindiscretion of yours has turned out well I still maintain that,\r\ngenerally speaking, a silent tongue is a great asset. In nine cases\r\nout of ten keeping still does far less harm than talking. Jerry is a\r\nshining example of my creed. In all the years he has been here he has\r\nnever let his tongue outrun his solid judgment. And yet," concluded he\r\nwith a twinkle, "had we trusted to Jerry, we should never have heard\r\nof his Brockton telephone communication. So there you are! Which is\r\nthe better way? It seems to be a toss up in this case."\r\n\r\n"I guess the better way is never to make a mistake," smiled Walter.\r\n\r\n"Do you know the infallible person who can boast such a record?" came\r\nwhimsically from Mr. Crowninshield.\r\n\r\n"N--o, sir."\r\n\r\n"Nor I."\r\n\r\nA pause fell between them and Walter rose to go.\r\n\r\n"Do you suppose you will hear anything more to-night?" questioned he\r\nshyly.\r\n\r\n"There is no telling. We may have news at any moment; or again we may\r\nhear nothing until into the night or till morning."\r\n\r\n"I\'m crazy to get tidings, aren\'t you?" In his earnestness the lad had\r\nforgotten that they were not of an age or quite of the same station.\r\n\r\nThe master smiled indulgently.\r\n\r\n"I\'m every bit as crazy to hear as you are," said he, quite as if Lola\r\nwere their joint possession.\r\n\r\n"Do you think you\'ll get any message before I go to bed?"\r\n\r\nOnce more Mr. Crowninshield regarded him with friendly comradeship.\r\n\r\n"That depends on what time you turn in."\r\n\r\n"At home Ma makes me go at nine o\'clock. I\'ve done it pretty much,\r\ntoo, since I\'ve been here. She wanted I should."\r\n\r\n"You are a sensible fellow. Nine o\'clock is late enough for anybody to\r\nsit up, although I will admit," the man chuckled mischievously, "that\r\nin New York we occasionally sit up later than that."\r\n\r\nBut Walter ignored the jest.\r\n\r\n"Do you think you will hear by nine?" persisted he.\r\n\r\n"There is no way of knowing, sonny," was the kind answer. "The best\r\nthing for you to do, however, is to go to bed as you usually do. You\r\nare tired out with excitement. I can see that."\r\n\r\n"No I\'m not," contradicted the boy, his eyes very wide open.\r\n\r\n"But you are--a deal more fagged than you realize. I am myself. Now\r\nI\'ll tell you what we\'ll do. I\'ll go to bed and you go to bed; and if\r\nany message comes I\'ll tell them to waken me and then I\'ll waken you.\r\nI can call you on the wire that goes from the house down to your\r\nquarters. How will that do?"\r\n\r\n"But suppose I shouldn\'t hear it?" objected the lad.\r\n\r\n"Somebody will. The chauffeurs do not go to sleep as early as you do,\r\nI rather fancy. I will give orders for one of them to tell you if a\r\ncall comes."\r\n\r\n"I\'d much prefer to sit up, sir. Why couldn\'t I just sit here on the\r\npiazza? It wouldn\'t disturb anybody and I should be on the spot."\r\n\r\n"You might sit here all night and catch your death of cold, and no\r\ntidings come until morning, sonny. No, my plan is much the better one.\r\nYou trot along to bed. I\'ll fulfill my part of the contract and go\r\nalso. And if there is anything to tell before morning you shall hear\r\nit."\r\n\r\nReluctantly the lad moved away.\r\n\r\nHe was not in the least sleepy. Nevertheless because he had given his\r\nword he dragged himself across the lawn, mounted the stairs to his\r\nroom, and began to undress. His spirits were very high. Within an hour\r\nor two--three hours at the very most--the telephone would ring and\r\nMr. Crowninshield would announce to him the glad tidings that the\r\nthief had been caught. Then some one would motor to Barnstable,\r\nBrockton, or wherever it was, recapture Lola, and bring her back, and\r\nthe events of the past few hours would be only a nightmare. And it\r\nwould be Bob--he and Bob--who brought about this glorious climax to a\r\nday of catastrophes. And if such a result was accomplished had not the\r\nowner of Surfside promised that he would never forget the service?\r\n\r\nFor his own part Walter wanted nothing. If Lola could only be found\r\nhis happiness would be complete. But if only Mr. Crowninshield would\r\ndo something wonderful for Bob! Perhaps he might give him a big sum of\r\nmoney; he could well afford to. Or maybe he would put him in the way\r\nof earning it. There was no telling what Aladdin-like feats he might\r\nperform. Such a man was all powerful. Why, he could send Bob to Europe\r\nif he chose! Or pay the mortgage on the house. He could make Bob\'s\r\nfortune.\r\n\r\nThe younger boy thrilled at the thought.\r\n\r\nWith these optimistic and intriguing fancies in mind he slipped into\r\nbed and soon dozed off into dreams wilder and even more extravagant.\r\nHe slept soundly and awoke with a bewildered cry when a knock came at\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n"It\'s I--Wheeler, shaver! The boss wants you on the telephone."\r\n\r\nUp scrambled Walter, his stupor banished by the agitation of the\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nHe did not wait to don his clothes but in his pajamas took the stairs\r\ntwo at a time and soon had his ear to the receiver.\r\n\r\n"Walter?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"Well, we have some news, such as it is." Mr. Crowninshield\'s voice\r\nsounded dubious and discouraged. "They tracked the car we were after\r\nto Buzzard\'s Bay and found it there empty; its occupants had\r\ndisappeared."\r\n\r\n"Disappeared!" repeated the astounded boy.\r\n\r\n"Yes, they\'re gone! Vanished in thin air! Not a trace of them is to be\r\nfound. The abandoned automobile with its number removed, was\r\ndiscovered on a side road."\r\n\r\n"The man must be hiding somewhere in the vicinity then."\r\n\r\n"That does not follow, son; I wish it did."\r\n\r\n"What else could he do?"\r\n\r\n"His accomplice from Brockton could meet him with another car, for one\r\nthing."\r\n\r\n"A different car, and throw us off the scent!"\r\n\r\n"Precisely."\r\n\r\nFor a second neither of them spoke. Walter was too nonplussed and his\r\nemployer too disheartened.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t that the limit!" the lad presently gathered indignation enough\r\nto ejaculate.\r\n\r\n"I expected something of the sort," was the reply. "We are up against\r\nprofessionals, you see, and not amateurs. This gang is being paid big\r\nmoney and does not intend either to fail in what it has undertaken or\r\nbe trapped. We had it too easy at the beginning and were too much\r\nelated by our initial success."\r\n\r\n"What are you going to do now?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve wired New York for detectives. I ought to have followed my first\r\nimpulse and done it immediately, and I should have had we not seemed\r\non the high road to success without help. The plain-clothes men will\r\nprobably be miffed at being called in now that we have meddled with\r\nthe case and messed it all up."\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t see how we have done any harm," retorted His Highness,\r\nfeeling it a little ungrateful of Mr. Crowninshield to veer so quickly\r\nfrom commendation to censure.\r\n\r\n"Oh, untrained people never can compete with skilled ones in any\r\nline," was the sharp answer. "I ought to have remembered it. Doubtless\r\nin our zeal we betrayed ourselves somehow and our man became\r\nsuspicious and adopted other tactics in consequence."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe so," Walter maintained stoutly. "I\'ll bet this is\r\njust what he had arranged to do anyway."\r\n\r\n"Well, perhaps it was. We cannot tell about that," yawned the man at\r\nthe other end of the wire. "The result, however, is the same. Instead\r\nof netting our catch we have allowed it to slip through our fingers."\r\n\r\nThere was an edge of exasperation in the tone.\r\n\r\n"Maybe we\'ll have better luck than you think," ventured the lad, not\r\nknowing what else to say, and unwilling to betray his chagrin.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll have neither good luck nor bad in future," responded the master\r\ncurtly. "After this we keep our hands off and the detectives manage\r\nthe affair. There have been blunders enough."\r\n\r\nWith this ungracious comment the great man hung up the receiver and\r\nstumbling through the darkness His Highness felt his way upstairs and\r\ndropped into bed.\r\n\r\nLike a house of cards his roseate dreams for the future had suddenly\r\ncollapsed. There would be now no wonderful career for Bob, no bag of\r\ngold, no fairy fortune! Instead of being a hero he had again become a\r\nmere duffer, a blunderer, had played the fool.\r\n\r\nSince failure had come in place of the coveted success Mr.\r\nCrowninshield would most likely blame it all to him.\r\n\r\nFleeting, indeed, was the favor and gratitude of princes!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nBOB\r\n\r\n\r\nBy late afternoon of the following day the New York detectives arrived\r\nand Wheeler drove their dusty and travel-stained car around to the\r\ngarage.\r\n\r\n"Must have speeded up some!" commented he, on viewing the throbbing\r\nmachine. "Left New York at midnight," they said. "Some friends of the\r\nmaster\'s likely, come to play golf."\r\n\r\nEver given to frankness it was on the tip of Walter\'s tongue to\r\ndeclare the real identity of the strangers, but fortunately he\r\nbethought him in time to halt the words.\r\n\r\n"What did they look like?" inquired he, eager to know and yet anxious\r\nnot to appear inquisitive.\r\n\r\n"Look like? Like any other dusty, muddy guys," grumbled Wheeler,\r\neyeing with disdain the grimy automobile which he knew he would be\r\nexpected to clean.\r\n\r\n"Old or young?" persisted His Highness.\r\n\r\n"Old enough to know better than to heat up an engine this way, but\r\nyoung enough to do it," snapped Wheeler. "Shouldn\'t think their car\r\nhad seen water in years, it\'s that filthy. A rum job for me!"\r\n\r\nWalter, however, did not reply. He was not in the least interested in\r\nthe mud-caked car. It was its occupants that aroused his curiosity. In\r\nall his life he had never seen a genuine detective and he was all\r\nimpatience for a peep at persons allied with such an intriguing\r\nprofession. While his reason told him they must, of course, look\r\nprecisely like other men, nevertheless the hope would persist that\r\nperhaps, after all, they didn\'t. And even if they did appear like\r\nordinary mortals were there not their myriad disguises? He hoped with\r\nall his heart they would wear some of these, that the exigencies of\r\nthe case would compel it.\r\n\r\nVery great, then, was his surprise and disappointment when on being\r\nsummoned to the big house soon after the arrival of these interesting\r\ncreatures he was presented to two commonplace beings who, although\r\ncharming gentlemen, were not in the least different from anybody else.\r\nMr. Dacie, the younger of the men, was a pleasant, blond-haired fellow\r\nwho instantly ingratiated himself in the boy\'s affections by asking\r\nhim if he collected stamps and bestowing on him two rare ones from\r\nChina. In fact he seemed to like everything a boy liked and appeared\r\nto be almost a boy himself.\r\n\r\nMr. Lyman was older but he, too, when he was not being stern and\r\nbusiness-like, was very jolly. No one could possibly be afraid of\r\neither one of them and then and there His Highness\'s faith in the\r\nultimate success of Mr. Crowninshield\'s cause dwindled and died. They\r\nweren\'t disguised at all; and if they had pistols they must have had\r\nthem well concealed for the only suspicious articles produced from\r\ntheir pockets were notebooks and pencils. He had expected to be quite\r\nawed by their presence but on the contrary he found, when he started\r\nout to show them the kennels and the place where he had seen the\r\nautomobile tracks, that he was chattering away to both of them quite\r\nas if he had known them all his life.\r\n\r\nMr. Dacie was particularly friendly, and as they walked along he\r\ntalked much of sports, dogs, and fishing. Furthermore he was intensely\r\ninterested in Bob and listened attentively to all that was told him\r\nabout this remarkable big brother. He had a bully brother himself, he\r\nsaid. In short, before a half hour had passed His Highness had not\r\nonly decided to become a detective but to become one exactly like Mr.\r\nDacie.\r\n\r\nAnd yet as he thought it over afterward the hero of his sudden\r\nadoration had not uttered one syllable about jails, criminals,\r\nrobberies, or crimes of any sort. In fact he had talked really very\r\nlittle. What he had done had been to smile, nod, and let the other\r\nfellow babble. It had, to be sure, been a delightful experience to\r\nfind yourself a lion, and everything you did of interest to your\r\nlistener; but you did not learn much about the business of being a\r\ndetective, reflected Walter, a bit mortified by his discovery. Well,\r\nthe next time he was with Mr. Dacie he would ask him some questions\r\nand let him relate everything about his mysterious calling.\r\n\r\nStrange to say, however, the moment for such disclosures never\r\nappeared to come right. There was always so much else to talk of. Mr.\r\nDacie wanted most terribly to catch some flounders and wondered if\r\nthere were any to be found; and of course as Walter knew of three\r\nsecret places where flounders were sure to lurk he eagerly told his\r\nnew friend about them. And then he had to talk swimming and\r\nschool--and how he hated it! Why, there were endless things to tell\r\nMr. Dacie. The visit of the two men was, moreover, surprisingly short.\r\nThey remained at Surfside only one night and the next morning,\r\ntogether with Mr. Crowninshield, who led the way in his car, they\r\ndisappeared leaving His Highness none the wiser and regretfully\r\nmourning his lost opportunity to be initiated into the gruesome\r\nmysteries of a detective\'s career.\r\n\r\nThe realization that in exchange for telling everything he knew or\r\never had thought Mr. Dacie had told him nothing suddenly caused the\r\nlad to speculate as to whether after all both Mr. Dacie and his\r\nassociate, Mr. Lyman, were not cleverer than they looked to be.\r\n\r\nIt seemed incredible to recall, now that they were gone, that he had\r\nnot once asked them what they thought about Lola and whether they had\r\nany idea where the man who had taken her had gone. How much better it\r\nwould have been had he made that inquiry instead of chattering about\r\nhis own affairs. But somehow when there had been a lull in the\r\nconversation they had always been busy measuring footprints or\r\nautomobile ruts, and writing down these unending dimensions.\r\nMoreover, something which he was unable to explain always halted the\r\nquestions.\r\n\r\nWell, it was useless to regret his vanished opportunities. The\r\ndetectives were now far beyond his reach and probably he would never\r\nsee them again. He might as well go about his work and put them,\r\ntogether with Lola and her baffling disappearance, out of his mind.\r\nThis he tried valiantly to do, but in spite of his utmost endeavor his\r\nthought constantly reverted to the missing dog, and when toward dusk\r\nMr. Crowninshield\'s car came whirling up the avenue His Highness had\r\nall he could do not to rush out and demand of the master whether he\r\nhad secured any further information.\r\n\r\nTo remember that he must keep constantly in the background was, in\r\nfact, one of the most difficult aspects of Walter\'s job. As a\r\ndemocratic young American who had always mingled in the best society\r\nLovell\'s Harbor had to offer he had been free to give a hail to\r\nanybody he desired to greet. But at Surfside everything was different.\r\nHe must stifle his natural impulses and curb his tongue, a role very\r\nhard for one who had had no previous experience with class\r\ndistinctions. Difficult as it had been he had made up his mind to\r\nbeing excluded from the gayety that went on about him. It was, to be\r\nsure, no fun to view automobile loads of young people roll out of the\r\ndrive bent on a day of pleasure; to look on while motor boats pulled\r\nup anchor and puffed across the blue of the bay. And how he would have\r\nadored to try his hand at a set of tennis on that fine dirt court!\r\nAh, there were moments when to a normal, healthy boy the world\r\nappeared a very unfair place; and the lot of one who worked for a\r\nliving a wretched one.\r\n\r\nAnd then, when his spirits had reached their lowest ebb, he would\r\nresolutely take himself to task. Was there not his pay envelope to\r\ncompensate him? He was not at Surfside to have a good time; he was\r\nthere to earn his daily bread and very fortunate was he to have so\r\ngood a place. Having read himself this lecture he was wont to turn to\r\nhis duties with lighter heart, closing his ears to the laughter and\r\nhis eyes to the merriment that made up the days of the idle. But what\r\nhe never could get used to was the fact that he must not ask questions\r\nor voice his opinions. In a free country where one man was as good as\r\nanother the mandate seemed absurd. But it wasn\'t done. That was all\r\nthere was about it. Jerry said so and so did Tim.\r\n\r\nInstead of piping, "Hi, Mr. Crowninshield, did you find out anything?"\r\none awaited the information until it was voluntarily imparted.\r\n\r\nIn this particular case, as good fortune would have it, His Highness\'s\r\nimpatience had seethed and bubbled only a half hour before who should\r\ncome strolling down to the kennels but the very gentleman the lad was\r\nfeverish to interrogate.\r\n\r\nArrayed in a cool Palm Beach suit and a soft hat of white felt he\r\nsauntered up as indifferently as if the boy\'s curiosity were not at\r\nthe boiling point and said, "Good evening," in a perfectly calm,\r\nself-possessed tone.\r\n\r\n"Good evening, sir," Walter replied.\r\n\r\n"Dogs all right?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"No more of them missing?"\r\n\r\n"Not on your--no, sir."\r\n\r\nThe great man turned away to conceal a smile.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been seeing your brother to-day," remarked he.\r\n\r\n"_Bob?_"\r\n\r\nMr. Crowninshield nodded.\r\n\r\n"Yes. We went over to the Seaver Bay wireless station."\r\n\r\nThe lad waited.\r\n\r\n"You have a very fine brother, youngster, and one whom you may well be\r\nproud of."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n(What was the use of telling him that? His Highness knew what a corker\r\nBob was without being told. Much better tell him what had happened at\r\nSeaver Bay, what the detectives said, and whether Lola had been\r\nfound!)\r\n\r\n"We had, in fact, quite a talk with your brother."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir." The reply came automatically.\r\n\r\n"He was able to furnish us with much information regarding the man we\r\nare chasing up."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"Yes," ruminated Mr. Crowninshield with evident satisfaction, "we have\r\nthe thief sketched in quite clearly."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"With the details your brother gave us Dacie and Lyman have a most\r\nencouraging foundation on which to work."\r\n\r\n"Have they found out anything yet, sir?"\r\n\r\nThe question would out despite all Walter could do to stop it. He knew\r\nthe instant it had left his tongue that he shouldn\'t have asked it and\r\nhe stood there hot and embarrassed at his own audacity.\r\n\r\nMuch to his surprise, however, Mr. Crowninshield did not appear to be\r\nin the least offended. On the contrary he seemed pleased by the lad\'s\r\neager interest and smiled at him kindly.\r\n\r\n"Yes, we\'ve found out something," said he, "but it is not very good\r\nnews, I am sorry to say. Dacie and Lyman traced the car that carried\r\nLola as far as Buzzard\'s Bay and discovered that there----"\r\n\r\n"Yes?" interrupted Walter, so intent on the story that he was\r\nunconscious of interrupting.\r\n\r\n"There," repeated Mr. Crowninshield, "the thieves embarked on a\r\nprivate yacht that awaited their coming; steamed through the Canal,\r\nand----"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say they are gone, sir!" cried the boy.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid so, sonny."\r\n\r\n"Well, if that isn\'t the limit!"\r\n\r\n"It is, indeed," rejoined the elder man heartily.\r\n\r\nHis Highness had staggered back against the door in consternation. If\r\nMr. Crowninshield had affirmed that the thieves had taken flight in an\r\naeroplane he could not have been more astonished than by the turn\r\naffairs had taken.\r\n\r\n"What do you suppose they\'ll do now?" demanded he.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve no idea. They may make for New York, Boston, or some other port\r\nwhere they think they will be safe. There is no way of knowing. Or it\r\nmay be that the person who hired them to get Lola is on the yacht and\r\nhaving now secured what he has been in search of he may simply cruise\r\nabout and not land at all for months. Anything is possible."\r\n\r\n"Could they get the name of the boat?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, she\'s called the _Siren_."\r\n\r\n"Then I should think it would be easy enough to track her down, board\r\nher, and bring Lola away," said Walter.\r\n\r\n"It sounds simple, doesn\'t it?" Mr. Crowninshield returned. "But I am\r\nafraid it is not going to be as easy as that. We have no way of\r\nproving that Lola is aboard the yacht, in the first place. Moreover,\r\neven did we know that she was there, there are a thousand and one\r\nplaces where she could be hidden and defy discovery. And were the\r\nvillains actually cornered nothing would be less difficult than to\r\nwring the puppie\'s neck and throw her overboard so that nothing would\r\nremain to identify the wretches with their crime."\r\n\r\n"Scott!"\r\n\r\n"You see now that to recover Lola is not such an easy matter."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid not, sir," was the dispirited response.\r\n\r\nMr. Crowninshield glanced at the dejected figure before him.\r\n\r\n"We mustn\'t give up beaten yet, however," affirmed he, struggling to\r\nbe cheerful. "The game isn\'t up, you know. Dacie and Lyman are clever\r\nmen and I have given them a free rein as to money. If there is\r\nanything to be done they ought to be able to accomplish it."\r\n\r\nNevertheless optimistic as the words were it was plain to see that Mr.\r\nCrowninshield was not really as sanguine as he would have Walter\r\nthink. There was a pucker of annoyance about the corners of his mouth,\r\nand his eyes looked dull and discouraged. Say what he might His\r\nHighness knew without being told that deep down in his heart of hearts\r\nLola\'s master had resigned himself to never seeing her again.\r\n\r\nFor a few seconds the capitalist lingered, musing. Then he broke the\r\nstillness, hurling a bomb into the air with the words:\r\n\r\n"By the by, I have made your brother an offer. I\'ve suggested that he\r\nleave Seaver Bay and come here. I am going to give Dick a radio set\r\nfor his birthday and I should like the aid of an expert in rigging it\r\nup. Besides, last season I installed a wireless on my yacht and shall\r\nneed some one to operate it. This Bob of yours is precisely the sort\r\nof chap I want."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Crowninshield!" was all Walter could stammer.\r\n\r\n"You\'d like having him here then?"\r\n\r\n"You bet your--yes, sir, I would," gasped His Highness, making a dash\r\nafter his manners.\r\n\r\n"That\'s good," remarked the financier, much amused. "I hope he\'ll\r\ndecide to come. You must use your influence to persuade him."\r\n\r\nThis time Walter did not forget his etiquette.\r\n\r\n"I will, sir," replied he meekly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE DECISION\r\n\r\n\r\nThat night when his day\'s duties had been discharged and he was free,\r\nthe first thing His Highness did was to pen a much blotted and\r\nsomewhat incoherent note to Seaver Bay. Almost every sentence of it\r\nwas underlined and some of the persuasive adjectives and verbs were\r\neven emphasized in red pencil. Certainly what the epistle lacked in\r\nneatness and beauty of appearance was compensated for in sincerity and\r\nearnestness. This document mailed and reinforced by an ardent appeal\r\nover the telephone, there was nothing to do but possess one\'s soul of\r\npatience until Bob decided what it was best for him to do.\r\n\r\nTo throw up a government job with practically assured employment for a\r\nprivate venture which might be of short duration seemed madness and\r\nthe young radio man with his level head and sober judgment was not one\r\nto leap at a decision. Carefully he weighed the pros and cons and\r\nwhile he did so Walter, and even Mr. Crowninshield himself, fidgeted.\r\nHis Highness would not have hesitated a moment; and that any one\r\nshould do so appeared to him incomprehensible. As for the master of\r\nSurfside who was accustomed to having his business offers snapped up\r\nthe instant they were made, the younger man\'s deliberation piqued his\r\ninterest and respect as almost nothing else could have done. He had\r\nthought the terms suggested very generous and had expected them to be\r\nseized with avidity. It was something new to have a penniless youth\r\nwaver as to whether to accept or reject them.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime while the days passed no tidings came from the New\r\nYork detectives and the dwellers at Surfside were compelled to settle\r\ndown to their customary routine and put Lola\'s disappearance out of\r\ntheir minds. Gardeners toiled, flowers blossomed, Jerry mugged about\r\nwith his misty blue eyes following every seed that was planted, every\r\nturn the lawn mower made; they followed, too, what Walter was doing\r\nand saw to it that the dogs were well cared for and that his young\r\nprot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9 neglected nothing.\r\n\r\nWalter saw little of Dick now, for the house was filled with guests\r\nand the place humming with laughter and the rush of unending sports\r\nand picnics. There were tennis tournaments, golf matches, swimming\r\nraces, regattas when small fleets of knockabouts maneuvered in the\r\nbay. In the midst of such a whirl of merriment it taxed all one\'s\r\nforbearance to be nothing more than the boy who cared for the dogs.\r\n\r\nOn one particularly fine, bracing June morning after the lad had\r\nreturned from a solitary cross-country tramp with Achilles and the\r\nrest of the pack, his lot seemed to him especially unenviable. There\r\nwas evidently to be a ball game. College boys with crimson H\'s on\r\ntheir shirts; men with a blue Y; together with a group of\r\nshort-sleeved players not yet honored with insignia from their\r\nuniversities were hurrying out to the lawn with bats, balls, and\r\ncatcher\'s mitts.\r\n\r\n"You must pitch for the Blues, Dabney," called one fellow to another.\r\n\r\n"Who\'s going to catch for the Crimson team?" piped another.\r\n\r\n"I choose to play for Yale," came shrilly from another man who was\r\nlounging across the grass in immaculate white flannels.\r\n\r\n"Come on and help Harvard along, Cheever," put in a strident voice.\r\n\r\n"Not on your sweet life!" bawled Cheever, with a vehemence that made\r\neverybody laugh. "Goodness knows she needs help; but I\'m not going to\r\nbe the one to offer it."\r\n\r\nAgain there was a good-humored shout from the bustling throng.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll line up with Yale to beat you though," Cheever added with a\r\nchuckle.\r\n\r\n"You can line up, you shrimp, but we\'re going to do the beating,"\r\nretorted an ardent Harvard supporter.\r\n\r\nSo the banter went on while the nines were being organized.\r\n\r\nAt length, however, there was a shout of dismay.\r\n\r\n"We\'re lacking one man," announced the captain of the Crimsons, with\r\nsudden consternation. "Haven\'t you another chap who can play, Dick?"\r\n\r\n"Nobody, I\'m afraid, unless you want to haul in some of the\r\nchauffeurs," Dick answered idly.\r\n\r\n"Jove! That\'s hard luck. We\'ve got to have a shortstop. What are we\r\ngoing to do?"\r\n\r\n"Wasn\'t there a boy around here somewhere this morning with the dogs?\r\nIt seems to me I saw somebody--a stocky little chap with a snub nose."\r\n\r\nThe description was not flattering and Walter winced.\r\n\r\n"Oh, that was King, who has charge of the kennels," replied Dick\r\nquickly. "I\'m afraid he hasn\'t come back with the bunch of poodles\r\nyet."\r\n\r\n"Yes, he has. I saw him skulking round the garage just now. Can\'t we\r\ndrum him up?"\r\n\r\n"Sure, if you can find him."\r\n\r\n"There he is!" cried Cheever. "I say, you master of the hounds, come\r\non over here. We want you."\r\n\r\nBlushing red His Highness approached the noisy group.\r\n\r\n"Did you ever play baseball, kid?" inquired the captain of the Harvard\r\nteam.\r\n\r\n"I believe so--once or twice," answered Walter soberly.\r\n\r\n"Want to come in with us as shortstop?"\r\n\r\n"Sure!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve a glove that will fit him," put in a man called Richardson.\r\n\r\nWith scant ceremony His Highness was hustled into it and before he\r\nsensed what he was doing he was yelling with the rest, and head over\r\nears in as exciting a game of ball as he had ever participated in.\r\n\r\nThere were excellent players on both teams and the scoring ran so even\r\nthat it was a toss-up who would win. From jest the game dropped into\r\ndeadly earnestness.\r\n\r\n"It\'s your turn at the bat, Stubby," asserted Richardson to Walter\r\nunceremoniously. "Now remember who you\'re playing for. Don\'t hand Yale\r\nthe game if you can help it."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll do my best," was the modest reply as the lad gripped the bat,\r\nthen rubbed his hands in the dirt to make his hold more certain.\r\n\r\nThe pitcher twirled a ball.\r\n\r\n"One strike!" droned the umpire.\r\n\r\nAgain the leather disc spun through the air.\r\n\r\n"Two strikes," called the warning voice.\r\n\r\n"Great Scott, Stubbie, look out. Don\'t waste strokes like that, you\r\nboob. Let the things go by if they don\'t suit you. You don\'t _have_ to\r\nhit them."\r\n\r\nOnce more the ball spun through the air. A smart crack followed and up\r\ninto the blue leaped the ball, defying the pursuit of catcher or\r\nbaseman.\r\n\r\n"Beat it into home plate, George!" coached the captain excitedly.\r\n"Move along, you fellows! It\'s a run for Stubbie! Slide in, Stubbie!\r\nPick up your heels and sprint! Go it! Go it! Keep out of the way, you\r\nchaps. Hurray! Bully for you, kid! A beauty! _Harvard! Harvard!\r\nHarvard!_ Rah, rah, rah! Rah, rah, rah! Rah, rah, rah, _Harvard_!" The\r\nfamiliar cheer echoed loud above the shouting.\r\n\r\n"That lays them out! They\'re dead men!" cried Richardson\r\ntriumphantly. "Where did you learn to play ball, young one?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s no fair borrowing a professional," the Yale leader objected,\r\ntrying to make a joke of his defeat.\r\n\r\n"Jove, but that was a pretty hit!" Dick said quietly to Walter. "A\r\npeach!"\r\n\r\n"You\'re all right son!" affirmed the Harvard catcher. "Any time you\r\nare out of a job I\'ll recommend you to the Braves."\r\n\r\nA general laugh went up.\r\n\r\nAltogether the morning was a glorious day of comradeship, nor did it\r\nlessen His Highness\'s happiness when he returned to his quarters to\r\nsee disembarking from Mr. Crowninshield\'s motor car the familiar form\r\nof Bob.\r\n\r\n"I brought your brother back from Seaver Bay with me," explained the\r\nfinancier. "It took him so long to make up his mind whether he\'d come\r\nhere or not that I went over there to-day to find out whether he was\r\ndead or alive."\r\n\r\nMr. Crowninshield was plainly enjoying Walter\'s amazement.\r\n\r\n"And you\'ve come to stay?" His Highness, all delight and confusion,\r\ncontrived to stammer.\r\n\r\n"So they tell me," Bob laughed.\r\n\r\nHe was a tall, handsome fellow with a grave mouth and thoughtful brown\r\neyes; and when he spoke it was in a voice low and pleasing to the ear.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Bob and I have lots of secrets we haven\'t let you into, little\r\nchap," affirmed the master of Surfside gaily.\r\n\r\n"I never was so surprised!" gasped Walter.\r\n\r\n"We meant you should be. Your brother settled everything up over the\r\ntelephone a day or two ago."\r\n\r\n"But, Bob, I don\'t see how you managed to get away from Seaver Bay so\r\nsoon. You said it would probably be weeks before they could act on\r\nyour resignation, even should you send it in, and afterward they would\r\nhave to find some one to take your place."\r\n\r\n"Luck came my way," Bob replied. "The government was closing the Bell\r\nReef station and they simply shifted the two men who were there over\r\nto our place."\r\n\r\n"Did you and O\'Connel both decide to leave?"\r\n\r\nBob\'s eyes twinkled.\r\n\r\n"O\'Connel has just answered an advertisement as operator aboard a\r\nprivate yacht," said he, exchanging a glance with Mr. Crowninshield.\r\nEvidently there was some jest between them that amused them vastly.\r\n\r\nCuriously Walter looked from one to the other.\r\n\r\n"Better tell him, Bob," murmured the New Yorker in a low tone.\r\n\r\n"Why you see, kid, O\'Connel had a chance to go as wireless man aboard\r\nthe _Siren_."\r\n\r\n"Not--not the yacht that has Lola on it!"\r\n\r\n"The very same--at least we hope it has Lola."\r\n\r\n"But--but--I don\'t understand," muttered His Highness as if dazed.\r\n\r\n"Evidently, so far as we can make it out, the _Siren_ passed through\r\nthe Canal and not daring to land, cruised along the coast where she\r\nmust have met with rough weather. Of course that is purely surmise on\r\nthe detective\'s part. Anyhow, her radio operator broke his arm and had\r\nto be replaced by another man so they advertised for some one. Luckily\r\nDacie saw the item in the want column of the New York paper and set\r\nO\'Connel on the job. The arrangements have all been by letter through\r\nthe general mail delivery of New York so we still have no notion as to\r\nwhere the _Siren_ is. On Tuesday, however, O\'Connel is to go over to\r\nNew York, an agent is to meet him, and he is to be told where to go."\r\n\r\n"And I suppose Mr. Dacie or Mr. Lyman will be on hand and go along too\r\nto nail their man!" cried the delighted Walter.\r\n\r\n"Not so fast, son," returned Mr. Crowninshield. "We are not going to\r\ntrack them down so close and scare them off at the outset. No, we\r\nsha\'n\'t send any one with O\'Connel. He\'ll go and meet the agent and\r\nfollow up directions precisely as if he knew nothing about Lola. With\r\nBob here operating a wireless and O\'Connel in constant communication\r\nwith him, we will have all the inside information we\'re after.\r\nO\'Connel can soon let us know where the yacht is; whether Lola is\r\naboard of her; and exactly when and where the owners of the _Siren_\r\nare proposing to land. They can\'t make a move which we shall not know\r\nabout in a flash. A pretty neat arrangement, I call it!" The New York\r\nmagnate rubbed his hands together softly.\r\n\r\n"Gee! Well, Mr. Lyman and Mr. Dacie have sure been busy!" was Walter\'s\r\ncomment.\r\n\r\n"You do not mention that I, too, have been busy," chuckled Mr.\r\nCrowninshield. "While you have been chasing the dogs over the fields\r\nand playing baseball," he winked at Bob, "I have been telephoning to\r\nthe city for a radio set--a corking fine one--for Dick\'s birthday.\r\nBob, here, is going to install it with the aid of some New York\r\nelectricians. It should be all in place inside a few days. Then if\r\nO\'Connel has any messages for us we shall be ready for him. In the\r\nmeantime Bob is going to break in you youngsters so that you or Dick\r\ncan listen in and get any news that may come when he is off duty or\r\naboard the yacht. If those fellows who bagged Lola think themselves so\r\nall-fired clever they will find they are mistaken. I did not go into\r\nthis game to be beaten." Mr. Crowninshield squared his jaw with\r\nbulldog resolution.\r\n\r\n"Now you and Bob trot off and have a visit together. Show him where\r\nhis quarters will be. There is a room beside you where Jerry says he\r\ncan bunk," continued the master of the estate. "Until the apparatus\r\narrives from New York there won\'t be much he can do, so you better\r\ntake the chance to go home and see your mother to-night--both of you.\r\nBy to-morrow or the next day at the latest the electricians should be\r\nhere with their stuff. Then things will hum!"\r\n\r\nWith a jaunty wave of his hand Mr. Crowninshield wheeled about and Bob\r\nand Walter were left alone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nLESSONS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe joy of Mrs. King when she was informed that both her sons were to\r\nbe all summer at Surfside cannot be pictured.\r\n\r\n"Why, it is like a dream or an answer to prayer!" ejaculated she.\r\n"Think of having you so near! Now were Bob to be electrocuted, I could\r\nget to him within half an hour."\r\n\r\nThe fact evidently caused her profound satisfaction and each of her\r\nsons laughed.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not planning to end my days by electrocution," smiled Bob.\r\n\r\n"Few do plan to," was the grim retort. "But anyway, whether or no, it\r\nis wonderful to have you so close at hand. I shall feel as if I had a\r\ngreat prop behind me."\r\n\r\n"I hope so, Mater," Bob said affectionately.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you\'ll not have much time to be spending at home, though,"\r\nmused the mother presently. "Your work, likely, will keep you busy."\r\n\r\n"I expect it will, especially during the next fortnight," Bob\r\nanswered. "There will be all the apparatus to set up and get into\r\nworking order; and in addition the equipment aboard the yacht must be\r\noverhauled. I want both wireless outfits in perfect condition for\r\nmuch depends on their being trim and tight."\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t probable you\'ll have much to handle that is important,"\r\ndeclared Mrs. King. "It won\'t be like dealing with government messages\r\nor wrecks." The two boys exchanged a glance. Much as they wished to\r\nthey dared not initiate their mother into the secrets of Surfside.\r\n\r\n"You never can tell what messages you\'ll catch by wireless," Bob\r\nreturned ambiguously. "Besides, Mr. Crowninshield intends to have some\r\nof his business relayed to him from New York."\r\n\r\n"Oh!"\r\n\r\n"I guess I shall find plenty to do," the elder boy remarked.\r\n\r\n"Well, I reckon you will at that rate. But do be careful, won\'t you?\r\nAnd don\'t let Walter go dabbling with those evil wires."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll look out for him."\r\n\r\nThe evasive answer did not, however, satisfy the woman.\r\n\r\n"Surely you don\'t mean to start Walter in learning about wireless, do\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"I may give him a few lessons, yes."\r\n\r\n"Now don\'t you do it," retorted Mrs. King in spirited protest. "He was\r\nalways a blunderer and were he to go messing about with electrical\r\ncurrents I should not have a happy moment. It is bad enough to have\r\none of you in constant danger without two."\r\n\r\n"But it isn\'t dangerous," Walter interrupted.\r\n\r\n"Much you know about it," declared his mother, wheeling on him with\r\nscorn. "What experience have you had with radio, pray?"\r\n\r\nMeekly the lad closed his lips.\r\n\r\n"I am going to give some lessons to Mr. Crowninshield\'s son, Mater,\r\nand it seemed to me it was a good chance for Walter to learn\r\nsomething, too," Bob responded gently. "Sometime the kid might find it\r\nuseful to have such knowledge. You never can tell. Nothing we learn is\r\never wasted."\r\n\r\n"No, I suppose not," was the grudging reply. "Well, just stand over\r\nhim and see that he doesn\'t kill himself."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve no desire to have him killed."\r\n\r\n"No more you have. Of course not," Mrs. King smiled. "But you know if\r\nthere is any way of crossing the wires he\'ll do it. He\'s made that\r\nway. Still, unlucky as he is, I\'d not care to lose him."\r\n\r\nFondly she beamed on the ill-starred Walter.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll keep at his elbow, Mother," said Bob soothingly.\r\n\r\n"I know you will. You were ever good to your brother." She patted the\r\nbig fellow\'s hand. "And mind the pair of you come to see me when you\r\ncan. You\'ll be busy, I know; but you mustn\'t forget your mother."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll not do that," cried the boys in chorus.\r\n\r\nNevertheless in spite of the promise there were few opportunities\r\nduring the next few days for either of them to go a-visiting. The New\r\nYork electricians arrived and with them came aerials, generators,\r\ndetectors, tuners, insulators, amplifiers, and all the hundred and one\r\nparts necessary for a perfectly equipped radio station. Mr.\r\nCrowninshield had indulged in no cheap outfit. On the contrary he had\r\npurchased the best there was to be had and as the coils of copper\r\nwire, glistening wire rope, and spotless porcelain insulators were\r\nunpacked Bob\'s eyes sparkled with anticipation. With the touch of a\r\nconnoisseur he handled the materials, examining the quality of each.\r\nWhat was Greek to the others was familiar ground to him.\r\n\r\nA low building adjoining the boathouse had been hurriedly constructed\r\nand it was here, where the new station was to be situated, that an\r\ninterested audience congregated daily. Perched on an overturned\r\npacking case Mr. Crowninshield surveyed the installment of the novel\r\ntoy which was not only to gratify Dick\'s birthday longings but also,\r\nhe hoped, bring to him the information he coveted concerning Lola.\r\n\r\nMuch as he knew about stocks and bonds he was as much of a novice in\r\nthe presence of things electrical as were either his son or Walter\r\nKing, and therefore to their avalanche of questions he added still\r\nothers, gratefully accepting the information Bob offered with the\r\neagerness of one who is not too superior to learn.\r\n\r\n"What is that thing they are putting in place now?" inquired he. "And\r\nwhat is it for?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, even I can answer that, Dad!" cried the delighted Dick. "That is\r\nthe aerial or antenna and it catches the wireless waves as they travel\r\nthrough the air. The higher and longer it is the better, so far as\r\nmessages are concerned--that is, within certain limits."\r\n\r\nHis father\'s eyes twinkled.\r\n\r\n"Where did you pick up so much knowledge?" chuckled he.\r\n\r\n"Bob told me."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be bound he did," sniffed the man. "I wasn\'t asking about the\r\nantenna, though. Green as I am I recognized that. It was that other\r\nwire that interested me."\r\n\r\n"The lead in?" asked Bob quickly.\r\n\r\n"I guess so, although I never was introduced to it by name before."\r\n\r\nEverybody laughed at the naive reply.\r\n\r\n"The lead in, sir, is the conductor that carries the wireless waves\r\nfrom the aerial into the house. The idea is not to have it too long.\r\nIt must run as directly as possible and be very carefully insulated\r\nfrom any buildings, trees, or masts because of the current."\r\n\r\n"I see. And that other thing?"\r\n\r\n"That is the lightning arrester. It can be fastened inside or outside\r\nthe station, as is most convenient; but it is compulsory to have it to\r\nsatisfy the insurance companies. The antenna is secured to it and by\r\nmeans of a ground wire any electrical discharges will in a great\r\nmeasure pass off through the earth."\r\n\r\n"Mater should see that," murmured Walter mischievously to Bob.\r\n\r\nThe elder brother nodded humorously.\r\n\r\n"The ground helps a lot in radio work," continued he. "In fact were\r\nit not for good old Mother Earth furnishing her aid, we should have no\r\nwireless at all. One side of our circuit passes through the ground and\r\nthe other half, which completes it, goes through the air between the\r\naerials of the different stations. Therefore you can readily see that\r\nit is most important to make sure of a good earth connection. Often\r\ncity water pipes are resorted to, the contact being made by soldering\r\na wire to the water faucet. Down here on the Cape, however, where\r\nthere are only wells and windmills we shall have to sink some metal\r\nplates in the ground and connect the wires with these."\r\n\r\n"And that is all that goes outside the building?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir. The lead in brings the wires into the station and they are\r\nthen connected up with the receiver. Sometimes there are separate\r\nantenn\xc3\xa6 for sending and receiving messages. Of course the big stations\r\nalways have two. But for a place this size and doing such a small\r\namount of business we can send and receive from the same wire. With a\r\ntuner, which can be tuned to bring you into the same key with the\r\nstation you are listening to; a detector to catch the signal after the\r\npersons talking have been brought into tune; and an amplifier that\r\nintensifies or increases the sound you have your receiving outfit.\r\nBatteries you know about without my telling you; and the head \'phones\r\ntoo, which you have of course seen telephone operators wear hundreds\r\nof times."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I believe I should recognize one of those," laughed Mr.\r\nCrowninshield. "So that is all there is to it, eh?"\r\n\r\n"That is about all there is to receiving, yes."\r\n\r\n"The sending part of the machine is more complicated, is it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir. And so is the job," smiled Bob.\r\n\r\n"I mean to learn to transmit as well as receive," put in Dick.\r\n\r\nHis Highness grinned derisively.\r\n\r\n"Do you indeed!" said he. "Well, there is nothing like aiming high.\r\nBut I guess for the present you\'ll be pretty well content if you get\r\nso you can take down the Morse code as it comes in."\r\n\r\n"Is it so hard?"\r\n\r\n"That depends on how good you are at memorizing dots and dashes.\r\nFrench verbs are nothing compared to it."\r\n\r\n"I hadn\'t thought of learning to read code."\r\n\r\n"You have to, son, if you are going into wireless. With a tutor here\r\non the spot, it should not be difficult. Besides, that is half the\r\nfun. I want you to learn this thing intelligently and not just make a\r\nplaything of it. I\'ve done my part by buying you the best outfit there\r\nwas to be had. The rest is up to you."\r\n\r\n"That\'s square, Dick," chimed in Walter.\r\n\r\n"Sure it is. I\'ll go to it and do my darndest, too, Dad," returned the\r\nboy.\r\n\r\n"That\'s the proper spirit!" exclaimed his father.\r\n\r\nHis Highness smiled with ironic satisfaction.\r\n\r\n"If Bob is to tutor you you will study harder than you ever did in\r\nyour precious life," whispered he. "I know Bob. He can be stiff as any\r\ncollege professor. He tutored me in Latin once to pull me through my\r\nexams and I barely lived. I don\'t envy you, old man."\r\n\r\n"Gee! Will it be that bad?"\r\n\r\n"You will get all the wireless coming to you, that\'s all. Take it from\r\nme," was the teasing rejoinder.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I hope he won\'t bone down as hard as that," wailed Dick\r\ndolefully. "I want to get some sport out of this thing. I wasn\'t\r\nplanning to be turned into a galley slave during hot weather."\r\n\r\nSeeing that he had his victim thoroughly terrified Walter thought it\r\ntime to shift the jest.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t fret. I was only jollying, old chap," declared he. "Bob won\'t\r\nreally stand over you with a whip. He is the best fellow alive. Still,\r\nhe will expect you to work if you set out to do so. He is always\r\nterribly in earnest about whatever he undertakes. I suppose that is\r\nwhy he has got on so well and never failed to make a success of what\r\nhe has tried to do. You can count on him to duff into this job with\r\nthe same spirit. You\'ll get your money\'s worth of instruction, you may\r\nbe sure, if he has been hired to give it."\r\n\r\nDick shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n"Well, I guess I can stand it if he is not too rough on me," responded\r\nhe. "I do not mind studying so much if it is about a subject I like;\r\nand I am crazy about wireless."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "You will get all the wireless coming to you, that\'s\r\nall. Take it from me." _Page_ 154.]\r\n\r\n"Oh, it isn\'t the wireless part I object to," drawled His Highness.\r\n"It is that dot and dash code that gets me. I never could learn it if\r\nI tried ten years; and as for taking twenty words a minute in any\r\nlanguage--well, they could have the whole outfit before I\'d do it."\r\n\r\n"I shall be interested to see what speed I can make," mused Dick.\r\n\r\n"Speed! You won\'t make any speed at all--at least not at first, so do\r\nnot hope or expect to. If you even get the words correctly you will be\r\ngoing some," sniffed Walter. "Still, I guess you need not worry for\r\nthe present about receiving or sending messages for Bob will give you\r\na lot to think about before that. As for the Morse code, you may not\r\nmeet it for weeks."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" Dick inquired.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Bob will get right down to brass tacks at the start and find out\r\nwhat you know about electricity and wireless anyway. That is the way\r\nhe did to me when he tutored me in Latin. He wasn\'t content with just\r\ntranslating Caesar but must needs splash right into Roman history and\r\nmake me hunt up everything I could find about the Goths and the rest\r\nof those heathen tribes. Gee, but he made me sweat! He will do that\r\nwith you and your wireless. If you think you are going to begin taking\r\nmessages in code you don\'t know Bob."\r\n\r\nHaving delivered himself of these brotherly appreciations His Highness\r\nwalked away, leaving Dick to ponder on the joyous prospects they\r\ncontained. His sinister prediction Richard Crowninshield soon found to\r\nbe true. Thorough was no name for Bob King. Before a week had passed\r\nDick whimsically remarked to his father that it must be a task to Bob\r\nto swim on the top of the sea without diving down with a spy glass and\r\nexamining every particle that was on the ocean\'s bottom. The fact that\r\nthe new tutor never dipped into any subject but instead explored it\r\ngreatly delighted Mr. Crowninshield.\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t mind letting that young chap tutor me a little," observed\r\nhe half jestingly to his wife. "I am as vague as a fog when it comes\r\nto this wireless business. I should get a lot of information if I\r\nlistened in on Dick\'s lessons."\r\n\r\nThe words, idly spoken, much to the amusement of all became a reality.\r\nAfter drifting in to the first talk Mr. Crowninshield came to the\r\nsecond lesson and from then on he became a regular pupil.\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t be afraid I have come here to criticize," explained he\r\nwith appealing simplicity. "I\'m green as grass and have come to\r\nlearn."\r\n\r\n"It is just that you have not had the time to take up radio, sir," was\r\nBob\'s modest answer. "We all have our specialties."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right," agreed the capitalist. "Sometimes I fall to wondering\r\nwhether it is better to know something about everything or everything\r\nabout something."\r\n\r\n"To know something about everything would be spreading it pretty thin,\r\nI am afraid," was Bob\'s characteristic reply.\r\n\r\n"That wouldn\'t do for you, eh?" remarked Mr. Crowninshield with a\r\nchuckle.\r\n\r\n"It would not satisfy me; no, sir. As it is I cannot begin to master\r\nwhat there is to be known concerning this one branch of science. Were\r\nmy head to be filled with a little of everything I should feel as if\r\nit were a grab bag."\r\n\r\n"Many heads are," was the laughing retort. "Still, with each\r\nsuccessive generation rolling up its accumulation of knowledge the\r\nintellectual snowball is getting to be of ponderous size. History\'s\r\nremedy for this malady has always been to knock the whole structure to\r\npieces every now and then and begin again. Perhaps we shall have to\r\nhave another period of the Dark Ages and another Renaissance to set us\r\nright."\r\n\r\nThoughtfully he puffed his cigar.\r\n\r\n"This wireless now--think of the new fields it has opened up. Not only\r\nare our ships equipped so that they can send and receive all sorts of\r\nmessages, get their location, be informed concerning harbor entrances\r\nand coast lines; set their compasses and clocks but soon wireless\r\ntelephones will be installed in the staterooms of all passenger\r\nsteamers so that those crossing the ocean can talk with their friends\r\nashore any time they may elect to do so. Of course there are times\r\nwhen such a thing might have its advantages; but for tired\r\npeople--doctors and the like--who are trying to get to a spot where\r\nthey cannot be reached by business cares it will be a negative sort of\r\nblessing. I, myself, for example, always count on my stay on shipboard\r\nas a sort of vacation, an interval when nobody can bother me with\r\noffice matters. But if in future I must have a wireless telephone at\r\nmy bedside I shall be no more isolated than I should have been had I\r\nremained at home. Pretty soon there will be no place under the sun\r\nwhere a man can go and get peace and quiet. The Maine woods will be\r\nfull of radio outfits and the tops of distant mountains in touch with\r\nthe stock market. Even an aeroplane carries its wireless. It is\r\nhideous to contemplate!" he sighed. "As for city life, we shall be\r\nbeset wherever we go. And if the fashion set by some of our city\r\npolice of having wires tucked away in uniforms and a wireless receiver\r\ncarried in the pocket prevails in due time even when we walk the\r\nstreets we shall all be in constant touch with our particular\r\nheadquarters."\r\n\r\nAt his rueful expression Bob could not but laugh.\r\n\r\n"There certainly is no question that a great day for wireless is\r\ncoming," replied he. "Whether we like it or not the thing has come to\r\nstay and as yet we have only half discovered what can be done with it.\r\nIt is undoubtedly rough on those who want isolation. But most people\r\ndon\'t. They are glad to feel, for instance, that the ocean is so small\r\nthey can talk with their friends while they are crossing it. Besides,\r\nyou must not forget how much good ship surgeons and doctors can now do\r\nfor those who otherwise would have no aid at hand. Remote lighthouses\r\nand small ships that need medical service often signal the big liners\r\nnow and ask advice of the ship\'s doctor. I heard a little while ago of\r\na lighthouse keeper whose leg was amputated under the wireless\r\ndirection of one of our great surgeons. Had instructions not been\r\navailable the man would probably have died of blood poison. And many\r\ntimes there is sickness aboard small vessels that are out to sea. They\r\nsignal the symptoms of their patients and the doctor hundreds of miles\r\naway replies with a remedy. As all boats carry medicine chests the\r\ndistant physician can easily designate what dose to give."\r\n\r\n"That is a fine idea!" nodded Mr. Crowninshield. "I hadn\'t thought of\r\ntreating illness by radio. A bit tough on the doctor, though. It must\r\nkeep him busy."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid it does. In fact some of the ship\'s surgeons are\r\ndemanding higher pay because of the rush of work put on them. To have\r\nthe health of a large ship under one\'s supervision is task enough\r\nwithout treating all the people sailing the ocean. They say some\r\ndoctors are all in after a trip simply because of the extra calls that\r\npour in from outside ships and stations. It keeps them hopping day and\r\nnight, for of course no decent doctor will ever refuse aid to those\r\nwho are suffering."\r\n\r\n"Humph! That is quite a new phase of wireless."\r\n\r\n"It proves it can save life not only at a time of shipwreck but in\r\nother crises as well," Bob responded with enthusiasm. "Now all that\r\nremains is for some clever fellow to come along who shall find a\r\nremedy for the difficulties that baffle the radio man. Then the\r\nscience will come into its own. We must get rid of static\r\ninterference--our greatest bugbear."\r\n\r\n"Come, come, son! You must not spring any of your technical terms on\r\nme. Remember that while I am old in years I am still young in radio\r\nknowledge. Before you go slipping those phrases jauntily off your\r\ntongue you have got to begin at the very beginning and tell us the\r\nlaws on which the radio telephone is based."\r\n\r\n"That is a rather big order, sir," Bob replied modestly. "However, I\r\nam willing to try to fill it. I can at least pass on to you all that I\r\nknow myself."\r\n\r\n"That will satisfy me," affirmed the capitalist. "I see no reason,\r\neither, why your young brother cannot arrange his work so that he can\r\njoin our class. The more the merrier. I even propose to drag in my\r\nwife and daughter. If in future we are to have wireless apparatus\r\nwherever we go it will be unintelligent not to know something about\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid it is going to pursue us pretty much to every corner of\r\nthe earth," smiled Bob gravely. "You see, one of its great advantages\r\nis that it can go where the telephone with its myriad wires and poles\r\ncannot. It would be out of the question, for example, to string\r\ntelephone wires through densely wooded sections and to the tops of\r\nhigh mountains, and even if the impossible could be accomplished the\r\nexpense of keeping such lines in proper repair would be so great that\r\nno one could afford to shoulder it. Poles rot and wires rust out with\r\nwear and exposure to weather. Then there is the damage from gales,\r\nice-storms, and falling timber. Even under the best of conditions\r\nlinemen would be kept busy all the time repairing the equipment. And\r\nas if these difficulties were not great enough in times of peace think\r\nof the added burden of protecting miles and miles of telephone wires\r\nin time of war. Contrast with this the small district to be protected\r\nwhen it comes to a wireless station. Instead of having soldiers\r\nscattered through miles of territory the few needed can be\r\nconcentrated within easy reach of provisions and reinforcements. And\r\nthe same advantages that the radio telephone has on land prevail as\r\nwell at sea for transmission of messages by cable is a frightfully\r\nexpensive thing. Not only is the laying of such a line difficult,\r\ndangerous, and costly, but to maintain it is expensive and hard as\r\nwell. In time of war it is particularly at a disadvantage since the\r\ncable can be cut and all communication with the outside world easily\r\nsevered. Wireless, on the other hand, is not dependent on any such\r\nextravagant equipment. It finds its own way through air, water, and\r\nearth with very little help from us; and if it has its defects we must\r\nnot forget that the first telephones were far from perfect, and that\r\nboth telephone and cable have also their disadvantages."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nINFORMATION FROM A NEW SOURCE\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the interval when the new radio station was being put in order\r\nand the parts of the outfit assembled Bob King and the two city\r\nelectricians toiled early and late. They scarcely stopped to eat, so\r\nfeverish was their haste. Mr. Crowninshield had let it be known that\r\nif the wireless apparatus was in condition to send and receive\r\nmessages within a week he would add to the regular wages of the\r\nmechanics a generous bonus and this incentive was sufficient to cause\r\nthe avaricious workmen to transgress the laws of the labor unions and\r\nforget any fatigue they may have experienced.\r\n\r\nAs for Bob he was far too eager to get into touch with O\'Connel and\r\nthe _Siren_ to covet extra pay for rushing through the installment of\r\nthe new service. A private signal had been agreed upon between him and\r\nhis former associate and also an hour set when each day the operator\r\naboard the yacht was to call him. O\'Connel was to allow seven days for\r\nthe work at Surfside to be finished and then his messages were to\r\nbegin and both Mr. Crowninshield and his alert employee meant to be\r\nready for him.\r\n\r\nHence Bob whipped on his helpers, using every ray of daylight that\r\ncould be turned to the purpose and much of the night. Even after\r\neverything was placed and connected up there would yet remain a great\r\ndeal of testing out and tinkering before the set would be in perfect\r\nworking condition and it was for this delay he was preparing.\r\n\r\nMuch to his surprise, however, the parts went together with\r\nastonishingly little trouble. They had been well made and fitted\r\nperfectly. Everything needed was at hand and in consequence there was\r\nno sending to the city for materials and waiting until they could be\r\nshipped. Therefore as the allotted time sped by the job that\r\naccompanied it moved rapidly to its end.\r\n\r\n"We are going to make it, sir," ejaculated Bob with shining eyes,\r\nbeaming enthusiastically on the master of the estate. "She will be all\r\nset up and working by Saturday. That is the day O\'Connel was to make\r\nhis first try to get into communication with us. I can hardly wait to\r\nhear what he has to say."\r\n\r\n"I am pretty anxious to know myself," returned the elder man. "If he\r\ncan get a message through we should then find out where the yacht is\r\nand whether Lola is aboard her."\r\n\r\n"I\'m crazy to learn what has become of the villains who pinched the\r\ndog," added Bob. "Do you take it they are still cruising with the\r\nboat?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, they must have been paid off and landed somewhere," was the\r\nanswer. "There would be no sense in detaining the thieves on the ship\r\nuntil now. It would only mean paying them and having them to feed;\r\nbesides one does not care to make two rascals members of a house\r\nparty."\r\n\r\n"You think they have escaped us then."\r\n\r\n"If by escaping you mean getting to the city yes," nodded Mr.\r\nCrowninshield. "But I do not feel at all sure with Dacie and Lyman on\r\ntheir track that they will be entirely safe and unmolested in town.\r\nThose detectives are like bloodhounds and will run them down no matter\r\nwhere they may be hiding. The mere fact that they have got to New York\r\nor Boston will not be much protection."\r\n\r\n"You intend to get them then as well as to recover Lola."\r\n\r\n"I certainly do," retorted Mr. Crowninshield with emphasis. "I am\r\ngoing to recover my property, jail the thieves, and bring the people\r\nwho received the stolen goods to justice."\r\n\r\n"They have a week\'s start of us," Bob observed doubtfully.\r\n\r\n"But we have not been idle all that time, man, Dacie and Lyman have\r\nbeen working; O\'Connel has been using his eyes and ears--I hope; and\r\nwe have this wireless set up."\r\n\r\n"Yes, we have certainly accomplished something," admitted Bob.\r\n\r\n"Accomplished something! I should say we had! Besides, this is not the\r\nsort of case one need hurry on. Nothing is going to be done suddenly,"\r\nexplained the financier. "Having got the dog the people on the yacht\r\nwill move at their leisure. They do not fear that any one is at their\r\nheels chasing them up. Furthermore the sea offers unending\r\nconcealment for their crime should they be pursued and trapped. It is\r\nthe thieves themselves who are the scapegoats and the ones in danger,\r\naccording to their reckoning."\r\n\r\n"I suppose so," agreed Bob. "Still, I cannot help wishing we might\r\nhave got after them without even these few days intervening."\r\n\r\n"You forget, my son, that our wireless is going to cover space so\r\nquickly that hereafter we shall have our information very quickly and\r\nshall be exactly as well off as most detectives used to be in double\r\nthe time."\r\n\r\n"Yes, that is so."\r\n\r\n"Once we are in touch with O\'Connel we can know every thought they\r\nthink aboard the _Siren_ as soon as they have thought it."\r\n\r\nThe uncertainties that clouded the younger man\'s face vanished.\r\n\r\n"That\'s right," smiled he. "From now on we should be able to checkmate\r\nthem pretty neatly."\r\n\r\nMr. Crowninshield put his finger to his lips significantly. The two\r\ncity electricians were approaching.\r\n\r\n"Well, sir," began the foreman, "I guess your wireless tests out\r\npretty near right; we\'ve signalled our home company and got a reply\r\nfrom New York clear as a bell. With this chap at hand," he motioned to\r\nBob, "you won\'t be needing us much longer, I reckon."\r\n\r\n"Have you got to rush back to another job?" questioned the financier.\r\n\r\n"Well, there is always plenty to do," grinned the man good-humoredly.\r\n\r\n"You couldn\'t remain over a few days and overhaul my yacht, could you?\r\nShe is anchored out in the bay close at hand. If you could be\r\ntightening things aboard her and seeing everything is right I would\r\nkeep this young man at this shore station."\r\n\r\n"Why--" the mechanic hesitated, fingering the roll of bills that\r\nstuffed his pocket. "Why," repeated he, "I imagine we could fix things\r\nup with the boss and stick round until whatever you wanted done was\r\ncompleted, sir."\r\n\r\n"Arrange it then. Get the yacht into condition quickly so we can put\r\nto sea any day now that we choose."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll do that, Mr. Crowninshield," responded the men in chorus.\r\n"Unless there is a lot to do to the outfit--"\r\n\r\n"There isn\'t. It was all new in the fall; and we have been in Florida\r\nthis winter too, so the ship has been in commission and constantly\r\ntaken care of."\r\n\r\n"In that case there will probably be little repairing," nodded the\r\nspokesman. "Maybe tightening and oiling, and a few small parts to be\r\nreplaced."\r\n\r\n"That is about it."\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t I--" Bob began but Mr. Crowninshield held up a cautioning\r\nfinger.\r\n\r\n"I\'d rather have you on shore," announced he quietly. Then turning to\r\nthe electricians he added, "I suppose the radio aboard the yacht does\r\nnot differ much from this set. There will be nothing but what you can\r\nhandle."\r\n\r\n"Nothing, sir; nothing at all," was the answer. "Besides, we are quite\r\nfamiliar with shipboard equipment. We do a lot of such work. Just\r\nbefore we came down here we went down to Long Island and put the\r\n_Siren_, a very fine steam yacht, into shape."\r\n\r\n"The _Siren_, eh?" repeated Mr. Crowninshield as indifferently as he\r\ncould.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir. Perhaps you know the boat, sir."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve never been aboard her," replied the capitalist slowly. "She\r\nbelongs to----"\r\n\r\n"To Mr. Daly, sir. As fine a yacht as was ever in the water."\r\n\r\nDaly! At the name both Bob and his employer started. It was the very\r\nman Mr. Crowninshield had suspected.\r\n\r\n"So Daly has a place down on Long Island, has he?" drawled he.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, sir. Mr. Daly\'s place is on an island off the Maine coast. He\r\nhad just put in at the Long Island port for some minor repairs. He\r\nsaid he was going to cruise a while this summer and wanted to be sure\r\neverything was shipshape before going to Maine. The mate told me they\r\nwere waiting to pick up some people at Buzzard\'s Bay."\r\n\r\n"Going to take the yacht through the Canal?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"An interesting trip," observed Mr. Crowninshield slowly. "That Canal\r\nis quite a time saver for New Yorkers." He yawned and started to move\r\naway. Bob held his breath, waiting.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you don\'t know where Daly was going for his cruise,"\r\ninquired he over his shoulder.\r\n\r\n"No, sir, I don\'t," was the response of the workman who seemed\r\nflattered at having aroused this degree of interest in his story. "I\r\nbelieve, though, that before they started they were to put into\r\nNewport for provisions."\r\n\r\nNewport! Then it was doubtless Newport where O\'Connel was to be taken\r\naboard! Bob dared not raise his eyes lest the excitement that danced\r\nin them be detected.\r\n\r\n"And after provisioning up there Daly was to cruise, eh?" called Mr.\r\nCrowninshield. "Well, the Atlantic is wide and he will have plenty of\r\nroom."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right, sir," chuckled the mechanic, delighted by the\r\ncondescension of the great man whom all New Yorkers knew by\r\nreputation. Think of hobnobbing in this pleasant fashion with one of\r\nthe big financiers of Wall Street!\r\n\r\n"How simple and kind a gentleman Mr. Crowninshield is!" commented he\r\npatronizingly after the capitalist was out of hearing. "And so\r\nartless!"\r\n\r\nBob struggled not to smile.\r\n\r\nKind Mr. Crowninshield might be but hardly simple. Certainly not\r\nartless. What a rare lot of amusing incidents the world contained!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nBOB AS PEDAGOGUE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wireless was now in commission and the next morning, after having\r\nwaited until the hour designated for O\'Connel\'s signal and received no\r\nmessage, Bob and his pupils assembled for their first lesson, not in a\r\nstuffy room but on the broad, well-shaded veranda of Surfside. A cool\r\nbreeze rippled the water, stirring it into tiny waves and as Dick\r\ndropped into one of the big wicker chairs he fidgeted to be out in the\r\nfreshly-painted knockabout that bobbed invitingly at the float.\r\n\r\nHis father intercepted his yearning glance and instantly interpreted\r\nit.\r\n\r\n"Come, now!" said he half playfully. "Quit making sheep\'s eyes at that\r\nboat, son. An hour\'s wireless lesson isn\'t going to cut your morning\r\nvery short or prevent you from having plenty of time to sail, swim, or\r\nmotor. Whether it does or not you\'ve got to endure it. Your summer\r\nholiday is long enough in all conscience. If I had until October with\r\nnothing more arduous to do than put up with an hour\'s instruction\r\nearly each day I should think myself almighty lucky."\r\n\r\n"I am lucky, Dad," conceded Dick quickly, "only----"\r\n\r\n"Lucky! I should say you were! You don\'t know what work means. Well,\r\nit was you who wanted this radio outfit. You were all for it and----"\r\n\r\n"I am for it still, Dad," interrupted Dick eagerly.\r\n\r\n"Then go to it and master it," retorted his father. "If you do not\r\nrelish the lessons swallow them down for the sake of the fun you are\r\ngoing to have later; for if you are intelligent enough to handle your\r\nwireless with some brain and understanding you are going to enjoy it a\r\nhundred per cent. more in the end."\r\n\r\n"I know I shall," Dick agreed. "It is only that I am crazy to get at\r\nthe thing itself."\r\n\r\nThe boy\'s father shook his head.\r\n\r\n"You are like all your generation," said he severely. "Eager to leap\r\nthe preliminaries and land at the top of the ladder with the first\r\nbound. It is an impatient age and the vice extends to the old as well\r\nas the young. Nobody wants to fit himself for anything nowadays. In my\r\nyouth men expected to serve apprenticeships and did not hope to\r\nachieve a position until they had learned how to fill it. But now\r\neverybody leaps at the big job and the big salary that goes with it\r\nand blunders along, taking out his ignorance and lack of experience on\r\nthe general public. As for you youngsters, you covet at fifteen\r\neverything that those who are fifty have. You want automobiles, boats,\r\nvictrolas and radio telephones before you know how to run them, much\r\nless pay for them. Look at Bob, here. He is worth two of you for he\r\ncan earn what he has. Often I tell myself I am a fool to indulge you\r\nand Nancy as I do. I ought by rights to make you do without what you\r\nwant until you can foot the bill for it." Mr. Crowninshield took a few\r\nhasty paces across the piazza. "Still," added he, his voice softening,\r\n"I fancy that scheme would be a sight harder on me than on you, for I\r\nlike nothing better than to get you what you want."\r\n\r\nFor a moment he paused, looking fondly at his son. Then as if afraid\r\nof himself he bristled and continued: "But to return to this\r\nwireless--remember that if you do not learn something about it and how\r\nto use it I shall take it away. I mean it, mind!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Dad," was the timid answer.\r\n\r\nWith this awful alternative looming like a specter in his path was it\r\nto be wondered at that Dick resolutely turned his gaze from the\r\nallurements of the harbor and settled himself in the big chair with\r\nall his attention focussed on Bob King\'s radio lesson. Moreover, human\r\nnature is selfish enough to like company in its misery and were not\r\nhis mother, Nancy and Walter consigned to the same fate as himself?\r\n\r\nTherefore the initial lesson began gayly.\r\n\r\nAt first Bob, seated in the chair of state facing his class, was shy\r\nand embarrassed; but soon he forgot himself in his subject and losing\r\nhis hesitancy he spoke with the authority of one who has mastered his\r\nart.\r\n\r\n"I am going to begin," said he, "just as they began with me at the\r\nradio station for I think if you get the principles of wireless at the\r\noutset you will find it much easier to understand it. And to do this\r\nwe shall not start with wires, generators, detectors, or anything of\r\nthat sort; instead we must go back of them all to the earth and the\r\nair, and learn how it is possible for sound to travel without the aid\r\nof human devices. For in reality there is something that takes the\r\nplace of man-made wires. This is the ether. Surrounding the earth\r\nmoves the air we breathe; and as we go higher this air becomes thinner\r\nand thinner until, by and by, a height is reached where the air gives\r\nplace to ether, a sort of radiant energy that bridges the zone between\r\nthe air space that encircles the earth and the sun, and brings to us\r\nits heat. This great sea of ether is made up of particles that are\r\nnever still and which are so small that they get between every\r\nsubstance they encounter, thereby becoming a universal medium for\r\ntransmitting light, heat, color and many other things to our earth.\r\nWithout this body of ether, there would be no agency to pass on to us\r\n(as well as to the many other planets of our solar system and those\r\noutside it) the energy the sun generates, which is the thing that\r\nkeeps us alive."\r\n\r\nBob waited a moment to make sure that his point was clear and then\r\nproceeded:\r\n\r\n"Now this energy as it moves through the ether takes the form of\r\nwaves; and these waves go out not in a single train but since the\r\nether is continually disturbed by the sun, in series of wave trains\r\nthat vary in frequency. Such waves are electromagnetic in character,\r\nand light, heat, sound, and the waves carrying wireless messages are\r\nall of a similar type, differing only in their relative rates of\r\nvibration. If unobstructed, and moving through free ether, all of them\r\ntravel at practically the same velocity, that is about one hundred\r\neighty-six thousand miles a second. When, however, they encounter\r\nother substances, as they are continually bound to do, this rate of\r\nvelocity changes. The waves of sound, for example, sent out by the\r\nwireless telephone are very slow compared with the high-rate\r\nvibrations that produce waves resulting in light."\r\n\r\nAgain the youthful teacher paused.\r\n\r\n"Now this constant turmoil in the ether which creates the magnetic\r\narea explains why the magnetized needle of a compass unfailingly\r\npoints north and south. This one simple fact is a certain proof of its\r\nexistence. And once granting a magnetic field to be there it is less\r\ndifficult to understand how wireless waves are produced in this\r\ncongenial medium and find their way through it, following in their\r\njourney the curve of the earth\'s surface."\r\n\r\nBob smiled at his audience encouragingly.\r\n\r\n"If you can once get this wave law through your heads the rest is not\r\nhard," asserted he, "for the whole wireless system is based on wave\r\nmotion."\r\n\r\n"With an ocean spread out before us we ought to be able to understand\r\nwaves," interpolated Nancy.\r\n\r\n"We ought," nodded Bob. "And yet better than using the ocean as an\r\nillustration imagine a small pond. Think, instead, of a nice quiet\r\nlittle round pond if you can. Now when you chuck a stick or a pebble\r\ninto that still water you know how the ripples will at once go out.\r\nThere will be rings of them, and the bigger they get the fainter they\r\nwill be. In other words, as the area widens the strength of the waves\r\ndecreases; and as this same principle applies to radio you can see\r\nthat it takes a lot of energy from a wireless station to reach a\r\nreceiver a great distance away."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve got that!" cried Dick with such spontaneity that every one\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n"Wave lengths, however, have nothing to do with actual distance," went\r\non Bob quickly. "Of course we think of the wave length as the distance\r\nbetween one ridge of water and another. There is, though, no law that\r\nwould make it possible to translate these spaces into our scale of\r\nmiles, for sometimes they are near together, sometimes far apart.\r\nDistance, therefore, depends on the speed with which the wave travels\r\nand the frequency with which the water is disturbed. If you keep\r\ntossing things in quick succession into the water you will get a\r\ncorrespondingly quick succession of waves. The law governing wireless\r\nwaves is exactly the same. Their length depends on the velocity of the\r\nwave and the frequency of the oscillations that cause it. Or to put it\r\nanother way, in order to reckon a wave length you must determine its\r\nvelocity (which is not impossible when you remember that sound travels\r\nabout one thousand one hundred and twenty feet every second) and the\r\nnumber of vibrations the particular note causing the wave is making\r\nper second. Now science has been able to compute just how many\r\ncomplete vibrations a certain note, key, or pitch as you may please to\r\ncall it, makes each second, or how many times the particles of air\r\nvibrate back and forth when that especial note is sent out.\r\n\r\n"Suppose, for example, a note makes 240 complete vibrations a second\r\nwhile traveling 1,120 feet; if we divide 1,120 by 240 we shall get\r\n4.66 as the wave length of this note. So it is the pitch to which a\r\nnote is keyed that helps determine its distance; and the force\r\nemployed to start the note sent out through the magnetic field. That\r\nis why a message projected into the ether from a high-power station\r\ncarries a greater distance than one sent from a station where the\r\npower is weaker. It is by power and pitch, then, not by length that we\r\ngauge wireless waves. Do you see that?"\r\n\r\nA chorus of assent greeted the question.\r\n\r\n"That\'s bully!" Bob announced boyishly; then blushed at the\r\nundignified ejaculation.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you be fussed, young man," smiled Mr. Crowninshield. "We\'re all\r\nof an age here."\r\n\r\n"I quite forgot," apologized the tutor.\r\n\r\n"That is exactly what I want you to do," returned the master of\r\nSurfside. "Ignore us old people. We are only listening in, anyway, and\r\nhave no earthly right to be here."\r\n\r\n"Still, I wish to treat you with----"\r\n\r\n"It\'s all right, Bob. We understand," put in Mrs. Crowninshield\r\nreassuringly.\r\n\r\n"Well, then, if you will excuse me I\'m off again," replied the boy.\r\n"And now that we\'ve got wave lengths settled to our satisfaction we\r\nmust remember some other things. One is that sound travels not only\r\nthrough the air but through the water. In fact, sounds are louder\r\nunder water than they are above it. Water is not only a better medium\r\nfor carrying sound but also, since it contains fewer obstructions,\r\nsound waves travel farther through it. Another thing which we must not\r\nforget is that our ears do not hear all the sounds that go on about\r\nus. The merciful Lord has arranged that when there are less than\r\ntwenty-four vibrations a second, or more than forty thousand they\r\nescape us. But a wireless instrument, on the contrary is spared\r\nnothing, having attached to it a detector that catches every sound and\r\nan amplifier that magnifies it and makes it discernible to our ears.\r\nWhen you listen in on a wireless telephone you will be uncontestably\r\nconscious of this. Also you must take into consideration that the\r\nwaves sent out by a radio transmitter are not choppy, irregular ones\r\nsuch as you get when a stone is tossed into the water; wireless waves\r\ngo out in regular, well-formed relays that neither overlap nor obscure\r\none another. Were this not so the signals made would be jumbled\r\ntogether and utterly unintelligible."\r\n\r\n"Sure they would!" Bob\'s young brother nodded.\r\n\r\n"Now to insure these several results we are compelled to resort to the\r\nhelp of scientific apparatus. Therefore at every receiving station we\r\nhave devices that will intercept the waves as they come in;\r\nretransform them into electrical oscillations; and catching the weak\r\noscillations make them strong enough to be read. Hence we use some\r\ntype of induction coil by means of which a battery current of such low\r\npressure and diffused flow as scarcely to be felt will be transformed\r\nor concentrated into a pressure that is very powerful. In order to\r\nform wireless waves we must have a frequency of at least one hundred\r\nthousand vibrations a second; and as it is out of the question to\r\nproduce these by mechanical means we employ a group of Leyden jars.\r\nSuch jars you have of course seen. They have in them two pieces of\r\ntinfoil separated by glass, which is a nonconductor of electric\r\ncurrents, and various other acids and minerals. When you connect a\r\nnumber of these small jars together you have a battery as powerful as\r\nthat of a large single jar."\r\n\r\n"I never saw jars like those," objected Dick.\r\n\r\nBob beamed at the intelligence of the demurrer.\r\n\r\n"When I say jar," explained he, "it does not necessarily mean that\r\nthese jars are of the round, cylindrical shape that comes to mind when\r\nyou mention the word; on the contrary Leyden jars are often flat\r\nbecause such a form makes them more compact. That is also why we use\r\nseveral little ones instead of one big one. But whatever their shape\r\nthe principle involved is always the same. When the terminals are\r\nconnected with a current the jar will not only receive but will retain\r\na charge equal in pressure to that of the device sending the current.\r\nAnd when you go even farther and bring the terminals near together,\r\nthe quick discharge that takes place creates an electric spark which\r\nis in reality a series of alternating flashes that come so fast as to\r\nbe blurred into what appears to be one. Could we separate these\r\nflashes we should find that each of them lasts less than a thousandth\r\npart of a second. The frequency of such oscillations is regulated by\r\nwhat is technically termed capacity, that is the size of the Leyden\r\njar. The smaller the capacity the greater the frequency of the\r\nflashes.\r\n\r\n"Now this spark, or oscillatory discharge emitted from the Leyden jar,\r\ndoes not result from a single traveling of the current all in one\r\ndirection; instead the electricity moves back and forth, or\r\nalternates, and the space where the discharge takes place (and which,\r\nby the way, can be lengthened or decreased as pleases the operator) is\r\nknown as the spark gap."\r\n\r\n"But I should think this explosion of the spark would make a noise,"\r\ncommented Walter.\r\n\r\n"Bully for you, little brother!" returned Bob, smiling at His\r\nHighness. "You are quite an electrician. If the current is strong, or,\r\nin other words, if the discharge is a high frequency one, it does.\r\nHence something has to be used to deaden the sound just as a muffler\r\nis used on a motor boat. It is important, however, that this muffler\r\nshould not prevent the operator from watching the condition of his\r\nspark for otherwise he could not keep track of his battery or know\r\nwhether it was on the job or not. So you will find little peepholes\r\nof mica or glass in the sides of the muffler."\r\n\r\n"Windows," murmured Nancy grasping the idea and translating it into\r\nthe vernacular.\r\n\r\n"Exactly," Bob agreed. Evidently his audience were understanding what\r\nhe was trying to make clear to them.\r\n\r\n"Now we have our high frequency oscillations occurring in the spark\r\ndischarged from the Leyden jar and jumping the spark gap; nevertheless\r\nthey would not do us any good were there not some way to use and\r\nregulate them. This brings us to the induction coil of which I spoke a\r\nsecond ago."\r\n\r\n"It sounds very terrible," smiled Mrs. Crowninshield.\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t, though," answered Bob, returning the smile. "In fact it is\r\na very simple device--nothing more than a dozen or so twists of copper\r\nwire reeled about a wooden frame exactly as strands of thread might be\r\nwound round a spool. One end of the inductance is connected\r\npermanently with the ground and from the other end two movable wires\r\ngo out, one of which can be connected with the spark gap and the other\r\nwith the antenna that goes into the air and catches the sound waves.\r\nThere isn\'t anything very terrible about that, you see."\r\n\r\n"Antenna is what butterflies have," suggested Nancy vaguely.\r\n\r\n"Quite right!" assented the wireless man. "Only radio antenn\xc3\xa6 are not\r\nto feel with--at least not in the same way. Nevertheless they do reach\r\nout and capture the sound. On all wireless stations you will notice\r\nthe masts that support them. Sometimes there is one wire, sometimes a\r\ngroup. It is the wires themselves, remember, not the masts, which are\r\nthe antenn\xc3\xa6. Nowadays, however, you will occasionally see an indoor\r\naerial used in connection with small, low-power outfits. It does away\r\nwith the masts and outside equipment and frequently serves the same\r\npurpose quite satisfactorily. But most persons prefer the older method\r\nand for long-distance work it has, up to date proved to be\r\nindispensable. Now the antenna has both electrical capacity and\r\ninductance, and when connected up with the apparatus a wireless\r\noperator can at will cause it to disturb the magnetic fields\r\nsurrounding the earth."\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t say how high these masts had to be, Bob," put in Mr.\r\nCrowninshield. "Are they always the same length?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, indeed, sir," was the prompt response. "Their length varies\r\naccording to the type of service required of them. I\'m glad you asked\r\nthe question. Sometimes the masts are about two hundred feet high;\r\nagain they may approximate four hundred and eighteen feet. And\r\nsometimes in emergencies you will discover no masts at all, the wires\r\nbeing fastened instead to captive balloons or kites which hold them in\r\nplace long enough to send or receive hasty messages. This latter\r\nmethod is usually resorted to in wartime or during army or navy\r\nmaneuvers. There are also compact radio sets to be had that can be\r\ncarried on mule-back and set up and taken down on a hurried army\r\nmarch. On shipboard the ordinary masts of the vessel serve, of\r\ncourse, to support the antenna."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, Bob. That is exactly what I wanted to know," said Mr.\r\nCrowninshield.\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad, sir. Now you\'d think by this time we had everything\r\nnecessary to produce our wireless waves and yet we haven\'t. There is\r\nstill one thing almost more important than all the rest that we have\r\nnot yet spoken of."\r\n\r\n"What\'s that, Bob?" piped Walter.\r\n\r\n"The tuner. You recall that at the beginning I mentioned the pitch,\r\nnote, or key of the sound produced or received?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," returned the class in chorus.\r\n\r\n"Well, it is in that tune or pitch, or whatever you prefer to call it,\r\nthat a large measure of the secret of wireless lies. To be successful\r\nin getting and sending messages we must tune the oscillations, or key\r\nthe signals caused by the discharge of the battery in our Leyden jar,\r\nso that they will be in harmony (or at precisely the same pitch) with\r\nthe antenna circuit. That is, the parts of the instrument must\r\nsynchronize, just as two persons who would talk together must speak in\r\nthe same language. This adjustment is made in the inductance coil\r\nbecause although both the Leyden jar where the spark is generated that\r\ncauses the oscillations and the antenna can be regulated independently\r\nof each other a few turns of the inductance coil affects each circuit.\r\nAfter the two circuits have been adjusted to the same frequency they\r\nare said to synchronize. Often to reach this result a device is used\r\nthat states precisely the wave length, and after the frequency of one\r\ncircuit has been ascertained the other can easily be adjusted to\r\ncorrespond with it. The length of the wave is, you see, dependent on\r\nthe largeness of the antenna and the capacity, or strength of current,\r\nof the Leyden jar. Just as a child uses a big stone to produce the\r\nlargest splash and greatest waves so we must have a powerful force\r\nbehind our wave lengths to make them carry most successfully. In\r\naccordance with this law, generally speaking, we find short wave\r\nlengths used for low power, short-distance outfits; and long wave\r\nlengths for high-power circuits whose aim is to traverse continents\r\nand oceans."\r\n\r\nBob pushed back his chair.\r\n\r\n"I think," said he, "we have now come to a good stopping place and we\r\nwill call the lesson off for to-day. If you digest all I have told\r\nyou, you will have had an ample radio starter."\r\n\r\n"You haven\'t said much about sending messages," complained Dick.\r\n\r\n"That is quite another story," smiled the boy\'s tutor, "and such a\r\nlong one that were I to tell it to you now it would mean you would get\r\nno sailing or swimming to-day."\r\n\r\nInstantly Dick was on his feet, Leyden jars and inductance coils\r\nforgotten.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll cut it out then," he laughed. "Who is for a swim? I\'ll race any\r\nman to the bath-house!" And off he went at top speed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTIDINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo days later O\'Connel\'s first signal came.\r\n\r\nBob was at his early morning task of oiling and tightening up his\r\napparatus and cleaning it, and both Dick and Walter were hovering\r\nnear, watching him and learning all they could concerning the proper\r\ncare of the equipment. Having made everything shipshape the young\r\nradio operator slipped the double head receiver over his forehead and\r\nprepared to listen in for his customary interval. Suddenly the boys\r\nsaw him start excitedly and motion them to stop talking. With face\r\nalight he was leaning forward eagerly. Then came the sharp click of\r\nthe Morse code and after an interval with radiant face the elder lad\r\nwriggled out of his trappings.\r\n\r\n"What is it? What is it?" cried his two companions, hardly able to\r\ncontain their curiosity.\r\n\r\n"It was O\'Connel."\r\n\r\n"What did he say? Is the dog there? Where was the yacht?"\r\n\r\nBreathlessly the questions tumbled one over the other.\r\n\r\n"The _Siren_ is anchored off Gloucester and bound north, probably to\r\nBar Harbor. A dog they call Trixie, but which O\'Connel thinks is\r\nLola, is aboard the boat. The description we gave him seems to fit\r\nher. He says she isn\'t very well--won\'t eat and seems either homesick\r\nor seasick. Mr. Daly is quite worried about her."\r\n\r\n"For goodness\' sake don\'t tell Dad or Mother that. They\'ll have a\r\nfit," Dick cried. "Should Lola die I believe my father would shoot\r\nDaly down."\r\n\r\n"But I\'ve got to give him the message."\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t repeat all of it, need you?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I think you ought to tell them," Walter put in. "They would\r\nrather know, I\'m sure."\r\n\r\n"Dad will storm fit to raise the dead."\r\n\r\n"We can\'t help it," answered His Highness.\r\n\r\n"I am of the kid\'s opinion," Bob replied slowly. "I think we should\r\ntell your father and mother the whole truth just as O\'Connel has sent\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Prepare for a nice, pleasant tornado, then," said Dick, "for you will\r\nget it all right."\r\n\r\n"I wish I could have talked with O\'Connel," declared Bob thoughtfully.\r\n"I did all I dared. You see, until our license comes I am not expected\r\nto transmit messages from this station. We have to get from the\r\ngovernment both an operator\'s license and a permit for the station;\r\nand although I put in the application promptly there is so much red\r\ntape about it that it seems as if the inspector would never show up.\r\nIf I had been caught sending a message this morning without these\r\nblooming papers there would have been the deuce of a row. However, I\r\ntook a chance because I felt the emergency demanded it, and because\r\nbeing one of Uncle Sam\'s own men he couldn\'t very well put up the kick\r\nthat I was not competent to handle a wireless outfit. Still, I shan\'t\r\ndare do it again."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t there anything we can do to hustle up the inspector?" inquired\r\nDick.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid not, son. Government inspectors are not a hurrying race,"\r\nwas Bob\'s whimsical reply. "However, I telephoned our local man\r\nyesterday and something may happen to-day. He and I used to be on\r\nquite good terms when he occasionally dropped in at Seaver Bay. I told\r\nhim that if I could not get a station license pretty soon our whole\r\noutfit would be no good to us this season. He promised he would take\r\nup the matter at once. With that I had to be satisfied. Whether he\r\ndoes anything or not remains to be seen."\r\n\r\n"I suppose O\'Connel understands this difficulty, doesn\'t he?" mused\r\nDick.\r\n\r\n"Oh, he knows, all right, why I can\'t answer him. I\'ve assured him\r\nthat his tidings have come through and that is all he wants to know,"\r\nBob answered. "He has dealt with the government himself and is\r\nfamiliar with its deliberate habits. Besides, there really isn\'t much\r\nwe can say."\r\n\r\n"Maybe you think that," grinned Dick, "but wait until you tell Dad\r\nthat Lola is sick and hear him sputter. You will believe then that\r\nthere is quite a bit that can be said. And if you get my mother to add\r\nher comments you will have plenty to relay over the wire."\r\n\r\nThe prophecy was indeed true, as Bob King proved after he had raced\r\nacross the grass and overtaken Mr. and Mrs. Crowninshield on a tour of\r\ninspection to the rose gardens.\r\n\r\n"News, Bob?" questioned the capitalist, wheeling about to meet the\r\nflying figure. "What is it? Let us have it quickly."\r\n\r\nCarefully the message was repeated.\r\n\r\n"Off Gloucester, eh, and bound north? Humph! And they\'ve re-christened\r\nthe poor little pupsie Trixie! Hang them! O\'Connel thinks she isn\'t\r\nwell? Of course she isn\'t seasick. Lola has been out on our yacht a\r\nhundred times. The reason she won\'t eat is because she is\r\nlonesome--misses her home and family. The wretches! I wish I had Daly\r\nhere! I\'d wring his neck," blustered Mr. Crowninshield.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t there anything we can do, Archibald? We simply must get that\r\ndog back before she dies. Poor little Lola! She was such a dependent\r\nlittle creature. It is terrible, terrible!"\r\n\r\n"There, there, my dear! Don\'t go all to pieces over it. Aren\'t we\r\ndoing all we can? Do you want Daly to smell a rat and toss his stolen\r\nproperty into the sea? Dacie says to give him rope enough and in time\r\nhe will hang himself, and I am inclined to think the advice wise.\r\nStill, that does not prevent me from wishing I could lay hands on\r\nDaly. I\'d like nothing better than to thrash the life out of him."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you will telephone the detective the news we\'ve received,"\r\nsuggested Bob, in order to quell the rising storm and divert Mr.\r\nCrowninshield\'s attention.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'ll get New York on the wire right away. It is as well Lyman\r\nand his pal should know Lola is sick and that they can\'t dally round\r\nforever."\r\n\r\n"Shall you be back for the wireless lesson?" called Bob, uncertain\r\nwhether to ask the question or not.\r\n\r\n"Oh, sure! It won\'t help matters for us to sit around and wail the\r\nwhole morning. We\'ll be on deck for your radio talk at the usual\r\ntime."\r\n\r\n"All right, sir."\r\n\r\nTrue to their agreement, at the appointed hour both Mr. and Mrs.\r\nCrowninshield made their appearance on the piazza and joined the group\r\nof young people who awaited their coming. They had, as Bob expressed\r\nit, cooled off a bit and were no longer in such an agitated frame of\r\nmind; nevertheless anxiety had left its mark by keying the master\'s\r\nvoice to a sharper note, and shadowing the lady\'s brow with a frown of\r\nannoyance.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you let out on O\'Connel, didn\'t you, after he got through\r\ntalking this morning?" was the first remark of the owner of Surfside.\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t say more than a word. Our license hasn\'t come yet, you\r\nknow."\r\n\r\n"That\'s so, darn it! I never saw anything in all my born life with so\r\nmany rules attached to it as this wireless business. It is one tangle\r\nof rules, rules, rules! You might as well be tied up in a net,"\r\nfretted the man.\r\n\r\n"There do seem to be a good many rules at first glance," returned Bob\r\npleasantly. "However, when you examine them most of them are both\r\nnecessary and wise. And after all when each radio operator knows in\r\nblack and white what he can do and what he can\'t it is far simpler."\r\n\r\n"I suppose so," grumbled Mr. Crowninshield.\r\n\r\n"Besides, there are always slackers at every job," continued Bob.\r\n"Rules help to keep such persons up to the mark and prevent\r\ncarelessness and accidents."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I fancy that is so," came more graciously from the still irate\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\n"Then all stations are not alike. That compass station at Bell Reef,\r\nfor example, that you were asking me about yesterday; the government\r\nlays out specific duties and makes special rules for such a station,\r\nas in fact it does for all radio stations. Some of these rules relate\r\nto the care of the place and the cleaning and general overhauling of\r\napparatus at stated intervals. There are, you see, certain instruments\r\nwhich must be cleaned and readjusted every day; certain others every\r\nweek, others every month, and some every six months. It simply means\r\nmaking sure that your outfit is in the pink of condition with every\r\npart functioning as it should. There are, of course, operators who\r\nwould see that this was done anyway, rules or no rules; but like every\r\nother profession there might be men who, off on an isolated spot with\r\nno one to keep them up to the mark, would grow careless and slovenly.\r\nToo much depends on wireless stations to run the risk of errors\r\nthrough imperfections in the equipment."\r\n\r\n"I can understand all that; but aren\'t there a score of other\r\nregulations?"\r\n\r\n"You mean about what they shall and shall not do?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"There certainly are. There have to be because we have several\r\ndifferent types of land stations. Just as the shipboard stations have\r\ntheir special kinds of work so do those on shore. For example, there\r\nare two different classes of radio compass stations,--those that\r\noperate independently and are located with a view to giving good\r\ncross-bearings to vessels that are from fifty to a hundred miles out\r\nto sea; and those known as harbor stations which are governed by a\r\ncentral control station and designed to inform ships within thirty\r\nmiles of the entrance to outer channels of their position. The\r\nfunction of each of these stations is, as you can see, quite different\r\nand therefore each of them is obliged to have its own set of rules."\r\n\r\n"I never knew anything about radio compass stations before," announced\r\nDick.\r\n\r\n"That is because you never sailed the seas and had to call on one for\r\naid," smiled Bob. "If you did you would be very thankful, I guess,\r\nthat the government has so carefully provided some one to answer just\r\nthe sort of question you wished answered. I try to remember this when\r\nI get hot under the collar because the license for our station does\r\nnot arrive. Uncle Sam can\'t help it if his men are slow. The plan at\r\nthe top is all right. There must be rules to govern wireless stations,\r\nbe they governmental, commercial, or private; rules to regulate the\r\nwave lengths each may use; rules to make sure the operators who have\r\ncharge of them know their job; and inspectors to make sure that every\r\nsuch rule is obeyed."\r\n\r\n"Who has the big chore of following up all these people and making\r\ncertain that they are conforming to the law?" questioned Mr.\r\nCrowninshield.\r\n\r\n"The Department of Commerce issues the licenses for all private and\r\ncommercial stations and sends its inspectors to keep an eye on\r\nwhatever comes under their control. It is this department that will\r\nhave jurisdiction over Surfside if the license is granted. Government\r\nradio stations on the other hand, not only the high-power class but\r\nthe coastal stations and everything that pertains to their relations\r\nwith commercial stations afloat or ashore, whether in the United\r\nStates or in foreign lands are entirely under the control of the\r\nDirector of Naval Communications of the Navy Department."\r\n\r\n"I wish you\'d tell us something more about compass stations," Dick\r\nsaid. "Were you ever stationed at one?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, for a little while I was on an island off the coast," replied\r\nBob. "But I did not like it very well and applied for a transfer."\r\n\r\n"It must have been lonely as the dickens on an island; worse, even,\r\nthan being at Seaver Bay. Why in goodness did they build the station\r\nthere?"\r\n\r\n"Why, you see, a compass station that operates independently as that\r\none did is usually situated on a lightship or an island because that\r\nlocation is best suited to the sort of work it has to do."\r\n\r\n"And that is?"\r\n\r\n"To give ships their positions when they sing out to ask exactly where\r\nthey are," replied Bob. "Since the station is fairly well out to sea\r\nitself, it is able to furnish excellent cross-bearings and set the\r\nvessel on her course in case she is off it. Ships have been known to\r\nmiss their way, you know, especially in a fog; and if they have not\r\nmissed it they are often very grateful to be assured they have not and\r\nthat their own calculations were correct. So the rule is that an\r\noperator must always be listening in for at least three minutes at\r\nten, twenty-five, forty, and fifty-five minutes past the hour and be\r\nready to answer a Q T E when he hears it."\r\n\r\n"What\'s a Q T E?" inquired both Dick and Walter simultaneously.\r\n\r\n"Those particular letters mean: _What is my true bearing?_ It takes\r\nless time to send the letters than to spell out the entire sentence\r\nand therefore a simple code which means the same in all languages is\r\nused. When such a call is received the operator replies: Q T S\r\n(meaning: Your true bearing is) and then follows it with the number of\r\ndegrees from his radio post stated in words, and also the name of the\r\nstation responding to the message. It is a general rule, by-the-by,\r\nthat all numerals used in any wireless communication must be spelled\r\nout to make sure of their being perfectly understood."\r\n\r\n"What a bother!" ejaculated Walter.\r\n\r\n"It prevents mistakes, brother; and if it does that it is certainly\r\nworth the trouble."\r\n\r\n"I suppose so," answered His Highness a trifle crestfallen.\r\n\r\n"Then what do you say next?" interrupted Dick, who was much interested\r\nin the subject in hand.\r\n\r\n"Well, after you have given the true bearing the ship wires: Q T F."\r\n\r\n"And that means?"\r\n\r\n"_What is my position?_"\r\n\r\n"And you have to repeat those words before giving it just as you did\r\nbefore?" asked Dick.\r\n\r\n"Always," nodded Bob. "Every question asked is always repeated by the\r\noperator answering it to make sure that each party fully understands\r\nwhat is being talked about. You can\'t risk having a ship complain:\r\n\'Oh, I thought those figures you sent me were so-and-so.\' No, indeed.\r\nEverything must be so explicit that there will be no room for\r\nblunders. So after you have repeated the question you send the\r\nlatitude and longitude _in words_."\r\n\r\n"I guess there is sense in the rules after all," smiled Mrs.\r\nCrowninshield. "Thus far we have not discovered any which, on being\r\nexamined, were not both reasonable and wise."\r\n\r\n"That\'s the way I feel," Bob rejoined. "After being in radio work and\r\nseeing the opportunities there are for mistakes I have decided\r\noperators cannot be too careful. You see it is not like talking with\r\na person face to face. Those you are communicating with are usually\r\nmiles and miles away. Such stations as I have been telling you about\r\nare on the lookout for any six-hundred-meter calls and they answer in\r\nthis tune. After communication with a ship is established, however,\r\nthe tune shifts to seven hundred and fifty-six meters if a Navy vessel\r\nshould be talking; if not, the six-hundred-meter wave length assigned\r\nis used. This leaves the shorter range waves to commercial vessels and\r\ngreatly simplifies matters."\r\n\r\n"That is a good rule, too," chimed in Mr. Crowninshield.\r\n\r\n"And now about the harbor stations," suggested Dick.\r\n\r\nThe young tutor smiled.\r\n\r\n"I had not intended to give you all this stuff this morning,"\r\nprotested he, "but since you are interested in it we may as well go on\r\nwith the subject. The task of the harbor stations, then, is to listen\r\nboth on a six-hundred-meter range, and one of nine hundred and\r\nfifty-two--the first wave length for commercial and the latter for\r\nNavy ship\'s calls. Then in response to inquiry the operator directs\r\nthe vessel how to enter that particular harbor, stating just where the\r\nentrance buoys are and where the channel lies. If the man at the wheel\r\nis new to the port this aid is invaluable."\r\n\r\n"Not much like the navigation of the old days, is it?" mused Mr.\r\nCrowninshield. "I should think such stations would put pilots out of\r\nbusiness."\r\n\r\n"They do to some extent," was the reply. "There are, however, always\r\nships that cannot make a landing under their own steam, ships that\r\nhave to be towed. So the pilots still find something to do."\r\n\r\n"And are these harbor stations on islands too?" questioned Nancy.\r\n\r\n"Many of them are. A small proportion of them, though, are in\r\nlighthouses. It all depends on which place has the more favorable\r\nlocation."\r\n\r\n"But do not the land stations that send messages sometimes interfere\r\nwith these stations?" queried Mr. Crowninshield.\r\n\r\n"There are rules to prevent _that_," laughed Bob. "Of course the\r\ndifference in wave length to which the various types of stations are\r\nlimited solves a part of this difficulty. As I told you commercial\r\nstations have their own particular wave length and must stick to it;\r\nand private stations such as this one here have their range of two\r\nhundred meters in which to operate and are confined to not more than\r\none kilowatt for sending messages. You cannot use more than this\r\nwithout special permission from the Secretary of Labor. Should you do\r\nso you are liable to a fine of one hundred dollars if your offense is\r\ndeliberate; if, however, it is proved that your apparatus was out of\r\nadjustment and overreached itself you may get off with a\r\ntwenty-five-dollar fine. In that case you must see at once that your\r\nradio error is corrected and your outfit set right."\r\n\r\n"But sometimes along the coast aren\'t there big government stations\r\nbelonging to the army or navy? I should think these, with their press\r\nof business, would butt in on the smaller ones and raise havoc with\r\nthem," ventured Mr. Crowninshield.\r\n\r\n"Where there are such mix-ups and private or commercial stations\r\ninterfere with important government outfits the smaller ones are not\r\nallowed to send messages during the first fifteen minutes of each\r\nhour, such time being reserved for government business. The\r\ngovernment, on the other hand, must respect the rights of the littler\r\nchap and use this particular interval for transmitting. In fact, when\r\nlicenses are issued this condition is made with private owners and the\r\nstation is so listed. Of course, however, should an S O S call come,\r\nall rules go by the boards and the distress call has the right of way\r\nin every case."\r\n\r\nMrs. Crowninshield, smiling mischievously, rose from her chair.\r\n\r\n"There is an S O S coming in right now for a lemonade," said she,\r\nfanning herself with her filmy handkerchief. "Who will join me?"\r\n\r\nA chorus of "I!" "I!" greeted the question.\r\n\r\nShe touched a bell.\r\n\r\n"Bring lemonade for six, Emelie," said she. "Put in some slices of\r\norange, some strawberries, and plenty of cracked ice. What a warm day\r\nit is! I am glad I am not out on some hot, sun-baked island answering\r\nradio calls."\r\n\r\n"You probably would not be hot if you were on an island out to sea, my\r\ndear," her husband returned playfully. "However, I\'ll agree that this\r\nveranda is good enough for me on a July day."\r\n\r\nThe tinkling of ice cut short the conversation. Far away through the\r\nhouse its distant cadence sounded.\r\n\r\n"The first and tallest lemonade must be for Bob," Nancy announced. "He\r\nhas certainly earned it."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nMIRACLES\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough throughout the day Mr. Crowninshield did not wander far from\r\nthe telephone no word came from the New York detectives and evening\r\nsaw him quite discouraged.\r\n\r\n"I cannot imagine what those fellows are up to," fretted he. "Now that\r\nthey know where the yacht is and have had all day to do something\r\nabout it, it is beyond my comprehension why they haven\'t. Lola will be\r\ndead before they get round to moving on Daly."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe they are sitting idle," Bob declared in an effort to\r\ncheer his patron. "Probably there will be news to-morrow."\r\n\r\n"Maybe," sighed the financier. "But if something does not happen by\r\nto-morrow, I shall start myself in my own yacht to chase up Daly."\r\n\r\n"I doubt if that would do any good, sir," protested Bob. "It might\r\nsimply, as you said yourself, precipitate a crisis."\r\n\r\n"Well, a crisis is better than having nothing done," fumed the man\r\nirritably.\r\n\r\n"You must not forget there is O\'Connel."\r\n\r\n"Much good he is doing. We have only heard from him once and as we\r\nhave no license you can\'t talk to him."\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless, he is on the job at his end of the line," Bob answered.\r\n"He has a lot of common sense, too. You can trust him to keep tabs on\r\nhow things are moving."\r\n\r\n"Maybe I can. I hope so," was the dismal retort.\r\n\r\nEvening, however, saw no improvement in Mr. Crowninshield\'s mood. "Not\r\na yip of any sort from those chaps in New York. One would think they\r\nwere dead," he growled. "Well, I\'ll give them one more day and then if\r\nthey haven\'t something to show I will send them to blazes and take up\r\nthe case myself. I almost wish I had done it in the first place. Here\r\nI am paying a small fortune and getting no results."\r\n\r\nAgain Bob struggled to soothe the perturbed mind and raise the\r\ncapitalist\'s spirits.\r\n\r\n"Oh, we\'ll hear something to-morrow, I guess," said he with an\r\noptimism he did not altogether feel. "Maybe my license will come; or\r\nthe inspector may appear; or O\'Connel may send tidings; or news may\r\ncome from New York. Something is sure to happen. Why don\'t we all go\r\nover to the station and listen in on the broadcasting to-night. We are\r\nsure to get something that will be interesting and now that the \'loud\r\nspeaker\' is in position we shall be able to hear without using\r\nindividual receivers. You haven\'t any of you really heard what our\r\nwireless can do."\r\n\r\n"I know it," acknowledged the gentleman. "You see, just about every\r\nnight during broadcasting hours we have either had company or I have\r\nbeen busy."\r\n\r\n"But are you to be busy to-night?" inquired Bob.\r\n\r\n"No, I fancy we\'re not. Mrs. Crowninshield said there was nothing on."\r\n\r\n"Then why don\'t we light up the boathouse, and all of us listen to\r\nwhat is going on in the world," Bob suggested. "I wish, too, Jerry\r\nmight come. He has not had a chance to see the outfit at all, much\r\nless hear it. If it would not annoy you and the ladies just to let him\r\nsit at the back of the room he could hear everything now that the horn\r\nis on." Bob hesitated. "He has been so kind about helping us----"\r\n\r\n"Sure! Ask him by all means," Mr. Crowninshield assented heartily. "Or\r\nbetter yet, I will ask him myself. I am glad you reminded me of it.\r\nJerry is my right-hand man and I like to give him pleasure when I can.\r\nWhat time will your show begin?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, from seven o\'clock on there is usually something doing, sir. But\r\nthe most interesting part of the program begins at eight."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll be on hand, then."\r\n\r\nThis promise won Bob imparted the tidings to Dick and Walter and the\r\ntwo assistants, as they dubbed themselves, hastened to prepare the new\r\nradio building for the reception of guests. Comfortable chairs and gay\r\ncushions were brought from the house and in his enthusiasm Dick even\r\nwent so far as to drape a flag over the entrance of the low room.\r\n\r\n"We might have hung out bunting if we\'d known sooner they were\r\ncoming," said he.\r\n\r\n"I guess they won\'t care about the bunting once they are inside the\r\nplace," Walter asserted in a comforting tone.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you hope the outfit will show up well? I do," declared Dick.\r\n"It would be just our luck to have something act up so we couldn\'t\r\nhear anything. Then Dad, who is feeling pretty much on edge anyway,\r\nwould announce that a wireless was simply money thrown in a hole."\r\n\r\n"We\'re not responsible for the conditions," laughed Bob. "If static is\r\nbothersome it is not our fault."\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless, Dad wouldn\'t understand that. He would just think we\r\ndid not know how to operate the thing."\r\n\r\n"Well, we\'ll pray for moderate quiet," smiled Bob. "Of course I\'d like\r\nthe apparatus to show off at its best. But like a child, it probably\r\nwon\'t. We shall have to take our luck; and if we do not get\r\nsatisfactory results to-night why the audience will have to come again\r\nto-morrow or some other time."\r\n\r\n"Maybe it won\'t--at least maybe Dad won\'t," Dick answered\r\nincoherently. "If he starts off in the yacht to-morrow----"\r\n\r\n"Oh, he won\'t set off to chase Daly to-morrow, don\'t you fret," put in\r\nHis Highness. "He was only sputtering. What good could he do? He\r\nwouldn\'t have any right to search the _Siren_ even if he overtook her;\r\nnor could he arrest the criminals aboard her. Daly would pitch Lola\r\nover the side of the boat before he would stand by and let your father\r\nboard his yacht and he knows it."\r\n\r\n"Maybe he does," admitted Dick. "Still, he was tremendously in earnest\r\nthis afternoon."\r\n\r\n"He has calmed down some now," His Highness replied.\r\n\r\n"I hope he\'ll stay calmed," Dick smiled. "Perhaps, unless our show\r\ngoes wrong and he gets irate at the radio company, he will."\r\n\r\nIn fact had the three young wireless operators been willing to admit\r\nit they were far more perturbed when they heard the invited company\r\napproaching than they would have been willing to confess. In the heart\r\nof each of them was the same thought: the new radiophone must justify\r\nitself and prove that it was worth all the money that had been\r\nexpended upon it.\r\n\r\n"Well, here we are! And here\'s Jerry, too. He said he couldn\'t\r\npossibly come--tried to make me believe he was too busy, the rascal.\r\nBut I labored with him and finally got him here," announced the master\r\ntriumphantly.\r\n\r\nVery hot and very uncomfortable under the general banter Jerry\r\nblushed.\r\n\r\n"Now where do you wish to put us, Dick?" inquired the boy\'s mother.\r\n"We are under your orders to-night--yours and Bob\'s."\r\n\r\n"I think you will be able to hear in any of these chairs--that is, if\r\nwe hear at all," Dick responded nervously.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by _able to hear at all_?" put in his father\r\nsharply.\r\n\r\n"Why--eh--sometimes conditions vary," was the ambiguous answer. "One\r\ndoes not always hear equally well." It seemed wiser to prepare his\r\nfather\'s mind for possible disappointment.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Bob was tinkering with the plugs.\r\n\r\n"Everybody ready?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"All on deck!" came from Mr. Crowninshield whose depression, it was\r\nplain to be seen, had momentarily vanished.\r\n\r\n"Then here goes!" cried Bob.\r\n\r\nInstantly the quiet of the room was transformed into a chaos of sound.\r\nThere was a shrill piping as of a singing wind, and a wail that echoed\r\nhauntingly through the air as the tuner revolved.\r\n\r\n"What in the name of goodness----?" began Mr. Crowninshield.\r\n\r\n"Hush, Dad! It is always like that," explained Dick hastily.\r\n\r\n"But it\'s horrible."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I know. But wait."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t something out of order?"\r\n\r\n"No." Dick smiled patronizingly.\r\n\r\n"My soul and body," whispered Jerry from his corner, "did anybody ever\r\nhear such a sound? Ain\'t it the wind outside. Seems as if a gale must\r\nhave come up--a hurricane, tornado, or something. If a storm\'s coming\r\nI can\'t sit round here. I\'ll have to be seeing to the awnings or\r\nthey\'ll be ripped to pieces." He half rose from his chair.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t worry, Jerry; everything\'s all right outside," interrupted\r\nWalter reassuringly.\r\n\r\n"You mean to say it\'s just in here?" murmured the bewildered Jerry.\r\nEnjoying the old man\'s confusion, Walter nodded.\r\n\r\n"What you hear is the rise of our pitch," explained Dick.\r\n\r\n"I should think it was the rise of something," grumbled Mr.\r\nCrowninshield.\r\n\r\n"We are running up our meters in order to catch the higher tuned\r\nwaves," Bob added. "That is part of the bedlam."\r\n\r\n"And the rest?"\r\n\r\n"It is static interference."\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?"\r\n\r\n"Well, static is the big bugbear of radio," answered Bob, pausing a\r\nmoment in regulating his tuner and detector. "It is caused by stray\r\nwaves moving in various directions through the atmosphere, and by\r\nelectrical conditions. It is the defect all wireless people have to\r\nfight. Sometimes it is worse than others and unfortunately to-night it\r\npromises to be pretty bad. You see it has been a close, heavy day and\r\nno doubt thunderstorms are in the air. A thunderstorm will kick up no\r\nend of a rumpus with wireless."\r\n\r\n"But we haven\'t had any thunderstorm," Nancy called above the hubbub.\r\n\r\n"No, but somebody else\'s thunderstorm would bother us almost as\r\nmuch," Bob explained good-humoredly.\r\n\r\n"Never mind the thunderstorms now," put in Mr. Crowninshield. "Aren\'t\r\nwe going to hear anything but this whistling and groaning? Whee! There\r\nit goes again. It is for all the world like a chorus of cats."\r\n\r\n"It is more like a siren horn tooting up and down," laughed Nancy.\r\n\r\nA spluttering crackle blotted out the wail.\r\n\r\n"You would think they were frying doughnuts," grinned Dick, "wouldn\'t\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"And you really believe a thunderstorm would cause a noise like this?"\r\nqueried Mrs. Crowninshield incredulously.\r\n\r\n"It might. We have no way of knowing exactly what is raising the\r\ntrouble."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to say that a storm that wasn\'t round here at all\r\ncould----" burst out Jerry, then stopped embarrassed.\r\n\r\n"Indeed it could," replied Bob, answering the unfinished question.\r\n"You see thunderstorms cause powerful electrical waves that affect\r\napparatus miles and miles distant. Of course such waves vary in length\r\nbut nevertheless they act on all aerials to a greater or less degree.\r\nThen, too, the atmospheric conditions are never quite identical,\r\nchanging with the hour of the day, the season of the year, and local\r\nweather disturbances. Fortunately, since the air is positively\r\nelectrified and the earth negatively, certain of these differences are\r\nremedied by the aerial that connects the two, the current discharges\r\npartially seeping off through the ground. Sometimes, however, in spite\r\nof every device used, such currents are strong enough to cause a roar\r\nin the receiver. In addition there is the interference from other\r\nradio stations which are busy transmitting messages, and although\r\nthere are rules that aim to reduce this annoyance, it is, to a certain\r\nextent, always to be reckoned with."\r\n\r\n"I should think somebody ought to invent something to prevent such\r\ntroubles," declared Nancy.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you, Sis?" asked Dick wickedly.\r\n\r\n"But it is terrible to have the air so full of noise," continued the\r\ngirl, as she made a little face at her brother. "I\'ve always thought\r\nof the air as being still."\r\n\r\n"It is still in a general sense," smiled Bob. "It is only when the\r\namplifier of the wireless magnifies the sounds that we realize how\r\nmany of them our ears fail to hear."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a downright mercy they do!" exclaimed Jerry.\r\n\r\n"You\'re right there, Jerry!" agreed Mr. Crowninshield.\r\n\r\n"But how do messages come through such a chaos?" Dick inquired.\r\n\r\n"Sometimes they don\'t," laughed Bob. "But nine cases out of ten they\r\ndo because there are ways of combating static interference. You can,\r\nfor instance, tune your apparatus to a higher or lower pitch and\r\nthereby escape from the zone where the noise is. That whine you hear\r\nis produced by my turning the tuning knob and increasing our range of\r\nmeters. Already with the higher vibration you will notice the hubbub\r\nhas lessened."\r\n\r\n"Yes, things are ever so much clearer," agreed a chorus of voices.\r\n\r\n"That is one way, then, out of the difficulty. There are, in addition,\r\nother mechanical means that can be resorted to when you learn more\r\nabout handling the outfit. Suffice it to say that in a general way\r\nwhatever tends toward inertia, or a lack of electrical activity,\r\ndecreases static interference."\r\n\r\nThere was a pause in which above the crackling and the wailing of the\r\ninstrument a faint sound became audible.\r\n\r\n"Gee! Did you hear that?" cried Walter.\r\n\r\n"Hush!"\r\n\r\n"But I heard a voice quite distinctly."\r\n\r\n"Keep still, can\'t you?" Dick remarked unceremoniously.\r\n\r\nThen plainly into the room came the words:\r\n\r\n"Station (WGI) Amrad Medford Hillside, Mass. 360 meters. Stand by for\r\nBoston Police reports."\r\n\r\n"That is the police news," whispered Dick to Nancy. "Among other\r\nthings it gives the automobiles that are lost, their numbers, and a\r\ndescription of each."\r\n\r\n"Want to hear it?" asked Bob of his audience.\r\n\r\n"Not unless they can tell us they have found Lola," responded Mr.\r\nCrowninshield promptly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no," his wife hastened to add, "let\'s not listen to a long\r\nstring of crimes. Goodness knows there are enough of them to read in\r\nthe papers."\r\n\r\nShe shook her head warningly at Bob and motioned toward her husband.\r\n\r\n"I\'d rather hear some music," put in Nancy. "Can\'t we?"\r\n\r\nThere was an ascending wail from the tuner.\r\n\r\n"Ain\'t that a band?" cried Jerry excitedly.\r\n\r\n"It\'s an orchestra!" Nancy ejaculated in the same breath.\r\n\r\n"It\'s gone!"\r\n\r\n"We\'ll get it again," was Bob\'s confident answer as he twirled the\r\nknobs of both tuner and detector.\r\n\r\n"There it is!" burst out Jerry. "It\'s a brass band, as I live!"\r\n\r\n"Where do you suppose it is?" speculated Mrs. Crowninshield.\r\n\r\n"Pittsburgh or Chicago; or perhaps Newark."\r\n\r\n"Not Chicago--out West! You\'re fooling," observed Jerry with scorn.\r\n\r\n"Indeed I\'m not. Wait and you\'ll hear in a few moments exactly who it\r\nwas."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll not believe it unless I do," the old man announced, with a zest\r\nthat provoked a general laugh.\r\n\r\n"What time is it? Can any one tell?" asked Bob.\r\n\r\n"What difference does that make," Walter inquired.\r\n\r\n"It will give us a cue as to who it is," was the explanation. "All\r\nthese broadcasting stations have certain hours for their programs."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve seen those lists published in the papers, but I never took any\r\nstock in them," growled Jerry.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll have to now, Jerry," said Nancy mischievously.\r\n\r\nShe saw him scratch his head.\r\n\r\n"Well, I dunno," was his laconic reply. "The whole thing beats me. If\r\nthat band was in Chicago----"\r\n\r\n"Hush!"\r\n\r\nThe crash of instruments had come to an end and over the wire in\r\naccents unmistakably distinct came the words:\r\n\r\n"Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Company KYW Chicago,\r\nIllinois. Stand by fifteen minutes for----" but the rest of the\r\nsentence was lost, for with a mighty slap of his knees Jerry roared:\r\n\r\n"It was in Chicago--that band! Well, I\'ll be buttered!"\r\n\r\nOverwhelmed the Cape Codder had risen to his feet.\r\n\r\n"Chicago! Pittsburgh! Medford! My eye, but this will do me to talk\r\nabout until the day of my death. It don\'t seem possible; I\'m beat if\r\nit does."\r\n\r\nHelplessly he dropped back into his chair again, silenced by very\r\nwonder.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime out of the wailing and whining and piping the sharp,\r\nclear-cut click of a telegraph instrument could be discerned.\r\n\r\n"That\'s the Morse code," explained Bob. "Some commercial station is\r\nsending a message. It seems to be about a shipment of lumber and\r\nisn\'t particularly interesting."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you can read it," said Dick enviously.\r\n\r\n"Naturally. That is part of my job, you know."\r\n\r\n"What is a commercial station?" inquired the still bewildered Jerry.\r\n\r\n"A station that sends only messages for the general public. Probably\r\nthis load of lumber started out of port without the captain of the\r\nship having the least idea in the world where he was to market it. In\r\nthe interval since it left, however, the company\'s shore agents have\r\nsecured a customer for it, perhaps in New Bedford, Boston, Providence,\r\nor some other coast city and they are now notifying the ship where to\r\ndeliver it. Such an arrangement is quite common nowadays. Were the\r\ncaptain obliged to hold his cargo in port until he had a purchaser, as\r\nwas the usual rule in the past, he would be wasting much precious\r\ntime. By this method he can set forth the moment the vessel is loaded\r\nand during his voyage let his managers search for buyers. In all\r\nprobability by the time he nears New England harbors his wares will be\r\nsold and orders sent him where to deposit them."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a neat little scheme!" observed Walter.\r\n\r\nBut poor Jerry was too much overcome by the marvels he had witnessed\r\nto comment on this added miracle. All he could do was to reiterate\r\nfeebly: "It beats me--hanged if it don\'t!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE LAWS OF THE AIR\r\n\r\n\r\nMorning found Mr. Crowninshield in no more tractable a mood. Even\r\nbefore Bob could reach his post at the wireless station and adjust his\r\ndouble head receiver to his ears his employer came briskly across the\r\ngrass with his after-breakfast cigar between his lips.\r\n\r\n"Well," began he, when he was within calling distance, "any news yet?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid not yet, sir. It is still early."\r\n\r\nThe great man took out his watch.\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it almost time for O\'Connel to signal?"\r\n\r\n"It is nearing the time."\r\n\r\n"I wonder if he will have any tidings for us?"\r\n\r\n"I certainly hope so." The wish was uttered with deep sincerity. A\r\nspeculation was forming in the young operator\'s mind as to how he was\r\ngoing to pacify the irascible gentleman before him should no tidings\r\ncome.\r\n\r\n"Since I\'m here I believe I\'ll drop down and wait until you get into\r\ntouch with the _Siren_."\r\n\r\n"It is liable to be quite a little while. Sometimes there is delay."\r\n\r\n"No matter. I\'ve nothing especial to do to-day."\r\n\r\nWith sinking heart Bob turned away and began to fuss with his oil can\r\nand a bit of cotton waste.\r\n\r\n"As you will, sir," was all he said.\r\n\r\n"You think, don\'t you, that we will hear something definite this\r\nmorning?"\r\n\r\n"There is no telling."\r\n\r\n"No, of course not. Nevertheless O\'Connel can at least let us know\r\nwhether Lola is worse or better."\r\n\r\n"Yes, we ought to ascertain that."\r\n\r\n"He wouldn\'t be such an idiot as to stand by and see the dog die,\r\nwould he?"\r\n\r\n"One never can predict just what another person will do. However, I\r\nfeel sure you can trust O\'Connel. I never knew him to bungle anything\r\nyet."\r\n\r\nWith that comfort Mr. Crowninshield was obliged to content himself.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding it, however, he began to pace nervously back and\r\nforth, and every time there was a sound in the room he would whisk\r\nabout with the quick remark:\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t you hear something?"\r\n\r\nBut although he fretted and fumed, strolled out the door and in again,\r\nno amount of impatience appeared to hurry matters.\r\n\r\nEven Bob began to lose his poise and fear no message was coming when\r\nsuddenly the well-known signal came and the familiar clockwork began\r\nto be clicked off.\r\n\r\n"Is it he?" demanded Mr. Crowninshield in a tense whisper.\r\n\r\nBob nodded.\r\n\r\nOn clicked the code. Then suddenly it stopped and the man who was\r\nwatching saw the operator raise the discs of rubber from his ears and\r\nshake himself free of his metal trappings.\r\n\r\n"Well?" inquired Mr. Crowninshield in quick staccato.\r\n\r\n"It was O\'Connel. All he said was: _Wait developments._"\r\n\r\n"Not a word about Lola?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir."\r\n\r\n"Not a reference of any sort?"\r\n\r\n"That was all."\r\n\r\n"But that is no kind of a message," announced the exasperated owner of\r\nSurfside. "Why, it might mean almost anything."\r\n\r\n"It sounds hopeful to me."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see any hope in it," was the despondent answer.\r\n\r\n"It least it gives us to understand that something is brewing."\r\n\r\n"But why couldn\'t he have told us more?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps he did not dare to. They may have begun to suspect he was\r\nsending private messages."\r\n\r\n"Humph! I had not thought of that."\r\n\r\n"Or possibly he may have been in a rush. He sent the letters at a\r\ntremendous pace--so fast that I had to race him. It seemed as if he\r\nwas afraid he might not be able to get the message through."\r\n\r\n"You didn\'t answer anything, I suppose."\r\n\r\n"Only my signal to let him know I was listening."\r\n\r\n"Then you think there is nothing more to be done at present but sit\r\nright here and see what happens?"\r\n\r\n"I do not see how we can do anything else."\r\n\r\n"It\'s frightfully annoying."\r\n\r\n"Yes. Nevertheless it is our only course."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve no inkling whether the developments he mentioned are to be\r\nsoon or not?"\r\n\r\n"Not the ghost of an idea."\r\n\r\n"Then there is nothing for it but to hold on right here a while\r\nlonger, I\'m afraid. And since we are all to be tied to the spot you\r\nmay as well come up to the house later and give Dick his usual radio\r\nlesson."\r\n\r\n"Very well, sir."\r\n\r\nWith a curt nod the financier went out the door and after seeing that\r\neverything was right Bob locked up the building and followed him.\r\n\r\nHe found the little group assembled in the lee of the awnings waiting\r\nfor him. Mr. Crowninshield was there, too, gnawing fiercely at a fresh\r\ncigar.\r\n\r\n"I hear you have had a message, Bob," Mrs. Crowninshield said as he\r\napproached.\r\n\r\n"Yes; a rather hopeful one, I think."\r\n\r\n"I\'m so excited! We all are. What do you suppose is in the wind?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ve no idea. Something good, I hope."\r\n\r\n"Is that Morse code hard to learn?" inquired Nancy.\r\n\r\n"The Morse Continental? That depends on what you consider hard,"\r\nsmiled Bob. "If your memory is good and you are quick at catching\r\nsounds it ought not to be very awful. Numberless persons do learn it."\r\n\r\n"Of course sending messages after you have the code learned cannot be\r\nso bad, for you can take your own time," Dick put in. "It is receiving\r\nthem that would fuss me."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll fix you up with a buzzer and let you and Walter practice later\r\nif you want a try."\r\n\r\n"Could you?" asked Dick eagerly.\r\n\r\n"Sure! Moreover, there are phonograph records made on purpose to be\r\nused by beginners. Perhaps your father will get you some of those. It\r\nis a fine way to learn, training your ear to the sounds and giving you\r\nlots of practice."\r\n\r\n"What a bully scheme!"\r\n\r\n"It is a good proof of how one science can help another, isn\'t it?"\r\nobserved Mrs. Crowninshield.\r\n\r\n"I suppose transmitting is a great deal harder than receiving anyhow,\r\nisn\'t it?" pursued Dick.\r\n\r\n"Well, of course there is more to it. In the rough it is merely the\r\nreverse of receiving; but in reality to project a message through the\r\nair requires a more elaborate outfit."\r\n\r\n"But you said our wireless would send as well as receive."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it will. It was made with both ends of the service in view. Your\r\napparatus would first have to be adjusted and tuned until it was at\r\nthe same frequency as the station with which you were talking. That\r\nyou have to do anyhow, whether you are sending or receiving. And I\r\ntold you, you remember, how to regulate that. Your antenna is\r\nconnected through an adjustable induction coil, and moreover you have\r\na small condenser which together with it forms a closed circuit. It is\r\nsimple enough when you understand the principle to adjust the\r\nvibratory motion in the antenna by moving the connection. The\r\nfrequency of the closed circuit can be adjusted, too. Tuning is\r\nnothing more than putting these two circuits into accord with the\r\nwaves you receive. Your detector does a good part of the work for you,\r\nfor it responds to every oscillation set up in the receiver. When,\r\nhowever, you are transmitting a message, you must take care to cut out\r\nyour receiver by turning on the switch. Never forget that. You won\'t\r\nbe likely to, either, when you are told why. You see it requires power\r\nto send out transmission waves and therefore to do it you have to\r\nemploy a high-pressure current. Receiving, on the other hand, demands\r\ndelicately adjusted instruments which are equipped to catch every\r\nfaint, incoming wave. Should you let the strong charge of electricity\r\nused for transmission pass through your fragile receiving apparatus\r\nyou would ruin it in no time."\r\n\r\n"I can see that," replied Dick.\r\n\r\n"Grasp that notion and you have one big principle of the difference\r\nbetween sending messages and receiving them," said Bob. "Skill in\r\nlearning to take messages either in code or cipher comes with\r\npractice. The more you work at it the faster you can go. You have a\r\nkeyboard all installed and the only thing standing between you and an\r\nexpert operator is patience. Speed comes sooner than you think, too,\r\nif you practice persistently every day. As for the Morse code you\r\npress the key lever down quickly and instantly release it to make a\r\ndot. A dash is equal to three dots; the space between the parts of the\r\nsame letters is equal to a dot; that between two letters to three\r\ndots; and between two words to five dots. You must train your ear\r\nuntil the span of these intervals becomes unmistakable. When you get\r\nsome skill and are ready to try out what you can do, you will find\r\nthat there are several ways of getting wider practice. There are, for\r\nexample, local clubs that broadcast in code and send messages limited\r\nin speed to an amateur\'s capacity. Such centers are considerate enough\r\nto transmit at the rate of not more than five or ten words to the\r\nminute. It is persistence and a willingness to go slowly and carefully\r\nthat win out in the end. A moderately delivered message that is\r\nwithout errors is worth a dozen fast, inaccurate ones; for when you\r\nblunder and have to go back and repeat, you not only waste your time\r\nand that of the man at the other end of the line but you annoy and\r\nusually confuse him. You will never gain anything if you are content\r\nwith being a sloppy operator since above everything else radio\r\nmessages must be correct. That is their chief value. Therefore, if\r\nafter trying with all your might you find you cannot qualify as a\r\ntopnotch, high-speed man be content to drop into the class below and\r\nbe an accurate, slower operator. There are always certain things we\r\ndo better than others. Speed may not be one of your gifts. That is no\r\nsign you have not other talents, however. Face the fact and go into\r\nthe class where you belong. You won\'t get so nervous and fussed up,\r\nand by and by you may surprise yourself by finding that with time and\r\nexperience the desired speed will come."\r\n\r\n"I am not aiming to be a crackerjack like you," grinned Dick. "If I\r\ncan take down and send any messages at all I shall feel pretty cocky."\r\n\r\n"You think that now," returned Bob, ignoring the flattery contained in\r\nthe observation. "But by and by you will find yourself discontented\r\nand as crazy to make time as you are in an automobile. There is a\r\nfascination about it."\r\n\r\n"Doesn\'t the Morse Continental bother you a bit?" inquired Mr.\r\nCrowninshield.\r\n\r\n"Not a particle. In fact, it has come to be almost as easy reading as\r\nstraight English," answered Bob. "The thing that does fuss me\r\nsometimes though is to send and receive in cipher."\r\n\r\n"Mercy! Do they do that too?" gasped Mrs. Crowninshield.\r\n\r\n"Certainly. Often both in time of war and times of peace confidential\r\nmessages which it is not desirable all the world should know have to\r\nbe transmitted. Sometimes these are government communications;\r\nsometimes business or personal ones. At any rate, their senders wish\r\nthem kept private and hence they are sent in cipher. Many of them are\r\nqueer enough, too, when they come in."\r\n\r\n"Can you understand them yourself?" asked Nancy.\r\n\r\n"Certainly not. It is not intended that any one except the person for\r\nwhom they are intended shall know what they mean."\r\n\r\n"But I should think since they make no sense you would wonder whether\r\nyou had them right," commented Dick.\r\n\r\n"I do wonder sometimes," admitted Bob honestly. "When you get a\r\nsequence of queer words or combinations of letters you cannot help\r\nwondering. However, there is not much chance for a mistake, either in\r\nthe transmission or in the delivery of such messages, for the operator\r\nis always obliged to send them slower than he does ordinary stuff,\r\nspacing the letters or groups of letters with unusual care.\r\nFurthermore, code words are always repeated once. This gives the man\r\nreceiving them a chance to print the letters by hand rather than write\r\nthem, a precaution that does much to prevent mistakes. The address and\r\nsignature must also be very carefully transmitted. With such\r\nwatchfulness at each end of the line it would be only a colossally\r\nstupid person who would blunder."\r\n\r\n"But suppose the operator who is transmitting went faster than you\r\ncould?" murmured Walter.\r\n\r\n"He doesn\'t as a general rule. It isn\'t wireless ethics. And even\r\nshould he be a more skillful radio man he knows he would gain nothing\r\nby hustling the chap at the other end for he would only lose time by\r\nhaving to go back and repeat."\r\n\r\n"Is all the general transmission of messages given such care?"\r\ninquired Mr. Crowninshield.\r\n\r\n"Of course cipher communications are fussier," Bob said. "Nevertheless\r\nthe rules are pretty strict for all messages. And since accuracy is\r\nthe keynote of radio and to get it your outfit must be in A1\r\ncondition, every care must be taken to have strong, clear, and\r\neffective sending and receiving power. That means you must constantly\r\nclean your apparatus and tighten it up; test out your detector by the\r\nbuzzer intended for the purpose and make sure that it is in sensitive\r\ncondition; and assure yourself that every part of your set is OK.\r\nMoreover, an operator who is on duty listening in is expected to wear\r\nthe double head receiver all the time, so no sound, however faint, may\r\nget by him. He must also see that his detector is adjusted to its\r\ngreatest degree of sensibility and his tuner to the proper wave\r\nlength. If your station happens to be near another, or if you are one\r\nof a group of ships and other vessels near yours are sending, you must\r\nwatch out and either weaken the coupling of your detector or open your\r\nswitch and cut it out altogether when those around you are using\r\npowerful currents for transmission; else you will wreck this delicate\r\npart of your instrument."\r\n\r\n"Gee, but there are things to remember!" ejaculated Dick.\r\n\r\n"Not so many, really, if you use ordinary brains," Bob returned. "You\r\njust have to think, that is all. A few big principles hold throughout.\r\nThe other _don\'ts_ are simply to make your own work and the other\r\nfellow\'s smoother; prevent mistakes; do away with as much interference\r\nas possible; and protect your outfit. For example, I found I could\r\noften lessen the interference by loosening the coupling of my\r\nreceiving set after I had heard a call and reduce the sound to a point\r\nwhere it was just readable. You get your message all right but you do\r\nnot get so much else with it. Then you can save wear and tear if you\r\nonly run your generator while you are sending messages. That you\r\ncannot transmit at the hours reserved for naval radio stations to send\r\nout the time signals by which navigators set their chronometers, or\r\nwhen operators are broadcasting, goes without saying. Any dunce would\r\nknow that."\r\n\r\n"I had no idea there were hours for sending out the time," confessed\r\nDick.\r\n\r\n"Indeed there are. It is very important, too, that ships know the\r\ncorrect time to prevent disasters. There are shore stations whose sole\r\nduty it is to supply to ships the time and their location. Don\'t you\r\nrecall my mentioning such coastal stations?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; I guess I do remember now," returned Dick, a trifle\r\nconfused.\r\n\r\n"What happens if you call a station and nobody answers?" interrogated\r\nNancy. "I have been meaning to ask. Do you just keep on calling as you\r\ndo at the telephone?"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed," was the instant reply. "Should you do that you would\r\ncause no end of interference and make yourself a nuisance to\r\neverybody. The rule is that after you have called a station three\r\ntimes at two-minute intervals you must stop for a quarter of an hour\r\nbefore you call again. If you happened to be calling a fleet of ships\r\nit is desirable to alter your tune rather than keep repeating the\r\nsummons in the same key. It saves time. Merchant ships and coast\r\nstations must, however, be called in the wave length definitely\r\nspecified for their use."\r\n\r\n"Shipboard stations seem to have more rules than the others,"\r\ncommented Dick.\r\n\r\n"Not more rules but different ones," Bob said. "You see their nearness\r\nto other ships makes this imperative. Each ship has to take care not\r\nto knock out the apparatus of its neighbor by inconsiderate use of a\r\nhigh-power current; also it must not cause undue interference. In\r\nother words, a bevy of ships, like a group of persons, must be\r\ncourteous to one another. If a ship within a ten-mile radius of\r\nanother is receiving signals that are so faint that they are difficult\r\nto distinguish, a neighboring vessel should not complicate matters by\r\ntrying to transmit a message until the other ship has received what\r\nwas coming in. This rule makes for ordinary politeness, that is all."\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t the ship waiting to talk send a message in a different wave\r\nlength?" inquired Dick.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes; that would be quite possible, if the tune varied enough to\r\nmake it perfectly distinct."\r\n\r\n"But what about high-power stations?" demanded Walter. "They handle\r\nimportant stuff and of course cannot keep stopping for other people\r\nto talk. Don\'t their powerful currents damage the receiving sets in\r\nstations near them? I should think they might even injure their own."\r\n\r\n"High-power, or long-distance stations have still another problem to\r\nmeet and they meet it in a different way," responded Bob. "In order\r\nthat the currents they are obliged to use shall not destroy detectors\r\nand other delicate receiving apparatus they carry on what are known as\r\nduplex operations. That is, the receiving station is constructed at\r\nsome distance from the sending station--often several miles away--and\r\nthe two parts of the service are performed independently by different\r\nantenn\xc3\xa6. In this way sending and receiving can be carried on at the\r\nsame time in slightly varying wave lengths."\r\n\r\n"But how can they talk and act as one station if they are so far\r\napart?" questioned His Highness much puzzled.\r\n\r\n"It is not as impossible as it seems. The operator at the sending\r\nstation has a small sending key connected by electricity with a relay\r\nat the receiving station. By means of a lever and certain complex\r\nparaphernalia this key can be used as the sending key for the main\r\napparatus. Thus the station operated by distant control carries on a\r\nduplex system of transmission so that both sending and receiving\r\nstations are kept in touch with one another."\r\n\r\n"That is clever!" interrupted Mr. Crowninshield.\r\n\r\n"A high-power station has to be ingeniously equipped," responded Bob,\r\n"for it does a great deal of business, rapid business and business\r\nthat is important. In some stations so fast do the messages come in\r\nand so long are they that an automatic tape not unlike that seen at\r\nthe stock exchange is used to make perforated records of the dots and\r\ndashes. Later this punctured slip can be run through a Morse writer\r\nand the message taken down at leisure by the operator. Or sometimes\r\nphotographic or phonographic records are resorted to and these like\r\nthe others can be reproduced at a slower rate of speed and interpreted\r\nby the operator."\r\n\r\n"I should like that and then I wouldn\'t have to hurry," murmured\r\nNancy.\r\n\r\n"It must be jolly to be an operator in a long-distance station," mused\r\nDick, "where real things are going on."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it is," was Bob\'s nonchalant answer. "I fancy, though, that\r\nvery vital government messages go in cipher. Uncle Sam isn\'t risking\r\nhaving his secrets published far and wide over the face of the whole\r\nearth. Although for that matter all radio messages are secret."\r\n\r\n"But how can they be if any and everybody can listen in?"\r\n\r\n"Well, on a high-power wave length probably ordinary persons would not\r\nbe able to listen in. Their apparatus would not be equipped for it.\r\nShould a station be able to, however, during critical periods, such as\r\ntimes of war, the government takes no chances and orders all but\r\ncertain specified stations dismantled. That puts an end to intruders\r\nunless a spy has a hidden wireless somewhere; and if he has he takes\r\nan almighty risk with his neck, that is all I can say," concluded Bob\r\nwith a grin.\r\n\r\n"But operators have tongues and can talk," Mrs. Crowninshield\r\nsuggested. "Don\'t they sometimes?"\r\n\r\n"Usually they do not know what the message passing through their hands\r\nmeans," Bob answered. "But even should they contrive to study it out\r\nthey would not dare repeat it because of the penalty entailed."\r\n\r\n"Penalty?"\r\n\r\nThe young operator nodded.\r\n\r\n"You would not have to concern yourself much about blabbers if you\r\nheard what happens to them," piped Walter, who suddenly found himself\r\non ground which previous instruction had rendered familiar. "It\'s off\r\nwith their heads!"\r\n\r\n"Not really!" gasped the horrified Nancy.\r\n\r\n"Oh, he does not mean literally," the elder brother explained. "But it\r\nis away with their license which is almost as disastrous a fate to a\r\nman who has planned to make his living by wireless. Nor is the loss of\r\nthe license all that happens. In addition one is liable to a\r\ntwo-hundred-and-fifty-dollar fine or three years\' imprisonment."\r\n\r\n"Jove! They do come down on you!" Dick averred.\r\n\r\n"Ra-_ther_! You know, of course, that if you violate any clause of\r\nyour radio agreement you may be fined one hundred dollars; and should\r\nan operator fake a distress call the fine is twenty-five hundred\r\ndollars, or five years in prison and perhaps both. Even the smallest\r\nfine one can get off with for such an offense is two years behind the\r\nbars. It makes you think twice before playing that little joke. The\r\ngovernment is wise, too, to spread it on thick, for to fake an S O S\r\nwhich is given the right of way over every other signal would be a\r\ncontemptible trick. Mild punishments like fines and imprisonments\r\nwould be too good for the wretch who would so deliberately mislead\r\npeople. Moreover a few such offenses would cause the importance of the\r\ncall to be discredited so that in time nobody would be in a rush to\r\npay attention to it."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t realize an S O S so invariably had the right of way,"\r\nmeditated Dick. "Of course I knew it was the distress signal at sea."\r\n\r\n"S O S in the International Morse Code is the universal distress call\r\nadopted by the common consent of our civilized nations at the wireless\r\nconvention held at Berlin in 1906. Every radio station ashore or\r\nafloat is obliged to give it first place and do everything possible to\r\nfurther its demands. When a distress call is heard all ships and\r\nstations everywhere that hear it are in honor bound to stop whatever\r\nthey may be doing and listen; nor must they try to talk with the ship\r\nherself unless she asks them to. Instead, after she has sent out her\r\ncall for attention, which is equivalent to our _Hello_ of the\r\ntelephone, she gives her name; the name of the station or ship she\r\nwishes to talk with; states what the matter is; and defines as nearly\r\nas she is able her position. This done she sends out a general call\r\nand if the station or ship she has asked aid from has not caught the\r\nsignal and fails to answer her, any operator within hearing may do so.\r\nThe instant he begins to talk with her, however, all the others\r\nlistening in must remain silent. At last, when the message is\r\ndelivered or the necessary conversation at an end, then the ship\'s\r\nradio man sends out a broadcast to let everybody know that he has\r\nfinished so that all stations may resume their regular routine."\r\n\r\n"Some system!" breathed Dick.\r\n\r\n"I guess you would think there was some system if you were to see a\r\nbook of radio rules," returned Bob. "I\'ll show you mine some day. All\r\nthe various shore stations have their many regulations, as I have told\r\nyou before; shipboard stations have theirs; and even the amateurs are\r\nprotected so that every class may get fair play and not bother his\r\nneighbor. Wireless stations, you see, are not mere toys. They have\r\nwork to do and must be able to do it unhampered."\r\n\r\n"I\'d like a glimpse of that manual," suggested Dick.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll bring it round to-morrow," Bob answered, glancing at his watch\r\nand rising.\r\n\r\nThe others rose too.\r\n\r\n"I suppose it would be no use to listen in for O\'Connel again,"\r\nremarked Mr. Crowninshield.\r\n\r\n"I will if you like," Bob responded. "I doubt, though, if it would do\r\nany good."\r\n\r\n"No, I guess it wouldn\'t. We shall just have to wait," sighed the\r\nman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE NET TIGHTENS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen on the morrow no call of any kind came from O\'Connel Mr.\r\nCrowninshield was, as his son expressed it, "fit to be tied."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t see why we do not hear something to-day," fumed he. "He can\'t\r\nexpect us to _wait developments_ forever. Are you sure you did not\r\nmiss the signal, Bob."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see how I could have missed it," replied the operator\r\npatiently.\r\n\r\n"But he always does call, doesn\'t he?"\r\n\r\n"He has for the last few days."\r\n\r\n"Then why not to-day?"\r\n\r\n"I cannot imagine. Perhaps he couldn\'t."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t suppose anything has happened to Lola, do you?"\r\n\r\n"Who can tell?"\r\n\r\n"You are right; it was a foolish question," admitted the financier,\r\naccepting the rebuke gracefully. "Still, I cannot help being anxious\r\nand wondering."\r\n\r\n"Of course not."\r\n\r\n"If only that miserable inspector would turn up and you could get your\r\nlicense! It is absurd that you cannot send a message, a man of your\r\nexperience!"\r\n\r\n"I am as sorry about the delay as you are," Bob answered. "Perhaps I\r\nam more so. Nevertheless I am not going to break the rules. Besides,\r\nwere we to call O\'Connel, it might arouse suspicion and get him into\r\ntrouble. It is far better to leave the calling to him."\r\n\r\n"But he hasn\'t called."\r\n\r\n"Then there is some good reason, I\'ll be bound. He knows what he is\r\nabout when he says to await developments."\r\n\r\n"Maybe he does," sighed the elder man. "However, I am not much used to\r\nwaiting. When I want a thing done, I want it done."\r\n\r\nBob smiled at the characteristic remark.\r\n\r\n"You cannot whisk everything off like that," observed he. "Sometimes\r\nit is necessary----"\r\n\r\n"To wait? Yes, I suppose so," put in Mr. Crowninshield. "Well, I will\r\nhold my horses for one more day. But I warn you to-morrow I shall do\r\nsomething. I can\'t be hanging around like this--not knowing anything\r\nor hearing anything."\r\n\r\n"It is hard," Bob returned sympathetically.\r\n\r\n"It is hard for one born in New York and accustomed to seeing things\r\nhum," asserted the owner of Surfside with a wry smile. "Well, we must\r\ntry to forget it, that\'s all. Come, get your books and let us go on\r\nwith our radio lesson from the point where we left it yesterday. The\r\nrest of them are waiting and there seems to be nothing better that we\r\ncan do."\r\n\r\nFortunately Bob was not sensitive enough to be hurt by the thrust.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be right along," agreed he, "as soon as I have locked up here."\r\n\r\nOn reaching the veranda he found his class assembled and the first\r\ncomment to reach his ears was:\r\n\r\n"No news from O\'Connel, eh?"\r\n\r\n"No, Dick."\r\n\r\n"What in thunder do you suppose has become of him?"\r\n\r\nBob put his finger to his lips and taking the hint the boy abandoned\r\nthe subject, inquiring instead:\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it a bore to have to listen in at just such a time every day\r\nwhether it is convenient or not--I mean when you are in charge of a\r\nstation."\r\n\r\n"Sometimes it is," Bob responded. "Still, it is your job and you\r\nexpect to put it first and fit your own affairs in around it. Besides,\r\nyou get used to the regularity of the hours and soon do not notice the\r\nmonotony of the rules. You can readily understand why, at all official\r\nradio stations, somebody must always be on the watch for S O S calls.\r\nOn shipboard there are three classes of wireless stations: those\r\nhaving continual service with an operator who always has his ear to\r\nthe receiver while the ship is in motion; those where the office is\r\nopen only at stated hours and an operator listening merely for a\r\nlimited time; and those whose operators have no fixed time beyond\r\nlistening in the first ten minutes of each hour."\r\n\r\n"The ship decides which kind of station it will have, I suppose,"\r\nNancy remarked.\r\n\r\n"Indeed it doesn\'t," Bob contradicted, with a shake of his head. "The\r\ngovernment saves the vessel that trouble. It defines exactly the sort\r\nof station when it issues the license. Uncle Sam also bestows on each\r\nof these stations a name or combination of letters by which it shall\r\nbe known and under which it is officially listed. Each country has a\r\nprescribed number of such letters allotted for its use at the\r\nInternational Convention at Berne, and our nation is authorized to use\r\ngroups beginning with N and W; also triple groups of KIA to KZZ. You\r\nwill find all these call letters in a book that contains the wireless\r\ntelegraph stations of the world, a volume issued by the international\r\npublication office at Berne."\r\n\r\n"Can any one get one?" inquired Walter.\r\n\r\n"Certainly, if he has the price," smiled the older brother. "I guess\r\nyou do not need one, though. A local call book would answer most\r\npurposes. It would hardly be necessary for you to call any foreign\r\noffices, and I even doubt if you would need to summon Sayville,\r\nTuckerton, New Brunswick, Marion, or Annapolis."\r\n\r\n"Those are our trans-Atlantic stations, aren\'t they?" asked Dick.\r\n\r\n"Some of them," Bob said. "We have others, though, that can talk with\r\nEurope. There is one at San Diego; Pearl Harbor in Hawaii; and Cavite\r\nin the Philippines. There are also Marconi stations at Kahuka and\r\nBolinas. In addition to these, the government has a number of\r\nhigh-power stations scattered throughout the country. Arlington,\r\nVirginia----"\r\n\r\n"Sends out the time," put in Walter with disconcerting promptness.\r\n\r\n"It sure does, sonny."\r\n\r\n"How many foreign countries can talk with us?" inquired Nancy.\r\n\r\n"A short time ago there were eight that could talk direct. One is at\r\nFunabashi, Japan; one at Carnarvon, Wales; two in France, one at\r\nNantes and one at Lyons; Rome, Italy, has one; Germany has one at\r\nNauen and one at Eilvese, Hanover; and Norway has one at Stavanger.\r\nThen in Canada there are two transatlantic stations."\r\n\r\n"Glace Bay!" piped the incorrigible Walter.\r\n\r\nBob patted his head with a mock fatherly gesture.\r\n\r\n"Very good, son," said he, at which everybody laughed.\r\n\r\n"These stations," he went on, "are all equipped with very high power,\r\nvarying in wave length anywhere from 17,600 to 6,000 meters. Most of\r\nour stations are pretty powerful, anyway. Pearl Harbor, for instance,\r\nhas a 13,000 wave length; Cavite 12,000; Sayville, 11,600; Tuckerton,\r\nowned by a French company, about 8,700; New Brunswick, New Jersey,\r\n13,600; Marion, Massachusetts, 14,400; and Annapolis, 17,600. Only a\r\nfew foreign stations can match these in range. Carnarvon has two wave\r\nlengths: 14,000 and 11,500; Lyons, 15,500; Nantes, 10,000; Rome,\r\n11,500; Nauen, 12,550; Eilvese (Hanover), 15,000 and 9,600; and\r\nStavanger, Norway, 9,600. There are many, however, that vary from\r\n7,000 to 4,000 and can transmit messages by relaying them."\r\n\r\n"I wish my set could send farther," Dick murmured regretfully.\r\n\r\n"It sends as far as the law allows. We must therefore abide by Uncle\r\nSam\'s judgment and be content. The scale is very carefully planned and\r\nthe classifications made most intelligently, I think. Amateurs are\r\nlimited to about a 200-meter wave length; low-power stations come next\r\nand are grouped under 1,600 meters. Of these the 750 wave is reserved\r\nfor government stations such as radio compass stations, etc.; 600\r\nmeters is the commercial tune for large merchant ships; 476 that of\r\nsubmarines, aircraft, and small war vessels; and 300 meters is the\r\ncommercial tune for small vessels. After that we pass into the higher\r\ngroup, all of which come under the head of medium-power stations.\r\nThese range from 4,000 to 1,800 meters and first on the list are the\r\ngovernment ships which have continuous waves and a length of from\r\n3,000 to 4,000 meters. Following them come the experimental and\r\nmiscellaneous stations with a 3,000 to 2,000-meter range; and after\r\nthem the 1,800-meter class which is the commercial tune for continuous\r\nwaves."\r\n\r\n"And the high-power stations are the last, I suppose," put in Dick.\r\n\r\n"Yes, those designed for trans-oceanic service. These range from\r\n20,000 to 6,000 meters. The distinctions are, you see, quite\r\npositively made and everybody must keep within his assigned\r\npigeon-hole."\r\n\r\n"I reckon I\'ll keep in mine," announced Dick.\r\n\r\n"I should advise it if you want smooth sailing," retorted Bob. "You\r\nwill hardly----" but the sentence was never finished for a maid\r\napproached Mr. Crowninshield at the moment and whispered:\r\n\r\n"The telephone, sir; New York is speaking."\r\n\r\n"New York, Dad!" exclaimed Dick excitedly. "It may be Lyman or Dacie."\r\n\r\n"More likely it is the office," replied his mother.\r\n\r\n"Some business matter, I fancy," said Mr. Crowninshield as he rose.\r\n"I\'m sorry to interrupt the lesson."\r\n\r\n"I was just about through, sir."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be back in a moment probably."\r\n\r\n"Poor father always has telephone calls," lamented Nancy\r\nsympathetically. "If he ever starts out to play golf somebody is sure\r\nto want him. Sometimes I wish that New York office was in the bottom\r\nof the sea."\r\n\r\n"I guess you\'d have precious little bread and butter if it was,"\r\nannounced Dick with brotherly sarcasm.\r\n\r\n"Certainly you wouldn\'t be able to provide me with any," Nancy flashed\r\nback with a teasing laugh.\r\n\r\n"Children!" interposed Mrs. Crowninshield.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s Dad! Well, Pater, what was it?" asked Dick. Then on observing\r\nhis father was unwontedly excited he repeated, "What\'s up, Dad?"\r\n\r\n"It was Lyman," Mr. Crowninshield answered. "The New York police have\r\nrun down two men and Mr. Lyman wants Bob to come over and see if he\r\ncan identify either of them as the one who kidnapped Lola."\r\n\r\n"You could identify him, couldn\'t you, Bob?" Walter put in.\r\n\r\n"Of course I could. Didn\'t the chap come into the station to get water\r\nfor his machine?" was the instant reply. "I talked with him quite a\r\nbit while he was fixing up his engine. He seemed in a powerful rush to\r\nbe off and wasn\'t overgracious."\r\n\r\n"But could Bob leave now, Archibald?" questioned his wife. "Isn\'t\r\nthere the possibility of news from Mr. O\'Connel?"\r\n\r\n"Jove! I had forgotten that."\r\n\r\n"Maybe O\'Connel won\'t call; he didn\'t to-day, you know," Nancy said.\r\n\r\n"It seems to me Bob ought to go and land those chaps if there is a\r\nchance of doing it," Dick declared. "He would not need to be gone more\r\nthan one night, would he?"\r\n\r\n"No. Nevertheless, he would miss the morning wireless," returned Mr.\r\nCrowninshield. "Should there be important news we should not get it."\r\n\r\n"It is a pity you boys can\'t take a message," Nancy remarked, turning\r\ntoward her brother and Walter. "If you only had your Morse code\r\nlearned you might be quite some good to us now."\r\n\r\n"I wish I had whooped up on it faster," bewailed Dick, with engaging\r\ncandor. "I\'m an awful rotter--plain lazy, I guess."\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t know but we\'d better let Bob go, all things\r\nconsidered," observed Mr. Crowninshield, who had been quietly thinking\r\nthe matter over.\r\n\r\n"I say Bob goes, too," reiterated Dick. "It is worth something to put\r\nsuch fellows as those dog thieves behind the bars."\r\n\r\n"You can connect with the Fall River boat or one passing through the\r\nCanal and be in New York in the morning, Bob," the elder man asserted.\r\n"Lyman will meet you, hustle things along, and send you home on the\r\nnoon train. With Dick\'s racing car to pick you up somewhere along the\r\nline there is no reason why we should not have you back here before\r\nanother morning. You\'ve no time to spare, though, for lingering and\r\ndiscussing wireless and its wonders. Trot along and pack up your duds\r\nand get some luncheon. I\'ll call up Wheeler and have him ready to\r\ncarry you to the train. Do not bother your head about connections; I\r\nwill look up everything and tell you exactly what to do."\r\n\r\nIn a flurry of anticipation off hastened Bob.\r\n\r\n"Gee! Isn\'t it the limit that we haven\'t brains enough to get\r\nO\'Connel?" murmured Dick to Walter in a disgusted whisper. "I ought to\r\nhave duffed in harder on the blamed code. But I thought there was no\r\nhurry. We seemed to have all summer to learn it."\r\n\r\n"Maybe he won\'t call," His Highness suggested hopefully.\r\n\r\n"I hope to blazes he doesn\'t," was the retort. "I\'d feel cheap as dirt\r\nto have that ticker go clicking out a message and I not be able to get\r\na word of it."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nWALTER STEPS INTO THE BREACH\r\n\r\n\r\nWith Bob gone and radio lessons suspended the following morning seemed\r\nto both Dick and Walter an unwontedly quiet one. Moreover with a\r\nscorching sun high in the heaven, no breeze, and a dead low tide most\r\nof the activities to which the boys might have resorted were out of\r\nthe question.\r\n\r\n"Think of the sailing breeze we\'ve seen blowing lots of mornings when\r\nwe couldn\'t go out," grumbled Dick. "Isn\'t it infernal luck?"\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you take your car and go for a spin," Nancy suggested.\r\n\r\n"Wheeler has it, silly. He\'s meeting Bob."\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t go motoring anyway," put in Walter. "I\'ve got the dogs to\r\nchase round."\r\n\r\n"You\'re not going out with them now," objected Dick.\r\n\r\n"Not quite yet. I had them out before breakfast."\r\n\r\n"What do you say we go over and fool round with the radio a while?"\r\nDick yawned. "We\'ve nothing better to do."\r\n\r\n"All right. We can at least listen in for a spell. We\'ve got that\r\nfar."\r\n\r\n"You boys better not go getting that wireless all out of order while\r\nBob is away," cautioned Nancy. "He\'d be ripping mad to get home and\r\nfind it out of commission. Father wouldn\'t like it, either."\r\n\r\n"Oh, we\'re not going to hurt the precious radio," sniffed Dick. "Don\'t\r\nyou think we know anything?"\r\n\r\n"Not much," fluted Nancy as she flounced away.\r\n\r\n"At least she does not flatter us," grinned His Highness, quite\r\nunruffled by the girl\'s frankness.\r\n\r\n"Oh, sisters never think a fellow knows anything, especially when\r\nthey\'re older," Dick grumbled, as he unlocked the door of the low\r\nbuilding and met the blast of close, stifling air that came out.\r\n"Scott! The place is like an oven, isn\'t it? Open a window, can\'t\r\nyou?" he continued.\r\n\r\n"Sure! There is some heat, I\'ll say. Just as well we dropped round if\r\nonly to air the place out," Walter replied.\r\n\r\nTogether they switched on the current, regulated amplifier, detector,\r\nand tuner, and each with a head receiver tight to his ears sat down.\r\n\r\n"Whee, but it is thick, to-day!" shouted Dick. "Run the tune up, kid,\r\nand see if we get anything."\r\n\r\n"It is always bad a day like this," called Walter. "Besides, everybody\r\nseems to be butting in in the morning. Infernal, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Let her go up to O\'Connel\'s pitch. It can\'t do any harm."\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t time for him to call, is it?"\r\n\r\n"Pretty near."\r\n\r\n"But what good would it do even if we did get his signal?"\r\n\r\n"We should at least know he had something to say to us."\r\n\r\n"I should consider that a negative satisfaction," Walter replied. "It\r\nwould just be an aggravation. However, here she goes! As you say, it\r\ncan harm nobody to get the right meter."\r\n\r\n"There\'s that old commercial station up the Cape," announced Dick,\r\npresently. "That fellow is always on the job at this hour."\r\n\r\n"Probably he has to be, poor soul," Walter returned. "We\'ll get rid of\r\nhim in a minute. _What was that?_"\r\n\r\n"It is some one on our line. That\'s the _Siren\'s_ call. It\'s O\'Connel!\r\nJove! What are you doing, man? What are you going to do?" asked Dick\r\nexcitedly as he saw Walter\'s hand go out.\r\n\r\n"Paper! Pencil! Hurry, can\'t you?" gasped Walter.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean----"\r\n\r\n"Let\'s both take it down in dots and dashes. Between us we may be able\r\nto make some sense out of it afterward. Quick!"\r\n\r\nClearly and evenly the message ticked itself off. Then there was\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n"Get any of it?" Walter demanded, breathlessly tossing the receiver\r\naside and shutting off the current.\r\n\r\n"About two words. He went so fast----Did you get anything?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'ve got something; but whether it will make any sense remains to\r\nbe seen," said His Highness eagerly. "Where is the key! Toss it\r\nover."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Clearly and evenly the message ticked itself off. Then\r\nthere was silence. _Page_ 240.]\r\n\r\n"Here we go. Dot, dash,----"\r\n\r\n"That\'s the letter A, you squarehead! I know what that first part is;\r\nit is always the same and we needn\'t fuss to translate it. _Aboard\r\nyacht Siren._ I don\'t care, either, where she is. What we want to get\r\nat is what she wants to say."\r\n\r\n"But how can we tell where all that stuff leaves off?"\r\n\r\n"I mean to tell," declared Walter with determination.\r\n\r\n"But there is punctuation and other rubbish mixed in with the\r\nletters."\r\n\r\n"No matter. Have a little patience, man!"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, in spite of all the patience and perseverance the boys\r\ncould muster the magic message remained an enigma and at the end of an\r\nhour both were obliged to admit themselves beaten.\r\n\r\n"It is worse than getting no message at all," lamented Walter.\r\n\r\n"It certainly does not do us much good," assented Dick.\r\n\r\n"Do you suppose your father knows anything about the Morse code?"\r\n\r\n"Dad? Good heavens, no! Still we might take the thing up to the house\r\nand show it to him."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t imagine it is right, do you?" speculated Walter. "No doubt we\r\nmissed some of it or made mistakes. Still, what we contrived to write\r\nagrees fairly well, so some of it must be correct. Let\'s take it to\r\nyour father. What do you say?"\r\n\r\n"I feel like such a boob not to be able to make it out," Dick\r\nanswered with evident reluctance at confessing himself floored.\r\n\r\n"But we\'ll have to tell him O\'Connel called. We\'ve got to do that\r\nanyhow; so he may as well know the rest of it," Walter persisted.\r\n\r\n"All right. We\'ll hunt him up. I warn you, though, that he will josh\r\nus most unmercifully. He\'ll pitch into me, too, and ask me why I\r\nhaven\'t learned my Morse International before this. See if he\r\ndoesn\'t."\r\n\r\n"It is one thing to learn the code out of a book and quite another to\r\nbe smart enough to read it or take it down," Walter maintained\r\nstoutly. "Nobody ought to expect you to be able to get a message the\r\nway Bob does. Why, he has been at the job years!"\r\n\r\n"I know he has," Dick responded, slightly comforted. "Still, Dad will\r\nrag me, just the same. See if he doesn\'t!"\r\n\r\nLocking the door and pausing to gain courage they set out over the\r\nlawn. Then suddenly, midway across the grass, His Highness came to a\r\nstop.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Burns!" he cried, wheeling round. "Why didn\'t I think of him\r\nbefore?"\r\n\r\n"What on earth are you talking about?" asked Dick, astounded by his\r\ncompanion\'s strange conduct.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Burns!" repeated Walter. "Come along. Can\'t one of the chauffeurs\r\ntake us down there?"\r\n\r\n"For mercy\'s sake who is Mr. Burns, and why do you want to go and see\r\nhim hot off the bat?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Burns, the telegraph operator," Walter contrived to stammer. "He\r\nmust know Morse International. He has to know both the Morse American\r\nwhich telegraph operators use on land, and the other code, I\'m pretty\r\nsure."\r\n\r\n"But maybe what we\'ve got down doesn\'t make sense," objected Dick.\r\n"You\'ve a husky nerve to go toting that scrawl of ours to a\r\nprofessional."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care," grinned Walter. "I\'m not afraid of Mr. Burns. He\'s\r\ndriven me out of the station too many times when I was a kid. I will\r\nown, however, that I have more respect for him since I\'ve learned what\r\nit means to run a telegraph."\r\n\r\n"He may drive you out of the station this time," Dick ventured with a\r\ngrimace.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll bet he won\'t," was the sanguine response. "We\'ve made it up\r\nsince then. I\'ve even helped old Burnsie shovel his snow now and then.\r\nHe\'ll do a good turn for me, I\'ll bet."\r\n\r\n"Come on then, if you are so sure of it," Dick answered, striding\r\ntoward the garage.\r\n\r\n"You\'re sure your father won\'t mind our taking the car?"\r\n\r\n"He doesn\'t want it this morning. He is going to hang round and see if\r\nBob calls him from New York. Besides, he said it was too hot to motor.\r\nWill Burns be at the station now?"\r\n\r\n"He will if a train is due," announced Walter. "If the office is\r\nlocked we can chase him to his house."\r\n\r\n"All right! This is your party, remember," Dick said a trifle\r\nwickedly. It was evident he had no faith in the expedition.\r\nNotwithstanding his skepticisms, however, he ordered out the car and\r\nhe and Walter sped away on their errand.\r\n\r\n"It is time for a train," announced Walter in an undertone, as they\r\nneared the station. "See, there are people waiting. It is the noon\r\ntrain from Boston."\r\n\r\n"Burns will be too busy then to bother his head over fake messages, I\r\nguess," sniffed Dick.\r\n\r\n"Maybe not. At least we can try him," was His Highness\'s optimistic\r\nassertion. "Hi, Mr. Burns!" The lad was out of the car and hastening\r\nalong in the wake of a much sunburned station agent in blue denim\r\noveralls.\r\n\r\n"Wal, if it ain\'t Walter King! What you after, young one? I hear\r\nyou\'ve become the proprietor of Surfside--bought out the whole darn\r\nplace for yourself."\r\n\r\n"I did buy it but I\'m going to sell it again. It\'s too small. I can\'t\r\nget room enough to stretch up there," came impishly from the lad on\r\nthe platform.\r\n\r\n"Show! You don\'t say!" drawled Mr. Burns with obvious relish of the\r\njoke. "Well, it ain\'t wise to be cramped. Maybe you wouldn\'t get your\r\ngrowth if you were."\r\n\r\nHe cast a glance toward the short, thick-set figure behind him.\r\n\r\n"I say, Mr. Burns," burst out Walter, "are you terribly busy? I\'ve got\r\nsomething I want to show you."\r\n\r\n"What is it?" demanded the man, halting and holding suspended in his\r\nhand a cerulean blue egg case.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what it is--that\'s just the trouble," answered Walter\r\nmysteriously.\r\n\r\n"What you up to anyhow?" demanded Mr. Burns suspiciously.\r\n\r\nWalter thrust forth the sheet of paper he had drawn from his pocket.\r\n\r\nIn his rough, grimy hand the telegraph operator took it.\r\n\r\n"Where did you get this?" demanded he, glancing sharply over the top\r\nof his spectacles.\r\n\r\n"Why, we have a wireless up at Surfside and this thing--or something\r\nlike it that we didn\'t know enough to write down, came this morning."\r\n\r\n"But I heard your brother Bob was up there."\r\n\r\n"He had to go to New York yesterday."\r\n\r\n"And left you to tend the tape, did he?" grinned the old man.\r\n\r\n"Not much. He knows I\'d be a duffer at the job," affirmed Walter.\r\n\r\n"Mebbe you ain\'t as much of a duffer as you think. You managed to get\r\nthis down on paper."\r\n\r\n"We managed to together--Dick and I," explained Walter. "I don\'t\r\nsuppose, though, we got it anywhere near straight. Does it make any\r\nsense at all?"\r\n\r\n"Sure it makes sense!" announced Mr. Burns with a vim that quite took\r\nWalter\'s breath away. "There\'s queer spots in it here and there--a few\r\nletters that ain\'t needed, perhaps. Still, you can omit \'em since they\r\nserve no particular purpose."\r\n\r\n"But what is the message? What does it say?" clamored Walter all\r\nimpatience.\r\n\r\n"Well, it ain\'t so thrillin\' you need to go into a thousand pieces\r\nover it," commented the Cape Codder dryly. "Some friend of Mr.\r\nCrowninshield\'s \'pears to be comin\' down here on the afternoon train\r\nbringin\' with him his wife--either his wife or daughter."\r\n\r\n"What!" Walter ejaculated weakly.\r\n\r\n"That\'s what he says," continued Mr. Burns, calmly rereading the\r\ndocument he held. "Evidently some relation--or at least a person who\r\nfeels he has the right to boss, for he says he wants to be met at the\r\ntrain."\r\n\r\n"Did I get the name?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, that\'s here. I may\'s well read you the whole thing with the\r\nexception of the extra touches you\'ve added."\r\n\r\n"I wish to goodness you would."\r\n\r\n"\'Tain\'t nothin\' interestin\', as I said before," insisted Mr. Burns,\r\nreadjusting his spectacles. "\'_Coming on afternoon train and bringing\r\nLola. Meet me, O\'Con_----\' Where in thunder you goin?" The operator\r\ngazed in amazement as a pair of chubby legs vanished up the platform.\r\n\r\n"That\'s all right, Mr. Burns! I don\'t want the paper back. You can\r\nkeep it to remember me by. Thanks!" Then to Dick he shouted as he\r\nsprang into the car:\r\n\r\n"We\'re off for home fast as we can make it, old man! Such news! Your\r\nfather will be crazy! Whee! Hurrah!"\r\n\r\n"If it is all the same to you," observed Dick with scorching sarcasm,\r\n"it would be pleasant to know the import of the message I took down."\r\n\r\n"_You_ took down--well I like that! _You_ took down! Why, man, you\r\ncould not even read it yourself! It is the message _I_ took down, my\r\nson."\r\n\r\n"_We_ took down," corrected Dick.\r\n\r\nThey both laughed.\r\n\r\n"O\'Connel\'s coming this afternoon! What do you say to that?"\r\n\r\n"Great Scott! But what----"\r\n\r\n"He\'s bringing his wife or daughter," continued Walter with a wicked\r\ntwinkle in his eye.\r\n\r\n"What?" exclaimed his bewildered listener.\r\n\r\n"Oh, this is rich! Rich!" continued His Highness with a paroxysm of\r\nlaughter. "Wait until we tell your father! My soul and body! I\'m sick\r\nlaughing!"\r\n\r\n"You might tell me the joke."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t--I can\'t!" roared the boy. "It is too good!"\r\n\r\n"And--and what about Lola?" stammered Dick.\r\n\r\n"Why, you see Burns thought--my, but it\'s rich! Ha, ha! Burns\r\nunderstood that--oh, it\'s a scream!" and with that Dick was forced to\r\nbe content.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nTHE RETURN OF THE WANDERERS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Walter and Dick returned to Surfside with their tidings Mr.\r\nCrowninshield\'s satisfaction and delight could hardly be expressed.\r\nHow he laughed at Burns\'s interpretation of O\'Connel\'s message! And\r\nhow Dick laughed when at last the joke was imparted to him!\r\n\r\n"Well, you two boys have been almighty clever between you," commented\r\nthe elder man. "I would not have credited either of you with so many\r\nbrains. To think of your getting that radio call! It is marvelous. And\r\nthen to take it to Burns! That was a master stroke. The idea would\r\nnever have entered my head. But what puzzles me is the message itself.\r\nDo you suppose O\'Connel has kidnapped Lola; or how has he got\r\npossession of her? And how has he contrived to escape from the yacht\r\nwithout being held up? I don\'t understand it at all. It isn\'t likely\r\nDaly has let him walk off unmolested with the dog. The thing is more\r\nthan I can fathom."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps Mr. Daly has relented and is sending Lola back," suggested\r\nWalter.\r\n\r\n"Not on your life, youngster! You don\'t know Daly," was the instant\r\nreply. "He would never admit himself beaten and give up that pup.\r\nMoreover the affair has cost him too much money, risk and trouble for\r\nhim to abandon his scheme. If he wanted Lola bad enough to hire\r\nsomebody to steal her he still wants her, mark my word! No, there is\r\nsomething behind all this that we haven\'t reached. O\'Connel has made\r\noff with the dog somehow. Just how I am at a loss to tell. We shall\r\nhave to wait until he himself comes and enlightens us."\r\n\r\n"Anything heard from Bob?" questioned Walter.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'ve had a wire. They\'ve got the men they were after all right\r\nand he will be back to-night."\r\n\r\n"What did he say about it?" asked Dick eagerly.\r\n\r\n"Nothing. You cannot tell an entire story in a telegram, you know. But\r\nhe has accomplished what he went for. I fancy he always does," added\r\nthe master of the estate with a smile.\r\n\r\n"Generally, sir," nodded Walter proudly.\r\n\r\nMr. Crowninshield took a turn or two across the room.\r\n\r\n"I mean to keep Bob with us this winter if I can prevail upon him to\r\nstay," remarked the financier presently. "He is too able a chap to\r\nlose sight of. I can find a big paying berth for him in New York and\r\nif he will take it, your mother won\'t have to worry any further about\r\nmoney affairs. And if you, sonny, make good and do as well as your\r\nbrother"--he patted Walter\'s shoulder, "I\'ll do the same for you some\r\nday. You have done well this summer. Finish up your school work and\r\nthen we\'ll see."\r\n\r\n"You are very kind, Mr. Crowninshield," the boy stammered.\r\n\r\n"Not a bit. We all ought to give the chap who is willing to climb a\r\nhand up the ladder. What are we in the world for?"\r\n\r\n"I know my mother will be----"\r\n\r\n"There, there!" interrupted the great man. "Your mother has two fine\r\nsons that she may well be proud of. She has had a little hard sledding\r\nto get them on their feet, that\'s all. Now it is their turn to lift\r\nthe burden and repay her. I am simply going to see that they get the\r\nchance to do it. The rest I feel certain I can leave to them."\r\n\r\n"We do want to help mother," Walter replied with sincerity.\r\n\r\n"I know you do; both of you have proved it this summer. From now on I\r\nintend your mother shall have no anxiety about her finances. We\'ll put\r\nher where she will be perfectly independent of those uncles of yours,\r\nand of summer boarders as well."\r\n\r\nThe lip of His Highness trembled and he could not speak.\r\n\r\n"Some day I expect Dick and Nancy will be looking out for their mother\r\nand me just this way," continued Mr. Crowninshield half humorously.\r\n"There will be Lola to support, too."\r\n\r\nDick burst into a peal of laughter.\r\n\r\n"You will have to cut out indulging in so many detectives if I\'m to\r\npay the bills, Dad," answered he.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you must not deprive me of my little luxuries," returned his\r\nfather. "One must have some amusement, remember."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid you will have to choose a cheaper one then."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll think it over. If, however, I discover you cannot maintain me\r\nand my trifling pleasures I may abandon you and turn to Walter to\r\nsupport me in my old age."\r\n\r\nLighting a cigar he strolled away.\r\n\r\nThe boys ambled toward the boathouse. There was still three hours\r\nbefore the Boston train, bringing O\'Connel, would arrive. In the\r\nmeantime they indulged in a swim; took the dogs for a run; had\r\nluncheon; paddled round the bay in Dick\'s canoe; and did everything\r\nthey could think of to hurry the moments along.\r\n\r\nAnd when the car bearing Mr. Crowninshield and O\'Connel did actually\r\nroll into the drive what a state of excitement they were in!\r\n\r\nYes, there was Lola--there was no contesting that! She was a weak,\r\nwretched little dog but it was she.\r\n\r\n"However did you manage it, Mr. O\'Connel?" cried Mrs. Crowninshield\r\nwho had come racing down the steps and gathered her favorite into her\r\narms.\r\n\r\nBreathlessly the group clustered about the wee puppy.\r\n\r\n"Well, the first thing I did was to convince myself the dog aboard\r\nthe yacht was really the one we were after. One day when the party\r\nwent ashore I hunted up the supposed Trixie and called her by her real\r\nname. You should have seen her prick up her ears, poor little mite! I\r\nhad her licking my hand inside a minute. From that instant I began to\r\nscheme. I found I couldn\'t send you many radio calls because they\r\nwatched me too closely. I think the mate suspected something--just\r\nwhat, I could not make out, for I don\'t think he was in the secret of\r\nthe dog\'s capture. Anyway, I decided to steer clear of the wireless\r\nand trust to luck. At last my chance came. Some equipment was needed\r\nand it was decided I was to be put ashore and get it. By this time\r\nLola, who for the last few days had refused to eat, had begun to show\r\ndecidedly alarming symptoms. I diagnosed the case as plain\r\nhomesickness and privately resolved to get her off the yacht if it was\r\na possible thing; but Mr. Daly thought she had distemper or something\r\nand was mightily cut up. He didn\'t want the animal to die on his hands\r\nafter all he had gone through to get her. Altogether he began to be\r\npretty uneasy and you may be sure I did my part to make him so. Every\r\nchance I got I would remark how sick his dog seemed. Of course I\r\nwasn\'t supposed to know it wasn\'t one he had had for years. I kept\r\nharping on the puppie\'s health until I had him fussed to death. At\r\nlast he said: \'I don\'t know but what you are right about Trixie,\r\nO\'Connel. If they are going to put you ashore at Boston to buy\r\nsupplies, why wouldn\'t it be a good plan for you to take the dog to\r\nthe animal hospital there? You could leave her and later we could go\r\nback and get her. She does seem ailing, and I haven\'t the ghost of an\r\nidea what to do with a sick dog. Besides, she is a nuisance on the\r\nyacht if she must be catered to all the time.\' Well, as you can\r\nimagine, I jumped at the chance although I took every pains not to let\r\nhim suspect I did. I told him that of course if he wanted me to take\r\nthe dog I should be glad to do it. I liked animals and also I wished\r\nto accommodate him. There was no denying, however, that to carry Lola\r\nwith me would delay me in town. Still, if he desired it I would do my\r\nbest to see that she was taken _where she would get well_."\r\n\r\nThe big fellow paused and laughed heartily.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve kept that promise, too," grinned he. "I have sent a note back to\r\nthe _Siren_ recalling the phrase to Mr. Daly, and telling him that\r\nhaving decided Lola would recover more completely if placed under the\r\nprotection of her rightful owners I was taking her back there."\r\n\r\n"I\'d like to see his face when he gets that letter!" said Mr.\r\nCrowninshield, rubbing his hands.\r\n\r\n"So should I," roared O\'Connel, his broad shoulders shaking.\r\n\r\n"But won\'t he----" Mrs. Crowninshield looked anxious.\r\n\r\n"Won\'t he what, my dear?" inquired her husband.\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t you afraid he will be angry and----" she held the wee dog\r\ncloser in her arms.\r\n\r\n"He will be angry all right," agreed O\'Connel. "But you need have no\r\nfears that he will do anything more, ma\'am. He is on too dangerous\r\nground. In the first place he cannot accuse me of appropriating his\r\ndog for I can answer him that it was stolen in the first place. And he\r\ncannot say I deserted his ship for all is fair in love and war, you\r\nknow. No, Daly is a good sport and he will instantly understand that\r\nhe has been beaten. We have been one too many for him, that is all.\r\nMoreover, he won\'t be feeling any too comfortable for he is still\r\nuncertain as to what Mr. Crowninshield may be planning to do with him.\r\nOh, Daly won\'t stir up trouble. You can trust him for that. On the\r\ncontrary he probably will clear out of reach of any possible storm. It\r\nis his only course and he will be canny enough to take it."\r\n\r\n"But you are not going to let him go scott free, are you Dad?"\r\ndemanded Dick.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know. What\'s the use of fighting a skunk like that? We\r\nhave our dog back and Daly must acknowledge that he has been beaten.\r\nThat is about all I want. He won\'t try anything more for I have a\r\nwhiplash over him as he is well aware. Any time I can prosecute him\r\nfor receiving stolen goods and being an accomplice in a robbery. With\r\nthe evidence I have such a case would go overwhelmingly against him\r\nshould it reach the courts. He is not for bringing that issue to a\r\nhead, you may rest assured of that."\r\n\r\n"But you do mean to jail the men who actually took Lola, Father," put\r\nin Nancy. "If you do that, won\'t the whole affair have to be aired and\r\nMr. Daly dragged into the trial?"\r\n\r\nHer father did not answer immediately and before he had framed his\r\nreply wheels were heard and Wheeler, driving Dick\'s racing car, drew\r\nup at the steps.\r\n\r\n"It\'s Bob, as I live!" shouted Walter. "Hello, Bobbie! Hello, old\r\nchap!"\r\n\r\n"Welcome home, Bob!" called Mr. Crowninshield going forward to meet\r\nthe lad.\r\n\r\n"We have a surprise for you, Bob!" called Nancy. "Guess who\'s here?"\r\n\r\n"I can\'t," smiled the wireless man coming up to the piazza and shaking\r\nhands all round. Then his eye lighted on O\'Connel.\r\n\r\n"My word! How did you get here, old top? Fired from your job?"\r\n\r\nFor answer Mrs. Crowninshield held up Lola.\r\n\r\n"The pup herself! Well, well! What\'s been happening in my absence,\r\nanyhow?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t wonder you want to know," cried Nancy above the general\r\nclamor.\r\n\r\n"Hush! Do stop everybody. You are making a far worse noise than ever\r\ncame through that radiophone."\r\n\r\n"First let\'s have Bob\'s story. We haven\'t heard that yet," Mr.\r\nCrowninshield said. "Tell us what happened to you in New York, my\r\nboy."\r\n\r\nBob dropped into a chair.\r\n\r\n"Well, as I wired you, Dacie and Lyman have landed your men. I\r\nrecognized the fellow who came to Seaver Bay for water the instant I\r\nset eyes on him. He recognized me, too, and knew the game was up. It\r\nseems, though, that he and his pal are wanted in California on a prior\r\ncharge. A big burglary, I think it is. Anyway, they have got to be\r\ntaken out there and tried first. In the meantime our complaint can be\r\nlodged against them and----"\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t we to have the fun of jailing them after all?" asked Dick in\r\ndismay.\r\n\r\n"They will be jailed, never fear," returned Bob. "They will get a\r\nstiff sentence, too, I imagine."\r\n\r\nMr. Crowninshield was silent and his wife now glanced toward him.\r\n\r\n"Are you disappointed, Archibald?" inquired she.\r\n\r\n"I guess," responded he slowly, "that is a good way out of our\r\ndilemma. The villains will be carried far away from this vicinity and\r\nwill without doubt get all that\'s coming to them. What more can we\r\nask? We\'ve won the game--taken every trick and made a clean sweep of\r\nthe whole business. Now that I\'ve got Lola home I don\'t much care\r\nabout the rest of it. What do you say we let well enough alone and\r\ndrop it?"\r\n\r\n"I should say that with every day of your life you were growing wiser,\r\nmy dear," answered his wife softly.\r\n\r\n\r\nFINIS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Publisher\'s logo]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_The first volume in "The Invention Series"_\r\n\r\nPAUL AND THE PRINTING PRESS\r\n\r\n_By_ SARA WARE BASSETT\r\n\r\nWith illustrations by A.

You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose\r\nsuch as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and\r\nresearch.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do\r\npractically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is\r\nsubject to the trademark license, especially commercial\r\nredistribution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n*** START: FULL LICENSE ***\r\n\r\nTHE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE\r\nPLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK\r\n\r\nTo protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free\r\ndistribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work\r\n(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project\r\nGutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project\r\nGutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at\r\nhttp://gutenberg.org/license).\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 1.

Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable\r\neffort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread\r\npublic domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\ncollection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain\r\n"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or\r\ncorrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual\r\nproperty infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a\r\ncomputer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by\r\nyour equipment.\r\n\r\n1.F.2.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
