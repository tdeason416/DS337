The moral tone is plain.\r\n"She is kind to the old blind man."\r\n\r\nThe exercises are still suitable, and perhaps more helpful than some\r\ncontemporary alternatives. Much is left to the teacher. Explanations given\r\nin the text are enough to get started teaching a child to read and write.\r\nCounting in Roman numerals is included as a bonus in the form of lesson\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\nThe form of contractions includes a space. The contemporary word "don\'t"\r\nwas rendered as "do n\'t".\r\n\r\nThe author, not listed in the text, is William Holmes McGuffey.\r\n\r\nPassages using non-ASCI characters are approximately rendered in this text\r\nversion. See the PDF or DOC versions for the original images.\r\n\r\nThe section numbers are decimal in the Table of Contents but are in\r\nRoman Numerals in the body.\r\n\r\nPage headings are removed, but section titles are followed by the page on\r\nwhich they appear.\r\n\r\nMany items include a preceding biography of the author. This is ended with\r\nthree pound symbols. ###\r\n\r\nDon Kostuch\r\nend transcriber\'s notes]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Picture of a young woman and a trunk.]\r\n\r\nShe sits, inclining forward as to speak,\r\nHer lips half-open, and her finger up,\r\nAs though she said, "Beware!"\r\n\r\n(Item XCV.

VAIL.\r\n\r\nM\'G REV. 6TH EC.\r\nEP 118\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreface (3)\r\n\r\nIn the SIXTH READER, the general plan of the revision of McGUFFEY\'S SERIES\r\nhas been carefully carried out to completion.\r\n\r\nThat plan has been to retain, throughout, those characteristic features of\r\nMcGUFFEY\'S READERS, which have made the series so popular, and caused\r\ntheir widespread use throughout the schools of the country. At the same\r\ntime, the books have been enlarged; old pieces have been exchanged for new\r\nwherever the advantage was manifest; and several new features have been\r\nincorporated, which it is thought will add largely to the value of the\r\nseries.\r\n\r\nIn the revision of the SIXTH READER, the introductory matter has been\r\nretained with but little change, and it will he found very valuable for\r\nelocutionary drill. In the preparation of this portion of the work, free\r\nuse was made of the writings of standard authors upon Elocution, such as\r\nWalker, McCulloch, Sheridan Knowles, Ewing, Pinnock, Scott, Bell, Graham,\r\nMylins, Wood, Rush, and many others.\r\n\r\nIn making up the Selections for Reading, great care and deliberation have\r\nbeen exercised. The best pieces of the old book are retained in the\r\nREVISED SIXTH, and to the these been added a long list of selections from\r\nthe best English and American literature. Upwards of one hundred leading\r\nauthors are represented (see "Alphabetical List. of Authors," page ix),\r\nand thus a wide range of specimens of the best style has been secured.\r\nClose scrutiny revealed the fact that many popular selections common to\r\nseveral series of Readers, had been largely adapted, but in McGUFFEY\'S\r\nREVISED READERS, wherever it was possible to do so, the selections have\r\nbeen compared, and made to conform strictly with the originals as they\r\nappear in the latest editions authorized by the several writers.\r\n\r\nThe character of the selections, aside from their elocutionary value, has\r\nalso been duly considered. It will be found, upon examination, that they\r\npresent the same instructive merit and healthful moral tone which gave the\r\npreceding edition its high reputation.\r\n\r\nTwo new features of the REVISED SIXTH deserve especial attention--the\r\nexplanatory notes, and the biographical notices of authors. The first, in\r\nthe absence of a large number of books of reference, are absolutely\r\nnecessary, in some cases, for the intelligent reading of the piece; and it\r\nis believed that in all cases they will add largely to the interest and\r\nusefulness of the lessons.\r\n\r\nThe biographical notices, if properly used, are hardly of less value than\r\nthe lessons themselves. They have been carefully prepared, and are\r\nintended not only to add to the interest of the pieces, but to supply\r\ninformation usually obtained only by the separate study of English and\r\nAmerican literature.\r\n\r\nThe illustrations of the REVISED SIXTH READER are presented as specimens\r\nof fine art. They are the work of the best artists and engravers that\r\ncould be secured for the purpose in this country. The names of these\r\ngentlemen may be found on page ten.\r\n\r\nThe publishers would here repeat their acknowledgments to the numerous\r\nfriends and critics who have kindly assisted in the work of revision, and\r\nwould mention particularly President EDWIN C. HEWETT, of the State Normal\r\nUniversity, Normal, Illinois, and the HON. THOMAS W. HARVEY, of\r\nPainesville, Ohio, who have had the revision of the SIXTH READER under\r\ntheir direct advice.\r\n\r\nEspecial acknowledgment is due to Messrs. Houghton, Osgood & Co., for\r\ntheir permission to make liberal selections from their copyright editions\r\nof many of the foremost American authors whose works they publish.\r\nJanuary, 1880.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS (5)\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBJECT.

(11)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe subject of Elocution, so far as it is deemed applicable to a work of\r\nthis kind, will be considered under the following heads, viz:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. ARTICULATION.           4. READING VERSE.\r\n2. INFLECTION.             5. THE VOICE.\r\n3. ACCENT AND EMPHASIS.    6. GESTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI. ARTICULATION. (11)\r\n\r\nArticulation is the utterance of the elementary sounds of a language, and\r\nof their combinations.\r\n\r\nAs words consist of one or more elementary sounds, the first object of the\r\nstudent should he to acquire the power of uttering those sounds with\r\ndistinctness, smoothness, and force. This result can be secured only by\r\ncareful practice, which must be persevered in until the learner has\r\nacquired a perfect control of his organs of speech.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELEMENTARY SOUNDS. (12)\r\n\r\nAn Elementary Sound is a simple, distinct sound made by the organs of\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\nThe Elementary Sounds of the English language are divided into Vocals,\r\nSubvocals, and Aspirates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOCALS. (12)\r\n\r\nVocals are sounds which consist of pure tone only. They are the most\r\nprominent elements of all words, and it is proper that they should first\r\nreceive attention. A vocal may be represented by one letter, as in the\r\nword hat, or by two or more letters, as in heat, beauty. A diphthong is a\r\nunion of two vocals, commencing with one and ending with the other. It is\r\nusually represented by two letters, as in the words oil, boy, out, now.\r\n\r\nEach of these can he uttered with great force, so as to give a distinct\r\nexpression of its sound, although the voice be suddenly suspended, the\r\nmoment the sound is produced. This is done by putting the lips, teeth,\r\ntongue, and palate in their proper position, and then expelling each sound\r\nfrom the throat in the same manner that the syllable "ah!" is uttered in\r\nendeavoring to deter a child from something it is about to do; thus,\r\na\'--a\'--a\'--.\r\n\r\nLet the pupil he required to utter every one of the elements in the Table\r\nwith all possible suddenness and percussive force, until he is able to do\r\nit with ease and accuracy. This must not he considered as accomplished\r\nuntil he can give each sound with entire clearness, and with all the\r\nsuddenness of the crack of a rifle. Care must be taken that the vocal\r\nalone be heard; there must be no consonantal sound, and no vocal sound\r\nother than the one intended.\r\n\r\nAt first, the elementary sounds may be repeated by the class in concert;\r\nthen separately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF VOCALS. (13)\r\n\r\nLong Sounds.\r\n\r\nSound   as in\r\n\r\na       hate\r\ne       err\r\na       hare\r\ni       pine\r\na       pass\r\no       no\r\na       far\r\noo      cool\r\na       fall\r\nu       tube\r\ne       eve\r\nu       burn\r\n\r\n\r\nShort Sounds.\r\n\r\nSound   as in\r\n\r\na       mat\r\no       hot\r\ne       met\r\noo      book\r\ni       it\r\nu       us\r\n\r\n\r\nDiphthongs.\r\noi, oy, as in oil, boy.\r\nou, ow, as in out, now.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARK I.--In this table, the short sounds are nearly or quite the same,\r\nin quantity, as the long sounds. The difference consists chiefly in\r\nquality. Let the pupil determine this fact by experiment.\r\n\r\nREMARK II.--The vocals are often represented by other letters or\r\ncombinations of letters than those used in the table: for instance, a is\r\nrepresented by ai as in hail, by ea as in steak, etc.\r\n\r\nREMARK III.--As  a general rule, the long vocals and the diphthongs should\r\nbe articulated with full, clear utterance; but the short vocals have a\r\nsharp, distinct, and almost explosive utterance. Weakness of speech\r\nfollows a failure to observe the first point, while drawling results from\r\ncarelessness with respect to the second.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBVOCALS AND ASPIRATES (13)\r\n\r\nSubvocals are those sounds in which the vocalized breath is more or less\r\nobstructed.\r\n\r\nAspirates consist of breath only, modified by the vocal organs.\r\n\r\nWords ending with subvocal sounds may be selected for practice on the\r\nsubvocals; words beginning or ending with aspirate sounds may be used for\r\npractice on aspirates. Pronounce these words forcibly and distinctly,\r\nseveral times in succession; then drop the other sounds, and repeat the\r\nsubvocals and aspirates alone. Let the class repeat the words and\r\nelements, at first, in concert; then separately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF SUBVOCALS AND ASPIRATES. (14)\r\n\r\nSubvocals. as in\r\n\r\nb          babe\r\nd          bad\r\ng          nag\r\nj          judge\r\nv          move\r\nth         with\r\nz          buzz\r\nz          azure (azh-)\r\nw          wine\r\n\r\nAspirates. as in\r\n\r\np          rap\r\nt          at\r\nk          book\r\nch         rich\r\nf          life\r\nth         smith\r\ns          hiss\r\nsh         rush\r\nwh         what\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARK.--These eighteen sounds make nine pairs of cognates. In\r\narticulating the aspirates, the vocal organs are put in the position\r\nrequired in the articulation of the corresponding subvocals; but the\r\nbreath is expelled with some force, without the utterance of any vocal\r\nsound. The pupil should first verify this by experiment, and then practice\r\non these cognates.\r\n\r\nThe following subvocals and aspirate have no cognates:\r\n\r\nSUBVOCAL  as in\r\n\r\nl         mill\r\nng        sing\r\nm         rim\r\nr         rule\r\nn         run\r\ny         yet\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nASPIRATE.\r\n\r\nh, as in hat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBSTITUTES. (14)\r\n\r\nSubstitutes are characters used to represent sounds ordinarily represented\r\nby other characters.\r\n\r\nTABLE OF SUBSTITUTES.\r\nSub  for  as in\r\n\r\na    o    what\r\ny    i    hymn\r\ne    a    there\r\nc    s    cite\r\ne    a    freight\r\nc    k    cap\r\ni    e    police\r\nch   sh   machine\r\ni    e    sir\r\nch   k    chord\r\no    u    son\r\ng    j    cage\r\no    oo   to\r\nn    ng   rink\r\no    oo   would\r\ns    z    rose\r\no    a    corn\r\ns    sh   sugar\r\no    u    worm\r\nx    gz   examine\r\nu    oo   pull\r\ngh   f    laugh\r\nu    oo   rude\r\nph   f    sylph\r\ny    i    my\r\nqu   k    pique\r\nqu   kw   quick\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAULTS TO BE REMEDIED.

INFLECTION. (18)\r\n\r\nInflection is a bending or sliding of the voice either upward or downward.\r\n\r\nThe upward or rising inflection is an upward slide of the voice, and is\r\nmarked by the acute accent, thus, (\'); as,\r\n\r\n   Did you call\'? Is he sick\'?\r\n\r\nThe downward or falling inflection is a downward slide of the voice, and\r\nis marked by the grave accent, thus, (\'); as,\r\n\r\n   Where is London\'? Where have you been\'?\r\n\r\nSometimes both the rising and falling inflections are given to the same\r\nsound. Such sounds are designated by the circumflex, thus, (v) or thus,\r\n(^). The former is called the rising circumflex; the latter, the falling\r\ncircumflex; as,\r\n\r\n  But nobody can bear the death of Clodius.\r\n\r\nWhen several successive syllables are uttered without either the upward or\r\ndownward slide, they are said to be uttered in a monotone, which is marked\r\nthus, (--); as,\r\n\r\n  Roll on, thou deep and dark blue Ocean--roll\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES. (19)\r\n\r\n  Does he read correctly\' or incorrectly\'?\r\n\r\nIn reading this sentence, the voice should slide somewhat as represented\r\nin the following diagram:\r\n\r\n  Does he read cor-rectly or incorrect-ly?\r\n\r\n\r\n  If you said vinegar, I said sugar,\r\n\r\nTo be read thus:\r\n\r\n  If you said vinegar, I said sugar,\r\n\r\n\r\n  If you said yes, I said no.\r\n\r\nTo be read thus:\r\n\r\n  If you said yes, I said no.\r\n\r\n\r\n  What! did he say no?\r\n\r\nTo be read thus:\r\n\r\n  What! did he say no?\r\n\r\n\r\n  He did\'; he said no\',\r\n\r\nTo be read thus;\r\n\r\n  He did; he said no.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Did he do it voluntarily\', or involuntarily\'?\r\n\r\nTo be read thus:\r\n\r\n  Did he do it voluntarily, or involuntarily?\r\n\r\n\r\n  He did it voluntarily\', not involuntarily\',\r\n\r\nTo be read thus:\r\n\r\n  He did it voluntarily, not involuntarily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISES.

(21)\r\n\r\nRULE I.--Sentences, and parts of sentences which make complete sense in\r\nthemselves, require the falling inflection.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES. (21)\r\n\r\n1. By virtue we secure happiness\'.\r\n\r\n2. For thou hast said in thine heart, I will ascend into heaven\': I will\r\nexalt my throne above the stars of God\':  I will sit, also, upon the mount\r\nof the congregation, in the sides of the north\'.\r\n\r\n3. The wind and the rain are over\'; calm is the noon of the day\\: the\r\nclouds are divided in heaven\'; over the green hills flies the inconstant\r\nsun\'; red through the stormy vale comes down the stream\'.\r\n\r\n4. This proposition was, however, rejected,\' and not merely rejected, but\r\nrejected with insult\'.\r\n\r\nException.--Emphasis sometimes reverses this rule, and requires the rising\r\ninflection, apparently for the purpose of calling attention to the idea of\r\nan unusual manner of expressing it.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES. (21)\r\n\r\n1. I should not like to ride in that car\'.\r\n2. Look out! A man was drowned there yesterday\'.\r\n3. Presumptuous man! the gods\' take care of Cato\',\r\n\r\n\r\nRULE II.--The language of emphasis generally requires the falling\r\ninflection.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES. (22)\r\n\r\n1. Charge\', Chester, charge\'; on\', Stanley, on\'.\r\n\r\n2. Were I an American, as I am an Englishman, while a single\' foreign\r\ntroop\' remained\' in my country, I would never\' lay down my arms\'--never\',\r\nnever\', never.\'\r\n\r\n3. Does anyone suppose that the payment of twenty shillings, would have\r\nruined Mr. Hampden\'s fortune? No\'. But the payment of half twenty\r\nshillings, on the principle\' it was demanded, would have made him a\r\nslave\'.\r\n\r\n4. I insist\' upon this point\': I urge\' you to it; I press\' it, demand\' it.\r\n\r\n5. All that I have\', all that I am\', and all that I hope\' in this life, I\r\nam now ready\', here, to stake\' upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\nRULE III.--Interrogative sentences and members of sentences, which\r\ncan not be answered by yes or no, generally require the falling inflection.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE.

Ah! what is that flame which now bursts on his eye\'?\r\n\r\n5. Whence this pleasing hope\', this fond desire\',\r\n   This longing after immortality\'?\r\n\r\n\r\nException.--When questions usually requiring  the falling inflection are\r\nemphatic or repeated, they take the rising inflection.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES. (22)\r\n\r\n1. Where did you say he had gone\'?\r\n\r\n2. To whom did you say the blame was to be imputed\'?\r\n\r\n3. What is\' he? A knave. What\' is he? A knave, I say.\r\n\r\n\r\nRISING INFLECTION. (23)\r\n\r\nRULE IV.--The rising inflection is generally used where the sense is\r\ndependent or incomplete.\r\n\r\nREMARK.--This inflection is generally very slight, requiring an acute and\r\neducated ear to discern it, and it is difficult to teach pupils to\r\ndistinguish it, though they constantly use it. Care should be taken not to\r\nexaggerate it.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES. (23)\r\n\r\n1. Nature being exhausted\', he quietly resigned himself to his fate.\r\n\r\n2. A chieftain to the Highlands bound\',\r\n   Cries\', "Boatman, do not tarry!"\r\n\r\n3. As he spoke without fear of consequences\', so his actions were\r\nmarked with the most unbending resolution,\r\n\r\n4. Speaking in the open air\', at the top of the voice\', is an admirable\r\nexercise.\r\n\r\n5. If then, his Providence\' out of our evil, seek to bring forth good\', our\r\nlabor must be to prevent that end.\r\n\r\n6. He\', born for the universe\', narrowed his mind,\r\n   And to party gave up what was meant for mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARK.--The names of persons or things addressed, when not used\r\nemphatically, are included in this rule.\r\n\r\n7. Brother\', give me thy hand; and, gentle Warwick!,\r\n   Let me embrace thee in my weary arms.\r\n\r\n8. O Lancaster\', I fear thy overthrow.\r\n\r\n9. Ye crags\' and peaks\', I\'m with you once again.\r\n\r\nException 1.--Relative emphasis often reverses this and the first rule,\r\nbecause emphasis is here expressed in part by changing the usual\r\ninflections.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES. (23)\r\n\r\n1. If you care not for your property\', you surely value your life\'.\r\n\r\n2. If you will not labor for your own\' advancement, you should regard\r\nthat of your children\'.\r\n\r\n3. It is your place to obey\', not to command\'.\r\n\r\n4. Though by that course he should not destroy his reputation\', he will\r\nlose all self-respect\'.\r\n\r\nException 2.--The names of persons addressed in a formal speech, or\r\nwhen used emphatically, have the falling inflection.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.

My Lord, we could not have had such designs\'.\r\n\r\n5. You are not left alone to climb the steep ascent\': God is with you, who\r\nnever suffers the spirit that rests on him to fail.\r\n\r\n\r\nException 1.--Emphasis may reverse this rule.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE. (24)\r\n\r\nWe repeat it, we do not\' desire to produce discord; we do not\' wish to\r\nkindle the flames of a civil war.\r\n\r\n\r\nException 2.--General propositions and commands usually have the\r\nfalling inflection.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.

I could honor thy courage\', but I detest thy crimes\'.\r\n\r\n4. It is easier to forgive the weak\', who have injured us\', than the\r\npowerful\' whom we\' have injured.\r\n\r\n5. Homer was the greater genius\', Virgil the better artist\'.\r\n\r\n6. The style of Dryden is capricious and varied\'; that of Pope is cautious\r\nand uniform\'. Dryden obeys the emotions of his own mind\'; Pope constrains\r\nhis mind to his own rules of composition.\' Dryden is sometimes vehement\r\nand rapid\'; Pope is always smooth, uniform, and gentle\'. Dryden\'s page is\r\na natural field, rising into inequalities, varied by exuberant\r\nvegetation\'; Pope\'s is a velvet lawn, shaven by the scythe and leveled by\r\nthe roller\'.\r\n\r\n7. If the flights of Dryden are higher\', Pope continues longer on the\r\nwing\'. If the blaze of Dryden\'s fire is brighter\', the heat of Pope\'s is\r\nmore regular and constant\'. Dryden often surpasses\' expectation, and Pope\r\nnever falls below\' it.\r\n\r\nREMARK l.--Words and members connected by or used disjunctively, generally\r\nexpress contrast or antithesis, and always receive opposite inflection.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.

Shall we crown\' the author of these public calamities with garlands\',\r\nor shall we wrest\' from him his ill-deserved authority\' ?\r\n\r\nREMARK 2.--When the antithesis is between affirmation and negation, the\r\nlatter usually has the rising inflection, according to Rule V.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.

If we can not remove\' pain, we may alleviate\' it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOF SERIES. (28)\r\n\r\nA series is a number of particulars immediately following one another\r\nin the same grammatical construction.\r\n\r\nA commencing series is one which commences a sentence or clause.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE. (28)\r\n\r\nFaith, hope, love, joy, are the fruits of the spirit.\r\n\r\nA concluding series is one which concludes a sentence or a clause.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE. (28)\r\n\r\nThe fruits of the spirit are faith, hope, love, and joy.\r\n\r\nRULE IX.--All the members of a commencing series, when not emphatic,\r\nusually require the rising inflection.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES. (28)\r\n\r\n1. War\', famine\', pestilence\', storm\', and fire\' besiege mankind.\r\n\r\n2. The knowledge\', the power\', the wisdom\', the goodness\' of God, must all\r\nbe unbounded.\r\n\r\n3. To advise the ignorant\', to relieve the needy\', and to comfort the\r\nafflicted\' are the duties that fall in our way almost every day of our\r\nlives.\r\n\r\n4. No state chicanery\', no narrow system of vicious politics\', no idle\r\ncontest for ministerial victories\', sank him to the vulgar level of the\r\ngreat.\r\n\r\n5. For solidity of reasoning\', force of sagacity\', and wisdom of\r\nconclusion\', no nation or body of men can compare with the Congress at\r\nPhiladelphia.\r\n\r\n6.

Property\', character\', reputation\', everything\', was sacrificed.\r\n\r\n3. Toils\', sufferings\', wounds\', and death\' was the price of our liberty.\r\n\r\n\r\nRULE X.--All the members of a concluding series, when not at all emphatic,\r\nusually require the falling inflection.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES. (29)\r\n\r\n1. It is our duty to pity\', to support\', to defend\', and to relieve\' the\r\noppressed.\r\n\r\n2. At the sacred call of country, they sacrifice property\', ease\',\r\nhealth\', applause\' and even life\'.\r\n\r\n3. I protest against this measure as cruel\', oppressive\', tyrannous\', and\r\nvindictive\'.\r\n\r\n4. God was manifest in the flesh\', justified in the Spirit\', seen of\r\nangels\', preached unto the Gentiles\', believed on in the world\', received\r\nup into glory\'.\r\n\r\n5. Charity vaunteth not itself\', is not puffed up\', doth not behave itself\r\nunseemly\', seeketh not her own\', is not easily provoked\', thinketh no\r\nevil\'; beareth\' all things, believeth\' all things, hopeth\' all things,\r\nendureth\' all things.\r\n\r\nREMARK.--Some authors give the following rule for the reading of a\r\nconcluding series: "All the particulars of a concluding series, except the\r\nlast but one, require the falling inflection."

His hopes\', his happiness\', his life\', hung upon the words that fell\r\nfrom those lips,\r\n\r\n3. They fought\', they bled\', they died\', for freedom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPARENTHESIS. (30)\r\n\r\nRULE XI.--A parenthesis should be read more rapidly and in a lower key\r\nthan the rest of the sentence, and should terminate with the same\r\ninflection that next precedes it. If, however, it is complicated, or\r\nemphatic, or disconnected from the main subject, the inflections must be\r\ngoverned by the same rules as in the other cases.\r\n\r\nREMARK.--A smooth and expressive reading of a parenthesis is difficult of\r\nacquisition, and can be secured only by careful and persistent training.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES. (30)\r\n\r\n1. God is my witness\' (whom I serve with my spirit, in the gospel of his\r\nSon\'), that, without ceasing, I make mention of you always in my prayers;\r\nmaking request\' (if, by any means, now at length, I might have a\r\nprosperous journey by the will of God\'), to come unto you.\r\n\r\n2. When he had entered the room three paces, he stood still; and laying\r\nhis left hand upon his breast\' (a slender, white staff with which he\r\njourneyed being in his right\'), he introduced himself with a little story\r\nof his convent.\r\n\r\n3. If you, AEschines, in particular, were persuaded\' (and it was no\r\nparticular affection for me, that prompted you to give up the hopes, the\r\nappliances, the honors, which attended the course I then advised; but the\r\nsuperior force of truth, and your utter inability to point any course more\r\neligible\') if this was the case, I say, is it not highly cruel and unjust\r\nto arraign these measures now, when you could not then propose a better?\r\n\r\n4. As the hour of conflict drew near\' (and this was a conflict to be\r\ndreaded even by him\'), he began to waver, and to abate much of his\r\nboasting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCIRCUMFLEX. (31)\r\n\r\nRULE XII.--The circumflex is used to express irony, sarcasm, hypothesis,\r\nor contrast.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--For the reason that the circumflex always suggests a double or\r\ndoubtful meaning, it is appropriate for the purposes expressed in the\r\nrule. It is, also, frequently used in sportive language; jokes and puns\r\nare commonly given with this inflection.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES. (31)\r\n\r\n1. Man never is, but always to be, blest.\r\n\r\n2. They follow an adventurer whom they fear; we serve a monarch whom we\r\nlove. They boast, they come but to improve our state, enlarge our\r\nthoughts, and free us from the yoke of error. Yes, they will give\r\nenlightened freedom to our minds, who are themselves the slaves of\r\npassion, avarice, and pride. They offer us their protection: yes, such\r\nprotection as vultures give to lambs, covering and devouring them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMONOTONE. (32)\r\n\r\nRULE XIII.--The use of the monotone is confined chiefly to grave and\r\nsolemn subjects. When carefully and properly employed, it gives great\r\ndignity to delivery.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES. (32)\r\n\r\n1. The unbeliever! one who can gaze upon the sun, and moon, and stars, and\r\nupon the unfading and imperishable sky, spread out so magnificently above\r\nhim, and say, "All this is the work of chance!"\r\n\r\n2. God walketh upon the ocean. Brilliantly\r\n   The glassy waters mirror back his smiles;\r\n   The surging billows, and the gamboling storms\r\n   Come crouching to his feet.\r\n\r\n3. I hail thee, as in gorgeous robes,\r\n   Blooming thou leav\'st the chambers of the east,\r\n   Crowned with a gemmed tiara thick embossed\r\n   With studs of living light.\r\n\r\n4. High on a throne of royal state, which far\r\n   Outshone the wealth of Ormus and of Ind,\r\n   Or where the gorgeous east, with richest hand\r\n   Showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold,\r\n   Satan exalted sat.\r\n\r\n5. His broad expanded wings\r\n   Lay calm and motionless upon the air,\r\n   As if he floated there without their aid,\r\n   By the sole act of his unlorded will.\r\n\r\n6. In dim eclipse, disastrous twilight sheds\r\n   On half the nations, and with fear of change\r\n   Perplexes monarchs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. ACCENT AND EMPHASIS. (33)\r\n\r\nACCENT.\r\n\r\nThat syllable in a word which is uttered more forcibly than the others, is\r\nsaid to be accented, and is marked thus, (\'); as the italicized syllables\r\nin the following words:\r\n\r\nmorn\'ing.     pos\'si-ble.\r\nty\'rant.      re-cum\'bent.\r\npro-cure\'.    ex-or\'bi-tant,\r\nde-bate\'.     com-pre-hen\'sive.\r\n\r\nCommon usage alone determines upon what syllable the accent should be\r\nplaced, and to the lexicographer it belongs, to ascertain and record its\r\ndecision on this point.\r\n\r\nIn some few cases, we can trace the reasons for common usage in this\r\nrespect. In words which are used as different parts of speech, or which\r\nhave different meanings, the distinction is sometimes denoted by changing\r\nthe accent.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES. (33)\r\n\r\n   sub\'ject   sub-ject\'\r\n   pres\'ent   pre-sent\'\r\n   ab\'sent    ab-sent\'\r\n   cem\'ent    ce-ment\'\r\n   con\'jure   con-jure\'\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is another case, in which we discover the reason for changing the\r\naccent, and that is, when it is required by emphasis, as in the following:\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES. (33)\r\n\r\n1. His abil\'ity or in\'ability to perform the act materially varies\r\n   the case.\r\n2. This corrup\'tion must put on in\'corruption.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSECONDARY ACCENT. (34)\r\n\r\nIn words of more than two syllables, there is often a second accent given,\r\nbut more slight than the principal one, and this is called the secondary\r\naccent; as, em"igra\'tion, rep"artee\', where the principal accent is marked\r\n(\'), and the secondary, ("); so, also, this accent is obvious, in\r\nnav"iga\'tion, com"prehen\'sion, plau"sibil\'ity, etc. The whole subject,\r\nhowever, properly belongs to dictionaries and spelling books.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMPHASIS. (34)\r\n\r\nEmphasis consists in uttering a word or phrase in such a manner as to give\r\nit force and energy, and to draw the attention of the hearer particularly\r\nto the idea expressed.\r\n\r\nThis is most frequently accomplished by an increased stress of voice laid\r\nupon the word or phrase. Sometimes, though more rarely, the same object is\r\neffected by an unusual lowering of the voice, even to a whisper, and not\r\nunfrequently by a pause before the emphatic word.\r\n\r\nThe inflections are often made subsidiary to this object. To give emphasis\r\nto a word, the inflection is changed or increased in force or extent. When\r\nthe rising inflection is ordinarily used, the word, when emphatic,\r\nfrequently takes the falling inflection; and sometimes, also, the falling\r\ninflection is changed into the rising inflection, for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nEmphatic words are often denoted by being written in italics, in SMALL\r\nCAPITALS, or in CAPITALS.\r\n\r\nMuch care is necessary to train the pupil to give clear and expressive\r\nemphasis, and at the same time to avoid an unpleasant "jerky" movement of\r\nthe voice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABSOLUTE EMPHASIS. (35)\r\n\r\nWhere the emphasis is independent of any contrast or comparison with\r\nother words or ideas, it is called absolute emphasis.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES. (35)\r\n\r\n1. We praise thee, O God; we acknowledge thee to be the Lord.\r\n\r\n2. Roll on, thou deep and dark blue Ocean--roll!\r\n\r\n3. Arm, warriors, arm!\r\n\r\n4. You know that you are Brutus, that speak this,\r\n   Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.\r\n\r\n5. Hamlet. Saw, who?\r\n   Horatio. The king, your father.\r\n   Hamlet. The king, my father?\r\n\r\n6. Strike--till the last armed foe expires;\r\n   Strike--for your altars and your fires;\r\n   Strike--for the green graves of your sites;\r\n   God, and your native land!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRELATIVE EMPHASIS. (35)\r\n\r\nWhere there is antithesis, either expressed or implied, the emphasis is\r\ncalled relative.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES. (35)\r\n\r\n1.  We can do nothing against the truth, but for the truth.\r\n\r\n2.  But I am describing your condition, rather than my own.\r\n\r\n3.  I fear not death, and shall I then fear thee?\r\n\r\n4.  Hunting men, and not beasts, shall be his game.\r\n\r\n5. He is the propitiation for our sins; and not for ours only, but for the\r\nsins of the whole world.\r\n\r\n6. It may moderate and restrain, but it was not designed to banish\r\ngladness from the heart of man.\r\n\r\nIn the following examples, there are two sets of antitheses in the same\r\nsentence.\r\n\r\n7. To err is human, to forgive, divine.\r\n\r\n8. John was punished; William, rewarded.\r\n\r\n9. Without were fightings, within were fears.\r\n\r\n10. Business sweetens pleasure, as labor sweetens rest.\r\n\r\n11. Justice appropriates rewards to merit, and punishments to crime.\r\n\r\n12. On the one side, all was alacrity and courage; on the other, all was\r\ntimidity and indecision.\r\n\r\n13. The wise man is happy when he gains his own approbation; the fool,\r\nwhen he gains the applause of others.\r\n\r\n14. His care was to polish the country by art, as he had protected it by\r\narms.\r\n\r\nIn the following examples, the relative emphasis is applied to three sets\r\nof antithetic words.\r\n\r\n15. The difference between a madman and a fool is, that the former\r\nreasons justly from false data; and the latter, erroneously from just data.\r\n\r\n16. He raised a mortal to the skies,\r\n    She drew an angel down.\r\n\r\nSometimes the antithesis is implied, as in the following instances.\r\n\r\n17. The spirit of the white man\'s heaven,\r\n    Forbids not thee to weep.\r\n\r\n18. I shall enter on no encomiums upon Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMPHASIS AND ACCENT. (37)\r\n\r\nWhen words, which are the same in part of their formation, are contrasted,\r\nthe emphasis is expressed by accenting the syllables in which they differ.\r\nSee Accent, page 33.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES. (37)\r\n\r\n1.  What is the difference between probability and possibility?\r\n\r\n2.  Learn to unlearn what you have learned amiss.\r\n\r\n3.  John attends regularly. William, irregularly.\r\n\r\n4.  There is a great difference between giving and forgiving.\r\n\r\n5.  The conduct of Antoninus was characterized by justice and humanity;\r\nthat of Nero, by injustice and inhumanity.\r\n\r\n6. The conduct of the former is deserving of approbation, while that of\r\nthe latter merits the severest reprobation.\r\n\r\n\r\nEMPHASIS AND INFLECTION. (37)\r\n\r\nEmphasis sometimes changes the inflection from the rising to the falling,\r\nor from the falling to the rising. For instances of the former change, see\r\nRule II, and Exception 1 to Rule IV. In the first three following\r\nexamples, the inflection is changed from the rising to the falling\r\ninflection; in the last three, it is changed from the falling to the\r\nrising, by the influence of emphasis.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES. (37)\r\n\r\n\r\n1. If we have no regard for religion in youth\', we ought to have respect\r\nfor it in age.\r\n\r\n2. If we have no regard for our own\' character, we ought to regard the\r\ncharacter of others.\r\n\r\n3. If content can not remove\' the disquietudes of life, it will, at least,\r\nalleviate them.\r\n\r\n4. The sweetest melody and the most perfect harmony fall powerless upon\r\nthe ear of one who is deaf\',\r\n\r\n5. It is useless to expatiate upon the beauties of nature to one who is\r\nblind\',\r\n\r\n6. And they that have believing masters, let them not despise them,\r\nbecause they are brethren\'; but rather let them do them service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMPHATIC PHRASE. (38)\r\n\r\nWhen it is desired to give to a phrase great force of expression, each\r\nword, and even the parts of a compound word, are independently emphasized.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES. (38)\r\n\r\n1. Cassius. Must I endure all this?\r\n   Brutus. All this!--Ay,--more. Fret, till your proud--heart--break.\r\n\r\n2. What! weep you when you but behold\r\n   Our Caesar\'s vesture wounded? Look ye here,\r\n   Here is himself, marred, as you see, by traitors.\r\n\r\n3. There was a time, my fellow-citizens, when the Lacedaemonians were\r\nsovereign masters, both by sea and by land; while this state had not one\r\nship--no, NOT--ONE--WALL.\r\n\r\n4. Shall I, the conqueror of Spain and Gaul; and not only of the Alpine\r\nnations, but of the Alps themselves; shall I compare myself with this\r\nHALF--YEAR--CAPTAIN?\r\n\r\n5. You call me misbeliever--cutthroat--dog.\r\n   Hath a dog--money? Is it possible--\r\n   A cur can lend three--thousand--ducats?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMPHATIC PAUSE. (39)\r\n\r\nA short pause is often made before or after, and sometimes both before and\r\nafter, an emphatic word or phrase,--thus very much increasing the emphatic\r\nexpression of the thought.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES. (39)\r\n\r\n1. May one be pardoned, and retain--the offense?\r\n   In the corrupted currents of this world,\r\n   Offense\'s gilded hand may shove by--justice;\r\n   And oft \'tis seen, the wicked prize itself\r\n   Buys out the law: but \'t is not so--above:\r\n   There--is no shuffling: there--the action lies\r\n   In its true nature.\r\n\r\n2. He woke to hear his sentries shriek,\r\n   "To arms! they come! the Greek! the Greek!\r\n   He woke--to die--midst flame and smoke."\r\n\r\n3. This--is no flattery: These--are counselors\r\n   That feelingly persuade me what I am.\r\n\r\n4. And this--our life, exempt from public haunt,\r\n   Finds tongues--in tree, books--in the running brooks,\r\n   Sermons--in stones, and--good in everything.\r\n\r\n5. Heaven gave this Lyre, and thus decreed,\r\n   Be thou a bruised--but not a broken--reed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. INSTRUCTIONS FOR READING VERSE. (39)\r\n\r\nINFLECTIONS.\r\n\r\nIn reading verse, the inflections should be nearly the same as in reading\r\nprose; the chief difference is, that in poetry, the monotone and rising\r\ninflection are more frequently used than in prose. The greatest difficulty\r\nin reading this species of composition, consists in giving it that\r\nmeasured flow which distinguishes it from prose, without falling into a\r\nchanting pronunciation.\r\n\r\nIf, at any time, the reader is in doubt as to the proper inflection, let\r\nhim reduce the passage to earnest conversation, and pronounce it in the\r\nmost familiar and prosaic manner, and thus he will generally use the\r\nproper inflection.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISES IN INFLECTION. (40)\r\n\r\n1. Meanwhile the south wind rose, and with black wings\r\n   Wide hovering\', all the clouds together drove\r\n   From under heaven\': the hills to their supply\',\r\n   Vapor and exhalation dusk and moist\r\n   Sent up amain\': and now, the thickened sky\r\n   Like a dark ceiling stood\': down rushed the rain\r\n   Impetuous\', and continued till the earth\r\n   No more was seen\': the floating vessel swam\r\n   Uplifted\', and, secure with beake\'d prow\',\r\n   Rode tilting o\'er the waves\'.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. My friend\', adown life\'s valley\', hand in hand\',\r\n     With grateful change of grave and merry speech\r\n     Or song\', our hearts unlocking each to each\',\r\n   We\'ll journey onward to the silent land\';\r\n   And when stern death shall loose that loving band,\r\n     Taking in his cold hand, a hand of ours\',\r\n     The one shall strew the other\'s grave with flowers\',\r\n   Nor shall his heart a moment be unmanned\'.\r\n   My friend and brother\'! if thou goest first\',\r\n     Wilt thou no more revisit me below\'?\r\n   Yea, when my heart seems happy causelessly\',\r\n     And swells\', not dreaming why\', my soul shall know\r\n   That thou\', unseen\', art bending over me\'.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. Here rests his head upon the lap of earth\',\r\n     A youth, to fortune and to fame unknown\';\r\n   Fair Science frowned not on his humble birth\',\r\n     And Melancholy marked him for her own\'.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Large was his bounty\', and his soul sincere\',\r\n     Heaven did a recompense as largely send\';\r\n   He gave to misery (all he had) a tear\',\r\n     He gained from heaven\' (\'t was all he wished\') a friend\'.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. No further seek his merits to disclose\',\r\n     Or draw his frailties from their dread abode\';\r\n   (There they alike\' in trembling hope repose\',)\r\n     The bosom of his Father, and his God\'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nACCENT AND EMPHASIS. (41)\r\n\r\nIn reading verse, every syllable must have the same accent, and every word\r\nthe same emphasis as in prose; and whenever the melody or music of the\r\nverse would lead to an incorrect accent or emphasis, this must be\r\ndisregarded.\r\n\r\nIf a poet has made his verse deficient in melody, this must not be\r\nremedied by the reader, at the expense of sense or the established rules\r\nof accent and quantity. Take the following:\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE. (41)\r\n\r\n   O\'er shields, and helms, and helme\'d heads he rode,\r\n   Of thrones, and mighty Seraphim prostrate\r\n\r\nAccording to the metrical accent, the last word must be pronounced\r\n"pros-trate\'." But according to the authorized pronunciation it is\r\n"pros\'trate. Which shall yield, the poet or established usage? Certainly\r\nnot the latter.\r\n\r\nSome writers advise a compromise of the matter, and that the word should\r\nhe pronounced without accenting either syllable. Sometimes this may be\r\ndone, but where it is not practiced, the prosaic reading should be\r\npreserved.\r\n\r\nIn the following examples, the words and syllables which are improperly\r\naccented or emphasized in the poetry, are marked in italics. According to\r\nthe principle stated above, the reader should avoid giving them that\r\npronunciation which the correct rending of the poetry would require, but\r\nshould read them as prose, except where he can throw off all accent and\r\nthus compromise the conflict between the poetic reading and the correct\r\nreading. That is, he must read the poetry wrong, in order to read the\r\nlanguage right.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES. (42)\r\n\r\n1. Ask of thy mother earth why oaks are made\r\n   Taller and stronger than the weeds they shade.\r\n\r\n2. Their praise is still, "the style is excellent,"\r\n   The sense they humbly take upon content.\r\n\r\n3. False eloquence, like the prismatic glass,\r\n   Its fairy colors spreads on every place.\r\n\r\n4. To do aught good, never will be our task,\r\n   But ever to do ill is our sole delight.\r\n\r\n5. Of all the causes which combine to blind\r\n   Man\'s erring judgment, and mislead the mind,\r\n   What the weak head with strongest bias rules\r\n   Is pride, the never-failing vice of fools.\r\n\r\n6. Eye Nature\'s walks, shoot folly as it flies,\r\n   And catch the manners living as they rise.\r\n\r\n7. To whom then, first incensed, Adam replied,\r\n   "Is this thy love, is this the recompense\r\n   Of mine to thee, ungrateful Eve?"\r\n\r\n8. We may, with more successful hope, resolve\r\n   To wage, by force or guile, successful war,\r\n   Irreconcilable to our grand foe,\r\n   Who now triumphs, and in excess of joy\r\n   Sole reigning holds the tyranny of Heaven.\r\n\r\n9. Which, when Beelzebub perceived (than whom,\r\n   Satan except, none higher sat), with grave\r\n   Aspect, he rose, and in his rising seemed\r\n   A pillar of state.\r\n\r\n10. Thee, Sion, and the flowery brooks beneath,\r\n    That wash thy hallowed feet, and warbling flow,\r\n    Nightly I visit: nor sometimes forget,\r\n    Those other two equaled with me in fate.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--Although it would be necessary, in these examples, to violate the\r\nlaws of accent or emphasis, to give perfect rhythm, yet a careful and\r\nwell-trained reader will be able to observe these laws and still give the\r\nrhythm in such a manner that the defect will scarcely be noticed.\r\n\r\nPOETIC PAUSES. (43)\r\n\r\nIn order to make the measure of poetry perceptible to the ear, there\r\nshould generally be a slight pause at the end of each line, even where the\r\nsense does not require it.\r\n\r\nThere is, also, in almost every line of poetry, a pause at or near its\r\nmiddle, which is called the caesura.\r\n\r\nThis should, however, never be so placed as to injure the sense of the\r\npassage. It is indeed reckoned a great beauty, where it naturally\r\ncoincides with the pause required by the sense. The caesura, though\r\ngenerally placed near the middle, may be placed at other intervals.\r\n\r\nThere are sometimes, also, two additional pauses in each line, called\r\ndemi-caesuras.\r\n\r\nThe caesura is marked (||), and the demi-caesura thus, (|), in the\r\nexamples given.\r\n\r\nThere should be a marked accent upon the long syllable next preceding\r\nthe caesura, and a slighter one upon that next before each of the\r\ndemi-caesuras. When made too prominent, these pauses lead to a singsong\r\nstyle, which should be carefully avoided.\r\n\r\nIn the following examples, the caesura is marked in each line; the\r\ndemi-caesura is not marked in every case.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES. (44)\r\n\r\n1. Nature | to all things || fixed | the limits fit,\r\n   And wisely | curbed || proud man\'s | pretending wit.\r\n\r\n2. Then from his closing eyes || thy form shall part,\r\n   And the last pang || shall tear thee from his heart.\r\n\r\n3. Warms in the sun, || refreshes in the breeze,\r\n   Glows in the stars, || and blossoms in the trees.\r\n\r\n4. There is a land || of every land the pride,\r\n   Beloved by Heaven || o\'er all the world beside,\r\n   Where brighter suns || dispense serener light,\r\n   And milder moons || imparadise the night;\r\n   Oh, thou shalt find, || howe\'er thy footsteps roam,\r\n   That land--thy country, || and that spot--thy home.\r\n\r\n5. In slumbers | of midnight || the sailor | boy lay;\r\n     His hammock | swung loose || at the sport | of the wind;\r\n   But, watch-worn | and weary, || his cares | flew away,\r\n     And visions | of happiness || danced | o\'er his mind.\r\n\r\n6. She said, | and struck; || deep entered | in her side\r\n   The piercing steel, || with reeking purple dyed:\r\n   Clogged | in the wound || the cruel | weapon stands,\r\n   The spouting blood || came streaming o\'er her hands.\r\n   Her sad attendants || saw the deadly stroke,\r\n   And with loud cries || the sounding palace shook.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIMILE. (44)\r\n\r\nSimile is the likening of anything to another object of a different class;\r\nit is a poetical or imaginative comparison.\r\n\r\nA simile, in poetry, should usually he read in a lower key and more\r\nrapidly than other parts of the passage--somewhat as a parenthesis is\r\nread.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES. (45)\r\n\r\n1. Part curb their fiery steeds, or shun the goal\r\n   With rapid wheels, or fronted brigades form.\r\n   As when, to warn proud cities, war appears,\r\n   Waged in the troubled sky, and armies rush\r\n   To battle in the clouds.\r\n   Others with vast Typhoean rage more fell,\r\n   Rend up both rocks and hills, and ride the air\r\n   In whirlwind. Hell scarce holds the wild uproar.\r\n   As when Alcides felt the envenomed robe, and tore,\r\n   Through pain, up by the roots, Thessialian pines,\r\n   And Lichas from the top of Oeta threw\r\n   Into the Euboic sea.\r\n\r\n2.                    Each at the head,\r\n   Leveled his deadly aim; their fatal hands\r\n   No second stroke intend; and such a frown\r\n   Each cast at th\' other, as when two black clouds,\r\n   With heaven\'s artillery fraught, came rolling on\r\n   Over the Caspian, there stand front to front,\r\n   Hovering a space, till winds the signal blow\r\n   To join the dark encounter, in mid-air:\r\n   So frowned the mighty combatants.\r\n\r\n3. Then pleased and thankful from the porch they go\r\n   And, but the landlord, none had cause of woe:\r\n   His cup was vanished; for, in secret guise,\r\n   The younger guest purloined the glittering prize.\r\n   As one who spies a serpent in his way,\r\n   Glistening and basking in the summer ray,\r\n   Disordered, stops to shun the danger near,\r\n   Then walks with faintness on, and looks with fear,--\r\n   So seemed the sire, when, far upon the road,\r\n   The shining spoil his wily partner showed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. THE VOICE. (46)\r\n\r\nPITCH AND COMPASS.\r\n\r\nThe natural pitch of the voice is its keynote, or governing note. It is\r\nthat on which the voice usually dwells, and to which it most frequently\r\nreturns when wearied. It is also the pitch used in conversation, and the\r\none which a reader or speaker naturally adopts--when he reads or speaks--\r\nmost easily and agreeably.\r\n\r\nThe compass of the voice is its range above and below this pitch. To avoid\r\nmonotony in reading or speaking, the voice should rise above or fall below\r\nthis keynote, but always with reference to the sense or character of that\r\nwhich is read or spoken. The proper natural pitch is that above and below\r\nwhich there is most room for variation.\r\n\r\nTo strengthen the voice and increase its compass, select a short sentence,\r\nrepeat it several times in succession in as low a key as the voice can\r\nsound naturally; then rise one note higher, and practice on that key, then\r\nanother, and so on, until the highest pitch of the voice has been reached.\r\nNext, reverse the process, until the lowest pitch has been reached.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES IN PITCH (46)\r\n\r\nHigh Pitch.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--Be careful to distinguish pitch from power in the following\r\nexercise. Speaking in the open air, at the very top of the voice, is an\r\nexercise admirably adapted to strengthen the voice and give it compass,\r\nand should be frequently practiced.\r\n\r\n1. Charge\'!

(47)\r\n\r\nNOTE.--This is the pitch in which we converse.

(49)\r\n\r\nQuantity, in reading and speaking, means the length of time occupied in\r\nuttering a syllable or a word. Sounds and syllables vary greatly in\r\nquantity. Some are long, some short, and others intermediate between those\r\nwhich are long or short. Some sounds, also, may be prolonged or shortened\r\nin utterance to any desired extent. Quantity may be classified as Long,\r\nMedium, or Short.\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS FOR PRACTICE ON LONG QUANTITY.--Select some word of one\r\nsyllable ending with a long vocal or a subvocal sound; pronounce it many\r\ntimes in succession, increasing the quantity at each repetition, until you\r\ncan dwell upon it any desired length of time, without drawling, and in a\r\nnatural tone.\r\n\r\nREMARK.--Practice in accordance with this direction will enable the pupil\r\nto secure that fullness and roundness of voice which is exemplified in the\r\nhailing of a ship, "ship aho--y;" in the reply of the sailor, when, in the\r\nroar of the storm, he answers his captain, "ay--e. ay--e;" and in the\r\ncommand of the officer to his troops, when, amid the thunder of artillery,\r\nhe gives the order, "ma--rch," or "ha--lt."\r\n\r\nThis fullness or roundness of tone is secured, by dwelling on the vocal\r\nsound, and indefinitely protracting it, The mouth should be opened wide,\r\nthe tongue kept down, and the aperture left as round and as free for the\r\nvoice as possible.\r\n\r\nIt is this artificial rotundity which, in connection with a distinct\r\narticulation, enables one who speaks in the open air, or in a very large\r\napartment, to send his voice to the most distant point. It is a certain\r\ndegree of this quality, which distinguishes declamatory or public speaking\r\nor reading from private conversation, and no one can accomplish much, as a\r\npublic speaker, without cultivating it. It must be carefully distinguished\r\nfrom the "high tone," which is an elevation of pitch, and from "loudness."\r\nor "strength" of voice.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that clearness and distinctness of utterance are\r\nsecured by a proper use of the subvocals and aspirates--these sounds\r\ngiving to words their shape, as it were; but a clear, full, and\r\nwell-modulated utterance of the vocals gives to words their fullness.\r\n\r\n\r\nLONG QUANTITY. (49)\r\n\r\n1. Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!\r\n\r\n2. Woe, woe, to the inhabitants of Jerusalem!\r\n\r\n3. O righteous Heaven! ere Freedom found a grave,\r\n   Why slept the sword, omnipotent to save?\r\n   Where was thine arm, O Vengeance! where thy rod,\r\n   That smote the foes of Zion and of God?\r\n\r\n4. O sailor boy! sailor boy! never again\r\n   Shall home, love, or kindred thy wishes repay;\r\n   Unblessed and unhonored, down deep in the main,\r\n   Full many a fathom, thy frame shall decay.\r\n\r\n5. O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast\r\nset thy glory above the heavens! When I consider thy heavens, the work of\r\nthy fingers; the moon and the stars, which thou hast ordained; what is\r\nman, that thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest\r\nhim? For thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast\r\ncrowned him with glory and honor. Thou madest him to have dominion over\r\nthe work of thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet. O Lord,\r\nour Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth!\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDIUM QUANTITY. (50)\r\n\r\n1. Between Nose and Eyes a strange contest arose;\r\n     The spectacles set them, unhappily, wrong;\r\n   The point in dispute was, as all the world knows,\r\n     To which the said spectacles ought to belong.\r\n\r\n2. Bird of the broad and sweeping wing!\r\n     Thy home is high in heaven,\r\n   Where the wide storms their banners fling,\r\n     And the tempest clouds are driven.\r\n\r\n3. At midnight, in his guarded tent,\r\n     The Turk lay dreaming of the hour\r\n   When Greece, her knee in suppliance bent,\r\n     Should tremble at his power.\r\n\r\n4. On New Year\'s night, an old man stood at his window, and looked, with a\r\nglance of fearful despair, up the immovable, unfading heaven, and down\r\nupon the still, pure, white earth, on which no one was now so joyless and\r\nsleepless as he.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHORT QUANTITY. (51)\r\n\r\n1. Quick! or he faints! stand with the cordial near!\r\n\r\n2. Back to thy punishment, false fugitive!\r\n\r\n3. Fret till your proud heart breaks!  Must I observe you?

Quick, man the lifeboat! see yon bark,\r\n     That drives before the blast!\r\n   There\'s a rock ahead, the fog is dark,\r\n     And the storm comes thick and fast.\r\n\r\n6. I am at liberty, like every other man, to use my own language; and\r\nthough, perhaps, I may have some ambition to please this gentleman, I\r\nshall not by myself under any restraint, nor very solicitously copy his\r\ndiction, or his mien, however matured by age or modeled by experience.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOVEMENT. (51)\r\n\r\nMovement is the rapidity with which the voice moves in reading and\r\nspeaking. It varies with the nature of the thought or sentiment to be\r\nexpressed, and should be increased or diminished as good taste may\r\ndetermine. With pupils generally, the tendency is to read too fast. The\r\nresult is, reading or speaking in too high a key and an unnatural style of\r\ndelivery--both of which faults are difficult to be corrected when once\r\nformed. The kinds of movement are Slow, Moderate, and Quick.\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS.--Read a selection as slowly us possible, without drawling.\r\nRead it again and again, increasing the rate of movement at each reading,\r\nuntil it can be read no faster without the utterance becoming indistinct.\r\nReverse this process, reading more and more slowly at each repetition,\r\nuntil the slowest movement is obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\nSLOW MOVEMENT. (52)\r\n\r\n1. Oh that those lips had language! Life has passed\r\n   With me but roughly, since I heard them last.\r\n\r\n2. A tremulous sigh from the gentle night wind\r\n     Through the forest leaves slowly is creeping,\r\n   While stars up above, with their glittering eyes,\r\n     Keep guard; for the army is sleeping.\r\n\r\n3. O Lord\'! have mercy upon us, miserable offenders\'!\r\n\r\n4. So live, that when thy summons comes to join\r\n   The innumerable caravan that moves\r\n   To the pale realms of shade, where each shall take\r\n   His chamber in the silent halls of death,\r\n   Thou go not, like the quarry slave at night,\r\n   Scourged to his dungeon, but, sustained and soothed\r\n   By an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave\r\n   Like one who wraps the drapery of his couch\r\n   About him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.\r\n\r\n\r\nMODERATE MOVEMENT. (52)\r\n\r\n1. The good\', the brave\', the beautiful\',\r\n     How dreamless\' is their sleep,\r\n   Where rolls the dirge-like music\'\r\n     Of the over-tossing deep\'!\r\n   Or where the surging night winds\r\n     Pale Winter\'s robes have spread\r\n   Above the narrow palaces,\r\n     In the cities of the dead\'!\r\n\r\n2. Lives of great men all remind us\r\n     We can make our lives sublime,\r\n   And, departing, leave behind us\r\n     Footprints on the sands of time.\r\n\r\n3. Cast your eyes over this extensive country. Observe the salubrity of\r\nyour climate, the variety and fertility of your soil; and see that soil\r\nintersected in every quarter by bold, navigable streams, flowing to the\r\neast and to the west, as if the finger of heaven were marking out the\r\ncourse of your settlements, inviting you to enterprise, and pointing the\r\nway to wealth.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUICK MOVEMENT. (53)\r\n\r\n1. Awake\'! arise\'! or be forever fallen.\r\n\r\n2. Merrily swinging on brier and weed,\r\n     Near to the nest of his little dame,\r\n   Over the mountain side or mead,\r\n     Robert of Lincoln is telling his name.\r\n\r\n3. Not a word to each other; we kept the great pace--\r\n   Neck by neck, stride by stride, never changing our place;\r\n   I turned in my saddle and made its girths tight,\r\n   Then shortened each stirrup and set the pique right,\r\n   Rebuckled the check strap, chained slacker the bit,\r\n   Nor galloped less steadily Roland a whit.\r\n\r\n4. Oh my dear uncle, you don\'t know the effect of a fine spring morning\r\nupon a fellow just arrived from Russia. The day looked bright, trees\r\nbudding, birds singing, the park so gay, that I took a leap out of your\r\nbalcony, made your deer fly before me like the wind, and chased them all\r\naround the park to get an appetite for breakfast, while you were snoring\r\nin bed, uncle.\r\n\r\n\r\nQuality.--We notice a difference between the soft, insinuating tones of\r\npersuasion; the full, strong voice of command and decision; the harsh,\r\nirregular, and sometimes grating explosion of the sounds of passion; the\r\nplaintive notes of sorrow and pity; and the equable and unimpassioned flow\r\nof words in argumentative style. This difference consists in a variation\r\nin the quality of the voice by which it is adapted to the character of the\r\nthought or sentiment read or spoken. In our attempts to imitate nature,\r\nhowever, it is important that all affectation be avoided, for perfect\r\nmonotony is preferable to this fault. The tones of the voice should be\r\nmade to correspond with the nature of the subject, without apparent\r\neffort.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES. (54)\r\n\r\nPassion and Grief\r\n\r\n   "Come back! come back!" he cried, in grief,\r\n     "Across this stormy water;\r\n   And I\'ll forgive your Highland chief,\r\n     My daughter! O, my daughter!"\r\n\r\n\r\nPlaintive\r\n\r\n   I have lived long enough: my way of life\r\n   Is fallen into the sear, the yellow leaf:\r\n   And that which should accompany old age,\r\n   As honor, love, obedience, troops of friends,\r\n   I must not look to have.\r\n\r\n\r\nCalm\r\n\r\n   A very great portion of this globe is covered\r\n   with water, which is called sea, and is very\r\n   distinct from rivers and lakes.\r\n\r\n\r\nFierce Anger\r\n\r\n   Burned Marmion\'s swarthy cheek like fire,\r\n   And shook his very frame for ire;\r\n     And--"This to me!" he said,--\r\n   "An \'t were not for thy hoary beard,\r\n   Such hand as Marmion\'s had not spared\r\n     To cleave the Douglas\' head!\r\n\r\n\r\nLoud and Explosive\r\n\r\n     "Even in thy pitch of pride,\r\n   Here, in thy hold, thy vassals near,\r\n     I tell thee, thou \'rt defied!\r\n   And if thou said\'st I am not peer\r\n   To any lord in Scotland here,\r\n   Lowland or Highland, far or near,\r\n     Lord Angus, thou hast lied!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. GESTURE. (55)\r\n\r\nGesture is that part of the speaker\'s manner which pertains to his\r\nattitude, to the use and carriage of his person, and the movement of his\r\nlimbs in delivery.\r\n\r\nEvery person, in beginning to speak, feels the natural embarrassment\r\nresulting from his new position. The novelty of the situation destroys his\r\nself-possession, and, with the loss of that, he becomes awkward, his arms\r\nand hands hang clumsily, and now, for the first time, seem to him worse\r\nthan superfluous members. This embarrassment will be overcome gradually,\r\nas the speaker becomes familiar with his position; and it is sometimes\r\novercome at once, by a powerful exercise of the attention upon the matter\r\nof the speech. When that fills and possesses the mind, the orator is\r\nlikely to take the attitude which is becoming, and, at least, easy and\r\nnatural, if not graceful.\r\n\r\n1st. The first general direction that should be given to the speaker is,\r\nthat he should stand erect and firm, and in that posture which gives an\r\nexpanded chest and full play to the organs of respiration and utterance.\r\n\r\n2d. Let the attitude be such that it can be shifted easily and gracefully.\r\nThe student will find, by trial, that no attitude is so favorable to this\r\nend as that in which the weight of the body is thrown upon one leg,\r\nleaving the other free to be advanced or thrown back, as fatigue or the\r\nproper action of delivery may require.\r\n\r\nThe student who has any regard to grace or elegance, will of course avoid\r\nall the gross faults which are so common among public speakers, such as\r\nresting one foot upon a stool or bench, or throwing the body forward upon\r\nthe support of the rostrum.\r\n\r\n3d. Next to attitude, come the movements of the person and limbs. In\r\nthese, two objects are to be observed, and, if possible, combined, viz.,\r\npropriety and grace. There is expression in the extended arm, the clinched\r\nhand, the open palm, and the smiting of the breast. But let no gesture be\r\nmade that is not in harmony with the thought or sentiment uttered; for it\r\nis this harmony which constitutes propriety. As far as possible, let there\r\nbe a correspondence between the style of action and the train of thought.\r\nWhere the thought flows on calmly, let there be grace and ease in gesture\r\nand action. Where the style is sharp and abrupt, there is propriety in\r\nquick, short, and abrupt gesticulation. Especially avoid that ungraceful\r\nsawing of the air with the arms, into which all ill-regulated fervor\r\nbetrays many young speakers.\r\n\r\nWhat is called graceful manner, can only be attained by those who have\r\nsome natural advantages of person. So far as it is in the reach of study\r\nor practice, it seems to depend chiefly upon the general cultivation of\r\nmanners, implying freedom from all embarrassments, and entire\r\nself-possession. The secret of acquiring a graceful style of gesture,\r\nwe apprehend, lies in the habitual practice, not only when speaking but\r\nat all times, of free and graceful movements of the limbs.\r\n\r\nThere is no limb nor feature which the accomplished speaker will not\r\nemploy with effect, in the course of a various and animated delivery. The\r\narms, however, are the chief reliance of the orator in gesture; and it\r\nwill not be amiss to give a hint or two in reference to their proper use.\r\n\r\nFirst--It is not an uncommon fault to use one arm exclusively, and to give\r\nthat a uniform movement. Such movement may, sometimes, have become\r\nhabitual from one\'s profession or employment; but in learners, also, there\r\nis often a predisposition to this fault.\r\n\r\nSecond--It is not unusual to see a speaker use only the lower half of his\r\narm. This always gives a stiff and constrained manner to delivery. Let the\r\nwhole arm move, and let the movement be free and flowing.\r\n\r\nThird--As a general rule, let the hand be open, with the fingers slightly\r\ncurved. It then seems liberal, communicative, and candid; and, in some\r\ndegree, gives that expression to the style of delivery. Of course there\r\nare passages which require the clinched hand, the pointed finger, etc.,\r\netc.; but these are used to give a particular expression.\r\n\r\nFourth--In the movements of the arm, study variety and the grace of curved\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nWhen a gesture is made with one arm only, the eye should be cast in the\r\ndirection of that arm; not at it, but over it.\r\n\r\nAll speakers employ, more or less, the motions of the head. In reference\r\nto that member, we make but one observation. Avoid the continuous shaking\r\nand bobbing of the head, which is so conspicuous in the action of many\r\nambitious public speakers.\r\n\r\nThe beauty and force of all gesture consist in its timely, judicious, and\r\nnatural employment, when it can serve to illustrate the meaning or give\r\nemphasis to the force of an important passage. The usual fault of young\r\nspeakers is too much action. To emphasize all parts alike, is equivalent\r\nto no emphasis; and by employing forcible gestures on unimportant\r\npassages, we diminish our power to render other parts impressive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELOCUTION AND READING. (57)\r\n\r\nThe business of training youth in elocution, must be commenced in\r\nchildhood. The first school is the nursery. There, at least, may be formed\r\na distinct articulation, which is the first requisite for good speaking.\r\nHow rarely is it found in perfection among our orators.\r\n\r\n"Words," says one, referring to articulation, should "be delivered out\r\nfrom the lips, as beautiful coins, newly issued from the mint; deeply and\r\naccurately impressed, perfectly finished; neatly struck by the proper\r\norgans, distinct, in due succession, and of due weight." How rarely do we\r\nhear a speaker whose tongue, teeth, and lips, do their office so perfectly\r\nas to answer to this beautiful description! And the common faults in\r\narticulation, it should be remembered, take their rise from the very\r\nnursery.\r\n\r\nGrace in eloquence, in the pulpit, at the bar, can not be separated from\r\ngrace in the ordinary manners, in private life, in the social circle, in\r\nthe family. It can not well be superinduced upon all the other\r\nacquisitions of youth, any more than that nameless, but invaluable,\r\nquality called good breeding. Begin, therefore, the work of forming the\r\norator with the child; not merely by teaching him to declaim, but what is\r\nof more consequence, by observing and correcting his daily manners,\r\nmotions, and attitudes. You can say, when he comes into your apartment, or\r\npresents you with something, a book or letter, in an awkward and\r\nblundering manner, "Return, and enter this room again," or, "Present me\r\nthat book in a different manner," or, "Put yourself in a different\r\nattitude." You can explain to him the difference between thrusting or\r\npushing out his hand and arm, in straight lines and at acute angles, and\r\nmoving them in flowing circular lines, and easy graceful action. He will\r\nreadily understand you. Nothing is more true than that the motions of\r\nchildren are originally graceful; it is by suffering them to be perverted,\r\nthat we lay the foundation of invincible awkwardness in later life.\r\n\r\nIn schools for children, it ought to be a leading object to teach the art\r\nof reading. It ought to occupy threefold more time than it does. The\r\nteachers of these schools should labor to improve themselves. They should\r\nfeel that to them, for a time, are committed the future orators of the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nIt is better that a girl should return from school a first-rate reader,\r\nthan a first-rate performer on the pianoforte. The accomplishment, in its\r\nperfection, would give more pleasure. The voice of song is not sweeter\r\nthan the voice of eloquence; and there may be eloquent readers, as well as\r\neloquent speakers. We speak of perfection in this art: and it is\r\nsomething, we must say in defense of our preference, which we have never\r\nyet seen. Let the same pains be devoted to reading, as are required to\r\nform an accomplished performer on an instrument; let us have, as the\r\nancients had, the formers of the voice, the music masters of the reading\r\nvoice; let us see years devoted to this accomplishment, and then we should\r\nbe prepared to stand the comparison.\r\n\r\nReading is indeed, a most intellectual accomplishment. So is music, too,\r\nin its perfection. We do by no means undervalue this noble and most\r\ndelightful art, to which Socrates applied himself even in his old age. But\r\none recommendation of the art of reading is, that it requires a constant\r\nexercise of mind. It involves, in its perfection, the whole art of\r\ncriticism on language.

ANECDOTE OF THE DUKE OF NEWCASTLE.\r\n\r\nA laughable story was circulated during the administration of the old Duke\r\nof Newcastle, and retailed to the public in various forms. This nobleman,\r\nwith many good points, was remarkable for being profuse of his promises on\r\nall occasions, and valued himself particularly on being able to anticipate\r\nthe words or the wants of the various persons who attended his levees,\r\nbefore they uttered a word. This sometimes led him into ridiculous\r\nembarrassment; and it was this proneness to lavish promises, which gave\r\noccasion for the following anecdote:\r\n\r\nAt the election of a certain borough in Cornwall, where the opposite\r\ninterests were almost equally poised, a single vote was of the highest\r\nimportance. This object the Duke, by well applied argument and personal\r\napplication, at length attained; and the gentleman he recommended, gained\r\nthe election. In the warmth of gratitude, his grace poured forth\r\nacknowledgments and promises without ceasing, on the fortunate possessor\r\nof the casting vote; called him his best and dearest friend; protested,\r\nthat he should consider himself as forever indebted to him; and that he\r\nwould serve him by night or by day.\r\n\r\nThe Cornish voter, who was an honest fellow, and would not have thought\r\nhimself entitled to any reward, but for such a torrent of acknowledgments,\r\nthanked the Duke for his kindness, and told him the supervisor of excise\r\nwas old and infirm, and, if he would have the goodness to recommend his\r\nson-in-law to the commissioners, in case of the old man\'s death, he should\r\nthink himself and his family bound to render his grace every assistance in\r\ntheir power, on any future occasion.\r\n\r\n"My dear friend, why do you ask for such a trifling employment?" exclaimed\r\nhis grace; "your relative shall have it the moment the place is vacant, if\r\nyou will but call my attention to it."\r\n\r\n"But how shall I get admitted to you, my lord? For in London, I\r\nunderstand, it is a very difficult business to get a sight of you great\r\nfolks, though you are so kind and complaisant to us in the country."\r\n\r\n"The instant the man dies," replied the Duke, "set out posthaste for\r\nLondon; drive directly to my house, and, be it by night or by day, thunder\r\nat the door; I will leave word with my porter to show you upstairs\r\ndirectly; and the employment shall be disposed of according to your\r\nwishes."\r\n\r\nThe parties separated; the Duke drove to a friend\'s house in the\r\nneighborhood, without a wish or desire to see his new acquaintance till\r\nthat day seven years; but the memory of the Cornish elector, not being\r\nburdened with such a variety of objects, was more retentive. The\r\nsupervisor died a few months after, and the Duke\'s humble friend, relying\r\non the word of a peer, was conveyed to London posthaste, and ascended with\r\nalacrity the steps of that nobleman\'s palace.\r\n\r\nThe reader should be informed, that just at this time, no less a person\r\nthan the King of Spain was expected hourly to depart this life, an event\r\nin which the minister of Great Britain was particularly concerned; and the\r\nDuke of Newcastle, on the very night that the proprietor of the decisive\r\nvote arrived at his door, had sat up anxiously expecting dispatches from\r\nMadrid. Wearied by official business and agitated spirits, he retired to\r\nrest, having previously given particular instructions to his porter not to\r\ngo to bed, as he expected every minute a messenger with advices of the\r\ngreatest importance, and desired that he might be shown upstairs, the\r\nmoment of his arrival.\r\n\r\nHis grace was sound asleep; and the porter, settled for the night in his\r\narmchair, had already commenced a sonorous nap, when the vigorous arm of\r\nthe Cornish voter roused him from his slumbers. To his first question, "Is\r\nthe Duke at home?" the porter replied, "Yes, and in bed; but has left\r\nparticular orders that, come when you will, you are to go up to him\r\ndirectly."\r\n\r\n"Bless him, for a worthy and honest gentleman," cried our applicant for\r\nthe vacant post, smiling and nodding with approbation at the prime\r\nminister\'s kindness, "how punctual his grace is; I knew he would not\r\ndeceive me; let me hear no more of lords and dukes not keeping their\r\nwords; I verily believe they are as honest, and mean as well as any other\r\nfolks." Having ascended the stairs as he was speaking, he was ushered into\r\nthe Duke\'s bedchamber.\r\n\r\n"Is he dead?" exclaimed his grace, rubbing his eyes, and scarcely awakened\r\nfrom dreaming of the King of Spain, "Is he dead?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, my lord," replied the eager expectant, delighted to find the\r\nelection promise, with all its circumstances, so fresh in the nobleman\'s\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\n"When did he die?"\r\n\r\n"The day before yesterday, exactly at half past one o\'clock, after being\r\nconfined three weeks to his bed, and taking a power of doctor\'s stuff; and\r\nI hope your grace will be as good as your word, and let my son-in-law\r\nsucceed him."\r\n\r\nThe Duke, by this time perfectly awake, was staggered at the impossibility\r\nof receiving intelligence from Madrid in so short a space of time; and\r\nperplexed at the absurdity of a king\'s messenger applying for his\r\nson-in-law to succeed the King of Spain: "Is the man drunk, or mad? Where\r\nare your dispatches?" exclaimed his grace, hastily drawing back his\r\ncurtain; where, instead of a royal courier, he recognized at the bedside,\r\nthe fat, good-humored countenance of his friend from Cornwall, making low\r\nbows, with hat in hand, and "hoping my lord would not forget the gracious\r\npromise he was so good as to make, in favor of his son-in-law, at the last\r\nelection."\r\n\r\nVexed at so untimely a disturbance, and disappointed of news from Spain,\r\nthe Duke frowned for a moment; but chagrin soon gave way to mirth, at so\r\nsingular and ridiculous a combination of circumstances, and, yielding to\r\nthe impulse, he sunk upon the bed in a violent fit of laughter, which was\r\ncommunicated in a moment to the attendants.\r\n\r\nThe relater of this little narrative, concludes, with observing, "Although\r\nthe Duke of Newcastle could not place the relative of his old acquaintance\r\non the throne of His Catholic Majesty, he advanced him to a post not less\r\nhonorable--he made him an exciseman."\r\n                                                   --Blackwood\'s Magazine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bedroom: The Duke is startled awake, sitting up in bed with\r\ndistressed look on his face.

(67)\r\n\r\nThe gay belles of fashion may boast of excelling\r\n  In waltz or cotillon, at whist or quadrille;\r\nAnd seek admiration by vauntingly telling\r\n  Of drawing, and painting, and musical skill:\r\nBut give me the fair one, in country or city,\r\n  Whose home and its duties are dear to her heart,\r\nWho cheerfully warbles some rustical ditty,\r\n  While plying the needle with exquisite art:\r\nThe bright little needle, the swift-flying needle,\r\n  The needle directed by beauty and art.\r\n\r\nIf Love have a potent, a magical token,\r\n  A talisman, ever resistless and true,\r\nA charm that is never evaded or broken,\r\n  A witchery certain the heart to subdue,\r\n\'T is this; and his armory never has furnished\r\n  So keen and unerring, or polished a dart;\r\nLet beauty direct it, so polished and burnished,\r\n  And oh! it is certain of touching the heart:\r\nThe bright little needle, the swift-flying needle,\r\n  The needle directed by beauty and art.\r\n\r\nBe wise, then, ye maidens, nor seek admiration,\r\n  By dressing for conquest, and flirting with all;\r\nYou never, whate\'er be your fortune or station,\r\n  Appear half so lovely at rout or at ball,\r\nAs gayly convened at the work-covered table,\r\n  Each cheerfully active, playing her part,\r\nBeguiling the task with a song or a fable,\r\n  And plying the needle with exquisite art:\r\nThe bright little needle, the swift-flying needle,\r\n  The needle directed by beauty and art.\r\n                                        --Samuel Woodworth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. DAWN. (68)\r\n\r\nEdward Everett, 1794-1865. He was born at Dorchester, Mass., now a part of\r\nBoston, and graduated from Harvard College with the highest honors of his\r\nclass, at the age of seventeen. While yet in college, he had quite a\r\nreputation as a brilliant writer. Before he was twenty years of age, he\r\nwas settled as pastor over the Brattle Street Church, in Boston, and at\r\nonce became famous as an eloquent preacher. In 1814, he was elected\r\nProfessor of Greek Literature in his Alma Mater; and, in order to prepare\r\nhimself for the duties of his office, he entered on an extended course of\r\ntravel in Europe. He edited the "North American Review," in addition to\r\nthe labors of his professorship, after he returned to America.\r\n\r\nIn 1825, Mr. Everett was elected to Congress, and held his seat in the\r\nHouse for ten years. He was Governor of his native state from 1835 to\r\n1839. In 1841, he was appointed Minister to England. On his return, in\r\n1846, he was chosen President of Harvard University, and held the office\r\nfor three years. In 1852, he was appointed Secretary of State. February\r\n22, 1856, he delivered, in Boston, his celebrated lecture on Washington.\r\nThis lecture was afterwards delivered in most of the principal cities and\r\ntowns in the United States. The proceeds were devoted to the purchase of\r\nMt. Vernon. In 1860, he was a candidate for the Vice Presidency of the\r\nUnited States, He is celebrated as an elegant and forcible writer, and a\r\nchaste orator.\r\n\r\nThis extract, a wonderful piece of word painting, is a portion of an\r\naddress on the "Uses of Astronomy," delivered at the inauguration of the\r\nDudley Observatory, at Albany, N, Y, Note the careful use of words, and\r\nthe strong figures in the third and fourth paragraphs.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nI had occasion, a few weeks since, to take the early train from Providence\r\nto Boston; and for this purpose rose at two o\'clock in the morning.\r\nEverything around was wrapped in darkness and hushed in silence, broken\r\nonly by what seemed at that hour the unearthly clank and rush of the\r\ntrain. It was a mild, serene, midsummer\'s night,--the sky was without a\r\ncloud, the winds were whist. The moon, then in the last quarter, had just\r\nrisen, and the stars shone with a spectral luster but little affected by\r\nher presence.\r\n\r\nJupiter, two hours high, was the herald of the day; the Pleiades, just\r\nabove the horizon, shed their sweet influence in the east; Lyra sparkled\r\nnear the zenith; Andromeda veiled her newly-discovered glories from the\r\nnaked eye in the south; the steady Pointers, far beneath the pole, looked\r\nmeekly up from the depths of the north to their sovereign.\r\n\r\nSuch was the glorious spectacle as I entered the train. As we proceeded,\r\nthe timid approach of twilight became more perceptible; the intense blue\r\nof the sky began to soften; the smaller stars, like little children, went\r\nfirst to rest; the sister beams of the Pleiades soon melted together; but\r\nthe bright constellations of the west and north remained unchanged.\r\nSteadily the wondrous transfiguration went on. Hands of angels, hidden\r\nfrom mortal eyes, shifted the scenery of the heavens; the glories of night\r\ndissolved into the glories of the dawn.\r\n\r\nThe blue sky now turned more softly gray; the great watch stars shut up\r\ntheir holy eyes; the east began to kindle. Faint streaks of purple soon\r\nblushed along the sky; the whole celestial concave was filled with the\r\ninflowing tides of the morning light, which came pouring down from above\r\nin one great ocean of radiance; till at length, as we reached the Blue\r\nHills, a flash of purple fire blazed out from above the horizon, and\r\nturned the dewy teardrops of flower and leaf into rubies and diamonds. In\r\na few seconds, the everlasting gates of the morning were thrown wide open,\r\nand the lord of day, arrayed in glories too severe for the gaze of man,\r\nbegan his state.\r\n\r\nI do not wonder at the superstition of the ancient Magians, who, in the\r\nmorning of the world, went up to the hilltops of Central Asia, and,\r\nignorant of the true God, adored the most glorious work of his hand. But I\r\nam filled with amazement, when I am told, that, in this enlightened age\r\nand in the heart of the Christian world, there are persons who can witness\r\nthis daily manifestation of the power and wisdom of the Creator, and yet\r\nsay in their hearts, "There is no God."\r\n\r\nNotes.--Jupiter, the largest planet of the solar system, and, next to\r\nVenus, the brightest.

DESCRIPTION OF A STORM. (70)\r\n\r\nBenjamin Disraeli. 1805-1881, was of Jewish descent. His ancestors were\r\ndriven out of Spain by the Inquisition, and went to Venice. In 1748, his\r\ngrandfather came to England. His father was Isaac Disraeli, well known as\r\na literary man. Benjamin was born in London, and received his early\r\neducation under his father. He afterwards studied for a lawyer, but soon\r\ngave up his profession for literature. His first novel, "Vivian Grey,"\r\nappeared when the author was twenty-one years of age; it received much\r\nattention. After several defeats he succeeded in an election to\r\nParliament, and took his seat in that body, in the first year of\r\nVictoria\'s reign. On his first attempt to speak in Parliament, the House\r\nrefused to hear him. It is said that, as he sat down, he remarked that the\r\ntime would come when they would hear him. In 1849, he became the leader of\r\nthe Conservative party in the House. During the administration of W. E.\r\nGladstone, Mr. Disraeli was leader of the opposition. In 1868, he became\r\nprime minister, holding the office for a short time. In 1874, he was again\r\nappointed to the same office, where he remained until 1880. His wife was\r\nmade Viscountess of Beaconsfield in 1868. After her death, the title of\r\nEarl of Beaconsfield was conferred on Disraeli. He ranked among the most\r\neminent, statesmen of the age, but always devoted a portion of his time to\r\nliterature. "Lothair," a novel, was published in 1870.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\n* * * They looked round on every side, and hope gave way before the scene\r\nof desolation. Immense branches were shivered from the largest trees;\r\nsmall ones were entirely stripped of their leaves; the long grass was\r\nbowed to the earth; the waters were whirled in eddies out of the little\r\nrivulets; birds, leaving their nests to seek shelter in the crevices of\r\nthe rocks, unable to stem the driving air, flapped their wings and fell\r\nupon the earth; the frightened animals of the plain, almost suffocated by\r\nthe impetuosity of the wind, sought safety and found destruction; some of\r\nthe largest trees were torn up by the roots; the sluices of the mountains\r\nwere filled, and innumerable torrents rushed down the before empty\r\ngullies. The heavens now open, and the lightning and thunder contend with\r\nthe horrors of the wind.\r\n\r\nIn a moment, all was again hushed. Dead silence succeeded the bellow of\r\nthe thunder, the roar of the wind, the rush of the waters, the moaning of\r\nthe beasts, the screaming of the birds. Nothing was heard save the plash\r\nof the agitated lake, as it beat up against the black rocks which girt it\r\nin.\r\n\r\nAgain, greater darkness enveloped the trembling earth. Anon, the heavens\r\nwere rent with lightning, which nothing could have quenched but the\r\ndescending deluge. Cataracts poured down from the lowering firmament. For\r\nan instant, the horses dashed madly forward; beast and rider blinded and\r\nstifled by the gushing rain, and gasping for breath. Shelter was nowhere.\r\nThe quivering beasts reared, and snorted, and sank upon their knees,\r\ndismounting their riders.\r\n\r\nHe had scarcely spoken, when there burst forth a terrific noise, they knew\r\nnot what; a rush, they could not understand; a vibration which shook them\r\non their horses. Every terror sank before the roar of the cataract. It\r\nseemed that the mighty mountain, unable to support its weight of waters,\r\nshook to the foundation. A lake had burst upon its summit, and the\r\ncataract became a falling ocean. The source of the great deep appeared to\r\nbe discharging itself over the range of mountains; the great gray peak\r\ntottered on its foundation!--It shook!--it fell!  and buried in its ruins\r\nthe castle, the village, and the bridge!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. AFTER THE THUNDERSTORM. (72)\r\n\r\nJames Thomson, 1700-1748, the son of a clergyman, was born in Scotland. He\r\nstudied at the University of Edinburgh, and intended to follow the\r\nprofession of his father, but never entered upon the duties of the sacred\r\noffice. In 1724 he went to London, where he spent most of his subsequent\r\nlife. He had shown some poetical talent when it boy; and, in 1826, he\r\npublished "Winter," a part of a longer poem, entitled "The Seasons," the\r\nbest known of all his works. He also wrote several plays for the stage;\r\nnone of them, however, achieved any great success. In the last year of his\r\nlife, he published his "Castle of Indolence," the most famous of his works\r\nexcepting "The Seasons." Thomson was heavy and dull in his personal\r\nappearance, and was indolent in his habits. The moral tone of his writings\r\nis always good. This extract is from "The Seasons."\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\n    As from the face of heaven the shattered clouds\r\n  Tumultuous rove, the interminable sky\r\n  Sublimer swells, and o\'er the world expands\r\n  A purer azure.\r\n\r\n           Through the lightened air\r\n  A higher luster and a clearer calm,\r\n  Diffusive, tremble; while, as if in sign\r\n  Of danger past, a glittering robe of joy,\r\n  Set off abundant by the yellow ray,\r\n  Invests the fields; and nature smiles revived.\r\n\r\n    \'T is beauty all, and grateful song around,\r\n  Joined to the low of kine, and numerous bleat\r\n  Of flocks thick-nibbling through the clovered vale:\r\n  And shall the hymn be marred by thankless man,\r\n  Most favored; who, with voice articulate,\r\n  Should lead the chorus of this lower world?\r\n\r\n    Shall man, so soon forgetful of the Hand\r\n  That hushed the thunder, and serenes the sky,\r\n  Extinguished fed that spark the tempest waked,\r\n  That sense of powers exceeding far his own,\r\n  Ere yet his feeble heart has lost its fears?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. HOUSE CLEANING. (73)\r\n\r\nFrancis Hopkinson, 1737-1791. He was the son of an Englishman; born in\r\nPhiladelphia, and was educated at the college of that city, now the\r\nUniversity of Pennsylvania. He represented New Jersey in the Congress of\r\n1776, and was one of the signers of the Declaration of Independence. He\r\nwas one of the most sensible and elegant writers of his time, and\r\ndistinguished himself both in prose and verse. His lighter writings abound\r\nin humor and keen satire; his more solid writings are marked by clearness\r\nand good sense. His pen did much to forward the cause of American\r\nindependence. His "Essay on Whitewashing," from which the following\r\nextract is taken, was mistaken for the composition of Dr. Franklin, and\r\npublished among his writings, It was originally in the form of "A Letter\r\nfrom a Gentleman in America to his Friend in Europe, on Whitewashing."\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no season of the year in which the lady may not, if she pleases,\r\nclaim her privilege; but the latter end of May is generally fixed upon for\r\nthe purpose. The attentive husband may judge, by certain prognostics, when\r\nthe storm is at hand. If the lady grows uncommonly fretful, finds fault\r\nwith the servants, is discontented with the children, and complains much\r\nof the nastiness of everything about her, these are symptoms which ought\r\nnot to be neglected, yet they sometimes go off without any further effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nBut if, when the husband rises in the morning, he should observe in the\r\nyard a wheelbarrow with a quantity of lime in it, or should see certain\r\nbuckets filled with a solution of lime in water, there is no time for\r\nhesitation. He immediately locks up the apartment or closet where his\r\npapers and private property are kept, and, putting the key into his\r\npocket, betakes himself to flight. A husband, however beloved, becomes a\r\nperfect nuisance during this season of female rage. His authority is\r\nsuperseded, his commission suspended, and the very scullion who cleans the\r\nbrasses in the kitchen becomes of more importance than he. He has nothing\r\nfor it but to abdicate for a time, and run from an evil which he can\r\nneither prevent nor mollify.\r\n\r\nThe husband gone, the ceremony begins. The walls are stripped of their\r\nfurniture--paintings, prints, and looking-glasses lie huddled in heaps\r\nabout the floors; the curtains are torn from their testers, the beds\r\ncrammed into windows, chairs and tables, bedsteads and cradles, crowd the\r\nyard, and the garden fence bends beneath the weight of carpets, blankets,\r\ncloth cloaks, old coats, under petticoats, and ragged breeches. Here may\r\nbe seen the lumber of the kitchen, forming a dark and confused mass for\r\nthe foreground of the picture; gridirons and frying pans, rusty shovels\r\nand broken tongs, joint stools, and the fractured remains of rush-bottomed\r\nchairs. There a closet has disgorged its bowels--riveted plates and\r\ndishes, halves of china bowls, cracked tumblers, broken wineglasses,\r\nphials of forgotten physic, papers of unknown powders, seeds and dried\r\nherbs, tops of teapots, and stoppers of departed decanters--from the rag\r\nhole in the garret, to the rat hole in the cellar, no place escapes\r\nunrummaged. It would seem as if the day of general doom had come, and the\r\nutensils of the house were dragged forth to judgment.\r\n\r\nIn this tempest, the words of King Lear unavoidably present themselves,\r\nand might, with little alteration, be made strictly applicable.\r\n\r\n\r\n  "Let the great gods,\r\n  That keep this dreadful pother o\'er our heads,\r\n  Find out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch,\r\n  That hast within thee undivulged crimes\r\n  Unwhipp\'d of justice.\r\n                       Close pent-up guilts,\r\n  Rive your concealing continents, and cry\r\n  These dreadful summoners grace."\r\n\r\n\r\nThis ceremony completed, and the house thoroughly evacuated, the next\r\noperation is to smear the walls and ceilings with brushes dipped into a\r\nsolution of lime, called whitewash; to pour buckets of water over every\r\nfloor; and scratch all the partitions and wainscots with hard brushes,\r\ncharged with soft soap and stonecutters\' sand.\r\n\r\nThe windows by no means escape the general deluge. A servant scrambles out\r\nupon the penthouse, at the risk of her neck, and, with a mug in her hand\r\nand a bucket within reach, dashes innumerable gallons of water against the\r\nglass panes, to the great annoyance of passengers in the street.\r\n\r\nI have been told that an action at law was once brought against one of\r\nthese water nymphs, by a person who had a new suit of clothes spoiled by\r\nthis operation: but after long argument, it was determined that no damages\r\ncould be awarded; inasmuch as the defendant was in the exercise of a legal\r\nright, and not answerable for the consequences. And so the poor gentleman\r\nwas doubly non-suited; for he lost both his suit of clothes and his suit\r\nat law.\r\n\r\nThese smearings and scratchings, these washings and dashings, being duly\r\nperformed, the next ceremonial is to cleanse and replace the distracted\r\nfurniture. You may have seen a house raising, or a ship launch--\r\nrecollect, if you can, the hurry, bustle, confusion, and noise of such a\r\nscene, and you will have some idea of this cleansing match. The misfortune\r\nis, that the sole object is to make things clean. It matters not how many\r\nuseful, ornamental, or valuable articles suffer mutilation or death under\r\nthe operation. A mahogany chair and a carved frame undergo the same\r\ndiscipline; they are to be made clean at all events; but their\r\npreservation is not worthy of attention.\r\n\r\nFor instance: a fine large engraving is laid flat upon the floor; a number\r\nof smaller prints are piled upon it, until the superincumbent weight\r\ncracks the lower glass--but this is of no importance. A valuable picture\r\nis placed leaning against the sharp corner of a table; others are made to\r\nlean against that, till the pressure of the whole forces the corner of the\r\ntable through the canvas of the first. The frame and glass of a fine print\r\nare to be cleaned; the spirit and oil used on this occasion are suffered\r\nto leak through and deface the engraving--no matter. If the glass is clean\r\nand the frame shines, it is sufficient--the rest is not worthy of\r\nconsideration. An able arithmetician hath made a calculation, founded on\r\nlong experience, and proved that the losses and destruction incident to\r\ntwo white washings are equal to one removal, and three removals equal to\r\none fire.\r\n\r\nThis cleansing frolic over, matters begin to resume their pristine\r\nappearance: the storm abates, and all would be well again; but it is\r\nimpossible that so great a convulsion in so small a community should pass\r\nover without producing some consequences. For two or three weeks after the\r\noperation, the family are usually afflicted with sore eyes, sore throats,\r\nor severe colds, occasioned by exhalations from wet floors and damp walls.\r\n\r\n\r\nI know a gentleman here who is fond of accounting for everything in a\r\nphilosophical way. He considers this, what I call a custom, as a real\r\nperiodical disease peculiar to the climate. His train of reasoning is\r\nwhimsical and ingenious, but I am not at leisure to give you the detail.\r\nThe result was, that he found the distemper to be incurable; but after\r\nmuch study, he thought he had discovered a method to divert the evil he\r\ncould not subdue. For this purpose, he caused a small building, about\r\ntwelve feet square, to be erected in his garden, and furnished with some\r\nordinary chairs and tables, and a few prints of the cheapest sort. His\r\nhope was, that when the whitewashing frenzy seized the females of his\r\nfamily, they might repair to this apartment, and scrub, and scour, and\r\nsmear to their hearts\' content; and so spend the violence of the disease\r\nin this outpost, whilst he enjoyed himself in quiet at headquarters. But\r\nthe experiment did not answer his expectation. It was impossible it\r\nshould, since a principal part of the gratification consists in the lady\'s\r\nhaving an uncontrolled right to torment her husband at least once in every\r\nyear; to turn him out of doors, and take the reins of government into her\r\nown hands.\r\n\r\nThere is a much better contrivance than this of the philosopher\'s; which\r\nis, to cover the walls of the house with paper. This is generally done.\r\nAnd though it does not abolish, it at least shortens the period of female\r\ndominion. This paper is decorated with various fancies; and made so\r\nornamental that the women have admitted the fashion without perceiving the\r\ndesign.\r\n\r\nThere is also another alleviation to the husband\'s distress. He generally\r\nhas the sole use of a small room or closet for his books and papers, the\r\nkey of which he is allowed to keep. This is considered as a privileged\r\nplace, even in the whitewashing season, and stands like the land of Goshen\r\namidst the plagues of Egypt. But then he must be extremely cautious, and\r\never upon his guard; for, should he inadvertently go abroad and leave the\r\nkey in his door, the housemaid, who is always on the watch for such an\r\nopportunity, immediately enters in triumph with buckets, brooms, and\r\nbrushes--takes possession of the premises, and forthwith puts an his books\r\nand papers "to rights," to his utter confusion, and sometimes serious\r\ndetriment.\r\n\r\nNotes.--Lear.--The reference is to Shakespeare\'s tragedy, Act III, Scene\r\n2.\r\n\r\nGoshen.--The portion of Egypt settled by Jacob and his family.

(78)\r\n\r\nSamuel Johnson, 1700-1784. This truly remarkable man was the son of a\r\nbookseller and stationer; he was born in Lichfield, Staffordshire,\r\nEngland. He entered Pembroke College, Oxford, in 1728; but, at the end of\r\nthree years, his poverty compelled him to leave without taking his degree.\r\nIn 1736, he married Mrs. Porter, a widow of little culture, much older\r\nthan himself, but possessed of some property. The marriage seems to have\r\nbeen a happy one, nevertheless; and, on the death of his wife, in 1752,\r\nJohnson mourned for her, most sincerely. Soon after his marriage, he\r\nopened a private school, but, obtained only three pupils, one of whom was\r\nDavid Garrick, afterward the celebrated actor. In 1737, he removed to\r\nLondon, where he lived for most of the remainder of his life. Here he\r\nentered upon literary work, in which he continued, and from which he\r\nderived his chief support, although at times it was but a meager one, His\r\n"Vanity of Human Wishes" was sold for ten guineas. His great Dictionary,\r\nthe first one of the English language worthy of mention, brought him\r\n1575 Pounds, and occupied his time for seven years. Most of the money he\r\nreceived for the work went to pay his six amanuenses. The other most\r\nfamous of his numerous literary works are "The Rambler," "Rasselas," "The\r\nLives of the English Poets," and his edition of Shakespeare. In person,\r\nJohnson was heavy and awkward; he was the victim of scrofula in his youth,\r\nand of dropsy in his old age. In manner, he was boorish and overbearing;\r\nbut his great powers and his wisdom caused his company to be sought by\r\nmany eminent men of his time.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nOmar, the son of Hassan, had passed seventy-five years in honor and\r\nprosperity. The favor of three successive caliphs had filled his house\r\nwith gold and silver; and whenever he appeared, the benedictions of the\r\npeople proclaimed his passage.\r\n\r\nTerrestrial happiness is of short continuance, The brightness of the flame\r\nis wasting its fuel; the fragrant flower is passing away in its own odors.\r\nThe vigor of Omar began to fail; the curls of beauty fell from his head;\r\nstrength departed from his hands, and agility from his feet. He gave back\r\nto the caliph the keys of trust, and the seals of secrecy; and sought no\r\nother pleasure for the remainder of life than the converse of the wise and\r\nthe gratitude of the good.\r\n\r\nThe powers of his mind were yet unimpaired. His chamber was filled by\r\nvisitants, eager to catch the dictates of experience, and officious to pay\r\nthe tribute of admiration. Caleb, the son of the viceroy of Egypt, entered\r\nevery day early, and retired late. He was beautiful and eloquent; Omar\r\nadmired his wit, and loved his docility.\r\n\r\n"Tell me," said Caleb, "thou to whose voice nations have listened, and\r\nwhose wisdom is known to the extremities of Asia, tell me, how I may\r\nresemble Omar the prudent? The arts by which thou hast gained power and\r\npreserved it, are to thee no longer necessary or useful; impart to me the\r\nsecret of thy conduct, and teach me the plan upon which thy wisdom has\r\nbuilt thy fortune."\r\n\r\n"Young man," said Omar, "it is of little use to form plans of life. When I\r\ntook my first survey of the world, in my twentieth year, having considered\r\nthe various conditions of mankind, in the hour of solitude I said thus to\r\nmyself, leaning against a cedar which spread its branches over my head:\r\n\'Seventy years are allowed to man; I have yet fifty remaining.\r\n\r\n" \'Ten years I will allot to the attainment of knowledge, and ten I will\r\npass in foreign countries; I shall be learned, and therefore I shall be\r\nhonored; every city will shout at my arrival, and every student will\r\nsolicit my friendship. Twenty years thus passed will store my mind with\r\nimages which I shall be busy through the rest of my life in combining and\r\ncomparing. I shall revel in inexhaustible accumulations of intellectual\r\nriches; I shall find new pleasures for every moment, and shall never more\r\nbe weary of myself.\r\n\r\n" \'I will not, however, deviate too far from the beaten track of life; but\r\nwill try what can be found in female delicacy. I will marry a wife as\r\nbeautiful as the houries, and wise as Zobeide; and with her I will live\r\ntwenty years within the suburbs of Bagdad, in every pleasure that wealth\r\ncan purchase, and fancy can invent.\r\n\r\n" \'I will then retire to a rural dwelling, pass my days in obscurity and\r\ncontemplation; and lie silently down on the bed of death. Through my life\r\nit shall be my settled resolution, that I will never depend on the smile\r\nof princes; that I will never stand exposed to the artifices of courts; I\r\nwill never pant for public honors, nor disturb my quiet with the affairs\r\nof state.\' Such was my scheme of life, which I impressed indelibly upon my\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\n"The first part of my ensuing time was to be spent in search of knowledge,\r\nand I know not how I was diverted from my design. I had no visible\r\nimpediments without, nor any ungovernable passion within. I regarded\r\nknowledge as the highest honor, and the most engaging pleasure; yet day\r\nstole upon day, and month glided after month, till I found that seven\r\nyears of the first ten had vanished, and left nothing behind them.\r\n\r\n"I now postponed my purpose of traveling; for why should I go abroad,\r\nwhile so much remained to be learned at home? I immured myself for four\r\nyears, and studied the laws of the empire. The fame of my skill reached\r\nthe judges: I was found able to speak upon doubtful questions, and I was\r\ncommanded to stand at the footstool of the caliph. I was heard with\r\nattention; I was consulted with confidence, and the love of praise\r\nfastened on my heart.\r\n\r\n"I still wished to see distant countries; listened with rapture to the\r\nrelations of travelers, and resolved some time to ask my dismission, that\r\nI might feast my soul with novelty; but my presence was always necessary,\r\nand the stream of business hurried me along. Sometimes, I was afraid lest\r\nI should be charged with ingratitude; but I still proposed to travel, and\r\ntherefore would not confine myself by marriage.\r\n\r\n"In my fiftieth year, I began to suspect that the time of my traveling was\r\npast; and thought it best to lay hold on the felicity yet in my power, and\r\nindulge myself in domestic pleasures. But, at fifty, no man easily finds a\r\nwoman beautiful as the houries, and wise as Zobeide. I inquired and\r\nrejected, consulted and deliberated, till the sixty-second year made me\r\nashamed of wishing to marry. I had now nothing left but retirement; and\r\nfor retirement I never found a time, till disease forced me from public\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\n"Such was my scheme, and such has been its consequence. With an insatiable\r\nthirst for knowledge, I trifled away the years of improvement; with a\r\nrestless desire of seeing different countries, I have always resided in\r\nthe same city; with the highest expectation of connubial felicity, I have\r\nlived unmarried; and with an unalterable resolution of contemplative\r\nretirement, I am going to die within the walls of Bagdad."\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes.--Bag dad\'--A large city of Asiatic Turkey, on the river Tigris.\r\n\r\nIn the ninth century, it was the greatest center of Moslem power and\r\nlearning.\r\n\r\nZobeide (Zo-bad\').--A lady of Bagdad, whose story is given in the "Three\r\nCalendars" of the "Arabian Nights."\r\n\r\nIn this selection the form of an allegory is used to express a general\r\ntruth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. THE BRAVE OLD OAK. (81)\r\n\r\nHenry Fothergill Chorley, 1808-1872. He is known chiefly as a musical\r\ncritic and author; for thirty-eight years he was connected with the\r\n"London Athenaeum." His books are mostly novels.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nA song to the oak, the brave old oak,\r\n  Who hath ruled in the greenwood long;\r\nHere\'s health and renown to his broad green crown,\r\n  And his fifty arms so strong.\r\nThere\'s fear in his frown, when the sun goes down,\r\n  And the fire in the west fades out;\r\nAnd he showeth his might on a wild midnight,\r\n  When the storms through his branches shout.\r\n\r\nIn the days of old, when the spring with cold\r\n  Had brightened his branches gray,\r\nThrough the grass at his feet, crept maidens sweet,\r\n  To gather the dews of May.\r\nAnd on that day, to the rebec gay\r\n  They frolicked with lovesome swains;\r\nThey are gone, they are dead, in the churchyard laid,\r\n  But the tree--it still remains.\r\n\r\nHe saw rare times when the Christmas chimes\r\n  Were a merry sound to hear,\r\nWhen the Squire\'s wide hall and the cottage small\r\n  Were filled with good English cheer.\r\nNow gold hath the sway we all obey,\r\n  And a ruthless king is he;\r\nBut he never shall send our ancient friend\r\n  To be tossed on the stormy sea.\r\n\r\nThen here\'s to the oak, the brave old oak,\r\n  Who stands in his pride alone;\r\nAnd still flourish he, a hale green tree,\r\n  When a hundred years are gone.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. THE ARTIST SURPRISED. (82)\r\n\r\nIt may not be known to all the admirers of the genius of Albert Durer,\r\nthat that famous engraver was endowed with a "better half," so peevish in\r\ntemper, that she was the torment not only of his own life, but also of his\r\npupils and domestics. Some of the former were cunning enough to purchase\r\npeace for themselves by conciliating the common tyrant, but woe to those\r\nunwilling or unable to offer aught in propitiation. Even the wiser ones\r\nwere spared only by having their offenses visited upon a scapegoat.\r\n\r\nThis unfortunate individual was Samuel Duhobret, a disciple whom Durer had\r\nadmitted into his school out of charity. He was employed in painting signs\r\nand the coarser tapestry then used in Germany. He was about forty years of\r\nage, little, ugly, and humpbacked; he was the butt of every ill joke among\r\nhis fellow disciples, and was picked out as an object of especial dislike\r\nby Madame Durer. But he bore all with patience, and ate, without\r\ncomplaint, the scanty crusts given him every day for dinner, while his\r\ncompanions often fared sumptuously.\r\n\r\nPoor Samuel had not a spice of envy or malice in his heart. He would, at\r\nany time, have toiled half the night to assist or serve those who were\r\nwont oftenest to laugh at him, or abuse him loudest for his stupidity.\r\nTrue, he had not the qualities of social humor or wit, but he was an\r\nexample of indefatigable industry. He came to his studies every morning at\r\ndaybreak, and remained at work until sunset. Then he retired into his\r\nlonely chamber, and wrought for his own amusement.\r\n\r\nDuhobret labored three years in this way, giving himself no time for\r\nexercise or recreation. He said nothing to a single human being of the\r\npaintings he had produced in the solitude of his cell, by the light of his\r\nlamp. But his bodily energies wasted and declined under incessant toil.\r\nThere was none sufficiently interested in the poor artist, to mark the\r\nfeverish hue of his wrinkled cheek, or the increasing attenuation of his\r\nmisshapen frame.\r\n\r\nNone observed that the uninviting pittance set aside for his midday\r\nrepast, remained for several days untouched. Samuel made his appearance\r\nregularly as ever, and bore with the same meekness the gibes of his\r\nfellow-pupils, or the taunts of Madame Durer, and worked with the same\r\nuntiring assiduity, though his hands would sometimes tremble, and his eyes\r\nbecome suffused, a weakness probably owing to the excessive use he had\r\nmade of them.\r\n\r\nOne morning Duhobret was missing at the scene of his daily labors. His\r\nabsence created much remark, and many were the jokes passed upon the\r\noccasion. One surmised this, and another that, as the cause of the\r\nphenomenon; and it was finally agreed that the poor fellow must have\r\nworked himself into an absolute skeleton, and taken his final stand in the\r\nglass frame of some apothecary, or been blown away by a puff of wind,\r\nwhile his door happened to stand open. No on thought of going to his\r\nlodgings to look after him or his remains.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the object of their mirth was tossing on a bed of sickness.\r\nDisease, which had been slowly sapping the foundations of his strength,\r\nburned in every vein; his eyes rolled and flashed in delirium; his lips,\r\nusually so silent, muttered wild and incoherent words. In his days of\r\nhealth, poor Duhobret had his dreams, as all artists, rich or poor, will\r\nsometimes have. He had thought that the fruit of many years\' labor,\r\ndisposed of to advantage, might procure him enough to live, in an\r\neconomical way, for the rest of his life. He never anticipated fame or\r\nfortune; the height of his ambition or hope was, to possess a tenement\r\nlarge enough to shelter him from the inclemencies of the weather, with\r\nmeans enough to purchase one comfortable meal per day.\r\n\r\nNow, alas! however, even that one hope had deserted him. He thought\r\nhimself dying, and thought it hard to die without one to look kindly upon\r\nhim, without the words of comfort that might soothe his passage to another\r\nworld. He fancied his bed surrounded by fiendish faces, grinning at his\r\nsufferings, and taunting his inability to summon power to disperse them.\r\nAt length the apparition faded away, and the patient sunk into an\r\nexhausted slumber.\r\n\r\nHe awoke unrefreshed; it was the fifth day he had lain there neglected.\r\nHis mouth was parched; he turned over, and feebly stretched out his hand\r\ntoward the earthen pitcher, from which, since the first day of his illness\r\nhe had quenched his thirst. Alas! it was empty! Samuel lay for a few\r\nmoments thinking what he should do. He knew he must die of want if he\r\nremained there alone; but to whom could he apply for aid?\r\n\r\nAn idea seemed, at last, to strike him. He arose slowly, and with\r\ndifficulty, from the bed, went to the other side of the room, and took up\r\nthe picture he had painted last. He resolved to carry it to the shop of a\r\nsalesman, and hoped to obtain for it sufficient to furnish him with the\r\nnecessaries of life for a week longer. Despair lent him strength to walk,\r\nand to carry his burden. On his way, he passed a house, about which there\r\nwas a crowd. He drew nigh, asked what was going on, and received for an\r\nanswer, that there was to be a sale of many specimens of art, collected by\r\nan amateur in the course of thirty years. It has often happened that\r\ncollections made with infinite pains by the proprietor, have been sold\r\nwithout mercy or discrimination after his death.\r\n\r\nSomething whispered to the weary Duhobret, that here would be the market\r\nfor his picture. It was a long way yet to the house of the picture dealer,\r\nand he made up his mind at once. He worked his way through the crowd,\r\ndragged himself up the steps, and, after many inquiries, found the\r\nauctioneer. That personage was a busy man, with a handful of papers; he\r\nwas inclined to notice somewhat roughly the interruption of the lean,\r\nsallow hunchback, imploring as were his gesture and language.\r\n\r\n"What do you call your picture?" at length, said he, carefully looking at\r\nit.\r\n\r\n"It is a view of the Abbey of Newburg, with its village and the\r\nsurrounding landscape," replied the eager and trembling artist.\r\n\r\nThe auctioneer again scanned it contemptuously, and asked what it was\r\nworth. "Oh, that is what you please; whatever it will bring," answered\r\nDuhobret.\r\n\r\n"Hem! it is too odd to please, I should think; I can promise you no more\r\nthan three thalers."\r\n\r\nPoor Samuel sighed deeply. He had spent on that piece the nights of many\r\nmonths. But he was starving now; and the pitiful sum offered would give\r\nbread for a few days. He nodded his head to the auctioneer, and retiring\r\ntook his seat in a corner.\r\n\r\nThe sale began. After some paintings and engravings had been disposed of,\r\nSamuel\'s was exhibited. "Who bids at three thalers? Who bids?" was the\r\ncry. Duhobret listened eagerly, but none answered. "Will it find a\r\npurchaser?" said he despondingly, to himself. Still there was a dead\r\nsilence. He dared not look up; for it seemed to him that all the people\r\nwere laughing at the folly of the artist, who could be insane enough to\r\noffer so worthless a piece at a public sale.\r\n\r\n"What will become of me?" was his mental inquiry. "That work is certainly\r\nmy best;" and he ventured to steal another glance. "Does it not seem that\r\nthe wind actually stirs those boughs and moves those leaves! How\r\ntransparent is the water! What life breathes in the animals that quench\r\ntheir thirst at that spring! How that steeple shines! How beautiful are\r\nthose clustering trees!" This was the last expiring throb of an artist\'s\r\nvanity. The ominous silence continued, and Samuel, sick at heart, buried\r\nhis face in his hands.\r\n\r\n"Twenty-one thalers!" murmured a faint voice, just as the auctioneer was\r\nabout to knock down the picture. The stupefied painter gave a start of\r\njoy. He raised his head and looked to see from whose lips those blessed\r\nwords had come. It was the picture dealer, to whom he had first thought of\r\napplying.\r\n\r\n"Fifty thalers," cried a sonorous voice. This time a tall man in black was\r\nthe speaker. There was a silence of hushed expectation. "One hundred\r\nthalers," at length thundered the picture dealer.\r\n\r\n"Three hundred!" "Five hundred!" "One thousand!" Another profound silence,\r\nand the crowd pressed around the two opponents, who stood opposite each\r\nother with eager and angry looks.\r\n\r\n"Two thousand thalers!" cried the picture dealer, and glanced around him\r\ntriumphantly, when he saw his adversary hesitate. "Ten thousand!"\r\nvociferated the tall man, his face crimson with rage, and his hands\r\nclinched convulsively. The dealer grew paler; his frame shook with\r\nagitation; he made two or three efforts, and at last cried out "Twenty\r\nthousand!"\r\n\r\nHis tall opponent was not to be vanquished. He bid forty thousand. The\r\ndealer stopped; the other laughed a low laugh of insolent triumph, and a\r\nmurmur of admiration was heard in the crowd. It was too much for the\r\ndealer; he felt his peace was at stake. "Fifty thousand!" exclaimed he in\r\ndesperation. It was the tall man\'s turn to hesitate. Again the whole crowd\r\nwere breathless. At length, tossing his arms in defiance, he shouted "One\r\nhundred thousand!" The crestfallen picture dealer withdrew; the tall man\r\nvictoriously bore away the prize.\r\n\r\nHow was it, meanwhile, with Duhobret, while this exciting scene was going\r\non? He was hardly master of his senses. He rubbed his eyes repeatedly, and\r\nmurmured to himself, "After such a dream, my misery will seem more cruel!"\r\nWhen the contest ceased, he rose up bewildered, and went about asking\r\nfirst one, then another, the price of the picture just sold. It seemed\r\nthat his apprehension could not at once be enlarged to so vast a\r\nconception.\r\n\r\nThe possessor was proceeding homeward, when a decrepit, lame, and\r\nhumpbacked invalid, tottering along by the aid of a stick, presented\r\nhimself before him. He threw him a piece of money, and waved his hand as\r\ndispensing with his thanks. "May it please your honor," said the supposed\r\nbeggar, "I am the painter of that picture!" and again he rubbed his eyes.\r\n\r\nThe tall mall was Count Dunkelsback, one of the richest noblemen in\r\nGermany. He stopped, took out his pocketbook, took out a leaf, and wrote\r\non it a few lines. "Take it, friend," said he; "it is a check for your\r\nmoney. Adieu."\r\n\r\nDuhobret finally persuaded himself that it was not a dream. He became the\r\nmaster of a castle, sold it, and resolved to live luxuriously for the rest\r\nof his life, and to cultivate painting as a pastime. But, alas, for the\r\nvanity of human expectation! He had borne privation and toil; prosperity\r\nwas too much for him, as was proved soon after, when an indigestion\r\ncarried him off. His picture remained long in the cabinet of Count\r\nDunkelsback, and afterward passed into the possession of the King of\r\nBavaria.\r\n\r\nNotes.--Albert Durer (b. 1471, d. 1528) lived at Nuremburg, Germany. He\r\nwas eminent as a painter, and as an engraver on copper and wood. He was\r\none of the first artists who studied anatomy and perspective. His\r\ninfluence on art is clearly felt even at the present day.\r\n\r\nNewburg, or Neuburg, is on the Danube, fifty miles south of Nuremburg.\r\nBergen Abbey was north of the village.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX. PICTURES OF MEMORY. (88)\r\n\r\nAlice Cary, 1820-1871, was born near Cincinnati. One of her ancestors was\r\namong the "Pilgrim Fathers," and the first instructor of Latin at\r\nPlymouth, Mass. Miss Cary commenced her literary career at her western\r\nhome, and, in 1849, published a volume of poems, the joint work of her\r\nyounger sister, Phoebe, and herself. In 1850, she moved to New York. Two\r\nof her sisters joined her there, and they supported themselves by their\r\nliterary labor. Their home became a noted resort for their literary and\r\nartistic friends. Miss Cary was the author of eleven volumes, besides many\r\narticles contributed to periodicals. Her poetry is marked with great\r\nsweetness and pathos. Some of her prose works are much admired, especially\r\nher "Clovernook Children."\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the beautiful pictures\r\n  That hang on Memory\'s wall,\r\nIs one of a dim old forest,\r\n  That seemeth best of all;\r\nNot for its gnarled oaks olden,\r\n  Dark with the mistletoe;\r\nNot for the violets golden,\r\n  That sprinkle the vale below;\r\nNot for the milk-white lilies,\r\n  That lean from the fragrant hedge,\r\nCoquetting all day with the sunbeams,\r\n  And stealing their golden edge;\r\nNot for the vines on the upland,\r\n  Where the bright red berries rest,\r\nNor the pinks, nor the pale, sweet cowslip,\r\n  It seemeth to me the best.\r\n\r\nI once had a little brother,\r\n  With eyes that were dark and deep;\r\nIn the lap of that dim old forest,\r\n  He lieth in peace asleep:\r\nLight as the down of the thistle,\r\n  Free as the winds that blow,\r\nWe roved there the beautiful summers,\r\n  The summers of long ago;\r\nBut his feet on the hills grew weary,\r\n  And, one of the autumn eves,\r\nI made for my little brother,\r\n  A bed of the yellow leaves.\r\n\r\nSweetly his pale arms folded\r\n  My neck in a meek embrace,\r\nAs the light of immortal beauty\r\n  Silently covered his face;\r\nAnd when the arrows of sunset\r\n  Lodged in the tree tops bright,\r\nHe fell, in his saintlike beauty,\r\n  Asleep by the gates of light.\r\nTherefore, of all the pictures\r\n  That hang on Memory\'s wall,\r\nThe one of the dim old forest\r\n  Seemeth the best of all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI. THE MORNING ORATORIO. (90)\r\n\r\nWilson Flagg, 1806-1884, was born in Beverly, Mass. He pursued his\r\nacademical course in Andover, at Phillips Academy, and entered Harvard\r\nCollege, but did not graduate. His chief Works are: "Studies in the Field\r\nand Forest," "The Woods and Byways of New England," and "The Birds and\r\nSeasons of New England."\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nNature, for the delight of waking eyes, has arrayed the morning heavens in\r\nthe loveliest hues of beauty. Fearing to dazzle by an excess of delight,\r\nshe first announces day by a faint and glimmering twilight, then sheds a\r\npurple tint over the brows of the rising morn, and infuses a transparent\r\nruddiness throughout the atmosphere. As daylight widens, successive groups\r\nof mottled and rosy-bosomed clouds assemble on the gilded sphere, and,\r\ncrowned with wreaths of fickle rainbows, spread a mirrored flush over\r\nhill, grove, and lake, and every village spire is burnished with their\r\nsplendor.\r\n\r\nAt length, through crimsoned vapors, we behold the sun\'s broad disk,\r\nrising with a countenance so serene that every eye may view him ere he\r\narrays himself in his meridian brightness. Not many people who live in\r\ntowns are aware of the pleasure attending a ramble near the woods and\r\norchards at daybreak in the early part of summer. The drowsiness we feel\r\non rising from our beds is gradually dispelled by the clear and healthful\r\nbreezes of early day, and we soon experience an unusual amount of vigor\r\nand elasticity.\r\n\r\nDuring the night, the stillness of all things is the circumstance that\r\nmost powerfully attracts our notice, rendering us peculiarly sensitive to\r\nevery accidental sound that meets the ear. In the morning, at this time of\r\nyear, on the contrary, we are overpowered by the vocal and multitudinous\r\nchorus of the feathered tribe. If you would hear the commencement of this\r\ngrand anthem of nature, you must rise at the very first appearance of\r\ndawn, before the twilight has formed a complete semicircle above the\r\neastern porch of heaven.\r\n\r\nThe first note that proceeds from the little warbling host, is the shrill\r\nchirp of the hairbird,--occasionally vocal at an hours on a warm summer\r\nnight. This strain, which is a continued trilling sound, is repeated with\r\ndiminishing intervals, until it becomes almost incessant. But ere the\r\nhairbird has uttered many notes, a single robin begins to warble from a\r\nneighboring orchard, soon followed by others, increasing in numbers until,\r\nby the time the eastern sky is flushed with crimson, every male, robin in\r\nthe country round is singing with fervor.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to note the exact order in which the different birds\r\nsuccessively begin their parts in this performance; but the bluebird,\r\nwhose song is only a short, mellow warble, is heard nearly at the same\r\ntime with the robin, and the song sparrow joins them soon after with his\r\nbrief but finely modulated strain. The different species follow rapidly,\r\none after another, in the chorus, until the whole welkin rings with their\r\nmatin hymn of gladness.\r\n\r\nI have often wondered that the almost simultaneous utterance of so many\r\ndifferent notes should produce no discords, and that they should result in\r\nsuch complete harmony. In this multitudinous confusion of voices, no two\r\nnotes are confounded, and none has sufficient duration to grate harshly\r\nwith a dissimilar sound. Though each performer sings only a few strains\r\nand then makes a pause, the whole multitude succeed one another with such\r\nrapidity that we hear an uninterrupted flow of music until the broad light\r\nof day invites them to other employments.\r\n\r\nWhen there is just light enough to distinguish the birds, we may observe,\r\nhere and there, a single swallow perched on the roof of a barn or shed,\r\nrepeating two twittering notes incessantly, with a quick turn and a hop at\r\nevery note he utters. It would seem to be the design of the bird to\r\nattract the attention of his mate, and this motion seems to be made to\r\nassist her in discovering his position. As soon as the light has tempted\r\nhim to fly abroad, this twittering strain is uttered more like a continued\r\nsong, as he flits rapidly through the air.\r\n\r\nBut at this later moment the purple martins have commenced their more\r\nmelodious chattering, so loud as to attract for a while the most of our\r\nattention. There is not a sound in nature so cheering and animating as the\r\nsong of the purple martin, and none so well calculated to drive away\r\nmelancholy. Though not one of the earliest voices to be heard, the chorus\r\nis perceptibly more loud and effective when this bird has united with the\r\nchoir.\r\n\r\nWhen the flush of the morning has brightened into vermilion, and the place\r\nfrom which the sun is soon to emerge has attained a dazzling brilliancy,\r\nthe robins are already less tuneful. They are now becoming busy in\r\ncollecting food for their morning repast, and one by one they leave the\r\ntrees, and may be seen hopping upon the tilled ground, in quest of the\r\nworms and insects that, have crept out during the night from their\r\nsubterranean retreats.\r\n\r\nBut as the robins grow silent, the bobolinks begin their vocal revelries;\r\nand to a fanciful mind it might seem that the robins had gradually\r\nresigned their part in the performance to the bobolinks, not one of which\r\nis heard until some of the former have concluded their songs. The little\r\nhairbird still continues his almost incessant chirping, the first to begin\r\nand the last to quit the performance. Though the voice of this bird is not\r\nvery sweetly modulated, it blends harmoniously with the notes of other\r\nbirds, and greatly increases the charming effect of the combination.\r\n\r\nIt would be tedious to name all the birds that take part in this chorus;\r\nbut we must not omit the pewee, with his melancholy ditty, occasionally\r\nheard like a short minor strain in an oratorio; nor the oriole, who is\r\nreally one of the chief performers, and who, as his bright plumage flashes\r\nupon the sight, warbles forth a few notes so clear and mellow as to be\r\nbeard above every other sound. Adding a pleasing variety to all this\r\nharmony, the lisping notes of the meadowlark, uttered in a shrill tone,\r\nand with a peculiar pensive modulation, are plainly audible, with short\r\nrests between each repetition.\r\n\r\nThere is a little brown sparrow, resembling the hairbird, save a general\r\ntint of russet in his plumage, that may be heard distinctly among the\r\nwarbling host. He is rarely seen in cultivated grounds, but frequents the\r\nwild pastures, and is the bird that warbles so sweetly at midsummer, when\r\nthe whortleberries are ripe, and the fields are beautifully spangled with\r\nred lilies.\r\n\r\nThere is no confusion in the notes of his song, which consists of one\r\nsyllable rapidly repeated, but increasing in rapidity and rising to a\r\nhigher key towards the conclusion. He sometimes prolongs his strain, when\r\nhis notes are observed to rise and fall in succession. These plaintive and\r\nexpressive notes are very loud and constantly uttered, during the hour\r\nthat precedes the rising of the sun. A dozen warblers of this species,\r\nsinging in concert, and distributed in different parts of the field, form,\r\nperhaps, the most delightful part of the woodland oratorio to which we\r\nhave listened.\r\n\r\nAt sunrise hardly a robin can be beard in the whole neighborhood, and the\r\ncharacter of the performance has completely changed during the last half\r\nhour. The first part was more melodious and tranquilizing, the last is\r\nmore brilliant and animating. The grass finches, the vireos, the wrens,\r\nand the linnets have joined their voices to the chorus, and the bobolinks\r\nare loudest in their song. But the notes of the birds in general are not\r\nso incessant as before sunrise. One by one they discontinue their lays,\r\nuntil at high noon the bobolink and the warbling flycatcher are almost the\r\nonly vocalists to be heard in the fields.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII. SHORT SELECTIONS IN POETRY. (94)\r\n\r\n1. THE CLOUD.\r\n\r\nA cloud lay cradled near the setting sun,\r\n  A gleam of crimson tinged its braided snow;\r\nLong had I watched the glory moving on,\r\n  O\'er the still radiance of the lake below:\r\n  Tranquil its spirit seemed, and floated slow,\r\nE\'en in its very motion there was rest,\r\n  While every breath of eve that chanced to blow,\r\nWafted the traveler to the beauteous west.\r\nEmblem, methought, of the departed soul,\r\n  To whose white robe the gleam of bliss is given,\r\nAnd by the breath of mercy made to roll\r\n  Right onward to the golden gate of heaven,\r\nWhile to the eye of faith it peaceful lies,\r\nAnd tells to man his glorious destinies.\r\n                                          --John Wilson\r\n\r\n\r\nII. MY MIND.\r\n\r\nMy mind to me a kingdom is;\r\n  Such perfect joy therein I find,\r\nAs far exceeds all earthly bliss\r\n  That God or nature hath assigned;\r\nThough much I want that most would have,\r\nYet still my mind forbids to crave.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--This is the first stanza of a poem by William Byrd (b, 1543, d.\r\n1623), an English composer of music.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. A GOOD NAME. (95)\r\n\r\nGood name, in man or woman, dear my lord,\r\nIs the immediate jewel of their souls.\r\nWho steals my purse, steals trash; \'tis something, nothing;\r\n\'Twas mine, \'tis his, and has been slave to thousands;\r\nBut he that filches from me my good name,\r\nRobs me of that which not enriches him,\r\nAnd makes me poor indeed.\r\n                             Shakespeare.--Othello, Act III, Scene III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. SUNRISE.\r\n\r\nBut yonder comes the powerful king of day,\r\nRejoicing in the east. The lessening cloud,\r\nThe kindling azure, and the mountain\'s brow\r\nIllumed with liquid gold, his near approach\r\nBetoken glad. Lo! now apparent all,\r\nAslant the dew-bright earth and colored air\r\nHe looks in boundless majesty abroad,\r\nAnd sheds the shining day that, burnished, plays\r\nOn rocks, and hills, and towers, and wandering streams,\r\nHigh gleaming from afar.\r\n                                                        Thomson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. OLD AGE AND DEATH. (95)\r\n\r\nEdmund Waller, 1605-1687, an English poet, was a cousin of John Hampden,\r\nand related to Oliver Cromwell. He was educated at Eton and Cambridge.\r\nWaller was for many years a member of Parliament. He took part in the\r\ncivil war, and was detected in a treasonable plot. Several years of his\r\nlife were spent in exile in France. After the Restoration he came into\r\nfavor at court. His poetry is celebrated for smoothness and sweetness, but\r\nis disfigured by affected conceits.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\n  The seas are quiet when the winds give o\'er;\r\n  So calm are we when passions are no more.\r\n  For then we know how vain it was to boast\r\n  Of fleeting things, too certain to be lost.\r\n  Clouds of affection from our younger eyes\r\n  Conceal that emptiness which age descries.\r\n  The soul\'s dark cottage, battered and decayed,\r\n  Lets in new light through chinks that time has made:\r\n  Stronger by weakness, wiser men become,\r\n  As they draw near to their eternal home.\r\n  Leaving the old, both worlds at once they view,\r\n  That stand upon the threshold of the new.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. MILTON. (96)\r\n\r\nJohn Dryden, 1631-1703, was a noted English writer, who was made poet\r\nlaureate by James II. On the expulsion of James, and the accession of\r\nWilliam and Mary, Dryden lost his offices and pension, and was compelled\r\nto earn his bread by literary work. It was during these last years of his\r\nlife that his best work was done. His "Ode for St. Cecilia\'s Day" is one\r\nof his most, celebrated poems. His prose writings are specimens of good,\r\nstrong English.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\n  Three poets, in three distant ages born,\r\n  Greece, Italy, and England did adorn;\r\n  The first in loftiness of thought surpassed,\r\n  The next in majesty, in both the last.\r\n  The force of nature could no further go;\r\n  To make a third she joined the other two.\r\n\r\nNote.--The two poets referred to, other than Milton, are Homer and Dante.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII. DEATH OF LITTLE NELL. (96)\r\n\r\nCharles Dickens. 1812-1870, one of the greatest novelists of modern,\r\ntimes, was born in Portsmouth, but spent nearly all his life in London.\r\nHis father was a conscientious man, but lacked capacity for getting a\r\nlivelihood. In consequence, the boy\'s youth was much darkened by poverty.\r\nIt has been supposed that he pictured his father in the character of\r\n"Micawber." He began his active life as a lawyer\'s apprentice; but soon\r\nleft this employment to become a reporter. This occupation he followed\r\nfrom 1831 to 1836. His first book was entitled "Sketches of London\r\nSociety, by Boz." This was followed, in 1837, by the "Pickwick Papers," a\r\nwork which suddenly brought much fame to the author. His other works\r\nfollowed with great rapidity, and his last was unfinished at the time of\r\nhis death. He was buried in Westminster Abbey. Mr. Dickens visited America\r\nin 1842, and again in 1867. During his last visit, he read his works in\r\npublic, in the principal cities of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe resources of Dickens\'s genius seemed exhaustless. He copied no author,\r\nimitated none, but relied entirely on his own powers. He excelled\r\nespecially in humor and pathos. He gathered materials for his works by the\r\nmost careful and faithful observation. And he painted his characters with\r\na fidelity so true to their different individualities that, although they\r\nsometimes have a quaint grotesqueness bordering on caricature, they stand\r\nbefore the memory as living realities. He was particularly successful in\r\nthe delineation of the joys and griefs of childhood. "Little Nell" and\r\nlittle "Paul Dombey" are known, and have been loved and wept over, in\r\nalmost every household where the English language is read. His writings\r\npresent very vividly the wants and sufferings of the poor, and have a\r\ntendency to prompt to kindness and benevolence. His works have not escaped\r\ncriticism. It has been said that "his good characters act from impulse,\r\nnot from principle," and that he shows "a tricksy spirit of fantastic\r\nexaggeration." It has also been said that his novels sometimes lack\r\nskillful plot, and that he seems to speak approvingly of conviviality and\r\ndissipation. "The Old Curiosity Shop," from which the following extract is\r\ntaken, was published in 1840.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nShe was dead. No sleep so beautiful and calm, so free from trace of pain,\r\nso fair to look upon. She seemed a creature fresh from the hand of God,\r\nand waiting for the breath of life; not one who had lived, and suffered\r\ndeath. Her couch was dressed with here and there some winter berries and\r\ngreen leaves, gathered in a spot she had been used to favor. "When I die,\r\nput near me something that has loved the light, and had the sky above it\r\nalways." These were her words.\r\n\r\nShe was dead. Dear, gentle, patient, noble Nell was dead. Her little bird,\r\na poor, slight thing the pressure of a finger would have crushed, was\r\nstirring nimbly in its cage, and the strong heart of its child mistress\r\nwas mute and motionless forever! Where were the traces of her early cares,\r\nher sufferings, and fatigues? All gone. Sorrow was dead, indeed, in her;\r\nbut peace and perfect happiness were born, imaged in her tranquil beauty\r\nand profound repose.\r\n\r\nAnd still her former self lay there, unaltered in this change. Yes! the\r\nold fireside had smiled upon that same sweet face; it had passed, like a\r\ndream, through haunts of misery and care; at the door of the poor\r\nschoolmaster on the summer evening, before the furnace fire upon the cold\r\nwet night, at the still bedside of the dying boy, there had been the same\r\nmild and lovely look. So shall we know the angels, in their majesty, after\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\nThe old man held one languid arm in his, and had the small hand tight\r\nfolded to his breast for warmth. It was the hand she had stretched out to\r\nhim with her last smile; the hand that had led him on through all their\r\nwanderings. Ever and anon he pressed it to his lips; then hugged it to his\r\nbreast again, murmuring that it was warmer now, and, as he said it, he\r\nlooked in agony to those who stood around, as if imploring them to help\r\nher.\r\n\r\nShe was dead, and past all help, or need of help. The ancient rooms she\r\nhad seemed to fill with life, even while her own was waning fast, the\r\ngarden she had tended, the eyes she had gladdened, the noiseless haunts of\r\nmany a thoughtful hour, the paths she had trodden, as it were, but\r\nyesterday, could know her no more.\r\n\r\n"It is not," said the schoolmaster, as he bent down to kiss her on the\r\ncheek, and gave his tears free vent, "it is not in this world that\r\nheaven\'s justice ends. Think what earth is, compared with the world to\r\nwhich her young spirit has winged its early flight, and say, if one\r\ndeliberate wish, expressed in solemn tones above this bed, could call her\r\nback to life, which of us would utter it?"\r\n\r\nShe had been dead two days. They were all about her at the time, knowing\r\nthat the end was drawing on. She died soon after daybreak. They had read\r\nand talked to her in the earlier portion of the night; but, as the hours\r\ncrept on, she sank to sleep. They could tell by what she faintly uttered\r\nin her dreams, that they were of her journeyings with the old man; they\r\nwere of no painful scenes, but of people who had helped them, and used\r\nthem kindly; for she often said "God bless you!" with great fervor.\r\n\r\nWaking, she never wandered in her mind but once, and that was at beautiful\r\nmusic, which, she said, was in the air. God knows. It may have been.\r\nOpening her eyes, at last, from a very quiet sleep, she begged that they\r\nwould kiss her once again. That done, she turned to the old man, with a\r\nlovely smile upon her face, such, they said, as they had never seen, and\r\ncould never forget, and clung, with both her arms, about his neck. She had\r\nnever murmured or complained; but, with a quiet mind, and manner quite\r\nunaltered, save that she every day became more earnest and more grateful\r\nto them, faded like the light upon the summer\'s evening.\r\n\r\nThe child who had been her little friend, came there, almost as soon as it\r\nwas day, with an offering of dried flowers, which he begged them to lay\r\nupon her breast. He told them of his dream again, and that it was of her\r\nbeing restored to them, just as she used to be. He begged hard to see her:\r\nsaying, that he would be very quiet, and that they need not fear his being\r\nalarmed, for he had sat alone by his young brother all day long, when he\r\nwas dead, and had felt glad to be so near him. They let him have his wish;\r\nand, indeed, he kept his word, and was, in his childish way, a lesson to\r\nthem all.\r\n\r\nUp to that time, the old man had not spoken once, except to her, or\r\nstirred from the bedside. But, when he saw her little favorite, he was\r\nmoved as they had not seen him yet, and made as though he would have him\r\ncome nearer. Then, pointing to the bed, he burst into tears for the first\r\ntime, and they who stood by, knowing that the sight of this child had done\r\nhim good, left them alone together.\r\n\r\nSoothing him with his artless talk of her, the child persuaded him to take\r\nsome rest, to walk abroad, to do almost as he desired him. And, when the\r\nday came, on which they must remove her, in her earthly shape, from\r\nearthly eyes forever, he led him away, that he might not know when she was\r\ntaken from him. They were to gather fresh leaves and berries for her bed.\r\n\r\nAnd now the bell, the bell she had so often heard by night and day, and\r\nlistened to with solemn pleasure, almost as a living voice, rung its\r\nremorseless toll for her, so young, so beautiful, so good. Decrepit age,\r\nand vigorous life, and blooming youth, and helpless infancy,--on crutches,\r\nin the pride of health and strength, in the full blush of promise, in the\r\nmere dawn of life, gathered round her. Old men were there, whose eyes were\r\ndim and senses failing, grandmothers, who might have died ten years ago,\r\nand still been old, the deaf, the blind, the lame, the palsied, the living\r\ndead, in many shapes and forms, to see the closing of that early grave.\r\n\r\nAlong the crowded path they bore her now, pure as the newly fallen snow\r\nthat covered it, whose day on earth had been as fleeting. Under that\r\nporch, where she had sat when heaven, in its mercy, brought her to that\r\npeaceful spot, she passed again, and the old church received her in its\r\nquiet shade.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV. VANITY OF LIFE. (100)\r\n\r\nJohann Gottfried von Herder, 1744-1803, an eminent German poet, preacher,\r\nand philosopher, was born in Mohrungen, and died in Weimar. His published\r\nworks comprise sixty volumes. This selection is from his "Hebrew Poetry."\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nMan, born of woman,\r\nIs of a few days,\r\nAnd full of trouble;\r\nHe cometh forth as a flower, and is cut down;\r\nHe fleeth also as a shadow,\r\nAnd continueth not.\r\n\r\nUpon such dost thou open thine eye,\r\nAnd bring me unto judgment with thee?\r\nAmong the impure is there none pure?\r\nNot one.\r\n\r\nAre his days so determined?\r\nHast thou numbered his months,\r\nAnd set fast his bounds for him\r\nWhich he can never pass?\r\nTurn then from him that he may rest,\r\nAnd enjoy, as an hireling, his day.\r\n\r\nThe tree hath hope, if it be cut down,\r\nIt becometh green again,\r\nAnd new shoots are put forth.\r\nIf even the root is old in the earth,\r\nAnd its stock die in the ground,\r\nFrom vapor of water it will bud,\r\nAnd bring forth boughs as a young plant.\r\n\r\nBut man dieth, and his power is gone;\r\nHe is taken away, and where is he?\r\n\r\nTill the waters waste from the sea,\r\nTill the river faileth and is dry land,\r\nMan lieth low, and riseth not again.\r\nTill the heavens are old, he shall not awake,\r\nNor be aroused from his sleep.\r\n\r\nOh, that thou wouldest conceal me\r\nIn the realm of departed souls!\r\nHide me in secret, till thy wrath be past;\r\nAppoint me then a new term,\r\nAnd remember me again.\r\nBut alas! if a man die\r\nShall he live again?\r\n\r\nSo long, then, as my toil endureth,\r\nWill I wait till a change come to me.\r\nThou wilt call me, and I shall answer;\r\nThou wilt pity the work of thy hands.\r\nThough now thou numberest my steps,\r\nThou shalt then not watch for my sin.\r\nMy transgression will be sealed in a bag,\r\nThou wilt bind up and remove my iniquity.\r\n\r\nYet alas! the mountain falleth and is swallowed up,\r\nThe rock is removed out of its place,\r\nThe waters hollow out the stones,\r\nThe floods overflow the dust of the earth,\r\nAnd thus, thou destroyest the hope of man.\r\n\r\nThou contendest with him, till he faileth,\r\nThou changest his countenance, and sendeth him away.\r\nThough his sons become great and happy,\r\nYet he knoweth it not;\r\nIf they come to shame and dishonor,\r\nHe perceiveth it not.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote.--Compare with the translation of the same as given in the ordinary\r\nversion of the Bible. Job xiv.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV. A POLITICAL PAUSE. (102)\r\n\r\nCharles James Fox, 1749-1806, a famous English orator and statesman, was\r\nthe son of Hon. Henry Fox, afterward Lord Holland; he was also a lineal\r\ndescendant of Charles II. of England and of Henry IV, of France. He\r\nreceived his education at Westminster, Eton, and Oxford, but left the\r\nUniversity without graduating. He was first elected to Parliament before\r\nhe was twenty years old. During the American Revolution, he favored the\r\ncolonies; later, he was a friend and fellow-partisan both with Burke and\r\nWilberforce. Burke said of him, "He is the most brilliant and successful\r\ndebater the world ever saw." In his later years, Mr. Fox was as remarkable\r\nfor carelessness in dress and personal appearance, as he had been for the\r\nopposite in his youth. He possessed many pleasing traits of character, but\r\nhis morals were not commendable; he was a gambler and a spendthrift. Yet\r\nhe exercised a powerful influence on the politics of his times. This\r\nextract is from a speech delivered during a truce in the long war between\r\nEngland and France.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\n"But we must pause," says the honorable gentleman. What! must the bowels\r\nof Great Britain be torn out, her best blood spilt, her treasures wasted,\r\nthat you may make an experiment? Put yourselves--Oh! that you would put\r\nyourselves on the field of battle, and learn to judge of the sort of\r\nhorrors you excite. In former wars, a man might at least have some\r\nfeeling, some interest, that served to balance in his mind the impressions\r\nwhich a scene of carnage and death must inflict.\r\n\r\nBut if a man were present now at the field of slaughter, and were to\r\ninquire for what they were fighting--"Fighting!", would be the answer;\r\n"they are not fighting; they are pausing." "Why is that man expiring? Why\r\nis that other writhing with agony? What means this implacable fury?" The\r\nanswer must be, "You are quite wrong, sir, you deceive yourself,--they are\r\nnot fighting,--do not disturb them,--they are merely pausing! This man is\r\nnot expiring with agony,--that man is not dead,--he is only pausing! Bless\r\nyou, sir, they are not angry with one another; they have now no cause of\r\nquarrel; but their country thinks that there should be a pause. All that\r\nyou see is nothing like fighting,--there is no harm, nor cruelty, nor\r\nbloodshed in it; it is nothing more than a political pause. It is merely\r\nto try an experiment--to see whether Bonaparte will not behave himself\r\nbetter than heretofore; and, in the meantime, we have agreed to a pause,\r\nin pure friendship!"\r\n\r\nAnd is this the way that you are to show yourselves the advocates of\r\norder? You take up a system calculated to uncivilize the world, to destroy\r\norder, to trample on religion, to stifle in the heart not merely the\r\ngenerosity of noble sentiment, but the affections of social nature; and in\r\nthe prosecution of this system, you spread terror and devastation all\r\naround you.\r\n\r\n\r\nNote.--In this lesson, the influence of a negative in determining the\r\nrising inflection, is noticeable. See Rule V, p. 24.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI. MY EXPERIENCE IN ELOCUTION. (104)\r\n\r\nJohn Neal. 1793-1876, a brilliant but eccentric American writer, was born\r\nin Portland, Maine. He went into business, when quite young, in company\r\nwith John Pierpont, the well-known poet. They soon failed, and Mr. Neal\r\nthen turned his attention to the study of law. He practiced his profession\r\nsomewhat, but devoted most of his time to literature. For a time he\r\nresided in England, where he wrote for "Blackwood\'s Magazine" and other\r\nperiodicals. His writings were produced with great rapidity, and with a\r\npurposed disregard of what is known as "classical English."\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the academy I attended, elocution was taught in a way I shall never\r\nforget--never! We had a yearly exhibition, and the favorites of the\r\npreceptor were allowed to speak a piece; and a pretty time they had of it.\r\nSomehow I was never a favorite with any of my teachers after the first two\r\nor three days; and, as I went barefooted, I dare say it was thought\r\nunseemly, or perhaps cruel, to expose me upon the platform. And then, as I\r\nhad no particular aptitude for public speaking, and no relish for what was\r\ncalled oratory, it was never my luck to be called up.\r\n\r\nAmong my schoolmates, however, was one--a very amiable, shy boy--to whom\r\nwas assigned, at the first exhibition I attended, that passage in Pope\'s\r\nHomer beginning with,\r\n\r\n  "Aurora, now, fair daughter of the dawn!"\r\n\r\nThis the poor boy gave with so much emphasis and discretion, that, to me,\r\nit sounded like "O roarer!" and I was wicked enough, out of sheer envy, I\r\ndare say, to call him "O roarer!"--a nickname which clung to him for a\r\nlong while, though no human being ever deserved it less; for in speech and\r\naction both, he was quiet, reserved, and sensitive.\r\n\r\nMy next experience in elocution was still more disheartening, so that I\r\nnever had a chance of showing what I was capable of in that way till I set\r\nup for myself. Master Moody, my next instructor, was thought to have\r\nuncommon qualifications for teaching oratory. He was a large, handsome,\r\nheavy man, over six feet high; and having understood that the first,\r\nsecond, and third prerequisite in oratory was action, the boys he put in\r\ntraining were encouraged to most vehement and obstreperous manifestations.\r\nLet me give an example, and one that weighed heavily on my conscience for\r\nmany years after the poor man passed away.\r\n\r\nAmong his pupils were two boys, brothers, who were thought highly gifted\r\nin elocution. The master, who was evidently of that opinion, had a habit\r\nof parading them on all occasions before visitors and strangers; though\r\none bad lost his upper front teeth and lisped badly, and the other had the\r\nvoice of a penny trumpet. Week after week these boys went through the\r\nquarrel of Brutus and Cassius, for the benefit of myself and others, to\r\nsee if their example would not provoke us to a generous competition for\r\nall the honors.\r\n\r\nHow it operated on the other boys in after life I can not say; but the\r\neffect on me was decidedly unwholesome--discouraging, indeed,--until I was\r\nold enough to judge for myself, and to carry into operation a system of my\r\nown.\r\n\r\nOn coming to the passage,--\r\n\r\n  "Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts;\r\n   Dash him to pieces!"--\r\n\r\nthe elder of the boys gave it after the following fashion: "Be ready,\r\ngodths, with all your thunderbolths,--dath him in pietheth!"--bringing\r\nhis right fist down into his left palm with all his strength, and his\r\nlifted foot upon the platform, which was built like a sounding-board, so\r\nthat the master himself, who had suggested the action and obliged the poor\r\nboy to rehearse it over and over again, appeared to be utterly carried\r\naway by the magnificent demonstration; while to me--so deficient was I in\r\nrhetorical taste--it sounded like a crash of broken crockery, intermingled\r\nwith chicken peeps.\r\n\r\nI never got over it; and to this day can not endure stamping, nor even\r\ntapping of the foot, nor clapping the hands together, nor thumping the\r\ntable for illustration; having an idea that such noises are not oratory,\r\nand that untranslatable sounds are not language.\r\n\r\nMy next essay was of a somewhat different kind. I took the field in\r\nperson, being in my nineteenth year, well proportioned, and already\r\nbeginning to have a sincere relish for poetry, if not for declamation. I\r\nhad always been a great reader; and in the course of my foraging\r\ndepredations I had met with "The Mariner\'s Dream" and "The Lake of the\r\nDismal Swamp," both of which I had committed to memory before I knew it.\r\n\r\nAnd one day, happening to be alone with my sister, and newly rigged out in\r\na student\'s gown, such as the lads at Brunswick sported when they came to\r\nshow off among their old companions, I proposed to astonish her by\r\nrehearsing these two poems in appropriate costume. Being very proud of her\r\nbrother, and very obliging, she consented at once,--upon condition that\r\nour dear mother, who had never seen anything of the sort, should be\r\ninvited to make one of the audience.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, I rather think that I succeeded in astonishing both. I well\r\nremember their looks of amazement--for they had never seen anything better\r\nor worse in all their lives, and were no judges of acting--as I swept to\r\nand fro in that magnificent robe, with outstretched arms and uplifted\r\neyes, when I came to passages like the following, where an apostrophe was\r\ncalled for:\r\n\r\n  "And near him the she wolf stirred the brake,\r\n    And the copper snake breathed in his ear,\r\n  Till he, starting, cried, from his dream awake,\r\n    \'Oh, when shall I see the dusky lake,\r\n    And the white canoe of my dear\'!\'"\r\n\r\nOr like this:\r\n\r\n  "On beds of green sea flowers thy limbs shall be laid;\r\n  Around thy white bones the red coral shall grow,\r\n  Of thy fair yellow locks, threads of amber be made,\r\n  And every part suit to thy mansion below;"--\r\n\r\nthrowing up my arms, and throwing them out in every possible direction as\r\nthe spirit moved me, or the sentiment prompted; for I always encouraged my\r\nlimbs and features to think for themselves, and to act for themselves, and\r\nnever predetermined, never forethought, a gesture nor an intonation in my\r\nlife; and should as soon think of counterfeiting another\'s look or step or\r\nvoice, or of modulating my own by a pitch pipe (as the ancient orators\r\ndid, with whom oratory was acting elocution, a branch of the dramatic\r\nart), as of adopting or imitating the gestures and tones of the most\r\ncelebrated rhetorician I ever saw.\r\n\r\nThe result was rather encouraging. My mother and sister were both\r\nsatisfied. At any rate, they said nothing to the contrary. Being only in\r\nmy nineteenth year, what might I not be able to accomplish after a little\r\nmore experience!\r\n\r\nHow little did I think, while rehearsing before my mother and sister, that\r\nanything serious would ever come of it, or that I was laying the\r\nfoundations of character for life, or that I was beginning what I should\r\nnot be able to finish within the next forty or fifty years following. Yet\r\nso it was. I had broken the ice without knowing it. These things were but\r\nthe foreshadowing of what happened long afterward.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes.--Brunswick, Maine, is the seat of Bowdoin College.\r\n\r\n"The Mariner\'s Dream" is a poem by \'William Dimond.\r\n\r\n"The Lake of the Dismal Swamp" is by Thomas Moore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII. ELEGY IN A COUNTRY CHURCHYARD. (108)\r\n\r\nThomas Gray, 1716-1771, is often spoken of as "the author of the\r\nElegy,"--this simple yet highly finished and beautiful poem being by far\r\nthe best known of an his writings. It was finished in 1749,--seven years\r\nfrom the time it was commenced. Probably no short poem in the language\r\never deserved or received more praise. Gray was born in London; his father\r\npossessed property, but was indolent and selfish; his mother was a\r\nsuccessful woman of business, and supported her son in college from her\r\nown earnings. The poet was educated at Eton and Cambridge; at the latter\r\nplace, he resided for several years after his return from a continental\r\ntour, begun in 1739. He was small and delicate in person, refined and\r\nprecise in dress and manners, and shy and retiring in disposition. He was\r\nan accomplished scholar in many fields of learning, but left comparatively\r\nlittle finished work in any department. He declined the honor of poet\r\nlaureate; but, in 1769, was appointed Professor of History at Cambridge.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nThe curfew tolls the knell of parting day,\r\n  The lowing herd winds slowly o\'er the lea,\r\nThe plowman homeward plods his weary way,\r\n  And leaves the world to darkness and to me.\r\n\r\nNow fades the glimmering landscape on the sight,\r\n  And all the air a solemn stillness holds,\r\nSave where the beetle wheels his droning flight,\r\n  And drowsy tinklings lull the distant folds:\r\n\r\nSave that from yonder ivy-mantled tower,\r\n  The moping owl does to the moon complain\r\nOf such as, wandering near her secret bower,\r\n  Molest her ancient solitary reign.\r\n\r\nBeneath those rugged elms, that yew tree\'s shade,\r\n  Where heaves the turf in many a moldering heap,\r\nEach in his narrow cell forever laid,\r\n  The rude forefathers of the hamlet sleep.\r\n\r\nThe breezy call of incense-breathing morn,\r\n  The swallow twittering from the straw-built shed,\r\nThe cock\'s shrill clarion, or the echoing horn,\r\n  No more shall rouse them from their lowly bed.\r\n\r\nFor them no more the blazing hearth shall burn,\r\n  Or busy housewife ply her evening care;\r\nNo children run to lisp their sire\'s return,\r\n  Or climb his knees the envied kiss to share.\r\n\r\nOft did the harvest to their sickle yield,\r\n  Their furrow oft the stubborn glebe has broke:\r\nHow jocund did they drive their team afield!\r\n  How bowed the woods beneath their sturdy stroke!\r\n\r\nLet not Ambition mock their useful toil,\r\n  Their homely joys, and destiny obscure;\r\nNor Grandeur hear with a disdainful smile\r\n  The short and simple annals of the poor.\r\n\r\nThe boast of heraldry, the pomp of power,\r\n  And all that beauty, all that wealth e\'er gave,\r\nAwait alike, the inevitable hour:\r\n  The paths of glory lead but to the grave.\r\n\r\nNor you, ye proud, impute to these the fault,\r\n  If Memory o\'er their tomb no trophies raise;\r\nWhere, through the long-drawn aisle and fretted vault,\r\n  The pealing anthem swells the note of praise.\r\n\r\nCan storied urn, or animated bust,\r\n  Back to its mansion call the fleeting breath?\r\nCan Honor\'s voice provoke the silent dust,\r\n  Or Flattery soothe the dull, cold ear of Death?\r\n\r\nPerhaps, in this neglected spot is laid\r\n  Some heart once pregnant with celestial fire;\r\nHands, that the rod of empire might have swayed,\r\n  Or waked to ecstasy the living lyre:\r\n\r\nBut Knowledge to their eyes her ample page,\r\n  Rich with the spoils of time, did ne\'er unroll;\r\nChill Penury repressed their noble rage,\r\n  And froze the genial current of the soul.\r\n\r\nFull many a gem of purest ray serene,\r\n  The dark, unfathomed caves of ocean bear:\r\nFull many a flower is born to blush unseen,\r\n  And waste its sweetness on the desert air.\r\n\r\nSome village Hampden, that, with dauntless breast,\r\n  The little tyrant of his fields withstood,\r\nSome mute, inglorious Milton here may rest,\r\n  Some Cromwell, guiltless of his country\'s blood.\r\n\r\nThe applause of listening senates to command,\r\n  The threats of pain and ruin to despise,\r\nTo scatter plenty o\'er a smiling land,\r\n  And read their history in a nation\'s eyes,\r\n\r\nTheir lot forbade: nor, circumscribed alone\r\n  Their growing virtues, but their crimes confined;\r\nForbade to wade through slaughter to a throne.\r\n  And shut the gates of mercy on mankind,\r\n\r\nThe struggling pangs of conscious truth to hide,\r\n  To quench the blushes of ingenuous shame,\r\nOr heap the shrine of luxury and pride,\r\n  With incense kindled at the Muse\'s flame.\r\n\r\nFar from the madding crowd\'s ignoble strife,\r\n  Their sober wishes never learned to stray;\r\nAlong the cool, sequestered vale of life,\r\n  They kept the noiseless tenor of their way.\r\n\r\nYet even these bones, from insult to protect,\r\n  Some frail memorial still, erected nigh,\r\nWith uncouth rhymes and shapeless sculpture decked,\r\n  Implores the passing tribute of a sigh.\r\n\r\nTheir name, their years, spelt by the unlettered Muse,\r\n  The place of fame and elegy supply;\r\nAnd many a holy text around she strews,\r\n  That teach the rustic moralist to die.\r\n\r\nFor who, to dumb forgetfulness a prey,\r\n  This pleasing, anxious being e\'er resigned,\r\nLeft the warm precincts of the cheerful day,\r\n  Nor cast one longing, lingering look behind?\r\n\r\nOn some fond breast the parting soul relies,\r\n  Some pious drops the closing eye requires;\r\nE\'en from the tomb the voice of Nature cries,\r\n  E\'en in our ashes live their wonted fires.\r\n\r\nFor thee, who, mindful of the unhonored dead,\r\n  Dost in these lines their artless tale relate,\r\nIf chance, by lonely contemplation led,\r\n  Some kindred spirit shall inquire thy fate,--\r\n\r\nHaply some hoary-headed swain may say,\r\n  "Oft have we seen him at the peep of dawn\r\nBrushing, with hasty step, the dews away,\r\n  To meet the sun upon the upland lawn:\r\n\r\n"There, at the foot of yonder nodding beech,\r\n  That wreathes its old, fantastic roots so high,\r\nHis listless length at noontide would he stretch,\r\n  And pore upon the brook that babbles by.\r\n\r\n"Hard by yon wood, now smiling as in scorn,\r\n  Muttering his wayward fancies, he would rove;\r\nNow, drooping, woeful-wan, like one forlorn,\r\n  Or crazed with care, or crossed in hopeless love.\r\n\r\n"One morn, I missed him on the customed hill,\r\n  Along the heath, and near his favorite tree:\r\nAnother came; nor yet beside the rill,\r\n  Nor up the lawn, nor at the wood was he:\r\n\r\n"The next, with dirges due, in sad array\r\n  Slow through the church-way path we saw him borne:--\r\nApproach and read (for thou canst read) the lay\r\n  \'Graved on the stone beneath yon aged thorn."\r\n\r\n           THE EPITAPH.\r\n\r\nHere rests his head upon the lap of Earth,\r\n  A youth, to Fortune and to Fame unknown:\r\nFair Science frowned not on his humble birth,\r\n  And Melancholy marked him for her own.\r\n\r\nLarge was his bounty and his soul sincere,\r\n  Heaven did a recompense as largely send:\r\nHe gave to Misery (all he had) a tear;\r\n  He gained from Heaven (\'t was all he wished) a friend.\r\n\r\nNo farther seek his merits to disclose,\r\n  Or draw his frailties from their dread abode\r\n(There they alike in trembling hope repose),\r\n  The bosom of his Father, and his God.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Man on horseback riding past a church-yard (graveyard).\r\nThe sky is cloudy; the church steeple stands in the background.]\r\n\r\nNotes.--John Hampden (b. 1594, d. 1643) was noted for his resolute\r\nresistance to the forced loans and unjust taxes imposed by Charles I. on\r\nEngland. He took part in the contest between King and Parliament, and was\r\nkilled in a skirmish.\r\n\r\nJohn Milton. See biographical notice, page 312.\r\n\r\nOliver Cromwell (b. 1599, d. 1658) was the leading character in the Great\r\nRebellion in England. He was Lord Protector the last five years of his\r\nlife, and in many respects the ablest ruler that England ever had.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII. TACT AND TALENT. (113)\r\n\r\nTalent is something, but tact is everything. Talent is serious, sober,\r\ngrave, and respectable: tact is all that, and more too. It is not a sixth\r\nsense, but it is the life of all the five. It is the open eye, the quick\r\near, the judging taste, the keen smell, and the lively touch; it is the\r\ninterpreter of all riddles, the surmounter of all difficulties, the\r\nremover of all obstacles. It is useful in all places, and at all times; it\r\nis useful in solitude, for it shows a man into the world; it is useful in\r\nsociety, for it shows him his way through the world.\r\n\r\nTalent is power, tact is skill; talent is weight, tact is momentum; talent\r\nknows what to do, tact knows how to do it; talent makes a man respectable,\r\ntact will make him respected; talent is wealth, tact is ready money. For\r\nall the practical purposes, tact carries it against talent ten to one.\r\n\r\nTake them to the theater, and put them against each other on the stage,\r\nand talent shall produce you a tragedy that shall scarcely live long\r\nenough to be condemned, while tact keeps the house in a roar, night after\r\nnight, with its successful farces. There is no want of dramatic talent,\r\nthere is no want of dramatic tact; but they are seldom together: so we\r\nhave successful pieces which are not respectable, and respectable pieces\r\nwhich are not successful.\r\n\r\nTake them to the bar, and let them shake their learned curls at each other\r\nin legal rivalry; talent sees its way clearly, but tact is first at its\r\njourney\'s end. Talent has many a compliment from the bench, but tact\r\ntouches fees. Talent makes the world wonder that it gets on no faster,\r\ntact arouses astonishment that it gets on so fast. And the secret is, that\r\nit has no weight to carry; it makes no false steps; it hits the right nail\r\non the head; it loses no time; it takes all hints; and, by keeping its eye\r\non the weathercock, is ready to take advantage of every wind that blows.\r\n\r\nTake them into the church: talent has always something worth hearing, tact\r\nis sure of abundance of hearers; talent may obtain a living, tact will\r\nmake one; talent gets a good name, tact a great one; talent convinces,\r\ntact converts; talent is an honor to the profession, tact gains honor from\r\nthe profession.\r\n\r\nTake them to court: talent feels its weight, tact finds its way; talent\r\ncommands, tact is obeyed; talent is honored with approbation, and tact is\r\nblessed by preferment. Place them in the senate: talent has the ear of the\r\nhouse, but tact wins its heart, and has its votes; talent is fit for\r\nemployment, but tact is fitted for it. It has a knack of slipping into\r\nplace with a sweet silence and glibness of movement, as a billiard ball\r\ninsinuates itself into the pocket.\r\n\r\nIt seems to know everything, without learning anything. It has served an\r\nextemporary apprenticeship; it wants no drilling; it never ranks in the\r\nawkward squad; it has no left hand, no deaf ear, no blind side. It puts on\r\nno look of wondrous wisdom, it has no air of profundity, but plays with\r\nthe details of place as dexterously as a well-taught hand flourishes over\r\nthe keys of the pianoforte. It has all the air of commonplace, and all the\r\nforce and power of genius.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX. SPEECH BEFORE THE VIRGINIA CONVENTION. (115)\r\n\r\nPatrick Henry, 1730-1799, was born in Hanover County, Virginia, He\r\nreceived instruction in Latin and mathematics from his father, but seemed\r\nto develop a greater fondness for hunting, fishing, and playing the fiddle\r\nthan for study. Twice he was set up in business, and twice failed before\r\nhe was twenty-four. He was then admitted to the bar after six weeks\' study\r\nof the law. He got no business at first in his profession, but lived with\r\nhis father-in-law. His wonderful powers of oratory first showed themselves\r\nin a celebrated case which he argued in Hanover Courthouse, his own father\r\nbeing the presiding magistrate. He began very awkwardly, but soon rose to\r\na surprising height of eloquence, won his case against great odds, and was\r\ncarried off in triumph by the delighted spectators. His fame was now\r\nestablished; business flowed in, and he was soon elected to the Virginia\r\nLegislature. He was a delegate to the Congress of 1774, and in 1775 made\r\nthe prophetic speech of which the following selection is a portion.  It\r\nwas his own motion that the "colony be immediately put in a state of\r\ndefense." During the Revolution he was, for several years, Governor of\r\nVirginia. In 1788 he earnestly opposed the adoption of the Federal\r\nConstitution. When he died, he left a large family and an ample fortune.\r\nIn person, Mr. Henry was tall and rather awkward, with a face stern and\r\ngrave. When he spoke on great occasions, his awkwardness forsook him, his\r\nface lighted up, and his eyes flashed with a wonderful fire. In his life,\r\nhe was good-humored, honest, and temperate. His patriotism was of the\r\nnoblest type; and few men in those stormy times did better service for\r\ntheir country than he.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is natural for man to indulge in the illusions of hope. We are apt to\r\nshut our eyes against a painful truth, and listen to the song of that\r\nsiren till she transforms us into beasts. Is this the part of wise men,\r\nengaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty? Are we disposed to be\r\nof the number of those, who, having eyes, see not, and having ears, hear\r\nnot the things which so nearly concern their temporal salvation? For my\r\npart, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost, I am willing to know the\r\nwhole truth; to know the worst, and to provide for it.\r\n\r\nI have but one lamp by which my feet are guided; and that is the lamp of\r\nexperience. I know of no way of judging of the future but by the past;\r\nand, judging by the past, I wish to know what there has been in the\r\nconduct of the British ministry for the last ten years to justify those\r\nhopes with which gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves and the\r\nhouse? Is it that insidious smile with which our petition has been lately\r\nreceived? Trust it not: it will prove a snare to your feet. Suffer not\r\nyourselves to be betrayed with a kiss. Ask yourselves, how this gracious\r\nreception of our petition comports with those warlike preparations which\r\ncover our waters and darken our land. Are fleets and armies necessary to a\r\nwork of love and reconciliation? Have we shown ourselves so unwilling to\r\nbe reconciled that force must be called in to win back our love? Let us\r\nnot deceive ourselves. These are the implements of war and subjugation,--\r\nthe last arguments to which kings resort.\r\n\r\nI ask, gentlemen, what means this martial array, if its purpose be not to\r\nforce us into submission? Can gentlemen assign any other possible motive\r\nfor it? Has Great Britain any enemy in this quarter of the world, to call\r\nfor all this accumulation of navies and armies? No, she has none. They are\r\nmeant for us: they can be meant for no other. They are sent over to bind\r\nand rivet upon us those chains which the British ministry have been so\r\nlong forging. And what have we to oppose to them? Shall we try argument?\r\nWe have been trying that for the last ten years. Have we anything new to\r\noffer upon the subject? Nothing. We have held the subject up in every\r\nlight in which it was capable; but it has been all in vain.\r\n\r\nShall we resort to entreaty and humble supplication? What terms shall we\r\nfind which have not been already exhausted? Let us not, I beseech you,\r\ndeceive ourselves longer. We have done everything that could be done, to\r\navert the storm which is now coming on. We have petitioned; we have\r\nremonstrated; we have supplicated; we have prostrated ourselves at the\r\nfoot of the throne, and implored its interposition to arrest the\r\ntyrannical bands of the ministry and parliament. Our petitions have been\r\nslighted; our remonstrances have produced additional violence and insult;\r\nour supplications disregarded; and we have been spurned with contempt from\r\nthe foot of the throne.\r\n\r\nIn vain, after these things, may we indulge the fond hope of peace and\r\nreconciliation. There is no longer any room for hope. If we wish to be\r\nfree; if we mean to preserve inviolate those inestimable privileges for\r\nwhich we have been so long contending; if we mean not basely to abandon\r\nthe noble struggle in which we have been so long engaged, and which we\r\nhave pledged ourselves never to abandon until the glorious object of our\r\ncontest shall be obtained--we must fight! I repeat it, we must fight! An\r\nappeal to arms and the God of Hosts, is all that is left us.\r\n\r\nThey tell us that we are weak; unable to cope with so formidable an\r\nadversary. But when shall we be stronger? Will it be the next week, or the\r\nnext year? Will it be when we are totally disarmed, and when a British\r\nguard shall be stationed in every house? Shall we gather strength by\r\nirresolution and inaction? Shall we acquire the means of effectual\r\nresistance by lying supinely on our backs, and hugging the delusive\r\nphantom of hope, until our enemies shall have bound us hand and foot? We\r\nare not weak, if we make a proper use of those means which the God of\r\nnature hath placed in our power.\r\n\r\nThree millions of people, armed in the holy cause of liberty, and in such\r\na country as that which we possess, are invincible by any force which our\r\nenemy can send against us. Besides, we shall not fight our battles alone.\r\nThere is a just God who presides over the destinies of nations; and who\r\nwill raise up friends to fight our battles for us. The battle is not to\r\nthe strong alone; it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave. Besides,\r\nwe have no election. If we were base enough to desire it, it is now too\r\nlate to retire from the contest. There is no retreat but in submission and\r\nslavery! Our chains are forged. Their clanking may be heard on the plains\r\nof Boston! The war is inevitable; and; let it come! I repeat it, let it\r\ncome!\r\n\r\nIt is in vain to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may cry peace, peace; but\r\nthere is no peace. The war is actually begun. The next gale that sweeps\r\nfrom the north, will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! Our\r\nbrethren are already in the field! Why stand we here idle? What is it that\r\ngentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet,\r\nas to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty\r\nGod! I know not what course others may take; but as for me, give me\r\nliberty, or give me death.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes.--Observe, in this lesson, the all-controlling power of emphasis in\r\ndetermining the falling inflection. The words "see," "hear," and "my," in\r\nthe first paragraph, the word "that" in the second, and "spurned" and\r\n"contempt" in the fourth paragraph, are examples of this. Let the reader\r\nremember that a high degree of emphasis is sometimes expressed by a\r\nwhisper; also, that emphasis is often expressed by a pause.\r\n\r\nIt will be well to read in this connection some good history of the\r\nopening scenes of the Revolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX: THE AMERICAN FLAG. (119)\r\n\r\nJoseph Rodman Drake. 1795-1820, was born in New York City. His father died\r\nwhen he was very young, and his early life was a struggle with poverty. He\r\nstudied medicine, and took his degree when he was about twenty years old.\r\nFrom a child, he showed remarkable poetical powers, having made rhymes at\r\nthe early age of five. Most of his published writings were produced during\r\na period of less than two years. "The Culprit Fay" and the "American Flag"\r\nare best known. In disposition, Mr. Drake was gentle and kindly; and, on\r\nthe occasion of his death, his intimate friend, Fitz-Greene Halleck,\r\nexpressed his character in the well-known couplet:\r\n\r\n   "None knew thee but to love thee,\r\n   Nor named thee but to praise."\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Freedom, from her mountain height,\r\n  Unfurled her standard to the air,\r\nShe tore the azure robe of night,\r\n  And set the stars of glory there:\r\nShe mingled with its gorgeous dyes\r\nThe milky baldric of the skies,\r\nAnd striped its pure, celestial white\r\nWith streakings of the morning light;\r\nThen, from his mansion in the sun,\r\nShe called her eagle bearer down,\r\nAnd gave into his mighty hand\r\nThe symbol of her chosen land.\r\n\r\nMajestic monarch of the cloud!\r\n  Who rear\'st aloft thy regal form,\r\nTo hear the tempest trumpings loud,\r\nAnd see the lightning lances driven,\r\n  When strive the warriors of the storm,\r\nAnd rolls the thunder drum of heaven;--\r\nChild of the sun! to thee \'t is given\r\n  To guard the banner of the free,\r\nTo hover in the sulphur smoke,\r\nTo ward away the battle stroke,\r\nAnd bid its blendings shine afar,\r\nLike rainbows on the cloud of war,\r\n   The harbingers of victory!\r\n\r\nFlag of the brave! thy folds shall fly,\r\nThe sign of hope and triumph high!\r\nWhen speaks the signal trumpet tone,\r\nAnd the long line comes gleaming on,\r\nEre yet the lifeblood, warm and wet,\r\nHas dimmed the glistening bayonet,\r\nEach soldier\'s eye shall brightly turn\r\nTo where thy sky-born glories burn,\r\nAnd, as his springing steps advance,\r\nCatch war and vengeance from the glance.\r\nAnd when the cannon mouthings loud\r\nHeave in wild wreaths the battle shroud,\r\nAnd gory sabers rise and fall,\r\nLike shoots of flame on midnight\'s pall,\r\nThen shall thy meteor glances glow,\r\nAnd cowering foes shall sink beneath\r\nEach gallant arm, that strikes below\r\nThat lovely messenger of death.\r\n\r\nFlag of the seas! on ocean\'s wave\r\nThy stars shall glitter o\'er the brave;\r\nWhen death careering on the gale,\r\nSweeps darkly round the bellied sail,\r\nAnd frighted waves rush wildly back,\r\nBefore the broadside\'s reeling rack,\r\nEach dying wanderer of the sea\r\nShall look at once to heaven and thee,\r\nAnd smile to see thy splendors fly\r\nIn triumph o\'er his closing eye.\r\n\r\nFlag of the free heart\'s hope and home,\r\n  By angel hands to valor given,\r\nThy stars have lit the welkin dome,\r\n  And all thy hues were born in heaven.\r\nForever float that standard sheet!\r\n  Where breathes the foe but falls before us,\r\nWith Freedom\'s soil beneath our feet,\r\n  And Freedom\'s banner streaming o\'er us?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI. IRONICAL EULOGY ON DEBT. (121)\r\n\r\n\r\nDebt is of the very highest antiquity. The first debt in the history of\r\nman is the debt of nature, and the first instinct is to put off the\r\npayment of it to the last moment. Many persons, it will be observed,\r\nfollowing the natural procedure, would die before they would pay their\r\ndebts.\r\n\r\nSociety is composed of two classes, debtors and creditors. The creditor\r\nclass has been erroneously supposed the more enviable. Never was there a\r\ngreater misconception; and the hold it yet maintains upon opinion is a\r\nremarkable example of the obstinacy of error, notwithstanding the plainest\r\nlessons of experience. The debtor has the sympathies of mankind. He is\r\nseldom spoken of but with expressions of tenderness and compassion--"the\r\npoor debtor!"--and "the unfortunate debtor!" On the other hand, "harsh"\r\nand "hard-hearted" are the epithets allotted to the creditor. Who ever\r\nheard the "poor creditor," the "unfortunate creditor" spoken of? No, the\r\ncreditor never becomes the object of pity, unless he passes into the\r\ndebtor class. A creditor may be ruined by the poor debtor, but it is not\r\nuntil he becomes unable to pay his own debts, that he begins to be\r\ncompassionated.\r\n\r\nA debtor is a man of mark. Many eyes are fixed upon him; many have\r\ninterest in his well-being; his movements are of concern; he can not\r\ndisappear unheeded; his name is in many mouths; his name is upon many\r\nbooks; he is a man of note--of promissory note; he fills the speculation\r\nof many minds; men conjecture about him, wonder about him,--wonder and\r\nconjecture whether he will pay. He is a man of consequence, for many are\r\nrunning after him. His door is thronged with duns. He is inquired after\r\nevery hour of the day. Judges hear of him and know him. Every meal he\r\nswallows, every coat he puts upon his back, every dollar he borrows,\r\nappears before the country in some formal document. Compare his notoriety\r\nwith the obscure lot of the creditor,--of the man who has nothing but\r\nclaims on the world; a landlord, or fundholder, or some such disagreeable,\r\nhard character.\r\n\r\nThe man who pays his way is unknown in his neighborhood. You ask the\r\nmilkman at his door, and he can not tell his name. You ask the butcher\r\nwhere Mr. Payall lives, and he tells you he knows no such name, for it is\r\nnot in his books. You shall ask the baker, and he will tell you there is\r\nno such person in the neighborhood. People that have his money fast in\r\ntheir pockets, have no thought of his person or appellation. His house\r\nonly is known. No. 31 is good pay. No. 31 is ready money. Not a scrap of\r\npaper is ever made out for No. 31. It is an anonymous house; its owner\r\npays his way to obscurity. No one knows anything about him, or heeds his\r\nmovements. If a carriage be seen at his door, the neighborhood is not full\r\nof concern lest he be going to run away. If a package be removed from his\r\nhouse, a score of boys are not employed to watch whether it be carried to\r\nthe pawnbroker. Mr. Payall fills no place in the public mind; no one has\r\nany hopes or fears about him.\r\n\r\nThe creditor always figures in the fancy as a sour, single man, with\r\ngrizzled hair, a scowling countenance, and a peremptory air, who lives in\r\na dark apartment, with musty deeds about him, and an iron safe, as\r\nimpenetrable as his heart, grabbing together what he does not enjoy, and\r\nwhat there is no one about him to enjoy. The debtor, on the other hand, is\r\nalways pictured with a wife and six fair-haired daughters, bound together\r\nin affection and misery, full of sensibility, and suffering without a\r\nfault. The creditor, it is never doubted, thrives without a merit. He has\r\nno wife and children to pity. No one ever thinks it desirable that he\r\nshould have the means of living. He is a brute for insisting that he must\r\nreceive, in order to pay. It is not in the imagination of man to conceive\r\nthat his creditor has demands upon him which must be satisfied, and that\r\nhe must do to others as others must do to him. A creditor is a\r\npersonification of exaction. He is supposed to be always taking in, and\r\nnever giving out.\r\n\r\nPeople idly fancy that the possession of riches is desirable. What\r\nblindness! Spend and regale. Save a shilling and you lay it by for a\r\nthief. The prudent men are the men that live beyond their means. Happen\r\nwhat may, they are safe. They have taken time by the forelock. They have\r\nanticipated fortune. "The wealthy fool, with gold in store," has only\r\ndenied himself so much enjoyment, which another will seize at his expense.\r\nLook at these people in a panic. See who are the fools then. You know them\r\nby their long faces. You may say, as one of them goes by in an agony of\r\napprehension, "There is a stupid fellow who fancied himself rich, because\r\nhe had fifty thousand dollars in bank." The history of the last ten years\r\nhas taught the moral, "spend and regale." Whatever is laid up beyond the\r\npresent hour, is put in jeopardy. There is no certainty but in instant\r\nenjoyment. Look at schoolboys sharing a plum cake. The knowing ones eat,\r\nas for a race; but a stupid fellow saves his portion; just nibbles a bit,\r\nand "keeps the rest for another time." Most provident blockhead! The\r\nothers, when they have gobbled up their shares, set upon him, plunder him,\r\nand thrash him for crying out.\r\n\r\nBefore the terms "depreciation," "suspension," and "going into\r\nliquidation," were heard, there might have been some reason in the\r\npractice of "laying up;" but now it denotes the darkest blindness. The\r\nprudent men of the present time, are the men in debt. The tendency being\r\nto sacrifice creditors to debtors, and the debtor party acquiring daily\r\nnew strength, everyone is in haste to get into the favored class. In any\r\ncase, the debtor is safe. He has put his enjoyments behind him; they are\r\nsafe; no turns of fortune can disturb them. The substance he has eaten up,\r\nis irrecoverable. The future can not trouble his past. He has nothing to\r\napprehend. He has anticipated more than fortune would ever have granted\r\nhim. He has tricked fortune; and his creditors--bah! who feels for\r\ncreditors? What are creditors? Landlords; a pitiless and unpitiable tribe;\r\nall griping extortioners! What would become of the world of debtors, if it\r\ndid not steal a march upon this rapacious class?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII. THE THREE WARNINGS. (124)\r\n\r\nHester Lynch Thrale. 1739--1821, owes her celebrity almost wholly to her\r\nlong intimacy with Dr. Samuel Johnson. This continued for twenty years,\r\nduring which Johnson spent much time in her family. She was born in\r\nCaernarvonshire, Wales; her first husband was a wealthy brewer, by whom\r\nshe had several children. In 1784, she married an Italian teacher of music\r\nnamed Piozzi. Her writings are quite numerous; the best known of her books\r\nis the "Anecdotes of Dr. Johnson;" but nothing she ever wrote is so well\r\nknown as the "Three Warnings."\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nThe tree of deepest root is found\r\nLeast willing still to quit the ground;\r\n\'T was therefore said by ancient sages,\r\n  That love of life increased with years\r\nSo much, that in our latter stages,\r\nWhen pains grow sharp, and sickness rages,\r\n  The greatest love of life appears.\r\n\r\nThis great affection to believe,\r\nWhich all confess, but few perceive,\r\nIf old assertions can\'t prevail,\r\nBe pleased to hear a modern tale.\r\n\r\nWhen sports went round, and all were gay,\r\nOn neighbor Dodson\'s wedding day,\r\nDeath called aside the jocund groom\r\nWith him into another room;\r\nAnd looking grave, "You must," says he,\r\n"Quit your sweet bride, and come with me."\r\n"With you! and quit my Susan\'s side?\r\nWith you!" the hapless bridegroom cried:\r\n"Young as I am, \'t is monstrous hard!\r\nBesides, in truth, I\'m not prepared."\r\n\r\nWhat more he urged, I have not heard;\r\n  His reasons could not well be stronger:\r\nSo Death the poor delinquent spared,\r\n  And left to live a little longer.\r\nYet, calling up a serious look,\r\nHis hourglass trembled while he spoke:\r\n"Neighbor," he said, "farewell! no more\r\nShall Death disturb your mirthful hour;\r\nAnd further, to avoid all blame\r\nOf cruelty upon my name,\r\nTo give you time for preparation,\r\nAnd fit you for your future station,\r\nThree several warnings you shall have\r\nBefore you\'re summoned to the grave;\r\nWilling for once I\'ll quit my prey,\r\n  And grant a kind reprieve;\r\nIn hopes you\'ll have no more to say,\r\nBut, when I call again this way,\r\n  Well pleased the world will leave."\r\nTo these conditions both consented,\r\nAnd parted perfectly contented.\r\n\r\nWhat next the hero of our tale befell,\r\nHow long he lived, how wisely, and how well,\r\nIt boots not that the Muse should tell;\r\nHe plowed, he sowed, he bought, he sold,\r\nNor once perceived his growing old,\r\n  Nor thought of Death as near;\r\nHis friends not false, his wife no shrew,\r\nMany his gains, his children few,\r\nHe passed his hours in peace.\r\nBut, while he viewed his wealth increase,\r\nWhile thus along life\'s dusty road,\r\nThe beaten track, content he trod,\r\nOld Time, whose haste no mortal spares,\r\nUncalled, unheeded, unawares,\r\n  Brought on his eightieth year.\r\n\r\nAnd now, one night, in musing mood,\r\n  As all alone he sate,\r\n  The unwelcome messenger of Fate\r\nOnce more before him stood.\r\nHalf-killed with wonder and surprise,\r\n"So soon returned!" old Dodson cries.\r\n"So soon d\' ye call it?" Death replies:\r\n"Surely! my friend, you\'re but in jest;\r\n  Since I was here before,\r\n\'T is six and thirty years at least,\r\n  And you are now fourscore."\r\n"So much the worse!" the clown rejoined;\r\n"To spare the aged would be kind:\r\nBesides, you promised me three warnings,\r\nWhich I have looked for nights and mornings!"\r\n\r\n"I know," cries Death, "that at the best,\r\nI seldom am a welcome guest;\r\nBut do n\'t be captious, friend; at least,\r\nI little thought that you\'d be able\r\nTo stump about your farm and stable;\r\nYour years have run to a great length,\r\nYet still you seem to have your strength."\r\n\r\n"Hold!" says the farmer, "not so fast!\r\nI have been lame, these four years past."\r\n"And no great wonder," Death replies,\r\n"However, you still keep your eyes;\r\nAnd surely, sir, to see one\'s friends,\r\nFor legs and arms would make amends."\r\n"Perhaps," says Dodson, "so it might,\r\nBut latterly I\'ve lost my sight."\r\n"This is a shocking story, faith;\r\nBut there\'s some comfort still," says Death;\r\n"Each strives your sadness to amuse;\r\nI warrant you hear all the news."\r\n"There\'s none," cries he, "and if there were,\r\nI\'ve grown so deaf, I could not hear."\r\n\r\n"Nay, then," the specter stern rejoined,\r\n  "These are unpardonable yearnings;\r\nIf you are lame, and deaf, and blind,\r\n  You\'ve had your three sufficient warnings,\r\nSo, come along; no more we\'ll part."\r\nHe said, and touched him with his dart:\r\nAnd now old Dodson, turning pale,\r\nYields to his fate--so ends my tale.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII. THE MEMORY OF OUR FATHERS. (128)\r\n\r\nLyman Beecher, 1775-1863, a famous congregational minister of New England,\r\nwas born in New Haven, graduated from Yale College in 1797, and studied\r\ntheology with Dr. Timothy Dwight. His first settlement was at East\r\nHampton, L. I., at a salary of three hundred dollars per year. He was\r\npastor of the church in Litchfield, Ct., from 1810 till 1826, when he\r\nremoved to Boston, and took charge of the Hanover Street Church. In the\r\nreligious controversies of the time, Dr. Beecher was one of the most\r\nprominent characters. From 1832 to 1842, he was President of Lane\r\nTheological Seminary, in the suburbs of Cincinnati. He then returned to\r\nBoston, where he spent most of the closing years of his long and active\r\nlife. His death occurred in Brooklyn, N. Y. As a theologian, preacher, and\r\nadvocate of education, temperance, and missions, Dr. Beecher occupied a\r\nvery prominent place for nearly half a century. He left a large family of\r\nsons and two daughters, who are well known as among the most eminent\r\npreachers and authors in America.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are called upon to cherish with high veneration and grateful\r\nrecollections, the memory of our fathers. Both the ties of nature and the\r\ndictates of policy demand this. And surely no nation had ever less\r\noccasion to be ashamed of its ancestry, or more occasion for gratulation\r\nin that respect; for while most nations trace their origin to barbarians,\r\nthe foundations of our nation were laid by civilized men, by Christians.\r\nMany of them were men of distinguished families, of powerful talents, of\r\ngreat learning and of preeminent wisdom, of decision of character, and of\r\nmost inflexible integrity. And yet not unfrequently they have been treated\r\nas if they had no virtues; while their sins and follies have been\r\nsedulously immortalized in satirical anecdote.\r\n\r\nThe influence of such treatment of our fathers is too manifest. It creates\r\nand lets loose upon their institutions, the vandal spirit of innovation\r\nand overthrow; for after the memory of our father shall have been rendered\r\ncontemptible, who will appreciate and sustain their institutions? "The\r\nmemory of our fathers" should be the watchword of liberty throughout the\r\nland; for, imperfect as they were, the world before had not seen their\r\nlike, nor will it soon, we fear, behold their like again. Such models of\r\nmoral excellence, such apostles of civil and religious liberty, such\r\nshades of the illustrious dead looking down upon their descendants with\r\napprobation or reproof, according as they follow or depart from the good\r\nway, constitute a censorship inferior only to the eye of God; and to\r\nridicule them is national suicide.\r\n\r\nThe doctrines of our fathers have been represented as gloomy,\r\nsuperstitious, severe, irrational, and of a licentious tendency. But when\r\nother systems shall have produced a piety as devoted, a morality as pure,\r\na patriotism as disinterested, and a state of society as happy, as have\r\nprevailed where their doctrines have been most prevalent, it may be in\r\nseason to seek an answer to this objection.\r\n\r\nThe persecutions instituted by our fathers have been the occasion of\r\nceaseless obloquy upon their fair fame. And truly, it was a fault of no\r\nordinary magnitude, that sometimes they did persecute. But let him whose\r\nancestors were not ten times more guilty, cast the first stone, and the\r\nashes of our fathers will no more be disturbed. Theirs was the fault of\r\nthe age, and it will be easy to show that no class of men had, at that\r\ntime, approximated so nearly to just apprehensions of religious liberty;\r\nand that it is to them that the world is now indebted for the more just\r\nand definite views which now prevail.\r\n\r\nThe superstition and bigotry of our fathers are themes on which some of\r\ntheir descendants, themselves far enough from superstition, if not from\r\nbigotry, have delighted to dwell. But when we look abroad, and behold the\r\ncondition of the world, compared with the condition of New England, we may\r\njustly exclaim, "Would to God that the ancestors of all the nations had\r\nbeen not only almost, but altogether such bigots as our fathers were."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV. SHORT SELECTIONS IN PROSE. (130)\r\n\r\nI. DRYDEN AND POPE.\r\n\r\nDryden knew more of man in his general nature, and Pope in his local\r\nmanners. The notions of Dryden were formed by comprehensive speculation,\r\nthose of Pope by minute attention. There is more dignity in the knowledge\r\nof Dryden, more certainty in that of Pope. The style of Dryden is\r\ncapricious and varied, that of Pope cautious and uniform. Dryden obeys the\r\nmotions of his own mind; Pope constrains his mind to his own rules of\r\ncomposition. Dryden\'s page is a natural field, rising into inequalities,\r\nand diversified by the varied exuberance of abundant vegetation; Pope\'s is\r\nthe velvet lawn, shaven by the scythe, and leveled by the roller. If the\r\nflights of Dryden are higher, Pope continues longer on the wing. If, of\r\nDryden\'s fire, the blaze is brighter, of Pope\'s the heat is more regular\r\nand constant. Dryden often surpasses expectation, and Pope never falls\r\nbelow it. Dryden is read with frequent astonishment, and Pope with\r\nperpetual delight.\r\n                                                --Samuel Johnson.\r\n\r\nNote.--A fine example of antithesis. See p. 26.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. LAS CASAS DISSUADING FROM BATTLE. (130)\r\n\r\nIs then the dreadful measure of your cruelty not yet complete? Battle!\r\nagainst whom? Against a king, in whose mild bosom your atrocious injuries,\r\neven yet, have not excited hate; but who, insulted or victorious, still\r\nsues for peace. Against a people, who never wronged the living being their\r\nCreator formed; a people, who received you as cherished guests, with eager\r\nhospitality and confiding kindness. Generously and freely did they share\r\nwith you their comforts, their treasures, and their homes; you repaid them\r\nby fraud, oppression, and dishonor.\r\n\r\nPizarro, hear me! Hear me, chieftains! And thou, All-powerful! whose\r\nthunder can shiver into sand the adamantine rock, whose lightnings can\r\npierce the core of the riven and quaking earth, oh let thy power give\r\neffect to thy servant\'s words, as thy Spirit gives courage to his will! Do\r\nnot, I implore you, chieftains,--do not, I implore, you, renew the foul\r\nbarbarities your insatiate avarice has inflicted on this wretched,\r\nunoffending race. But hush, my sighs! fall not, ye drops of useless\r\nsorrow! heart-breaking anguish, choke not my utterance.\r\n                                                     --E. B. Sheridan.\r\n\r\nNote.--Examples of series. See p. 28.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. ACTION AND REPOSE. (131)\r\n\r\nJohn Ruskin, 1819 ---, is a distinguished English art critic and author.\r\nFrom 1869 to 1884, he was Professor of the Fine Arts at Oxford University.\r\nHis writings are very numerous, and are noted for their eloquent and\r\nbrilliant style.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout the river of human life there is a wintry wind, though a heavenly\r\nsunshine; the iris colors its agitation, the frost fixes upon its repose.\r\nLet us beware that our rest become not the rest of stones, which, so long\r\nas they are tempest-tossed and thunderstricken, maintain their majesty;\r\nbut when the stream is silent and the storm passed, suffer the grass to\r\ncover them, and are plowed into the dust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. TIME AND CHANGE. (131)\r\n\r\nSir Humphry Davy, 1778-1829, was an eminent chemist of England. He made\r\nmany important chemical discoveries, and was the inventor of the miner\'s\r\nsafety lamp.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nTime is almost a human word, and Change entirely a human idea; in the\r\nsystem of nature, we should rather say progress than change. The sun\r\nappears to sink in the ocean in darkness, but it rises in another\r\nhemisphere; the ruins of a city fall, but they are often used to form more\r\nmagnificent structures: even when they are destroyed so as to produce only\r\ndust, Nature asserts her empire over them; and the vegetable world rises\r\nin constant youth, in a period of annual successions, by the labors of\r\nman--providing food, vitality, and beauty--upon the wrecks of monuments\r\nwhich were raised for the purposes of glory, but which are now applied to\r\nobjects of utility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. THE POET. (132)\r\n\r\nWilliam Ellery Channing, 1780-1842, was a distinguished clergyman and\r\norator. He took a leading part in the public affairs of his day, and wrote\r\nand lectured eloquently on several topics.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not true that the poet paints a life which does not exist. He only\r\nextracts and concentrates, as it were, life\'s ethereal essence, arrests\r\nand condenses its volatile fragrance, brings together its scattered\r\nbeauties, and prolongs its more refined but evanescent joys; and in this\r\nhe does well, for it is good to feel that life is not wholly usurped by\r\ncares for subsistence and physical gratifications, but admits, in measures\r\nwhich may be indefinitely enlarged, sentiments and delights worthy of a\r\nhigher being.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. MOUNTAINS. (132)\r\n\r\nWilliam Howitt, 1795-1879, was an English author. He published many books,\r\nand was associated with his wife, Mary Howitt, in the publication of many\r\nothers.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a charm connected with mountains, so powerful that the merest\r\nmention of them, the merest sketch of their magnificent features, kindles\r\nthe imagination, and carries the spirit at once into the bosom of their\r\nenchanted regions. How the mind is filled with their vast solitude! How\r\nthe inward eye is fixed on their silent, their sublime, their everlasting\r\npeaks! How our hearts bound to the music of their solitary cries, to the\r\ntinkle of their gushing rills, to the sound of their cataracts! How\r\ninspiriting are the odors that breathe from the upland turf, from the\r\nrock-hung flower, from the hoary and solemn pine! How beautiful are those\r\nlights and shadows thrown abroad, and that fine, transparent haze which is\r\ndiffused over the valleys and lower slopes, as over a vast, inimitable\r\npicture!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXV. THE JOLLY OLD PEDAGOGUE. (133)\r\n\r\nGeorge Arnold, 1834--1865, was born in New York City. He never attended\r\nschool, but was educated at home, by his parents. His literary career\r\noccupied a period of about twelve years. In this time he wrote stories,\r\nessays, criticisms in art and literature, poems, sketches, etc., for\r\nseveral periodicals. Two volumes of his poems have been published since\r\nhis death.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\n\'T was a jolly old pedagogue, long ago,\r\n  Tall, and slender, and sallow, and dry;\r\nHis form was bent, and his gait was slow,\r\nAnd his long, thin hair was white as snow,\r\n  But a wonderful twinkle shone in his eye:\r\nAnd he sang every night as he went to bed,\r\n  "Let us be happy down here below;\r\nThe living should live, though the dead be dead,"\r\n  Said the jolly old pedagogue, long ago.\r\n\r\nHe taught the scholars the Rule of Three,\r\n  Reading, and writing, and history too;\r\nHe took the little ones on his knee,\r\nFor a kind old heart in his breast had he,\r\n  And the wants of the littlest child he knew.\r\n"Learn while you\'re young," he often said,\r\n  "There is much to enjoy down here below;\r\nLife for the living, and rest for the dead!"\r\n  Said the jolly old pedagogue, long ago.\r\n\r\nWith the stupidest boys, he was kind and cool,\r\n  Speaking only in gentlest tones;\r\nThe rod was scarcely known in his school--\r\nWhipping to him was a barbarous rule,\r\n  And too hard work for his poor old bones;\r\nBesides it was painful, he sometimes said:\r\n  "We should make life pleasant down here below--\r\nThe living need charity more than the dead,"\r\n  Said the jolly old pedagogue, long ago.\r\n\r\nHe lived in the house by the hawthorn lane,\r\n  With roses and woodbine over the door;\r\nHis rooms were quiet, and neat, and plain,\r\nBut a spirit of comfort there held reign,\r\n  And made him forget he was old and poor.\r\n"I need so little," he often said;\r\n  "And my friends and relatives here below\r\nWon\'t litigate over me when I am dead,"\r\n  Said the jolly old pedagogue, long ago.\r\n\r\nBut the pleasantest times he had of all,\r\n  Were the sociable hours he used to pass,\r\nWith his chair tipped back to a neighbor\'s wall,\r\nMaking an unceremonious call,\r\n  Over a pipe and a friendly glass:\r\nThis was the finest pleasure, he said,\r\n  Of the many he tasted here below:\r\n"Who has no cronies had better be dead,"\r\n  Said the jolly old pedagogue, long ago.\r\n\r\nThe jolly old pedagogue\'s wrinkled face\r\n  Melted all over in sunshiny smiles;\r\nHe stirred his glass with an old-school grace,\r\nChuckled, and sipped, and prattled apace,\r\n  Till the house grew merry from cellar to tiles.\r\n"I\'m a pretty old man," he gently said,\r\n  "I\'ve lingered a long time here below;\r\nBut my heart is fresh, if my youth is fled!"\r\n  Said the jolly old pedagogue, long ago.\r\n\r\nHe smoked his pipe in the balmy air\r\n  Every night, when the sun went down;\r\nAnd the soft wind played in his silvery hair,\r\nLeaving its tenderest kisses there,\r\n  On the jolly old pedagogue\'s jolly old crown;\r\nAnd feeling the kisses, he smiled, and said:\r\n  " \'T is it glorious world down here below;\r\nWhy wait for happiness till we are dead?"\r\n  Said this jolly old pedagogue, long ago.\r\n\r\nHe sat at his door one midsummer night,\r\n  After the sun had sunk in the west,\r\nAnd the lingering beams of golden light\r\nMade his kindly old face look warm and bright,\r\n  While the odorous night winds whispered, "Rest!"\r\nGently, gently, he bowed his head;\r\n  There were angels waiting for him, I know;\r\nHe was sure of his happiness, living or dead,\r\n  This jolly old pedagogue, long ago!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI. THE TEACHER AND SICK SCHOLAR. (135)\r\n\r\nShortly after the schoolmaster had arranged the forms and taken his seat\r\nbehind his desk, a small white-headed boy with a sunburnt face appeared at\r\nthe door, and, stopping there to make a rustic bow, came in and took his\r\nseat upon one of the forms. He then put an open book, astonishingly\r\ndog\'s-eared, upon his knees, and, thrusting his hands into his pockets,\r\nbegan counting the marbles with which they were filled; displaying, in the\r\nexpression of his face, a remarkable capacity of totally abstracting his\r\nmind from the spelling on which his eyes were fixed.\r\n\r\nSoon afterward, another white-headed little boy came straggling in, and\r\nafter him, a red-headed lad, and then one with a flaxen poll, until the\r\nforms were occupied by a dozen boys, or thereabouts, with heads of every\r\ncolor but gray, and ranging in their ages from four years old to fourteen\r\nyears or more; for the legs of the youngest were a long way from the\r\nfloor, when he sat upon the form; and the eldest was a heavy,\r\ngood-tempered fellow, about half a head taller than the schoolmaster.\r\n\r\nAt the top of the first form--the post of honor in the school--was the\r\nvacant place of the little sick scholar; and, at the head of the row of\r\npegs, on which those who wore hats or caps were wont to hang them, one was\r\nempty. No boy attempted to violate the sanctity of seat or peg, but many a\r\none looked from the empty spaces to the schoolmaster, and whispered to his\r\nidle neighbor, behind his hand.\r\n\r\nThen began the hum of conning over lessons and getting them by heart, the\r\nwhispered jest and stealthy game, and all the noise and drawl of school;\r\nand in the midst of the din, sat the poor schoolmaster, vainly attempting\r\nto fix his mind upon the duties of the day, and to forget his little sick\r\nfriend. But the tedium of his office reminded him more strongly of the\r\nwilling scholar, and his thoughts were rambling from his pupils--it was\r\nplain.\r\n\r\nNone knew this better than the idlest boys, who, growing bolder with\r\nimpunity, waxed louder and more daring; playing "odd or even" under the\r\nmaster\'s eye; eating apples openly and without rebuke; pinching each other\r\nin sport or malice, without the least reserve; and cutting their initials\r\nin the very legs of his desk. The puzzled dunce, who stood beside it to\r\nsay his lesson "off the book," looked no longer at the ceiling for\r\nforgotten words, but drew closer to the master\'s elbow, and boldly cast\r\nhis eye upon the page; the wag of the little troop squinted and made\r\ngrimaces (at the smallest boy, of course), holding no book before his\r\nface, and his approving companions knew no constraint in their delight. If\r\nthe master did chance to rouse himself, and seem alive to what was going\r\non, the noise subsided for a moment, and no eye met his but wore a\r\nstudious and deeply humble look; but the instant he relapsed again, it\r\nbroke out afresh, and ten times louder than before.\r\n\r\nOh! how some of those idle fellows longed to be outside, and how they\r\nlooked at the open door and window, as if they half meditated rushing\r\nviolently out, plunging into the woods, and being wild boys and savages\r\nfrom that time forth. What rebellious thoughts of the cool river, and some\r\nshady bathing place, beneath willow trees with branches dipping in the\r\nwater, kept tempting and urging that sturdy boy, who, with his shirt\r\ncollar unbuttoned, and flung back as far as it could go, sat fanning his\r\nflushed face with a spelling book, wishing himself a whale, or a minnow,\r\nor a fly, or anything but a boy at school, on that hot, broiling day.\r\n\r\nHeat! ask that other boy, whose seat being nearest to the door, gave him\r\nopportunities of gliding out into the garden, and driving his companions\r\nto madness, by dipping his face into the bucket of the well, and then\r\nrolling on the grass,--ask him if there was ever such a day as that, when\r\neven the bees were diving deep down into the cups of the flowers, and\r\nstopping there, as if they had made up their minds to retire from\r\nbusiness, and be manufacturers of honey no more. The day was made for\r\nlaziness, and lying on one\'s back in green places, and staring at the sky,\r\ntill its brightness forced the gazer to shut his eyes and go to sleep. And\r\nwas this a time to be poring over musty books in a dark room, slighted by\r\nthe very sun itself? Monstrous!\r\n\r\nThe lessons over, writing time began. This was a more quiet time; for the\r\nmaster would come and look over the writer\'s shoulder, and mildly tell him\r\nto observe how such a letter was turned up, in such a copy on the wall,\r\nwhich had been written by their sick companion, and bid him take it as a\r\nmodel. Then he would stop and tell them what the sick child had said last\r\nnight, and how he had longed to be among them once again; and such was the\r\npoor schoolmaster\'s gentle and affectionate manner, that the boys seemed\r\nquite remorseful that they had worried him so much, and were absolutely\r\nquiet; eating no apples, cutting no names, and making no grimaces for full\r\ntwo minutes afterward.\r\n\r\n"I think, boys," said the schoolmaster, when the clock struck twelve,\r\n"that I shall give you an extra half holiday this afternoon." At this\r\nintelligence, the boys, led on and headed by the tall boy, raised a great\r\nshout, in the midst of which the master was seen to speak, but could not\r\nbe heard. As he held up his hand, however, in token of his wish that they\r\nshould be silent, they were considerate enough to leave off, as soon as the\r\nlongest-winded among them were quite out of breath. "You must promise\r\nme, first," said the schoolmaster, "that you\'ll not be noisy, or at least,\r\nif you are, that you\'ll go away first, out of the village, I mean. I\'m\r\nsure you would n\'t disturb your old playmate and companion."\r\n\r\nThere was a general murmur (and perhaps a very sincere one, for they were\r\nbut boys) in the negative; and the tall boy, perhaps as sincerely as any\r\nof them, called those about him to witness, that he had only shouted in a\r\nwhisper. "Then pray do n\'t forget, there\'s my dear scholars," said the\r\nschoolmaster, "what I have asked you, and do it as a favor to me. Be as\r\nhappy as you can, and do n\'t be unmindful that you are blessed with\r\nhealth. Good-by, all."\r\n\r\n"Thank \'ee, sir," and "Good-by, sir," were said a great many times in a\r\ngreat variety of voices, and the boys went out very slowly and softly. But\r\nthere was the sun shining and there were birds singing, as the sun only\r\nshines and the birds only sing on holidays and half holidays; there were\r\nthe trees waving to all free boys to climb, and nestle among their leafy\r\nbranches; the hay, entreating them to come and scatter it to the pure air;\r\nthe green corn, gently beckoning toward wood and stream; the smooth\r\nground, rendered smoother still by blending lights and shadows, inviting\r\nto runs and leaps, and long walks, nobody knows whither. It was more than\r\nboy could bear, and with a joyous whoop, the whole cluster took to their\r\nheels, and spread themselves about, shouting and laughing as they went.\r\n" \'T is natural, thank Heaven!" said the poor schoolmaster, looking after\r\nthem, "I am very glad they did n\'t mind me."\r\n\r\nToward night, the schoolmaster walked over to the cottage where his little\r\nfriend lay sick. Knocking gently at the cottage door, it was opened\r\nwithout loss of time. He entered a room where a group of women were\r\ngathered about one who was wringing her hands and crying bitterly. "O\r\ndame!" said the schoolmaster, drawing near her chair, "is it so bad as\r\nthis?" Without replying, she pointed to another room, which the\r\nschoolmaster immediately entered; and there lay his little friend,\r\nhalf-dressed, stretched upon a bed.\r\n\r\nHe was a very young boy; quite a little child. His hair still hung in\r\ncurls about his face, and his eyes were very bright; but their light was\r\nof heaven, not of earth. The schoolmaster took a seat beside him, and,\r\nstooping over the pillow whispered his name. The boy sprung up, stroked\r\nhis face with his hand, and threw his wasted arms around his neck, crying,\r\nthat he was his dear, kind friend. "I hope I always was. I meant to be,\r\nGod knows," said the poor schoolmaster. "You remember my garden, Henry?"\r\nwhispered the old man, anxious to rouse him, for dullness seemed gathering\r\nupon the child, "and how pleasant it used to be in the evening time? You\r\nmust make haste to visit it again, for I think the very flowers have\r\nmissed you, and are less gay than they used to be. You will come soon,\r\nvery soon now, won\'t you?"\r\n\r\nThe boy smiled faintly--so very, very faintly--and put his hand upon his\r\nfriend\'s gray head. He moved his lips too, but no voice came from them,--\r\nno, not a sound. In the silence that ensued, the hum of distant voices,\r\nborne upon the evening air, came floating through the open window. "What\'s\r\nthat?" said the sick child, opening his eyes. "The boys at play, upon the\r\ngreen." He took a handkerchief from his pillow, and tried to wave it above\r\nhis head. But the feeble arm dropped powerless down. "Shall I do it?" said\r\nthe schoolmaster. "Please wave it at the window," was the faint reply.\r\n"Tie it to the lattice. Some of them may see it there. Perhaps they\'ll\r\nthink of me, and look this way."\r\n\r\nHe raised his head and glanced from the fluttering signal to his idle bat,\r\nthat lay, with slate, and book, and other boyish property, upon the table\r\nin the room. And then he laid him softly down once more, and again clasped\r\nhis little arms around the old man\'s neck. The two old friends and\r\ncompanions--for such they were, though they were man and child--held each\r\nother in a long embrace, and then the little scholar turned his face to\r\nthe wall and fell asleep.\r\n\r\n* * * * * * * * *\r\n\r\nThe poor schoolmaster sat in the same place, holding the small, cold hand\r\nin his, and chafing it. It was but the hand of a dead child. He felt that;\r\nand yet he chafed it still, and could not lay it down.\r\n\r\n                                 From "The Old Curiosity Shop," by Dickens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII. THE SNOW SHOWER. (141)\r\n\r\nWilliam Cullen Bryant, 1794-1878, was the son of Peter Bryant, a physician\r\nof Cummington, Massachusetts. Amid the beautiful scenery of this remote\r\ncountry town, the poet was born; and here he passed his early youth. At\r\nthe age of sixteen, Bryant entered Williams College, but was honorably\r\ndismissed at the end of two years. He then entered on the study of law,\r\nand was admitted to the bar at the age of twenty-one. He practiced his\r\nprofession, with much success, for about nine years. In 1826, he removed\r\nto New York, and became connected with the "Evening Post," a connection\r\nwhich continued to the time of his death. For more than thirty of the last\r\nyears of his life, Mr. Bryant made his home near Roslyn, Long Island,\r\nwhere he occupied an "old-time mansion," which he bought, fitted up, and\r\nsurrounded in accordance with his excellent rural taste. A poem of his,\r\nwritten at the age of ten years, was published in the "County Gazette,"\r\nand two poems of considerable length were published in book form, when the\r\nauthor was only fourteen. "Thanatopsis," perhaps the best known of all his\r\npoems, was written when he was but nineteen. But, notwithstanding his\r\nprecocity, his powers continued to a remarkable age. His, excellent\r\ntranslations of the "Iliad" and the "Odyssey," together with some of his\r\nbest poems, were accomplished after the poet, had passed the age of\r\nseventy. Mr. Bryant visited Europe several times; and, in 1849, he\r\ncontinued his travels into Egypt and Syria. Abroad, he was received with\r\nmany marks of distinction; and he added much to his extensive knowledge by\r\nstudying the literature of the countries he visited.\r\n\r\nAll his poems exhibit a peculiar love, and a careful study, of nature; and\r\nhis language, both in prose and poetry, is always chaste, elegant, and\r\ncorrect. His mind was well-balanced; and his personal character was one to\r\nbe admired, loved, and imitated.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nStand here by my side and turn, I pray,\r\n  On the lake below thy gentle eyes;\r\nThe clouds hang over it, heavy and gray,\r\n  And dark and silent the water lies;\r\nAnd out of that frozen mist the snow\r\nIn wavering flakes begins to flow;\r\n                    Flake after flake\r\nThey sink in the dark and silent lake.\r\n\r\nSee how in a living swarm they come\r\n From the chambers beyond that misty veil;\r\nSome hover in air awhile, and some\r\n Rush prone from the sky like summer hail.\r\nAll, dropping swiftly, or settling slow,\r\nMeet, and are still in the depths below;\r\n                    Flake after flake\r\nDissolved in the dark and silent lake.\r\n\r\nHere delicate snow stars, out of the cloud,\r\n  Come floating downward in airy play,\r\nLike spangles dropped from the glistening crowd\r\n  That whiten by night the Milky Way;\r\nThere broader and burlier masses fall;\r\nThe sullen water buries them all,--\r\n                      Flake after flake,--\r\nAll drowned in the dark and silent lake.\r\n\r\nAnd some, as on tender wings they glide\r\n  From their chilly birth cloud, dim and gray.\r\nAre joined in their fall, and, side by side,\r\n  Come clinging along their unsteady way;\r\nAs friend with friend, or husband with wife,\r\nMakes hand in hand the passage of life;\r\n                       Each mated flake\r\nSoon sinks in the dark and silent lake.\r\n\r\nLo! while we are gazing, in swifter haste\r\n  Stream down the snows, till the air is white,\r\nAs, myriads by myriads madly chased,\r\n  They fling themselves from their shadowy height.\r\nThe fair, frail creatures of middle sky,\r\nWhat speed they make, with their grave so nigh;\r\n                 Flake after flake\r\nTo lie in the dark and silent lake.\r\n\r\nI see in thy gentle eyes a tear;\r\n  They turn to me in sorrowful thought;\r\nThou thinkest of friends, the good and dear,\r\n  Who were for a time, and now are not;\r\nLike these fair children of cloud and frost,\r\nThat glisten a moment an then are lost,\r\n                   Flake after flake,--\r\nAll lost in the dark and silent lake.\r\n\r\nYet look again, for the clouds divide;\r\n  A gleam of blue on the water lies;\r\nAnd far away, on the mountain side,\r\n  A sunbeam falls from the opening skies.\r\nBut the hurrying host that flew between\r\nThe cloud and the water no more is seen;\r\n                  Flake after flake\r\nAt rest in the dark and silent lake.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII. CHARACTER OF NAPOLEON BONAPARTE. (143)\r\n\r\nCharles Phillips, 1787-1859, an eminent barrister and orator, was born in\r\nSligo, Ireland, and died in London. He gained much of his reputation as an\r\nadvocate in criminal cases. In his youth he published some verses; later\r\nin life he became the author of several works, chiefly of biography.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nHe is fallen! We may now pause before that splendid prodigy, which towered\r\namong us like some ancient ruin, whose power terrified the glance its\r\nmagnificence attracted. Grand, gloomy, and peculiar, he sat upon the\r\nthrone a sceptered hermit, wrapt in the solitude of his own originality. A\r\nmind, bold, independent, and decisive; a will, despotic in its dictates;\r\nan energy that distanced expedition; and a conscience, pliable to every\r\ntouch of interest, marked the outlines of this extraordinary\r\ncharacter--the most extraordinary, perhaps, that in the annals of this\r\nworld ever rose, or reigned, or fell.\r\n\r\nFlung into life in the midst of a revolution that quickened every energy\r\nof a people who acknowledged no superior, he commenced his course, a\r\nstranger by birth, and a scholar by charity. With no friend but his sword,\r\nand no fortune but his talents, he rushed into the lists where rank, and\r\nwealth, and genius had arrayed themselves, and competition fled from him,\r\nas from the glance of destiny.\r\n\r\nHe knew no motive but interest; acknowledged no criterion but success; he\r\nworshiped no God but ambition; and, with an eastern devotion, he knelt at\r\nthe shrine of his idolatry. Subsidiary to this, there was no creed that he\r\ndid not profess, there was no opinion that he did not promulgate: in the\r\nhope of a dynasty, he upheld the crescent; for the sake of a divorce, he\r\nbowed before the cross; the orphan of St. Louis, he became the adopted\r\nchild of the Republic; and, with a parricidal ingratitude, on the ruins\r\nboth of the throne and the tribune, he reared the throne of his despotism.\r\nA professed Catholic, he imprisoned the Pope; a pretended patriot, he\r\nimpoverished the country; and in the name of Brutus, he grasped without\r\nremorse, and wore without shame, the diadem of the Caesars.\r\n\r\nThe whole continent trembled at beholding the audacity of his designs, and\r\nthe miracle of their execution. Skepticism bowed to the prodigies of his\r\nperformance; romance assumed the air of history; nor was there aught too\r\nincredible for belief, or too fanciful for expectation, when the world saw\r\na subaltern of Corsica waving his imperial flag over her most ancient\r\ncapitals. All the visions of antiquity became commonplace in his\r\ncontemplation: kings were his people; nations were his outposts; and he\r\ndisposed of courts, and crowns, and camps, and churches, and cabinets, as\r\nif they were the titular dignitaries of the chessboard! Amid all these\r\nchanges, he stood immutable as adamant. It mattered little whether in the\r\nfield, or in the drawing-room; with the mob, or the levee; wearing the\r\nJacobin bonnet, or the iron crown; banishing a Braganza, or espousing a\r\nHapsburg; dictating peace on a raft to the Czar of Russia, or\r\ncontemplating defeat at the gallows of Leipsic he was still the same\r\nmilitary despot.\r\n\r\nIn this wonderful combination, his affectations of literature must not be\r\nomitted. The jailer of the press, he affected the patronage of letters;\r\nthe proscriber of books, he encouraged philosophy; the persecutor of\r\nauthors, and the murderer of printers, he yet pretended to the protection\r\nof learning; the assassin of Palm, the silencer of De Stael, and the\r\ndenouncer of Kotzebue, he was the friend of David, the benefactor of De\r\nLille, and sent his academic prize to the philosopher of England.\r\n\r\nSuch a medley of contradictions, and, at the same time, such an individual\r\nconsistency, were never united in the same character. A royalist, a\r\nrepublican, and an emperor; a Mohammedan, a Catholic, and a patron of the\r\nsynagogue; a subaltern and a sovereign; a traitor and a tyrant; a\r\nChristian and an infidel; he was, through all his vicissitudes, the same\r\nstern, impatient, inflexible original; the same mysterious,\r\nincomprehensible self; the man without a model, and without a shadow.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--St. Louis (b. 1215, d. 1270), a wise and pious king of France,\r\nknown as Louis IX. Napoleon was appointed to the Military School at\r\nBrienne, by Louis XVI. Brutus, Lucius Junius, abolished the royal office\r\nat Rome (509 B. C.), and ruled as consul for two years.\r\n\r\nJacobin Bonnet.--The Jacobins were a powerful political club during the\r\nfirst French Revolution. A peculiar bonnet or hat was their badge.\r\nBraganza, the name of the royal family of Portugal. Maria of Portugal, and\r\nher father, Charles IV. of Spain, were both expelled by Napoleon.\r\nHapsburg, the name of the royal family of Austria. Napoleon\'s second wife\r\nwas Maria Louisa, the daughter of the Emperor. Czar.--The treaty of Tilsit\r\nwas agreed to between Bonaparte and the Czar Alexander on the river Memel.\r\nLeipsic.--Napoleon was defeated by the allied forces, in October, 1813, at\r\nthis city.\r\n\r\nPalm, a German publisher, shot, in 1806, by order of Napoleon, for\r\npublishing a pamphlet against him. De Stael (pro. De Stal), a celebrated\r\nFrench authoress, banished from Paris, in 1802, by Napoleon. Kotzebue, an\r\neminent German dramatist. David, the leading historical painter of his\r\ntimes in France. De Lille, an eminent French poet and professor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX. NAPOLEON AT REST. (146)\r\n\r\nJohn Pierpont, 1785-1866, was born in Litchfield, Connecticut, and\r\ngraduated from Yale College in 1804. The next four years he spent as a\r\nprivate tutor in the family of Col. William Allston, of South Carolina. On\r\nhis return, he studied law in the law school of his native town. He\r\nentered upon practice, but soon left the law for mercantile pursuits, in\r\nwhich he was unsuccessful. Having studied theology at Cambridge, in 1819\r\nhe was ordained pastor of the Hollis Street Unitarian Church, in Boston,\r\nwhere he continued nearly twenty years. He afterwards preached four years\r\nfor a church in Troy, New York, and then removed to Medford,\r\nMassachusetts. At the age of seventy-six, he became chaplain of a\r\nMassachusetts regiment; but, on account of infirmity, war soon obliged to\r\ngive up the position. Mr. Pierpont published a series of school readers,\r\nwhich enjoyed a well-deserved popularity for many years.\r\n\r\nHis poetry is smooth, musical, and vigorous. Most of his pieces were\r\nwritten for special occasions.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nHis falchion flashed along the Nile;\r\n  His hosts he led through Alpine snows;\r\nO\'er Moscow\'s towers, that blazed the while,\r\n  His eagle flag unrolled,--and froze.\r\nHere sleeps he now, alone! Not one\r\n  Of all the kings, whose crowns he gave,\r\nBends o\'er his dust;--nor wife nor son\r\n  Has ever seen or sought his grave.\r\n\r\nBehind this seagirt rock! the star,\r\n  That led him on from crown to crown,\r\nHas sunk; and nations from afar\r\n  Gazed as it faded and went down.\r\nHigh is his couch;--the ocean flood,\r\n  Far, far below, by storms is curled;\r\nAs round him heaved, while high he stood,\r\n  A stormy and unstable world.\r\n\r\nAlone he sleeps! The mountain cloud,\r\n  That night hangs round him, and the breath\r\nOf morning scatters, is the shroud\r\n  That wraps the conqueror\'s clay in death.\r\nPause here! The far-off world, at last,\r\n  Breathes free; the hand that shook its thrones,\r\nAnd to the earth its miters cast,\r\n  Lies powerless now beneath these stones.\r\n\r\nHark! comes there from the pyramids,\r\n  And from Siberian wastes of snow,\r\nAnd Europe\'s hills, a voice that bids\r\n  The world he awed to mourn him? No:\r\nThe only, the perpetual dirge\r\n  That\'s heard there is the sea bird\'s cry,--\r\nThe mournful murmur of the surge,--\r\n  The cloud\'s deep voice, the wind\'s low sigh.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.--Seagirt rock, the island of St. Helena, is in the Atlantic Ocean,\r\nnearly midway between Africa and South America. Napoleon was confined on\r\nthis island six years; until 1821, when he died and was buried there. In\r\n1841, his remains were removed to Paris.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX. WAR. (148)\r\n\r\nCharles Sumner. 1811-1874, was born in Boston. He studied at the Latin\r\nschool in his native city, graduated from Harvard University at the age of\r\nnineteen, studied law at the same institution, and was admitted to\r\npractice in 1834. He at once took a prominent position in his profession,\r\nlectured to the law classes at Cambridge for several successive years,\r\nwrote and edited several standard law books, and might have had a\r\nprofessorship in the law school, had he desired it. In his famous address\r\non "The True Grandeur of Nations," delivered July 4, 1815, before the\r\nmunicipal authorities of Boston, he took strong grounds against war among\r\nnations. In 1851 he was elected to the United States Senate and continued\r\nin that position till his death. As a jurist, as a statesman, as an\r\norator, and as a profound and scholarly writer, Mr. Sumner stands high in\r\nthe estimation of his countrymen. In physical appearance, Mr. Sumner was\r\ngrand and imposing; men often turned to gaze after him, as he passed along\r\nthe streets of his native city.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nI need not dwell now on the waste and cruelty of war. These stare us\r\nwildly in the face, like lurid meteor lights, as we travel the page of\r\nhistory. We see the desolation and death that pursue its demoniac\r\nfootsteps. We look upon sacked towns, upon ravaged territories, upon\r\nviolated homes; we behold all the sweet charities of life changed to\r\nwormwood and gall. Our soul is penetrated by the sharp moan of mothers,\r\nsisters, and daughters--of fathers, brothers, and sons, who, in the\r\nbitterness of their bereavement, refuse to be comforted. Our eyes rest at\r\nlast upon one of these fair fields, where Nature, in her abundance,\r\nspreads her cloth of gold, spacious and apt for the entertainment of\r\nmighty multitudes--or perhaps, from the curious subtlety of its position,\r\nlike the carpet in the Arabian tale, seeming to contract so as to be\r\ncovered by a few only, or to dilate so as to receive an innumerable host.\r\nHere, under a bright sun, such as shone at Austerlitz or Buena\r\nVista--amidst the peaceful harmonies of nature--on the Sabbath of\r\npeace--we behold bands of brothers, children of a common Father, heirs to\r\na common happiness, struggling together in the deadly fight, with the\r\nmadness of fallen spirits, seeking with murderous weapons the lives of\r\nbrothers who have never injured them or their kindred. The havoc rages.\r\nThe ground is soaked with their commingling blood. The air is rent by\r\ntheir commingling cries. Horse and rider are stretched together on the\r\nearth. More revolting than the mangled victims, than the gashed limbs,\r\nthan the lifeless trunks, than the spattering brains, are the lawless\r\npassions which sweep, tempest-like, through the fiendish tumult.\r\n\r\nHorror-struck, we ask, wherefore this hateful contest? The melancholy, but\r\ntruthful answer comes, that this is the established method of determining\r\njustice between nations!\r\n\r\nThe scene changes. Far away on the distant pathway of the ocean two ships\r\napproach each other, with white canvas broadly spread to receive the\r\nflying gales. They are proudly built. All of human art has been lavished\r\nin their graceful proportions, and in their well compacted sides, while\r\nthey look in their dimensions like floating happy islands on the sea. A\r\nnumerous crew, with costly appliances of comfort, hives in their secure\r\nshelter. Surely these two travelers shall meet in joy and friendship; the\r\nflag at the masthead shall give the signal of friendship; the happy\r\nsailors shall cluster in the rigging, and even on the yardarms, to look\r\neach other in the face, while the exhilarating voices of both crews shall\r\nmingle in accents of gladness uncontrollable. It is not so. Not as\r\nbrothers, not as friends, not as wayfarers of the common ocean, do they\r\ncome together; but as enemies.\r\n\r\nThe gentle vessels now bristle fiercely with death-dealing instruments. On\r\ntheir spacious decks, aloft on all their masts, flashes the deadly\r\nmusketry. From their sides spout cataracts of flame, amidst the pealing\r\nthunders of a fatal artillery. They, who had escaped "the dreadful touch\r\nof merchant-marring rocks"--who had sped on their long and solitary way\r\nunharmed by wind or wave--whom the hurricane had spared--in whose favor\r\nstorms and seas had intermitted their immitigable war--now at last fall\r\nby the hand of each other. The same spectacle of horror greets us from\r\nboth ships. On their decks, reddened with blood, the murderers of St.\r\nBartholomew and of the Sicilian Vespers, with the fires of Smithfield,\r\nseem to break forth anew, and to concentrate their rage. Each has now\r\nbecome a swimming Golgotha. At length, these vessels--such pageants of\r\nthe sea--once so stately--so proudly built--but now rudely shattered by\r\ncannon balls--with shivered mast\'s and ragged sails--exist only as\r\nunmanageable wrecks, weltering on the uncertain waves, whose temporary\r\nlull of peace is now their only safety. In amazement at this strange,\r\nunnatural contest--away from country and home--where there is no country\r\nor home to defend--we ask again, wherefore this dismal duel? Again the\r\nmelancholy but truthful answer promptly comes, that this is the\r\nestablished method of determining justice between nations.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--Austerlitz, a small town in Austria, seventy miles north from\r\nVienna. It is noted as the site of a battle, in December, 1805, between\r\nthe allied Austrian and Russian armies, and the French under Napoleon. The\r\nlatter were victorious. Buena Vista, a small hamlet in eastern Mexico,\r\nwhere, in 1847, five thousand Americans, under Gen. Taylor, defeated\r\ntwenty thousand Mexicans, under Gen. Santa Anna.\r\n\r\nDreadful touch.--Quoted from Merchant of Venice, Act III, Scene II.\r\n\r\nSt. Bartholomew.--A terrible massacre took place in France, on St.\r\nBartholomew\'s day, August 24, 1572.

SPEECH OF WALPOLE IN REPROOF OF MR. PITT. (151)\r\n\r\nSir Robert Walpole, 1676-1745, was educated at Eton and Cambridge. He\r\nentered Parliament in 1700, and soon became a good debater and skillful\r\ntactician. He was prime minister of Great Britain from 1721 to 1742, in\r\nthe reigns of George I. and George II. He was an able statesman; but has\r\nbeen accused of employing corruption or bribery on a large scale, to\r\ncontrol Parliament and accomplish his purposes.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nI was unwilling to interrupt the course of this debate, while it was\r\ncarried on with calmness and decency, by men who do not suffer the ardor\r\nof opposition to cloud their reason, or transport them to such expressions\r\nas the dignity of this assembly does not admit.\r\n\r\nI have hitherto deferred answering the gentleman, who declaimed against\r\nthe bill with such fluency and rhetoric, and such vehemence of gesture;\r\nwho charged the advocates for the expedients now proposed, with having no\r\nregard to any interests but their own, and with making laws only to\r\nconsume paper, and threatened them with the defection of their adherents,\r\nand the loss of their influence, upon this new discovery of their folly\r\nand ignorance. Nor, do I now answer him for any other purpose than to\r\nremind him how little the clamor of rage and petulancy of invective\r\ncontribute to the end for which this assembly is called together; how\r\nlittle the discovery of truth is promoted, and the security of the nation\r\nestablished, by pompous diction and theatrical emotion.\r\n\r\nFormidable sounds and furious declamation, confident assertions and lofty\r\nperiods, may affect the young and inexperienced; and perhaps the gentleman\r\nmay have contracted his habits of oratory by conversing more with those of\r\nhis own age than with such as have more opportunities of acquiring\r\nknowledge, and more successful methods of communicating their sentiments.\r\nIf the heat of temper would permit him to attend to those whose age and\r\nlong acquaintance with business give them an indisputable right to\r\ndeference and superiority, he would learn in time to reason, rather than\r\ndeclaim; and to prefer justness of argument and an accurate knowledge of\r\nfacts, to sounding epithets and splendid superlatives, which may disturb\r\nthe imagination for a moment, but leave no lasting impression upon the\r\nmind. He would learn, that to accuse and prove are very different; and\r\nthat reproaches, unsupported by evidence, affect only the character of him\r\nthat utters them.\r\n\r\nExcursions of fancy and flights of oratory are indeed pardonable in young\r\nmen, but in no other; and it would surely contribute more, even to the\r\npurpose for which some gentlemen appear to speak (that of depreciating the\r\nconduct of the administration), to prove the inconveniences and injustice\r\nof this bill, than barely to assert them, with whatever magnificence of\r\nlanguage, or appearance of zeal, honesty, or compassion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXII. PITT\'S REPLY TO SIR ROBERT WALPOLE. (152)\r\n\r\nWilliam Pitt, 1708--1778, one of the ablest statesmen and orators of his\r\ntime, was born in Cornwall, and educated at Eton and Oxford. He entered\r\nParliament in 1735, and became a formidable opponent of the ministry of\r\nSir Robert Walpole. He gained great reputation by his wise and vigorous\r\nmanagement of military affairs in the last years of the reign of George\r\nII. He opposed the "Stamp Act" with great earnestness, as well as the\r\ncourse of the ministry in the early years of the American Revolution. In\r\n1778, he rose from a sick bed to make his celebrated speech, in the House\r\nof Lords, in opposition to a motion to acknowledge the independence of\r\nAmerica. At its close, he fell in an apoplectic fit, and was borne home to\r\ndie in a few weeks afterward. He was buried in Westminster Abbey. Mr. Pitt\r\npossessed a fine personal presence and a powerful voice; he was very\r\npopular with the people, and is often called the "Great Commoner." He was\r\ncreated "Earl of Chatham" in 1766.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nThe atrocious crime of being a young man, which the honorable gentleman\r\nhas, with such spirit and decency, charged upon me, I shall neither\r\nattempt to palliate nor deny; but content myself with hoping that I may be\r\none of those whose follies cease with their youth, and not of that number\r\nwho are ignorant in spite of experience. Whether youth can be imputed to a\r\nman as a reproach, I will not assume the province of determining; but\r\nsurely age may become justly contemptible, if the opportunities which it\r\nbrings have passed away without improvement, and vice appears to prevail\r\nwhen the passions have subsided. The wretch, who, after having seen the\r\nconsequences of a thousand errors, continues still to blunder, and whose\r\nage has only added obstinacy to stupidity, is surely the object either of\r\nabhorrence or contempt, and deserves not that his gray hairs should secure\r\nhim from insult. Much more is he to be abhorred, who, as he has advanced\r\nin age, has receded from virtue, and become more wicked--with less\r\ntemptation; who prostitutes himself for money which he can not enjoy, and\r\nspends the remains of his life in the ruin of his country.\r\n\r\nBut youth is not my only crime; I am accused of acting a theatrical part.\r\nA theatrical part may either imply some peculiarity of gesture, or a\r\ndissimulation of my real sentiments, and an adoption of the opinions and\r\nlanguage of another man. In the first sense, the charge is too trifling to\r\nbe confuted, and deserves only to be mentioned that it may be despised. I\r\nam at liberty, like every other man, to use my own language; and though,\r\nperhaps, I may have some ambition to please this gentleman, I shall not\r\nlay myself under any restraint, nor very solicitously copy his diction or\r\nhis mien, however matured by age, or modeled by experience.\r\n\r\nBut, if any man shall, by charging me with theatrical behavior, imply that\r\nI utter any sentiments but my own, I shall treat him as a calumniator and\r\na villain; nor shall any protection shelter him from the treatment he\r\ndeserves. I shall, on such an occasion, without scruple, trample upon all\r\nthose forms with which wealth and dignity intrench themselves, nor shall\r\nanything but age restrain my resentment; age,--which always brings one\r\nprivilege, that of being insolent and supercilious, without punishment!\r\n\r\nBut, with regard to those whom I have offended, I am of opinion that, if I\r\nhad acted a borrowed part, I should have avoided their censure: the heat\r\nthat offended them was the ardor of conviction, and that zeal for the\r\nservice of my country which neither hope nor fear shall influence me to\r\nsuppress. I will not sit unconcerned while my liberty is invaded, nor look\r\nin silence upon public robbery. I will exert my endeavors, at whatever\r\nhazard, to repel the aggressor, and drag the thief to justice, whoever may\r\nprotect him in his villainies, and whoever may partake of his plunder.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIII. CHARACTER OF MR. PITT. (154)\r\n\r\nHenry Grattan, 1750-1820, an Irish orator and statesman, was born at\r\nDublin, and graduated from Trinity College, in his native city. By his\r\nadmiration of Mr. Pitt, the first Earl of Chatham, he was led to turn his\r\nattention to oratory. In personal appearance, he was unprepossessing; but\r\nhis private character was without a blemish.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nThe secretary stood alone. Modern degeneracy had not reached him. Original\r\nand unaccommodating, the features of his character had the hardihood of\r\nantiquity. His august mind overawed majesty itself. No state chicanery, no\r\nnarrow system of vicious politics, no idle contest for ministerial\r\nvictories, sank him to the vulgar level of the great; but overbearing,\r\npersuasive, and impracticable, his object was England, his ambition was\r\nfame.\r\n\r\nWithout dividing, he destroyed party; without corrupting, he made a venal\r\nage unanimous. France sunk beneath him. With one hand he smote the house\r\nof Bourbon, and wielded in the other the democracy of England. The sight\r\nof his mind was infinite; and his schemes were to effect, not England, not\r\nthe present age only, but Europe and posterity. Wonderful were the means\r\nby which those schemes were accomplished; always seasonable, always\r\nadequate, the suggestion of an understanding animated by ardor and\r\nenlightened by prophecy.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary feelings which make life amiable and indolent, were unknown\r\nto him. No domestic difficulties, no domestic weakness, reached him; but,\r\naloof from the sordid occurrences of life, and unsullied by its\r\nintercourse, he came occasionally into our system, to counsel and decide.\r\nA character so exalted, so strenuous, so various, so authoritative,\r\nastonished a corrupt age, and the treasury trembled at the name of Pitt,\r\nthrough all classes of venality. Corruption imagined, indeed, that she had\r\nfound defects in this statesman, and talked much of the inconsistency of\r\nhis glory, and much of the ruin of his victories; but the history of his\r\ncountry, and the calamities of the enemy, answered and refuted her.\r\n\r\nNor were his political his only talents. His eloquence was an era in the\r\nsenate; peculiar and spontaneous; familiarly expressing gigantic\r\nsentiments and instructive wisdom; not like the torrent of Demosthenes, or\r\nthe splendid conflagration of Tully; it resembled sometimes the thunder,\r\nand sometimes the music of the spheres. He did not conduct the\r\nunderstanding through the painful subtilty of argumentation, nor was he\r\never on the rack of exertion; but rather lightened upon the subject, and\r\nreached the point by the flashings of the mind, which, like those of the\r\neye, were felt, but could not be followed.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, there was in this man something that could create,\r\nsubvert, or reform; an understanding, a spirit, and an eloquence, to\r\nsummon mankind to society, or to break the bonds of slavery asunder, and\r\nto rule the wildness of free minds with unbounded authority; something\r\nthat could establish or overwhelm empires, and strike a blow in the world\r\nthat should resound through the universe.\r\n\r\nNOTES.--Demosthenes (b. 385, d. 322, B. C.) was the son of a cutler at\r\nAthens, Greece. By diligent study and unremitting toil, he became the\r\ngreatest orator that ever lived.\r\n\r\nTully, Marcus Tullius Cicero (b. 106, d. 43, B. C.), was the most\r\nremarkable of Roman orators. He held the highest office of the Republic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIV. THE SOLDIER\'S REST. (156)\r\n\r\nSir Walter Scott, 1771-1832, the great Scotch poet and novelist, was born\r\nin Edinburgh. Being a feeble child, he was sent to reside on his\r\ngrandfather\'s estate in the south of Scotland. Here he spent several\r\nyears, and gained much knowledge of the traditions of border warfare, as\r\nwell as of the tales and ballads pertaining to it. He was also a great\r\nreader of romances in his youth. In 1779 be returned to Edinburgh, and\r\nbecame a pupil in the high school. Four years later, he entered the\r\nuniversity; but in neither school nor college, was he distinguished for\r\nscholarship. In 1797 he was admitted to the practice of law,--a profession\r\nwhich he soon forsook for literature. His first poems appeared in 1802.\r\nThe "Lay of the Last Minstrel" was published in 1805, "Marmion" in 1808,\r\nand "The Lady of the Lake" in 1810. Several poems of less power followed.\r\nIn 1814 "Waverley," his first novel, made its appearance, but the author\r\nwas unknown for some time. Numerous other novels followed with great\r\nrapidity, the author reaping a rich harvest both in fame and money. In\r\n1811 he purchased an estate near the Tweed, to which he gave the name of\r\nAbbotsford. In enlarging his estate and building a costly house, he spent\r\nvast sums of money. This, together with the failure of his publishers in\r\n1826, involved him very heavily in debt. But he set to work with almost\r\nsuperhuman effort to pay his debts by the labors of his pen. In about four\r\nyears, he had paid more than $300,000; but the effort was too much for his\r\nstrength, and hastened his death.\r\n\r\nIn person, Scott was tall, and apparently robust, except a slight lameness\r\nwith which he was affected from childhood. He was kindly in disposition,\r\nhospitable in manner, fond of outdoor pursuits and of animals, especially\r\ndogs. He wrote with astonishing rapidity, and always in the early morning.\r\nAt his death, he left two sons and two daughters. A magnificent monument\r\nto his memory has been erected in the city of his birth. The following\r\nselection is from "The Lady of the Lake."\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nSoldier, rest! thy warfare o\'er,\r\n  Sleep the sleep that knows not breaking;\r\nDream of battlefields no more,\r\n  Days of danger, nights of waking.\r\nIn our isle\'s enchanted hall,\r\n  Hands unseen thy couch are strewing,\r\nFairy strains of music fall,\r\n  Every sense in slumber dewing.\r\nSoldier, rest! thy warfare o\'er,\r\nDream of battlefields no more;\r\nSleep the sleep that knows not breaking,\r\nMorn of toil, nor night of waking.\r\n\r\nNo rude sound shall reach thine ear,\r\n  Armor\'s clang, or war steed champing,\r\nTrump nor pibroch summon here\r\n  Mustering clan, or squadron tramping.\r\nYet the lark\'s shrill fife may come,\r\n  At the daybreak from the fallow,\r\nAnd the bittern sound his drum,\r\n  Booming from the sedgy shallow.\r\nRuder sounds shall none be near,\r\nGuards nor warders challenge here,\r\nHere\'s no war steed\'s neigh and champing,\r\nShouting clans or squadrons stamping.\r\n\r\nHuntsman, rest! thy chase is done;\r\n  While our slumb\'rous spells assail ye,\r\nDream not, with the rising sun,\r\n  Bugles here shall sound reveille.\r\nSleep! the deer is in his den;\r\n  Sleep! thy hounds are by thee lying;\r\nSleep! nor dream in yonder glen,\r\n  How thy gallant steed lay dying.\r\nHuntsman, rest; thy chase is done,\r\nThink not of the rising sun,\r\nFor at dawning to assail ye,\r\nHere no bugle sounds reveille.\r\n\r\nNOTES.--Pibroch (pro. pe\'brok). This is a wild, irregular species of\r\nmusic, peculiar to the Highlands of Scotland. It is performed on a\r\nbagpipe, and adapted to excite or assuage passion, and particularly to\r\nrouse a martial spirit among troops going to battle.\r\n\r\nReveille (pro. re-val\'ya) is an awakening call at daybreak. In the army it\r\nis usually sounded on the drum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXV. HENRY V. TO HIS TROOPS. (158)\r\n\r\nWilliam Shakespeare. 1564-1616, was born at Stratford-upon-Avon. By many\r\n(perhaps most) critics, Shakespeare is regarded as the greatest poet the\r\nworld has ever produced; one calls him, "The most illustrious of the sons\r\nof men." And yet it is a curious fact that less is really known of his\r\nlife and personal characteristics than is known of almost any other famous\r\nname in history. Over one hundred years ago, a writer said, "All that is\r\nknown with any degree of certainty concerning Shakespeare is--that he was\r\nborn at Stratford-upon-Avon--married and had children there--went to\r\nLondon, where he commenced acting, and wrote poems and plays--returned to\r\nStratford, made his will, died, and was buried." All the research of the\r\nlast one hundred years has added but very little to this meager record. He\r\nwas married, very young, to Anne Hathaway, a woman eight years his senior;\r\nwas joint proprietor of Blackfriar\'s Theater in 1589, and seems to have\r\naccumulated property, and retired three or four years before his death. He\r\nwas buried in Stratford Church, where a monument has been erected to his\r\nmemory; he also has a monument, in "Poet\'s Corner" of Westminster Abbey.\r\nHis family soon became extinct. From all we can learn, he seems to have\r\nbeen highly respected and esteemed by his cotemporaries.\r\n\r\nHis works consist chiefly of plays and sonnets. His writings show an\r\nastonishing knowledge of human nature, expressed in language wonderful for\r\nits point and beauty. His style is chaste and pure, judged by the standard\r\nof his times, although expressions may sometimes be found that would not\r\nbe considered proper in a modern writer. It has been argued by some that\r\nShakespeare did not write the works imputed to him; but this theory seems\r\nto have little to support it. This extract is from King Henry V., Act III,\r\nScene I.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;\r\nOr close the wall up with our English dead.\r\nIn peace there \'s nothing so becomes a man\r\nAs modest stillness and humility:\r\nBut when the blast of war blows in our ears,\r\nThen imitate the action of the tiger;\r\nStiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,\r\nDisguise fair nature with hard-favored rage;\r\nThen lend the eye a terrible aspect;\r\nLet it pry through the portage of the head\r\nLike the brass cannon; let the brow o\'erwhelm it\r\nAs fearfully as doth a galled rock\r\nO\'er hang and jutty his confounded base,\r\nSwilled with the wild and wasteful ocean.\r\n\r\nNow set the teeth, and stretch the nostril wide,\r\nHold hard the breath, and bend up every spirit\r\nTo its full height! On, on, you noblest English,\r\nWhose blood is fet from fathers of war proof!\r\nFathers, that, like so many Alexanders,\r\nHave, in these parts, from morn till even, fought,\r\nAnd sheathed their swords for lack of argument;\r\nBe copy now to men of grosser blood,\r\nAnd teach them how to war.\r\n\r\n                       And you, good yeomen,\r\nWhose limbs were made in England, show us here\r\nThe mettle of your pasture; let us swear\r\nThat you are worth your breeding, which I doubt not;\r\nFor there is none of you so mean and base,\r\nThat hath not noble luster in your eyes.\r\nI see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,\r\nStraining upon the start. The game\'s afoot;\r\nFollow your spirit: and, upon this charge,\r\nCry--"God for Harry, England, and St. George!"\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--Henry V. (1388-1422) was king of England for nine years. During\r\nthis reign almost continuous war raged in France, to the throne of which\r\nHenry laid claim. The battle of Agincourt took place in his reign.\r\n\r\nFet is the old form of fetched.\r\n\r\nAlexanders.--Alexander the Great (356-323 B. G) was king of Macedonia, and\r\nthe celebrated conqueror of Persia, India, and the greater part of the\r\nworld as then known.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVI. SPEECH OF PAUL ON MARS HILL. (160)\r\n\r\n\r\nThen Paul stood in the midst of Mars Hill, and said, Ye men of Athens! I\r\nperceive that in all things ye are too superstitious. For as I passed by,\r\nand beheld your devotions, I found an altar with this inscription, To THE\r\nUNKNOWN GOD. Whom therefore ye ignorantly worship, him declare I unto you.\r\nGod that made the world and all things therein (seeing that he is Lord of\r\nheaven and earth) dwelleth not in temples made with hands; neither is\r\nworshiped with men\'s hands, as though he needed anything, seeing he giveth\r\nto all life, and breath, and all things; and hath made of one blood all\r\nnations of men for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath\r\ndetermined the times before appointed, and the bounds of their habitation;\r\nthat they should seek the Lord, if haply they might feel after him, and\r\nfind him, though he be not far from everyone of us: for in him we live,\r\nand move, and have our being; as certain also of your own poets have said,\r\nFor we are also his offspring. Forasmuch then as we are the offspring of\r\nGod, we ought not to think that the Godhead is like unto gold, or silver,\r\nor stone, graven by art and man\'s device. And the times of this ignorance\r\nGod winked at; but now commandeth all men everywhere to repent: because he\r\nhath appointed a day, in the which he will judge the world in\r\nrighteousness by that Man whom he hath ordained; whereof he hath given\r\nassurance unto all men, in that he hath raised him from the dead. And when\r\nthey heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked: and others said,\r\nWe will hear thee again of this matter. So Paul departed from among them.\r\nHowbeit certain men clave unto him, and believed; among the which was\r\nDionysius the Areopagite, and a woman named Damaris, and others with them.\r\n\r\n                                                            --Bible.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--At the time this oration was delivered (50 A.

LAFAYETTE AND ROBERT RAIKES. (163)\r\n\r\nThomas S. Grimke\', 1786-1834, an eminent lawyer and scholar, was born in\r\nCharleston, South Carolina, graduated at Yale in 1807, and died of cholera\r\nnear Columbus, Ohio. He descended from a Huguenot family that was exiled\r\nfrom France by the revocation of the edict of Nantes. He gained\r\nconsiderable reputation as a politician, but is best known as an advocate\r\nof peace, Sunday Schools, and the Bible. He was a man of deep feeling,\r\nearnest purpose, and pure life. Some of his views were very radical and\r\nvery peculiar. He proposed sweeping reforms in English orthography[1], and\r\ndisapproved of the classics and of pure mathematics in any scheme of\r\ngeneral education. The following is an extract from an address delivered\r\nat a Sunday-school celebration.\r\n###\r\n\r\n[Transcriber\'s Footnote 1:  Orthography: Spelling using established\r\nusage.]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is but a few years since we beheld the most singular and memorable\r\npageant in the annals of time. It was a pageant more sublime and affecting\r\nthan the progress of Elizabeth through England after the defeat of the\r\nArmada; than the return of Francis I. from a Spanish prison to his own\r\nbeautiful France; than the daring and rapid march of the conqueror at\r\nAusterlitz from Frejus to Paris. It was a pageant, indeed, rivaled only in\r\nthe elements of the grand and the pathetic, by the journey of our own\r\nWashington through the different states. Need I say that I allude to the\r\nvisit of Lafayette to America?\r\n\r\nBut Lafayette returned to the land of the dead, rather than of the living.\r\nHow many who had fought with him in the war of \'76, had died in arms, and\r\nlay buried in the grave of the soldier or the sailor! How many who had\r\nsurvived the perils of battle, on the land and the ocean, had expired on\r\nthe deathbed of peace, in the arms of mother, sister, daughter, wife!\r\nThose. who survived to celebrate with him the jubilee of 1825, were\r\nstricken in years, and hoary-headed; many of them infirm in health; many\r\nthe victims of poverty, or misfortune, or affliction. And, how venerable\r\nthat patriotic company; how sublime their gathering through all the land;\r\nhow joyful their welcome, how affecting their farewell to that beloved\r\nstranger!\r\n\r\nBut the pageant has fled, and the very materials that gave it such depths\r\nof interest are rapidly perishing: and a humble, perhaps a nameless grave,\r\nshall hold the last soldier of the Revolution. And shall they ever meet\r\nagain? Shall the patriots and soldiers of \'76, the "Immortal Band," as\r\nhistory styles them, meet again in the amaranthine bowers of spotless\r\npurity, of perfect bliss, of eternal glory? Shall theirs be the\r\nChristian\'s heaven, the kingdom of the Redeemer? The heathen points to his\r\nfabulous Elysium as the paradise of the soldier and the sage. But the\r\nChristian bows down with tears and sighs, for he knows that not many of\r\nthe patriots, and statesmen, and warriors of Christian lands are the\r\ndisciples of Jesus.\r\n\r\nBut we turn from Lafayette, the favorite of the old and the new world, to\r\nthe peaceful benevolence, the unambitious achievements of Robert Raikes.\r\nLet us imagine him to have been still alive, and to have visited our land,\r\nto celebrate this day with us. No national ships would have been offered\r\nto bear him, a nation\'s guest, in the pride of the star-spangled banner,\r\nfrom the bright shores of the rising, to the brighter shores of the\r\nsetting sun. No cannon would have hailed him in the stern language of the\r\nbattlefield, the fortunate champion of Freedom, in Europe and America. No\r\nmartial music would have welcomed him in notes of rapture, as they rolled\r\nalong the Atlantic, and echoed through the valley of the Mississippi. No\r\nmilitary procession would have heralded his way through crowded streets,\r\nthickset with the banner and the plume, the glittering saber and the\r\npolished bayonet. No cities would have called forth beauty and fashion,\r\nwealth and rank, to honor him in the ballroom and theater. No states would\r\nhave escorted him from boundary to boundary, nor have sent their chief\r\nmagistrate to do him homage. No national liberality would have allotted to\r\nhim a nobleman\'s domain and princely treasure. No national gratitude would\r\nhave hailed him in the capitol itself, the nation\'s guest, because the\r\nnation\'s benefactor; and have consecrated a battle ship, in memory of his\r\nwounds and his gallantry.\r\n\r\nNot such would have been the reception of Robert Raikes, in the land of\r\nthe Pilgrims and of Penn, of the Catholic, the Cavalier, and the Huguenot.\r\nAnd who does not rejoice that it would be impossible thus to welcome this\r\nprimitive Christian, the founder of Sunday schools? His heralds would be\r\nthe preachers of the Gospel, and the eminent in piety, benevolence, and\r\nzeal. His procession would number in its ranks the messengers of the Cross\r\nand the disciples of the Savior, Sunday-school teachers and white-robed\r\nscholars. The temples of the Most High would be the scenes of his triumph.\r\nHomage and gratitude to him, would be anthems of praise and thanksgiving\r\nto God.\r\n\r\nParents would honor him as more than a brother; children would reverence\r\nhim as more than a father. The faltering words of age, the firm and sober\r\nvoice of manhood, the silvery notes of youth, would bless him as a\r\nChristian patron. The wise and the good would acknowledge him everywhere\r\nas a national benefactor, as a patriot even to a land of strangers. He\r\nwould have come a messenger of peace to a land of peace. No images of\r\ncamps, and sieges, and battles; no agonies of the dying and the wounded;\r\nno shouts of victory, or processions of triumph, would mingle with the\r\nrecollections of the multitude who welcomed him. They would mourn over no\r\ncommon dangers, trials, and calamities; for the road of duty has been to\r\nthem the path of pleasantness, the way of peace. Their memory of the past\r\nwould be rich in gratitude to God, and love to man; their enjoyment of the\r\npresent would be a prelude to heavenly bliss; their prospects of the\r\nfuture, bright and glorious as faith and hope. * * *\r\n\r\nSuch was the reception of Lafayette, the warrior; such would be that of\r\nRobert Raikes, the Howard of the Christian church. And which is the nobler\r\nbenefactor, patriot, and philanthropist? Mankind may admire and extol\r\nLafayette more than the founder of the Sunday schools; but religion,\r\nphilanthropy, and enlightened common sense must ever esteem Robert Raikes\r\nthe superior of Lafayette. His are the virtues, the services, the\r\nsacrifices of a more enduring and exalted order of being. His counsels and\r\ntriumphs belong less to time than to eternity.\r\n\r\nThe fame of Lafayette is of this world; the glory of Robert Raikes is of\r\nthe Redeemer\'s everlasting kingdom. Lafayette lived chiefly for his own\r\nage, and chiefly for his and our country; but Robert Raikes has lived for\r\nall ages and all countries. Perhaps the historian and biographer may never\r\ninterweave his name in the tapestry of national or individual renown. But\r\nthe records of every single church honor him as a patron; the records of\r\nthe universal Church, on earth as in heaven, bless him as a benefactor.\r\n\r\nThe time may come when the name of Lafayette will be forgotten; or when\r\nthe star of his fame, no longer glittering in the zenith, shall be seen,\r\npale and glimmering, on the verge of the horizon. But the name of Robert\r\nRaikes shall never be forgotten; and the lambent flame of his glory is\r\nthat eternal fire which rushed down from heaven to devour the sacrifice of\r\nElijah. Let mortals then admire and imitate Lafayette more than Robert\r\nRaikes. But the just made perfect, and the ministering spirits around the\r\nthrone of God, have welcomed him as a fellow-servant of the same Lord; as\r\na fellow-laborer in the same glorious cause of man\'s redemption; as a\r\ncoheir of the same precious promises and eternal rewards.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--Armada, the great fleet sent out in 1588, by Philip II. of Spain,\r\nfor the conquest of England, was defeated in the Channel by the English\r\nand Dutch fleets.

FALL OF CARDINAL WOLSEY. (167)\r\n\r\nWolsey. Farewell! a long farewell, to all my greatness!\r\n        This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth\r\n        The tender leaves of hopes; to-morrow blossoms,\r\n        And bears his blushing honors thick upon him;\r\n        The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,\r\n        And, when he thinks, good, easy man, full surely\r\n        His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,\r\n        And then he falls, as I do. I have ventured,\r\n        Like little, wanton boys that swim on bladders,\r\n        This many summers in a sea of glory,\r\n        But far beyond my depth: my high-blown pride\r\n        At length broke under me, and now has left me,\r\n        Weary and old with service, to the mercy\r\n        Of a rude stream, that must forever hide me.\r\n        Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye:\r\n        I feel my heart new open\'d. Oh, how wretched\r\n        Is that poor man that hangs on princes\' favors!\r\n        There is, betwixt that smile we would aspire to,\r\n        That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin,\r\n        More pangs and fears than wars or women have:\r\n        And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,\r\n        Never to hope again.\r\n\r\n                Enter CROMWELL, and stands amazed.\r\n\r\n                        Why, how now, Cromwell!\r\n\r\nCrom. I have no power to speak, sir.\r\nWol.                   What, amazed\r\n      At my misfortunes? Can thy spirit wonder,\r\n      A great man should decline? Nay, an you weep,\r\n      I am fall\'n indeed.\r\nCrom.                  How does your grace?\r\nWol.                                        Why, well;\r\n      Never so truly happy, my good Cromwell.\r\n      I know myself now; and I fed within me\r\n      A peace above all earthly dignities,\r\n      A still and quiet conscience. The king has cured me,\r\n      I humbly thank his grace; and from these shoulders,\r\n      These ruin\'d pillars, out of pity, taken\r\n      A load would sink a navy!--too much honor:\r\n      Oh, \'t is a burthen, Cromwell, \'tis a burthen,\r\n      Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven!\r\nCrom. I am glad your grace has made that right use of it.\r\nWol.  I hope I have: I am able now, methinks,\r\n      Out of a fortitude of soul I feel,\r\n      To endure more miseries, and greater far,\r\n      Than my weak-hearted enemies dare offer.\r\n      What news abroad?\r\nCrom.                   The heaviest, and the worst,\r\n      Is your displeasure with the king.\r\nWol.                    God bless him!\r\nCrom. The next is, that Sir Thomas More is chosen\r\n      Lord chancellor in your place.\r\nWol.                    That\'s somewhat sudden:\r\n      But he\'s a learned man. May he continue\r\n      Long in his highness\' favor, and do justice\r\n      For truth\'s sake and his conscience; that his bones,\r\n      When he has run his course, and sleeps in blessings,\r\n      May have a tomb of orphans\' tears wept on \'em!\r\n      What more?\r\nCrom.         That Cranmer is return\'d with welcome,\r\n      Install\'d lord archbishop of Canterbury.\r\nWol.  That\'s news indeed!\r\nCrom.                   Last, that the Lady Anne,\r\n      Whom the king hath in secrecy long married,\r\n      This day was viewed in open as his queen,\r\n      Going to chapel; and the voice is now\r\n      Only about her coronation.\r\nWol.  There was the weight that pull\'d me down. O Cromwell,\r\n      The king has gone beyond me: all my glories\r\n      In that one woman I have lost forever:\r\n      No sun shall ever usher forth mine honors,\r\n      Or gild again the noble troops that waited\r\n      Upon my smiles. Go! get thee from me! Cromwell;\r\n      I am a poor, fall\'n man, unworthy now\r\n      To be thy lord and master: seek the king;\r\n      That sun, I pray, may never set! I have told him\r\n      What and how true thou art: he will advance thee;\r\n      Some little memory of me will stir him--\r\n      I know his noble nature--not to let\r\n      Thy hopeful service perish, too: good Cromwell,\r\n      Neglect him not; make use now, and provide\r\n      For thine own future safety.\r\nCrom.                                   O my lord,\r\n      Must I, then, leave you? Must I needs forego\r\n      So good, so noble, and so true a master?\r\n      Bear witness, all that have not hearts of iron,\r\n      With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord.\r\n      The king shall have my service; but my prayers\r\n      Forever and forever shall be yours.\r\nWol.  Cromwell, I did not think to shed a tear\r\n      In all my miseries; but thou hast forced me,\r\n      Out of thy honest truth, to play the woman.\r\n      Let\'s dry our eyes: and thus far hear me, Cromwell;\r\n      And, when I am forgotten, as I shall be,\r\n      And sleep in dull, cold marble, where no mention\r\n      Of me more must be heard of, say, I taught thee;\r\n      Say, Wolsey, that once trod the ways of glory,\r\n      And sounded all the depths and shoals of honor,\r\n      Found thee a way, out of his wreck, to rise in;\r\n      A sure and safe one, though thy master missed it.\r\n      Mark but my fall, and that that ruin\'d me.\r\n      Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition:\r\n      By that sin fell the angels; how can man, then,\r\n      The image of his Maker, hope to win by it?\r\n      Love thyself last: cherish those hearts that hate thee;\r\n      Corruption wins not more than honesty.\r\n      Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace,\r\n      To silence envious tongues. Be just, and fear not:\r\n      Let all the ends thou aim\'st at be thy country\'s,\r\n      Thy God\'s, and truth\'s; then, if thou fall\'st, O Cromwell,\r\n      Thou fall\'st, a blessed martyr! Serve the king;\r\n      And,--prithee, lead me in:\r\n      There, take an inventory of all I have,\r\n      To the last penny; \'t is the king\'s: my robe,\r\n      And my integrity to Heaven, is all\r\n      I dare now call mine own. O Cromwell, Cromwell!\r\n      Had I but served my God with half the zeal\r\n      I served my king, He would not in mine age\r\n      Have left me naked to mine enemies.\r\nCrom. Good sir, have patience.\r\nWol.                            So I have. Farewell\r\n      The hopes of court! my hopes in Heaven do dwell.\r\n\r\n                  Shakespeare.--Henry VIII, Act iii, Scene ii.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--Wolsey, Cardinal Thomas (b. 1471, d. 1530), was for several years\r\nthe favored minister or Henry VIII. of England. He acquired great wealth\r\nand power. In 1522, he was one of the candidates for the Papal Throne. In\r\n1529, he was disgraced at the English court and arrested.\r\n\r\nCromwell, Thomas (b. 1490, d. 1540), was Wolsey\'s servant, After Wolsey\'s\r\ndeath, he became secretary to Henry VIII., and towards the close of his\r\nlife was made Earl of Essex.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXL. THE PHILOSOPHER. (171)\r\n\r\nJohn P. Kennedy, 1796-1870. This gentleman, eminent in American politics\r\nand literature, was born in Baltimore, graduated at the College of\r\nBaltimore, and died in the same city. He served several years in the\r\nLegislature of his native state, and three terms in the United States\r\nHouse of Representatives. He was Secretary of the Navy during a part of\r\nPresident Fillmore\'s administration, and was active in sending out the\r\nfamous Japan expedition, and Dr. Kane\'s expedition in search of Sir John\r\nFranklin. Mr. Kennedy wrote several novels, as well as political and other\r\npapers. His writings are marked by ease and freshness, The following\r\nextract is from "Swallow Barn," a series of sketches of early Virginia.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the house at Swallow Barn there is to be seen, at no great distance,\r\na clump of trees, and in the midst of these a humble building is\r\ndiscernible, that seems to court the shade in which it is modestly\r\nembowered. It is an old structure built of logs. Its figure is a cube,\r\nwith a roof rising from all sides to a point, and surmounted by a wooden\r\nweathercock, which somewhat resembles a fish and somewhat a fowl.\r\n\r\nThis little edifice is a rustic shrine devoted to Cadmus, and is under the\r\ndominion of parson Chub. He is a plump, rosy old gentleman, rather short\r\nand thickset, with the blood vessels meandering over his face like\r\nrivulets,--a pair of prominent blue eyes, and a head of silky hair not\r\nunlike the covering of a white spaniel. He may be said to be a man of\r\njolly dimensions, with an evident taste for good living, sometimes sloven\r\nin his attire, for his coat--which is not of the newest--is decorated with\r\nsundry spots that are scattered over it in constellations. Besides this,\r\nhe wears an immense cravat, which, as it is wreathed around his short\r\nneck, forms a bowl beneath his chin, and--as Ned says--gives the parson\'s\r\nhead the appearance of that of John the Baptist upon a charger, as it is\r\nsometimes represented in the children\'s picture books. His beard is\r\ngrizzled with silver stubble, which the parson reaps about twice a\r\nweek--if the weather be fair.\r\n\r\nMr. Chub is a philosopher after the order of Socrates. He was an emigrant\r\nfrom the Emerald Isle, where he suffered much tribulation in the\r\ndisturbances, as they are mildly called, of his much-enduring country. But\r\nthe old gentleman has weathered the storm without losing a jot of that\r\nbroad, healthy benevolence with which Nature has enveloped his heart, and\r\nwhose ensign she has hoisted in his face. The early part of his life had\r\nbeen easy and prosperous, until the rebellion of 1798 stimulated his\r\nrepublicanism into a fever, and drove the full-blooded hero headlong into\r\na quarrel, and put him, in spite of his peaceful profession, to standing\r\nby his pike in behalf of his principles. By this unhappy boiling over of\r\nthe caldron of his valor, he fell under the ban of the ministers, and\r\ntested his share of government mercy. His house was burnt over his head,\r\nhis horses and hounds (for, by all accounts, he was a perfect Actaeon)\r\nwere "confiscate to the state," and he was forced to fly. This brought him\r\nto America in no very compromising mood with royalty.\r\n\r\nHere his fortunes appear to have been various, and he was tossed to and\r\nfro by the battledoor of fate, until he found a snug harbor at Swallow\r\nBarn; where, some years ago, he sat down in that quiet repose which a\r\nworried and badgered patriot is best fitted to enjoy.\r\n\r\nHe is a good scholar, and, having confined his readings entirely to the\r\nlearning of the ancients, his republicanism is somewhat after the Grecian\r\nmold. He has never read any politics of later date than the time of the\r\nEmperor Constantine, not even a newspaper,--so that he may be said to have\r\nbeen contemporary with AEschines rather than Lord Castlereagh--until that\r\neventful epoch of his life when his blazing rooftree awakened him from his\r\nanachronistical dream. This notable interruption, however, gave him but a\r\nfeeble insight into the moderns, and he soon relapsed to Thucydides and\r\nLivy, with some such glimmerings of the American Revolution upon his\r\nremembrance as most readers have of the exploits of the first Brutus.\r\n\r\nThe old gentleman had a learned passion for folios. He had been a long\r\ntime urging Meriwether to make some additions to his collections of\r\nliterature, and descanted upon the value of some of the ancient authors as\r\nfoundations, both moral and physical, to the library. Frank gave way to\r\nthe argument, partly to gratify the parson, and partly from the\r\nproposition itself having a smack that touched his fancy. The matter was\r\ntherefore committed entirely to Mr. Chub, who forthwith set out on a\r\nvoyage of exploration to the north. I believe he got as far as Boston. He\r\ncertainly contrived to execute his commission with a curious felicity.\r\nSome famous Elzevirs were picked up, and many other antiques that nobody\r\nbut Mr. Chub would ever think of opening.\r\n\r\nThe cargo arrived at Swallow Burn in the dead of winter. During the\r\ninterval between the parson\'s return from his expedition and the coming of\r\nthe books, the reverend little schoolmaster was in a remarkably unquiet\r\nstate of body, which almost prevented him from sleeping: and it is said\r\nthat the sight of the long-expected treasures had the happiest effect\r\nupon him. There was ample accommodation for this new acquisition of\r\nancient wisdom provided before its arrival, and Mr. Chub now spent a whole\r\nweek in arranging the volumes on their proper shelves, having, as report\r\naffirms, altered the arrangement at least seven times during that period.\r\nEverybody wondered what the old gentleman was at, all this time; but it\r\nwas discovered afterwards, that he was endeavoring to effect a\r\ndistribution of the works according to a minute division of human science,\r\nwhich entirely failed, owing to the unlucky accident of several of his\r\ndepartments being without any volumes.\r\n\r\nAfter this matter was settled, he regularly spent his evenings in the\r\nlibrary. Frank Meriwether was hardly behind the parson in this fancy, and\r\ntook, for a short time, to abstruse reading. They both consequently\r\ndeserted the little family circle every evening after tea, and might have\r\ncontinued to do so all the winter but for a discovery made by Hazard.\r\n\r\nNed had seldom joined the two votaries of science in their philosophical\r\nretirement, and it was whispered in the family that the parson was giving\r\nFrank a quiet course of lectures in the ancient philosophy, for Meriwether\r\nwas known to talk a great deal, about that time, of the old and new\r\nAcademicians. But it happened upon one dreary winter night, during a\r\ntremendous snowstorm, which was banging the shutters and doors of the\r\nhouse so as to keep up a continual uproar, that Ned, having waited in the\r\nparlor for the philosophers until midnight, set out to invade their\r\nretreat--not doubting that he should find them deep in study. When he\r\nentered the library, both candles were burning in their sockets, with\r\nlong, untrimmed wicks; the fire was reduced to its last embers, and, in an\r\narmchair on one side of the table, the parson was discovered in a sound\r\nsleep over Jeremy Taylor\'s "Ductor Dubitantium," whilst Frank, in another\r\nchair on the opposite side, was snoring over a folio edition of Montaigne.\r\nAnd upon the table stood a small stone pitcher, containing a residuum of\r\nwhisky punch, now grown cold. Frank started up in great consternation upon\r\nhearing Ned\'s footstep beside him, and, from that time, almost entirely\r\ndeserted the library. Mr. Chub, however, was not so easily drawn away from\r\nthe career of his humor, and still shows his hankering after his\r\nleather-coated friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--Cadmus is said to have taught the Greeks the use of the alphabet.\r\n\r\nSocrates (b. 469, d. 399 B.

(176)\r\n\r\nNot far advanced was morning day,\r\nWhen Marmion did his troop array\r\n  To Surrey\'s camp to ride;\r\nHe had safe conduct for his band,\r\nBeneath the royal seal and hand,\r\n  And Douglas gave a guide.\r\n\r\nThe train from out the castle drew,\r\nBut Marmion stopped to bid adieu:\r\n"Though something I might plain," he said,\r\n  "Of cold respect to stranger guest,\r\n  Sent hither by your king\'s behest,\r\nWhile in Tantallon\'s towers I staid,\r\n  Part we in friendship from your land,\r\n  And, noble Earl, receive my hand."\r\nBut Douglas round him drew his cloak,\r\nFolded his arms, and thus he spoke:\r\n  "My manors, halls, and bowers shall still\r\n  Be open, at my sovereign\'s will,\r\n    To each one whom he lists, howe\'er\r\n    Unmeet to be the owner\'s peer.\r\n  My castles are my king\'s alone,\r\n  From turret to foundation stone;\r\n  The hand of Douglas is his own;\r\n    And never shall, in friendly grasp,\r\n    The hand of such as Marmion clasp."\r\n\r\nBurned Marmion\'s swarthy cheek like fire,\r\nAnd shook his very frame for ire;\r\n  And--"This to me!" he said,--\r\n"An \'t were not for thy hoary beard,\r\nSuch hand as Marmion\'s had not spared\r\n  To cleave the Douglas\' head!\r\nAnd, first, I tell thee, haughty peer,\r\nHe who does England\'s message here,\r\nAlthough the meanest in her state,\r\nMay well, proud Angus, be thy mate:\r\nAnd, Douglas, more, I tell thee here,\r\n  Even in thy pitch of pride,\r\nHere, in thy hold, thy vassals near,\r\n  I tell thee, thou\'rt defied!\r\nAnd if thou said\'st I am not peer\r\nTo any lord in Scotland here,\r\nLowland or Highland, far or near,\r\n  Lord Angus, thou hast lied!"\r\n\r\nOn the Earl\'s cheek the flush of rage\r\nO\'ercame the ashen hue of age.\r\nFierce he broke forth,--"And dar\'st thou then\r\nTo beard the lion in his den,\r\n  The Douglas in his hall?\r\nAnd hop\'st thou hence unscathed to go?\r\nNo, by Saint Bride of Bothwell, no!\r\nUp drawbridge, grooms,--what, warder, ho!\r\n  Let the portcullis fall."\r\nLord Marmion turned,--well was his need,--\r\nAnd dashed the rowels in his steed,\r\nLike arrow through the archway sprung;\r\nThe ponderous gate behind him rung:\r\nTo pass there was such scanty room,\r\nThe bars, descending, razed his plume.\r\n\r\nThe steed along the drawbridge flies,\r\nJust as it trembled on the rise;\r\nNor lighter does the swallow skim\r\nAlong the smooth lake\'s level brim:\r\nAnd when Lord Marmion reached his band\r\nHe halts, and turns with clenched hand, [1]\r\nAnd shout of loud defiance pours,\r\nAnd shook his gauntlet at the towers.\r\n\r\n[Transcriber\'s Note 1: clenched, pronounced "clench-ed".]\r\n\r\n"Horse! horse!" the Douglas cried, "and chase!"\r\nBut soon he reined his fury\'s pace:\r\n"A royal messenger he came,\r\nThough most unworthy of the name.\r\nSaint Mary mend my fiery mood!\r\nOld age ne\'er cools the Douglas\' blood;\r\nI thought to slay him where he stood.\r\n\'Tis pity of him, too," he cried;\r\n"Bold he can speak, and fairly ride;\r\nI warrant him a warrior tried."\r\nWith this his mandate he recalls,\r\nAnd slowly seeks his castle halls.\r\n                                   --Walter Scott.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A man in armor on a galloping horse; he is waving a\r\nclenched fist at a group behind a closed iron gate to a castle.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES:--In the poem from which this extract is taken, Marmion is\r\nrepresented as an embassador sent by Henry VIII., king of England, to\r\nJames IV., king of Scotland, with whom he was at war. Having finished his\r\nmission to James, Marmion was intrusted to the protection and hospitality\r\nof Douglas, one of the Scottish nobles. Douglas entertained him, treated\r\nhim with the respect due to his office and to the honor of his sovereign,\r\nyet he despised his private character. Marmion perceived this, and took\r\numbrage at it, though he attempted to repress his resentment, and desired\r\nto part in peace. Under these circumstances the scene, as described in\r\nthis sketch, takes place.\r\n\r\nTantallon is the name of the Douglas castle at Bothwell, Scotland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLII. THE PRESENT. (178)\r\n\r\nAdelaide Anne Procter, 1825-1864, was the daughter of Bryan Waller\r\nProcter, known in literature as "Barry Cornwall." She is the author of\r\nseveral volumes of poetry, and was a contributor to "Good Words," "All the\r\nYear Round," and other London periodicals. Her works have been republished\r\nin America.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nDo not crouch to-day, and worship\r\n  The dead Past, whose life is fled\r\nHush your voice in tender reverence;\r\n  Crowned he lies, but cold and dead:\r\nFor the Present reigns, our monarch,\r\n  With an added weight of hours;\r\nHonor her, for she is mighty!\r\n  Honor her, for she is ours!\r\n\r\nSee the shadows of his heroes\r\n  Girt around her cloudy throne;\r\nEvery day the ranks are strengthened\r\n  By great hearts to him unknown;\r\nNoble things the great Past promised,\r\n  Holy dreams, both strange and new;\r\nBut the Present shall fulfill them;\r\n  What he promised, she shall do.\r\n\r\nShe inherits all his treasures,\r\n  She is heir to all his fame,\r\nAnd the light that lightens round her\r\n  Is the luster of his name;\r\nShe is wise with all his wisdom,\r\n  Living on his grave she stands,\r\nOn her brow she bears his laurels,\r\n  And his harvest in her hands.\r\n\r\nCoward, can she reign and conquer\r\n  If we thus her glory dim?\r\nLet us fight for her as nobly\r\n  As our fathers fought for him.\r\nGod, who crowns the dying ages,\r\n  Bids her rule, and us obey,\r\nBids us cast our lives before her,\r\n  Bids us serve the great To-day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIII. THE BAPTISM. (180)\r\n\r\nJohn Wilson, 1785-1854, a distinguished Scottish author, was born at\r\nPaisley. When fifteen years of age, he entered the University of Glasgow;\r\nbut, three years later, he became a member of Magdalen College, Oxford.\r\nHere he attained eminence both as a student, and as a proficient in\r\ngymnastic games and exercises. Soon after graduating, he purchased an\r\nestate near Lake Windermere, and became a companion of Wordsworth and\r\nSouthey; but he soon left his estate to reside in Edinburgh. In 1817, when\r\n"Blackwood\'s Magazine" was established in opposition to the "Edinburgh\r\nReview," he became chief contributor to that famous periodical. In its\r\npages, he won his chief fame as a writer. In 1820, he succeeded Dr. Thomas\r\nBrown as Professor of Moral Philosophy in the University of Edinburgh;\r\nthis position he held for thirty years. His "Lights and Shadows of\r\nScottish Life" was published in 1822. This is a collection of pathetic and\r\nbeautiful tales of domestic life in Scotland. His contributions to\r\nBlackwood appeared over the pseudonym of "Christopher North," or more\r\nfamiliarly, "Kit North." Professor Wilson was a man of great physical\r\npower and of striking appearance. In character, he was vehement and\r\nimpulsive; but his writings show that he possessed feelings of deep\r\ntenderness.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rite of baptism had not been performed for several months in the kirk\r\nof Lanark. It was now the hottest time of persecution; and the inhabitants\r\nof that parish found other places in which to worship God, and celebrate\r\nthe ordinances of religion. It was now the Sabbath day, and a small\r\ncongregation of about a hundred souls had met for divine service, in a\r\nplace more magnificent than any temple that human hands had ever built to\r\nDeity. The congregation had not assembled to the toll of the bell, but\r\neach heart knew the hour and observed it; for there are a hundred sundials\r\namong the hills, woods, moors, and fields; and the shepherd and the\r\npeasant see the hours passing by them in sunshine and shadow.\r\n\r\nThe church in which they were assembled, was hewn by God\'s hand out of the\r\neternal rock. A river rolled its way through a mighty chasm of cliffs,\r\nseveral hundred feet high, of which the one side presented enormous\r\nmasses, and the other corresponding recesses, as if the great stone girdle\r\nhad been rent by a convulsion. The channel was overspread with prodigious\r\nfragments of rocks or large loose stones, some of them smooth and bare,\r\nothers containing soil and verdure in their rents and fissures, and here\r\nand there crowned with shrubs and trees. The eye could at once command a\r\nlong-stretching vista, seemingly closed and shut up at both extremities by\r\nthe coalescing cliffs. This majestic reach of river contained pools,\r\nstreams, and waterfalls innumerable; and when the water was low--which was\r\nnow the case, in the common drought--it was easy to walk up this scene\r\nwith the calm, blue sky overhead, an utter and sublime solitude.\r\n\r\nOn looking up, the soul was bowed down by the feeling of that prodigious\r\nheight of unscalable, and often overhanging, cliff. Between the channel\r\nand the summit of the far extended precipices, were perpetually flying\r\nrooks and wood pigeons, and now and then a hawk, filling the profound\r\nabyss with their wild cawing, deep murmur, or shrilly shriek. Sometimes a\r\nheron would stand erect and still, on some little stone island, or rise up\r\nlike a white cloud along the black walls of the chasm, and disappear.\r\nWinged creatures alone could inhabit this region. The fox and wild cat\r\nchose more accessible haunts. Yet, here came the persecuted Christians and\r\nworshiped God, whose hand hung over their head those magnificent pillars\r\nand arches, scooped out those galleries from the solid rock, and laid at\r\ntheir feet the calm water, in its transparent beauty, in which they could\r\nsee themselves sitting, in reflected groups, with their Bibles in their\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nHere, upon a semicircular ledge of rocks, over a narrow chasm, of which\r\nthe tiny stream played in a murmuring waterfall, and divided the\r\ncongregation into two equal parts, sat about a hundred persons, all\r\ndevoutly listening to their minister, who stood before them on what might\r\nhe called a small, natural pulpit of living stone. Up to it there led a\r\nshort flight of steps, and over it waved the canopy of a tall, graceful\r\nbirch tree. The pulpit stood in the middle of the channel, directly facing\r\nthe congregation, and separated from them by the clear, deep, sparkling\r\npool, into which the scarce-heard water poured over the blackened rock.\r\nThe water, as it left the pool, separated into two streams, and flowed on\r\neach side of that altar, thus placing it in an island, whose large, mossy\r\nstones were richly embowered under the golden blossoms and green tresses\r\nof the broom.\r\n\r\nAt the close of divine service, a row of maidens, all clothed in purest\r\nwhite, came gliding off from the congregation, and, crossing the murmuring\r\nstream on stepping stones, arranged themselves at the foot of the pulpit\r\nwith those who were about to be baptized. Their devout fathers, just as\r\nthough they had been in their own kirk, had been sitting there during\r\nworship, and now stood up before the minister. The baptismal water, taken\r\nfrom that pellucid pool, was lying, consecrated, in an appropriate\r\nreceptacle, formed by the upright stones that composed one side of the\r\npulpit, and the holy rite proceeded.\r\n\r\nSome of the younger ones in that semicircle kept gazing down into the\r\npool, in which the whole scene was reflected; and now and then, in spite\r\nof the grave looks and admonishing whispers of their elders, letting fall\r\na pebble into the water, that they might judge of its depth, from the\r\nlength of time that elapsed before the clear air bells lay sparkling on\r\nthe agitated surface. The rite was over, and the religious service of the\r\nday closed by a psalm. The mighty rocks hemmed in the holy sound, and sent\r\nit in a more compact volume, clear, sweet, and strong, up to heaven. When\r\nthe psalm ceased, an echo, like a spirit\'s voice, was heard dying away,\r\nhigh up among the magnificent architecture of the cliffs; and once more\r\nmight be noticed in the silence, the reviving voice of the waterfall.\r\n\r\nJust then, a large stone fell from the top of the cliff into the pool, a\r\nloud voice was heard, and a plaid was hung over on the point of a\r\nshepherd\'s staff. Their wakeful sentinel had descried danger, and this was\r\nhis warning. Forthwith, the congregation rose. There were paths, dangerous\r\nto unpracticed feet, along the ledges of the rocks, leading up to several\r\ncaves and places of concealment. The more active and young assisted the\r\nelder, more especially the old pastor, and the women with the infants; and\r\nmany minutes had not elapsed, till not a living creature was visible in\r\nthe channel of the stream, but all of them were hidden, or nearly so, in\r\nthe clefts and caverns.\r\n\r\nThe shepherd who had given the alarm, had lain down again instantly in his\r\nplaid on the greensward, upon the summit of these precipices. A party of\r\nsoldiers was immediately upon him, and demanded what signals he had been\r\nmaking, and to whom; when one of them, looking over the edge of the cliff,\r\nexclaimed, "See, see! Humphrey, We have caught the whole tabernacle of the\r\nLord in a net at last. There they are, praising God among the stones of\r\nthe river Mouse. These are the Cartland Craigs. A noble cathedral!" "Fling\r\nthe lying sentinel over the cliffs. Here is a canting Covenanter for you,\r\ndeceiving honest soldiers on the very Sabbath day. Over with him, over\r\nwith him; out of the gallery into the pit." But the shepherd had vanished\r\nlike a shadow, and, mixing with the tall, green broom and bushes, was\r\nmaking his unseen way toward a wood. "Satan has saved his servant; but\r\ncome, my lads, follow me. I know the way down into the bed of the stream,\r\nand the steps up to Wallace\'s Cave. They are called, \'kittle nine stanes;\'\r\nThe hunt\'s up. We\'ll all be in at the death. Halloo! my boys, halloo!"\r\n\r\nThe soldiers dashed down a less precipitous part of the wooded banks, a\r\nlittle below the "craigs," and hurried up the channel. But when they\r\nreached the altar where the old, gray-haired minister had been seen\r\nstanding, and the rocks that had been covered with people, all was silent\r\nand solitary; not a creature to be seen. "Here is a Bible, dropped by some\r\nof them," cried a soldier, and, with his foot, he spun it away into the\r\npool. "A bonnet, a bonnet," cried another; "now for the pretty, sanctified\r\nface, that rolled its demure eyes below it." But after a few jests and\r\noaths, the soldiers stood still, eying with a kind of mysterious dread the\r\nblack and silent walls of the rocks that hemmed them in, and hearing only\r\nthe small voice of the stream that sent a profounder stillness through the\r\nheart of that majestic solitude. "What if these cowardly Covenanters\r\nshould tumble down upon our heads pieces of rock, from their hiding\r\nplaces! Advance, or retreat?"\r\n\r\nThere was no reply; for a slight fear was upon every man. Musket or\r\nbayonet could be of little use to men obliged to clamber up rocks, along\r\nslender paths, leading they know not where. And they were aware that armed\r\nmen nowadays worshiped God; men of iron hearts, who feared not the glitter\r\nof the soldier\'s arms, neither barrel nor bayonet; men of long stride,\r\nfirm step, and broad breast, who, on the open field, would have overthrown\r\nthe marshaled line, and gone first and foremost, if a city had to be taken\r\nby storm.\r\n\r\nAs the soldiers were standing together irresolute, a noise came upon their\r\nears like distant thunder, but even more appalling; and a slight current\r\nof air, as if propelled by it, passed whispering along the sweetbriers,\r\nand the broom, and the tresses of the birch trees. It came deepening, and\r\nrolling, and roaring on; and the very Cartland Craigs shook to their\r\nfoundation, as if in an earthquake. "The Lord have mercy upon us! What is\r\nthis?" And down fell many of the miserable wretches on their knees, and\r\nsome on their faces, upon the sharp-pointed rocks. Now, it was like the\r\nsound of many myriads of chariots rolling on their iron axles down the\r\nstrong channel of the torrent. The old, gray-haired minister issued from\r\nthe mouth of Wallace\'s Cave, and said, in a loud voice, "The Lord God\r\nterrible reigneth!"\r\n\r\nA waterspout had burst up among the moorlands, and the river, in its\r\npower, was at hand. There it came, tumbling along into that long reach of\r\ncliffs, and, in a moment, filled it with one mass of waves. Huge, agitated\r\nclouds of foam rode on the surface of a blood-red torrent. An army must\r\nhave been swept off by that flood. The soldiers perished in a moment; but\r\nhigh up in the cliffs, above the sweep of destruction, were the\r\nCovenanters, men, women, and children, uttering prayers to God, unheard by\r\nthemselves, in the raging thunder.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--Lanark is a small town in the valley of the Clyde, in Scotland. It\r\nis thirty miles southwest from Edinburgh.\r\n\r\nMouse River flows to the Clyde from the hills north of Larmrk.\r\nCovenanter.--Under Charles I., the Scotch were so oppressed that they\r\norganized in resistance. The covenant was a famous paper, largely signed,\r\nin which they agreed to continue in the profession of their faith, and\r\nresist all errors.\r\n\r\nWallace\'s Cave.--William Wallace (b. 1270, d. 1305) was the foremost Scot\r\nof his times. He was declared, in the absence of the king, guardian of the\r\nkingdom. More than once was he outlawed and obliged to seek safety by\r\nconcealment in the woods and caves.\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIV. SPARROWS. (185)\r\n\r\nAdeline D. Train Whitney, 1824--, was born in Boston, and was educated in\r\nthe school of Dr. George B. Emerson. Her father was Enoch Train, a\r\nwell-known merchant of that city. At the age of nineteen, she became the\r\nwife of Mr. Seth D. Whitney. Her literary career began about 1856, since\r\nwhich time she has written several novels and poems; a number of them\r\nfirst appeared in the "Atlantic Monthly." Her writings are marked by grace\r\nand sprightliness.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nLittle birds sit on the telegraph wires,\r\n  And chitter, and flitter, and fold their wings;\r\nMaybe they think that, for them and their sires,\r\n  Stretched always, on purpose, those wonderful strings:\r\nAnd, perhaps, the Thought that the world inspires,\r\n  Did plan for the birds, among other things.\r\n\r\nLittle birds sit on the slender lines,\r\n  And the news of the world runs under their feet,--\r\nHow value rises, and how declines,\r\n  How kings with their armies in battle meet,--\r\nAnd, all the while, \'mid the soundless signs,\r\n  They chirp their small gossipings, foolish sweet.\r\n\r\nLittle things light on the lines of our lives,--\r\n  Hopes, and joys, and acts of to-day,--\r\nAnd we think that for these the Lord contrives,\r\n  Nor catch what the hidden lightnings say.\r\nYet, from end to end, His meaning arrives,\r\n  And His word runs underneath, all the way.\r\n\r\nIs life only wires and lightning, then,\r\n  Apart from that which about it clings?\r\nAre the thoughts, and the works, and the prayers of men\r\n  Only sparrows that light on God\'s telegraph strings,\r\nHolding a moment, and gone again?\r\n  Nay; He planned for the birds, with the larger things.\r\n\r\n\r\nXLV. OBSERVANCE OF THE SABBATH. (186)\r\n\r\nGardiner Spring, 1785-1873, was the son of Samuel Spring, D.D., who was\r\npastor of a Congregational church in Newburyport, Massachusetts, for more\r\nthan forty years. The son entered Yale College, and was valedictorian of\r\nhis class in 1805. He studied law for a time; then went to Bermuda, where\r\nhe taught nearly two years. On his return he completed his law studies,\r\nand practiced his profession for more than a year. In 1810, having studied\r\ntheology at Andover, he was ordained as pastor of the "Brick Church" in\r\nNew York City. Here he remained till his death. He was elected president\r\nof Dartmouth College, and also of Hamilton, but declined both positions.\r\nHis works, embracing about twenty octavo volumes, have passed through\r\nseveral editions; some have been translated into foreign languages, and\r\nreprinted in Europe. As a preacher, Dr. Spring was eloquent and energetic.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sabbath lies at the foundation of all true morality. Morality flows\r\nfrom principle. Let the principles of moral obligation become relaxed, and\r\nthe practice of morality will not long survive the overthrow. No man can\r\npreserve his own morals, no parent can preserve the morals of his\r\nchildren, without the impressions of religious obligation.\r\n\r\nIf you can induce a community to doubt the genuineness and authenticity of\r\nthe Scriptures; to question the reality and obligations of religion; to\r\nhesitate, undeciding, whether there be any such thing as virtue or vice;\r\nwhether there be an eternal state of retribution beyond the grave; or\r\nwhether there exists any such being as God, you have broken down the\r\nbarriers of moral virtue, and hoisted the flood gates of immorality and\r\ncrime. I need not say that when a people have once done this, they can no\r\nlonger exist as a tranquil and happy people. Every bond that holds society\r\ntogether would be ruptured; fraud and treachery would take the place of\r\nconfidence between man and man; the tribunals of justice would be scenes\r\nof bribery and injustice; avarice, perjury, ambition, and revenge would\r\nwalk through the land, and render it more like the dwelling of savage\r\nbeasts than the tranquil abode of civilized and Christianized men.\r\n\r\nIf there is an institution which opposes itself to this progress of human\r\ndegeneracy, and throws a shield before the interests of moral virtue in\r\nour thoughtless and wayward world, it is the Sabbath. In the fearful\r\nstruggle between virtue and vice, notwithstanding the powerful auxiliaries\r\nwhich wickedness finds in the bosoms of men, and in the seductions and\r\ninfluence of popular example, wherever the Sabbath has been suffered to\r\nlive, the trembling interests of moral virtue have always been revered and\r\nsustained. One of the principal occupations of this day is to illustrate\r\nand enforce the great principles of sound morality. Where this sacred\r\ntrust is preserved inviolate, you behold a nation convened one day in\r\nseven for the purpose of acquainting themselves with the best moral\r\nprinciples and precepts; and it can not be otherwise than that the\r\nauthority of moral virtue, under such auspices, should be acknowledged and\r\nfelt.\r\n\r\nWe may not, at once, perceive the effects which this weekly observance\r\nproduces. Like most moral causes, it operates slowly; but it operates\r\nsurely, and gradually weakens the power and breaks the yoke of profligacy\r\nand sin. No villain regards the Sabbath. No vicious family regards the\r\nSabbath. No immoral community regards the Sabbath. The holy rest of this\r\never-memorable day is a barrier which is always broken down before men\r\nbecome giants in sin. Blackstone, in his Commentaries on the Laws of\r\nEngland, remarks that "a corruption of morals usually follows a\r\nprofanation of the Sabbath." It is an observation of Lord Chief Justice\r\nHale, that "of all the persons who were convicted of capital crimes, while\r\nhe was on the bench, he found a few only who would not confess that they\r\nbegan their career of wickedness by a neglect of the duties of the Sabbath\r\nand vicious conduct on that day."\r\n\r\nThe prisons in our own land could probably tell us that they have scarcely\r\na solitary tenant who had not broken over the restraints of the Sabbath\r\nbefore he was abandoned to crime. You may enact laws for the suppression\r\nof immorality, but the secret and silent power of the Sabbath constitutes\r\na stronger shield to the vital interest of the community than any code of\r\npenal statutes that ever was enacted. The Sabbath is the keystone of the\r\narch which sustains the temple of virtue, which, however defaced, will\r\nsurvive many a rude shock so long as the foundation remains firm.\r\n\r\nThe observance of the Sabbath is also most influential in securing\r\nnational prosperity. The God of Heaven has said, "Them that honor me I\r\nwill honor," You will not often find a notorious Sabbath breaker a\r\npermanently prosperous man; and a Sabbath-breaking community is never a\r\nhappy or prosperous community. There is a multitude of unobserved\r\ninfluences which the Sabbath exerts upon the temporal welfare of men. It\r\npromotes the spirit of good order and harmony; it elevates the poor from\r\nwant; it transforms squalid wretchedness; it imparts self-respect and\r\nelevation of character; it promotes softness and civility of manners; it\r\nbrings together the rich and the poor upon one common level in the house\r\nof prayer; it purifies and strengthens the social affections, and makes\r\nthe family circle the center of allurement and the source of instruction,\r\ncomfort, and happiness. Like its own divine religion, "it has the promise\r\nof the life that now is and that which is to come," for men can not put\r\nthemselves beyond the reach of hope and heaven so long as they treasure up\r\nthis one command, "Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy."\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--Sir William Blackstone (b. 1723, d. 1780) was the son of a London\r\nsilk mercer.

CHARACTER OF COLUMBUS. (192)\r\n\r\nWashington Irving, 1783-1859. Among those whose works have enriched\r\nAmerican literature, and have given it a place in the estimation of\r\nforeigners, no name stands higher than that of Washington Irving. He was\r\nborn in the city of New York; his father was a native of Scotland, and his\r\nmother was English. He had an ordinary school education, and at the age of\r\nsixteen began the study of law. Two of his older brothers were interested\r\nin literary pursuits; and in his youth he studied the old English authors.\r\nHe was also passionately fond of books of travel. At the age of nineteen,\r\nhe began his literary career by writing for a paper published by his\r\nbrother. In 1804 be made a voyage to the south of Europe. On his return he\r\ncompleted his studies in law, but never practiced his profession.\r\n"Salmagundi," his first book (partly written by others), was published in\r\n1807. This was followed, two years later, by "Knickerbocker\'s History of\r\nNew York." Soon after, he entered into mercantile pursuits in company with\r\ntwo brothers. At the close at the war with England he sailed again for\r\nEurope, and remained abroad seventeen years. During his absence he formed\r\nthe acquaintance of the most eminent literary men of his time, and wrote\r\nseveral of his works; among them were: "The Sketch Book," "Bracebridge\r\nHall," "Tales of a Traveler," "Life and Voyages of Columbus," and the\r\n"Conquest of Granada." On his return he made a journey west of the\r\nMississippi, and gathered materials for several other books. From 1842 to\r\n1846 he was Minister to Spain. On his return to America he established his\r\nresidence at "Sunnyside," near Tarrytown, on the Hudson, where he passed\r\nthe last years of his life. A young lady to whom he was attached having\r\ndied in early life, Mr. Irving never married.\r\n\r\nHis works are marked by humor, just sentiment, and elegance and\r\ncorrectness of expression. They were popular both at home and abroad from\r\nthe first, and their sale brought him a handsome fortune. The "Life of\r\nWashington," his last work, was completed in the same year in which he\r\ndied.\r\n###\r\n\r\n[Transcriber\'s Note: See "The Life of Columbus" by Sir Arthur Helps,]\r\n\r\n\r\nColumbus was a man of great and inventive genius. The operations of his\r\nmind were energetic, but irregular; bursting forth, at times, with that\r\nirresistible force which characterizes intellect of such an order. His\r\nambition was lofty and noble, inspiring him with high thoughts and an\r\nanxiety to distinguish himself by great achievements. He aimed at dignity\r\nand wealth in the same elevated spirit with which he sought renown; they\r\nwere to rise from the territories he should discover, and be commensurate\r\nin importance.\r\n\r\nHis conduct was characterized by the grandeur of his views and the\r\nmagnanimity of his spirit. Instead of ravaging the newly-found countries,\r\nlike many of his cotemporary discoverers, who were intent only on\r\nimmediate gain, he regarded them with the eyes of a legislator; he sought\r\nto colonize and cultivate them, to civilize the natives, to build cities,\r\nintroduce the useful arts, subject everything to the control of law,\r\norder, and religion, and thus to found regular and prosperous empires.\r\nThat he failed in this was the fault of the dissolute rabble which it was\r\nhis misfortune to command, with whom all law was tyranny and all order\r\noppression.\r\n\r\nHe was naturally irascible and impetuous, and keenly sensible to injury\r\nand injustice; yet the quickness of his temper was counteracted by the\r\ngenerosity and benevolence of his heart. The magnanimity of his nature\r\nshone forth through all the troubles of his stormy career. Though\r\ncontinually outraged in his dignity, braved in his authority, foiled in\r\nhis plans, and endangered in his person by the seditions of turbulent and\r\nworthless men, and that, too, at times when suffering under anguish of\r\nbody and anxiety of mind enough to exasperate the most patient, yet he\r\nrestrained his valiant and indignant spirit, and brought himself to\r\nforbear, and reason, and even to supplicate. Nor can the reader of the\r\nstory of his eventful life fail to notice how free he was from all feeling\r\nof revenge, how ready to forgive and forget on the least sign of\r\nrepentance and atonement. He has been exalted for his skill in controlling\r\nothers, but far greater praise is due to him for the firmness he displayed\r\nin governing himself.\r\n\r\nHis piety was genuine and fervent. Religion mingled with the whole course\r\nof his thoughts and actions, and shone forth in his most private and\r\nunstudied writings. Whenever he made any great discovery he devoutly\r\nreturned thanks to God. The voice of prayer and the melody of praise rose\r\nfrom his ships on discovering the new world, and his first action on\r\nlanding was to prostrate himself upon the earth and offer up thanksgiving.\r\nAll his great enterprises were undertaken in the name of the Holy Trinity,\r\nand he partook of the holy sacrament previous to embarkation. He observed\r\nthe festivals of the church in the wildest situations. The Sabbath was to\r\nhim a day of sacred rest, on which he would never sail from a port unless\r\nin case of extreme necessity. The religion thus deeply seated in his soul\r\ndiffused a sober dignity and a benign composure over his whole deportment;\r\nhis very language was pure and guarded, and free from all gross or\r\nirreverent expressions.\r\n\r\nA peculiar trait in his rich and varied character remains to be noticed;\r\nnamely, that ardent and enthusiastic imagination which threw a\r\nmagnificence over his whole course of thought. A poetical temperament is\r\ndiscernible throughout all his writings and in all his actions. We see it\r\nin all his descriptions of the beauties of the wild land he was\r\ndiscovering, in the enthusiasm with which he extolled the blandness of the\r\ntemperature, the purity of the atmosphere, the fragrance of the air, "full\r\nof dew and sweetness," the verdure of the forests, the grandeur of the\r\nmountains, and the crystal purity of the running streams. It spread a\r\nglorious and golden world around him, and tinged everything with its own\r\ngorgeous colors.\r\n\r\nWith all the visionary fervor of his imagination, its fondest dreams fell\r\nshort of the reality. He died in ignorance of the real grandeur of his\r\ndiscovery. Until his last breath, he entertained the idea that he had\r\nmerely opened a new way to the old resorts of opulent commerce, and had\r\ndiscovered some of the wild regions of the East. What visions of glory\r\nwould have broken upon his mind could he have known that he had indeed\r\ndiscovered a new continent equal to the old world in magnitude, and\r\nseparated by two vast oceans from all the earth hitherto known by\r\ncivilized man! How would his magnanimous spirit have been consoled amid\r\nthe afflictions of age and the cares of penury, the neglect of a fickle\r\npublic and the injustice of an ungrateful king, could he have anticipated\r\nthe splendid empires which would arise in the beautiful world he had\r\ndiscovered, and the nations, and tongues, and languages which were to fill\r\nits land with his renown, and to revere and bless his name to the latest\r\nposterity!\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.--Christopher Columbus (b. 1436, d. 1506) was the son of a wool\r\ncomber of Genoa. At the age of fifteen he became a sailor, and in his\r\nvoyages visited England, Iceland, the Guinea coast, and the Greek Isles.\r\nHe was an earnest student of navigation, of cosmography, and of books of\r\ntravel; thus he thoroughly prepared himself for the great undertaking\r\nwhich led to the discovery of America. He struggled against every\r\ndiscouragement for almost ten years before he could persuade a sovereign\r\nto authorize and equip his expedition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVIII. "HE GIVETH HIS BELOVED SLEEP." (195)\r\n\r\nElizabeth Barrett Browning, 1809-1861, was born in London, married\r\nthe poet Robert Browning in 1846, and afterwards resided in Italy most of\r\nthe time till her death, which occurred at Florence. She was thoroughly\r\neducated in severe and masculine studies, and began to write at a very\r\nearly age. Her "Essay on Mind," a metaphysical and reflective poem, was\r\nwritten at the age of sixteen. She wrote very rapidly, and her friend, Miss\r\nMitford, tells us that "Lady Geraldine\'s Courtship," containing ninety-\r\nthree stanzas, was composed in twelve hours! She published several other\r\nlong poems, "Aurora Leigh" being one of the most highly finished. Mrs.\r\nBrowning is regarded as one of the most able female poets of modern\r\ntimes; but her writings are often obscure, and some have doubted whether\r\nshe always clearly conceived what she meant to express. She had a warm\r\nsympathy with all forms of suffering and distress. "He Giveth his Beloved\r\nSleep" is one of the most beautiful of her minor poems. The thought is an\r\namplification of verse 2d of Psalm cxxvii.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the thoughts of God that are\r\nBorne inward unto souls afar,\r\n  Along the Psalmist\'s music deep,\r\nNow tell me if that any is,\r\nFor gift or grace, surpassing this,--\r\n  "He giveth his beloved, sleep!"\r\n\r\nWhat would we give to our beloved?\r\nThe hero\'s heart to be unmoved,\r\n  The poet\'s star-tuned harp, to sweep,\r\nThe patriot\'s voice, to teach and rouse,\r\nThe monarch\'s crown, to light the brows?--\r\n  "He giveth his beloved, sleep."\r\n\r\nWhat do we give to our beloved?\r\nA little faith all undisproved,\r\n  A little dust to overweep,\r\nAnd bitter memories to make\r\nThe whole earth blasted for our sake,--\r\n  "He giveth his beloved, sleep."\r\n\r\n"Sleep soft, beloved!" we sometimes say,\r\nBut have no tune to charm away\r\n  Sad dreams that through the eyelids creep.\r\nBut never doleful dream again\r\nShall break his happy slumber when\r\n  "He giveth his beloved, sleep."\r\n\r\nO earth, so full of dreary noises!\r\nO men, with wailing in your voices!\r\n  O delve\'d gold, the wailers heap!\r\nO strife, O curse, that o\'er it fall!\r\nGod strikes a silence through you all,\r\n  And "giveth his beloved, sleep."\r\n\r\nHis dews drop mutely on the hill;\r\nHis cloud above it saileth still,\r\n  Though on its slope men sow and reap.\r\nMore softly than the dew is shed,\r\nOr cloud is floated overhead,\r\n  "He giveth his beloved, sleep."\r\n\r\nAy, men may wonder while they scan\r\nA living, thinking, feeing man,\r\n  Confirmed in such a rest to keep;\r\nBut angels say--and through the word\r\nI think their happy smile is heard--\r\n  "He giveth his beloved, sleep."\r\n\r\nFor me my heart, that erst did go\r\nMost like a tired child at a show,\r\n  That sees through tears the mummers leap,\r\nWould now its wearied vision close,\r\nWould childlike on his love repose\r\n  Who "giveth his beloved, sleep."\r\n\r\nAnd friends, dear friends,--when it shall be\r\nThat this low breath is gone from me,\r\n  And round my bier ye come to weep,\r\nLet one most loving of you all\r\nSay, "Not a tear must o\'er her fall;\r\n  \'He giveth his beloved, sleep.\' "\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIX. DESCRIPTION OF A SIEGE. (197)\r\n\r\n"The skirts of the wood seem lined with archers, although only a few are\r\nadvanced from its dark shadow." "Under what banner?" asked Ivanhoe. "Under\r\nno ensign which I can observe," answered Rebecca. "A singular novelty,"\r\nmuttered the knight, "to advance to storm such a castle without pennon or\r\nbanner displayed. Seest thou who they be that act as leaders?" "A knight\r\nclad in sable armor is the most conspicuous," said the Jewess: "he alone\r\nis armed from head to heel, and seems to assume the direction of all\r\naround him."\r\n\r\n"Seem there no other leaders?" exclaimed the anxious inquirer. "None of\r\nmark and distinction that I can behold from this station," said Rebecca,\r\n"but doubtless the other side of the castle is also assailed. They seem,\r\neven now, preparing to advance. God of Zion protect us! What a dreadful\r\nsight! Those who advance first bear huge shields and defenses made of\r\nplank: the others follow, bending their bows as they come on. They raise\r\ntheir bows! God of Moses, forgive the creatures thou hast made!"\r\n\r\nHer description was here suddenly interrupted by the signal for assault,\r\nwhich was given by the blast of a shrill bugle, and at once answered by a\r\nflourish of the Norman trumpets from the battlements, which, mingled with\r\nthe deep and hollow clang of the kettledrums, retorted in notes of\r\ndefiance the challenge of the enemy. The shouts of both parties augmented\r\nthe fearful din, the assailants crying, "Saint George, for merry England!"\r\nand the Normans answering them with loud cries of "Onward, De Bracy! Front\r\nde Boeuf, to the rescue!"\r\n\r\n"And I must lie here like a bedridden monk," exclaimed Ivanhoe, "while the\r\ngame that gives me freedom or death is played out by the hand of others!\r\nLook from the window once again, kind maiden, and tell me if they yet\r\nadvance to the storm." With patient courage, strengthened by the interval\r\nwhich she had employed in mental devotion, Rebecca again took post at the\r\nlattice, sheltering herself, however, so as not to be exposed to the\r\narrows of the archers. "What dost thou see, Rebecca?" again demanded the\r\nwounded knight. "Nothing but the cloud of arrows flying so thick as to\r\ndazzle mine eyes, and to hide the bowmen who shoot them." "That can not\r\nendure," said Ivanhoe. "If they press not right on, to carry the castle by\r\nforce of arms, the archery may avail but little against stone walls and\r\nbulwarks. Look for the knight in dark armor, fair Rebecca, and see how he\r\nbears himself; for as the leader is, so will his followers be."\r\n\r\n"I see him not," said Rebecca. "Foul craven!" exclaimed Ivanhoe; "does he\r\nblench from the helm when the wind blows highest?" "He blenches not! he\r\nblenches not!" said Rebecca; "I see him now: he leads a body of men close\r\nunder the outer barrier of the barbacan. They pull down the piles and\r\npalisades; they hew down the barriers with axes. His high black plume\r\nfloats abroad over the throng like a raven over the field of the slain.\r\nThey have made a breach in the barriers, they rush in, they are thrust\r\nback! Front de Boeuf heads the defenders. I see his gigantic form above\r\nthe press. They throng again to the breach, and the pass is disputed, hand\r\nto hand, and man to man. God of Jacob! it is the meeting of two fierce\r\ntides, the conflict of two oceans moved by adverse winds;" and she turned\r\nher head from the window as if unable longer to endure a sight so\r\nterrible.\r\n\r\nSpeedily recovering her self-control, Rebecca again looked forth, and\r\nalmost immediately exclaimed, "Holy prophets of the law! Front de Boeuf\r\nand the Black Knight fight hand to hand on the breach, amid the roar of\r\ntheir followers, who watch the progress of the strife. Heaven strike with\r\nthe cause of the oppressed and of the captive!" She then uttered a loud\r\nshriek, and exclaimed, "He is down! he is down!" "Who is down!" cried\r\nIvanhoe; "for our dear Lady\'s sake, tell me which has fallen!" "The Black\r\nKnight," answered Rebecca, faintly; then instantly again shouted with\r\njoyful eagerness--"But no! but no! the name of the Lord of Hosts be\r\nblessed! he is on foot again, and fights as if there were twenty men\'s\r\nstrength in his single arm--his sword is broken--he snatches an ax from a\r\nyeoman--he presses Front de Boeuf, blow on blow--the giant stoops and\r\ntotters like an oak under the steel of the woodman--he falls-he falls!"\r\n"Front de Boeuf?" exclaimed Ivanhoe. "Front de Boeuf," answered the\r\nJewess; "his men rush to the rescue, headed by the haughty Templar,\r\n--their united force compels the champion to pause--they drag Front de\r\nBoeuf within the walls."\r\n\r\n"The assailants have won the barriers, have they not?" said Ivanhoe. "They\r\nhave--they have--and they press the besieged hard upon the outer wall;\r\nsome plant ladders, some swarm like bees, and endeavor to ascend upon the\r\nshoulders of each other; down go stones, beams, and trunks of trees upon\r\ntheir heads, and as fast as they bear the wounded to the rear, fresh men\r\nsupply their places in the assault. Great God! hast thou given men thine\r\nown image that it should be thus cruelly defaced by the hands of their\r\nbrethren!" "Think not of that," replied Ivanhoe; "this is no time for such\r\nthoughts. Who yield? Who push their way?"\r\n\r\n"The ladders are thrown down," replied Rebecca, shuddering; "the soldiers\r\nlie groveling under them like crushed reptiles; the besieged have the\r\nbetter." "Saint George strike for us!" said the knight; "do the false\r\nyeomen give way?" "No," exclaimed Rebecca, "they bear themselves right\r\nyeomanly; the Black Knight approaches the postern with his huge ax; the\r\nthundering blows which he deals, you may hear them above all the din and\r\nshouts of the battle; stones and beams are hailed down on the brave\r\nchampion; he regards them no more than if they were thistle down and\r\nfeathers."\r\n\r\n"Saint John of Acre!" said Ivanhoe, raising himself joyfully on his couch,\r\n"methought there was but one man in England that might do such a deed."\r\n"The postern gate shakes," continued Rebecca; "it crashes--it is\r\nsplintered by his powerful blows--they rush in--the outwork is won! O God!\r\nthey hurry the defenders from the battlements--they throw them into the\r\nmoat! O men, if ye be indeed men, spare them that can resist no longer!"\r\n"The bridge--the bridge which communicates with the castle--have they won\r\nthat pass?" exclaimed Ivanhoe. "No," replied Rebecca; "the Templar has\r\ndestroyed the plank on which they crossed--few of the defenders escaped\r\nwith him into the castle--the shrieks and cries which you hear, tell the\r\nfate of the others. Alas! I see that it is still more difficult to look\r\nupon victory than upon battle."\r\n\r\n"What do they now, maiden?" said Ivanhoe; "look forth yet again--this is\r\nno time to faint at bloodshed." "It is over, for a time," said Rebecca;\r\n"our friends strengthen themselves within the outwork which they have\r\nmastered." "Our friends," said Ivanhoe, "will surely not abandon an\r\nenterprise so gloriously begun, and so happily attained; Oh no! I will put\r\nmy faith in the good knight whose ax has rent heart of oak and bars of\r\niron. Singular," he again muttered to himself, "if there can be two who\r\nare capable of such achievements. It is,--it must be Richard Coeur de\r\nLion."\r\n\r\n"Seest thou nothing else. Rebecca, by which the Black Knight may be\r\ndistinguished?" "Nothing," said the Jewess, "all about him is as black as\r\nthe wing of the night raven. Nothing can I spy that can mark him further;\r\nbut having once seen him put forth his strength in battle, methinks I\r\ncould know him again among a thousand warriors. He rushes to the fray as\r\nif he were summoned to a banquet. There is more than mere strength; it\r\nseems as if the whole soul and spirit of the champion were given to every\r\nblow which he deals upon his enemies. God forgive him the sin of\r\nbloodshed! it is fearful, yet magnificent, to behold how the arm and heart\r\nof one man can triumph over hundreds."\r\n                                                          -- Walter Scott.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--Ivanhoe, a wounded knight, and Rebecca, a Jewess, had been\r\nimprisoned in the castle of Reginald Front de Boeuf. The friends of the\r\nprisoners undertake their rescue. At the request of Ivanhoe, who is unable\r\nto leave his couch, Rebecca takes her stand near a window overlooking the\r\napproach to the castle, and details to the knight the incidents of the\r\ncontest as they take place. Front de Boeuf and his garrison were Normans;\r\nthe besiegers, Saxons.\r\n\r\nThe castles of this time (twelfth century) usually consisted of a keep, or\r\ncastle proper, surrounded at some distance by two walls, one within the\r\nother. Each wall was encircled on its outer side by a moat, or ditch,\r\nwhich was filled with water, and was crossed by means of a drawbridge.\r\nBefore the main entrance of the outer wall was an outwork called the\r\nbarbacan, which was a high wall surmounted by battlements and turrets,\r\nbuilt to defend the gate and drawbridge. Here, also, were placed barriers\r\nof palisades, etc., to impede the advance of an attacking force. The\r\npostern gate was small, and was usually some distance from the ground; it\r\nwas used for the egress of messengers during a siege;\r\n\r\n\r\nL. MARCO BOZZARIS. (202)\r\n\r\nFitz-Greene Halleck, 1790--1867, was born in Guilford, Connecticut. At the\r\nage of eighteen he entered a banking house in New York, where he remained\r\na long time. For many years he was bookkeeper and assistant in business\r\nfor John Jacob Astor. Nearly all his poems were written before he was\r\nforty years old, several of them in connection with his friend Joseph\r\nRodman Drake. His "Young America," however, was written but a few years\r\nbefore his death. Mr. Halleck\'s poetry is carefully finished and musical;\r\nmuch of it is sportive, and some satirical. No one of his poems is better\r\nknown than "Marco Bozzaris."\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nAt midnight, in his guarded tent,\r\n  The Turk was dreaming of the hour\r\nWhen Greece, her knee in suppliance bent,\r\n  Should tremble at his power.\r\nIn dreams, through camp and court he bore\r\nThe trophies of a conqueror;\r\n  In dreams, his song of triumph heard;\r\nThen wore his monarch\'s signet ring;\r\nThen pressed that monarch\'s throne--a king:\r\nAs wild his thoughts, and gay of wing,\r\n  As Eden\'s garden bird.\r\n\r\nAt midnight, in the forest shades,\r\n  Bozzaris ranged his Suliote band,\r\nTrue as the steel of their tried blades,\r\n  Heroes in heart and hand.\r\nThere had the Persian\'s thousands stood,\r\nThere had the glad earth drunk their blood,\r\n  On old Plataea\'s day:\r\nAnd now there breathed that haunted air,\r\nThe sons of sires who conquered there,\r\nWith arms to strike, and soul to dare,\r\n  As quick, as far as they.\r\n\r\nAn hour passed on--the Turk awoke;\r\n  That bright dream was his last:\r\nHe woke--to hear his sentries shriek,\r\n  "To arms! they come! the Greek! the Greek!"\r\nHe woke--to die mid flame and smoke,\r\nAnd shout, and groan, and saber stroke,\r\n  And death shots falling thick and fast\r\nAs lightnings from the mountain cloud;\r\nAnd heard, with voice as trumpet loud,\r\n  Bozzaris cheer his band:\r\n"Strike--till the last armed foe expires;\r\nStrike--for your altars and your fires;\r\nStrike--for the green graves of your sires;\r\n  God--and your native land!"\r\n\r\nThey fought--like brave men, long and well;\r\n  They piled that ground with Moslem slain;\r\nThey conquered--but Bozzaris fell,\r\n  Bleeding at every vein.\r\nHis few surviving comrades saw\r\nHis smile, when rang their proud hurrah,\r\n  And the red field was won:\r\nThen saw in death his eyelids close\r\nCalmly, as to a night\'s repose,\r\n  Like flowers at set of sun.\r\n\r\nCome to the bridal chamber, Death!\r\n  Come to the mother, when she feels\r\nFor the first time her firstborn\'s breath;\r\n  Come when the blessed seals\r\nThat close the pestilence are broke,\r\nAnd crowded cities wail its stroke;\r\nCome in consumption\'s ghastly form,\r\nThe earthquake\'s shock, the ocean storm;\r\nCome when the heart beats high and warm\r\n  With banquet song, and dance, and wine:\r\nAnd thou art terrible--the tear,\r\nThe groan, the knell, the pall, the bier,\r\nAnd all we know, or dream, or fear\r\n  Of agony, are thine.\r\nBut to the hero, when his sword\r\n  Has won the battle for the free,\r\nThy voice sounds like a prophet\'s word;\r\nAnd in its hollow tones are heard\r\n  The thanks of millions yet to be.\r\n\r\nBozzaris! with the storied brave\r\n  Greece nurtured in her glory\'s time,\r\nRest thee--there is no prouder grave\r\n  Even in her own proud clime.\r\n  We tell thy doom without a sigh,\r\nFor thou art Freedom\'s, now, and Fame\'s.\r\nOne of the few, the immortal names,\r\n  That were not born to die.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--Marco Bozzaris (b. about 1790, d. 1823) was a famous Greek\r\npatriot. His family were Suliotes, a people inhabiting the Suli Mountains,\r\nand bitter enemies of the Turks. Bozzaris was engaged in war against the\r\nlatter nearly all his life, and finally fell in a night attack upon their\r\ncamp near Carpenisi. This poem, a fitting tribute to his memory, has been\r\ntranslated into modern Greek.\r\n\r\nPlataea was the scene of a great victory of the Greeks over the Persians\r\nin the year 479 B. C.\r\n\r\nMoslem--The followers of Mohammed are called Moslems.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLI. SONG OF THE GREEK BARD. (205)\r\n\r\nGeorge Gordon Byron, Lord Byron, 1788-1824. This gifted poet was the son\r\nof a profligate father and of a fickle and passionate mother. He was\r\nafflicted with lameness from his birth; and, although he succeeded to his\r\ngreat-uncle\'s title at ten years of age, he inherited financial\r\nembarrassment with it. These may be some of the reasons for the morbid and\r\nwayward character of the youthful genius. It is certain that he was not\r\nlacking in affection, nor in generosity. In his college days, at\r\nCambridge, he was willful and careless of his studies. "Hours of\r\nIdleness," his first book, appeared in 1807. It was severely treated by\r\nthe "Edinburgh Review," which called forth his "English Bards and Scotch\r\nReviewers," in 1809. Soon after, he went abroad for two years; and, on his\r\nreturn, published the first two cantos of "Childe Harold\'s Pligrimage," a\r\nwork that made him suddenly famous. He married in 1815, but separated from\r\nhis wife after one year. Soured and bitter, he now left England, purposing\r\nnever to return. He spent most of the next seven years in Italy, where\r\nmost of his poems were written. The last year of his life was spent in\r\nGreece, aiding in her struggle for liberty against the Turks. He died at\r\nMissolonghi. As a man, Byron was impetuous, morbid and passionate. He was\r\nundoubtedly dissipated and immoral, but perhaps to a less degree than has\r\nsometimes been asserted. As a poet, he possessed noble powers, and he has\r\nwritten much that will last; in general, however, his poetry is not\r\nwholesome, and his fame is less than it once was.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nThe isles of Greece! the isles of Greece!\r\n  Where burning Sappho loved and sung,\r\nWhere grew the arts of war and peace,--\r\n  Where Delos rose, and Phoebus sprung!\r\nEternal summer gilds them yet,\r\nBut all, except their sun, is set.\r\n\r\nThe Scian and the Teian muse,\r\n  The hero\'s harp, the lover\'s lute,\r\nHave found the fame your shores refuse;\r\n  Their place of birth alone is mute\r\nTo sounds which echo further west\r\nThan your sires\' "Islands of the Blest."\r\n\r\nThe mountains look on Marathon,\r\n  And Marathon looks on the sea;\r\nAnd musing there an hour alone,\r\n  I dreamed that Greece might still be free;\r\nFor, standing on the Persian\'s grave,\r\nI could not deem myself a slave.\r\n\r\nA king sat on the rocky brow\r\n  Which looks o\'er sea-born Salamis;\r\nAnd ships, by thousands, lay below,\r\n  And men in nations,--all were his!\r\nHe counted them at break of day,--\r\nAnd when the sun set, where were they?\r\n\r\nAnd where are they? And where art thou,\r\n  My country? On thy voiceless shore\r\nThe heroic lay is tuneless now,--\r\n  The heroic bosom beats no more!\r\nAnd must thy lyre, so long divine,\r\nDegenerate into hands like mine?\r\n\r\nMust we but weep o\'er days more blest?\r\n  Must we but blush? Our fathers bled.\r\nEarth! render back from out thy breast\r\n  A remnant of our Spartan dead!\r\nOf the three hundred, grant but three,\r\nTo make a new Thermopylae!\r\n\r\nWhat! silent still and silent all?\r\n  Ah! no;--the voices of the dead\r\nSound like a distant torrent\'s fall,\r\n  And answer, "Let one living head,\r\nBut one, arise,--we come, we come!"\r\n\'Tis but the living who are dumb!\r\n\r\nIn vain--in vain!--strike other chords;\r\n  Fill high the cup with Samian wine!\r\nLeave battles to the Turkish hordes,\r\n  And shed the blood of Scio\'s vine!\r\nHark! rising to the ignoble call,\r\nHow answers each bold Bacchanal!\r\n\r\nYou have the Pyrrhic dance as yet;\r\n  Where is the Pyrrhic phalanx gone?\r\nOf two such lessons, why forget\r\n  The nobler and the manlier one?\r\nYou have the letters Cadmus gave;\r\nThink ye he meant them for a slave?\r\n\r\nFill high the howl with Samian wine!\r\n  We will not think of themes like these!\r\nIt made Anacreon\'s song divine:\r\n  He served, but served Polycrates,\r\nA tyrant; but our masters then\r\nWere still, at least, Our countrymen.\r\n\r\nThe tyrant of the Chersonese\r\n Was freedom\'s best and bravest friend;\r\nThat tyrant was Miltiades!\r\nOh that the present hour would lend\r\nAnother despot of the kind!\r\nSuch chains as his were sure to bind.\r\n\r\nFill high the bowl with Samian wine!\r\n  Our virgins dance beneath the shade;\r\nI see their glorious, black eyes shine;\r\n  But gazing on each glowing maid,\r\nMy own the burning tear-drop laves,\r\nTo think such breasts must suckle slaves.\r\n\r\nPlace me on Sunium\'s marbled steep,\r\n  Where nothing save the waves and I\r\nMay hear our mutual murmurs sweep;\r\n  There, swanlike, let me sing and die:\r\nA land of slaves shall ne\'er be mine,--\r\nDash down yon cup of Samian wine!\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--Sappho was a Greek poetess living on the island of Lesbos, about\r\n600 B. C. Delos is one of the Grecian Archipelago, and is of volcanic\r\norigin. The ancient Greeks believed that it rose from the sea at a stroke\r\nfrom Neptune\'s trident, and was moored fast to the bottom by Jupiter. It\r\nwas the supposed birthplace of Phoebus, or Apollo. The island of Chios, or\r\nScios, is one of the places which claim to be the birthplace of Homer.\r\nTeios, or Teos, a city in Ionia, is the birthplace of the Greek poet\r\nAnacreon. The Islands of the Blest, mentioned in ancient poetry, were\r\nimaginary islands in the west, where, it was believed, the favorites of\r\nthe gods were conveyed without dying.\r\n\r\nAt Marathon. (490 B. C.), on the east coast, of Greece, 11,000 Greeks,\r\nunder the generalship of Miltiades, routed 110,000 Persians. The island of\r\nSalamis lies very near the Greek coast: in the narrow channel between, the\r\nGreek fleet almost destroyed (480 B.C.) that of Xerxes, the Persian king,\r\nwho witnessed the contest from a throne on the mountain side. Thermopylae\r\nis a narrow mountain pass in Greece, where Leonidas, with 300 Spartans and\r\nabout 1,100 other Greeks, held the entire Persian army in check until\r\nevery Spartan, except one, was slain. Samos is one of the Grecian\r\nArchipelago, noted for its cultivation of the vine and olive.\r\n\r\nA Bacchanal was a disciple of Bacchus, the god of wine. Pyrrhus was a\r\nGreek, and one of the greatest generals of the world. The phalanx was an\r\nalmost invincible arrangement of troops, massed in close array, with their\r\nshields overlapping one another, and their spears projecting; this form of\r\nmilitary tactics was peculiar to the Greeks.\r\n\r\nPolycrates seized the island of Samos, and made himself tyrant: he was\r\nentrapped and crucified in 522 B. C. Chersonese is the ancient name for a\r\npeninsula. Sunium is the name of a promontory southeast of Athens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLII. NORTH AMERICAN INDIANS. (209)\r\n\r\nCharles Sprague, 1791-1875, was born in Boston, and received his education\r\nin the public schools of that city. For sixteen years he was engaged in\r\nmercantile pursuits, as clerk and partner. In 1820 he became teller in a\r\nbank; and, from 1825, he filled the office of cashier of the Globe Bank\r\nfor about forty years. In 1829 be gave his most famous poem, "Curiosity,"\r\nbefore the Phi Beta Kappa society, in Cambridge. An active man of business\r\nall his days, he has written but little either in prose or poetry, but\r\nthat little is excellent in quality, graceful, and pleasing.\r\n\r\nThe address from which this extract is taken, was delivered before the\r\ncitizens of Boston, July 4th, 1825.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nNot many generations ago, where you now sit, encircled with all that\r\nexalts and embellishes civilized life, the rank thistle nodded in the wind\r\nand the wild fox dug his hole unscared. Here lived and loved another race\r\nof beings. Beneath the same sun that rolls over your head, the Indian\r\nhunter pursued the panting deer; gazing on the same moon that smiles for\r\nyou, the Indian lover wooed his dusky mate. Here the wigwam blaze beamed\r\non the tender and helpless, and the council fire glared on the wise and\r\ndaring. Now they dipped their noble limbs in your sedgy lakes, and now\r\nthey paddled the light canoe along your rocky shores. Here they warred;\r\nthe echoing whoop, the bloody grapple, the defying death song, all were\r\nhere; and when the tiger strife was over, here curled the smoke of peace.\r\n\r\nHere, too, they worshiped; and from many a dark bosom went up a fervent\r\nprayer to the Great Spirit. He had not written his laws for them on tables\r\nof stone, but he had traced them on the tables of their hearts. The poor\r\nchild of nature knew not the God of Revelation, but the God of the\r\nuniverse he acknowledged in everything around. He beheld him in the star\r\nthat sank in beauty behind his lonely dwelling; in the sacred orb that\r\nflamed on him from his midday throne; in the flower that snapped in the\r\nmorning breeze; in the lofty pine that defied a thousand whirlwinds; in\r\nthe timid warbler that never left its native grove; in the fearless eagle,\r\nwhose untired pinion was wet in clouds; in the worm that crawled at his\r\nfeet; and in his own matchless form, glowing with a spark of that light,\r\nto whose mysterious source he bent in humble though blind adoration.\r\n\r\nAnd all this has passed away. Across the ocean came a pilgrim bark,\r\nbearing the seeds of life and death. The former were sown for you; the\r\nlatter sprang up in the path of the simple native. Two hundred years have\r\nchanged the character of a great continent, and blotted forever from its\r\nface a whole, peculiar people. Art has usurped the bowers of nature, and\r\nthe anointed children of education have been too powerful for the tribes\r\nof the ignorant. Here and there a stricken few remain; but how unlike\r\ntheir bold, untamable progenitors. The Indian of falcon glance and lion\r\nbearing, the theme of the touching ballad, the hero of the pathetic tale\r\nis gone, and his degraded offspring crawls upon the soil where he walked\r\nin majesty, to remind us how miserable is man when the foot of the\r\nconqueror is on his neck.\r\n\r\nAs a race they have withered from the land. Their arrows are broken, their\r\nsprings are dried up, their cabins are in the dust. Their council fire has\r\nlong since gone out on the shore, and their war cry is fast fading to the\r\nuntrodden west. Slowly and sadly they climb the distant mountains, and\r\nread their doom in the setting sun. They are shrinking before the mighty\r\ntide which is pressing them away; they must soon hear the roar of the last\r\nwave which will settle over them forever. Ages hence, the inquisitive\r\nwhite man, as he stands by some growing city, will ponder on the structure\r\nof their disturbed remains, and wonder to what manner of persons they\r\nbelonged. They will live only in the songs and chronicles of their\r\nexterminators. Let these be faithful to their rude virtues as men, and pay\r\ndue tribute to their unhappy fate as a people.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIII. LOCHIEL\'S WARNING. (211)\r\n\r\nThomas Campbell, 1777-1844, was a descendant of the famous clan of\r\nCampbells, in Kirnan, Scotland, and was born at Glasgow. At the age of\r\nthirteen he entered the university in that city, from which he graduated\r\nwith distinction, especially as a Greek scholar; his translations of Greek\r\ntragedy were considered without parallel in the history of the university.\r\nDuring the first year after graduation, he wrote several poems of minor\r\nimportance. He then removed to Edinburgh and adopted literature as his\r\nprofession; here his "Pleasures of Hope" was published in 1799, and\r\nachieved immediate success. He traveled extensively on the continent, and\r\nduring his absence wrote "Lochiel\'s Warning," "Hohenlinden," and other\r\nminor poems. In 1809 he published "Gertrude of Wyoming;" from 1820 to 1830\r\nhe edited the "New Monthly Magazine." In 1826 he was chosen lord rector of\r\nthe University of Glasgow, to which office he was twice reelected. He was\r\nactive in founding the University of London. During the last years of his\r\nlife he produced but little of note. He died at Boulogne, in France.\r\nDuring most of his life he was in straitened pecuniary circumstances, and\r\nill-health and family afflictions cast a melancholy over his later years.\r\nHis poems were written with much care, and are uniformly smooth and\r\nmusical.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nSeer. Lochiel! Lochiel! beware of the day\r\n      When the Lowlands shall meet thee in battle array!\r\n      For a field of the dead rushes red on my sight,\r\n      And the clans of Culloden are scattered in fight.\r\n      They rally, they bleed, for their kingdom and crown;\r\n      Woe, woe to the riders that trample them down!\r\n      Proud Cumberland prances, insulting the slain,\r\n      And their hoof-beaten bosoms are trod to the plain.\r\n      But hark! through the fast-flashing lightning of war,\r\n      What steed to the desert flies frantic and far?\r\n      \'T is thine, O Glenullin! whose bride shall await\r\n      Like a love-lighted watch fire all night at the gate.\r\n      A steed comes at morning,--no rider is there,\r\n      But its bridle is red with the sign of despair.\r\n      Weep, Albin! to death and captivity led!\r\n      Oh, weep! but thy tears can not number the dead:\r\n      For a merciless sword on Culloden shall wave,--\r\n      Culloden! that reeks with the blood of the brave.\r\n\r\nLoch. Go preach to the coward, thou death-telling seer!\r\n      Or, if gory Culloden so dreadful appear,\r\n      Draw, dotard, around thy old wavering sight,\r\n      This mantle, to cover the phantoms of fright.\r\n\r\nSeer. Ha! laugh\'st thou, Lochiel, my vision to scorn?\r\n      Proud bird of the mountain thy plume shall be torn!\r\n      Say, rushed the bold eagle exultingly forth\r\n      From his home in the dark-rolling clouds of the north?\r\n      Lo! the death shot of foemen outspeeding, he rode\r\n      Companionless, bearing destruction abroad;\r\n      But down let him stoop from his havoc on high!\r\n      Ah! home let him speed, for the spoiler is nigh.\r\n      Why flames the far summit? Why shoot to the blast\r\n      Those embers, like stars from the firmament cast?\r\n      \'T is the fire shower of ruin, all dreadfully driven\r\n      From his eyrie that beacons the darkness of heaven,\r\n      O crested Lochiel! the peerless in might,\r\n      Whose banners arise on the battlements\' height,\r\n      Heaven\'s fire is around thee, to blast and to burn;\r\n      Return to thy dwelling! all lonely return!\r\n      For the blackness of ashes shall mark where it stood,\r\n      And a wild mother scream o\'er her famishing brood.\r\n\r\nLoch. False wizard, avaunt! I have marshaled my clan,\r\n      Their swords are a thousand, their bosoms are one!\r\n      They are true to the last of their blood and their breath,\r\n      And like reapers descend to the harvest of death.\r\n      Then welcome be Cumberland\'s steed to the shock!\r\n      Let him dash his proud foam like a wave on the rock!\r\n      But woe to his kindred, and woe to his cause,\r\n      When Albin her claymore indignantly draws;\r\n      When her bonneted chieftains to victory crowd,\r\n      Clanronald the dauntless, and Moray the proud,\r\n      All plaided and plumed in their tartan array--\r\n\r\nSeer. --Lochiel, Lochiel, beware of the day!\r\n      For, dark and despairing, my sight I may seal,\r\n      But man can not cover what God would reveal:\r\n      \'T is the sunset of life gives me mystical lore,\r\n      And coming events cast their shadows before.\r\n      I tell thee, Culloden\'s dread echoes shall ring\r\n      With the bloodhounds that bark for thy fugitive king.\r\n      Lo! anointed by heaven with the vials of wrath,\r\n      Behold where he flies on his desolate path!\r\n      Now, in darkness and billows, he sweeps from my sight:\r\n      Rise, rise! ye wild tempests, and cover his flight!\r\n      \'Tis finished. Their thunders are hushed on the moors;\r\n      Culloden is lost, and my country deplores.\r\n      But where is the ironbound prisoner? Where?\r\n      For the red eye of battle is shut in despair.\r\n      Say, mounts he the ocean wave, banished, forlorn,\r\n      Like a limb from his country, cast bleeding and torn?\r\n      Ah no! for a darker departure is near;\r\n      The war drum is muffled, and black is the bier;\r\n      His death bell is tolling; O mercy, dispel\r\n      Yon sight that it freezes my spirit to tell!\r\n      Life flutters convulsed in his quivering limbs,\r\n      And his blood-streaming nostril in agony swims.\r\n      Accursed be the fagots that blaze at his feet,\r\n      Where his heart shall be thrown ere it ceases to beat,\r\n      With the smoke of its ashes to poison the gale--\r\n\r\nLoch. Down, soothless insulter! I trust not the tale:\r\n      For never shall Albin a destiny meet\r\n      So black with dishonor, so foul with retreat.\r\n      Though my perishing ranks should be strewed in their gore,\r\n      Like ocean weeds heaped on the surf-beaten shore,\r\n      Lochiel, untainted by flight or by chains,\r\n      While the kindling of life in his bosom remains,\r\n      Shall victor exult, or in death be laid low,\r\n      With his back to the field and his feet to the foe!\r\n      And leaving in battle no blot on his name,\r\n      Look proudly to heaven from the deathbed of fame.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--Lochiel was a brave and influential Highland chieftain. He\r\nespoused the cause of Charles Stuart, called the Pretender, who claimed\r\nthe British throne. In the preceding piece, he is supposed to be marching\r\nwith the warriors of his clan to join Charles\'s army. On his way he is met\r\nby a Seer, who having, according to the popular superstition, the gift of\r\nsecond-sight, or prophecy, forewarns him of the disastrous event of the\r\nenterprise, and exhorts him to return home and avoid the destruction which\r\ncertainly awaits him, and which afterward fell upon him at the battle of\r\nCulloden, in 1746. In this battle the Highlanders were commanded by\r\nCharles in person, and the English by the Duke of Cumberland. The\r\nHighlanders wore completely routed, and the Pretender\'s rebellion brought\r\nto a close. He himself shortly afterward made a narrow escape by water\r\nfrom the west of Scotland; hence the reference to the fugitive king.\r\n\r\nAlbin is the poetic name of Scotland, more particularly the Highlands. The\r\nironbound prisoner refers to Lochiel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIV. ON HAPPINESS OF TEMPER. (215)\r\n\r\nOliver Goldsmith, 1728-1774. This eccentric son of genius was an Irishman;\r\nhis father was a poor curate. Goldsmith received his education at several\r\npreparatory schools, at Trinity College, Dublin, at Edinburgh, and at\r\nLeyden. He was indolent and unruly as a student, often in disgrace with\r\nhis teachers; but his generosity, recklessness, and love of athletic\r\nsports made him a favorite with his fellow-students. He spent some time in\r\nwandering over the continent, often in poverty and want. In 1756 he\r\nreturned to England, and soon took up his abode in London. Here he made\r\nthe acquaintance and friendship of several notable men, among whom were\r\nJohnson and Sir Joshua Reynolds. "The Traveler" was published in 1764, and\r\nwas soon followed by the "Vicar of Wakefield." He wrote in nearly all\r\ndepartments of literature, and always with purity, grace, and fluency. His\r\nfame as a poet is secured by the "Traveler" and the "Deserted Village;" as\r\na dramatist, by "She Stoops to Conquer;" as a satirist, by the "Citizen of\r\nthe World;" and as a novelist by the "Vicar of Wakefield." In his later\r\nyears his writings were the source of a large income, but his gambling,\r\ncareless generosity, and reckless extravagance always kept him in\r\nfinancial difficulty, and he died heavily in debt. His monument is in\r\nWestminster Abbey.\r\n##\r\n\r\n\r\nWriters of every age have endeavored to show that pleasure is in us, and\r\nnot in the objects offered for our amusement. If the soul be happily\r\ndisposed, everything becomes capable of affording entertainment, and\r\ndistress will almost want a name. Every occurrence passes in review, like\r\nthe figures of a procession; some may be awkward, others ill-dressed, but\r\nnone but a fool is on that account enraged with the master of ceremonies.\r\n\r\nI remember to have once seen a slave, in a fortification in Flanders, who\r\nappeared no way touched with his situation. He was maimed, deformed, and\r\nchained; obliged to toil from the appearance of day till nightfall, and\r\ncondemned to this for life; yet, with all these circumstances of apparent\r\nwretchedness, he sang, would have danced, but that he wanted a leg, and\r\nappeared the merriest, happiest man of all the garrison. What a practical\r\nphilosopher was here! A happy constitution supplied philosophy, and though\r\nseemingly destitute of wisdom he was really wise. No reading or study had\r\ncontributed to disenchant the fairyland around him. Everything furnished\r\nhim with an opportunity of mirth; and though some thought him, from his\r\ninsensibility, a fool, he was such an idiot as philosophers should wish to\r\nimitate.\r\n\r\nThey who, like that slave, can place themselves all that side of the world\r\nin which everything appears in a pleasant light, will find something in\r\nevery occurrence to excite their good humor. The most calamitous events,\r\neither to themselves or others, can bring no new affliction; the world is\r\nto them a theater, in which only comedies are acted. All the bustle of\r\nheroism, or the aspirations of ambition, seem only to heighten the\r\nabsurdity of the scene, and make the humor more poignant. They feel, in\r\nshort, as little anguish at their own distress, or the complaints of\r\nothers, as the undertaker, though dressed in black, feels sorrow at a\r\nfuneral. Of all the men I ever read of, the famous Cardinal de Retz\r\npossessed this happiness in the highest degree. When fortune wore her\r\nangriest look, and he fell into the power of Cardinal Mazarin, his most\r\ndeadly enemy, (being confined a close prisoner in the castle of\r\nValenciennes,) he never attempted to support his distress by wisdom or\r\nphilosophy, for he pretended to neither. He only laughed at himself\' and\r\nhis persecutor, and seemed infinitely pleased at his new situation. In\r\nthis mansion of distress, though denied all amusements, and even the\r\nconveniences of life, and entirely cut off from all intercourse with his\r\nfriends, he still retained his good humor, laughed at the little spite of\r\nhis enemies, and carried the jest so far as to write the life of his\r\njailer.\r\n\r\nAll that the wisdom of the proud can teach, is to be stubborn or sullen\r\nunder misfortunes. The Cardinal\'s example will teach us to be good-\r\nhumored in circumstances of the highest affliction. It matters not whether\r\nour good humor be construed by others into insensibility or idiotism,--it\r\nis happiness to ourselves; and none but a fool could measure his\r\nsatisfaction by what the world thinks of it.\r\n\r\nThe happiest fellow I ever knew, was of the number of those good-natured\r\ncreatures that are said to do no harm to anybody but themselves. Whenever\r\nhe fell into any misery, he called it "seeing life," If his head was\r\nbroken by a chairman, or his pocket picked by a sharper, he comforted\r\nhimself by imitating the Hibernian dialect of the one, or the more\r\nfashionable cant of the other. Nothing came amiss to him. His inattention\r\nto money matters had concerned his father to such a degree that all\r\nintercession of friends was fruitless. The old gentleman was on his\r\ndeathbed. The whole family (and Dick among the number) gathered around\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"I leave my second son, Andrew," said the expiring miser, "my whole\r\nestate, and desire him to be frugal." Andrew, in a sorrowful tone (as is\r\nusual on such occasions), prayed heaven to prolong his life and health to\r\nenjoy it himself. "I recommend Simon, my third son, to the care of his\r\nelder brother, and leave him, besides, four thousand pounds." "Ah,\r\nfather!" cried Simon (in great affliction, to be sure), "may heaven give\r\nyou life and health to enjoy it yourself!" At last, turning to poor Dick:\r\n"As for you, you have always been a sad dog; you\'ll never come to good;\r\nyou\'ll never be rich; I leave you a shilling to buy a halter." "Ah,\r\nfather!" cries Dick, without any emotion, "may heaven give you life and\r\nhealth to enjoy it yourself!"\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--Cardinal de Retz, Jean Francois Paul de Gondi (b. 1614, d. 1679),\r\nwas leader of the revolt against Jules Mazarin (b. 1602, d. 1661), the\r\nprime minister of France during the minority of Louis XIV. This led to a\r\nwar which lasted four or five years. After peace had been concluded, and\r\nLouis XIV. established on the throne, Mazarin was reinstated in power, and\r\nCardinal de Retz was imprisoned.\r\n\r\nFlanders, formerly part of the Netherlands, is now included in Belgium,\r\nHolland and France.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLV. THE FORTUNE TELLER. (218)\r\n\r\nHenry Mackenzie, 1745-1831, was born in Edinburgh, educated at the\r\nuniversity there, and died in the same city. He was an attorney by\r\nprofession, and was the associate of many famous literary men residing at\r\nthat time in Edinburgh. His fame as a writer rests chiefly on two novels,\r\n"The Man of Feeling" and "The Man of the World;" both were published\r\nbefore the author was forty years old.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nHarley sat down on a large stone by the wayside, to take a pebble from his\r\nshoe, when he saw, at some distance, a beggar approaching him. He had on a\r\nloose sort of coat, mended with different-colored rags, among which the\r\nblue and russet were predominant. He had a short, knotty stick in his\r\nhand, and on the top of it was stuck a ram\'s horn; he wore no shoes, and\r\nhis stockings had entirely lost that part of them which would have covered\r\nhis feet and ankles; in his face, however, was the plump appearance of\r\ngood humor; he walked a good, round pace, and a crook-legged dog trotted\r\nat his heels.\r\n\r\n"Our delicacies," said Harley to himself, "are fantastic; they are not in\r\nnature! That beggar walks over the sharpest of these stones barefooted,\r\nwhilst I have lost the most delightful dream in the world from the\r\nsmallest of them happening to get into my shoe." The beggar had by this\r\ntime come up, and, pulling off a piece of a hat, asked charity of Harley.\r\nThe dog began to beg, too. It was impossible to resist both; and, in\r\ntruth, the want of shoes and stockings had made both unnecessary, for\r\nHarley had destined sixpence for him before.\r\n\r\nThe beggar, on receiving it, poured forth blessings without number; and,\r\nwith a sort of smile on his countenance, said to Harley that if he wanted\r\nto have his fortune told--Harley turned his eye briskly upon the beggar;\r\nit was an unpromising look for the subject of a prediction, and silenced\r\nthe prophet immediately. "I would much rather learn" said Harley, "what it\r\nis in your power to tell me. Your trade must be an entertaining one; sit\r\ndown on this stone, and let me know something of your profession; I have\r\noften thought of turning fortune teller for a week or two, myself."\r\n\r\n"Master," replied the beggar, "I like your frankness much, for I had the\r\nhumor of plain dealing in me from a child; but there is no doing with it\r\nin this world,--we must do as we can; and lying is, as you call it, my\r\nprofession. But I was in some sort forced to the trade, for I once dealt\r\nin telling the truth. I was a laborer, sir, and gained as much as to make\r\nme live. I never laid by, indeed, for I was reckoned a piece of a wag, and\r\nyour wags, I take it, are seldom rich, Mr. Harley." "So," said Harley,\r\n"you seem to know me." "Ay, there are few folks in the country that I do\r\nn\'t know something of. How should I tell fortunes else?" "True,--but go on\r\nwith your story; you were a laborer, you say, and a wag; your industry, I\r\nsuppose, you left with your old trade; but your humor you preserved to be\r\nof use to you in your new."\r\n\r\n"What signifies sadness, sir? A man grows lean on \'t. But I was brought to\r\nmy idleness by degrees; sickness first disabled me, and it went against my\r\nstomach to work, ever after. But, in truth, I was for a long time so weak\r\nthat I spit blood whenever I attempted to work. I had no relation living,\r\nand I never kept a friend above a week when I was able to joke. Thus I was\r\nforced to beg my bread, and a sorry trade I have found it, Mr. Harley. I\r\ntold all my misfortunes truly, but they were seldom believed; and the few\r\nwho gave me a half-penny as they passed, did it with a shake of the head,\r\nand an injunction not to trouble them with a long story. In short, I found\r\nthat people do n\'t care to give alms without some security for their\r\nmoney,--such as a wooden leg, or a withered arm, for example. So I changed\r\nmy plan, and instead of telling my own misfortunes, began to prophesy\r\nhappiness to others.\r\n\r\n"This I found by much the better way. Folks will always listen when the\r\ntale is their own, and of many who say they do not believe in fortune\r\ntelling, I have known few on whom it had not a very sensible effect. I\r\npick up the names of their acquaintance; amours and little squabbles are\r\neasily gleaned from among servants and neighbors; and, indeed, people\r\nthemselves are the best intelligencers in the world for our purpose. They\r\ndare not puzzle us for their own sakes, for everyone is anxious to hear\r\nwhat he wishes to believe; and they who repeat it, to laugh at it when\r\nthey have done, are generally more serious than their hearers are apt to\r\nimagine. With a tolerably good memory, and some share of cunning, I\r\nsucceed reasonably well as a fortune teller. With this, and showing the\r\ntricks of that dog, I make shift to pick up a livelihood.\r\n\r\n"My trade is none of the most honest, yet people are not much cheated\r\nafter all, who give a few half-pence for a prospect of happiness, which I\r\nhave heard some persons say, is all a man can arrive at in this world. But\r\nI must bid you good day, sir; for I have three miles to walk before noon,\r\nto inform some boarding-school young ladies whether their husbands are to\r\nbe peers of the realm or captains in the army; a question which I promised\r\nto answer them by that time."\r\n\r\nHarley had drawn a shilling from his pocket; but Virtue bade him to\r\nconsider on whom he was going to bestow it. Virtue held back his arm; but\r\na milder form, a younger sister of Virtue\'s, not so severe as Virtue, nor\r\nso serious as Pity, smiled upon him; his fingers lost their compression;\r\nnor did Virtue appear to catch the money as it fell. It had no sooner\r\nreached the ground than the watchful cur (a trick he had been taught)\r\nsnapped it up; and, contrary to the most approved method of stewardship,\r\ndelivered it immediately into the hands of his master.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLVI. RIENZI\'S ADDRESS TO THE ROMANS. (221)\r\n\r\nMary Russell Mitford, 1786-1855. She was the daughter of a physician, and\r\nwas born in Hampshire, England. At twenty years of age, she published\r\nthree volumes of poems; and soon after entered upon literature as a\r\nlifelong occupation. She wrote tales, sketches, poems, and dramas. "Our\r\nVillage" is the best known of her prose works; the book describes the\r\ndaily life of a rural people, is simple but finished in style, and is\r\nmarked by mingled humor and pathos. Her most noted drama is "Rienzi." Miss\r\nMitford passed the last forty years of her life in a little cottage in\r\nBerkshire, among a simple, country people, to whom she was greatly\r\nendeared by her kindness and social virtues.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nI come not here to talk. You know too well\r\nThe story of our thraldom. We are slaves!\r\nThe bright sun rises to his course, and lights\r\nA race of slaves! He sets, and his last beams\r\nFall on a slave; not such as, swept along\r\nBy the full tide of power, the conqueror led\r\nTo crimson glory and undying fame;\r\nBut base, ignoble slaves; slaves to a horde\r\nOf petty tyrants, feudal despots, lords,\r\nRich in some dozen paltry villages;\r\nStrong in some hundred spearmen; only great\r\nIn that strange spell,--a name.\r\n\r\n              Each hour, dark fraud,\r\nOr open rapine, or protected murder,\r\nCries out against them. But this very day,\r\nAn honest man, my neighbor,--there he stands,--\r\nWas struck--struck like a dog, by one who wore\r\nThe badge of Ursini; because, forsooth,\r\nHe tossed not high his ready cap in air,\r\nNor lifted up his voice in servile shouts,\r\nAt sight of that great ruffian! Be we men,\r\nAnd suffer such dishonor? men, and wash not\r\nThe stain away in blood? Such shames are common.\r\nI have known deeper wrongs; I that speak to ye,\r\nI had a brother once--a gracious boy,\r\nFull of all gentleness, of calmest hope,\r\nOf sweet and quiet joy,--there was the look\r\nOf heaven upon his face, which limners give\r\nTo the beloved disciple.\r\n\r\n                                How I loved\r\nThat gracious boy! Younger by fifteen years,\r\nBrother at once, and son! He left my side,\r\nA summer bloom on his fair cheek; a smile\r\nParting his innocent lips. In one short hour,\r\nThat pretty, harmless boy was slain! I saw\r\nThe corse, the mangled corse, and then I cried\r\nFor vengeance! Rouse, ye Romans! rouse, ye slaves!\r\nHave ye brave sons? Look in the next fierce brawl\r\nTo see them die. Have ye fair daughters? Look\r\nTo see them live, torn from your arms, distained,\r\nDishonored; and if ye dare call for justice,\r\nBe answered by the lash.\r\n\r\n                               Yet this is Rome,\r\nThat sat on her seven hills, and from her throne\r\nOf beauty ruled the world! and we are Romans.\r\nWhy, in that elder day, to be a Roman\r\nWas greater than a king!\r\n\r\n                         And once again,--\r\nHear me, ye walls that echoed to the tread\r\nOf either Brutus! Once again, I swear,\r\nThe eternal city shall be free.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--Rienzi (b. about 1312, d. 1354) was the last of the Roman\r\ntribunes. In 1347 he led a successful revolt against the nobles, who by\r\ntheir contentions kept Rome in constant turmoil. He then assumed the title\r\nof tribune, but, after indulging in a life of reckless extravagance and\r\npomp for a few months, he was compelled to abdicate, and fly for his life.\r\nIn 1354 he was reinstated in power, but his tyranny caused his\r\nassassination the same year.\r\n\r\nThe Ursini wore one of the noble families of Rome.\r\n\r\nThis lesson is especially adapted for drill on inflection, emphasis, and\r\nmodulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLVll. CHARACTER OF THE PURITAN FATHERS OF NEW ENGLAND. (223)\r\n\r\nOne of the most prominent features which distinguished our forefathers,\r\nwas their determined resistance to oppression. They seemed born and\r\nbrought up for the high and special purpose of showing to the world that\r\nthe civil and religious rights of man--the rights of self-government, of\r\nconscience, and independent thought--are not merely things to be talked of\r\nand woven into theories, but to be adopted with the whole strength and\r\nardor of the mind, and felt in the profoundest recesses of the heart, and\r\ncarried out into the general life, and made the foundation of practical\r\nusefulness, and visible beauty, and true nobility.\r\n\r\nLiberty, with them, was an object of too serious desire and stern resolve\r\nto be personified, allegorized, and enshrined. They made no goddess of it,\r\nas the ancients did; they had no time nor inclination for such trifling;\r\nthey felt that liberty was the simple birthright of every human creature;\r\nthey called it so; they claimed it as such; they reverenced and held it\r\nfast as the unalienable gift of the Creator, which was not to be\r\nsurrendered to power, nor sold for wages.\r\n\r\nIt was theirs, as men; without it, they did not esteem themselves men;\r\nmore than any other privilege or possession, it was essential to their\r\nhappiness, for it was essential to their original nature; and therefore\r\nthey preferred it above wealth, and ease, and country; and, that they\r\nmight enjoy and exercise it fully, they forsook houses, and lands, and\r\nkindred, their homes, their native soil, and their fathers\' graves.\r\n\r\nThey left all these; they left England, which, whatever it might have been\r\ncalled, was not to them a land of freedom; they launched forth on the\r\npathless ocean, the wide, fathomless ocean, soiled not by the earth\r\nbeneath, and bounded, all round and above, only by heaven; and it seemed\r\nto them like that better and sublimer freedom, which their country knew\r\nnot, but of which they had the conception and image in their hearts; and,\r\nafter a toilsome and painful voyage, they came to a hard and wintry coast,\r\nunfruitful and desolate, but unguarded and boundless; its calm silence\r\ninterrupted not the ascent of their prayers; it had no eyes to watch, no\r\nears to hearken, no tongues to report of them; here, again, there was an\r\nanswer to their soul\'s desire, and they were satisfied, and gave thanks;\r\nthey saw that they were free, and the desert smiled.\r\n\r\nI am telling an old tale; but it is one which must be told when we speak\r\nof those men. It is to be added, that they transmitted their principles to\r\ntheir children, and that, peopled by such a race, our country was always\r\nfree. So long as its inhabitants were unmolested by the mother country in\r\nthe exercise of their important rights, they submitted to the form of\r\nEnglish government; but when those rights were invaded, they spurned even\r\nthe form away.\r\n\r\nThis act was the Revolution, which came of course and spontaneously, and\r\nhad nothing in it of the wonderful or unforeseen. The wonder would have\r\nbeen if it had not occurred. It was, indeed, a happy and glorious event,\r\nbut by no means unnatural; and I intend no slight to the revered actors in\r\nthe Revolution when I assert that their fathers before them were as free\r\nas they--every whit as free.\r\n\r\nThe principles of the Revolution were not the suddenly acquired property\r\nof a few bosoms: they were abroad in the land in the ages before; they had\r\nalways been taught, like the truths of the Bible; they had descended from\r\nfather to son, down from those primitive days, when the Pilgrim,\r\nestablished in his simple dwelling, and seated at his blazing fire, piled\r\nhigh from the forest which shaded his door, repeated to his listening\r\nchildren the story of his wrongs and his resistance, and bade them\r\nrejoice, though the wild winds and the wild beasts were howling without,\r\nthat they had nothing to fear from great men\'s oppression.\r\n\r\nHere are the beginnings of the Revolution. Every settler\'s hearth was a\r\nschool of independence; the scholars were apt, and the lessons sunk\r\ndeeply; and thus it came that our country was always free; it could not be\r\nother than free.\r\n\r\nAs deeply seated as was the principle of liberty and resistance to\r\narbitrary power in the breasts of the Puritans, it was not more so than\r\ntheir piety and sense of religious obligation. They were emphatically a\r\npeople whose God was the Lord. Their form of government was as strictly\r\ntheocratical, if direct communication be excepted, as was that of the\r\nJews; insomuch that it would be difficult to say where there was any civil\r\nauthority among them entirely distinct from ecclesiastical jurisdiction.\r\n\r\nWhenever a few of them settled a town, they immediately gathered\r\nthemselves into a church; and their elders were magistrates, and their\r\ncode of laws was the Pentateuch. These were forms, it is true, but forms\r\nwhich faithfully indicated principles and feelings; for no people could\r\nhave adopted such forms, who were not thoroughly imbued with the spirit,\r\nand bent on the practice, of religion.\r\n\r\nGod was their King; and they regarded him as truly and literally so, as if\r\nhe had dwelt in a visible palace in the midst of their state. They were\r\nhis devoted, resolute, humble subjects; they undertook nothing which they\r\ndid not beg of him to prosper; they accomplished nothing without rendering\r\nto him the praise; they suffered nothing without carrying their sorrows to\r\nhis throne; they ate nothing which they did not implore him to bless.\r\n\r\nTheir piety was not merely external; it was sincere; it had the proof of a\r\ngood tree in bearing good fruit; it produced and sustained a strict\r\nmorality. Their tenacious purity of manners and speech obtained for them,\r\nin the mother country, their name of Puritans, which, though given in\r\nderision, was as honorable an appellation as was ever bestowed by man on\r\nman.\r\n\r\nThat there were hypocrites among them, is not to be doubted; but they were\r\nrare. The men who voluntarily exiled themselves to an unknown coast, and\r\nendured there every toil and hardship for conscience\' sake, and that they\r\nmight serve God in their own manner, were not likely to set conscience at\r\ndefiance, and make the service of God a mockery; they were not likely to\r\nbe, neither were they, hypocrites. I do not know that it would be\r\narrogating too much for them to say, that, on the extended surface of the\r\nglobe, there was not a single community of men to be compared with them,\r\nin the respects of deep religious impressions and an exact performance of\r\nmoral duty.\r\n                                                      F. W. P. Greenwood.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--The Pentateuch is the first five books of the Old Testament. The\r\nword is derived from two Greek words, (pente), five, and (tenchos), book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLVIII. LANDING OF THE PILGRIM FATHERS. (226)\r\n\r\nFelicia Dorothea Hemans, 1794-1835, was born in Liverpool. Her father,\r\nwhose name was Browne, was an Irish merchant. She spent her childhood in\r\nWales, began to write poetry at a very early age, and was married when\r\nabout eighteen to Captain Hemans. By this marriage, she became the mother\r\nof five sons; but, owing to differences of taste and disposition, her\r\nhusband left her at the end of six years; and by mutual agreement they\r\nnever again lived together. Mrs. Hemans now made literature a profession,\r\nand wrote much and well. In 1826 Prof. Andrews Norton brought out an\r\nedition of her poems in America, where they became popular, and have\r\nremained so.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hemans\'s poetry is smooth and graceful, frequently tinged with a\r\nshade of melancholy, but never despairing, cynical, or misanthropic. It\r\nnever deals with the highest themes, nor rises to sublimity, but its\r\ninfluence is calculated to make the reader truer, nobler, and purer.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nThe breaking waves dashed high\r\n  On a stern and rock-bound coast,\r\nAnd the woods against a stormy sky\r\n  Their giant branches tossed;\r\n\r\nAnd the heavy night hung dark,\r\n  The hills and waters o\'er,\r\nWhen a band of exiles moored their bark\r\n  On the wild New England shore.\r\n\r\nNot as the conqueror comes,\r\n  They, the true-hearted, came;\r\nNot with the roll of the stirring drums.\r\n  And the trumpet that sings of fame.\r\n\r\nNot as the flying come,\r\n  In silence, and in fear;--\r\nThey shook the depths of the desert gloom\r\n  With their hymns of lofty cheer.\r\n\r\nAmidst the storm they sang,\r\n  And the stars heard, and the sea;\r\nAnd the sounding aisles of the dim woods rang\r\n  To the anthem of the free!\r\n\r\nThe ocean eagle soared\r\n  From his nest by the white wave\'s foam;\r\nAnd the rocking pines of the forest roared,--\r\n  This was their welcome home.\r\n\r\nThere were men with hoary hair\r\n  Amidst that pilgrim band:\r\nWhy had they come to wither there,\r\n  Away from their childhood\'s land?\r\n\r\nThere was woman\'s fearless eye,\r\n  Lit by her deep love\'s truth;\r\nThere was manhood\'s brow, serenely high,\r\n  And the fiery heart of youth.\r\n\r\nWhat sought they thus afar?\r\n  Bright jewels of the mine?\r\nThe wealth of seas, the spoils of war?\r\n  They sought a faith\'s pure shrine!\r\n\r\nAy, call it holy ground,\r\n  The soil where first they trod:\r\nThey have left unstained what there they found,--\r\n  Freedom to worship God.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.--The Pilgrim Fathers landed at Plymouth, Mass, Dec. 11th (Old\r\nStyle), 1620. The rock on which they first stepped, is in Water Street of\r\nthe village, and is covered by a handsome granite canopy, surmounted by a\r\ncolossal statue of Faith.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIX. NECESSITY OF EDUCATION. (228)\r\n\r\nWe must educate! We must educate! or we must perish by our own prosperity.\r\nIf we do not, short will be our race from the cradle to the grave. If, in\r\nour haste to be rich and mighty, we outrun our literary and religious\r\ninstitutions, they will never overtake us; or only come up after the\r\nbattle of liberty is fought and lost, as spoils to grace the victory, and\r\nas resources of inexorable despotism for the perpetuity of our bondage.\r\n\r\nBut what will become of the West if her prosperity rushes up to such a\r\nmajesty of power, while those great institutions linger which are\r\nnecessary to form the mind, and the conscience, and the heart of the vast\r\nworld? It must not be permitted. And yet what is done must be done\r\nquickly; for population will not wait, and commerce will not cast anchor,\r\nand manufactures will not shut off the steam, nor shut down the gate, and\r\nagriculture, pushed by millions of freemen on their fertile soil, will not\r\nwithhold her corrupting abundance.\r\n\r\nAnd let no man at the East quiet himself, and dream of liberty, whatever\r\nmay become of the West. Our alliance of blood, and political institutions,\r\nand common interests, is such, that we can not stand aloof in the hour of\r\nher calamity, should it ever come. Her destiny is our destiny; and the day\r\nthat her gallant ship goes down, our little boat sinks in the vortex!\r\n\r\nThe great experiment is now making, and from its extent and rapid filling\r\nup, is making in the West, whether the perpetuity of our republican\r\ninstitutions can be reconciled with universal suffrage. Without the\r\neducation of the head and heart of the nation, they can not be; and the\r\nquestion to be decided is, can the nation, or the vast balance power of\r\nit, be so imbued with intelligence and virtue as to bring out, in laws and\r\ntheir administration, a perpetual self-preserving energy. We know that the\r\nwork is a vast one, and of great difficulty; and yet we believe it can be\r\ndone.\r\n\r\nI am aware that our ablest patriots are looking out on the deep, vexed\r\nwith storms, with great forebodings and failings of heart, for fear of the\r\nthings that are coming upon us; and I perceive a spirit of impatience\r\nrising, and distrust in respect to the perpetuity of our republic; and I\r\nam sure that these fears are well founded, and am glad that they exist. It\r\nis the star of hope in our dark horizon. Fear is what we need, as the ship\r\nneeds wind on a rocking sea, after a storm, to prevent foundering. But\r\nwhen our fear and our efforts shall correspond with our danger, the danger\r\nis past.\r\n\r\nFor it is not the impossibility of self-preservation which threatens us;\r\nnor is it the unwillingness of the nation to pay the price of the\r\npreservation, as she has paid the price of the purchase of our liberties.\r\nIt is inattention and inconsideration, protracted till the crisis is past,\r\nand the things which belong to our peace are hid from our eyes. And\r\nblessed be God, that the tokens of a national waking up, the harbinger of\r\nGod\'s mercy, are multiplying upon us!\r\n\r\nWe did not, in the darkest hour, believe that God had brought our fathers\r\nto this goodly land to lay the foundation of religious liberty, and\r\nwrought such wonders in their preservation, and raised their descendants\r\nto such heights of civil and religious liberty, only to reverse the\r\nanalogy of his providence, and abandon his work.\r\n\r\nAnd though there now be clouds, and the sea roaring, and men\'s hearts\r\nfailing, we believe there is light behind the cloud, and that the\r\nimminence of our danger is intended, under the guidance of Heaven, to call\r\nforth and apply a holy, fraternal fellowship between the East and the\r\nWest, which shall secure our preservation, and make the prosperity of our\r\nnation durable as time, and as abundant as the waves of the sea.\r\n\r\nI would add, as a motive to immediate action, that if we do fail in our\r\ngreat experiment of self-government, our destruction will be as signal as\r\nthe birthright abandoned, the mercies abused, and the provocation offered\r\nto beneficent Heaven. The descent of desolation will correspond with the\r\npast elevation.\r\n\r\nNo punishments of Heaven are so severe as those for mercies abused; and no\r\ninstrumentality employed in their infliction is so dreadful as the wrath\r\nof man. No spasms are like the spasms of expiring liberty, and no wailing\r\nsuch as her convulsions extort.\r\n\r\nIt took Rome three hundred years to die; and our death, if we perish, will\r\nbe as much more terrific as our intelligence and free institutions have\r\ngiven us more bone, sinew, and vitality. May God hide from me the day when\r\nthe dying agonies of my country shall begin! O thou beloved land, bound\r\ntogether by the ties of brotherhood, and common interest, and perils! live\r\nforever--one and undivided!\r\n                                                          --Lyman Beecher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLX. RIDING ON A SNOWPLOW. (231)\r\n\r\nBenjamin Franklin Taylor, 1822-1887, was born at Lowville, New York, and\r\ngraduated at Madison University, of which his father was president. Here\r\nhe remained as resident graduate for about five years. His "Attractions of\r\nLanguage" was published in 1845. For many years Mr. Taylor was literary\r\neditor of the "Chicago Journal." He wrote considerably for the magazines,\r\nand was the author of many well-known fugitive pieces, both in prose and\r\nverse. He also published several books, of which "January and June,"\r\n"Pictures in Camp and Field," "The World on Wheels," "Old-time Pictures\r\nand Sheaves of Rhyme," "Between the Gates," and "Songs of Yesterday," are\r\nthe best known. In his later years, Mr. Taylor achieved some reputation as\r\na lecturer. His writings are marked by an exuberant fancy.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nDid you ever ride on a snowplow? Not the pet and pony of a thing that is\r\nattached to the front of an engine, sometimes, like a pilot; but a great\r\ntwo-storied monster of strong timbers, that runs upon wheels of its own,\r\nand that boys run after and stare at as they would after and at an\r\nelephant. You are snow-bound at Buffalo. The Lake Shore Line is piled with\r\ndrifts like a surf. Two passenger trains have been half-buried for twelve\r\nhours somewhere in snowy Chautauqua. The storm howls like a congregation\r\nof Arctic bears. But the superintendent at Buffalo is determined to\r\nrelease his castaways, and clear the road to Erie. He permits you to be a\r\npassenger on the great snowplow; and there it is, all ready to drive.\r\nHarnessed behind it, is a tandem team of three engines. It does not occur\r\nto you that you are going to ride on a steam drill, and so you get aboard.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a spacious and timbered room, with one large bull\'s eye window,--an\r\novergrown lens. The thing is a sort of Cyclops. There are ropes, and\r\nchains, and a windlass. There is a bell by which the engineer of the first\r\nengine can signal the plowman, and a cord whereby the plowman can talk\r\nback. There are two sweeps, or arms, worked by machinery, on the sides.\r\nYou ask their use, and the superintendent replies, "When, in a violent\r\nshock, there is danger of the monster\'s upsetting, an arm is put out, on\r\none side or the other, to keep the thing from turning a complete\r\nsomersault." You get one idea, and an inkling of another. So you take out\r\nyour Accident Policy for three thousand dollars, and examine it. It never\r\nmentions battles, nor duels, nor snowplows. It names "public conveyances."\r\nIs a snowplow a public conveyance? You are inclined to think it is neither\r\nthat nor any other kind that you should trust yourself to, but it is too\r\nlate for consideration.\r\n\r\nYou roll out of Buffalo in the teeth of the wind, and the world is turned\r\nto snow. All goes merrily. The machine strikes little drifts, and they\r\nscurry away in a cloud. The three engines breathe easily; but by and by\r\nthe earth seems broken into great billows of dazzling white. The sun comes\r\nout of a cloud, and touches it up till it out-silvers Potosi. Houses lie\r\nin the trough of the sea everywhere, and it requires little imagination to\r\nthink they are pitching and tossing before your eyes. A great breaker\r\nrises right in the way. The monster, with you in it, works its way up and\r\nfeels of it. It is packed like a ledge of marble. Three whistles! The\r\nmachine backs away and keeps backing, as a gymnast runs astern to get sea\r\nroom and momentum for a big jump; as a giant swings aloft a heavy sledge,\r\nthat it may come down with a heavy blow.\r\n\r\nOne whistle! You have come to a halt. Three pairs of whistles one after\r\nthe other! and then, putting on all steam, you make for the drift. The\r\nsuperintendent locks the door, you do not quite understand why, and in a\r\nsecond the battle begins. The machine rocks and creaks in all its joints.\r\nThere comes a tremendous shock. The cabin is as dark as midnight. The\r\nclouds of flying snow put out the day. The labored breathing of the\r\nlocomotives behind you, the clouds of smoke and steam that wrap you up as\r\nin a mantle, the noonday eclipse of the sun, the surging of the ship, the\r\nrattling of chains, the creak of timbers as if the craft were aground and\r\nthe sea getting out of its bed to whelm you altogether, the doubt as to\r\nwhat will come,--all combine to make a scene of strange excitement for a\r\nlandlubber.\r\n\r\nYou have made some impression on the breaker, and again the machine backs\r\nfor a fair start, and then another plunge, and shock, and twilight. And\r\nso, from deep cut to deep cut, as if the season had packed all his winter\r\nclothes upon the track, until the stalled trains are reached and passed;\r\nand then, with alternate storm and calm, and halt and shock, till the way\r\nis cleared to Erie.\r\n\r\nIt is Sunday afternoon, and Erie--"Mad Anthony Wayne\'s" old\r\nheadquarters--has donned its Sunday clothes, and turned out by hundreds to\r\nsee the great plow come in,--its first voyage over the line. The\r\nlocomotives set up a crazy scream, and you draw slowly into the depot. The\r\ndoor opened at last, you clamber down, and gaze up at the uneasy house in\r\nwhich you have been living. It looks as if an avalanche had tumbled down\r\nupon it,--white as an Alpine shoulder. Your first thought is gratitude\r\nthat you have made a landing alive. Your second, a resolution that, if\r\nagain you ride a hammer, it will not be when three engines have hold of\r\nthe handle!\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--Chautauqua is the most western county in the state of New York; it\r\nborders on Lake Erie.\r\n\r\nThe Cyclops are described in Grecian mythology as giants having only one\r\neye, which was circular, and placed in the middle of the forehead.\r\n\r\nCerro de Potosi is a mountain in Bolivia, South America, celebrated for\r\nits mineral wealth. More than five thousand mines have been opened in it;\r\nthe product is chiefly silver.\r\n\r\n"Mad Anthony Wayne" (b. 1745, d. 1796), so called from his bravery and\r\napparent recklessness, was a famous American officer during the\r\nRevolution. In 1794 be conducted a successful campaign against the Indians\r\nof the Northwest, making his headquarters at Erie, Pa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXI. THE QUARREL OF BRUTUS AND CASSIUS. (234)\r\n\r\nCas. That you have wronged me doth appear in this:\r\n     You have condemned and noted Lucius Pella\r\n     For taking bribes here of the Sardians;\r\n     Wherein my letters, praying on his side,\r\n     Because I knew the man, were slighted off.\r\n     Bru. You wronged yourself to write in such a case.\r\nCas. In such a time as this, it is not meet\r\n     That every nice offense should bear his comment.\r\nBru. Yet let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself\r\n     Are much condemned to have an itching palm,\r\n     To sell and mart your offices for gold\r\n     To undeservers.\r\nCas.                  I an itching palm!\r\n     You know that you are Brutus that speak this,\r\n     Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.\r\nBru. The name of Cassius honors this corruption,\r\n     And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.\r\nCas. Chastisement!\r\nBru. Remember March, the ides of March remember!\r\n     Did not great Julius bleed for justice\' sake?\r\n     What villain touched his body, that did stab,\r\n     And not for justice? What! shall one of us,\r\n     That struck the foremost man of all this world\r\n     But for supporting robbers; shall we now\r\n     Contaminate our fingers with base bribes,\r\n     And sell the mighty space of our large honors\r\n     For so much trash as may be graspe\'d thus?\r\n     I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,\r\n     Than such a Roman.\r\nCas.                   Brutus, bay not me;\r\n     I\'ll not endure it: you forget yourself,\r\n     To hedge me in; I am a soldier, I,\r\n     Older in practice, abler than yourself\r\n     To make conditions.\r\nBru.                    Go to; you are not, Cassius.\r\nCas. I am.\r\nBru. I say you are not.\r\nCas. Urge me no more, I shall forget myself:\r\n     Have mind upon your health; tempt me no further.\r\nBru. Away, slight man!\r\nCas. Is\'t possible?\r\nBru.                Hear me, for I will speak.\r\n     Must I give way and room to your rash choler?\r\n     Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?\r\nCas. O ye gods! ye gods! must I endure all this?\r\nBru. All this! Ay, more: fret till your proud heart break;\r\n     Go, show your slaves how choleric you are,\r\n     And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?\r\n     Must I observe you? Must I stand and crouch\r\n     Under your testy humor? By the gods,\r\n     You shall digest the venom of your spleen,\r\n     Though it do split you; for, from this day forth,\r\n     I\'ll use you for my mirth, yea for my laughter,\r\n     When you are waspish.\r\nCas.                      Is it come to this?\r\nBru. You say you are a better soldier;\r\n     Let it appear so; make your vaunting true,\r\n     And it shall please me well: for mine own part,\r\n     I shall be glad to learn of noble men.\r\nCas. You wrong me every way; you wrong me, Brutus;\r\n     I said, an elder soldier, not a better:\r\n     Did I say "better"?\r\nBru.                     If you did, I care not.\r\nCas. When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.\r\nBru. Peace, peace! you durst not so have tempted him.\r\nCas. I durst not?\r\nBru. No.\r\nCas. What! durst not tempt him?\r\nBru.                            For your life, you durst not.\r\nCas. Do not presume too much upon my love;\r\n     I may do that I shall be sorry for.\r\nBru. You have done that you should be sorry for.\r\n     There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats;\r\n     For I am armed so strong in honesty\r\n     That they pass by me as the idle wind,\r\n     Which I respect not. I did send to you\r\n     For certain sums of gold, which you denied me;--\r\n     For I can raise no money by vile means:\r\n     By heaven! I had rather coin my heart,\r\n     And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring\r\n     From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash\r\n     By any indirection.--I did send\r\n     To you for gold to pay my legions,\r\n     Which you denied me: was that done like Cassius?\r\n     Should I have answered Caius Cassius so?\r\n     When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,\r\n     To lock such rascal counters from his friends,\r\n     Be ready, gods, with an your thunderbolts;\r\n     Dash him to pieces!\r\nCas.                     I denied you not.\r\nBru. You did.\r\nCas. I did not: he was but a fool that brought\r\n     My answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart:\r\n     A friend should bear his friend\'s infirmities,\r\n     But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.\r\nBru. I do not, till you practice them on me.\r\nCas. You love me not.\r\nBru.                  I do not like your faults.\r\nCas. A friendly eye could never see such faults.\r\nBru. A flatterer\'s would not, though they do appear\r\n     As huge as high Olympus.\r\nCas. Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,\r\n     Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,\r\n     For Cassius is aweary of the world;\r\n     Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;\r\n     Checked like a bondman; all his faults observed,\r\n     Set in a notebook, learned, and conned by rate,\r\n     To cast into my teeth. Oh, I could weep\r\n     My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,\r\n     And here my naked breast; within, a heart\r\n     Dearer than Plutus\' mine, richer than gold:\r\n     If that thou be\'st a Roman, take it forth:\r\n     I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart:\r\n     Strike, as thou didst at Caesar; for, I know,\r\n     When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better\r\n     Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.\r\nBru.                                 Sheathe your dagger:\r\n     Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;\r\n     Do what you will, dishonor shall be humor.\r\n     O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb\r\n     That carries anger as the flint bears fire;\r\n     Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,\r\n     And straight is cold again.\r\nCas.                             Hath Cassius lived\r\n     To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,\r\n     When grief, and blood ill-tempered, vexeth him?\r\nBru. When I spoke that, I was ill-tempered, too.\r\nCas. Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.\r\n\r\n238    ECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n\r\nBru. And my heart, too.\r\nCas.                   O Brutus!\r\nBru.                             What\'s the matter?\r\nCas. Have you not love enough to bear with me,\r\n     When that rash humor which my mother gave me\r\n     Makes me forgetful?\r\nBru.                     Yes, Cassius; and, from henceforth,\r\n     When you are over earnest with your Brutus,\r\n     He\'ll think your mother chides, and leave you so.\r\n\r\n                    Shakespeare.--Julius Caesar, Act iv, Scene iii.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--Ides (pro. idz) was a term used in the Roman calendar. It fell on\r\nthe fifteenth day of March, May, July, and October, and on the thirteenth\r\nof other months. On the ides of March, 44 B.

THE QUACK. (238)\r\n\r\nJohn Tobin, 1770-1804, a solicitor, was born at Salisbury, England, and\r\ndied on shipboard near Cork. He wrote several comedies, the most popular\r\nbeing "The Honeymoon," from which this extract is taken; it was published\r\nin 1805.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nSCENE--The Inn. Enter HOSTESS followed by LAMPEDO, a Quack Doctor.\r\n\r\nHost.  Nay, nay; another fortnight.\r\n       Lamp. It can\'t be.\r\n       The man\'s as well as I am: have some mercy!\r\n       He hath been here almost three weeks already.\r\nHost.  Well, then, a week.\r\nLamp.  We may detain him a week. (Enter BALTHAZAR, the patient,\r\n       from behind, in his nightgown, with a drawn sword.)\r\n       You talk now like a reasonable hostess,\r\n       That sometimes has a reckoning with her conscience.\r\nHost.  He still believes he has an inward bruise.\r\nLamp.  I would to heaven he had! or that he\'d slipped\r\n       His shoulder blade, or broke a leg or two,\r\n       (Not that I bear his person any malice,)\r\n       Or luxed an arm, or even sprained his ankle!\r\nHost.  Ay, broken anything except his neck.\r\nLamp.  However, for a week I\'ll manage him,\r\n       Though he had the constitution of a horse--\r\n       A farrier should prescribe for him.\r\nBalth. A farrier! (Aside. )\r\n       Lamp. To-morrow, we phlebotomize again;\r\n       Next day, my new-invented patent draught;\r\n       Then, I have some pills prepared;\r\n       On Thursday, we throw in the bark; on Friday--\r\nBalth. (Coming forward.) Well, sir, on Friday--what, on Friday? Come,\r\n       Proceed.\r\nLamp.  Discovered!\r\n\r\n   They (Host.,Lamp.) fall on their knees.\r\n\r\nHost.  Mercy, noble sir!\r\nLamp.  We crave your mercy!\r\nBalth. On your knees? \'tis well!\r\n       Pray! for your time is short.\r\nHost.  Nay, do not kill us.\r\nBalth. You have been tried, condemned, and only wait\r\n       For execution. Which shall I begin with?\r\nLamp.  The lady, by all means, sir.\r\nBalth. Come, prepare. (To the hostess.)\r\nHost.  Have pity by the weakness of my sex!\r\nBalth. Tell me, thou quaking mountain of gross flesh,\r\n       Tell me, and in a breath, how many poisons--\r\n       If you attempt it--(To LAMPEDO, who is making off)\r\n              you have cooked up for me?\r\nHost.  None, as I hope for mercy!\r\nBalth. Is not thy wine a poison?\r\nHost.  No indeed, sir;\r\n       \'T is not, I own, of the first quality;\r\n       But--\r\nBalth. What?\r\nHost.  I always give short measure, sir,\r\n       And ease my conscience that way.\r\nBalth. Ease your conscience!\r\n       I\'ll ease your conscience for you.\r\nHost.  Mercy, sir!\r\nBalth. Rise, if thou canst, and hear me.\r\nHost.  Your commands, sir?\r\nBalth. If, in five minutes, all things are prepared\r\n       For my departure, you may yet survive.\r\nHost.  It shall be done in less.\r\nBalth. Away, thou lumpfish. (Exit hostess.)\r\nLamp.  So! now comes my turn! \'t is all over with me!\r\n       There\'s dagger, rope, and ratsbane in his looks!\r\nBaith. And now, thou sketch and outline of a man!\r\n       Thou thing that hast no shadow in the sun!\r\n       Thou eel in a consumption, eldest born\r\n       Of Death and Famine! thou anatomy\r\n       Of a starved pilchard!\r\nLamp.  I do confess my leanness. I am spare,\r\n       And, therefore, spare me.\r\nBalth. Why wouldst thou have made me\r\n       A thoroughfare, for thy whole shop to pass through?\r\nLamp.  Man, you know, must live.\r\nBalth. Yes: he must die, too.\r\nLamp. For my patients\' sake!\r\nBalth. I\'ll send you to the major part of them--\r\n       The window, sir, is open;-come, prepare.\r\n       Lamp. Pray consider!\r\n       I may hurt some one in the street.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lampedo and Hostess kneeling, with hands folded, pleading\r\nwith Balthazar, who is standing over them, holding a sword. Several small\r\nglass bottles are on the table by the wall and scattered on the floor.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBalth. Why, then,\r\n       I\'ll rattle thee to pieces in a dicebox,\r\n       Or grind thee in a coffee mill to powder,\r\n       For thou must sup with Pluto:--so, make ready!\r\n       Whilst I, with this good smallsword for a lancet,\r\n       Let thy starved spirit out (for blood thou hast none),\r\n       And nail thee to the wall, where thou shalt look\r\n       Like a dried beetle with a pin stuck through him.\r\nLamp.  Consider my poor wife.\r\nBalth. Thy wife!\r\nLamp.  My wife, sir.\r\nBalth. Hast thou dared think of matrimony, too?\r\n       Thou shadow of a man, and base as lean!\r\nLamp.  O spare me for her sake!\r\n       I have a wife, and three angelic babes,\r\n       Who, by those looks, are well nigh fatherless.\r\nBalth. Well, well! your wife and children shall plead for you.\r\n       Come, come; the pills! where are the pills? Produce them.\r\nLamp.  Here is the box.\r\nBalth. Were it Pandora\'s, and each single pill\r\n       Had ten diseases in it, you should take them.\r\nLamp.  What, all?\r\nBalth. Ay, all; and quickly, too. Come, sir, begin--\r\n       (LAMPEDO takes one.) That\'s well!--Another.\r\nLamp.  One\'s a dose.\r\nBalth. Proceed, sir.\r\nLamp.  What will become of me?\r\n       Let me go home, and set my shop to rights,\r\n       And, like immortal Caesar, die with decency.\r\nBalth. Away! and thank thy lucky star I have not\r\n       Brayed thee in thine own mortar, or exposed thee\r\n       For a large specimen of the lizard genus.\r\nLamp.  Would I were one!--for they can feed on air.\r\nBalth. Home, sir! and be more honest.\r\nLump.  If I am not,\r\n       I\'ll be more wise, at least.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTEs.--Pluto, in ancient mythology, the god of the lower world.\r\n\r\nPandora is described in the Greek legends as the first created woman.

When she arrived among\r\nmen, she opened a box in which were all the evils of mankind, and\r\neverything escaped except Hope.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXIII. RIP VAN WINKLE. (242)\r\n\r\nThe appearance of Rip, with his long, grizzled beard, his rusty fowling\r\npiece, his uncouth dress, and an army of women and children at his heels,\r\nsoon attracted the attention of the tavern politicians. They crowded\r\naround him, eying him from head to foot with great curiosity. The orator\r\nbustled up to him, and, drawing him partly aside, inquired on which side\r\nhe voted. Rip stared in vacant stupidity. Another short but busy little\r\nfellow pulled him by the arm, and, rising on tiptoe, inquired in his ear\r\n"whether he was Federal or Democrat."\r\n\r\nRip was equally at a loss to comprehend the question; when a knowing,\r\nself-important old gentleman, in a sharp cocked hat, made his way through\r\nthe crowd, putting them to the right and left with his elbows as he\r\npassed, and planting himself before Van Winkle, with one arm akimbo, the\r\nother resting on his cane, his keen eyes and sharp hat, penetrating, as it\r\nwere, into his very soul, demanded, in an austere tone, what brought him\r\nto the election with a gun on his shoulder, and a mob at his heels, and\r\nwhether he meant to breed a riot in the village.\r\n\r\n"Alas! gentlemen," cried Rip, somewhat dismayed, "I am a poor, quiet man,\r\na native of the place, and a loyal subject of the king, God bless him!"\r\nHere a general shout burst from the bystanders.--"A tory! a tory! a spy! a\r\nrefugee! hustle him! away with him!" It was with great difficulty that the\r\nself-important man in the cocked hat restored order; and, having a tenfold\r\nausterity of brow, demanded again of the unknown culprit, what he came\r\nthere for, and whom he was seeking. The poor man humbly assured him that\r\nhe meant no harm, but merely came there in search of some of his\r\nneighbors, who used to keep about the tavern. "Well, who are they? name\r\nthem."\r\n\r\nRip bethought himself a moment, and inquired, "Where\'s Nicholas Vedder?"\r\nThere was a silence for a little while, when an old man replied, in a\r\nthin, piping voice, "Nicholas Vedder! why he is dead and gone these\r\neighteen years! There was a wooden tombstone in the churchyard that used\r\nto tell all about him, but that\'s rotten and gone too." "Where\'s Brom\r\nDutcher?" "Oh, he went off to the army in the beginning of the war. Some\r\nsay he was killed at the storming of Stony Point; others say he was\r\ndrowned in a squall at the foot of Anthony\'s Nose. I don\'t know; he never\r\ncame back again."\r\n\r\n"Where\'s Van Bummel, the schoolmaster?" "He went off to the wars,  too;\r\nwas a great militia general, and is now in Congress." Rip\'s heart died\r\naway at hearing of these sad changes in his home and friends, and finding\r\nhimself thus alone in the world. Every answer puzzled him, too, by\r\ntreating of such enormous lapses of time, and of matters which he could\r\nnot understand--war, Congress, Stony Point. He had no courage to ask after\r\nany more friends, but cried out in despair, "Does nobody here know Rip Van\r\nWinkle?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Rip Van Winkle!" exclaimed two or three. "Oh, to be sure! That\'s Rip\r\nVan Winkle yonder, leaning against the tree." Rip looked, and beheld a\r\nprecise counterpart of himself as he went up the mountain; apparently as\r\nlazy, and certainly as ragged. The poor fellow was now completely\r\nconfounded; he doubted his own identity, and whether he was himself or\r\nanother man. In the midst of his bewilderment, the man in the cocked hat\r\ndemanded who he was, and what was his name.\r\n\r\n"God knows!" exclaimed he, at his wit\'s end. "I\'m not myself; I\'m somebody\r\nelse; that\'s me yonder; no, that\'s somebody else got into my shoes. I was\r\nmyself last night; but I fell asleep on the mountain, and they\'ve changed\r\nmy gun, and everything\'s changed, and I\'m changed, and I can\'t tell what\'s\r\nmy name or who I am!"\r\n\r\nThe bystanders began now to look at each other, nod, wink significantly,\r\nand tap their fingers against their foreheads. There was a whisper, also,\r\nabout securing the gun, and keeping the old fellow from doing mischief, at\r\nthe very suggestion of which the self-important man in the cocked hat\r\nretired with some precipitation. At this critical moment, a fresh, comely\r\nwoman pressed through the throng to get a peep at the gray-bearded man.\r\nShe had a chubby child in her arms, which, frightened at his looks, began\r\nto cry. "Hush, Rip!" cried she, "hush, you little fool! the old man won\'t\r\nhurt you."\r\n\r\nThe name of the child, the air of the mother, the tone of her voice, all\r\nawakened a train of recollections in his mind. "What is your name, my good\r\nwoman?" asked he. "Judith Gardenier." "And your father\'s name?" "Ah, poor\r\nman! Rip Van Winkle was his name; but it\'s twenty years since he went away\r\nfrom home with his gun, and never has been heard of since; his dog came\r\nhome without him; but whether he shot himself, or was carried away by the\r\nIndians, nobody can tell. I was then but a little girl."\r\n\r\nRip had but one question more to ask; but he put it with a faltering\r\nvoice: "Where\'s your mother?" "Oh, she, too, died but a short time since;\r\nshe broke a blood vessel in a fit of passion at a New England peddler."\r\nThere was a drop of comfort, at least, in this intelligence. The honest\r\nman could contain himself no longer. He caught his daughter and her child\r\nin his arms. "I am your father!" cried he. "Young Rip Van Winkle once, old\r\nRip Van Winkle now! Does nobody know poor Rip Van Winkle?"\r\n\r\nAll stood amazed, until an old woman, tottering out from among the crowd,\r\nput her hand to her brow, and, peering under it in his face for a moment,\r\nexclaimed, "Sure enough! it is Rip Van Winkle! it is himself! Welcome home\r\nagain, old neighbor! Why, where have you been these twenty long years?"\r\nRip\'s story was soon told, for the whole twenty years had been to him but\r\nas one night.\r\n\r\nTo make a long story short, the company broke up and returned to the more\r\nimportant concerns of the election. Rip\'s daughter took him home to live\r\nwith her. She had a snug, well-furnished house, and a stout, cheery farmer\r\nfor a husband, whom Rip recollected for one of the urchins that used to\r\nclimb upon his back. Rip now resumed his old walks and habits. He soon\r\nfound many of his former cronies, though all rather the worse for the wear\r\nand tear of time, and preferred making friends among the rising\r\ngeneration, with whom he soon grew into great favor.\r\n                                                                 --Irving.\r\n\r\nNOTES.--Rip Van Winkle, according to Irving\'s story in "The Sketch Book,"\r\nwas a great drunkard, and was driven from his home in the Catskill\r\nMountains, one night, by his wife. Wandering among the mountains, he fell\r\nin with the ghosts of Hendrick Hudson and his crew, with whom he played a\r\ngame of ninepins. Upon drinking the liquor which they offered him,\r\nhowever, he immediately fell into a deep sleep which lasted for twenty\r\nyears. The above lesson recounts the events that befell him when he\r\nreturned to his native village. In the meantime the Revolution of 1776 had\r\ntaken place.\r\n\r\nThe Federals and the Democrats formed the two leading political parties of\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\nStony Point is a promontory on the Hudson, at the entrance of the\r\nHighlands, forty-two miles from New York. It was a fortified post during\r\nthe Revolution, captured by the British, and again retaken by the\r\nAmericans under Wayne. Anthony\'s Nose is also a promontory on the Hudson,\r\nabout fifteen miles above Stony Point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXIV. BILL AND JOE. (246)\r\n\r\nOliver Wendell Holmes, 1809-1894, was the son of Abiel Holmes, D.D. He was\r\nborn in Cambridge, Massachusetts, and graduated at Harvard in 1829, having\r\nfor classmates several men who have since become distinguished. After\r\ngraduating, he studied law for about one year, and then turned his\r\nattention to medicine. He studied his profession in Paris, and elsewhere\r\nin Europe, and took his degree at Cambridge in 1836. In 1838 he was\r\nappointed Professor of Anatomy and Physiology in Dartmouth College. He\r\nremained here but a short time, and then returned to Boston and entered on\r\nthe practice of medicine. In 1847 he was appointed professor at Harvard,\r\nfilling a similar position to the one held at Dartmouth. He discharged the\r\nduties of his professorship for more than thirty years, with great\r\nsuccess. Literature was never his profession; yet few American authors\r\nattained higher success, both as a poet and as a prose writer. His poems\r\nare lively and sparkling, abound in wit and humor, but are not wanting in\r\ngenuine pathos. Many of them were composed for special occasions. His\r\nprose writings include works on medicine, essays, and novels; several\r\nappeared first as contributions to the "Atlantic Monthly." He gained\r\nreputation, also, as it popular lecturer. In person, Dr. Holmes was small\r\nand active, with a face expressive of thought and vivacity.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nCome, dear old comrade, you and I\r\nWill steal an hour from days gone by--\r\nThe shining days when life was new,\r\nAnd all was bright as morning dew,\r\nThe lusty days of long ago,\r\nWhen you were Bill and I was Joe.\r\n\r\nYour name may flaunt a titled trail\r\nProud as a cockerel\'s rainbow tail,\r\nAnd mine as brief appendix wear\r\nAs Tam O\'Shanter\'s luckless mare;\r\nTo-day, old friend, remember still\r\nThat I am Joe and you are Bill.\r\n\r\nYou\'ve won the great world\'s envied prize,\r\nAnd grand you look in people\'s eyes,\r\nWith HON. and LL. D.,\r\nIn big, brave letters fair to see,--\r\nYour fist, old fellow! Off they go!--\r\nHow are you, Bill? How are you, Joe?\r\n\r\nYou\'ve worn the judge\'s ermined robe;\r\nYou\'ve taught your name to half the globe;\r\nYou\'ve sung mankind a deathless strain;\r\nYou\'ve made the dead past live again:\r\nThe world may call you what it will,\r\nBut you and I are Joe and Bill.\r\n\r\nThe chaffing young folks stare and say,\r\n"See those old buffers, bent and gray;\r\nThey talk like fellows in their teens;\r\nMad, poor old boys! That\'s what it means"\r\nAnd shake their heads; they little know\r\nThe throbbing hearts of Bill and Joe--\r\n\r\nHow Bill forgets his hour of pride,\r\nWhile Joe sits smiling at his side;\r\nHow Joe, in spite of time\'s disguise,\r\nFinds the old schoolmate in his eyes,--\r\nThose calm, stern eyes, that melt and fill,\r\nAs Joe looks fondly up to Bill.\r\n\r\nAh! pensive scholar, what is fame?\r\nA fitful tongue of leaping flame;\r\nA giddy whirlwind\'s fickle gust,\r\nThat lifts a pinch of mortal dust;\r\nA few swift years, and who can show\r\nWhich dust was Bill, and which was Joe.\r\n\r\nThe weary idol takes his stand,\r\nHolds out his bruised and aching hand,\r\nWhile gaping thousands come and go--\r\nHow vain it seems, this empty show!--\r\nTill all at once his pulses thrill:\r\n\'T is poor old Joe\'s, "God bless you, Bill!"\r\n\r\nAnd shall we breathe in happier spheres\r\nThe names that pleased our mortal ears;\r\nIn some sweet lull of heart and song\r\nFor earth born spirits none too long,\r\nJust whispering of the world below\r\nWhen this was Bill, and that was Joe?\r\n\r\nNo matter; while our home is here,\r\nNo sounding name is half so dear;\r\nWhen fades at length our lingering day,\r\nWho cares what pompous tombstones say?\r\nRead on the hearts that love us still,\r\nHic jacet Joe. Hic jacet Bill.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.--Hic jacet (pro. hic ja\'cet) is a Latin phrase, meaning here lies.\r\nIt is frequently used in epitaphs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXV. SORROW FOR THE DEAD. (249)\r\n\r\nThe sorrow for the dead is the only sorrow from which we refuse to be\r\ndivorced. Every other wound we seek to heal; every other affliction, to\r\nforget; but this wound we consider it a duty to keep open. This affliction\r\nwe cherish, and brood over in solitude. Where is the mother who would\r\nwillingly forget the infant that has perished like a blossom from her\r\narms, though every recollection is a pang? Where is the child that would\r\nwillingly forget a tender parent, though to remember be but to lament?\r\nWho, even in the hour of agony, would forget the friend over whom he\r\nmourns?\r\n\r\nNo, the love which survives the tomb is one of the noblest attributes of\r\nthe soul. If it has its woes, it has likewise its delights: and when the\r\noverwhelming burst of grief is calmed into the gentle tear of\r\nrecollection; when the sudden anguish and the convulsive agony over the\r\npresent ruins of all that we most loved, is softened away into pensive\r\nmeditation on all that it was in the days of its loveliness, who would\r\nroot out such a sorrow from the heart? Though it may, sometimes, throw a\r\npassing cloud over the bright hour of gayety, or spread a deeper sadness\r\nover the hour of gloom; yet, who would exchange it even for the song of\r\npleasure, or the burst of revelry? No, there is a voice from the tomb\r\nsweeter than song. There is a remembrance of the dead, to which we turn\r\neven from the charms of the living.\r\n\r\nOh, the grave! the grave! It buries every error, covers every defect,\r\nextinguishes every resentment! From its peaceful bosom spring none but\r\nfond regrets and tender recollections. Who can look down upon the grave\r\neven of an enemy, and not feel a compunctious throb, that he should have\r\nwarred with the poor handful of earth that lies moldering before him? But\r\nthe grave of those we loved--what a place for meditation! There it is that\r\nwe call up, in long review, the whole history of virtue and gentleness,\r\nand the thousand endearments lavished upon us, almost unheeded in the\r\ndaily intercourse of intimacy; there it is that we dwell upon the\r\ntenderness, the solemn, awful tenderness of the parting scene; the bed of\r\ndeath, with all its stifled griefs, its noiseless attendance, its mute,\r\nwatchful assiduities! the last testimonies of expiring love! the feeble,\r\nfluttering, thrilling,--oh! how thrilling!--pressure of the hand! the last\r\nfond look of the glazing eye turning upon us, even from the threshold of\r\nexistence! the faint, faltering accents, struggling in death to give one\r\nmore assurance of affection!\r\n\r\nAy, go to the grave of buried love, and meditate! There settle the account\r\nwith thy conscience for every past benefit unrequited; every past\r\nendearment unregarded, of that departed being, who can never--never--\r\nnever return to be soothed by thy contrition! If thou art a child, and\r\nhast ever added a sorrow to the soul, or a furrow to the silvered brow of\r\nan affectionate parent; if thou art a husband, and hast ever caused the\r\nfond bosom that ventured its whole happiness in thy arms to doubt one\r\nmoment of thy kindness or thy truth; if thou art a friend, and hast ever\r\nwronged, in thought, or word, or deed, the spirit that generously confided\r\nin thee; if thou hast given one unmerited pang to that true heart, which\r\nnow lies cold and still beneath thy feet; then be sure that every unkind\r\nlook, every ungracious word, every ungentle action, will come thronging\r\nback upon thy memory, and knocking dolefully at thy soul; then be sure\r\nthat thou wilt lie down sorrowing and repentant on the grave, and utter\r\nthe unheard groan, and pour the unavailing tear; more deep, more bitter,\r\nbecause unheard and unavailing.\r\n\r\nThen weave thy chaplet of flowers, and strew the beauties of nature about\r\nthe grave; console thy broken spirit, if thou canst, with these tender,\r\nyet futile, tributes of regret: but take warning by the bitterness of\r\nthis, thy contrite affliction over the dead, and henceforth be more\r\nfaithful and affectionate in the discharge of thy duties to the living.\r\n                                                             --Irving.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXVI. THE EAGLE. (251)\r\n\r\nJames Gates Percival, 1795-1856, was born at Berlin, Connecticut, and\r\ngraduated at Yale College in 1815, at the head of his class. He was\r\nadmitted to the practice of medicine in 1820, and went to Charleston,\r\nSouth Carolina. In 1824 he was appointed Professor of Chemistry at West\r\nPoint, a position which he held but a few months. In 1854 he was appointed\r\nState Geologist of Wisconsin, and died at Hazel Green, in that state. Dr.\r\nPercival was eminent as a geographer, geologist, and linguist. He began to\r\nwrite poetry at an early age, and his fame rests chiefly upon his writings\r\nin this department. In his private life, Percival was always shy, modest,\r\nand somewhat given to melancholy. Financially, his life was one of\r\nstruggle, and he was often greatly straitened for money.\r\n###\r\n\r\nBird of the broad and sweeping wing!\r\n  Thy home is high in heaven,\r\nWhere the wide storms their banners fling,\r\n  And the tempest clouds are driven.\r\nThy throne is on the mountain top;\r\n  Thy fields, the boundless air;\r\nAnd hoary peaks, that proudly prop\r\n  The skies, thy dwellings are.\r\n\r\nThou art perched aloft on the beetling crag,\r\n  And the waves are white below,\r\nAnd on, with a haste that can not lag,\r\n  They rush in an endless flow.\r\nAgain thou hast plumed thy wing for flight\r\n  To lands beyond the sea,\r\nAnd away, like a spirit wreathed in light,\r\n  Thou hurriest, wild and free.\r\n\r\nLord of the boundless realm of air!\r\n  In thy imperial name,\r\nThe hearts of the bold and ardent dare\r\n  The dangerous path of fame,\r\nBeneath the shade of thy golden wings,\r\n  The Roman legions bore,\r\nFrom the river of Egypt\'s cloudy springs,\r\n  Their pride, to the polar shore.\r\n\r\nFor thee they fought, for thee they fell,\r\n  And their oath on thee was laid;\r\nTo thee the clarions raised their swell,\r\n  And the dying warrior prayed.\r\nThou wert, through an age of death and fears,\r\n  The image of pride and power,\r\nTill the gathered rage of a thousand years,\r\n  Burst forth in one awful hour.\r\n\r\nAnd then, a deluge of wrath, it came,\r\n  And the nations shook with dread;\r\nAnd it swept the earth, till its fields were flame,\r\n  And piled with the mingled dead.\r\nKings were rolled in the wasteful flood,\r\n  With the low and crouching slave;\r\nAnd together lay, in a shroud of blood,\r\n  The coward and the brave.\r\n\r\nNOTES.--Roman legions. The Roman standard was the image of an eagle. The\r\nsoldiers swore by it, and the loss of it was considered a disgrace.\r\n\r\nOne awful hour. Alluding to the destruction of Rome by the northern\r\nbarbarians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXVII. POLITICAL TOLERATION. (253)\r\n\r\nThomas Jefferson, 1743-1826, the third President of the United States, and\r\nthe author of the Declaration of Independence, was born in Albemarle\r\nCounty, Virginia. He received most of his early education under private\r\ntutors, and at the age of seventeen entered William and Mary College,\r\nwhere he remained two years. At college, where he studied industriously,\r\nhe formed the acquaintance of several distinguished men, among them was\r\nGeorge Wythe, with whom he entered on the study of law. At the age of\r\ntwenty-four he was admitted to the bar, and soon rose to high standing in\r\nhis profession. In 1775 he entered the Colonial Congress, having\r\npreviously served ably in the legislature of his native state. Although\r\none of the youngest men in Congress, he soon took a foremost place in that\r\nbody. He left Congress in the fall of 1776, and, as a member of the\r\nlegislature, and later as Governor of Virginia, he was chiefly\r\ninstrumental in effecting several important reforms in the laws of that\r\nstate,--the most notable were the abolition of the law of primogeniture,\r\nand the passage of a law making all religious denominations equal. From\r\n1785 to 1789 he was Minister to France. On his return to America he was\r\nmade Secretary of State, in the first Cabinet. While in this office, he\r\nbecame the leader of the Republican or Anti-Federalist party, in\r\nopposition to the Federalist party led by Alexander Hamilton. From 1801 to\r\n1809 he was President. On leaving his high office, he retired to his\r\nestate at "Monticello," where he passed the closing years of his life, and\r\ndied on the 4th of July, just fifty years after the passage of his famous\r\nDeclaration. His compatriot, and sometimes bitter political opponent, John\r\nAdams, died on the same day.\r\n\r\nMr. Jefferson, who was never a ready public speaker, was a remarkably\r\nclear and forcible writer; his works fill several large volumes. In\r\npersonal character, he was pure and simple, cheerful, and disposed to look\r\non the bright side. His knowledge of life rendered his conversation highly\r\nattractive. The chief enterprise of his later years was the founding of\r\nthe University of Virginia, at Charlottesville.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the contest of opinion through which we have passed, the animation\r\nof discussions and of exertions has sometimes worn an aspect which might\r\nimpose on strangers, unused to think freely and to speak and to write what\r\nthey think; but this being now decided by the voice of the nation,\r\nannounced according to the rules of the constitution, all will, of course,\r\narrange themselves under the will of the law, and unite in common efforts\r\nfor the common good.\r\n\r\nAll, too, will bear in mind this sacred principle, that, though the will\r\nof the majority is, in all cases, to prevail, that will, to be rightful,\r\nmust be reasonable; that the minority possess their equal rights, which\r\nequal laws must protect, and to violate which would be oppression. Let us\r\nthen, fellow-citizens, unite with one heart and one mind.\r\n\r\nLet us restore to social intercourse that harmony and affection, without\r\nwhich liberty, and even life itself, are but dreary things; and let us\r\nreflect, that, having banished from our land that religious intolerance\r\nunder which mankind so long bled and suffered, we have gained little if we\r\ncountenance a political intolerance as despotic, as wicked, and capable of\r\nas bitter and bloody persecutions.\r\n\r\nDuring the throes and convulsions of the ancient world; during the\r\nagonizing spasms of infuriated man, seeking, through blood and slaughter,\r\nhis long-lost liberty; it was not wonderful that the agitation of the\r\nbillows should reach even this distant and peaceful shore; that this\r\nshould be more felt and feared by some, and less by others, and should\r\ndivide opinions as to measures of safety.\r\n\r\nBut every difference of opinion is not a difference of principle. We have\r\ncalled by different names brethren of the same principle. We are all\r\nRepublicans; we are all Federalists. If there be any among us who would\r\nwish to dissolve this Union, or to change its republican form, let them\r\nstand undisturbed as monuments of the safety with which error of opinion\r\nmay be tolerated when reason is left free to combat it.\r\n\r\nI know, indeed, that some honest men fear that a republican government can\r\nnot be strong; that this government is not strong enough. But would the\r\nhonest patriot, in the full tide of successful experiment, abandon a\r\ngovernment which has so far kept us free and firm, on the theoretic and\r\nvisionary fear that this government, the world\'s best hope, may, by\r\npossibility, want energy to preserve itself? I trust not; I believe this,\r\non the contrary, the strongest government on earth.\r\n\r\nI believe it to be the only one where every man, at the call of the law,\r\nwould fly to the standard of the law, and would meet invasions of the\r\npublic order as his own personal concern. Sometimes it is said that man\r\ncan not be trusted with the government of himself. Can he, then, be\r\ntrusted with the government of others, or have we found angels, in the\r\nform of kings, to govern him? Let history answer this question. Let us,\r\nthen, with courage and confidence, pursue our own federal and republican\r\nprinciples; our attachment to union and representative government.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--At the time of Jefferson\'s election, party spirit ran very high. He\r\nhad been defeated by John Adams at the previous presidential election, but\r\nthe Federal party, to which Adams belonged, became weakened by their\r\nmanagement during difficulties with France; and now Jefferson had been\r\nelected president over his formerly successful rival. The above selection\r\nis from his inaugural address.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXVIII. WHAT CONSTITUTES A STATE? (255)\r\n\r\nSir William Jones, 1746-1794, was the son of an eminent mathematician; he\r\nearly distinguished himself by his ability as a student. He graduated at\r\nOxford, became well versed in Oriental literature, studied law, and wrote\r\nmany able books. In 1783 he was appointed Judge of the Supreme Court of\r\nJudicature in Bengal. He was a man of astonishing learning, upright life,\r\nand Christian principles.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\n  What constitutes a state?\r\nNot high-raised battlement or labored mound,\r\n  Thick wall or moated gate;\r\nNot cities proud with spires and turrets crowned;\r\n  Not bays and broad-armed ports,\r\nWhere, laughing at the storm, rich navies ride;\r\n  Not starred and spangled courts,\r\nWhere low-browed baseness wafts perfume to pride.\r\n\r\n  No:--men, high-minded men,\r\nWith powers as far above dull brutes endued\r\n  In forest, brake, or den,\r\nAs beasts excel cold rocks and brambles rude,--\r\n  Men who their duties know,\r\nBut know their rights, and, knowing, dare maintain,\r\n  Prevent the long-aimed blow,\r\nAnd crush the tyrant while they rend the chain:\r\n  These constitute a state;\r\nAnd sovereign Law, that state\'s collected will,\r\n  O\'er thrones and globes elate,\r\nSits empress, crowning good, repressing ill.\r\n\r\n\r\nLXIX. THE BRAVE AT HOME. (256)\r\n\r\nThomas Buchanan Read, 1822-1872, an American poet and painter, was born in\r\nChester County, Pennsylvania. At the age of seventeen he entered a\r\nsculptor\'s studio in Cincinnati. Here he gained reputation as a painter of\r\nportraits. From this city he went to New York, Boston, and Philadelphia,\r\nand soon after to Florence, Italy. In the later years of his life, he\r\ndivided his time between Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and Rome. His complete\r\npoetical works fill three volumes. Several of his most stirring poems\r\nrelate to the Revolutionary War, and to the late Civil War in America.\r\nMany of his poems are marked by vigor and a ringing power, while\r\nsmoothness and delicacy distinguish others, no less.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nThe maid who binds her warrior\'s sash,\r\n  And, smiling, all her pain dissembles,\r\nThe while beneath the drooping lash,\r\n  One starry tear-drop hangs and trembles;\r\nThough Heaven alone records the tear,\r\n  And fame shall never know her story,\r\nHer heart has shed a drop as dear\r\n  As ever dewed the field of glory!\r\n\r\nThe wife who girds her husband\'s sword,\r\n  \'Mid little ones who weep and wonder,\r\nAnd bravely speaks the cheering word,\r\n  What though her heart be rent asunder;--\r\nDoomed nightly in her dreams to hear\r\n  The bolts of war around him rattle,--\r\nHas shed as sacred blood as e\'er\r\n  Was poured upon the field of battle!\r\n\r\nThe mother who conceals her grief,\r\n  While to her breast her son she presses,\r\nThen breathes a few brave words and brief,\r\n  Kissing the patriot brow she blesses;\r\nWith no one but her loving God,\r\n  To know the pain that weighs upon her,\r\nSheds holy blood as e\'er the sod\r\n  Received on Freedom\'s field of honor!\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.--The above selection is from the poem entitled "The Wagoner of the\r\nAlleghanies."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXX. SOUTH CAROLINA. (257)\r\n\r\nRobert Young Hayne, 1791-1840, was born in Colleton District, South\r\nCarolina, and studied and practiced law at Charleston. He was early\r\nelected to the State Legislature, and became Speaker of the House and\r\nAttorney-general of the state. He entered the Senate of the United States\r\nat the age of thirty-one. He was Governor of South Carolina during the\r\n"Nullification" troubles in 1832 and 1833. Mr. Hayne was a clear and able\r\ndebater, and a stanch advocate of the extreme doctrine of "State Rights."\r\nIn the Senate he opposed the Tariff Bill of 1828; and, out of this\r\nstruggle, grew his famous debate with Daniel Webster in 1830. The\r\nfollowing selection is an extract from Mr. Hayne\'s speech on that\r\nmemorable occasion.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there be one state in the Union, Mr. President, that may challenge\r\ncomparison with any other, for a uniform, zealous, ardent, and\r\nuncalculating devotion to the Union, that state is South Carolina. Sir,\r\nfrom the very commencement of the Revolution, up to this hour, there is no\r\nsacrifice, however great, she has not cheerfully made; no service she has\r\never hesitated to perform.\r\n\r\nShe has adhered to you in your prosperity; but in your adversity she has\r\nclung to you with more than filial affection. No matter what was the\r\ncondition of her domestic affairs; though deprived of her resources,\r\ndivided by parties, or surrounded by difficulties, the call of the country\r\nhas been to her as the voice of God. Domestic discord ceased at the sound;\r\nevery man became at once reconciled to his brethren, and the sons of\r\nCarolina were all seen, crowding to the temple, bringing their gifts to\r\nthe altar of their common country.\r\n\r\nWhat, sir, was the conduct of the South, during the Revolution? Sir, I\r\nhonor New England for her conduct in that glorious struggle. But great as\r\nis the praise which belongs to her, I think at least equal honor is due to\r\nthe South. Never were there exhibited, in the history of the world, higher\r\nexamples of noble daring, dreadful suffering, and heroic endurance, than\r\nby the whigs of Carolina, during the Revolution. The whole state, from the\r\nmountains to the sea, was overrun by an overwhelming force of the enemy.\r\nThe fruits of industry perished on the spot where they were produced, or\r\nwere consumed by the foe.\r\n\r\nThe plains of Carolina drank up the most precious blood of her citizens.\r\nBlack, smoking ruins marked the places which had been the habitation of\r\nher children. Driven from their homes into the gloomy and almost\r\nimpenetrable swamps, even there the spirit of liberty survived, and South\r\nCarolina, sustained by the example of her Sumters and her Marions, proved,\r\nby her conduct, that though her soil might be overrun, the spirit of her\r\npeople was invincible.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--Thomas Sumter (b. 1734, d. 1832) was by birth a Virginian, but\r\nduring the Revolution commanded South Carolina troops. He was one of the\r\nmost active and able of the Southern generals, and, after the war, was\r\nprominent in politics. He was the last surviving general of the\r\nRevolution.\r\n\r\nFrancis Marion (b. 1732, d. 1795), known as the "Swamp Fox," was a native\r\nSouth Carolinian, of French descent. Marion\'s brigade became noted during\r\nthe Revolution for its daring and surprising attacks. See Lesson CXXXV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXI. MASSACHUSETTS AND SOUTH CAROLINA. (259)\r\n\r\nDaniel Webster, 1782-1852. This celebrated American statesman and orator\r\nwas born in Salisbury, New Hampshire. His father, Ebenezer Webster, was a\r\npioneer settler, a soldier in the Old French War and the Revolution, and a\r\nman of ability and strict integrity, Daniel attended the common school in\r\nhis youth, and fitted for college under Rev. Samuel Wood, of Boseawen,\r\ngraduating at Dartmouth in 1801. He spent a few months of his boyhood at\r\n"Phillips Academy," Exeter, where he attained distinction as a student,\r\nbut was so diffident that he could never give a declamation before his\r\nclass. During his college course, and later, he taught school several\r\nterms in order to increase his slender finances. He was admitted to the\r\nbar in Boston in 1805. For the next eleven years, he practiced his\r\nprofession in his native state. In 1812 he was elected to the United\r\nStates House of Representatives, and at once took his place as one of the\r\nmost prominent men of that body. In 1816 he removed to Boston; and in 1827\r\nhe was elected to the United States Senate, where he continued for twelve\r\nyears. In 1841 he was made Secretary of State, and soon after negotiated\r\nthe famous "Ashburton Treaty" with England, settling the northern boundary\r\nof the United States. In 1845 he returned to the Senate; and in 1850 he\r\nwas re-appointed Secretary of State, and continued in office till his\r\ndeath. He died at his country residence in Marshfield, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nMr. Webster\'s fame rests chiefly on his state papers and his speeches in\r\nCongress; but he took a prominent part in some of the most famous law\r\ncases of the present century. Several of his public addresses on\r\noccasional themes are well known, also. As a speaker, he was dignified and\r\nstately, using clear, straightforward, pure English. He had none of the\r\ntricks of oratory. He was large of person, with a massive head, a swarthy\r\ncomplexion, and deep-set, keen, and lustrous eyes. His grand presence\r\nadded much to his power as a speaker.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nThe eulogium pronounced on the character of the State of South Carolina by\r\nthe honorable gentleman, for her Revolutionary and other merits, meets my\r\nhearty concurrence. I shall not acknowledge that the honorable member goes\r\nbefore me, in regard for whatever of distinguished talent or distinguished\r\ncharacter South Carolina has produced. I claim part of the honor; I\r\npartake in the pride of her great names. I claim them for countrymen, one\r\nand all--the Laurenses, the Rutledges, the Pinckneys, the Sumters, the\r\nMarions--Americans all--whose fame is no more to be hemmed in by state\r\nlines than their talents and patriotism were capable of being\r\ncircumscribed within the same narrow limits.\r\n\r\nIn their day and generation, they served and honored the country, and the\r\nwhole country, and their renown is of the treasures of the whole country.\r\nHim whose honored name the gentleman himself bears,--does he suppose me\r\nless capable of gratitude for his patriotism, or sympathy for his\r\nsuffering, than if his eyes had first opened upon the light in\r\nMassachusetts, instead of South Carolina? Sir, does he suppose it in his\r\npower to exhibit in Carolina a name so bright as to produce envy in my\r\nbosom? No, sir,--increased gratification and delight rather. Sir, I thank\r\nGod that, if I am gifted with little of the spirit which is said to be\r\nable to raise mortals to the skies, I have yet none, as I trust, of that\r\nother spirit which would drag angels down.\r\n\r\nWhen I shall be found, sir, in my place here in the Senate, or elsewhere,\r\nto sneer at public merit because it happened to spring up beyond the\r\nlittle limits of my own state or neighborhood; when I refuse for any such\r\ncause, or for any cause, the homage due to American talent, to elevated\r\npatriotism, to sincere devotion to liberty and the country; or if I see an\r\nuncommon endowment of Heaven; if I see extraordinary capacity or virtue in\r\nany son of the South; and if, moved by local prejudice, or gangrened by\r\nstate jealousy, I get up here to abate a tithe of a hair from his just\r\ncharacter and just fame, may my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth!\r\n\r\nMr. President, I shall enter on no encomium upon Massachusetts. She needs\r\nnone. There she is; behold her, and judge for yourselves. There is her\r\nhistory; the world knows it by heart. The past, at least, is secure. There\r\nis Boston, and Concord, and Lexington, and Bunker Hill; and there they\r\nwill remain forever. And, sir, where American Liberty raised its first\r\nvoice, and where its youth was nurtured and sustained, there it still\r\nlives, in the strength of its manhood, and full of its original spirit. If\r\ndiscord and disunion shall wound it; if party strife and blind ambition\r\nshall hawk at and tear it; if folly and madness, if uneasiness under\r\nsalutary restraint, shall succeed to separate it from that Union, by which\r\nalone its existence is made sure, it will stand, in the end, by the side\r\nof that cradle in which its infancy was rocked; it will stretch forth its\r\narm, with whatever of vigor it may still retain, over the friends who\r\ngathered around it; and it will fall at last, if fall it must, amid the\r\nproudest monuments of its glory and on the very spot of its origin.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--The Laurenses were of French descent. Henry Laurens was appointed\r\non the commission with Franklin and Jay to negotiate the treaty of peace\r\nat Paris at the close of the Revolution. His son, John Laurens, was an aid\r\nand secretary of Washington, who was greatly attached to him.\r\n\r\nThe Rutledges were of Irish descent. John Rutledge was a celebrated\r\nstatesman and lawyer. He was appointed Chief Justice of the United States,\r\nbut the Senate, for political reasons, refused to confirm his appointment.\r\n\r\n\r\nEdward Rutledge, brother of the preceding, was Governor of South Carolina\r\nduring the last two years of his life.\r\n\r\nThe Pinckneys were an old English family who emigrated to Charleston in\r\n1687. Charles Cotesworth Pinckney and his brother Thomas were both active\r\nparticipants in the Revolution. The former was an unsuccessful candidate\r\nfor the presidency of the United States, in 1800.\r\n\r\nThomas was elected governor of South Carolina in 1789. In the war of 1812\r\nhe served as major-general.\r\n\r\nCharles Pinckney, a second cousin of the two already mentioned, was four\r\ntimes elected governor of his state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXII. THE CHURCH SCENE FROM EVANGELINE. (262)\r\n\r\nHenry Wadsworth Longfellow, 1807-1882, the son of Hon. Stephen Longfellow,\r\nan eminent lawyer of Portland, Maine, was born in that city. He graduated,\r\nat the age of eighteen, at Bowdoin College. He was soon appointed to the\r\nchair of Modern Languages and Literature in that institution, and, to fit\r\nhimself further for his work, he went abroad and spent four years in\r\nEurope. He remained at Bowdoin till 1835, when he was appointed to the\r\nchair of Modern Languages and Belles-lettres in Harvard University. On\r\nreceiving this appointment, he again went to Europe and remained two\r\nyears. He resigned his professorship in 1854, and after that time resided\r\nin Cambridge, pursuing his literary labors and giving to the public, from\r\ntime to time, the fruits of his pen. In 1868 he made a voyage to England,\r\nwhere he was received with extraordinary marks of honor and esteem. In\r\naddition to Mr. Longfellow\'s original works, both in poetry and in prose,\r\nhe distinguished himself by several translations; the most famous is that\r\nof the works of Dante.\r\n\r\nMr. Longfellow\'s poetry is always elegant and chaste, showing in every\r\nline traces of his careful scholarship. Yet it is not above the popular\r\ntaste or comprehension, as is shown by the numerous and varied editions of\r\nhis poems. Many of his poems treat of historical themes; "Evangeline,"\r\nfrom which the following selection is taken, is esteemed by many as the\r\nmost beautiful of all his longer poems; it was first published in 1847.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nSo passed the morning away. And lo! with a summons sonorous\r\nSounded the bell from its tower, and over the meadows a drumbeat.\r\nThronged erelong was the church with men. Without, in the churchyard,\r\nAwaited the women. They stood by the graves, and hung on the headstones\r\nGarlands of autumn leaves and evergreens fresh from the forest.\r\nThen came the guard from the ships, and marching proudly among them\r\nEntered the sacred portal. With loud and dissonant clangor\r\nEchoed the sound of their brazen drums from ceiling and casement,--\r\nEchoed a moment only, and slowly the ponderous portal\r\nClosed, and in silence the crowd awaited the will of the soldiers.\r\n\r\nThen uprose their commander, and spake from the steps of the altar,\r\nHolding aloft in his hands, with its seals, the royal commission.\r\n"You have convened this day," he said, "by his Majesty\'s orders.\r\nClement and kind has he been; but how you have answered his kindness,\r\nLet your own hearts reply! To my natural make and my temper\r\nPainful the task is I do, which to you I know must be grievous.\r\nYet must I bow and obey, and deliver the will of our monarch;\r\nNamely, that all your lands, and dwellings, and cattle of all kinds\r\nForfeited be to the crown; and that you yourselves from this province\r\nBe transported to other lands. God grant you may dwell there\r\nEver as faithful subjects, a happy and peaceable people!\r\nPrisoners now I declare you; for such is his Majesty\'s pleasure!"\r\n\r\nAs, when the air is serene in the sultry solstice of summer,\r\nSuddenly gathers a storm, and the deadly sling of the hailstones\r\nBeats down the farmer\'s corn in the field and shatters his windows,\r\nHiding the sun, and strewing the ground with thatch from the house roofs,\r\nBellowing fly the herds, and seek to break their inclosure;\r\nSo on the hearts of the people descended the words of the speaker.\r\nSilent a moment they stood in speechless wonder, and then rose\r\nLouder and ever louder a wail of sorrow and anger,\r\nAnd, by one impulse moved, they madly rushed to the doorway.\r\n\r\nVain was the hope of escape; and cries and fierce imprecations\r\nRang through the house of prayer; and high o\'er the heads of the others\r\nRose, with his arms uplifted, the figure of Basil the blacksmith,\r\nAs, on a stormy sea, a spar is tossed by the billows.\r\nFlushed was his face and distorted with passion; and wildly he shouted,--\r\n"Down with the tyrants of England! we never have sworn them allegiance!\r\nDeath to these foreign soldiers, who seize on our homes and our harvests!"\r\nMore he fain would have said, but the merciless hand of a soldier\r\nSmote him upon the mouth, and dragged him down to the pavement.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the strife and tumult of angry contention,\r\nLo! the door of the chancel opened, and Father Felician\r\nEntered, with serious mien, and ascended the steps of the alter.\r\nRaising his reverend hand, with a gesture he awed into silence\r\nAll that clamorous throng; and thus he spake to his people;\r\nDeep were his tones and solemn; in accents measured and mournful\r\nSpake he, as, after the tocsin\'s alarum, distinctly the clock strikes.\r\n\r\n"What is this that ye do, my children? what madness has seized you?\r\nForty years of my life have I labored among you, and taught you,\r\nNot in word alone, but in deed, to love one another!\r\nIs this the fruit of my toils, of my vigils and prayers and privations?\r\nHave you so soon forgotten all the lessons of love and forgiveness?\r\nThis is the house of the Prince of Peace, and would you profane it\r\nThus with violent deeds and hearts overflowing with hatred?\r\nLo! where the crucified Christ from his cross is gazing upon you!\r\nSee! in those sorrowful eyes what meekness and holy compassion!\r\nHark! how those lips still repeat the prayer, \'O Father, forgive them!\'\r\nLet us repeat that prayer in the hour when the wicked assail us,\r\nLet us repeat it now, and say, \'O Father, forgive them.\' "\r\n\r\nFew were his words of rebuke, but deep in the hearts of his people\r\nSank they, and sobs of contrition succeeded the passionate outbreak,\r\nWhile they repeated his prayer, and said, "O Father, forgive them!"\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.--Nova Scotia was first settled by the French, but, in 1713, was\r\nceded to the English. The inhabitants refusing either to take the oath of\r\nallegiance or to bear arms against their fellow-countrymen in the French\r\nand Indian War, it was decided to remove the whole people, and distribute\r\nthem among the other British provinces. This was accordingly done in 1755.\r\nThe villages were burned to the ground, and the people hurried on board\r\nthe ships in such a way that but a few families remained undivided.\r\n\r\nLongfellow\'s poem of "Evangeline" is founded on this incident, and the\r\nabove selection describes the scene where the male inhabitants of\r\nGrand-Pre\' are assembled in the church, and the order for their banishment\r\nis first made known to them.\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXIII. SONG OF THE SHIRT. (266)\r\n\r\nThomas Hood, 1798-1845, the son of a London bookseller, was born in that\r\ncity. He undertook, after leaving school, to learn the art of an engraver,\r\nbut soon gave up the business, and turned his attention to literature. His\r\nlighter pieces, exhibiting his skill as a wit and punster, soon became\r\nwell known and popular. In 1821 he became subeditor of the "London\r\nMagazine," and formed the acquaintance of the literary men of the\r\nmetropolis. The last years of his life were clouded by poverty and ill\r\nhealth. Some of his most humorous pieces were written on a sick bed. Hood\r\nis best known as a joker--a writer of "whims and oddities"--but he was no\r\nmere joker. Some of his pieces are filled with the tenderest pathos; and a\r\ngentle spirit, in love with justice and humanity, pervades even his\r\nlighter compositions. His "Song of the Shirt" first appeared in the\r\n"London Punch."\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nWith fingers weary and worn,\r\n  With eyelids heavy and red,\r\nA woman sat, in unwomanly rags,\r\n  Plying her needle and thread:\r\nStitch! stitch! stitch!\r\n  In poverty, hunger, and dirt,\r\nAnd still with a voice of dolorous pitch,\r\n  She sang the "Song of the Shirt!"\r\n\r\n  "Work! work! work!\r\nWhile the cock is crowing aloof!\r\n  And work! work! work!\r\nTill the stars shine through the roof!\r\n  It is oh to be a slave\r\nAlong with the barbarous Turk,\r\n  Where woman has never a soul to save,\r\nIf this is Christian work!\r\n\r\n  "Work! work! work!\r\nTill the brain begins to swim;\r\n  Work! work! work!\r\nTill the eyes are heavy and dim!\r\n  Seam, and gusset, and band,\r\nBand, and gusset, and seam,\r\n  Till over the buttons I fall asleep,\r\nAnd sew them on in a dream!\r\n\r\n  "O men, with sisters dear!\r\n   O men, with mothers and wives!\r\nIt is not linen you\'re wearing out,\r\n  But human creatures\' lives!\r\n    Stitch! stitch! stitch!\r\n  In poverty, hunger, and dirt,--\r\nSewing at once, with a double thread,\r\n  A shroud as well as a shirt.\r\n\r\n "But why do I talk of Death?\r\n  That Phantom of grisly bone,\r\nI hardly fear his terrible shape,\r\n  It seems so like my own;\r\n  It seems so like my own,\r\n  Because of the fasts I keep;\r\nO God! that bread should be so dear,\r\n  And flesh and blood so cheap!\r\n\r\n  "Work! work! work!\r\nMy labor never flags;\r\n  And what are its wages? A bed of straw,\r\nA crust of bread--and rags,\r\n  That shattered roof--and this naked floor--\r\nA table--a broken chair--\r\n  And a wall so blank, my shadow I thank\r\nFor sometimes falling there.\r\n\r\n  "Work! work! work!\r\nFrom weary chime to chime!\r\n  Work! work! work!\r\nAs prisoners work for crime!\r\n  Band, and gusset, and seam,\r\n  Seam, and gusset, and band,\r\nTill the heart is sick, and the brain benumbed,\r\n  As well as the weary hand.\r\n\r\n  "Work! work! work!\r\nIn the dull December light,\r\n  And work! work! work!\r\nWhen the weather is warm and bright;\r\nWhile underneath the eaves\r\n  The brooding swallows cling,\r\nAs if to show me their sunny backs,\r\n  And twit me with the spring.\r\n\r\n  "Oh but to breathe the breath\r\n  Of the cowslip and primrose sweet!\r\nWith the sky above my head,\r\n  And the grass beneath my feet!\r\nFor only one short hour\r\n  To feel as I used to feel,\r\nBefore I knew the woes of want,\r\n  And the walk that costs a meal!\r\n\r\n  "Oh but for one short hour,--\r\n  A respite, however brief!\r\nNo blessed leisure for love or hope,\r\n  But only time for grief!\r\nA little weeping would ease my heart,\r\n  But in their briny bed\r\nMy tears must stop, for every drop\r\n  Hinders needle and thread."\r\n\r\nWith fingers weary and worn,\r\n  With eyelids heavy and red,\r\nA woman sat, in unwomanly rags,\r\n  Plying her needle and thread:\r\n    Stitch! stitch! stitch!\r\n  In poverty, hunger, and dirt,\r\nAnd still with a voice of dolorous pitch--\r\nWould that its tone could reach the rich!\r\n  She sang this "Song of the Shirt."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXIV. DIAMOND CUT DIAMOND. (269)\r\n\r\nEdouard Rene Lefebvre-Laboulaye, 1811-1883, was a French writer of note.\r\nMost of his works involve questions of law and politics, and are\r\nconsidered high authority on the questions discussed. A few works, such as\r\n"Abdallah," from which the following extract is adapted, were written as a\r\nmere recreation in the midst of law studies; they show great imaginative\r\npower. Laboulaye took great interest in the United States, her people, and\r\nher literature; and many of his works are devoted to American questions.\r\nHe translated the works of Dr. William E. Channing into French.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nMansour, the Egyptian merchant, one day repaired to the cadi on account of\r\na suit, the issue of which troubled him but little. A private conversation\r\nwith the judge had given him hopes of the justice of his cause. The old\r\nman asked his son Omar to accompany him in order to accustom him early to\r\ndeal with the law.\r\n\r\nThe cadi was seated in the courtyard of the mosque. He was a fat,\r\ngood-looking man, who never thought, and talked little, which, added to\r\nhis large turban and his air of perpetual astonishment, gave him a great\r\nreputation for justice and gravity.\r\n\r\nThe spectators were numerous; the principal merchants were seated on the\r\nground on carpets, forming a semicircle around the magistrate. Mansour\r\ntook his seat a little way from the sheik, and Omar placed himself between\r\nthe two, his curiosity strongly excited to see how the law was obeyed, and\r\nhow it was trifled with in case of need.\r\n\r\nThe first case called was that of a young Banian, as yellow as an orange,\r\nwith loose flowing robes and an effeminate air, who had lately landed from\r\nIndia, and who complained of having been cheated by one of Mansour\'s\r\nrivals.\r\n\r\n"Having found a casket of diamonds among the effects left by my father,"\r\nsaid he, "I set out for Egypt, to live there on the proceeds of their\r\nsale. I was obliged by bad weather to put into Jidda, where I soon found\r\nmyself in want of money. I went to the bazaar, and inquired for a dealer\r\nin precious stones. The richest, I was told, was Mansour; the most honest,\r\nAli, the jeweler. I applied to Ali.\r\n\r\n"He welcomed me as a son, as soon as he learned that I had diamonds to\r\nsell, and carried me home with him. He gained my confidence by every kind\r\nof attention, and advanced me all the money I needed. One day, after\r\ndinner, at which wine was not wanting, he examined the diamonds, one by\r\none, and said, \'My child, these diamonds are of little value; my coffers\r\nare full of such stones. The rocks of the desert furnish them by\r\nthousands.\'\r\n\r\n"To prove the truth of what he said, he opened a box, and, taking\r\ntherefrom a diamond thrice as large as any of mine, gave it to the slave\r\nthat was with me. \'What will become of me?\' I cried; \'I thought myself\r\nrich, and here I am, poor, and a stranger.\'\r\n\r\n"\'My child,\' replied Ali, \'Leave this casket with me, and I will give you\r\na price for it such as no one else would offer. Choose whatever you wish\r\nin Jidda, and in two hours I will give you an equal weight of what you\r\nhave chosen in exchange for your Indian stones.\'\r\n\r\n"On returning home, night brought reflection. I learned that Ali had been\r\ndeceiving me. What he had given to the slave was nothing but a bit of\r\ncrystal. I demanded my casket. Ali refused to restore it. Venerable\r\nmagistrate, my sole hope is in your justice."\r\n\r\nIt was now Ali\'s turn to speak. "Illustrious cadi," said he, "It is true\r\nthat we made a bargain, which I am ready to keep, The rest of the young\r\nman\'s story is false. What matters it what I gave the slave? Did I force\r\nthe stranger to leave the casket in my hands? Why does he accuse me of\r\ntreachery? Have I broken my word, and has he kept his?"\r\n\r\n"Young man," said the cadi to the Banian, "have you witnesses to prove\r\nthat Ali deceived you? If not, I shall put the accused on his oath, as the\r\nlaw decrees." A Koran was brought. Ali placed his hand on it, and swore\r\nthree times that he had not deceived the stranger. "Wretch," said the\r\nBanian, "thou art among those whose feet go down to destruction. Thou hast\r\nthrown away thy soul."\r\n\r\nOmar smiled, and while Ali was enjoying the success of his ruse, he\r\napproached the stranger, and asked, "Do you wish me to help you gain the\r\nsuit?" "Yes," was the reply; "but you are only a child--you can do\r\nnothing."\r\n\r\n"Have confidence in me a few moments," said Omar; "accept Ali\'s bargain;\r\nlet me choose in your stead, and fear nothing."\r\n\r\nThe stranger bowed his head, and murmured, "What can I fear after having\r\nlost all?" Then, turning to the cadi, and bowing respectfully, "Let the\r\nbargain be consummated," said he, "since the law decrees it, and let this\r\nyoung man choose in my stead what I shall receive in payment."\r\n\r\nA profound silence ensued. Omar rose, and, bowing to the cadi, "Ali," said\r\nhe to the jeweler, "you have doubtless brought the casket, and can tell us\r\nthe weight thereof."\r\n\r\n"Here it is," said Ali; "it weighs twenty pounds. Choose what you will; if\r\nthe thing asked for is in Jidda, you shall have it within two hours,\r\notherwise the bargain is null and void."\r\n\r\n"What we desire," said Omar, raising his voice, "is ants\' wings, half male\r\nand half female. You have two hours in which to furnish the twenty pounds\r\nyou have promised us." "This is absurd," cried the jeweler; "it is\r\nimpossible. I should need half a score of persons and six months labor to\r\nsatisfy so foolish a demand."\r\n\r\n"Are there any winged ants in Jidda?" asked the cadi. "Of course,"\r\nanswered the merchants, laughing; "they are one of the plagues of Egypt.\r\nOur houses are full of them, and it would be doing us a great service to\r\nrid us of them."\r\n\r\n"Then Ali must keep his promise or give back the casket," said the cadi.\r\n"This young man was mad to sell his diamonds weight for weight; he is mad\r\nto exact such payment. So much the better for Ali the first time: so much\r\nthe worse for him the second.  Justice has not two weights and measures.\r\nEvery bargain holds good before the law. Either furnish twenty pounds of\r\nants\' wings, or restore the casket to the Banian." "A righteous judgment,"\r\nshouted the spectators, wonder-struck at such equity.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: In front of a middle-eastern building; a man seated with a\r\nsword and water-pipe, facing a crowd. A small boy with his left arm\r\noutstreached, is speaking to the man. A taller young man stands to the\r\nright of the small boy; an older man stands further to the right.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe stranger, beside himself with joy, took from the casket three diamonds\r\nof the finest water; he forced them on Omar, who put them in his girdle,\r\nand seated himself by his father, his gravity unmoved by the gaze of the\r\nassembly. "Well done," said Mansour; "but it is my turn now; mark me well,\r\nand profit by the lesson I shall give you. Stop, young man!" he cried to\r\nthe Banian, "we have an account to settle."\r\n\r\n"The day before yesterday," continued he, "this young man entered my shop,\r\nand, bursting into tears, kissed my hand and entreated me to sell him a\r\nnecklace which I had already sold to the Pasha of Egypt, saying that his\r\nlife and that of a lady depended upon it. \'Ask of me what you will, my\r\nfather,\' said he, \'but I must have these gems or die.\'\r\n\r\n"I have a weakness for young men, and, though I knew the danger of\r\ndisappointing my master the pasha, I was unable to resist his\r\nsupplications. \'Take the necklace,\' said I to him, \'but promise to give\r\nwhatever I may ask in exchange.\' \'My head itself, if you will,\' he\r\nreplied, \'for you have saved my life,\' We were without witnesses, but,"\r\nadded Mansour, turning to the Banian, "is not my story true?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the young man, "and I beg your pardon for not having satisfied\r\nyou sooner: you know the cause. Ask of me what you desire."\r\n\r\n"What I desire," said Mansour, "is the casket with all its contents.\r\nIllustrious magistrate, you have declared that all bargains hold good\r\nbefore the law; this young man has promised to give me what I please; now\r\nI declare that nothing pleases me but these diamonds."\r\n\r\nThe cadi raised his head and looked about the assembly, as if to\r\ninterrogate the faces, then stroked his beard, and relapsed into his\r\nmeditations.\r\n\r\n"Ali is defeated," said the sheik to Omar, with a smile, "The fox is not\r\nyet born more cunning than the worthy Mansour."\r\n\r\n"I am lost!" cried the Banian. "O Omar, have you saved me only to cast me\r\ndown from the highest pinnacle of joy to the depths of despair? Persuade\r\nyour father to spare me, that I may owe my life to you a second time."\r\n\r\n"Well, my son," said Mansour, "doubtless you are shrewd, but this will\r\nteach you that your father knows rather more than you do. The cadi is\r\nabout to decide: try whether you can dictate his decree."\r\n\r\n"It is mere child\'s play," answered Omar, shrugging his shoulders; "but\r\nsince you desire it, my father, you shall lose your suit." He rose, and\r\ntaking a piaster from his girdle, put it into the hand of the Banian, who\r\nlaid it before the judge.\r\n\r\n"Illustrious cadi," said Omar, "this young man is ready to fulfill his\r\nengagement. This is what he offers Mansour--piaster. In itself this coin\r\nis of little value; but examine it closely, and you will see that it is\r\nstamped with the likeness of the sultan, our glorious master. May God\r\ndestroy and confound all who disobey his highness!\r\n\r\n"It is this precious likeness that we offer you," added he, turning to\r\nMansour; "if it pleases you, you are paid; to say that it displeases you\r\nis an insult to the pasha, a crime punishable by death; and I am sure that\r\nour worthy cadi will not become your accomplice--he who has always been\r\nand always will be the faithful servant of an the sultans."\r\n\r\nWhen Omar had finished speaking, all eyes turned toward the cadi, who,\r\nmore impenetrable than ever, stroked his face and waited for the old man\r\nto come to his aid. Mansour was agitated and embarrassed. The silence of\r\nthe cadi and the assembly terrified him, and he cast a supplicating glance\r\ntoward his son.\r\n\r\n"My father," said Omar, "permit this young man to thank you for the lesson\r\nof prudence which you have given him by frightening him a little. He knows\r\nwell that it was you who sent me to his aid, and that all this is a farce.\r\nNo one is deceived by hearing the son oppose the Father, and who has ever\r\ndoubted Mansour\'s experience and generosity?"\r\n\r\n"No one," interrupted the cadi, starting up like a man suddenly awakened\r\nfrom a dream, "and I least of all; and this is why I have permitted you to\r\nspeak, my young Solomon. I wished to honor in you the wisdom of your\r\nfather; but another time avoid meddling with his highness\'s name; it is\r\nnot safe to sport with the lion\'s paws. The matter is settled. The\r\nnecklace is worth a hundred thousand piasters, is it not, Mansour? This\r\nmadcap, shall give you, therefore, a hundred thousand piasters, and all\r\nparties will be satisfied."\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES--A cadi in the Mohammedan countries corresponds to our magistrate.\r\n\r\nA sheik among the Arabs and Moors, may mean simply an old man, or, as in\r\nthis case, a man of eminence.\r\n\r\nA Banian is a Hindoo merchant, particularly one who visits foreign\r\ncountries on business.\r\n\r\nJidda is a city in Arabia, on the Red Sea\r\n\r\nA pasha is the governor of a Turkish province.\r\n\r\nThe Turkish piaster was formerly worth twenty-five cents: it is now worth\r\nonly about eight cents.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXV. THANATOPSIS. (275)\r\n\r\nTo him who in the love of Nature holds\r\nCommunion with her visible forms, she speaks\r\nA various language: for his gayer hours\r\nShe has a voice  of gladness, and a smile\r\nAnd eloquence of beauty; and she glides\r\nInto his darker musings, with a mild\r\nAnd healing sympathy, that steals away\r\nTheir sharpness, ere he is aware.\r\n                             When thoughts\r\nOf the last hitter hour come like a blight\r\nOver thy spirit, and sad images\r\nOf the stern agony, and shroud, and pall,\r\nAnd breathless darkness, and the narrow house,\r\nMake thee to shudder, and grow sick at heart;--\r\nGo forth, under the open sky, and list\r\nTo Nature\'s teachings, while from all around--\r\nEarth and her waters, and the depths of air--\r\nComes a still voice,--\r\n\r\n                     Yet a few days, and thee\r\nThe all-beholding sun shall see no more\r\nIn all his course; nor yet in the cold ground,\r\nWhere thy pale form was laid, with many tears,\r\nNor in the embrace of ocean, shall exist\r\nThy image. Earth, that nourished thee, shall claim\r\nThy growth, to be resolved to earth again;\r\nAnd, lost each human trace, surrendering up\r\nThine individual being, shalt thou go\r\nTo mix forever with the elements;\r\nTo be a brother to the insensible rock\r\nAnd to the sluggish clod, which the rude swain\r\nTurns with his share, and treads upon. The oak\r\nShall send his roots abroad, and pierce thy mold.\r\n\r\n  Yet not to thine eternal resting place\r\nShalt thou retire alone, nor couldst thou wish\r\nCouch more magnificent. Thou shalt lie down\r\nWith patriarchs of the infant world,--with kings,\r\nThe powerful of the earth,--the wise, the good,\r\nFair forms, and hoary seers of ages past,--\r\nAll in one mighty sepulcher.\r\n\r\n                                 The hills,\r\nRock-ribbed, and ancient as the sun; the vales\r\nStretching in pensive quietness between;\r\nThe venerable woods; rivers that move\r\nIn majesty, and the complaining brooks,\r\nThat make the meadows green; and, poured round all,\r\nOld Ocean\'s gray and melancholy waste,--\r\nAre but the solemn decorations all\r\nOf the great tomb of man. The golden sun,\r\nThe planets, all the infinite host of heaven,\r\nAre shining on the sad abodes of death,\r\nThrough the still lapse of ages.\r\n\r\n                              All that tread\r\nThe globe are but a handful to the tribes\r\nThat slumber in its bosom. Take the wings\r\nOf morning, pierce the Barcan wilderness,\r\nOr lose thyself in the continuous woods\r\nWhere rolls the Oregon, and hears no sound\r\nSave his own dashings,--yet the dead are there:\r\nAnd millions in those solitudes, since first\r\nThe flight of years began, have laid them down\r\nIn their last sleep,--the dead reign there alone.\r\n\r\nSo shalt thou rest; and what if thou withdraw\r\nIn silence from the living, and no friend\r\nTake note of thy departure? All that breathe\r\nWill share thy destiny. The gay will laugh\r\nWhen thou art gone, the solemn brood of care\r\nPlod on, and each one as before will chase\r\nHis favorite phantom; yet all these shall leave\r\nTheir mirth and their employments, and shall come\r\nAnd make their bed with thee. As the long train\r\nOf ages glide away, the sons of men--\r\nThe youth in life\'s green spring, and he who goes\r\nIn the full strength of years, matron and maid,\r\nThe speechless babe, and the gray-headed man\r\nShall one by one be gathered to thy side\r\nBy those who in their turn shall follow them.\r\n\r\n  So live, that when thy summons comes to join\r\nThe innumerable caravan, which moves\r\nTo that mysterious realm, where each shall take\r\nHis chamber in the silent halls of death,\r\nThou go not, like the quarry slave at night,\r\nScourged to his dungeon, but, sustained and soothed\r\nBy an unfaltering trust, approach thy grave,\r\nLike one who wraps the drapery of his couch\r\nAbout him, and lies down to pleasant dreams.\r\n--Bryant.\r\n\r\nNOTES.--Thanatopsis is composed of two Greek words, thanatos, meaning\r\ndeath, and opsis, a view. The word, therefore, signifies a view of death,\r\nor reflections on death.\r\n\r\nBarca is in the northeastern part of Africa: the southern and eastern\r\nportions of the country are a barren desert.\r\n\r\nThe Oregon (or Columbia) River is the most important river of the United\r\nStates emptying into the Pacific. The Lewis and Clark Expedition\r\n(1803-1806) had first explored the country through which it flows only\r\nfive years before the poem was written.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXVI. INDIAN JUGGLERS. (278)\r\n\r\nWilliam Hazlitt, 1778-1830, was born in Maidstone, England. His father was\r\na Unitarian clergyman, and he was sent to a college of that denomination\r\nto be educated for the ministry; but having a greater taste for art than\r\ntheology, he resolved, on leaving school, to devote himself to painting.\r\nHe succeeded so well in his efforts as to meet the warmest commendation of\r\nhis friends, but did not succeed in satisfying his own fastidious taste.\r\nOn this account he threw away his pencil and took up his pen. His works,\r\nthough numerous, are, with the exception of a life of Napoleon, chiefly\r\ncriticisms on literature and art.\r\n\r\nHazlitt is thought to have treated his contemporaries with an unjust\r\nseverity; but his genial appreciation of the English classics, and the\r\nthorough and loving manner in which he discusses their merits, make his\r\nessays the delight of every lover of those perpetual wellsprings of\r\nintellectual pleasure. His "Table Talk," "Characters of Shakespeare\'s\r\nPlays," "Lectures on the English Poets," and "Lectures on the Literature\r\nof the Elizabethan Age," are the works that exhibit his style and general\r\nmerits in their most favorable light.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nComing forward and seating himself on the ground, in his white dress and\r\ntightened turban, the chief of the Indian jugglers begins with tossing up\r\ntwo brass balls, which is what any of us could do, and concludes by\r\nkeeping up four at the same time, which is what none of us could do to\r\nsave our lives, not if we were to take our whole lives to do it in.\r\n\r\nIs it then a trifling power we see at work, or is it not something next to\r\nmiraculous? It is the utmost stretch of human ingenuity, which nothing but\r\nthe bending the faculties of body and mind to it from the tenderest\r\ninfancy with incessant, ever-anxious application up to manhood, can\r\naccomplish or make even a slight approach to. Man, thou art a wonderful\r\nanimal, and thy ways past finding out! Thou canst do strange things, but\r\nthou turnest them to small account!\r\n\r\nTo conceive of this extraordinary dexterity, distracts the imagination and\r\nmakes admiration breathless. Yet it costs nothing to the performer, any\r\nmore than if it were a mere mechanical deception with which he had nothing\r\nto do, but to watch and laugh at the astonishment of the spectators. A\r\nsingle error of a hair\'s breadth, of the smallest conceivable portion of\r\ntime, would be fatal; the precision of the movements must be like a\r\nmathematical truth; their rapidity is like lightning.\r\n\r\nTo catch four balls in succession, in less than a second of time, and\r\ndeliver them back so as to return with seeming consciousness to the hand\r\nagain; to make them revolve around him at certain intervals, like the\r\nplanets in their spheres; to make them chase each other like sparkles of\r\nfire, or shoot up like flowers or meteors; to throw them behind his back,\r\nand twine them round his neck like ribbons, or like serpents; to do what\r\nappears an impossibility, and to do it with all the ease, the grace, the\r\ncarelessness imaginable; to laugh at, to play with the glittering\r\nmockeries, to follow them with his eye as if he could fascinate them with\r\nits lambent fire, or as if he had only to see that they kept time with the\r\nmusic on the stage--there is something in all this which he who does not\r\nadmire may be quite sure he never really admired anything in the whole\r\ncourse of his life. It is skill surmounting difficulty, and beauty\r\ntriumphing over skill. It seems as if the difficulty, once mastered,\r\nnaturally resolved itself into ease and grace, and as if, to be overcome\r\nat all, it must be overcome without an effort. The smallest awkwardness or\r\nwant of pliancy or self-possession would stop the whole process. It is the\r\nwork of witchcraft, and yet sport for children.\r\n\r\nSome of the other feats are quite as curious and wonderful--such as the\r\nbalancing the artificial tree, and shooting a bird from each branch\r\nthrough a quill--though none of them have the elegance or facility of the\r\nkeeping up of the brass balls. You are in pain for the result, and glad\r\nwhen the experiment is over; they are not accompanied with the same\r\nunmixed, unchecked delight as the former; and I would not give much to be\r\nmerely astonished without being pleased at the same time. As to the\r\nswallowing of the sword, the police ought to interfere to prevent it.\r\n\r\nWhen I saw the Indian juggler do the same things before, his feet were\r\nbare, and he had large rings on his toes, which he kept turning round all\r\nthe time of the performance, as if they moved of themselves.\r\n\r\nThe hearing a speech in Parliament drawled or stammered out by the\r\nhonorable member or the noble lord, the ringing the changes on their\r\ncommonplaces, which anyone could repeat after them as well as they, stirs\r\nme not a jot,--shakes not my good opinion of myself. I ask what there is\r\nthat I can do as well as this. Nothing. What have I been doing all my\r\nlife? Have I been idle, or have I nothing to show for all my labor and\r\npains? Or have I passed my time in pouring words like water into empty\r\nsieves, rolling a stone up a hill and then down again, trying to prove an\r\nargument in the teeth of facts, and looking for causes in the dark, and\r\nnot finding them? Is there no one thing in which I can challenge\r\ncompetition, that I can bring as an instance of exact perfection, in which\r\nothers can not find a flaw?\r\n\r\nThe utmost I can pretend to is to write a description of what this fellow\r\ncan do. I can write a book: so can many others who have not even learned\r\nto spell. What abortions are these essays! What errors, what ill-pieced\r\ntransitions, what crooked reasons, what lame conclusions! How little is\r\nmade out, and that little how ill! Yet they are the best I can do.\r\n\r\nI endeavor to recollect all I have ever heard or thought upon a subject,\r\nand to express it as neatly as I can. Instead of writing on four subjects\r\nat a time, it is as much as I can manage, to keep the thread of one\r\ndiscourse clear and unentangled. I have also time on my hands to correct\r\nmy opinions and polish my periods; but the one I can not, and the other I\r\nwill not, do. I am fond of arguing; yet, with a good deal of pains and\r\npractice, it is often much as I can do to beat my man, though he may be a\r\nvery indifferent hand. A common fencer would disarm his adversary in the\r\ntwinkling of an eye, unless he were a professor like himself. A stroke of\r\nwit will sometimes produce this effect, but there is no such power or\r\nsuperiority in sense or reasoning. There is no complete mastery of\r\nexecution to be shown there; and you hardly know the professor from the\r\nimpudent pretender or the mere clown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXVII. ANTONY OVER CAESAR\'S DEAD BODY. (281)\r\n\r\n           Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears:\r\n         I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.\r\n         The evil that men do lives after them;\r\n         The good is oft interred with their bones;\r\n         So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus\r\n         Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:\r\n         If it were so, it was a grievous fault,\r\n         And grievously hath Caesar answered it.\r\n         Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest--\r\n         For Brutus is an honorable man;\r\n         So are they all, all honorable men--\r\n         Come I to speak in Caesar\'s funeral.\r\n\r\n         He was my, friend, faithful and just to me:\r\n         But Brutus says he was ambitious;\r\n         And Brutus is an honorable man.\r\n         He hath brought many captives home to Rome,\r\n         Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:\r\n         Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?\r\n         When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:\r\n         Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:\r\n         Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;\r\n         And Brutus is an honorable man.\r\n\r\n         You all did see, that on the Lupercal,\r\n         I thrice presented him a kingly crown,\r\n         Which he did thrice refuse. Was this ambition?\r\n         Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;\r\n         And, sure, he is an honorable man.\r\n         I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,\r\n         But here I am to speak what I do know.\r\n         You all did love him once, not without cause;\r\n         What cause withholds you, then, to mourn for him?\r\n         O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,\r\n         And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;\r\n         My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,\r\n         And I must pause till it come back to me.\r\n\r\n         But yesterday the word of Caesar might\r\n         Have stood against the world; now lies he there,\r\n         And none so poor to do him reverence.\r\n         O masters! if I were disposed to stir\r\n         Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,\r\n         I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,\r\n         Who, you all know, are honorable men.\r\n         I will not do them wrong; I rather choose\r\n         To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,\r\n         Than I will wrong such honorable men.\r\n\r\n         But here\'s a parchment with the seal of Caesar;\r\n         I found it in his closet; \'t is his will:\r\n         Let but the commons hear this testament--\r\n         Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read--\r\n         And they would go and kiss dead Caesar\'s wounds,\r\n         And dip their napkins in his sacred blood;\r\n         Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,\r\n         And, dying, mention it within their wills,\r\n         Bequeathing it as a rich legacy\r\n         Unto their issue.\r\n\r\nCitizen. We\'ll hear the will: read it, Mark Antony.\r\nAll.     The will, the will; we will hear Caesar\'s will.\r\nAnt.     Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;\r\n         It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.\r\n         You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;\r\n         And, being men, hearing the will of Caesar,\r\n         It will inflame you, it will make you mad;\r\n         \'T is good you know not that you are his heirs;\r\n         For, if you should, Oh what would come of it!\r\nCit.     Read the will; we\'ll hear it, Antony;\r\n         You shall read the will, Caesar\'s will.\r\nAnt.     Will you be patient? Will you stay awhile?\r\n         I have o\'ershot myself to tell you of it:\r\n         I fear I wrong the honorable men\r\n         Whose daggers have stabbed Caesar. I do fear it.\r\nCit.     They were traitors: honorable men!\r\nAll.     The will! the testament!\r\nAnt.     You will compel me, then, to read the will?\r\n         Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar,\r\n         And let me show you him that made the will.\r\n\r\n                (He comes down from the pulpit.)\r\n\r\n         If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.\r\n         You all do know this mantle: I remember\r\n         The first time ever Caesar put it on;\r\n         \'T was on a summer\'s evening, in his tent,\r\n         That day he overcame the Nervii;\r\n         Look! in this place, ran Cassius\' dagger through:\r\n         See what a rent the envious Casca made:\r\n         Through this, the well belove\'d Brutus stabbed;\r\n         And, as he plucked his cursed steel away,\r\n         Mark how the blood of Caesar followed it,\r\n         As rushing out of doors, to be resolved\r\n         If Brutus so unkindly knocked, or no;\r\n         For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar\'s angel:\r\n         Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!\r\n\r\n         This was the most unkindest cut of all;\r\n         For, when the noble Caesar saw him stab,\r\n         Ingratitude, more strong than traitors\' arms,\r\n         Quite vanquished him: then burst his mighty heart;\r\n         And, in his mantle muffling up his face,\r\n         Even at the base of Pompey\'s statua,\r\n         Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.\r\n\r\n         Oh, what a fall was there, my countrymen!\r\n         Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,\r\n         Whilst bloody treason flourished over us.\r\n         Oh, now you weep; and, I perceive, you feel\r\n         The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.\r\n         Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold\r\n         Our Caesar\'s vesture wounded? Look you here,\r\n         Here is himself, marred, as you see, with traitors.\r\n1st Cit. O piteous spectacle!\r\n2d Cit.  O noble Caesar!\r\n3d Cit.  We will be revenged!\r\nAll.     Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire!\r\n         Kill! Slay! Let not a traitor live.\r\nAnt.     Stay, countrymen.\r\n1st Cit. Peace there! hear the noble Antony.\r\n2d Cit.  We\'ll hear him, we\'ll follow him, we\'ll die with him.\r\nAnt.     Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up\r\n         To such a sudden flood of mutiny.\r\n         They that have done this deed are honorable:\r\n         What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,\r\n         That made them do it; they are wise and honorable,\r\n         And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.\r\n\r\n         I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:\r\n         I am no orator, as Brutus is;\r\n         But, as you know me all, a plain, blunt man,\r\n         That love my friend; and that they know full well\r\n         That gave me public leave to speak of him:\r\n         For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,\r\n         Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,\r\n         To stir men\'s blood: I only speak right on:\r\n         I tell you that which you yourselves do know;\r\n         Show you sweet Caesar\'s wounds, poor, poor, dumb mouths,\r\n         And bid them speak for me: but were I Brutus,\r\n         And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony\r\n         Would ruffle up your spirits, and put a tongue\r\n         In every wound of Caesar, that should move\r\n         The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.\r\n\r\n                  Shakespeare.--Julius Caesar, Act iii, Scene ii.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--Gaius Julius Caesar (b. 102, d. 44 B. C.) was the most remarkable\r\ngenius of the ancient world, Caesar ruled Rome as imperator five years and\r\na half, and, in the intervals of seven campaigns during that time, spent\r\nonly fifteen months in Rome. Under his rule Rome was probably at her best,\r\nand his murder at once produced a state of anarchy.\r\n\r\nThe conspirators against Caesar--among whom were Brutus, Cassius and\r\nCasca--professed to be moved by honest zeal for the good of Rome; but\r\ntheir own ambition was no doubt the true motive, except with Brutus.\r\n\r\nMark Antony was a strong friend of Julius Caesar. Upon the latter\'s death,\r\nAntony, by his funeral oration, incited the people and drove the\r\nconspirators from Rome.\r\n\r\nThe Lupercal was a festival of purification and expiation held in Rome on\r\nthe 15th of February. Antony was officiating as priest at this festival\r\nwhen he offered the crown to Caesar.\r\n\r\nIn his will Caesar left to every citizen of Rome a sum of money, and\r\nbequeathed his private gardens to the public.\r\n\r\nThe Nervii were one of the most warlike tribes of Celtic Gaul. Caesar\r\nalmost annihilated them in 57 B. C.\r\n\r\nPompey, once associated with Caesar in the government of Rome, was\r\nafterwards at war with him. He was murdered by those who thought to\r\npropitiate Caesar, but the latter wept when Pompey\'s head was sent to him,\r\nand had the murderers put to death.\r\n\r\nStatua is the Latin form of statue, in common use in Shakespeare\'s time;\r\nthis form is required here by the meter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXVIII. THE ENGLISH CHARACTER. (286)\r\n\r\nWilliam Hickling Prescott, 1796-1859, the historian, was the son of\r\nWilliam Prescott, an eminent jurist, and the grandson of Col. William\r\nPrescott, who commanded the Americans at the battle of Bunker Hill. He was\r\nborn in Salem, Massachusetts, graduated at Harvard University in 1814, and\r\ndied in Boston. Just as he was completing his college course, the careless\r\nsport of a fellow-student injured one of his eyes so seriously that he\r\nnever recovered from it. He had intended to adopt law as his profession;\r\nbut, from his detective eyesight, he was obliged to choose work in which\r\nhe could regulate his hours of labor, and could employ the aid of a\r\nsecretary. He chose to be a historian; and followed his choice with\r\nwonderful system, perseverance, and success till the close of his life.\r\nHis works are: "The Reign of Ferdinand and Isabella," "The Conquest of\r\nMexico," "The Conquest of Peru," "The Reign of Philip II," and a volume of\r\n"Miscellanies." He had not completed the history of Philip at the time of\r\nhis death. As a writer of history, Mr. Prescott ranks with the first for\r\naccuracy, precision, clearness, and beauty of style. As a man, he was\r\ngenial, kind-hearted and even-tempered.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the whole, what I have seen raises my preconceived estimate of the\r\nEnglish character. It is full of generous, true, and manly qualities; and\r\nI doubt if there ever was so high a standard of morality in an aristocracy\r\nwhich has such means for self-indulgence at its command, and which\r\noccupies a position that secures it so much deference. In general, they do\r\nnot seem to abuse their great advantages. The respect for religion--at\r\nleast for the forms of it--is universal, and there are few, I imagine, of\r\nthe great proprietors who are not more or less occupied with improving\r\ntheir estates, and with providing for the comfort of their tenantry, while\r\nmany take a leading part in the great political movements of the time.\r\nThere never was an aristocracy which combined so much practical knowledge\r\nand industry with the advantages of exalted rank.\r\n\r\nThe Englishman is seen to most advantage in his country home. For he is\r\nconstitutionally both domestic and rural in his habits. His fireside and\r\nhis farm--these are the places in which one sees his simple and warm-\r\nhearted nature more freely unfolded. There is a shyness in an Englishman,\r\n--a natural reserve, which makes him cold to strangers, and difficult to\r\napproach. But once corner him in his own house, a frank and full expansion\r\nwill be given to his feelings that we should look for in vain in the\r\ncolder Yankee, and a depth not to be found in the light and superficial\r\nFrenchman,--speaking of nationalities, not of individualities.\r\n\r\nThe Englishman is the most truly rural in his tastes and habits of any\r\npeople in the world. I am speaking of the higher classes. The aristocracy\r\nof other countries affect the camp and the city. But the English love\r\ntheir old castles and country seats with a patriotic love. They are fond\r\nof country sports. Every man shoots or hunts. No man is too old to be in\r\nthe saddle some part of the day, and men of seventy years and more follow\r\nthe hounds, and, take a five-barred gate at a leap. The women are good\r\nwhips, are fond of horses and dogs, and other animals. Duchesses have\r\ntheir cows, their poultry, their pigs,--all watched over and provided with\r\naccommodations of Dutch-like neatness. All this is characteristic of the\r\npeople. It may be thought to detract something from the feminine graces\r\nwhich in other lands make a woman so amiably dependent as to be nearly\r\nimbecile. But it produces a healthy and blooming race of women to match\r\nthe hardy Englishman,--the finest development of the physical and moral\r\nnature which the world has witnessed. For we are not to look on the\r\nEnglish gentleman as a mere Nimrod. With all his relish for field sports\r\nand country usages, he has his house filled with collections of art and\r\nwith extensive libraries. The tables of the drawing-rooms are covered with\r\nthe latest works, sent down by the London publisher. Every guest is\r\nprovided with an apparatus for writing, and often a little library of\r\nbooks for his own amusement. The English country gentleman of the present\r\nday is anything but a Squire Western, though he does retain all his relish\r\nfor field sports.\r\n\r\nThe character of an Englishman, under its most refined aspect, has some\r\ndisagreeable points which jar unpleasantly on the foreigner not accustomed\r\nto them. The consciousness of national superiority, combined with natural\r\nfeelings of independence, gives him an air of arrogance, though it must be\r\nowned that this is never betrayed in his own house,--I may almost say in\r\nhis own country. But abroad, when he seems to institute a comparison\r\nbetween himself and the people he is thrown with, it becomes so obvious\r\nthat he is the most unpopular, not to say odious, person in the world.\r\nEven the open hand with which he dispenses his bounty will not atone for\r\nthe violence he offers to national vanity.\r\n\r\nThere are other defects, which are visible even in his most favored\r\ncircumstances. Such is his bigotry, surpassing everything in a quiet\r\npassive form, that has been witnessed since the more active bigotry of the\r\ntimes of the Spanish Philips. Such, too, is the exclusive, limited range\r\nof his knowledge and conceptions of all political and social topics and\r\nrelations. The Englishman, the cultivated Englishman, has no standard of\r\nexcellence borrowed from mankind. His speculation never travels beyond his\r\nown little--great little--island. That is the world to him. True, he\r\ntravels, shoots lions among the Hottentots, chases the grizzly bear over\r\nthe Rocky Mountains, kills elephants in India and salmon on the coast of\r\nLabrador, comes home, and very likely makes a book. But the scope of his\r\nideas does not seem to be enlarged by all this. The body travels, not the\r\nmind. And, however he may abuse his own land, he returns home as hearty a\r\nJohn Bull, with all his prejudices and national tastes as rooted, as\r\nbefore. The English--the men of fortune--all travel. Yet how little\r\nsympathy they show for other people or institutions, and how slight is the\r\ninterest they take in them! They are islanders, cut off from the great\r\nworld. But their island is, indeed, a world of its own. With all their\r\nfaults, never has the sun shone--if one may use the expression in\r\nreference to England--all a more noble race, or one that has done more for\r\nthe great interests of humanity.\r\n\r\nNOTES.--Nimrod is spoken of in Genesis (x. 9) as "a mighty hunter." Thus\r\nthe name came to be applied to any one devoted to hunting.\r\n\r\nSquire Western is a character in Fielding\'s "Tom Jones." He is represented\r\nas an ignorant, prejudiced, irascible, but, withal, a jolly, good-humored\r\nEnglish country gentleman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXIX. THE SONG OF THE POTTER. (290)\r\n\r\nTurn, turn, my wheel! Turn round and round,\r\nWithout a pause, without a sound:\r\n  So spins the flying world away!\r\nThis clay, well mixed with marl and sand,\r\nFollows the motion of my hand;\r\nFor some must follow, and some command,\r\n  Though all are made of clay!\r\n\r\nTurn, turn, my wheel! All things must change\r\nTo something new, to something strange;\r\n  Nothing that is can pause or stay;\r\nThe moon will wax, the moon will wane,\r\nThe mist and cloud will turn to rain,\r\nThe rain to mist and cloud again,\r\n  To-morrow be to-day.\r\n\r\nTurn, turn, my wheel! All life is brief;\r\nWhat now is bud will soon be leaf,\r\n  What now is leaf will soon decay;\r\nThe wind blows east, the wind blows west;\r\nThe blue eggs in the robin\'s nest\r\nWill soon have wings and beak and breast,\r\n  And flutter and fly away.\r\n\r\nTurn, turn, my wheel! This earthen jar\r\nA touch can make, a touch can mar;\r\n  And shall it to the Potter say,\r\nWhat makest thou? Thou hast no hand?\r\nAs men who think to understand\r\nA world by their Creator planned,\r\n  Who wiser is than they.\r\n\r\nTurn, turn, my wheel! \'Tis nature\'s plan\r\nThe child should grow into the man,\r\n  The man grow wrinkled, old, and gray;\r\nIn youth the heart exults and sings,\r\nThe pulses leap, the feet have wings;\r\nIn age the cricket chirps, and brings\r\n  The harvest home of day.\r\n\r\nTurn, turn, my wheel! The human race,\r\nOf every tongue, of every place,\r\n  Caucasian, Coptic, or Malay,\r\nAll that inhabit this great earth,\r\nWhatever be their rank or worth,\r\nAre kindred and allied by birth,\r\n  And made of the same clay.\r\n\r\nTurn, turn, my wheel! What is begun\r\nAt daybreak must at dark be done,\r\n  To-morrow will be another day;\r\nTo-morrow the hot furnace flame\r\nWill search the heart and try the frame,\r\nAnd stamp with honor or with shame\r\n  These vessels made of clay.\r\n\r\nStop, stop, my wheel! Too soon, too soon\r\nThe noon will be the afternoon,\r\n  Too soon to-day be yesterday;\r\nBehind us in our path we cast\r\nThe broken potsherds of the past,\r\nAnd all are ground to dust at last,\r\n  And trodden into clay.\r\n                                  --Longfellow.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--Coptic was formerly the language of Egypt. and is preserved in the\r\ninscriptions of the ancient monuments found there; it has now given place\r\nentirely to Arabic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXX. A HOT DAY IN NEW YORK. (292)\r\n\r\nWilliam Dean Howells, 1837--, was born in Belmont County. Ohio. In boyhood\r\nhe learned the printer\'s trade, at which he worked for several years. He\r\npublished a volume of poems in 1860, in connection with John J. Piatt.\r\nFrom 1861 to 1865 he was United States Consul at Venice. On his return he\r\nresided for a time in New York City, and was one of the editors of the\r\n"Nation." In 1871 he was appointed editor in chief of the "Atlantic\r\nMonthly." He held the position ten years, and then retired in order to\r\ndevote himself to his own writings. Since then, he has been connected with\r\nother literary magazines. Mr. Howells has written several books: novels\r\nand sketches: his writings are marked by an artistic finish, and a keen\r\nbut subtile humor. The following selection is an extract from "Their\r\nWedding Journey."\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen they alighted, they took their way up through one of the streets of\r\nthe great wholesale businesses, to Broadway. On this street was a throng\r\nof trucks and wagons, lading and unlading; bales and boxes rose and sank\r\nby pulleys overhead; the footway was a labyrinth of packages of every\r\nshape and size; there was no flagging of the pitiless energy that moved\r\nall forward, no sign of how heavy a weight lay on it, save in the reeking\r\nfaces of its helpless instruments.\r\n\r\nIt was four o\'clock, the deadliest hour of the deadly summer day. The\r\nspiritless air seemed to have a quality of blackness in it, as if filled\r\nwith the gloom of low-hovering wings. One half the street lay in shadow,\r\nand one half in sun; but the sunshine itself was dim, as if a heat greater\r\nthan its own had smitten it with languor. Little gusts of sick, warm wind\r\nblew across the great avenue at the corners of the intersecting streets.\r\nIn the upward distance, at which the journeyers looked, the loftier roofs\r\nand steeples lifted themselves dim out of the livid atmosphere, and far up\r\nand down the length of the street swept a stream of tormented life.\r\n\r\nAll sorts of wheeled things thronged it, conspicuous among which rolled\r\nand jarred the gaudily painted stages, with quivering horses driven each\r\nby a man who sat in the shade of a branching, white umbrella, and suffered\r\nwith a moody truculence of aspect, and as if he harbored the bitterness of\r\ndeath in his heart for the crowding passengers within, when one of them\r\npulled the strap about his legs, and summoned him to halt.\r\n\r\nMost of the foot passengers kept to the shady side, and to the\r\nunaccustomed eyes of the strangers they were not less in number than at\r\nany other time, though there were fewer women among them. Indomitably\r\nresolute of soul, they held their course with the swift pace of custom,\r\nand only here and there they showed the effect of the heat.\r\n\r\nOne man, collarless, with waistcoat unbuttoned, and hat set far back from\r\nhis forehead, waved a fan before his death-white, flabby face, and set\r\ndown one foot after the other with the heaviness of a somnambulist.\r\nAnother, as they passed him, was saying huskily to the friend at his side,\r\n"I can\'t stand this much longer. My hands tingle as if they had gone to\r\nsleep; my heart--" But still the multitude hurried on, passing, repassing,\r\nencountering, evading, vanishing into shop doors, and emerging from them,\r\ndispersing down the side streets, and swarming out of them.\r\n\r\nIt was a scene that possessed the beholder with singular fascination, and\r\nin its effect of universal lunacy, it might well have seemed the last\r\nphase of a world presently to be destroyed. They who were in it, but not\r\nof it, as they fancied--though there was no reason for this--looked on it\r\namazed, and at last their own errands being accomplished, and themselves\r\nso far cured of the madness of purpose, they cried with one voice that it\r\nwas a hideous sight, and strove to take refuge from it in the nearest\r\nplace where the soda fountain sparkled.\r\n\r\nIt was a vain desire. At the front door of the apothecary\'s hung a\r\nthermometer, and as they entered they heard the next comer cry out with a\r\nmaniacal pride in the affliction laid upon mankind, "Ninety-seven\r\ndegrees!" Behind them, at the door, there poured in a ceaseless stream of\r\npeople, each pausing at the shrine of heat, before he tossed off the\r\nhissing draught that two pale, close-clipped boys served them from either\r\nside of the fountain. Then, in the order of their coming, they issued\r\nthrough another door upon the side street, each, as he disappeared,\r\nturning his face half round, and casting a casual glance upon a little\r\ngroup near another counter.\r\n\r\nThe group was of a very patient, half-frightened, half-puzzled looking\r\ngentleman who sat perfectly still on a stool, and of a lady who stood\r\nbeside him, rubbing all over his head a handkerchief full of pounded ice,\r\nand easing one hand with the other when the first became tired. Basil\r\ndrank his soda, and paused to look upon this group, which he felt would\r\ncommend itself to realistic sculpture as eminently characteristic of the\r\nlocal life, and, as "The Sunstroke," would sell enormously in the hot\r\nseason.\r\n\r\n"Better take a little more of that," the apothecary said, looking up from\r\nhis prescription, and, as the organized sympathy of the seemingly\r\nindifferent crowd, smiling very kindly at his patient, who thereupon\r\ntasted something in the glass he held.\r\n\r\n"Do you still feel like fainting?" asked the humane authority. "Slightly,\r\nnow and then," answered the other, "but I\'m hanging on hard to the bottom\r\ncurve of that icicled S on your soda fountain, and I feel that I\'m all\r\nright as long as I can see that. The people get rather hazy occasionally,\r\nand have no features to speak of. But I do n\'t know that I look very\r\nimpressive myself," he added in the jesting mood which seems the natural\r\ncondition of Americans in the face of an embarrassments.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you\'ll do!" the apothecary answered, with a laugh; but he said, in an\r\nanswer to an anxious question from the lady, "He mustn\'t be moved for an\r\nhour yet," and gayly pestled away at a prescription, while she resumed her\r\noffice of grinding the pounded ice round and round upon her husband\'s\r\nskull. Isabel offered her the commiseration of friendly words, and of\r\nlooks kinder yet, and then, seeing that they could do nothing, she and\r\nBasil fell into the endless procession, and passed out of the side door.\r\n\r\n"What a shocking thing," she whispered. "Did you see how all the people\r\nlooked, one after another, so indifferently at that couple, and evidently\r\nforgot them the next instant? It was dreadful. I should n\'t like to have\r\nyou sun-struck in New York."\r\n\r\n"That\'s very considerate of you; but place for place, if any accident must\r\nhappen to me among strangers, I think I should prefer to have it in New\r\nYork. The biggest place is always the kindest as well as the cruelest\r\nplace. Amongst the thousands of spectators the good Samaritan as well as\r\nthe Levite would be sure to be. As for a sunstroke, it requires peculiar\r\ngifts. But if you compel me to a choice in the matter, then I say give me\r\nthe busiest part of Broadway for a sunstroke. There is such experience of\r\ncalamity there that you could hardly fall the first victim to any\r\nmisfortune."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXI. DISCONTENT.--AN ALLEGORY. (295)\r\n\r\nJoseph Addison, 1672-1719, the brilliant essayist and poet, has long\r\noccupied an exalted place in English literature. He was the son of an\r\nEnglish clergyman, was born in Wiltshire, and educated at Oxford; he died\r\nat "Holland House" (the property of his wile, to whom he had been married\r\nbut about two years), and was buried in Westminster Abbey. Several years\r\nof his life were spent in the political affairs of his time, he held\r\nseveral public offices, and was, for ten years, a member of Parliament.\r\nHis fame as an author rests chiefly upon his "Hymns," his tragedy of\r\n"Cato," and his "Essays" contributed principally to the "Tatler" and the\r\n"Spectator." The excellent style of his essays, their genial wit and\r\nsprightly humor, made them conspicuous in an age when coarseness,\r\nbitterness, and exaggeration deformed the writings of the most eminent:\r\nand these characteristics have given them an unquestioned place among the\r\nclassics of our language.\r\n\r\nMr. Addison was shy and diffident, but genial and lovable; his moral\r\ncharacter was above reproach, excepting that he is said to have been too\r\nfond of wine.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a celebrated thought of Socrates, that if all the misfortunes of\r\nmankind were cast into a public stock, in order to be equally distributed\r\namong the whole species, those who now think themselves the most unhappy,\r\nwould prefer the share they are already possessed of before that which\r\nwould fall to them by such a division. Horace has carried this thought a\r\ngreat deal farther, and supposes that the hardships or misfortunes we lie\r\nunder, are more easy to us than those of any other person would be, in\r\ncase we could change conditions with him.\r\n\r\nAs I was ruminating on these two remarks, and seated in my elbowchair, I\r\ninsensibly fell asleep; when, on a sudden, methought there was a\r\nproclamation made by Jupiter, that every mortal should bring in his griefs\r\nand calamities, and throw them together in a heap. There was a large plain\r\nappointed for this purpose. I took my stand in the center of it, and saw,\r\nwith a great deal of pleasure, the whole human species marching one after\r\nanother, and throwing down their several loads, which immediately grew up\r\ninto a prodigious mountain, that seemed to rise above the clouds.\r\n\r\nThere was a certain lady of a thin, airy shape, who was very active in\r\nthis solemnity. She carried a magnifying glass in one of her hands, and\r\nwas clothed in a loose, flowing robe, embroidered with several figures of\r\nfiends and specters, that discovered themselves in a thousand chimerical\r\nshapes as her garment hovered in the wind. There was something wild and\r\ndistracted in her looks. Her name was Fancy. She led up every mortal to\r\nthe appointed place, after having officiously assisted him in making up\r\nhis pack, and laying it upon his shoulders. My heart melted within me to\r\nsee my fellow-creatures groaning under their respective burdens, and to\r\nconsider that prodigious bulk of human calamities which lay before me.\r\n\r\nThere were, however, several persons who gave me great diversion upon this\r\noccasion. I observed one bringing in a  fardel, very carefully concealed\r\nunder an old embroidered cloak, which, upon his throwing it into the heap,\r\nI discovered to be poverty. Another, after a great deal of puffing, threw\r\ndown his luggage, which, upon examining, I found to be his wife.\r\n\r\nThere were multitudes of lovers saddled with very whimsical burdens,\r\ncomposed of darts and flames; but, what was very odd, though they sighed\r\nas if their hearts would break under these bundles of calamities, they\r\ncould not persuade themselves to cast them into the heap, when they came\r\nup to it; but, after a few faint efforts, shook their heads, and marched\r\naway as heavy loaden as they came.\r\n\r\nI saw multitudes of old women throw down their wrinkles, and several young\r\nones who stripped themselves of a tawny skin. There were very great heaps\r\nof red noses, large lips, and rusty teeth. The truth of it is, I was\r\nsurprised to see the greatest part of the mountain made up of bodily\r\ndeformities. Observing one advancing toward the heap with a larger cargo\r\nthan ordinary upon his back, I found, upon his near approach, that it was\r\nonly a natural hump, which he disposed of with great joy of heart among\r\nthis collection of human miseries.\r\n\r\nThere were, likewise, distempers of all sorts, though I could not but\r\nobserve that there were many more imaginary than real. One little packet I\r\ncould not but take notice of, which was a complication of all the diseases\r\nincident to human nature, and was in the hand of a great many fine people.\r\nThis was called the spleen. But what most of all surprised me was, that\r\nthere was not a single vice or folly thrown into the whole heap: at which\r\nI was very much astonished, having concluded within myself that everyone\r\nwould take this opportunity of getting rid of his passions, prejudices,\r\nand frailties.\r\n\r\nI took notice in particular of a very profligate fellow, who, I did not\r\nquestion, came loaden with his crimes, but upon searching into his bundle,\r\nI found that instead of throwing his guilt from him, he had only laid down\r\nhis memory. He was followed by another worthless rogue, who flung away his\r\nmodesty instead of his ignorance.\r\n\r\nWhen the whole race of mankind had thus cast their burdens, the phantom\r\nwhich had been so busy on this occasion, seeing me an idle spectator of\r\nwhat passed, approached toward me. I grew uneasy at her presence, when, of\r\na sudden, she held her magnifying glass full before my eyes. I no sooner\r\nsaw my face in it, but was startled at the shortness of it, which now\r\nappeared to me in its utmost aggravation. The immoderate breadth of the\r\nfeatures made me very much out of humor with my own countenance, upon\r\nwhich I threw it from me like a mask. It happened very luckily that one\r\nwho stood by me had just before thrown down his visage, which, it seems,\r\nwas too long for him. It was, indeed, extended to a most shameful length;\r\nI believe the very chin was, modestly speaking, as long as my whole face.\r\nWe had both of us an opportunity of mending ourselves; and all the\r\ncontributions being now brought in, every man was at liberty to exchange\r\nhis misfortunes for those of another person.\r\n\r\nAs we stood round the heap, and surveyed the several materials of which it\r\nwas composed, there was scarcely a mortal in this vast multitude who did\r\nnot discover what he thought pleasures and blessings of life, and wondered\r\nhow the owners of them ever came to look upon them as burthens and\r\ngrievances. As we were regarding very attentively this confusion of\r\nmiseries, this chaos of calamity, Jupiter issued out a second\r\nproclamation, that everyone was now at liberty to exchange his affliction,\r\nand to return to his habitation with any such other bundle as should be\r\ndelivered to him. Upon this, Fancy began again to bestir herself, and,\r\nparceling out the whole heap with incredible activity, recommended to\r\neveryone his particular packet. The hurry and confusion at this time was\r\nnot to be expressed. Some observations, which I made upon the occasion, I\r\nshall communicate to the public.\r\n\r\nA venerable, gray-headed man, who had laid down the colic, and who, I\r\nfound, wanted an heir to his estate, snatched up an undutiful son that had\r\nbeen thrown into the heap by an angry father. The graceless youth, in less\r\nthan a quarter of an hour, pulled the old gentleman by the beard, and had\r\nliked to have knocked his brains out; so that meeting the true father, who\r\ncame toward him with a fit of the gripes, he begged him to take his son\r\nagain, and give him back his colic; but they were incapable, either of\r\nthem, to recede from the choice they had made. A poor galley slave, who\r\nhad thrown down his chains, took up the gout in their stead, but made such\r\nwry faces that one might easily perceive he was no great gainer by the\r\nbargain.\r\n\r\nThe female world were very busy among themselves in bartering for\r\nfeatures; one was trucking a lock of gray hairs for a carbuncle; and\r\nanother was making over a short waist for a pair of round shoulders; but\r\non all these occasions there was not one of them who did not think the new\r\nblemish, as soon as she had got it into her possession, much more\r\ndisagreeable than the old one.\r\n\r\nI must not omit my own particular adventure. My friend with the long\r\nvisage had no sooner taken upon him my short face, but he made such a\r\ngrotesque figure in it, that as I looked upon him, I could not forbear\r\nlaughing at myself, insomuch that I put my own face out of countenance.\r\nThe poor gentleman was so sensible of the ridicule, that I found he was\r\nashamed of what he had done. On the other side, I found that I myself had\r\nno great reason to triumph, for as I went to touch my forehead, I missed\r\nthe place, and clapped my finger upon my upper lip. Besides, as my nose\r\nwas exceedingly prominent, I gave it two or three unlucky knocks as I was\r\nplaying my hand about my face, and aiming at some other part of it.\r\n\r\nI saw two other gentlemen by me who were in the same ridiculous\r\ncircumstances. These had made a foolish swap between a couple of thick\r\nbandy legs and two long trapsticks that had no calves to them. One of\r\nthese looked like a man walking upon stilts, and was so lifted up into the\r\nair, above his ordinary height, that his head turned round with it, while\r\nthe other made such awkward circles, as he attempted to walk, that he\r\nscarcely knew how to move forward upon his new supporters. Observing him\r\nto be a pleasant kind of a fellow, I stuck my cane in the ground, and told\r\nhim I would lay him a bottle of wine that he did not march up to it on a\r\nline that I drew for him, in a quarter of an hour.\r\n\r\nThe heap was at last distributed among the two sexes, who made a most\r\npiteous sight, as they wandered up and down under the pressure of their\r\nseveral burthens. The whole plain was filled with murmurs and complaints,\r\ngroans and lamentations. Jupiter, at length taking compassion on the poor\r\nmortals, ordered them a second time to lay down their loads, with a design\r\nto give everyone his own again. They discharged themselves with a great\r\ndeal of pleasure; after which, the phantom who had led them into such\r\ngross delusions, was commanded to disappear. There was sent in her stead a\r\ngoddess of a quite different figure: her motions were steady and composed,\r\nand her aspect serious but cheerful. She every now and then cast her eyes\r\ntoward heaven, and fixed them upon Jupiter. Her name was Patience. She had\r\nno sooner placed herself by the Mount of Sorrows, but, what I thought very\r\nremarkable, the whole heap sunk to such a degree that it did not appear a\r\nthird part so big as it was before. She afterward returned every man his\r\nown proper calamity, and, teaching him how to bear it in the most\r\ncommodious manner, he marched off with it contentedly, being very well\r\npleased that he had not been left to his own choice as to the kind of evil\r\nwhich fell to his lot.\r\n\r\nBeside the several pieces of morality to be drawn out of this vision, I\r\nlearnt from it never to repine at my own misfortunes, or to envy the\r\nhappiness of another, since it is impossible for any man to form a right\r\njudgment of his neighbor\'s sufferings; for which reason, also, I have\r\ndetermined never to think too lightly of another\'s complaints, but to\r\nregard the sorrows of my fellow-creatures with sentiments of humanity and\r\ncompassion.\r\n\r\nNOTES.--Horace (b. 65, d. 8 B. C.) was a celebrated Roman poet.\r\n\r\nJupiter, according to mythology, was the greatest of the Greek and Roman\r\ngods; he was thought to be the supreme ruler of both mortals and\r\nimmortals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXII. JUPITER AND TEN. (301)\r\n\r\nJames T. Fields, 1817-1881, was born at Portsmouth, New Hampshire. For\r\nmany years he was partner in the well-known firm of Ticknor & Fields\r\n(Later Fields, Osgood & Co.), the leading publishers of standard American\r\nliterature. For eight years, he was chief editor of the "Atlantic\r\nMonthly;" and, after he left that position, he often enriched its pages by\r\nthe productions of his pen. During his latter years Mr. Fields gained some\r\nreputation as a lecturer. His literary abilities were of no mean order:\r\nbut he did not do so much in producing literature himself, as in aiding\r\nothers in its production.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nMrs. Chub was rich and portly,\r\n  Mrs. Chub was very grand,\r\nMrs. Chub was always reckoned\r\n  A lady in the land.\r\n\r\nYou shall see her marble mansion\r\n  In a very stately square,--\r\nMr. C. knows what it cost him,\r\n  But that\'s neither here nor there.\r\n\r\nMrs. Chub was so sagacious,\r\n  Such a patron of the arts,\r\nAnd she gave such foreign orders\r\n  That she won all foreign hearts.\r\n\r\nMrs. Chub was always talking,\r\n  When she went away from home,\r\nOf a most prodigious painting\r\n  Which had just arrived from Rome.\r\n\r\n"Such a treasure," she insisted,\r\n  "One might never see again!"\r\n"What\'s the subject?" we inquired.\r\n  "It is Jupiter and Ten!"\r\n\r\n"Ten what?" we blandly asked her\r\n  For the knowledge we did lack,\r\n"Ah! that I can not tell you,\r\n  But the name is on the back.\r\n\r\n"There it stands in printed letters,--\r\n  Come to-morrow, gentlemen,--\r\nCome and see our splendid painting,\r\n  Our fine Jupiter and Ten!"\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Chub departed,\r\n  Our brains began to rack,--\r\nShe could not be mistaken\r\n  For the name was on the back.\r\n\r\nSo we begged a great Professor\r\n  To lay aside his pen,\r\nAnd give some information\r\n  Touching "Jupiter and Ten."\r\n\r\nAnd we pondered well the subject,\r\n  And our Lempriere we turned,\r\nTo find out who the Ten were;\r\n  But we could not, though we burned.\r\n\r\nBut when we saw the picture,--\r\n  O Mrs. Chub! Oh, fie! O!\r\nWe perused the printed label,\r\n  And \'t was JUPITER AND IO!\r\n\r\nNOTES.--John Lempriere, an Englishman, was the author of a "Classical\r\nDictionary" which until the middle of the present century was the chief\r\nbook of reference on ancient mythology.\r\n\r\nIo is a mythical heroine of Greece, with whom Jupiter was enamored.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXIII. SCENE FROM "THE POOR GENTLEMAN."\r\n\r\nGeorge Colman, 1762-1836, was the son of George Colman, a writer of\r\ndramas, who in 1777 purchased the "Haymarket Theater," in London. Owing to\r\nthe illness of the father, Colman the younger assumed the management of\r\nthe theater in 1785, which post he held for a long time. He was highly\r\ndistinguished as a dramatic author and wit. "The Poor Gentleman," from\r\nwhich the following selection is adapted, is perhaps the best known of his\r\nworks.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR ROBERT BRAMBLE and HUMPHREY DOBBINS.\r\n\r\nSir R. I\'ll tell you what, Humphrey Dobbins, there is not a syllable of\r\nsense in all you have been saying. But I suppose you will maintain there\r\nis.\r\n\r\nHum. Yes.\r\n\r\nSir R. Yes! Is that the way you talk to me, you old boor? What\'s my name?\r\n\r\nHum. Robert Bramble.\r\n\r\nSir R. An\'t I a baronet? Sir Robert Bramble, of Blackberry Hall, in the\r\ncounty of Kent? \'T is time you should know it, for you have been my\r\nclumsy, two-fisted valet these thirty years: can you deny that?\r\n\r\nHum. Hem!\r\n\r\nSir R. Hem? What do you mean by hem? Open that rusty door of your mouth,\r\nand make your ugly voice walk out of it. Why don\'t you answer my question?\r\n\r\n\r\nHum. Because, if I contradict you, I shall tell you a lie, and whenever I\r\nagree with you, you are sure to fall out.\r\n\r\nSir R. Humphrey Dobbins. I have been so long endeavoring to beat a few\r\nbrains into your pate that all your hair has tumbled off before my point\r\nis carried.\r\n\r\nHum. What then? Our parson says my head is an emblem of both our honors.\r\n\r\nSir R. Ay; because honors, like your head, are apt to be empty.\r\n\r\nHum. No; but if a servant has grown bald under his master\'s nose, it looks\r\nas if there was honesty on one side, and regard for it on the other.\r\n\r\nSir R. Why, to be sure, old Humphrey, you are as honest as a--pshaw! the\r\nparson means to palaver us; but, to return to my position, I tell you I do\r\nn\'t like your flat contradiction.\r\n\r\nHum. Yes, you do.\r\n\r\nSir R. I tell you I don\'t. I only love to hear men\'s arguments. I hate\r\ntheir flummery.\r\n\r\nHum. What do you call flummery?\r\n\r\nSir R. Flattery, blockhead! a dish too often served up by paltry poor men\r\nto paltry rich ones.\r\n\r\nHum. I never serve it up to you.\r\n\r\nSir R. No, you give me a dish of a different description.\r\n\r\nHum. Hem! what is it?\r\n\r\nSir R. Sauerkraut, you old crab\r\n\r\nHum. I have held you a stout tug at argument this many a year.\r\n\r\nSir R. And yet I could never teach you a syllogism. Now mind, when a poor\r\nman assents to what a rich man says, I suspect he means to flatter him:\r\nnow I am rich, and hate flattery. Ergo--when a poor man subscribes to my\r\nopinion, I hate him.\r\n\r\nHum. That\'s wrong.\r\n\r\nSir R. Very well; negatur; now prove it.\r\n\r\nHum. Put the case then, I am a poor man.\r\n\r\nSir R. You an\'t, you scoundrel. You know you shall never want while I have\r\na shilling.\r\n\r\nHum. Bless you!\r\n\r\nSir R. Pshaw! Proceed.\r\n\r\nHum. Well, then, I am a poor--I must be a poor man now, or I never shall\r\nget on.\r\n\r\nSir R. Well, get on, be a poor man.\r\n\r\nHum. I am a poor man, and I argue with you, and convince you, you are\r\nwrong; then you call yourself a blockhead, and I am of your opinion: now,\r\nthat\'s no flattery.\r\n\r\nSir R. Why, no; but when a man\'s of the same opinion with me, he puts an\r\nend to the argument, and that puts an end to the conversation, and so I\r\nhate him for that. But where\'s my nephew Frederic?\r\n\r\nHum. Been out these two hours.\r\n\r\nSir R. An undutiful cub! Only arrived from Russia last night, and though I\r\ntold him to stay at home till I rose, he\'s scampering over the fields like\r\na Calmuck Tartar.\r\n\r\nHum. He\'s a fine fellow.\r\n\r\nSir R. He has a touch of our family. Don\'t you think he is a little like\r\nme, Humphrey?\r\n\r\nHum. No, not a bit; you are as ugly an old man as ever I clapped my eyes\r\non.\r\n\r\nSir R. Now that\'s plaguy impudent, but there\'s no flattery in it, and it\r\nkeeps up the independence of argument. His father, my brother Job, is of\r\nas tame a spirit--Humphrey, you remember my brother Job?\r\n\r\nHum. Yes, you drove him to Russia five and twenty years ago.\r\n\r\nSir R. I did not drive him.\r\n\r\nHum. Yes, you did. You would never let him be at peace in the way of\r\nargument.\r\n\r\nSir R. At peace! Zounds, he would never go to war.\r\n\r\nHum. He had the merit to be calm.\r\n\r\nSir R. So has a duck pond. He was a bit of still life; a chip; weak water\r\ngruel; a tame rabbit, boiled to rags, without sauce or salt. He received\r\nmy arguments with his mouth open, like a poorbox gaping for half-pence,\r\nand, good or bad, he swallowed them all without any resistance. We could\r\nn\'t disagree, and so we parted.\r\n\r\nHum. And the poor, meek gentleman went to Russia for a quiet life.\r\n\r\nSir R. A quiet life! Why, he married the moment he got there, tacked\r\nhimself to the shrew relict of a Russian merchant, and continued a\r\nspeculation with her in furs, flax, potashes, tallow, linen, and leather;\r\nwhat\'s the consequence? Thirteen months ago he broke.\r\n\r\nHum. Poor soul, his wife should have followed the business for him. Sir R.\r\nI fancy she did follow it, for she died just as he broke, and now this\r\nmadcap, Frederic, is sent over to me for protection. Poor Job, now he is\r\nin distress, I must not neglect his son.\r\n\r\nHum. Here comes his son; that\'s Mr. Frederic.\r\n\r\n   Enter FREDERIC.\r\n\r\nFred. Oh, my dear uncle, good morning! Your park is nothing but beauty.\r\n\r\nSir R. Who bid you caper over my beauty? I told you to stay in doors till\r\nI got up.\r\n\r\nFred. So you did, but I entirely forgot it.\r\n\r\nSir R. And pray, what made you forget it?\r\n\r\nFred. The sun.\r\n\r\nSir R. The sun! he\'s mad; you mean the moon, 1 believe.\r\n\r\nFred. Oh, my dear uncle, you don\'t know the effect of a fine spring\r\nmorning upon a fellow just arrived from Russia. The day looked bright,\r\ntrees budding, birds singing, the park was so gay that I took a leap out\r\nof your old balcony, made your deer fly before me like the wind, and\r\nchased them all around the park to get an appetite for breakfast, while\r\nyou were snoring in bed, uncle.\r\n\r\nSir R. Oh, oh! So the effect of English sunshine upon a Russian, is to\r\nmake him jump out of a balcony, and worry my deer.\r\n\r\nFred. I confess it had that influence upon me.\r\n\r\nSir R. You had better be influenced by a rich old uncle, unless you think\r\nthe sun likely to leave you a fat legacy.\r\n\r\nFred. I hate legacies.\r\n\r\nSir R. Sir, that\'s mighty singular. They are pretty solid tokens, at\r\nleast.\r\n\r\nFred. Very melancholy tokens, uncle; they are the posthumous dispatches\r\nAffection sends to Gratitude, to inform us we have lost a gracious friend.\r\n\r\nSir R. How charmingly the dog argues!\r\n\r\nFred. But I own my spirits ran away with me this morning. I will obey you\r\nbetter in future; for they tell me you are a very worthy, good sort of old\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\nSir R. Now who had the familiar impudence to tell you that? Fred. Old\r\nrusty, there.\r\n\r\nSir R. Why Humphrey, you didn\'t?\r\n\r\nHum. Yes, but I did though.\r\n\r\nFred, Yes, he did, and on that score I shall be anxious to show you\r\nobedience, for \'t is as meritorious to attempt sharing a good man\'s heart,\r\nas it is paltry to have designs upon a rich man\'s money. A noble nature\r\naims its attentions full breast high, uncle; a mean mind levels its dirty\r\nassiduities at the pocket.\r\n\r\nSir R. (Shaking him by the hand.) Jump out of every window I have in my\r\nhouse; hunt my deer into high fevers, my fine fellow! Ay, that\'s right.\r\nThis is spunk, and plain speaking. Give me a man who is always flinging\r\nhis dissent to my doctrines smack in my teeth.\r\n\r\nFred. I disagree with you there, uncle.\r\n\r\nHum. And so do I.\r\n\r\nFred. You! you forward puppy! If you were not so old, I\'d knock you down.\r\n\r\nSir R. I\'ll knock you down, if you do. I won\'t have my servants thumped\r\ninto dumb flattery.\r\n\r\nHum. Come, you are ruffled. Let us go to the business of the morning.\r\n\r\nSir R. I hate the business of the morning. Don\'t you see we are engaged in\r\ndiscussion. I tell you, I hate the business of the morning.\r\n\r\nHum. No you don\'t.\r\n\r\nSir R. Don\'t I? Why not?\r\n\r\nHum. Because \'t is charity.\r\n\r\nSir R. Pshaw! Well, we must not neglect the business, if there be any\r\ndistress in the parish. Read the list, Humphrey.\r\n\r\nHum. (Taking out a paper and reading.) "Jonathan Huggins, of Muck Mead, is\r\nput in prison for debt."\r\n\r\nSir R. Why, it was only last week that Gripe, the attorney, recovered two\r\ncottages for him by law, worth sixty pounds.\r\n\r\nHum. Yes, and charged a hundred for his trouble; so seized the cottages\r\nfor part of his bill, and threw Jonathan into jail for the remainder.\r\n\r\nSir R. A harpy! I must relieve the poor fellow\'s distress.\r\n\r\nFred. And I must kick his attorney.\r\n\r\nHum. (Reading.) "The curate\'s horse is dead."\r\n\r\nSir R. Pshaw! There\'s no distress in that.\r\n\r\nHum. Yes, there is, to a man that must go twenty miles every Sunday to\r\npreach three sermons, for thirty pounds a year.\r\n\r\nSir R. Why won\'t the vicar give him another nag?\r\n\r\nHum. Because \'t is cheaper to get another curate ready mounted.\r\n\r\nSir R. Well, send him the black pad which I purchased last Tuesday, and\r\ntell him to work him as long as he lives. What else have we upon the list?\r\n\r\nHum. Something out of the common; there\'s one Lieutenant Worthington, a\r\ndisabled officer and a widower, come to lodge at Farmer Harrowby\'s, in the\r\nvillage; he is, it seems, very poor, and more proud than poor, and more\r\nhonest than proud.\r\n\r\nSir R. And so he sends to me for assistance? Hum. He\'d see you hanged\r\nfirst! No, he\'d sooner die than ask you or any man for a shilling! There\'s\r\nhis daughter, and his wife\'s aunt, and an old corporal that served in the\r\nwars with him, he keeps them all upon his half pay.\r\n\r\nSir R. Starves them all, I\'m afraid, Humphrey.\r\n\r\nFred. (Going.) Good morning, uncle.\r\n\r\nSir R. You rogue, where are you running now?\r\n\r\nFred. To talk with Lieutenant Worthington.\r\n\r\nSir R. And what may you be going to say to him?\r\n\r\nFred. I can\'t tell till I encounter him; and then, uncle, when I have an\r\nold gentleman by the hand, who has been disabled in his country\'s service,\r\nand is struggling to support his motherless child, a poor relation, and a\r\nfaithful servant, in honorable indigence, impulse will supply me with\r\nwords to express my sentiments.\r\n\r\nSir R. Stop, you rogue; I must be before you in this business.\r\n\r\nFred. That depends on who can run the fastest; so, start fair, uncle, and\r\nhere goes.--(Runs out.)\r\n\r\nSir R. Stop, stop; why, Frederic--a jackanapes--to take my department out\r\nof my hands! I\'ll disinherit the dog for his assurance.\r\n\r\nHum. No, you won\'t.\r\n\r\nSir R. Won\'t I? Hang me if I--but we\'ll argue that point as we go. So,\r\ncome along Humphrey.\r\n\r\nNOTES.-Ergo (pro. er\'go) is a Latin word meaning therefore.

(310)\r\n\r\nWilliam Cowper, 1731-1800, was the son of an English clergyman; both his\r\nparents were descended from noble families. He was always of a gentle,\r\ntimid disposition; and the roughness of his schoolfellows increased his\r\nweakness in this respect. He studied law, and was admitted to the bar, but\r\nnever practiced his profession. When he was about thirty years of age, he\r\nwas appointed to a clerkship in the House of Lords, but could not summon\r\ncourage to enter upon the discharge of its duties. He was so disturbed by\r\nthis affair that he became insane, sought to destroy himself, and had to\r\nbe consigned to a private asylum. Soon after his recovery, he found a\r\ncongenial home in the family of the Rev. Mr. Unwin. On the death of this\r\ngentleman, a few years later, he continued to reside with his widow till\r\nher death, a short time before that of Cowper. Most of this time their\r\nhome was at Olney. His first writings were published in 1782. He wrote\r\nseveral beautiful hymns, "The Task," and some minor poems. These, with his\r\ntranslations of Homer and his correspondence, make up his published works.\r\nHis life was always pure and gentle; he took great pleasure in simple,\r\nnatural objects, and in playing with animals. His insanity returned from\r\ntime to time, and darkened his life at its close. When six years of age,\r\nhe lost his mother; and the following selection is part of a touching\r\ntribute to her memory, written many years later.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nOh that those lips had language! Life has passed\r\nWith me but roughly since I heard them last.\r\nMy mother, when I learned that thou wast dead,\r\nSay, wast thou conscious of the tears I shed?\r\nHovered thy spirit o\'er thy sorrowing son,\r\nWretch even then, life\'s journey just begun?\r\nPerhaps thou gavest me, though unfelt, a kiss,\r\nPerhaps a tear, if souls can weep in bliss.\r\nAh, that maternal smile! it answers--Yes!\r\n\r\nI heard the bell tolled on thy burial day;\r\nI saw the hearse that bore thee slow away;\r\nAnd, turning from my nursery window, drew\r\nA long, long sigh, and wept a last adieu!\r\nBut was it such? It was. Where thou art gone,\r\nAdieus and farewells are a sound unknown.\r\nMay I but meet thee on that peaceful shore,\r\nThe parting word shall pass my lips no more.\r\n\r\nThy maidens, grieved themselves at my concern,\r\nOft gave me promise of thy quick return;\r\nWhat ardently I wished, I long believed;\r\nAnd, disappointed still, was still deceived;\r\nBy expectation, every day beguiled,\r\nDupe of to-morrow, even when a child.\r\nThus many a sad to-morrow came and went,\r\nTill, all my stock of infant sorrows spent,\r\nI learned at last submission to my lot;\r\nBut, though I less deplored thee, ne\'er forgot.\r\n\r\nMy boast is not that I deduce my birth\r\nFrom loins enthroned, and rulers of the earth;\r\nBut higher far my proud pretensions rise,--\r\nThe son of parents passed into the skies.\r\nAnd now, farewell!   Time, unrevoked, has run\r\nHis wonted course, yet what I wished is done.\r\n\r\nBy Contemplation\'s help, not sought in vain,\r\nI seem to have lived my childhood o\'er again;\r\nTo have renewed the joys that once were mine,\r\nWithout the sin of violating thine;\r\nAnd, while the wings of Fancy still are free,\r\nAnd I can view this mimic show of thee,\r\nTime has but half succeeded in his theft,--\r\nThyself removed, thy power to soothe me left.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXV. DEATH OF SAMSON. (312)\r\n\r\nJohn Milton, 1608-1674, was born in London--eight years before the\r\ngreatest English poet, Shakespeare, died. His father followed the\r\nprofession of a scrivener, in which he acquired a competence. As a boy,\r\nMilton was exceedingly studious, continuing his studies till midnight. He\r\ngraduated at Christ\'s College, Cambridge, where his singular beauty, his\r\nslight figure, and his fastidious morality caused his companions to\r\nnickname him "the lady of Christ\'s." On leaving college he spent five\r\nyears more in study, and produced his lighter poems. He then traveled on\r\nthe continent, returning about the time the civil war broke out. For a time\r\nhe taught a private school, but soon threw himself with all the power of\r\nhis able and tried pen into the political struggle. He was the champion of\r\nParliament and of Cromwell for about twenty years. On the accession of\r\nCharles II., he concealed himself for a time, but was soon allowed to live\r\nquietly in London. His eyesight had totally failed in 1654; but now, in\r\nblindness, age, family affliction, and comparative poverty, he produced\r\nhis great work "Paradise Lost." In 1667 he sold the poem for 5 Pounds in\r\ncash, with a promise of 10 Pounds more on certain contingencies; the sum\r\ntotal received by himself and family for the immortal poem, was 23 Pounds.\r\nLater, he produced "Paradise Regained" and "Samson Agonistes," from the\r\nlatter of which the following extract is taken. Milton is a wonderful\r\nexample of a man, who, by the greatness of his own mind, triumphed over\r\ntrials, afflictions, hardships, and the evil influence of bitter political\r\ncontroversy.\r\n###\r\n\r\nOccasions drew me early to this city;\r\nAnd, as the gates I entered with sunrise,\r\nThe morning trumpets festival proclaimed\r\nThrough each high street: little I had dispatched,\r\nWhen all abroad was rumored that this day\r\nSamson should be brought forth, to show the people\r\nProof of his mighty strength in feats and games.\r\nI sorrowed at his captive state,\r\nBut minded not to be absent at that spectacle.\r\n\r\nThe building was a spacious theater\r\nHalf-round, on two main pillars vaulted high,\r\nWith seats where all the lords, and each degree\r\nOf sort, might sit in order to behold;\r\nThe other side was open, where the throng\r\nOn banks and scaffolds under sky might stand:\r\nI among these aloof obscurely stood.\r\nThe feast and noon grew high, and sacrifice\r\nHad filled their hearts with mirth, high cheer, and wine,\r\nWhen to their sports they turned. Immediately\r\nWas Samson as a public servant brought,\r\nIn their state livery clad: before him pipes\r\nAnd timbrels; on each side went arme\'d guards;\r\nBoth horse and foot before him and behind,\r\nArchers and slingers, cataphracts, and spears.\r\nAt sight of him the people with a shout\r\nRifted the air, clamoring their god with praise,\r\nWho had made their dreadful enemy their thrall.\r\n\r\nHe, patient, but undaunted, where they led him,\r\nCame to the place; and what was set before him,\r\nWhich without help of eye might be essayed,\r\nTo heave, pull, draw, or break, he still performed\r\nAll with incredible, stupendous force,\r\nNone daring to appear antagonist.\r\n\r\nAt length for intermission sake, they led him\r\nBetween the pillars; he his guide requested,\r\nAs overtired, to let him lean awhile\r\nWith both his arms on those two massy pillars,\r\nThat to the arche\'d roof gave main support.\r\n\r\nHe unsuspicious led him; which when Samson\r\nFelt in his arms, with head awhile inclined,\r\nAnd eyes fast fixed, he stood, as one who prayed,\r\nOr some great matter in his mind revolved:\r\nAt last, with head erect, thus cried aloud:--\r\n"Hitherto, lords, what your commands imposed\r\nI have performed, as reason was, obeying,\r\nNot without wonder or delight beheld;\r\nNow, of my own accord, such other trial\r\nI mean to show you of my strength yet greater,\r\nAs with amaze shall strike all who behold."\r\n\r\nThis uttered, straining all his nerves, he bowed;\r\nAs with the force of winds and waters pent\r\nWhen mountains tremble, those two massy pillars\r\nWith horrible convulsion to and fro\r\nHe tugged, he shook, till down they came, and drew\r\nThe whole roof after them with burst of thunder\r\nUpon the heads of all who sat beneath,--\r\nLords, ladies, captains, counselors, or priests,\r\nTheir choice nobility and flower, not only\r\nOf this, but each Philistian city round,\r\nMet from all parts to solemnize this feast.\r\nSamson, with these immixed, inevitably\r\nPulled down the same destruction on himself;\r\nThe vulgar only \'scaped who stood without.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--The person supposed to be speaking is a Hebrew who chanced to be\r\npresent at Gaza when the, incidents related took place. After the\r\ncatastrophe he rushes to Manoah, the father of Samson, to whom and his\r\nassembled friends he relates what he saw. (Cf. Bible, Judges xvi, 23.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXVI.  AN EVENING ADVENTURE. (315)\r\n\r\nNot long since, a gentleman was traveling in one of the counties of\r\nVirginia, and about the close of the day stopped at a public house to\r\nobtain refreshment and spend the night. He had been there but a short\r\ntime, before an old man alighted from his gig, with the apparent intention\r\nof becoming his fellow guest at the same house.\r\n\r\nAs the old man drove up, he observed that both the shafts of his gig were\r\nbroken, and that they were held together by withes, formed from the bark\r\nof a hickory sapling. Our traveler observed further that he was plainly\r\nclad, that his knee buckles were loosened, and that something like\r\nnegligence pervaded his dress. Conceiving him to be one of the honest\r\nyeomanry of our land, the courtesies of strangers passed between them, and\r\nthey entered the tavern. It was about the same time, that an addition of\r\nthree or four young gentlemen was made to their number; most, if not all\r\nof them, of the legal profession.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they became conveniently accommodated, the conversation was\r\nturned, by one of the latter, upon the eloquent harangue which had that\r\nday been displayed at the bar. It was replied by the other that he had\r\nwitnessed, the same day, a degree of eloquence no doubt equal, but it was\r\nfrom the pulpit. Something like a sarcastic rejoinder was made as to the\r\neloquence of the pulpit, and a warm and able altercation ensued, in which\r\nthe merits of the Christian religion became the subject of discussion.\r\nFrom six o\'clock until eleven, the young champions wielded the sword of\r\nargument, adducing with ingenuity and ability everything that could be\r\nsaid pro and con.\r\n\r\nDuring this protracted period, the old gentleman listened with the\r\nmeekness and modesty of a child, as if he were adding new information to\r\nthe stores of his own mind; or perhaps he was observing, with a\r\nphilosophic eye, the faculties of the youthful mind, and how new energies\r\nare evolved by repeated action; or perhaps, with patriotic emotion, he was\r\nreflecting upon the future destinies of his country, and on the rising\r\ngeneration, upon whom those future destinies must devolve; or, most\r\nprobably, with a sentiment of moral and religious feeling, he was\r\ncollecting an argument which no art would be "able to elude, and no force\r\nto resist." Our traveler remained a spectator, and took no part in what\r\nwas said.\r\n\r\nAt last one of the young men, remarking that it was impossible to combat\r\nwith long and established prejudices, wheeled around, and with some\r\nfamiliarity exclaimed, "Well, my old gentleman, what think you of these\r\nthings?" "If," said the traveler, "a streak of vivid lightning had at that\r\nmoment crossed the room, their amazement could not have been greater than\r\nit was from what followed." The most eloquent and unanswerable appeal that\r\nhe had ever heard or read, was made for nearly an hour by the old\r\ngentleman. So perfect was his recollection, that every argument urged\r\nagainst the Christian religion was met in the order in which it was\r\nadvanced. Hume\'s sophistry on the subject of miracles, was, if possible,\r\nmore perfectly answered than it had already been done by Campbell. And in\r\nthe whole lecture there was so much simplicity and energy, pathos and\r\nsublimity, that not another word was uttered.\r\n\r\n"An attempt to describe it," said the traveler, "would be an attempt to\r\npaint the sunbeams." It was now a matter of curiosity and inquiry who the\r\nold gentleman was. The traveler concluded that it was the preacher from\r\nwhom the pulpit eloquence was heard; but no, it was John Marshall, the\r\nChief Justice of the United States.\r\n\r\nNOTES.--David Hume (b. 1711, d. 1776) was a celebrated Scotch historian\r\nand essayist. His most important work is "The History of England." He was\r\na skeptic in matters of religion, and was a peculiarly subtle writer.\r\n\r\nGeorge Campbell (b. 1719, d. 1796) was a distinguished Scotch minister. He\r\nwrote "A Dissertation on Miracles," ably answering Hume\'s "Essay on\r\nMiracles."\r\n\r\nJohn Marshall (b. 1755, d. 1835) was Chief Justice of the United States\r\nfrom 1801 until his death. He was an eminent jurist, and wrote a "Life of\r\nWashington," which made him famous as an author.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXVII. THE BAREFOOT BOY. (317)\r\n\r\nJohn Greenleaf Whittier, 1807-1892, was born in Haverhill, Mass., and,\r\nwith short intervals of absence, he always resided in that vicinity. His\r\nparents were Friends or "Quakers," and he always held to the same faith.\r\nHe spent his boyhood on a farm, occasionally writing verses for the papers\r\neven then. Two years of study in the academy seem to have given him all\r\nthe special opportunity for education that he ever enjoyed. In 1829 he\r\nedited a newspaper in Boston, and the next year assumed a similar position\r\nin Hartford. For two years he was a member of the Massachusetts\r\nlegislature. In 1836 he edited an anti-slavery paper in Philadelphia, and\r\nwas secretary of the American Anti-Slavery Society. Mr. Whittier wrote\r\nextensively both in prose and verse. During the later years of his life he\r\npublished several volumes of poems, and contributed frequently to the\r\npages of the "Atlantic Monthly." An earnest opponent of slavery, some of\r\nhis poems bearing on that subject are fiery and even bitter; but, in\r\ngeneral, their sentiment is gentle, and often pathetic. As a poet, he took\r\nrank among those most highly esteemed by his countrymen. "Snow-Bound,"\r\npublished in 1805, is one of the longest and best of his poems. Several of\r\nhis shorter pieces are marked by much smoothness and sweetness.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nBlessings on thee, little man,\r\nBarefoot boy, with cheek of tan!\r\nWith thy turned-up pantaloons,\r\nAnd thy merry whistled tunes;\r\nWith thy red lip, redder still\r\nKissed by strawberries on the hill;\r\nWith the sunshine on thy face,\r\nThrough thy torn brim\'s jaunty grace;\r\nFrom my heart I give thee joy,--\r\nI was once a barefoot boy!\r\nPrince thou art,--the grown-up man\r\nOnly is republican.\r\nLet the million-dollared ride!\r\nBarefoot, trudging, at his side,\r\nThou hast more than he can buy\r\nIn the reach of ear and eye,--\r\nOutward sunshine, inward joy:\r\nBlessings on thee, barefoot boy!\r\n\r\nOh for boyhood\'s painless play,\r\nSleep that wakes in laughing day,\r\nHealth that mocks the doctor\'s rules,\r\nKnowledge never learned of schools,\r\nOf the wild bee\'s morning chase,\r\nOf the wild flower\'s time and place,\r\nFlight of fowl and habitude\r\nOf the tenants of the wood;\r\nHow the tortoise bears his shell,\r\nHow the woodchuck digs his cell,\r\nAnd the ground mole sinks his well\r\nHow the robin feeds her young,\r\nHow the oriole\'s nest is hung;\r\nWhere the whitest lilies blow,\r\nWhere the freshest berries grow,\r\nWhere the groundnut trails its vine,\r\nWhere the wood grape\'s clusters shine;\r\nOf the black wasp\'s cunning way,\r\nMason of his walls of clay,\r\nAnd the architectural plans\r\nOf gray hornet artisans!--\r\nFor, eschewing books and tasks,\r\nNature answers all he asks;\r\nHand in hand with her he walks,\r\nFace to face with her he talks,\r\nPart and parcel of her joy,--\r\nBlessings on thee, barefoot boy!\r\n\r\nOh for boyhood\'s time of June,\r\nCrowding years in one brief moon,\r\nWhen all things I heard or saw\r\nMe, their master, waited for.\r\nI was rich in flowers and trees,\r\nHumming birds and honeybees;\r\nFor my sport the squirrel played,\r\nPlied the snouted mole his spade;\r\nFor my taste the blackberry cone\r\nPurpled over hedge and stone;\r\nLaughed the brook for my delight\r\nThrough the day and through the night,\r\nWhispering at the garden wall,\r\nTalked with me from fall to fall;\r\nMine the sand-rimmed pickerel pond,\r\nMine the walnut slopes beyond,\r\nMine, on bending orchard trees,\r\nApples of Hesperides!\r\nStill, as my horizon grew,\r\nLarger grew my riches too;\r\nAll the world I saw or knew\r\nSeemed a complex Chinese toy,\r\nFashioned for a barefoot boy!\r\n\r\nOh for festal dainties spread,\r\nLike my bowl of milk and bread,--\r\nPewter spoon and bowl of wood,\r\nOn the doorstone, gray and rude!\r\nO\'er me, like a regal tent,\r\nCloudy-ribbed, the sunset bent,\r\nPurple-curtained, fringed with gold,\r\nLooped in many a wind-swung fold;\r\nWhile for music came the play\r\nOf the pied frog\'s orchestra;\r\nAnd to light the noisy choir,\r\nLit the fly his lamp of fire.\r\nI was monarch: pomp and joy\r\nWaited on the barefoot boy!\r\n\r\nCheerily, then, my little man,\r\nLive and laugh, as boyhood can!\r\nThough the flinty slopes be hard,\r\nStubble-speared the new-mown sward,\r\nEvery morn shall lead thee through\r\nFresh baptisms of the dew;\r\nEvery evening from thy feet\r\nShall the cool wind kiss the heat:\r\nAll too soon these feet must hide\r\nIn the prison cells of pride,\r\nLose the freedom of the sod,\r\nLike a colt\'s for work be shod,\r\nMade to tread the mills of toil,\r\nUp and down in ceaseless moil:\r\nHappy if their track be found\r\nNever on forbidden ground;\r\nHappy if they sink not in\r\nQuick and treacherous sands of sin.\r\nAh! that thou shouldst know thy joy\r\nEre it passes, barefoot boy!\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.--The Hesperides, in Grecian mythology, were four sisters (some\r\ntraditions say three, and others, seven) who guarded the golden apples\r\ngiven to Juno as a wedding present. The locality of the garden of the\r\nHesperides is a disputed point with mythologists.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A well-dressed man is reaching for a glove while facing\r\nthree ferocious lions. Several people are observing him from the safety of\r\na raised platform.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXVIII.  THE GLOVE AND THE LIONS. (321)\r\n\r\nJames Henry Leigh Hunt, 1784-1859. Leigh Hunt, as he is commonly called,\r\nwas prominent before the public for fifty years as "a writer of essays,\r\npoems, plays, novels, and criticisms." He was born at Southgate,\r\nMiddlesex, England. His mother was an American lady. He began to write for\r\nthe public at a very early age. In 1808, In connection with his brother,\r\nhe established "The Examiner," a newspaper advocating liberal opinions in\r\npolitics. For certain articles offensive to the government, the brothers\r\nwere fined 500 Pounds each and condemned to two years\' imprisonment. Leigh\r\nfitted up his prison like a boudoir, received his friends here, and wrote\r\nseveral works during his confinement. Mr. Hunt was intimate with Byron,\r\nShelley, Moore, and Keats, and was associated with Byron and Shelley in\r\nthe publication of a political and literary journal. His last years were\r\npeacefully devoted to literature, and in 1847 he received a pension from\r\nthe government.\r\n###\r\n\r\nKing Francis was a hearty king, and loved a royal sport,\r\nAnd one day, as his lions fought, sat looking on the court;\r\nThe nobles filled the benches round, the ladies by their side,\r\nAnd \'mongst them sat the Count de Lorge, with one for whom he sighed:\r\nAnd truly \'t was a gallant thing to see that crowning show,\r\nValor and love, and a king above, and the royal beasts below.\r\n\r\nRamped and roared the lions, with horrid laughing jaws;\r\nThey bit, they glared, gave blows like beams, a wind went with their paws;\r\nWith wallowing might and stifled roar, they rolled on one another:\r\nTill all the pit, with sand and mane, was in a thunderous smother;\r\nThe bloody foam above the bars came whizzing through the air:\r\nSaid Francis, then, "Faith, gentlemen, we\'re better here than there."\r\n\r\nDe Lorge\'s love o\'erheard the king,--a beauteous, lively dame,\r\nWith smiling lips, and sharp, bright eyes, which always seemed the same;\r\nShe thought, "The Count, my lover, is brave as brave call be,\r\nHe surely would do wondrous things to show his love for me;\r\nKing, ladies, lovers, all look on; the occasion is divine;\r\nI\'ll drop my glove to prove his love; great glory will be mine."\r\n\r\nShe dropped her glove to prove his love, then looked at him and smiled;\r\nHe bowed, and in a moment leaped among the lions wild;\r\nThe leap was quick, return was quick, he soon regained his place,\r\nThen threw the glove, but not with love, right in the lady\'s face.\r\n"In faith," cried Francis, "rightly done!" and he rose from where he sat;\r\n"No love," quoth he, "but vanity, sets love a task like that."\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.--King Francis. This is supposed to have been Francis I. of France\r\n(b. 1494, d. 1547). He was devoted to sports of this nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXIX. THE FOLLY OF INTOXICATION. (322)\r\n\r\n\r\nIago.    What, are you hurt, lieutenant?\r\nCassio.  Ay, past all surgery.\r\nIago.    Marry, heaven forbid!\r\nCas.     Reputation, reputation, reputation! Oh, I have\r\n         lost my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of myself,\r\n         and what remains is bestial. My reputation! Iago, my reputation!\r\n\r\nIago.    As I am an honest man, I thought you had received some\r\n         bodily wound; there is more sense in that than in reputation.\r\n         Reputation is an idle and most false imposition: oft got without\r\n         merit, and lost without deserving: you have lost no reputation at\r\n         all, unless you repute yourself such a loser. What, man! there\r\n         are ways to recover the general again. Sue to him again, and he\'s\r\n         yours.\r\n\r\nCas.     I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so good a\r\n         commander with so slight, so drunken, and so indiscreet an\r\n         officer. Drunk? and speak parrot? and squabble? swagger? swear?\r\n         and discourse fustian with one\'s own shadow? O thou invisible\r\n         spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by, let us call\r\n         thee devil!\r\n\r\nIago.    What was he that you followed with your sword? What had he\r\n         done to you?\r\n\r\nCas.     I know not.\r\n\r\nIago.    Is\'t possible?\r\n\r\nCas.     I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly; a quarrel,\r\n         but nothing wherefore. Oh that men should put an enemy in their\r\n         mouths to steal away their brains! that we should, with joy,\r\n         revel, pleasure, and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!\r\n\r\nIago.    Why, but you are now well enough: how came you thus\r\n         recovered?\r\n\r\nCas.     It hath pleased the devil, Drunkenness, to give place to the\r\n         devil, Wrath; one unperfectness shows me another, to make me\r\n         frankly despise myself.\r\n\r\nIago.    Come, you are too severe a moraler. As the time, the place, and\r\n         the condition of this country stands, I could heartily wish this\r\n         had not befallen; but since it is as it is, mend it for your own\r\n         good.\r\n\r\nCas.     I will ask him for my place again: he shall tell me I am a\r\n         drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra, such an answer would\r\n         stop them all. To be now a sensible man, by and by a fool, and\r\n         presently a beast! Oh strange!--Every inordinate cup is\r\n         unblessed, and the ingredient is a devil! Iago.  Come, come; good\r\n         wine is a good familiar creature, if it be well used; exclaim no\r\n         more against it. And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love\r\n         you.\r\n\r\nCas.     I have well approved it, sir,--I, drunk!\r\n\r\nIago.    You or any man living may be drunk at a time, man. I\'ll tell you\r\n         what you shall do. Our general\'s wife is now the general. Confess\r\n         yourself freely to her; importune her help to put you in your\r\n         place again. She is of so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a\r\n         disposition, she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more\r\n         than she is requested. This broken joint between you and her\r\n         husband, entreat her to splinter; and, my fortunes against any\r\n         lay worth naming, this crack of your love shall grow stronger\r\n         than it was before.\r\n\r\nCas.     You advise me well.\r\n\r\nIago.    I protest in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.\r\n\r\nCas.     I think it freely, and betimes in the morning, I will beseech\r\n         the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me; I am desperate of my\r\n         fortunes if they check me here.\r\n\r\nIago.    You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant, I must to the watch.\r\n\r\nCas.     Good night, honest Iago.\r\n                                 Shakespeare.--Othello, Act ii, Scene iii.\r\n\r\nNOTES.--Iago is represented as a crafty, unscrupulous villain. He applies\r\nfor the position of lieutenant under Othello, but the latter has already\r\nappointed Cassio--who is honest, but of a weak character--to that\r\nposition; he, however, makes Iago his ensign. Then Iago, to revenge\r\nhimself for this and other fancied wrongs, enters upon a systematic course\r\nof villainy, part of which is to bring about the intoxication of Cassio,\r\nand his consequent discharge from the lieutenancy.\r\n\r\nThe Hydra was a fabled monster of Grecian mythology, having nine heads,\r\none of which was immortal.\r\n\r\nDesdemona was the wife of Othello.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXC. STARVED ROCK. (325)\r\n\r\nFrancis Parkman, 1823-1893, the son of a clergyman of the same name, was\r\nborn in Boston, and graduated at Harvard University in 1844. He spent more\r\nthan twenty years in a careful study of the early French explorations and\r\nsettlements in America; and he published the fruits of his labor in twelve\r\nlarge volumes. Although troubled with an affection of the eyes, which\r\nsometimes wholly prevented reading or writing, his work was most carefully\r\nand successfully done. His narratives are written in a clear and animated\r\nstyle, and his volumes are a rich contribution to American history.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cliff called "Starved Rock," now pointed out to travelers as the chief\r\nnatural curiosity of the region, rises, steep on three sides as a castle\r\nwall, to the height of a hundred and twenty-five feet above the river. In\r\nfront, it overhangs the water that washes its base; its western brow looks\r\ndown on the tops of the forest trees below; and on the east lies a wide\r\ngorge, or ravine, choked with the mingled foliage of oaks, walnuts, and\r\nelms; while in its rocky depths a little brook creeps down to mingle with\r\nthe river.\r\n\r\nFrom the rugged trunk of the stunted cedar that leans forward from the\r\nbrink, you may drop a plummet into the river below, where the catfish and\r\nthe turtles may plainly be seen gliding over the wrinkled sands of the\r\nclear and shallow current. The cliff is accessible only from the south,\r\nwhere a man may climb up, not without difficulty, by a steep and narrow\r\npassage. The top is about an acre in extent.\r\n\r\nHere, in the month of December, 1682, La Salle and Tonty began to entrench\r\nthemselves. They cut away the forest that crowned the rock, built\r\nstorehouses and dwellings of its remains, dragged timber up the rugged\r\npathway, and encircled the summit with a palisade. Thus the winter was\r\npassed, and meanwhile the work of negotiation went prosperously on. The\r\nminds of the Indians had been already prepared. In La Salle they saw their\r\nchampion against the Iroquois, the standing terror of all this region.\r\nThey gathered around his stronghold like the timorous peasantry of the\r\nMiddle Ages around the rock-built castle of their feudal lord.\r\n\r\nFrom the wooden ramparts of St. Louis,--for so he named his fort,--high\r\nand inaccessible as an eagle\'s nest, a strange scene lay before his eye.\r\nThe broad, flat valley of the Illinois was spread beneath him like a map,\r\nbounded in the distance by its low wall of wooded hills. The river wound\r\nat his feet in devious channels among islands bordered with lofty trees;\r\nthen, far on the left, flowed calmly westward through the vast meadows,\r\ntill its glimmering blue ribbon was lost in hazy distance.\r\n\r\nThere had been a time, and that not remote, when these fair meadows were a\r\nwaste of death and desolation, scathed with fire, and strewn with the\r\nghastly relics of an Iroquois victory. Now, all was changed. La Salle\r\nlooked down from his rock on a concourse of wild human life. Lodges of\r\nbark and rushes, or cabins of logs, were clustered on the open plain, or\r\nalong the edges of the bordering forests. Squaws labored, warriors lounged\r\nin the sun, naked children whooped and gamboled on the grass.\r\n\r\nBeyond the river, a mile and a half on the left, the banks were studded\r\nonce more with the lodges of the Illinois, who, to the number of six\r\nthousand, had returned, since their defeat, to this their favorite\r\ndwelling place. Scattered along the valley, among the adjacent hills, or\r\nover the neighboring prairie, were the cantonments of a half score of\r\nother tribes, and fragments of tribes, gathered under the protecting aegis\r\nof the French.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--The curious elevation called Starved Rock is on the south side of\r\nIllinois River, between La Salle and Ottawa. There is a legend according\r\nto which it is said that over one hundred years ago, a party of Illinois\r\nIndians took refuge here from the Pottawatomies; their besiegers, however,\r\nconfined them so closely that the whole party perished of starvation, or,\r\nas some say, of thirst. From this circumstance the rock takes its name.\r\n\r\nLa Salle (b. 1643, d. 1687) was a celebrated French explorer and fur\r\ntrader. He established many forts throughout the Mississippi Valley,--\r\namong them, Fort St. Louis, in 1683.\r\n\r\nTonty was an Italian, who formerly served in both the French army and\r\nnavy, and afterwards joined La Salle in his explorations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCI. PRINCE HENRY AND FALSTAFF. (327)\r\n\r\nPRINCE HENRY and POINS, in a back room, in a tavern.\r\nEnter FALSTAFF, GADSHILL, BARDOLPH, and PETO.\r\n\r\nPoins. Welcome, Jack. Where hast thou been?\r\n\r\nFalstaff. A plague of all cowards, I say, and a vengeance too! marry, and\r\namen! Give me a cup of sack, boy. Ere I lead this life long, I\'ll sew\r\nnether stocks, and mend them, and foot them, too. A plague of all cowards!\r\nGive me a cup of sack, rogue. Is there no virtue extant? (He drinks, and\r\nthen continues.) You rogue, here\'s lime in this sack, too; there is\r\nnothing but roguery to be found in villainous man: yet a coward is worse\r\nthan a cup of sack with lime in it. A villainous coward! Go thy ways, old\r\nJack; die when thou wilt: if manhood, good manhood, be not forgot upon the\r\nface of the earth, then am I a shotten herring. There live not three good\r\nmen unhanged, in England; and one of them is fat and grows old; a bad\r\nworld, I say! I would I were a weaver; I could sing psalms, or anything. A\r\nplague of all cowards, I say still.\r\n\r\nPrince Henry. How now, woolsack?  What mutter you?\r\n\r\nFal. A king\'s son! If I do not beat thee out of thy kingdom with a dagger\r\nof lath, and drive all thy subjects afore thee like a flock of wild geese,\r\nI\'ll never wear hair on my face more. You, Prince of Wales!\r\n\r\nP. Henry. Why, you baseborn dog! What\'s the matter?\r\n\r\nFal. Are you not a coward? Answer me to that; and Poins there?\r\n\r\nPoins. Ye fat braggart, an ye call me coward, I\'ll stab thee.\r\n\r\nFal. I call thee coward? I\'ll see thee gibbeted ere I call thee coward:\r\nbut I would give a thousand pounds I could run as fast as thou canst. You\r\nare straight enough in the shoulders, you care not who sees your back:\r\ncall you that backing of your friends? A plague upon such backing! Give me\r\nthem that will face me. Give me a cup of sack. I am a rogue, if I have\r\ndrunk to-day.\r\n\r\nP. Henry. O villain! thy lips ate scarce wiped since thou drunkest last.\r\n\r\nFal. All\'s one for that. A plague of all cowards, still say 1. (He\r\ndrinks.)\r\n\r\nP. Henry. What\'s the matter?\r\n\r\nFal. What\'s the matter! There be four of us here have ta\'en a thousand\r\npounds this morning.\r\n\r\nP. Henry. Where is it, Jack? where is it?\r\n\r\nFal. Where is it? Taken from us it is; a hundred upon poor four of us.\r\n\r\nP. Henry. What! a hundred, man?\r\n\r\nFal. I am a rogue, if I were not at half-sword with a dozen of them two\r\nhours together. I have \'scaped by miracle. I am eight times thrust through\r\nthe doublet; four, through the hose; my buckler cut through and through;\r\nmy sword hacked like a handsaw; look here! (shows his sword.) I never\r\ndealt better since I was a man; all would not do. A plague of all cowards!\r\nLet them speak (pointing to GADSHILL, BARDOLPH, and PETO); if they speak\r\nmore or less than truth, they are villains and the sons of darkness.\r\n\r\nP. Henry. Speak, sirs; how was it?\r\n\r\nGadshill. We four set upon some dozen--\r\n\r\nFal. Sixteen, at least, my lord.\r\n\r\nGad. And bound them.\r\n\r\nPeta. No, no, they were not bound.\r\n\r\nFal. You rogue, they were bound, every man of them; or I am a Jew,\r\nelse--an Ebrew Jew.\r\n\r\nGad. As we were sharing, some six or seven fresh men set upon us--\r\n\r\nFal. And unbound the rest; and then come in the other.\r\n\r\nP. Henry. What! fought ye with them all?\r\n\r\nFal. All? I know not what ye call all; but if I fought not with fifty of\r\nthem, I am a bunch of radish: if there were not two or three and fifty\r\nupon poor old Jack, then I am no two-legged creature.\r\n\r\nP. Henry. Pray heaven, you have not murdered some of them.\r\n\r\nFal. Nay, that\'s past praying for; for I have peppered two of them; two I\r\nam sure I have paid; two rogues in buckram suits. I tell thee what, Hal,\r\nif I tell thee a lie, spit in my face, and call me a horse. Thou knowest\r\nmy old ward; (he draws his sword and stands if about to fight) here I lay,\r\nand thus I bore my point. Four rogues in buckram let drive at me--\r\n\r\nP. Henry. What! four? Thou saidst but two even now.\r\n\r\nFal. Four, Hal; I told thee four.\r\n\r\nPoins. Ay, ay, he said four.\r\n\r\nFal. These four came all afront, and mainly thrust at me. I made no more\r\nado, but took all their seven points in my target, thus.\r\n\r\nP. Henry. Seven? Why, there were but four, even now.\r\n\r\nFal. In buckram?\r\n\r\nPoins. Ay, four, in buckram suits.\r\n\r\nFal. Seven, by these hilts, or I am a villain else.\r\n\r\nP. Henry. Prithee, let him alone; we shall have more anon.\r\n\r\nFal. Dost thou hear me, Hal?\r\n\r\nP. Henry. Ay, and mark thee, too, Jack.\r\n\r\nFal. Do so, for it is worth the listening to. These nine in buckram, that\r\nI told thee of--\r\n\r\nP. Henry. So, two more already.\r\n\r\nFal. Their points being broken, began to give me ground; but I followed me\r\nclose, came in foot and hand; and, with a thought, seven of the eleven I\r\npaid.\r\n\r\nP. Henry. O, monstrous! eleven buckram men grown out of two!\r\n\r\nFal. But three knaves, in Kendal green, came at my back, and let drive at\r\nme; for it was so dark, Hal, that thou couldst not see thy hand.\r\n\r\nP. Henry. These lies are like the father of them; gross as a mountain,\r\nopen, palpable. Why, thou clay-brained, nott-pated fool; thou greasy\r\ntallow keech--\r\n\r\nFal. What! Art thou mad! Art thou mad? Is not the truth the truth?\r\n\r\nP. Henry. Why, how couldst thou know these men in Kendal green, when it\r\nwas so dark thou couldst not see thy hand? Come, tell us your reason; what\r\nsayest thou to this?\r\n\r\nPoins. Come, your reason, Jack, your reason.\r\n\r\nFal. What, upon compulsion? No, were I at the strappado, or all the racks\r\nin the world, I would not tell you on compulsion. Give you a reason on\r\ncompulsion!

STUDIES. (332)\r\n\r\nSir Francis Bacon, 1561-1626. This eminent man was the youngest son of Sir\r\nNicholas Bacon, lord keeper of the seal in the early part of Elizabeth\'s\r\nreign, and Anne Bacon, one of the most learned women of the time, daughter\r\nof Sir Anthony Cooke. He was born in London, and educated at Cambridge. He\r\nwas a laborious and successful student, but even in his boyhood conceived\r\na great distrust of the methods of study pursued at the seats of\r\nlearning,--methods which he exerted his great powers to correct in his\r\nmaturer years. Much of his life was spent in the practice of law, in the\r\ndischarge of the duties of high office, and as a member of Parliament;\r\nbut, to the end of life, he busied himself with philosophical pursuits,\r\nand he will be known to posterity chiefly for his deep and clear writings\r\non these subjects. His constant direction in philosophy is to break away\r\nfrom assumption and tradition, and to be led only by sound induction based\r\non a knowledge of observed phenomena. His "Novum Organum" and "Advancement\r\nof Learning" embody his ideas on philosophy and the true methods of\r\nseeking knowledge.\r\n\r\nBacon rose to no very great distinction during the reign of Elizabeth;\r\nbut, under James I, he was promoted to positions of great honor and\r\ninfluence. In 1618 he was made Baron of Verulam; and, three years later,\r\nhe was made Viscount of St. Albans. During much of his life, Bacon was in\r\npecuniary straits, which was doubtless one reason of his downfall; for, in\r\n1621, he was accused of taking bribes, a charge to which he pleaded\r\nguilty. His disgrace followed, and he passed the last years of his life in\r\nretirement. Among the distinguished names in English literature, none\r\nstands higher in his department than that of Francis Bacon.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nStudies serve for delight, for ornament, and for ability. Their chief use\r\nfor delight is in privateness, and retiring; for ornament, is in\r\ndiscourse; and for ability, is in the judgment and disposition of\r\nbusiness; for expert men can execute, and perhaps judge of the\r\nparticulars, one by one; but the general counsels, and the plots and\r\nmarshaling of affairs, come best from those that are learned.\r\n\r\nTo spend too much time in studies, is sloth; to use them too much for\r\nornament, is affectation; to make judgment wholly by their rules, is the\r\nhumor of a scholar; they perfect nature and are perfected by experience--\r\nfor natural abilities are like natural plants, that need pruning by study;\r\nand studies themselves do give forth directions too much at large, except\r\nthey be bounded in by experience. Crafty men contemn studies, simple men\r\nadmire them, and wise men use them, for they teach not their own use; but\r\nthat is a wisdom without them, and above them, won by observation.\r\n\r\nRead not to contradict and confute, nor to believe and take for granted,\r\nnor to find talk and discourse, but to weigh and consider. Some books are\r\nto be tasted, others to be swallowed, and some few to be chewed and\r\ndigested; that is, some books are to be read only in parts; others to be\r\nread, but not curiously; and some few to be read wholly, and with\r\ndiligence and attention. Some books also may he read by deputy, and\r\nextracts made of them by others; but that would be only in the less\r\nimportant arguments, and the meaner sort of books; else distilled books\r\nare like common distilled waters, flashy things.\r\n\r\nReading maketh a full man, conference a ready man, and writing an exact\r\nman; and, therefore, if a man write little, he had need have a great\r\nmemory; if he confer little, he had need have a present wit; and if he\r\nread little, he had need have much cunning, to seem to know that he doth\r\nnot. Histories make men wise; poets, witty; the mathematics, subtle;\r\nnatural philosophy, deep; moral philosophy, grave; logic and rhetoric,\r\nable to contend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCIII. SURRENDER OF GRANADA. (334)\r\n\r\nSir Edward George Bulwer-Lytton, 1806-1873, was born in Norfolk County,\r\nEngland. His father died when he was young; his mother was a woman of\r\nstrong literary tastes, and did much to form her son\'s mind. In 1844, by\r\nroyal license, he took the surname of Lytton from his mother\'s family.\r\nBulwer graduated at Cambridge. He began to publish in 1826, and his novels\r\nand plays followed rapidly. "Pelham," "The Caxtons," "My Novel," "What\r\nwill he do with it?" and "Kenelm  Chillingly" are among the best known of\r\nhis numerous novels; and "The Lady of Lyons" and "Richelieu" are his most\r\nsuccessful plays. His novels are extensively read on the continent, and\r\nhave been translated into most of the languages spoken there. "Leila, or\r\nthe Siege of Granada," from which this selection is adapted, was published\r\nin 1840.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nDay dawned upon Granada, and the beams of the winter sun, smiling away the\r\nclouds of the past night, played cheerily on the murmuring waves of the\r\nXenil and the Darro. Alone, upon a balcony commanding a view of the\r\nbeautiful landscape, stood Boabdil, the last of the Moorish kings. He had\r\nsought to bring to his aid all the lessons of the philosophy he had\r\ncultivated.\r\n\r\n"What are we," thought the musing prince, "that we should fill the world\r\nwith ourselves--we kings? Earth resounds with the crash of my falling\r\nthrone; on the ear of races unborn the echo will live prolonged. But what\r\nhave I lost? Nothing that was necessary to my happiness, my repose:\r\nnothing save the source of all my wretchedness, the Marah of my life!\r\nShall I less enjoy heaven and earth, or thought or action, or man\'s more\r\nmaterial luxuries of food or sleep--the common and the cheap desires of\r\nall? Arouse thee, then, O heart within me! Many and deep emotions of\r\nsorrow or of joy are yet left to break the monotony of existence. . . .\r\nBut it is time to depart." So saying, he descended to the court, flung\r\nhimself on his barb, and, with a small and saddened train, passed through\r\nthe gate which we yet survey, by a blackened and crumbling tower,\r\novergrown with vines and ivy; thence, amidst gardens now appertaining to\r\nthe convent of the victor faith, he took his mournful and unwitnessed way.\r\n\r\nWhen he came to the middle of the hill that rises above those gardens, the\r\nsteel of the Spanish armor gleamed upon him, as the detachment sent to\r\noccupy the palace marched over the summit in steady order and profound\r\nsilence. At the head of this vanguard, rode, upon a snow-white palfrey,\r\nthe Bishop of Avila, followed by a long train of barefooted monks. They\r\nhalted as Boabdil approached, and the grave bishop saluted him with the\r\nair of one who addresses an infidel and inferior. With the quick sense of\r\ndignity common to the great, and yet more to the fallen, Boabdil felt, but\r\nresented not, the pride of the ecclesiastic. "Go, Christian," said he,\r\nmildly, "the gates of the Alhambra are open, and Allah has bestowed the\r\npalace and the city upon your king; may his virtues atone the faults of\r\nBoabdil!" So saying, and waiting no answer, he rode on without looking to\r\nthe right or the left. The Spaniards also pursued their way.\r\n\r\nThe sun had fairly risen above the mountains, when Boabdil and his train\r\nbeheld, from the eminence on which they were, the whole armament of Spain;\r\nand at the same moment, louder than the tramp of horse or the clash of\r\narms, was heard distinctly the solemn chant of Te Deum, which preceded the\r\nblaze of the unfurled and lofty standards. Boabdil, himself still silent,\r\nheard the groans and exclamations of his train; he turned to cheer or\r\nchide them, and then saw, from his own watchtower, with the sun shining\r\nfull upon its pure and dazzling surface, the silver cross of Spain. His\r\nAlhambra was already in the hands of the foe; while beside that badge of\r\nthe holy war waved the gay and flaunting flag of St. Iago, the canonized\r\nMars of the chivalry of Spain. At that sight the King\'s voice died within\r\nhim; he gave the rein to his barb, impatient to close the fatal\r\nceremonial, and did not slacken his speed till almost within bowshot of\r\nthe first ranks of the army.\r\n\r\nNever had Christian war assumed a more splendid and imposing aspect. Far\r\nas the eye could reach, extended the glittering and gorgeous lines of that\r\ngoodly power, bristling with sunlit spears and blazoned banners; while\r\nbeside, murmured, and glowed, and danced, the silver and laughing Xenil,\r\ncareless what lord should possess, for his little day, the banks that\r\nbloomed by its everlasting course. By a small mosque halted the flower of\r\nthe army. Surrounded by the archpriests of that mighty hierarchy, the\r\npeers and princes of a court that rivaled the Rolands of Charlemagne, was\r\nseen the kingly form of Ferdinand himself, with Isabel at his right hand,\r\nand the highborn dames of Spain, relieving, with their gay colors and\r\nsparkling gems, the sterner splendor of the crested helmet and polished\r\nmail. Within sight of the royal group, Boabdil halted, composed his aspect\r\nso as best to conceal his soul, and, a little in advance of his scanty\r\ntrain, but never in mien and majesty more a king, the son of Abdallah met\r\nhis haughty conqueror.\r\n\r\nAt the sight of his princely countenance and golden hair, his comely and\r\ncommanding beauty, made more touching by youth, a thrill of compassionate\r\nadmiration ran through that assembly of the brave and fair. Ferdinand and\r\nIsabel slowly advanced to meet their late rival,--their new subject; and,\r\nas Boabdil would have dismounted, the Spanish king placed his hand upon\r\nhis shoulder. "Brother and prince," said he, "forget thy sorrows; and may\r\nour friendship hereafter console thee for reverses, against which thou\r\nhast contended as a hero and a king--resisting man, but resigned at length\r\nto God."\r\n\r\nBoabdil did not affect to return this bitter but unintentional mockery of\r\ncompliment, He bowed his head, and remained a moment silent; then\r\nmotioning to his train, four of his officers approached, and, kneeling\r\nbeside Ferdinand, proffered to him, upon a silver buckler, the keys of the\r\ncity. "O king!" then said Boabdil, "accept the keys of the last hold which\r\nhas resisted the arms of Spain! The empire of the Moslem is no more. Thine\r\nare the city and the people of Granada; yielding to thy prowess, they yet\r\nconfide in thy mercy." "They do well," said the king; "our promises shall\r\nnot be broken. But since we know the gallantry of Moorish cavaliers, not\r\nto us, but to gentler hands, shall the keys of Granada be surrendered."\r\n\r\nThus saying, Ferdinand gave the keys to Isabel, who would have addressed\r\nsome soothing flatteries to Boabdil, but the emotion and excitement were\r\ntoo much for her compassionate heart, heroine and queen though she was;\r\nand when she lifted her eyes upon the calm and pale features of the\r\nfallen monarch, the tears gushed from them irresistibly, and her voice\r\ndied in murmurs. A faint flush overspread the features of Boabdil, and\r\nthere was a momentary pause of embarrassment, which the Moor was the first\r\nto break.\r\n\r\n"Fair queen," said he, with mournful and pathetic dignity, "thou canst\r\nread the heart that thy generous sympathy touches and subdues; this is thy\r\nlast, nor least glorious conquest. But I detain ye; let not my aspect\r\ncloud your triumph. Suffer me to say farewell." "Farewell, my brother,"\r\nreplied Ferdinand, "and may fair fortune go with you! Forget the past!"\r\nBoabdil smiled bitterly, saluted the royal pair with profound and silent\r\nreverence, and rode slowly on, leaving the army below as he ascended the\r\npath that led to his new principality beyond the Alpuxarras. As the trees\r\nsnatched the Moorish cavalcade from the view of the king, Ferdinand\r\nordered the army to recommence its march; and trumpet and cymbal presently\r\nsent their music to the ear of the Moslems.\r\n\r\nBoabdil spurred on at full speed, till his panting charger halted at the\r\nlittle village where his mother, his slaves, and his faithful wife,\r\nAmine--sent on before--awaited him. Joining these, he proceeded without\r\ndelay upon his melancholy path. They ascended that eminence which is the\r\npass into the Alpuxarras. From its height, the vale, the rivers, the\r\nspires, and the towers of Granada broke gloriously upon the view of the\r\nlittle band. They halted mechanically and abruptly; every eye was turned\r\nto the beloved scene. The proud shame of baffled warriors, the tender\r\nmemories of home, of childhood, of fatherland, swelled every heart, and\r\ngushed from every eye.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the distant boom of artillery broke from the citadel, and rolled\r\nalong the sunlit valley and crystal river. A universal wail burst from the\r\nexiles; it smote,--it overpowered the heart of the ill-starred king, in\r\nvain seeking to wrap himself in Eastern pride or stoical philosophy. The\r\ntears gushed from his eyes, and he covered his face with his hands. The\r\nband wound slowly on through the solitary defiles; and that place where\r\nthe king wept is still called The Last Sigh of the Moor.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--Granada was the capital of an ancient Moorish kingdom of the same\r\nname, in the southeastern part of Spain.

HAMLET\'S SOLILOQUY. (339)\r\n\r\nTo be, or not to be; that is the question:--\r\nWhether \'t is nobler in the mind to suffer\r\nThe slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,\r\nOr to take arms against a sea of troubles,\r\nAnd by opposing end them? To die,--to sleep,--\r\nNo more: and by a sleep to say we end\r\nThe heartache and the thousand natural shocks\r\nThat flesh is heir to,--\'t is a consummation\r\nDevoutly to be wished. To die,--to sleep:--\r\nTo sleep! perchance to dream:--ay, there\'s the rub;\r\nFor in that sleep of death what dreams may come\r\nWhen we have shuffled off this mortal coil,\r\nMust give us pause. There\'s the respect\r\nThat makes calamity of so long life;\r\nFor who would bear the whips and scorns of time,\r\nThe oppressor\'s wrong, the proud man\'s contumely,\r\nThe pangs of despised love, the law\'s delay,\r\nThe insolence of office, and the spurns\r\nThat patient merit of the unworthy takes,\r\nWhen he himself might his quietus make\r\nWith a bare bodkin? Who would fardels bear,\r\nTo grunt and sweat under a weary life,\r\nBut that the dread of something after death,--\r\nThe undiscovered country from whose bourn\r\nNo traveler returns,--puzzles the will\r\nAnd makes us rather bear those ills we have\r\nThan fly to others that we know not of?\r\nThus conscience doth make cowards of us all;\r\nAnd thus the native hue of resolution\r\nIs sicklied o\'er with the pale cast of thought,\r\nAnd enterprises of great pith and moment\r\nWith this regard their currents turn awry,\r\nAnd lose the name of action.\r\n                             Shakespeare.--Hamlet, Act iii, Scene i.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCV. GINEVRA. (340)\r\n\r\nSamuel Rogers, 1763-1855, was the son of a London banker, and, in company\r\nwith his father, followed the banking business for some years. He began to\r\nwrite at an early age, and published his "Pleasures of Memory," perhaps\r\nhis most famous work, in 1792. The next year his father died, leaving him\r\nan ample fortune. He now retired from business and established himself in\r\nan elegant house in St. James\'s Place. This house was a place of resort\r\nfor literary men during fifty years. In 1822 he published his longest\r\npoem, "Italy," after which he wrote but little. He wrote with care,\r\nspending, as he said, nine years on the "Pleasures of Memory," and sixteen\r\non "Italy." "His writings are remarkable for elegance of diction, purity\r\nof taste, and beauty of sentiment." It is said that he was very agreeable\r\nin conversation and manners, and benevolent in his disposition; but he was\r\naddicted to ill-nature and satire in some of his criticisms.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\n  If thou shouldst ever come by choice or chance\r\nTo Modena,--where still religiously\r\nAmong her ancient trophies, is preserved\r\nBologna\'s bucket (in its chain it hangs\r\nWithin that reverend tower, the Guirlandine),--\r\nStop at a palace near the Reggio gate,\r\nDwelt in of old by one of the Orsini.\r\nIts noble gardens, terrace above terrace,\r\nAnd rich in fountains, statues, cypresses,\r\nWill long detain thee; through their arche\'d walks,\r\nDim at noonday, discovering many a glimpse\r\nOf knights and dames such as in old romance,\r\nAnd lovers such as in heroic song,--\r\nPerhaps the two, for groves were their delight,\r\nThat in the springtime, as alone they sate,\r\nVenturing together on a tale of love.\r\nRead only part that day.--A summer sun\r\nSets ere one half is seen; but, ere thou go,\r\nEnter the house--prithee, forget it not--\r\nAnd look awhile upon a picture there.\r\n\r\n  \'T is of a lady in her earliest youth,\r\nThe very last of that illustrious race,\r\nDone by Zampieri--but by whom I care not.\r\nHe who observes it, ere he passes on,\r\nGazes his fill, and comes and comes again,\r\nThat he may call it up when far away.\r\n\r\n  She sits, inclining forward as to speak,\r\nHer lips half-open, and her finger up,\r\nAs though she said, "Beware!" her vest of gold,\r\nBroidered with flowers, and clasped from head to foot,\r\nAn emerald stone in every golden clasp;\r\nAnd on her brow, fairer than alabaster,\r\nA coronet of pearls. But then her face,\r\nSo lovely, yet so arch, so full of mirth,\r\nThe overflowings of an innocent heart,--\r\nIt haunts me still, though many a year has fled,\r\nLike some wild melody!\r\n\r\n                          Alone it hangs\r\nOver a moldering heirloom, its companion,\r\nAn oaken chest, half-eaten by the worm,\r\nBut richly carved by Antony of Trent\r\nWith scripture stories from the life of Christ;\r\nA chest that came from Venice, and had held\r\nThe ducal robes of some old ancestors--\r\nThat, by the way, it may be true or false--\r\nBut don\'t forget the picture; and thou wilt not,\r\nWhen thou hast heard the tale they told me there.\r\n\r\n  She was an only child; from infancy\r\nThe joy, the pride, of an indulgent sire;\r\nThe young Ginevra was his all in life,\r\nStill as she grew, forever in his sight;\r\nAnd in her fifteenth year became a bride,\r\nMarrying an only son, Francesco Doria,\r\nHer playmate from her birth, and her first love.\r\n\r\n  Just as she looks there in her bridal dress,\r\nShe was all gentleness, all gayety,\r\nHer pranks the favorite theme of every tongue.\r\nBut now the day was come, the day, the hour;\r\nNow, frowning, smiling, for the hundredth time,\r\nThe nurse, that ancient lady, preached decorum:\r\nAnd, in the luster of her youth, she gave Her hand,\r\nwith her heart in it, to Francesco.\r\n\r\n  Great was the joy; but at the bridal feast,\r\nWhen all sate down, the bride was wanting there.\r\nNor was she to be found! Her father cried,\r\n" \'Tis but to make a trial of our love!"\r\nAnd filled his glass to all; but his hand shook,\r\nAnd soon from guest to guest the panic spread.\r\n\'T was but that instant she had left Francesco,\r\nLaughing and looking back and flying still,\r\nHer ivory tooth imprinted on his finger.\r\nBut now, alas! she was not to be found;\r\nNor from that hour could anything be guessed,\r\nBut that she was not!--Weary of his life,\r\nFrancesco flew to Venice, and forthwith\r\nFlung it away in battle with the Turk.\r\nOrsini lived; and long was to be seen\r\nAn old man wandering as in quest of something,\r\nSomething he could not find--he knew not what.\r\nWhen he was gone, the house remained a while\r\nSilent and tenantless--then went to strangers.\r\n\r\n  Full fifty years were past, and all forgot,\r\nWhen on an idle day, a day of search\r\n\'Mid the old lumber in the gallery,\r\nThat moldering chest was noticed; and \'t was said\r\nBy one as young, as thoughtless as Ginevra,\r\n"Why not remove it from its lurking place?"\r\n\'T was done as soon as said; but on the way\r\nIt burst, it fell; and lo! a skeleton,\r\nWith here and there a pearl, an emerald stone,\r\nA golden clasp, clasping a shred of gold.\r\nAll else had perished, save a nuptial ring,\r\nAnd a small seal, her mother\'s legacy,\r\nEngraven with a name, the name of both,\r\n"Ginevra."---There then had she found a grave!\r\nWithin that chest had she concealed herself,\r\nFluttering with joy, the happiest of the happy;\r\nWhen a spring lock, that lay in ambush there,\r\nFastened her down forever!\r\n\r\nNOTES.--The above selection is part of the poem, "Italy."

INVENTIONS AND DISCOVERIES. (344)\r\n\r\nJohn Caldwell Calhoun, 1782-1850. This great statesman, and champion of\r\nsouthern rights and opinions, was born in Abbeville District, South\r\nCarolina. In the line of both parents, he was of Irish Presbyterian\r\ndescent. In youth he was very studious, and made the best use of such\r\nopportunities for education as the frontier settlement afforded. He\r\ngraduated at Yale College in 1804, and studied law at Litchfield,\r\nConnecticut. In 1808 he was elected to the Legislature of South Carolina;\r\nand, three years later, he was chosen to the National House of\r\nRepresentatives. During the six years that he remained in the House, he\r\ntook an active and prominent part in the stirring events of the time. In\r\n1817 he was appointed Secretary of War, and held the office seven years.\r\nFrom 1825 to 1832 he was Vice President of the United States. He then\r\nresigned this office, and took his seat as senator from South Carolina. In\r\n1844 President Tyler called him to his Cabinet as Secretary of State; and,\r\nin 1845, he returned to the Senate, where he remained till his death.\r\nDuring all his public life Mr. Calhoun was active and outspoken. His\r\nearnestness and logical force commanded the respect of those who differed\r\nmost widely from him in opinion. He took the most advanced ground in favor\r\nof "State Rights," and defended slavery as neither morally nor politically\r\nwrong. His foes generally conceded his honesty, and respected his ability;\r\nwhile his friends regarded him as little less than an oracle.\r\n\r\nIn private life Mr. Calhoun was highly esteemed and respected. His home\r\nwas at "Fort Hill," in the northwestern district of South Carolina; and\r\nhere he spent all the time he could spare from his public duties, in the\r\nenjoyments of domestic life and in cultivating his plantation. In his home\r\nhe was remarkable for kindness, cheerfulness, and sociability.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nTo comprehend more fully the force and bearing of public opinion, and to\r\nform a just estimate of the changes to which, aided by the press, it will\r\nprobably lead, politically and socially, it will be necessary to consider\r\nit in connection with the causes that have given it an influence so great\r\nas to entitle it to be regarded as a new political element. They will,\r\nupon investigation, be found in the many discoveries and inventions made\r\nin the last few centuries.\r\n\r\nAll these have led to important results. Through the invention of the\r\nmariner\'s compass, the globe has been circumnavigated and explored; and\r\nall who inhabit it, with but few exceptions, are brought within the sphere\r\nof an all-pervading commerce, which is daily diffusing over its surface\r\nthe light and blessings of civilization.\r\n\r\nThrough that of the art of printing, the fruits of observation and\r\nreflection, of discoveries and inventions, with all the accumulated stores\r\nof previously acquired knowledge, are preserved and widely diffused. The\r\napplication of gunpowder to the art of war has forever settled the long\r\nconflict for ascendency between civilization and barbarism, in favor of\r\nthe former, and thereby guaranteed that, whatever knowledge is now\r\naccumulated, or may hereafter be added, shall never again be lost.\r\n\r\nThe numerous discoveries and inventions, chemical and mechanical, and the\r\napplication of steam to machinery, have increased many fold the productive\r\npowers of labor and capital, and have thereby greatly increased the number\r\nwho may devote themselves to study and improvement, and the amount of\r\nmeans necessary for commercial exchanges, especially between the more and\r\nthe less advanced and civilized portions of the globe, to the great\r\nadvantage of both, but particularly of the latter.\r\n\r\nThe application of steam to the purposes of travel and transportation, by\r\nland and water, has vastly increased the facility, cheapness, and rapidity\r\nof both: diffusing, with them, information and intelligence almost as\r\nquickly and as freely as if borne by the winds; while the electrical wires\r\noutstrip them in velocity, rivaling in rapidity even thought itself.\r\n\r\nThe joint effect of all this has been a great increase and diffusion of\r\nknowledge; and, with this, an impulse to progress and civilization\r\nheretofore unexampled in the history of the world, accompanied by a mental\r\nenergy and activity unprecedented.\r\n\r\nTo all these causes, public opinion, and its organ, the press, owe their\r\norigin and great influence. Already they have attained a force in the more\r\ncivilized portions of the globe sufficient to be felt by all governments,\r\neven the most absolute and despotic. But, as great as they now are, they\r\nhave, as yet, attained nothing like their maximum force. It is probable\r\nthat not one of the causes which have contributed to their formation and\r\ninfluence, has yet produced its full effect; while several of the most\r\npowerful have just begun to operate; and many others, probably of equal or\r\neven greater force, yet remain to be brought to light.\r\n\r\nWhen the causes now in operation have produced their full effect, and\r\ninventions and discoveries shall have been exhausted--if that may ever\r\nbe--they will give a force to public opinion, and cause changes, political\r\nand social, difficult to be anticipated. What will be their final bearing,\r\ntime only can decide with any certainty.\r\n\r\nThat they will, however, greatly improve the condition of man ultimately,\r\nit would be impious to doubt; it would be to suppose that the all-wise and\r\nbeneficent Being, the Creator of all, had so constituted man as that the\r\nemployment of the high intellectual faculties with which He has been\r\npleased to endow him, in order that he might develop the laws that control\r\nthe great agents of the material world, and make them subservient to his\r\nuse, would prove to him the cause of permanent evil, and not of permanent\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.--This selection is an extract from "A Disquisition on Government."\r\nMr. Calhoun expected to revise his manuscript before it was printed, but\r\ndeath interrupted his plans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCVII. ENOCH ARDEN AT THE WINDOW. (347)\r\n\r\nAlfred Tennyson, 1809-1892, was born in Somerby, Lincolnshire, England;\r\nhis father was a clergyman noted for his energy and physical stature.\r\nAlfred, with his two older brothers, graduated at Trinity College,\r\nCambridge. His first volume of poems appeared in 1830; it made little\r\nimpression, and was severely treated by the critics. On the publication of\r\nhis third series, in 1842, his poetic genius began to receive general\r\nrecognition. On the death of Wordsworth he was made poet laureate, and he\r\nwas then regarded as the foremost living poet of England. "In Memoriam,"\r\nwritten in memory of his friend Arthur Hallam, appeared in 1850; the\r\n"Idyls of the King," in 1858; and "Enoch Arden," a touching story in\r\nverse, from which the following selection is taken, was published in 1864.\r\nIn 1883 he accepted a peerage as Baron Tennyson of Aldworth, Sussex, and\r\nof Freshwater, Isle of Wight.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\n  But Enoch yearned to see her face again;\r\n"If I might look on her sweet face again\r\nAnd know that she is happy." So the thought\r\nHaunted and harassed him, and drove him forth,\r\nAt evening when the dull November day\r\nWas growing duller twilight, to the hill.\r\nThere he sat down gazing on all below;\r\nThere did a thousand memories roll upon him,\r\nUnspeakable for sadness. By and by\r\nThe ruddy square of comfortable light,\r\nFar-blazing from the rear of Philip\'s house,\r\nAllured him, as the beacon blaze allures\r\nThe bird of passage, till he mildly strikes\r\nAgainst it, and beats out his weary life.\r\n\r\n  For Philip\'s dwelling fronted on the street,\r\nThe latest house to landward; but behind,\r\nWith one small gate that opened on the waste,\r\nFlourished a little garden, square and walled:\r\nAnd in it throve an ancient evergreen,\r\nA yew tree, and all round it ran a walk\r\nOf shingle, and a walk divided it:\r\nBut Enoch shunned the middle walk, and stole\r\nUp by the wall, behind the yew; and thence\r\nThat which he better might have shunned, if griefs\r\nLike his have worse or better, Enoch saw.\r\n\r\n  For cups and silver on the burnished board\r\nSparkled and shone; so genial was the hearth:\r\nAnd on the right hand of the hearth he saw\r\nPhilip, the slighted suitor of old times,\r\nStout, rosy, with his babe across his knees;\r\nAnd o\'er her second father stooped a girl,\r\nA later but a loftier Annie Lee,\r\nFair-haired and tall, and from her lifted hand\r\nDangled a length of ribbon and a ring\r\nTo tempt the babe, who reared his creasy arms,\r\nCaught at and ever missed it, and they laughed:\r\nAnd on the left hand of the hearth he saw\r\nThe mother glancing often toward her babe,\r\nBut turning now and then to speak with him,\r\nHer son, who stood beside her tall and strong,\r\nAnd saying that which pleased him, for he smiled.\r\n\r\n  Now when the dead man come to life beheld\r\nHis wife, his wife no more, and saw the babe,\r\nHers, yet not his, upon the father\'s knee,\r\nAnd all the warmth, the peace, the happiness.\r\nAnd his own children tall and beautiful,\r\nAnd him, that other, reigning in his place,\r\nLord of his rights and of his children\'s love,\r\nThen he, tho\' Miriam Lane had told him all,\r\nBecause things seen are mightier than things heard,\r\nStaggered and shook, holding the branch, and feared\r\nTo send abroad a shrill and terrible cry,\r\nWhich in one moment, like the blast of doom,\r\nWould shatter all the happiness of the hearth.\r\n\r\n  He, therefore, turning softly like a thief,\r\nLest the harsh shingle should grate underfoot,\r\nAnd feeling all along the garden wall,\r\nLest he should swoon and tumble and be found,\r\nCrept to the gate, and opened it, and closed,\r\nAs lightly as a sick man\'s chamber door,\r\nBehind him, and came out upon the waste.\r\nAnd there he would have knelt but that his knees\r\nWere feeble, so that falling prone he dug\r\nHis fingers into the wet earth, and prayed.\r\n\r\n  "Too hard to bear! why did they take me thence?\r\nO God Almighty, blessed Savior, Thou\r\nThat did\'st uphold me on my lonely isle,\r\nUphold me, Father, in my loneliness\r\nA little longer! aid me, give me strength\r\nNot to tell her, never to let her know.\r\nHelp me not to break in upon her peace.\r\nMy children too! must I not speak to these?\r\nThey know me not. I should betray myself.\r\nNever!--no father\'s kiss for me!--the girl\r\nSo like her mother, and the boy, my son!"\r\n\r\n  There speech and thought and nature failed a little,\r\nAnd he lay tranced; but when he rose and paced\r\nBack toward his solitary home again,\r\nAll down the long and narrow street he went\r\nBeating it in upon his weary brain,\r\nAs tho\' it were the burden of a song,\r\n"Not to tell her, never to let her know."\r\n\r\nNOTE.--Enoch Arden had been wrecked on an uninhabited island, and was\r\nsupposed to be dead. After many years he was rescued, and returned home,\r\nwhere he found his wife happily married a second time. For her happiness,\r\nhe kept his existence a secret, but soon died of a broken heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCVIII. LOCHINVAR. (350)\r\n\r\nOh, young Lochinvar is come out of the west,\r\nThrough all the wide Border his steed was the best;\r\nAnd save his good broadsword, he weapon had none,\r\nHe rode all unarmed, and he rode all alone!\r\nSo faithful in love, and so dauntless in war,\r\nThere never was knight like the young Lochinvar!\r\n\r\nHe stayed not for brake, and he stopped not for stone,\r\nHe swam the Eske River where ford there was none;\r\nBut ere he alighted at Netherby gate,\r\nThe bride had consented, the gallant came late:\r\nFor a laggard in love, and a dastard in war,\r\nWas to wed the fair Ellen of brave Lochinvar!\r\n\r\nSo boldly he entered the Netherby hall,\r\nAmong bridesmen, and kinsmen, and brothers, and all:\r\nThen spoke the bride\'s father, his hand on his sword--\r\nFor the poor craven bridegroom said never a word--\r\n"Oh, come ye in peace here, or come ye in war,\r\nOr to dance at our bridal, young Lord Lochinvar?"\r\n\r\n"I long wooed your daughter, my suit you denied;--\r\nLove swells like the Solway, but ebbs like its tide--\r\nAnd now am I come, with this lost love of mine,\r\nTo lead but one measure, drink one cup of wine.\r\nThere are maidens in Scotland more lovely by far,\r\nThat would gladly be bride to the young Lochinvar."\r\n\r\nThe bride kissed the goblet; the knight took it up,\r\nHe quaffed off the wine, and he threw down the cup.\r\nShe looked down to blush, and she looked up to sigh,\r\nWith a smile on her lips, and a tear in her eye.\r\nHe took her soft hand, ere her mother could bar,\r\n"Now tread we a measure!" said young Lochinvar.\r\n\r\nSo stately his form, and so lovely her face,\r\nThat never a hall such a galliard did grace;\r\nWhile her mother did fret, and her father did fume,\r\nAnd the bridegroom stood dangling his bonnet and plume;\r\nAnd the bridemaidens whispered, "\'Twere better by far\r\nTo have matched our fair cousin with young Lochinvar."\r\n\r\nOne touch to her hand, and one word in her ear,\r\nWhen they reached the hall door, and the charger stood near,\r\nSo light to the croup the fair lady he swung,\r\nSo light to the saddle before her he sprung!\r\n"She is won! we are gone, over bank, bush, and scaur:\r\nThey\'ll have fleet steeds that follow," quoth young Lochinvar.\r\n\r\nThere was mounting \'mong Graemes of the Netherby clan;\r\nForsters, Fenwicks, and Musgraves, they rode and they ran;\r\nThere was racing and chasing on Cannobie Lee,\r\nBut the lost bride of Netherby ne\'er did they see.\r\nSo daring in love, and so dauntless in war,\r\nHave ye e\'er heard of gallant like young Lochinvar?\r\n                                                      -- Walter Scott.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--The above selection is a song taken from Scott\'s poem of\r\n"Marmion." It is in a slight degree founded on a ballad called "Katharine\r\nJanfarie," to be found in the "Minstrelsy of the Scottish Border."\r\n\r\nThe Solway Frith, on the southwest coast of Scotland, is remarkable for\r\nits high spring tides.\r\n\r\nBonnet is the ordinary name in Scotland for a man\'s cap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCIX.  SPEECH ON THE TRIAL OF A MURDERER. (352)\r\n\r\nAgainst the prisoner at the bar, as an individual, I can not have the\r\nslightest prejudice. I would not do him the smallest injury or injustice.\r\nBut I do not affect to be indifferent to the discovery and the punishment\r\nof this deep guilt. I cheerfully share in the opprobrium, how much soever\r\nit may be, which is cast on those who feel and manifest an anxious concern\r\nthat all who had a part in planning, or a hand in executing this deed of\r\nmidnight assassination, may be brought to answer for their enormous crime\r\nat the bar of public justice.\r\n\r\nThis is a most extraordinary case. In some respects it has hardly a\r\nprecedent anywhere; certainly none in our New England history. This bloody\r\ndrama exhibited no suddenly excited, ungovernable rage. The actors in it\r\nwere not surprised by any lionlike temptation springing upon their virtue,\r\nand overcoming it before resistance could begin. Nor did they do the deed\r\nto glut savage vengeance, or satiate long-settled and deadly hate. It was\r\na cool, calculating, money-making murder. It was all "hire and salary, not\r\nrevenge." It was the weighing of money against life; the counting out of\r\nso many pieces of silver against so many ounces of blood.\r\n\r\nAn aged man, without an enemy in the world, in his own house, and in his\r\nown bed, is made the victim of a butcherly murder for mere pay. Truly,\r\nhere is a new lesson for painters and poets. Whoever shall hereafter draw\r\nthe portrait of murder, if he will show it as it has been exhibited in an\r\nexample, where such example was last to have been looked for, in the very\r\nbosom of our New England society, let him not give it the grim visage of\r\nMoloch, the brow knitted by revenge, the face black with settled hate, and\r\nthe bloodshot eye emitting livid fires of malice. Let him draw, rather, a\r\ndecorous, smooth-faced, bloodless demon; a picture in repose, rather than\r\nin action; not so much an example of human nature in its depravity, and in\r\nits paroxysms of crime, as an infernal nature, a fiend in the ordinary\r\ndisplay and development of his character.\r\n\r\nThe deed was executed with a degree of self-possession and steadiness\r\nequal to the wickedness with which it was planned. The circumstances, now\r\nclearly in evidence, spread out the whole scene before us. Deep sleep had\r\nfallen on the destined victim, and on all beneath his roof. A healthful\r\nold man, to whom sleep was sweet,--the first sound slumbers of the night\r\nheld him in their soft but strong embrace. The assassin enters through the\r\nwindow, already prepared, into an unoccupied apartment. With noiseless\r\nfoot he paces the lonely hall, half-lighted by the moon; he winds up the\r\nascent of the stairs, and reaches the door of the chamber. Of this, he\r\nmoves the lock by soft and continued pressure till it turns on its hinges\r\nwithout noise; and he enters, and beholds his victim before him. The room\r\nwas uncommonly open to the admission of light. The face of the innocent\r\nsleeper was turned from the murderer, and the beams of the moon, resting\r\non the gray locks of his aged temple, showed him where to strike. The\r\nfatal blow is given! and the victim passes, without a struggle or a\r\nmotion, from the repose of sleep to the repose of death!\r\n\r\nIt is the assassin\'s purpose to make sure work; and he yet plies the\r\ndagger, though it was obvious that life had been destroyed by the blow of\r\nthe bludgeon. He even raises the aged arm, that he may not fail in his aim\r\nat the heart; and replaces it again over the wounds of the poniard! To\r\nfinish the picture, he explores the wrist for the pulse! He feels for it,\r\nand ascertains that it beats no longer! It is accomplished. The deed is\r\ndone. He retreats, retraces his steps to the window, passes out through it\r\nas he came in, and escapes. He has done the murder; no eye has seen him,\r\nno ear has heard him. The secret is his own, and it is safe!\r\n\r\nAh! gentlemen, that was a dreadful mistake. Such a secret can be safe\r\nnowhere. The whole creation of God has neither nook nor corner where the\r\nguilty can bestow it, and say it is safe. Not to speak of that eye which\r\nglances through all disguises, and beholds everything as in the splendor\r\nof noon; such secrets of guilt are never safe from detection, even by men.\r\nTrue it is, generally speaking, that "murder will out." True it is that\r\nProvidence hath so ordained, and doth so govern things, that those who\r\nbreak the great law of Heaven by shedding man\'s blood, seldom succeed in\r\navoiding discovery. Especially, in a case exciting so much attention as\r\nthis, discovery must come, and wilt come, sooner or later. A thousand eyes\r\nturn at once to explore every man, everything, every circumstance\r\nconnected with the time and place; a thousand ears catch every whisper; a\r\nthousand excited minds intensely dwell on the scene, shedding all their\r\nlight, and ready to kindle the slightest circumstance into a blaze of\r\ndiscovery.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the guilty soul can not keep its own secret. It is false to\r\nitself, or rather it feels an irresistible impulse of conscience to be\r\ntrue to itself. It labors under its guilty possession, and knows not what\r\nto do with it. The human heart was not made for the residence of such an\r\ninhabitant. It finds itself preyed on by a torment, which it dares not\r\nacknowledge to God nor man. A vulture is devouring it, and it can ask no\r\nsympathy or assistance either from heaven or earth. The secret which the\r\nmurderer possesses soon comes to possess him; and, like the evil spirits\r\nof which we read, it overcomes him, and leads him whithersoever it will.\r\nHe feels it beating at his heart, rising to his throat, and demanding\r\ndisclosure. He thinks the whole world sees it in his face, reads it in his\r\neyes, and almost hears its workings in the very silence of his thoughts.\r\nIt has become his master. It betrays his discretion, it breaks down his\r\ncourage, it conquers his prudence. When suspicions from without begin to\r\nembarrass him, and the net of circumstance to entangle him, the fatal\r\nsecret struggles with still greater violence to burst forth. It must be\r\nconfessed, it will be confessed; there is no refuge from confession but\r\nsuicide, and suicide is confession.\r\n                                                       --Daniel Webster.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.--The above extract is from Daniel Webster\'s argument in the trial of\r\nJohn F. Knapp for the murder of Mr. White, a very wealthy and respectable\r\ncitizen of Salem, Mass, Four persons were arrested as being concerned in\r\nthe conspiracy; one confessed the plot and all the details of the crime,\r\nimplicating the others, but he afterwards refused to testify in court. The\r\nman who, by this confession, was the actual murderer, committed suicide,\r\nand Mr. Webster\'s assistance was obtained in prosecuting the others. John\r\nF. Knapp was convicted as principal, and the other two as accessaries in\r\nthe murder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nC. THE CLOSING YEAR. (355)\r\n\r\nGeorge Denison Prentice, 1802-1870, widely known as a political writer, a\r\npoet, and a wit, was born in Preston, Connecticut, and graduated at Brown\r\nUniversity in 1823. He studied law, but never practiced his profession. He\r\nedited a paper in Hartford for two years; and, in 1831, he became editor\r\nof the "Louisville Journal," which position he held for nearly forty\r\nyears. As an editor, Mr. Prentice was an able, and sometimes bitter,\r\npolitical partisan, abounding in wit and satire; as a poet, he not only\r\nwrote gracefully himself, but he did much by his kindness and sympathy to\r\ndevelop the poetical talents of others. Some who have since taken high\r\nrank, first became known to the world through the columns of the\r\n"Louisville Journal."\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\n\'T is midnight\'s holy hour, and silence now\r\nIs brooding like a gentle spirit o\'er\r\nThe still and pulseless world. Hark! on the winds,\r\nThe bell\'s deep notes are swelling; \'t is the knell\r\nOf the departed year.\r\n\r\n                       No funeral train\r\nIs sweeping past; yet, on the stream and wood,\r\nWith melancholy light, the moonbeams rest\r\nLike a pale, spotless shroud; the air is stirred\r\nAs by a mourner\'s sigh; and, on yon cloud,\r\nThat floats so still and placidly through heaven,\r\nThe spirits of the Seasons seem to stand--\r\nYoung Spring, bright Summer, Autumn\'s solemn form,\r\nAnd Winter, with his aged locks--and breathe\r\nIn mournful cadences, that come abroad\r\nLike the far wind harp\'s wild and touching wail,\r\nA melancholy dirge o\'er the dead year,\r\nGone from the earth forever.\r\n\r\n                             \'Tis a time\r\nFor memory and for tears. Within the deep,\r\nStill chambers of the heart, a specter dim,\r\nWhose tones are like the wizard voice of Time,\r\nHeard from the tomb of ages, points its cold\r\nAnd solemn finger to the beautiful\r\nAnd holy visions, that have passed away,\r\nAnd left no shadow of their loveliness\r\nOn the dead waste of life. That specter lifts\r\nThe coffin lid of Hope, and Joy, and Love,\r\nAnd, bending mournfully above the pale,\r\nSweet forms that slumber there, scatters dead flowers\r\nO\'er what has passed to nothingness.\r\n\r\n                                     The year\r\nHas gone, and, with it, many a glorious throng\r\nOf happy dreams. Its mark is on each brow,\r\nIts shadow in each heart. In its swift course\r\nIt waved its scepter o\'er the beautiful,\r\nAnd they are not. It laid its pallid hand\r\nUpon the strong man; and the haughty form\r\nIs fallen, and the flashing eye is dim.\r\nIt trod the hall of revelry, where thronged\r\nThe bright and joyous; and the tearful wail\r\nOf stricken ones is heard, where erst the song\r\nAnd reckless shout resounded. It passed o\'er\r\nThe battle plain, where sword, and spear, and shield\r\nFlashed in the light of midday; and the strength\r\nOf serried hosts is shivered, and the grass,\r\nGreen from the soil of carnage, waves above\r\nThe crushed and moldering skeleton. It came,\r\nAnd faded like a wreath of mist at eve;\r\nYet, ere it melted in the viewless air,\r\nIt heralded its millions to their home\r\nIn the dim land of dreams.\r\n\r\n                            Remorseless Time!--\r\nFierce spirit of the glass and scythe!--what power\r\nCan stay him in his silent course, or melt\r\nHis iron heart to pity! On, still on\r\nHe presses, and forever. The proud bird,\r\nThe condor of the Andes, that can soar\r\nThrough heaven\'s unfathomable depths, or brave\r\nThe fury of the northern hurricane,\r\nAnd bathe his plumage in the thunder\'s home,\r\nFurls his broad wings at nightfall, and sinks down\r\nTo rest upon his mountain crag; but Time\r\nKnows not the weight of sleep or weariness;\r\nAnd Night\'s deep darkness has no chain to bind\r\nHis rushing pinion.\r\n\r\n                    Revolutions sweep\r\nO\'er earth, like troubled visions o\'er the breast\r\nOf dreaming sorrow; cities rise and sink\r\nLike bubbles on the water; fiery isles\r\nSpring blazing from the ocean, and go back\r\nTo their mysterious caverns; mountains rear\r\nTo heaven their bald and blackened cliffs, and bow\r\nTheir tall heads to the plain; new empires rise,\r\nGathering the strength of hoary centuries,\r\nAnd rush down, like the Alpine avalanche,\r\nStartling the nations; and the very stars,\r\nYon bright and burning blazonry of God,\r\nGlitter awhile in their eternal depths,\r\nAnd, like the Pleiad, loveliest of their train,\r\nShoot from their glorious spheres, and pass away,\r\nTo darkle in the trackless void; yet Time,\r\nTime the tomb builder, holds his fierce career,\r\nDark, stern, all pitiless, and pauses not\r\nAmid the mighty wrecks that strew his path,\r\nTo sit and muse, like other conquerors,\r\nUpon the fearful ruin he has wrought.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCI. A NEW CITY IN COLORADO. (358)\r\n\r\nHelen Hunt Jackson, 1830-1885, was the daughter of the late Professor\r\nNathan W. Fiske, of Amherst College. She was born in Amherst, and educated\r\nat Ipswich, Massachusetts, and at New York. Mrs. Jackson was twice\r\nmarried. In the latter years of her life, she became deeply interested in\r\nthe Indians, and wrote two books, "Ramona," a novel, and "A Century of\r\nDishonor," setting forth vividly the wrongs to which the red race has been\r\nsubjected. She had previously published several books of prose and poetry,\r\nless important but charming in their way. The following selection is\r\nadapted from "Bits of Travel at Home."\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nGarland City is six miles from Fort Garland. The road to it from the fort\r\nlies for the last three miles on the top of a sage-grown plateau. It is\r\nstraight as an arrow, looks in the distance like a brown furrow on the\r\npale gray plain, and seems to pierce the mountains beyond. Up to within an\r\neighth of a mile of Garland City, there is no trace of human habitation.\r\nKnowing that the city must be near, you look in all directions for a\r\nglimpse of it; the hills ahead of you rise sharply across your way. Where\r\nis the city? At your very feet, but you do not suspect it.\r\n\r\nThe sunset light was fading when we reached the edge of the ravine in\r\nwhich the city lies. It was like looking unawares over the edge of a\r\nprecipice; the gulch opened beneath us as suddenly as if the earth had\r\nthat moment parted and made it. With brakes set firm, we drove cautiously\r\ndown the steep road; the ravine twinkled with lights, and almost seemed to\r\nflutter with white tents and wagon tops. At the farther end it widened,\r\nopening out on an inlet of the San Luis Park; and, in its center, near\r\nthis widening mouth, lay the twelve-days-old city. A strange din arose\r\nfrom it.\r\n\r\n"What is going on?" we exclaimed. "The building of the city," was the\r\nreply. "Twelve days ago there was not a house here. To-day there are one\r\nhundred and five, and in a week more there will be two hundred; each man\r\nis building his own home, and working day and night to get it done ahead\r\nof his neighbor. There are four sawmills going constantly, but they can\'t\r\nturn out lumber half fast enough. Everybody has to be content with a board\r\nat a time. If it were not for that, there would have been twice as many\r\nhouses done as there are."\r\n\r\nWe drove on down the ravine. A little creek on our right was half hid in\r\nwillow thickets. Hundreds of white tents gleamed among them: tents with\r\npoles; tents made by spreading sailcloth over the tops of bushes; round\r\ntents; square tents; big tents; little tents; and for every tent a camp\r\nfire; hundreds of white-topped wagons, also, at rest for the night, their\r\ngreat poles propped up by sticks, and their mules and drivers lying and\r\nstanding in picturesque groups around them.\r\n\r\nIt was a scene not to be forgotten. Louder and louder sounded the chorus\r\nof the hammers as we drew near the center of the "city;" more and more the\r\nbustle thickened; great ox teams swaying unwieldily about, drawing logs\r\nand planks, backing up steep places; all sorts of vehicles driving at\r\nreckless speed up and down; men carrying doors; men walking along inside\r\nof window sashes,--the easiest way to carry them; men shoveling; men\r\nwheeling wheelbarrows; not a man standing still; not a man with empty\r\nhands; every man picking up something, and running to put it down\r\nsomewhere else, as in a play; and, all the while, "Clink! clink! clink!"\r\nringing above the other sounds,--the strokes of hundreds of hammers, like\r\nthe "Anvil Chorus."\r\n\r\n"Where is Perry\'s Hotel?" we asked. One of the least busy of the throng\r\nspared time to point to it with his thumb, as he passed us. In some\r\nbewilderment we drew up in front of a large unfinished house, through the\r\nmany uncased apertures of which we could see only scaffoldings, rough\r\nboards, carpenters\' benches, and heaps of shavings. Streams of men were\r\npassing in and out through these openings, which might be either doors or\r\nwindows; no steps led to any of them.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes! oh, yes! can accommodate you all!" was the landlord\'s reply to\r\nour hesitating inquiries. He stood in the doorway of his dining-room; the\r\nstreams of men we had seen going in and out were the fed and the unfed\r\nguests of the house. It was supper time; we also were hungry. We peered\r\ninto the dining room: three tables full of men; a huge pile of beds on the\r\nfloor, covered with hats and coats; a singular wall, made entirely of\r\ndoors propped upright; a triangular space walled off by sailcloth,--this\r\nis what we saw. We stood outside, waiting among the scaffolding and\r\nbenches. A black man was lighting the candles in a candelabrum made of two\r\nnarrow bars of wood nailed across each other at right angles, and\r\nperforated with holes. The candles sputtered, and the hot fat fell on the\r\nshavings below.\r\n\r\n"Dangerous way of lighting a room full of shavings," some one said. The\r\nlandlord looked up at the swinging candelabra and laughed. "Tried it\r\npretty often," he said. "Never burned a house down yet."\r\n\r\nI observed one peculiarity in the speech at Garland City. Personal\r\npronouns, as a rule, were omitted; there was no time for a superfluous\r\nword.\r\n\r\n"Took down this house at Wagon Creek," he continued, "just one week ago;\r\ntook it down one morning while the people were eating breakfast; took it\r\ndown over their heads; putting it up again over their heads now."\r\n\r\nThis was literally true. The last part of it we ourselves were seeing\r\nwhile he spoke, and a friend at our elbow had seen the Wagon Creek crisis.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Waiting for that round table for you," said the landlord; " \'ll bring the\r\nchairs out here\'s fast\'s they quit \'em. That\'s the only way to get the\r\ntable."\r\n\r\nSo, watching his chances, as fast as a seat was vacated, he sprang into\r\nthe room, seized the chair and brought it out to us; and we sat there in\r\nour "reserved seats," biding the time when there should be room enough\r\nvacant at the table for us to take our places.\r\n\r\nWhat an indescribable scene it was! The strange-looking wall of propped\r\ndoors which we had seen, was the impromptu, wall separating the bedrooms\r\nfrom the dining-room. Bedrooms? Yes, five of them; that is, five\r\nbedsteads in a row, with just space enough between them to hang up a\r\nsheet, and with just room enough between them and the propped doors for a\r\nmoderate-sized person to stand upright if he faced either the doors or the\r\nbed. Chairs? Oh, no! What do you want of a chair in a bedroom which has a\r\nbed in it? Washstands? One tin basin out in the unfinished room. Towels?\r\nUncertain.\r\n\r\nThe little triangular space walled off by the sailcloth was a sixth\r\nbedroom, quite private and exclusive; and the big pile of beds on the\r\ndining-room floor was to be made up into seven bedrooms more between the\r\ntables, after everybody had finished supper.\r\n\r\nLuckily for us we found a friend here,--a man who has been from the\r\nbeginning one of Colorado\'s chief pioneers; and who is never, even in the\r\nwildest wilderness, without resources of comfort.\r\n\r\n"You can\'t sleep here," he said. "I can do better for you than this."\r\n\r\n"Better!"\r\n\r\nHe offered us luxury. How movable a thing is one\'s standard of comfort! A\r\ntwo-roomed pine shanty, board walls, board floors, board ceilings, board\r\npartitions not reaching to the roof, looked to us that night like a\r\npalace. To have been entertained at Windsor Castle would not have made us\r\nhalf so grateful.\r\n\r\nIt was late before the "city" grew quiet; and, long after most of the\r\nlights were out, and most of the sounds had ceased, I heard one solitary\r\nhammer in the distance, clink, clink, clink. I fell asleep listening to\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCII. IMPORTANCE OF THE UNION. (362)\r\n\r\nMr. President: I am conscious of having detained you and the Senate much\r\ntoo long. I was drawn into the debate with no previous deliberation, such\r\nas is suited to the discussion of so grave and important a subject. But it\r\nis a subject of which my heart is full, and I have not been willing to\r\nsuppress the utterance of its spontaneous sentiments. I can not, even now,\r\npersuade myself to relinquish it, without expressing once more my deep\r\nconviction, that, since it respects nothing less than the union of the\r\nstates, it is of most vital and essential importance to the public\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nI profess, sir, in my career hitherto, to have kept steadily in view the\r\nprosperity and honor of the whole country, and the preservation of our\r\nfederal Union. It is to that Union we owe our safety at home, and our\r\nconsideration and dignity abroad. It is to that Union that we are chiefly\r\nindebted for whatever makes us most proud of our country. That Union we\r\nreached only by the discipline of our virtues, in the severe school of\r\nadversity. It had its origin in the necessities of disordered finance,\r\nprostrate commerce, and ruined credit. Under its benign influences, these\r\ngreat interests immediately awoke, as from the dead, and sprang forth with\r\nnewness of life. Every year of its duration has teemed with fresh proofs\r\nof its utility and its blessings; and, although our territory has\r\nstretched out wider and wider, and our population spread farther and\r\nfarther, they have not outrun its protection or its benefits. It has been\r\nto us all a copious fountain of national, social, and personal happiness.\r\n\r\nI have not allowed myself, sir, to look beyond the Union, to see what\r\nmight lie hidden in the dark recess behind. I have not coolly weighed the\r\nchances of preserving liberty, when the bonds that unite us together shall\r\nbe broken asunder. I have not accustomed myself to hang over the precipice\r\nof disunion, to see whether, with my short sight, I can fathom the depth\r\nof the abyss below; nor could I regard him as a safe counselor in the\r\naffairs of this government, whose thoughts should be mainly bent on\r\nconsidering, not how the Union should be best preserved, but how tolerable\r\nmight be the condition of the people when it shall be broken up and\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nWhile the Union lasts, we have high, exciting, gratifying prospects spread\r\nout before us, for us and our children. Beyond that, I seek not to\r\npenetrate the veil. God grant that in my day, at least, that curtain may\r\nnot rise. God grant that on my vision never may be opened what lies\r\nbehind. When my eyes shall be turned to behold, for the last time, the sun\r\nin heaven, may I not see him shining on the broken and dishonored\r\nfragments of a once glorious Union; on States dissevered, discordant,\r\nbelligerent; on a land rent with civil feuds, or drenched, it may be, in\r\nfraternal blood.\r\n\r\nLet their last feeble and lingering glance rather behold the gorgeous\r\nensign of the Republic, now known and honored throughout the earth, still\r\nfull high advanced, its arms and trophies streaming in their original\r\nluster, not a stripe erased or polluted, not a single star\r\nobscured--bearing for its motto no such miserable interrogatory as, What\r\nis all this worth? nor those other words of delusion and folly, Liberty\r\nfirst, and Union afterwards--but everywhere, spread all over in characters\r\nof living light, blazing on all its ample folds, as they float over the\r\nsea and over the land, and in every wind under the whole heavens, that\r\nother sentiment, dear to every true American heart--Liberty and Union, now\r\nand forever, one and inseparable!\r\n                                                        --Daniel Webster.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--This selection is the peroration of Mr. Webster\'s speech in reply\r\nto Mr. Hayne during the debate in the Senate on Mr. Foot\'s Resolution in\r\nregard to the Public Lands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCIII. THE INFLUENCES OF THE SUN. (364)\r\n\r\nJohn Tyndall, 1820-1893, one of the most celebrated modern\r\nscientists, was an Irishman by birth. He was a pupil of the distinguished\r\nFaraday. In 1853 he was appointed Professor of Natural Philosophy in the\r\nRoyal Institution of London. He is known chiefly for his brilliant\r\nexperiments and clear writing respecting heat, light, and sound. He also\r\nwrote one or two interesting books concerning the Alps and their glaciers.\r\nHe visited America, and delighted the most intelligent audiences by his\r\nscientific lectures and his brilliant experiments. The scientific world is\r\nindebted to him for several remarkable discoveries.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nAs surely as the force which moves a clock\'s hands is derived from the arm\r\nwhich winds up the clock, so surely is all terrestrial power drawn from\r\nthe sun. Leaving out of account the eruptions of volcanoes, and the ebb\r\nand flow of the tides, every mechanical action on the earth\'s surface,\r\nevery manifestation of power, organic and inorganic, vital and physical,\r\nis produced by the sun. His warmth keeps the sea liquid, and the\r\natmosphere a gas, and all the storms which agitate both are blown by the\r\nmechanical force of the sun. He lifts the rivers and the glaciers up to\r\nthe mountains; and thus the cataract and the avalanche shoot with an\r\nenergy derived immediately from him.\r\n\r\nThunder and lightning are also his transmitted strength. Every fire that\r\nburns and every flame that glows, dispenses light and heat which\r\noriginally belonged to the sun. In these days, unhappily, the news of\r\nbattle is familiar to us, but every shock and every charge is an\r\napplication or misapplication of the mechanical force of the sun. He blows\r\nthe trumpet, he urges the projectile, he bursts the bomb. And, remember,\r\nthis is not poetry, but rigid mechanical truth.\r\n\r\nHe rears, as I have said, the whole vegetable world, and through it the\r\nanimal; the lilies of the field are his workmanship, the verdure of the\r\nmeadows, and the cattle upon a thousand hills. He forms the muscles, he\r\nurges the blood, he builds the brain. His fleetness is in the lion\'s foot;\r\nhe springs in the panther, he soars in the eagle, he slides in the snake.\r\nHe builds the forest and hews it down, the power which raised the tree,\r\nand which wields the ax, being one and the same. The clover sprouts and\r\nblossoms, and the scythe of the mower swings, by the operation of the same\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nThe sun digs the ore from our mines, he rolls the iron; he rivets the\r\nplates, he boils the water; he draws the train. He not only grows the\r\ncotton, but he spins the fiber and weaves the web. There is not a hammer\r\nraised, a wheel turned, or a shuttle thrown, that is not raised, and\r\nturned, and thrown by the sun.\r\n\r\nHis energy is poured freely into space, but our world is a halting place\r\nwhere this energy is conditioned. Here the Proteus works his spells; the\r\nselfsame essence takes a million shapes and hues, and finally dissolves\r\ninto its primitive and almost formless form. The sun comes to us as heat;\r\nhe quits us as heat; and between his entrance and departure the multiform\r\npowers of our globe appear. They are all special forms of solar power--the\r\nmolds into which his strength is temporarily poured in passing from its\r\nsource through infinitude.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--Proteus (pro. Pro\'te-us) was a mythological divinity. His\r\ndistinguishing characteristic was the power of assuming different shapes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCIV. COLLOQUIAL POWERS OF FRANKLIN. (366)\r\n\r\nWilliam Wirt, 1772-1834, an American lawyer and author, was born at\r\nBladensburg, Maryland. Left an orphan at an early age, he was placed in\r\ncare of his uncle. He improved his opportunities for education so well\r\nthat he became a private tutor at fifteen. In 1792 he was admitted to the\r\nbar, and began the practice of law in Virginia; he removed to Richmond in\r\n1799. From 1817 to 1829 he was Attorney-general of the United States. His\r\nlast years were spent in Baltimore. Mr. Wirt was the author of several\r\nbooks; his "Letters of a British Spy," published in 1803, and "Life of\r\nPatrick Henry," published in 1817, are the best known of his writings.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nNever have I known such a fireside companion. Great as he was both as a\r\nstatesman and philosopher, he never shone in a light more winning than\r\nwhen he was seen in a domestic circle. It was once my good fortune to pass\r\ntwo or three weeks with him, at the house of a private gentleman, in the\r\nback part of Pennsylvania, and we were confined to the house during the\r\nwhole of that time by the unintermitting constancy and depth of the snows.\r\nBut confinement never could be felt where Franklin was an inmate; His\r\ncheerfulness and his colloquial powers spread around him a perpetual\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nWhen I speak, however, of his colloquial powers, I do not mean to awaken\r\nany notion analogous to that which Boswell has given us of Johnson. The\r\nconversation of the latter continually reminds one of the "pomp and\r\ncircumstance of glorious war." It was, indeed, a perpetual contest for\r\nvictory, or an arbitrary or despotic exaction of homage to his superior\r\ntalents. It was strong, acute, prompt, splendid, and vociferous; as loud,\r\nstormy, and sublime as those winds which he represents as shaking the\r\nHebrides, and rocking the old castle which frowned on the dark-rolling sea\r\nbeneath.\r\n\r\nBut one gets tired of storms, however sublime they may be, and longs for\r\nthe more orderly current of nature. Of Franklin, no one ever became tired.\r\nThere was no ambition of eloquence, no effort to shine in anything which\r\ncame from him. There was nothing which made any demand upon either your\r\nallegiance or your admiration. His manner was as unaffected as infancy. It\r\nwas nature\'s self. He talked like an old patriarch; and his plainness and\r\nsimplicity put you at once at your ease, and gave you the full and free\r\npossession and use of your faculties. His thoughts were of a character to\r\nshine by their own light, without any adventitious aid. They only required\r\na medium of vision like his pure and simple style, to exhibit to the\r\nhighest advantage their native radiance and beauty.\r\n\r\nHis cheerfulness was unremitting. It seemed to be as much the effect of a\r\nsystematic and salutary exercise of the mind, as of its superior\r\norganization. His wit was of the first order. It did not show itself\r\nmerely in occasional coruscations[1]; but, without any effort or force on\r\nhis part, it shed a constant stream of the purest light over the whole of\r\nhis discourse. Whether in the company of commons or nobles, he was always\r\nthe same plain man; always most perfectly at his ease, with his faculties\r\nin full play, and the full orbit of his genius forever clear and\r\nunclouded.\r\n\r\n[Transcriber\'s Footnote 1: coruscations: flashes of light.]\r\n\r\nAnd then, the stores of his mind were inexhaustible. He had commenced life\r\nwith an attention so vigilant that nothing had escaped his observation;\r\nand a judgment so solid that every incident was turned to advantage. His\r\nyouth had not been wasted in idleness, nor overcast by intemperance. He\r\nhad been, all his life, a close and deep reader, as well as thinker; and\r\nby the force of his own powers, had wrought up the raw materials which he\r\nhad gathered from books, with such exquisite skill and felicity, that he\r\nhas added a hundred fold to their original value, and justly made them his\r\nown.\r\n\r\nNOTES.--Benjamin Franklin (b. 1706, d. 1790) was one of the most prominent\r\nmen in the struggle of the American colonies for liberty. He was renowned\r\nas a statesman, and, although not an author by profession, was a very\r\nprolific writer. His "Autobiography," which was first printed in France,\r\nis now a household volume in America. See page 431.\r\n\r\nBoswell, James, (b. 1740, d. 1795,) was a Scotch lawyer, and is chiefly\r\nknown as the biographer of Dr. Johnson, of whom he was the intimate friend\r\nand companion.\r\n\r\nJohnson, Samuel.

Why looks your grace so heavily to-day?\r\nClar. O, I have passed a miserable night,\r\n      So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,\r\n      That, as I am a Christian, faithful man,\r\n      I would not spend another such a night,\r\n      Though \'t were to buy a world of happy days,\r\n      So full of dismal terror was the time!\r\nBrak. What was your dream? I long to hear you tell it.\r\nClar. Methoughts, that I had broken from the Tower,\r\n      And was embarked to cross to Burgundy;\r\n      And, in my company, my brother Gloster;\r\n      Who, from my cabin, tempted me to walk\r\n      Upon the hatches; thence we looked toward England,\r\n      And cited up a thousand fearful times,\r\n      During the wars of York and Lancaster,\r\n      That had befallen us. As we paced along\r\n      Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,\r\n      Methought that Gloster stumbled; and, in falling,\r\n      Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,\r\n      Into the tumbling billows of the main.\r\n      Oh, then, methought, what pain it was to drown!\r\n      What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!\r\n      What ugly sights of death within mine eyes!\r\n      Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;\r\n      Ten thousand men that fishes gnawed upon;\r\n      Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,\r\n      Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,\r\n      All scattered in the bottom of the sea.\r\n      Some lay in dead men\'s skulls; and, in those holes\r\n      Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,\r\n      As \'t were in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,\r\n      Which wooed the slimy bottom of the deep,\r\n      And mocked the dead bones that lay scattered by.\r\nBrak. Had you such leisure in the time of death,\r\n      To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?\r\nClar. Methought I had; and often did I strive\r\n      To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood\r\n      Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth\r\n      To seek the empty, vast, and wandering air;\r\n      But smothered it within my panting bulk,\r\n      Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.\r\nBrak. Awaked you not with this sore agony?\r\nClar. Oh, no; my dream was lengthened after life;\r\n      Oh, then began the tempest to my soul,\r\n      Who passed, methought, the melancholy flood,\r\n      With that grim ferryman which poets write of,\r\n      Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.\r\n      The first that there did greet my stranger soul,\r\n      Was my great father-in-law, renowne\'d Warwick;\r\n      Who cried aloud, "What scourge for perjury\r\n      Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?"\r\n      And so he vanished. Then came wandering by\r\n      A shadow like an angel, with bright hair\r\n      Dabbled in blood; and he shrieked out aloud:\r\n      "Clarence is come! false, fleeting, perjured Clarence!\r\n      That stabbed me in the field by Tewksbury:\r\n      Seize on him, Furies, take him to your torments!"\r\n      With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends\r\n      Environed me, and howled in mine ears\r\n      Such hideous cries, that, with the very noise,\r\n      I, trembling, waked, and, for a season after,\r\n      Could not believe but that I was in hell;\r\n      Such terrible impression made the dream.\r\nBrak. No marvel, lord, though it affrighted you;\r\n      I am afraid, methinks, to hear you tell it.\r\nClar. O Brakenbury, I have done those things,\r\n      Which now bear evidence against my soul,\r\n      For Edward\'s sake; and see how he requites me!\r\n      O God! if my deep prayers can not appease thee,\r\n      But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,\r\n      Yet execute thy wrath in me alone:\r\n      Oh, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!\r\n      --I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;\r\n      My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.\r\nBrak. I will, my lord: God give your grace good rest!\r\n\r\n          CLARENCE reposes himself on a chair.\r\n\r\n      Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,\r\n      Makes the night morning, and the noontide night.\r\n\r\n                          Shakespeare.--Richard III, Act i, Scene iv.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--The houses of York and Lancaster were at war for the possession of\r\nthe English throne. The Duke of Clarence and the Duke of Gloster were\r\nbrothers of King Edward IV., who was head of the house of  York. Clarence\r\nmarried the daughter of the Earl of Warwick, and joined the latter in\r\nseveral insurrections against the king. They finally plotted with Queen\r\nMargaret of the Lancaster party for the restoration of the latter house to\r\nthe English throne, but Clarence betrayed Warwick and the Queen, and\r\nkilled the latter\'s son at the battle of Tewksbury. Through the plots of\r\nGloster, Clarence was imprisoned in the Tower of London, and there\r\nmurdered.\r\n\r\nBrakenbury was lieutenant of the Tower.\r\n\r\nThe ferryman referred to is Charon, of Greek mythology, who was supposed\r\nto ferry the souls of the dead over the river Acheron to the infernal\r\nregions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCVI. HOMEWARD BOUND. (371)\r\n\r\nRichard H. Dana, Jr., 1815-1882, was the son of Richard H. Dana, the poet.\r\nHe was born in Cambridge, Mass. In his boyhood be had a strong desire to\r\nbe a sailor, but by his father\'s advice chose a student\'s life, and\r\nentered Harvard University. At the age of nineteen an affection of the\r\neyes compelled him to suspend his studies. He now made a voyage to\r\nCalifornia as a common sailor, and was gone two years. On his return, he\r\nresumed his studies and graduated in 1837. He afterwards studied law, and\r\nentered upon an active and successful practice. Most of his life was spent\r\nin law and politics, although he won distinction in literature.\r\n\r\nThe following extract is from his "Two Years before the Mast," a book\r\npublished in 1840, giving an account of his voyage to California. This\r\nbook details, in a most clear and entertaining manner, the everyday life\r\nof a common sailor on shipboard, and is the best known of all Mr. Dana\'s\r\nworks.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is usual, in voyages round the Cape from the Pacific, to keep to the\r\neastward of the Falkland Islands; but, as there had now set in a strong,\r\nsteady, and clear southwester, with every prospect of its lasting, and we\r\nhad had enough of high latitudes, the captain determined to stand\r\nimmediately to the northward, running inside the Falkland Islands.\r\nAccordingly, when the wheel was relieved at eight o\'clock, the order was\r\ngiven to keep her due north, and all hands were turned up to square away\r\nthe yards and make sail.\r\n\r\nIn a moment the news ran through the ship that the captain was keeping her\r\noff, with her nose straight for Boston, and Cape Horn over her taffrail.\r\nIt was a moment of enthusiasm. Everyone was on the alert, and even the two\r\nsick men turned out to lend a hand at the halyards. The wind was now due\r\nsouthwest, and blowing a gale to which a vessel close-hauled could have\r\nshown no more than a single close-reefed sail; but as we were going before\r\nit, we could carry on. Accordingly, hands were sent aloft and a reef\r\nshaken out of the topsails, and the reefed foresail set. When we came to\r\nmasthead the topsail yards, with all hands at the halyards, we struck up,\r\n"Cheerly, men," with a chorus which might have been heard halfway to\r\nStaten Island.\r\n\r\nUnder her increased sail, the ship drove on through the water. Yet she\r\ncould bear it well; and the captain sang out from the quarter-deck--\r\n"Another reef out of that fore topsail, and give it to her." Two hands\r\nsprang aloft; the frozen reef points and earings were cast adrift, the\r\nhalyards manned, and the sail gave out her increased canvas to the gale.\r\nAll hands were kept on deck to watch the effect of the change. It was as\r\nmuch as she could well carry, and with a heavy sea astern, it took two men\r\nat the wheel to steer her.\r\n\r\nShe flung the foam from her bows; the spray breaking aft as far as the\r\ngangway. She was going at a prodigious rate. Still, everything held.\r\nPreventer braces were reeved and hauled taut; tackles got upon the\r\nbackstays; and everything done to keep all snug and strong. The captain\r\nwalked the deck at a rapid stride, looked aloft at the sails, and then to\r\nwindward; the mate stood in the gangway, rubbing his hands, and talking\r\naloud to the ship--"Hurrah, old bucket! the Boston girls have got hold of\r\nthe towrope!" and the like; and we were on the forecastle looking to see\r\nhow the spars stood it, and guessing the rate at which she was\r\ngoing,--when the captain called out--"Mr. Brown, get up the topmast\r\nstudding sail! What she can\'t carry she may drag!"\r\n\r\nThe mate looked a moment; but he would let no one be before him in daring.\r\nHe sprang forward,--"Hurrah, men! rig out the topmast studding sail boom!\r\nLay aloft, and I\'ll send the rigging up to you!" We sprang aloft into the\r\ntop; lowered a girtline down, by which we hauled up the rigging; rove the\r\ntacks and halyards; ran out the boom and lashed it fast, and sent down the\r\nlower halyards as a preventer. It was a clear starlight night, cold and\r\nblowing; but everybody worked with a will. Some, indeed, looked as though\r\nthey thought the "old man" was mad, but no one said a word.\r\n\r\nWe had had a new topmast studding sail made with a reef in it,--a thing\r\nhardly ever heard of, and which the sailors had ridiculed a good deal,\r\nsaying that when it was time to reef a studding sail it was time to take\r\nit in. But we found a use for it now; for, there being a reef in the\r\ntopsail, the studding sail could not be set without one in it also. To be\r\nsure, a studding sail with reefed topsails was rather a novelty; yet there\r\nwas some reason in it, for if we carried that away, we should lose only a\r\nsail and a boom; but a whole topsail might have carried away the mast and\r\nall.\r\n\r\nWhile we were aloft, the sail had been got out, bent to the yard, reefed,\r\nand ready for hoisting. Waiting for a good opportunity, the halyards were\r\nmanned and the yard hoisted fairly up to the block; but when the mate came\r\nto shake the cat\'s-paw out of the downhaul, and we began to boom end the\r\nsail, it shook the ship to her center. The boom buckled up and bent like a\r\nwhipstick, and we looked every moment to see something go; but, being of\r\nthe short, tough upland spruce, it bent like whalebone, and nothing could\r\nbreak it. The carpenter said it was the best stick he had ever seen.\r\n\r\nThe strength of all hands soon brought the tack to the boom end, and the\r\nsheet was trimmed down, and the preventer and the weather brace hauled\r\ntaut to take off the strain. Every rope-yarn seemed stretched to the\r\nutmost, and every thread of canvas; and with this sail added to her, the\r\nship sprang through the water like a thing possessed. The sail being\r\nnearly all forward, it lifted her out of the water, and she seemed\r\nactually to jump from sea to sea. From the time her keel was laid, she had\r\nnever been so driven; and had it been life or death with everyone of us,\r\nshe could not have borne another stitch of canvas.\r\n\r\nFinding that she would bear the sail, the hands we\'re sent below, and our\r\nwatch remained on deck. Two men at the wheel had as much as they could do\r\nto keep her within three points of her course, for she steered as wild as\r\na young colt. The mate walked the deck, looking at the sails, and then\r\nover the side to see the foam fly by her,--slapping his hands upon his\r\nthighs and talking to the ship--"Hurrah, you jade, you\'ve got the scent!\r\nyou know where you\'re going!" And when she leaped over the seas, and\r\nalmost out of the water, and trembled to her very keel, the spars and\r\nmasts snapping and creaking, "There she goes!--There she\r\ngoes--handsomely!--As long as she cracks, she holds!"--while we stood\r\nwith the rigging laid down fair for letting go, and ready to take in sail\r\nand clear away if anything went.\r\n\r\nAt four bells we have the log, and she was going eleven knots fairly; and\r\nhad it not been for the sea from aft which sent the chip home, and threw\r\nher continually off her course, the log would have shown her to have been\r\ngoing somewhat faster. I went to the wheel with a young fellow from the\r\nKennebec, who was a good helmsman; and for two hours we had our hands\r\nfull. A few minutes showed us that our monkey jackets must come off; and,\r\ncold as it was, we stood in our shirt sleeves in a perspiration, and were\r\nglad enough to have it eight bells and the wheels relieved. We turned in\r\nand slept as well as we could, though the sea made a constant roar under\r\nher bows, and washed over the forecastle like a small cataract.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--The Falkland Islands are a group in the Atlantic just east of Cape\r\nHorn.\r\n\r\nBells. On shipboard time is counted in bells, the bell being struck every\r\nhalf hour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCVII. IMPEACHMENT OF WARREN HASTINGS. (375)\r\n\r\nThomas Babington Macaulay, 1800-1859, was born in the village of Rothley,\r\nLeicestershire. On his father\'s side, he descended from Scotch Highlanders\r\nand ministers of the kirk. His education began at home, and was completed\r\nat Trinity College, Cambridge. While a student, he gained much reputation\r\nas a writer and a debater. In 1826 he was admitted to the bar. In 1825\r\nbegan his connection with the "Edinburgh Review," which continued twenty\r\nyears. Some of his most brilliant essays appeared first in its pages. He\r\nwas first chosen to Parliament in 1830, and was reelected several times.\r\nIn 1840 his essays and some other writings were collected and published\r\nwith the title of "Miscellanies." His  "Lays of Ancient Rome" was\r\npublished in 1842. His "History of England" was published near the close\r\nof his life. In 1857 he was given the title of Baron Macaulay. "His style\r\nis vigorous, rapid in its movement, and brilliant; and yet, with all its\r\nsplendor, has a crystalline clearness. Indeed, the fault generally found\r\nwith his style is, that it is so constantly brilliant that the vision is\r\ndazzled and wearied with its excessive brightness." He has sometimes been\r\ncharged with sacrificing facts to fine sentences.\r\n\r\nIn his statesmanship, Macaulay was always an earnest defender of liberty.\r\nHis first speech in Parliament was in support of a bill to remove the\r\ncivil disabilities of the Jews, and his whole parliamentary career was\r\nconsistent with this wise and liberal beginning.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nThe place in which the impeachment of Warren Hastings was conducted, was\r\nworthy of such a trial. It was the great hall of William Rufus; the hall\r\nwhich had resounded with acclamations at the inauguration of thirty kings;\r\nthe hall which had witnessed the just sentence of Bacon, and the just\r\nabsolution of Somers; the hall where the eloquence of Strafford had for a\r\nmoment awed and melted a victorious party inflamed with just resentment;\r\nthe hall where Charles had confronted the High Court of Justice with the\r\nplacid courage which half redeemed his fame.\r\n\r\nNeither military nor civil pomp was wanting. The avenues were lined with\r\ngrenadiers. The streets were kept clear by cavalry. The peers, robed in\r\ngold and ermine, were marshaled by heralds. The judges, in their vestments\r\nof state, attended to give advice on points of law. The long galleries\r\nwere crowded by such an audience as has rarely excited the fears or the\r\nemulation of an orator. There were gathered together, from all parts of a\r\ngreat, free, enlightened, and prosperous realm, grace and female\r\nloveliness, wit and learning, the representatives of every science and of\r\nevery art.\r\n\r\nThere were seated around the queen, the fair-haired, young daughters of\r\nthe house of Brunswick. There the embassadors of great kings and\r\ncommonwealths gazed with admiration on a spectacle which no other country\r\nin the world could present. There Siddons, in the prime of her majestic\r\nbeauty, looked with emotion on a scene surpassing all the imitations of\r\nthe stage. There Gibbon, the historian of the Roman Empire, thought of the\r\ndays when Cicero pleaded the cause of Sicily against Verres; and when,\r\nbefore a senate which had still some show of freedom, Tacitus thundered\r\nagainst the oppressor of Africa. There, too, were seen, side by side, the\r\ngreatest painter and the greatest scholar of the age; for the spectacle\r\nhad allured Reynolds from his easel and Parr from his study.\r\n\r\nThe sergeants made proclamation. Hastings advanced to the bar, and bent\r\nhis knee. The culprit was indeed not unworthy of that great presence. He\r\nhad ruled an extensive and populous country; had made laws and treaties;\r\nhad sent forth armies; had set up and pulled down princes; and in his high\r\nplace he had so borne himself, that all had feared him, that most had\r\nloved him, and that hatred itself could deny him no title to glory, except\r\nvirtue. A person, small and emaciated, yet deriving dignity from a\r\ncarriage which, while it indicated deference to the court, indicated,\r\nalso, habitual self-possession and self-respect; a high and intellectual\r\nforehead; a brow, pensive, but not gloomy; a mouth of inflexible decision;\r\na face, pale and worn, but serene, on which a great and well-balanced mind\r\nwas legibly written: such was the aspect with which the great proconsul\r\npresented himself to his judges.\r\n\r\nThe charges, and the answers of Hastings, were first read. This ceremony\r\noccupied two whole days. On the third, Burke rose. Four sittings of the\r\ncourt were occupied by his opening speech, which was intended to be a\r\ngeneral introduction to all the charges. With an exuberance of thought and\r\na splendor of diction, which more than satisfied the highly raised\r\nexpectations of the audience, he described the character and institutions\r\nof the natives of India; recounted the circumstances in which the Asiatic\r\nEmpire of Britain had originated; and set forth the constitution of the\r\nCompany and of the English Presidencies.\r\n\r\nHaving thus attempted to communicate to his hearers an idea of eastern\r\nsociety, as vivid as that which existed in his own mind, he proceeded to\r\narraign the administration of Hastings, as systematically conducted in\r\ndefiance of morality and public law. The energy and pathos of the great\r\norator extorted expressions of unwonted admiration from all; and, for a\r\nmoment, seemed to pierce even the resolute heart of the defendant. The\r\nladies in the galleries, unaccustomed to such displays of eloquence,\r\nexcited by the solemnity of the occasion, and perhaps not unwilling to\r\ndisplay their taste and sensibility, were in a state of uncontrollable\r\nemotion. Handkerchiefs were pulled out; smelling bottles were handed\r\nround; hysterical sobs and screams were heard, and some were even carried\r\nout in fits.\r\n\r\nAt length the orator concluded. Raising his voice, till the old arches of\r\nIrish oak resounded--"Therefore," said he, "hath it with all confidence\r\nbeen ordered by the Commons of Great Britain, that I impeach Warren\r\nHastings of high crimes and misdemeanors. I impeach him in the name of the\r\nCommons House of Parliament, whose trust he has betrayed. I impeach him in\r\nthe name of the English nation, whose ancient honor he has sullied. I\r\nimpeach him in the name of the people of India, whose rights he has\r\ntrodden under foot, and whose country he has turned into a desert. Lastly,\r\nin the name of human nature itself, in the name of both sexes, in the name\r\nof every age, in the name of every rank, I impeach the common enemy and\r\noppressor of all."\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--Warren Hastings (b. 1732, d. 1818) was Governor-general of British\r\nIndia. He was impeached for maladministration, but, after a trial which\r\nextended from Feb. 13th, 1788, to April 23d, 1795, and occupied one\r\nhundred and forty-eight days, he was acquitted by a large majority on each\r\nseparate count of the impeachment.\r\n\r\nWilliam Rufus, or William II. (b. 1056, d. 1100), built Westminster Hall\r\nin which the trial was held. Bacon; see biographical notice, pages 332 and\r\n333. Somers, John (b. 1651. d. 1716) was impeached for maladministration\r\nwhile holding the office of lord chamberlain. Strafford, Thomas Wentworth,\r\nearl of, (b. 1593, d. 1641,) was impeached for his mismanagement while\r\ngovernor of Ireland. He conducted his own defense with such eloquence that\r\nthe original impeachment was abandoned, although he was immediately\r\ncondemned for high treason and executed. Charles I. (b. 1600, d. 1649),\r\nafter a war with Parliament, in which the rights of the people were at\r\nissue, was captured, tried, and condemned to death.\r\n\r\nThe House of Brunswick is one of the oldest families of Germany. A branch\r\nof this family occupies the British throne. Siddons, Sarah (b. 1755, d.\r\n1831), was a famous English actress. Gibbon, Edward (b. 1737, d. 1794),\r\nwas a celebrated English historian. Cicero; see note on page 156. Tacitus\r\n(b. about 55, d. after 117 A. D.) was a Roman orator and historian, who\r\nconducted the prosecution of Marius, proconsul of Africa. Reynolds, Sir\r\nJoshua (b. 1723, d. 1792), an English portrait painter of note. Parr,\r\nSamuel (b. 1747, d. 1825), was an English author. Burke, Edmund; see\r\nbiographical sketch accompanying the following lesson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCVIII. DESTRUCTION OF THE CARNATIC.\r\n\r\nEdmund Burke, 1730-1797, one of the most able and brilliant of England\'s\r\nessayists, orators, and statesmen, was born in Dublin, and was the son of\r\nan able lawyer. He graduated at Trinity College, Dublin, in 1748. As a\r\nstudent, he was distinguished for ability and industry. From 1750 to 1766\r\nhe was in London writing for periodicals, publishing books, or serving as\r\nprivate secretary. His work on "The Sublime and Beautiful" appeared in\r\n1756. From 1766 to 1794 he was a member of Parliament, representing at\r\ndifferent times different constituencies. On the first day of his\r\nappearance in the House of Commons he made a successful speech. "In the\r\nthree principal questions which excited his interest, and called forth the\r\nmost splendid displays of his eloquence--the contest with the American\r\nColonies, the impeachment of Warren Hastings, and the French\r\nRevolution--we see displayed a philanthropy the most pure, illustrated by\r\na genius the most resplendent." Mr. Burke\'s foresight, uprightness,\r\nintegrity, learning, magnanimity, and eloquence made him one of the most\r\nconspicuous men of his time; and his writings stand among the noblest\r\ncontributions to English literature.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen at length Hyder Ali found that he had to do with men who either would\r\nsign no convention, or whom no treaty and no signature could bind, and who\r\nwere the determined enemies of human intercourse itself, he decreed to\r\nmake the country possessed by these incorrigible and predestinated\r\ncriminals a memorable example to mankind. He resolved, in the gloomy\r\nrecesses of a mind capacious of such things, to leave the whole Carnatic\r\nan everlasting monument of vengeance, and to put perpetual desolation as a\r\nbarrier between him and those against whom the faith which holds the moral\r\nelements of the world together was no protection.\r\n\r\nHe became at length so confident of his force, so collected in his might,\r\nthat he made no secret whatsoever of his dreadful resolution. Having\r\nterminated his disputes with every enemy and every rival, who buried their\r\nmutual animosities in their common detestation against the creditors of\r\nthe Nabob of Arcot, he drew from every quarter whatever a savage ferocity\r\ncould add to his new rudiments in the arts of destruction; and compounding\r\nall the materials of fury, havoc, and desolation into one black cloud, he\r\nhung for a while on the declivities of the mountains.\r\n\r\nWhilst the authors of all these evils were idly and stupidly gazing on\r\nthis menacing meteor which blackened all their horizon, it suddenly burst,\r\nand poured down the whole of its contents upon the plains of the Carnatic.\r\n\r\nThen ensued a scene of woe, the like of which no eye had seen, no heart\r\nconceived, and which no tongue can adequately tell. All the horrors of war\r\nbefore known or heard of, were mercy to that new havoc. A storm of\r\nuniversal fire blasted every field, consumed every house, destroyed every\r\ntemple. The miserable inhabitants, flying from their flaming villages, in\r\npart were slaughtered; others, without regard to sex, to age, to the\r\nrespect of rank, or sacredness of function,--fathers torn from children,\r\nhusbands from wives, enveloped in a whirlwind of cavalry, and, amidst the\r\ngoading spears of drivers, and the trampling of pursuing horses,--were\r\nswept into captivity, in an unknown and hostile land.\r\n\r\nThose who were able to evade this tempest, fled to the walled cities; but\r\nescaping from fire, sword, and exile, they fell into the jaws of famine.\r\nThe alms of the settlement of Madras, in this dreadful exigency, were\r\ncertainly liberal, and all was done by charity that private charity could\r\ndo; but it was a people in beggary; it was a nation which stretched out\r\nits hands for food.\r\n\r\nFor months together these creatures of sufferance, whose very excess and\r\nluxury in their most plenteous days had fallen short of the allowance of\r\nour austerest fasts, silent, patient, resigned, without sedition or\r\ndisturbance, almost without complaint, perished by a hundred a day in the\r\nstreets of Madras; every day seventy at least laid their bodies in the\r\nstreets, or on the glacis of Tanjore, and expired of famine in the granary\r\nof India.\r\n\r\nI was going to wake your justice toward this unhappy part of our\r\nfellow-citizens, by bringing before you some of the circumstances of this\r\nplague of hunger. Of all the calamities which beset and waylay the life of\r\nman, this comes the nearest to our heart, and is that wherein the proudest\r\nof us all feels himself to be nothing more than he is.\r\n\r\nBut I find myself unable to manage it with decorum. These details are of a\r\nspecies of horror so nauseous and disgusting; they are so degrading to the\r\nsufferers and to the hearers; they are so humiliating to human nature\r\nitself, that, on better thoughts, I find it more advisable to throw a pall\r\nover this hideous object, and to leave it to your general conceptions.\r\n\r\nFor eighteen months, without intermission, this destruction raged from the\r\ngates of Madras to the gates of Tanjore; and so completely did these\r\nmasters in their art, Hyder Ali, and his more ferocious son, absolve\r\nthemselves of their impious vow, that when the British armies traversed,\r\nas they did, the Carnatic, for hundreds of miles in all directions,\r\nthrough the whole line of their march they did not see one man--not one\r\nwoman--not one child--not one four-footed beast of any description\r\nwhatever! One dead, uniform silence reigned over the whole region.\r\n\r\nWith the inconsiderable exceptions of the narrow vicinage of some few\r\nforts, I wish to be understood as speaking literally;--I mean to produce\r\nto you more than three witnesses, who will support this assertion in its\r\nfull extent. That hurricane of war passed through every part of the\r\ncentral provinces of the Carnatic. Six or seven districts to the north and\r\nto the south (and these not wholly untouched) escaped the general ravage.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--This selection is an extract from Burke\'s celebrated speech in\r\nParliament, in 1785, on the Nabob of Arcot\'s debts; it bore upon the\r\nmaladministration of Hastings.\r\n\r\nArcot, a district in India, had been ceded to the British on condition\r\nthat they should pay the former ruler\'s debts. These were found to be\r\nenormous, and the creditors proved to be individuals in the East India\r\nCompany\'s employ. The creditors, for their private gain, induced the Nabob\r\nto attempt the subjugation of other native princes, among whom was Hyder\r\nAli. The latter at first made successful resistance, and compelled the\r\nNabob and his allies to sign a treaty. The treaty was not kept, and the\r\ndestruction above recounted took place.\r\n\r\nThe Carnatic is a province in British India, on the eastern side of the\r\npeninsula; it contains about 50,000 square miles. Madras is a city, and\r\nTanjore a town, in this province.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCIX. THE RAVEN.\r\n\r\nEdgar Allan Poe, 1809-1849, was born in Boston, and died in Baltimore. He\r\nwas left a destitute orphan at an early age, and was adopted by Mr. John\r\nAllan, a wealthy citizen of Richmond. He entered the University of\r\nVirginia, at Charlottesville, where he excelled in his studies, and was\r\nalways at the head of his class; but he was compelled to leave on account\r\nof irregularities. He was afterwards appointed a cadet at West Point, but\r\nfailed to graduate there for the same reason. Poe now quarreled with his\r\nbenefactor and left his house never to return. During the rest of his\r\nmelancholy career, he obtained a precarious livelihood by different\r\nliterary enterprises. His ability as a writer gained him positions with\r\nvarious periodicals in Richmond, New York, and Philadelphia, and during\r\nthis time he wrote some of his finest prose. The appearance of "The Raven"\r\nin 1845, however, at once made Poe a literary lion. He was quite\r\nsuccessful for a time, but then fell back into his dissipated habits which\r\nfinally caused his death. In his personal appearance, Poe was neat and\r\ngentlemanly; his face was expressive of intellect and sensibility; and his\r\nmental powers in some directions were of a high order. His writings show\r\ncare, and a great degree of skill in their construction; but their effect\r\nis generally morbid.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\n  Once upon a midnight dreary,\r\n  While I pondered, weak and weary,\r\nOver many a quaint and curious\r\n    Volume of forgotten lore--\r\n  While I nodded, nearly napping,\r\n  Suddenly there came a tapping,\r\n  As of some one gently rapping,\r\n    Rapping at my chamber door.\r\n  "\'Tis some visitor," I muttered,\r\n    "Tapping at my chamber door\r\n      Only this, and nothing more."\r\n\r\n  Ah, distinctly I remember,\r\n  It was in the bleak December,\r\nAnd each separate dying ember\r\n    Wrought its ghost upon the floor.\r\n  Eagerly I wished the morrow;\r\n  Vainly I had sought to borrow\r\n  From my books surcease of sorrow\r\n    Sorrow for the lost Lenore--\r\nFor the rare and radiant maiden\r\n    Whom the angels name Lenore--\r\n      Nameless here for evermore.\r\n\r\n  And the silken, sad, uncertain\r\n  Rustling of each purple curtain\r\nThrilled me,--filled me with fantastic\r\n    Terrors, never felt before;\r\n  So that now, to still the beating\r\n  Of my heart, I stood repeating,\r\n    " \'Tis some visitor entreating\r\n    Entrance at my chamber door\r\n  Some late visitor entreating\r\n    Entrance at my chamber door;\r\n      This it is, and nothing more."\r\n\r\n  Presently my soul grew stronger;\r\n  Hesitating then no longer,\r\n"Sir," said I, "or Madam, truly\r\n    Your forgiveness I implore;\r\n  But the fact is I was napping,\r\n  And so gently you came rapping,\r\n  And so faintly you came tapping,\r\n    Tapping at my chamber door,\r\nThat I scarce was sure I heard you."--\r\n    Here I opened wide the door;\r\n      Darkness there, and nothing more.\r\n\r\n  Deep into that darkness peering,\r\n  Long I stood there, wondering, fearing,\r\nDoubting, dreaming dreams no mortals\r\n    Ever dared to dream before;\r\n  But the silence was unbroken,\r\n  And the stillness gave no token,\r\n  And the only word there spoken\r\n    Was the whispered word, "Lenore!"\r\nThis I whispered, and an echo\r\n    Murmured back the word, "Lenore!"\r\n      Merely this, and nothing more.\r\n\r\n  Back into the chamber turning,\r\n  All my soul within me burning,\r\nSoon again I heard a tapping,\r\n    Something louder than before.\r\n  "Surely," said I, "surely, that is\r\n  Something at my window lattice;\r\n  Let me see then, what thereat is,\r\n    And this mystery explore--\r\nLet my heart be still a moment,\r\n    And this mystery explore;--\r\n      \'Tis the wind, and nothing more."\r\n\r\n  Open here I flung the shutter.\r\n  When, with many a flirt and flutter,\r\nIn there stepped a stately Raven\r\n    Of the saintly days of yore;\r\n  Not the least obeisance made he;\r\n  Not a minute stopped or stayed he,\r\n  But, with mien of lord or lady,\r\n    Perched above my chamber door--\r\nPerched upon a bust of Pallas\r\n    Just above my chamber door--\r\n      Perched, and sat, and nothing more.\r\n\r\n  Then this ebony bird beguiling\r\n  My sad fancy into smiling,\r\nBy the grave and stern decorum\r\n    Of the countenance it wore,\r\n  "Though thy crest be shorn and shaven,\r\n  Thou," I said, "art sure no craven,\r\n  Ghastly, grim, and ancient Raven,\r\n    Wandering from the nightly shore,\r\nTell me what thy lordly name is\r\n    On the night\'s Plutonian shore!"\r\n      Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."\r\n\r\n  Much I marveled this ungainly\r\n  Fowl to hear discourse so plainly,\r\nThough its answer little meaning--\r\n    Little relevancy bore;\r\n  For we can not help agreeing\r\n  That no living human being\r\n  Ever yet was blest with seeing\r\n    Bird above his chamber door--\r\nBird or beast upon the sculptured\r\n    Bust above his chamber door,\r\n      With such name as "Nevermore."\r\n\r\n  But the Raven, sitting lonely\r\n  On that placid bust, spoke only\r\nThat one word, as if his soul in\r\n    That one word he did outpour.\r\n  Nothing farther then he uttered,\r\n  Not a feather then he fluttered,\r\n  Till I scarcely more than muttered,\r\n    "Other friends have flown before--\r\nOn the morrow he will leave me,\r\n    As my Hopes have flown before."\r\n      Then the bird said, "Nevermore."\r\n\r\n  Startled at the stillness broken\r\n  By reply so aptly spoken,\r\n"Doubtless," said I, "what it utters\r\n    Is its only stock and store,\r\n  Caught from some unhappy master\r\n  Whom unmerciful Disaster\r\n  Followed fast and followed faster\r\n    Till his songs one burden bore--\r\nTill the dirges of his Hope that\r\n    Melancholy burden bore\r\n      Of \'Never--nevermore.\' "\r\n\r\n  But the Raven still beguiling\r\n  All my sad soul into smiling,\r\nStraight I wheeled a cushioned seat in\r\n    Front of bird, and bust, and door;\r\n  Then, upon the velvet sinking,\r\n  I betook myself to linking\r\n  Fancy unto fancy, thinking\r\n    What this ominous bird of yore--\r\nWhat this grim, ungainly, ghastly,\r\n    Gaunt, and ominous bird of yore\r\n      Meant in croaking "Nevermore."\r\n\r\n  This I sat engaged in guessing,\r\n  But no syllable expressing\r\nTo the fowl whose fiery eyes now\r\n    Burned into my bosom\'s core;\r\n  This and more I sat divining,\r\n  With my head at ease reclining\r\n  On the cushion\'s velvet lining\r\n    That the lamplight gloated o\'er,\r\nBut whose velvet violet lining,\r\n    With the lamplight gloating o\'er\r\n      She shall press, ah, nevermore!\r\n\r\n  Then, methought, the air grew denser,\r\n  Perfumed from an unseen censer\r\nSwung by Seraphim, whose footfalls\r\n    Tinkled on the tufted floor.\r\n  "Wretch," I cried, "thy God hath lent thee--\r\n  By these angels he hath sent thee\r\n  Respite--respite and nepenthe [1]\r\n    From thy memories of Lenore!\r\nQuaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe,\r\n    And forget this lost Lenore!"\r\n      Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."\r\n\r\n[Transcriber\'s Note 1: nepenthe--A drug to relieve grief, by blocking\r\nmemory of sorrow or pain.]\r\n\r\n  "Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil!--\r\n  Prophet still, if bird or devil!--\r\nWhether Tempter sent, or whether\r\n    Tempest tossed thee here ashore,\r\n  Desolate, yet all undaunted,\r\n  On this desert land enchanted--\r\n  On this home by Horror haunted--\r\n    Tell me truly, I implore--\r\nIs there--is there balm in Gilead?\r\n    Tell me--tell me, I implore!"\r\n      Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."\r\n\r\n  "Prophet!" said I, "thing of evil,--\r\n  Prophet still, if bird or devil!--\r\nBy that heaven that bends above us,\r\n    By that God we both adore,\r\n  Tell this soul with sorrow laden,\r\n  If, within the distant Aidenn,\r\n  It shall clasp a sainted maiden\r\n    Whom the angels name Lenore--\r\nClasp a rare and radiant maiden,\r\n    Whom the angels name Lenore."\r\n      Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."\r\n\r\n  "Be that word our sign of parting,\r\n  Bird or fiend," I shrieked, upstarting;\r\n"Get thee back into the tempest\r\n    And the night\'s Plutonian shore!\r\n  Leave no black plume as a token\r\n  Of that lie thy soul hath spoken!\r\n  Leave my loneliness unbroken!--\r\n    Quit the bust above my door!\r\nTake thy beak from out my heart, and\r\n    Take thy form from off my door!"\r\n      Quoth the Raven, "Nevermore."\r\n\r\n  And the Raven, never flitting,\r\n  Still is sitting, still is sitting\r\nOn the pallid bust of Pallas\r\n    Just above my chamber door;\r\n  And his eyes have all the seeming\r\n  Of a demon\'s that is dreaming,\r\n  And the lamplight o\'er him streaming\r\n    Throws his shadow on the floor;\r\nAnd my soul from out that shadow,\r\n    That lies floating on the floor,\r\n      Shall be lifted--nevermore!\r\n\r\nNOTES.--Pallas, or Minerva, in ancient mythology, was the goddess of\r\nwisdom.\r\n\r\nPlutonian, see note on Pluto, page 242.\r\n\r\nGilead is the

A VIEW OF THE COLOSSEUM. (389)\r\n\r\nOrville Dewey, 1794-1882, a well known Unitarian clergyman and author, was\r\nborn in Sheffield, Massachusetts, graduated with distinction at Williams\r\nCollege in 1814, and afterward studied theology at Andover. For a while he\r\nwas assistant to Dr. W. E. Channing in Boston, and later, was a pastor in\r\nNew Bedford, New York City, and Boston. He made two or three voyages to\r\nEurope, and published accounts of his travels.\r\n\r\n"Discourses on Human Life," "Discourses on the Nature of Religion,"\r\n"Discourses on Commerce and Business," are among his published works. His\r\nwritings are both philosophical and practical; and, as a preacher, he was\r\nesteemed original, earnest, and impressive.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the eighth of November, from the high land, about fourteen miles\r\ndistant, I first saw Rome; and although there is something very\r\nunfavorable to impression in the expectation that you are to be greatly\r\nimpressed, or that you ought to be, or that such is the fashion; yet Rome\r\nis too mighty a name to be withstood by such or any other influences. Let\r\nyou come upon that hill in what mood you may, the scene will lay hold upon\r\nyou as with the hand of a giant. I scarcely know how to describe the\r\nimpression, but it seemed to me as if something strong and stately, like\r\nthe slow and majestic march of a mighty whirlwind, swept around those\r\neternal towers; the storms of time, that had prostrated the proudest\r\nmonuments of the world, seemed to have left their vibrations in the still\r\nand solemn air; ages of history passed before me; the mighty procession of\r\nnations, kings, consuls, emperors, empires, and generations had passed\r\nover that sublime theater. The fire, the storm, the earthquake, had gone\r\nby; but there was yet left the still, small voice like that at which the\r\nprophet "wrapped his face in his mantle."\r\n\r\nI went to see the Colosseum by moonlight. It is the monarch, the majesty\r\nof all ruins; there is nothing like it. All the associations of the place,\r\ntoo, give it the most impressive character. When you enter within this\r\nstupendous circle of ruinous walls and arches, and grand terraces of\r\nmasonry, rising one above another, you stand upon the arena of the old\r\ngladiatorial combats and Christian martyrdom; and as you lift your eyes to\r\nthe vast amphitheater, you meet, in imagination, the eyes of a hundred\r\nthousand Romans, assembled to witness these bloody spectacles. What a\r\nmultitude and mighty array of human beings; and how little do we know in\r\nmodern times of great assemblies! One, two, and three, and, at its last\r\nenlargement by Constantine, more than three hundred thousand persons could\r\nbe seated in the Circus Maximus!\r\n\r\nBut to return to the Colosseum; we went up under the conduct of a guide\r\nupon the walls and terraces, or embankments, which supported the ranges of\r\nseats. The seats have long since disappeared; and grass overgrows the\r\nspots where the pride, and power, and wealth, and beauty of Rome sat down\r\nto its barbarous entertainments. What thronging life was here then! What\r\nvoices, what greetings, what hurrying footsteps upon the staircases of the\r\neighty arches of entrance! And now, as we picked our way carefully through\r\nthe decayed passages, or cautiously ascended some moldering flight of\r\nsteps, or stood by the lonely walls--ourselves silent, and, for a wonder,\r\nthe guide silent, too--there was no sound here but of the bat, and none\r\ncame from without but the roll of a distant carriage, or the convent bell\r\nfrom the summit of the neighboring Esquiline.\r\n\r\nIt is scarcely possible to describe the effect of moonlight upon this\r\nruin. Through a hundred lonely arches and blackened passageways it\r\nstreamed in, pure, bright, soft, lambent, and yet distinct and clear, as\r\nif it came there at once to reveal, and cheer, and pity the mighty\r\ndesolation. But if the Colosseum is a mournful and desolate spectacle as\r\nseen from within--without, and especially on the side which is in best\r\npreservation, it is glorious. We passed around it; and, as we looked\r\nupward, the moon shining through its arches, from the opposite side, it\r\nappeared as if it were the coronet of the heavens, so vast was it--or like\r\na glorious crown upon the brow of night.\r\n\r\nI feel that I do not and can not describe this mighty ruin. I can only say\r\nthat I came away paralyzed, and as passive as a child. A soldier stretched\r\nout his hand for "un dona," as we passed the guard; and when my companion\r\nsaid I did wrong to give, I told him that I should have given my cloak, if\r\nthe man had asked it. Would you break any spell that worldly feeling or\r\nselfish sorrow may have spread over your mind, go and see the Colosseum by\r\nmoonlight.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--The Colosseum (pro. Col-os-se\'um) was commenced by the Roman\r\nemperor Vespasian, and was completed by Titus, his son, 79 A.D. Its\r\nconstruction occupied but three years, notwithstanding its size; a great\r\npart of its walls are standing today.\r\n\r\nThe Circus Maximus was an amphitheater built by Tarquin the Elder about\r\n600 B. C.\r\n\r\nConstantine. See note on page 175.\r\n\r\nThe Esquiline is one of the seven hills upon which Rome is built.  Un\r\ndona, an Italian phrase meaning a gift or alms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXI. THE BRIDGE. (392)\r\n\r\nI stood on the bridge at midnight,\r\n  As the clocks were striking the hour,\r\nAnd the moon rose o\'er the city,\r\n  Behind the dark church tower.\r\n\r\nI saw her bright reflection\r\n  In the waters under me,\r\nLike a golden goblet falling\r\n  And sinking into the sea.\r\n\r\nAnd far in the hazy distance\r\n  Of that lovely night in June,\r\nThe blaze of the flaming furnace\r\n  Gleamed redder than the moon.\r\n\r\nAmong the long, black rafters\r\n  The wavering shadows lay,\r\nAnd the current that came from the ocean\r\n  Seemed to lift and bear them away;\r\n\r\nAs, sweeping and eddying through them,\r\n  Rose the belated tide,\r\nAnd, streaming into the moonlight,\r\n  The seaweed floated wide.\r\n\r\nAnd like those waters rushing\r\n  Among the wooden piers,\r\nA flood of thoughts came o\'er me\r\n  That filled my eyes with tears\r\n\r\nHow often, oh, how often,\r\n  In the days that had gone by,\r\nI had stood on that bridge at midnight\r\n  And gazed on that wave and sky!\r\n\r\nHow often, oh, how often,\r\n  I had wished that the ebbing tide\r\nWould bear me away on its bosom\r\n  O\'er the ocean wild and wide.\r\n\r\nFor my heart was hot and restless,\r\n  And my life was full of care,\r\nAnd the burden laid upon me\r\n  Seemed greater than I could bear.\r\n\r\nBut now it has fallen from me,\r\n  It is buried in the sea;\r\nAnd only the sorrow of others\r\n  Throws its shadow over me.\r\n\r\nYet, whenever I cross the river\r\n  On its bridge with wooden piers,\r\nLike the odor of brine from the ocean\r\n  Comes the thought of other years.\r\n\r\nAnd I think how many thousands\r\n  Of care-encumbered men,\r\nEach bearing his burden of sorrow,\r\n  Have crossed the bridge since then.\r\n\r\nI see the long procession\r\n  Still passing to and fro,\r\nThe young heart hot and restless,\r\n  And the old, subdued and slow!\r\n\r\nAnd forever and forever,\r\n  As long as the river flows,\r\nAs long as the heart has passions,\r\n  As long as life has woes;\r\n\r\nThe moon and its broken reflection\r\n  And its shadows shall appear\r\nAs the symbol of love in heaven,\r\n  And its wavering image here.\r\n                             --Longfellow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXII. OBJECTS AND LIMITS OF SCIENCE. (394)\r\n\r\nRobert Charles Winthrop, 1809-1894, was a descendant of John Winthrop, the\r\nfirst Governor of the Colony of Massachusetts Bay. He was born in Boston,\r\nstudied at the public Latin School, graduated at Harvard in 1828, and\r\nstudied law with Daniel Webster. Possessing an ample fortune, he made\r\nlittle effort to practice his profession. In 1834 he was elected to the\r\nLegislature of his native state, and was reelected five times; three years\r\nhe was Speaker of the House of Representatives. In 1840 he was chosen to\r\nCongress, and sat as Representative for ten years. In 1847 he was chosen\r\nSpeaker of the House. He also served a short time in the Senate. His\r\npublished writings are chiefly in the form of addresses and speeches; they\r\nare easy, finished, and scholarly. As a speaker, Mr. Winthrop was ready,\r\nfull-voiced, and self-possessed.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are fields enough for the wildest and most extravagant theorizings,\r\nwithin man\'s own appropriate domain, without overleaping the barriers\r\nwhich separate things human and divine. Indeed, I have often thought that\r\nmodern science had afforded a most opportune and providential safety valve\r\nfor the intellectual curiosity and ambition of man, at a moment when the\r\nprogress of education, invention, and liberty had roused and stimulated\r\nhim to a pitch of such unprecedented eagerness and ardor. Astronomy,\r\nChemistry, and, more than all, Geology, with their incidental branches of\r\nstudy, have opened an inexhaustible field for investigation and\r\nspeculation. Here, by the aid of modern instruments and modern modes of\r\nanalysis, the most ardent and earnest spirits may find ample room and\r\nverge enough for their insatiate activity and audacious enterprise, and\r\nmay pursue their course not only without the slightest danger of doing\r\nmischief to others, but with the certainty of promoting the great end of\r\nscientific truth.\r\n\r\nLet them lift their vast reflectors or refractors to the skies, and detect\r\nnew planets in their hiding places. Let them waylay the fugitive comets in\r\ntheir flight, and compel them to disclose the precise period of their\r\norbits, and to give bonds for their punctual return. Let them drag out\r\nreluctant satellites from "their habitual concealments." Let them resolve\r\nthe unresolvable nebulae of Orion or Andromeda. They need not fear. The\r\nsky will not fall, nor a single star be shaken from its sphere.\r\n\r\nLet them perfect and elaborate their marvelous processes of making the\r\nlight and the lightning their ministers, for putting "a pencil of rays"\r\ninto the hand of art, and providing tongues of fire for the communication\r\nof intelligence. Let them foretell the path of the whirlwind, and\r\ncalculate the orbit of the storm. Let them hang out their gigantic\r\npendulums, and make the earth do the work of describing and measuring her\r\nown motions.\r\n\r\nLet them annihilate human pain, and literally "charm ache with air, and\r\nagony with ether." The blessing of God will attend all their toils, and\r\nthe gratitude of man will await all their triumphs. Let them dig down into\r\nthe bowels of the earth. Let them rive asunder the massive rocks, and\r\nunfold the history of creation as it lies written on the pages of their\r\npiled up strata. Let them gather up the fossil fragments of a lost Fauna,\r\nreproducing the ancient forms which inhabited the land or the seas,\r\nbringing them together, bone to his bone, till Leviathan and Behemoth\r\nstand before us in bodily presence and in their full proportions, and we\r\nalmost tremble lest these dry bones should live again! Let them put nature\r\nto the rack, and torture her, in all her forms, to the betrayal of her\r\ninmost secrets and confidences. They need not forbear. The foundations of\r\nthe round world have been laid so strong that they can not be moved.\r\n\r\nBut let them not think by searching to find out God. Let them not dream of\r\nunderstanding the Almighty to perfection. Let them not dare to apply their\r\ntests and solvents, their modes of analysis or their terms of definition,\r\nto the secrets of the spiritual kingdom. Let them spare the foundations of\r\nfaith. Let them be satisfied with what is revealed of the mysteries of the\r\nDivine Nature. Let them not break through the bounds to gaze after the\r\nInvisible.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--Orion and Andromeda are the names of two constellations.\r\n\r\nThe Leviathan is described in Job, chap. xli, and the Behemoth in Job,\r\nchap. xl. It is not known exactly what beasts are meant by these\r\ndescriptions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXIII. THE DOWNFALL OF POLAND. (396)\r\n\r\nO Sacred Truth! thy triumph ceased a while,\r\nAnd Hope, thy sister, ceased with thee to smile,\r\nWhen leagued Oppression poured to northern wars\r\nHer whiskered pandours and her fierce hussars,\r\nWaved her dread standard to the breeze of morn,\r\nPealed her loud drum, and twanged her trumpet horn;\r\nTumultuous horror brooded o\'er her van,\r\nPresaging wrath to Poland--and to man!\r\n\r\nWarsaw\'s last champion, from her height surveyed,\r\nWide o\'er the fields a waste of ruin laid;\r\n"O Heaven!" he cried, "my bleeding country save!\r\nIs there no hand on high to shield the brave?\r\nYet, though destruction sweep those lovely plains,\r\nRise, fellow-men! our country yet remains!\r\nBy that dread name, we wave the sword on high,\r\nAnd swear for her to live--with her to die!"\r\n\r\nHe said, and on the rampart heights arrayed\r\nHis trusty warriors, few, but undismayed;\r\nFirm-paced and slow, a horrid front they form,\r\nStill as the breeze, but dreadful as the storm;\r\nLow murmuring sounds along their banners fly,\r\nRevenge or death--the watchword and reply;\r\nThen pealed the notes, omnipotent to charm,\r\nAnd the loud tocsin tolled their last alarm.\r\n\r\nIn vain, alas! in vain, ye gallant few!\r\nFrom rank to rank, your volleyed thunder flew!\r\nOh, bloodiest picture in the book of time,\r\nSarmatia fell, unwept, without a crime;\r\nFound not a generous friend, a pitying foe,\r\nStrength in her arms, nor mercy in her woe!\r\nDropped from her nerveless grasp the shattered spear,\r\nClosed her bright eye, and curbed her high career;\r\nHope, for a season, bade the world farewell,\r\nAnd Freedom shrieked as Kosciusko fell!\r\n                                         --Thomas Campbell.\r\n\r\nNOTES.--Kosciusko (b. 1746, d. 1817), a celebrated Polish patriot, who had\r\nserved in the American Revolution, was besieged at Warsaw, in 1794, by a\r\nlarge force of Russians, Prussians, and Austrians. After the siege was\r\nraised, he marched against a force of Russians much larger than his own,\r\nand was defeated. He was himself severely wounded and captured.\r\n\r\nSarmatia is the ancient name for a region of Europe which embraced Poland,\r\nbut was of greater extent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXIV. LABOR. (398)\r\n\r\nHorace Greeley,1811-1872, perhaps the most famous editor of America, was\r\nborn in Amherst, New Hampshire, of poor parents. His boyhood was passed in\r\nfarm labor, in attending the common school, and in reading every book on\r\nwhich he could lay his hands. His reading was mostly done by the light of\r\npine knots. At fifteen he entered a printing office in Vermont, became the\r\nbest workman in the office, and continued to improve every opportunity for\r\nstudy. At the age of twenty he appeared in New York City, poorly clothed,\r\nand almost destitute of money. He worked at his trade for a year or two,\r\nand then set up printing for himself. For several years he was not\r\nsuccessful, but struggled on, performing an immense amount of work as an\r\neditor. In 1841 he established the "New York Tribune," which soon became\r\none of the most successful and influential papers in the country. In 1848\r\nhe was elected to Congress, but remained but a short time. In 1872 he was\r\na candidate for the Presidency, was defeated, and died a few days\r\nafterward. Mr. Greeley is a rare example of what may be accomplished by\r\nhonesty and unflinching industry. Besides the vast amount which he wrote\r\nfor the newspapers, he published several books; the best known of which is\r\n"The American Conflict."\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery child should be trained to dexterity in some useful branch of\r\nproductive industry, not in order that he shall certainly follow that\r\npursuit, but that he may at all events be able to do so in case he shall\r\nfail in the more intellectual or artificial calling which he may prefer to\r\nit. Let him seek to be a doctor, lawyer, preacher, poet, if he will; but\r\nlet him not stake his all on success in that pursuit, but have a second\r\nline to fall back upon if driven from his first. Let him be so reared and\r\ntrained that he may enter, if he will, upon some intellectual calling in\r\nthe sustaining consciousness that he need not debase himself, nor do\r\nviolence to his convictions, in order to achieve success therein, since he\r\ncan live and thrive in another (if you choose, humbler) vocation, if\r\ndriven from that of his choice. This buttress to integrity, this assurance\r\nof self-respect, is to be found in a universal training to efficiency in\r\nProductive Labor.\r\n\r\nThe world is full of misdirection and waste; but all the calamities and\r\nlosses endured by mankind through frost, drought, blight, hail, fires,\r\nearthquakes, inundations, are as nothing to those habitually suffered by\r\nthem through human idleness and inefficiency, mainly caused (or excused)\r\nby lack of industrial training. It is quite within the truth to estimate\r\nthat one tenth of our people, in the average, are habitually idle because\r\n(as they say) they can find no employment. They look for work where it can\r\nnot be had. They seem to be, or they are, unable to do such as abundantly\r\nconfronts and solicits them. Suppose these to average but one million\r\nable-bodied persons, and that their work is worth but one dollar each per\r\nday; our loss by involuntary idleness can not be less than $300,000,000\r\nper annum. I judge that it is actually $500,000,000. Many who stand\r\nwaiting to be hired could earn from two to five dollars per day had they\r\nbeen properly trained to work. "There is plenty of room higher up," said\r\nDaniel Webster, in response to an inquiry as to the prospects of a young\r\nman just entering upon the practice of law; and there is never a dearth of\r\nemployment for men or women of signal capacity or skill. In this city, ten\r\nthousand women are always doing needlework for less than fifty cents per\r\nday, finding themselves; yet twice their number of capable, skillful\r\nseamstresses could find steady employment and good living in wealthy\r\nfamilies at not less than one dollar per day over and above board and\r\nlodging. He who is a good blacksmith, a fair millwright, a tolerable wagon\r\nmaker, and can chop timber, make fence, and manage a small farm if\r\nrequired, is always sure of work and fair recompense; while he or she who\r\ncan keep books or teach music fairly, but knows how to do nothing else, is\r\nin constant danger of falling into involuntary idleness and consequent\r\nbeggary. It is a broad, general truth, that no boy was ever yet inured to\r\ndaily, systematic, productive labor in field or shop throughout the latter\r\nhalf of his minority, who did not prove a useful man, and was notable to\r\nfind work whenever he wished it.\r\n\r\nYet to the ample and constant employment of a whole community one\r\nprerequisite is indispensable,--that a variety of pursuits shall have been\r\ncreated or naturalized therein. A people who have but a single source of\r\nprofit are uniformly poor, not because that vocation is necessarily\r\nill-chosen, but because no single calling can employ and reward the varied\r\ncapacities of male and female, old and young, robust and feeble. Thus a\r\nlumbering or fishing region with us is apt to have a large proportion of\r\nneedy inhabitants; and the same is true of a region exclusively devoted to\r\ncotton growing or gold mining. A diversity of pursuits is indispensable to\r\ngeneral activity and enduring prosperity.\r\n\r\nSixty or seventy years ago, what was then the District, and is now the\r\nState, of Maine, was a proverb in New England for the poverty of its\r\npeople, mainly because they were so largely engaged in timber cutting. The\r\ngreat grain-growing, wheat-exporting districts of the Russian empire have\r\na poor and rude people for a like reason. Thus the industry of\r\nMassachusetts is immensely more productive per head than that of North\r\nCarolina, or even that of Indiana, as it will cease to be whenever\r\nmanufactures shall have been diffused over our whole country, as they must\r\nand will be. In Massachusetts half the women and nearly half the children\r\nadd by their daily labor to the aggregate of realized wealth; in North\r\nCarolina and in Indiana little wealth is produced save by the labor of\r\nmen, including boys of fifteen or upward. When this disparity shall have\r\nceased, its consequence will also disappear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A chained man in prison reclining against the wall. He is\r\ngazing down at a sleeping young boy.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCXV. THE LAST DAYS OF HERCULANEUM. (401)\r\n\r\nEdwin Atherstone, 1788-1872, was born at Nottingham, England, and became\r\nknown to the literary world chiefly through two poems, "The Last Days of\r\nHerculaneum" and "The Fall of Nineveh." Both poems are written in blank\r\nverse, and are remarkable for their splendor of diction and their great\r\ndescriptive power. Atherstone is compared to Thomson, whom he resembles\r\nsomewhat in style.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\n                      There was a man,\r\nA Roman soldier, for some daring deed\r\nThat trespassed on the laws, in dungeon low\r\nChained down. His was a noble spirit, rough,\r\nBut generous, and brave, and kind.\r\nHe had a son; it was a rosy boy,\r\nA little faithful copy of his sire,\r\nIn face and gesture. From infancy, the child\r\nHad been his father\'s solace and his care.\r\n\r\n                                     Every sport\r\nThe father shared and heightened. But at length,\r\nThe rigorous law had grasped him, and condemned\r\nTo fetters and to darkness.\r\n\r\n                          The captive\'s lot,\r\nHe felt in all its bitterness: the walls\r\nOf his deep dungeon answered many a sigh\r\nAnd heart-heaved groan. His tale was known, and touched\r\nHis jailer with compassion; and the boy,\r\nThenceforth a frequent visitor, beguiled\r\nHis father\'s lingering hours, and brought a balm\r\nWith his loved presence, that in every wound\r\nDropped healing. But, in this terrific hour,\r\nHe was a poisoned arrow in the breast\r\nWhere he had been a cure.\r\n\r\n                       With earliest morn\r\nOf that first day of darkness and amaze,\r\nHe came. The iron door was closed--for them\r\nNever to open more! The day, the night\r\nDragged slowly by; nor did they know the fate\r\nImpending o\'er the city. Well they heard\r\nThe pent-up thunders in the earth beneath,\r\nAnd felt its giddy rocking; and the air\r\nGrew hot at length, and thick; but in his straw\r\nThe boy was sleeping: and the father hoped\r\nThe earthquake might pass by: nor would he wake\r\nFrom his sound rest the unfearing child, nor tell\r\nThe dangers of their state.\r\n\r\n                             On his low couch\r\nThe fettered soldier sank, and, with deep awe,\r\nListened the fearful sounds: with upturned eye,\r\nTo the great gods he breathed a prayer; then, strove\r\nTo calm himself, and lose in sleep awhile\r\nHis useless terrors. But he could not sleep:\r\nHis body burned with feverish heat; his chains\r\nClanked loud, although he moved not; deep in earth\r\nGroaned unimaginable thunders; sounds,\r\nFearful and ominous, arose and died,\r\nLike the sad mornings of November\'s wind,\r\nIn the blank midnight. Deepest horror chilled\r\nHis blood that burned before; cold, clammy sweats\r\nCame o\'er him; then anon, a fiery thrill\r\nShot through his veins. Now, on his couch he shrunk\r\nAnd shivered as in fear; now, upright leaped,\r\nAs though he heard the battle trumpet sound,\r\nAnd longed to cope with death.\r\n\r\n                           He slept, at last,\r\nA troubled, dreamy sleep. Well had he slept\r\nNever to waken more! His hours are few,\r\nBut terrible his agony.\r\n\r\n                              Soon the storm\r\nBurst forth; the lightnings glanced; the air\r\nShook with the thunders. They awoke; they sprung\r\nAmazed upon their feet. The dungeon glowed\r\nA moment as in sunshine--and was dark:\r\nAgain, a flood of white flame fills the cell,\r\nDying away upon the dazzled eye\r\nIn darkening, quivering tints, as stunning sound\r\nDies throbbing, ringing in the ear.\r\n\r\n                                With intensest awe,\r\nThe soldier\'s frame was filled; and many a thought\r\nOf strange foreboding hurried through his mind,\r\nAs underneath he felt the fevered earth\r\nJarring and lifting; and the massive walls,\r\nHeard harshly grate and strain: yet knew he not,\r\nWhile evils undefined and yet to come\r\nGlanced through his thoughts, what deep and cureless wound\r\nFate had already given.--Where, man of woe!\r\nWhere, wretched father! is thy boy? Thou call\'st\r\nHis name in vain:--he can not answer thee.\r\n\r\nLoudly the father called upon his child:\r\nNo voice replied. Trembling and anxiously\r\nHe searched their couch of straw; with headlong haste\r\nTrod round his stinted limits, and, low bent,\r\nGroped darkling on the earth:--no child was there.\r\nAgain he called: again, at farthest stretch\r\nOf his accursed fetters, till the blood\r\nSeemed bursting from his ears, and from his eyes\r\nFire flashed, he strained with arm extended far,\r\nAnd fingers widely spread, greedy to touch\r\nThough but his idol\'s garment. Useless toil!\r\nYet still renewed: still round and round he goes,\r\nAnd strains, and snatches, and with dreadful cries\r\nCalls on his boy.\r\n\r\n                      Mad frenzy fires him now.\r\nHe plants against the wall his feet; his chain\r\nGrasps; tugs with giant strength to force away\r\nThe deep-driven staple; yells and shrieks with rage:\r\nAnd, like a desert lion in the snare,\r\nRaging to break his toils,--to and fro bounds.\r\nBut see! the ground is opening;--a blue light\r\nMounts, gently waving,--noiseless;--thin and cold\r\nIt seems, and like a rainbow tint, not flame;\r\nBut by its luster, on the earth outstretched,\r\nBehold the lifeless child! his dress is singed,\r\nAnd, o\'er his face serene, a darkened line\r\nPoints out the lightning\'s track.\r\n\r\n                                 The father saw,\r\nAnd all his fury fled:--a dead calm fell\r\nThat instant on him:--speechless--fixed--he stood,\r\nAnd with a look that never wandered, gazed\r\nIntensely on the corse. Those laughing eyes\r\nWere not yet closed,--and round those ruby lips\r\nThe wonted smile returned.\r\n\r\n                           Silent and pale\r\nThe father stands:--no tear is in his eye:--\r\nThe thunders bellow;--but he hears them not:--\r\nThe ground lifts like a sea;--he knows it not:--\r\nThe strong walls grind and gape:--the vaulted roof\r\nTakes shape like bubble tossing in the wind;\r\nSee! he looks up and smiles; for death to him\r\nIs happiness. Yet could one last embrace\r\nBe given, \'t were still a sweeter thing to die.\r\n\r\nIt will be given. Look! how the rolling ground,\r\nAt every swell, nearer and still more near\r\nMoves toward the father\'s outstretched arm his boy.\r\nOnce he has touched his garment:--how his eye\r\nLightens with love, and hope, and anxious fears!\r\nHa, see! he has him now!--he clasps him round;\r\nKisses his face; puts back the curling locks,\r\nThat shaded his fine brow; looks in his eyes;\r\nGrasps in his own those little dimpled hands;\r\nThen folds him to his breast, as he was wont\r\nTo lie when sleeping; and resigned, awaits\r\nUndreaded death.\r\n\r\n                 And death came soon and swift\r\nAnd pangless. The huge pile sank down at once\r\nInto the opening earth. Walls--arches--roof--\r\nAnd deep foundation stones--all--mingling--fell!\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--Herculaneum and Pompeii were cities of Italy, which were destroyed\r\nby an eruption of Vesuvius in the year 79 A. D., being entirely buried\r\nunder ashes and lava. During the last century they have been dug out to a\r\nconsiderable extent, and many of the streets, buildings, and utensils have\r\nbeen found in a state of perfect preservation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXVI. HOW MEN REASON. (405)\r\n\r\nMy friend, the Professor, whom I have mentioned to you once or twice, told\r\nme yesterday that somebody had been abusing him in some of the journals of\r\nhis calling. I told him that I did n\'t doubt he deserved it; that I hoped\r\nhe did deserve a little abuse occasionally, and would for a number of\r\nyears to come; that nobody could do anything to make his neighbors wiser\r\nor better without being liable to abuse for it; especially that people\r\nhated to have their little mistakes made fun of, and perhaps he had been\r\ndoing something of the kind. The Professor smiled.\r\n\r\nNow, said I, hear what I am going to say. It will not take many years to\r\nbring you to the period of life when men, at least the majority of writing\r\nand talking men, do nothing but praise. Men, like peaches and pears, grow\r\nsweet a little while before they begin to decay. I don\'t know what it\r\nis,--whether a spontaneous change, mental or bodily, or whether it is\r\nthrough experience of the thanklessness of critical honesty,--but it is a\r\nfact, that most writers, except sour and unsuccessful ones, get tired of\r\nfinding fault at about the time when they are beginning to grow old.\r\n\r\nAs a general thing, I would not give a great deal for the fair words of a\r\ncritic, if he is himself an author, over fifty years of age. At thirty, we\r\nare all trying to cut our names in big letters upon the walls of this\r\ntenement of life; twenty years later, we have carved it, or shut up our\r\njackknives. Then we are ready to help others, and care less to hinder any,\r\nbecause nobody\'s elbows are in our way. So I am glad you have a little\r\nlife left; you will be saccharine enough in a few years.\r\n\r\nSome of the softening effects of advancing age have struck me very much in\r\nwhat I have heard or seen here and elsewhere. I just now spoke of the\r\nsweetening process that authors undergo. Do you know that in the gradual\r\npassage from maturity to helplessness the harshest characters sometimes\r\nhave a period in which they are gentle and placid as young children? I\r\nhave heard it said, but I can not be sponsor for its truth, that the\r\nfamous chieftain, Lochiel, was rocked in a cradle like a baby, in his old\r\nage. An old man, whose studies had been of the severest scholastic kind,\r\nused to love to hear little nursery stories read over and over to him. One\r\nwho saw the Duke of Wellington in his last years describes him as very\r\ngentle in his aspect and demeanor. I remember a person of singularly\r\nstern and lofty bearing who became remarkably gracious and easy in all his\r\nways in the later period of his life.\r\n\r\nAnd that leads me to say that men often remind me of pears in their way of\r\ncoming to maturity. Some are ripe at twenty, like human Jargonelles, and\r\nmust be made the most of, for their day is soon over. Some come into their\r\nperfect condition late, like the autumn kinds, and they last better than\r\nthe summer fruit. And some, that, like the Winter Nelis, have been hard\r\nand uninviting until all the rest have had their season, get their glow\r\nand perfume long after the frost and snow have done their worst with the\r\norchards. Beware of rash criticisms; the rough and stringent fruit you\r\ncondemn may be an autumn or a winter pear, and that which you picked up\r\nbeneath the same bough in August may have been only its worm--eaten\r\nwindfalls. Milton was a Saint Germain with a graft of the roseate Early\r\nCatherine. Rich, juicy, lively, fragrant, russet-skinned old Chaucer was\r\nan Easter Beurre\'; the buds of a new summer were swelling when he ripened.\r\n\r\n                                                               --Holmes.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--The above selection is from the "Autocrat of the Breakfast Table."\r\n\r\nLochiel. See note on page 214.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Wellington (b. 1769, d. 1852) was the most celebrated of\r\nEnglish generals. He won great renown in India and in the "Peninsular\r\nWar," and commanded the allied forces when Napoleon was defeated at\r\nWaterloo.\r\n\r\nEaster Beurre\', Saint Germain, Winter Nelis, Early Catherine and\r\nJargonelles are the names of certain varieties of pears.\r\n\r\nMilton. See biographical notice on page 312.\r\n\r\nChaucer, Geoffrey (b. 1328, d. 1400). is often called "The Father of\r\nEnglish Poetry." He was the first poet buried in Westminster Abbey. He was\r\na prolific writer, but his "Canterbury Tales" is by far the best known of\r\nhis works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXVII. THUNDERSTORM ON THE ALPS. (408)\r\n\r\n  Clear, placid Leman! thy contrasted lake,\r\n  With the wild world I dwell in, is a thing\r\n  Which warns me, with its stillness, to forsake\r\n  Earth\'s troubled waters for a purer spring.\r\n  This quiet sail is as a noiseless wing\r\n  To waft me from distraction; once I loved\r\n  Torn ocean\'s roar, but thy soft murmuring\r\n  Sounds sweet, as if a sister\'s voice reproved,\r\nThat I with stern delights should e\'er have been so moved.\r\n\r\n  All heaven and earth are still--though not in sleep,\r\n  But breathless, as we grow when feeling most;\r\n  And silent, as we stand in thoughts too deep--\r\n  All heaven and earth are still: from the high host\r\n  Of stars, to the lulled lake and mountain coast,\r\n  All is concentered in a life intense,\r\n  Where not a beam, nor air, nor leaf is lost,\r\n  But hath a part of being, and a sense\r\nOf that which is of all Creator and defense.\r\n\r\n  The sky is changed! and such a change! O night,\r\n  And storm, and darkness, ye are wondrous strong,\r\n  Yet lovely in your strength, as is the light\r\n  Of a dark eye in woman! Far along,\r\n  From peak to peak, the rattling crags among,\r\n  Leaps the live thunder! Not from one lone cloud,\r\n  But every mountain now hath found a tongue,\r\n  And Jura answers, through her misty shroud,\r\n  Back to the joyous Alps, who call to her aloud!\r\n\r\n  And this is in the night.--Most glorious night!\r\n  Thou wert not sent for slumber! let me be\r\n  A sharer in thy fierce and far delight,--\r\n  A portion of the tempest and of thee!\r\n  How the lit lake shines,--a phosphoric sea!\r\n  And the big rain comes dancing to the earth!\r\n  And now again, \'tis black,--and now, the glee\r\n  Of the loud hills shakes with its mountain mirth,\r\nAs if they did rejoice o\'er a young earthquake\'s birth.\r\n\r\n  Now, where the swift Rhone cleaves his way between\r\n  Heights which appear as lovers who have parted\r\n  In hate, whose mining depths so intervene,\r\n  That they can meet no more, though broken-hearted;\r\n  Though in their souls, which thus each other thwarted,\r\n  Love was the very root of the fond rage,\r\n  Which blighted their life\'s bloom, and then--departed.\r\n  Itself expired, but leaving them an age\r\nOf years, all winters,--war within themselves to wage.\r\n\r\n  Now, where the quick Rhone thus hath cleft his way,\r\n  The mightiest of the storms hath ta\'en his stand!\r\n  For here, not one, but many make their play,\r\n  And fling their thunderbolts from hand to hand,\r\n  Flashing and cast around! Of all the band,\r\n  The brightest through these parted hills hath forked\r\n  His lightnings,--as if he did understand,\r\n  That in such gaps as desolation worked,\r\nThere, the hot shaft should blast whatever therein lurked.\r\n                                                          --Byron.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--Lake Leman (or Lake of Geneva) is in the south-western part of\r\nSwitzerland, separating it in part from Savoy. The Rhone flows through it,\r\nentering by a deep narrow gap, with mountain groups on either hand, eight\r\nor nine thousand feet above the water. The scenery about the lake is\r\nmagnificent, the Jura mountains bordering it on the northwest, and the\r\nAlps lying on the south and east.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXVIII. ORIGIN OF PROPERTY. (410)\r\n\r\nSir William Blackstone, 1723-1780, was the son of a silk merchant, and was\r\nborn in London. He studied with great success at Oxford, and was admitted\r\nto the bar in 1745. At first he could not obtain business enough in his\r\nprofession to support himself, and for a time relinquished practice, and\r\nlectured at Oxford. He afterwards returned to London, and resumed his\r\npractice with great success, still continuing to lecture at Oxford. He was\r\nelected to Parliament in 1761; and in 1770 was made a justice of the Court\r\nof Common Pleas, which office he held till his death. Blackstone\'s fame\r\nrests upon his "Commentaries on the Laws of England," published about\r\n1769. He was a man of great ability, sound learning, unflagging industry,\r\nand moral integrity. His great work is still a common text-book in the\r\nstudy of law.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of the world, we are informed by Holy Writ, the all-\r\nbountiful Creator gave to man dominion over all the earth, and "over the\r\nfish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing\r\nthat moveth upon the earth." This is the only true and solid foundation of\r\nman\'s dominion over external things, whatever airy, metaphysical notions\r\nmay have been started by fanciful writers upon this subject. The earth,\r\ntherefore, and all things therein, are the general property of all\r\nmankind, exclusive of other beings, from the immediate gift of the\r\nCreator. And while the earth continued bare of inhabitants, it is\r\nreasonable to suppose that all was in common among them, and that everyone\r\ntook from the public stock, to his own use, such things as his immediate\r\nnecessities required.\r\n\r\nThese general notions of property were then sufficient to answer all the\r\npurposes of human life; and might, perhaps, still have answered them, had\r\nit been possible for mankind to have remained in a state of primeval\r\nsimplicity, in which "all things were common to him." Not that this\r\ncommunion of goods seems ever to have been applicable, even in the\r\nearliest ages, to aught but the substance of the thing; nor could it be\r\nextended to the use of it. For, by the law of nature and reason, he who\r\nfirst began to use it, acquired therein a kind of transient property, that\r\nlasted so long as he was using it, and no longer. Or, to speak with\r\ngreater precision, the right of possession continued for the same time,\r\nonly, that the act of possession lasted.\r\n\r\nThus, the ground was in common, and no part of it was the permanent\r\nproperty of any man in particular; yet, whoever was in the occupation of\r\nany determined spot of it, for rest, for shade, or the like, acquired for\r\nthe time a sort of ownership, from which it would have been unjust and\r\ncontrary to the law of nature to have driven him by force; but, the\r\ninstant that he quitted the use or occupation of it, another might seize\r\nit without injustice. Thus, also, a vine or other tree might be said to be\r\nin common, as all men were equally entitled to its produce; and yet, any\r\nprivate individual might gain the sole property of the fruit which he had\r\ngathered for his own repast: a doctrine well illustrated by Cicero, who\r\ncompares the world to a great theater, which is common to the public, and\r\nyet the place which any man has taken is, for the time, his own.\r\n\r\nBut when mankind increased in number, craft, and ambition, it became\r\nnecessary to entertain conceptions of a more permanent dominion; and to\r\nappropriate to individuals not the immediate use only, but the very\r\nsubstance of the thing to be used. Otherwise, innumerable tumults must\r\nhave arisen, and the good order of the world been continually broken and\r\ndisturbed, while a variety of persons were striving who should get the\r\nfirst occupation of the same thing, or disputing which of them had\r\nactually gained it. As human life also grew more and more refined,\r\nabundance of conveniences were devised to render it more easy, commodious,\r\nand agreeable; as habitations for shelter and safety, and raiment for\r\nwarmth and decency. But no man would be at the trouble to provide either,\r\nso long as he had only a usufructuary property in them, which was to cease\r\nthe instant that he quitted possession; if, as soon as he walked out of\r\nhis tent or pulled off his garment, the next stranger who came by would\r\nhave a right to inhabit the one and to wear the other.\r\n\r\nIn the case of habitations, in particular, it was natural to observe that\r\neven the brute creation, to whom everything else was in common, maintained\r\na kind of permanent property in their dwellings, especially for the\r\nprotection of their young; that the birds of the air had nests, and the\r\nbeasts of the fields had caverns, the invasion of which they esteemed a\r\nvery flagrant injustice, and would sacrifice their lives to preserve them.\r\nHence a property was soon established in every man\'s house and homestead;\r\nwhich seem to have been originally mere temporary huts or movable cabins,\r\nsuited to the design of Providence for more speedily peopling the earth,\r\nand suited to the wandering life of their owners, before any extensive\r\nproperty in the soil or ground was established.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt but that movables of every kind became sooner\r\nappropriated than the permanent, substantial soil; partly because they\r\nwere more susceptible of a long occupancy, which might be continue for\r\nmonths together without any sensible interruption, and at length, by\r\nusage, ripen into an established right; but, principally, because few of\r\nthem could be fit for use till improved and meliorated by the bodily labor\r\nof the occupant; which bodily labor, bestowed upon any subject which\r\nbefore lay in common to all men, is universally allowed to give the\r\nfairest and most reasonable title to an exclusive property therein.\r\n\r\nThe article of food was a more immediate call, and therefore a more early\r\nconsideration. Such as were not contented with the spontaneous product of\r\nthe earth, sought for a more solid refreshment in the flesh of beasts,\r\nwhich they obtained by hunting. But the frequent disappointments incident\r\nto that method of provision, induced them to gather together such animals\r\nas were of a more tame and sequacious nature and to establish themselves\r\nin a less precarious manner, partly by the milk of the dams, and partly by\r\nthe flesh of the young.\r\n\r\nThe support of these their cattle made the article of water also a very\r\nimportant point. And, therefore, the book of Genesis, (the most venerable\r\nmonument of antiquity, considered merely with a view to history,) will\r\nfurnish us with frequent instances of violent contentions concerning\r\nwells; the exclusive property of which appears to have been established in\r\nthe first digger or occupant, even in places where the ground and herbage\r\nremained yet in common. Thus, we find Abraham, who was but a sojourner,\r\nasserting his right to a well in the country of Abimelech, and exacting an\r\noath for his security "because he had digged that well." And Isaac, about\r\nninety years afterwards, reclaimed this his father\'s property; and, after\r\nmuch contention with the Philistines, was suffered to enjoy it in peace.\r\n\r\nAll this while, the soil and pasture of the earth remained still in common\r\nas before, and open to every occupant; except, perhaps, in the\r\nneighborhood of towns, where the necessity of a sale and exclusive\r\nproperty in lands, (for the sake of agriculture,) was earlier felt, and\r\ntherefore more readily complied with. Otherwise, when the multitude of men\r\nand cattle had consumed every convenience on one spot of ground, it was\r\ndeemed a natural right to seize upon and occupy such other lands as would\r\nmore easily supply their necessities.\r\n\r\nWe have a striking example of this in the history of Abraham and his\r\nnephew Lot. When their joint substance became so great that pasture and\r\nother conveniences grew scarce, the natural consequence was that a strife\r\narose between their servants; so that it was no longer practicable to\r\ndwell together. This contention, Abraham thus endeavored to compose: "Let\r\nthere be no strife, I pray thee, between me and thee. Is not the whole\r\nland before thee? Separate thyself, I pray thee, from me. If thou wilt\r\ntake the left hand, then I will go to the right; or if thou depart to the\r\nright hand, then I will go to the left." This plainly implies an\r\nacknowledged right in either to occupy whatever ground he pleased that was\r\nnot preoccupied by other tribes. "And Lot lifted up his eyes, and beheld\r\nall the plain of Jordan, that it was well watered everywhere, even as the\r\ngarden of the Lord. Then Lot chose him all the plain of Jordan, and\r\njourneyed east; and Abraham dwelt in the land of Canaan."\r\n\r\nAs the world by degrees grew more populous, it daily became more difficult\r\nto find out new spots to inhabit, without encroaching upon former\r\noccupants; and, by constantly occupying the same individual spot, the\r\nfruits of the earth were consumed, and its spontaneous products destroyed\r\nwithout any provision for future supply or succession. It, therefore,\r\nbecame necessary to pursue some regular method of providing a constant\r\nsubsistence; and this necessity produced, or at least promoted and\r\nencouraged the art of agriculture. And the art of agriculture, by a\r\nregular connection and consequence, introduced and established the idea of\r\na more permanent property in the soil than had hitherto been received and\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nIt was clear that the earth would not produce her fruits in sufficient\r\nquantities without the assistance of tillage; but who would be at the\r\npains of tilling it, if another might watch an opportunity to seize upon\r\nand enjoy the product of his industry, art and labor? Had not, therefore,\r\na separate property in lands, as well as movables, been vested in some\r\nindividuals, the world must have continued a forest, and men have been\r\nmere animals of prey. Whereas, now, (so graciously has Providence\r\ninterwoven our duty and our happiness together,) the result of this very\r\nnecessity has been the ennobling of the human species, by giving it\r\nopportunities of improving its rational, as well as of exerting its\r\nnatural faculties.\r\n\r\nNecessity begat property; and, in order to insure that property, recourse\r\nwas had to civil society, which brought along with it a long train of\r\ninseparable concomitants: states, government, laws, punishments, and the\r\npublic exercise of religious duties. Thus connected together, it was found\r\nthat a part only of society was sufficient to provide, by their manual\r\nlabor, for the necessary subsistence of all; and leisure was given to\r\nothers to cultivate the human mind, to invent useful arts, and to lay the\r\nfoundations of science.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--Cicero. See note on page 156.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXIX. BATTLE OF WATERLOO. (415)\r\n\r\n  There was a sound of revelry by night,\r\n  And Belgium\'s capital had gathered then\r\n  Her Beauty and her Chivalry, and bright\r\n  The lamps shone o\'er fair women and brave men.\r\n  A thousand hearts beat happily; and when\r\n  Music arose with its voluptuous swell,\r\n  Soft eyes looked love to eyes which spake again,\r\n  And all went merry as a marriage bell;\r\nBut hush! hark!--a deep sound strikes like a rising knell!\r\n\r\n  Did ye not hear it?--No; \'t was but the wind,\r\n  Or the car rattling o\'er the stony street;\r\n  On with the dance! let joy be unconfined;\r\n  No sleep till morn, when Youth and Pleasure meet\r\n  To chase the glowing Hours with flying feet--\r\n  But, hark!--that heavy sound breaks in once mere,\r\n  As if the clouds its echo would repeat,\r\n  And nearer, clearer, deadlier than before!\r\nArm! arm! it is--it is the cannon\'s opening roar!\r\n\r\n  Ah! then and there was hurrying to and fro,\r\n  And gathering tears, and tremblings of distress,\r\n  And cheeks all pale, which, but an hour ago\r\n  Blushed at the praise of their own loveliness;\r\n  And there were sudden partings, such as press\r\n  The life from out young hearts, and choking sighs\r\n  Which ne\'er might be repeated: who could guess\r\n  If ever more should meet those mutual eyes,\r\nSince upon night so sweet such awful morn could rise.\r\n\r\n  And there was mounting in hot haste: the steed,\r\n  The mustering squadron, and the clattering car\r\n  Went pouring forward with impetuous speed,\r\n  And swiftly forming in the ranks of war;\r\n  And the deep thunder, peal on peal afar;\r\n  And near, the beat of the alarming drum\r\n  Roused up the soldier ere the morning star;\r\n  While thronged the citizens with terror dumb,\r\n  Or whispering with white lips--"The foe! They come!\r\nThey come!"\r\n\r\n  And Ardennes waves above them her green leaves,\r\n  Dewy with nature\'s tear-drops, as they pass,\r\n  Grieving, if aught inanimate e\'er grieves,\r\n  Over the unreturning brave!--alas!\r\n  Ere evening to be trodden like the grass,\r\n  Which, now, beneath them, but above, shall grow,\r\n  In its next verdure, when this fiery mass\r\n  Of living valor, rolling on the foe,\r\nAnd burning with high hope, shall molder, cold and low\r\n\r\n  Last noon beheld them full of lusty life,\r\n  Last eve in beauty\'s circle proudly gay,\r\n  The midnight brought the signal sound of strife,\r\n  The morn, the marshaling in arms,--the day,\r\n  Battle\'s magnificently stern array!\r\n  The thunderclouds close o\'er it, which when rent,\r\n  The earth is covered thick with other clay,\r\n  Which her own clay shall cover, heaped and pent,\r\nRider and horse,--friend, foe,--in one red burial blent.\r\n                                                        --Byron.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--The Battle of Waterloo was fought on June 18th, 1815, between the\r\nFrench army on one side, commanded by Napoleon Bonaparte, and the English\r\narmy and allies on the other side, commanded by the Duke of Wellington. At\r\nthe commencement of the battle, some of the officers were at a ball at\r\nBrussels, a short distance from Waterloo, and being notified of the\r\napproaching contest by the cannonade, left the ballroom for the field of\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\nThe wood of Soignies lay between the field of Waterloo and Brussels. It is\r\nsupposed to be a remnant of the forest of Ardennes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXX. "WITH BRAINS, SIR." (417)\r\n\r\nJohn Brown, 1810-1882, was born in Lanarkshire, Scotland, and graduated at\r\nthe University of Edinburgh. His father was John Brown, an eminent\r\nclergyman and the author of several books. Dr. Brown\'s literary reputation\r\nrests largely upon a series of papers contributed to the "North British\r\nReview." "Rab and his Friends," a collection of papers published in book\r\nform, is the most widely known of all his writings.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\n"Pray, Mr. Opie, may I ask you what you mix your colors with?" said a\r\nbrisk dilettante student to the great painter. "With brains, sir," was the\r\ngruff reply--and the right one. It did not give much of information; it\r\ndid not expound the principles and rules of the art; but, if the inquirer\r\nhad the commodity referred to, it would awaken him; it would set him\r\nagoing, athinking, and a-painting to good purpose. If he had not the\r\nwherewithal, as was likely enough, the less he had to do with colors and\r\ntheir mixture the better.\r\n\r\nMany other artists, when asked such a question, would have either set\r\nabout detailing the mechanical composition of such and such colors, in\r\nsuch and such proportions, rubbed up so and so; or perhaps they would (and\r\nso much the better, but not the best) have shown him how they laid them\r\non; but even this would leave him at the critical point. Opie preferred\r\ngoing to the quick and the heart of the matter: "With brains, sir."\r\n\r\nSir Joshua Reynolds was taken by a friend to see a picture. He was\r\nanxious to admire it, and he looked it over with a keen and careful but\r\nfavorable eye. "Capital composition; correct drawing; the color, tone,\r\nchiaroscuro excellent; but--but--it wants--hang it, it wants--that!"\r\nsnapping his fingers; and, wanting "that," though it had everything else,\r\nit was worth nothing.\r\n\r\nAgain, Etty was appointed teacher of the students of the Royal Academy,\r\nhaving been preceded by a clever, talkative, scientific expounder of\r\naesthetics, who delighted to tell the young men how everything was done,\r\nhow to copy this, and how to express that. A student came up to the new\r\nmaster, "How should I do this, sir?" "Suppose you try." Another, "What\r\ndoes this mean, Mr. Etty?" "Suppose you look." "But I have looked."\r\n"Suppose you look again."\r\n\r\nAnd they did try, and they did look, and looked again; and they saw and\r\nachieved what they never could have done had the how or the what\r\n(supposing this possible, which it is not, in full and highest meaning)\r\nbeen told them, or done for them; in the one case, sight and action were\r\nimmediate, exact, intense, and secure; in the other, mediate, feeble, and\r\nlost as soon as gained.\r\n\r\nNOTES.--Opie, John (b. 1761, d. 1807), was born in Wales, and was known as\r\nthe "Cornish wonder." He became celebrated as a portrait painter, but\r\nafterwards devoted himself to historical subjects. He was professor of\r\npainting at the Royal Academy.\r\n\r\nReynolds. See note on page 379.\r\n\r\nEtty, William (b. 1787, d. 1849), is considered one of the principal\r\nartists of the modern English school. His pictures are mainly historical.\r\n\r\nThe Royal Academy of Arts, in London, was founded in 1768. It is under the\r\ndirection of forty artists of the first rank in their several professions,\r\nwho have the title of "Royal Academicians." The admission to the Academy\r\nis free to all properly qualified students.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXXI. THE NEW ENGLAND PASTOR. (419)\r\n\r\nTimothy Dwight, 1752-1817, was born at Northampton, Massachusetts. His\r\nmother was a daughter of the celebrated Jonathan Edwards. It is said that\r\nshe taught her son the alphabet in one lesson, that he could read the\r\nBible at four years of age, and that he studied Latin by himself at six.\r\nHe graduated at Yale in 1769, returned as tutor in 1771, and continued six\r\nyears. He was chaplain in a brigade under General Putnam for a time. In\r\n1778 his father died, and for five years he supported his mother and a\r\nfamily of twelve children by farming, teaching and preaching. From 1783 to\r\n1795 he was pastor at Greenfield, Connecticut. He was then chosen\r\nPresident of Yale College, and remained in office till he died. Dr. Dwight\r\nwas a man of fine bodily presence, of extended learning, and untiring\r\nindustry. His presidency of the college was highly successful. His\r\npatriotism was no less ardent and true than his piety. In his younger days\r\nhe wrote considerably in verse. His poetry is not all of a very high\r\norder, but some pieces possess merit.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\n  The place, with east and western sides,\r\nA wide and verdant street divides:\r\nAnd here the houses faced the day,\r\nAnd there the lawns in beauty lay.\r\nThere, turret-crowned, and central, stood\r\nA neat and solemn house of God.\r\nAcross the way, beneath the shade\r\nTwo elms with sober silence spread,\r\nThe preacher lived. O\'er all the place\r\nHis mansion cast a Sunday grace;\r\nDumb stillness sate the fields around;\r\nHis garden seemed a hallowed ground;\r\nSwains ceased to laugh aloud, when near,\r\nAnd schoolboys never sported there.\r\n\r\n  In the same mild and temperate zone,\r\nTwice twenty years, his course had run,\r\nHis locks of flowing silver spread\r\nA crown of glory o\'er his head;\r\nHis face, the image of his mind,\r\nWith grave and furrowed wisdom shined;\r\nNot cold; but glowing still, and bright;\r\nYet glowing with October light:\r\nAs evening blends, with beauteous ray,\r\nApproaching night with shining day.\r\n\r\n  His Cure his thoughts engrossed alone:\r\nFor them his painful course was run:\r\nTo bless, to save, his only care;\r\nTo chill the guilty soul with fear;\r\nTo point the pathway to the skies,\r\nAnd teach, and urge, and aid, to rise;\r\nWhere strait, and difficult to keep,\r\nIt climbs, and climbs, o\'er Virtue\'s steep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXXII. DEATH OF ABSALOM. (420)\r\n\r\nDavid numbered the people that were with him, and set captains of\r\nthousands and captains of hundreds over them. And David sent forth a third\r\npart of the people under the hand of Joab, and a third part under the hand\r\nof Abishai, the son of Zeruiah, Joab\'s brother, and a third part under the\r\nhand of Ittai, the Gittite.\r\n\r\nAnd the king said unto the people, I will surely go forth with you myself\r\nalso. But the people answered, thou shalt not go forth; for if we flee\r\naway, they will not care for us; neither if half of us die, will they care\r\nfor us; but now thou art worth ten thousand of us; therefore now it is\r\nbetter that thou succor us out of the city. And the king said unto them,\r\nWhat seemeth you best, I will do.\r\n\r\nAnd the king stood by the gate side, and all the people came out by\r\nhundreds and by thousands. And the king commanded Joab, and Abishai, and\r\nIttai, saying, Deal gently for my sake with the young man, even with\r\nAbsalom. And all the people heard when the king gave all the captains\r\ncharge concerning Absalom.\r\n\r\nSo the people went out into the field against Israel; and the battle was\r\nin the wood of Ephraim; where the people of Israel were slain before the\r\nservants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of\r\ntwenty thousand men. For the battle was there scattered over the face of\r\nall the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the sword\r\ndevoured.\r\n\r\nAnd Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and\r\nthe mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught\r\nhold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth; and\r\nthe mule that was under him went away.\r\n\r\nAnd a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom\r\nhanged in an oak. And Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold,\r\nthou sawest him, and why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and\r\nI would have given thee ten shekels of silver and a girdle. And the man\r\nsaid unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand shekels of silver in my\r\nhand, yet would I not put forth my hand against the king\'s son; for, in\r\nour hearing, the king charged thee, and Abishai, and Ittai, saying, Beware\r\nthat none touch the young man Absalom. Otherwise, I should have wrought\r\nfalsehood against mine own life; for there is no matter hid from the king,\r\nand thou thyself wouldst have set thyself against me.\r\n\r\nThen said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts in\r\nhis hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was yet\r\nalive in the midst of the oak. And ten young men that bare Joab\'s armor,\r\ncompassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him. And Joab blew the\r\ntrumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after Israel; for Joab held\r\nback the people.\r\n\r\nAnd they took Absalom, and cast him into a great pit in the wood, and laid\r\na very great heap of stones upon him; and all Israel fled, everyone to his\r\ntent. Now Absalom, in his lifetime, had taken and reared up for himself a\r\npillar, which is in the king\'s dale; for he said, I have no son to keep my\r\nname in remembrance; and he called the pillar after his own name; and it\r\nis called unto this day, Absalom\'s Place.\r\n\r\nThen said Ahimaaz, the son of Zadok, Let me now run, and bear the king\r\ntidings, how that the Lord hath avenged him of his enemies. And Joab said\r\nunto him, Thou shalt not bear tidings this day, but thou shalt bear\r\ntidings another day: but this day thou shalt bear no tidings, because the\r\nking\'s son is dead. Then said Joab to Cushi, Go, tell the king what thou\r\nhast seen. And Cushi bowed himself unto Joab, and ran.\r\n\r\nThen said Ahimaaz the son of Zadok yet again to Joab, But howsoever, let\r\nme, I pray thee, also run after Cushi. And Joab said, Wherefore wilt thou\r\nrun, my son, seeing that thou hast no tidings ready? But howsoever, said\r\nhe, let me run. And he said unto him, run. Then Ahimaaz ran by the way of\r\nthe plain, and overran Cushi.\r\n\r\nAnd David sat between the two gates; and the watchman went up to the roof\r\nover the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked, and\r\nbehold, a man running alone. And the watchman cried, and told the king.\r\nAnd the king said, If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth. And he\r\ncame apace, and drew near.\r\n\r\nAnd the watchman saw another man running, and the watchman called unto the\r\nporter, and said, Behold, another man running alone. And the king said, He\r\nalso bringeth tidings. And the watchman said, Methinketh the running of\r\nthe foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz the son of Zadok. And the king\r\nsaid, He is a good man, and cometh with good tidings.\r\n\r\nAnd Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell down\r\nto the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed be the Lord\r\nthy God, which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their hand against\r\nmy lord the king. And the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And\r\nAhimaaz answered, When Joab sent the king\'s servant, and me thy servant, I\r\nsaw a great tumult, but I knew not what it was. And the king said unto\r\nhim, Turn aside and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.\r\n\r\nAnd behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings my lord the king; for the\r\nLord hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against thee. And\r\nthe king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Cushi\r\nanswered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise against thee\r\nto do thee hurt, be as that young man is.\r\n\r\nAnd the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate, and\r\nwept; and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom! my son, my son\r\nAbsalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!\r\n                                                 --II Samuel, Chap. xviii.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXXIII. ABRAHAM DAVENPORT. (424)\r\n\r\n\'T was on a May day of the far old year\r\nSeventeen hundred eighty, that there fell\r\nOver the bloom and sweet life of the Spring,\r\nOver the fresh earth and the heaven of noon,\r\nA horror of great darkness, like the night\r\nIn day of which the Norland sagas tell,\r\nThe Twilight of the Gods.\r\n\r\n                          The low-hung sky\r\nWas black with ominous clouds, save where its rim\r\nWas fringed with a dull glow, like that which climbs\r\nThe crater\'s sides from the red hell below.\r\nBirds ceased to sing, and all the barnyard fowls\r\nRoosted; the cattle at the pasture bars\r\nLowed, and looked homeward; bats on leathern wings\r\nFlitted abroad; the sounds of labor died;\r\nMen prayed, and women wept; all ears grew sharp\r\nTo hear the doom blast of the trumpet shatter\r\nThe black sky, that the dreadful face of Christ\r\nMight look from the rent clouds, not as he looked\r\nA loving guest at Bethany, but stern\r\nAs Justice and inexorable Law.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile in the old Statehouse, dim as ghosts,\r\nSat the lawgivers of Connecticut,\r\nTrembling beneath their legislative robes.\r\n"It is the Lord\'s Great Day! Let us adjourn,"\r\nSome said; and then, as if with one accord,\r\nAll eyes were turned to Abraham Davenport.\r\n\r\nHe rose, slow-cleaving with his steady voice\r\nThe intolerable hush. "This well may be\r\nThe Day of Judgment which the world awaits;\r\nBut be it so or not, I only know\r\nMy present duty, and my Lord\'s command\r\nTo occupy till he come. So at the post\r\nWhere he hath set me in his providence,\r\nI choose, for one, to meet him face to face,\r\nNo faithless servant frightened from my task,\r\nBut ready when the Lord of the harvest calls;\r\nAnd therefore, with all reverence, I would say,\r\nLet God do his work, we will see to ours.\r\nBring in the candles." And they brought them in.\r\n\r\nThen by the flaring lights the Speaker read,\r\nAlbeit with husky voice and shaking hands,\r\nAn act to amend an act to regulate\r\nThe shad and alewive fisheries. Whereupon,\r\nWisely and well spake Abraham Davenport,\r\nStraight to the question, with no figures of speech\r\nSave the ten Arab signs, yet not without\r\nThe shrewd, dry humor natural to the man:\r\nHis awe-struck colleagues listening all the while,\r\nBetween the pauses of his argument,\r\nTo hear the thunder of the wrath of God\r\nBreak from the hollow trumpet of the cloud.\r\n\r\nAnd there he stands in memory to this day,\r\nErect, self-poised, a rugged face, half seen\r\nAgainst the background of unnatural dark,\r\nA witness to the ages as they pass,\r\nThat simple duty hath no place for fear.\r\n                                             --Whittier.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.--The "Dark Day," as it is known, occurred May 19th, 1780, and\r\nextended over all New England. The darkness came on about ten o\'clock in\r\nthe morning, and lasted with varying degrees of intensity until midnight\r\nof the next day. The cause of the phenomenon is unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXXIV. THE FALLS OF THE YOSEMITE. (426)\r\n\r\nThomas Starr King, 1824-1863, was born in New York City. His father was a\r\nUniversalist minister; and, in 1834, he settled in Charlestown,\r\nMassachusetts. The son was preparing to enter Harvard University, when the\r\ndeath of his father devolved upon him the support of his mother, and his\r\ncollegiate course had to be given up. He spent several years as clerk and\r\nteacher, improving meanwhile all possible opportunities for study. In 1846\r\nhe was settled over the church to which his father had preached in\r\nCharlestown. Two years later, he was called to the Hollis Street Unitarian\r\nChurch in Boston. Here his eloquence and active public spirit soon made\r\nhim well known. He also gained much reputation as a public lecturer. In\r\n1860 he left the East to take charge of the Unitarian church in San\r\nFrancisco. During the remaining years of his life, he exercised much\r\ninfluence in the public affairs of California. He died suddenly, of\r\ndiphtheria, in the midst of his brilliant career.\r\n\r\nMr. King was a great lover of nature. His "White Hills," describing the\r\nmountain scenery of New Hampshire, is the most complete book ever written\r\nconcerning that interesting region.\r\n###\r\n\r\nThe Yosemite valley, in California, is a pass about ten miles long. At its\r\neastern extremity it leads into three narrower passes, each of which\r\nextends several miles, winding by the wildest paths into the heart of the\r\nSierra Nevada chain of mountains. For seven miles of the main valley,\r\nwhich varies in width from three quarters of a mile to a mile and a half,\r\nthe walls on either side are from two thousand to nearly five thousand\r\nfeet above the road, and are nearly perpendicular. From these walls, rocky\r\nsplinters a thousand feet in height start up, and every winter drop a few\r\nhundred tons of granite, to adorn the base of the rampart with picturesque\r\nruin.\r\n\r\nThe valley is of such irregular width, and bends so much and often so\r\nabruptly, that there is a great variety and frequent surprise in the forms\r\nand combinations of the overhanging rocks as one rides along the bank of\r\nthe stream. The patches of luxuriant meadow, with their dazzling green,\r\nand the grouping of the superb firs, two hundred feet high, that skirt\r\nthem, and that shoot above the stout and graceful oaks and sycamores\r\nthrough which the horse path winds, are delightful rests of sweetness and\r\nbeauty amid the threatening awfulness.\r\n\r\nThe Merced, which flows through the same pass, is a noble stream, a\r\nhundred feet wide and ten feet deep. It is formed chiefly of the streams\r\nthat leap and rush through the narrower passes, and it is swollen, also,\r\nby the bounty of the marvelous waterfalls that pour down from the ramparts\r\nof the wider valley. The sublime poetry of Habakkuk is needed to describe\r\nthe impression, and, perhaps, the geology, of these mighty fissures: "Thou\r\ndidst cleave the earth with rivers."\r\n\r\nAt the foot of the breakneck declivity of nearly three thousand feet by\r\nwhich we reach the banks of the Merced, we are six miles from the hotel,\r\nand every rod of the ride awakens wonder, awe, and a solemn joy. As we\r\napproach the hotel, and turn toward the opposite bank of the river, what\r\nis that\r\n\r\n    "Which ever sounds and shines,\r\n    A pillar of white light upon the wall\r\n    Of purple cliffs aloof descried"?\r\n\r\nThat, reader, is the highest waterfall in the world--the Yosemite\r\ncataract, nearly twenty-five hundred feet in its plunge, dashing from a\r\nbreak or depression in a cliff thirty-two hundred feet sheer.\r\n\r\nA writer who visited this valley in September, calls the cataract a mere\r\ntape line of water dropped from the sky. Perhaps it is so, toward the\r\nclose of the dry season; but as we saw it, the blended majesty and beauty\r\nof it, apart from the general sublimities of Yosemite gorge, would repay a\r\njourney of a thousand miles. There was no deficiency of water. It was a\r\npowerful stream, thirty-five feet broad, fresh from the Nevada, that made\r\nthe plunge from the brow of the awful precipice.\r\n\r\nAt the first leap it clears fourteen hundred and ninety-seven feet; then\r\nit tumbles down a series of steep stairways four hundred and two feet, and\r\nthen makes a jump to the meadows five hundred and eighteen feet more. But\r\nit is the upper and highest cataract that is most wonderful to the eye, as\r\nwell as most musical. The cliff is so sheer that there is no break in the\r\nbody of the water during the whole of its descent of more than a quarter\r\nof a mile. It pours in a curve from the summit, fifteen hundred feet, to\r\nthe basin that hoards it but a moment for the cascades that follow.\r\n\r\nAnd what endless complexities and opulence of beauty in the forms and\r\nmotions of the cataract! It is comparatively narrow at the top of the\r\nprecipice, although, as we said, the tide that pours over is thirty-five\r\nfeet broad. But it widens as it descends, and curves a little on one side\r\nas it widens, so that it shapes itself, before it reaches its first bowl\r\nof granite, into the figure of a comet. More beautiful than the comet,\r\nhowever, we can see the substance of this watery loveliness ever renew\r\nitself and ever pour itself away.\r\n\r\n  "It mounts in spray the skies, and thence again\r\n    Returns in an unceasing shower, which round\r\n  With its unemptied cloud of gentle rain,\r\n    Is an eternal April to the ground,\r\n    Making it all one emerald;--how profound\r\n  The gulf! and how the giant element\r\n    From rock to rock leaps with delirious bound,\r\n  Crushing the cliffs."\r\n\r\nThe cataract seems to shoot out a thousand serpentine heads or knots of\r\nwater, which wriggle down deliberately through the air and expend\r\nthemselves in mist before half the descent is over. Then a new set burst\r\nfrom the body and sides of the fall, with the same fortune on the\r\nremaining distance; and thus the most charming fretwork of watery nodules,\r\neach trailing its vapory train for a hundred feet or more, is woven all\r\nover the cascade, which swings, now and then, thirty feet each way, on the\r\nmountain side, as if it were a pendulum of watery lace. Once in a while,\r\ntoo, the wind manages to get back of the fall, between it and the cliff,\r\nand then it will whirl it round and round for two or three hundred feet,\r\nas if to try the experiment of twisting it to wring it dry.\r\n\r\nOf course I visited the foot of the lowest fall of the Yosemite, and\r\nlooked up through the spray, five hundred feet, to its crown. And I tried\r\nto climb to the base of the first or highest cataract, but lost my way\r\namong the steep, sharp rocks, for there is only one line by which the\r\ncliff can be scaled. But no nearer view that I found or heard described,\r\nis comparable with the picture, from the hotel, of the comet curve of the\r\nupper cataract, fifteen hundred feet high, and the two falls immediately\r\nbeneath it, in which the same water leaps to the level of the quiet\r\nMerced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXXV. A PSALM OF LIFE. (429)\r\n\r\nTell me not, in mournful numbers,\r\n  Life is but an empty dream!\r\nFor the soul is dead that slumbers,\r\n  And things are not what they seem.\r\n\r\nLife is real! Life is earnest!\r\n  And the grave is not its goal;\r\nDust thou art, to dust returnest,\r\n  Was not spoken of the soul.\r\n\r\nNot enjoyment, and not sorrow,\r\n  Is our destined end or way;\r\nBut to act, that each to-morrow\r\n  Find us farther than to-day.\r\n\r\nArt is long, and Time is fleeting,\r\n  And our hearts, though stout and brave,\r\nStill, like muffled drums, are beating\r\n  Funeral marches to the grave.\r\n\r\nIn the world\'s broad field of battle,\r\n  In the bivouac of Life,\r\nBe not like dumb, driven cattle!\r\n  Be a hero in the strife!\r\n\r\nTrust no Future, howe\'er pleasant!\r\n  Let the dead Past bury its dead!\r\nAct--act in the living Present!\r\n  Heart within, and God o\'erhead.\r\n\r\nLives of great men all remind us\r\n  We can make our lives sublime,\r\nAnd, departing, leave behind us\r\n  Footprints on the sands of time;--\r\n\r\nFootprints, that perhaps another,\r\n  Sailing o\'er life\'s solemn main,\r\nA forlorn and shipwrecked brother,\r\n  Seeing, shall take heart again.\r\n\r\nLet us, then, be up and doing,\r\n  With a heart for any fate;\r\n  Still achieving, still pursuing,\r\nLearn to labor and to wait.\r\n                                  --Longfellow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXXVI. FRANKLIN\'S ENTRY INTO PHILADELPHIA. (431)\r\n\r\nBenjamin Franklin, 1706-1790, was born in Boston. He received little\r\nschooling, but being apprenticed to his brother, a printer, he acquired a\r\ntaste for reading and study. In 1723, he went to Philadelphia, where he\r\nfollowed his chosen calling, and in time became the publisher of the\r\n"Pennsylvania Gazette" and the celebrated "Poor Richard\'s Almanac."\r\n\r\nAs a philosopher Franklin was rendered famous by his discovery of the\r\nidentity of lightning with electricity. His career in public affairs may\r\nbe briefly summarized as follows: In 1736 he was made Clerk of the\r\nProvincial Assembly; in 1737, deputy postmaster at Philadelphia; and in\r\n1753, Postmaster general for British America. He was twice in England as\r\nthe agent of certain colonies. After signing the Declaration of\r\nIndependence, he was sent as Minister Plenipotentiary to France in 1776.\r\nOn his return, in 1785, he was made "President of the Commonwealth of\r\nPennsylvania," holding the office three years. He was also one of the\r\nframers of the Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\nAs a writer Franklin commenced his career when only twelve years old by\r\ncomposing two ballads, which, however, he condemned as "wretched stuff."\r\nFranklin\'s letters and papers on electricity, afterwards enlarged by\r\nessays on various philosophical subjects, have been translated into Latin,\r\nFrench, Italian, and German. The most noted of his works, and the one from\r\nwhich the following extract is taken, is his "Autobiography." This book is\r\n"one of the half dozen most widely popular books ever printed," and has\r\nbeen published in nearly every written language. Franklin founded the\r\nAmerican Philosophical Society, and established an institution which has\r\nsince grown into the University of Pennsylvania. His life is a noble\r\nexample of the results of industry and perseverance, and his death was the\r\noccasion of public mourning.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nWalking in the evening by the side of the river, a boat came by, which I\r\nfound was going towards Philadelphia, with several people in her. They\r\ntook me in, and, as there was no wind, we rowed all the way; and about\r\nmidnight, not having yet seen the city, some of the company were confident\r\nwe must have passed it, and would row no farther; the others knew not\r\nwhere we were; so we put toward the shore, got into a creek, landed near\r\nan old fence, with the rails of which we made a fire, the night being\r\ncold, in October, and there we remained till daylight.\r\n\r\nThen one of the company knew the place to be Cooper\'s Creek, a little\r\nabove Philadelphia, which we saw as soon as we got out of the creek, and\r\narrived there about eight or nine o\'clock on the Sunday morning, and\r\nlanded at the Market Street wharf.\r\n\r\nI have been the more particular in this description of my journey, and\r\nshall be so of my first entry into that city, that you may in your mind\r\ncompare such unlikely beginnings with the figure I have since made there.\r\n\r\nI was in my working dress, my best clothes being to come round by sea. I\r\nwas dirty from my journey; my pockets were stuffed out with shirts and\r\nstockings, and I knew no soul nor where to look for lodging. I was\r\nfatigued with traveling, rowing, and want of rest; I was very hungry; and\r\nmy whole stock of cash consisted of a Dutch dollar, and about a shilling\r\nin copper. The latter I gave the people of the boat for my passage, who at\r\nfirst refused it on account of my rowing; but I insisted on their taking\r\nit,--a man being sometimes more generous when he has but a little money\r\nthan when he has plenty, perhaps through fear of being thought to have but\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\nThen I walked up the street gazing about, till, near the market house, I\r\nmet a boy with bread. I had made many a meal on bread, and, inquiring\r\nwhere he got it, I went immediately to the baker\'s he directed me to, in\r\nSecond Street, and asked for biscuit, intending such as we had in Boston:\r\nbut they, it seems, were not made in Philadelphia. Then I asked for a\r\nthreepenny loaf, and was told they had none such. So not considering or\r\nknowing the difference of money, and the greater cheapness nor the names\r\nof his bread, I bade him give threepenny worth of any sort. He gave me,\r\naccordingly, three great puffy rolls. I was surprised at the quantity, but\r\ntook it, and, having no room in my pockets, walked off with a roll under\r\neach arm, and eating the other.\r\n\r\nThus I went up Market Street as far as Fourth Street, passing by the door\r\nof Mr. Read, my future wife\'s father: when she, standing at the door, saw\r\nme, and thought I made, as I certainly did, a most awkward, ridiculous\r\nappearance. Then I turned and went down Chestnut Street and part of Walnut\r\nStreet, eating my roll all the way, and, coming round, found myself again\r\nat Market Street wharf, near the boat I came in, to which I went for a\r\ndraught of the river water; and, being filled with one of my rolls, gave\r\nthe other two to a woman and her child that came down the river in the\r\nboat with us, and were waiting to go farther.\r\n\r\nThus refreshed, I walked again up the street, which by this time had many\r\nclean-dressed people in it, who were all walking the same way. I joined\r\nthem, and thereby was led into the great meetinghouse of the Quakers, near\r\nthe market. I sat down among them, and, after looking round awhile and\r\nhearing nothing said, being very drowsy through labor and want of rest the\r\npreceding night, I fell fast asleep, and continued so till the meeting\r\nbroke up, when one was kind enough to rouse me. This was, therefore, the\r\nfirst house I was in, or slept in, in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nWalking down again toward the river, and looking in the faces of people, I\r\nmet a young Quaker man, whose countenance I liked, and, accosting him,\r\nrequested he would tell me where a stranger could get lodging. We were\r\nthen near the sign of the Three Mariners. "Here," says he, "is one place\r\nthat entertains strangers, but it is not a reputable house; if thee wilt\r\nwalk with me, I\'ll show thee a better." He brought me to the Crooked\r\nBillet, in Water Street. Here I got a dinner; and, while I was eating it,\r\nseveral sly questions were asked me, as it seemed to be suspected from my\r\nyouth and appearance that I might be some runaway. After dinner my\r\nsleepiness returned, and, being shown to a bed, I lay down without\r\nundressing, and slept till six in the evening; was called to supper, went\r\nto bed again very early, and slept soundly till next morning.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.--The river referred to is the Delaware. Franklin was on his way from\r\nBoston to Philadelphia, and had just walked from Amboy to Burlington, New\r\nJersey, a distance of fifty miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXXVII. LINES TO A WATERFOWL. (434)\r\n\r\n    Whither \'midst falling dew,\r\nWhile glow the heavens with the last steps of day,\r\nFar, through their rosy depths, dost thou pursue\r\n    Thy solitary way?\r\n\r\n    Vainly the fowler\'s eye\r\nMight mark thy distant flight to do thee wrong,\r\nAs, darkly painted on the crimson sky,\r\n    Thy figure floats along.\r\n\r\n    Seek\'st thou the plashy brink\r\nOf weedy lake, or marge of river wide,\r\nOr where the rocky billows rise and sink\r\n    On the chafed ocean side?\r\n\r\n    There is a Power whose care\r\nTeaches thy way along that pathless coast.\r\nThe desert and illimitable air,\r\n    Lone wandering, but not lost.\r\n\r\n    All day, thy wings have fanned,\r\nAt that far height, the cold, thin atmosphere,\r\nYet stoop not, weary, to the welcome land\r\n    Though the dark night is near.\r\n\r\n    And soon that toil shall end,\r\nSoon shalt thou find a summer home, and rest,\r\nAnd scream among thy fellows; reeds shall bend,\r\n    Soon, o\'er thy sheltered nest.\r\n\r\n    Thou\'rt gone; the abyss of heaven\r\nHath swallowed up thy form; yet, on my heart,\r\nDeeply has sunk the lesson thou hast given,\r\n    And shall not soon depart.\r\n\r\n    He, who, from zone to zone,\r\nGuides through the boundless sky thy certain flight,\r\nIn the long way that I must tread alone,\r\n    Will lead my steps aright.\r\n                                                     --Bryant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXXVIII. GOLDSMITH AND ADDISON. (435)\r\n\r\nWilliam Makepeace Thackeray, 1811-1863, was born in Calcutta, and is one\r\nof the most popular of English novelists, essayists, and humorists. While\r\na boy, he removed from India to England, where he was educated at the\r\nCharterhouse in London, and at Cambridge. When twenty-one years of age, he\r\ncame into possession of about 20,000 pounds. He rapidly dissipated his\r\nfortune, however, and was compelled to work for his living, first turning\r\nhis attention to law and then to art, but finally choosing literature as\r\nhis profession. He was for many years correspondent, under assumed names,\r\nat the "London Times," "The New Monthly Magazine," "Punch," and "Fraser\'s\r\nMagazine." His first novel under his own name, "Vanity Fair," appeared in\r\nmonthly numbers during 1846-8, and is generally considered his finest\r\nproduction: although "Pendennis," "Henry Esmond," and "The Newcomes" are\r\nalso much admired. His lectures on "English Humorists of the Eighteenth\r\nCentury," from which the following selections are taken, were delivered in\r\nEngland first in 1851, and afterwards in America, which he visited in 1852\r\nand again in 1855-6. During the latter visit, he first delivered his\r\ncourse of lectures on "The Four Georges," which were later repeated in\r\nEngland. At the close of 1859, Thackeray became editor of the "Cornhill\r\nMagazine," and made it one of the most successful serials ever published.\r\n\r\nThackeray has been charged with cynicism in his writings, but he was noted\r\nfor his happy temper and genial disposition towards all who came in\r\ncontact with him.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\n1. GOLDSMITH.\r\n\r\nTo be the most beloved of English writers, what a title that is for a man!\r\nA wild youth, wayward, but full of tenderness and affection, quits the\r\ncountry village where his boyhood has been passed in happy musing, in idle\r\nshelter, in fond longing to see the great world out of doors, and achieve\r\nname and fortune--and after years of dire struggle, and neglect, and\r\npoverty, his heart turning back as fondly to his native place as it had\r\nlonged eagerly for change when sheltered there, he writes a book and a\r\npoem, full of the recollections and feelings of home; he paints the\r\nfriends and scenes of his youth, and peoples Auburn and Wakefield with the\r\nremembrances of Lissoy.\r\n\r\nWander he must, but he carries away a home relic with him, and dies with\r\nit on his breast. His nature is truant; in repose it longs for change: as\r\non the journey it looks back for friends and quiet. He passes to-day in\r\nbuilding an air castle for to-morrow, or in writing yesterday\'s elegy; and\r\nhe would flyaway this hour, but that a cage, necessity, keeps him. What is\r\nthe charm of his verse, of his style, and humor? His sweet regrets, his\r\ndelicate compassion, his soft smile, his tremulous sympathy, the weakness\r\nwhich he owns?\r\n\r\nYour love for him is half pity. You come hot and tired from the day\'s\r\nbattle, and this sweet minstrel sings to you. Who could harm the kind\r\nvagrant harper? Whom did he ever hurt? He carries no weapon, save the harp\r\non which he plays to you, and with which he delights great and humble,\r\nyoung and old, the captains in the tents, or the soldiers round the fire,\r\nor the women and children in the villages, at whose porches he stops and\r\nsings his simple songs of love and beauty. With that sweet story of "The\r\nVicar of Wakefield" he has found entry into every castle and every hamlet\r\nin Europe. Not one of us, however busy or hard, but once or twice in our\r\nlives has passed an evening with him, and undergone the charm of his\r\ndelightful music.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. ADDISON. (436)\r\n\r\nWe love him for his vanities as much as his virtues. What is ridiculous is\r\ndelightful in him; we are so fond of him because we laugh at him so. And\r\nout of that laughter, and out of that sweet weakness, and out of those\r\nharmless eccentricities and follies, and out of that touched brain, and\r\nout of that honest manhood and simplicity--we get a result of happiness,\r\ngoodness, tenderness, pity, piety; such as doctors and divines but seldom\r\nhave the fortune to inspire. And why not? Is the glory of Heaven to be\r\nsung only by gentlemen in black coats?\r\n\r\nWhen this man looks from the world, whose weaknesses he describes so\r\nbenevolently, up to the Heaven which shines over us all, I can hardly\r\nfancy a human face lighted up with a more serene rapture; a human\r\nintellect thrilling with a purer love and adoration than Joseph Addison\'s.\r\nListen to him: from your childhood you have known the verses; but who can\r\nhear their sacred music without love and awe?\r\n\r\n  "Soon as the evening shades prevail,\r\n  The moon takes up the wondrous tale,\r\n  And nightly to the listening earth\r\n  Repeats the story of her birth;\r\n  And all the stars that round her burn,\r\n  And all the planets in their turn,\r\n  Confirm the tidings as they roll,\r\n  And spread the truth from pole to pole.\r\n\r\n  "What though, in solemn silence, all\r\n  Move round this dark terrestrial ball;\r\n  What though no real voice nor sound\r\n  Among their radiant orbs be found;\r\n  In reason\'s ear they all rejoice,\r\n  And utter forth a glorious voice,\r\n  Forever singing, as they shine,\r\n  The Hand that made us is divine."\r\n\r\nIt seems to me those verses shine like the stars. They shine out of a\r\ngreat, deep calm. When he turns to Heaven, a Sabbath comes over that man\'s\r\nmind; and his face lights up from it with a glory of thanks and prayers.\r\nHis sense of religion stirs through his whole being. In the fields, in the\r\ntown; looking at the birds in the trees; at the children in the streets;\r\nin the morning or in the moonlight; over his books in his own room; in a\r\nhappy party at a country merrymaking or a town assembly, good will and\r\npeace to God\'s creatures, and love and awe of Him who made them, fill his\r\npure heart and shine from his kind face. If Swift\'s life was the most\r\nwretched, I think Addison\'s was one of the most enviable. A life\r\nprosperous and beautiful--a calm death--an immense fame and affection\r\nafterwards for his happy and spotless name.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--Goldsmith (see biographical notice, page 215) founded his\r\ndescriptions of Auburn in the poem of "The Deserted Village," and of\r\nWakefield, in "The Vicar of Wakefield," on recollections of his early home\r\nat Lissoy. Ireland.\r\n\r\nAddison. See biographical notice, page 295. The quotation is from a\r\n"Letter from Italy to Charles Lord Halifax."\r\n\r\nSwift, Jonathan (b. 1667, d. 1745), the celebrated Irish satirist and\r\npoet, was a misanthrope. His disposition made his life miserable in the\r\nextreme, and he finally became insane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXXIX. IMMORTALITY OF THE SOUL. (438)\r\n\r\nSCENE--CATO, alone, sitting in a thoughtful posture;--in his hand,\r\n  Plato\'s book on the immortality of the soul; a drawn sword on the\r\n  table by him.\r\n\r\nCato. It must be so. Plato, thou reasonest well!\r\n      Else whence this pleasing hope, this fond desire,\r\n      This longing after immortality?\r\n      Or whence this secret dread, and inward horror,\r\n      Of falling into naught? Why shrinks the soul\r\n      Back on herself, and startles at destruction?\r\n      \'T is the divinity that stirs within us;\r\n      \'T is heaven itself that points out an hereafter,\r\n      And intimates eternity to man.\r\n      Eternity! thou pleasing, dreadful thought!\r\n      Through what variety of untried being,\r\n      Through what new scenes and changes must we pass?\r\n      The wide, unbounded prospect lies before me:\r\n      But shadows, clouds, and darkness rest upon it.\r\n      Here will I hold. If there\'s a Power above us,\r\n      (And that there is, all Nature cries aloud\r\n      Through all her works) he must delight in virtue;\r\n      And that which he delights in must be happy.\r\n      But when?--or where?--This world was made for Caesar.\r\n      I\'m weary of conjectures--this must end them.\r\n                              (Seizes the sword.)\r\n      Thus am I doubly armed: my death and life,\r\n      My bane and antidote are both before me.\r\n      This in a moment brings me to an end;\r\n      But this informs me I shall never die.\r\n      The soul, secured in her existence, smiles\r\n      At the drawn dagger and defies its point.\r\n      The stars shall fade away, the sun himself\r\n      Grow dim with age, and Nature sink in years;\r\n      But thou shalt flourish in immortal youth,\r\n      Unhurt amidst the war of elements,\r\n      The wrecks of matter, and the crush of worlds.\r\n                                                      --Addison.\r\n\r\nNOTES.--The above selection is Cato\'s soliloquy just before committing\r\nsuicide. It is from the tragedy of "Cato."\r\n\r\nCato, Marcus Porcius, (b. 95, d. 46 B. C.) was a Roman general, statesman,\r\nand philosopher. He was exceptionally honest and conscientious, and\r\nstrongly opposed Caesar and Pompey in their attempts to seize the state.\r\nWhen Utica, the last African city to resist Caesar, finally yielded, Cato\r\ncommitted suicide.\r\n\r\nPlato (b. 429, d. about 348 B. C.) was a celebrated Greek philosopher. His\r\nwritings are all in the form of dialogues, and have been preserved in a\r\nwonderfully perfect state.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXXX. CHARACTER OF WASHINGTON. (440)\r\n\r\nJared Sparks, 1789-1866, was born at Willington, Connecticut, and\r\ngraduated at Harvard in 1815. He was tutor in the University for two\r\nyears, and in 1819 was ordained pastor of the Unitarian Church in\r\nBaltimore. In 1823 he returned to Boston, purchased the "North American\r\nReview," and was its sole editor for seven years. From 1839 to 1849 he was\r\nProfessor in Harvard, and for the next three years was President of the\r\nUniversity. Mr. Sparks has written extensively on American history and\r\nbiography, including the lives of Washington and Franklin. He collected\r\nthe materials for his biographies with great care, and wrought them up\r\nwith much skill.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nThe person of Washington was commanding, graceful, and fitly proportioned;\r\nhis stature six feet, his chest broad and full, his limbs long and\r\nsomewhat slender, but well-shaped and muscular. His features were regular\r\nand symmetrical, his eyes of a light blue color, and his whole\r\ncountenance, in its quiet state, was grave, placid, and benignant. When\r\nalone, or not engaged in conversation, he appeared sedate and thoughtful;\r\nbut when his attention was excited, his eye kindled quickly, and his face\r\nbeamed with animation and intelligence.\r\n\r\nHe was not fluent in speech, but what he said was apposite, and listened\r\nto with the more interest as being known to come from the heart. He seldom\r\nattempted sallies of wit or humor, but no man received more pleasure from\r\nan exhibition of them by others; and, although contented in seclusion, he\r\nsought his chief happiness in society, and participated with delight in\r\nall its rational and innocent amusements. Without austerity on the one\r\nhand, or an appearance of condescending familiarity on the other, he was\r\naffable, courteous, and cheerful; but it has often been remarked that\r\nthere was a dignity in his person and manner not easy to be defined, which\r\nimpressed everyone that saw him for the first time with an instinctive\r\ndeference and awe. This may have arisen, in part, from a conviction of his\r\nsuperiority, as well as from the effect produced by his external form and\r\ndeportment.\r\n\r\nThe character of his mind was unfolded in the public and private acts of\r\nhis life; and the proofs of his greatness are seen almost as much in the\r\none as the other. The same qualities which raised him to the ascendency he\r\npossessed over the will of a nation, as the commander of armies and chief\r\nmagistrate, caused him to be loved and respected as an individual. Wisdom,\r\njudgment, prudence, and firmness were his predominant traits. No man ever\r\nsaw more clearly the relative importance of things and actions, or\r\ndivested himself more entirely of the bias of personal interest,\r\npartiality, and prejudice, in discriminating between the true and the\r\nfalse, the right and the wrong, in all questions and subjects that were\r\npresented to him. He deliberated slowly, but decided surely; and when his\r\ndecision was once formed he seldom reversed it, and never relaxed from the\r\nexecution of a measure till it was completed. Courage, physical and moral,\r\nwas a part of his nature; and, whether in battle, or in the midst of\r\npopular excitement, he was fearless of danger, and regardless of\r\nconsequences to himself.\r\n\r\nHis ambition was of that noble kind which aims to excel in whatever it\r\nundertakes, and to acquire a power over the hearts of men by promoting\r\ntheir happiness and winning their affections. Sensitive to the approbation\r\nof others, and solicitous to deserve it, he made no concessions to gain\r\ntheir applause, either by flattering their vanity or yielding to their\r\ncaprices. Cautious without timidity, bold without rashness, cool in\r\ncounsel, deliberate but firm in action, clear in foresight, patient under\r\nreverses, steady, persevering, and self-possessed, he met and conquered\r\nevery obstacle that obstructed his path to honor, renown and success. More\r\nconfident in the uprightness of his intention than in his resources, he\r\nsought knowledge and advice from other men. He chose his counselors with\r\nunerring sagacity; and his quick perception of the soundness of an\r\nopinion, and of the strong points in an argument, enabled him to draw to\r\nhis aid the best fruits of their talents, and the light of their collected\r\nwisdom.\r\n\r\nHis moral qualities were in perfect harmony with those of his intellect.\r\nDuty was the ruling principle of his conduct; and the rare endowments of\r\nhis understanding were not more constantly tasked to devise the best\r\nmethods of effecting an object, than they were to guard the sanctity of\r\nconscience. No instance can be adduced in which he was actuated by a\r\nsinister motive or endeavored to attain an end by unworthy means. Truth,\r\nintegrity, and justice were deeply rooted in his mind; and nothing could\r\nrouse his indignation so soon, or so utterly destroy his confidence, as\r\nthe discovery of the want of these virtues in anyone whom he had trusted.\r\nWeaknesses, follies, indiscretions be could forgive; but subterfuge and\r\ndishonesty he never forgot, rarely pardoned.\r\n\r\nHe was candid and sincere, true to his friends, and faithful to all;\r\nneither practicing dissimulation, descending to artifice, nor holding out\r\nexpectations which he did not intend should be realized. His passions were\r\nstrong, and sometimes they broke out with vehemence: but he had the power\r\nof checking them in an instant. Perhaps self-control was the most\r\nremarkable trait of his character. It was, in part, the effect of\r\ndiscipline; yet he seems by nature to have possessed this power in a\r\ndegree which has been denied to other men.\r\n\r\nA Christian in faith and practice, he was habitually devout. His reverence\r\nfor religion is seen in his example, his public communications, and his\r\nprivate writings. He uniformly ascribed his successes to the beneficent\r\nagency of the Supreme Being. Charitable and humane, he was liberal to the\r\npoor, and kind to those in distress. As a husband, son, and brother, he\r\nwas tender and affectionate. Without vanity, ostentation, or pride, he\r\nnever spoke of himself or his actions unless required by circumstances\r\nwhich concerned the public interests.\r\n\r\nAs he was free from envy, so he had the good fortune to escape the envy of\r\nothers by standing on an elevation which none could hope to attain. If he\r\nhad one passion more strong than another it was love of his country. The\r\npurity and ardor of his patriotism were commensurate with the greatness of\r\nits object. Love of country in him was invested with the sacred obligation\r\nof a duty; and from the faithful discharge of this duty he never swerved\r\nfor a moment, either in thought or deed, through the whole period of his\r\neventful career.\r\n\r\nSuch are some of the traits in the character of Washington, which have\r\nacquired for him the love and veneration of mankind. If they are not\r\nmarked with the brilliancy, extravagance, and eccentricity, which, in\r\nother men, have excited the astonishment of the world, so neither are they\r\ntarnished by the follies, nor disgraced by the crimes of those men. It is\r\nthe happy combination of rare talents and qualities, the harmonious union\r\nof the intellectual and moral powers, rather than the dazzling splendor of\r\nany one trait, which constitute the grandeur of his character. If the\r\ntitle of great man ought to be reserved for him who can not be charged\r\nwith an indiscretion or a vice; who spent his life in establishing the\r\nindependence, the glory, and durable prosperity of his country; who\r\nsucceeded in all that he undertook; and whose successes were never won at\r\nthe expense of honor, justice, integrity, or by the sacrifice of a single\r\nprinciple,--this title will not be denied to Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n      How sweetly on the ear such echoes sound!\r\n      While the mere victors may appall or stun\r\n      The servile and the vain, such names will be\r\n      A watchword till the future shall be free.\r\n                                                --Byron.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXXXI. EULOGY ON WASHINGTON. (444)\r\n\r\nGeneral Henry Lee, 1756-1818, a member of the celebrated Lee family of\r\nVirginia, was born in Westmoreland County in that state, and died on\r\nCumberland Island, Georgia. He graduated at Princeton in his eighteenth\r\nyear. In 1777 he marched with a regiment of cavalry to join the patriot\r\narmy, and served with fidelity and success till the close of the war. He\r\nwas noted for his bravery, skill, and celerity, and received the nickname\r\nof "Light-horse Harry." He was a great favorite with both General Greene\r\nand General Washington. In 1786 Virginia appointed him one of her\r\ndelegates to Congress; he also took an active part in favor of the\r\nadoption of the constitution in the Virginia Convention of 1788. On the\r\nbreaking out of the "Whisky Rebellion" in Pennsylvania, in 1794, the\r\nPresident sent General Lee with an army to suppress the disturbance. The\r\ninsurgents submitted without resistance. In 1799 he was again a member of\r\nCongress; and, on the death of Washington, that body appointed him to\r\npronounce a eulogy upon the life and character of the great and good man.\r\nThe following extract contains the closing part of the oration.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nWho is there that has forgotten the vales of Brandywine, the fields of\r\nGermantown, or the plains of Monmouth? Everywhere present, wants of every\r\nkind obstructing, numerous and valiant armies encountering, himself a\r\nhost, he assuaged our sufferings, limited our privations, and upheld our\r\ntottering Republic. Shall I display to you the spread of the fire of his\r\nsoul by rehearsing the praises of the hero of Saratoga, and his much-loved\r\ncompeer of the Carolinas? No; our Washington wears not borrowed glory. To\r\nGates--to Greene, he gave without reserve the applause due to their\r\neminent merit; and long may the chiefs of Saratoga and of Eutaw receive\r\nthe grateful respect of a grateful people.\r\n\r\nMoving in his own orbit, he imparted heat and light to his most distant\r\nsatellites; and, combining the physical and moral force of all within his\r\nsphere, with irresistible weight he took his course, commiserating folly,\r\ndisdaining vice, dismaying treason, and invigorating despondency; until\r\nthe auspicious hour arrived, when, united with the intrepid forces of a\r\npotent and magnanimous ally, he brought to submission Cornwallis, since\r\nthe conqueror of India; thus finishing his long career of military glory\r\nwith a luster corresponding to his great name, and in this his last act of\r\nwar, affixing the seal of fate to our nation\'s birth.\r\n\r\nFirst in war, first in peace, and first in the hearts of his countrymen,\r\nhe was second to none in humble and endearing scenes of private life.\r\nPious, just, humane, temperate, sincere, uniform, dignified, and\r\ncommanding, his example was edifying to all around him, as were the\r\neffects of that example lasting.\r\n\r\nTo his equals, he was condescending; to his inferiors, kind; and to the\r\ndear object of his affections, exemplarily tender. Correct throughout,\r\nvice shuddered in his presence, and virtue always felt his fostering hand;\r\nthe purity of his private character gave effulgence to his public virtues.\r\n\r\nHis last scene comported with the whole tenor of his life. Although in\r\nextreme pain, not a sigh, not a groan, escaped him; and with undisturbed\r\nserenity he closed his well-spent life. Such was the man America has lost!\r\nSuch was the man for whom our nation mourns!\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--At Brandywine Creek, in Pennsylvania, 18,000 British, under Howe,\r\ndefeated 13,000 Americans under Washington.\r\n\r\nGermantown, near Philadelphia, was the scene of an American defeat by the\r\nBritish, the same generals commanding as at Brandywine.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Monmouth, in New Jersey, resulted in victory for the\r\nAmericans.\r\n\r\nThe hero of Saratoga was General Gates, who there compelled the surrender\r\nof General Burgoyne.\r\n\r\nAt Eutaw Springs, General Greene defeated a superior force of British.\r\n\r\nCornwallis, Charles, second earl and first marquis (b. 1738, d. 1805),\r\nsurrendered his forces to a combined American and French army and French\r\nfleet at Yorktown, in 1781, virtually ending the war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXXXII. THE SOLITARY REAPER. (446)\r\n\r\nWilliam Wordsworth, 1770-1850, the founder of the "Lake School" of poets,\r\nwas born at Cockermouth, Cumberland, England. From his boyhood he was a\r\ngreat lover and student of nature, and it is to his beautiful descriptions\r\nof landscape, largely, that he owes his fame. He was a graduate of\r\nCambridge University, and while there commenced the study of Chaucer,\r\nSpenser, Milton, and Shakespeare, as models for his own writings. Two\r\nlegacies having been bequeathed him, Wordsworth determined to make poetry\r\nthe aim of his life, and in 1795 located at Racedown with his sister\r\nDorothy, where he commenced the tragedy of "The Borderers." A visit from\r\nColeridge at this period made the two poets friends for life. In 1802\r\nWordsworth married Miss Mary Hutchinson, and in 1813 he settled at Rydal\r\nMount, on Lake Windermere, where he passed the remainder of his life.\r\n\r\nWordsworth\'s poetry is remarkable for its extreme simplicity of language.\r\nAt first his efforts were almost universally ridiculed, and in 1819 his\r\nentire income from literary work had not amounted to 140 Pounds. In 1830\r\nhis merit began to be recognized; in 1839 Oxford University conferred upon\r\nhim the degree of D. C. L.; and in 1843 he was made poet laureate.\r\n\r\n"The Excursion" is by far the most beautiful and the most important of\r\nWordsworth\'s productions. "Salisbury Plain," "The White Doe of Rylstone,"\r\n"Yarrow Revisited," and many of his sonnets and minor poems are also much\r\nadmired.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nBehold her, single in the field,\r\nYon solitary Highland lass!\r\nReaping and singing by herself;\r\nStop here, or gently pass!\r\nAlone she cuts and binds the grain,\r\nAnd sings a melancholy strain;\r\nOh listen! for the vale profound\r\nIs overflowing with the sound.\r\n\r\nNo nightingale did ever chant\r\nMore welcome notes to weary bands\r\nOf travelers in some shady haunt,\r\nAmong Arabian sands:\r\nA voice so thrilling ne\'er was heard\r\nIn springtime from the cuckoo bird,\r\nBreaking the silence of the seas\r\nAmong the farthest Hebrides.\r\n\r\nWill no one tell me what she sings?\r\nPerhaps the plaintive numbers flow\r\nFor old, unhappy, far-off things,\r\nAnd battles long ago:\r\nOr is it some more humble lay,\r\nFamiliar matter of to-day?\r\nSome natural sorrow, loss, or pain,\r\nThat has been, and may be again?\r\n\r\nWhate\'er the theme, the maiden sang\r\nAs if her song could have no ending;\r\nI saw her singing at her work,\r\nAnd o\'er the sickle bending;--\r\nI listened motionless and still;\r\nAnd, as I mounted up the hill,\r\nThe music in my heart I bore,\r\nLong after it was heard no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXXXIII. VALUE OF THE PRESENT. (447)\r\n\r\nRalph Waldo Emerson, 1803-1882, the celebrated essayist and philosopher,\r\nwas born in Boston. His father was a Unitarian minister, and the son,\r\nafter graduating at Harvard University, entered the ministry also, and\r\ntook charge of a Unitarian congregation in Boston. His peculiar ideas on\r\nreligious topics soon caused him to retire from the ministry, and he then\r\ndevoted himself to literature. As a lecturer, Emerson attained a wide\r\nreputation, both in this country and in England, and he is considered as\r\none of the most independent and original thinkers of the age. His style is\r\nbrief and pithy, dazzling by its wit, but sometimes paradoxical. He wrote\r\na few poems, but they are not generally admired, being didactic in style,\r\nbare, and obscure. Among his best known publications are his volume\r\n"Nature," and his lectures, "The Mind and Manners of the Nineteenth\r\nCentury," "The Superlative in Manners and Literature," "English Character\r\nand Manners," and "The Conduct of Life." In 1850 appeared "Representative\r\nMen," embracing sketches of Plato, Swedenborg, Montaigne, Shakespeare,\r\nNapoleon, and Goethe.\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch are the days,--the earth is the cup, the sky is the cover, of the\r\nimmense bounty of nature which is offered us for our daily aliment; but\r\nwhat a force of illusion begins life with us, and attends us to the end!\r\nWe are coaxed, flattered, and duped, from morn to eve, from birth to\r\ndeath; and where is the old eye that ever saw through the deception? The\r\nHindoos represent Maia, the illusory energy of Vishnu, as one of his\r\nprincipal attributes. As if, in this gale of warring elements, which life\r\nis, it was necessary to bind souls to human life as mariners in a tempest\r\nlash themselves to the mast and bulwarks of a ship, and Nature employed\r\ncertain illusions as her ties and straps,--a rattle, a doll, an apple, for\r\na child; skates, a river, a boat, a horse, a gun, for the growing\r\nboy;--and I will not begin to name those of the youth and adult, for they\r\nare numberless. Seldom and slowly the mask falls, and the pupil is\r\npermitted to see that all is one stuff, cooked and painted under many\r\ncounterfeit appearances. Hume\'s doctrine was that the circumstances vary,\r\nthe amount of happiness does not; that the beggar cracking fleas in the\r\nsunshine under a hedge, and the duke rolling by in his chariot, the girl\r\nequipped for her first ball, and the orator returning triumphant from the\r\ndebate, had different means, but the same quantity of pleasant excitement.\r\n\r\nThis element of illusion lends all its force to hide the values of present\r\ntime. Who is he that does not always find himself doing something less\r\nthan his best task? "What are you doing?" "Oh, nothing; I have been doing\r\nthus, or I shall do so or so, but now I am only--" Ah! poor dupe, will you\r\nnever slip out of the web of the master juggler?--never learn that, as\r\nsoon as the irrecoverable years have woven their blue glory between to-day\r\nand us, these passing hours shall glitter and draw us, as the wildest\r\nromance and the homes of beauty and poetry? How difficult to deal erect\r\nwith them! The events they bring, their trade, entertainments, and gossip,\r\ntheir urgent work, all throw dust in the eyes and distract attention. He\r\nis a strong man who can look them in the eye, see through this juggle,\r\nfeel their identity, and keep his own; who can know surely that one will\r\nbe like another to the end of the world, nor permit love, or death, or\r\npolitics, or money, war, or pleasure, to draw him from his task.\r\n\r\nThe world is always equal to itself, and every man in moments of deeper\r\nthought is apprised that he is repeating the experiences of the people in\r\nthe streets of Thebes or Byzantium. An everlasting Now reigns in nature,\r\nwhich hangs the same roses on our bushes which charmed the Roman and the\r\nChaldean in their hanging gardens. "To what end, then," he asks, "should I\r\nstudy languages, and traverse countries, to learn so simple truths?"\r\n\r\nHistory of ancient art, excavated cities, recovery of books and\r\ninscriptions,--yes, the works were beautiful, and the history worth\r\nknowing; and academies convene to settle the claims of the old schools.\r\nWhat journeys and measurements,--Niebuhr and Muller and Layard,--to\r\nidentify the plain of Troy and Nimroud town! And your homage to Dante\r\ncosts you so much sailing; and to ascertain the discoverers of America\r\nneeds as much voyaging as the discovery cost. Poor child! that flexible\r\nclay of which these old brothers molded their admirable symbols was not\r\nPersian, nor Memphian, nor Teutonic, nor local at all, but was common lime\r\nand silex and water, and sunlight, the heat of the blood, and the heaving\r\nof the lungs; it was that clay which thou heldest but now in thy foolish\r\nhands, and threwest away to go and seek in vain in sepulchers, mummy pits,\r\nand old bookshops of Asia Minor, Egypt, and England. It was the deep\r\nto-day which all men scorn; the rich poverty, which men hate; the\r\npopulous, all-loving solitude, which men quit for the tattle of towns. He\r\nlurks, he hides,--he who is success, reality, joy, and power. One of the\r\nillusions is that the present hour is not the critical, decisive hour.\r\nWrite it on your heart that every day is the best day in the year. No man\r\nhas learned anything rightly, until he knows that every day is Doomsday.\r\n\'T is the old secret of the gods that they come in low disguises. \'T is\r\nthe vulgar great who come dizened with gold and jewels. Real kings hide\r\naway their crowns in their wardrobes, and affect a plain and poor\r\nexterior. In the Norse legend of our ancestors, Odin dwells in a fisher\'s\r\nhut, and patches a boat. In the Hindoo legends, Hari dwells a peasant\r\namong peasants. In the Greek legend, Apollo lodges with the shepherds of\r\nAdmetus; and Jove liked to rusticate among the poor Ethiopians. So, in our\r\nhistory, Jesus is born in a barn, and his twelve peers are fishermen. \'T\r\nis the very principle of science that Nature shows herself best in leasts;\r\n\'t was the maxim of Aristotle and Lucretius; and, in modern times, of\r\nSwedenborg and of Hahnemann. The order of changes in the egg determines\r\nthe age of fossil strata. So it was the rule of our poets, in the legends\r\nof fairy lore, that the fairies largest in power were the least in size.\r\n\r\nIn the Christian graces, humility stands highest of all, in the form of\r\nthe Madonna; and in life, this is the secret of the wise. We owe to genius\r\nalways the same debt, of lifting the curtain from the common, and showing\r\nus that divinities are sitting disguised in the seeming gang of gypsies\r\nand peddlers. In daily life, what distinguishes the master is the using\r\nthose materials he has, instead of looking about for what are more\r\nrenowned, or what others have used well. "A general," said Bonaparte,\r\n"always has troops enough, if he only knows how to employ those he has,\r\nand bivouacs with them." Do not refuse the employment which the hour\r\nbrings you, for one more ambitious. The highest heaven of wisdom is alike\r\nnear from every point, and thou must find it, if at all, by methods native\r\nto thyself alone.\r\n\r\nNOTES.--The Brahmanic religion teaches a Trinity, of which Vishnu is the\r\nsavior of mankind.\r\n\r\nThebes, the ancient capital of Upper Egypt, was at its most flourishing\r\nperiod about 1500 B. C. Byzantium was an important Greek city during the\r\nsecond and third centuries B. C.\r\n\r\nNiebuhr (b. 1776, d. 1831), Muller (b. 1797, d. 1840), and Layard (b.\r\n1817, d. 1894), are celebrated archaeologists. The first two were Germans,\r\nand the last an Englishman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXXXIV. HAPPINESS. (451)\r\n\r\nAlexander Pope, 1688-1744, was the shining literary light of the so-called\r\nAugustan reign of Queen Anne, the poetry of which was distinguished by the\r\nhighest degree of polish and elegance. Pope was the son of a retired linen\r\ndraper, who lived in a pleasant country house near the Windsor Forest. He\r\nwas so badly deformed that his life was "one long disease;" he was\r\nremarkably precocious, and had a most intelligent face, with great,\r\nflaming, tender eyes. In disposition Pope was the reverse of admirable. He\r\nwas extremely sensitive, petulant, and supercilious; fierce and even\r\ncoarse in his attacks on opponents; boastful of his self-acquired wealth\r\nand of his intimacy with the nobility. The great redeeming feature of his\r\ncharacter was his tender devotion to his aged parents.\r\n\r\nAs a poet, however, Pope challenges the highest admiration. At the age of\r\nsixteen he commenced his "Pastorals," and when only twenty-one published\r\nhis "Essay on Criticism," pronounced "the finest piece of argumentative\r\nand reasoning poetry in the English language." His reputation was now\r\nfirmly established, and his literary activity ceased only at his death;\r\nalthough, during the latter portion of his life, he was so weak physically\r\nthat he was unable to dress himself or even to rise from bed without\r\nassistance. Pope\'s great admiration was Dryden, whose style he studied and\r\ncopied. He lacks the latter\'s strength, but in elegance and polish he\r\nremains unequaled.\r\n\r\nPope\'s most remarkable work is "The Rape of the Lock;" his greatest, the\r\ntranslation into English verse of Homer\'s "Iliad" and "Odyssey." His\r\n"Epistle of Eloisa to Abelard," "The Dunciad," and the "Essay On Man" are\r\nalso famous productions. He published an edition of "Shakespeare," which\r\nwas awaited with great curiosity, and received with equal disappointment.\r\nDuring the three years following its appearance, he united with Swift and\r\nArbuthnot in writing the "Miscellanies," an extensive satire on the abuses\r\nof learning and the extravagances of philosophy. His "Epistles," addressed\r\nto various distinguished men, and covering a period of four years, were\r\ncopied after those of Horace; they were marked by great clearness,\r\nneatness of diction, and good sense, and by Pope\'s usual elegance and\r\ngrace. His "Imitations of Horace" was left unfinished at his death.\r\n\r\nThe following selection is an extract from the "Essay on Man;"\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nOh, sons of earth! attempt ye still to rise,\r\nBy mountains piled on mountains, to the skies?\r\nHeaven still with laughter the vain toil surveys,\r\nAnd buries madmen in the heaps they raise.\r\nKnow all the good that individuals find,\r\nOr God and nature meant to mere mankind.\r\nReason\'s whole pleasure, all the joys of sense,\r\nLie in three words,--health, peace, and competence.\r\n\r\nBut health consists with temperance alone;\r\nAnd peace, O virtue! peace is all thy own.\r\nThe good or bad the gifts of fortune gain;\r\nBut these less taste them as they worse obtain.\r\nSay, in pursuit of profit or delight,\r\nWho risk the most, that take wrong means or right?\r\nOf vice or virtue, whether blest or curst,\r\nWhich meets contempt, or which compassion first?\r\n\r\nCount all th\' advantage prosperous vice attains,\r\n\'T is but what virtue flies from and disdains:\r\nAnd grant the bad what happiness they would,\r\nOne they must want, which is, to pass for good.\r\nOh, blind to truth, and God\'s whole scheme below,\r\nWho fancy bliss to vice, to virtue woe!\r\nWho sees and follows that great scheme the best,\r\nBest knows the blessing, and will most be blest.\r\n\r\nBut fools the good alone unhappy call,\r\nFor ills or accidents that chance to all.\r\nThink we, like some weak prince, the Eternal Cause,\r\nProne for his favorites to reverse his laws?\r\nShall burning AEtna, if a sage requires,\r\nForget to thunder, and recall her fires?\r\nWhen the loose mountain trembles from on high,\r\nShall gravitation cease, if you go by?\r\n\r\n"But sometimes virtue starves while vice is fed."\r\nWhat, then? Is the reward of virtue bread?\r\nThat, vice may merit, \'t is the price of toil;\r\nThe knave deserves it when he tills the soil,\r\nThe knave deserves it when he tempts the main,\r\nWhere folly fights for kings or dives for gain.\r\nHonor and shame from no condition rise;\r\nAct well your part, there all the honor lies.\r\n\r\nWorth makes the man, and want of it the fellow;\r\nThe rest is all but leather or prunella.\r\nA wit\'s a feather, and a chief a rod,\r\nAn honest man\'s the noblest work of God.\r\nOne self-approving hour whole years outweighs\r\nOf stupid starers, and of loud huzzas.\r\n\r\nKnow then this truth (enough for man to know),\r\n"Virtue alone is happiness below."\r\nThe only point where human bliss stands still,\r\nAnd tastes the good without the fall to ill;\r\nWhere only merit constant pay receives,\r\nIs blest in what it takes and what it gives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXXXV. MARION. (453)\r\n\r\nWilliam Gilmore Simms, 1806-1870, one of the most versatile, prolific, and\r\npopular of American authors, was born at Charleston, South Carolina. His\r\nfamily was poor, and his means of education were limited, yet he managed\r\nto prepare himself for the bar, to which he was admitted when twenty-one\r\nyears of age. The law proving uncongenial, he abandoned it, and in 1828\r\nbecame editor of the "Charleston City Gazette." From this time till his\r\ndeath his literary activity was unceasing, and his writings were so\r\nnumerous that it is possible only to group them under their various heads.\r\nThey comprise Biography; History; Historical Romance, both Foreign and\r\nDomestic, the latter being further divided into Colonial, Revolutionary,\r\nand Border Romances; Pure Romance; The Drama; Poetry; and Criticism;\r\nbesides miscellaneous books and pamphlets.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this remarkable literary activity, Mr. Simms still found\r\ntime to devote to the affairs of state, being for several years a member\r\nof the South Carolina Legislature. He was also a lecturer, and was\r\nconnected editorially with several magazines. Most of his time was spent\r\nat his summer house in Charleston, and at his winter residence,\r\n"Woodlands," on a plantation at Midway, S. C.\r\n\r\nThe following selection is from "The Life and Times of Francis Marion."\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nArt had done little to increase the comforts or the securities of his\r\nfortress. It was one, complete to his hands, from those of nature--such an\r\none as must have delighted the generous English outlaw of Sherwood Forest;\r\ninsulated by deep ravines and rivers, a dense forest of mighty trees, and\r\ninterminable undergrowth. The vine and brier guarded his passes. The\r\nlaurel and the shrub, the vine and sweet-scented jessamine roofed his\r\ndwelling, and clambered up between his closed eyelids and the stars.\r\nObstructions scarcely penetrable by any foe, crowded the pathways to his\r\ntent; and no footstep not practiced in the secret, and to "the manner\r\nborn," might pass unchallenged to his midnight rest. The swamp was his\r\nmoat; his bulwarks were the deep ravines, which, watched by sleepless\r\nrifles, were quite as impregnable as the castles on the Rhine. Here, in\r\nthe possession of his fortress, the partisan slept secure.\r\n\r\nHis movements were marked by equal promptitude and wariness. He suffered\r\nno risks from a neglect of proper precaution. His habits of circumspection\r\nand resolve ran together in happy unison. His plans, carefully considered\r\nbeforehand, were always timed with the happiest reference to the condition\r\nand feelings of his men. To prepare that condition, and to train those\r\nfeelings, were the chief employment of his repose. He knew his game, and\r\nhow it should be played, before a step was taken or a weapon drawn.\r\n\r\nWhen he himself or any of his parties left the island upon an expedition,\r\nthey advanced along no beaten paths. They made them as they went. He had\r\nthe Indian faculty in perfection, of gathering his course from the sun,\r\nfrom the stars, from the bark and the tops of trees, and such other\r\nnatural guides as the woodman acquires only through long and watchful\r\nexperience.\r\n\r\nMany of the trails thus opened by him, upon these expeditions, are now the\r\nordinary avenues of the country. On starting, he almost invariably struck\r\ninto the woods, and seeking the heads of the larger water courses, crossed\r\nthem at their first and small beginnings. He destroyed the bridges where\r\nhe could. He preferred fords. The former not only facilitated the progress\r\nof less fearless enemies, but apprised them of his own approach. If speed\r\nwas essential, a more direct but not less cautious route was pursued.\r\n\r\nHe intrusted his schemes to nobody, not even his most confidential\r\nofficers. He consulted with them respectfully, heard them patiently,\r\nweighed their suggestions, and silently approached his conclusions. They\r\nknew his determinations only from his actions. He left no track behind\r\nhim, if it were possible to avoid it. He was often vainly hunted after by\r\nhis own detachments. He was more apt at finding them than they him. His\r\nscouts were taught a peculiar and shrill whistle, which, at night, could\r\nbe heard at a most astonishing distance. We are reminded of a signal of\r\nRoderick Dhu:--\r\n\r\n                  "He whistled shrill,\r\n    And he was answered from the hill;\r\n    Wild as the scream of the curlew,\r\n    From crag to crag the signal flew."\r\n\r\nHis expeditions were frequently long, and his men, hurrying forth without\r\ndue preparation, not unfrequently suffered much privation from want of\r\nfood. To guard against this danger, it was their habit to watch his cook.\r\nIf they saw him unusually busied in preparing supplies of the rude,\r\nportable food which it was Marion\'s custom to carry on such occasions,\r\nthey knew what was before them, and provided themselves accordingly. In no\r\nother way could they arrive at their general\'s intentions. His favorite\r\ntime for moving was with the setting sun, and then it was known that the\r\nmarch would continue all night.\r\n\r\nHis men were badly clothed in homespun,--a light wear which afforded\r\nlittle warmth. They slept in the open air, and frequently without a\r\nblanket. Their ordinary food consisted of sweet potatoes, garnished, on\r\nfortunate occasions, with lean beef. Their swords, unless taken from the\r\nenemy, were made out of mill saws, roughly manufactured by a forest\r\nblacksmith.\r\n\r\nHis scouts were out in all directions, and at all hours. They did the\r\ndouble duty of patrol and spies. They hovered about the posts of the\r\nenemy, crouching in the thicket, or darting along the plain, picking up\r\nprisoners, and information, and spoils together. They cut off stragglers,\r\nencountered patrols of the foe, and arrested his supplies on the way to\r\nthe garrison. Sometimes the single scout, buried in the thick tops of the\r\ntree, looked down upon the march of his legions, or hung, perched over the\r\nhostile encampment, till it slept; then slipping down, stole through the\r\nsilent host, carrying off a drowsy sentinel, or a favorite charger, upon\r\nwhich the daring spy flourished conspicuous among his less fortunate\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\nNOTES.--The outlaw of Sherwood Forest was Robin Hood.\r\n\r\nRoderick Dhu is a character in Sir Walter Scott\'s poem, "The Lady of the\r\nLake," from which the quotation is taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXXXVI. A COMMON THOUGHT. (456)\r\n\r\nHenry Timrod, 1829-1867, was born at Charleston, South Carolina. He\r\ninherited his father\'s literary taste and ability, and had the advantages\r\nof a liberal education. He entered the University of Georgia before he was\r\nseventeen years of age, and while there commenced his career as a poet.\r\nPoverty and ill health compelled him to leave the university without\r\ntaking a degree; he then commenced the study of law, and for ten years\r\ntaught in various private families. At the outbreak of the war, in 1860,\r\nhe warmly espoused the Southern cause, and wrote many stirring war lyrics.\r\nIn 1863 he joined the Army of the West, as correspondent of the Charleston\r\n"Mercury," and in 1864 he became editor of the "South Carolinian,"\r\npublished first at Columbia and later at Charleston. He also served for a\r\ntime as assistant secretary to Governor Orr. The advance of Sherman\'s army\r\nreduced him to poverty, and he was compelled to the greatest drudgery in\r\norder to earn a bare living. His health soon broke down, and he died of\r\nhemorrhage of the lungs. The following little poem seems, almost, to have\r\nbeen written under a presentiment, so accurately does it describe the\r\nclosing incidents of the poet\'s life.\r\n\r\nThe first volume of Timrod\'s poems appeared in 1860. A later edition, with\r\na memoir of the author, was published in New York in 1873.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nSomewhere on this earthly planet\r\n  In the dust of flowers that be,\r\nIn the dewdrop, in the sunshine,\r\n  Sleeps a solemn day for me.\r\n\r\nAt this wakeful hour of midnight\r\n  I behold it dawn in mist,\r\nAnd I hear a sound of sobbing\r\n  Through the darkness,--Hist! oh, hist!\r\n\r\nIn a dim and musky chamber,\r\n  I am breathing life away;\r\nSome one draws a curtain softly,\r\n  And I watch the broadening day.\r\n\r\nAs it purples in the zenith,\r\n  As it brightens on the lawn,\r\nThere\'s a hush of death about me,\r\n  And a whisper, "He is gone!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXXXVII. A DEFINITE AIM IN READING. (457)\r\n\r\nNoah Porter, 1811-1892, was born at Farmington, Conn., and graduated at\r\nYale in 1831. He remained in New Haven as a school-teacher, a tutor in\r\ncollege, and a student in the theological department until 1836, when he\r\nentered the ministry. In 1846 he was recalled to the college as Clark\r\nProfessor of Moral Philosophy and Metaphysics; and in 1858 he also assumed\r\nthe duties of the professorship of Systematic Theology, for a period of\r\nseven years. Upon the retirement of President Woolsey in 1871, he was\r\nelected to fill the office, which he held until 1886, being the eleventh\r\npresident of the college.\r\n\r\nPresident Porter\'s greatest literary work is entitled, "The Human\r\nIntellect: With an Introduction upon Psychology and the Human Soul." It is\r\nremarkable for the clear thought and sound judgment it displays, as well\r\nas for its broad scholarship; and it has been pronounced "the most\r\ncomplete and exhaustive exhibition of the cognitive faculties of the human\r\nsoul to be found in our language." His other important works are: "The\r\nSciences of Nature versus the Science of Man," which is a review of the\r\ndoctrines of Herbert Spencer; "American Colleges and the American Public;"\r\nand the book from which the following selection is taken, namely, "Books\r\nand Reading." Besides these he wrote numerous essays, contributions to\r\nperiodicals, etc. During his professorship he was called upon to act as\r\nchief editor in the important work of revising "Webster\'s Dictionary." The\r\nedition of 1864 was the result of his careful oversight, and the\r\nsubsequent revisions were also under his superintendence.\r\n##\r\n\r\n\r\nIn reading, we do well to propose to ourselves definite ends and purposes.\r\nThe more distinctly we are aware of our own wants and desires in reading,\r\nthe more definite and permanent will be our acquisitions. Hence it is a\r\ngood rule to ask ourselves frequently, "Why am I reading this book, essay,\r\nor poem? or why am I reading it at the present time rather than any\r\nother?" It may often be a satisfying answer, that it is convenient; that\r\nthe book happens to be at hand: or that we read to pass away the time.\r\nSuch reasons are often very good, but they ought not always to satisfy us.\r\nYet the very habit of proposing these questions, however they may be\r\nanswered, will involve the calling of ourselves to account for our\r\nreading, and the consideration of it in the light of wisdom and duty.\r\n\r\nThe distinct consciousness of some object at present before us, imparts a\r\nmanifoldly greater interest to the contents of any volume. It imparts to\r\nthe reader an appropriate power, a force of affinity, by which he\r\ninsensibly and unconsciously attracts to himself all that has a near or\r\neven a remote relation to the end for which he reads. Anyone is conscious\r\nof this who reads a story with the purpose of repeating it to an absent\r\nfriend; or an essay or a report with the design of using its facts or\r\narguments in a debate; or a poem with the design of reviving its imagery,\r\nand reciting its finest passages. Indeed, one never learns to read\r\neffectively until he learns to read in such a spirit--not always, indeed,\r\nfor a definite end, yet always with a mind attent to appropriate and\r\nretain and turn to the uses of culture, if not to a more direct\r\napplication.\r\n\r\nThe private history of every self-educated man, from Franklin onwards,\r\nattests that they all were uniformly not only earnest but select in their\r\nreading, and that they selected their books with distinct reference to the\r\npurposes for which they used them. Indeed, the reason why self-trained\r\nmen so often surpass men who are trained by others in the effectiveness\r\nand success of their reading, is that they know for what they read and\r\nstudy, and have definite aims and wishes in all their dealings with books.\r\nThe omnivorous and indiscriminate reader, who is at the same time a\r\nlistless and passive reader, however ardent is his curiosity, can never be\r\na reader of the most effective sort.\r\n\r\nAnother good rule is suggested by the foregoing. Always have some solid\r\nreading in hand; i. e., some work or author which we carry forward from\r\none day to another, or one hour of leisure to the next, with persistence,\r\ntill we have finished whatever we have undertaken. There are many great\r\nand successful readers who do not observe this rule, but it is a good rule\r\nnotwithstanding.\r\n\r\nThe writer once called upon one of the most extensive and persevering of\r\nmodern travelers, at an early hour of the day, to attend him upon a walk\r\nto a distant village. It was after breakfast, and though he had but few\r\nminutes at command, he was sitting with book in hand--a book of solid\r\nhistory he was perusing day after day. He remarked: "This has been my\r\nhabit for years in all my wanderings. It is the one habit which gives\r\nsolidity to my intellectual activities and imparts tone to my life. It is\r\nonly in this way that I can overcome and counteract the tendency to the\r\ndissipation of my powers and the distraction of my attention, as strange\r\npersons and strange scenes present themselves from day to day."\r\n\r\nTo the rule already given--read with a definite aim--we could add the\r\nrule--make your aims to be definite by continuously holding them rigidly\r\nto a single book at all times, except when relaxation requires you to\r\ncease to work, and to live for amusement and play. Always have at least\r\none iron in the fire, and kindle the fire at least once every day.\r\n\r\nIt is implied in the preceding that we should read upon definite subjects,\r\nand with a certain method and proportion in the choice of our books. If we\r\nhave a single object to accomplish in our reading for the present, that\r\nobject will of necessity direct the choice of what we read, and we shall\r\narrange our reading with reference to this single end. This will be a\r\nnucleus around which our reading will for the moment naturally gather and\r\narrange itself.\r\n\r\nIf several subjects seem to us equally important and interesting, we\r\nshould dispose of them in order, and give to each for the time our chief\r\nand perhaps our exclusive attention. That this is wise is so obvious as\r\nnot to require illustration. "One thing at a time," is an accepted\r\ncondition for all efficient activity, whether it is employed upon things\r\nor thoughts, upon men or books. If five or ten separate topics have equal\r\nclaim upon our interest and attention, we shall do to each the amplest\r\njustice, if we make each in its turn the central subject of our reading.\r\nThere is little danger of weariness or monotony from the workings of such\r\na rule.\r\n\r\nMost single topics admit or require a considerable variety of books, each\r\ndifferent from the other, and each supplementing the other. Hence it is\r\none of the best of practices in prosecuting a course of reading, to read\r\nevery author who can cast any light upon the subject which we have in\r\nhand. For example, if we are reading the history of the Great Rebellion in\r\nEngland, we should read, if we can, not a single author only, as\r\nClarendon, but a half dozen or a half score, each of whom writes from his\r\nown point of view, supplies what another omits, or corrects what he under-\r\nor overstates.\r\n\r\nBut, besides the formal histories of the period, there are the various\r\nnovels, the scenes and characters of which are placed in those times, such\r\nas Scott\'s Woodstock; there are also diaries, such as those by Evelyn,\r\nPepys, and Burton; and there are memoirs, such as those of Col.\r\nHutchinson; while the last two have been imitated in scores of fictions.\r\nThere are poems, such as those of Andrew Marvell, Milton, and Dryden.\r\nThere are also shoals of political tracts and pamphlets, of handbills and\r\ncaricatures.\r\n\r\nWe name these various descriptions of works and classes of reading, not\r\nbecause we suppose all of them are accessible to those readers who live at\r\na distance from large public libraries, or because we would advise\r\neveryone who may have access to such libraries, to read all these books\r\nand classes of books as a matter of course, but because we would\r\nillustrate how great is the variety of books and reading matter that are\r\ngrouped around a single topic, and are embraced within a single period.\r\n\r\nEvery person must judge for himself how long a time he can bestow upon any\r\nsingle subject, or how many and various are the books in respect to it\r\nwhich it is wise to read; but of this everyone may be assured, that it is\r\nfar easier, far more agreeable, and far more economical of time and\r\nenergy, to concentrate the attention upon a single subject at a time than\r\nto extend it to half a score, and that six books read in succession or\r\ntogether upon a single topic, are far more interesting and profitable than\r\ntwice as many which treat of topics remotely related. A lady well known to\r\nthe writer, of the least possible scholarly pretensions or literary\r\nnotoriety, spent fifteen months of leisure, snatched by fragments from\r\nonerous family cares and brilliant social engagements, in reading the\r\nhistory of Greece as written by a great variety of authors and as\r\nillustrated by many accessories of literature and art.\r\n\r\nNor should it be argued that such rules as these, or the habits which they\r\nenjoin, are suitable for scholars only, or for people who have much\r\nleisure for reading. It should rather be urged that those who can read the\r\nfewest books and who have at command the scantiest time, should aim to\r\nread with the greatest concentration and method; should occupy all of\r\ntheir divided energy with single centers of interest, and husband the few\r\nhours which they can command, in reading whatever converges to a definite,\r\nbecause to a single, impression.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXXXVIII. ODE TO MT. BLANC. (462)\r\n\r\nSamuel Taylor Coleridge, 1772-1834, was born in Devonshire, England, and\r\nwas educated at Christ\'s Hospital and Cambridge University. Through\r\npoverty he was compelled to enlist in the army, but his literary\r\nattainments soon brought him into notice, and he was enabled to withdraw\r\nfrom the distasteful life.\r\n\r\nColeridge\'s fame arises chiefly from his poems, of which the "Rime of the\r\nAncient Mariner," "Genevieve," and "Christabel" may be classed among the\r\nbest of English poetry. He also wrote a number of dramas, besides numerous\r\nessays on religious and political topics. As a conversationalist Coleridge\r\nhad a remarkable reputation, and among his ardent admirers and friends may\r\nbe ranked Southey, Wordsworth, Lovell, Lamb, and De Quincey. He and his\r\nfriends Southey and Lovell married sisters, and talked at one time of\r\nfounding a community on the banks of the Susquehanna. Although possessing\r\nsuch brilliant natural gifts, Coleridge fell far short of what he might\r\nhave attained, through a great lack of energy and application, increased\r\nby an excessive use of opium.\r\n###\r\n\r\n\r\nHast thou a charm to stay the morning star\r\nIn his steep course? So long he seems to pause\r\nOn thy bald, awful head, O sovran Blanc!\r\nThe Arve and Arveiron at thy base\r\nRave ceaselessly; but thou, most awful Form,\r\nRisest from forth thy silent sea of pines,\r\nHow silently! Around thee and above,\r\nDeep is the air and dark, substantial, black--\r\nAn ebon mass: methinks thou piercest it,\r\nAs with a wedge! But when I look again,\r\nIt is thine own calm home, thy crystal shrine,\r\nThy habitation from eternity!\r\nO dread and silent Mount! I gazed upon thee\r\nTill thou, still present to the bodily sense,\r\nDidst vanish from my thoughts: entranced in prayer,\r\nI worshiped the Invisible alone.\r\n\r\n  Yet, like some sweet, beguiling melody,\r\nSo sweet we know not we are listening to it,\r\nThou, the meanwhile, wast blending with my thought--\r\nYea, with my life and life\'s own secret joy\r\nTill the dilating soul, enrapt, transfused,\r\nInto the mighty vision passing--there,\r\nAs in her natural form, swelled vast to Heaven!\r\n\r\n  Awake, my soul! not only passive praise\r\nThou owest! not alone these swelling tears,\r\nMute thanks and secret ecstasy! Awake,\r\nVoice of sweet song! Awake, my heart, awake!\r\nGreen vales and icy cliffs, all join my hymn.\r\n\r\n  Thou first and chief, sole sovran of the vale!\r\nOh, struggling with the darkness all the night,\r\nAnd visited all night by troops of stars,\r\nOr when they climb the sky, or when they sink--\r\nCompanion of the morning star at dawn,\r\nThyself Earth\'s rosy star, and of the dawn\r\nCoherald--wake, oh wake, and utter praise!\r\nWho sank thy sunless pillars deep in earth?\r\nWho filled thy countenance with rosy light?\r\nWho made thee parent of perpetual streams?\r\n\r\n  And you, ye five wild torrents fiercely glad!\r\nWho called you forth from night and utter death,\r\nFrom dark and icy caverns called you forth,\r\nDown those precipitous, black, jagged rocks,\r\nForever shattered, and the same forever?\r\nWho gave you your invulnerable life,\r\nYour strength, your speed, your fury, and your joy,\r\nUnceasing thunder, and eternal foam?\r\nAnd who commanded (and the silence came),\r\nHere let the billows stiffen, and have rest?\r\n\r\n  Ye icefalls! ye that from the mountain\'s brow\r\nAdown enormous ravines slope amain--\r\nTorrents, methinks, that heard a mighty voice,\r\nAnd stopped at once amid their maddest plunge!\r\nMotionless torrents! silent cataracts!\r\nWho made you glorious as the gates of Heaven\r\nBeneath the keen full moon? Who bade the sun\r\nClothe you with rainbows? Who, with living flowers\r\nOf loveliest blue, spread garlands at your feet?\r\nGod!--let the torrents, like a shout of nations,\r\nAnswer! and let the ice plains echo, God!\r\nGod! sing ye meadow streams with gladsome voice!\r\nYe pine groves, with your soft and soul-like sounds!\r\nAnd they, too, have a voice, yon piles of snow,\r\nAnd in their perilous fall shall thunder, God!\r\n\r\n  Ye living flowers that skirt the eternal frost!\r\nYe wild goats sporting round the eagle\'s nest!\r\nYe eagles, playmates of the mountain storm!\r\nYe lightnings, the dread arrows of the clouds!\r\nYe signs and wonders of the elements!\r\nUtter forth, God, and fill the hills with praise!\r\n\r\n  Thou, too, hoar Mount! with thy sky-pointing peaks,\r\nOft from whose feet the avalanche, unheard,\r\nShoots downward, glittering through the pure serene,\r\nInto the depth of clouds that veil thy breast--\r\nThou too again, stupendous Mountain! thou\r\nThat as I raise my head, awhile bowed low\r\nIn adoration, upward from thy base,\r\nSlow traveling, with dim eyes suffused with tears,\r\nSolemnly seemest, like a vapory cloud,\r\nTo rise before me.--Rise, oh ever rise!\r\nRise like a cloud of incense from the Earth!\r\nThou kingly spirit throned among the hills,\r\nThou dread embassador from Earth to Heaven,\r\nGreat Hierarch! tell thou the silent sky,\r\nAnd tell the stars, and tell yon rising sun,\r\nEarth, with her thousand voices, praises God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of McGuffey\'s Sixth Eclectic Reader\r\nby William Holmes McGuffey\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MCGUFFEY\'S SIXTH ECLECTIC READER ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 16751.txt or 16751.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/6/7/5/16751/\r\n\r\nProduced by Don Kostuch\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
