The valves were made by threading a copper\r\nwasher, 3/8 in. in diameter, and screwing it on the end of the\r\nvalve rod, then wiping on roughly a tapered mass of solder and\r\ngrinding it into the seats B with emery and oil.\r\n\r\nThe valve rods operate in guides, D, made of 1/4-in. brass tubing,\r\nwhich passes through the top plate and into the heavy brass bar\r\ncontaining the valve seats and steam passages at the top, into\r\nwhich they are plug-fitted and soldered.\r\n\r\nThe location and arrangement of the valve seats and steam passages\r\nare shown in the sketch, the flat bar containing them being\r\nsoldered to the top plate.\r\n\r\nThe steam chest, A, over the valve mechanism is constructed of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Engine Details]\r\n\r\n1-in. square brass tubing, one side being sawed out and the open\r\nends fitted with pieces of 1/16 in. sheet brass and soldered. in.\r\nThe steam inlet is a gasoline pipe connection such as used on\r\nautomobiles.\r\n\r\nThe valve-operating cams, F, are made of the metal ends of an old\r\ntypewriter platen, one being finished to shape and then firmly\r\nfastened face to face to the other, and used as a pattern in\r\nfiling the other to shape. Attachment to the shaft, N, is by means\r\nof setscrews which pass through the sleeves.\r\n\r\nThe main bearings, M, on the supports, O, and the crank-end\r\nbearings of the connecting rods, K, are split and held in position\r\nby machine screws with provision for taking them up when worn.\r\n\r\nThe exhausting of spent steam is accomplished by means of slots,\r\nI, sawed into the fronts of the cylinders at about 1/8 in. above\r\nthe lowest position of the piston\'s top at the end of the stroke,\r\nat which position of the piston the valve rod drops into the\r\ncutout portion of the cam and allows the valve to seat.\r\n\r\nAll the work on this engine, save turning the pistons, which was\r\ndone in a machine shop for a small sum, and making the flywheel,\r\nthis being taken from an old dismantled model, was accomplished\r\nwith a hacksaw, bench drill, carborundum wheel, files, taps and\r\ndies. The base, Q, is made of a heavy piece of brass.\r\n\r\nThe action is smooth and the speed high. Steam is supplied by a\r\nsheet brass boiler of about 3 pt. capacity, heated with a Bunsen\r\nburner.\r\n--Contributed by Harry F. Lowe, Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Magic Spirit Hand [2]\r\n\r\nThe magic hand made of wax is given to the audience for\r\nexamination, also a board which is suspended by four pieces of\r\ncommon picture-frame wire. The hand is placed upon the board and\r\nanswers, by rapping, any question asked by members of the\r\naudience. The hand and the board may be examined at any time and\r\nyet the rapping can be continued, though surrounded by the\r\naudience.\r\n\r\nThe Magic Wand, London, gives the secret of this spirit hand as\r\nfollows: The hand is prepared by concealing in the wrist a few\r\nsoft iron plates, the wrist being afterwards bound with black\r\nvelvet as shown in Fig. 1. The board is hollow, the top being made\r\nof thin veneer (Fig. 2). A small magnet, A, is connected to a\r\nsmall flat pocket lamp battery, B. The board is suspended by four\r\nlengths of picture-frame wire one of which, E, is\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wax Hand on Board and Electrical Connections]\r\n\r\nconnected to the battery and another, D, to the magnet. The other\r\nwires, F and G, are only holding wires. All the wires are fastened\r\nto a small ornamental switch, H, which is fitted with a connecting\r\nplug at the top. The plug can be taken out or put in as desired.\r\n\r\nThe top of the board must be made to open or slide off so that\r\nwhen the battery is exhausted a new one can be installed.\r\nEverything must be firmly fixed to the board and the hollow space\r\nfilled in with wax, which will make the board sound solid when\r\ntapped.\r\n\r\nIn presenting the trick, the performer gives the hand and board\r\nwith wires and switch for examination, keeping the plug concealed\r\nin his right hand. When receiving the board back, the plug is\r\nsecretly pushed into the switch, which is held in the right hand.\r\nThe hand is then placed on the board over the magnet. When the\r\nperformer wishes the hand to move he pushes the plug in, which\r\nturns on the current and causes the magnet to attract the iron in\r\nthe wrist, and will, therefore, make the hand rap. The switch can\r\nbe made similar to an ordinary push button so the rapping may be\r\neasily controlled without detection by the audience.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Making Skis and Toboggans [3]\r\n\r\nDuring the winter months everyone is thinking of skating, coasting\r\nor ski running and jumping. Those too timid to run down a hill\r\nstanding upright on skis must take their pleasure in coasting or\r\nskating.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary ski can be made into a coasting ski-toboggan by\r\njoining two pairs together with bars without injury to their use\r\nfor running and jumping. The ordinary factory-made skis cost from\r\n$2.50 per pair up, but any boy can make an excellent pair far 50\r\ncents.\r\n\r\nIn making a pair of skis, select two strips of Norway pine free\r\nfrom knots, 1 in. thick, 4 in. wide and 7 or 8 ft. long. Try to\r\nprocure as fine and straight a grain as possible. The pieces are\r\ndressed thin at both ends leaving about 1 ft. in the center the\r\nfull thickness of 1 in., and gradually thinning to a scant 1/2 in.\r\nat the ends. One end of each piece is tapered to a point beginning\r\n12 in. from the end. A groove is cut on the under side, about 1/4\r\nin. wide and 1/8 in. deep, and running almost the full length of\r\nthe ski. This will make it track straight and tends to prevent\r\nside slipping. The shape of each piece for a ski, as it appears\r\nbefore bending, is shown in Fig. 1.\r\n\r\nThe pointed end of each piece is placed in boiling water for at\r\nleast 1 hour, after which the pieces are ready for bending. The\r\nbend is made on an ordinary stepladder. The pointed ends are stuck\r\nunder the back of one step and the other end securely tied to the\r\nladder, as shown in Fig. 2. They should remain tied to the ladder\r\n48 hours in a moderate temperature, after which they will hold\r\ntheir shape permanently.\r\n\r\nThe two straps, Fig. 3, are nailed an a little forward of the\r\ncenter of gravity so that when the foot is lifted, the front\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3 -- Forming the Skis]\r\n\r\nof the ski will be raised. Tack on a piece of sheepskin or deer\r\nhide where the foot rests, Fig. 4.\r\n\r\nThe best finish for skis is boiled linseed oil. After two or three\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4 -- The Toe Straps]\r\n\r\napplications the under side will take a polish like glass from the\r\ncontact with the snow.\r\n\r\nThe ski-toboggan is made by placing two pairs of skis together\r\nside by side\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5 -- Ski-Toboggan]\r\n\r\nand fastening them with two bars across the top. The bars are held\r\nwith V-shaped metal clips as shown in Fig. 5.\r\n--Contributed by Frank Scobie, Sleepy Eye, Minn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Homemade Life Preserver [4]\r\n\r\nProcure an inner tube of a bicycle tire, the closed-end kind, and\r\nfold it in four alternate sections, as shown in Fig. 1. Cut or\r\ntear a piece of cloth into strips about 1/2 in. wide, and knot\r\nthem together. Fasten this long strip of cloth to the folded tube\r\nand weave it alternately in and out, having each\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1, Fig. 2; Inner Tube and Cover]\r\n\r\nrun of the cloth about 4 in. apart, until it is bound as shown in\r\nFig. 1.\r\n\r\nMake a case of canvas that will snugly fit the folded tube when\r\ninflated. The straps that hold the preserver to the body may be\r\nmade of old suspender straps. They are sewed to the case at one\r\nend and fastened at the other with clasps such as used on overall\r\nstraps. The tube can be easily inflated by blowing into the valve,\r\nat the same time holding the valve stem down with the teeth. The\r\nfinished preserver is shown in Fig. 2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make Boomerangs [4]\r\n\r\nWhen the ice is too thin for skating and the snow is not right for\r\nskis, about the only thing to do is to stay in the house. A\r\nboomerang club will help to fill in between and also furnishes\r\ngood exercise for the muscles of the arm. A boomerang can be made\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bending and Cutting the Wood]\r\n\r\nof a piece of well seasoned hickory plank. The plank is well\r\nsteamed in a wash boiler or other large kettle and then bent to a\r\nnice curve, as shown in Fig. 1. It is held in this curve until\r\ndry, with two pieces nailed on the sides as shown.\r\n\r\nAfter the piece is thoroughly dried out, remove the side pieces\r\nand cut it into sections with a saw, as shown in Fig. 2. The\r\npieces are then dressed round. A piece of plank 12 in. wide and 2\r\nft. long will make six boomerangs.\r\n\r\nTo throw a boomerang, grasp it and hold the same as a club, with\r\nthe hollow side away from you. Practice first at some object about\r\n25 ft. distant, and in a short time the thrower will be able to\r\nhit the mark over 100 ft. away. Any worker in wood can turn out a\r\ngreat number of boomerangs cheaply.\r\n--Contributed by J. E. Noble, Toronto, Ontario.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make an Eskimo Snow House [5]\r\nBy GEORGE E. WALSH\r\n\r\nPlaying in the snow can be raised to a fine art if boys and girls\r\nwill build their creations with some attempt at architectural\r\nskill and not content themselves with mere rough work. Working in\r\nsnow and ice opens a wide field for an expression of taste and\r\ninvention, but the construction of houses and forts out of this\r\nplastic material provides the greatest amount of pleasure to the\r\nnormally healthy boy or girl.\r\n\r\nThe snow house of the Eskimo is probably the unhealthiest of\r\nbuildings made by any savage to live in, but it makes an excellent\r\nplayhouse in winter, and represents at the same time a most\r\ningenious employment of the arch system in building. The Eskimos\r\nbuild their snow houses without the aid of any scaffolding or\r\ninterior false work, and while there is a keystone at the top of\r\nthe dome, it is not essential to the support of the walls. These\r\nare self-supporting from the time the first snow blocks are put\r\ndown until the last course is laid.\r\n\r\nThe snow house is of the beehive shape and the ground plan is that\r\nof a circle. The circle is first laid out on the ground and a\r\nspace cleared for it. Then a row of snow blocks is laid on the\r\nground and another course of similar blocks placed on top. The\r\nsnow blocks are not exactly square in shape, but about 12 in.\r\nlong, 6 in. high and 4 or 5 in. thick. Larger or smaller blocks\r\ncan be used, according to size of the house and thickness of the\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\nFirst, the snow blocks must be packed and pressed firmly into\r\nposition out of moist snow that will pack. A very light, dry snow\r\nwill not pack easily, and it may be necessary to use a little\r\nwater. If the snow is of the right consistency, there will be no\r\ntrouble in packing and working with it. As most of the blocks are\r\nto be of the same size throughout, it will pay to make a mold for\r\nthem by forming a box of old boards nailed together, minus the\r\ntop, and with a movable bottom, or rather no bottom at all. Place\r\nthe four sided box on a flat board and ram snow in it, forcing it\r\ndown closely. Then by lifting the box up and tapping the box from\r\nabove, the block will drop out. In this way blocks of uniform size\r\nare formed, which makes the building simpler and easier.\r\n\r\nWhile one boy makes the blocks another can shave them off at the\r\nedges and two others can build the house, one inside of the circle\r\nand the other outside. The Eskimos build their snow houses in this\r\nway, and the man inside stays there until he is completely walled\r\nin. Then the door and a window are cut through the wall.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Laying the Snow Bricks]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Three-Room Snow House]\r\n\r\nEach layer of snow blocks must have a slight slant at the top\r\ntoward the center so that the walls will constantly curve inward.\r\nThis slant at the top is obtained better by slicing off the lower\r\nsurfaces of each block before putting it in its course. The top\r\nwill then have a uniform inward slant.\r\n\r\nThe first course of the snow house should be thicker than the\r\nothers, and the thickness of the walls gradually decreases toward\r\nthe top. A wall, however, made of 6-in. blocks throughout will\r\nhold up a snow house perfectly, if its top is no more than 6 or 7\r\nft. above the ground. If a higher house is needed the walls should\r\nbe thicker at the base and well up toward the middle.\r\n\r\nThe builder has no mortar for binding the blocks together, and\r\ntherefore he must make his joints smooth and even and force in\r\nloose snow to fill up the crevices. A little experience will\r\nenable one to do this work well, and the construction of the house\r\nwill proceed rapidly. The Eskimos build additions to their houses\r\nby adding various dome-shaped structures to one side, and the\r\nyoung architect can imitate them. Such dome-shaped structures are\r\nshown in one of the illustrations.\r\n\r\nA fact not well understood and appreciated is that the Eskimo\r\nbeehive snow house represents true arch building. It requires no\r\nscaffolding in building and it exerts no outward thrust. In the\r\nordinary keystone arch used by builders, a, temporary structure\r\nmust be erected to hold the walls up until the keystone is fitted\r\nin position, and the base must be buttressed against an outward\r\nthrust. The Eskimo does not have to consider these points. There\r\nis no outward thrust, and the top keystone is not necessary to\r\nhold the structure up. It is doubtful whether such an arch could\r\nbe built of brick or stone without scaffolding, but with the snow\r\nblocks it is a simple matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Secret Door Lock [6]\r\n\r\nThe sketch shows the construction of a lock I have on a door which\r\nis quite a mystery to those who do not know how it operates. It\r\nalso keeps them out. The parts of the lock on the inside of the\r\ndoor are shown in Fig. 1. These parts can be covered so that no\r\none can see them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3; The Lock Parts]\r\n\r\nThe ordinary latch and catch A are attached to the door in the\r\nusual manner. The latch is lifted with a stick of wood B, which is\r\nabout 1 ft. long and 1 in. wide, and pivoted about two-thirds of\r\nthe way from the top as shown. The latch A is connected to the\r\nstick B with a strong cord run through a staple to secure a\r\nright-angle pull between the pieces. A nail, C, keeps the stick B\r\nfrom falling over to the left. The piece of wood, D, is 6 or 8 in.\r\nlong and attached to a bolt that runs through the door, the\r\nopposite end being fastened to the combination dial. Two kinds of\r\ndials are shown in Fig. 2. The piece D is fastened on the bolt an\r\ninch or two from the surface of the door to permit placing a\r\nspiral spring of medium strength in between as shown in Fig. 3.\r\nThe opposite end of the bolt may be screwed into the dial, which\r\ncan be made of wood, or an old safe dial will do. A nail is driven\r\nthrough the outer end of the piece D and the end cut off so that\r\nit will pass over the piece B when the dial is turned. When the\r\ndial is pulled out slightly and then turned toward the right, the\r\nnail will catch on the piece B and open the latch. --Contributed\r\nby Geo. Goodbrod, Union, Ore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Convenient Hot-Dish Holder [7]\r\n\r\nWhen taking hot dishes from the stove, it is very convenient to\r\nhave holders handy for use. For this purpose I screwed two screw\r\neyes into the ceiling, one in front of the stove directly above\r\nthe place where the holder should hang, and the other back of the\r\nstove and out of the way. I next ran a strong cord through the two\r\neyes. To one end of the cord I attached a weight made of a clean\r\nlump of coal. The cord is just long enough to let the weight hang\r\na few inches above the floor and pass through both screw eyes. I\r\nfastened a small ring to the other end to keep the cord from\r\nslipping back by the pull of the weight. I then fastened two\r\npieces of string to the ring at the end of the cord and attached\r\nan iron holder to the end of each string. The strings should be\r\njust long enough to keep the holders just over the stove where\r\nthey are always\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Holders in a Convenient Place]\r\n\r\nready for use, as the weight always draws them back to place.\r\n--Contributed by R. S. Merrill, Syracuse, New York.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Magic-Box Escape [7]\r\n\r\nThe things required to make this trick are a heavy packing box\r\nwith cover, one pair of special hinges, one or two hasps for as\r\nmany padlocks and a small buttonhook, says the Sphinx.\r\n\r\nThe hinges must be the kind for attaching inside of the box. If\r\nordinary butts are used, the cover of the box\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Box with Hinges and Lock]\r\n\r\nmust be cut as much short as the thickness of the end board. The\r\nhinges should have pins that will slip easily through the parts.\r\n\r\nBefore entering the box the performer conceals the buttonhook on\r\nhis person, and as soon as the cover is closed and locked, and the\r\nbox placed in a cabinet or behind a screen, he pushes the pin or\r\nbolt of the hinge out far enough to engage the knob end with the\r\nbuttonhook which is used to pull the pin from the hinge. Both\r\nhinges are treated in this manner and the cover pushed up,\r\nallowing the performer to get out and unlock the padlocks with a\r\nduplicate key. The bolts are replaced in the hinges, the box\r\nlocked and the performer steps out in view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Flour Sifter [7]\r\n\r\nWhen sifting flour in an ordinary sieve I hasten the process and\r\navoid the disagreeable necessity of keeping my hands in the flour\r\nby taking the top from a small tin lard can and placing it on top\r\nof the flour with its sharp edges down. When the sieve is shaken,\r\nthe can top will round up the flour and press it through quickly.\r\n--Contributed by L. Alberta Norrell, Augusta, Ga.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Funnel [7]\r\n\r\nAn automobile horn with the bulb and reed detached makes a good\r\nfunnel. It must be thoroughly cleaned and dried after using as a\r\nfunnel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make Comer Pieces for a Blotter Pad [8]\r\n\r\nTo protect the corners of blotting pads such as will be found on\r\nalmost every writing desk, proceed as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst, make a design of a size proportionate to the size of the\r\npad and make a right-angled triangle, as shown in Fig. 1, on\r\ndrawing paper. Leave a small margin all around the edge and then\r\nplace some decorative form therein. Make allowance for flaps on\r\ntwo sides, as shown, which may later be turned back and folded\r\nunder when the metal is worked. It should be noted that the\r\ncorners of the design are to be clipped slightly. Also note the\r\nslight overrun at the top with the resulting V-shaped indentation.\r\n\r\nTo make a design similar to the one shown, draw one-half of it,\r\nthen fold along the center line and rub the back of the paper with\r\na knife handle or some other hard, smooth surface, and the other\r\nhalf of the design will be traced on the second side. With the\r\nmetal shears, cut out four pieces of copper or brass of No. 22\r\ngauge and with carbon paper trace the shape and decorative design\r\non the metal. Then cut out the outline and file the edges smooth.\r\n\r\nCover the metal over with two coats of black asphaltum varnish,\r\nallowing each coat time to dry. Cover the back and all the face\r\nexcept the white background. Immerse in a solution of 3 parts\r\nwater, 1 part nitric acid and 1 part sulphuric acid. When the\r\nmetal has been etched to the desired depth, about 1-32 of an inch,\r\nremove it and clean off the asphaltum with turpentine. Use a stick\r\nwith a rag tied on the end for this purpose so as to keep the\r\nsolution off the hands and clothes. The four pieces should be\r\nworked at the same time, one for each corner.\r\n\r\nIt remains to bend the flaps. Place the piece in a vise, as shown\r\nin Fig. 2, and bend the flap sharply to a right angle. Next place\r\na piece of metal of a thickness equal to that of the blotter pad\r\nat the bend and with the mallet bring the flap down parallel to\r\nthe face of the corner piece, Fig. 3. If the measuring has been\r\ndone properly, the flaps\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Manner of Forming the Plates]\r\n\r\nought to meet snugly at the corner. If they do not, it may be\r\nnecessary to bend them back and either remove some metal with the\r\nshears or to work the metal over farther. All the edges should be\r\nleft smooth, a metal file and emery paper being used for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nIf a touch of color is desired, it may be had by filling the\r\netched parts with enamel tinted by the addition of oil colors,\r\nsuch as are used for enameling bathtubs. After this has dried,\r\nsmooth it off with pumice stone and water. To keep the metal from\r\ntarnishing, cover it with banana-oil lacquer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Boring Holes in Cork [8]\r\n\r\nThe following hints will be found useful when boring holes in\r\ncork. In boring through rubber corks, a little household ammonia\r\napplied to the bit enables one to make a much smoother hole and\r\none that is nearly the same size at both openings. The common\r\ncork, if rolled under the shoe sole, can be punctured easily and a\r\nhole can be bored straighter. The boring is made easier by boiling\r\nthe cork, and this operation insures a hole that will he the\r\ndesired size and remain the size of the punch or bit used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Self-Lighting Arc Searchlight [9]\r\n\r\nA practical and easily constructed self-lighting arc searchlight\r\ncan be made in the following manner: Procure a large can, about 6\r\nin. in diameter, and cut three holes in its side about 2 in. from\r\nthe back end, and in the positions shown in the sketch. Two of the\r\nholes are cut large enough to hold a short section of a garden\r\nhose tightly, as shown at AA. A piece of porcelain tube, B, used\r\nfor insulation, is fitted tightly in the third hole. The hose\r\ninsulation A should hold the carbon F rigidly, while the carbon E\r\nshould rest loosely in its insulation.\r\n\r\nThe inner end of the carbon E is supported by a piece of No. 25\r\nGerman-silver wire, C, which is about 6 in. long. This wire runs\r\nthrough the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Arc in a Large Can]\r\n\r\nporcelain tube to the binding post D. The binding post is fastened\r\nto a wood plug in the end of the tube. The tube B is adjusted so\r\nthat the end of the carbon E is pressing against the carbon F. The\r\nelectric wires are connected to the carbon F and the binding post\r\nD. A resistance, R, should be in the line.\r\n\r\nThe current, in passing through the lamp, heats the strip of\r\nGerman-silver wire, causing it to expand. This expansion lowers\r\nthe end of the carbon E, separating the points of the two carbons\r\nand thus providing a space between them for the formation of an\r\narc. When the current is turned off, the German-silver wire\r\ncontracts and draws the two carbon ends together ready for\r\nlighting again. The feed can be adjusted by sliding the carbon F\r\nthrough its insulation.\r\n\r\nA resistance for the arc may be made by running the current\r\nthrough a water rheostat or through 15 ft. of No. 25 gauge\r\nGerman-silver wire.\r\n--Contributed by R.

The\r\nstraps are used to attach the snowshoe to the regular shoe. When\r\nbuckling up the straps be sure to leave them loose enough for the\r\nfoot to work freely, Fig. 2. Fasten the barrel staves in pairs,\r\nleaving a space of 4 in. between them as shown in Fig. 3, with\r\nthin strips of wood. Nail the old shoe soles to crosspieces\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Made from Barrel Staves]\r\n\r\nplaced one-third of the way from one end as shown. --Contributed\r\nby David Brown, Kansas City, Mo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Fish Signal for Fishing through Ice [10]\r\n\r\nWatching a fish line set in a hole cut in the ice on a cold day is\r\nvery disagreeable, and the usual method is to\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bell and Battery in a Box]\r\n\r\nhave some kind of a device to signal the fisherman when a fish is\r\nhooked. The "tip ups" and the "jumping jacks" serve their purpose\r\nnicely, but a more elaborate device is the electric signal. A\r\ncomplete electric outfit can be installed in a box and carried as\r\nconveniently as tackle.\r\n\r\nAn ordinary electric bell, A, Fig. 1, having a gong 2-1/2 in. in\r\ndiameter, and a pocket battery, B are mounted on the bottom of the\r\nbox. The electric connection to the bell is plainly shown. Two\r\nstrips of brass, C, are mounted on the outside of the box. The\r\nbrass strips are shaped in such a way as to form a circuit when\r\nthe ends are pulled together. The box is opened and set on the ice\r\nnear the fishing hole. The fish line is hung over a round stick\r\nplaced across the hole and then tied to the inside strip of brass.\r\nWhen the fish is hooked the line will pull the brass points into\r\ncontact and close the electric circuit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Homemade Floor Polisher [10]\r\n\r\nA floor polisher is something that one does not use but two or\r\nthree times a year. Manufactured polishers come in two sizes, one\r\nweighing 15 lb., which is the right weight for family use, and one\r\nweighing 25 lb.\r\n\r\nA polisher can be made at home that will do the work just as well.\r\nProcure a wooden box such as cocoa tins or starch packages are\r\nshipped in and stretch several thicknesses of flannel or carpet\r\nover the bottom, allowing the edges to extend well up the sides,\r\nand tack smoothly. Make a handle of two stout strips of wood, 36\r\nin. long, by joining their upper ends to a shorter crosspiece and\r\nnail it to the box. Place three paving bricks inside of the box,\r\nand the polisher will weigh about 16 lb., just the right weight\r\nfor a woman to use. The polisher is used by rubbing with the grain\r\nof the wood.\r\n--Contributed by Katharine D. Morse, Syracuse, N.

These can be easily\r\nrepaired by inserting in the neck a piece of match, toothpick or\r\nsplinter of wood and tying the hanging string to it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Repaired Decoration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Homemade Scroll Saw [11]\r\n\r\nA scroll saw, if once used, becomes indispensable in any home\r\ncarpenter chest, yet it is safe to say that not one in ten\r\ncontains it. A scroll saw is much more useful than a keyhole saw\r\nfor sawing small and irregular holes, and many fancy knick-knacks,\r\nsuch as brackets, bookracks and shelves can be made with one.\r\n\r\nA simple yet serviceable scroll saw frame can be made from a piece\r\nof cold-rolled steel rod, 3/32 or 1/4 in. in diameter, two 1/8-in.\r\nmachine screws, four washers and four square nuts. The rod should\r\nbe 36 or 38 in. long, bent as shown in Fig. 1. Place one washer on\r\neach screw and put the screws through the eyelets, AA, then place\r\nother washers on and fasten in place by screwing one nut on each\r\nscrew, clamping the washers against the frame as tightly as\r\npossible. The saw, which can be purchased at a local hardware\r\nstore, is fastened between the clamping nut and another nut as\r\nshown in Fig. 2.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Frame Made of a Rod]\r\n\r\nIf two wing nuts having the same number and size of threads are\r\navailable, use them in place of the outside nuts.

Scranton, Detroit, Michigan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Watch Fob [12]\r\n\r\nThe fixtures for the watch fob shown--half size--may be made of\r\neither brass, copper, or silver. Silver is the most desirable but,\r\nof course, the most expensive. The buckle is to be purchased. The\r\nconnection is to be of leather of a color to harmonize with that\r\nof the fixtures. The body of the fob may be of leather of suitable\r\ncolor or of silk. Of the leathers, green and browns are the most\r\npopular, though almost any color may be obtained.\r\n\r\nMake full size drawings of the outline and design of the fixtures.\r\nWith carbon paper trace these on the metal. Pierce the metal of\r\nthe parts that are to be removed with a small hand drill to make a\r\nplace for the leather or silk. With a small metal saw cut out\r\nthese parts and smooth up the edges, rounding them slightly so\r\nthey will not cut the leather or silk. Next cut out the outlines\r\nwith the metal shears. File these edges, rounding and smoothing\r\nwith emery paper. The best way of handling the decorative design\r\nis to etch it and, if copper or brass, treat it with color.\r\n\r\nFor etching, first cover the metal with black asphaltum varnish,\r\non the back and all the parts that are not to be touched with the\r\nacid. In the design shown, the unshaded parts should not be etched\r\nand should, therefore, be covered the same as the back. Apply two\r\ncoats, allowing each time to dry, after which immerse the metal in\r\na solution prepared as follows: 3 parts water, 1 part nitric acid,\r\n1 part sulphuric acid. Allow the metal to remain in this until the\r\nacid has eaten to a depth of 1/32 in., then remove it and clean in\r\na turpentine bath, using a swab and an old stiff brush. The amount\r\nof time required to do the etching will depend upon the strength\r\nof the liquid, as well as the depth of etching desired.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Watch Fob]\r\n\r\nFor coloring silver, as well as brass and copper, cover the metal\r\nwith a solution of the following: 1/2 pt. of water in which\r\ndissolve, after breaking up, five cents worth of sulphureted\r\npotassium. Put a teaspoonful of this into a tin with 2 qt. of\r\nwater. Polish a piece of scrap metal and dip it in the solution.\r\nIf it colors the metal red, it has the correct strength. Drying\r\nwill cause this to change to purple. Rub off the highlights,\r\nleaving them the natural color of the metal and apply a coat of\r\nbanana-oil lacquer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** An Austrian Top [12]\r\n\r\nAll parts of the top are of wood and they are simple to make. The\r\nhandle is a piece of pine, 5-1/4 in. long, 1-1/4 in. wide and 3/4\r\nin. thick. A handle, 3/4 in. in diameter, is formed on one end,\r\nallowing only 1-1/4 in. of the other end to remain rectangular in\r\nshape. Bore a 3/4-in. hole in this end for the top. A 1/16-in.\r\nhole is bored in the edge to enter the large hole as shown. The\r\ntop can be cut from a broom handle or a round stick of hardwood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Parts of the Top]\r\n\r\nTo spin the top, take a piece of stout cord about 2 ft. long, pass\r\none end through the 1/16-in. hole and wind it on the small part of\r\nthe top in the usual way, starting at the bottom and winding\r\nupward. When the shank is covered, set the top in the 3/4-in.\r\nhole. Take hold of the handle with the left hand and the end of\r\nthe cord with the right hand, give a good quick pull on the cord\r\nand the top will jump clear of the handle and spin vigorously.\r\n--Contributed by J.F.

The dimensions may be varied to admit any number or size\r\nof spools. Each pocket is made to take a certain size spool, the\r\nend of the thread being run through the cloth front for obtaining\r\nthe length for threading a needle.

For black leathers, some lampblack may be added and\r\nthe mixture applied in the same way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Baking Pan [13]\r\n\r\nWhen making cookies, tarts or similar pastry, the housewife often\r\nwishes for something by which to lift the baked articles from the\r\npan. The baking tray or pan shown in the sketch not only protects\r\nthe hands from burns but allows the baked articles easily to slip\r\nfrom its surface. The pan is made from a piece of sheet iron\r\nslightly larger than the baking space desired. Each end of the\r\nmetal is cut so that a part may be turned up and into a roll to\r\nmake handles for the pan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Baking Pan without Sides]\r\n\r\nA wire or small rod is placed between the handles as shown. This\r\nwire is fastened at each end and a loop made in the center. The\r\npan can be removed from the oven by placing a stick through the\r\nloop and lifting it out without placing the hands inside the hot\r\noven. The baking surface, having no sides, permits the baked\r\narticles to be slid off at each side with a knife or fork. --A.

Line the\r\ninside of the jar with two thicknesses of good orange post office\r\npaper. The best lamp for the purpose is an 8-candlepower showcase\r\nlamp, the same as shown in the illustration. Screw the lamp into\r\nthe socket and screw the cover onto the jar, and you have a safe\r\nlight of excellent illuminating power.\r\n\r\nWhen you desire to work by white light, two turns will remove the\r\njar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Darkroom Lantern]\r\n\r\nIf developing papers are being worked, obtain a second jar and\r\nline with light orange paper, screw into the cover fastened to the\r\nlamp and you have a safe and pleasant light for loading and\r\ndevelopment. By attaching sufficient cord to the lamp, it can be\r\nmoved to any part of the darkroom, and you have three lamps at a\r\ntrifling cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Preventing Vegetables from Burning in a Pot [14]\r\n\r\nMany housekeepers do not know that there is a simple way to\r\nprevent potatoes from burning and sticking to the bottom of the\r\npot. An inverted pie pan placed in the bottom of the pot avoids\r\nscorching potatoes. The water and empty space beneath the pan\r\nsaves the potatoes. This also makes the work of cleaning pots\r\neasier as no adhering parts of potatoes are left to be scoured\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Clothes Rack [14]\r\n\r\nA clothes-drying rack that has many good features can be made as\r\nshown in the illustration.

The\r\nback porch was enclosed with sheeting for the room, and the\r\napparatus consisted of a galvanized-iron pail with a short nipple\r\nsoldered in the center of the bottom and fitted with a valve and\r\nsprinkler. The whole, after filling the pail with water, was\r\nraised above one\'s head with a rope run over a pulley fastened to\r\nthe roof of the porch, and a tub was used on the floor to catch\r\nthe water. A knot should be tied in the rope at the right place,\r\nto keep it from running out of the pulley while the pail is\r\nlowered to be filled with water, and a loop made in the end, which\r\nis placed over a screw hook turned into the wall. If the loop is\r\ntied at the proper place, the pail will be raised to the right\r\nheight for the person taking the shower bath.\r\n\r\nThe water will run from 10 to 15 minutes.

If the gate is\r\nraised slightly, it will permit a continuous flow of liquid of the\r\ndesired amount.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Saving Overexposed Developing Prints [16]\r\n\r\nIn using developing papers, either for contact printing or\r\nenlargements, you are, by all rules of the game, entitled to a\r\ncertain number of overexposed prints, says a correspondent of\r\nCamera Craft. But there is no reason why you should lose either\r\nthe paper or the time and trouble expended in making these prints.\r\nBy using the following method, you can turn these very dark prints\r\ninto good ones.\r\n\r\nFirst: these overexposed prints must be fully developed. Do not\r\ntry to save them by rushing them out of the developer into the\r\nshort-stop or fixing bath. The results will be poor, and, if you\r\ntry to tone them afterward, the color will be an undesirable,\r\nsickly one. Develop them into strong prints, thoroughly fix, and\r\nwash until you are sure all hypo is removed. In my own practice, I\r\ncarry out this part of the work thoroughly, then dry the prints\r\nand lay aside these dark ones until there is an accumulation of a\r\ndozen or more, doing this to avoid too frequent use of the very\r\npoisonous bleaching solution. The bleacher is made up as follows\r\nand should be plainly marked "Poison."\r\n\r\n    Cyanide of potassium ....... 2 oz.\r\n    Iodide of potassium ....... 20 gr.\r\n    Water ..................... 16 oz.\r\n\r\nPlace the dry print, without previous wetting, in this solution.\r\nIt will bleach slowly and evenly, but, when it starts to bleach,\r\ntransfer it to a tray of water, where it will continue to bleach.\r\nWhen the desired reduction has taken place, stop the action at\r\nonce by immersing the print in a 10-per-cent solution of borax.\r\nThe prints may be allowed to remain in this last solution until\r\nthey are finished. A good final washing completes the process.\r\nThis washing must be thorough and a sponge or a tuft of cotton\r\nused to clean the surface of the print.\r\n\r\nWith a little practice, this method of saving prints that are too\r\ndark becomes easy and certain. The prints are lightened and at the\r\nsame time improved in tone, being made blue-black with a delicate\r\nand pleasing quality that will tempt you to purposely overexpose\r\nsome of your prints in order to tone them by this method for\r\ncertain effects. The process is particularly valuable to the\r\nworker in large sizes, as it provides a means of making quite a\r\nsaving of paper that would otherwise be thrown away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** An Ironing-Board Stand [17]\r\n\r\nAn ordinary ironing board is cut square on the large end and a\r\nslot cut 1-1/2 in. wide and 4 in. long to admit the angle support.\r\nThe support is placed against the table and the board\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Stand Attached to Table]\r\n\r\nis pressed down against the outer notch which jams against the\r\ntable, thus holding the board rigid and in such a position as to\r\ngive free access for ironing dresses, etc.\r\n--Contributed by T.

The teeth of the saw should\r\nbe so placed that the sawing will be done on the downward stroke.\r\nThe metal must be held firmly, and the saw allowed time to make\r\nits cut, being held perpendicular to the work.\r\n\r\nAfter the sawing, smooth the edges of the metal with a small file\r\nand emery paper. The metal clip may be bent outward to do this\r\npart of the work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Cheesebox-Cover Tea Tray [18]\r\n\r\nThe cover from a cheesebox can be converted into a tea tray that\r\nis very dainty for the piazza, or for serving an invalid\'s\r\nbreakfast.\r\n\r\nFirst sandpaper the wood until it is smooth, then stain it a\r\nmahogany color. The mahogany stain can be obtained ready prepared.\r\nAfter the stain has dried, attach brass handles, which can be\r\nobtained for a small sum at an upholsterer\'s shop.

Tack over one end of the hole a piece of pasteboard in\r\nwhich seven coarse sewing-machine needles have been inserted. The\r\nneedles should be close together and pushed through the pasteboard\r\nuntil the points show. The hole is then filled with melted babbitt\r\nmetal. When this is cold, the block is split and the pasteboard\r\nremoved. This tool makes neat pierced work and in making brass\r\nshades, it does the work rapidly.\r\n--Contributed by H.

The stick should be dressed to fit the hole\r\nin the spool snugly and a small brad driven through one end so\r\nthat the point will protrude about 1/16 in.\r\n\r\nThe adjustment of the gauge is secured by driving the stick in the\r\nhole in the direction desired. A better way and one that will make\r\nthe adjusting easy is to file the point end of a screw eye flat\r\nand use it as a set screw through a hole in the side of the spool.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Flatiron Rest [19]\r\n\r\nThe iron rest and wall hanger shown in the sketch is made of sheet\r\niron.

WARNECKE\r\n\r\nProcure some brass, about 3/16 in. thick and 4 in. square; 53\r\nsteel pens, not over 1/4 in. in width at the shank; two enameled,\r\nor tin, saucers or pans, having a diameter on the inside part of\r\nabout 4-1/2 in.; two stopcocks with 1/8 in. holes; one shaft; some\r\npieces of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Details of Turbine]\r\n\r\nbrass, 1/4 in. thick, and several 1/8-in. machine screws.\r\n\r\nLay out two circles on the 3/16-in. brass, one having a diameter\r\nof 3-1/2 in. and the other with a diameter of 2-3/4 in. The\r\noutside circle is the size of the finished brass wheel, while the\r\ninside circle indicates the depth to which the slots are to be\r\ncut. Mark the point where a hole is to be drilled for the shaft,\r\nalso locate the drill holes, as shown at A, Fig. 1. After the\r\nshaft hole and the holes A are drilled in the disk, it can be used\r\nas template for drilling the side plates C.\r\n\r\nThe rim of the disk is divided into 53 equal parts and radial\r\nlines drawn from rim to line B, indicating the depth of the slots.\r\nSlots are cut in the disk with a hacksaw on the radial lines. A\r\nsmall vise is convenient for holding the disk while cutting the\r\nslots.\r\n\r\nWhen cutting the disk out of the rough brass, sufficient margin\r\nshould be left for filing to the true line. The slots should be\r\nleft in their rough state as they have a better hold on the pens\r\nwhich are used for the blades. The pens are inserted in the slots\r\nand made quite secure by forcing ordinary pins on the inside of\r\nthe pens and breaking them off at the rim, as shown in Fig. 4.\r\n\r\nWhen the pens are all fastened two pieces of metal are provided,\r\neach about 1 in. in diameter and 1/32 in. thick, with a 3/8-in.\r\nhole in the center, for filling pieces which are first placed\r\naround the shaft hole between the disk and side plates C, Fig. 1.\r\nThe side plates are then secured with some of the 1/8-in. machine\r\nscrews, using two nuts on each screw. The nuts should be on the\r\nside opposite the inlet valves. The shaft hole may also be filed\r\nsquare, a square shaft used, and the ends filed round for the\r\nbearings.\r\n\r\nThe casing for the disk is made of two enameled-iron saucers, Fig.\r\n2, bolted together with a thin piece of asbestos between them to\r\nmake a tight joint. A 3/4-in. hole is cut near the edge of one of\r\nthe saucers for the exhaust. If it is desired to carry the exhaust\r\nbeyond the casing, a thin pipe can be inserted 1/4 in. into the\r\nhole. Holes are drilled through the pipe on both inside and\r\noutside of the casing, and pins inserted, as shown in Fig. 5.\r\nSolder is run around the outside pin to keep the steam from\r\nescaping. At the lowest point of the saucer or casing a 1/8-in.\r\nhole is drilled to run off the water. A wood plug will answer for\r\na stopcock.\r\n\r\nIf metal dishes, shaped from thick material with a good coating of\r\ntin, can be procured, it will be much easier to construct the\r\ncasing than if enameled ware is used. The holes can be easily\r\ndrilled and the parts fitted together closely. All seams and\r\nsurfaces around fittings can be soldered.\r\n\r\nNozzles are made of two stopcocks having a 1/8-in. hole. These are\r\nconnected to a 3/8-in. supply pipe. The nozzles should be set at\r\nan angle of 20 deg. with the face of the disk. The nozzle or\r\nstopcock will give better results if the discharge end is filed\r\nparallel to the face of the disk when at an angle of 20 deg. There\r\nshould be a space of 1/16 in. between the nozzle and the blades to\r\nallow for sufficient play, Fig. 3.\r\n\r\nThe bearings are made of 1/4-in. brass and bolted to the casing,\r\nas shown, with 1/8-in. machine screws and nuts. Two nuts should be\r\nplaced on each screw. The pulley is made by sliding a piece of\r\nsteel pipe on the engine shaft and fastening it with machine\r\nscrews and nuts as shown in Fig. 6. If the shaft is square, lead\r\nshould be run into the segments.\r\n\r\nThe driven shaft should have a long bearing. The pulley on this\r\nshaft is made of pieces of wood nailed together, and its\r\ncircumference cut out with a scroll saw. Flanges are screwed to\r\nthe pulley and fastened to the shaft as shown in Fig. 7.\r\n\r\nThe bearings are made of oak blocks lined with heavy tin or sheet\r\niron for the running surface. Motion is transmitted from the\r\nengine to the large pulley by a thin but very good leather belt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Homemade Telegraph Key [21]\r\n\r\nA simple and easily constructed telegraph key may be made in the\r\nfollowing manner: Procure a piece of sheet brass, about 1/32 in.\r\nthick, and cut out a strip 3-1/2 in. long by 3/4 in. wide. Bend as\r\nshown in Fig. 1 and drill a hole for the knob in one end and a\r\nhole for a screw in the other. Procure a small wood knob and\r\nfasten it in place with a small screw. Cut a strip of the same\r\nbrass 2-3/4 in. long and 5/16 in. wide and bend as shown in Fig.\r\n2. Drill two holes in the feet for screws to fasten it to the\r\nbase, and one hole in the top part for a machine screw, and solder\r\na small nut on the under side of the metal over the hole.\r\n\r\nMount both pieces on a base 4-1/4 by 2-3/4 by 1/4 in., as in Fig.\r\n3, and where\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Brass Key on a Wood Base]\r\n\r\nthe screw of the knob strikes the base when pressed down, put in a\r\nscrew or brass-headed tack for a contact. Fasten the parts down\r\nwith small brass wood-screws and solder the connections beneath\r\nthe base. Binding posts from an old battery cell are used on the\r\nend of the base. The screw on top of the arch is used to adjust\r\nthe key for a long or short stroke.\r\n--Contributed by S. V.

A barrel is sunk in the\r\nground in a shady place, allowing plenty of space about the\r\noutside to fill in with gravel. A quantity of small stones and\r\nsand is first put in wet. A box is placed in the hole over the top\r\nof the barrel and filled in with clay or earth well tamped. The\r\nporous condition of the gravel drains the surplus water after a\r\nrain.\r\n\r\nThe end of the barrel is fitted with a light cover and a heavy\r\ndoor hinged to the box. A small portion of damp sand is sprinkled\r\non the bottom of the barrel. The covers should be left open\r\noccasionally to prevent mold and to remove any bad air that may\r\nhave collected from the contents.\r\n--Contributed by F. Smith, La Salle, Ill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Homemade Work Basket [22]\r\n\r\nSecure a cheese box about 12 in. high and 15 in. or more in\r\ndiameter. It will pay you to be careful in selecting this box. Be\r\nsure to have the cover. Score the wood deeply with a carpenter\'s\r\ngauge inside and out 3-1/2 in. from the top of the box. With\r\nrepeated scoring the wood will be almost cut through or in shape\r\nto finish the cut with a knife. Now you will have the box in two\r\npieces. The lower part, 8-1/2 in. deep over all, we will call the\r\nbasket, and the smaller part will be known as the tray.\r\n\r\nRemove the band from the cover and cut the boards to fit in the\r\ntray flush with the lower edge, to make the bottom. Fasten with\r\n3/4-in brads. The kind of wood used in making these boxes cracks\r\neasily and leaves a rough surface which should be well\r\nsandpapered.\r\n\r\nThe four legs are each 3/4-in. square and 30-1/2 in. long. The\r\ntops should be beveled to keep them from splintering at the edges.\r\nWith a string or tape measure, find the circumference of the tray\r\nor basket and divide this into four equal parts, arranging the lap\r\nseam on both to come midway between two of the marks. When\r\nassembling, make these seams come between the two back legs.\r\n\r\nThe tray is placed 1-1/4 in. from the top end and the basket 6-3/4\r\nin. from the bottom end of the legs. Notch the legs at the lower\r\npoint about 1/8 in. deep and 1-1/4 in. wide to receive the band at\r\nthe lower end of the basket. Fasten with 3/4-in. screws, using\r\nfour to each leg, three of which are in the basket. Insert the\r\nscrews from the inside of the box into the legs.\r\n\r\nStain the wood before putting in the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Work Basket]\r\n\r\nlining. If all the parts are well sandpapered, the wood will take\r\nthe stain nicely: Three yards of cretonne will make a very\r\nattractive lining. Cut two sheets of cardboard to fit in the\r\nbottom of the tray and basket. Cover them with the cretonne,\r\nsewing on the back side. Cut four strips for the sides from the\r\nwidth of the goods 5-1/2 in. wide and four strips 10 in. wide. Sew\r\nthem end to end and turn down one edge to a depth of 1 in. and\r\ngather it at that point, also the lower edge when necessary. Sew\r\non to the covered cardboards. Fasten them to the sides of the tray\r\nand basket with the smallest upholsterers\' tacks. The product of\r\nyour labor will be a very neat and useful piece of furniture.\r\n--Contributed by Stanley H.

These boards are tongued and grooved and when put together\r\neffectually prevent the entrance of light.\r\n\r\nThe next important thing to be considered is to make it\r\nweather-tight, and as far as the sides are concerned the matched\r\nboards will do this also, but it is necessary to cover the roof\r\nwith felt or water-proof paper.\r\n\r\nThe best thickness for the boards is 1 in., but for cheapness 3/4\r\nin. will do as well, yet the saving is so little that the 1-in.\r\nboards are preferable.\r\n\r\nThe dark room shown in the accompanying sketch measures 3 ft. 6\r\nin. by 2 ft. 6 in., the height to the eaves being 6 ft. Form the\r\ntwo sides shown in Fig 1, fixing the crosspieces which hold the\r\nboards together in such positions that the bottom one will act as\r\na bearer for the floor, and the second one for the developing\r\nbench. Both sides can be put together in this way, and both\r\nexactly alike. Keep the ends of the crosspieces back from the\r\nedges of the boards far enough to allow the end boards to fit in\r\nagainst them.\r\n\r\nOne of the narrow sides can be formed in the same way, fixing the\r\ncrosspieces on to correspond, and then these three pieces can be\r\nfastened together by screwing the two wide sides on the narrow\r\none.\r\n\r\nLay the floor next, screwing or nailing the boards to the\r\ncrosspieces, and making the last board come even with the ends of\r\nthe crosspieces, not even with the boards themselves. The single\r\nboards can then be fixed, one on each side of what will be the\r\ndoorway, by screwing to the floor, and to the outside board of the\r\nsides. At the top of the doorway, fix a narrow piece between the\r\nside boards, thus leaving a rectangular opening for the door.\r\n\r\nThe roof boards may next be put on, nailing them to each other at\r\nthe ridge, and to the sides of the room at the outsides and eaves.\r\nThey should overhang at the sides and eaves about 2 in., as shown\r\nin Figs. 3 and 4.\r\n\r\nOne of the sides with the crosspieces in place will be as shown in\r\nFig. 2 in section, all the crosspieces and bearers intersecting\r\naround the room.\r\n\r\nThe door is made of the same kind of boards held together with\r\ncrosspieces, one of which is fastened so as to fit closely to the\r\nfloor when the door is hinged, and act as a trap for the light.\r\nThe top crosspiece is also fastened within 1 in. of the top of the\r\ndoor for the same reason.\r\n\r\nLight traps are necessary at the sides and top of the door. That\r\nat the hinged side can be as shown at A, Fig. 5, the closing side\r\nas at B, and the top as at C in the same drawing. These are all in\r\nsection and are self-explanatory. In hinging the door, three butt\r\nhinges should be used so as to keep the joint close.\r\n\r\nThe fittings of the room are as shown sectionally in Fig. 6, but\r\nbefore fixing these it is best to line the room with heavy, brown\r\nwrapping paper, as an additional safeguard against the entrance of\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nThe developing bench is 18 in. wide, and in the middle an opening,\r\n9 by 11 in., is cut, below which is fixed the sink. It is shown in\r\ndetail in Fig. 7, and should be zinc lined.\r\n\r\nThe zinc should not be cut but folded as shown in Fig. 8, so that\r\nit will fit inside the sink. The bench at each side of the sink\r\nshould be fluted (Fig. 9), so that the water will drain off into\r\nthe sink. A strip should be fixed along the back of the bench as\r\nshown in Figs. 6 and 9, and an arrangement of slats (Fig. 10),\r\nhinged to it, so as to drop on the sink as in Fig. 6, and shown to\r\na larger scale in Fig. 11.\r\n\r\nA shelf for bottles and another for plates, etc., can be fixed\r\nabove the developing bench as at D and E (Fig. 6) and another as F\r\nin the same drawing. This latter forms the bottom of the tray\r\nrack, which is fixed on as shown\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Details of the Dark Rook]\r\n\r\nin Fig. 13. The divisions of the tray rack are best fitted loosely\r\nin grooves formed by fixing strips to the shelves and under the\r\nbench and sink as in Fig. 13.\r\n\r\nExtra bearing pieces will be wanted for the shelves mentioned\r\nabove, these being shown in Fig. 14. The window is formed by\r\ncutting an opening in the side opposite the door, and fixing in it\r\na square of white glass with strips of wood on the inside and\r\nputty on the outside, as in Fig. 15. A ruby glass is framed as\r\nshown at G, Fig. 16, and arranged to slide to and fro in the\r\ngrooved runners H, which makes it possible to have white light, as\r\nat I, or red light as at K, Fig. 16. The white glass with runners\r\nin position is shown at L in the same drawing, but not the red\r\nglass and frame. Ventilation is arranged for by boring a series of\r\nholes near the floor, as at M, Fig. 6, and near the roof as at N\r\nin the same drawing, and trapping the light without stopping the\r\npassage of air, as shown in the sections, Fig. 17.\r\n\r\nThe finish of the roof at the gables is shown in Fig. 18, the\r\nstrip under the boards holding the felt in position when folded\r\nunder, and the same is true of the roll at the top of the roof in\r\nFig. 19.\r\n\r\nThe house will be much strengthened if strips, as shown in Fig.\r\n20, are fastened in the corners inside, after lining with brown\r\npaper, screwing them each way into the boards. The door may have a\r\nlatch or lock with a knob, but should in addition have two buttons\r\non the inside, fixed so as to pull it shut tightly at top and\r\nbottom. A waste pipe should be attached to the sink and arranged\r\nto discharge through the floor. A cistern with pipe and tap can be\r\nfastened in the top of the dark room, if desired, or the room may\r\nbe made with a flat roof, and a tank stand on it, though this is\r\nhardly advisable.\r\n\r\nIt is absolutely necessary that the room be well painted, four\r\ncoats at first is not too many, and one coat twice a year will\r\nkeep it in good condition.\r\n\r\nA brick foundation should be laid so that no part of the room\r\ntouches the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** The Versatile Querl [28]\r\n\r\n"Querl" is the German name for a kitchen utensil which may be used\r\nas an egg-beater, potato-masher or a lemon-squeezer. For beating\r\nup an egg in a glass, mixing flour and water, or stirring cocoa or\r\nchocolate, it is better than anything on the market.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Querl Made of Wood]\r\n\r\nThis utensil is made of hardwood,  preferably maple or ash. A\r\ncircular piece about 2 in. in diameter is cut from 1/2-in. stock\r\nand shaped like a star as shown in Fig. 1, and a 3/8-in. hole\r\nbored in the center for a handle. The handle should be at least 12\r\nin. in length and fastened in the star as shown in Fig. 2.\r\n\r\nIn use, the star is placed in the dish containing the material to\r\nbe beaten or mixed and the handle is rapidly rolled between the\r\npalms of the hands.\r\n--Contributed by W.

A convenient desk accessory for this\r\npurpose can be made of a short\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Collar Button Ends In Wood Stick]\r\n\r\npiece of hardwood and two bone collar buttons.\r\n\r\nFile off the head of one button at A and the base from another at\r\nB.

These supports should not be\r\nmade of any hard material nor should they be good conductors of\r\nheat, as such qualities would result in frequent breakage.\r\n\r\nA French magazine suggests making the supports from the large\r\ncorks of glass jars in which crystal chemicals are usually\r\nsupplied from the dealers. The manner of making them is clearly\r\nshown in the sketch. Each cork is cut as in Fig. 1 and placed on a\r\nwire ring (Fig. 2) whose ends are twisted together and the last\r\nsection of cork is cut through from the inner side to the center\r\nand thus fitted over the wire covering the twisted ends, which\r\nbinds them together. The corks in use are shown in Fig. 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Rustic Window Boxes [30]\r\n\r\nInstead of using an ordinary green-painted window box, why not\r\nmake an artistic one in which the color does not clash with the\r\nplants contained in it but rather harmonizes with them.\r\n\r\nSuch a window box can be made by anyone having usual mechanical\r\nability, and will furnish more opportunities for artistic and\r\noriginal design than many other articles of more complicated\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\nThe box proper should be made a little shorter than the length of\r\nthe window to allow for the extra space taken up in trimming and\r\nshould be nearly equal in width to the sill, as shown in Fig. 1.\r\nIf the sill is inclined, as is usually the case, the box will\r\nrequire a greater height in front, to make it set level, as shown\r\nin Fig. 2.\r\n\r\nThe box should be well nailed or screwed together and should then\r\nbe painted all over to make it more durable. A number of 1/2-in.\r\nholes should be drilled in the bottom, to allow the excess water\r\nto run out and thus prevent rotting of the plants and box.\r\n\r\nHaving completed the bare box, it may be trimmed to suit the fancy\r\nof the maker. The design shown in Fig. 1 is very simple and easy\r\nto construct, but may be replaced with a panel or other design.\r\nOne form of panel design is shown in Fig. 3.\r\n\r\nTrimming having too rough a surface will be found unsuitable for\r\nthis work as it is difficult to fasten and cannot be split as well\r\nas smooth trimming. It should be cut the proper length before\r\nbeing split and should be fastened with brads. The half-round\r\nhoops of barrels will be found very useful in trimming, especially\r\nfor filling-in purposes, and by using them the operation of\r\nsplitting is avoided. After the box is trimmed, the rustic work\r\nshould be varnished, in order to thoroughly preserve it, as well\r\nas improve its appearance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Artistic Flower Boxes]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Antidote for Squirrel Pest [30]\r\n\r\nTo the owner of a garden in a town where squirrels are protected\r\nby law, life in the summer time is a vexation. First the squirrels\r\ndig up the sweet corn and two or three replantings are necessary.\r\nWhen the corn is within two or three days of being suitable for\r\ncooking, the squirrels come in droves from far and near. They eat\r\nall they can and carry away the rest. When the corn is gone\r\ncucumbers, cabbages, etc., share the same fate, being partly eaten\r\ninto. At the risk of being arrested for killing the squirrels I\r\nhave used a small target rifle morning and night, but during my\r\nabsence the devastation went on steadily. Last year they destroyed\r\nmy entire corn crop. Traps do no good; can\'t use poison, too\r\ndangerous. But I have solved the difficulty; it\'s easy.\r\n\r\nShake cayenne pepper over the various vegetables which are being\r\nruin, and observe results.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Homemade Electric Stove [31]\r\nBy J. F. THOLL\r\n\r\nThe construction of an electric stove is very simple, and it can\r\nbe made by any home mechanic having a vise and hand drill. The\r\nbody is made of sheet or galvanized iron, cut out and drilled as\r\nshown in Fig. 1.\r\n\r\nEach long projection represents a leg, which is bent at right\r\nangles on the center line by placing the metal in the jaws of a\r\nvise and hammering the metal over flat. If just the rim is gripped\r\nin the vise, it will give a rounding form to the lower part of the\r\nlegs. The small projections are bent in to form a support for the\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\nThe bottom consists of a square piece of metal, as shown in Fig.\r\n2. Holes are drilled near the edges for stove bolts to fasten it\r\nto the bottom projections. Two of the larger holes are used for\r\nthe ends of the coiled rod and the other two for the heating-wire\r\nterminals. The latter holes should be well insulated with\r\nporcelain or mica. The top consists of a square piece of metal\r\ndrilled as shown in Fig. 3. Four small ears are turned down to\r\nhold the top in place.\r\n\r\nOne end of the coiled rod is shown in Fig. 4. This illustrates how\r\ntwo pins are inserted in holes, drilled at right angles, to hold\r\nthe coil on the bottom plate. The coiled rod is 3/16 in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pattern for Parts of the Electric Stove]\r\n\r\nin diameter and 27 in. long. The rod is wrapped with sheet\r\nasbestos, cut in 1/2-in. strips.\r\n\r\nThe length of the heating wire must be determined by a test. This\r\nwire can be purchased from electrical stores. Stovepipe wire will\r\nanswer the purpose when regular heating wire cannot be obtained.\r\nThe wire is coiled around the asbestos-covered rod, so that no\r\ncoil will be in contact with another coil. If, by trial, the coil\r\ndoes not heat sufficiently, cut some of it off and try again.\r\nAbout 9-1/2 ft. of No. 26 gauge heating wire will be about right.\r\nThe connection to an electric-lamp socket is made with ordinary\r\nflexible cord, to which is attached a screw plug for making\r\nconnections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Glass-Cleaning Solution [31]\r\n\r\nGlass tumblers, tubing and fancy bottles are hard to clean by\r\nwashing them in the ordinary way, as the parts are hard to reach\r\nwith the fingers or a brush. The following solution makes an\r\nexcellent cleaner that will remove dirt and grease from crevices\r\nand sharp corners. To 9 parts of water add 1 part of strong\r\nsulphuric acid. The acid should be added to the water slowly and\r\nnot the water to the acid. Add as much bichromate of potash as the\r\nsolution will dissolve. More bichromate of potash should be added\r\nas the precipitate is used in cleaning.\r\n\r\nThe chemicals can be purchased cheaply from a local drug store,\r\nand made up and kept in large bottles. The solution can be used\r\nover and over again. -- Contributed by Loren Ward Des Moines,\r\nIowa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Automatic-Closing Kennel Door [32]\r\n\r\nWhen the neighborhood cats are retired for the night and there is\r\nnothing more to chase, my fox terrier seems to realize that his\r\nusefulness\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram of Closing Door]\r\n\r\nfor the day is over and begs to be put in his kennel that he may\r\nnot bark at the moon as some dogs are apt to do. This necessitates\r\nmy putting him out at a time when it may not be convenient.\r\nFrequently in stormy weather this is a disagreeable duty and I\r\nfound a way to obviate it by making a trapdoor device for his\r\nkennel as shown in the sketch whereby he may lock himself in when\r\nhe crosses the threshold.\r\n\r\nThe outer half A of the hinged trapdoor is made heavier than the\r\ninner half B by a cleat, C, and a strip, D, to cause the door to\r\nswing shut. The tripper stick E is set between cleats C and F to\r\nhold the door open. When the dog steps on the inner half of the\r\ntrapdoor B, it falls to stop G, releasing tripper stick E (which\r\nis heavier on the top end H) to cause it to fall clear of the path\r\nof the trapdoor. The door then swings shut in the direction of the\r\narrow, the latch I engaging a slot in the door as it closes, and\r\nthe dog has locked himself in for the night. The latch I is made\r\nof an old-fashioned gate latch which is mortised in the bottom\r\njoist of the kennel. When releasing the dog in the morning the\r\ndoor is set for the evening.\r\n--Contributed by Victor Labadie, Dallas, Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Polishing Cloths for Silver [32]\r\n\r\nMix 2 lb. of whiting and 1/2 oz. of oleic acid with 1 gal. of\r\ngasoline.

If a stove bolt is inserted\r\nlengthwise through the cork with a washer on each end and the nut\r\nscrewed up tightly, as shown in the sketch, the cork may be made\r\nto last longer than the supply of mucilage and can be placed in a\r\nnew bottle and used over and over again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cork Clamp]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Withdrawing Paper from under an Inverted Bottle [33]\r\n\r\nInvert a bottle on a piece of paper near the edge of a table top\r\nand ask anyone to remove the paper without overturning the bottle.\r\nThey will at once jerk the paper with the result that the bottle\r\nwill turn over.

Sprout, Harrisburg, Pa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Flower-pot Stand]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Line Harmonograph  [34]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Harmonograph]\r\n\r\nAs an apparatus capable of exciting interest, probably nothing so\r\neasily constructed surpasses the harmonograph. Your attention will\r\nbe completely absorbed in the ever changing, graceful sweep of the\r\nlong pendulum, the gyrations of which are faithfully recorded in\r\nthe resulting harmonogram.\r\n\r\nA careless impetus given to the pendulum may result in a very\r\nbeautiful harmonogram, but you may try innumerable times to\r\nduplicate this chance record without success. No two hamonograms\r\nare exactly alike. The harmonograph, while its pendulum swings in\r\naccordance with well known natural laws, is exceedingly erratic\r\nwhen it comes to obeying any preconceived calculations of its\r\noperator. In this uncertainty lies the charm. If time hangs\r\nheavily or a person is slightly nervous or uneasy, a harmonograph\r\nis a good prescription.\r\n\r\nThe prime essential in a well working harmonograph is a properly\r\nconstructed universal joint. Where such a joint is made with\r\npivots for its bearings, one pair of pivots are very liable to\r\nhave more friction than the other, which retards the movement and\r\ncauses the harmonograph to undergo a continuous change of axis. To\r\nobviate this difficulty, the joint should be made similar to those\r\nused on scales. The general appearance of such a joint is shown in\r\nthe first illustration, Fig. 1. Stirrups A and B are made of 7/8\r\nby 1/4-in. metal. Holes are drilled in each end of these stirrups\r\nand filed out as shown at C. The two holes shown in the center of\r\nthe stirrup A are drilled to fasten the apparatus to the ceiling.\r\nTwo corresponding holes are drilled in B to fasten the long\r\npendulum F to the joint. The cross of the joint D has the ends\r\nshaped as shown at E. The rounded shoulder on E is to prevent the\r\ncross from becoming displaced by a jar or accident. The ends of\r\nthe cross are inserted through the holes C of the stirrups, then\r\nslipped back so the knife edges engage in the V-shaped holes of\r\nthe stirrups. The cross must be so made that the knife edges will\r\nbe in the same plane. This can be determined by placing two of the\r\nknife edges on the jaws of a vise and then laying two rules across\r\nthe other two edges. The rules should just touch the jaws of the\r\nvise and the two knife edges of the cross. This makes a universal\r\njoint almost free from friction and, what is most important,\r\nprevents the pendulum from twisting on its own axis.\r\n\r\nThe pendulum F should be made of ash or oak, 1-3/4 by 2 in., with\r\na length depending on the height of the ceiling. A length of 7 ft.\r\nis about right for a 10-ft. ceiling.\r\n\r\nA small table or platform, K, as shown in the lower part of Fig.\r\n1, is fastened to the lower end of the pendulum as a support for\r\nthe cards on which harmonograms are made. A weight, G, of about 30\r\nor 40 lb.-a box filled with small weights will do--is attached to\r\nthe pendulum just above the table. Another weight of about 10 lb.\r\nis attached as shown at H. A pedestal, J, provides a means of\r\nsupport for the stylus. The stylus arm should have pin-point\r\nbearings, to prevent any side motion.\r\n\r\nThe length of the short pendulum H, which can be regulated, as\r\nshown in Fig. 1, should bear a certain and exactly fixed relation\r\nto the length of the main pendulum, for the swinging times of\r\npendulums are inversely proportionate to their lengths, and unless\r\nthe shorter pendulum is, for instance, exactly one-third,\r\none-fourth, one-fifth, etc., as long as the other, that is, makes\r\nrespectively 3, 4 or 5 swings to one swing of the long pendulum,\r\nthey will not harmonize and a perfect harmonogram is not obtained.\r\n\r\nA good stylus to contain the ink is easily made from a glass tube\r\n1/4 in. in diameter. Heat the tube in an alcohol or Bunsen flame\r\nand then, by drawing the two portions apart and twisting at the\r\nsame time, the tube may be drawn to a sharp point. An opening of\r\nany desired size is made in the point by rubbing it on a\r\nwhetstone. Owing to the fact that the style of universal joint\r\ndescribed has so little friction, the stylus point must be very\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lines Made with the Harmonograph]\r\n\r\nfine, or the lines will overlap and blur. A small weight, such as\r\na shoe buttoner, placed on the arm near the stylus will cause\r\nenough friction to make the pendulum "die" faster and thus remedy\r\nthe trouble.\r\n--Contributed by Wm.

Wash the prints thoroughly and hang them up\r\nwith clips to dry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Cutting Loaf Bread [36]\r\n\r\nWhen cutting a loaf of bread do not slice it from the outer\r\ncrusted end. Cut through the center, then cut slices from the\r\ncenter toward the ends. The two cut surfaces can be placed\r\ntogether, thus excluding the air and keeping the bread fresh as\r\nlong as there is any left to slice.\r\n--Contributed by L. Alberta Norrell, Augusta, Ga.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make an Electric Toaster [37]\r\n\r\nThe electric toaster shown in the sketch is not hard to make. The\r\nframework comprising the base and the two uprights may be made\r\neither of hardwood or asbestos board, says Popular Electricity. If\r\nconstructed of the former, the portion of the base under the coil,\r\nand the inside surfaces of the two uprights should be covered with\r\na 1/8-in. sheet of well made asbestos paper, or thin asbestos\r\nboard may be substituted for this lining. Asbestos board is to be\r\npreferred, and this material in almost any degree of hardness may\r\nbe purchased. It can be worked into shape and will hold wood\r\nscrews. The detail drawing gives all dimensions necessary to shape\r\nthe wood or asbestos board.\r\n\r\nAfter preparing the base and uprights, drill 15 holes, 1/4 in.\r\ndeep, into the inside face of each upright to support the No. 6\r\ngauge wires shown. The wires at the top and bottom for holding the\r\nresistance wire are covered with asbestos paper and the holes for\r\nthese wires are 3/4 in. from the top and bottom, respectively, of\r\nthe uprights. The wires that form the cage about the heater coil\r\nand are used for a support for the toast are 15 pieces of No. 6\r\ngauge iron wire each 8 in. long. The screws that hold the uprights\r\nin position should have the heads countersunk on the under side of\r\nthe base. The binding-posts should now be set in position and\r\ntheir protecting covering\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Detail of Toaster]\r\n\r\ncontaining the reinforced cord left until the other parts are\r\nfinished.\r\n\r\nTo assemble, secure one upright in position using 1-1/2 in.\r\nwood-screws. Place the other upright where it belongs without\r\nfastening it and put the stretcher wires for holding the\r\nresistance wire in place. Put the asbestos paper on these and with\r\nthe assistance of a helper begin winding on the heater coil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Toaster Complete]\r\n\r\nUse 80 ft. of 18-per-cent No. 22 gauge German-silver wire. Wind\r\nthe successive turns of wire so they will not touch each other and\r\nfasten at each end with a turn or two of No. 16 gauge copper wire.\r\nWhen this is complete have the helper hold the stretcher wires\r\nwhile you tip the unfastened upright out and insert the wires of\r\nthe cage, then fasten the upright in place.\r\n\r\nThe wire from the binding-posts to the coil may be what is known\r\nunderwriters\' wire or asbestos-covered wire No. 14 gauge, which is\r\nheld in place by double-headed tacks containing an insulation at\r\nthe head. These may be procured from electrical supply houses.\r\nConnect the reinforced cord and terminals to the binding screws\r\nand fasten the cover in place. This toaster will take four amperes\r\non 110-volt circuit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Cabinet for the Amateur\'s Workshop [37]\r\n\r\nOne of the most convenient adjuncts to an amateur\'s workbench is a\r\ncabinet of some sort in which to keep nails, rivets, screws, etc.,\r\ninstead of leaving them scattered all about the bench. A very\r\neasily made cabinet for this purpose is shown in the accompanying\r\nillustration. The case may be made of 1/2-in. white pine or white\r\nwood of a suitable size to hold the required number of drawers\r\nwhich slide on strips of the same material, cut and dressed 1/2\r\nin. square. The drawers are made of empty cigar boxes of uniform\r\nsize,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Empty Cigar Boxes Used for Drawers]\r\n\r\nwhich, if one is not a smoker, may be readily obtained from any\r\ncigar dealer, as they are usually thrown away when empty.\r\n\r\nSmall knobs may be added if desired, but these are not necessary,\r\nas the spaces shown between the drawers give ample room to grasp\r\nthem with the fingers. Labels of some kind are needed, and one of\r\nthe neatest things for this purpose is the embossed aluminum\r\nlabel, such as is stamped by the well known penny-in-the-slot\r\nmachines to be found in many railroad stations and amusement\r\nplaces.\r\n--Contributed by Frederick E. Ward, Ampere, N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Uncurling Photographs [38]\r\n\r\nPhotograph prints can be kept from curling when dry, by giving\r\nthem the same treatment as was once used on films. Immerse for 5\r\nminutes in a bath made by adding 14 oz. of glycerine to 16 oz. of\r\nwater,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Soldering for the Amateur [38]\r\n\r\nSuccessful soldering will present no serious difficulties to\r\nanyone who will follow a few simple directions. Certain metals are\r\neasier to join with solder than others and some cannot be soldered\r\nat all. Copper, brass, zinc, tin, lead, galvanized iron, gold and\r\nsilver or any combination of these metals can be easily soldered,\r\nwhile iron and aluminum are common metals that cannot be soldered.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to possess a soldering copper, a piece of solder,\r\ntinner\'s acid, sandpaper or steel wool, a small file and a piece\r\nof sal ammoniac. If the soldering copper is an old one, or has\r\nbecome corroded, it must be ground or filed to a point. Heat it\r\nuntil hot (not red hot), melt a little solder on the sal ammoniac,\r\nand rub the point of the copper on it, turning the copper over to\r\nthoroughly tin the point on each face. This process is known as\r\ntinning the iron and is very necessary to successful work.\r\n\r\nAfter the copper is tinned you may place it in the fire again,\r\nbeing careful about the heat, as too hot an iron will burn off the\r\ntinning.\r\n\r\nThe parts to be soldered must be thoroughly cleaned by\r\nsandpapering or the use of steel wool until the metal shows up\r\nbright. Then apply the acid only to the parts to be soldered with\r\na small stiff brush or a small piece of cloth fastened to a stick,\r\nor in a bent piece of tin to form a swab.\r\n\r\nTinner\'s acid is made by putting as much zinc in commercial\r\nmuriatic acid as will dissolve. This process is best accomplished\r\nin an open earthenware dish. After the acid has ceased to boil and\r\nbecomes cool it may be poured into a wide-mouthed bottle which has\r\na good top or stopper, and labeled "Poison."\r\n\r\nPlace the parts to be soldered in their correct position and apply\r\nthe hot copper to the solder, then to the joint to be soldered,\r\nfollowing around with the copper and applying solder as is\r\nnecessary. In joining large pieces it is best to "stick" them\r\ntogether in several places to hold the work before trying to get\r\nall around them. A little practice will soon teach the requisite\r\namount of solder and the smoothness required for a good job.\r\n\r\nIn soldering galvanized iron, the pure muriatic acid should be\r\nused, particularly so when the iron has once been used. --C. G.\r\nS., Eureka Springs, Ark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Washboard Holder [39]\r\n\r\nWhen using a washboard it will continually slip down in the tub.\r\nThis is considerable annoyance, especially if a large tub is used.\r\nThe washboard can be kept in place with small metal hooks, as\r\nshown in the sketch. Two of these are fastened to the back of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Clip on the Washboard]\r\n\r\nthe washboard in the right place to keep it at the proper slant.\r\n--Contributed by W. A.

I have one made of mahogany finished\r\nin natural color, and one made of poplar finished black. The\r\ndimensions given in the detail drawings are sufficient for anyone\r\nto make this bracket. The amount of material required is very\r\nsmall and can be made from scrap, or purchased from a mill\r\nsurfaced and sanded. The parts are put together with dowel pins.\r\n--Contributed by A.

Apart from this, however, a\r\nring may be made from any metal, such as copper, brass and silver,\r\nif such metals are in plate or sheet form, by the following\r\nmethod:\r\n\r\nAll the tools necessary are a die and punch which are simple to\r\nmake and will form a ring that will fit the average finger. Take a\r\n3/4-in. nut, B, Fig. 1, and drill out the threads. This will leave\r\na clear hole, 7/8 in. in diameter, or a hole drilled the desired\r\nsize in a piece of iron plate will do as well. Countersink the top\r\nof the hole so that the full diameter of the countersink will be\r\n1-1/4 in. This completes the die. The punch A, is made of a piece\r\nof 5/8 in. round iron, slightly rounded on the end so that it will\r\nnot cut through the metal disk. The dimensions shown in Fig. 1 can\r\nbe changed to suit the size of the finger to be fitted.\r\n\r\nThe metal used should be about 1/16 in. thick and 1-1/4 in. in\r\ndiameter. Anneal it properly by heating and plunging in water. Lay\r\nit on the die so that it will fit nicely in the countersink and\r\ndrive it through the hole by striking the punch with a hammer.\r\nHold the punch as nearly central as possible when starting to\r\ndrive the metal through the hole. The disk will come out pan\r\nshaped, C, and it is only necessary to remove the bottom of the\r\npan to have a band which will leave a hole 5/8 in. in diameter and\r\n1-1/4 in. wide. Place the band, D, Fig. 2, on a stick so that the\r\nedges can be filed and rounded to shape. Finish with fine emery\r\ncloth and polish. Brass rings can be plated when finished.\r\n--Contributed by H. W. Hankin, Troy, N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Bind Magazines [40]\r\n\r\nA great many readers of Popular Mechanics Magazine save their\r\ncopies and have them bound in book form and some keep them without\r\nbinding. The bound volumes make an attractive library and will\r\nalways be valuable works of reference along mechanical lines. I\r\nbind my magazines at home evenings, with good results. Six issues\r\nmake a well proportioned book, which gives two bound volumes each\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe covers of the magazines are removed, the wire binders pulled\r\nout with a pair of pliers and the advertising pages removed from\r\nboth sides, after which it will be found that the remainder is in\r\nsections, each section containing four double leaves or sixteen\r\npages. These sections are each removed in turn from the others,\r\nusing a pocket knife to separate them if they stick, and each\r\nsection is placed as they were in the magazine upon each preceding\r\none until all six numbers have been prepared. If started with the\r\nJanuary or the July issue, the pages will be numbered\r\nconsecutively through the entire pages of the six issues.\r\n\r\nThe sections are then prepared for sewing. They are evened up on\r\nthe edges by jarring on a flat surface. They are then placed\r\nbetween two pieces of board and all clamped in a vise. Five cuts,\r\n1/8 in. deep, are made with a saw across the back of the sections,\r\nas shown in Fig. 1. Heavy plain paper is used for the flyleaves.\r\nThe paper is cut double the same as the leaves comprising the\r\nsections, making either one or two double sections for each side\r\nas desired.\r\n\r\nA frame for sewing will have to be made as shown in Fig. 2 before\r\nthe work can be continued on the book. The frame is easily made of\r\nfour pieces of wood. The bottom piece A should be a little larger\r\nthan the book. The two upright pieces B are nailed to the outside\r\nedge, and a third piece, C, is nailed across the top. Small nails\r\nare driven part way into the base C to correspond to the saw cuts\r\nin the sections. A piece of soft fiber string is stretched from\r\neach nail to the crosspiece C and tied.\r\n\r\nCoarse white thread, size 16 or larger, is used for the sewing\r\nmaterial. Start with the front of the book. Be sure that all\r\nsections are in their right places and that the flyleaves are\r\nprovided in the front and back. Take the sections of the flyleaves\r\non top, which should be notched the same as the saw cuts in the\r\nbook sections, and place them against the strings in the frame.\r\nPlace the left hand on the inside of the leaves where they are\r\nfolded and start a blunt needle, threaded double, through the\r\nnotch on the left side of the string No. 1 in Fig. 2. Take hold of\r\nthe needle with the right hand and pass it to the left around the\r\nstring No. 1, then back through the notch on the right side.\r\nFasten the thread by tying or making a knot in the end and passing\r\nthe needle through it. After drawing the thread tightly, pass the\r\nneedle through the notch on the left side of the string No. 2,\r\npassing it around the string and tying in the same manner as for\r\nNo. 1. Each section is fastened to the five strings in the same\r\nmanner, the thread being carried across from each tie from No. 1\r\nto 2 then to 3 and so on\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Frame for Sewing Sections]\r\n\r\nuntil all strings are tied. The string No. 5 is treated in the\r\nsame manner only that the needle is run through on the left side\r\nof the string a second time, leaving the needle on the outside in\r\nposition for the next section, which is fastened the same as the\r\nfirst, the needle being passed through the notch on the right side\r\nof the string No. 5, and then to string No.4, passing around on\r\nthe right side and back on the left and so on. Keep the thread\r\ndrawn up tightly all the time.\r\n\r\nAfter the sewing is completed cut the strings, allowing about 2\r\nin. of the ends extending on each side. The fibers of these ends\r\nare separated and combed out so that they can be glued to the\r\ncovers to serve as a hinge. A piece of cheesecloth is cut to the\r\nsize of the back and glued to it. Ordinary liquid glue is the best\r\nadhesive to use.\r\n\r\nProcure heavy cardboard for the covers and cut two pieces 1/2 in.\r\nlonger and just the same width as the magazine pages. The covering\r\ncan be of cloth, leather or paper according to the taste and\r\nresources of the maker. The covering should be cut out 1 in.\r\nlarger on all edges than both covers and space on the back. Place\r\nthe cardboard covers on the book, allowing a margin of 1/4 in. on\r\nall edges except the back, and measure the distance between the\r\nback edges of the covers across the back of the book.\r\n\r\nPlace the cardboard covers on the back of the covering the proper\r\ndistance apart as measured for the back, and mark around each one.\r\nSpread thin coat of glue on the surface of each and lay them on by\r\nthe marks made. Cut a notch out of the covering so it will fold\r\nin, and, after gluing\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Bound Book]\r\n\r\na strip of paper to the covering between the covers to strengthen\r\nthe back, fold over the outside edges of the covering and glue it\r\ndown all around.\r\n\r\nPlace the cover on the book in the right position, glue the hinges\r\nfast to the inside of the covers, then glue the first flyleaf to\r\nthe inside of the cover on both front and back and place the whole\r\nunder a weight until dry.\r\n--Contributed by Clyde E.

To the\r\nunder side of one end nail a copper brush (D) to extend out about\r\nan inch. On the upper side, at the same end, nail another brush\r\n(E) so that it projects at both sides and is bent down to the\r\nlevel of the end brush. Then on the board put\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Reverse for Motor]\r\n\r\na semi-circle of brass-headed tacks as shown at F, leaving a small\r\nspace at the middle and placing five tacks on either side, so that\r\nthe end brush will come in contact with each one. Connect these\r\ntacks on the under side of the board with coils of German-silver\r\nwire, using about 8 in. of wire to each coil. Fix these by\r\nsoldering or bending over the ends of the tacks. Then nail two\r\nstrips of copper (G) in such position that the side brush will\r\nremain on the one as long as the end brush remains on the tacks on\r\nthat side.\r\n\r\nPut sides about 1-1/2 in. high around this apparatus, raising the\r\nboard a little from the bottom to allow room for the coil.

If you are going to\r\nuse a current of low tension, as from batteries, the jars need not\r\nbe very large, but if you intend to use the electric light current\r\nof 110 voltage it will be necessary to use large jars or wooden\r\nboxes made watertight, which will hold about 6 or 7 gal. Each jar\r\nto be filled with 20 parts water to 1 part sulphuric acid. Jars\r\nare set in a row in some convenient place out of the way.\r\n\r\nNext cut out eight copper or brass disks, two for each jar. Their\r\nsize also depends on the voltage. The disks that are placed in the\r\nlower part of the jars are connected with a rubber covered wire\r\nextending a little above the top of the jar.\r\n\r\nTo wire the apparatus, refer to the sketch and you will see that\r\njar No. 1 is connected to point No. 1 on switch; No. 2, on No. 2,\r\nand so on until all is complete and we have one remaining point on\r\nswitch. Above the jars place a wire to suspend the other or top\r\ndisks in the solution. This wire is also connected to one terminal\r\non the motor and to remaining point on switch. The arm of the\r\nswitch is connected to one terminal of battery, or source of\r\ncurrent, and the other terminal connected direct to remaining\r\nterminal of motor.\r\n\r\nPut arm of switch on point No. 1 and lower one of the top disks in\r\njar No. 1 and make contact with wire above jars. The current then\r\nwill flow through the motor. The speed for each point can be\r\ndetermined by lowering top disks in jars. The top disk in jar No.\r\n2 is lower down than in No. 1 and so on for No. 3 and No. 4. The\r\nconnection between point No. 5 on switch, direct to wire across\r\njars, gives full current and full speed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Build a Toboggan Sled [44]\r\nBy A. BOETTE\r\n\r\nThe first object of the builder of a sled should be to have a\r\n"winner" both in speed and appearance. The accompanying\r\ninstructions for building a sled are designed to produce these\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nThe sled completed should be 15 ft. 2 in. long by 22 in. wide,\r\nwith the cushion about 15 in. above the ground. For the baseboard\r\nselect a pine board 15 ft. long, 11 in. wide and 2 in. thick, and\r\nplane it on all edges. Fit up the baseboard with ten oak\r\nfoot-rests 22 in. long, 3 in. wide and 3/4 in. thick. Fasten them\r\non the under side of the baseboard at right angles to its length\r\nand 16 in. apart, beginning at the rear. At the front 24 or 26 in.\r\nwill be left without cross bars for fitting on the auto front. On\r\nthe upper side of the cross bars at their ends on each side screw\r\na piece of oak 1 in. square by 14 ft. long. On the upper side of\r\nthe baseboard at its edge on each side screw an oak strip 3 in.\r\nwide by 3/4 in. thick and the length of the sled from the back to\r\nthe auto front. These are to keep the cushion from falling out.\r\nSee Fig. 1. For the back of the sled use the upper part of a\r\nchild\'s high chair, taking out the spindles and resetting them in\r\nthe rear end of the baseboard. Cover up the outside of the\r\nspindles with a piece of galvanized iron.\r\n\r\nThe construction of the runners is shown by Figs. 2 and 3. The\r\nstock required for them is oak, two pieces 30 in. by 5 in. by\r\n1-1/4 in., two pieces 34 in. by 5 in. by 1-1/4 in., two pieces 14\r\nin. by 6 in. by 2 in., and four pieces 14 in. by 2 in. by 1 in.\r\nThey should be put together with large screws about 3 in. long.\r\nUse no nails, as they are not substantial enough. In proportioning\r\nthem the points A, B and C, Fig. 2, are important. For the front\r\nrunners these measurements are: A, 30 in.; B, 4 in.; C, 15-1/2\r\nin., and for the rear runners: A, 34 in.; B, 7 in. ; C, 16-1/2 in.\r\nThe screw eyes indicated must be placed in a straight line and the\r\nholes for them carefully centered. A variation of 1/16 in. one way\r\nor another would cause a great deal of trouble. For the steel\r\nrunners use 3/8 in. cold-rolled steel flattened at the ends for\r\nscrew holes. Use no screws on the running surface, however, as\r\nthey "snatch" the ice.\r\n\r\nThe mechanism of the front steering gear is shown at Fig. 3. A\r\n3/4-in. steel rod makes a good steering rod. Flatten the steering\r\nrod at one end and sink it into the wood. Hold it in place by\r\nmeans of an iron plate drilled to receive the rod and screwed to\r\nblock X. An iron washer, Z, is used to reduce friction; bevel\r\nblock K to give a rocker motion. Equip block X with screw eyes,\r\nmaking them clear those in the front runner, and bolt through. For\r\nthe rear runner put a block with screw eyes on the baseboard and\r\nrun a bolt through.\r\n\r\nConstruct the auto front (Fig. 4) of  3/4-in. oak boards. The\r\nillustration shows how to shape it. Bevel it toward all sides and\r\nkeep the edges sharp, as sharp edges are best suited for the brass\r\ntrimmings which are to be added. When the auto front is in place\r\nenamel the sled either a dark maroon or a creamy white. First\r\nsandpaper all the wood, then apply a coat of thin enamel. Let\r\nstand for three days and apply another coat. Three coats of enamel\r\nand one of thin varnish will make a fine-looking sled. For the\r\nbrass trimmings use No. 27 B. & S. sheet brass 1 in. wide on all\r\nthe front edges and pieces 3 in. square on the cross bars to rest\r\nthe feet against. On the door of the auto front put the monogram\r\nof the owner or owners of the sled, cutting it out of sheet brass.\r\n\r\nFor the steering-wheel procure an old freight-car "brake" wheel,\r\nbrass plated. Fasten a horn, such as used on automobiles, to the\r\nwheel.\r\n\r\nMake the cushion of leather and stuff it with hair. The best way\r\nis to get some strong, cheap material, such as burlap, sew up one\r\nend and make in\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Construction a "Winner" Toboggan Sled]\r\n\r\nthe form of an oblong bag. Stuff this as tightly as possible with\r\nhair. Then get some upholstery buttons, fasten a cord through the\r\nloop, bring the cord through to the underside of the cushion, and\r\nfasten the button by slipping a nail through the knot. Then put a\r\nleather covering over the burlap, sewing it to the burlap on the\r\nunder side. Make the cushion for the back in the same way. On top\r\nof the cushion supports run a brass tube to serve the double\r\npurpose of holding the cushion down and affording something to\r\nhold on to.\r\n\r\nIf desired, bicycle lamps may be fastened to the front end, to\r\nimprove the appearance, and it is well to have a light of some\r\nkind at the back to avoid the danger of rear-end collisions.\r\n\r\nThe door of the auto front should be hinged and provided with a\r\nlock so that skates, parcels, overshoes, lunch, etc. may be stowed\r\nwithin. A silk pennant with a monogram adds to the appearance.\r\n\r\nIf desired, a brake may be added to the sled. This can be a\r\nwrought-iron lever 1-1/2 in. by 1/2 in. by 30 in. long, so pivoted\r\nthat moving the handle will cause the end to scrape the ice. This\r\nsled can be made without lamps and horn at a cost of about $15, or\r\nwith these for $25, and the pleasure derived from it well repays\r\nthe builder. If the expense is greater than one can afford, a\r\nnumber of boys may share in the ownership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Burning Inscriptions on Trees\r\n\r\nScrape off the bark just enough to come to the first light under\r\ncoating, which is somewhat moist.

Draw a circle\r\non paper, the same diameter as the wheel. Divide the circumference\r\ninto the number of parts desired, by drawing diameters, Fig. 1.\r\nThe distance AB will be approximately the pitch. Now describe a\r\nsmaller circle for the base of the teeth and halfway between these\r\ncircles may be taken as the pitch circle.\r\n\r\nNow describe a circle the same size as the largest circle on a\r\npiece of 1/16-in. sheet metal, and having cut it out and filed it\r\nup to this circle, fasten the marked-out paper circle accurately\r\nover it with glue. Saw-cuts can now be made down the diameters to\r\nthe smaller circle with the aid of a saw guide, Fig. 2, made from\r\n1/16-in. mild steel or iron. This guide should have a beveled\r\nedge, E, from F to G, to lay along the line on which the saw-cut\r\nis to be made. The straight-edge, CD, should be set back one-half\r\nthe thickness of the saw-blades, so that the center of the blade,\r\nwhen flat against it, will be over the line FG. A small clearance\r\nspace, FC, must be made to allow the teeth of the saw to pass.\r\n\r\nThe guide should then be placed along one of the diameters and\r\nheld in position until gripped in the vise, Fig. 3. The first\r\ntooth may now be cut, care being taken to keep the blade of the\r\nsaw flat up to the guiding edge. The Model Engineer, London, says\r\nif this is done and the saw-guide well made, the cut will be\r\ncentral on the line, and if the marking-out is correct the teeth\r\nwill be quite uniform all the way round. A small ward file will be\r\nneeded to finish off the teeth to their proper shape and\r\nthickness.\r\n\r\nIn making a worm wheel the cuts must be taken in a sloping\r\ndirection, the slope and pitch depending on the slope and pitch of\r\nthe worm thread, which, though more difficult, may also be cut\r\nwith a hacksaw and file.\r\n\r\nA bevel wheel should be cut in the same manner as the spur wheel,\r\nbut the cut should be deeper on the side which has the larger\r\ndiameter. To cut a rack the pitch should be marked along the side,\r\nand the guide and saw used as before (Fig. 4).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make Four Pictures on One Plate [46]\r\n\r\nSecure two extra slides for the plate holders and cut one corner\r\nout on one\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Four Photos on One Plate]\r\n\r\nof them, as shown in Fig. 1. Make a hole in the other, as shown in\r\nFig. 2. With a lead pencil draw on the ground glass one line\r\nvertical and one horizontal, each in the center. This will divide\r\nthe ground glass into four equal parts.\r\n\r\nFocus the camera in the usual manner, but get the picture desired\r\nto fill only one of the parts on the ground glass. Place the\r\nplate-holder in position and draw the regular slide; substitute\r\none of the slides prepared and expose in the usual way.\r\n\r\nIf a small picture is to be made in the lower left-hand corner of\r\nthe plate, place the prepared slide with the corner cut, as shown\r\nin Fig. 1. The slide may be turned over for the upper left hand\r\ncorner and then changed for slide shown in Fig. 2 for the upper\r\nand lower right-hand corners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Electric Blue-Light Experiment  [47]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Electric Blue-light]\r\n\r\nTake a jump-spark coil and connect it up with a battery and start\r\nthe vibrator. Then take one outlet wire, R, and connect to one\r\nside of a 2-cp. electric lamp, and the other outlet wire, B, hold\r\nin one hand, and press all fingers of the other hand on globe at\r\npoint A. A bright, blue light will come from the wires in the lamp\r\nto the surface of the globe where the fingers touch. No shock will\r\nbe perceptible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Interesting Electrical Experiment  [47]\r\n\r\nThe materials necessary for performing this experiment are:\r\nTelephone receiver, transmitter, some wire and some carbons,\r\neither the pencils for arc lamps, or ones taken from old dry\r\nbatteries will do.\r\n\r\nRun a line from the inside of the house to the inside of some\r\nother building and fasten it to one terminal of the receiver. To\r\nthe other terminal fasten another piece of wire and ground it on\r\nthe water faucet in the house. If there is no faucet in the house,\r\nground it with a large piece of zinc.\r\n\r\nFasten the other end to one terminal of the transmitter and from\r\nthe other terminal of the same run a wire into the ground. The\r\nground here should consist either of a large piece of carbon, or\r\nseveral pieces bound tightly together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Unique Battery]\r\n\r\nIf a person speak into the transmitter, one at the receiver can\r\nhear what is said, even though there are no batteries in the\r\ncircuit. It is a well known fact that two telephone receivers\r\nconnected up in this way will transmit words between two persons,\r\nfor the voice vibrating the diaphragm causes an inductive current\r\nto flow and the other receiver copies these vibrations. But in\r\nthis experiment, a transmitter which induces no current is used.\r\nDo the carbon and the zinc and the moist earth form a battery?\r\n--Contributed by Wm. J.

A is a wooden block,\r\nwhich is fastened under the loft at a gable end of the barn; B is\r\nan iron weight attached to the string C, and this string passes up\r\nthrough the barn to the roof, then over a hook or pulley and\r\nacross the barn, under the gable, and is fastened to the opposite\r\nend of the barn.\r\n\r\nD D are binding posts for electric wires. They have screw ends, as\r\nshown, by which means they are fastened to the wooden block A.\r\nThey also hold the brass piece E and the strip of spring brass F\r\nin place against the wooden block. G is a leather strap fastened\r\nto the weight B and the spring F connected to the latter by a\r\nsmall sink bolt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Electric Fire Alarm]\r\n\r\nAt the house an electric bell is placed wherever convenient.\r\nSeveral battery cells, of course, are also needed. Dry batteries\r\nare most convenient. The battery cells and bell are connected in\r\nthe usual manner, and one wire from the bell and one from the\r\nbattery are strung to the barn and connected to the binding posts\r\nD D.\r\n\r\nIf a fire occurs in the hay-mow the blaze will generally shoot\r\ntoward the gable soon after it starts, and will then burn the\r\nstring C, which allows the weight B to fall and pull the brass\r\nspring against the iron piece E, which closes the circuit and\r\nrings the bell in the house.\r\n\r\nIf desired, the string may be stretched back and forth under the\r\nroof several times or drawn through any place that is in danger of\r\nfire.\r\n--Contributed by Geo.

One like a loaf of\r\nbread, and about that size, serves admirably. Wrap a layer of\r\nasbestos around it and cover this with a thin layer of\r\nplaster-of-paris. When the plaster is nearly dry wind a coil of\r\nNo. 36 wire around it, taking care that the wire does not touch\r\nitself anywhere. Put another course of plaster-of-paris on this,\r\nand again wind the wire around it. Continue the process of\r\nalternate layers of plaster and wire until 500 ft. or more of the\r\nlatter has been used, leaving about 10 in. at each end for\r\nterminals. Then set the whole core away to dry.\r\n\r\nFor a base use a pine board 10 in. by 12 in. by 1 in. Bore four\r\nholes at one end for binding-posts, as indicated by E E. Connect\r\nthe holes in pairs by ordinary house fuse wire. At one side secure\r\ntwo receptacles, B B, and one single post switch, C. Place another\r\nswitch at I and another binding-post at F. The oven is now ready\r\nto be connected.\r\n\r\nWithdraw the wooden core from the coils of wire and secure the\r\nlatter by bands of tin to the board. Connect the ends of the wire\r\nto binding-posts E and F, as shown. From the other set of\r\nbinding-posts, E, run a No. 12 or No. 14 wire, connecting lamp\r\nreceptacles, B B, and switch, C, in parallel. Connect these three\r\nto switch, D, in series with binding-post, F, the terminal of the\r\ncoil. Place 16-cp. lights in the receptacles and connect the fuses\r\nwith a 110-volt lighting circuit. The apparatus is now ready for\r\noperation. Turn on switch, D, and the lamps, while C is open. The\r\ncoil will commence to become warm, soon drying out the\r\nplaster-of-paris.

This is accomplished by making the needle revolve in a\r\nvertical instead of a horizontal plane. The only adjustment\r\nnecessary is that of leveling, which is accomplished by turning\r\nthe thumbscrew shown at A, Fig. 1, until the hand points to zero\r\non the scale.\r\n\r\nFirst make a support, Fig. 2, by bending a piece of sheet brass to\r\nthe shape indicated and tapping for the screws CC. These should\r\nhave hollow ends, as shown, for the purpose of receiving the\r\npivoted axle which supports the hand. The core, Fig. 3, is made of\r\niron. It is 1 in. long, 1/4 in. wide and 1/8 in. thick. At a point\r\na little above the center, drill a hole as shown at H, and through\r\nthis hole drive a piece of knitting-needle about 1/2 in. long, or\r\nlong enough to reach between the two screws shown in Fig. 2. The\r\nends of this small axle should be ground pointed and should turn\r\neasily in the cavities, as the sensitiveness of the instrument\r\ndepends on the ease with which this axle turns.\r\n\r\nAfter assembling the core as shown in Fig. 4, it should be filed a\r\nlittle at one end until it assumes the position indicated. The\r\npointer or hand, Fig. 5, is made of wire, aluminum being\r\npreferable for this purpose, although copper or steel will do.\r\nMake the wire 4-1/2 in. long and make a loop, D, 1/2 in. from the\r\nlower end. Solder to the short end a piece of brass, E, of such\r\nweight that it will exactly balance the weight of the hand. This\r\nis slipped on the pivot, and the whole thing is again placed in\r\nposition in the support. If the pointer is correctly balanced it\r\nshould take the position shown in Fig. 1, but if it is not exactly\r\nright a little filing will bring it near enough so that it may be\r\ncorrected by the adjusting-screw.\r\n\r\nNext make a brass frame as shown in Fig. 6. This may be made of\r\nwood, although brass is better, as the eddy currents set up in a\r\nconductor surrounding a magnet tend to stop oscillation of the\r\nmagnet. (The core is magnetized when a current flows through the\r\ninstrument.) The brass frame is wound with magnet wire, the size\r\ndepending on the number of amperes to be measured. Mine is wound\r\nwith two layers of No. 14 wire, 10 turns to each layer, and is\r\nabout right for ordinary experimental purposes. The ends of the\r\nwire are fastened to the binding posts B and C, Fig. 1.\r\n\r\nA wooden box, D, is then made and provided with a glass front. A\r\npiece of paper is pasted on a piece of wood, which is then\r\nfastened in the box in such a position that the hand or pointer\r\nwill lie close to the paper scale. The box is 5-1/2 in. high, 4\r\nin. wide and 1-3/4 in. deep, inside measurements. After everything\r\nis assembled put a drop of solder on the loop at D, Fig. 5, to\r\nprevent it turning on the axle.\r\n\r\nTo calibrate the instrument connect as shown in Fig. 7, where A is\r\nthe homemade ammeter; B, a standard ammeter; C, a variable\r\nresistance, and D, a battery, consisting of three or more cells\r\nconnected in multiple. Throw in enough resistance to make the\r\nstandard instrument read 1 ohm [sic: ampere] and then put a mark\r\non the paper scale of the instrument to be calibrated. Continue in\r\nthis way with 2 amperes, 3 amperes, 4 amperes, etc., until the\r\nscale is full. To make a voltmeter out of this instrument, wind\r\nwith plenty of No. 36 magnet wire instead of No. 14, or if it is\r\ndesired to make an instrument for measuring both volts and\r\namperes, use both windings and connect to two pairs of binding\r\nposts.\r\n--Contributed by J.E.

To make one, secure a\r\npet cock and drill and tap hole through, as shown in the cut. If\r\nfor 3-way, drill in only to the opening already through, but if\r\nfor a 4-way, drill through the entire case and valve. Be sure to\r\nhave valve B turned so as to drill at right angles to the opening\r\nthrough it. After drilling, remove the valve, take off the burr\r\nwith a piece of emery paper and replace ready for work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Easy Experiments with Electric-Light Circuit [50]\r\n\r\nAn electric-light circuit will be found much less expensive than\r\nbatteries for performing electrical experiments. The sketch shows\r\nhow a small arc light and motor may be connected to the light\r\nsocket, A. The light is removed and a plug with wire connections\r\nis put in its place. One wire runs to the switch, B, and the other\r\nconnects with the water rheostat, which is used for reducing the\r\ncurrent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Arc-Light Motor and Water Rheostat]\r\n\r\nA tin can, C is filled nearly to the top with salt water, and a\r\nmetal rod, D, is passed through a piece of wood fastened at the\r\ntop of the can. When the metal rod is lowered the current\r\nincreases, and as it is withdrawn the current grows weaker. In\r\nthis way the desired amount of current can be obtained.\r\n\r\nBy connecting the motor, E, and the arc light, F, as shown, either\r\none may be operated by turning switch B to the corresponding\r\npoint. The arc light is easily made by fastening two electric\r\nlight carbons in a wooden frame like that shown. To start the\r\nlight, turn the current on strong and bring the points of the\r\ncarbons together; then separate slightly by twisting the upper\r\ncarbon and at the same time drawing it through the hole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make an Interrupter [51]\r\n\r\nThe Wenult interrupter is an instrument much used on large coils\r\nand is far more efficient than the usual\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Details of Interrupter]\r\n\r\nform of vibrators. It can also be used with success on small coils\r\nas well as large. Although it is a costly instrument to purchase,\r\nit can be made with practically no expense and the construction is\r\nvery simple.\r\n\r\nFirst procure a wide-mouthed bottle about 4 in. high, provided\r\nwith a rubber stopper. This stopper should be pierced, making two\r\nholes about 1/4 in. in diameter. From a sheet of lead 1/16 in. in\r\nthickness\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Completed Instrument]\r\n\r\ncut a piece shaped like A, Fig. 1. Common tea lead folded several\r\ntimes will serve the purpose. When in the bottle this lead should\r\nbe of such a size that it will only reach half way around, as\r\nshown in B. To insert the lead plate, roll it up so it will pass\r\nthrough the neck of the bottle, then smooth it out with a small\r\nstick until it fits against the side, leaving the small strip at\r\nthe top projecting through the neck of the bottle. Bend this strip\r\nto one side and fit in the stopper, as shown in C. A small\r\nbinding-post is fastened at the end of the strip.\r\n\r\nHaving fixed the lead plate in position, next get a piece of glass\r\ntube having a bore of about 1/32 of an inch in diameter. A piece\r\nof an old thermometer tube will serve this purpose. Insert this\r\ntube in the hole in the stopper farthest from the lead plate. Get\r\na piece of wire that will fit the tube and about 6 in. long, and\r\nfasten a small binding-post on one end and stick the other into\r\nthe tube. This wire should fit the hole in the tube so it can be\r\neasily moved. In the hole nearest the lead plate insert a small\r\nglass funnel.\r\n\r\nThe interrupter as it is when complete is shown at D, Fig. 1.\r\nHaving finished the interrupter, connect it with the\r\nelectric-light circuit as shown in Fig. 2. Fill the bottle with\r\nwater to about the line as shown in D, Fig. 1. Adjust the wire in\r\nthe small glass tube so that it projects about 1/8 in. Add\r\nsulphuric acid until the water level rises about 1/16 in. Turn on\r\nthe current and press the button, B. If all adjustments are\r\ncorrect, there will be a loud crackling noise from the\r\ninterrupter, a violet flame will appear at the end of the wire and\r\na hot spark will pass between the secondary terminals. If the\r\ninterrupter does not work at first, add more sulphuric acid\r\nthrough the funnel and press the wire down a little more into the\r\nliquid. A piece of wood, A, Fig. 2, should be inserted in vibrator\r\nto prevent it from working.\r\n--Contributed by Harold L. Jones, Carthage, N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Miniature "Pepper\'s Ghost" Illusion [52]\r\n\r\nProbably many readers have seen a "Pepper\'s Ghost" illusion at\r\nsome amusement place. As there shown, the audience is generally\r\nseated in a dark room at the end of which there is a stage with\r\nblack hangings. One of the audience is invited onto the stage,\r\nwhere he is placed in an upright open\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pepper\'s Ghost]\r\n\r\ncoffin. A white shroud is thrown over his body, and his clothes\r\nand flesh gradually fade away till nothing but his skeleton\r\nremains, which immediately begins to dance a horrible rattling\r\njig. The skeleton then fades away and the man is restored again.\r\n\r\nA simple explanation is given in the Model Engineer. Between the\r\naudience and the coffin is a sheet of transparent glass, inclined\r\nat an angle so as to reflect objects located behind the scenes,\r\nbut so clear as to be invisible to the audience and the man in the\r\ncoffin. At the beginning the stage is lighted only from behind the\r\nglass. Hence the coffin and its occupant are seen through the\r\nglass very plainly. The lights in front of the glass (behind the\r\nscenes) are now raised very gradually as those behind the glass\r\nare turned down, until it is dark there. The perfectly black\r\nsurface behind the glass now acts like the silver backing for a\r\nmirror, and the object upon which the light is now turned--in this\r\ncase the skeleton--is reflected in the glass, appearing to the\r\naudience as if really occupying the stage.\r\n\r\nThe model, which requires no special skill except that of\r\ncarpentry, is constructed as shown in the drawings.\r\n\r\nThe box containing the stage should be 14 in. by 7 in. by 7-1/2\r\nin., inside dimensions. The box need not be made of particularly\r\ngood wood, as the entire interior, with the exception of the\r\nglass, figures and lights, should be colored a dull black. This\r\ncan well be done by painting with a solution of lampblack in\r\nturpentine. If everything is not black, especially the joints and\r\nbackground near A, the illusion will be spoiled.\r\n\r\nThe glass should be the clearest possible, and must be thoroughly\r\ncleansed. Its edges should nowhere be visible, and it should be\r\nfree from scratches and imperfections. The figure A should be a\r\ndoll about 4 in. high, dressed in brilliant, light-colored\r\ngarments. The skeleton is made of papier mach\xc3\xa9, and can be bought\r\nat Japanese stores. It should preferably be one with arms\r\nsuspended by small spiral springs, giving a limp, loose-jointed\r\neffect. The method of causing the skeleton to dance is shown in\r\nthe front view. The figure is hung from the neck by a blackened\r\nstiff wire attached to the hammer wire of an electric bell, from\r\nwhich the gong has been removed. When the bell works he will kick\r\nagainst the rear wall, and wave his arms up and down, thus giving\r\nas realistic a dance as anyone, could expect from a skeleton.\r\n\r\nThe lights, L and M, should be miniature electric lamps, which can\r\nbe run by three dry cells. They need to give a fairly strong\r\nlight, especially L, which should have a conical tin reflector to\r\nincrease its brilliancy and prevent its being reflected in the\r\nglass.\r\n\r\nSince the stage should be some distance from the audience, to aid\r\nthe illusion, the angle of the glass and the inclination of the\r\ndoll, A, has been so designed that if the stage is placed on a\r\nmantle or other high shelf, the image of A will appear upright to\r\nan observer sitting in a chair some distance away, within the\r\nlimits of an ordinary room. If it is desired to place the box\r\nlower down, other angles for the image and glass may be found\r\nnecessary, but the proper tilt can be found readily by experiment.\r\n\r\nThe electric connections are so simple that they are not shown in\r\nthe drawings. All that is necessary is a two-point switch, by\r\nwhich either L or M can be placed in circuit with the battery, and\r\na press button in circuit with the bell and its cell.\r\n\r\nIf a gradual transformation is desired, a double-pointed rheostat\r\ncould be used, so that as one light dims the other increases in\r\nbrilliancy, by the insertion and removal of resistance coils.\r\n\r\nWith a clear glass and a dark room this model has proved to be\r\nfully as bewildering as its prototype.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Experiment with Colored Electric Lamps [53]\r\n\r\nTo many the following experiment may be much more easily performed\r\nthan explained: Place the hand or other object in the light coming\r\nfrom two incandescent lamps, one red and\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Two-Colored Hand]\r\n\r\none white, placed about a foot apart, and allow the shadow to fall\r\non a white screen such as a table-cloth. Portions of the shadow\r\nwill then appear to be a bright green. A similar experiment\r\nconsists in first turning on the red light for about a minute and\r\nthen turning it off at the same time that the white one is turned\r\non. The entire screen will then appear to be a vivid green for\r\nabout one second, after which it assumes its normal color.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** To Explode Powder with Electricity [53]\r\n\r\nA 1-in. hole was bored in the center of a 2-in. square block. Two\r\nfinishing nails were driven in, as shown in the sketch. These were\r\nconnected to terminals of an induction coil. After everything was\r\nready the powder was poured in the hole and a board weighted with\r\nrocks placed over the block. When the button is pressed\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Exploding Powder]\r\n\r\nor the circuit closed in some other way the discharge occurs. The\r\ndistance between the nail points--which must be bright and\r\nclean--should be just enough to give a good, fat spark.\r\n--Contributed by Geo. W.

The plates\r\nE can be made of tin or galvanized iron, and should be separated\r\nabout 1/8 in. by small pieces of wood. One of these plates is\r\nconnected to metal top, and the wire from the other passes through\r\nthe tube B, which is filled with melted rosin or wax, to make it\r\nairtight. This wire connects to one side of a battery of two\r\ncells, the other wire being soldered to the metal top of the jar,\r\nas shown. The jar is partly filled with a very dilute solution of\r\nsulphuric acid, about 1 part of acid to 20 of water.\r\n\r\nWhen the current of electricity passes between the plates E,\r\nhydrogen gas is generated, which rises and passes through the\r\nrubber hose D, into the receiver G. This is a wide-mouth bottle,\r\nwhich is filled with water and inverted over a pan of water, F.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hydrogen Generator]\r\n\r\nThe gas bubbling up displaces the water and fills the bottle.\r\n\r\nIf the receiver is removed when half full of gas, the remaining\r\nspace will be filled with air, which will mix with the gas and\r\nform an explosive mixture. If a lighted match is then held near\r\nthe mouth of the bottle a sharp report will be heard.\r\n\r\nIf the bottle is fitted with a cork containing two wires nearly\r\ntouching, and the apparatus connected with an induction coil, in\r\nsuch a manner that a spark will be produced inside the bottle, the\r\nexplosion will blowout the cork or possibly break the bottle.\r\nCaution should be used to avoid being struck by pieces of flying\r\nglass if this experiment is tried, and under no condition should a\r\nlighted match or spark be brought near the end of the rubber hose\r\nD, as the presence of a little air in the generator will make an\r\nexplosive mixture which would probably break the jar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Gasoline Burner for Model Work [55]\r\n\r\nWhen making a small model traction engine or a locomotive the\r\nquestion arises, "What shall the fuel be?" If you have decided to\r\nuse gasoline, then a suitable burner is necessary. A piece of\r\nbrass tubing about 3 in. in diameter and 6 in. long with caps\r\nscrewed on both ends and fitted with a filling plug and a bicycle\r\nvalve makes a good gasoline supply tank, says the Model Engineer,\r\nLondon. The bicycle valve is used to give the tank an air pressure\r\nwhich forces the gasoline to the burner.\r\n\r\nThe burner is made from a piece of brass tube, A, as is shown in\r\nthe illustration, 1/2 in. in diameter and 2-1/2 in. long, which is\r\nplugged up at both ends, one end being drilled and reamed out to\r\n5/16 in. Three rows of holes 1/16 in. in diameter are drilled in\r\nthe brass tube. One row is drilled to come directly on top, and\r\nthe other two at about 45 degrees from the vertical. It is then\r\nfitted to a sheet steel base, B, by means of the clips, C C, Fig.\r\n1. A piece of 1/8-in. copper pipe, P, is then coiled around the\r\nbrass tube, A, which forms the vaporizing coil. This coil should\r\nhave a diameter\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gasoline Burner]\r\n\r\nof only 1 in. One end of the copper tube is bent around so it will\r\npoint directly into the reamed-out hole in the end of the brass\r\ntube, A. A nipple, N, is made by drilling a 1/8-in. hole halfway\r\nthrough a piece of brass and tapping to screw on the end of the\r\n1/8-in. copper pipe. A 1/64-in. hole is then drilled through the\r\nremaining part of the nipple. The other end of the copper tube is\r\nconnected to the supply tank. The distance between the nipple, N,\r\nand the ends of the tube, A, should be only 5/16 of an inch. Fig.\r\n2 shows the end view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Homemade Telephone Receiver [55]\r\n\r\nA telephone receiver that will do good work may be built very\r\ncheaply as follows: For the case use an ordinary 1/2-lb.\r\nbaking-powder box with a piece of heavy wire soldered on the\r\ninside, 1-5/16 in. from the bottom. For the magnet use a piece of\r\nround hardened steel about 3/8 in. in diameter and 1-1/4 in. long.\r\nIf desired, a piece of an old round file may be used for the\r\nmagnet core, which should be magnetized previous to assembling,\r\neither by passing a current of electricity around it, or by direct\r\ncontact with another magnet. The steel core should be wound with\r\nabout 250 ft. of No. 36 insulated wire, the ends of which should\r\nbe soldered to a piece of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Telephone Receiver]\r\n\r\nlamp cord, passed through a hole in the bottom of the can and\r\nknotted inside to prevent pulling out.\r\n\r\nA disk of thin sheet-iron, such as is used by photographers for\r\ntintypes (Ferrotype), should be cut to the diameter of the can,\r\ntaking care not to bend the iron. The magnet should then be placed\r\nin the bottom of the can in an upright position and enough of a\r\nmelted mixture of beeswax and resin poured in to hold it in\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nWhile the wax is still in a plastic condition the magnet should be\r\nlocated centrally and adjusted so that the end will be 1/16 in. or\r\nless below the level of the top of the copper ring.\r\n\r\nAfter the wax has hardened the disk is slipped in and fastened\r\ntightly by a ring of solder when the instrument is ready for use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Bind Magazines [56]\r\n\r\nAn easy way to bind Popular Mechanics in volumes of six months\r\neach is to arrange the magazines in order and tie them securely\r\nboth ways with a strong cord. It is well to put two or three\r\nsheets of tough white paper, cut to the size of the pages, at the\r\nfront and back for fly leaves.\r\n\r\nClamp the whole in a vise or clamp with two strips of wood even\r\nwith the back edges of the magazines. With a sharp saw cut a slit\r\nin the magazines and wood strips about 1/2 in. deep and slanting\r\nas shown at A and B, Fig. 1. Take two strips of stout cloth, about\r\n8 or 10 in. long and as wide as the distance between the bottoms\r\nof the sawed slits. Lay these over the back edge of the pack and\r\ntie securely through the slits with a string thread--wrapping and\r\ntying several times (C, Fig. 2).\r\n\r\nIf you have access to a printer\'s paper knife, trim both ends and\r\nthe front edge; this makes a much nicer book, but if the paper\r\nknife cannot be used, clamp the whole between two boards and saw\r\noff the edges, boards and all, smoothly, with a fine saw.\r\n\r\nCut four pieces of cardboard, 1/4 in. longer and 1/4 in. narrower\r\nthan the magazines after they have been trimmed. Lay one piece of\r\nthe board on the book and under the cloth strips. Use ordinary\r\nflour paste and paste the strips to the cardboard and then rub\r\npaste all over the top of the strips and the board. Rub paste over\r\none side of another piece of board and put it on top of the first\r\nboard and strips, pressing down firmly so that the strips are held\r\nsecurely between the two boards. Turn the book over and do the\r\nsame with the other two boards.\r\n\r\nAfter the paste has dried a few minutes take a piece of strong\r\ncloth, duck or linen, fold and cut it 1 in. larger all around than\r\nthe book, leaving the folded edge uncut. Rub paste over one of the\r\nboard backs and lay one end of the cloth on it, smoothing and\r\ncreasing as shown at A, Fig. 3. Turn the book over and paste the\r\nother side. The back edges should have a good coat of paste and a\r\nstrip of paper\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Process of Homemade Binding]\r\n\r\nthe width of the thickness of the pack pasted on before pasting\r\nthe cloth to the second board back.\r\n\r\nCut off the corners and fold over the edges of the cloth, pasting\r\nthem down (Fig. 4). Rub paste on one side of a fly leaf and press\r\nthe back down on it. Turn the book over and paste a fly leaf to\r\nthe other back after the edges of the cloth have been folded down.\r\nThe backs must not be opened until the fly leaves are thoroughly\r\ndry. Trim and tuck in the ends of the strip at the back edge.\r\n\r\nWhen fixed this way your magazines make one of the most valuable\r\nvolumes you can possibly add to your library of mechanical books.\r\n--Contributed by Joseph N. Parker, Bedford City, Va.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Homemade Acetylene-Gas Generator [57]\r\n\r\nA simple acetylene-gas generator used by myself for several years\r\nwhen\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Acetylene Gas Generator]\r\n\r\nout on camping trips was made of a galvanized iron tank, without a\r\nhead, 18 in. in diameter and 30 in. deep, B, as shown in the\r\nsketch. Another tank, A, is made the same depth as B, but its\r\ndiameter is a little smaller, so that inverted it will just slip\r\neasily into the tank B. In the bottom, or rather the top now, of\r\ntank A is cut a hole, and a little can, D, is fitted in it and\r\nsoldered. On top and over can D is soldered a large tin can screw.\r\nA rubber washer is fitted on this so that when the screw top, E,\r\nis turned on it, the joint will be gas tight. Another can, C,\r\nwhich will just slip inside the little can, is perforated with a\r\nnumber of holes. This can C is filled about half full of broken\r\npieces of carbide and then placed in the little can D. A gas cock,\r\nH, is soldered onto tank A, as shown, from which the gas may be\r\ntaken through a rubber tube. Fill tank B with water and set tank A\r\ninto it. This will cause some air to be enclosed, which can be\r\nreleased by leaving the cock open until tank A settles down to the\r\npoint where the water will begin to run in the perforations of the\r\nlittle tank. The water then comes in contact with the carbide and\r\nforms gas, which expands and stops the lowering of tank A. Then\r\nthe cock must be closed and tubing attached. It is dangerous to\r\nattempt to strike a match to light a jet or the end of the cock\r\nwhile air is escaping and just as the first gas is being made.\r\nWait until the tank is well raised up before doing this.\r\n--Contributed by James E. Noble, Toronto, Ont.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Homemade Annunciator [57]\r\n\r\nWhen one electric bell is operated from two push-buttons it is\r\nimpossible to tell which of the two push-buttons is being operated\r\nunless an annunciator or similar device is used. A very simple\r\nannunciator for indicating two numbers can be made from a small\r\nbox, Fig. 1, with an electric-bell magnet, A, fastened in the\r\nbottom. The armature, B, is pivoted in the center by means of a\r\nsmall piece of wire and has an indicator or hand, C, which moves\r\nto either right or left, depending on which half of the magnet is\r\nmagnetized. If the back armature, D, of the magnet is removed the\r\nmoving armature will work better, as this will prevent the\r\nmagnetism from acting on both ends of the armature.\r\n\r\nThe wiring diagram, Fig. 2, shows how the connections are to be\r\nmade. If the pushbutton A is closed; the bell will ring and the\r\npointer will point at 1,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Annuciator and Wiring Diagram]\r\n\r\nwhile the closing of the push-button B will ring the bell and move\r\nthe pointer to 2.\r\n--Contributed by H. S. Bott, Beverly, N. J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Box Kite [58]\r\n\r\nAs some of the readers of Amateur Mechanics may desire to build a\r\nbox kite, a simple method of constructing one of the modern type\r\nis given in detail as follows: The sticks should be made of\r\nstraight grained wood, which may be either spruce, basswood or\r\nwhite pine. The longitudinal corner spines, A A, should be 3/8 in.\r\nsquare by 42 in. long, and the four diagonal struts, B, should be\r\n1/4 in. by 1/2 in., and about 26 in. long. Two cloth bands should\r\nbe made to the exact dimensions given in the sketch and fastened\r\nto the four longitudinal sticks with 1 oz. tacks. It is well to\r\nmark the positions of the sticks on the cloth bands, either with a\r\nsoft lead-pencil or crayon, in order to have the four sides of\r\neach band exactly equal. The ends of the bands should be lapped\r\nover at least 1/2 in. and sewed double to give extra strength, and\r\nthe edges should be carefully hemmed, making the width, when\r\nfinished, exactly 12 in. Probably the best cloth for this purpose\r\nis nainsook, although lonsdale cambric or lightweight percaline\r\nwill answer nearly as well.\r\n\r\nThe diagonal struts, B, should be cut a little too long, so that\r\nthey will be slightly bowed when put in position, thus holding the\r\ncloth out taut and flat. They should be tied together at the\r\npoints of intersection and the ends should be wound with coarse\r\nharness maker\'s thread, as shown at C, to prevent splitting. The\r\nsmall guards, D, are nailed or glued to the longitudinal sticks to\r\nprevent the struts slipping out of position. Of course the ends of\r\nthe struts could be fastened to the longitudinal strips if\r\ndesired, but if made as described the kite may be readily taken\r\napart and rolled up for convenience in carrying.\r\n\r\nThe bridle knots, E, are shown in detail at H and J. H is a square\r\nknot, which may be easily loosened and\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Detail of Box Kite]\r\n\r\nshifted to a different position on the bridle, thus adjusting the\r\nlengths of F and G. A bowline knot should be tied at J, as shown,\r\nto prevent slipping. If the kite is used in a light wind, loosen\r\nthe square knot and shift nearer to G, thus shortening G and\r\nlengthening F, and if a strong wind is blowing, shift toward F,\r\nthereby lengthening G and making F shorter. In a very strong wind\r\ndo not use the bridle, but fasten a string securely to the stick\r\nat K.\r\n--Contributed by Edw. E.

A small quantity is rubbed well into the\r\ngrooves and on the edges of shutters, that refuse to slide easily,\r\nwith gratifying results. Care must be taken to allow no dust to\r\nsettle in the holders, however.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Simple Open-Circuit Telegraph Line [59]\r\n\r\nBy using the circuit shown in the sketch for short-distance\r\ntelegraph lines, the extra switches and wiring found in many\r\ncircuits are done away with. Closing either key will operate both\r\nsounders, and, as the resistance of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Simple Telegraph Line]\r\n\r\nthe sounders is very high, the batteries do not run down for a\r\nlong time.\r\n--Contributed by A. D. Stoddard, Clay Center, Kan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Thermo Battery [59]\r\n\r\nA thermo battery, for producing electricity direct from heat, can\r\nbe made of a wooden frame, A, with a number of nails, B, driven in\r\nthe vertical piece and connected in series with heavy copper\r\nwires, C. The connections should all be soldered to give good\r\nresults, as the voltage is\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Thermo Battery]\r\n\r\nvery low and the resistance of an unsoldered joint would stop the\r\ncurrent. The heat may be supplied by an alcohol lamp or other\r\ndevice, and the current may then be detected by means, of a simple\r\ngalvanometer consisting of a square spool of No. 14 or No. 16\r\nsingle-covered wire, E, with a pocket compass, F, placed on top.\r\nTurn the spool in a north and south direction, or parallel with\r\nthe compass needle. Then, when the nail heads are heated and the\r\ncircuit completed, the needle will swing around it at right angles\r\nto the coils of wire. Applying ice or cold water to the nail heads\r\nwill reverse the current.\r\n--Contributed by A. C. A., Chicago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Discharge a Toy Cannon by Electricity [59]\r\n\r\nA device for discharging a toy cannon by electricity can be easily\r\nmade by using three or four dry batteries, a switch and a small\r\ninduction coil\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Electrical Attachment for Discharging Toy Cannon]\r\n\r\ncapable of giving a 1/8-in. spark. Fasten a piece of wood, A, to\r\nthe cannon, by means of machine screws or, if there are no\r\ntrunnions on the cannon, the wood may be made in the shape of a\r\nring and slipped on over the muzzle. The fuse hole of the cannon\r\nis counterbored as shown and a small hole is drilled at one side\r\nto receive a small piece of copper wire, E. The wood screw, C,\r\nnearly touches E and is connected to one binding post of the\r\ninduction coil. The other binding post is connected with the wood\r\nscrew, D, which conducts the current into the cannon, and also\r\nholds the pieces of wood, A and B, in position.\r\n\r\nWhen the cannon is loaded, a small quantity of powder is placed in\r\nthe counterbore, and the spark between C and E ignites this and\r\ndischarges the cannon. A cannon may be fired from a distance in\r\nthis way, and as there is no danger of any spark remaining after\r\nthe current is shut off, it is safer than the ordinary cannon\r\nwhich is fired by means of a fuse.\r\n--Contributed by Henry Peck, Big Rapids, Mich.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Simple Electric Lock [60]\r\n\r\nThe illustration shows an automatic lock operated by electricity,\r\nrequiring a strong magnet, but no weights or strings, which\r\ngreatly simplifies the device over many others of the kind.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lock Operated by a Magnet]\r\n\r\nThe weight of the long arm, L, is just a trifle greater than the\r\ncombined weights of the short arms, A and S. The fulcrum of the\r\nlever is at C, where there is a staple. The lever swings on one\r\narm of the staple and the other arm is so placed that when the\r\nlever is in an upright position, with the long arm at L\', it will\r\nnot fall because of its greater weight but stays in the position\r\nshown. The purpose of this is to leave the short arm, A, when in\r\nposition at A\', within the reach of the magnet. Arm L rests on an\r\nL-shaped hook, H; in this position the door is locked.\r\n\r\nTo unlock the door, press the button, B. The momentum acquired\r\nfrom the magnet by the short arms, A and S, is sufficient to move\r\nthe long arm up to the position of L\'. To lock the door, press the\r\nbutton and the momentum acquired from the magnet by the short\r\narms, now at A\' and S\', is sufficient to move the long arm down\r\nfrom L\' to the position at L.\r\n--Contributed by Benjamin Kubelsky, Chicago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Direct-Connected Reverse for Small Motors [60]\r\n\r\nA simple reverse for small motors can be attached directly to the\r\nmotor as shown in Fig. 1. Fig. 2 shows the construction of the\r\nreverse block: A is a strip of walnut 5/8 in. square and 3/8 in.\r\nthick with strips of brass or copper (BB) attached as shown. Holes\r\n(CC) are drilled for the wire connections and they must be flush\r\nwith the surface of the block. A hole for a 1/2 in. screw is bored\r\nin the block.

The sketch shows two more\r\nthat may be added to the list. A and B are front and side views of\r\na lamp-screen, and C is a dumbbell. The lamp shade is particularly\r\nuseful for shading the eyes when reading or writing and, if\r\nenameled white on the concave side, makes an excellent reflector\r\nfor drawing at night, or for microscopic work.\r\n\r\nThe standard and base, consisting of an ordinary pipe flange\r\nbushed down to receive the upright nipple, are enameled a jet\r\nblack, and if the device is to be used on a polished table, a\r\npiece of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lamp Shade and Dumbbell]\r\n\r\nfelt should be glued to the bottom. A good way to hold the fan in\r\nthe nipple is to use a small wedge.\r\n\r\nThe dumbbells are made of short pieces of 3/4-in. pipe with\r\n1-2-in. couplings fastened to each end by pouring melted lead in\r\nthe space between the pipes and the couplings.

To attempt bending it\r\nwith the hands would result in breaking it unless a steady\r\npressure were applied for a long time. This peculiar property is\r\nalso found in ice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bending Cold Sealing-Wax]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Homemade Pottery Kiln [62]\r\n\r\nA small kiln for baking clay figures may be built at a cost of $1.\r\nThe following shows the general plan of such a kiln which has\r\nstood the test of 200 firings, and which is good for any work\r\nrequiring less than 1400\xc2\xb0 C.\r\n\r\nGet an iron pail about 1 ft. high by 1 ft. across, with a cover.\r\nAny old pail which is thick enough will do, while a new one will\r\ncost about 80 cents. In the bottom of this cut a 2-in. round hole\r\nand close it with a cork or wood plug, A, Fig. 1, which shall\r\nproject at least 2 in. inside the pail. Make a cylindrical core of\r\nwood, B, Fig. 1, 8 in. long and 8 in. across. Make a\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Homemade Pottery Kiln]\r\n\r\nmixture of clay, 60%; sand, 15%; and graphite, 25%, kneading\r\nthoroughly in water to a good molding consistency. Line the pail,\r\nbottom and sides, with heavy paper and cover the core with same.\r\nNow pack the bottom of the pail thoroughly with a 2-in. layer of\r\nthe clay mixture, and on it set the paper wrapped core, carefully\r\ncentering it. The 2 in. of space between the core and the sides of\r\nthe pail all around is to be filled with clay, C, as is shown in\r\nthe sketch, using a little at a time and packing it very tight. In\r\nlike manner make the cover of the kiln, cutting the hole a little\r\nsmaller, about 1 in. At the edge or rim of the cover encircle a\r\n2-in. strip of sheet iron, E, Fig. 2, to hold the clay mixture, C.\r\nSet aside for a few days until well dried.\r\n\r\nWhile these are drying you may be making a muffle, if there is to\r\nbe any glazing done. This is a clay cylinder (Fig. 3) with false\r\ntop and bottom, in which the pottery to be glazed is protected\r\nfrom any smoke or dust. It is placed inside the kiln, setting on\r\nany convenient blocks which will place it midway. The walls of the\r\nmuffle should be about 1/2 in. thick, and the dimensions should\r\nallow at least 1 in. of space all around for the passage of heat\r\nbetween it and the walls of the kiln. By the time the clay of the\r\nkiln is well dried, it will be found that it has all shrunk away\r\nfrom the iron about 3/8 in. After removing all the paper, pack\r\nthis space-top, bottom and sides with moist ground asbestos. If\r\nthe cover of the pail has no rim, it may be fastened to the\r\nasbestos and clay lining by punching a few holes, passing wire\r\nnails through and clinching them. Fit all the parts together\r\nsnugly, take out the plugs in the top and bottom, and your kiln is\r\nready for business. The handle of the pail will be convenient for\r\nmoving it about, and it can be set on three bricks or some more\r\nelaborate support, as dictated by fancy and expense.\r\n\r\nThe temperature required for baking earthenware is 1250\r\ndegrees--1310 degrees, C.,; hotel china, 1330 degrees; hard\r\nporcelain, 1390 degrees-1410 degrees. These temperatures can not\r\nbe obtained in the above kiln by means of the ordinary Bunsen\r\nburner. If will be necessary either to buy the largest size\r\nBunsen, or make one yourself, if you have the materials. If you\r\ncan get a cone which can be screwed into an inch pipe, file the\r\nopening of the cone to 1/16 in. diameter, and jacket the whole\r\nwith a 2-1/2-in. pipe. The flame end of this burner tube should be\r\nabout 4-1/2 in. above the cone opening and should be covered with\r\ngauze to prevent flame from snapping back. When lighted, the point\r\nof the blue flame, which is the hottest part, should be just in\r\nthe hole in the bottom of the kiln. Such a burner will be cheaply\r\nmade and will furnish a kiln temperature of 1400 degrees, but it\r\nwill burn a great deal of gas.\r\n\r\nA plumber\'s torch of medium size will cost more in the beginning,\r\nbut will be cheaper in operation. Whatever burner is used, the\r\nfiring should be gradual, and with especial caution the first\r\ntime. By experiment you will find that a higher temperature is\r\nobtained by placing a 1-in. pipe 2-ft. long over the lid hole as a\r\nchimney. It would be still more effective to get another iron\r\npail, 2 in. wider than the kiln, and get a down draft by inverting\r\nit over the kiln at whatever height proves most suitable. --G.

This done, make two wood ends, 1-1/4 by\r\n1-1/4 in. and 3/8 in. thick, and varnish. Bore holes in the center\r\nof each so the core will fit in snugly and leave about 1/4 in.\r\nprojecting from each end (Fig. 1).\r\n\r\nAfter finishing the core, shellac two layers of  thick paper over\r\nit between the ends; let this dry thoroughly. Wind two layers of\r\nbell magnet wire over this, allowing several inches of free wire\r\nto come through a hole in the end. Cover with paper and shellac as\r\nbefore. Wind about 1/8 in. of fine wire, such\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Medical Induction Coil]\r\n\r\nas used on telephone generators, around the coil, leaving long\r\nterminals.

Take the red cards, square them up and place\r\nin a vise. Then, with a plane, plane off the upper right hand\r\ncorner and lower left hand corner, as in Fig. 1, about 1/16 in.\r\n\r\nThen take the black cards, square them up, and plane off about\r\n1/16 in. on the upper left hand corner and lower right hand\r\ncorner, as in Fig. 2.\r\n\r\nNext restore all the cards to one pack, taking care to have the\r\nfirst card red, the next black, and so on, every alternate card\r\nbeing the same color. Bend the pack so as to give some spring to\r\nthe cards, and by holding one thumb on the upper left-hand corner\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Card Trick]\r\n\r\nall the cards will appear red to the audience; place thumb in the\r\ncenter at top of pack and they will appear mixed, red and black;\r\nwith thumb on upper right-hand corner all cards appear black. You\r\ncan display either color called for.\r\n--Contributed by Ralph Gingrich, Chicago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Rain Gauge [64]\r\n\r\nAn accurate rain gauge may be easily constructed from galvanized\r\niron, as shown in the sketch herewith. The funnel, A, overlaps and\r\nrests on the body, B, and discharges into the tube, C, the area of\r\nwhich is one-tenth that of the top of the funnel. The depth of the\r\nwater in C is thus ten times the actual rainfall, so that by\r\nmeasuring it with a stick marked off in tenths of an inch, we\r\nobtain the result in hundredths of an inch.\r\n\r\nA good size to make the rain gauge is as follows: A, 8 in.\r\ndiameter; C, 2.53 in. ; length of C, about 20 in. It should be\r\nplaced in an exposed location, so that no inaccuracy will occur\r\nfrom wind currents. To find the fall of snow, pour a known\r\nquantity\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rain Gauge]\r\n\r\nof warm water on the snow contained in the funnel and deduct the\r\nquantity poured in from the total amount in the tube.\r\n--Contributed by Thurston Hendrickson, Long Branch, N.J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make an Aquarium [64]\r\n\r\nIn making an aquarium, the first thing to decide on is the size.\r\nIt is well not to attempt building a very large one, as the\r\ndifficulties increase with the size. A good size is 12 by 12 by 20\r\nin., and this is inexpensive to build.\r\n\r\nFirst buy one length of 3/4 by 1/8-in. angle iron for the frame,\r\nF, Fig. 1. This can be obtained at any steel shop and should cost\r\nabout 20 cents. All the horizontal pieces, B, should be beveled 45\r\ndegrees at the ends and drilled for 3/16 in. stove bolts. The\r\nbeveling may be done by roughing out with a hacksaw and finishing\r\nwith a file. After all the pieces are cut and beveled they should\r\nbe drilled at the ends for the 3/16-in. stove bolts, C. Drill all\r\nthe horizontal pieces, B, first and then mark the holes on the\r\nupright pieces, A, through the holes already drilled, thus making\r\nall the holes coincide. Mark the ends of each piece with a figure\r\nor letter, so that when they are assembled, the same ends will\r\ncome together again. The upright pieces, A, should be countersunk\r\nas shown in the detail, and then the frame is ready to assemble.\r\n\r\nAfter the frame has been assembled take it to glazier and have a\r\nbottom made of skylight glass, and sides and ends of double-thick\r\nwindow glass. The bottom glass should be a good fit, but the sides\r\nand ends should be made slightly shorter to allow the cement, E,\r\nto form a dovetail joint as shown. When the glass is put in the\r\nframe a space, D, will be found between the glass and the\r\nhorizontal pieces, B, of the frame. If this were allowed to remain\r\nthe pressure of the water would spring the glass and cause a leak\r\nat E; so it is filled up with plaster of paris.\r\n\r\nThe cement, E, is made as follows: Take 1 gill of plaster of\r\nparis, 1 gill of litharge, 1 gill of fine white sand, and 1/3 of a\r\ngill of finely powdered rosin. Mix well and add boiled linseed oil\r\nand turpentine until as thick as putty. Let\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Detail of Aquarium Frame]\r\n\r\nthe cement dry three or four days before putting any water in the\r\naquarium.\r\n\r\nIn choosing stock for the aquarium it should be remembered that a\r\nsufficient quantity of vegetable life is required to furnish\r\noxygen for the fish. In a well balanced aquarium the water\r\nrequires renewal only two or three times a year. It is well to\r\nhave an excess of plants and a number of snails, as the snails\r\nwill devour all the decaying vegetable matter which would\r\notherwise poison the water and kill the fish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Aquarium Finished]\r\n\r\nIf desired, a centerpiece (A, Fig. 2) can be made of colored\r\nstones held together by cement, and an inverted jar can be\r\nsupported in the position shown at B. If the mouth of the jar is\r\nbelow the surface of the water it will stay filled and allow the\r\nfish to swim up inside as shown. Some washed pebbles or gravel\r\nshould be placed on the bottom, and, if desired, a few Chinese\r\nlilies or other plants may be placed on the centerpiece.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Homemade Pneumatic Lock [65]\r\n\r\nMount an old bicycle hand-pump, A, on the door by means of a metal\r\nplate, B, having a swinging connection at C. Fasten the lever, D,\r\nto the door knob, and make a hinge connection with the pump by\r\nmeans of a piece of sheet\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pneumatic Door-Opener]\r\n\r\nbrass, E, soldered to the end of the cylinder. All this apparatus\r\nis on the inside of the door and is connected by a small rubber\r\ntube, F, to a secret mouthpiece placed at some convenient\r\nlocation. A small piece of spring brass, screwed to the door\r\nframe, will open the door about 1/2 in. when the operator blows in\r\nthe mouthpiece, or if the door is within reach of the mouthpiece,\r\nthe operator may push the door at the same time that he blows,\r\nthus doing away with the spring, which is only used to keep the\r\ndoor from relocking.\r\n\r\nOne way of making the air connection with the outside is to bend\r\nthe tube F around and stick it through the keyhole. Few burglars\r\nwould ever think to blow in the keyhole.\r\n--Contributed by Orton E. White, Buffalo, N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Homemade Water Motor [66]\r\nBy MRS. PAUL S. WINTER\r\n\r\nIn these days of modern improvements, most houses are equipped\r\nwith a washing machine, and the question that arises in the mind\r\nof the householder is how to furnish the power to run it\r\neconomically. I referred this question to my husband, with the\r\nresult that he built a motor which proved so very satisfactory\r\nthat I prevailed upon him to give the readers of Amateur Mechanics\r\na description of it, hoping it may solve the same question for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nA motor of this type will develop about 1/2 hp. with a water\r\npressure of 70 lb. The power developed is correspondingly\r\nincreased or decreased as the pressure exceeds or falls below\r\nthis. In the latter case the power may be increased by using a\r\nsmaller pulley. Fig. 1 is the motor with one side removed, showing\r\nthe paddle-wheel in position; Fig. 2 is an end view; Fig. 3 shows\r\none of the paddles, and Fig. 4 shows the method of shaping the\r\npaddles. To make the frame, several lengths of scantling 3 in.\r\nwide by 1 in. thick (preferably of hard wood) are required. Cut\r\ntwo of them 4 ft. long, to form the main supports of the frame,\r\nAA, Fig. 1 ; another, 2 ft. 6 in. long, for the top, B, Fig. 1;\r\nanother, 26 in. long, to form the slanting part, C, Fig. 1; and\r\nanother, D, approximately 1 ft., according to the slant given C.\r\nAfter nailing these together as shown in the illustration, nail\r\ntwo short strips on each side of the outlet, as at E, to keep the\r\nframe from spreading.\r\n\r\nCut two pieces 30 in. long. Lay these on the sides of the frame\r\nwith their center lines along the line FF, which is 15 in. from\r\nthe outside top of the frame. They are shown in Fig. 2 at GG. Do\r\nnot fasten these boards now, but mark their position on the frame.\r\nTwo short boards 1 in. wide\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Detail of Homemade Waterwheel]\r\n\r\nby 1 in. thick (HH, Fig. 2) and another 1 in. by 1-1/2 in. (I,\r\nFig. 2) form a substantial base.\r\n\r\nCut the wheel from sheet iron 1/16 in. thick, 24 in. in diameter.\r\nThis can be done roughly with hammer and chisel and then smoothed\r\nup on an emery wheel, after which cut 24 radial slots 3/4 in. deep\r\non its circumference by means of a hacksaw. On each side of the\r\nwheel at the center fasten a rectangular piece of 1/4-in. iron 3\r\nby 4 in. and secure it to the wheel by means of four rivets; after\r\nwhich drill a 5/8 in. hole through the exact center of the wheel.\r\n\r\nCut 24 pieces of 1/32-in. iron, 1-1/2 by 2-1/2 in. These are the\r\npaddles. Shape them by placing one end over a section of 1-in.\r\npipe, and hammer bowl shaped with the peen of a hammer, as shown\r\nin Fig. 4. Then cut them into the shape shown in Fig. 3 and bend\r\nthe tapered end in along the lines JJ, after which place them in\r\nthe slots of the wheel and bend the sides over to clamp the wheel.\r\nDrill 1/8-in. holes through the wheel and sides of the paddles and\r\nrivet paddles in place. Next secure a 5/8-in. steel shaft 12 in.\r\nlong to the wheel about 8 in. from one end by means of a key. This\r\nis done by cutting a groove in the shaft and a corresponding\r\ngroove in the wheel and fitting in a piece of metal in order to\r\nsecure the wheel from turning independently of the shaft. Procure\r\ntwo collars or round pieces of brass (KK, Fig. 2) with a 5/8-in.\r\nhole through them, and fasten these to the shaft by means of set\r\nscrews to prevent it from moving lengthwise.\r\n\r\nMake the nozzle by taking a piece of 1/2-in. galvanized pipe 3-1/2\r\nin. long and filling it with babbitt metal; then drill a 3/16-in.\r\nhole through its center. Make this hole conical, tapering from\r\n3/16 in. to a full 1/2 in. This is best done by using a square\r\ntaper reamer. Then place the nozzle in the position shown in Fig.\r\n1, which allows the stream of water to strike the buckets full in\r\nthe center when they reach the position farthest to the right.\r\nTake the side pieces, GG, and drill a 1-in. hole through their\r\nsides centrally, and a 1/4-in. hole from the tops to the 1-in.\r\nholes. Fasten them in their proper position, with the wheel and\r\nshaft in place, the shaft projecting through the holes just\r\nmentioned. Now block the wheel; that is, fasten it by means of\r\nwedges or blocks of wood until the shaft is exactly in the center\r\nof the inch holes in the side pieces. Cut four disks of cardboard\r\nto slip over the shaft and large enough to cover the inch holes.\r\nTwo of these are to be inside and two outside of the frames (one\r\nto bear against each side of each crosspiece). Fasten these to the\r\ncrosspieces by means of tacks to hold them securely. Pour melted\r\nbabbitt metal into the 1/4-in. hole to form the bearings. When it\r\nhas cooled, remove the cardboard, take down the crosspieces, and\r\ndrill a 1/8-in. hole from the top of the crosspieces through the\r\nbabbitt for an oil-hole.\r\n\r\nSecure sufficient sheet zinc to cover the sides of the frame. Cut\r\nthe zinc to the same shape as the frame and let it extend down to\r\nthe crosspieces EE. Tack one side on. (It is well to tack strips\r\nof heavy cloth--burlap will do--along the edges under the zinc to\r\nform a water-tight joint.) Fasten the crosspiece over the zinc in\r\nits proper position. Drill a hole through the zinc, using the hole\r\nin the crosspiece as a guide. Then put the wheel in a central\r\nposition in the frame, tack the other side piece of zinc in place\r\nand put the other crosspiece in place. Place the two collars\r\nmentioned before on the shaft, and fasten so as to bear against\r\nthe crosspieces, in order to prevent the wheel and shaft from\r\nmoving sidewise. If the bearings are now oiled, the shaft should\r\nturn easily and smoothly. Fasten a pulley 4 or 6 in. in diameter\r\nto the longest arm of the shaft.\r\n\r\nConnect the nozzle to a water faucet by means of a piece of hose;\r\nplace the outlet over a drain, and belt the motor direct to the\r\nwashing-machine, sewing machine, ice-cream freezer, drill press,\r\ndynamo or any other machinery requiring not more than 1/2 hp.\r\n\r\nThis motor has been in use in our house for two years in all of\r\nthe above ways, and has never once failed to give perfect\r\nsatisfaction. It is obvious that, had the wheel and paddles been\r\nmade of brass, it would be more durable, but as it would have cost\r\nseveral times as much, it is a question whether it would be more\r\neconomical in the end. If sheet-iron is used, a coat of heavy\r\npaint would prevent rust and therefore prolong the life of the\r\nmotor. The motor will soon pay for itself in the saving of laundry\r\nbills. We used to spend $1 a month to have just my husband\'s\r\noveralls done at the laundry, but now I put them in the machine,\r\nstart the motor, and leave them for an hour or so. At the end of\r\nthis time they are perfectly clean, and I have noticed that they\r\nwear twice as long as when I sent them to the laundry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make Silhouettes [68]\r\n\r\nPhotography in all branches is truly a most absorbing occupation.\r\nEach of us who has a camera is constantly experimenting, and\r\neveryone of us is delighted when something new is suggested for\r\nsuch experiments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Making a Silhouette with the Camera]\r\n\r\nTo use a camera in making silhouettes select a window facing north\r\nif possible, or if used only at times when the sun is not on it,\r\nany window will do, says the Photographic Times. Raise the window\r\nshade half way, remove any white curtains there may be, and in the\r\ncenter of the lower pane of glass paste by the four corners a\r\nsheet of tissue paper that is perfectly smooth and quite thick, as\r\nshown in the sketch at B. Darken the rest of the window, shutting\r\nout all light from above and the sides. Place a chair so that\r\nafter being seated the head of the subject will come before the\r\ncenter of the tissue paper, and as near to it as possible, and\r\nwhen looking straight before him his face will be in clear profile\r\nto the camera.\r\n\r\nDraw the shades of all other windows in the room. Focus the camera\r\ncarefully, getting a sharp outline of the profile on the screen.\r\nDo not stop down the lens, as this makes long exposure necessary,\r\nand the subject may move. Correct exposure depends, of course, on\r\nthe lens, light and the plate. But remember that a black and white\r\nnegative is wanted with as little detail in the features as\r\npossible. The best plate to use is a very slow one, or what is\r\ncalled a process plate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sample Silhouette]\r\n\r\nIn developing get all possible density in the high lights, without\r\ndetail in the face, and without fog. Printing is best done on\r\ncontrasty development paper with developer not too strong.\r\n\r\nThe ideal silhouette print is a perfectly black profile on a white\r\nground. With a piece of black paper, any shape in stopping off\r\nprint may be made as shown at C in the sketch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Galvanoscope [68]\r\n\r\nA galvanoscope for detecting small currents of electricity can be\r\nmade from a coil of wire, A; a glass tube, B, full of water; a\r\ncore, C; and a base, D, with binding posts as shown. The core C,\r\nwhich is made of iron and cork, is a trifle lighter than the water\r\nit displaces and will therefore normally remain in the top of the\r\ntube; but as soon as a current of electricity passes through the\r\ncoil, the core is drawn down out of sight. The current required is\r\nvery small, as the core is so nearly balanced that the least\r\nattraction will cause it to sink.\r\n\r\nThe glass tube may be a test tube, as shown in Fig. 2, or an empty\r\ndeveloper tube. If one has neither a test tube nor developer tube,\r\nan empty pill bottle may be used. The washers at the ends of the\r\ncoil can be made of fiber, hard rubber, or wood; or can be taken\r\nfrom an old magnet. The base may be made of wood or any other\r\ninsulating material and should have four short legs on the bottom.\r\nMake the coil of single-covered wire about No. 18 and connect ends\r\nto binding posts as shown in Fig. 2.\r\n\r\nThe core is made by pushing a small nail through a piece of cork.\r\nIt should be made so that it will rise slowly when placed under\r\nwater. Some filing may be necessary to get the weight just right,\r\nbut it should be remembered that the buoyancy of the core can be\r\nadjusted after the parts are assembled, by pressing the cork in\r\nthe bottom of the test tube. This causes compression in the water\r\nso that some is forced into the upper cork, reducing its\r\ndisplacement and causing it to sink. The lower cork is then slowly\r\nwithdrawn, by twisting, until the core slowly rises.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Galvanoscope]\r\n\r\nThe instrument will then be adjusted ready for use. Connect the\r\nbinding posts to a single cell of battery--any kind will do, as a\r\nslight current will answer. On completing\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Interior View]\r\n\r\nthe circuit the core will descend; or put in a switch or push\r\nbutton on one of the battery wires. If the button be concealed\r\nwhere the operator can reach it, the core will obey his command to\r\nrise or fall, according to his control of the current. This is a\r\nmysterious looking instrument, the core being moved without\r\nvisible connection to any other part.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Lubricating Sheet Metal [69]\r\n\r\nTo lubricate sheet metal mix 1 qt. whale oil, 1 lb. white lead, 1\r\npt. water and 3 oz. finest graphite. Apply with a brush before the\r\nmetal enters the dies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** An Optical Top [69]\r\n\r\nOne of the latest optical delusions, and one not easy to explain,\r\nis Benham\'s color top. Cut out the black and white disk shown in\r\nthe figure, and paste on a piece of stiff cardboard. Trim the\r\nedges of the cardboard to match the shape of the disk, and make a\r\npinhole in the center. Cut the pin in half and push it through\r\nfrom the under side until the head of the pin touches the\r\ncardboard. Spin slowly in a strong light and some of the lines\r\nwill appear colored. The colors appear different to different\r\npeople, and are changed by reversing the rotation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An Optical Top]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Card Trick with a Tapered Deck [70]\r\n\r\nAnother simple trick to perform but one not easily detected, is\r\nexecuted by using a tapered deck of cards as shown in Fig. 1. A\r\ncheap deck of cards is evened up square, fastened in a vise and\r\nplaned along the edge in such a manner that all the pack will be\r\ntapered about 1/16 in. This taper is exaggerated in the\r\nillustration which shows\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cards from a Tapered Deck]\r\n\r\none card that has been turned end for end.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that any card reversed in this way can be easily\r\nseparated from the other cards in the pack, which makes it\r\npossible to perform the following trick: The performer spreads the\r\ncards out, fan-like, and asks an observer to withdraw a card,\r\nwhich is then replaced in any part of the pack. After thoroughly\r\nshuffling the cards the performer then holds the deck in both\r\nhands behind his back and pronouncing a few magic words, produces\r\nthe card selected in one hand and the rest of the pack in the\r\nother. This is accomplished by simply turning the deck end for end\r\nwhile the observer is looking at his card, thus bringing the wide\r\nend of the selected card at the narrow end of the pack when it is\r\nreplaced. The hands are placed behind the pack for a double\r\npurpose, as the feat then seems more marvelous and the observers\r\nare not allowed to see how it is done.\r\n\r\nIn prize games, players having the same score are frequently\r\ncalled upon to cut for low to determine which shall be the winner,\r\nbut a fairer way is to cut for high as a person familiar with the\r\ntrick shown in Fig. 2 can cut the cards at the ace, deuce, or\r\nthree spot, nearly every time, especially if the deck is a new\r\none. This is done by simply pressing on the top of the deck as\r\nshown, before cutting, thus causing the increased ink surface of\r\nthe high cards to adhere to the adjacent ones. A little practice\r\nwill soon enable one to cut low nearly every time, but the cards\r\nmust be grasped lightly and the experiment should be performed\r\nwith a new deck to obtain successful results.\r\n--Contributed by D.B.L., Chicago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Constant-Pressure Hydrogen Generator [70]\r\n\r\nBy fitting three bottles, A, B, C, with rubber stoppers and\r\nconnecting with glass tubes as shown in the sketch, hydrogen or\r\nother gases produced in a similar manner may be generated under\r\nconstant pressure. In making hydrogen, bottle B is partly filled\r\nwith zinc nodules formed by slowly pouring melted zinc into water.\r\nHydrochloric acid is then poured in the small funnel, thus partly\r\nfilling bottles A and C. When the acid rising from C comes in\r\ncontact with the zinc, hydrogen gas is generated and fills bottle\r\nB. The gas continues to generate until the pressure is sufficient\r\nto force the acid back down the tube into bottle C, when the\r\naction ceases. As fast as the gas is used the acid rises in the\r\ntube and generates more, thus keeping the pressure nearly\r\nconstant, the pressure depending on the difference between the\r\nlevels of the acid in bottle A and bottle B. As this device is\r\neasily upset, a ring-stand should be used to prevent its being\r\nbroken, or if it is to be a permanent apparatus it may be mounted\r\non a substantial wooden base. This apparatus may also be used for\r\npreparing acetylene gas or almost any gas which requires a mixture\r\nof a solid and liquid in its preparation.\r\n--Contributed by C. S.

Form a\r\ncone of heavy paper, 9 in. long and 3 in. in diameter, at the\r\nlarger end with the smaller end to fit the diameter of the tube A,\r\nmaking it three-ply thick and gluing the layers together. Attach\r\nthis cone on the tube A where the thread has been wrapped with\r\nglue, as shown in Fig. 2. Fig. 2 is also an enlarged sketch. Make\r\nten pieces about 1 ft. 10 in. in length and 3 in. wide from the\r\nthin boards of a biscuit or cracker box. Cut an arc of a circle in\r\nthem on a radius of 2 ft. (Fig. 3).

The axle on which the pointer revolves consists of a\r\npiece of round wood, about the size of a lead-pencil, with a pin\r\ndriven in each end. A piece of tin, E, is cut V-shaped at each end\r\nand bent up at the ends to form bearings for the pins. The silk\r\nthread C is fastened to the wooden axle and is wrapped one or two\r\nturns around it, so that when\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Hygrometer]\r\n\r\nthe thread is pulled the pointer will move on the scale. It will\r\nbe noticed that the thread B is not perfectly straight, but bends\r\ntoward D. For this reason a very small shrinkage of B, such as\r\noccurs when the atmosphere is dry, will cause an increased\r\nmovement of C, which will be further increased in the movement of\r\nthe pointer. An instrument of this kind is very interesting and\r\ncosts nothing to make.\r\n--Contributed by Reader, Denver.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** The Protection of a Spring Lock [72]\r\n\r\nAfter shutting the front door and hearing the spring lock snap\r\ninto its socket, most people go off with a childlike faith in the\r\nsafety of their goods and chattels. But the cold fact is that\r\nthere is scarcely any locking device which affords less protection\r\nthan the ordinary spring lock. It is the simplest thing in the\r\nworld for a sneak thief to slip a thin knife between the\r\ndoor-casing and the strip, push back the bolt, and walk in.\r\n\r\nFortunately, it is equally easy to block that trick. Take a narrow\r\npiece of tin 3 or 4 in. long, bend it at right angles throughout\r\nits length, and tack it firmly in the angle between the casing and\r\nstrip, so as to make it impossible to reach the bolt without\r\ntearing off the strip.\r\n\r\nAnother way is to drive nails through the strip at intervals of\r\nhalf an inch, enough to protect the bolt from being meddled with.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Controller and Reverse for a Battery Motor [72]\r\n\r\nSecure a cigar or starch box and use to make the base, B. Two\r\nwood-base switches, S S, are cut off a little past the center and\r\nfastened to the base with a piece of wood between them. The upper\r\nswitch, S, is connected to different equal points on a coil of\r\nwire, W, while the lower switch, S, is connected each point to a\r\nbattery, as shown. The reverse switch, R, is made from two brass\r\nor copper strips fastened at the top to the base with screws and\r\njoined together by a piece of hard rubber or wood with a small\r\nhandle attached. Connect wires A to the armature and wires F to\r\nthe field of the motor. By this arrangement one, two or three and\r\nso on up until all the battery cells are used and different points\r\nof resistance secured on the coil of wire. The reverse lever when\r\nmoved from right to left, or left to right, changes the direction\r\nof the armature in the motor from one way to the other.\r\n--Contributed by J.

The\r\nsteam chest D, is part of the piston tube of the same pump, the\r\nother parts being used for the bearing B, and the crank bearing C.\r\nThe flywheel Q can be any small-sized iron wheel; either an old\r\nsewing-machine wheel, pulley wheel, or anything available. We used\r\na wheel from an old high chair for our engine. If the bore in the\r\nwheel is too large for the shaft, it may be bushed with a piece of\r\nhard wood. The shaft is made of heavy steel wire, the size of the\r\nhole in the bearing B.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Valve Motion and Construction of Piston]\r\n\r\nThe base is made of wood, and has two wood blocks, H and K, 3/8\r\nin. thick, to support bearing B, and valve crank S, which is made\r\nof tin. The hose E connects to the boiler, which will be described\r\nlater. The clips FF are soldered to the cylinder and nailed to the\r\nbase, and the bearing B is fastened by staples.\r\n\r\nThe valve motion is shown in Figs. 2 and 3. In Fig. 2 the steam is\r\nentering the cylinder, and in Fig. 3 the valve B has closed the\r\nsteam inlet and opened the exhaust, thus allowing the steam in the\r\ncylinder to escape.\r\n\r\nThe piston is made of a stove bolt, E, Fig. 2, with two washers,\r\nFF, and a cylindrical piece of hard wood, G. This is wound with\r\nsoft string, as shown in Fig. 3, and saturated with thick oil. A\r\nslot is cut in the end of the bolt E, to receive the connecting\r\nrod H. The valve B is made of an old bicycle spoke, C, with the\r\nnut cut in half and filed down as shown, the space between the two\r\nhalves being filled with string and oiled.\r\n\r\nThe valve crank S, Fig. 1, is cut out of tin, or galvanized iron,\r\nand is moved by a small crank on the shaft. This crank should be\r\nat right angles to the main crank.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Engine in Operation]\r\n\r\nThe boiler, Fig. 4, can be an old oil can, powder can, or a syrup\r\ncan with a tube soldered to it, and is connected to the engine by\r\na piece of rubber tubing. The heat from a small gas stove will\r\nfurnish steam fast enough to run the engine at high speed. This\r\nengine was built by W. G. Schuh and A. J.

Let the exposure be just long enough to show the figure\r\ndistinctly. Then place an empty bottle against a dark background\r\nand focus so as to have the outlines of the bottle enclose those\r\nof the man. Let this exposure be about twice the length of the\r\nfirst, and the desired result is obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Musical Windmill [74]\r\n\r\nMake two wheels out of tin. They may be of any size, but wheel A\r\nmust be larger than wheel B. On wheel A fasten two pieces of wood,\r\nC, to cross in the center, and place a bell on the four ends, as\r\nshown. The smaller wheel, B, must be separated from the other with\r\na round piece of wood or an old spool. Tie four buttons with split\r\nrings to the smaller wheel, B. The blades on the wheels should be\r\nbent opposite on one wheel from the others so as to make the\r\nwheels turn in different directions. When turning, the buttons\r\nwill strike the bells and make them ring constantly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Musical Windmill]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Optical Illusions [74]\r\n\r\nBy giving the page a revolving or rinsing motion the three\r\ncircular figures printed on the next page appear to rotate.

Fig. 1 then appears to rotate in the same\r\ndirection as the revolution; Fig. 2 appears to revolve in the\r\nopposite direction, and Fig. 3 appears to revolve sometimes in the\r\nsame direction and at other times in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nA curious effect can be produced with Fig. 1 by covering up Figs.\r\n2 and 3 with a piece of plain paper and laying a coin or other\r\nsmall object on the paper.

The experiment will\r\n\r\n[Illustration: To Make a Telephone Sing]\r\n\r\nwork well on most telephones, but not on all.\r\n\r\nWhen the receiver is placed in the position shown it acts like an\r\nordinary buzzer, and the function of the transmitter will then be\r\nthat of an interrupter. The slightest movement of the transmitter\r\ndiaphragm will cause an increased movement of the receiver\r\ndiaphragm. This in turn will act on the transmitter, thus setting\r\nup sympathetic vibrations between the two, which accounts for the\r\nsound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Microscope Without a Lens [76]\r\nBy E. W. DAVIS\r\n\r\nNearly everyone has heard of the pin-hole camera, but the fact\r\nthat the same principle can be used to make a microscope, having a\r\nmagnifying power of 8 diameters (64 times) will perhaps be new to\r\nsome readers. To make this lensless microscope, procure a wooden\r\nspool, A (a short spool, say 1/2 or 3/4 in. long, produces a\r\nhigher magnifying power), and enlarge the bore a little at one\r\nend. Then blacken the inside with india ink and allow to dry. From\r\na piece of thin\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Detail of Lensless Microscope]\r\n\r\ntransparent celluloid or mica, cut out a small disk, B, and fasten\r\nto the end having the enlarged bore, by means of brads. On the\r\nother end glue a piece of thin black cardboard, C, and at the\r\ncenter, D, make a small hole with the point of a fine needle. It\r\nis very important that the hole D should be very small, otherwise\r\nthe image will be blurred.\r\n\r\nTo use this microscope, place a small object on the transparent\r\ndisk, which may be moistened to make the object adhere, and look\r\nthrough the hole D. It is necessary to have a strong light to get\r\ngood results and, as in all microscopes of any power, the object\r\nshould be of a transparent nature.\r\n\r\nThe principle on which this instrument works is illustrated in\r\nFig. 2. The apparent diameter of an object is inversely\r\nproportional to its distance from the eye, i. e., if the distance\r\nis reduced to one-half, the diameter will appear twice as large;\r\nif the distance is reduced to one-third, the diameter will appear\r\nthree times as large, and so on. As the nearest distance at which\r\nthe average person can see an object clearly is about 6 in., it\r\nfollows that the diameter of an object 3/4 in. from the eye would\r\nappear 8 times the normal size. The object would then be magnified\r\n8 diameters, or 64 times. (The area would appear 64 times as\r\nlarge.) But an object 3/4-in. from the eye appears so blurred that\r\nnone of the details are discernible, and it is for this reason\r\nthat the pin-hole is employed.\r\n\r\nViewed through this microscope, a fly\'s wing appears as large as a\r\nperson\'s hand, held at arm\'s length, and has the general\r\nappearance shown in Fig. 3. The mother of vinegar examined in the\r\nsame way is seen to be swarming with a mass of wriggling little\r\nworms, and may possibly cause the observer to abstain from all\r\nsalads forever after. An innocent-looking drop of water, in which\r\nhay has been soaking for several days, reveals hundreds of little\r\ninfusoria, darting across the field in every direction. These and\r\nhundreds of other interesting objects may be observed in this\r\nlittle instrument, which costs little or nothing to make.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Telegraph Key and Sounder [76]\r\n\r\nThe sounder, Fig. 1, is made from an old electric-bell magnet, D,\r\nfastened to a wooden base. The lever, A, can be made of brass and\r\nthe armature, C, is made of iron. The pivot, E, is made from a\r\nwire nail and is soldered to A. It should be filed to a point at\r\neach end so as to move freely in the bearings, B, which are pieces\r\nof hard wood. The spring, H, is fastened at each end by pins, bent\r\nas shown, and should not be too strong or the magnet will be\r\nunable to move the armature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SOUNDER-A. brass: B. wood: C. soft iron; DD. coils\r\nwound with No. 26 wire: E. nail soldered on A; FF. binding posts:\r\nH spring]\r\n\r\nThe stop, K, is a wire nail driven deep enough in the base to\r\nleave about 1/8 in. between the armature and the magnet. The\r\nbinding posts, F, may be taken from old dry batteries and are\r\nconnected to the two wires from the magnet by wires run in grooves\r\ncut in the base.\r\n\r\nThe base of the key, Fig. 2, is also made of wood and has two\r\nwooden bearings, E, which are made to receive a pivot, similar to\r\nthe one used in the sounder. The lever of the key is made of brass\r\nand has a hardwood knob, A, fastened near the end. A switch, D,\r\nconnects with the pivot at F and can be either made from sheet\r\nbrass, or taken from a small one-point switch. The binding posts\r\nare like those of the sounder, and are connected to the contacts,\r\nK, by wires run in grooves cut in the wood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KEY-A. wood; B. brass or iron soldered to nail; C.\r\nbrass; D. brass: E. wood: F. connection of D to nail; HH. binding\r\nposts]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Music Cabinet [77]\r\n\r\nA neat music cabinet can be made as shown in the accompanying\r\nsketch. Each side, AA, Fig. 1, is cut from a board about 36 in. in\r\nlength and 16 in. wide. Both are alike and can be cut from the\r\nsame pattern. As the front legs curve out a little the main body\r\nof the boards AA should be 15 in. wide. The back, B, should be\r\nabout 22 in. long by 16 in. wide and set in between sides AA. Cut\r\nthe top, C, 16 in. long and 14-1/2 in. wide.

The brass tube may be an\r\nold bicycle hand pump, A (see sketch), filled with water. Pushing\r\nthe wire, B, down into the water increases the surface in contact,\r\nand thus decreases the resistance. An apparatus of this kind is\r\nsuitable for regulating the current from an induction coil, when\r\nthe coil is not provided with a regulator, and by using a piece of\r\npipe instead of the tube, it can be used to regulate the speed of\r\na motor.\r\n\r\nWhen the pipe is used, a piece of brass or copper rod should be\r\nsubstituted for the wire, in order to increase the surface. Adding\r\nsalt to the water will decrease the resistance, and, when used\r\nwith a motor, will give a greater speed.\r\n--Contributed by John Koehler, Ridgewood, N.

A\r\nfairly stiff spring, A, is connected by a flexible wire cord to\r\nthe knob B. The cord is also fastened to a lever, C, which is\r\npivoted at D and is released by a magnetic trigger, E, made from\r\nthe armature and magnet of an old electric bell.\r\n\r\nWhen the circuit is completed by means of a secret contact device\r\noutside the door, the magnet, F, pulls down the armature, which\r\nreleases the trigger and allows the spring to open the lock. If\r\nthere are metal numbers on the outside of the door they may be\r\nused for the secret contact, if desired,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Apparatus Placed on Inside of Door]\r\n\r\nbut if there are no numbers on the door, a small contact-board may\r\nbe constructed by driving about 12 brass headed tacks into a thin\r\npiece of wood and making connections at the back as shown in the\r\nwiring diagram.\r\n\r\nIn this particular diagram the tacks numbered 1 and 7 are used for\r\nunlocking the door, the others being connected with the\r\nelectric-bell circuit as indicated, for the purpose of giving an\r\nalarm should anybody try to experiment with the secret contacts.\r\nBy means of a pocket knife or other metal article the operator can\r\nlet himself in at any time by connecting the tacks numbered 1 and\r\n7, while a person not knowing the combination would be liable to\r\nsound the alarm.

Notice\r\nthe break (S) in the track; this is necessary in order to place in\r\nposition the piece holding the wheels.\r\n\r\nFig. 4 shows the wheel-holder, B. Make it of hard wood 3-1/8 in.\r\nlong, 1 in. wide and a little less than 7/8 in. thick, so that it\r\nwill run freely between the sides (Fig. 5) when they are placed.\r\nCut two grooves, one in each end, 1 in. deep and 1/2 in. wide. In\r\nthese grooves place wheels, CC, to turn on pins of stout wire.\r\nThese wheels should be 3/4 in. in diameter. When placed in the\r\nholder their centers must be exactly 2 in. apart, or so arranged\r\nthat the distance between the edge of the wheels and the track (K,\r\nFig. 1) is equal to the thickness of the tubing when pressed flat.\r\nIf the wheels fit too tightly, they will bind; it too loose, they\r\nwill let the air through. Bore a hole through the middle of the\r\nwheel-holder and insert the crankpin, D, which should be about 1/2\r\nin. in diameter. The crankpin should fit tightly; if necessary\r\ndrive a brad through to keep it from slipping.\r\n\r\nIn the sides (Fig. 5) bore a hole in the center of the crankpin to\r\nrun in loosely. Now put all these parts together, as shown in the\r\nillustration. Do not fasten the sides too securely until you have\r\ntried the device and are sure it will run smoothly. For the crank\r\na bent piece of stout wire or a nail will serve, though a small\r\niron wheel is better, as it gives steadiness to the motion. In\r\nthis case a handle must be attached to the rim of the wheel to\r\nserve as a crank. The drive wheel from a broken-down eggbeater\r\nwill do nicely. For ease in handling the pump, a platform should\r\nbe added.\r\n\r\nTo use the pump, fill the tube with water and place the lower end\r\nof the tube in a reservoir of water. Make a nozzle of the end of a\r\nclay pipe stem for the other end of the tube. Then turn the crank\r\nfrom left to right. The first wheel presses the air out of the\r\ntube, creating a vacuum which is immediately filled with water.\r\nBefore the first wheel releases the tube at the top, the other\r\nwheel has reached the bottom, this time pressing along the water\r\nthat was brought up by the first wheel. If the motion of the\r\nwheels is regular, the pump will give a steady stream. Two feet of\r\n1/4-in. tubing, costing 10 cents, is all the expense necessary.\r\n--Contributed by Dan H.

The screen which is\r\nshown in Fig. 1, stands 20 in. high from the base to the top\r\ncrosspiece and is made of 3/4 by 1/4-in. and 1/2 by 1/4-in. iron.\r\nThe top and bottom pieces marked AA, Fig. 1, are 3/4 by 1/4 in.\r\nand are 30 in. long, bent at an angle to fit the fireplace 7 in.\r\nfrom each end, as shown in Fig. 2. The three legs marked BBB, Fig.\r\n1, are of the same size iron and each leg will take 34 in. of\r\nmaterial. In shaping the feet of these three pieces give them a\r\nslight tendency to lean toward the fire or inside of screen, says\r\na correspondent in the Blacksmith and Wheelwright. In the two\r\ncross bars 1 in. from each end, A in Fig. 2, mark for hole and 3\r\nin. from that mark the next hole. Take the center of the bar, B,\r\n15 in. from each end, and mark for a hole, and 3-1/2 in. on each\r\nside mark again and 3-1/2 in. beyond each of these two, mark\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nMark the legs 2-3/4 in. from the bottom and 2 in. from the top and\r\nafter making rivet-holes rivet them to the cross bars, AA, Fig. 1.\r\n\r\nCut six pieces, 17-1/2 in. long and punch holes to fit and rivet\r\nonto the remaining holes in cross bars, AA, Fig. 1. Clean it up\r\nand give it a coat of black Japan or dead black.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Trap for Small Animals [82]\r\n\r\nThis is a box trap with glass sides and back, the panes of glass\r\nbeing held in place by brads placed on both sides. The animal does\r\nnot fear to enter the box, because he can see through it: when he\r\nenters, however, and touches the bait the lid is released and,\r\ndropping, shuts him in. This is one of the easiest traps to build\r\nand is usually successful.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Trap]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Homemade Grenet Battery [83]\r\n\r\nProcure an ordinary carbon-zinc, sal-ammoniac battery and remove\r\nthe zinc rod. If the battery has been used before, it is better to\r\nsoak the carbon cylinder for a few hours to remove any remaining\r\ncrystals of sal-ammoniac from its pores.\r\n\r\nThe truncated, conical zinc required is known as a fuller\'s zinc\r\nand can be bought at any electrical supply dealer\'s, or, it may be\r\ncast in a sand mold from scrap zinc or the worn-out zinc rods from\r\nsal-ammoniac batteries. It should be cast on the end of a piece of\r\nNo. 14 copper wire. Amalgamation is not necessary for the zinc one\r\nbuys, but if one casts his own zinc, it is necessary to amalgamate\r\nit or coat it with mercury. This may be done as follows:\r\n\r\nDip a piece of rag in a diluted solution of sulphuric acid (water\r\n16 parts, acid 1 part); rub the zinc well, at the same time\r\nallowing a few drops of mercury to fall on a spot attacked by the\r\nacid. The mercury will adhere, and if the rubbing is continued so\r\nas to spread the mercury, it will cover the entire surface of the\r\nzinc, giving it a bright, silvery appearance.\r\n\r\nNext procure what is known as a wire connector. This is a piece of\r\ncopper tube about 1-1/2 in. long having two thumb screws, one on\r\neach end on opposite sides (Fig. 2). The upper screw is to connect\r\nthe battery wire, the lower one to raise and lower the zinc. The\r\nbattery is now complete, and the solution (Fig. 1) must be\r\nprepared. Proceed as follows:\r\n\r\nIn 32 oz. of water dissolve 4 oz. potassium bichromate. When the\r\nbichromate has all dissolved, add slowly, stirring constantly, 4\r\noz. sulphuric acid. Do not add the acid too quickly or the heat\r\ngenerated may break the vessel containing the solution. Then pour\r\nthe solution into the battery jar, until it is within 3 in. of the\r\ntop. Thread the wire holding the zinc through the porcelain\r\ninsulator of the carbon cylinder and also through the wire\r\nconnector. Pull the zinc up as far as it will go and tighten the\r\nlower thumb screw so that it holds the wire secure. Place the\r\ncarbon in the jar. If the solution touches the zinc, some of it\r\nshould be poured out. To determine whether or not the zinc is\r\ntouched by the solution, take out the carbon and lower the zinc.\r\nIf it is wet, there is too much liquid in the jar. The battery is\r\nnow ready for use.\r\n\r\nTo cause a flow of electricity, lower the zinc until it almost\r\ntouches the bottom of the jar and connect an electric bell or\r\nother electrical apparatus by means of wires to the two binding\r\nposts.\r\n\r\nThis battery when first set up gives a current of about two volts.\r\nIt is useful for running induction coils, or small electric\r\nmotors. When through using the battery, raise the zinc and tighten\r\nthe lower thumb screw. This prevents the zinc wasting away when no\r\ncurrent is being used.\r\n--Contributed by H. C. Meyer, Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig.1 Details of Homemade Battery]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Door-Opener for Furnace [83]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying diagram shows an arrangement to open the coal\r\ndoor of a furnace. When approaching the furnace with a shovelful\r\nof coal it is usually necessary to rest the shovel on the top of\r\nthe ash door, while the coal door is being opened. With my device\r\nit is only necessary to press the foot pedal, which opens the\r\ndoor. After putting in the coal, pressing the pedal closes the\r\ndoor. The pulley in the ceiling must be placed a little in front\r\nof the door, in order to throw the door open after lifting it from\r\nthe catch. A large gate hinge is used to hold the pedal to the\r\nfloor.\r\n--Contributed by Edward Whitney, Madison, Wis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Furnace Door Opener]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make an Efficient Wireless Telegraph [84]\r\nBy GEORGE W. RICHARDSON\r\n\r\nA simple but very efficient wireless telegraph may be constructed\r\nat slight cost from the following description:\r\n\r\nThe sending apparatus consists of nothing but an induction coil\r\nwith a telegraph key inserted in the primary circuit, i. e., the\r\nbattery circuit. This apparatus may be purchased from any\r\nelectrical-supply house. The price of the coil depends upon its\r\nsize, and upon the size depends the distance signals can be\r\ntransmitted. If, however, one wishes to construct his own coil he\r\ncan make and use, with slight changes, the jump-spark coil\r\ndescribed elsewhere in this book. This coil, being a 1-in. coil,\r\nwill transmit nicely up to a distance of one mile; while a 12-in.\r\ncoil made on the same plan will transmit 20 miles or even more\r\nunder favorable conditions.\r\n\r\nChange the coil described, as follows: Insert an ordinary\r\ntelegraph key in the battery circuit, and attach two small pieces\r\nof wire with a brass ball on each, by inserting them in the\r\nbinding-posts of the coil as shown at B B". Of these two terminal\r\nwires one is grounded to earth, while the other wire is sent aloft\r\nand is called the aerial line. This constitutes all there is to\r\nthe sending apparatus.\r\n\r\nNow for the receiving apparatus. In the earlier receiving\r\ninstruments a coherer was used, consisting of a glass tube about\r\n1/8-in. diameter, in which were two silver pistons separated by\r\nnickel and silver filings, in a partial vacuum. This receiver was\r\ndifficult of adjustment and slow in transmission. An instrument\r\nmuch less complicated and inexpensive and which will work well can\r\nbe made thus:\r\n\r\nTake a 5-cp. incandescent lamp and break off the tip at the dotted\r\nline, as shown in Fig. 5. This can be done by giving the glass tip\r\nor point a quick blow with a file or other thin edged piece of\r\nmetal. Then with a blow-torch heat the broken edges until red hot\r\nand turn the edges in as seen in Fig. 6. Remove the carbon\r\nfilament in the lamp and bend the two small platinum wires so they\r\nwill point at each other as in Fig. 6, W W. Screw the lamp into an\r\nordinary wall socket which will serve as a base as in Fig. 7. Make\r\na solution of 1 part sulphuric acid to 4 parts of water, and fill\r\nthe lamp about two-thirds full (Fig. 7). This will make an\r\nexcellent receiver. It will be necessary to adjust the platinum\r\npoints, W W, to suit the distance the message is to be worked. For\r\na mile or less the points should be about 1/16 in. apart, and\r\ncloser for longer distances.\r\n\r\nThe tuning coil is simply a variable choking coil, made of No. 14\r\ninsulated copper wire wound on an iron core, as shown in Fig. 7.\r\nAfter winding, carefully scrape the insulation from one side of\r\nthe coil, in a straight line from top to bottom, the full length\r\nof the coil, uncovering just enough to allow a\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Aerial]\r\n\r\ngood contact for the sliding piece. The tuning is done by sliding\r\nthe contact piece, which is made of light copper wire, along the\r\nconvolutions of the tuning coil until you can hear the signals.\r\nThe signals are heard in a telephone receiver, which is shown\r\nconnected in shunt across the binding posts of the lamp holder\r\nwith one or two cells of dry battery in circuit, Fig. 7.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Details]\r\n\r\nThe aerial line, No.6 stranded, is run from binding-post B through\r\nthe choking or tuning coil, and for best results should extend up\r\n50 ft. in the air. To work a 20-mile distance the line should be\r\n100 or 150 ft. above the ground. A good way is to erect a wooden\r\npole on a house or barn and carry the aerial wire to the top and\r\nout to the end of a gaff or arm.\r\n\r\nTo the end of the aerial wire fasten a bunch of endless loops made\r\nof about No. 14 magnet wire (bare or insulated), attaching both\r\nends to the leading or aerial wire. The aerial wire should not\r\ncome nearer than 1 ft. at any point to any metal which is\r\ngrounded.\r\n\r\nRun a wire from the other binding post, A, to the ground and be\r\nsure to make a good ground connection.\r\n\r\nFor simple experimental work on distances of 100 ft. only, an\r\nordinary automobile spark coil can be used in place of the more\r\nelaborate coil, Figs. 1 to 4.\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned instruments have no patents on them, and\r\nanyone is at liberty to build and use them. The writer does not\r\nclaim to be the originator, but simply illustrates the above to\r\nshow that, after all, wireless is very simple when it is once\r\nunderstood. The fundamental principles are that induction travels\r\nat right angles, 90 degrees, to the direction of the current. For\r\nan illustration, if a person standing on a bridge should drop a\r\npebble into the water below, after contact he would note circles\r\nradiating out over the surface of the water. These circles, being\r\nat right angles, 90 degrees, to the direction of the force that\r\ncaused the circles, are analogous to the flow of induction, and\r\nhence the aerial line, being vertical, transmits signals\r\nhorizontally over the earth\'s surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Beeswax for Wood Filler [85]\r\n\r\nWhen filling nail holes in yellow pine use beeswax instead of\r\nputty, as it matches the color well.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Lathe [86]\r\n\r\nA small speed-lathe, suitable for turning wood or small metal\r\narticles, may be easily made at very little expense. A lathe of\r\nthis kind is shown in the cut (Fig. 1), where A is the headstock,\r\nB the bed and C the tailstock. I run my lathe by power, using an\r\nelectric motor and countershaft, but it could be run by foot power\r\nif desired. A large cone pulley would then be required, but this\r\nmay be made in the same manner as the small one, which will be\r\ndescribed later.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Assembled Lathe Bed and Bearing Details]\r\n\r\nThe bed of the machine is made of wood as shown in Figs. 2 and 3,\r\nhardwood being preferable for this purpose. Fig. 2 shows an end\r\nview of the assembled bed, and Fig. 3 shows how the ends are cut\r\nout to receive the side pieces.\r\n\r\nThe headstock, Fig. 6, is fastened to the bed by means of carriage\r\nbolts, A, which pass through a piece of wood, B, on the under side\r\nof the bed. The shaft is made of 3/4-in. steel tubing about 1/8\r\nin. thick, and runs in babbitt bearings, one of which is shown in\r\nFig. 5.\r\n\r\nTo make these bearings, cut a square hole in the wood as shown,\r\nmaking half of the square in each half of the bearing. Separate\r\nthe two halves of the bearing slightly by placing a piece of\r\ncardboard on each side, just touching the shaft. The edges which\r\ntouch the shaft should be notched like the teeth of a saw, so as\r\nto allow the babbitt to run into the lower half of the bearing.\r\nThe notches for this purpose may be about 1/8 in. pitch and 1/8\r\nin. deep. Place pieces of wood against the ends of the bearing as\r\nshown at A and B, Fig. 4, and drill a hole in the top of the\r\nbearing as shown in Fig. 4.\r\n\r\nThe bearing is then ready to be poured. Heat the babbitt well, but\r\nnot hot enough to burn it, and it is well to have the shaft hot,\r\ntoo, so that the babbitt will not be chilled when it strikes the\r\nshaft. If the shaft is thoroughly chalked or smoked the babbitt\r\nwill not stick to it. After pouring, remove the shaft and split\r\nthe bearing with a round, tapered wooden pin. If the bearing has\r\nbeen properly made, it will split along the line of the notched\r\ncardboard where the section of the metal is smallest. Then drill a\r\nhole in the top as shown at A, Fig. 5, drilling just deep enough\r\nto have the point of the drill appear at the lower side. This\r\ncavity acts as an oil cup and prevents the bearing from running\r\ndry.\r\n\r\nThe bolts B (Fig. 5) are passed through holes in the wood and\r\nscrewed into nuts C, which are let into holes\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6 Headstock Details]\r\n\r\nD, the holes afterward being filled with melted lead.\r\n\r\nThis type of bearing will be found very satisfactory and may be\r\nused to advantage on other machines. After the bearings are\r\ncompleted the cone pulley can be placed on the shaft. To make this\r\npulley cut three circular pieces of wood to the dimensions given\r\nin Fig. 6 and fasten these together with nails and glue. If not\r\nperfectly true, they may be turned up after assembling, by rigging\r\nup a temporary toolrest in front of the headstock.\r\n\r\nThe tail stock (Fig. 7) is fastened to the bed in the same manner\r\nas the headstock, except that thumb nuts are used on the carriage\r\nbolts, thus allowing the tail stock to be shifted when necessary.\r\nThe mechanism of the center holder is obtained by using a 1/2-in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG.7 Details of Tailstock]\r\n\r\npipe, A, and a 1/2-in. lock nut, B, embedded in the wood. I found\r\nthat a wooden tool-rest was not satisfactory, so I had to buy one,\r\nbut they are inexpensive and much handier than homemade tool rest.\r\n--Contributed by Donald Reeves, Oak Park, Ill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** To Use Old Battery Zincs [87]\r\n\r\nWhen the lower half of a battery zinc becomes eaten away the\r\nremaining part can be used again by suspending it from a wire as\r\nshown in the cut. Be sure and have a good connection at the zinc\r\nbinding post and cover that with melted paraffin. This prevents\r\ncorrosion, which would otherwise occur from the action of the sal\r\nammoniac or other chemical. The wire may be held at the top by\r\ntwisting it around a piece\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Showing Zinc Suspended]\r\n\r\nof wood or by driving a peg through the hole in the porcelain\r\ninsulator.\r\n--Contributed by Louis Lauderbach, Newark, N.J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Callers\' Approach Alarm [87]\r\n\r\nThis alarm rings so that callers approaching the door may be seen\r\nbefore they ring the bell and one can exercise his pleasure about\r\nadmitting them.\r\n\r\nIf one has a wooden walk, the alarm is easy to fix up. Take up\r\nabout 5 ft. of the walk and nail it together so as to make a\r\ntrapdoor that will work easily. Place a small spring under one end\r\nto hold it up about 1/4 in. (A, Fig. 2). Nail a strip of tin along\r\nthe under side of the trap near the spring and fasten another\r\nstrip on the baseboard, so that they will not touch, save when a\r\nweight is on the trap. Connect up an electric bell, putting the\r\nbatteries and bell anywhere desired, and using rubber-covered\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Alarm Rings When Caller Approaches]\r\n\r\nwire outside the house, and the alarm is complete.\r\n\r\nWhen a person approaching the house steps on the trap, the bell\r\nwill ring and those in the house can see who it is before the door\r\nbell rings.\r\n--Contributed by R. S. Jackson, Minneapolis, Minn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Easy Method of Electroplating [88]\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding to electroplate with copper, silver or other\r\nmetal, clean the articles thoroughly, as the least spot of grease\r\nor dirt will prevent\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Electroplating Apparatus]\r\n\r\nthe deposit from adhering. Then polish the articles and rub them\r\nover with a cloth and fine pumice powder, to roughen the surface\r\nslightly. Finally, to remove all traces of grease, dip the\r\narticles to be plated in a boiling potash solution made by\r\ndissolving 4 oz. American ash in 1-1/2 pt. of water. Do not touch\r\nthe work with the hands again. To avoid touching it, hang the\r\narticles on the wires, by which they are to be suspended in the\r\nplating bath, before dipping them in the potash solution; then\r\nhold them by the wires under running water for ten minutes to\r\ncompletely remove every trace of the potash.\r\n\r\nFor plating with copper prepare the following solution: 4 oz.\r\ncopper sulphate dissolved in 12 oz. water; add strong ammonia\r\nsolution until no more green crystals are precipitated. Then add\r\nmore ammonia and stir until the green crystals are re-dissolved\r\ngiving an intense blue solution. Add slowly a strong solution of\r\npotassium cyanide until the blue color disappears, leaving a clear\r\nsolution; add potassium cyanide again, about one-fourth as much in\r\nbulk as used in the decolorizing process. Then make the solution\r\nup to 2 qt. with water. With an electric pressure of 3.5 to 4\r\nvolts, this will give an even deposit of copper on the article\r\nbeing plated.\r\n\r\nA solution for silver plating may be prepared as follows: Dissolve\r\n3/4 oz. of commercial silver nitrate in 8 oz. of water, and slowly\r\nadd a strong solution of potassium cyanide until no more white\r\nprecipitate is thrown down. Then pour the liquid off and wash the\r\nprecipitate carefully. This is best done by filling the bottle\r\nwith water, shaking, allowing precipitate to settle and then\r\npouring off the water. Repeat six times. Having finished washing\r\nthe precipitate, slowly add to it a solution of potassium cyanide\r\nuntil all the precipitate is dissolved. Then add an excess of\r\npotassium cyanide--about as much as was used in dissolving the\r\nprecipitate--and make the solution up to 1 qt. with water. This\r\nsolution, with an electric pressure of 2 to 4 volts, will give a\r\ngood white coat of silver in twenty minutes to half-an-hour; use 2\r\nvolts for large articles, and 4 volts for very small ones. If more\r\nsolution is required, it is only necessary to double all given\r\nquantities.\r\n\r\nBefore silver plating, such metals as iron, lead, pewter, zinc,\r\nmust be coated with copper in the alkaline copper bath described,\r\nand then treated as copper. On brass, copper, German silver,\r\nnickel and such metals, silver can be plated direct. The deposit\r\nof silver will be dull and must be polished. The best method is to\r\nuse a revolving scratch brush; if one does not possess a buffing\r\nmachine, a hand scratch brush is good. Take quick, light strokes.\r\nPolish the articles finally with ordinary plate powder.\r\n\r\nThe sketch shows how to suspend the articles in the plating-bath.\r\nIf accumulators are used, which is advised, be sure to connect the\r\npositive (or red) terminal to the piece of silver hanging in the\r\nbath, and the negative (or black) terminal to the article to be\r\nplated. Where Bunsen cells are used, the carbon terminal takes the\r\nplace of the positive terminal of the accumulator. --Model\r\nEngineer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** An Ingenious Electric Lock for a Sliding Door [89]\r\n\r\nThe apparatus shown in Fig. 1 not only unlocks, but opens the\r\ndoor, also, by simply pressing the key in the keyhole.\r\n\r\nIn rigging it to a sliding door, the materials required are: Three\r\nflat pulleys, an old electric bell or buzzer, about 25 ft. of\r\nclothesline rope and some No. 18 wire. The wooden catch, A (Fig.\r\n1), must be about 1 in. thick\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Electric Lock for Sliding Door]\r\n\r\nand 8 in. long; B should be of the same wood, 10 in. long, with\r\nthe pivot 2 in. from the lower end. The wooden block C, which is\r\nheld by catch B, Can be made of a 2-in. piece of broomstick. Drill\r\na hole through the center of this block for the rope to pass\r\nthrough, and fasten it to the rope with a little tire tape.\r\n\r\nWhen all this is set up, as shown in Fig. 1, make a key and\r\nkeyhole. A 1/4 in. bolt or a large nail sharpened to a point, as\r\nat F, Fig. 3, will serve for the key. To provide the keyhole, saw\r\na piece of wood, I, 1 in. thick by 3 in. square, and bore a hole\r\nto fit the key in the center. Make a somewhat larger block (E,\r\nFig. 3) of thin wood with a 1/8-in. hole in its center. On one\r\nside of this block tack a piece of tin (K, Fig. 3) directly over\r\nthe hole. Screw the two blocks together, being careful to bring\r\nthe holes opposite each other. Then, when the point of the key\r\ntouches the tin, and the larger part (F, Fig. 3) strikes the bent\r\nwire L, a circuit is completed; the buzzer knocks catch A (Fig.\r\n1), which rises at the opposite end and allows catch B to fly\r\nforward and release the piece of broom-stick C. The weight D then\r\nfalls and jerks up the hook-lock M, which unlocks the door, and\r\nthe heavier weight N immediately opens it.\r\n\r\nThus, with a switch as in Fig. 3, the door can only be opened by\r\nthe person who has the key, for the circuit cannot be closed with\r\nan ordinary nail or wire. B, Fig. 2, shows catch B, Fig. 1,\r\nenlarged; 0, Fig. 2, is the cut through which the rope runs; H,\r\nFig. 1, is an elastic that snaps the catch back into place, and at\r\nG the wires run outside to the keyhole.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement is very convenient when one is carrying something\r\nin one hand and can only use the other. Closing the door winds up\r\nthe apparatus again.\r\n--Contributed by E. H. Klipstein, 116 Prospect St., East Orange,\r\nNew Jersey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Parlor Magic for Winter Evenings [90]\r\nBy C. H. CLAUDY\r\n\r\nYou are seated in a parlor at night, with the lights turned low.\r\nIn front of you, between the parlor and the room back of it, is an\r\nupright square of brightly burning lights, surrounding a perfectly\r\nblack space. The magician stands in front of this, in his shirt\r\nsleeves, and after a few words of introduction proceeds to show\r\nthe wonders of his magic cave.\r\n\r\nShowing you plainly that both hands are empty, he points with one\r\nfinger to the box, where immediately appears a small white china\r\nbowl. Holding his empty hand over this bowl, some oranges and\r\napples drop from his empty hand into the bowl. He removes the bowl\r\nfrom the black box, or cave, and hands its contents round to the\r\naudience. Receiving the bowl again, he tosses it into the cave,\r\nbut it never reaches the floor--it disappears in midair.\r\n\r\nThe illusions he shows you are too many to retail at length.\r\nObjects appear and disappear. Heavy metal objects, such as forks,\r\nspoons and jackknives, which have been shown to the audience and\r\nwhich can have no strings attached to them, fly about in the box\r\nat the will of the operator. One thing changes to another and back\r\nagain, and black art reigns supreme.\r\n\r\nNow all this "magic" is very simple and requires no more skill to\r\nprepare or execute than any clever boy or girl of fourteen may\r\npossess. It is based on the performance of the famous Hermann, and\r\nrelies on a principle of optics for its success. To prepare such a\r\nmagic cave, the requisites are a large soap box, a few simple\r\ntools, some black paint, some black cloth, and plenty of candles.\r\n\r\nThe box must be altered first. One end is removed, and a slit,\r\none-third of the length from the remaining end, cut in one side.\r\nThis slit should be as long as the width of the box and about five\r\ninches wide. On either side of the box, half way from open end to\r\nclosed end, should be cut a hole, just large enough to comfortably\r\nadmit a hand and arm.\r\n\r\nNext, the box should be painted black both inside and out, and\r\nfinally lined inside with black cloth. This lining must be done\r\nneatly-no folds must show and no heads of tacks. The interior must\r\nbe a dead black. The box is painted black first so that the cloth\r\nused need not be very heavy; but if the cloth be sufficiently\r\nthick, no painting inside is required. The whole inside is to be\r\ncloth-lined, floor, top, sides and end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Candle stand]\r\n\r\nNext, the illumination in front must be arranged. If you can have\r\na plumber make you a square frame of gas-piping, with tiny holes\r\nall along it for the gas to escape and be lit, and connect this by\r\nmeans of a rubber tube to the gas in the house, so much the\r\nbetter; but a plentiful supply of short candles will do just as\r\nwell, although a little more trouble. The candles must be close\r\ntogether and arranged on little brackets around the whole front of\r\nthe "cave" (see small cut), and should have little pieces of\r\nbright tin behind them, to throw the light toward the audience.\r\nThe whole function of these candles is to dazzle the eyes of the\r\nspectators, heighten the illusion, and prevent them seeing very\r\nfar into the black box.\r\n\r\nFinally, you must have an assistant, who must be provided with\r\neither black gloves or black bags to go over his hands and arms,\r\nand several black drop curtains, attached to sticks greater in\r\nlength than the width of the box, which are let down through the\r\nslit in the top.\r\n\r\nThe audience room should have only low lights; the room where the\r\ncave is should be dark, and if you can drape portieres between two\r\nrooms around the box (which, of course, is on a table) so much the\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\nThe whole secret of the trick lies in the fact that if light be\r\nturned away from anything black, into the eyes of him who looks,\r\nthe much fainter light reflected from the black surface will not\r\naffect the observer\'s eye. Consequently, if, when the exhibitor\r\nputs his hand in the cave, his confederate behind inserts his\r\nhand, covered with a black glove and holding a small bag of black\r\ncloth, in which are oranges and apples, and pours them from the\r\nbag into a dish, the audience sees the oranges and apples appear,\r\nbut does not see the black arm and bag against the black\r\nbackground.\r\n\r\nThe dish appears by having been placed in position behind a black\r\ncurtain, which is snatched swiftly away at the proper moment by\r\nthe assistant. Any article thrown into the cave and caught by the\r\nblack hand and concealed by a black cloth seems to disappear. Any\r\nobject not too large can be made to "levitate" by the same means.\r\nA picture of anyone present may be made to change into a grinning\r\nskeleton by suddenly screening it with a dropped curtain, while\r\nanother curtain is swiftly removed from over a pasteboard\r\nskeleton, which can be made to dance either by strings, or by the\r\nblack veiled hand holding on to it from behind, and the skeleton\r\ncan change to a white cat.\r\n\r\nBut illusions suggest themselves. There is no end to the effects\r\nwhich can be had from this simple apparatus, and if the operators\r\nare sufficiently well drilled the result is truly remarkable to\r\nthe uninitiated. The illusion, as presented by Hermann, was\r\nidentical with this, only he, of course, had a big stage, and\r\npeople clothed in black to creep about and do his bidding, while\r\nhere the power behind the throne is but a black-veiled hand and\r\narm. It can be made even more complicated by having two\r\nassistants, one on each side of the box, and this is the reason\r\nwhy it was advised that two holes be cut. This enables an\r\nabsolutely instantaneous change as one uncovers the object at the\r\nmoment the second assistant covers and removes the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Magic Cave]\r\n\r\nIt is important that the assistants remain invisible throughout,\r\nand if portieres are impossible, a screen must be used. But any\r\nboy ingenious enough to follow these simple instructions will not\r\nneed to be told that the whole success of the exhibition depends\r\nupon the absolute failure of the audience to understand that there\r\nis more than one concerned in bringing about the curious effects\r\nwhich are seen. The exhibitor should be a boy who can talk; a good\r\n"patter"--as the magicians call it--is often of more value than a\r\nwhole host of mechanical effects and helpers. It is essential that\r\nthe exhibitor and his confederate be well drilled, so that the\r\nlatter can produce the proper effects at the proper cue from the\r\nformer. Finally, never give an exhibition with the "cave" until\r\nyou have watched the illusions from the front yourself; so that\r\nyou can determine whether everything connected with the draping is\r\nright, or whether some stray bit of light reveals what you wish to\r\nconceal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Reversing-Switch for Electrical Experiments [92]\r\n\r\nA homemade reversing-switch, suitable for use by students of\r\nelectrical and engineering courses in performing experiments, is\r\nshown in the diagram.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG.2  Suitable for Students\' Use]\r\n\r\nReferring to Fig. 1, A represents a pine board 4 in. by 4 in. and\r\na is a circular piece of wood about 1/4 in. square, with three\r\nbrass strips, b1, b2, b3, held down on it by two terminals, or\r\nbinding posts, c1, c2, and a common screw, d. Post c1 is connected\r\nto d by means of an insulated wire, making them carry the same\r\nkind of current (+ in the sketch).\r\n\r\nAbout the center piece H moves a disk, held down by another disk F\r\n(Fig. 2), which is fastened through the center piece to the wooden\r\nbase, A, by means of two wood screws. On the disk G are two brass\r\nstrips, e1 and e2, so arranged that, when handle K is turned to\r\none side, their one end just slips under the strips b1, b2, or b2,\r\nb3, respectively, making contact with them, as shown in Fig. 2, at\r\nL, while their other ends slide in two half-circular brass plates\r\nf1, f2, held down on disk F by two other terminals, c3, c4, making\r\ncontact with them as shown at y, Fig. 2.\r\n\r\nThe action of the switch is shown in Fig. 1. Connect terminal c1\r\nto the carbon of a battery, and c2 to the zinc. Then, if you turn\r\nhandle K to the right, so that the strips e1 and e2 touch b1 and\r\nb2, respectively, terminal c3 will show +, and c1 -- electricity;\r\nvice versa, if you turn the handle to the left so that e1 and e2\r\ntouch b2 and b3, respectively, terminal c3 will show - , and c4 +\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\nThe switch is easy to make and of very neat appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Receive Wireless Telegraph Messages with a Telephone\r\n[92]\r\n\r\nAny telephone having carbon in the transmitter (all ordinary\r\ntelephones have carbon transmitters) can be used to receive\r\nwireless messages by simply making a few changes in the\r\nconnections and providing a suitable antenna. Connect the\r\ntransmitter and receiver in series with three dry cells and run\r\none wire from the transmitter to the antenna. Connect the other\r\ntransmitter wire to a water or gas pipe in order to ground it, and\r\nthen hold the receiver to your ear. Any wireless telegraph message\r\nwithin a radius of one mile will cause the transmitter to act as a\r\ncoherer, thus making the message audible in the receiver.\r\n\r\nBy using an ordinary telephone transmitter and receiver and a\r\n1/2-in. jump spark coil, a complete wireless telegraph station may\r\nbe made, which will send or receive messages for a radius of one\r\nmile. The accompanying wiring diagram shows how to make the\r\nconnections. By putting in an extra switch three of the sending\r\nbatteries may be switched in when receiving,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wiring Diagram for Wireless Telegraph]\r\n\r\nthus obviating the necessity of an extra set of batteries.\r\n--Contributed by A.

P. Trotter in a paper read before\r\nthe Junior Institution of Engineers of Great Britain. The device\r\nconsists of an ordinary 2-ft. rule, A, with a piece of thread tied\r\nto the 22-in. mark, as shown in the sketch, and supporting the\r\nsmall weight, B, which may be a button or other small object.\r\n\r\nThe device thus arranged, and placed on the windowsill of the car,\r\nwill indicate the acceleration and retardation as follows: Every\r\n1/2 in. traveled by the thread, over the bent portion of the rule,\r\nindicates an increase of or decrease of velocity to the extent of\r\n1 ft. per second for each second. Thus, it the thread moved 2-1/4\r\nin. in a direction opposite to the movement of the train, then the\r\ntrain would be increasing its speed at the rate of 4-1/2 ft. per\r\nsecond.\r\n\r\nIf the thread is tied at the 17-in. mark, then each half inch will\r\nrepresent the mile per hour increase for each second. Thus if the\r\nthread moves 1 in., it shows that the train is gaining 2 miles an\r\nhour each second.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** An Egg-Shell Funnel [93]\r\n\r\nBottles having small necks are hard to fill without spilling the\r\nliquid. A funnel cannot be used in a small opening, and pouring\r\nwith a graduate glass requires a steady hand. When you do not have\r\na graduate at hand, a half egg-shell with a small hole pricked in\r\nthe end will serve better than a funnel. Place the shell in an\r\noven to brown the surface slightly and it will be less brittle and\r\nlast much longer.\r\n--Contributed by Maurice Baudier, New Orleans, La.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Handy Electric Alarm [94]\r\n\r\nAn electric alarm which one may turn off from the bed without\r\narising combined with a light which may be turned on and off from\r\na lying position, so one can see the time, is the device of H. E.\r\nRedmond, of Burlington, Wis. The alarm clock rests on a shelf, A,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Handy Electric Alarm]\r\n\r\nwhich has a piece of metal, B, fastened in such a position that\r\nthe metal rod C, soldered to the alarm winder, will complete the\r\ncircuit and ring the bell. The two-point switch D is closed\r\nnormally at E, but may be closed at F any time desired, thus\r\nturning on the small incandescent light G, which illuminates the\r\nface of the clock. When the alarm goes off, the bell will continue\r\nto ring until the switch is opened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** To Keep Dogs and Cats Away from the Garbage-Can [94]\r\n\r\nLast summer I was annoyed a great deal by dogs upsetting our\r\ngarbage can on the lawn, but finally executed a plan that rid the\r\nyard of them in one afternoon.\r\n\r\nI first secured a magneto out of an old telephone, then drove a\r\nspike in a damp place under the porch, attached a wire to the\r\nspike and ran the wire to one of the poles of the magneto. Then I\r\nset the garbage-can on some blocks of wood, being careful not to\r\nhave it touch the ground at any point. I next ran a wire from the\r\nother pole of the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wiring]\r\n\r\nmagneto to the can, wrapping the wire around the can several\r\ntimes. Then I sat down on the porch to wait.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before a big greyhound came along, putting his\r\nforepaws on the top of the can to upset it. At the same instant I\r\ngave the magneto a quick turn, which sent the dog away a very\r\nsurprised animal. This was repeated several times during the\r\nafternoon with other dogs, and with the same result. --Contributed\r\nby Gordon T.

Macey, New York City.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Relay]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Foundry Work at Home [95]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** I The Equipment [95]\r\n\r\nMany amateur mechanics who require small metal castings in their\r\nwork would like to make their own castings. This can easily be\r\ndone at home without going to any great expense, and the variety\r\nand usefulness of the articles produced will make the equipment a\r\ngood investment.\r\n\r\nWith the easily made devices about to be described, the young\r\nmechanic can make his own telegraph keys and sounders, battery\r\nzincs, binding posts, engines, cannons, bearings, small machinery\r\nparts, models and miniature objects, ornaments of various kinds,\r\nand duplicates of all these, and many other interesting and useful\r\narticles.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to make is a molding bench, as shown in Fig. 1. It\r\nis possible to make molds without a bench, but it is a mistake to\r\ntry to do this, as the sand is sure to get on the floor, whence it\r\nis soon tracked into the house. The bench will also make the\r\noperation of molding much easier and will prove to be a great\r\nconvenience.\r\n\r\nThe bench should be made of lumber about 1 in. thick and should be\r\nconstructed in the form of a trough, as shown. Two cleats, AA,\r\nshould be nailed to the front and back to support the\r\ncross-boards, BE, which in turn support the mold while it is being\r\nmade. The object of using the cleats and removable cross-boards\r\ninstead of a stationary shelf is to give access to the sand, C,\r\nwhen it is being prepared.\r\n\r\nAbout one or two cubic feet of fine molding-sand will be required,\r\nwhich may, be purchased at the nearest foundry for a small sum.\r\nYellow sand will be found a little better for the amateur\'s work\r\nthan the black sand generally used in most foundries, but if no\r\nyellow sand can be obtained the black kind will do. If there is no\r\nfoundry\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1 - Convenient Arrangement of Bench and Tools]\r\n\r\nnear at hand, try using sand from other sources, giving preference\r\nto the finest sand and that which clings together in a cake when\r\ncompressed between the hands. Common lake or river sand is not\r\nsuitable for the purpose, as it is too coarse and will not make a\r\ngood mold.\r\n\r\nFor mixing and preparing the sand a small shovel, D, and a sieve,\r\nE, will be required. If desired the sieve may be homemade.\r\nOrdinary wire netting such as is used in screen doors, is about\r\nthe right mesh, and this, nailed to replace the bottom of a box,\r\nmakes a very good sieve.\r\n\r\nThe rammer, F, is made of wood, and is wedge-shaped at one end and\r\nflat at the other, as shown. In foundries each molder generally\r\nuses two rammers, but for the small work which will be described\r\none will be sufficient. An old teaspoon, G, will be found useful\r\nin the molding operations and may be hung on the wall or other\r\nconvenient place when not in use.\r\n\r\nThe cloth bag, H, which can be made of a knitted stocking, is\r\nfilled with coal dust; which is used for a parting medium in\r\nmaking the molds. Take a small lump of soft coal and reduce to\r\npowder by pounding. Screen out all the coarse pieces and put the\r\nremainder in the bag. A slight shake of the bag\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2; Homemade Flask]\r\n\r\nover the mold will then cause a cloud of coal-dust to fall on it,\r\nthus preventing the two layers of sand from sticking, but this\r\noperation will be described more fully later on.\r\n\r\nThe flask, J, Fig. 1, is shown more clearly in Fig. 2. It is made\r\nof wood and is in two halves, the "cope," or upper half, and the\r\n"drag," or lower part. A good way to make the flask is to take a\r\nbox, say 12 in. by 8 in. by 6 in. high, and saw it in half\r\nlongitudinally, as shown. If the box is not very strong, the\r\ncorners should be braced with triangular wooden strips, A A, which\r\nshould be nailed in, previous to sawing. The wooden strips BB are\r\nused to hold the sand, which would otherwise slide out of the\r\nflask when the two halves of the mold are separated.\r\n\r\nThe dowels, CC, are a very important part of the flask as upon\r\nthem depends the matching of the two halves of the mold. A\r\nwedge-shaped piece, CC, is nailed to each end of the cope, and the\r\nlower pieces, DD, are then nailed on the drag so that they just\r\ntouch C when the flask is closed. The two halves of the flask will\r\nthen occupy exactly the same relative position whenever they are\r\nput together.\r\n\r\nAfter the flask is done make two boards as shown at K, Fig. 1, a\r\nlittle larger than the outside of the flask. A couple of cleats\r\nnailed to each board will make it easier to pick up the mold when\r\nit is on the floor.\r\n\r\nA cast-iron glue-pot makes a very good crucible for melting the\r\nmetal, which can be either aluminum, white metal, zinc or any\r\nother metal having a low melting-point. This completes the\r\nequipment with the exception of one or two simple devices which\r\nwill now be described.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** II - How to Make a Mold [96]\r\n\r\nHaving finished making the flask and other equipment, as\r\ndescribed, everything will be ready for the operation of molding.\r\nIt would be well for those who have never had any experience in\r\nthis line to visit a small brass foundry, where they can watch the\r\nmolders at work, as it is much easier to learn by observation; but\r\nthey must not expect to make a good mold at the first trial. The\r\nfirst attempt usually results in the sand dropping out of the cope\r\nwhen it is being lifted from the drag, either because of\r\ninsufficient ramming around the edges or because the sand is too\r\ndry.\r\n\r\nA good way to tell when the sand is moist enough is to squeeze it\r\nin the hand. If it forms into a cake and shows all the\r\nfinger-marks, it has a sufficient amount of moisture, but if it\r\ncrumbles or fails to cake it is too dry. An ordinary watering-pot\r\nwill be found useful in moistening the sand, but care should be\r\ntaken not to get it too wet, or the hot metal coming in contact\r\nwith it when the mold is poured will cause such rapid evaporation\r\nthat the mold will "boil" and make a poor casting. A little\r\npractice in this operation will soon enable the molder to\r\ndetermine the correct amount of moisture.\r\n\r\nWhen molding with sand for the first time it will be necessary to\r\nscreen it all before using it, in order to remove the lumps, and\r\nif water is added, the sand should be thoroughly shoveled until\r\nthe moisture is evenly distributed. The sand is then ready for\r\nmolding.\r\n\r\nThe operation of making a mold is as follows: The lower half of\r\nthe flask, or "drag," and the pattern to be molded are both placed\r\non the cover board as shown at A. A quantity of sand sufficient to\r\ncompletely cover the pattern is then sifted into the drag, which\r\nis then filled level with the top with unscreened sand. This is\r\nrammed down slightly with the rammer, and then more sand is added\r\nuntil\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig,. 3-Making a Mold]\r\n\r\nit becomes heaped up as shown at B. It is then rammed again as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to describe just how hard a mold should be\r\nrammed, but by observing the results the beginner can tell when a\r\nmold is too hard or too soft, and thus judge for himself. If the\r\nsand falls out of the flask when lifting the cope, or if it opens\r\nup or spreads after it is poured, it shows that the mold has been\r\nrammed too little, and if the surface of the sand next to the\r\npattern is cracked it shows that the mold has been rammed too\r\nhard. It will be found that the edges of the mold can stand a\r\nlittle more ramming than the middle. In finishing the ramming,\r\npound evenly all over the surface with the blunt end of the\r\nrammer.\r\n\r\nAfter ramming, scrape off the surplus sand with a straight-edged\r\nstick, as shown at C, and scatter about 1/16 in. of loose sand\r\nover the surface for a good bearing. Place another cover board on\r\ntop, as shown at D, and by grasping with both hands, as shown,\r\nturn the drag other side up. Remove the upper cover board and\r\nplace the upper half of the flask, or "cope," in position, as\r\nshown at E.\r\n\r\nIn order to prevent the two layers of sand sticking together, the\r\nsurface of the sand at E should be covered with coal-dust. This is\r\ndone by shaking the coal-dust bag over the flask, after which the\r\ndust on the pattern may be removed by blowing. The cope is then\r\nfilled with sand and rammed in exactly the same manner as in the\r\ncase of the drag.\r\n\r\nAfter the ramming is done a number of vent holes are made, as\r\nshown at F, from the surface of the mold to the pattern, in order\r\nto allow the escape of air and steam when the mold is being\r\npoured. These vent holes may be made by pushing a wire about the\r\nsize of a knitting-needle down through the sand until it touches\r\nthe pattern. The "sprue," or pouring-hole, is next cut, by means\r\nof the sprue-cutter shown at the right, which consists of a piece\r\nof thin brass or steel tubing about 3/4 in. in diameter.\r\n\r\nNow comes the critical part of the molding operation--that of\r\nlifting the cope from the drag. It is here that the amateur often\r\nbecomes discouraged, as the sand is liable to fall out of the cope\r\nand spoil the mold; but with a little practice and patience the\r\nmolder can lift the cope every time without breaking it, as shown\r\nat G.\r\n\r\nThe next operation is that of cutting the gate, which carries the\r\nmolten metal from the sprue to the opening left by the pattern.\r\nThis is done with a spoon, a channel being cut about 3/4 in. wide\r\nand about 1/4 in. deep. The pattern is then drawn from the mold,\r\nas shown at H, by driving a sharp pointed steel rod into the\r\npattern and lifting it from the sand. When a metal pattern is used\r\na thread rod is used, which is screwed into a tapped hole in the\r\npattern. Before drawing it is well to tap the drawing-rod lightly\r\nwith another and larger rod, striking it in all directions and\r\nthus loosening the sand slightly from the pattern. Some molders\r\ntap the pattern gently when withdrawing, as shown at H, in order\r\nto loosen any sand which has a tendency to stick.\r\n\r\nAfter drawing the pattern, place the cope back on the drag, as\r\nshown at J. Place a brick or other flat, heavy object on top of\r\nthe mold above the pattern, to prevent the pressure of the melted\r\nmetal separating the two halves of the mold, and then pour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** III- Melting and Pouring [98]\r\n\r\nHaving prepared one or more molds, the next operation is that of\r\nmelting and pouring. An ordinary cast-iron glue-pot makes a good\r\ncrucible and can be easily handled by a pair of tongs, made out of\r\nsteel rod, as shown in the sketch. In order to hold the tongs\r\ntogether a small link can be slipped on over the handle, thus\r\nholding the crucible securely.\r\n\r\nA second piece of steel rod bent in the form of a hook at the end\r\nis very useful for supporting the weight of the crucible and\r\nprevents spilling the molten metal should the tongs slip off the\r\ncrucible. The hook is also useful for removing the crucible from\r\nthe fire, which should be done soon after the metal is entirely\r\nmelted, in order to prevent overheating. The metal should be\r\npoured into the mold in a small stream, to give the air a chance\r\nto escape, and should not be poured directly into the center of\r\nthe opening, as the metal will then strike the bottom hard enough\r\nto loosen the sand, thus making a dirty casting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4 -Pouring the Metal]\r\n\r\nIf, after being poured, the mold sputters and emits large volumes\r\nof steam, it shows that the sand is too wet, and the castings in\r\nsuch cases will probably be imperfect and full of holes.\r\n\r\nA mold made in the manner previously described may be poured with\r\nany desired metal, but a metal which is easily melted will give\r\nthe least trouble. One of the easiest metals to melt and one which\r\nmakes very attractive castings is pure tin. Tin melts at a\r\ntemperature slightly above the melting point of solder, and,\r\nalthough somewhat expensive, the permanent brightness and\r\nsilver-like appearance of the castings is very desirable. A good\r\n"white metal" may be made by mixing 75% tin, 15% lead, 5% zinc and\r\n5% antimony. The object of adding antimony to an alloy is to\r\nprevent shrinkage when cooling.\r\n\r\nA very economical alloy is made by melting up all the old\r\ntype-metal, babbitt, battery zincs, white metal and other scrap\r\navailable, and adding a little antimony if the metal shrinks too\r\nmuch in cooling. If a good furnace is available, aluminum can be\r\nmelted without any difficulty, although this metal melts at a\r\nhigher temperature than any of the metals previously mentioned.\r\n\r\nIn casting zincs for batteries a separate crucible, used only for\r\nzinc, is very desirable, as the presence of a very small amount of\r\nlead or other impurity will cause the batteries to polarize. A\r\nvery good way to make the binding posts is to remove the binding\r\nposts from worn-out dry batteries and place them in the molds in\r\nsuch a way that the melted zinc will flow around them.\r\n\r\nThe time required for a casting to solidify varies with the size\r\nand shape of the casting, but unless the pattern is a very large\r\none about five minutes will be ample time for it to set. The\r\ncasting is then dumped out of the mold and the sand brushed off.\r\nThe gate can be removed with either a cold chisel or a hacksaw,\r\nand the casting is then ready for finishing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Battery Switch [99]\r\n\r\nIn cases where batteries are used in series and it is desirable to\r\nchange the strength and direction of the current frequently, the\r\nfollowing device will be found most convenient. In my own case I\r\nused four batteries, but any reasonable number may be used.\r\nReferring to the figure, it will be seen that by moving the switch\r\nA toward the left the current can be reduced from four batteries\r\nto none, and then by moving the switch B toward the right the\r\ncurrent can be turned on in the opposite\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Battey Switch]\r\n\r\ndirection to the desired strength.

The operation of the oars is\r\nboth tiresome and uninteresting, and the oarsman is obliged to\r\ntravel, backward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Paddle Boat]\r\n\r\nBy replacing the oars with paddles, as shown in the illustration,\r\nthe operator can see where he is going and enjoy the exercise much\r\nbetter than with oars. He can easily steer the boat with his feet,\r\nby means of a pivoted stick in the bottom of the boat, connected\r\nby cords to the rudder.\r\n\r\nAt the blacksmith shop have a 5/8-in. shaft made, as shown at A,\r\nFig. 2. It will be necessary to furnish a sketch giving all the\r\ndimensions of the shaft, which should be designed to suit the\r\ndimensions of the boat, taking care that sufficient clearance is\r\nallowed, so that the cranks in revolving will not strike the\r\noperator\'s knees. If desired, split-wood handles may be placed on\r\nthe cranks, to prevent them from rubbing the hands.\r\n\r\nThe bearings, B, may be made of hardwood, but preferably of iron\r\npipe filled with melted babbitt. If babbitt is used, either\r\nthoroughly smoke or chalk the shaft or wrap paper around it to\r\nprevent the babbitt sticking. The pieces of pipe may be then\r\nfastened to the boat by means of small pipe straps, such as may be\r\nobtained at any plumber\'s at a very small cost.\r\n\r\nThe hubs, C, should be made of wood, drilled to fit the shaft and\r\nmortised out to hold the paddles, D. The covers, E, may be\r\nconstructed of thin wood or galvanized iron and should be braced\r\nby triangular boards, as shown in Fig. 1. If galvanized iron is\r\nused, it should be exposed to the weather two or three months\r\nbefore painting, or the paint will come off, spoiling its\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Detail of Paddle Boat]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Peculiar Properties of Ice [100]\r\n\r\nOf all the boys who make snowballs probably few know what occurs\r\nduring the process. Under ordinary conditions water turns to ice\r\nwhen the temperature falls to 32 degrees, but when in motion, or\r\nunder pressure, much lower temperatures are required to make it a\r\nsolid. In the same way, ice which is somewhat below the freezing\r\npoint can be made liquid by applying pressure, and will remain\r\nliquid until the pressure is removed, when it will again return to\r\nits original state. Snow, being simply finely divided ice, becomes\r\nliquid in places when compressed by the hands, and when the\r\npressure is removed the liquid portions solidify and unite all the\r\nparticles in one mass. In extremely cold weather it is almost\r\nimpossible to make a snowball, because a greater amount of\r\npressure is then required to make the snow liquid.\r\n\r\nThis process of melting and freezing under different pressures and\r\na constant temperature is well illustrated by the experiment shown\r\nin Figs. 1, 2 and 3. A block of ice, A, Fig. 1, is\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Experiment with a Block of Ice]\r\n\r\nsupported at each end by boxes BB, and a weight, W, is hung on a\r\nwire loop which passes around the ice as shown. The pressure of\r\nthe wire will then melt the ice and allow the wire to sink down\r\nthrough the ice as shown in Fig. 2. The wire will continue to cut\r\nits way through the ice until it passes all the way through the\r\npiece, as shown in Fig. 3. This experiment not only illustrates\r\nhow ice melts under pressure, but also how it solidifies when the\r\npressure is removed, for the block will still be left in one piece\r\nafter the wire has passed through.\r\n\r\nAnother peculiar property of ice is its tendency to flow. It may\r\nseem strange that ice should flow like water, but the glaciers of\r\nSwitzerland and other countries are literally rivers of ice. The\r\nsnow which accumulates on the mountains in vast quantities is\r\nturned to ice as a result of the enormous pressure caused by its\r\nown weight, and flows through the natural channels it has made in\r\nthe rock until it reaches the valley below. In flowing through\r\nthese channels it frequently passes around bends, and when two\r\nbranches come together the bodies of ice unite the same as water\r\nwould under the same conditions. The rate of flow is often very\r\nslow; sometimes only one or two feet a day, but, no matter how\r\nslow the motion may be, the large body of ice has to bend in\r\nmoving.\r\n\r\nThis property of ice is hard to illustrate with the substance\r\nitself, but may be clearly shown by sealing-wax, which resembles\r\nice in this respect. Any attempt to bend a piece of cold\r\nsealing-wax with the hands results in breaking it, but by placing\r\nit between books, as shown on page 65, or supporting it in some\r\nsimilar way, it will gradually change from the original shape A,\r\nand assume the shape shown at B.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Return-Call Bell With One Wire [101]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wiring Diagram]\r\n\r\nTo use only one wire for a return call bell connect up as shown in\r\nthe diagram, using a closed circuit or gravity battery, B.

They are commonly known as miniature\r\nbattery bulbs, since a battery is the most popular source of\r\npower. The 1/2-cp. bulbs are usually 2-1/2 volts and take 1/4\r\nampere of current. It requires about three medium dry cells to\r\noperate it. However, there is now upon the market a battery\r\nconsisting of 3 small dry cells connected in series, put up in a\r\nneat case with 2 binding posts, which sells for 25 cents. This is\r\nmore economical than dry cells, as it gives about 4 volts and 3\r\namperes. It will run as large a lamp a 3-1/2 volts, 1 cp., for\r\nsome time very satisfactorily. More than one lamp can be run by\r\nconnecting the bulbs in parallel, as indicated by Fig. 1, which\r\nshows the special battery with 3 dry cells in the case, and the 2\r\nbinding posts for connection with the bulbs. In this case it is\r\nalso advisable to connect several batteries in parallel also, so\r\nas to increase the current, but maintain the voltage constant.\r\nThus the individual cells are in multiple series, i. e., multiples\r\nof series of three. By keeping in mind the ampere output of the\r\nbattery and rating of the lamp, one can regulate the batteries as\r\nrequired. It must be remembered, in this connection, that any\r\nbattery which is drawn upon for half of its output will last\r\napproximately three times as long, as if drawn upon for its total\r\noutput. Thus, in any system of lamps, it is economical to provide\r\ntwice as many batteries as necessary. This also supplies a means\r\nof still maintaining the candle power when the batteries are\r\npartially exhausted, by connecting them in series. However, this\r\nmust be done with very great caution, as the lights will be burnt\r\nout if the voltage is too high.\r\n\r\nPersons living in the city will find an economical means of\r\nlighting lamps by securing exhausted batteries from any garage,\r\nwhere they are glad to have them taken away. A certain number of\r\nthese, after a rest, can be connected up in series, and will give\r\nthe proper voltage.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, for battery power: Connecting batteries in series\r\nincreases the voltage, and slightly cuts down the current or\r\namperage, which is the same as that of one battery; while\r\nconnecting batteries in parallel increases the amperage, but holds\r\nthe voltage the same as that of one cell. Thus, if the voltage and\r\namperage of any cell be known, by the proper combination of these,\r\nwe can secure the required voltage and amperage to light any\r\nminiature lamp. And it might be said that dry cells are the best\r\nfor this purpose, especially those of low internal resistance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG.2]\r\n\r\nFor those having a good water supply there is a more economical\r\nmeans of maintenance, although the first cost is greater. Fig. 2\r\nshows the scheme. A small dynamo driven by a water motor attached\r\nto a faucet, generates the power for the lights. The cost of the\r\nsmallest outfit of the kind is about $3 for the water motor and $4\r\nfor the dynamo. This dynamo has an output of 12 watts, and will\r\nproduce from 18 to 25 cp., according to the water pressure\r\nobtainable. It is advisable to install the outfit in the basement,\r\nwhere the water pressure is the greatest, and then lead No. 18 B &\r\nS. double insulated wire wherever needed. The dynamo can also be\r\nused as a motor,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3]\r\n\r\nand is wound for any voltage up to ten. The winding should\r\ncorrespond to the voltage of the lamps which you desire to run.\r\nHowever, if wound for 6 volts, one could run parallel series of\r\ntwo 3-volt, 1-cp. lamps; making, as in Fig. 3, 11 series, or 22\r\nlights. If wound for 10 volts, it would give 1-1/4 amperes and run\r\nfour 6-cp. lamps. Thus, it will be seen that any candle power lamp\r\ncan be operated by putting the proper number of lights in each\r\nseries, and running the series in parallel. So, to secure light by\r\nthis method, we simply turn on the water, and the water\r\nconsumption is not so great as might be imagined.\r\n\r\nFor the party who has electric light in his house there is still\r\nan easier solution for the problem of power. If the lighting\r\ncircuit gives 110 volts he can connect eleven 10-volt lamps in\r\nseries. These will give 3 cp. each, and the whole set of 11 will\r\ntake one ampere of current, and cost about the same as a 32-cp.\r\nlamp, or 1-1/4 cents per hour. Simply connect the miniature\r\ncircuit to an Edison plug, and insert in the nearest lamp socket.\r\nAny number of different candle power lamps can be used providing\r\neach lamp takes the same amount of current, and the sum of their\r\nvoltages equals the voltage of the circuit used. This arrangement\r\nof small lights is used to produce a widely distributed, and\r\ndiffused light in a room, for display of show cases, and for\r\nChristmas trees. Of all these sources of power the two last are\r\nthe most economical, and the latter of these two has in its favor\r\nthe small initial cost. These lamps are by no means playthings or\r\nexperiments, but are as serviceable and practical as the larger\r\nlamps.\r\n--Contributed by Lindsay Eldridge, Chicago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a New Language [105]\r\n\r\nAnyone possessing a phonograph can try a very interesting and\r\namusing experiment without going to any expense.

Take a pinch and spread\r\nit evenly on the glass which is on the barrel, then take the glass\r\nwith the handle and move it back and forth across the lower glass,\r\nwhile walking around the barrel; also rotate the glass, which is\r\nnecessary to make it grind evenly. The upper glass or speculum\r\nalways becomes concave, and the under glass or tool convex.\r\n\r\nWork with straight strokes 5 or 6 in. in length; after working 5\r\nhours hold the speculum in the sunshine and throw the rays of the\r\nsun onto a paper; where the rays come to a point gives the focal\r\nlength. If the glass is not ground enough to bring the rays to a\r\npoint within 5 ft., the coarse grinding must be continued, unless\r\na longer focal length is wanted.\r\n\r\nHave ready six large dishes, then take 2 lb. flour emery and mix\r\nin 12 qt. of water; immediately turn the water into a clean dish\r\nand let settle 30 seconds; then turn it into another dish and let\r\nsettle 2 minutes, then 8 minutes, 30 minutes and 90 minutes, being\r\ncareful not to turn off the coarser emery which has settled. When\r\ndry, turn the emery from the 5 jars into 5 separate bottles, and\r\nlabel. Then take a little of the coarsest powder, wetting it to\r\nthe consistency of cream, and spread on the glass, work as before\r\n(using short straight strokes 1-1/2 or 2 in.) until the holes in\r\nthe glass left by the grain emery are ground out; next use the\r\nfiner grades until the pits left by each coarser grade are ground\r\nout. When the two last grades are used shorten the strokes to less\r\nthan 2 in. When done the glass should be semi-transparent, and is\r\nready for polishing.\r\n\r\nWhen polishing the speculum, paste a strip of paper 1-1/3 in. wide\r\naround the convex glass or tool, melt 1 lb. of pitch and turn on\r\nto it and press with the wet speculum. Mold the pitch while hot\r\ninto squares of 1 in., with 1/4-in. spaces, as in Fig. 1. Then\r\nwarm and press again with the speculum, being careful to have all\r\nthe squares touch the speculum, or it will not polish evenly. Trim\r\nthe paper from the edge with a sharp knife, and paint the squares\r\nseparately with jeweler\'s rouge, wet till soft like paint. Use a\r\nbinger to spread it on with. Work the speculum over the tool the\r\nsame as when grinding, using straight strokes 2 in. or less.\r\n\r\nWhen the glass is polished enough to reflect some light, it should\r\nbe tested with the knife-edge test. In a dark room, set the\r\nspeculum against the wall, and a large lamp, L, Fig. 2, twice the\r\nfocal length away. Place a large sheet of pasteboard, A, Fig. 2,\r\nwith a small needle hole opposite the blaze, by the side of the\r\nlamp, so the light\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Detail of Telescope Construction]\r\n\r\nfrom the blaze will shine onto the glass. Place the speculum S,\r\nFig. 2, so the rays from the needle hole will be thrown to the\r\nleft side of the lamp (facing the speculum), with the knife\r\nmounted in a block of wood and edgeways to the lamp, as in K, Fig.\r\n2. The knife should not be more than 6 in. from the lamp. Now move\r\nthe knife across the rays from left to right, and look at the\r\nspeculum with the eye on the right side of the blade. When the\r\nfocus is found, if the speculum is ground and polished evenly it\r\nwill darken evenly over the surface as the knife shuts off the\r\nlight from the needle hole. If not, the speculum will show some\r\ndark rings, or hills. If the glass seems to have a deep hollow in\r\nthe center, shorter strokes should be used in polishing; if a hill\r\nin the center, longer strokes. The polishing and testing done, the\r\nspeculum is ready to be silvered. Two glass or earthenware dishes,\r\nlarge enough to hold the speculum and 2 in. deep, must be\r\nprocured. With pitch, cement a strip of board 8 in. long to the\r\nback of the speculum, and lay the speculum face down in one of the\r\ndishes; fill the dish with distilled water, and clean the face of\r\nthe speculum with nitric acid, until the water will stick to it in\r\nan unbroken film.\r\n\r\nThe recipe for silvering the speculum is:\r\n\r\n    Solution A:\r\n    Distilled water.............................4 oz.\r\n    Silver nitrate............................100 gr.\r\n\r\n    Solution B:\r\n    Distilled water.............................4 oz.\r\n    Caustic stick potash (pure by alcohol)....100 gr.\r\n\r\n    Solution C:\r\n    Aqua Ammonia.\r\n\r\n    Solution D:\r\n    Sugar loaf................................840 gr.\r\n    Nitric acid................................39 gr.\r\n    Alcohol (Pure).............................25 gr.\r\n\r\nMix solution D and make up to 25 fluid oz. with distilled water,\r\npour into a bottle and carefully put away in a safe place for\r\nfuture use, as it works better when old:\r\n\r\nNow take solution A and set aside in a small bottle one-tenth of\r\nit, and pour the rest into the empty dish; add the ammonia\r\nsolution drop by drop; a dark brown precipitate will form and\r\nsubside; stop adding ammonia solution as soon as the bath clears.\r\nThen add solution B, then ammonia until bath is clear. Now add\r\nenough of the solution A, that was set aside, to bring the bath to\r\na warm saffron color without destroying its transparency. Then add\r\n1 oz. of solution D and stir until bath grows dark. Place the\r\nspeculum, face down, in the bath and leave until the silver rises,\r\nthen raise the speculum and rinse with distilled water. The small\r\nflat mirror may be silvered the same way. When dry, the silver\r\nfilm may be polished with a piece of chamois skin, touched with\r\nrouge, the polishing being accomplished by means of a light spiral\r\nstroke.\r\n\r\nFig. 3 shows the position of the glasses in the tube, also how the\r\nrays R from a star are thrown to the eyepiece E in the side of the\r\ntube.

My telescope is 64 in. long and cost\r\nme just $15, but I used all my spare time in one winter in making\r\nit. I first began studying the heavens through a spyglass, but an\r\ninstrument such as I desired would cost $200--more than I could\r\nafford. Then I made the one described, with which I discovered a\r\nnew comet not before observed by astronomers.- John E. Mellish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make "Freak" Photographs [110]\r\n\r\nThe "freak" pictures of well-known people which were used by some\r\ndaily newspapers recently made everybody wonder how the distorted\r\nphotographs were made. A writer in Camera Craft gives the secret,\r\nwhich proves to be easy of execution. The distortion is\r\naccomplished by the use of prisms, as follows: Secure from an\r\noptician or leaded-glass establishment, two glass prisms, slightly\r\nwider than the lens mount. The flatter they are the less they will\r\ndistort. About 20. deg. is a satisfactory angle. Secure them as\r\nshown by the sectional sketch, using strawboard and black paper.\r\nThen make a ring to fit over the lens mount and connect it with\r\nthe prisms in such a way as to exclude all light from the camera\r\nexcept that which passes through the face of the prisms. The inner\r\nsurface of this hood must be\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Arrangement of Prisms]\r\n\r\ndull black. The paper which comes around plates answers nicely. If\r\nthe ring which slips over the lens mount is lined with black\r\nvelvet, it will exclude all light and hold firmly to the mount,\r\nPlace over lens, stop down well after focusing, and proceed as for\r\nany picture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Another Electric Lock [110]\r\n\r\nThe details of the construction of an electrically operated lock\r\nare shown in the illustration.

Do not stir it, just sprinkle it in until you have\r\na creamy mass without lumps. Equal parts of plaster and water is\r\napproximately the correct proportion. The addition of a little\r\nvinegar or glue water will retard the setting of the plaster, but\r\nwill not preserve its hardening. Marshmallow powder also retards\r\nthe setting. In this way the plaster may be handled a long time\r\nwithout getting hard. If you wish the plaster to set extra hard,\r\nthen add a little sulphate of potash, or powdered alum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Enlarging with a Hand Camera [111]\r\n\r\nEveryone who owns a hand camera has some pictures he would like\r\nenlarged. It is not necessary to have a large camera to do this,\r\nas the process is exceedingly simple to make large pictures from\r\nsmall negatives with the same hand camera.\r\n\r\nA room from which all light may be excluded and a window through\r\nwhich the light can enter without obstruction from trees or nearby\r\nbuildings, with a shelf to hold the camera and a table with an\r\nupright drawing-board attached, complete the arrangement. The back\r\nis taken out of the camera and fitted close against the back of\r\nthe shelf, which must be provided with a hole the same size and\r\nshape as the opening in the back of the camera. The negative used\r\nto make the enlarged print is placed in the shelf at A, Fig. 1.\r\nThe rays of the clear, unobstructed light strike the mirror, B,\r\nand reflect through the negative, A, through the lens of the\r\ncamera and on the board, as shown in Fig. 2. The window must be\r\ndarkened all around the shelf.\r\n\r\nAfter placing the negative and focusing the lens for a clear image\r\non the board, the shutter is set and a bromide paper is placed on\r\nthe board. The paper is exposed, developed and fixed by the\r\ndirections that are enclosed in the package of bromide papers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Making Large Pictures with a Small Camera]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Positioning A Hanging Lamp [111]\r\n\r\nDon\'t pull a lamp hung by flexible cord to one side with a wire\r\nand then fasten to a gas pipe.

Then blow through the spool, and it will be found\r\nthat the card will not be blown away, but will remain suspended\r\nwithout any visible support. This phenomenon is explained by the\r\nfact that the air radiates from the center at a velocity which is\r\nnearly constant, thereby producing a partial vacuum between the\r\nspool and the card.

If the apparatus is then placed\r\nin the dark and the current turned on, a peculiar phosphorescent\r\nglow will fill the whole interior of the lamp. The induction coil\r\nused for this purpose should give a spark about 1/2 in. long or\r\nmore.\r\n--Contributed by Joseph B. Bell, Brooklyn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Geissler Tube]\r\n\r\nHow to Make a Jump-Spark Coil [113]\r\n\r\nThe induction coil is probably the most popular piece of apparatus\r\nin the electrical laboratory, and particularly is it popular\r\nbecause of its use in experimental wireless telegraphy. Ten years\r\nago wireless telegraphy was a dream of scientists; today it is the\r\nplaything of school-boys and thousands of grown-up boys as well.\r\n\r\nDivested of nearly all technical phrases, an induction coil may be\r\nbriefly described as a step-up transformer of small capacity. It\r\ncomprises a core consisting of a cylindrical bundle of soft-iron\r\nwires cut to proper length. By means of two or more layers of No.\r\n14 or No. 16 magnet wire, wound evenly about this core, the bundle\r\nbecomes magnetized when the wire terminals are connected to a\r\nsource of electricity.\r\n\r\nShould we now slip over this electromagnet a paper tube upon which\r\nhas been wound with regularity a great and continuous length of\r\nNo. 36 magnet wire, it will be found that the lines of force\r\nemanating from the energized core penetrate the new coil-winding\r\nalmost as though it were but a part of the surrounding air itself,\r\nand when the battery current is broken rapidly a second electrical\r\ncurrent is said to be induced into the second coil or secondary.\r\n\r\nAll or any of the parts of an induction coil may be purchased\r\nready-made, and the first thing to do is to decide which of the\r\nparts the amateur mechanic can make and which would be better to\r\nbuy ready-made. If the builder has had no experience in\r\ncoilwinding it would probably pay to purchase the secondary coil\r\nready-wound, as the operation of winding a mile or more of fine\r\nwire is very difficult and tedious, and the results are often\r\nunsatisfactory. In ordering the secondary it is always necessary\r\nto specify the length of spark desired.\r\n\r\nThe following method of completing a 1-in. coil illustrates the\r\ngeneral details of the work. The same methods and circuits apply\r\nto small and larger coils. The ready-made secondary is in solid\r\ncylindrical form, about 6 in. long and 2-5/8 in. diameter, with a\r\nhole\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Jump-Spark Coil]\r\n\r\nthrough the winding 1-1/4 in. in diameter, as shown in Fig. 1. The\r\nsecondary will stand considerable handling without fear of injury,\r\nand need not be set into a case until the primary is completed.\r\nThe primary is made of fine annealed No. 24 iron wire cut 7 in. or\r\n8 in. in length, as the maker prefers, and bundled to a diameter\r\nof 7/8 in. The wires may be straightened by rolling two or three\r\nat a time between two pieces of hard wood. If the amateur has\r\ndifficulty in procuring this wire, the entire core may be\r\npurchased ready-made.\r\n\r\nAfter the core wires are bundled, the core is wrapped with one or\r\ntwo layers of manila paper. The straighter the wire the more iron\r\nwill enter into the construction of the core, which is desirable.\r\nBeginning half an inch from one end, No. 16 cotton-covered magnet\r\nwire is wound from one end to the other evenly and then returned,\r\nmaking two layers, and the terminals tied down to the core with\r\ntwine. Core and primary are then immersed in boiling paraffine wax\r\nto which a small quantity of resin and beeswax has been added.\r\nThis same wax may be used later in sealing the completed coil into\r\na box. Over this primary is now wrapped one layer of okonite tape,\r\nor same thickness of heavily shellacked muslin. This completed\r\nprimary will now allow of slipping into the hole in the secondary.\r\n\r\nShould the secondary have been purchased without a case, a wooden\r\nbox of mahogany or oak is made, large enough to contain the\r\nsecondary and with an inch to spare all around, with room also for\r\na small condenser; but if it is not convenient to do this work, a\r\nbox like that shown in Fig. 2 may be purchased at a small cost. A\r\n7/8-in. hole is bored in the center of one end, through which the\r\nprimary core projects 1/8 in. This core is to be used to attract\r\nmagnetically the iron head of a vibrating interrupter, which is an\r\nimportant factor of the coil. This interrupter is shaped as in\r\nFig. 4, and is fastened to the box in such a way that the vibrator\r\nhammer plays in front of the core and also that soldered\r\nconnections may be made inside the box with the screws used in\r\naffixing the vibrator parts to the box. The condenser is made of\r\nfour strips of thin paper, 2 yd. long and 5 in. wide, and a\r\nsufficient quantity of tinfoil. When cut and laid in one\r\ncontinuous length, each piece of tin-foil must overlap the\r\nadjoining piece a half inch, so as to form a continuous electrical\r\ncircuit. In shaping the condenser, one piece of the paper is laid\r\ndown, then the strip of tin-foil, then two strips of paper and\r\nanother layer of foil, and finally the fourth strip of paper. This\r\nmakes a condenser which may be folded, beginning at one end and\r\nbending about 6 in. at a time. The condenser is next wrapped\r\nsecurely with bands of paper or tape, and boiled in pure paraffine\r\nwax for one hour, after which it is pressed under considerable\r\nweight until firm and hard. One of the sheets of tin-foil is to\r\nform one pole of the condenser, and the other sheet, which is\r\ninsulated from the first, forms the other pole or terminal. (This\r\ncondenser material is purchasable in long strips, ready for\r\nassembling.)\r\n\r\nThe wiring diagram, Fig. 3, shows how the connections are made.\r\nThis method of connecting is suitable for all coils up to 1-1/2\r\nin. spark, but for larger coil better results will be obtained by\r\nusing an independent type of interrupter, in which a separate\r\nmagnet is used to interrupt the circuit. Besides the magnetic\r\nvibrators there are several other types, such as the mercury\r\ndash-pot and rotary-commutator types, but these will become better\r\nknown to the amateur as he proceeds in his work and becomes more\r\nexperienced in coil operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Combined Door Bell and Electric Alarm [114]\r\n\r\nThis device consists of a battery and bell connection to an alarm\r\nclock which also acts as a door bell, the whole being mounted on a\r\nboard 18 in. long and 12 in. wide. Referring to the sketch\r\naccompanying this article, the letters indicate as follows: A,\r\nbell; B, battery ; C, switch; D, V-shaped copper strip; E, copper\r\nlever with 1-in. flange turned on one side, whole length, 4 in.;\r\nF, spring to throw lever E down in V-shaped piece to make\r\nconnection; G, lever to hold out E when device is used as a door\r\nbell; lines H, go, one from bell, A, and one from battery, B, to\r\nthe door; I, shelf for clock.\r\n\r\nSee that the ring in the alarm key of the clock works easily, so\r\nthat when it is square across the clock it will drop down. Fasten\r\na piece of copper about\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wiring Disgram]\r\n\r\n1 in. long to key, then wind the alarm just enough so that the key\r\nstands straight up and down. Place the clock on the shelf and the\r\nkey under the flange of lever E. Pull lever G down out of the way\r\nand close the lever on the switch. The alarm key will turn and\r\ndrop down, letting lever E drop into the V-shaped piece D and make\r\nconnection.\r\n\r\nFor the door-bell connection close lever on switch C, and put G up\r\nso that D and E do not come in contact. If anyone is ill and you\r\ndo not want the bell to ring, open switch C.\r\n\r\nThe wiring for this device may all be on the back of the board.\r\nThe switch and levers are fastened with small screw bolts, which\r\nallows wiring at the back. Saw two spools in half and fasten the\r\nhalves to the four corners of the board at the back, and the\r\napparatus may be put up where one likes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**v To Build a Small Brass Furnace [115]\r\n\r\nBend a piece of stout sheet iron 23 in. by 12 in. round so that\r\nthe inside\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Furnace]\r\n\r\ndiameter is 7 in., and then rivet the seam. Fit in a round piece\r\nof sheet iron for the bottom. Make a hole about the size of a\r\nshilling in the side, 2 in. from the bottom. This is for blowing.\r\n\r\nLine the furnace, bottom and sides with fire-clay to a depth of\r\n1/2 in. Use charcoal to burn and an ordinary bellows for blowing,\r\nsays the Model Engineer, London. The best blast is obtained by\r\nholding the nozzle of the bellows about an inch from the hole,\r\ninstead of close to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Avoid Paper Lamp Shades [115]\r\n\r\nDon\'t wrap paper around a lamp for a shade. You might go away and\r\nforget it and a fire might be started from the heat. Use a glass\r\nor metal shade. That is what they are for.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Why Gravity Batteries Fail to Work [115]\r\n\r\nMany amateur electricians and some professionals have had\r\nconsiderable trouble with gravity batteries. They\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Setting Up a Gravity Battery]\r\n\r\nfollow directions carefully and then fail to get good results.\r\nThe usual trouble is not with the battery itself, but with the\r\ncircuit. A gravity battery is suitable only for a circuit which is\r\nnormally closed. It is therefore undesirable for electric bells,\r\ninduction coils and all other open-circuit apparatus. The circuit\r\nshould also have a high resistance. This makes it impractical for\r\nrunning fan motors, as the motor would have to be wound with fine\r\nwire and it would then require a large number of batteries to give\r\na sufficiently high voltage.\r\n\r\nTo set up a gravity battery: Use about 3-1/2 lb. of blue stone, or\r\nenough to cover the copper element 1 in. Pour in water sufficient\r\nto cover the zinc 1/2 in. Short-circuit for three hours, and the\r\nbattery is ready for use. If desired for use immediately, do not\r\nshort-circuit, but add 5 or 6 oz. of zinc sulphate.\r\n\r\nKeep the dividing line between the blue and white liquids about\r\n1/2 in. below the bottom of the zinc. If too low, siphon off some\r\nof the white liquid and add the same amount of water, but do not\r\nagitate or mix the two solutions. This type of battery will give\r\nabout 0.9 of a volt, and should be used on a circuit of about 100\r\nmilli-amperes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Skidoo-Skidee Trick [116]\r\n\r\nIn a recent issue or Popular Mechanics an article on "The Turning\r\nCard Puzzle" was described and illustrated. Outside of the\r\nscientific side involved, herein I describe a much better trick.\r\nAbout the time when the expression "skidoo" first began to be used\r\nI Invented the following trick and\r\n\r\n[Illustration: How to Cut the Notches]\r\n\r\ncalled it "Skidoo" and "Skidee," which created much merriment.\r\nUnless the trick is thoroughly understood, for some it will turn\r\none way, for others the opposite way, while for others it will not\r\nrevolve at all. One person whom I now recall became red in the\r\nface by shouting skidoo and skidee at it, but the thing would not\r\nmove at all, and he finally from vexation threw the trick into the\r\nfire and a new one had to be made. Very few can make it turn both\r\nways at will, and therein is the trick.\r\n\r\nTake a piece of hardwood 3/8 in. square and about 9 in. long. On\r\none of the edges cut a series of notches as indicated in Fig. 1.\r\nThen slightly taper the end marked B until it is nicely rounded as\r\nshown in Fig. 2. Next make an arm of a two-arm windmill such as\r\nboys make. Make a hole through the center or this one arm. Enlarge\r\nthe hole slightly, enough to allow a common pin to hold the arm to\r\nthe end B and not interfere with the revolving arm. Two or three\r\nof these arms may have to be made before one is secured that is of\r\nthe exact proportions to catch the vibrations right.\r\n\r\nTo operate the trick, grip the stick firmly in one hand, and with\r\nthe forward and backward motion of the other allow the first\r\nfinger to slide along the top edge, the second finger along the\r\nside, and the thumb nail will then vibrate along the notches, thus\r\nmaking the arm revolve in one direction. To make the arm revolve\r\nin the opposite direction--keep the hand moving all the time, so\r\nthe observer will not detect the change which the hand makes\r\n--allow the first finger to slide along the top, as in the other\r\nmovement, the thumb and second finger changing places: e. g., In\r\nthe first movement you scratch the notches with the thumb nail\r\nwhile the hand is going from the body, and in the second movement\r\nyou scratch the notches with the nail of the second finger when\r\nthe hand is coming toward the body, thus producing two different\r\nvibrations.

It is usually understood that this\r\nbranch of photography means an expensive apparatus. If the worker\r\nis not after too high a magnification, however, there is a very\r\nsimple and effective means of making photomicrographs which\r\nrequires no additional apparatus that cannot be easily and quickly\r\nconstructed at home.\r\n\r\nReproduced with this article is a photograph of dandelion seeds --\r\na magnification of nine diameters or eighty-one times. The\r\napparatus which produced this photograph consisted of a camera of\r\nfairly long draw, a means for holding it vertical, a short-focus\r\nlens, and, if possible, but not essential, a means for focusing\r\nthat lens in a minute manner. On top of the tripod is the folding\r\narrangement, which is easily constructed at home with two hinged\r\nboards, an old tripod screw, an old bed plate from a camera for\r\nthe screw to fit in, and two sliding brass pieces with sets crews\r\nthat may be purchased from any hardware store under the name of\r\ndesk sliding braces. To the front board is attached a box,\r\ncarrying the lens and the bed of the sliding object carrier, which\r\ncan be moved forward and back by the rack and pinion, that also\r\ncan be obtained from hardware stores. If the bed for the object\r\ncarrier be attached to the bed of the camera instead of to the\r\nfront board, the object carrier need have no independent movement\r\nof its own, focusing being done by the front and\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Enlargement with a Camera]\r\n\r\nback focus of the camera; but this is less satisfactory,\r\nparticularly when accurate dimensions are to be determined, says\r\nthe Photographic Times. This outfit need not be confined to seeds\r\nalone, but small flowers, earth, chemicals, insects, and the\r\nthousand and one little things of daily life--all make beautiful\r\nsubjects for enlarged photographs. These cannot be made by taking\r\nan ordinary photograph and enlarging through a lantern. When a\r\ngelatine dry plate is magnified nine diameters, the grains of\r\nsilver in the negative will be magnified also and produce a result\r\nthat will not stand\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Magnified Nine Diameters]\r\n\r\nclose examination. Photographs made by photomicrography can be\r\nexamined like any other photographs and show no more texture than\r\nwill any print.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Steel Pen Used in Draftsman\'s Ink Bottle Cork [117]\r\n\r\nA steel pen makes an ideal substitute for a quill in the stopper\r\nof the draftsman\'s ink bottle.

Goddard Jorgensen\r\n\r\nUnusual interest is being displayed in ballooning, and as it is\r\nfast becoming the favorite sport many persons would like to know\r\nhow to construct a miniature balloon for making experiments. The\r\nfollowing table will give the size, as well as the capacity and\r\nlifting power of pilot balloons:\r\n\r\nDiameter.   Cap. in Cu. Ft   Lifting Power.\r\n  5 ft.          65              4 lb.\r\n  6 ft.         113              7 lb.\r\n  7 ft.         179             11 lb.\r\n  8 ft.         268             17 1b.\r\n  9 ft.         381             24 lb.\r\n 10 ft.         523             33 lb.\r\n 11 ft.         697             44 lb.\r\n 12 ft.         905             57 lb.\r\n\r\nThe material must be cut in suitable shaped gores or segments. In\r\nthis article we shall confine ourselves to a 10-ft. balloon. If\r\nthe balloon is 10 ft. in diameter, then the circumference will be\r\napproximately 3-1/7 times the diameter, or 31 ft. 5 in. We now\r\ntake one-half this length to make the length of the gore, which is\r\n15 ft. 7-1/2 in. Get a piece of paper 15 ft. 7-1/2 in. long and 3\r\nft. wide from which to cut a pattern, Fig. 1. A line, AB, is drawn\r\nlengthwise and exactly in the middle of the paper, and a line, CD,\r\nis drawn at right angles to AB and in the middle of the paper\r\nlengthways. The intersecting point of AB and CD is used for a\r\ncenter to ascribe a circle whose diameter is the same as the width\r\nof the paper, or 3 ft. Divide one-quarter of the circle\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pattern for Cutting the Segments]\r\n\r\ninto 10 equal parts and also divide one-half of the line AB in 10\r\nequal parts. Perpendicular lines are drawn parallel with the line\r\nCD intersecting the division points made on the one-half line AB.\r\nHorizontal and parallel lines with AB are drawn intersecting the\r\ndivision points made on the one-quarter circle and intersecting\r\nthe perpendicular line drawn parallel with CD. A line is now drawn\r\nfrom B to E and from E to F, and so on, until all the intersecting\r\nlines are touched and the point C is reached. This will form the\r\nproper curve to cut the pattern. The paper is now folded on the\r\nline AB and then on the line CD, keeping the marked part on the\r\noutside. The pattern is now cut, cutting all four quarters at the\r\nsame time, on the curved line from B to C. When the paper is\r\nunfolded you will have a pattern as shown in Fig. 2. This pattern\r\nis used to mark the cloth, and after marked is cut the same shape\r\nand size.\r\n\r\nThe cloth segments are sewed together, using a fine needle and No.\r\n70 thread, making a double seam as shown in Fig. 3. When all seams\r\nare completed you will have a bag the shape shown in Fig. 4. A\r\nsmall portion of one end or a seam must be left open for\r\ninflating. A small tube made from the cloth and sewed into one end\r\nwill make a better place for inflating and to tie up tightly.\r\n\r\nIt is now necessary to varnish the bag in order to make it retain\r\nthe gas. Procure 1 gal. of the very best heavy body, boiled\r\nlinseed oil and immerse the bag in it. The surplus oil is squeezed\r\nout by running the bag through an ordinary clothes wringer several\r\ntimes. The bag is now placed in the sun for a thorough drying. Put\r\nthe remaining oil in a kettle with 1/8 lb. of beeswax and boil\r\nwell together. This solution is afterward diluted with turpentine\r\nso it will work well. When the bag is dry apply this mixture by\r\nrubbing it on the bag with a piece of flannel. Repeat this\r\noperation four times,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sewing Segments Together]\r\n\r\nbeing sure of a thorough drying in the sun each time. For indoor\r\ncoating and drying use a small amount of plumbic oxide. This will\r\ndry rapidly in the shade and will not make the oil hard.\r\n\r\nFill the bag with air by using a pair of bellows and leave it over\r\nnight. This test will show if the bag is airtight. If it is not\r\ntight then the bag needs another rubbing. The next operation is to\r\nfill the bag with gas.\r\n\r\nHydrogen gas is made from iron and sulphuric acid. The amounts\r\nnecessary for a 10-ft. balloon are 125 lb. of iron borings and 125\r\nlb. of sulphuric acid. 1 lb. of iron, 1 lb. of sulphuric acid and\r\n4 lb. of water will make 4 cu. ft. of gas in one hour. Secure two\r\nempty barrels of about 52 gal. capacity and connect them, as shown\r\nin Fig. 5, with 3/4-in. pipe. In the barrel, A, place the iron\r\nborings and fill one-half full of clear water. Fill the other\r\nbarrel, B, with water 2 in. above the level of the water in barrel\r\nA. This is to give a water pressure head against foaming when the\r\ngenerator is in action. About 15 lb. of lime should be well mixed\r\nwith the water in the barrel B. All\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5; The Hydrogen Generator]\r\n\r\njoints must be sealed with plaster of Paris. Pour in one-half of\r\nthe acid into the barrel, A, with the iron borings. The barrels\r\nare kept tight while the generation is going on with the exception\r\nof the outlet, C, to the bag. When the action is stopped in the\r\ngenerator barrel, A, let the solution run out and fill again as\r\nbefore with water and acid on the iron borings. The outlet, C,\r\nshould be always connected with the bag while the generator is in\r\naction. The 3/4-in. pipe extending down into the cooling tank, B,\r\nshould not enter into the water over 8 in. When filled with gas\r\nthe balloon is ready for a flight at the will of the operator.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Clean a Clock [119]\r\n\r\nIt is very simple to clean a clock, which may sound rather absurd.\r\nFor an amateur it is not always necessary to take the clock to\r\npieces. With a little care and patience and using some benzine, a\r\nclean white rag, a sable brush and some oil a clock can be cleaned\r\nand put into first-class running order. The benzine should be\r\nclean and free from oil. You can test benzine by putting a little\r\non the back of the hand; if it is good it will dry off, leaving\r\nthe hand quite clean, but if any grease remains on the hand, it is\r\nnot fit to use.\r\n\r\nThe oil should be of the very best that can be procured. Vegetable\r\noils should never be used. Clock oil can be procured from your\r\ndruggist or jeweler.\r\n\r\nAll loose dirt should be removed from the works by blowing with\r\nbellows, or a fan, or dusting with a dry brush; in the latter case\r\ngreat care should be exercised not to injure any of the parts. Dip\r\nthe brush in the benzine and clean the spindles and spindle holes,\r\nand the teeth of the escapement wheel. After washing a part, wipe\r\nthe brush on the rag and rinse in the benzine; this should be\r\nrepeated frequently, until no more dirt is seen.\r\n\r\nWhen the clock has dried, oil the spindle holes carefully; this\r\nmay be done with a toothpick or a sliver of woodcut to a fine\r\npoint. Oil the tooth of the escapement wheel slightly, using a\r\nfine brush.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make Blueprint Lantern Slides [120]\r\n\r\nLantern slides of a blue tone that is a pleasing variety from the\r\nusual black may be made from spoiled or old plates which have not\r\nbeen developed, by fixing, washing well and then dipping five\r\nminutes in the following solution:\r\n\r\n    A. Green Iron ammonium citrate    150 gr.\r\n       Water                            1 oz.\r\n\r\n    B.

Dry the plates in the dark, and keep in\r\nthe dark until used. Printing is done in the sun, and a vigorous\r\nnegative must be used, says the Moving Picture World. Exposure, 20\r\nto 30 minutes. Wash 10 minutes in running water and dry. Brown or\r\npurple tones may be had by sensitizing with the following solution\r\ninstead of the above:\r\n\r\n    Distilled water            1 oz.\r\n    Sliver nitrate            50 gr.\r\n    Tartaric or citric acid  1/2 oz.\r\n\r\nBathe the plates 5 minutes, keeping  the fingers out of the\r\nsolution, to avoid blackened skin.

JOERIN\r\n\r\nAn efficient wireless-telegraph receiving apparatus for distances\r\nup to 1,000 ft. may be constructed in the following manner: Attach\r\na watchcase telephone receiver to a dry cell, or battery, of any\r\nmake. The negative pole, or zinc, of the cell is connected to a\r\nground wire. This is done by attaching to a gas or water pipe. The\r\npositive pole, or carbon, of the cell is connected to the aerial\r\nline. This aerial collector can be made in various ways, either by\r\nusing a screen wire or numerous wires\r\n\r\n[Illustration: For Distances up to 1000 Feet]\r\n\r\nmade in an open coil and hung in the air. File a V-shaped groove\r\nin the upper end of the carbon of the cell. Attach a small bent\r\ncopper wire in the binding post that is attached to the zinc of\r\nthe cell. In the bend of this wire and the V-shaped groove filed\r\ninto the carbon, lay a needle. This will complete the receiving\r\nstation. Use a spark coil in connection with a telegraph key for\r\nthe sending station, making a ground with one wire, and have the\r\nother connected with another aerial line.\r\n\r\nBy connecting the telephone receiver to the cell and at the same\r\ntime having a short circuit a receiving station is made. As the\r\ntelephone offers a high resistance, part of the current will try\r\nto take the shorter high resistance through the needle. If the\r\nwaves strike across the needle, the resistance is less, and thus\r\nless current travels through the telephone receiver. If the wave\r\nceases, the resistance between the needle and the carbon is\r\nincreased, and as less current will flow the short way, it is\r\ncompelled to take the longer metallic way through the windings of\r\nthe receiver, which will cause the clickings that can be heard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** To Preserve Putty [121]\r\n\r\nPutty, when left exposed to the air, will soon become dry and\r\nuseless. I have kept putty in good condition for more than a year\r\nby placing it in a glass jar and keeping it entirely covered with\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Small Storage Battery [121]\r\n\r\nThe cell of a storage battery consists of two plates, a positive\r\nand a negative, made of lead and placed in a dilute solution of\r\nsulphuric acid. Large batteries made of large cells have a great\r\nnumber of plates, both positive and negative, of which all\r\npositive plates are connected to one terminal and the negative\r\nplates to the other terminal. The storage cell, as described\r\nbelow, is the right size to be charged by a few gravity cells and\r\nis easily made.\r\n\r\nSecure a piece of 1-3/4-in. lead pipe, 5 in. long, and cut both\r\nends smooth and square with the pipe. Solder a circular disk of\r\nlead to one end, forming a cup of the pipe. As this cup must hold\r\nthe sulphuric acid it must be perfectly liquid-tight. It is also\r\nnecessary to get another lead pipe of the same length but only\r\n3/4-in. in diameter. In this pipe should be bored as many 1/8-in.\r\nholes\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Battery]\r\n\r\nas possible, except for about 1 in. on each end. One end of this\r\ntube is hammered together as shown at A in the sketch to make a\r\npocket to hold the paste. This, of course, does not need to be\r\nwatertight.\r\n\r\nA box of wood is made to hold the larger tube or cup. This box can\r\nbe square, and the corners left open around the cup can be filled\r\nwith sawdust. A support is now made from a block of wood to hold\r\nthe tube, B, in place and to keep it from touching the cup C. This\r\nsupport or block, D, is cut circular with the same diameter as the\r\nlead cup C. The lower portion of the block is cut away so it will\r\njust fit inside of the cup to form a stopper. The center of this\r\nblock is now bored to make a hole the same size as the smaller\r\nlead pipe. Place the lead pipe in the hole and immerse it in\r\nsmoking hot paraffine wax, and leave it until the wood has become\r\nthoroughly saturated with the hot wax. Use care to keep the wax\r\nfrom running on the lead at any place other than the end within\r\nthe wood block. Two binding-posts should be attached, one to the\r\npositive, or tube B, and the other to the negative, or tube C, by\r\nsoldering the joint.\r\n\r\nA paste for the positive plate is made from 1 part sulphuric acid\r\nand 1 part water with a sufficient amount of red lead added to\r\nmake of thick dry consistency. When mixing the acid and water, be\r\nsure to add the acid to the water and not the water to the acid.\r\nAlso remember that sulphuric acid will destroy anything that it\r\ncomes in contact with and will make a painful burn if it touches\r\nthe hands. Stir the mixture with a stick and when a good dry paste\r\nis formed, put it into the smaller tube and ram it down until the\r\ntube is almost filled. The paste that may have come through the\r\nholes is scraped off and the tube set aside to dry. The large tube\r\nor cup is filled with a diluted solution of sulphuric acid. This\r\nsolution should be about one-twelfth acid. The cell is now\r\ncomplete and ready for storing the current.\r\n\r\nThe cell may be charged with three gravity cells. These are\r\nconnected in series and the positive terminal binding-post on the\r\nstorage cell is connected to the wire leading from the copper\r\nplate in the gravity cell. The other plate is connected to the\r\nzinc. The first charge should be run into the cell for about one\r\nweek and all subsequent charges should only take from 10 to 12\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Fitting a Plug in Different Shaped Holes [122]\r\n\r\nA certain king offered to give the prince his liberty if he could\r\nwhittle a plug that would fit four different shaped holes, namely:\r\na square hole, a round one, an oblong one and a triangular one,\r\nsays the Pathfinder.

It has the advantage of being\r\nrowed from either end, and has plenty of good seating capacity.\r\n\r\nThis punt, as shown in Fig. 1, is built 15 ft. long, about 20 in.\r\ndeep and 4 ft. wide. The ends are cut sloping for about 20 in.\r\nback and under. The sides are each made up from boards held\r\ntogether with battens on the inside of the boat near the ends and\r\nin the middle. One wide board should be used for the bottom piece.\r\nTwo pins are driven in the top board of each side to serve as\r\noarlocks.\r\n\r\nThe bottom is covered with matched boards not over 5 in. wide.\r\nThese pieces are placed together as closely as possible, using\r\nwhite lead between the joints and nailing them to the edges of the\r\nside boards and to a keel strip that runs the length of the punt,\r\nas shown in Fig. 2. Before nailing the boards place lamp wicking\r\nbetween them and the edges of the side boards. Only galvanized\r\nnails should be used. In order to make the punt perfectly\r\nwatertight it is best to use the driest lumber obtainable. At one\r\nend of the punt a skag and a rudder can be attached as shown in\r\nFig. 3.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Easy to Build and Safe to Use]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Photographers\' Printing Frame Stand [123]\r\n\r\nWhen using developing papers it is always bothersome to build up\r\nbooks or\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Adjustable to Any Height]\r\n\r\nsmall boxes to make a place to set the printing frame in front of\r\nthe light. Details for making a small stand that is adjustable to\r\nany desired height are shown in the sketch. In Fig. 1 is shown the\r\nconstruction of the sliding holder. A piece of 1/4-in. gas pipe,\r\nA, is cut 1 in. long and fitted with a thumbscrew, B. The piece of\r\npipe is soldered to the middle on the back side of a piece of\r\nmetal that is about 4 by 4-1/2 in. with its lower edge turned up\r\nto form a small shelf as shown at C. The main part of the stand is\r\nmade by inserting a 5/16-in. rod tightly into a block of hard\r\nmaple wood that is 1 in. thick and 3-1/2 in. square (Fig 2).

H. Bell\r\n\r\nThe following notes on a small single-phase induction motor,\r\nwithout auxiliary phase, which the writer has made, may be of\r\ninterest to some of our readers, says the Model Engineer. The\r\nproblem to be solved was the construction of a motor large enough\r\nto drive a sewing machine or very light lathe, to be supplied with\r\n110-volt alternating current from a lighting circuit, and to\r\nconsume, if possible, no more current than a 16-cp. lamp. In\r\ndesigning, it had to be borne in mind that, with the exception of\r\ninsulated wire, no special materials could be obtained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Motor]\r\n\r\nThe principle of an induction motor is quite different from that\r\nof the commutator motor. The winding of the armature, or "rotor,"\r\nhas no connection with the outside circuit, but the current is\r\ninduced in it by the action of the alternating current supplied to\r\nthe winding of the field-magnet, or "stator." Neither commutator\r\nnor slip rings are required, and all sparking is avoided.\r\nUnfortunately, this little machine is not self-starting, but a\r\nslight pull on the belt just as the current is turned on is all\r\nthat is needed, and the motor rapidly gathers speed provided no\r\nload is put on until it is in step with the alternations of the\r\nsupply. It then runs at constant speed whether given much or\r\nlittle current, but stops if overloaded for more than a few\r\nseconds.\r\n\r\nThe stator has four poles and is built up of pieces of sheet iron\r\nused for stove pipes, which runs about 35 sheets to the inch. All\r\nthe pieces are alike and cut on the lines with the dimensions as\r\nshown in Fig. 1, with the dotted line, C, to be filed out after\r\nthey are placed together. Each layer of four is placed with the\r\npointed ends of the pieces alternately to the right and left so as\r\nto break joints as shown in Fig. 2. The laminations were carefully\r\nbuilt up on a board into which heavy wires had been driven to keep\r\nthem in place until all were in position and the whole could be\r\nclamped down. In the middle of the pieces 1/4-in. holes, B, were\r\nthen drilled and 1/4-in. bolts put in and tightened up, large\r\nholes being cut through the wood to enable this to be done. The\r\narmature tunnel was then carefully filed out and all taken apart\r\nagain so that the rough edges could be scraped off and the\r\nlaminations given a thin coat of shellac varnish on one side.\r\nAfter assembling a second time, the bolts were coated with shellac\r\nand put into place for good. Holes 5-32 in. in diameter were\r\ndrilled in the corners, A, and filled with rivets, also varnished\r\nbefore they were put in. When put together they should make a\r\npiece 2 in. thick.\r\n\r\nThis peculiar construction was adopted because proper stampings\r\nwere not available, and as every bit of sheet iron had to be cut\r\nwith a small pair of tinners\' snips, it was important to have a\r\nvery simple outline for the pieces. They are not particularly\r\naccurate as it is, and when some of them got out of their proper\r\norder while being varnished, an awkward job occurred in the magnet\r\nwhich was never entirely corrected. No doubt some energy is lost\r\nthrough the large number of joints, all representing breaks in the\r\nmagnetic circuit, but as the laminations are tightly held together\r\nand the circuit is about as compact as it could possibly be,\r\nprobably the loss is not as great as it would appear at first\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nThe rotor is made of laminations cut from sheet iron, as shown in\r\nFig. 3, which were varnished lightly on one side and clamped on\r\nthe shaft between two nuts in the usual way. A very slight cut was\r\ntaken in the lathe afterwards to true the circumference. The shaft\r\nwas turned from 1/2-in. wrought iron, no steel being obtainable,\r\nand is shown with dimensions in Fig. 4. The bearings were cast of\r\nbabbitt metal, as shown in Fig. 5, in a wooden mold and bored to\r\nsize with a twist drill in the lathe. They are fitted with\r\nordinary wick lubricators. Figures 6 and 7 are sections showing\r\nthe general arrangement of the machine.\r\n\r\nThe stator is wound full with No. 22 double cotton-covered copper\r\nwire,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Motor]\r\n\r\nabout 2-1/2 lb. being used, and the connections are such as to\r\nproduce alternate poles--that is, the end of the first coil is\r\njoined to the end of the second the beginning of the second to the\r\nbeginning of the third, and the end of the third to the end of the\r\nfourth, while the beginnings of the first and fourth coils connect\r\nto the supply.\r\n\r\nThe rotor is wound with No. 24 double cotton-covered copper wire,\r\neach limb being filled with about 200 turns, and all wound in the\r\nsame direction. The four commencing ends are connected together on\r\none side of the rotor and the four finishing ends are soldered\r\ntogether on the other. All winding spaces are carefully covered\r\nwith two layers of cambric soaked in shellac, and as each layer of\r\nwire was wound, it was well saturated with varnish before the next\r\nwas put on.\r\n\r\nThis type of motor has drawbacks, as before stated, but if regular\r\nstampings are used for the laminations, it would be very simple to\r\nbuild, having no commutator or brushes, and would not easily get\r\nout of order. No starting resistance is needed, and as the motor\r\nruns at constant speed, depending upon the number of alternations\r\nof the supply, a regulating resistance is not needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Carbolic Acid Burns [126]\r\n\r\nThe pain of carbolic acid burns can be relieved promptly by\r\nwashing with alcohol, if applied immediately.

A paper cover can be quickly made by using\r\na piece of paper larger than both covers on the book when they are\r\nopen. Fold the paper on the long dotted line, as shown in Fig. 1.\r\nWhen the folds are made the paper should then be just as wide as\r\nthe book cover is high. The ends are then folded on the short\r\ndotted lines, which will make it appear as shown in Fig. 2. The\r\npaper thus folded is placed on the book cover as shown in Fig. 3.\r\n--Contributed by C. E.

The lantern slide is a glass plate,\r\ncoated with slow and extremely fine-grained emulsion. The size is\r\n3-1/4 by 4 in. A lantern slide is merely a print on a glass plate\r\ninstead of on paper. Lantern slides can be made in two different\r\nways. One is by contact, exactly the same as a print is made on\r\npaper, and the other by reduction in the camera. In making slides\r\nby contact, select the negative and place it in the printing frame\r\nand put the lantern plate upon it, film to film. Clamp down the\r\nback and expose just as in making a print. A good method of\r\nexposing is to hold a lighted match about 3 in. from the frame for\r\nthree or more seconds according to the density.\r\n\r\nDevelopment is carried on in the same manner as with a negative.\r\nThe image should appear in. about a minute, and development should\r\nbe over in three or four minutes. If the exposure has been\r\ncorrect, the high lights will stay white throughout the\r\ndevelopment and will come out as clear glass after fixing. It is\r\nbest to use the developers recommended by the manufacturer of the\r\nplates used, the formulas being found in each package of plates.\r\nIt is best, also, to use a plain fixing bath, which must be fresh\r\nand kept as cool as possible in hot weather.\r\n\r\nThe lantern-slide film that is new on the market can be handled in\r\nthe same manner as the glass-plate slide, except that the binding\r\nis different. The results are the same and the slides are not so\r\nbulky to handle. Being unbreakable, they are much used by\r\ntravelers. The manner of binding them for use in a lantern is\r\ndescribed on the circular enclosed with the film.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Camera as It is Arranged in Front of the Window\r\nfor Reducing the Size of a Picture, and the Method of Binding the\r\nSlides]\r\n\r\nWhen the negative is larger than the lantern-slide plate, and it\r\nis desirable to reduce the entire view upon the slide, a little\r\nextra work will be necessary. Select a room with one window, if\r\npossible, and fit a light-proof frame into it to keep out all\r\nlight with the exception of a hole in which to place the negative,\r\nas shown in Fig. 1. Unless this hole is on a line with the sky it\r\nwill be necessary to place a sheet of white cardboard at an angle\r\nof 45 deg. on the outside of the frame to reflect the light\r\nthrough the negative as shown in Fig. 2. Make or secure an inside\r\nkit to place in the plate holder of your camera to hold the\r\nlantern slide plate as shown in Fig. 3. Draw lines with a pencil,\r\noutlining on the ground glass of the camera the size of the\r\nlantern slide plate, and in the place where the plate will be in\r\nthe plate holder when placed in position in the camera. This will\r\nenable you to focus to the proper size. Place the camera in front\r\nof the hole in the frame, place the negative in the hole and focus\r\nthe camera for the lantern slide size. Expose with a medium stop\r\nfor about 20 seconds and treat the plate the same as with the\r\ncontact exposure.\r\n\r\nWhen dry the lantern slide plate may be tinted any color by means\r\nof liquid colors. These can be purchased from any photo material\r\nstore. In coloring the slide plate it is only necessary to moisten\r\nthe gelatine film from time to time with a piece of cloth dampened\r\nin water. The colors may then be spread evenly with a soft brush,\r\nwhich should be kept in motion to prevent spots.\r\n\r\nThe slide is put together by placing a mat made of black paper, as\r\nshown in Fig. 4, on the gelatine side of the lantern slide, A,\r\nFig. 5, and then a plain glass, B, over the mat, C, and the three\r\nbound together with passepartout tape, D. Contrasty negatives make\r\nthe best slides, but the lantern slide plate should be made\r\nwithout any attempt to gain density.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** HOW TO MAKE A PORCH SWING CHAIR [128]\r\n\r\nThe material needed for making this porch swing chair are two\r\npieces of round wood 2-1/2 in. in diameter and 20 in. long, and\r\ntwo pieces 1-1/4 in. in diameter and 40 in. long. These longer\r\npieces can be made square, but for appearance it is best to have\r\nthem round or square with the corners rounded. A piece of canvas,\r\nor other stout cloth, 16 in. wide and 50 in. long, is to be used\r\nfor the seat. The two short pieces of wood are used for the ends\r\nof the chair and two 1-in. holes are bored in each end of them\r\n1-1/2 in. from the ends, and between the holes and the ends\r\ngrooves are cut around them to make a place to fasten ropes, as\r\nshown at B, Fig. 1. The two longer pieces are used for the sides\r\nand a tenon is cut on each end of them to fit in the 1-in. holes\r\nbored in the end pieces, as shown at A, Fig. 1. The canvas is now\r\ntacked on the end pieces and the pieces given one turn before\r\nplacing the mortising together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Swing Chair]\r\n\r\nThe chair is now hung up to the porch ceiling with ropes attached\r\nto a large screw eye or hook. The end of the chair to be used for\r\nthe lower part is held about 16 in. from the floor with ropes\r\ndirect from the grooves in the end pieces to the hook. The upper\r\nend is supported by using a rope in the form of a loop or bail, as\r\nshown in Fig. 2. The middle of the loop or bail should be about 15\r\nin. from the end piece of the chair. Another rope is attached to\r\nthe loop and through the hook and to a slide as shown. This will\r\nallow for adjustment to make the device into a chair or a hammock.\r\n--Contributed by Earl R.

If the star\r\nis in front of the left eye, close the right eye and look steadily\r\nat the star while you move the cardboard until the point is\r\nreached where the dot disappears. This will prove the presence of\r\na blind spot in a person\'s eye. The other eye can be given the\r\nsame experiment by turning the cardboard end for end. The blind\r\nspot does not indicate diseased eyes, but it simply marks the\r\npoint where the optic nerve enters the eyeball, which point is not\r\nprovided with the necessary visual end organs of the sight, known\r\nas rods and cones.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Beeswax Substitute [129]\r\n\r\nA wax from the rafie palm of Madagascar is being used as a\r\nsubstitute for beeswax.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Home-Made Water Wheel Does Family Washing [129]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Water Wheel]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying sketch illustrates a very ingenious device which\r\ndoes the family washing, as well as to operate other household\r\nmachines. A disk 1 in. in thickness and 10 in. in diameter was cut\r\nfrom a piece of rough board, and on its circumference were nailed\r\na number of cup-shaped pieces cut from old tin cans. A hole was\r\nthen bored through the center of the disk and an old piece of iron\r\nrod was driven through to form a shaft. Two holes were then bored\r\nopposite each other through the sides of a wooden box in which the\r\ndisk was placed, allowing the shaft to project through the holes.\r\nA small grooved wooden pulley was driven tightly on one of the\r\nprojecting ends of the shaft. The top of the box was then tightly\r\nclosed and a hole, large enough to admit the nozzle of a garden\r\nhose, was bored so that the jet of water would flow upon the tin\r\nbuckets that were nailed to the circumference of the wheel or\r\ndisk. Another hole was bored in the bottom of the box large enough\r\nto allow the waste water to run away freely. A belt, made from an\r\nordinary sash cord, was run from the small pulley on the\r\nwaterwheel to a large pulley, as shown in Fig. 1. A pitman was\r\nattached to the large pulley, which operates the washing machine\r\nby its reciprocating motion, and the length of the stroke is\r\nadjusted by moving the position of the hinge joint on the arm of\r\nthe washing machine, as shown in Fig. 2. The pressure at the\r\nnozzle is about 20 lb. per square inch, and is sufficient to drive\r\nthe waterwheel under all ordinary circumstances.\r\n--Contributed by P. J. O\'Gara, Auburn, Cal,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** An Optical Illusion [130]\r\n\r\nWhen looking at the accompanying sketch you will say that the\r\nletters are alternately inclined to the right and left. They are\r\nnot so and can be proved by measuring the distance of the top and\r\nbottom of any vertical strokes from the edge of the entire block.\r\nThey will be found to be exactly the same distance. Or take any of\r\nthe horizontal strokes of the four letters and see how far their\r\nextremities are from the top and bottom of the entire block. It\r\nwill be found that a line joining the extremities of the strokes\r\nare strictly parallel to the top or bottom and that they are not\r\non a slant at all. It is the slant of the numerous short lines\r\nthat go to make up the letter as a whole that deceives the eye.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Illusion]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Home-Made Micrometer [130]\r\n\r\nIt often becomes necessary to find the thickness of material so\r\nthin, or inconvenient to measure, that a rule or other measuring\r\ndevice will not serve the purpose. A simple, fairly accurate, and\r\neasily made apparatus of the micrometer form may be constructed as\r\nshown by the accompanying sketch. Secure a common iron or brass\r\nbolt about 1/4-in. in diameter and about 2-1/2 in. long, with as\r\nfine a thread as possible, and the thread cut to within a short\r\ndistance of the head of the bolt. The head of the bolts should\r\nhave a slot cut for the use of a screwdriver. Clamp together two\r\nblocks of wood with square corners which are about 1 in. wide, 3/4\r\nin. thick and 2-1/2 in. long and fasten them together with small\r\npieces nailed across the ends. The width of the blocks will then\r\nbe about 2 in. Bore a 1/4-in. hole through the center of the\r\nblocks in the 2 in. direction. Remove the clamp and set the nut\r\ninto one of the blocks, so that the hole will be continuous with\r\nthe hole in the wood. Cut out a piece from the block combination,\r\nleaving it shaped like a bench, and glue the bottoms of the legs\r\nto a piece of thin board about 2-1/2 in. square for a support.\r\n\r\nSolder one end of a stiff wire that is about 2 in. long to the\r\nhead of the bolt at right angles to the shaft, and fix a disc of\r\nheavy pasteboard with a radius equal to the length of the wire,\r\nand with its circumference graduated into equal spaces, to serve\r\nin measuring revolutions of the end of the wire, to the top of the\r\nbench. Put the bolt in the hole, screwing it through the nut,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Micrometer]\r\n\r\nand the construction is complete. The base is improved for the\r\nmeasuring work by fastening a small piece of wood on the board\r\nbetween the legs of the bench. A small piece of metal is glued on\r\nthis piece of wood at the point where the bolt meets it.\r\n\r\nFind the number of threads of the screw to the inch by placing the\r\nbolt on a measuring rule, and counting the threads in an inch of\r\nits length. The bolt in making one revolution will descend a\r\ndistance equal to the distance between the threads.\r\n\r\nThe device is used by placing the object whose thickness is to be\r\nmeasured on the base under the bolt, and screwing the bolt down\r\nuntil its end just touches the object, then removing the object,\r\nand screwing the bolt down until its end just touches the base,\r\ncarefully noting while doing so the distance that the end of the\r\nwire moves over the scale. The part of a rotation of the bolt, or\r\nthe number of rotations with any additional parts of a rotation\r\nadded, divided by the number of threads to the inch, will be the\r\nthickness of the object. Quite accurate measurements may be made\r\nwith this instrument, says the Scientific American, and in the\r\nabsence of the expensive micrometer, it serves a very useful\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Another Electric Lamp Experiment [131]\r\n\r\nBreak a portion of the end off from a 16-cp. globe that has been\r\nthrown away as useless.

Bore a 3/4-in. hole in each end to a depth of 6 in. Place a\r\n3/4-in. bolt in each hole, the bolt being long enough to protrude\r\n2 in. beyond the end of the wood. Short pieces of wood are nailed\r\non the center pole about 2 ft. from the end that is to be used for\r\nthe bottom. This should form a hub on which to place the inner\r\nends of the extending spokes that hold the platform. The spokes\r\nare made from twelve pieces of 2 by 4-in. material 12 ft. long.\r\n\r\nUsually a wheel can be found in a scrap pile suitable to place on\r\nthe pin that is in the top end of the center pole. The wheel\r\nshould be open\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Side and Top View]\r\n\r\nor have spokes. This wheel is used to attach wires for guying. The\r\nbottom pin in the center pole is placed in a hole that is bored\r\ninto a block of wood about 12-in. square and 3 or 4 in. thick. A\r\npiece of sheet metal should be drilled and placed on the pin\r\nbetween the block and end of the pole to make a smooth bearing.\r\nThe center pole is now placed in position and guyed with six wires\r\nthat are about 35 ft. long. Stakes are driven into the ground and\r\nthe wires fastened to them and to the wheel at the top end of the\r\npole. Care should be taken when attaching the wires to get the\r\ncenter pole to stand perpendicular. Twelve hooks should be placed\r\nat equal distances around the center pole about 1 ft. from the top\r\nend. Wires are fastened to these hooks and to the twelve 2 by\r\n4-in. pieces used for the spokes. The wires should be tied around\r\neach spoke about 2 ft. from the ends. Space the spokes with equal\r\ndivisions and cover the outer 2 ft. of the ends with boards, as\r\nshown in the plan sketch on the right hand end of the drawing. The\r\nboards may be nailed or bolted. If bolted and the wires made in a\r\nloop at the hooks, the swing can easily be taken apart and changed\r\nfrom one place to another.\r\n--Contributed by A. O.

This frame should be about 10-1/2 in.\r\nlong with the upper or wider part 4 in. long, and the lower part\r\n6-1/2 in. long. The width should be about 5-1/4 in. at\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Arc Lamp]\r\n\r\nthe top and 4 in. at the bottom. A cross bar, L, made of the same\r\nmaterial, is fitted into the off-set in the frame and riveted.\r\nHoles are drilled through the frame and brass bushings, H and J,\r\nare fitted for bearings to receive the adjusting brass rod, B,\r\nwhich should be 1/4 in. in diameter. A brass curtain rod can be\r\nused for the rod B, and on its lower end a socket, P, is soldered.\r\n\r\nA piece of brass 2 in. long, 1/2 in. wide and 1/8 in. thick is\r\nused for the armature, A, to be operated by the magnet coil, C.\r\nThe coil, C, is made in the usual manner by wrapping No. 14\r\ncotton-covered magnet wire on a wooden spool that has a soft iron\r\ncore. The spool is about 2-1/2 in. long. The armature, A, is\r\ndrilled, making a hole just a little larger than the rod, B, and\r\nis adjusted in place by two set screws, D and E. A soft piece of\r\niron, F, is fastened to the opposite end of the armature with a\r\nscrew, which should be placed directly under the end of the coil\'s\r\ncore. This end of the armature may be kept from swinging around by\r\nplacing it between a U-shaped piece of brass fastened to the cross\r\npiece L. At the bottom end of the frame, and directly centering\r\nthe holes H and J, a hole is drilled to receive a hard rubber\r\nbushing, R, for insulating the brass ferrule, S, that holds the\r\nlower carbon.\r\n\r\nOne connection is made from the main to the upper binding-post,\r\nwhich is in turn connected to one terminal of the coil, C, the\r\nother coil terminal being attached to the frame. The other main\r\nconnection is made to the lower binding-post, which is also\r\nconnected to the brass ferrule, S, by soldering. The two\r\nbinding-posts are insulated from the frame the same as the ferrule\r\nS.

The vibrator B, Fig. 1,\r\nand the support C are made from thin spring steel, about 1/8 in.\r\nwide, bent as shown and securely fastened to the cardboard end of\r\nthe coil. The armature is made from a soft piece of iron, about\r\n3/16 in. in diameter and 1/16 in. thick, which is soldered to the\r\nend of the vibrator directly opposite the end of the core. A small\r\nscrew is fitted in the end of the support, C, for adjustment,\r\nwhich should be tipped with platinum and also a small piece of\r\nplatinum placed where the screw will touch the vibrator, B.\r\n\r\nOne of the primary wires is connected to the screw support. The\r\nvibrator, is connected to a flash lamp battery, D. The other\r\nprimary wire is connected to a switch, S, which in turn is\r\nconnected to the other terminal of the battery. The switch, S, may\r\nbe made from a 3/8-in. cork with the wires put through about 3/16\r\nin. apart and allow them to project about 1/2 in. The plate E is\r\ncut about 1/2 in. square from a piece of copper and is fastened to\r\nthe heel of one shoe and connected with a wire from the secondary\r\ncoil which must be concealed inside of the trouser leg. The other\r\nsecondary wire is connected through the coat sleeve to a finger\r\nring, F. The vibrator screw must be properly adjusted. When the\r\nvibrator is not working the armature should be about 1/16 in. from\r\nthe core and directly opposite.\r\n\r\nThe coil when complete will be about 2-1/2 in. long and 1 in. in\r\ndiameter. The coil can be placed in an old box that has been used\r\nfor talcum powder or shaving stick. The space around the coil in\r\nthe box can be filled with paper to keep it tight.\r\n\r\nThe coil and battery are carried in the pockets and the cork\r\nbutton put in the outside coat pocket, where it can be pressed\r\nwithout attracting attention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Experiment with Heat [134]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Heat Experiment]\r\n\r\nPlace a small piece of paper, lighted, in an ordinary water glass.\r\nWhile the paper is burning turn the glass over and set into a\r\nsaucer previously filled with water. The water will rapidly rise\r\nin the glass, as shown in the sketch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Attach a Combination Trunk Lock [134]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Trunk Lock]\r\n\r\nA small combination lock for chests can be purchased for a small\r\nsum of money and attached to a trunk cover after first removing\r\nthe old lock as shown in Fig. 1. It is necessary to add 1/2-in. to\r\nthe thickness of the trunk lid or cover. This may be done by\r\nplacing a brass plate 1/8-in. thick on the outside and a board\r\n3/8-in. thick on the inside. The lock, brass plate, board and\r\ntrunk cover are all securely riveted together. The support for the\r\ndial is soldered to the brass plate.\r\n\r\nThe hasp, if that be the name for the double toothed arrangement\r\nthat catches into the lock, was to be secured by only three brass\r\nscrews, which seemed to be insufficient, says a correspondent of\r\nthe Metal Worker; therefore a piece of heavy tin was formed over\r\nthe front of the trunk, which is only 3/8-in. board, the hasp\r\ntinned and soldered to the back of the now U-shaped tin, and the\r\ntin placed over the board and all fastened in position. The tin is\r\n4 in. wide, 16 in. long and when placed over the board, it laps\r\ndown about 8 in. between the boards, and the same distance inside\r\nof the new board, as shown by the heavy line in the cross section,\r\nFig. 1. Wrought nails are used which pass twice through the tin\r\nand both boards, and then well clinched. The three screws were\r\nthen put in the hasp.\r\n\r\nThe knob on the dial extends out too far, which may be filed off\r\nand two holes substituted, as shown, with which to operate the\r\ndial. An old key is filed down in the shape shown in Fig. 2 to fit\r\nthe two holes.\r\n\r\nAs the dial is convex it will need protection to prevent injury by\r\nrough handling. A leather shield may be used for this purpose,\r\nwhich is cut with two holes, one for the key and the other to\r\npermit the operator to observe the numbers on the dial. The shield\r\nanswers a further purpose of preventing any bystander from noting\r\nthe numbers on the dial.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** AN ELECTRIC ILLUSION BOX [135]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying engravings show a most interesting form of\r\nelectrically operated illusion consisting of a box divided\r\ndiagonally and each division alternately lighted with an electric\r\nlamp. By means of an automatic thermostat arranged in the lamp\r\ncircuit causing the lamps to light successively, an aquarium\r\napparently without fish one moment is in the next instant swarming\r\nwith live gold fish; an empty vase viewed through the opening in\r\nthe box suddenly is filled with flowers, or an empty cigar box is\r\nseen and immediately is filled with cigars.\r\n\r\nThese electric magic boxes as shown are made of metal and oxidized\r\ncopper finished, but for ordinary use they can be made of wood in\r\nthe same shape and size. The upper magic boxes as are shown in the\r\nengraving are about 12 in. square and 8-1/2 in. high for parlor\r\nuse and the lower boxes are 18 in. square and 10-1/2 in. high for\r\nuse in window displays. There is a partition arranged diagonally\r\nin the box as shown in the plan view, which completely divides the\r\nbox into two parts. One-half the partition is fitted with a plain,\r\nclear glass as shown. The partition and interior of the box are\r\nrendered non-reflecting by painting with a dull, not shiny, black\r\ncolor. When making of wood, a door must be provided on the side or\r\nrear to make changes of exhibits. If the box is made large enough,\r\nor in the larger size mentioned, openings may be made in the\r\nbottom for this purpose, and also used in case of performing the\r\nmagic trick of allowing two persons to place their\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Construction of Magic Boxes]\r\n\r\nheads in the box and change from one to the other.\r\n\r\nThe electric globes are inserted as shown at LL through the top of\r\nthe box, one in each division. When the rear part is illuminated,\r\nany article arranged within that part will be visible to the\r\nspectator looking into the box through the front opening, but when\r\nthe front part is illuminated, and the back left dark, any article\r\nplaced therein will be reflected in. the glass, which takes the\r\nsame position to the observer as the one in the rear. Thus a plain\r\naquarium is set in the rear part and one with swimming fish placed\r\nin\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Four Electric Magic Boxes Complete for Use]\r\n\r\nthe front, and with the proper illumination one is changed, as it\r\nappears, into the other. When using as a window display, place the\r\ngoods in one part and the price in the other. Many other changes\r\ncan be made at the will of the operator.\r\n\r\nElectric lamps may be controlled by various means to produce\r\ndifferent effects. Lamps may be connected in parallel and each\r\nturned on or off by means of a hand-operated switch or the button\r\non the lamp socket, or if desired a hand-operated adjustable\r\nresistance may be included in the circuit of each lamp for\r\ngradually causing the object to fade away or reappear slowly.\r\n\r\nInstead of changing the current operated by hand, this may be done\r\nautomatically by connecting the lamps in parallel on the lighting\r\ncircuit and each connected in series with a thermostatic switch\r\nplug provided with a heating coil which operates to automatically\r\nopen and close the circuit through the respective lamp.\r\n\r\nWhen there is no electric current available, matches or candles\r\nmay be used and inserted through the holes H, as shown in the\r\nsketch, alternately.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Replace Dry Putty [136]\r\n\r\nPainting over putty that has not become dry will cause scaling or\r\ncracking around the edges of the putty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Photo Print Washing Tank [136]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying sketch shows a simple form of a print washing\r\ntank that tips from side to side by the weight of the water. For\r\nprints 4 by 5 and 5 by 7-in. a tank 2 ft. long and 1 ft. wide will\r\nbe about the right size. This tank is then divided with a\r\npartition placed exactly in the center. This partition should\r\nextend 3 or 4 in. above the top of the tank. The partition may\r\nalso extend below the tank about 1-1/2 in., or a piece of this\r\nwidth put on the bottom, as shown at A in the sketch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Keeps Prints Constantly Moving]\r\n\r\nA row of holes about 1/2 in. in diameter is bored through each end\r\nof the tank, as shown at B. These holes will allow the water to\r\nspill out while the opposite side is filling. The tank may be made\r\nfrom 1/2-in. material and when completed as shown, lined with oil\r\ncloth to make it watertight. The tank is placed with the partition\r\ndirectly under a water tap and the flow of water will cause it to\r\ntip from time to time, keeping the prints constantly moving about\r\nin the water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Home-Made Soldering Clamps [137]\r\n\r\nTake a cotter pin and bend it over a small rod to bring the points\r\ntogether, as shown in the sketch. This will make a spring clamp\r\nthat is opened to slip over the articles to be clamped together by\r\ninserting a scratch awl or scriber between the legs at the bowed\r\nportion. To make a more positive clamp before bending the legs to\r\na bow, slip a short coil of wire over the pin, passing it down to\r\nthe ring end. Wire 1/32 in. in diameter wound over a wire slightly\r\nlarger in diameter than that of the cotter will do. In soldering,\r\nsmoke the legs well to avoid solder adhering to them. The clamp is\r\ntightened by pushing up the coil ring toward the bow of the legs\r\nand then twisting it like a nut, the coil being wound\r\nright-handed, so that it will have a screw effect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Clamp]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Telephone Experiment [137]\r\n\r\nIf the small apparatus, as shown in the accompanying sketch, is\r\nattached to the under side of an ordinary dining table, it will,\r\nif connected to a telephone circuit, set the table in vibration,\r\nso that any number of people who put their ears flat upon the\r\ntable will hear the voice of a person speaking from a distance,\r\napparently coming out of the table, says the Model Engineer. A\r\nsmall piece of wood, A, Fig. 1, is cut about 5 in. square, to the\r\ncenter of which is attached a small piece of soft iron wire, such\r\nas used for cores\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mechanical Table Talk]\r\n\r\nof induction coils, about 4 in. long and bent in the form of a\r\nhook at the lower end, as shown at B. This wire is attached to the\r\nblock of wood, A, as shown in Fig. 2. The end of the wire is\r\nsoldered to a small brass plate which is set in the block so it\r\nwill be level or flush with the top of the block and then fastened\r\nwith two screws. The block A is fastened to the under side of the\r\ntable with two screws. A small coil, C, is made by winding No. 24\r\nsilk or cotton covered wire around a small tube, either a piece of\r\nglass, a short straw or a quill. The coil is made tapering as\r\nshown without using wood ends. This coil is slipped over the wire\r\nB previous to soldering it to the small brass plate. The ends of\r\nthe coil are connected to two binding-posts which are fastened to\r\nthe block A. A small lead weight weighing 2 or 3 oz. is hung on\r\nthe hook made in the lower end of the wire B.\r\n\r\nWhen all connections are made, as shown in Fig. 1, and the block\r\nfastened to the under side of the table, the apparatus is ready\r\nfor use, and has only to be connected to an ordinary telephone\r\ntransmitter and batteries as shown. The apparatus will work to a\r\ncertain extent even if the weight is removed, though not so clear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Wax Wood Screws [137]\r\n\r\nSome workmen use tallow on lag or wood screws. Try beeswax for\r\nthis purpose. It is much cleaner to use and is just as good if not\r\nbetter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make an Induction Coil [138]\r\n\r\nA small shocking coil, suitable for medical purposes, may be\r\nconstructed of materials found in nearly every amateur mechanic\'s\r\ncollection of odds and ends. The core, A, Fig. 1, is a piece of\r\nround soft iron rod about 1/4 in. in diameter and about 4 in.\r\nlong. A strip of stiff paper about 3/4 in. wide is covered with\r\nglue and wrapped around one end of the core, as shown at B, until\r\nthe diameter is about 3/8 in. The portion of the core remaining\r\nuncovered is then wrapped with a piece of paper about 4 in. wide.\r\nNo glue is used on this piece, as it is removed later to form the\r\nspace, C, after the paper shell, D, has been wound upon it. This\r\npaper shell is made of stiff paper and glue the same as B and is\r\nmade about 3/64 in. thick. Two pieces of hardwood, EE, 1-3/4 in.\r\nsquare and about 5/16 in. thick, are drilled in the center and\r\nglued on the ends of the paper shell as shown.\r\n\r\nThe primary winding consists of 4 or 5 layers of No. 18 or 20\r\nsingle cotton-covered magnet wire, the ends of which may be passed\r\nthrough small holes in the wooden ends. If a drill small enough is\r\nnot available, the holes may be made with a hot knitting needle or\r\na piece of wire heated to redness. After the primary coil is wound\r\nit should be thoroughly insulated before winding the secondary.\r\nThis may be done by wrapping with 4 or 5 thicknesses of paper.\r\n\r\nThe secondary coil should be wound with single covered wire,\r\npreferably silk-covered, although cotton will do. The more turns\r\nthere are on the secondary the higher the voltage will be, so the\r\nwire used must be fine. Number 32 to 36 will give good results,\r\nthe latter giving more voltage but less amperage. Each layer of\r\nthe secondary winding should be insulated from the others by a\r\npiece of thin paraffined paper wrapped over each layer as it is\r\nfinished. It is well not to wind to the extreme ends of the paper\r\ninsulations, but to leave a space of about 1/8-in. at each end of\r\nthe winding to prevent the wires of one layer slipping over the\r\nends of the paraffin\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Induction Coil]\r\n\r\npaper and coming in contact with the layer beneath, thus causing a\r\nshort circuit. The secondary winding should have at least a dozen\r\nlayers and should be carefully wound to prevent short circuiting.\r\n\r\nIn order to reduce the strength of the current a piece of brass\r\ntubing, F, is pushed into the space, C, surrounding the core, or\r\nif no brass tubing of the required size is on hand, roll a paper\r\ntube, cover with 4 or 5 thicknesses of tinfoil and then wrap with\r\nmore paper, using glue to hold the tinfoil in place and to keep\r\nthe tube from unwinding. When the tube is pushed all the way in,\r\nthe current produced\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Induction Coil]\r\n\r\nwill be almost unnoticeable, but when it is withdrawn the current\r\nwill be so strong that a person cannot let go the handles until\r\nthe coil is shut off. After the secondary coil is wound it should\r\nbe covered with stiff paper, and the whole coil, including the\r\nwood ends, should then be enameled black.\r\n\r\nIt is then ready to be mounted on a wooden base as shown in Fig.\r\n2. The secondary terminals are connected to the binding-posts, AA,\r\nwhich may be fastened on the base if desired. One wire from the\r\nprimary is connected with the binding-post, B, and the other is\r\nconnected with the armature, D, which may be taken from an old\r\nelectric bell. The contact screw, E, also from an electric bell,\r\nis connected to the binding-post, C. The contact spring, F, should\r\nbe bent against and soldered to the armature in order to make the\r\nvibrations more rapid.\r\n\r\nIf a false bottom is used on the base, all the wiring may be\r\nconcealed, which adds greatly to the appearance and if desired a\r\nsmall switch may be added. The handles, which may be old bicycle\r\npumps or electric light carbons, are connected to the\r\nbinding-posts, AA, by means of wires about 3 or 4 ft. long. This\r\ncoil when operating with the tube pulled all the way out and\r\nconnected to a single dry cell will give a current stronger than\r\nmost persons can stand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Home-Made Toaster [139]\r\n\r\nEach outside frame of the toaster is made from one piece of wire\r\n30 in. long. These are bent in a perfect square making each side\r\n7-in. long. This will allow 1 in. on each end for tying by\r\ntwisting the ends together. The first two wires inside and on each\r\nside of each frame are 8 in. long. Eight wires will be required\r\nfor this purpose and as they are 8 in. long 1/2 in. is allowed on\r\neach end for a bend around the outside frame, as shown in the\r\nsketch. The two middle wires are extensions of the handles. Each\r\nof these wires are made from a piece about 26 in. long and bent in\r\nthe shape of a U. The ends of the wire are bent around the frame\r\nin the same manner\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Toaster]\r\n\r\nas the other wires. This will leave the handle laying across the\r\nother side of the frame. The frame is fastened to the handle on\r\nthis side by giving the handle one turn around the frame. The\r\ninside edges of the frame are now tied together with a small ring\r\nof wire which is loose enough to allow each half to swing freely.\r\n--C. D.

The connections are made from the batteries to\r\nthe bell in the usual manner. Two other wires are then connected,\r\none to the binding-post of the bell that is not insulated from the\r\nframe and the other to the adjusting screw on the make and break\r\ncontact of the bell as shown in the sketch. The other ends of the\r\nwires are connected each to a common table knife. This will give\r\nquite a good shock and a much larger one can be had by placing one\r\nknife in a basin of water and while holding the other knife in one\r\nhand, dipping the fingers of the other hand in the water.\r\n--Contributed by D. Foster Hall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Mahogany Wood Putty [139]\r\n\r\nMix venetian red with quite thick arabic muscilage, making it into\r\na putty, and press this well into the cracks of mahogany before\r\nfinishing. The putty should be colored to suit the finish of the\r\nwood, says the Master Painter, by adding such dry color to the gum\r\nas will give the best result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Thermoelectric Battery [140]\r\nBy Arthur E. Joerin\r\n\r\nA novel way of producing an electric current by means of hot and\r\ncold water, heat from a match or alcohol\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Details of Battery]\r\n\r\nlamp, is obtained from a device constructed as shown in the\r\nsketch. Take two hardwood boards, marble, or slate plates, about 8\r\nor 10 in. long, place them together, as in Fig. 1, and mark and\r\ndrill about 500 holes. These two pieces should be separated about\r\n8 in. and fastened with boards across the ends, as shown in Fig.\r\n2.\r\n\r\nTake soft copper wire, not smaller than No. 18 gauge, and cut in\r\nlengths to pass through the holes in the two boards, leaving\r\nsufficient end to make a tie. It will require about 70 ft. of wire\r\nto fill one-half the number of holes. Also, cut the same number of\r\nlengths from the same gauge galvanized-iron wire to fill the\r\nremaining holes. The wires are put through the holes in the boards\r\nalternately, that is: begin with copper, the next hole with iron,\r\nthe next copper, the next iron, and so on, twisting the ends\r\ntogether as shown in Fig. 3. The connections, when complete,\r\nshould be copper for the first and iron for the last wire.\r\n\r\nWhen the whole apparatus is thus strung, the connections, which\r\nmust be twisted, can be soldered. Connect one copper wire to the\r\nbell and the other terminal, which must be an iron wire, to the\r\nother post of the bell. The apparatus is then short-circuited, yet\r\nthere is no current in the instrument until a lighted match, or,\r\nbetter still, the flame of an alcohol lamp is placed at one end\r\nonly.\r\n\r\nBest results are obtained by putting ice or cold water on one side\r\nand a flame on the other. The experimenter may also place the\r\nwhole apparatus under sink faucets with the hot water turned on at\r\none terminal and the cold water at the other. The greater the\r\ndifference of temperature in the two terminals, the more current\r\nwill be obtained.\r\n\r\nVery interesting experiments may thus be performed, and these may\r\nlead to the solving of the great thermoelectric problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Hygrometer [140]\r\n\r\nMount a wire on a board which is used for a base and should be 3/8\r\nby 4 by 8 in., as shown in the sketch. A piece of catgut--a string\r\nused on a violin will do--is suspended from the bent end of the\r\nwire. A hand or pointer is cut from a piece of tin and secured to\r\nthe catgut string about 1/2 in. from the base. A small piece of\r\nwood and some glue will fasten the pointer to the string. The\r\nscale is\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Simple Hygrometer]\r\n\r\nmarked on a piece of cardboard, which is fastened to the base and\r\nprotected with a piece of glass.\r\n--Contributed by J. Thos.

It\r\ncan be made of any of the several furniture woods in common use,\r\nsuch as selected, quarter-sawed white oak which will be found\r\nexceptionally pleasing in the effect produced.\r\n\r\nIf a planing mill is at hand the stock can be ordered in such a\r\nway as to avoid the hard work of planing and sandpapering. Of\r\ncourse if mill-planed stock cannot be had, the following\r\ndimensions must be enlarged slightly to allow for "squaring up the\r\nrough."\r\n\r\nFor the top, order 1 piece 1-1/8 in. thick, 34 in. wide and 46 in.\r\nlong. Have it S-4-S (surface on four sides) and "squared" to\r\nlength. Also, specify that it be sandpapered on the top surface,\r\nthe edges and ends.\r\n\r\nFor the shelf, order 1 piece 7/8 in. thick, 22 in. wide and 42 in.\r\nlong, with the four sides surfaced, squared and sandpapered the\r\nsame as for the top.\r\n\r\nFor the side rails, order 2 pieces 7/8 in. thick, 6 in. wide and\r\n37 in. long, S-4-S and sanded on one side. For the end rails, 2\r\npieces 7/8 in. thick, 6 in. wide and 25 in. long. Other\r\nspecifications as for the side rails.\r\n\r\nFor the stretchers, into which the shelf tenons enter, 2 pieces\r\n1-1/8 in. thick,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This Picture Is from a Photograph of the Mission\r\nTable Described]\r\n\r\n3-3/4 in. wide and 25 in. long, surfaced and sanded on four sides.\r\nFor the slats, 10 pieces 5/88 in. thick, 1-1/2 in. wide and 17 in.\r\nlong, surfaced and sanded on four sides. For the keys, 4 pieces\r\n3/4 in. thick, 1-1/4 in. wide and 2-7/8 in. long, S-4-S. This\r\nwidth is a little wide; it will allow the key to be shaped as\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\nThe drawings obviate any necessity for going into detail in the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Table Details]\r\n\r\ndescription. Fig. 1 gives an assembly drawing showing the relation\r\nof the parts. Fig. 2 gives the detail of an end. The tenons for\r\nthe side rails are laid off and the mortises placed in the post as\r\nare those on the end. Care must, be taken, however, not to cut any\r\nmortises on the post, below, as was done in cutting the stretcher\r\nmortises on the ends of the table. A good plan is to set the posts\r\nupright in the positions they are to occupy relative to one\r\nanother and mark with pencil the approximate positions of the\r\nmortises. The legs can then be laid flat and the mortises\r\naccurately marked out with a fair degree of assurance that they\r\nwill not be cut where they are not wanted and that the legs shall\r\n"pair" properly when effort is made to assemble the parts of the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nThe table ends should be glued up first and the glue allowed to\r\nharden, after which the tenons of the shelf may be inserted and\r\nthe side rails placed.\r\n\r\nThere is a reason for the shape, size and location of each tenon\r\nor mortise. For illustration, the shape of the tenon on the top\r\nrails permits the surface of the rail to extend almost flush with\r\nthe surface of the post at the same time permitting the mortise in\r\nthe post to be kept away from that surface. Again, the shape of\r\nthe ends of the slats is such that, though they may vary slightly\r\nin length, the fitting of the joints will not be affected. Care\r\nmust be taken in cutting the mortises to keep their sides clean\r\nand sharp and to size.\r\n\r\nIn making the mortises for the keyed tenons, the length of mortise\r\nmust be slightly in excess of the width of the tenon--about\r\n1/8-in. of play to each side of each tenon. With a shelf of the\r\nwidth specified for this table, if such allowance is not made so\r\nthat the tenons may move sideways, the shrinkage would split the\r\nshelf.\r\n\r\nIn cutting across the ends of the shelf, between the tenons, leave\r\na hole in the waste so that the turning saw or compass saw can be\r\ninserted. Saw within one-sixteenth of the line, after which this\r\nmargin may be removed with chisel and mallet.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 3 is shown two views of the keyed tenon and the key. The\r\nmortise for the key is to be placed in the middle of the tenon. It\r\nwill be noted that this mortise is laid out 1-1/16 in. from the\r\nshoulder of the tenon while the stretcher is 1-1/8 in. thick. This\r\nis to insure the key\'s pulling the shelf tightly against the side\r\nof the stretcher.\r\n\r\nKeys may be made in a variety of shapes. The one shown is simple\r\nand structurally good. Whatever shape is used, the important thing\r\nto keep in mind is that the size of the key and the slant of its\r\nforward surface where it passes through the tenon must be kept the\r\nsame as the mortise made for it in the tenon.\r\n\r\nThe top is to be fastened to the rails by means either of wooden\r\nbuttons, Fig. 4, or small angle irons.\r\n\r\nThere are a bewildering number of mission finishes upon the\r\nmarket. A very satisfactory one is obtained by applying a coat of\r\nbrown Flemish water stain, diluted by the addition of water in the\r\nproportion of 2 parts water to 1 part stain. When this has dried,\r\nsand with number 00 paper, being careful not to "cut through."\r\nNext, apply a coat of dark brown filler; the directions for doing\r\nthis will be found upon the can in which the filler is bought. One\r\ncoat usually suffices. However, if an especially smooth surface is\r\ndesired a second coat may be applied in a similar manner.\r\n\r\nAfter the filler has hardened, a very thin coat of shellac is to\r\nbe put on. When this has dried, it should be sanded lightly and\r\nthen one or two coats of wax should be properly applied and\r\npolished. Directions for waxing are upon the cans in which the wax\r\nis bought. A beautiful dull gloss so much sought by finishers of\r\nmodern furniture will be the result of carefully following these\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Hanger for Trousers [143]\r\n\r\nSecure two clothes pins of the metal spring kind for the clamps of\r\nthe hanger. The pins are fastened one to each end of a looped\r\ngalvanized wire. This wire should be about 6 in. long after a coil\r\nis bent in the center as shown in the sketch. The diameter of the\r\nwire should be about 1/8 in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hanger]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make an Adjustable Negative Washer [143]\r\n\r\nThe sketch herewith shows a washing box for negatives made from an\r\nordinary wooden box. As can be seen, the grooved partition, A, is\r\nremovable, and as several places are provided for\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Washing Box]\r\n\r\nits insertion, the tank can be made to accommodate anyone of\r\nseveral sizes of plates, says Camera Craft. The other stationary\r\npartition, B, which does not reach quite to the bottom of the\r\ntank, is placed immediately next to the end of the tank, leaving a\r\nchannel between the two for the inflow of the wash water. A\r\nnarrow, thin strip, C, is fastened to the bottom of the tank to\r\nkeep the plates slightly raised, at the same time allowing a\r\nclearer flow of the water from the bottom upwards to the\r\ndischarge.\r\n\r\nThe water enters the narrow partition at the end, flows under the\r\npartitions B and A, then upward between and parallel to the\r\nsurface of the plates, escaping at the opposite end over the top\r\nof the tank end, in which the upper part has been cut away for\r\nthat purpose. The depth of this cut, in the upper part of the tank\r\nend, should allow the overflow to be a trifle higher than the\r\nwidth of the largest size plate for which the tank is fitted.\r\nPartition B being stationary, can be nailed in position\r\npermanently, allowing the bottom edge to clear the bottom of the\r\ntank the desired distance. Partition A being movable should have\r\nattached to its bottom edge a couple of nails, D, or better still,\r\nwooden pegs, which will keep it also above the bottom of the tank\r\nat the desired height.\r\n\r\nA coat of paraffin paint should be applied, and, just before it\r\nsets perfectly hard, any rough spots trimmed down with a knife or\r\nchisel and a second lighter coat applied. If the wood is very dry\r\nand porous a preliminary coat of the paint should be applied and\r\nallowed to soak into the pores. It is also well to apply a coat of\r\nthe paint to the joints at the corners and around the edge of the\r\nbottom before nailing together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Turn-Down Shelf for a Small Space [144]\r\n\r\nThe average amateur photographer does not have very much space in\r\nwhich to do his work. The kitchen is the room used ordinarily for\r\nfinishing the photographs. In many instances there will not be\r\nspace enough for any extra tables, and so a temporary place is\r\nprepared from boxes or a chair on which to place the trays and\r\nchemicals. Should there be space enough on one of the walls a\r\nshelf can be made to hang down out of the way when not in use. A\r\nshelf constructed on this order may be of any length to suit the\r\nspace or of such a length for the purpose intended. A heavy piece\r\nof wood, about\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Turn Down Shelf]\r\n\r\n1-1/2 in. thick, and 4 to 6 in. wide, is first fastened to the\r\nwall at the proper height with nails, or, much better, large\r\nscrews.\r\n\r\nThe shelf is cut and planed smooth from a board 12-in. wide and\r\nabout 1-in. thick. This board is fastened to the piece on the wall\r\nwith two hinges as shown in Fig. 1. A small cleat is nailed to the\r\nouter and under edge of the board and in the middle as shown. This\r\nis used to place a support under the outer edge of the shelf. The\r\nsupport, A, Fig. 2, should be long enough to extend diagonally to\r\nthe floor or top of the baseboard from the inner edge of the cleat\r\nwhen the shelf is up in its proper place. --L.

The handles of the spoons\r\nshould be insulated or the operator can wear either kid or rubber\r\ngloves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make Tint Lantern Slides [144]\r\n\r\nPurchase some lantern slide plates and fix them in hypo without\r\nexposing, in the usual manner, same as you would an exposed plate,\r\nsays the Moving Picture World. This leaves a thin, perfectly\r\ntransparent emulsion film on the glass, which will readily take\r\ncolor. Mix a rather weak solution of clear aniline dye of the\r\ndesired color and dip the plate in it, wiping the plate side\r\nclean. If not dark enough, dip again and again until desired tint\r\nis attained, letting it dry between each dipping. A very light\r\nblue tint slide will brighten a yellow film considerably, but the\r\ntint must be very light, just a bare tint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Bicycle Catamaran [145]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying photographs show a bicycle boat made to carry two\r\npersons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This Catamaran Carries Two People]\r\n\r\nThis boat is constructed by using two galvanized iron tubes 18 ft.\r\nlong and 12 in. in diameter, tapered at the front end down to\r\ncast-iron points, and the rear end shaped to attach rudders. These\r\ntubes are placed 26 in. apart, giving the boat an extreme width of\r\n50 in.\r\n\r\nThe cylinders support a platform and on the rear end of this\r\nplatform is constructed a paddle wheel 52 in. in diameter with 16\r\nspokes. On the end of each spoke is fastened a galvanized sheet\r\nmetal blade 6 in. wide and 8 in. long. A large guard placed over\r\nthe paddle wheel forms a seat for one person and a chair in front\r\non the platform provides a place for a second person.\r\n\r\nThe person in front helps to propel the boat with hand levers\r\nwhich are connected with rods to sprocket wheels on each side of\r\nthe platform. The occupant of the rear seat contributes his part\r\nof the power with his feet on pedals of the shaft that carries the\r\nsprocket wheels. This shaft and sprocket wheels drive the paddle\r\nwheel by side chains of the bicycle kind. The boat is steered from\r\nthe rear seat by ropes attached to double rudders. This boat will\r\nrun at considerable speed and is very steady in rough water as it\r\ngoes directly through large waves instead of going over them.\r\n--Contributed by Ernest Schoedsack, Council Bluffs, Iowa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Lead Pencil Rheostat [145]\r\n\r\nTake an ordinary lead pencil and cut seven notches at equal\r\nintervals on the pencil down to and around the lead, leaving it\r\nbare. A seven-point switch is constructed on a board of suitable\r\nsize making the points by using screws that will go through the\r\nboard. A small piece of tin or brass will do for a switch and is\r\nfastened as shown. The connections are made on the back side of\r\nthe board as shown by the dotted lines. This will reduce 40 to 50\r\nvolts down to 5 or 10 volts for short lengths\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Simple Rheostat]\r\n\r\nof time.\r\n--Contributed by Roy Newby, San Jose, Cal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Homemade Shoe Rack [146]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying sketch explains how a boy can make his own shoe\r\nrack that can be placed on the wall in\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Shoe Rack]\r\n\r\nthe clothes closet. Figure 1 shows the construction of the bottom\r\nto permit the dirt to fall through. Two boards, 9 in. wide and\r\nabout 3 ft. long, with six partitions between, as shown, will make\r\npockets about 6 in. long. The width of the pockets at the bottom\r\nis 2 in. and at the top 5 in.\r\n--Contributed by Guy H. Harvey, Mill Valley, Cal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Waterproof Canvas [146]\r\n\r\nThe method used by the British navy yards for waterproofing and\r\npainting canvas so it will not become stiff and cracked is as\r\nfollows: One ounce of yellow soap and 1/2 pt. of hot water are\r\nmixed with every 7 lb. of paint to be used. The mixture is applied\r\nto the canvas with a brush. This is allowed to dry for two days\r\nand then a coat of the same paint, without the soap, is laid on.\r\nWhen this last coat is dry the canvas may be painted any color\r\ndesired. After three days of drying the canvas may be folded up\r\nwithout sticking together, and is, of course, waterproof. Canvas\r\nwaterproofed in this manner makes an excellent covering for\r\nportable canoes and canvas boats. The color mixture for the soap\r\nand second application is made from 1 lb. of lampblack and 6 lb.\r\nof yellow ocher, both in oil; the finish coat may be any color\r\ndesired. When no paint is to be used on the canvas it may be\r\nwaterproofed with a mixture made from soft soap dissolved in hot\r\nwater, and a solution of iron sulphate added. Iron sulphate, or\r\nferrous sulphate, is the green vitriol. The vitriol combines with\r\nthe potash of the soap, and the iron oxide is precipitated with\r\nthe fatty acid as insoluble iron soap. This precipitate is then\r\nwashed, dried and mixed with linseed oil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Building a House in a Tree Top [146]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying photograph shows a small house built in a tree\r\ntop 20 ft. from the ground. The house is\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lofty Sentry Box for Guarding Watermelon Patch]\r\n\r\n5 ft. wide, 5 ft. 1 in. long, and 6 ft. 6 in. high. A small\r\nplatform, 2 ft. wide, is built on the front. Three windows are\r\nprovided, one for each side, and a door in front. The entrance is\r\nmade through a trap door in the floor of the house. This house was\r\nconstructed by a boy 14 years old and made for the purpose of\r\nwatching over a melon patch.\r\n--Contributed by Mack Wilson, Columbus, O.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Lamp Stand and Shade [147]\r\n\r\nA library light stand of pleasing design and easy construction is\r\nmade as follows: Square up a piece of white oak so that it shall\r\nhave a width and thickness of 1-3/4 in. with a length of 13 in.\r\nSquare up two pieces of the same kind of material to the same\r\nwidth and thickness, but with a length of 12 in. each. Square up\r\ntwo pieces to a width and length of 3 in. each with a thickness of\r\n1-1/8 in.\r\n\r\nIf a planing mill is near, time and patience will be saved by\r\nordering one piece 1-3/4 in. square and 40 in. long, two pieces\r\n1-1/8 in. thick and 3 in. square, all planed and sandpapered on\r\nall surfaces. The long piece can then be cut at home to the\r\nlengths specified above.\r\n\r\nThe 13-in. piece is for the upright and should have a 1/2-in. hole\r\nbored the full length through the center. If the bit is not long\r\nenough to reach entirely through, bore from each end, then use a\r\nred-hot iron to finish. This hole is for the electric wire or gas\r\npipe if gas is used.\r\n\r\nThe two pieces for the base are alike except the groove of one is\r\ncut from the top and of the other from the under side, as shown.\r\nShape the under sides first. This can best be done by placing the\r\ntwo pieces in a vise, under sides together, and boring two holes\r\nwith a 1-in. bit. The center of each hole will be 2-1/2 in. from\r\neither end and in the crack between the pieces. The pieces can\r\nthen be taken out, lines gauged on each side of each, and the wood\r\nbetween the holes removed with turning saw and scraper steel.\r\n\r\nThe width of the grooves must be determined by laying one piece\r\nupon the other; a trysquare should be used to square the lines\r\nacross the pieces, however, gauge for depth, gauging both pieces\r\nfrom their top surfaces. Chisel out the grooves and round off the\r\ncorners as shown in the sketch, using a 3/4-in. radius.\r\n\r\nThese parts may be put together and fastened to the upright by\r\nmeans of two long screws from the under side, placed to either\r\nside of the 1/2-in. hole. This hole must be continued through the\r\npieces forming the base.\r\n\r\nThe braces are easiest made by taking the two pieces which were\r\nplaned to 1-1/8 in. thick and 3 in. square and drawing a diagonal\r\non each. Find the middle of this diagonal by drawing the central\r\nportion of the other diagonal; at this point place the spur of the\r\nbit and bore a 1-in. hole in each block.\r\n\r\nSaw the two blocks apart, sawing\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Details of Construction of Library Lamp Stand]\r\n\r\nalong a diagonal of each. Plane the surfaces on the saw cut smooth\r\nand sandpaper the curve made by the bit. Fasten the braces in\r\nplace by means of roundhead blued screws.\r\n\r\nTo make a shade such as is shown in the illustration is rather\r\ndifficult. The shade is made of wood glued up and has art glass\r\nfitted in rabbets cut on the inner edges. Such shades can be\r\npurchased ready to attach. The sketch shows one method of\r\nattaching. Four small pieces of strap iron are bent to the shape\r\nshown and fastened to the four sides of the upright. Electric\r\nglobes--two, three or four may be attached as shown.\r\n\r\nThe kind of wood finish for the stand will depend upon the finish\r\non the wooden shade, if shade is purchased. Brown Flemish is\r\nobtained by first staining the wood with Flemish water stain\r\ndiluted by the addition of two parts water to one part stain. When\r\nthis is dry, sandpaper the "whiskers" which were raised by the\r\nwater and fill with a medium dark filler. Directions will be found\r\non the filler cans. When the filler has hardened, apply two coats\r\nof wax.\r\n\r\nThe metal shade as shown in the sketch is a "layout" for a copper\r\nor brass shade of a size suitable for this particular lamp. Such\r\nshades are frequently made from one piece of sheet metal and\r\ndesigns are pierced in them as suggested in the "layout." This\r\npiercing is done by driving the point of a nail through the metal\r\nfrom the under side before the parts are soldered or riveted\r\ntogether. If the parts are to be riveted, enough additional metal\r\nmust be left on the last panel to allow for a lap. No lap is\r\nneeded when joints are soldered.\r\n\r\nA better way, and one which will permit the use of heavier metal,\r\nis to cut each side of the shade separately and fasten them\r\ntogether by riveting a piece of metal over each joint. The shape\r\nof this piece can be made so as to accentuate the rivet heads and\r\nthus give a pleasing effect.\r\n\r\nFor art-glass the metal panels are\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Completed Lamp]\r\n\r\ncut out, the glass is inserted from the under side and held in\r\nplace by small clips soldered to the frame of the shade. Pleasing\r\neffects are obtained by using one kind of metal, as brass, and\r\nreinforcing and riveting with another metal, such as copper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: METAL SHADE--Construction of Shade]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Illuminating a Watch Dial at Night [149]\r\n\r\nThis picture shows a watch holder, with a device to receive an\r\nordinary electric pocket lamp and battery. The battery is set in a\r\nbracket under which a reflector extends downward to throw the\r\nlight on the dial of the watch and to protect the eyes from the\r\ndirect light. The entire stand and bracket are made from sheet\r\nmetal. The base is formed to make a tray to hold pins and collar\r\nbuttons. It is not necessary to seek in the darkness for a push\r\nbutton or switch, as in ordinary devices, but a light pressure\r\nwith the palm of the hand will make the lamp glow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lamp]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Home-Made Photographic Copying Stand [149]\r\n\r\nThe difficulties of bad lighting on small articles can be entirely\r\navoided by the use of a suitable support for the camera, the\r\nobject and the background.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Secures Good Light on Small Objects]\r\n\r\nFor illustrations it is often an advantage to show an object with\r\na perfectly plain background and no deep shadows. When using the\r\nstand as illustrated this is a very simple matter. Figure 1 shows\r\nthe side, and Fig. 2 the front view of this stand. The stand is\r\nvery easily constructed from pipe and pipe fittings. The main pipe\r\nof the stand will need to be of proper length to suit the focus of\r\nyour camera. This can be determined by finding the length from the\r\nlens to the object after the bellows are extended to their full\r\nlength. The arms holding the glass, as shown in the sketch, should\r\nbe set at a point about the middle of the main tube. The cross\r\nthat holds the middle arms should be 3/4 in. one way and 1/2 in.\r\nthe other. This will allow for adjustment of the glass table. A\r\nsmall set screw provided in the back of this cross will hold the\r\ntable in any position desired. The pipes and other connections are\r\nall 1/2-in. and the lengths of the pipes are made suitable for the\r\nsize of the camera. When a small object is to be photographed it\r\nis placed upon the glass table and the background fastened to the\r\nboard. In this manner small objects can be photographed without\r\nany deep shadow on one side. The bottom cross and ells should be\r\ncorked so as to prevent any slipping and damage to the floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Home-Made Pocket Lamp [149]\r\n\r\nA simple and safe pocket lamp that will last for about 6 months\r\nwithout extra expense can be made at home for a few cents.\r\n\r\nHave your druggist take a strong vial of clear glass, or a pill\r\nbottle with screw or cork top and put into it a piece of\r\nphosphorus about the size of a pea and fill the bottle one-third\r\nfull of pure olive oil that has been heated for 15 minutes--but\r\nnot boiled. Cork tightly and the result will be a luminous light\r\nin the upper portion of the bottle. If the light becomes dim,\r\nuncork and recork again. The lamp will retain its brilliancy for\r\nabout 6 months. This makes a perfectly safe lamp to carry. These\r\nlamps are used by watchmen of powder magazines. Care should be\r\nexercised in handling the phosphorus, as it is very poisonous.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Tangent Galvanometer [150]\r\n\r\nSecure a piece of wood 1/2 in. thick and cut out a ring with an\r\noutside diameter of 10-1/2 in. and an inside diameter of 9 in. and\r\nglue to each side two other rings 1/4 in. thick with the same\r\ninside diameter as the first ring and 11 in. outside diameter,\r\nthus forming a 1/4-in. channel in the circumference of the ring.\r\nIf a lathe is at hand this ring can be made from a solid piece and\r\nthe channel turned out. Cut another circular piece 11 in. in\r\ndiameter for a base. Make a hole in the center of this piece 1 in.\r\nwide and 6-5/16 in. long, into which the ring first made should\r\nfit so that its inner surface is just even with the upper surface\r\nof the baseboard. The ring is held upright in the hole by a small\r\nstrip screwed to the base as shown. All screws and brads that are\r\nused must be of brass. The cutting of these circular pieces is not\r\nso difficult if a band saw driven by power is used. They can be\r\ncut by means of a key-hole saw if a band saw is not accessible.\r\n\r\nBefore mounting the ring on the base, the groove should be wound\r\nwith 8 turns of No. 16 double cotton-covered magnet wire. The two\r\nends may be tied together with a string to hold them temporarily.\r\n\r\nFasten two strips of wood 1/4-in. thick 5/8-in. wide and 11 in.\r\nlong across the sides of the ring with their upper edges passing\r\nexactly through the center of the ring. An ordinary pocket\r\ncompass, about 1-1/4 in. in diameter, is fitted in these strips so\r\nthat the center of the needle or pointer will be exactly in the\r\ncenter of the ring and its zero point mark at the half-way point\r\nbetween the two strips. Put the ring in place on the base, as\r\nshown in the sketch, and connect the two ends of the wire to two\r\nbinding-posts that are previously attached to the base. Coat the\r\nentire surface with brown shellac. Any deviation from the\r\ndimensions will cause errors in the results obtained by its use.\r\n\r\nRemove all pieces of iron or steel and especially magnets in the\r\nnear vicinity of the instrument when in use. Place the\r\ngalvanometer on a level table and turn it until the needle,\r\npointing north and south, and swinging freely, lies exactly in the\r\nplane of the coil, as shown in the cut. The needle then will point\r\nto zero if the directions have been followed closely. Connect one\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tangent Galvanometer]\r\n\r\ncell of battery to the instrument and allow the current to flow\r\nthrough the coils. The needle of the compass will be deflected to\r\none side or the other, and will finally come to rest at a certain\r\nangle-let us say 45 deg. The dimensions of the instrument are such\r\nthat when the deflection is 45 deg. the current flowing through\r\nthe coils upon the ring is 1/2 ampere. The ampere is the unit\r\nchosen to designate the strength of the electric current. For\r\nother angles the value of the current may be found from the\r\nfollowing table:\r\n\r\nAngles Degrees  Current Amperes\r\n    10              .088\r\n    20              .182\r\n    30              .289\r\n    40              .420\r\n    45              .500\r\n    50              .600\r\n    55              .715\r\n    60              .865\r\n    70             1.375\r\n\r\nAs the magnetic force that acts upon a magnet needle varies in\r\ndifferent places the values given for the current will not be true\r\nin all parts of the country. The table gives correct values for\r\nthe immediate vicinity of Chicago and that part of the United\r\nStates lying east of Chicago, and north of the Ohio river. The\r\nresults given should be multiplied by 1.3 for places south of the\r\nOhio river and east of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Home-Made X-Ray Instrument [151]\r\n\r\nTwo cylinders, AA, are mounted on a base, B, and mirrors, CC, are\r\nfitted at an angle of 45 deg. into these cylinders. Corresponding\r\nmirrors, EE, are put in the base parallel with those in those\r\ncylinders. An opening extends downward from D of each cylinder so\r\nthat light entering at one end of the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Details of X-Ray Machine]\r\n\r\ncylinder is reflected down at right angles by the first mirror to\r\nthe second, from the second to the third, from the third to the\r\nfourth which reflects the light to the eye. Thus the light never\r\npasses through the cylinders and the observer does not see\r\nthrough, but around any object inserted at X between the\r\ncylinders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a a Non-Polarizing Battery [151]\r\n\r\nBichromate batteries are very expensive to maintain and dry cells\r\ndo not furnish enough amperage for some kinds of experimental\r\nwork. A cell of a battery that will run 10 hours with an output of\r\nover 1 ampere can be made as follows: Secure a jar about 4 in. in\r\ndiameter and 8 in. high and place in the bottom of this jar the\r\nlower half of a tin baking powder can, to which a wire has been\r\nsoldered for connections. Place in the can a mixture of 2 oz.\r\nblack oxide of copper, 1 oz. black oxide of manganese and some\r\niron filings.\r\n\r\nPurchase a small crowfoot zinc and hang it about 1 in. above the\r\nhalf can. Prepare a 10 per cent solution of caustic soda and fill\r\nthe jar within 1 in. of the top. Place on top the solution a thin\r\nlayer of kerosene or paraffin. The cell will only cost about 50\r\ncents to make and 25 cents for each renewal. When renewing, always\r\nremove the oil with a siphon.\r\n--Contributed by Robert Canfield, University Park, Colo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Home-Made Barometer [151]\r\n\r\nTake 1/4 oz. of pulverized campor, 62 gr. of pulverized nitrate of\r\npotassium, 31 gr. nitrate of ammonia and dissolve in 2 oz.\r\nalcohol.

If such a coil and iron core\r\nbe made small enough they can be attached to a cork and the cork,\r\nfloating on a solution, will allow the magnet to point north and\r\nsouth. The sketch shows how to make such an instrument. A coil of\r\ninsulated wire is wrapped around a small iron core, leaving a few\r\ninches of each end free for connections. The insulation is removed\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Floating Electromagnet]\r\n\r\nfrom these ends and they are run through a piece of cork. Attach\r\nto the wires, on the under side of the cork, a piece of zinc to\r\none end and a piece of copper to the other. The cork is then\r\nfloated on a solution of acid, with the zinc and copper hanging in\r\nthe solution. If zinc and copper are used, the solution is made\r\nfrom water and blue vitriol. If zinc and carbon are used, the\r\nsolution is made from sal ammoniac and water.\r\n\r\nThe float will move about on the solution until the magnet iron\r\nwill point north and south. If two of them are floating on the\r\nsame solution, they will move about and finally arrange themselves\r\nend to end with the coils and magnet cores pointing north and\r\nsouth.\r\n--Contributed by C.

A paper-fastener box, about\r\n1-1/4 in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Air Thermometer]\r\n\r\ndeep and 2 in. in diameter will serve very well for the box A.\r\nSolder in the side of the box 1-in. piece of 1/4-in. brass tubing,\r\nB, and then solder on the cover, C, so that the only escape for\r\nthe air is through the brass tube. Secure a piece of 1/4-in. glass\r\ntubing - not shorter than 18 in.--and bend it as shown at D in the\r\nsketch. Hold the part of the tube to be bent in the broad side of\r\na gas jet, and in a minute or two the tube will bend with its own\r\nweight. Any angle can be given glass tubing in this way. Connect\r\nthe glass tube to B with a short piece of rubber hose, E. If the\r\nhose is not a tight fit, bind with a short piece of fine copper\r\nwire. The standard, F, is made from a piece of No. 10 wire about\r\n10 in. long. To this standard solder the supporting wire, G--No.\r\n14 wire will do. On one side bend the wire around the tube B, and\r\non the other around the glass tube, D.\r\n\r\nThe base, H, can be made of oak, stained and varnished. The bottom\r\nof the box, A, is covered with lampblack so as to readily absorb\r\nall heat that strikes the surface. The black should not be put on\r\nuntil just before you paint the supports, cover and rim of the box\r\nwith gold or silver paint. Hold the bottom of the box to be\r\nblackened over a little burning cotton saturated with turpentine.\r\n\r\nThe scale on the glass can be etched with hydrofluoric acid, or\r\nmade with a little black paint.

Put ends, A, 1-1/4 in. square and cut from heavy cardboard\r\non this tube. Make a hole in the center of each cardboard just\r\nlarge enough to allow the brass tube to fit tight. Put on two or\r\nthree layers of stout paper around the brass tube and between the\r\ncardboard ends. Wind evenly about 2 oz. of No. 26 cotton covered\r\nmagnet wire on the paper between the ends and leave about 2 in. of\r\nwire on each end extending from the coil.

Bore holes for binding-posts, B, one on\r\neach side of the board, and connect the two wires from the coil to\r\nthem. At the other end of the board and in the center drive a wire\r\nnail and attach a small spring, C, to it. The spring should be\r\nabout 1 in. long. Take a small piece of soft iron, D, 1/2- in.\r\nlong and just large enough to slip freely through the brass\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Battery Voltmeter Construction]\r\n\r\ntube and solder a piece of copper wire to it; the other end of the\r\ncopper wire being hooked to the spring, C. The copper wire must be\r\njust long enough to allow the piece of iron, D, to hang part way\r\nin the end of the coil and still hold the spring in place. A\r\ncircular piece of cardboard, E, is slipped over the spring to\r\nwhere the spring joins the wire. This cardboard is to serve as the\r\npointer. A piece of paper 1-1/2 in. wide and 2-1/2 in. long is\r\nglued to the board so that it will be directly under the cardboard\r\npointer and fit snugly up against the top of the coil.\r\n\r\nThe paper can be calibrated by connecting one cell of battery to\r\nthe binding-posts. The iron plunger, D, is drawn into the tube and\r\nconsequently the pointer, E, is drawn nearer to the coil. Make a\r\nmark directly under the place where the pointer comes to rest. At\r\nthe place mark the number of volts the cell reads when connected\r\nwith a voltmeter. Do the same with two or three cells and mark\r\ndown the result on the scale. By dividing off the space between\r\nthese marks you may be able to obtain a surprisingly correct\r\nreading when connected with the battery cells to be tested.\r\n--Contributed by Edward M.

Smith, Milwaukee, Wis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Small Geissler Tube [154]\r\n\r\nAt first this would seem to be a difficult piece of work, yet a\r\ngood and beautiful Geissler tube can be made at home in the\r\nfollowing manner:\r\n\r\nProcure a glass tube about 3-1/2 ft. long having a hole through\r\nits center about 1/8 or 1/4 in. in diameter, about 1 in. of No. 30\r\nplatinum wire and enough mercury to fill the tube and a small\r\nbowl. About 1-1/2 lb. of mercury will be sufficient. The first\r\nthing to do is to seal 1/2 in. of platinum wire in one end of the\r\ntube. This is done by holding the end of the tube with the right\r\nhand and taking hold of the tube with the left hand about 4 in.\r\nfrom the right hand. Hold the tube in a flame of a bunsen burner\r\nin such manner that the flame will strike the tube midway between\r\nthe hands, as shown in Fig. 1, and keep turning the tube so as to\r\nget an even heat. When the glass becomes soft,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Construction of Geissler Tube]\r\n\r\nremove the tube from the flame and quickly draw it out into a fine\r\nthread. Break this thread off about 1/8 in. from the long part of\r\nthe tube and the end will appear as shown in Fig. 2. Take 1/2 in.\r\nof the platinum wire and slip it through the fine hole made by\r\nbreaking the glass thread so that one-half of the wire will be\r\ninside of the long tube. If the end of the tube is now placed in\r\nthe flame of the burner, the glass will adhere to the platinum\r\nwire and the wire will thus be sealed in the tube. The finished\r\nend will appear as shown in Fig. 3. This tube as described will be\r\n8 in. long, although nearly any size could be made in the same\r\nway.\r\n\r\nMeasure 8 in. from the sealed end and place the tube at that point\r\nin the flame, holding in the left hand. At the same time take the\r\npiece of glass that was broken off at the end in the first\r\noperation and hold it in the flame with the right hand. When both\r\nthe tube and piece of glass are soft, touch the soft part of the\r\ntube with the end of the glass and draw the tube out into a point\r\nlike that shown in Fig. 4. Break off the piece of glass, thus\r\nleaving a. small aperture in the long tube. Seal the remaining 1/2\r\nin. of platinum in this aperture in the same manner as before\r\nbeing careful not to heat the tube too suddenly. The tube is now\r\nready for filling and the upper part will appear as shown in Fig.\r\n5.\r\n\r\nThe air is expelled from the tube by filling with mercury. This\r\nmay be done by making a paper funnel and pouring the mercury\r\nslowly into the tube through the funnel. When the tube is filled\r\nto within 1/2 in. of the funnel remove the funnel and tap the side\r\nof the tube gently in order to remove any small air bubbles that\r\nmay be clinging to the sides of the tube. The air bubbles will\r\nrise and come to the top. The tube now must be filled completely,\r\nexpelling all the air. Place a finger over the end of the tube to\r\nkeep the mercury in and invert the tube and set the end in the\r\nbowl of mercury. The mercury in the tube will sink until the level\r\nwill be at about 30 in., leaving 8 in. of vacuum at the top. The\r\nnext operation is to seal the tube at the half-way point between\r\nthe lower platinum wire and the mercury level.\r\n\r\nAs the lower end of the tube must be kept at all times in the bowl\r\nof mercury until the tube is sealed, an assistant will be\r\nnecessary for this last operation. Have the assistant hold the\r\ntube in the mercury at a slight angle, using care to always keep\r\nthe lower end in the mercury, while you hold the burner in the\r\nleft hand and allow the flame to strike the tube at the stated\r\npoint. The part of the tube above this point will gradually bend\r\nover of its own weight as the glass softens. When it reaches the\r\nangle of about 60 deg., Fig. 6, take hold of the tube with the\r\nright hand still keeping the flame on the tube, and gradually draw\r\nthe softened portion out until it separates from the main tube.\r\n\r\nThe tube is now finished and when the platinum wires are attached\r\nto the terminals of a spark coil a beautiful blue light will\r\nappear in the tube with a dark space at the negative end or\r\ncathode.\r\n--Contributed by David A.

The\r\nframe as shown in the sketch was devised and its chief advantage\r\nlies in the fact that when not in use it can be compactly tied\r\ntogether and stored away in a closet.\r\n\r\nAlmost any wood may be used in constructing this frame, but yellow\r\npine is the best, as it is easily obtained and at the same time\r\nvery well suited for such work. All pieces are to be dressed on\r\nall sides.\r\n\r\nTwo upright pieces are cut from 3/4 in. material 2 in. wide and 5\r\nft. 9 in. long and two blocks are fastened on the ends of each\r\nthat are to be used for the bottom, as shown in Fig. 1. These\r\nblocks are each 2 by 6-in. and 1/4 in. thick. The base is made\r\nfrom a piece 3/4 in. thick, 3 in. wide and 5 ft. 4 in. long. A\r\ncrosspiece 3/4-in. thick, 3 in. wide and 12 in. long, cut in the\r\nshape shown in Fig. 2, is screwed on each end of the base with\r\n3-in. wood screws, as shown in Fig. 3. Four blocks 1/4 in. thick,\r\n1 in. wide and 3 in. long are nailed to the sides of the base\r\npiece parallel with and at a distance of 2 in. from the end of\r\nsame. This forms a slot, Fig. 4, to receive the pieces nailed to\r\nthe ends of the uprights. To secure a rigid frame it is essential\r\nthat this, joint be accurately put together.\r\n\r\nProcure a piece of thick tin or brass and make two pieces like the\r\npattern shown in Fig. 5, with each projection 3-in. long. The\r\nwidth of the crosspiece is 1 in. and the single projection 3/4 in.\r\nThese are bent and nailed, one on each end of a piece of wood that\r\nis 1/4 in. thick, 1 in. wide and 5 ft. long, as in Fig. 6. These\r\nwill form two pockets that will fit over the tops of the uprights.\r\nThe frame is put together as shown in Fig. 7. Any background that\r\nwill hang straight without need of being stretched can be hung on\r\nthis frame.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG.6 -- Details of Background Frame]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n**  Home-Made Kite Reel [156]\r\n\r\nThis kite reel is constructed from two old pulleys and a few pipe\r\nfittings.

After this is\r\ndone make a porous cell by rolling a piece of brown paper around a\r\nstick and fastening the edge with sealing wax; also, fix a bottom\r\nto the cell in the same way. Make a solution of one part of oil of\r\nvitriol and 5 parts of water and pour this mixture into the porous\r\ncell. Wind the end of a copper wire around the end of a piece of\r\nzinc and place the zinc in the porous cell. Attach the other end\r\nof the wire to the wax impression.\r\n\r\nThe wax impression is made by pouring melted beeswax on the\r\narticle you wish to reproduce and removing after the wax gets\r\ncold. The wax mold then should be coated with black lead and\r\npolished. This is done with a camel\'s hair brush.

The swing door B, Fig. 1, is made as shown\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Self-Setting Trap]\r\n\r\nin Fig. 2, which represents the back side of the door. Sheet metal\r\nor tin is cut to the proper size and tacked around the edge of the\r\nhole. This prevents the animal from gnawing its way out, also\r\nprovides a way to make the hole of different sizes for squirrels\r\nor other animals. The hole in the door should be about 2 in. wide\r\nand 4 in. high for rabbits. The door is made to swing freely on\r\ntwo large nails driven through the sides of the box. The hole in\r\nthe door being only large enough to admit a small portion of the\r\nrabbit\'s head, the rabbit will push its way through to the bait,\r\ncausing the door to swing back and up, and it will close by its\r\nown weight when the animal is inside. A small door is provided in\r\nthe other end to remove the animals caught.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of this trap is that where one animal is caught\r\nothers are liable to follow, and several rabbits will be trapped\r\nat a time. Then, too, the rabbits are not harmed in any way as\r\nthey would be if caught in an ordinary trap.\r\n--Contributed by H. F.

Take two pieces of\r\npasteboard, A and B, black surfaced if possible, and exactly 5 by\r\n7 in. in size. The piece A will form the back of the kit and\r\nshould have an opening cut in the center 4 by 5 in. in size. Paste\r\na piece of strong black paper, C, over the under side of it to\r\nkeep the plate from falling through. Cut an opening in the other\r\npiece, B, but cut it 1/4 in. shorter. This opening, being 1/8 in.\r\nshorter at each end, will retain the plate in position and cut off\r\nonly that small amount of plate surface when the plate is exposed\r\nin the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Camera Kit]\r\n\r\ncamera. Cut a piece of thin black cloth, D, 1 in. wide and 5 in.\r\nlong. Lay it down on a piece of newspaper and coat one side with\r\ngum or mucilage. Stand the two pieces of 5 by 7 in. black cards on\r\nend together so that they will be square and true and bind the\r\nother ends with the strip of cloth so as to form a hinge. The two\r\ncards form a thickness about equal to a thick glass plate, and go\r\nin the holder in the same way. Lay one of these kits down against\r\nthe ground side of the focusing screen and draw a line around,\r\ninside of the opening.

The\r\nphotograph was taken when they were on a new pavement which had 2\r\nin. of sand\r\n\r\n\r\nDog-Power Cart\r\n\r\nleft by the pavers and a grade of 6 per cent. The machine is\r\nnothing more than a boy\'s rubber-tired wagon on which are mounted\r\na box for a seat and a wheel steering device extending above and\r\nbelow the board of the wagon. The front wheels are guided by ropes\r\nattached from each end of the axle and a few turns around the\r\nlower end of the steering rod. A pair of shafts are attached to\r\nthe rear, into which the dog is harnessed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Dry Battery Cell [160]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dry Battery Cell]\r\n\r\nDry battery cells are composed of the same materials for the\r\npoles, but instead of the liquid commonly used a paste is formed\r\nby mixing sal ammoniac and other salts with water and packed in\r\nthe cell so it cannot spill.\r\n\r\nA cell of this kind can easily be made, and to make it the proper\r\nsize a sheet of zinc 8-1/2 in. long and 6 in. wide will be\r\nrequired. This zinc is rolled into a cylinder 2-1/2-in. in\r\ndiameter. This will allow for a lap of 5/8 in., which is tightly\r\nsoldered only on the outside of the seam. Close one end of the\r\ncylinder by soldering a disk of zinc over it, making a watertight\r\nreceptacle. All soldering should be done on the outside and none\r\nof the solder allowed to run on the inside of the seam. All seams\r\non the inside should be painted with asphaltum in order to cover\r\nany particles of solder. Do not paint any surface, only the\r\njoints. Secure three carbon rods 1/2- in. in diameter and 6 in.\r\nlong which are copper plated. Carbons used in arc lamps will do.\r\nFile the rods to remove the copper plate, leaving about 1/2-in. of\r\nthe plate at one end. Tie the three rods in a close bundle with\r\nthe copper-plated ends together and make a contact with each rod\r\nby soldering a wire to the plated ends, allowing one end of the\r\nwire to project about 2 in. for a connection. The plated ends of\r\nthe carbons should be covered with paraffin for about 1 in. This\r\nis done by immersing them in a dish of smoking hot melted paraffin\r\nuntil the pores are thoroughly saturated.\r\n\r\nThe salts for filling are 1/4 lb. zinc oxide, 1 lb. sal ammoniac,\r\n3/4 lb. plaster of paris, 1/4 lb. chloride of zinc mixed into a\r\npaste by adding 1/2 pt. of water. Form a 1/2-in. layer of paste in\r\nthe bottom of the cylinder and place the ends of the carbon rods\r\non this with their plated ends up. Hold the rods in the center of\r\nthe cylinder and put the paste in around the rods with a stick.\r\nPack the paste in, closely filling the cylinder to within 3/4 in.\r\nof the top. This space at the top is filled with a mixture of 1/2\r\nlb. of rosin and 2 oz. beeswax melted together. This wax seals the\r\ncell and prevents any evaporation. Connection is made to the zinc\r\nby soldering a wire to the outside of the cylinder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Paraffin Wire [161]\r\n\r\nThe following description of how to make an apparatus with which\r\nto paraffin wire as needed makes clear a method of construction\r\nthat is simple and easy to put together in a. short time.\r\n\r\nSecure a pan to be used for this purpose only; one that will hold\r\nabout 1 qt. The details of the construction are given in the\r\ndiagram, in which P is the pan; B is a base of 1 in. pine; S is\r\nthe spool of wire supported near one end of the base by nailing on\r\nstandards H and H; F is a spool, with narrow flanges, supported\r\nnear the bottom of the pan by the standards T and T. These may be\r\nmade of two short pieces of a roller fitted into the holes bored\r\nin the base; A is a block of l-in. pine with a piece of leather\r\ntacked on one side. Four nails should be driven in the base just\r\noutside of the edge of the pan to keep it from sliding off the\r\npan.\r\n\r\nBore a hole in the base between the two spools and pass the wire\r\nthrough this hole, under the spool in the paraffin, then through a\r\nsmall hole in the leather and a notch in the block A, and a notch\r\nbetween the base and the pan. Tie a string around the wire between\r\nthe leather and the paraffin, making the knots so they will not\r\npull through the hole in the leather. This makes the wire smooth,\r\nand by making the string tighter or looser you can regulate the\r\nthickness of the paraffin, says Electrician and Mechanic. Place\r\nthe pan on the stove; when the paraffin is melted, pull out the\r\nwire as needed. To keep the pan from sliding place a flatiron or\r\nsome other weight on it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Home-Made Apparatus for Paraffining Wire]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Uses of Peat [161]\r\n\r\nPeat is used in Germany for bedding, fodder, filter, fuel and\r\npacking purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Scientific Explanation of a Toy [162]\r\n\r\nIn a recent Issue of Popular Mechanics an article on "The Turning\r\nCard Puzzle" was described and illustrated. Outside of the\r\nscientific side involved herein I describe a much better trick.\r\nAbout the time when the expression "skidoo" first began to be used\r\nI invented the following trick and called it "Skidoo" and\r\n"Skidee," which created much merriment. Unless the trick is\r\nthoroughly understood, for some it will turn one way, for others\r\nthe opposite way, while for others it will not revolve at all. One\r\nperson whom I now recall became red in the face by shouting skidoo\r\nand skidee at it, but the thing would not move at all, and he\r\nfinally, from vexation, threw the trick into the fire and a new\r\none had to be made. Very few can make it turn both ways at will,\r\nand therein is the trick.\r\n\r\nTake a piece of hardwood 3/8-in. square and about 9 in. long. On\r\none of the edges cut a series of notches as indicated in Fig 1.\r\nThen slightly taper the end marked B until it is nicely rounded as\r\nshown in Fig. 2. Next make an arm of a two-arm windmill such as\r\nboys make. Make a hole through the center of this one arm. Enlarge\r\nthe hole slightly, enough to allow a common pin to hold the arm to\r\nthe end B and not interfere with the revolving arm. Two or three\r\nof these arms may have to be made before one is secured that is of\r\nthe exact proportions to catch the vibrations right.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: How to Cut the Notches]\r\n\r\nTo operate the trick, grip the stick firmly in one hand, and with\r\nthe forward and backward motion of the other allow the first\r\nfinger to slide along the top edge, the second finger along the\r\nside and the thumb nail will then vibrate along the notches, thus\r\nmaking the arm revolve in one direction. To make the arm revolve\r\nin the opposite direction--keep the hand moving all the time, so\r\nthe observer will not detect the change which the band\r\nmakes--allow the first finger to slide along the top, as in the\r\nother movement, the thumb and second finger changing places: e.\r\ng., in the first movement you scratch the notches with the thumb\r\nnail while the hand is going from the body, and in the second\r\nmovement you scratch the notches with the nail of the second\r\nfinger when the hand is coming toward the body, thus producing two\r\ndifferent vibrations. In order to make it work perfectly (?) you\r\nmust of course say "skidoo" when you begin the first movement, and\r\nthen, no matter how fast the little arm is revolving when changed\r\nto the second movement, you must say "skidee" and the arm will\r\nimmediately stop and begin revolving in the opposite direction. By\r\nusing the magic words the little arm will obey your commands\r\ninstantly and your audience will be mystified. If any of your\r\naudience presume to dispute, or think they can do the same, let\r\nthem try it. You will no doubt be accused of blowing or drawing in\r\nyour breath, and many other things in order to make the arm\r\noperate. At least it is amusing. Try it and see.\r\n--Contributed by Charles Clement Bradley, Toledo, Ohio.\r\n\r\n*     *    *    *    *    *    *\r\n\r\nThe foregoing article describing the "Skidoo-Skidee Trick"\r\nappeared in a recent issue of Popular Mechanics. I have been told\r\nthat a similar arrangement is used by a tribe of Indians in the\r\nstate of Washington, by the Hindoos in India, and one friend tells\r\nme that they were sold on the streets of our large cities many\r\nyears ago.\r\n\r\nThis toy interested me so much that I have made an investigation\r\ninto the causes of its action, and I think the results may be of\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\nTo operate, one end of the notched stick is held firmly in the\r\nleft hand, while with the right hand a nail or match stick is\r\nrubbed along the notched edge, at the same time pressing with the\r\nthumb or finger of the moving hand against the oblique face of the\r\nstick. The direction of rotation depends upon which face is\r\npressed. A square stick with notches on edge is best, but the\r\nsection may be circular or even irregular in shape. The\r\nexperiments were as follows:\r\n\r\n1. A rectangular stick had notches cut on one face. When the\r\npressure was applied upon a face normal to the first, no rotation\r\nresulted. If the pressure was upon an edge, rotation was obtained.\r\n\r\n2. Irregular spacing of the notches did not interfere with the\r\naction. The depth of the notches was also unimportant, although it\r\nshould be suited to the size of the nail for best results.\r\n\r\n3. The hole in the revolving piece must be larger than the pin; if\r\nthere is a close fit no rotation is obtained.\r\n\r\n4. The center of gravity of the revolving piece must lie within\r\nthe hole. If the hole is not well centered the trick cannot be\r\nperformed.\r\n\r\n5. If the stick be clamped in a vise no results are obtained; with\r\nthis exception: if the stick has enough spring, and the end\r\nclamped is far enough away from the notched portion, the rotation\r\nmay be obtained.\r\n\r\nThe above experiments led me to the conclusion that the operation\r\nof the device is dependent upon a circular motion of the pin, and\r\nthis was confirmed by the following experiments. The action is\r\nsomewhat similar to swinging the toy known as a locust around with\r\na slight circular motion of the hand, It is necessary to show here\r\nthat a slight circular motion is sufficient to produce the result\r\nand, secondly, that such motion can be produced by the given\r\nmovements of the hands.\r\n\r\n6. A piece of brass rod was clamped in the chuck of a lathe, and a\r\ndepression made in the end slightly eccentric, by means of a\r\ncenter punch. If the end of the pin is inserted in this\r\ndepression,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Lathe Experiment]\r\n\r\nwhile the hand holding the other end of the stick is kept as\r\nnearly as possible in the axis of the lathe, rotation of the lathe\r\nwill produce rotation of the revolving piece. Speeds between 700\r\nand 1,100 r. p. m. gave the best results.\r\n\r\n7. A tiny mirror was attached to the end of the pin, and the hand\r\nheld in the sunlight so that a spot of sunlight was reflected upon\r\nthe wall. The notches were then rubbed in the usual way. The spot\r\nof light upon the wall moved in a way which disclosed two\r\ncomponents of motion, one circular and one due to the irregular\r\nmovements of the hand holding the stick. Usually the orbit was too\r\nirregular to show a continuous and closed circular path, but at\r\ntimes the circular motion became very pronounced. It was observed\r\nand the direction of rotation correctly stated by a man who was\r\nunaware of the source of the motion. The production of the\r\ncircular motion can be explained in this way:\r\n\r\nWhen the rubbing nail comes to a notch the release of pressure\r\nsends the stick upward; this upward motion against the oblique\r\npressure upon the (say) right hand side gives also a lateral\r\ncomponent of motion towards the left. As the nail strikes the\r\nopposite side of the notch the stick is knocked down again, this\r\nmotion relieves somewhat the oblique pressure from the right hand\r\nside, and, the reaction from the holding (left) hand moves the\r\nstick to the right slightly, so that it is back in the old\r\nposition for the next upward motion. Thus a circular or elliptic\r\nmotion is repeated for each notch, and the direction of this\r\nmotion is the same whether the nail be rubbed forward or back. For\r\noblique side pressure from the right (notches assumed upward), the\r\nmotion of the stick and hence of the revolving piece will be\r\ncounter-clockwise; if the pressure is from the left, it will be\r\nclockwise.\r\n\r\nThat the motion of the revolving piece is due to a swinging\r\naction, and not to friction of the pin in the hole, is proved by\r\nexperiments 3 and 4.\r\n--Contributed by M.

If the sphere is quite smooth the\r\nliquid rises up around and enclosing it in a sheath says Knowledge\r\nand Scientific News.\r\n\r\nReproduced herewith are a series of photographs showing successive\r\nstages in the entry of a rough sphere into milk and water, and the\r\nresultant "basket splash." The diameter of this sphere was about\r\n3/5 in., and the height of the fall about 6 in. Examination of the\r\nphotographs shows that the liquid, instead of flowing over and\r\nwetting the surface of the sphere, is driven violently away, so\r\nfar as can be seen from the photographs, the upper portion is, at\r\nfirst, unwetted by the liquid. The gradual thickening of the\r\ncrater wall and the corresponding reduction in the number of its\r\nlobes as the subsidence proceeds is beautifully shown. Thereafter\r\nthere rises from the depth of the crater an exquisite jet which in\r\nobedience to the law of segmentation at once splits up in its\r\nupper portion into little drops, while at the same time it gathers\r\nvolume from below and rises ultimately as a tall, graceful column\r\nto a height which may be even greater than that from which the\r\nsphere fell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Stick Pin [164]\r\n\r\nA fine stick pin or button can be made from a new one-cent piece.\r\nCarefully file out all the metal around the Indian head and\r\nslightly round the edges.

The cost of a toy electric\r\nlocomotive is beyond the reach of many boys who could just as well\r\nmake such a toy without much expense and be proud to say they\r\n"built it themselves." The electric locomotive described herewith\r\nuses for its power a small battery motor costing about $1. The\r\nfirst thing to do is to make the wheels and axles. If one has no\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Different Parts for Making the Electric\r\nLocomotive]\r\n\r\nlathe, the wheels can be turned at some machine shop. Four wheels\r\nare made from a round bar of metal, as shown in Fig. 1. Each wheel\r\nis 1/4 in. thick and 1 in. in diameter, with a 1/16-in. flange and\r\na 1/4-in. hole drilled in the center. Each pair of wheels is\r\nfitted on a 1/4-in. axle, about 2-5/8 in. long. One of the axles\r\nshould be fitted with a grooved belt wheel, as shown. Make the\r\nframe from three pieces of heavy brass, as shown in Fig. 2.\r\n\r\nThe first piece, or main part of the frame, is made from brass,\r\n3/4 in. wide and 16 in. long, bent into an oblong shape and the\r\nends soldered or bolted together. If the ends are to be soldered,\r\nbefore doing so drill four 1/4-in. holes 1 in. from the ends and\r\ninsert the ends of the axles. The other two pieces are 1/2-in.\r\nwide and of the dimensions shown in the sketch. These pieces are\r\nriveted in the middle of the oblong frame, each in its proper\r\nplace. The motor is now bolted, bottom side up, to the top of the\r\npiece fastened to the frame lengthwise. A trolley, Fig. 3, is made\r\nfrom a piece of clock spring, bent as shown, and a small piece of\r\ntin soldered to the top end for a brush connection. A groove is\r\nmade in the tin to keep the trolley wire in place.\r\n\r\nThe trolley wire is fastened to supports made of wood and of the\r\ndimensions given in Fig. 4. The trolley should be well insulated\r\nfrom the frame. The parts, put together complete, are shown in\r\nFig. 5. Run a belt from the pulley on the motor to the grooved\r\nwheel on the axle, as shown in Fig. 6, and the locomotive is ready\r\nfor running.\r\n\r\nIn making the connections the travel of the locomotive may be made\r\nmore complicated by placing a rheostat and controlling switches in\r\nthe line, so that the engine can be started and stopped at will\r\nfrom a distance and the speed regulated. Automatic switches can be\r\nattached at the ends of the line to break the circuit when the\r\nlocomotive passes a certain point.\r\n\r\nOne connection from the batteries is made to the trolley wire and\r\nthe other to a rail. The connection for the motor runs from one\r\nbinding post to the trolley and this connection must be well\r\ninsulated to avoid a short-circuit. The other binding-post is\r\nconnected to the frame.\r\n\r\nThe cost of making the wheels and purchasing the track will not be\r\nover $1.50. The track can be made from strips of tin put in a saw\r\ncut made in pieces of wood used for ties. This will save buying a\r\ntrack.\r\n--Contributed by Maurice E.

A magnetized watch must be placed in a\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Watch Demagnetizer]\r\n\r\ncoil that has an alternating current of electricity flowing\r\nthrough it to remove the magnetism. A demagnetizer can be made as\r\nshown in the illustration. Two end pieces for the coil are made as\r\nshown in Fig. 1 from 1/4-in. wood. These ends are fastened\r\ntogether, Fig. 2, with cardboard 3 in. long glued to the inside\r\nedges of the holes cut in them. Wind upon the spool thus formed\r\nabout 2 lb. of No. 16 cotton-covered copper wire. As it will be\r\nnecessary to place a 16-cp. lamp in series with the coil, both the\r\ncoil and lamp can be mounted on a suitable base and connected as\r\nshown in Fig. 3. The current, which must be 110 volt alternating\r\ncurrent, is turned on the lamp and coil and the magnetized watch\r\nslowly drawn through the opening in the center of the coil.\r\n--Contributed by Arthur Liebenberg, Cincinnati, O.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Pocket Skate Sharpener [166]\r\n\r\nSecure a square file and break off a piece, Fig 1, the length of a\r\npaper clip, Fig. 2. Draw the temper in the ends of this piece of\r\nfile, but do not heat the center. This can be done by wrapping a\r\nwet piece of cloth or asbestos around the middle and holding it in\r\nthe jaws of a pair of tongs which will only leave the end\r\nuncovered and projecting from the tongs about 1/2 in. Hold this\r\nprojecting end in a flame of a plumber\'s torch until it is a dull\r\nred. Allow this to cool slowly while in the tongs. When cold treat\r\nthe other end in the same way. This will draw the temper in only\r\nthe ends which are filed, as shown in Fig. 1, and holes drilled in\r\nthem. Also drill a hole in each end of the spring on the paper\r\nclip to match those drilled in the piece of file. Fasten the file\r\nin the clip with small bolts, as shown in Fig. 3. When the file\r\ngets filled with filings it can be removed and cleaned. Place the\r\nrunner of the skate in the clip and hold flat on the surface of\r\nthe runner. If the piece of file is fitted to the same width as\r\nthe skate runner the sides of the paper clip will hold the file\r\nlevel with the surface of the runner without any trouble. Push the\r\nclip back and forth until the skate is sharpened.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sharpener for Skates]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Old-Time Magic [167]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Trick with a Coin in a Wine Glass [167]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying sketch shows a. trick of removing a dime from the\r\nbottom of an old fashioned wine glass without touching the coin.\r\nThe dime is first placed in the bottom of the glass and then a\r\nsilver quarter dropped in on top. The quarter will not go all the\r\nway down. Blow hard into the glass in the position shown and the\r\ndime will fly out and strike the blower on the nose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Coin Trick]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Untying-a-Knot Trick [167]\r\n\r\nTie a double knot in a silk handkerchief, as shown in the\r\naccompanying sketch and tighten the last tie a little by slightly\r\ndrawing the two upper ends; then continue to tighten much more,\r\npulling vigorously at the first corner of the handkerchief, and as\r\nthis end belongs to the same corner it cannot be pulled much\r\nwithout loosening the twisted line of the knot to become a\r\nstraight line. The other corner forms a slip knot on the end,\r\nwhich can be drawn out without disturbing the form, or apparent\r\nsecurity of the knot, at the moment when you cover the knot with\r\nthe unused part of the handkerchief. When the trick is to be\r\nperformed, tie two or three very hard knots that are tightly drawn\r\nand show your audience that they are not easy to untie. The slip\r\nknot as described then must be made in apparently the same way\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Knot Trick]\r\n\r\nand untied with the thumb while the knot is in the folds of the\r\nhandkerchief.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Gear-Cutting Attachment for Small Lathes [167]\r\n\r\nWhen in need of small gears for experimental or model machines the\r\namateur usually purchases them, never thinking that he could make\r\nthem on his own lathe. A small attachment can be made to fasten in\r\nthe tool post of a lathe and the attachment made to take a mandrel\r\non which to place the blank for cutting a gear. The frame is made\r\nfrom a 1/2 in. square iron bent as shown in the sketch with the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gear-Cutting Attachment for Lathes]\r\n\r\nprojecting end filed to fit the tool post of the lathe. A pair of\r\ncenters are fitted, one of which should have a screw thread and\r\nlock nut for adjustment in putting in and removing the mandrel.\r\n\r\nAll the old clock wheels that can be found should be saved and\r\nused for index wheels. All of these wheels should be fitted to one\r\nend of the mandrel. The blank wheel is put on the outer end of the\r\nmandrel and a clock wheel having the number of teeth desired\r\nplaced on the other end. When the mandrel is put in between the\r\ncenters a small pawl is fastened with a screw to the frame with\r\nits upper end engaging in a tooth of the clock wheel. One clock\r\nwheel will index more than one number of teeth on a blank wheel.\r\nFor instance: if the clock wheel has 18 teeth it can be made to\r\nindex 6, 9 or 18 teeth to the blank by moving the number of teeth\r\neach time 3, 2 and 1 respectively. In the sketch, A shows the end\r\nof the cutter and B the side and the shape of the cutting tool.\r\nWhen the cutter A, which is in a mandrel placed in the centers of\r\nthe lathe, has finished a cut for a tooth, the pawl is disengaged\r\nand the mandrel turned to another tooth in the clock wheel.\r\n\r\nIn order to get the desired height it is sometimes necessary to\r\nblock up the lathe head and the final depth of the tooth adjusted\r\nby the two screws in the projecting end of the frame which rests\r\non the rocker in the tool post. Should too much spring occur when\r\ncutting iron gears the frame can be made rigid by blocking up the\r\nspace between it and the lathe bed.\r\n\r\nThe cutter mandrel is placed in the centers of the lathe, or\r\nshould the lathe head be raised, a short mandrel with the cutter\r\nnear the end can be placed in a chuck, and adjusted to run true.\r\nThe frame holding the mandrel, gear blank and clock wheel is\r\ninserted in the tool post of the lathe and adjusted for depth of\r\nthe cutter. The lathe is started and the gear blank fed on the\r\ncutter slowly until the tooth is cut. The pawl is released and the\r\nmandrel turned to the proper number of teeth and the operation\r\nrepeated. In this manner gears 3 in. in diameter can be made on a\r\n6-in. swing lathe.\r\n--Contributed by Samuel C.

The bottle should stand in a basin of cold\r\nwater. When the water in the test tube begins to boil the steam\r\npasses over to the bottle, where it condenses. The basin should be\r\nsupplied with cold water as fast as it begins to get warm. The\r\nrubber tube will not stand the heat very long and if the still is\r\nto be used several times, a metal tube should be supplied to\r\nconnect the test tube and bottle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Homemade Mariner\'s Compass [170]\r\n\r\nMagnetize an ordinary knitting needle, A, and push it through a\r\ncork, B, and place the cork exactly in the middle of the needle.\r\nThrust a pin, C, through the cork at right angles to the needle\r\nand stick two sharpened matches in the sides of the cork so that\r\nthey will project downward as shown.

C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Glider [171]\r\nBy Carl Bates\r\n\r\nA gliding machine is a motorless aeroplane, or flying-machine,\r\npropelled by gravity and designed to carry a passenger through the\r\nair from a high point to a lower point some distance away. Flying\r\nin a glider is simply coasting down hill on the air, and is the\r\nmost interesting and exciting sport imaginable. The style of\r\nglider described in this article is known as the "two-surface" or\r\n"double-decked" aeroplane, and is composed of two arched cloth\r\nsurfaces placed one above the other.\r\n\r\nIn building a glider the wood material used should be\r\nstraight-grained spruce, free from knots. First prepare from\r\nspruce planks the following strips of wood. Four long beams 3/4\r\nin. thick, 1-1/4 in. wide and 20 ft. long; 12 crosspieces 3/4 in.\r\nthick, 3/4 in. wide and 3 ft. long; 12 uprights 1/2 in. thick,\r\n1-1/2 in. wide and 4 ft long; 41 strips for the bent ribs 3/16 in.\r\nthick, 1/2-in. wide and 4 ft. long; 2 arm sticks 1 in. thick, 2\r\nin. wide and 3 ft. long; the rudder sticks 3/4 in. square and 8 ft\r\nlong; several strips 1/2 in. by 3/4 in. for building the vertical\r\nand horizontal rudders. The frames for the two main surfaces\r\nshould be constructed first, by bolting the crosspieces to the\r\nlong beams at the places shown by the dimensions in Fig. 1. If\r\n20-ft. lumber cannot be procured, use 10-ft. lengths and splice\r\nthem, as shown in Fig. 3. All bolts used should be 1/8 in. in\r\ndiameter and fitted with washers on both ends. These frames formed\r\nby the crosspieces should be braced by diagonal wires as shown.\r\nAll wiring is done with No. 16 piano wire.\r\n\r\nThe 41 ribs may be nailed to the main frames on the upper side by\r\nusing fine flat-headed brads 7/8 in. long. These ribs are spaced 1\r\nft. apart and extend 1 ft. beyond the rear edges of the main\r\nframes, as shown in Fig. 1. After nailing one end of a rib to the\r\nfront long beam, the rib is arched by springing down the loose end\r\nand nailing to the rear beam. The ribs should have a curve as\r\nshown in Fig. 2, the amount of curvature being the same in all the\r\nribs.\r\n\r\nThe frames of the main surfaces are now ready to be covered with\r\ncloth. Cambric or bleached muslin should be used for the covering,\r\nwhich is tacked to the front edge, stretched tightly over the bent\r\nribs and fastened securely with tacks to the rear ends of the\r\nribs. The cloth should also be glued to the ribs for safety. In\r\nthe center of the lower plane surface there should be an opening 2\r\nft. wide and 4 ft. long for the body of the operator. Place the\r\ntwo main surfaces 4 ft. apart and connect with the 12 uprights,\r\nplaced in the corner of each crosspiece and beam. The uprights are\r\nfastened by bolting to the crosspieces, as shown in Fig. 2. The\r\nwhole structure is made strong and rigid by bracing with diagonal\r\nwires, both laterally and longitudinally.\r\n\r\nThe vertical rudder is to keep the machine headed into the wind\r\nand is not movable. This rudder is made of cloth stretched over a\r\nlight wooden frame, which is nailed to the rudder sticks\r\nconnecting to the main frame. The horizontal rudder is also made\r\nof cloth stretched over a light wooden frame, and arranged to\r\nintersect the vertical rudder at its center. This rudder is held\r\nin position and strengthened by diagonal wires and guy wires. The\r\nhorizontal rudder is also immovable and its function is to prevent\r\nthe machine from diving, and also to keep it steady in its flight.\r\nThe rudders are fastened to the glider by the two rudder sticks,\r\nand these sticks are held rigid by diagonal wire and also by guy\r\nwires leading to the sides of the main frames as shown in Fig. 1.\r\nThe two arm sticks should be spaced about 13 in. apart and bolted\r\nto the long beams in the center of the opening in the lower plane\r\nwhere the operator is to take his position.\r\n\r\nThe glider should be examined to see\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Details of the Glider]\r\n\r\nthat the frame is not warped or twisted. The surfaces must be true\r\nor the machine will be hard to balance when in flight. To make a\r\nglide, take the glider to the top of a hill, get in between the\r\narm sticks and lift the machine up until the arm sticks are under\r\nthe arms as shown run a few steps against the wind and leap from\r\nthe ground. You will find that the machine has a surprising amount\r\nof lift, and if the weight of the body is in the right place you\r\nwill go shooting down the hillside in free flight. The landing is\r\nmade by pushing the weight of the body backwards. This will cause\r\nthe glider to tip up in front, slacken speed and settle. The\r\noperator can then land safely and gently on his feet. Of course,\r\nthe beginner should learn by taking short jumps, gradually\r\nincreasing the distance as he gains skill and experience in\r\nbalancing and landing.\r\n\r\nThe proper position of the body is slightly ahead of the center of\r\nthe planes, but this must be found by experience. The machine\r\nshould not be used in winds blowing faster than 15 miles an hour.\r\nGlides are always made against the wind, and the balancing is done\r\nby moving the legs. The higher the starting point the farther one\r\nmay fly. Great care should be exercised in making landings;\r\notherwise the operator might suffer a sprained ankle or perhaps a\r\nbroken limb. The illustration shows two lines of flight from a\r\nhilltop, the glider travels on the upper line caused by the body\r\nof the operator taking a position a little back of the proper\r\nplace, and on the lower line he changes his position from front to\r\nback while flying, which causes the dip in the line.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Boys Representing the Centaur [173]\r\n\r\nThis is a diversion in which two boys personate a Centaur, a\r\ncreature of Greek mythology, half man and half horse.

The\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Making Up the Centaur]\r\n\r\nsecond player is covered over with a. shawl or table cover which\r\nis pinned around the waist of the first player. A tail made of\r\nstrips of cloth or paper is pinned to the rear end of the cover.\r\nThe first player should hold a bow and arrow and have a cloak\r\nthrown loosely over his shoulder as shown in Fig. 2. Imitation\r\nhoofs of pasteboard may be made and fastened over the shoes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Home-Made Ladle for Melting Babbitt [173]\r\n\r\nSecure a large sized old bicycle bell and rivet a heavy wire or\r\nstrap iron on one side for a handle.

Olson, Bellingham, Wash\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Flash Lamp [174]\r\n\r\nIndoor photographs are made much better with the use of a\r\nflashlight than by depending on light from windows. The lighting\r\ncan be made from any direction to suit the operator. If lighting\r\nflash powder when not in a regular flash lamp the flash cannot be\r\ndepended upon and in some instances is dangerous. To make a simple\r\nand inexpensive flash lamp, first secure from your druggist an\r\nempty salve box about 3 in. in diameter. While at the drug store\r\nget 3 ft. of small rubber tubing; this will cost about 15 cents.\r\nNow visit the tin shop and get a small piece of scrap tin 3 or 4\r\nin. square; a piece of brass or steel wire, about the size of\r\nstove pipe wire, 14 in. long. These with a strip of light asbestos\r\npaper and some small iron wire, about the size of door screen\r\nwire, will complete the material list.\r\n\r\nCarefully punch a hole through the salve box on one side near the\r\nbottom with a 10-penny nail. Cut a strip of tin 2 in. long and\r\nabout 3/8 in. wide and roll this around a 8-penny nail so as to\r\nform a small tube which will just fit the hole made in the salve\r\nbox. Next roll up a strip of tin 1/2 in. wide into a small cup\r\nabout 3/8 in. in diameter at one end and 1/4 in. at the other.\r\n\r\nPlace the tube in the nail hole so that one end comes almost to\r\nthe center of the box inside and the other end projects about 1/2\r\nin. outside the box. Cut out a little place for the tube to enter\r\nthe cup at the small end and then solder the tube and cup to the\r\nbottom of the box as shown in the illustration. The tube and cup\r\nshould be well soldered on the seams to make them airtight. Bend a\r\nring on one end of the larger piece of wire, making it 2-1/2 in.\r\nin diameter and form the remaining portion of the wire into a\r\nspiral, soldering the end in the bottom of the box near the cup.\r\nWrap the ring at the top of the spiral piece of wire all the way\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Made from a Tin Salve Box ]\r\n\r\naround with the strip of asbestos paper, wrapping them together\r\nover and over until the entire ring is covered. Slip the end of\r\nthe rubber tube over the tin tube on the side of the box and the\r\nflash lamp is complete.\r\n\r\nTo make a flash with this lamp fill the little cup in the center\r\nwith flash powder and moisten the asbestos ring with alcohol. When\r\nall is ready for the picture the alcohol is lighted and a quick\r\nblow of the breath through the rubber tube will force the flash\r\npowder upward into the flame and cause the flash.\r\n\r\nWhen through with the lamp place the cover over it, pushing the\r\nasbestos ring down inside the box. Wind the rubber tubing around\r\nthe box and you have a neat outfit that can be carried in the\r\npocket.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Photographing the New Moon [174]\r\n\r\nTo make a photograph of the moon is quite difficult and no good\r\npicture can be made without an expensive apparatus. At home and\r\nwith your own hand camera you can make a good picture of the new\r\nmoon by the use of a flash light on a tennis ball, the tennis ball\r\ntaking the part of the moon. The ball is suspended in front of a\r\nblack cloth screen, the camera focused by holding a burning match\r\nnear the ball and the exposure made by burning a\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tennis Ball Photographed]\r\n\r\nsmall quantity of flash powder at one side and a little below the\r\nball. The light from the flash only striking one side of the ball\r\ngives the effect of the new moon. --Photo by M. M. Hunting,\r\nDayton, O.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Old-Time Magic- Part II [175]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Removing Scissors from a Cord [175]\r\n\r\nA piece of strong cord is doubled and fastened to a pair of\r\nscissors with a slip knot, as shown in Fig. 1. After passing the\r\nends of the cord through the thumb hole of the scissors they are\r\ntied fast to a chair, door knob or any other object that may be of\r\nsufficient size to make the ends secure. The trick is to release\r\nthe scissors without cutting the cord.\r\n\r\nTake hold of the loop end of the cord in the lower handle and\r\ndrawing it first\r\n\r\n[Illustration: How the Scissors Are Removed]\r\n\r\nthrough the upper handle and then completely over the blades of\r\nthe scissors, as shown in Fig. 2. This is very simple when you\r\nknow how, but puzzling when the trick is first seen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Coin and Card on the First Finger [175]\r\n\r\nThis is a simple trick that many can do at the first attempt,\r\nwhile others will fail time after time. It is a good trick to\r\nspring upon a company casually if you have practiced it\r\nbeforehand. A playing card is balanced on the tip of the\r\nforefinger and a penny placed on top immediately over the finger\r\nend, as shown in the sketch. With the right hand forefinger and\r\nthumb strike the edge of the card sharply. If done properly the\r\ncard will flyaway, leaving the penny poised on the finger end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Coin and Card]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make Sealing Wax Hat Pins [175]\r\n\r\nSelect a stick of sealing wax of the desired color for the\r\nfoundation of the hat pin. Hold the end of the stick over a flame\r\nuntil the wax is soft enough to drop; then put it on the hat-pin\r\nhead. When sufficient wax has adhered to the pin, hold the lump\r\nover the flame, revolving the pin at the same time so the wax will\r\nnot drop and the head will form a round ball. The head can be made\r\nin any shape desired while warm. When the desired shape has been\r\nobtained, cool thoroughly in cold water and dry carefully.\r\n\r\nStripes and designs may be put on the foundation by applying drops\r\nof other brilliant colored wax, and by careful manipulation the\r\nwax when warm can be made to flow around the pin head and form\r\npretty stripes and designs. If a certain color is to be more\r\nprominent, the wax to make this color must be applied last and the\r\npin put through the flame again. Cool in water and dry, as before,\r\nand pass once more through the flame to obtain the luster.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Old-Time Magic-Part III [176]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Disappearing Coin [176]\r\n\r\nWhile this is purely a sleight-of-hand trick, it will take very\r\nlittle practice to cause the coin to disappear instantly. Take a\r\nquarter of a dollar between the thumb and finger, as shown, and by\r\na rapid twist of the fingers whirl the coin and at the same time\r\nclose the hand, and the coin will disappear up your coat sleeve.\r\nOn opening the hand the coin will not be seen. Take three quarters\r\nand hold one in the palm of the left hand, place the other two,\r\none between the thumb and finger of each hand, then give the coin\r\nin the right hand a whirl, as described, closing both hands\r\nquickly. The coin in the right hand will disappear up your sleeve,\r\nand the left hand on being unclosed will contain two quarters,\r\nwhile the one in the right shall have disappeared.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Disappearing Coin]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Sticking a Coin Against the Wall [176]\r\n\r\nCut a small notch in a coin--ten cent piece or quarter will do--so\r\na small point will project. When this is pressed firmly against a\r\nwood casing or partition the coin will stick tightly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Chinese Outdoor Game [176]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying illustration shows the "grand whirl," or the\r\nChinese students\' favorite game. This game is played by five\r\npersons, four of them turning around the fifth or central figure\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chinese Doing the Grand Whirl]\r\n\r\nwith their arms locked about each other and the two outside\r\npersons swinging in midair with their bodies almost horizontal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Home-Made Photograph of a Lightning Flash [176]\r\n\r\nHow many times has each amateur photographer tried to photograph\r\nthe lightning\'s flash? Some good pictures have been obtained by a\r\nceaseless effort on the part of the operator. Here is a method by\r\nwhich you can make a picture of a streak of lightning on a clear\r\nnight in your own house. Paste two strips of black paper on a\r\npiece of glass that is 10 in. square so as to leave a clear space\r\nthrough the center 2-in. or more in width. Smoke this uncovered\r\nspace over a candle\'s flame until the soot is thick enough to\r\nprevent light passing through. Take a sharp lead pencil and\r\noutline a flash of lightning upon the smoked surface, using a fine\r\nneedle to make the smaller lines, and then set the glass up\r\nagainst the back of two boxes which are set to have a space\r\nbetween them of 4 or 5 in.\r\n\r\nA lighted candle is held behind the glass so the light will shine\r\nthrough for focusing the camera. After darkening the room set your\r\ncamera ready for the exposure and burn a small quantity of flash\r\nlight powder in the same place in which the candle was held. This\r\nwill make an impression upon the plate of the flash drawn on the\r\nsmoked glass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lightning Flash]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Static Machine [177]\r\n\r\nStatic electricity is produced by revolving glass plates upon\r\nwhich a number of sectors are cemented; these sectors, passing\r\nthrough neutralizing brushes, distribute electric charges\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Details of a Homemade Static Machine]\r\n\r\nto collecting combs attached to discharging rods. The glass\r\nselected for the plates must be clear white glass, free from\r\nwrinkles, and of a uniform thickness. Two plates are necessary to\r\nmake this machine, and the glass should be of sufficient size to\r\ncut a circular plate 16-in. in diameter. A hole must be made\r\nexactly in the center of each plate, and this should be done\r\nbefore cutting the circle. One of the best ways to make the hole\r\nis to drill the glass with a very hard-tempered drill, the cutting\r\nedge of which should be kept moistened with 2 parts turpentine and\r\n1 part sweet oil while drilling. The hole is to be made 3/4 in. in\r\ndiameter. The circle is then marked on each plate and cut with a\r\nglass cutter. The plates are trued up, after they are mounted, by\r\nholding a piece of emery wheel to the edges while they are\r\nturning. Water should be applied to the edges while doing the\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe sectors are cut from tinfoil, 1-1/2 in. wide at one end, 3/4\r\nin. at the other, and 4 in. long. A thin coat of shellac varnish\r\nis applied to both sides of the plates, and 16 sectors put on one\r\nside of each plate, as shown in Fig. 1. The divisions can be\r\nmarked on the opposite side of the plate and a circle drawn as a\r\nguide to place the sectors at proper intervals.\r\n\r\nThe sectors should lie flat on the glass with all parts smoothed\r\nout so that they will not be torn from their places as the plates\r\nrevolve. The shellac should be tacky when the pieces of tinfoil\r\nare put in place.\r\n\r\nThe collectors are made, as shown in Fig. 2, from about 1/4-in.\r\ncopper wire with two brass balls soldered to the ends. The fork\r\npart is 6 in. long and the shank 4 in. Holes are drilled on the\r\ninside of the forks, and pins inserted and soldered. These pins,\r\nor teeth, should be long enough to be very close to the sectors\r\nand yet not scratch them when the plates are turning.\r\n\r\nThe frame of the machine is made from any kind of finished wood\r\nwith dimensions shown in Fig. 3, the side pieces being 24 in. long\r\nand the standards 3 in. wide. The two pieces, C C, Fig. 3, are\r\nmade from solid, close grained wood turned in the shape shown,\r\nwith the face that rests against the plate 4 in. in diameter, and\r\nthe outer end 1-1/2 in. in diameter, the smaller end being turned\r\nwith a groove for a round belt. Before turning the pieces a hole\r\nis bored through each piece for the center, and this hole must be\r\nof such a size as to take a brass tube that has an internal\r\ndiameter of 3/4 in. The turned pieces are glued to the glass\r\nplates over the center holes and on the same side on which the\r\nsectors are fastened. Several hours\' time will be required for the\r\nglue to set. A fiber washer is then put between the plates and a\r\nbrass tube axle placed through the hole. The plates, turned wood\r\npieces, and brass axle turn on a stationary axle, D.\r\n\r\nThe drive wheels, EE, are made from 7/8-in. material 7 in. in\r\ndiameter, and are fastened on a round axle cut from a broom\r\nhandle. This wood axle is centrally bored to admit a metal rod\r\ntightly, and extends through the standards with a crank attached\r\nto one end.\r\n\r\nTwo solid glass rods, GG, Fig. 4, 1 in. in diameter and 15 in.\r\nlong, are fitted in holes bored into the end pieces of the frame.\r\nTwo pieces of 1-in. brass tubing and the discharging rods, RR, are\r\nsoldered into two hollow brass balls 2 or 2-1/2 in. in diameter.\r\nThe shanks of the collectors are fitted in these brass balls with\r\nthe ends extending, to which insulating handles are attached.\r\nBrass balls are soldered to the upper ends of the discharging\r\nrods, one having a 2-in. ball and the other one 3/4 in. in\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\nCaps made from brass are fitted tightly on the ends of the\r\nstationary shaft, D, and drilled through their diameter to admit\r\nheavy copper rods, KK, which are bent as shown. Tinsel or fine\r\nwire such as contained in flexible electric wire are soldered to\r\nthe ends of these rods, and the brushes thus made must be adjusted\r\nso they will just touch the plates. The caps are fitted with\r\nscrews for adjusting the brushes. These rods and brushes are\r\ncalled the neutralizers. A little experimenting will enable one to\r\nproperly locate the position of the neutralizers for best results.\r\n--Contributed by C.

The\r\nmoney was raised by various means to purchase the cement, and the\r\nwork was done by themselves. The ground was selected in a secluded\r\nspot in a neighbor\'s back yard and a hole dug to a depth of 4 ft.,\r\n12 ft. wide and 22 ft. long. The concrete was made by mixing 1\r\npart cement, 4 parts sand and 10 parts gravel together and the\r\nbulk moistened with water. The bottom was made the same as laying\r\na sidewalk, and forms were only used for the inside of the\r\nsurrounding wall. The tank may be hidden with shrubbery or vines\r\nplanted to grow over a poultry wire fence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Old-Time Magic-Part IV [179]\r\n\r\nCutting a Thread Inside of a Glass Bottle [179]\r\n\r\nThis is a trick which can only be performed when the sun shines,\r\nbut it\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Glass Directs the Sun\'s Rays]\r\n\r\nis a good one. Procure a clear glass bottle and stick a pin in the\r\nlower end of the cork. Attach a thread to the pin and tie a small\r\nweight to the end of the thread so it will hang inside the bottle\r\nwhen the cork is in place. Inform your audience that you will\r\nsever the thread and cause the weight to drop without removing the\r\ncork.\r\n\r\nAll that is required to perform the feat is to hold a magnifying\r\nglass so as to direct the sun\'s rays on the thread. The thread\r\nwill quickly burn and the weight fall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Removing a Key from a Double String [179]\r\n\r\nTie the ends of a 5-ft. string together, making a double line on\r\nwhich a key is placed and the string held as shown by the dotted\r\nlines in the sketch. Turn the palms of the hands toward you and\r\nreach over with the little finger of the right hand and take hold\r\nof the inside line near the left-hand thumb.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "The Key Will Drop from the String"]\r\n\r\nReverse the operation and take hold of the inside line near\r\nright-hand thumb with the little finger of the left hand. You will\r\nthen have the string as it appears in the sketch. Quickly let\r\nloose of the string with a little finger on one hand and a thumb\r\non the other and pull the string taut. The key will drop from the\r\nstring.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Bore a Square Hole [179]\r\n\r\nYou would not consider it possible to bore a square hole in a\r\npiece of cardboard, yet such a thing can be done. Take a cardboard\r\nor a thin piece of wood, fold and place it between two pieces of\r\nboard with the fold up; the boards are then put in a vise as\r\nshown. Start the bit with the screw point in the fold, using a\r\n1-in. bit, and bore a\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Boring a Square Hole]\r\n\r\nhole 1/2 in. deep. When the cardboard is taken from the vise it\r\nwill appear as shown at B and when unfolded, as at A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** HOW TO MAKE COPPER TRAYS [180]\r\n\r\nCopper trays such as are shown in the accompanying illustration\r\nare very useful as well as ornamental about the house. They can be\r\nused to keep pins and needles, pens and pencils, or cigar ashes,\r\netc. They are easily made, require no equipment in the way of\r\ntools except what are usually found about the house, unless it\r\nwould be the metal shears, and when the decorations are well\r\ndesigned and the metal nicely colored, they make attractive little\r\npieces to have about.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to do in preparation for making them is to prepare\r\nthe design. Simple designs work out better than fussy ones and are\r\nmore likely to be within the ability of the amateur. Having\r\ndetermined the size of the tray, draw on paper an oblong to\r\nrepresent it. Inside this oblong, draw another one to represent\r\nthe lines along which the metal is to be bent up to form the\r\nsides. Inside this there should be drawn still another oblong to\r\nrepresent the margin up to which the background is to be worked.\r\nThe trays shown are 5-3/4 by 6-3/4 in., the small ash tray 4 by 4\r\nin., the long pen and pencil tray 4-3/4 by 9-1/2 in. The second\r\noblong was 3/4 in. inside the first on all, and the third one 1/4\r\nin. inside the second on all.\r\n\r\nIf the decoration is to have two parts alike--symmetrical--divide\r\nthe space with a line down the middle. Draw one-half the design\r\nfree hand, then fold along this line and trace the second half\r\nfrom this one. If the lines have been drawn with soft pencil,\r\nrubbing the back of the paper with a knife handle will force\r\nenough of the lead to the second side so that the outline can be\r\ndetermined. Four-part symmetry will require two lines and two\r\nfoldings, etc.\r\n\r\nFor the metal working there will be needed a pair of tin shears,\r\ntwo spikes, file, flat and round-nosed pliers, screw-driver and\r\nsheet copper of No. 23 gauge. Proceed as follows: 1. Cut off a\r\npiece of copper so that it shall have 1/2 in. extra metal on each\r\nof the four sides. 2. With a piece of carbon paper trace upon the\r\ncopper lines that\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Articles Made from Copper]\r\n\r\nshall represent the margin of the tray proper and the lines along\r\nwhich the upturned sides of the tray are to be bent; also trace\r\nthe decorative design. 3. With a nail make a series of holes in\r\nthe extra margin, about 3/4-in. apart and large enough to take in\r\na 3/4-in. slim screw. 4. Fasten the metal to a thick board by\r\ninserting screws in these holes. 5. With a 20-penny wire nail that\r\nhas the sharpness of its point filed off, stamp the background\r\npromiscuously. By holding the nail about 1/4 in. above the work\r\nand striking it with the hammer, at the same time striving to keep\r\nit at 1/4 in. above the metal, very rapid progress can be made.\r\nThis stamping lowers the background and at the same time raises\r\nthe design. 6. Chase or stamp along the border of the design and\r\nbackground, using a nail filed to chisel edge. This is to make a\r\nclean, sharp division between background and design. 7. When the\r\nstamping is completed, remove the screws and the metal from the\r\nboard and cut off the extra margin with the metal shears. File the\r\nedges until they are smooth to the touch. 8. With the flat pliers\r\n"raise" one side of the tray, then the other side. 9. Raise the\r\nends, adjusting the corners as shown in the illustration. Use the\r\nround-nosed pliers for this purpose.\r\n\r\nCopper is frequently treated chemically to give it color. Very\r\npretty effects may be obtained by covering the tray with\r\nturpentine, then moving it about over a flame such as a bunsen\r\nburner until the turpentine burns off. The copper will "take on"\r\nalmost all the colors of a rainbow, and the effect will be most\r\npleasing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Photograph of a Clown Face [181]\r\n\r\nAt first glance the accompanying photograph will appear as if the\r\nperson photographed is wearing a false face or has his face\r\npainted like a clown. On close observation you will notice that\r\nthe face is made on the bald head of the person sitting behind the\r\ntable. The eyes, nose and mouth are cut from black paper and\r\npasted on the bald spot. The subject\'s face is horizontal and\r\nresting upon his hands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Bald Head Photographed]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Finger Mathematics [181]\r\nBy Charles C. Bradley\r\n\r\nAll machinists use mathematics. Ask a machinist what would be the\r\nproduct of 9 times 8 and his ready reply would be 72, but change\r\nthe figures a little and say 49 times 48 and the chances are that\r\ninstead of replying at once he will have to figure it out with a\r\npencil. By using the following method it is just as easy to tell\r\nat a glance what 99 times 99 are as 9 times 9. You will be able to\r\nmultiply far beyond your most sanguine expectations.\r\n\r\nIn the first numbering, begin by holding your hands with the palms\r\ntoward the body and make imaginary numbers on the thumbs and\r\nfingers as follows: Thumbs, 6; first fingers, 7; second fingers,\r\n8; third fingers, 9, and fourth fingers, 10. Suppose you desire to\r\nmultiply 8 by 9, put the eighth finger on one hand against the\r\nninth finger of the other hand as shown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "8 Times 9"]\r\n\r\nThe two joined fingers and all the fingers above them (calling the\r\nthumbs fingers) are called the upper fingers and each has a value\r\nof ten, which tens are added. All the fingers below the joined\r\nfingers are termed the lower fingers, and each of the lower\r\nfingers represents a unit value of one. The sum of the units on\r\none hand should be multiplied by the sum of the units on the other\r\nhand. The total tens added to this last named sum will give the\r\nproduct desired. Thus: Referring to above picture or to your hands\r\nwe find three tens on the left hand and four tens on the right,\r\nwhich would be 70. We also find two units on the left hand and one\r\non the right. Two times one are two, and 70 plus 2 equals 72, or\r\nthe product of 8 times 9.\r\n\r\nSupposing 6 times 6 were the figures. Put your thumbs together;\r\nthere are no fingers above, so the two thumbs represent two tens\r\nor 20; below the thumbs are four units on each hand, which would\r\nbe 16, and 20 plus 16 equals 36, or the product of 6 times 6.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "6 Times 6"   "10 Times 7"]\r\n\r\nSupposing 10 times 7 is desired. Put the little finger of the left\r\nhand against the first finger of the right hand. At a glance you\r\nsee seven tens or 70. On the right hand you have three units and\r\non the left nothing. Three times nothing gives you nothing and 70\r\nplus nothing is 70.\r\n\r\nIn the second numbering, or numbers above 10, renumber your\r\nfingers; thumbs, 11; first fingers, 12, etc. Let us multiply 12 by\r\n12.\r\n\r\nPut together the tips of the fingers labeled 12. At a glance you\r\nsee four tens or 40. At this point we leave the method explained\r\nin Case 1 and ignore the units (lower fingers) altogether. We go\r\nback to the upper fingers again\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "12 Times 12"]\r\n\r\nand multiply the number of upper fingers used on the one hand by\r\nthe number of upper fingers used on the other hand, viz., 2 times\r\n2 equals 4. Adding 4 to 40 gives us 44. We now add 100 (because\r\nanything over 10 times 10 would make over 100) and we have 144,\r\nthe product of 12 times 12.\r\n\r\nThe addition of 100 is arbitrary, but being simple it saves time\r\nand trouble. Still, if we wish, we might regard the four upper\r\nfingers in the above example as four twenties, or 80, and the six\r\nlower fingers as six tens, or 60; then returning to the upper\r\nfingers and multiplying the two on the right hand by the two on\r\nthe left we would have 4; hence 80 plus 60 plus 4 equals 144;\r\ntherefore the rule of adding the lump sum is much the quicker and\r\neasier method.\r\n\r\nAbove 10 times 10 the lump sum to add is 100; above 15 times 15 it\r\nis 200; above 20 times 20, 400; 25 times 25, 600, etc., etc., as\r\nhigh as you want to go.\r\n\r\nIn the third numbering to multiply above 15 renumber your fingers,\r\nbeginning the thumbs with 16, first finger 17, and so on. Oppose\r\nthe proper finger tips as before, the upper fingers representing a\r\nvalue of 20. Proceed as in the first numbering and add 200. Take\r\nFor example 18 times 18.\r\n\r\nAt a glance we see six twenties plus 2 units on left hand times 2\r\nunits on right hand plus 200 equals 324.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth numbering the fingers are marked, thumbs, 21, first\r\nfingers 22, etc., the value of the upper fingers being 20. Proceed\r\nas in the second lumbering, adding 400 instead of 100.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "18 Times 18"]\r\n\r\nAbove 25 times 25 the upper fingers represent a value of 30 each\r\nand after proceeding as in the third numbering you add 600 instead\r\nof 200.\r\n\r\nThis system can be carried as high as you want to go, but you must\r\nremember that for figures ending in 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 proceed as in\r\nthe second numbering. For figures ending in 6, 7, 8, 9 and 10 the\r\nthird numbering applies.\r\n\r\nDetermine the value of the upper fingers whether they represent\r\ntens, twenties, thirties, forties, or what. For example, any two\r\nfigures between 45 and 55, the value of the upper fingers would be\r\n50, which is the half-way point between the two fives. In 82 times\r\n84 the value of the upper fingers would be 80 (the half-way point\r\nbetween the two fives, 75 and 85, being 80). And the lump sum to\r\nadd.\r\n\r\nJust three things to remember:\r\n\r\nWhich numbering is to follow, whether the one described in second\r\nor third numbering; the value which the upper fingers have; and,\r\nlastly, the lump sum to add, and you will be able to multiply\r\nfaster and more accurately than you ever dreamed of before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Optical Illusions [183]\r\n\r\nIf a person observes fixedly for some time two balls hanging on\r\nthe end of cords which are in rapid revolution, not rotation,\r\nabout a vertical axis, the direction of revolution will seem to\r\nreverse. In some experiments two incandescent "pills" of platinum\r\nsponge, such as an used for lighting gas-burners, were hung in\r\ntiny aluminum bells from a mica vane wheel which was turned\r\nconstantly and rapidly in one direction by hot air from a gas\r\nflame to keep the platinum in a glow. The inversion and reversion\r\ndid not take place, as one might suppose, at the will of the\r\nobserver, but was compulsory and followed regular rules. If the\r\nobserver watches the rotating objects from the side, or from above\r\nor from below, the inversion takes place against his will; the\r\ncondition being that the image on the retina shall be eccentric.\r\nIt takes place also, however, with a change in the convergence of\r\nthe optical axes, whether they are parallel to each other or more\r\nconvergent. Also when the image on the retina is made less\r\ndistinct by the use of a convex or concave lens, the revolution\r\nseems to reverse; further, in the case of a nearsighted person,\r\nwhen he removes his spectacles,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Illusions Shown by Revolving Platinum Sponge\r\n"Pills" and Hat Pins]\r\n\r\ninversion results every time that the image on the retina is not\r\nsharp. But even a change in the degree of indistinctness causes\r\ninversion.\r\n\r\nThe cause of this optical illusion is the same where the wings of\r\nwindmills are observed in the twilight as a silhouette. It is then\r\nnot a question of which is the front or the back of the wheel, but\r\nwhether one of the wings or the other comes towards the observer.\r\nThe experiment is made more simple by taking a hat pin with a\r\nconspicuous head, holding it firmly in a horizontal position, and\r\nputting a cork on the point. Looking at it in semi-darkness, one\r\nseems to see sometimes the head of the pin, sometimes the point\r\ntowards him, when he knows which direction is right. The inversion\r\nwill be continued as soon as one observes fixedly a point at the\r\nside. Here it is a question of the perception of depth or\r\ndistance; and this is the same in the case of the rotating balls;\r\nthe direction of seeming revolution depends on which one of them\r\none considers to be the front one and which the rear one.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing the following conclusion may be reached: When,\r\nin the case of a perception remitting two appearances, one fixedly\r\nobserves one of these and then permits or causes change in the\r\nsharpness of the image on the retina, the other appearance asserts\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Steam Engine Made from Gas Pipe and Fittings [184]\r\n\r\nAlmost all the material used in the construction\' of the parts for\r\nthe small steam engine illustrated herewith was made from gas pipe\r\nand fittings. The cylinder consists of a 3-in. tee, the third\r\nopening being threaded and filled with a cast-iron plug turned to\r\nsuch a depth that when the interior was bored out on a lathe the\r\nbottom of the plug bored to the same radius as the other part of\r\nthe tee. The outside end of the plug extended about 1/4-in. and\r\nthe surface was made smooth for the valve seat. A flat slide valve\r\nwas used.\r\n\r\nThe ports were not easy to make, as\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Engine Is About 20 Inches High]\r\n\r\nthey had to be drilled and chipped out. The steam chest is round,\r\nas it had to be made to fit the round tee connection. The\r\ncrosshead runs in guides made from a piece of gas pipe with the\r\nsides cut out and threads cut on both ends. One end is screwed\r\ninto a rim turned on the cylinder head and the other is fitted\r\ninto an oblong plate. Both ends of this plate were drilled and\r\ntapped to receive 1-1/2-in. pipe.\r\n\r\nThe main frame consists of one 1-1/2in. pipe 10 in. long and one\r\nmade up from two pieces of pipe and a cross to make the whole\r\nlength 10 in. These pipes were then screwed into pipe flanges that\r\nserved as a base. The open part of the cross was babbitted to\r\nreceive the main shaft. The end of the shaft has a pillow block to\r\ntake a part of the strain from the main bearing. The eccentric is\r\nconstructed of washers. While this engine does not give much\r\npower, it is easily built, inexpensive, and anyone with a little\r\nmechanical ability can make one by closely following out the\r\nconstruction as shown in the illustration.\r\n--Contributed by W. H. Kutscher, Springfield, Ill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Copper Bowl [185]\r\n\r\nTo make a copper bowl, such as is shown in the illustration,\r\nsecure a piece of No. 21 gauge sheet copper of a size sufficient\r\nto make a circular disk 6-1/2 in. in diameter.\r\n\r\nCut the copper to the circular form and size just mentioned, and\r\nfile the edge so that it will be smooth and free from sharp\r\nplaces. With a pencil compass put on a series of concentric rings\r\nabout 1/2 in. apart. These are to aid the eye in beating the bowl\r\nto form.\r\n\r\nThe tools are simple and can be made easily. First make a\r\nround-nosed mallet of some hard wood, which should have a diameter\r\nof about 1-1/4 in, across the head. If nothing better is at hand,\r\nsaw off a section of a broom handle, round one end and insert a\r\nhandle into a hole bored in its middle. Next take a block of wood,\r\nabout 3 by 3 by 6 in., and make in one end a hollow, about 2 in.\r\nacross and 1/2 in. deep. Fasten the block solidly, as in a vise,\r\nand while holding the copper on the hollowed end of the block,\r\nbeat with the mallet along the concentric rings.\r\n\r\nBegin at the center and work along the rings--giving the copper a\r\ncircular movement as the beating proceeds--out toward the rim.\r\nContinue the circular movement and work from the rim back toward\r\nthe center. This operation is to be continued until the bowl has\r\nthe shape desired, when the bottom is flattened by placing the\r\nbowl, bottom side up, on a flat surface and beating the raised\r\npart flat. Beating copper tends to harden it and, if continued too\r\nlong without proper treatment, will cause the metal to break. To\r\novercome this hardness, heat the copper over a bed of coals or a\r\nBunsen burner to a good heat. This process is called annealing, as\r\nit softens the metal.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of a bowl is greatly enhanced by the addition of a\r\nborder. In the illustration the border design shown was laid out\r\nin pencil, a small hole was drilled with a band drill in each\r\nspace and a small-bladed metal saw inserted and the part sawed\r\nout.\r\n\r\nTo produce color effects on copper, cover the copper with\r\nturpentine and\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Shaping the Bowl and Sawing the Lace]\r\n\r\nhold over a Bunsen burner until all parts are well heated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Cleaning Furniture [185]\r\n\r\nAfter cleaning furniture, the greasy appearance may be removed by\r\nadding some good, sharp vinegar to the furniture polish. Vinegar,\r\nwhich is nothing else than diluted acetic acid, is one of the best\r\ncleansers of dirty furniture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Melting Lead in Tissue Paper [185]\r\n\r\nTake a buckshot, wrap it tightly in one thickness of tissue paper,\r\nand, holding the ends of the paper in the fingers of each hand,\r\nplace the part that holds the shot over the flame of a match just\r\nfar enough away from the flame not to burn the paper. In a few\r\nseconds unfold the paper and you will find that the shot has\r\nmelted without even scorching the paper.\r\n--Contributed by W. O. Hay, Camden, S. C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** The Principles of the Stereograph [185]\r\n\r\nEach of our eyes sees a different picture of any object; the one\r\nsees a trifle more to the right-hand side, the other to the left,\r\nespecially when the object is near to the observer. The\r\nstereoscope is the instrument which effects this result by\r\nbringing the two pictures together in the senses. The stereograph\r\nproduces this result in another way than by prisms as in the\r\nstereoscope. In the first place there is\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Looking Through the Colored Gelatine]\r\n\r\nonly one picture, not two mounted side by side. The stereograph\r\nconsists of a piece of card, having therein two circular openings\r\nabout 1-1/4 in. diameter, at a distance apart corresponding to the\r\ndistance between the centers of the pupils. The openings are\r\ncovered with transparent gelatine, the one for the left eye being\r\nblue, that for the right, orange. The picture is viewed at a\r\ndistance of about 7 in. from the stereograph. As a result of\r\nlooking at it through the stereograph, one sees a colorless black\r\nand white picture which stands out from the background. Try\r\nlooking at the front cover of Popular Mechanics through these\r\ncolored gelatine openings and the effect will be produced.\r\n\r\nIf one looks at the picture first with the right eye alone through\r\nthe orange glass, and then with the left eye through the blue\r\nglass, one will understand the principle on which the little\r\ninstrument works. Looking through the blue glass with the left\r\neye, one sees only those portions which are red on the picture.\r\nBut they seem black. The reason is that the red rays are absorbed\r\nby the blue filter. Through the orange gelatine all the white\r\nportions of the picture seem orange, because of the rays coming\r\nfrom them, and which contain all the colors of the spectrum; only\r\nthe orange rays may pass through. The red portions of the picture\r\nare not seen, because, although they pass through the screen, they\r\nare not seen against the red ground of the picture. It is just as\r\nthough they were not there. The left eye therefore sees a black\r\npicture on a red background.\r\n\r\nIn the same way the right eye sees through the orange screen only\r\na black picture on a red background; this black image consisting\r\nonly of the blue portions of the picture. Any other part of\r\ncomplementary colors than blue and orange, as for instance red and\r\ngreen, would serve the same purpose.\r\n\r\nThe principle on which the stereograph works may be demonstrated\r\nby a very simple experiment. On white paper one makes a picture or\r\nmark with a red pencil. Looking at this through a green glass it\r\nappears black on a green ground; looking at it through a red glass\r\nof exactly the same color as the picture, it, however, disappears\r\nfully.\r\n\r\nThrough the glass one will see only a regular surface of the color\r\nof the glass itself, and without any picture. Through a red glass\r\na green picture will appear black.\r\n\r\nSo with the stereograph; each eye sees a black picture\r\nrepresenting one of the pictures given by the stereoscope; the\r\nonly difference being that in the case of the stereograph the\r\nbackground for each eye is colored; while both eyes together see a\r\nwhite background.\r\n\r\nIn the pictures the red and the green lines and dots must not\r\ncoincide; neither can they be very far apart in order to produce\r\nthe desired result. In order that the picture shall be "plastic,"\r\nwhich increases the sense of depth and shows the effect of\r\ndistance in the picture, they must be a very trifle apart. The\r\narrangement of the two pictures can be so that one sees the\r\npictures either in front of or on the back of the card on which\r\nthey are printed. In order to make them appear before the card,\r\nthe left eye sees through a blue screen, but the red picture which\r\nis seen by it is a black one, and lies to the right on the\r\npicture; and the right eye sees the lefthand picture. The further\r\napart the pictures are, the further from the card will the\r\ncomposite image appear.\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of a stereoscope the difficulty is in the\r\nproper arrangement of the prisms; with the stereograph, in the\r\nproper choice of colors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Mercury Make-and-Break Connections for    Induction Coils [187]\r\n\r\nInduction coils operating on low voltage have a make-and-break\r\nconnection called the "buzzer" to increase the secondary\r\ndischarge. Two types of make-and-break connection are used, the\r\ncommon "buzzer" operated by the magnetism of the core in the coil\r\nand the mercury break operated by a small motor. The sketch\r\nherewith shows how to make the motor-operated break. Two blocks of\r\nwood are nailed together in the shape of an L and a small motor\r\nfastened to the top of the vertical piece. The shaft of the motor\r\nis bent about 18 in. in the shape of a crank, so that in turning\r\nit will describe a circle 1/4 in. in diameter. A small connecting\r\nbar is cut from a piece of brass 1/8 in. thick, 1/4 in. wide and 1\r\nin. long and a hole drilled in each end; one hole to fit the motor\r\nshaft and the other to slip on a No. 12 gauge wire. Two L-shaped\r\npieces of brass are fastened to the side of the block and drilled\r\nwith holes of such a size that a No. 12 gauge wire will slip\r\nthrough snugly. Place a NO.12 gauge wire in these holes and bend\r\nthe top end at right angles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Motor-Driven Make-and-Break]\r\n\r\nPut the connecting brass bar on the motor shaft with washers\r\nfitted tight on each side and slip the other end over the bent end\r\nof the wire. Have the wire plenty long so it can be cut to the\r\nproper length when the parts are all in place. A small round\r\nbottle about 1/2 in. in diameter is now fitted in a hole that has\r\nbeen previously bored into the middle of the bottom block and\r\nclose up to the vertical piece. This should only be bored about\r\nhalf way through the block. The wire is now cut so at the length\r\nof the stroke the end will come to about one-half the depth, or\r\nthe middle of the bottle.\r\n\r\nFill the bottle with mercury to a point so that when the motor is\r\nrunning, the end of the wire will be in the mercury for about\r\none-half of the stroke. Cover the mercury over with a little\r\nalcohol. A No. 14 gauge iron wire is bent and put into the side of\r\nthe bottle with the end extending to the bottom. The other end of\r\nthis wire is attached to one binding-post placed at the end of the\r\nbottom block. The other binding-post is connected to a small brass\r\nbrush attached to the side of the vertical piece, which is placed\r\nwith some pressure on the moving wire. The motor can be run with a\r\ncurrent from a separate course or connected as shown on the same\r\nbatteries with the coil. The proper height of the mercury can be\r\nregulated for best results.

The weight of\r\nthe air in round numbers is 15 lb. to the square inch and will\r\nsupport a column of water 1 in. square, 34 ft. high, or a column\r\nof mercury (density 13.6) 1 in. square, 30 in. high. The parts\r\nnecessary to make a simple barometer are, a glass tube 1/8 in.\r\ninternal diameter and about 34 in. long, a bottle 1 in. inside\r\ndiameter and 2 in. high. Seal one end of the tube by holding it in\r\nthe flame of a gas burner, which will soon soften the glass so it\r\ncan be pinched together with pliers. Put a little paraffin in the\r\nbottle and melt it by holding the bottle over a small flame. When\r\ncool the paraffin should cover the bottom about 1/16 in. thick.\r\nThe tube is now to be filled with mercury. This may be\r\naccomplished with a paper funnel, but before attempting to put in\r\nthe mercury, place a large dish or tray beneath the tube to catch\r\nany mercury that may accidentally be spilled. Only redistilled\r\nmercury should be used, and the tube should be perfectly clean\r\nbefore filling. When the tube is filled to\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Barometer]\r\n\r\nwithin 1 in. of the open end place the forefinger over the hole\r\nand tilt the tube up and down so all the air will gather at the\r\nfinger end. The filling is continued until the tube is full of\r\nmercury. The glass bottle containing the wax covered bottom is now\r\nplaced over the end of the tube and pressed firmly to insure an\r\nairtight fit with the tube. The bottle and tube are inverted and\r\nafter a few ounces of mercury are put in the bottle the tube may\r\nbe raised out of the wax, but be careful not to bring its edge\r\nabove the surface of the mercury.\r\n\r\nThe instrument is put aside while the base is being made, or, if\r\nyou choose, have the base ready to receive the parts just\r\ndescribed when they are completed. Cut a base from a piece of\r\n7/8-in. pine 3 in. wide and 40 in. long. In this base cut a groove\r\nto fit the tube and the space to be occupied by the bottle is\r\nhollowed out with a chisel to a depth of 3/4 in., so the bottle\r\nrests on one-half of its diameter above the surface of the board\r\nand one-half below. The instrument is made secure to the base with\r\nbrass strips tacked on as shown in the sketch. After the\r\ninstrument is in place put enough mercury in the bottle so the\r\ndepth of the mercury above the bottom end of the tube will be\r\nabout 1/2 in.\r\n\r\nThe scale is made on a piece or cardboard 2 in. wide and 4 in.\r\nlong. The 4 in. are marked off and divided into sixteenths, and\r\nthe inches numbered 27 up to 31. The scale is fastened to the base\r\nwith glue or tacks and in the position behind the tube as shown in\r\nthe sketch. Before fastening the scale, the instrument should be\r\ncompared with a standard barometer and the scale adjusted so both\r\nreadings are the same. But if a standard barometer is not\r\navailable, the instrument, if accurately constructed, will\r\ncalibrate itself.\r\n\r\nIn general, a drop in the mercury indicates a storm and bad\r\nweather, while a rise indicates fair weather and in winter a\r\nfrost. Sudden changes in the barometer are followed by like\r\nchanges in weather. The slow rise of the mercury predicts fair\r\nweather, and a slow fall, the contrary. During the frosty days the\r\ndrop of the mercury is followed by a thaw and a rise indicates\r\nsnow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Home-Made Post or Swinging Light [189]\r\n\r\nRemove the bottom from a round bottle of sufficient size to admit\r\na wax or tallow candle.

The cover is punched full of holes to admit\r\nthe air and a cross cut in the center with the four wings thus\r\nmade by the cutting turned up to form a place to insert the\r\ncandle. The metal cover is fastened to the bottle with wires as\r\nshown in the sketch.

The illustrations show a plan of a tent\r\n14-ft. in diameter. To make such a tent, procure unbleached tent\r\nduck, which is the very best material for the purpose, says the\r\nCleveland Plain Dealer. Make 22 sections, shaped like Fig. 3, each\r\n10 ft. 6 in. long and 2 ft. 2 in. wide at the bottom, tapering in\r\na straight line to a point at the top. These dimensions allow for\r\nthe laid or lapped seams, which should be\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An Inexpensive Home-Made Tent]\r\n\r\ndouble-stitched on a machine. The last seam sew only for a\r\ndistance of 4 ft. from the top, leaving the rest for an opening.\r\nAt the end of this seam stitch on an extra gusset piece so that it\r\nwill not rip. Fold back the edges of the opening and the bottom\r\nedge of the bell-shaped cover and bind it with wide webbing, 3 in.\r\nacross and having eyelets at the seams for attaching the stay\r\nropes. Near the apex of the cover cut three triangular holes 8 in.\r\nlong and 4 in. wide at the bottom and hem the edges. These are\r\nventilators. Make the tent wall of the same kind of cloth 2 ft. 2\r\nin. high. Bind it at the upper edge with webbing and at the bottom\r\nwith canvas. Also stitch on coarse canvas 6 in. wide at the\r\nbottom, and the space between the ground and the wall when the\r\ntent is raised, fill with canvas edging. Stitch the upper edge of\r\nthe wall firmly to the bell cover at the point indicated by the\r\ndotted line, Fig. 2.\r\n\r\nFor the top of the tent have the blacksmith make a hoop of 1/4-in.\r\nround galvanized iron, 6-in. diameter. Stitch the canvas at the\r\napex around the hoop and along the sides. Make the apex into a\r\nhood and line it with stiff canvas. Have the tent pole 3 in. in\r\ndiameter, made in two sections, with a socket joint and rounded at\r\nthe top to fit into the apex of the tent.\r\n\r\nIn raising the tent, fasten down the wall by means of loops of\r\nstout line fastened to its lower edge and small pegs driven\r\nthrough them into the ground, Fig. 5. Run the stay ropes from the\r\neyelets in the circular cover to stakes (Fig. 5) stuck in the\r\nground. Use blocks, as in Fig. 6, on the stay ropes for holding\r\nthe ends and adjusting the length of the ropes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Simple X-Ray Experiment [190]\r\n\r\nThe outlines of the bones of the hand may be seen by holding a\r\npiece of rice paper before the eyes and placing the spare hand\r\nabout 12 in. back of the rice paper and before a bright light.

As shown\r\nin the sketch, the pattern for this particular shade covers a half\r\ncircle with 2-3/4 in. added. Allowance must be made for the lap\r\nand as 1/4 in. will do, a line is drawn parallel 1/4 in. from the\r\none drawn through the center to the outside circle that terminates\r\nthe design.\r\n\r\nNail a thin sheet of brass, about 9 in. wide by 12 in. long, to a\r\nsmooth board of soft wood, then trace the design on the brass by\r\nlaying a piece of carbon paper between the pattern and the brass.\r\nAfter transferring the design to the brass, use a small awl to\r\npunch the holes in the brass along the outlines of the figures\r\ntraced. Punch holes in the brass in the spaces around the outlined\r\nfigures, excepting the 1/4-in. around the outside of the pattern.\r\nWhen all the holes are punched, remove the brass sheet from the\r\nboard and cut it along the outer lines as traced from the pattern,\r\nthen bend the brass carefully so as not to crease the figures\r\nappearing in relief. When the edges are brought together by\r\nbending, fasten them with brass-headed nails or brads.\r\n\r\nIf a wood-turning lathe is at hand, the shade can be made better\r\nby turning a cone from soft wood that will fit the sheet-brass\r\nshade after it is shaped and the edges fastened together. The\r\npattern is traced as before, but before punching the holes, cut\r\nout the brass on the outside lines, bend into shape, fasten the\r\nends together and place on the wood cone. The holes are now\r\npunched on the outlines traced from the pattern and the open\r\nspaces made full of holes. The holes being punched after the shade\r\nis shaped, the metal will stay and hold the perfect shape of a\r\ncone much better.\r\n\r\nThe glass-beaded fringe is attached on the inside of the bottom\r\npart with small brass rivets or brads placed about 3/4 in. apart.\r\nThe thin sheet brass may be procured from the local hardware\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Punching the Holes; Completed Shade; Pattern]\r\n\r\ndealer and sometimes can be purchased from general merchandise\r\nstores.\r\n--Contributed by Miss Kathryn E.

The d i a g ram drawing\r\nshows the construction. A 6-in. square cedar post is set in the\r\nground about 3 ft., allowing 2 ft. to remain above the ground and\r\na 7/8-in. piece of shafting is driven into the top part of this\r\npost for an axle. A cast-iron ring, or, better still, a heavy\r\nwheel with four spokes of such a size as to be drilled and tapped\r\nfor 1/2-in. pipe is used for the hub, or center on which the frame\r\nswings. If a wheel is selected, the rim must be removed and only\r\nthe spokes and hub used. The hole in the hub must be 7/8 in. or\r\nless, so the hub can be fitted to the shafting that is driven in\r\nthe post. A large washer is placed on top of the post and the hub\r\nor cast-iron ring set on the washer.\r\n\r\nThe drilled and tapped holes in the four spokes are each fitted\r\nwith a 4-1/2 length of 1/2-in. pipe. These pipes are\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Merry-Go-Round Complete]\r\n\r\neach fitted with a tee on the end and into this tee uprights of\r\n1/2-in. pipe in suitable lengths are screwed, and also short\r\nlengths with a tee and axle for the 6-in. wheel are fitted in the\r\nunder side of the tee. The uprights at their upper ends are also\r\nfitted with tees and each joined to the center pipe with 1/2-in.\r\npipe flattened on the inner end and fastened with bolts to a\r\nflange.\r\n\r\nThe bottom part of the cloth covering is held in place by a\r\n1/2-in. pipe, bent to the desired circle. Four braces made from\r\n1/2-in. pipe connect each spoke and seat to the flange on the\r\ncenter pipe. An extra wheel 18 in. in diameter is fitted in\r\nbetween two seats and used as the propelling wheel. This wheel has\r\nbicycle cranks and pedals and carries a seat or a hobby horse.

A ring of fiber on which two\r\nbrass rings are attached is fastened to the hub and connections\r\nare made to the two rings through two brushes fastened to the post\r\nwith a bracket. The wires run under the surface of the ground\r\noutside and connected to the source of electricity.

A small\r\nbaking-powder can is employed to vanish the coin, which should be\r\nmarked by one of the audience for identification. Cut a slot in\r\nthe bottom on the side of the can, as shown in Fig. 1. This slot\r\nshould be just large enough for the coin that is used to pass\r\nthrough freely, and to have its lower edge on a level with the\r\nbottom of the can.\r\n\r\nThe nest or series of boxes in which the coin is afterwards found\r\nshould consist of four small sized flat pasteboard boxes square or\r\nrectangular shaped and furnished with hinged covers. The smallest\r\nneed be no larger than necessary to hold the coin and each\r\nsucceeding box should be just large enough to hold the next\r\nsmaller one which in turn contains the others.\r\n\r\nA strip of tin about 1 by 1-3/4 in. is bent in the shape as shown\r\nin Fig. 2 to serve as a guide for the coin through the various\r\nboxes. This guide is inserted about 1/8 in. in the smallest box\r\nbetween the cover and the box and three rubber bands wrapped\r\naround the box as indicated. This box is then enclosed in the next\r\nlarger box, the guide being allowed to project between the box and\r\nthe cover, and the necessary tension is secured by three rubber\r\nbands around the box as before. In like manner the remaining boxes\r\nare\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Appliances for the Disappearing Coin]\r\n\r\nadjusted so that finally the prepared nest of boxes appears as in\r\nFig. 3.\r\n\r\nThe coin can easily be passed into the inner box through the tin\r\nguide, then the guide can be withdrawn which permits the\r\nrespective boxes to close and the rubber bands hold each one in a\r\nclosed position.\r\n\r\nThe performer comes forward with the tin can in his right hand,\r\nthe bottom of the can in his palm with the slot at the right side.\r\nHe removes the cover with the left hand and passes his wand around\r\nthe inner part of the can which is then turned upside down to\r\nprove that it contains nothing. The marked coin is dropped into\r\nthe can by some one in the audience. The cover is replaced and the\r\ncan shaken so the coin will rattle within. The shaking of the can\r\nis continued until the coin has slipped through the slot into his\r\npalm. The can is then placed on the table with his left hand. Then\r\napparently he looks for something to cover the can. This is found\r\nto be a handkerchief which was previously prepared on another\r\ntable concealing the nest of boxes. The coin in the right hand is\r\nquickly slipped into the guide of the nest of boxes, which was\r\nplaced in an upright position, and the guide withdrawn, and\r\ndropped on the table. The performer, while doing this, is\r\nexplaining that he is looking for a suitable cover for the can,\r\nbut as he cannot find one he takes the handkerchief instead. The\r\nhandkerchief is spread over the can and then he brings the nest of\r\nboxes. He explains how he will transfer the coin and passes his\r\nwand from the can to the boxes. The can is then shown to be empty\r\nand the boxes given to one in the audience to be opened. They will\r\nbe greatly surprised to find the marked coin within the innermost\r\nbox.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Keep Film Negatives [194]\r\n\r\nThere are many devices for taking care of film negatives to keep\r\nthem from curling and in a place easily accessible.

The lantern differs from the ordinary magic lantern\r\nin two features; first, it requires no expensive condensing lens,\r\nand second, the objects to be projected have no need of being\r\ntransparent.\r\n\r\nTwo electric globes are made to cast the strongest possible light\r\non the picture card set between them and in front of which a lens\r\nis placed to project the view on the screen, the whole being\r\nenclosed in a light-tight box. The box can be made of selected oak\r\nor mahogany. The lens to be used as a projector will determine the\r\nsize of the box to some extent. The measurements given in these\r\ninstructions are for a lens of about 5 in. focal length. The box\r\nshould be constructed of well seasoned wood and all joints made\r\nwith care so they will be light-tight.\r\n\r\nThe portion shown carrying the lens in Fig. 1 is made to slide in\r\nthe main body of the lantern for focusing. A box should first be\r\nmade 5-1/2 in. wide, 5-1/2 in. high and 11 in. long. A hole is cut\r\nin the back of the box 4 by 6 in. represented by the dotted line\r\nin Fig. 2. This will be 3/4 in. from the top and bottom and 2-1/2\r\nin. from each end of the outside of the box. Two strips of wood\r\n1/2 in. wide and 6-1/2 in. long are fastened along the top and\r\nbottom of the back. The door covering this hole in the back, and,\r\nwhich is also used as a carrier for the post cards, is made from a\r\nboard 4-1/2 in. wide and 6-1/2 in. long. The door is hinged to the\r\nlower strip and held in position by a turn button on the upper\r\nstrip. The slides for the picture cards are made from strips of\r\ntin bent as shown, and tacked to the inside surface of the door.\r\n\r\nThe runners to hold the part carrying the lens are two pieces\r\n2-1/4 in. wide by 5 in. long and should be placed\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Details of the Post Card Lantern]\r\n\r\nvertically, AA, as shown in Fig. 1, 3-1/2 in. from each end. An\r\nopen space 4 in. wide and 5 in. high in the center is for the part\r\ncarrying the lens to slide for focusing. The part carrying the\r\nlens is a shallow box 4 by 5 in. and 2 in. deep in the center of\r\nwhich a hole is cut to admit the lens. If a camera lens is used,\r\nthe flange should be fastened with screws to the front part of\r\nthis shallow box. The sides of this box should be made quite\r\nsmooth and a good, but not tight, fit into the runners. Plumbago\r\ncan be rubbed on to prevent sticking and to dull any rays of\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nTwo keyless receptacles for electric globes are fastened to the\r\nunder side of the top in the position shown and connected with\r\nwires from the outside. Two or three holes about 1 in. in diameter\r\nshould be bored in the top between and in a line with the lights.\r\nThese will provide ventilation to keep the pictures from being\r\nscorched or becoming buckled from the excessive heat. The holes\r\nmust be covered over on the top with a piece of metal or wood to\r\nprevent the light from showing on the ceiling. This piece should\r\nnot be more than 1/2 in. high and must\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Post Card Lantern Complete]\r\n\r\nbe colored dead black inside to cause no reflection.\r\n\r\nThe reflectors are made of sheet tin or nickel-plated metal bent\r\nto a curve as shown, and extending the whole height of the\r\nlantern. The length of these reflectors can be determined by the\r\nangle of the lens when covering the picture. This is clearly shown\r\nby the dotted lines in Fig. 1. The reflectors must not interfere\r\nwith the light between the picture and the lens, but they must be\r\nsufficiently large to prevent any direct light reaching the lens\r\nfrom the lamps. In operation place the post card upside down in\r\nthe slides and close the door. Sliding the shallow box carrying\r\nthe lens will focus the picture on the screen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Handy Calendar [196]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Knuckles Designate the 31 Day Months]\r\n\r\n"Thirty days hath September, April, June and November," etc., and\r\nmany other rhymes and devices are used to aid the memory to decide\r\nhow many days are in each month of the year. Herewith is\r\nillustrated a very simple method to determine the number of days\r\nin any month. Place the first finger of your right hand on the\r\nfirst knuckle of your left hand, calling that knuckle January;\r\nthen drop your finger into the depression between the first and\r\nsecond knuckles, calling this February; then the second knuckle\r\nwill be March, and so on, until you reach July on the knuckle of\r\nthe little finger, then begin over again with August on the first\r\nknuckle and continue until December is reached. Each month as it\r\nfalls upon a knuckle will have 31 days and those down between the\r\nknuckles 30 days with the exception of February which has only 28\r\ndays.\r\n--Contributed by Chas. C.

This process is rather a difficult one, as it requires an\r\nairtight case, but the description herewith given may be entered\r\ninto with as large a case as the builder cares to construct.\r\n\r\nOak articles can be treated in a case made from a tin biscuit box,\r\nor any other metal receptacle of good proportions, provided it is\r\nairtight. The oak to be fumed is arranged in the box so the fumes\r\nwill entirely surround the piece; the article may be propped up\r\nwith small sticks, or suspended by a string. The chief point is to\r\nsee that no part of the wood is covered up and that all surfaces\r\nare exposed to the fumes. A saucer of ammonia is placed in the\r\nbottom of the box, the lid or cover closed, and all joints sealed\r\nup by pasting heavy brown paper over them. Any leakage will be\r\ndetected if the nose is placed near the tin and farther\r\napplication of the paper will stop the holes. A hole may be cut in\r\nthe cover and a piece of glass fitted in, taking care to have all\r\nthe edges closed. The process may be watched through the glass and\r\nthe article removed when the oak is fumed to the desired shade.\r\nWood stained in this manner should not be French polished or\r\nvarnished, but waxed.\r\n\r\nThe process of waxing is simple: Cut some beeswax into fine shreds\r\nand place them in a small pot or jar. Pour in a little turpentine,\r\nand set aside for half a day, giving it an occasional stir. The\r\nwax must be thoroughly dissolved and then more turpentine added\r\nuntil the preparation has the consistency of a thick cream. This\r\ncan be applied to the wood with a rag and afterward brushed up\r\nwith a stiff brush.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make an Electrolytic Rectifier [197]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Electrolytic Rectifier and Connections]\r\n\r\nMany devices which will change alternating current to a direct\r\ncurrent have been put on the market, but probably there is not one\r\nof them which suits the amateur\'s needs and pocketbook better than\r\nthe electrolytic rectifier.\r\n\r\nFor the construction of such a rectifier four 2-qt. fruit jars are\r\nrequired. In each place two electrodes, one of lead and one of\r\naluminum. The immersed surface of the aluminum should be about 15\r\nsq. in. and the lead 24 sq. in. The immersed surface of the lead\r\nbeing greater than that of the aluminum, the lead will have to be\r\ncrimped as shown in Fig, 1. In both Fig. 1 and 2, the lead is\r\nindicated by L and the aluminum by A.\r\n\r\nThe solution with which each jar is to be filled consists of the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n    Water             2 qt.\r\n    Sodium Carbonate  2 tablespoonfuls\r\n    Alum              3 tablespoonfuls\r\n\r\nCare should be taken to leave the connections made as shown in\r\nFig. 2. The alternating current comes in on the wires as shown,\r\nand the direct current is taken from the point indicated.\r\n\r\nThe capacity of this rectifier is from 3 to 5 amperes, which is\r\nsufficient for charging small storage batteries, running small\r\nmotors and lighting small lamps.\r\n--Contributed by J.

Ask someone to cross their first and second fingers and\r\nplace them on the marble as shown in the illustration. Then have\r\nthe person roll the marble about and at the same time close the\r\neyes or look in another direction. The person will imagine that\r\nthere are two marbles instead of one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rooling Marble]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Gas Cannon [197]\r\n\r\nIf you have a small cannon with a bore of 1 or 1-1/2 in., bore out\r\nthe fuse hole large enough to tap and fit in a small sized spark\r\nplug such as used on a gasoline engine. Fill the cannon with gas\r\nfrom a gas jet and then push a\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gas Cannon Loaded]\r\n\r\ncork in the bore close up to the spark plug. Connect one of the\r\nwires from a battery to a spark coil and then to the spark plug.\r\nAttach the other wire to the cannon near the spark plug. Turn the\r\nswitch to make a spark and a loud report will follow.\r\n--Contributed by Cyril Tegner, Cleveland, O.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Old-Time Magic-Part VI [198]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Handkerchief Mended after Being Cut and Torn\r\n\r\nTwo persons are requested to come forward from the audience to\r\nhold the four corners of a handkerchief. Then beg several other\r\nhandkerchiefs from the audience and place them on the one held by\r\nthe two persons. When several handkerchiefs have been accumulated,\r\nhave some one person draw out one from the bunch and examine for\r\nany marks that will determine that this handkerchief is the one to\r\nbe mended after being mutilated. He, as well as others, are to cut\r\noff pieces from this handkerchief and to finally tear it to\r\npieces.\r\n\r\nThe pieces are then all collected and some magic spirits thrown\r\nover the torn and cut parts; tie them in a small package with a\r\nribbon and put them under a glass, which you warm with your hands.\r\nAfter a few seconds\' time, you remove the glass, as you have held\r\nit all the time, and take the handkerchief and unfold it; everyone\r\nwill recognize the mark and be amazed not to find a cut or tear in\r\nthe texture.\r\n\r\nThis trick is very simple. You have an understanding with some one\r\nin the company, who has two handkerchiefs exactly alike and has\r\ngiven one of them to a person behind the curtain; he throws the\r\nother, at the time of request for handkerchiefs, on the\r\nhandkerchiefs held for use in the performance of the trick. You\r\nmanage to keep this handkerchief where it will be picked out in\r\npreference to the others, although pretending to thoroughly mix\r\nthem up. The person selected to pick out a handkerchief naturally\r\nwill take the handiest one. Be sure that this is the right one.\r\n\r\nWhen the handkerchief has been torn and folded, put it under the\r\nglass, on a table, near a partition or curtain. The table should\r\nbe made with a hole cut through the top and a small trap door\r\nfitted snugly in the hole, so it will appear to be a part of the\r\ntable top. This trap door is hinged on the under side and opens\r\ninto the drawer of the table and can be operated by the person\r\nbehind the curtain who will remove the torn handkerchief and\r\nreplace it with the good one and then close the trap door by\r\nreaching through the drawer of the table.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** The Magic Knot [198]\r\n\r\nThis is a very amusing trick which consists of tying one knot with\r\ntwo ends of a handkerchief, and pulling the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tying and Untying a Knot]\r\n\r\nends only to untie them again. Take the two diagonal corners of a\r\nhandkerchief, one in each hand and throw the main part of the\r\nhandkerchief over the wrist of the left hand and tie the knot as\r\nshown in the illustration. Pull the ends quickly, allowing the\r\nloop over the left hand to slip freely, and you will have the\r\nhandkerchief without any knot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Good Mouse Trap [198]\r\n\r\nWhen opening a tomato or other small can, cut the cover crossways\r\nfrom side to side making four triangular pieces in the top. Bend\r\nthe four ends outward and remove the contents, wash clean and dry\r\nand then bend the four ends inward, leaving a hole about 3/4 in.\r\nin diameter in the center. Drop in a piece of bread and lay the\r\ncan down upon its side and the trap is ready for use. The mouse\r\ncan get in but he cannot get out.\r\n--Contributed by E. J.

Therefore such a craft cannot be used in all\r\nwaters, but by being careful at shores, it can be used as safely\r\nas an ordinary sailing canoe. Be sure to select the best materials\r\nand when complete cover the seams well with paint.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Completed Sailing Canoe]\r\n\r\nThe materials necessary for the construction of a sailing canoe,\r\nas illustrated in the engraving, are as follows:\r\n\r\n    1 keelson, 1 in. by 8 in. by 15 ft., selected pine.\r\n    14 rib bands, 1 in. square by 16 ft., clear pine.\r\n    2 gunwales, 1 in. by 2 in. by 16 ft.\r\n    1 piece for forms and bow pieces, 1 in. by 12 in. by 10 ft.\r\n    4 outwales, 1/4 in. by 2 in. by 16 ft.\r\n    1 piece, 3 in. wide and 12 ft. long, for cockpit frame.\r\n    1 piece, 2 in. wide and 12 ft. long, for center deck braces.\r\n    11 yd. of 1-1/2-yd. wide 12-oz. ducking.\r\n    8 yd. of 1-yd. wide unbleached muslin.\r\n    50 ft. of rope.\r\n    1 mast, 9 ft. long.\r\n    Paint, screws and cleats.\r\n\r\nThe keelson, Fig. 1, is 14 ft. long, 8 in. wide in the center and\r\ntapered down from a point 4 ft. from each end to 1 in. at the\r\nends. Both ends are mortised, one 6 in. for the stern piece, and\r\nthe other 12 in. for the bow. Be sure to get the bow and stern\r\npieces directly in the middle of the keelson and at right angles\r\nwith the top edge. The stern and bow pieces are cut as shown in\r\nFig. 2 and braced with an iron band, 1/8 in. thick and 3/4 in.\r\nwide, drilled and fastened with screws.\r\n\r\nStudy the sketches showing the details well before starting to cut\r\nout the pieces. Then there will be no trouble experienced later in\r\nputting the parts together. See that all the pieces fit their\r\nplaces as the work proceeds and apply the canvas with care.\r\n\r\nTwo forms are made as shown in Figs. 3 and 4; the smaller is\r\nplaced 3 ft. from the bow and the large one, 7 ft. 3 in. from the\r\nstern. The larger mould is used temporarily while making the boat,\r\nand is removed after the ribs are in place. The gunwales are now\r\nplaced over the forms and in the notches shown, and fastened with\r\nscrews, and, after cutting the ends to fit the bow and stern\r\npieces, they are fastened with bolts put through the three pieces.\r\nThe sharp edges on one side of each rib-band are removed and seven\r\nof them fastened with screws to each side of the moulds, spacing\r\nthem on the large mould 4 in. apart. The ribs are made of 28 good\r\nbarrel hoops\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Details of a Home-Made Sailing Canoe]\r\n\r\nwhich should be well soaked in water for several hours before\r\nbending them in shape. These are put in 6 in. apart and are\r\nfastened to the rib-bands with 7/8-in. wood screws. The ribs\r\nshould be put in straight and true to keep them from pulling the\r\nrib-bands out of shape. After the ribs are in place and fastened\r\nto the rib-bands, gunwales and keelson, put on the outwale strips\r\nand fasten them to the gunwales between every rib with 1-1/2-in.\r\nscrews.\r\n\r\nBefore making the deck, a block for the mast to rest in must be\r\nmade and fastened to the keelson. This block, Fig. 5, is a cube\r\nhaving sides 6 in. square and is kept from splitting by an iron\r\nband tightly fitted around the outside. The block is fastened to\r\nthe keelson, 3-1/2 ft. from the bow, with bolts through\r\ncountersunk holes from the under side.\r\n\r\nThere are three deck braces made as shown in Figs. 6, 7 and 8.\r\nBraces, Figs. 6 and 7, form the ends of the cockpit which is 20\r\nin. wide. A 6-in. board is fitted into the mortises shown in these\r\npieces; a center piece is fitted in the other mortises. The other\r\ndeck braces slope down from the center piece and are placed 6 in.\r\napart. They are 1 in. square and are mortised into the center\r\npiece and fastened to the gunwales with screws. The main deck\r\nbraces are fastened to the gunwales with 4-in. corner braces and\r\nto the center piece with 2-in. corner braces. The mast hole on the\r\ndeck is made as follows: Secure a piece of pine 1 in. thick, 6 in.\r\nwide and 3 ft. long. Cut this in halves and mortise for the center\r\npiece in the two halves and fasten to the gunwales. A block of\r\npine, 4 in. thick and 12 in. long, is cut to fit under the top\r\nboards, Fig. 9, and fastened to them with bolts. With an expansive\r\nbit bore a hole 3 in. in diameter through the block. Be sure to\r\nget the block and hole directly over the block that is fastened to\r\nthe keelson. Put on a coat of boiled linseed oil all over the\r\nframe before proceeding farther.\r\n\r\nPutting on the canvas may be a difficult piece of work to do, yet\r\nif the following simple directions are followed out no trouble\r\nwill be encountered. The 11-yd. length of canvas is cut in the\r\ncenter, doubled, and a seam made joining the two pieces together.\r\nFill the seam with thick paint and tack it down with copper tacks\r\nalong the center of the keelson. When this is well tacked commence\r\nstretching and pulling the canvas in the middle of the gunwales so\r\nas to make it as even and tight as possible and work toward each\r\nend, tacking the canvas as it is stretched to the outside of the\r\ngunwale. Seam the canvas along the stern and bow pieces as was\r\ndone on the keelson. The deck is not so hard to do, but be careful\r\nto get the canvas tight and even. A seam should be made along the\r\ncenter piece. The trimming is wood, 1/4 in. thick and 1/2 in.\r\nwide. A strip of this is nailed along the center piece over the\r\ncanvas. The outwales are nailed on over the canvas. A piece of\r\noak, 1 in. thick 1-1/2 in. wide and 14 in. long, is fastened with\r\nscrews over the canvas on the stern piece; also, a piece 1/4 in.\r\nthick, 1 in. wide and 24 in. long is well soaked in water, bent to\r\nthe right shape and fastened over the canvas on the bow.\r\n\r\nThe rudder is made as shown in Fig. 10 with a movable handle. A\r\nstrip 1 in. thick by 2 in. wide, is bolted to the keelson over the\r\ncanvas for the outer keel. The keel, Fig. 11, is 6 in. wide at one\r\nend and 12 in. at the other, which is fastened to the outer keel\r\nwith bolts having thumb nuts. The mast can be made of a young\r\nspruce tree having a diameter of 3 in. at the base with sufficient\r\nheight to make it 9 ft. long. The canoe is driven by a lanteen\r\nsail and two curtain poles, each 1 in. in diameter and 10 ft.\r\nlong, are used for the boom and gaff, which are held together with\r\ntwo pieces of iron bent as shown in Fig. 12. The sail is a\r\ntriangle, 9-3/4 by 9-3/4 by 8-1/2 ft. which is held to the boom\r\nand gaff by cord lacings run through eyelets inserted in the\r\nmuslin. The eyelets are of brass placed 4 in. apart in the muslin.\r\nThe mast has two side and one front stay, each fitted with a\r\nturnbuckle for tightening. A pulley is placed at the top and\r\nbottom of the mast for the lift rope. The sail is held to the mast\r\nby an iron ring and the lift rope at the top of the mast. The boom\r\nrope is held in the hand and several cleats should be placed in\r\nthe cockpit for convenience. A chock is placed at the bow for\r\ntying up to piers. Several coats of good paint complete the boat.\r\n--Contributed by O. E.

With this device any small object may be firmly held by\r\nsimply placing it between the sides of the hinge and tightening\r\nthe nut.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Proper Design for a Bird House [201]\r\n\r\nThis bird house was designed and built to make a home for the\r\nAmerican martin. The house will accommodate 20 families. All the\r\nholes are arranged so they will not be open to the cold winds from\r\nthe north which often kill the birds which come in the early\r\nspring. Around each opening is an extra ring of wood to make a\r\nlonger passage which assists the martin inside in fighting off the\r\nEnglish\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bird House]\r\n\r\nsparrow who tries to drive him out. The holes are made oval to\r\nallow all the little ones to get their heads out for fresh air.\r\nThe long overhanging eaves protect the little birds from the hot\r\nsummer sun. The rooms are made up with partitions on the inside so\r\neach opening will have a room. The inside of the rooms should be\r\nstained black.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Boomerangs and How to Make Them [202]\r\n\r\nA boomerang is a weapon invented and used by the native\r\nAustralians, who seemed to have the least intelligence of any race\r\nof mankind. The\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Details of Three Boomerangs]\r\n\r\nboomerang is a curved stick of hardwood, Fig. 1, about 5/16 in.\r\nthick, 2-1/2 in. wide and 2 ft. long, flat on one side, with the\r\nends and the other side rounding. One end of the stick is grasped\r\nin one hand with the convex edge forward and the flat side up and\r\nthrown upward. After going some distance and ascending slowly to a\r\ngreat height in the air with a quick rotary motion, it suddenly\r\nreturns in an elliptical orbit to a spot near the starting point.\r\nIf thrown down on the ground the boomerang rebounds in a straight\r\nline, pursuing a ricochet motion until the object is struck at\r\nwhich it was thrown.\r\n\r\nTwo other types of boomerangs are illustrated herewith and they\r\ncan be made as described. The materials necessary for the T-shaped\r\nboomerang are: One piece of hard maple 5/16 in. thick, 2-1/2 in.\r\nwide, and 3 ft. long; five 1/2-in. flat-headed screws. Cut the\r\npiece of hard maple into two pieces, one 11-1/2 in. and the other\r\n18 in. long. The corners are cut from these pieces as shown in\r\nFig. 2, taking care to cut exactly the same amount from each\r\ncorner. Bevel both sides of the pieces, making the edges very thin\r\nso they will cut the air better. Find the exact center of the long\r\npiece and make a line 1-1/4 in. on each side of the center and\r\nfasten the short length between the lines with the screws as shown\r\nin Fig. 3. The short piece should be fastened perfectly square and\r\nat right angles to the long one.\r\n\r\nThe materials necessary for the cross-shaped boomerang are one\r\npiece hard maple 5/16 in. thick, 2 in. wide and 30 in. long and\r\nfive 1/2-in. flat headed screws. Cut the maple- into two 14-in.\r\npieces and plane the edges of these pieces so the ends will be\r\n1-1/2 in. wide, as shown in Fig. 4. Bevel these pieces the same as\r\nthe ones for the T-shaped boomerang. The two pieces are fastened\r\ntogether as shown in Fig. 5. All of the boomerangs when completed\r\nshould be given several coats of linseed oil and thoroughly dried.\r\nThis will keep the wood from absorbing water and becoming heavy.\r\nThe last two boomerangs are thrown in a similar way to the first\r\none, except that one of the pieces is grasped in the hand and the\r\nthrow given with a quick underhand motion. A little practice is\r\nall that is necessary for one to become skillful in throwing them.\r\n--Contributed by O. E.

Take this and\r\nfold it over once, forming a double piece 1-1/2 ft. wide and 3 ft.\r\nlong. Make a double stitch all around the edge, leaving a small\r\nopening at one corner. Insert a piece of tape at this corner to be\r\nused for tying around the opening when the bag is blown up. The\r\nbag is then turned inside out, soaked with water and blown up. An\r\noccasional wetting all over will prevent it from leaking. As these\r\nwings are very large they will prevent the swimmer from sinking.\r\n--Contributed by W. C. Bliss, St. Louis, Mo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make an Ammeter [203]\r\n\r\nThe outside case of this instrument is made of wood taken from old\r\ncigar boxes with the exception of the back. If carefully and\r\nneatly made, the finished instrument will be very satisfactory.\r\nThe measurements here given need not be strictly followed out, but\r\ncan be governed by circumstances. The case should first be made\r\nand varnished and while this is drying, the mechanical parts can\r\nbe put together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Details of an Ammeter]\r\n\r\nThe back is a board 3/8 in. thick, 6-1/2 in. wide and 6-3/4 in.\r\nlong. The outer edges of this board are chamfered. The other parts\r\nof the case are made from the cigar box wood which should be well\r\nsandpapered to remove the labels. The sides are 3-1/4 in. wide and\r\n5 in. long; the top and bottom, 3-1/4 in. wide and 4-1/2 in. long.\r\nGlue a three cornered piece, A, Fig. 1, at each end on the surface\r\nthat is to be the inside of the top and bottom pieces. After the\r\nglue, is set, fasten the sides to the pieces with glue, and take\r\ncare that the pieces are all square. When the glue is set, this\r\nsquare box is well sandpapered, then centered, and fastened to the\r\nback with small screws turned into each three-cornered piece.\r\n\r\nThe front, which is a piece 5-1/4 in. wide and 6-1/2 in. long, has\r\na circular opening cut near the top through which the graduated\r\nscale may be seen. This front is centered and fastened the same as\r\nthe back, and the four outside edges, as well as the edges around\r\nthe opening, are rounded. The whole case can now be cleaned and\r\nstained with a light mahogany stain and varnished. Cut another\r\npiece of board, B, Figs. 2 and 3, to just fit inside the case and\r\nrest on the ends of the three-cornered pieces, A, and glue to this\r\nboard two smaller pieces, C, 3 in. square, with the grain of the\r\nwood in alternate directions to prevent warping. All of these\r\npieces are made of the cigar box wood. Another piece, D, 3/8 in.\r\nthick and 3 in. square, is placed on the other pieces and a\r\nU-shaped opening 1-3/4 in. wide and 2-1/2 in. high sawed out from\r\nall of the pieces as shown. The piece D is attached to the pieces\r\nC with four 1/2-in. pieces 2-5/8 in. long.\r\n\r\nA magnet is made from a soft piece of iron, E, about 3/8 in.\r\nthick, 1-1/4 in. wide and 2-3/4 in. long. Solder across each end\r\nof the iron a piece of brass wire, F, and make a turn in each end\r\nof the wires, forming an eye for a screw. These wires are about\r\n2-1/2 in. long. Wind three layers of about No. 14 double\r\ncotton-covered copper wire on the soft iron and leave about 5 or 6\r\nin. of each end unwound for connections.\r\n\r\nThe pointer is made as shown in Fig. 5 from 1/16-in. brass wire\r\nfiled to make a point at both ends for a spindle. About 1/2 in.\r\nfrom each end of this wire are soldered two smaller brass wires\r\nwhich in turn are soldered to a strip of light tin 1/4 in. wide\r\nand 2-5/8 in. long. The lower edge of this tin should be about 1/2\r\nin. from the spindle. The pointer is soldered to the spindle 1/4\r\nin. from one end. All of these parts should be brass with the\r\nexception of the strip of tin. Another strip of tin, the same size\r\nas the first, is soldered to two brass wires as shown in Fig. 4.\r\nThese wires should be about 1 in. long.\r\n\r\nThe spindle of the pointer swings freely between two bars of\r\nbrass, G, 1/16 in. thick, 1/4 in. wide and 2-1/2 in. long. A small\r\nhole is countersunk in one of the bars to receive one end of the\r\nspindle and a hole 1/8 in. in diameter is drilled in the other and\r\na thumb nut taken from the binding-post of an old battery soldered\r\nover the hole so the screw will pass through when turned into the\r\nnut. The end of the screw is countersunk to receive the other end\r\nof the spindle. A lock nut is necessary to fasten the screw when\r\nproper adjustment is secured. A hole is drilled in both ends of\r\nthe bars for screws to fasten them in place. The bar with the\r\nadjusting screw is fastened on the back so it can be readily\r\nadjusted through the hole H, bored in the back. The pointer is\r\nbent so it will pass through the U-shaped cut-out and up back of\r\nthe board B. A brass pin is driven in the board B to hold the\r\npointer from dropping down too far to the left. Place the tin,\r\nFig. 4, so it will just clear the tin, Fig. 5, and fasten in\r\nplace. The magnet is next placed with the ends of the coil to the\r\nback and the top just clearing the tin strips. Two binding screws\r\nare fitted to the bottom of the back and connected to the\r\nextending wires from the coil.\r\n\r\nThe instrument is now ready for calibrating. This is done by\r\nconnecting it in series with another standard ammeter which has\r\nthe scale marked in known quantities. In this series is also\r\nconnected a variable resistance and a battery or some other source\r\nof current supply. The resistance is now adjusted to show .5\r\nampere on the standard ammeter and the position of the pointer\r\nmarked on the scale. Change your resistance to all points and make\r\nthe numbers until the entire scale is complete.\r\n\r\nWhen the current flows through the coil, the two tinned strips of\r\nmetal are magnetized, and being magnetized by the same lines of\r\nforce they are both of the same polarity. Like poles repel each\r\nother, and as the part Fig. 4 is not movable, the part carrying\r\nthe pointer moves away.

England\r\n\r\nThis star finder can easily be made by anyone who can use a few\r\ntools as the parts are all wood and the only lathe work necessary\r\nis the turned shoulder on the polar axis and this could be dressed\r\nand sandpapered true enough for the purpose. The base is a board 5\r\nin. wide and 9 in. long which is fitted with an ordinary wood\r\nscrew in each corner for leveling. Two side pieces cut with an\r\nangle equal to the colatitude of the place are nailed to the base\r\nand on top of them is fastened another board on which is marked\r\nthe hour circle as shown. The end of the polar axis B, that has\r\nthe end turned with a shoulder, is fitted in a hole bored in the\r\ncenter of the hour circle. The polar axis B is secured to the\r\nboard with a wooden collar and a pin underneath. The upper end of\r\nthe polar axis is fitted with a 1/4-in. board, C, 5-1/2 in. in\r\ndiameter. A thin compass card divided into degrees is fitted on\r\nthe edge of this disk for the declination circle.\r\n\r\nThe hour circle A is half of a similar card with the hour marks\r\ndivided into 20 minutes. An index pointer is fastened to the base\r\nof the polar axis. A pointer 12 in. long is fastened with a small\r\nbolt to the center of the declination circle. A small opening is\r\nmade in the pointer into which an ordinary needle is inserted.\r\nThis needle is adjusted to the degree to set the pointer in\r\ndeclination and when set, the pointer is clamped with the bolt at\r\nthe center. A brass tube having a 1/4-in. hole is fastened to the\r\npointer.\r\n\r\nThe first thing to do is to get a true N and S meridian mark. This\r\ncan be approximately obtained by a good compass, and allowance\r\nmade for the magnetic declination at your own place. Secure a slab\r\nof stone or some other solid flat surface, level this and have it\r\nfirmly fixed facing due south with a line drawn through the center\r\nand put the equatorial on the surface with XII on the south end of\r\nthe line. Then set the pointer D to the declination of the object,\r\nsay Venus at the date of observation. You now want to know if this\r\nplanet is east or west of your meridian at the time of\r\nobservation. The following formula will show how this may be\r\nfound. To find a celestial object by equatorial: Find the planet\r\nVenus May 21, 1881, at 9 hr. 10 min. A. M. Subtract right\r\nascension of planet from the time shown by the clock, thus:\r\n\r\n\r\n                                     hour   minute  second\r\n  9 hr. 10 min. shows mean siderial.   1      0       0\r\n  Add 12 hrs                          12\r\n                                      ---    ---     ---\r\n                                      13\r\n\r\n\r\n  Right ascension of Venus             2      10\r\n                                      ---    ---     ---\r\n  Set hour circle to before meridian  10      50      0\r\n  Again------------------\r\n  At 1 hr. 30 min. mean clock shows    5      20      0\r\n  Right ascension of Venus             2      10      0\r\n                                      ---     ---    ---\r\n  Set hour circle to                   3      10      0\r\n\r\nBooks may be found in libraries that will give the right ascension\r\nand declination of most of the heavenly bodies.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing tables assume that you have a clock rated to\r\nsiderial time,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Home-Made Equatorial]\r\n\r\nbut this is not absolutely necessary. If you can obtain the\r\nplanet\'s declination on the day of observation and ascertain when\r\nit is due south, all you have to do is to set the pointer D by the\r\nneedle point and note whether Venus has passed your meridian or\r\nnot and set your hour index. There will be no difficulty in\r\npicking up Venus even in bright sunlight when the plant is visible\r\nto the naked eye.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Electric Light Turned On and Off from Different Places [205]\r\n\r\nHow nice it would be to have an electric light at the turn in a\r\nstairway, or at the top that could be turned on before starting up\r\nthe stair and on reaching the top turned out, and vice\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Wiring Diagram]\r\n\r\nversa when coming down. The wiring diagram as shown in the\r\nillustration will make this a pleasant reality. This wiring may be\r\napplied in numerous like instances.

The light may be turned on or off at either one of the\r\nswitches.\r\n--Contributed by Robert W. Hall, New Haven, Conn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Bunsen Cell [206]\r\n\r\nThis kind of a cell produces a high e.m.f. owing to the low\r\ninternal resistance. Procure a glass jar such as used for a\r\ngravity battery, or, if one of these cannot be had, get a glazed\r\nvessel of similar construction. Take a piece of sheet zinc large\r\nenough so that when it is rolled up in the shape of a cylinder it\r\nwill clear the edge of the jar by about 1/2 in. Solder a wire or\r\nbinding-post to the edge of the cylinder for a connection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cross Section and Completed Cell]\r\n\r\nSecure a small unglazed vessel to fit inside of the zinc, or such\r\na receptacle as used in a sal ammoniac cell, and fill it with a\r\nstrong solution of nitric acid. Fill the outer jar with a solution\r\nof 16 parts water and 5 parts sulphuric acid. The connections are\r\nmade from the zinc and carbon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Optical Illusion [206]\r\n\r\nCan you tell which of these three figures is the tallest? Make a\r\nguess, and then verify its correctness by measurement.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Who is tallest?]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** One Way to Cook Fish [206]\r\n\r\nOne of the best and easiest ways of cooking fish while out camping\r\nis told by a correspondent of Forest and Stream. A fire is built\r\nthe size for the amount of food to be cooked and the wood allowed\r\nto burn down to a glowing mass of coals and ashes. Wash and season\r\nyour fish well and then wrap them up in clean, fresh grass, leaves\r\nor bark. Then, after scraping away the greater part of the coals,\r\nput the fish among the ashes, cover up with the same, and heap the\r\nglowing coals on top. The fish cooks quickly--15 or 20\r\nminutes--according to their size.\r\n\r\nIf you eat fish or game cooked after this fashion you will agree\r\nthat it cannot be beaten by any method known to camp culinary\r\nsavants. Clay also answers the purpose of protecting. the fish or\r\ngame from the fire if no other material is at hand, and for\r\nanything that requires more time for cooking it makes the best\r\ncovering. Wet paper will answer, especially for cooking fish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Hardening Copper [206]\r\n\r\nA successful method of hardening copper is to add 1 lb. of alum\r\nand 4 oz. arsenic to every 20 lb. of melted copper and stir for 10\r\nminutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Packing Cut from Felt Hats [206]\r\n\r\nFelt from an old hat makes good packing for automobile\r\nwater-circulating pumps. Strips should be cut to fit snugly in the\r\nstuffing box. When the follower is screwed down, it will expand\r\nthe felt and make a watertight joint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Homemade Gasoline Engine [206]\r\n\r\nThe material used in the construction of the gasoline engine, as\r\nshown in the accompanying picture, was pieces found in a scrap\r\npile that usually occupies a fence corner on almost every farm.\r\nThe cylinder consists of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Complete Homemade Gasoline Engine]\r\n\r\nan old pump cylinder, 3/8 in. thick, 1-3/4 in. inside diameter and\r\nabout 5 in. long. This was fastened between some wooden blocks\r\nwhich were bolted on the tool carriage of a lathe and then bored\r\nout to a diameter of about 2 in. The boring bar, Fig. 1, consisted\r\nof an old shaft with a hole bored through the center and a tool\r\ninserted and held for each cut by a setscrew. A wood mandrel with\r\na metal shaft to turn in the centers of a lathe was made to fit\r\nthe bored-out cylinder. The cylinder was then placed on the\r\nmandrel, fastened with a pin, and threaded on both ends. Flanges\r\nwere next made from couplings discarded from an old horsepower\r\ntumbling rod, to fit on the threaded ends of the cylinder casting.\r\nWhen these flanges were tightly screwed on the casting and faced\r\noff smooth the whole presented the appearance of a large spool.\r\n\r\nThe back cylinder head was made from a piece of cast iron, about\r\n1/2 in. thick, turned to the same diameter as the flanges, and\r\nwith a small projection to fit snugly inside the cylinder bore.\r\nTwo holes were then drilled in this head and tapped for 3/4-in.\r\npipe. Two pieces of 3/4 -in. pipe were fitted to these holes so\r\nthat, when they were turned in, a small part of the end of each\r\npipe projected on the inside of the cylinder head. These pieces of\r\npipe serve as valve cages and are reamed out on the inside ends to\r\nform a valve seat. The outlet for the exhaust and the inlet for\r\nthe gas and air are through holes drilled in the side of each pipe\r\nrespectively and tapped for 1/2-in. pipe. Two heads were then made\r\nto fit over the outer ends of the valve cages. These heads looked\r\nsimilar to a thread spool with one flange cut off, the remaining\r\nflange fitting on the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Steps in Making the Home-Made Gasoline Engine]\r\n\r\nend of the valve cage and the center extending down inside to make\r\na long guide for the valve stems. These heads are held in place by\r\na wrought-iron plate and two bolts, one of which is plainly shown\r\nin the picture. This plate also supports the rocker arms, Fig. 2,\r\nand the guides for the rods that operate the valves. Both valves\r\nare mechanically operated by one cam attached to a shaft running\r\none turn to two of the crankshaft. The gears to run this shaft\r\nwere cut from solid pieces on a small home-made gear-cutting\r\nattachment for the lathe as shown in Fig. 3. The gear on the\r\ncrankshaft has 20 teeth meshing into a 40-tooth gear on the cam\r\nshaft.\r\n\r\nThe main part of the frame consists of a piece of 1/2-in. square\r\niron, 30 in. long, bent in the shape of a U, and on the outside of\r\nthis piece is riveted a bent piece of sheet metal 1/8 in. thick\r\nand 3 in. wide. The U-shaped iron is placed near one edge of the\r\nsheet metal. Two pieces of 2-1/2-in. angle iron are riveted\r\nvertically on the ends of the U-shaped iron and a plate riveted on\r\nthem to close the open end and to form a face on which to attach\r\nthe cylinder with bolts or cap screws. A hole was cut through the\r\nangle irons and plate the same size as the bore of the cylinder so\r\nthe piston could be taken out without removing the cylinder. A\r\n1-in. angle iron was riveted to one side of the finished frame to\r\nmake a support for the crankshaft bearing. The rough frame, Fig.\r\n4, was then finished on an emery wheel. This long frame had to be\r\nmade to accommodate the crosshead which was necessary for such a\r\nshort cylinder.\r\n\r\nThe piston and rod were screwed together and turned in one\r\noperation on a lathe. The three rings were made from an old\r\ncast-iron pulley. The cap screws were made from steel pump rods. A\r\npiece of this rod was centered in a lathe and turned so as to\r\nshape six or more screws, Fig. 5, then removed and the first one\r\nthreaded and cut off, then the second and so on until all of them\r\nwere made into screws. The rod was held in a vise for this last\r\noperation. Studs were made by threading both ends of a proper\r\nlength rod. Make-and-break ignition is used on the engine;\r\nhowever, a jump spark would be much better. The flywheel and\r\nmixing valve were purchased from a house dealing in these parts.\r\nThe water jacket on the cylinder is a sheet of copper formed and\r\nsoldered in place, and brass bands put on to co v e r the soldered\r\njoints.\r\n--Contributed by Peter Johnson, Clermont, Iowa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Dripping Carburetor [208]\r\n\r\nIf gasoline drips from the carburetor when the engine is not\r\nrunning, the needle valve connected with the float should be\r\ninvestigated. If the dripping stops when the valve is pressed\r\ndown, the float is too high. If the valve keeps dripping, then it\r\nshould be ground to a fit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Merry-Go-Round Thriller [209]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Swinging on the Merry-Go-Round]\r\n\r\nAs a home mechanic with a fondness for amusing the children I have\r\nseen many descriptions of merry-go-rounds, but never one which\r\nrequired so little material, labor and time, and which gave such\r\nsatisfactory results, as the one illustrated herewith. It was\r\nerected in our back yard one afternoon, the materials being\r\nfurnished by an accommodating lumber pile, and a little junk, and\r\nit has provided unlimited pleasure for "joy-riders," little and\r\nbig, from all over the neighborhood. It looks like a toy, but once\r\nseat yourself in it and begin to go around, and, no matter what\r\nyour age or size may be, you will have in a minute enough thrill\r\nand excitement to last the balance of the day.\r\n\r\nThe illustration largely explains itself, but a few dimensions\r\nwill be a help to anyone wishing to construct the apparatus. The\r\nupright is a 4 by 4-in. timber, set 3 ft. in the ground with 8 ft.\r\nextending above. It is braced on four sides with pieces 2 in.\r\nsquare and 2 ft. long, butting against short stakes. The upper end\r\nof the post is wound with a few rounds of wire or an iron strap to\r\nprevent splitting. The crosspiece is 2 in. square, 12 ft. long,\r\nstrengthened by a piece 4 in. square and 5 ft. long. These two\r\npieces must be securely bolted or spiked together. A malleable\r\niron bolt, 3/4 in. in diameter and 15 in. long is the pivot. On\r\nthis depends the safety of the contrivance, so it must be strong\r\nenough, and long enough to keep firmly in the post. Drive this\r\nbolt in a 3/8-in. hole bored in the post, which will make it a\r\nsufficiently tight fit. Make the hole for the bolt very loose\r\nthrough the crosspiece, so that there will be plenty of "wobble,"\r\nas this is one of the mirth-making features of the machine. Use a\r\nheavy washer at the head. The seats are regular swing boards,\r\nsupported by a stout and serviceable rope. A 3/4 -in. rope is not\r\ntoo heavy. One set of ropes are passed through holes at the end of\r\nthe crosspiece and knotted on top. The other set should be\r\nprovided with loops at the top and slid over the crosspiece, being\r\nheld in position by spikes as shown. This makes an easy\r\nadjustment. Seat the heavier of the riders on the latter seat,\r\nmoving it toward the center until a balance with the lighter rider\r\nis reached. A rope tied to the crosspiece about 2 ft. from the\r\ncenter, for the "motive power" to grasp, completes the\r\nmerry-go-round.\r\n\r\nPut plenty of soap or grease between the crosspiece and upright.\r\nBe sure to have room for the ropes to swing out at high speed,\r\nwith no trees or buildings in the way. The "wobble" mentioned will\r\ngive an agreeable undulating motion, which adds greatly to the\r\nflying sensation. This will be found surprisingly evident for so\r\nsmall a machine. As there is no bracing, care must be taken to\r\nhave the two riders sit at the same moment, or the iron bolt will\r\nbe bent out of line. If it is to be used for adults, strong clear\r\nmaterial only should be employed.\r\n--Contributed by C. W. Nieman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make and Fly a Chinese Kite [210]\r\n\r\nThe Chinese boy is not satisfied with simply holding the end of a\r\nkite string and running up and down the block or field trying to\r\nraise a heavy paper kite with a half pound of rags for a tail. He\r\nmakes a kite as light as possible without any tail which has the\r\npeculiar property of being able to move in every direction.\r\nSometimes an expert can make one of these kites travel across the\r\nwind for several hundred feet; in fact, I have seen boys a full\r\nblock apart bring their kites together and engage\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Parts of a Chinese Kite]\r\n\r\nin a combat until one of their kites floated away with a broken\r\nstring, or was punctured by the swift dives of the other, and sent\r\nto earth, a wreck.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese boy makes his kite as follows:\r\n\r\nFrom a sheet of thin but tough tissue paper about 20 in. square,\r\nwhich he folds and cuts along the dotted line, as shown in Fig. 1,\r\nhe gets a perfectly square kite having all the properties of a\r\ngood flyer, light and strong. He shapes two pieces of bamboo, one\r\nfor the backbone and one for the bow. The backbone is flat, 1/4 by\r\n3/32 in. and 18 in. long. This he smears along one side with\r\ncommon boiled rice. Boiled rice is one of the best adhesives for\r\nuse on paper that can be obtained and the Chinese have used it for\r\ncenturies while we are just waking up to the fact that it makes\r\nfine photo paste. Having placed the backbone in position, paste\r\ntwo triangular pieces of paper over the ends of the stick to\r\nprevent tearing. The bow is now bent, and the lugs extending from\r\nthe sides of the square paper are bent over the ends of the bow\r\nand pasted down. If the rice is quite dry or mealy it can be\r\nsmeared on and will dry almost immediately, therefore no strings\r\nare needed to hold the bow bent while the paste dries.\r\n\r\nAfter the sticks are in position the kite will appear as shown in\r\nFig. 2. The dotted lines show the lugs bent over the ends of the\r\nbow and pasted down. Figure 3 shows how the band is put on and how\r\nthe kite is balanced. This is the most important part and cannot\r\nbe explained very well. This must be done by experimenting and it\r\nis enough to say that the kite must balance perfectly. The string\r\nis fastened by a slip-knot to the band and moved back and forth\r\nuntil the kite flies properly, then it is securely fastened.\r\n\r\nA reel is next made. Two ends--the bottoms of two small peach\r\nbaskets will do--are fastened to a dowel stick or broom handle, if\r\nnothing better is at hand. These ends are placed about 14 in.\r\napart and strips nailed between them as shown in Fig. 4, and the\r\ncenters drawn in and bound with a string. The kite string used is\r\ngenerally a heavy packing thread. This is run through a thin flour\r\nor rice paste until it is thoroughly coated, then it is run\r\nthrough a quantity of crushed glass. The glass should be beaten up\r\nfine and run through a fine sieve to make it about the same as\r\nNo.2 emery. The particles should be extremely sharp and full of\r\nsplinters. These particles adhere to the pasted string and when\r\ndry are so sharp that it cannot be handled without scratching- the\r\nfingers, therefore the kite is flown entirely from the reel. To\r\nwind the string upon the reel, all that is necessary is to lay one\r\nend of the reel stick in the bend of the left arm and twirl the\r\nother end between the fingers of the right hand.\r\n\r\nA Chinese boy will be flying a gaily colored little kite from the\r\nroof of a house (if it be in one of the large cities where they\r\nhave flat-roofed houses) and a second boy will appear on the roof\r\nof another house perhaps 200 ft. away. Both have large reels full\r\nof string, often several hundred yards of it. The first hundred\r\nfeet or so is glass-covered string, the balance, common packing\r\nthread, or glass-covered string. As soon as the second boy has his\r\nkite aloft, he begins maneuvering to drive it across the wind and\r\nover to the first kite. First, he pays out a large amount of\r\nstring, then as the kite wobbles to one side with its nose\r\npointing toward the first kite, he tightens his line and commences\r\na steady quick pull. If properly done his kite crosses over to the\r\nother and above it. The string is now payed out until the second\r\nkite is hanging over the first one\'s line. The wind now tends to\r\ntake the second kite back to its parallel and in so doing makes a\r\nturn about the first kite\'s string. If the second kite is close\r\nenough, the first tries to spear him by swift dives. The second\r\nboy in the meantime is see-sawing his string and presently the\r\nfirst kite\'s string is cut and it drifts away.\r\n\r\nIt is not considered sport to haul the other fellow\'s kite down as\r\nmight be done and therefore a very interesting battle is often\r\nwitnessed when the experts clash their kites.\r\n--Contributed by S. C. Bunker, Brooklyn, N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Home-Made Vise [211]\r\n\r\nAn ordinary monkey wrench that has been discarded is used in\r\nmaking this vise. The wrench is supported by two L-shaped pieces\r\nof iron fastened with\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Swivel Bench Vise]\r\n\r\na rivet through the end jaw, and these in turn are bolted or\r\nscrewed to the bench. The handle end is held down with a staple.\r\nThe inside jaw is used in clamping and is operated with the thumb\r\nscrew of the wrench. Two holes bored through the thumb piece will\r\ngreatly facilitate setting up the jaws tightly by using a small\r\nrod in the holes as a lever.\r\n\r\nThe vise may be made into a swing vise if the wrench is mounted on\r\na board which is swung on a bolt at one end and held with a pin at\r\nthe other as shown in the illustration. Various holes bored in the\r\nbench on an arc will permit the board to be set at any angle.\r\n--Contributed by Harry S. Moody, Newburyport.

Ten yards of black cambric\r\nor other black cloth and a little ruby fabric will be required.\r\nTake the cambric and fold it into 2-yd. lengths (Fig. 1) which\r\nwill make five layers of cloth, tack or fasten the layers together\r\nso they will not slip and cut an 8-in. square hole in the middle\r\nof one half (Fig. 2) and sew the ruby fabric over the opening. Be\r\nsure and make the seam light-tight and have enough layers of ruby\r\nfabric so no white light can get in. Fold the cloth up so it will\r\nbe 1 yd. square (Fig. 3) and sew up the edges to make a bag with\r\none side open. Put a drawstring in the edge of the cloth around\r\nthe open side and the bag is complete ready for use.\r\n\r\nTake the holders and plate boxes in the lap and put the bag over\r\nthe head and down around the body, then draw the string up tight.\r\nA bag made up in this manner is for use only for a short time. If\r\nit is necessary to do considerable work at a time, then a dust\r\nprotector, such as mill men use, must be attached to a 3-ft.\r\nlength of 2-in. rubber hose and the hose run through a hole in the\r\nbag.

Procure a sheet of asbestos from a plumbing\r\nshop and cut it in the shape of the top of your table. If the\r\ntable is round, make the pad as shown in the illustration, cutting\r\nthe circular piece into quarters. Cut four pieces of canton\r\nflannel. each the size of half the table top. Two of the asbestos\r\npieces are used to make one-half of the pad. Place the two pieces\r\nwith their edges together so they will form half a circle disk and\r\ncover both sides with a piece of the flannel and pin them in\r\nplace. A binding of white cotton tape is then basted around the\r\nedges to hold all the pieces together until they are stitched on a\r\nsewing machine. A line of machine stitching is made all around the\r\noutside and through the middle\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pads Made of Asbestos]\r\n\r\nbetween where the edges of the asbestos sheets join together. This\r\nwill form a hinge so the two quarters may be folded for putting\r\naway. Make the other half circular disk in the same way. If leaves\r\nare wanted in extending the table, any number of pads can be made\r\nto cover them in the same manner with the hinge in the middle of\r\neach pad. The flannel is used with the nap side out so it will\r\nmake the pad soft and noiseless. This kind of a pad furnishes\r\nperfect protection to the table from any heat or moisture.\r\n--Contributed by H. E.

A\r\nshade of brown is the best as it does not soil easily and does not\r\nrequire coloring, which spoils the leather effect.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of the full sized bag are: from A to B, 17-1/2 in.;\r\nfrom C to D, 16-1/4 in.; from E to F,9-1/4 in.; G to H, 6-1/4 in.,\r\nand E to G, 2-1/4 in.\r\n\r\nEnlarge the accompanying pattern to the given dimensions, trace\r\nthis or some other appropriate design on it, and then cut the\r\nleather the size of the pattern.\r\n\r\nUse a sponge to dampen the leather on the rough side, not so damp\r\nthat the water will come through to the right side when working,\r\nbut damp enough to allow the design to be well impressed\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pattern]\r\n\r\non the leather. Use a smooth, non-absorbent surface to lay the\r\nleather on while at work.\r\n\r\nNow lay the pattern on the right side of the leather and with the\r\nsmallest end of the leather tool or a sharp, hard pencil, trace\r\nthe design carefully on the leather. Moisten the leather as\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Design on the Leather]\r\n\r\noften as necessary to keep it sufficiently moist to work well.\r\nTrace the openings for the handles, also lines A-G, H-B, and E-G,\r\nG-J, and corresponding lines on the other side.\r\n\r\nRemove pattern and trace the design directly on leather with the\r\nround point of tool, until it is made distinct and in marked\r\ncontrast to the rest of the leather. Do not make sharp marks but\r\nround the edges of the lines nicely, with the rounded sides of the\r\ntools.\r\n\r\nTo complete the bag, get something with which to make a lining. A\r\npiece of oozed leather is the most satisfactory. Cut it the same\r\nsize as the bag, place both together and with a leather punch,\r\nmake holes all around the edge of the bag about 1/8 in. apart. Cut\r\nout the leather for the handle openings. Care should be taken not\r\nto cut the holes too near the edge of the bag lest the lacing pull\r\nout. Now cut narrow thongs, about 1/8 in. wide, and lace through\r\nthe holes, lacing the sides of the end pieces in with the sides of\r\nthe bag. Crease the lines A-G and B-H inward for ends of bag.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Removing Wire Insulation [213]\r\n\r\nThe claw of a hammer can be used for removing the insulation on\r\ncopper wire, if not more than 1 in. is taken off at a time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Small Electric Motor [214]\r\n\r\nThe drawing herewith shows a simple electric motor which can be\r\neasily constructed by any boy who is at all handy with tools. I\r\nmade this motor\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Electro-Magnet Motor]\r\n\r\nmany times when a boy and can say that if carefully constructed it\r\nwill run with greater rapidity than the more expensive ones.\r\n\r\nA common magnet which can be purchased at any toy store is used.\r\nThe one shown is 3-1/2 in. in length. The armature core is a strip\r\nof 1/16 by 1/4-in. iron, 2-1/4 in. long, bent U-shaped and\r\nfastened to the wood flywheel. Each leg of the armature is wound\r\nwith 10 ft. of No. 24 gauge magnet wire. The commutator is made\r\nfrom an old 22 cartridge filed into two equal parts, each being a\r\nhalf circle, both of which are made fast to a collar on the shaft\r\nE. Each half of the commutator must be insulated from the other\r\nhalf. The collar can be made by wrapping paper around the shaft\r\nuntil the required size is obtained.\r\n\r\nThe top end of the shaft runs in a hole bored in a brass support,\r\nB, which is screwed on the end of a piece of wood mortised in the\r\nbase, as shown in Fig. 1. The lower end of the shaft runs in a\r\nglass bead, D, which is fastened to a small piece of brass with\r\nsealing wax. The small brass piece is fastened to the base with\r\nscrews. The bead should not have an eye larger in diameter than\r\nthe shaft. The shaft is made from an old discarded knitting\r\nneedle. The brushes are fastened to each side of the upright piece\r\nof wood supporting the brass bearing B.\r\n\r\nThe connections to the battery are shown in Fig. 2. Each half of\r\nthe commutator C is connected to the coils AA as shown in Fig. 1.\r\n--Contributed by J.M.

The coin is made\r\nto come forth without touching it or sliding a stick under the\r\nedge of the glass. It is only necessary to claw the cloth near the\r\nglass with the nail of the forefinger.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Removing the Coin]\r\n\r\nThe cloth will produce a movement that will slide the coin to the\r\nedge and from under the glass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Improving Phonograph Sound [214]\r\n\r\nWhen playing loud and harsh records on a phonograph the music is\r\noften spoiled by the vibration of the metal horn. This may be\r\nremedied by buckling a valise or shawl strap around the horn, near\r\nthe center.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make Paper Balloons [215]\r\n\r\nBalloons made spherical, or designed after the regular aeronaut\'s\r\nhot-air balloon, are the best kind to make. Those having an odd or\r\nunusual shape will not make good ascensions, and in most\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Paper Balloon;  Pattern and Parts to Make Balloon]\r\n\r\ncases the paper will catch fire from the torch and burn before\r\nthey have flown very far. The following description is for making\r\na tissue-paper balloon about 6 ft. high.\r\n\r\nThe paper may be selected in several colors, and the gores cut\r\nfrom these, pasted "in alternately, will produce a pretty array of\r\ncolors when the balloon is in flight. The shape of a good balloon\r\nis shown in Fig. 1. The gores for a 6-ft. balloon should be about\r\n8 ft. long or about one-third longer than the height of the\r\nballoon. The widest part of each gore is 16 in. The widest place\r\nshould be 53-1/2 in. from the bottom end, or a little over half\r\nway from the bottom to the top. The bottom of the gore is\r\none-third the width of the widest point. The dimensions and shape\r\nof each gore are shown in Fig. 2.\r\n\r\nThe balloon is made up of 13 gores pasted together, using about\r\n1/2-in. lap on the edges. Any good paste will do--one that is made\r\nup of flour and water well cooked will serve the purpose. If the\r\ngores have been put together right, the pointed ends will close up\r\nthe top entirely and the wider bottom ends will leave an opening\r\nabout 20 in. in diameter. A light wood hoop having the same\r\ndiameter as the opening is pasted to the bottom end of the gores.\r\nTwo cross wires are fastened to the hoop, as shown in Fig. 3.\r\nThese are to hold the wick ball, Fig. 4, so it will hang as shown\r\nin Fig. 5. The wick ball is made by winding wicking around a wire,\r\nhaving the ends bent into hooks as shown.\r\n\r\nThe balloon is filled with hot air in a manner similar to that\r\nused with the ordinary cloth balloon. A small trench or fireplace\r\nis made of brick having a chimney over which the mouth of the\r\npaper balloon is placed. Use fuel that will make heat with very\r\nlittle smoke. Hold the balloon so it will not catch fire from the\r\nflames coming out of the chimney. Have some alcohol ready to pour\r\non the wick ball, saturating it thoroughly. When the balloon is\r\nwell filled carry it away from the fireplace, attach the wick ball\r\nto the cross wires and light it.\r\n\r\nIn starting the balloon on its flight, take care that it leaves\r\nthe ground as nearly upright as possible.\r\n--Contributed by R. E. Staunton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Simple Steamboat Model [216]\r\n\r\nThe small boat shown in the accompanying sketch may have a length\r\nof 12 to 18 in. and is constructed in the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sectional View and Completed Boat]\r\n\r\nfollowing manner: A small steam boiler, A, is supported by two\r\nbraces over an alcohol lamp in the middle of the boat. A small\r\npipe is fastened to the top of the boiler in such a way that the\r\nopen end will be opposite the open end of another pipe, B,\r\nsomewhat larger in size. The pipe B opens into the stern of the\r\nboat at C, as shown in Fig. 1. The steam, coming through the small\r\npipe A, is driven forcibly through the larger pipe B, and carries\r\nwith it a certain amount of air out through the opening C into the\r\nwater. As the boat is driven forward by this force, the steam\r\narises to the surface in the form of bubbles. The boat soon\r\nattains considerable speed, leaving a long wake behind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** To Remove Grease from Machinery  [216]\r\n\r\nA good way to remove grease or oil from machinery before painting\r\nis to brush slaked lime and water over the surface, leaving the\r\nsolution on over night. After washing, the iron is dried and the\r\npaint will stick to it readily. In removing grease from wood,\r\ncommon whitewash may be left on for a few hours and then washed\r\noff with warm water, after which the paint will adhere\r\npermanently.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Game Played on the Ice  [216]\r\n\r\nTwo lines are drawn parallel on the ice from 50 to 100 ft. apart\r\nand blocks of wood are placed every 6 ft. apart on these lines.\r\nThe player opening the game skates to the line and delivers, in\r\nbowling form, a sliding block similar to the blocks that are\r\nplaced on the lines with the exception that it has a handle. The\r\nblocks are about 6 in. wide by 6 in. high and 8 in. long. The\r\nsliding blocks should be at least 1 ft. long and each provided\r\nwith a handle. The handle is attached by boring a hole near one\r\nend in the middle of the block and driving in a wood pin. The hole\r\nis bored slanting so as to incline the handle. Two of these blocks\r\nare provided for the reason that when a player bowls one of the\r\nopposing player\'s blocks over the line he is entitled to another\r\nthrow. The side wins that bowls over all of the opposing\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bowling Over the Opponent\'s Blocks]\r\n\r\nplayers\' blocks first. This will prove an interesting and\r\nenjoyable pastime for skaters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Making Photo Silhouette Brass Plaques [217]\r\n\r\nSecure a brass plate having a smooth surface the right size for\r\nthe photograph and cover it with a coat of paraffin. This is done\r\nby heating the paraffin in a vessel hot enough to make the wax run\r\nfreely, then pouring the liquid over the entire surface of the\r\nbrass.\r\n\r\nWhen the paraffin has cooled sufficiently the outlines of the\r\nphotograph must be drawn upon its surface. There are three ways of\r\ndoing this: First, the photograph can be traced on tissue paper\r\nand then retraced on the paraffin surface. The exact outlines of\r\nthe photograph can be obtained this way without destroying the\r\nprint. Second, if you have several copies of the photograph, one\r\ncan be utilized by tracing direct to the surface of the paraffin.\r\nIn using either of the two methods described, carbon paper must be\r\nplaced on the paraffin before the tissue paper or photograph is\r\nlaid upon it. Third, cut out the outlines of the photograph and\r\nlay it on the paraffin surface, then trace around the edges with\r\nthe point of a needle or sharp point of a knife. The outlines\r\ndrawn by the first method are cut through the paraffin in the same\r\nway. The paraffin is carefully removed from the inside of the\r\nlines, leaving the brass surface perfectly clean, as is shown in\r\nFig. 1.\r\n\r\nThe exposed part of the plate is now ready to be etched or eaten\r\naway to the right depth with acid. The acid solution is made up of\r\n1-1/2 parts muriatic acid and 2 parts water. The mixture should be\r\nplaced in a glass or earthenware\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1 Waxed Brass Plate]\r\n\r\nvessel. If the plate is a small one a saucer will do for the acid\r\nsolution. Pour the acid on the plate where the paraffin has been\r\nremoved and allow it time to etch. The acid should be removed\r\nevery five minutes to examine the etching. If any places show up\r\nwhere the paraffin has not been entirely removed they must be\r\ncleaned so the acid will eat out the metal. When the acid solution\r\nbecomes weak new solution must be added until the proper depth is\r\nsecured. Rinse the plate in cold water, stand in a tray and heat\r\nit sufficiently to run off all the paraffin. Polish the plate by\r\nrubbing it with a piece of flannel.\r\n\r\nThe plaque can be given a real antique finish by painting the\r\netched part with a dull black paint. Drill a small hole in each of\r\nthe four corners, being careful not to dent the metal. The plaque\r\nis backed with a piece of wood 3/4 in. thick, the dimensions of\r\nwhich should exceed those of the brass plate sufficiently to\r\nharmonize with the size of the plaque. The wood should be painted\r\nblack with the same paint used in the plaque. Paint the heads of\r\nfour thumb tacks black and use them in fastening the plaque to the\r\nboard. The finished silhouette will appear as shown in Fig. 2.\r\n--Contributed by John A. Hellwig, Albany, N.

To meet the\r\nsituation I constructed the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1   Fig. 2   Made of a Camera Tripod]\r\n\r\ndevice illustrated herewith. A circular piece of wood, B, 6 in. in\r\ndiameter, is fastened to a common camera tripod, A, with a set\r\nscrew, S. Corner irons, CC, are screwed to the circular piece.\r\nThese corner irons are also screwed to, and supported in a\r\nvertical position by the wood standard D, which is 4 in. wide and\r\nof any desired height. To this standard is secured the wood\r\nshield-shaped piece E by the screw G upon which it turns. A\r\nsemi-circular slit is cut in the piece G, through which passes the\r\nset screw S. The telescope is secured to the piece G by means of\r\nthe pipe straps FF. Rubber bands are put around the telescope to\r\nprevent rubbing at the places where the straps enclose it.\r\n\r\nThe wood pieces were made of mahogany well rubbed with linseed oil\r\nto give them a finish. The corner irons and set screws or bolts\r\nwith thumb-nuts can be purchased at any hardware store. The pipe\r\nstraps of different sizes can be obtained from a plumber\'s or gas\r\nand steam fitter\'s store. With this device, either a vertical or a\r\nhorizontal motion may be secured, and, after bringing the desired\r\nobject into the line of sight, the set screws will hold the\r\ntelescope in position. Anyone owning a tripod can construct this\r\ndevice in three or four hours\' time at a trifling cost. In Fig. 1\r\nis shown the side view of the holder and stand, and Fig. 2 the\r\nfront view.\r\n\r\nIt may be of interest to those owning telescopes without solar\r\neyepieces to know that such an eyepiece can be obtained very\r\ncheaply by purchasing a pair of colored eyeglasses with very dark\r\nlenses and metal rims. Break off the frame, leaving the metal rims\r\nand nibs at each end. Place these over the eyepiece of the\r\ntelescope and secure in place with rubber bands looped over the\r\nnibs and around the barrel of the instrument.\r\n   --Contributed by R. A. Paine, Richmond, Va.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make an Electrical Horn [218]\r\n\r\nSecure an empty syrup or fruit can, any kind having a smooth flat\r\nbottom will do. If the bottom is not perfectly flat, it will\r\ninterfere with the regular tone vibrations, and not produce the\r\nright sound. Remove the label by soaking it in hot water. Take an\r\nordinary electrical bell and remove the gong, clip off the\r\nstriking ball and bend the rod at right angles. Cut a block of\r\nwood 3/4 in. thick, 5 in. wide and 8 in. long for the base. Fasten\r\nthe can on it with a piece of sheet brass or\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tin Can and Bell Parts]\r\n\r\ntin as shown in the sketch. Mount the bell vibrator on the base,\r\nusing a small block of wood to elevate it to the level of the\r\ncenter of the can, and solder the end of the vibrator rod to the\r\nmetal.\r\n\r\nConnect two dry cells to the bell vibrator, and adjust the contact\r\nscrew until a clear tone is obtained. The rapidly moving armature\r\nof the bell vibrator causes the bottom of the can to vibrate with\r\nit, thus producing sound waves. The pitch of the tone depends on\r\nthe thickness of the bottom of the can. This horn, if carefully\r\nadjusted and using two cells of dry battery, will give a soft\r\npleasant tone that can be heard a block away. If the two\r\nprojecting parts of the vibrator are sawed off with a hacksaw, it\r\ncan be mounted on the inside of the can. This will make a very\r\ncompact electric horn, as only the can is visible. --Contributed\r\nby John Sidelmier, La Salle, Ill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Driving a Washing Machine with Motorcycle Power [219]\r\n\r\nThe halftone illustration shows how 1 rigged up my washing machine\r\nto be driven by the power from my motorcycle.

Usually a lamp globe costs less than an\r\naquarium globe of the same dimensions. Procure a yellow pine block\r\n3 in. thick and 12 in. square. The more uneven and twisted the\r\ngrain the better for the purpose,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lamp Globe as an Aquarium]\r\n\r\nit is then less liable to develop a continuous crack.\r\n\r\nCut out a depression for the base of the globe as shown in Fig. 1.\r\nPour in aquarium cement and embed the globe in it. Pour more\r\ncement inside of the globe until the cement is level with the top\r\nof the block. Finish with a ring of cement around the outside and\r\nsprinkle with fine sand while the cement is damp. Feet may be\r\nadded to the base if desired. The weight of the pine block makes a\r\nvery solid and substantial base for the globe and renders it less\r\nliable to be upset.\r\n--Contributed by James R.

But by the method described\r\nin the following paragraph anyone can make new and interesting\r\nslides in a few minutes\' time and at a very small cost.\r\n\r\nSecure a number of glass plates of the size that will fit your\r\nlantern and clean them on both sides. Dissolve a piece of white\r\nrosin in a half-pint of gasoline and flow it over one side of the\r\nplates and allow to dry. Place the dried plate over a picture you\r\nwish to reproduce and draw the outline upon the thin film. A lead\r\npencil, pen and ink or colored crayons can be used, as the rosin\r\nand gasoline give a surface that can be written upon as easily as\r\nupon paper. When the slide becomes uninteresting it can be cleaned\r\nwith a little clear gasoline and used again to make another slide.\r\nA slide can be made in this way in five minutes and an interesting\r\noutline picture in even less time than that.\r\n\r\nThis solution also makes an ideal retouching varnish for\r\nnegatives.\r\n--Contributed by J.E.

Neyer, One Cloud, Cal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Sheet-Metal Whisk-Broom Holder [221]\r\n\r\nA whisk-broom holder such as is shown in the accompanying picture\r\nmay be easily made by the amateur. The tools needed are few: a\r\npair of tin shears, a metal block of some kind upon which to pound\r\nwhen riveting, a hammer or mallet, several large nails, and a\r\nstout board upon which to work up the design. A rivet punch is\r\ndesirable, though not absolutely necessary.\r\n\r\nThe material required is a sheet of No. 24 gauge copper or brass\r\nof a size equal to that of the proposed holder, plus a 3/8-in.\r\nborder all around, into which to place the screws that are to be\r\nused to hold the metal to the board while pounding it. The design\r\nshown in the picture is 6 by 8 in. at the widest part and has\r\nproven a satisfactory holder for a small broom.\r\n\r\nCarefully work out the design desired on a piece of drawing paper,\r\nboth outline and decoration, avoiding sharp curves in the outline\r\nbecause they are hard to follow with the shears when cutting the\r\nmetal. If the design is to be of two-part symmetry, like the one\r\nshown, draw one part, then fold on a center line and duplicate\r\nthis by inserting double-surfaced carbon paper and tracing the\r\npart already drawn. With this same carbon paper transfer the\r\ndesign to the metal. Fasten the metal to the board firmly, using\r\n1/2-in. screws placed about 1 in. apart in holes previously\r\npunched in the margin with a nail set or nail.\r\n\r\nTo flatten the metal preparatory to fastening it to the board,\r\nplace a block of wood upon it and pound on this block, never upon\r\nthe metal directly,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Completed Holder Brass Fastened to Board-Method of\r\nRiveting]\r\n\r\nor the surface will be dented and look bad in the finished piece.\r\n\r\nTake the nail, a 10 or 20-penny wire or cut, and file it to a\r\nchisel edge, rounding it just enough to take the sharpness off so\r\nthat it will not cut the metal. This tool is used for indenting\r\nthe metal so as to bring out the outline of the design on the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nThere are several ways of working up the design. The simplest way\r\nis to take the nail and merely "chase" the outlines of holder\r\ndesign. Remove the screws, cut off the surplus metal and file the\r\nedges until they are smooth. Make a paper pattern for the metal\r\nband that is to hold the broom. Trace around this pattern on the\r\nmetal and cut out the shape. Punch rivet holes in holder and band,\r\nalso a hole by which to hang the whole upon the wall.\r\n\r\nRivet the band to the holder. Punch the rivet holes with a nail\r\nset and make the holes considerably larger than the diameter of\r\nthe rivet, for in flattening the raised edges the holes will\r\nclose. Do the riveting on a metal block and keep the head of the\r\nrivet on the back of the holder. Round up the "upset" end of the\r\nriveted part as shown in the picture. Do not bend it over or\r\nflatten it. This rounding is done by pounding around the outer\r\nedge of the rivet end and not flat upon the top as in driving a\r\nnail.\r\n\r\nClean the metal by scrubbing it off with a solution composed of\r\none-half water and one-half nitric acid. Use a rag tied to a stick\r\nand do not allow the acid to touch either your hands or clothes. A\r\nmetal lacquer may next be applied to keep the metal from early\r\ncorrosion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Camp Stool [222]\r\n\r\nThe stool, as shown in Fig. 1, is made of beech or any suitable\r\nwood\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Camp Stool Details]\r\n\r\nwith a canvas or carpet top.

The entire length of each part is rounded off for\r\nthe sake of neatness as well as lightness.\r\n\r\nAbout 1/2 yd. of 11-in. wide material will be required for the\r\nseat and each end of this is nailed securely on the under side of\r\nthe top pieces. The woodwork may be stained and varnished or plain\r\nvarnished and the cloth may be made to have a pleasing effect by\r\nstencilling in some neat pattern.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Small Home-Made Electric Motor  [222]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying photographs show the construction of a very\r\nunique electric motor, the parts consisting of the frame from an\r\nold bicycle pedal wrapped with insulated wire to make the armature\r\nand three permanent magnets taken from an old telephone magneto.\r\nThe pedal, being ball bearing, rotated with very little friction\r\nand at a surprisingly high rate of speed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Motor Complete]\r\n\r\nThe dust cap on the end of the pedal was removed and a battery\r\nconnection, having quite a length of threads, was soldered to it\r\nas shown in the photograph.

Two pieces of felt, each 1-1/4 in. wide\r\nand 4-1/4 in. long, are cut V-shaped on one end of each piece\r\nabout 1 in. in depth, and 3/8 in. in from the other end of one\r\npiece cut a slit 1/2 in. long; the end of the other piece is\r\nfolded over, making a lap of about 1 in., and a slit is cut\r\nthrough the double thickness to match the one cut in the first\r\npiece. The desired emblem, initial, or pennant is stenciled on the\r\noutside of the folded piece with class, college or lodge colors.\r\nThe strap is made from a strip of felt 3/16 in. wide and 8-1/4 in.\r\nlong; stitched on both edges for appearance. Make a hole with a\r\npunch 1-1/4 in. from one end, and two holes in the other, one\r\nabout 1 in. and the other 2-3/4 in. from the end. Purchase a\r\n1/2-in. buckle from a harness maker and you will have all the\r\nparts necessary for the fob. Assemble as shown in the sketch. The\r\nend of the strap having the two holes is put through the slots cut\r\nin the wide pieces and the tongue of the buckle is run through\r\nboth holes.

Make a paper pattern of the size indicated in the\r\naccompanying drawing, putting in the design.\r\n\r\nThe necessary tools consist of a stick with a straight edge and a\r\ntool with an end shaped like that of a nutpick. A nutpick with a\r\nV-shaped point will do if the sharpness is smoothed off by means\r\nof a piece of emery paper, so that it will indent without cutting\r\nthe leather. These tools can be bought for this special purpose,\r\nbut are not essential for this piece if the nutpick is at hand.\r\nThere\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Portfolio Design]\r\n\r\nwill also be needed a level, non-absorbent surface upon which to\r\nlay the leather while working it. A piece of thick glass, metal,\r\nor marble will serve.\r\n\r\nBegin work by moistening the leather on the back side with a\r\nsponge or cloth. Moisten as much as you dare and still not have\r\nthe moisture show on the face side. Next place the leather on the\r\nglass, face up, and, holding the pattern firmly in place so that\r\nit will not slip--if possible get some one to hold the pattern for\r\nyou--place the straight edge on the straight lines and mark out or\r\nindent. After this has been done, mark over the design. A pencil\r\nmay be used the first time over.\r\n\r\nThe pattern is now to be removed and all the lines gone over with\r\nthe tool to make them deep and uniform.\r\n\r\nThe surplus stock around the edges may not be cut off. A neat way\r\nto finish the edges is to punch a series of holes entirely around\r\nthrough which a thin leather thong may be laced. If it is desired\r\nto "line" the inside, this should be done before the holes are\r\npunched or the lacing done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Gear for Model Work [225]\r\n\r\nWhen a gear is needed to drive a small pinion and there is none of\r\nthe right size at hand, one can be made in the following manner:\r\nTurn up a wood disk to the proper diameter and 1/4 in. thicker\r\nthan the pinion, and cut a flat bottom groove 3/16 in. deep in its\r\nface. The edges should be about 1/8 in. or more thick on each\r\nside. Measure the distance between centers of two adjacent teeth\r\nin the pinion and step this off around the periphery in the bottom\r\nof the groove. Drill holes into the wood on each point stepped off\r\nand insert steel pins made of wire, allowing\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Steel Pins in Wood]\r\n\r\nthe end of each to protrude just far enough to act as a tooth. In\r\nthis way a good gear for light work can be quickly and cheaply\r\nconstructed.\r\n--Contributed by Henry Schaefer, New York City.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Home-Made Vise [226]\r\n\r\nWhile making a box I had some dovetailing to do, and as there was\r\nno\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Vise on Bench]\r\n\r\nvise on the bench I rigged up a substitute.

This bench can be\r\nmade easily by anyone who has a few sharp tools and a little spare\r\ntime. If the stock is purchased from the mill ready planed and cut\r\nto length, much of the hard labor will be saved. Birch or maple\r\nwood makes a very good bench. and the following pieces should be\r\nordered:\r\n\r\n    4 legs, 3 by 3 by 36.\r\n    2 side rails, 3 by 3 by 62-1/2 in.\r\n    2 end rails, 3 by 3 by 20 in.\r\n    1 back board, 1 by 9 by 80 in.\r\n    1 top board, 2 by 12 by 77 in.\r\n    1 top board, 1 by 12 by 77 in.\r\n    2 crosspieces, 1-1/2 by 3 by 24 in.\r\n    1 piece for clamp, 1-1/2 by 6-1/2 by 12 in.\r\n    1 piece for clamp, 1-1/2 by 6-1/2 by 14 in.\r\n    4 guides, 2 by 2 by 18 in.\r\n    1 screw block, 3 by 3 by 6 in.\r\n    1 piece, 1-1/2 by 4-1/2 by 10-1/2 in.\r\n\r\n\r\nMake the lower frame first. Cut tenons on the rails and mortise\r\nthe posts, then fasten them securely together with 3/8 by 5-in.\r\nlag screws as shown. Also fasten the 1-1/2 by 3 by 24-in. pieces\r\nto the tops of the posts with screws. The heads should be\r\ncountersunk or else holes bored in the top boards to fit over\r\nthem. Fasten the front top board to the crosspieces by lag screws\r\nthrough from the under side. The screws can be put in from the top\r\nfor the 1-in. thick top board.\r\n\r\nFasten the end pieces on with screws, countersinking the heads of\r\nthe vise end. Cut the 2-in. square holes in the 1-1/2 by 4-1/2 by\r\n10-in. pieces for the vise slides, and fit it in place for the\r\nside vise. Also cut square holes in the one end piece for the end\r\nvise slides as shown. Now fit up the two clamps. Fasten the slides\r\nto the front pieces with screws. Countersink the heads of the\r\nscrews so they will not be in the way of the hands when the vise\r\nis used. The two clamp screws should be about 1-1/2 in. in\r\ndiameter. They can be purchased at a hardware store. A block\r\nshould be fitted under the crosspiece to hold the nut for the end\r\nvise. After\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Detail of the Bench]\r\n\r\nyou have the slides fitted, put them in place and bore the holes\r\nfor the clamp screws.\r\n\r\nThe back board can now be fastened to the back with screws as\r\nshown in the top view. The bench is now complete, except for a\r\ncouple of coats of oil which should be applied to give it a finish\r\nand preserve the wood. The amateur workman, as well as the pattern\r\nmaker, will find this a very handy and serviceable bench for his\r\nworkshop.\r\n\r\nAs the amateur workman does not always know just what tools he\r\nwill need, a list is given which will answer for a general class\r\nof work. This list can be added to as the workman becomes more\r\nproficient in his line and has need for other tools. Only the long\r\nrun.

The calf skin, being softer, will\r\nbe easier to work, but will not make as rigid a case as the cow\r\nskin. If calf skin is to be used, secure a piece of modeling calf.\r\nThe extreme width of the case is 2-3/8 in. and the length 6-5/8\r\nin. Two pieces will be required of this size. Put on the design\r\nbefore the two parts are sewed together. First draw the design on\r\npaper, then prepare the leather. Place the leather on a small\r\nnon-absorbent surface, such as copper or brass, and moisten the\r\nback side with as much water as it will take and still not show on\r\nthe face side. Turn the leather, lay the design on the face, and\r\nhold it in place while both the outline and decoration are traced\r\non the surface with a pencil or some tool that will make a sharp\r\nline without tearing the paper.\r\n\r\nAfter the outlines are traced, go over the indentations a second\r\ntime so as to make them sharp and distinct. There are special\r\nmodeling tools that can be purchased for this purpose, but a\r\nV-shaped nut pick, if smoothed with emery paper so that it will\r\nnot cut the leather, will do just as well.\r\n\r\nTake a stippling tool--if no such tool is at hand, a cup-pointed\r\nnail set will do--and stamp the background. It is intended that\r\nthe full design shall be placed on the back and the same design\r\nplaced on the front as far as the material will allow. Be careful\r\nin stamping not to pound so hard as to cut the leather. A little\r\nrubbing on the point with emery will take off the sharpness always\r\nfound on a new tool.\r\n\r\nHaving prepared the two sides, they may be placed together and\r\nsewed around the edges.\r\n\r\nIf cow hide is preferred, the same\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Two Designs of Cases]\r\n\r\nmethod of treatment is used, but a form will need to be made and\r\nplaced inside the case while the leather is drying to give it the\r\nright shape. The form can be made of a stick of wood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Waterproofing a Wall [229]\r\n\r\nThe best way to make a tinted wall waterproof is to first use a\r\nmaterial composed of cement properly tinted and with no glue in\r\nit--one that will not require a glue size on the wall. After this\r\ncoating of cement is applied directly to the plaster, cover it\r\ncompletely with water enamel and, when dry, give the surface a\r\nthorough coating of varnish. This will make a perfectly impervious\r\ncovering, which steam, water or heat will not affect.\r\n--Contributed by Julia A.

On coming down to the\r\nlower floor it is often found that the bob has been secured either\r\ntoo high or too low. When fastening the line give it plenty of\r\nslack and when the lower floor is reached make a double loop in\r\nthe line, as shown in the sketch.

This coaster is\r\nsimple and easy to make, says Scientific American. It is\r\nconstructed of a good quality of pine. The pieces marked S are\r\nsingle, and should be about 1 by 1-1/2 in.; the pieces\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Has the Lines of a Bicycle]\r\n\r\nmarked D are double or in duplicate, and should be 1/2 by 1-1/2\r\nin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Coasting]\r\n\r\nThe runners are shod with iron and are pivoted to the uprights as\r\nshown, double pieces being secured to the uprights to make a fork.\r\nThe seat is a board, to the underside of which is a block, which\r\ndrops down between the two top slats and is secured with a pin. A\r\nfootrest is provided consisting of a short crosspiece secured to\r\nthe front of the frame and resting on the two lower slats. The\r\nframe and front fork are hinged together with four short eyebolts,\r\nE, with a short bolt through each pair as shown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Spelling Names with Photo Letters [232]\r\n\r\nThere are, no doubt, many amateur photographers who make only\r\noccasional trips afield or through the more traveled thoroughfares\r\nwith their cameras during the winter months. Each one is generally\r\ninterested in working up the negatives that he or she made during\r\nthe summer or on that last vacation into souvenir post cards,\r\nalbums and the like, for sending to friends. Illustrated herewith\r\nis something different from the album or photographic calendar.\r\nThe letters forming part of the word POPULAR are good examples of\r\nthis work.\r\n\r\nThe masks which outline the letters are cut from the black paper\r\nin which plates come packed. Their size depends on the plate used.\r\nA sharp knife, a smooth board and a straightedge are all the tools\r\nneeded, says Camera Craft. If the letters are all cut the same\r\nheight, they will look remarkably uniform, even if one is not\r\nskilled in the work of forming them all in accordance with the\r\nrules. Be sure to have the prints a little larger than the letters\r\nto insure a sufficient margin in trimming, so as to have a white\r\nmargin around the finished letters. The best method is to use a\r\ngood pair of scissors or a sharp knife.\r\n\r\nMany combinations can be made of these letter pictures to spell\r\nout the recipient\'s name or the season\'s greeting. During the\r\nholidays the letters may be made from winter scenes to spell "A\r\nMerry Christmas" or "A Happy New Year." An Easter greeting may\r\nhave more spring-like subjects and a birthday remembrance a\r\nfitting month. The prints are no more difficult to make than the\r\nordinary kind. In cutting out an 0, for example, do not forget to\r\ncut out a piece to correspond to the center. This piece can be\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Letters Made from photographs]\r\n\r\nplaced on the printing paper after the outline mask has been laid\r\ndown, using care to get it in the right position, and closing the\r\nframe carefully so that the small piece will not be disturbed. The\r\nletters should be of the kind to give as large an area of surface\r\nto have as much of the picture show as possible. What the printer\r\ncalls black face letters are the most suitable.\r\n\r\nBy cutting the letters out of black paper in a solid form, and\r\nusing these as a mask for a second printing after printing the\r\nfull size of the negatives, these letter pictures can be made with\r\na black border. So made, they can be trimmed to a uniform black\r\nline all around; and, mounted on a white card and photographed\r\ndown to post card size, the greeting so spelled out makes a most\r\nunique souvenir. Another application of the letters in copying is\r\nto paste them on a white card as before, trim the card even with\r\nthe bottoms of the letters, stand the strip of card on a mirror\r\nlaid flat on a table, and then photograph both the letters and\r\ntheir reflections so as to nicely fill a post card. Still another\r\nsuggestion is to cut out the letters, after, pasting the prints on\r\nsome thin card, and then arrange them in the desired order to\r\nspell out the name or greeting, but with flowers interspersed and\r\nforming a background, photographing them down to the desired size.\r\nA third means of securing a novel effect by photographing down an\r\narrangement of the letters is to have them cut out in stiff form\r\nas in the last method; mount them on short pieces of corks, in\r\nturn fastened to a white card forming the background. So arranged,\r\nthe letters will stand out from the card about 1/2 in. If they are\r\nnow placed in a light falling from the side and slightly in front,\r\neach letter will cast a shadow upon the background, and in the\r\nfinished print the letters will look as if suspended in the air in\r\nfront of the surface of the card.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Holding a Loose Screw [233]\r\n\r\nA piece of sheet lead put on each side of a screw will fill up and\r\nhold the threads in a too large hole.\r\n\r\nA Checker Board Puzzle [233]\r\n\r\nPlace eight checker men upon the checker board as shown in the\r\nfirst row in the sketch. The puzzle is to get\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Placing the Checkers]\r\n\r\nthem in four piles of two men each without omitting to jump over\r\ntwo checker men every time a move is made.\r\n\r\nThe first move is to jump 5 over 4 and 3 on 2 which is shown in\r\nthe second row, then jump 3 over 4 and 6 on 7 and the positions\r\nwill appear as shown in the third row; jump 1 over 2 and 5 on 4 to\r\nget the men placed like the fourth row and the last move is to\r\njump 8 over 3 and 7 on 6 which will make the four piles of two men\r\neach as shown in the fifth row.\r\n--Contributed by I.

A hole 6 or 7\r\nin. square is cut in each end level with the earth\'s surface and\r\nboxes 18 in. long that will just fit are set in, hung on pivots,\r\nwith the longest end outside, so they will lie horizontal. A\r\nrabbit may now look through the two tubes, says the American\r\nThresherman. The bait is hung on a string from the top of the\r\nlarge box so that it may be seen and smelled from the outside. The\r\nrabbit naturally goes into the holes and in this trap there is\r\nnothing to awaken his suspicion. He smells the bait, squeezes\r\nalong past the center of the tube, when it tilts down and the game\r\nis shot into the pit, the tube righting itself at once for another\r\ncatch. The top and sides of the large box may be covered with\r\nleaves, snow or anything to hide it. A door placed in the top will\r\nenable the trapper to take out the animals. By placing a little\r\nhay or other food in the bottom of the box the trap need not be\r\nvisited oftener than once a week.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Old-Time Magic - Changing a Button into a Coin [234]\r\n\r\nPlace a button in the palm of the left hand, then place a coin\r\nbetween the second and third fingers of the right hand.

Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Imitation Arms and Armor PART I [235]\r\n\r\nGenuine antique swords and armor, as used by the knights and\r\nsoldiers in the days of old, are very expensive and at the present\r\ntime practically impossible to obtain. The accompanying\r\nillustration shows four designs of swords that anyone can make,\r\nand if carefully made, they will look very much like the genuine\r\narticle.\r\n\r\nThe drawings are so plain that the amateur armorer should have\r\nvery little difficulty, if any, in building up his work from the\r\nillustrations, whether he requires a single sword only, or a\r\ncomplete suit of armor, full size.\r\n\r\nThe pieces. or designs in this article are from authentic sources,\r\nsays the English Mechanic, so that where names are given the\r\namateur can so label them, and will thereby greatly add to their\r\ninterest and value.\r\n\r\nAn executioners\' sword of the fifteenth century is shown in Fig.\r\n1. The blade should be about 27 in. long with a handle of\r\nsufficient length to be grasped by both hands. The width of the\r\nblade near the handle is about 2-1/2 in., tapering down to 1-1/2\r\nin. near the point end. Several ridges are cut around the handle\r\nto permit a firm grip. The cross guard is flat and about 1 in. in\r\nwidth.\r\n\r\nMark out the shape and size of the blade on a piece of wood 1/8\r\nin. thick, using a straightedge and a pencil, and allowing a few\r\ninches more in length on which to fasten the handle. Cut out the\r\nwood with a scroll saw or a keyhole saw, trim the edges down thin\r\nand smooth both surfaces with fine sandpaper. The end for the\r\nhandle is cut about 1 in. wide and 2 in. long. The cross guard is\r\ncut out and a hole made in the center through which to pass the\r\nhandle end of the blade. The handle is next made, and if the\r\namateur does not possess a lathe on which to turn the shape of the\r\nhandle, the ridges around the wood may be imitated by gluing and\r\ntacking on pieces of small rope. The handle is then mortised to\r\nreceive the 1 by 2-in. end of the blade. The cross guard is now\r\nglued and placed\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Swords; Fig. 1, Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4]\r\n\r\non the blade, then the hole in the handle is well glued with glue\r\nthat is not too thick and quite hot. The blade with the cross\r\nguard is inserted in the handle and allowed to set. When the glue\r\nis thoroughly dry, remove the surplus with a sharp knife and paint\r\nthe handle with brown, dark red, or green oil paint. The blade is\r\ncovered with tinfoil to give it the appearance of steel. Secure\r\nsome pieces of tinfoil and cut one strip 1/2 in. wider than the\r\nblade and the other 1/4 in. narrower. Quickly paint the blade well\r\nwith thin glue on one side., then lay evenly and press on the\r\nnarrow strip of tinfoil. Glue the other side of the blade, put on\r\nthe wider strip of tinfoil and glue the overlapping edge and press\r\nit around and on the surface of the narrow strip. The cross guard\r\nmust be covered with tinfoil in the same manner as the blade. When\r\nthe whole is quite dry, wipe the blade with light strokes up and\r\ndown several times, using a soft and dry piece of cloth. The sword\r\nis then ready to hang in its chosen place as a decoration, not for\r\nuse only in cases of tableaux, for which this article will be\r\nespecially useful to those who are arranging living pictures\r\nwherein swords and armor are part of the paraphernalia.\r\n\r\nA Chinese scimitar is shown in Fig. 2. The handle of this sword is\r\noval and covered with plaited cord. In making this scimitar,\r\nfollow the directions as for Fig. 1, except that the handle has to\r\nbe covered with a round black cord. If it is found difficult to\r\nplait the cord on the handle as in the illustration, wind it\r\naround in a continuous line closely together, and finish by\r\nfastening with a little glue and a small tack driven through the\r\ncord into the handle. The pommel is a circular piece of wood, 1/8\r\nin. thick and 5 in. in diameter. The length of the handle,\r\nallowing for a good hold with both hands, should be about 9 in.,\r\nthe length of the blade 28 in., the width near the pommel 1-1/2\r\nin. and 3 in. in the widest part at the lower end. The sharp or\r\ncutting edge is only on the short side, the other is flat or\r\nhalf-round.\r\n\r\nA Turkish sabre of ancient manufacture from Constantinople is\r\nshown in Fig. 3. The handle is painted a dull creamy white in\r\nimitation of ivory. The enamel paint sold in small tins will\r\nanswer well for this purpose. The cross guard and blade are\r\ncovered as described in Fig. 1. The sharp edge is on the longer\r\ncurved side, the other is flat or half-round.\r\n\r\nA two-handed sword used in the 14th and 15th centuries is shown in\r\nFig. 4. This sword is about 68 in. long, has a cross guard and\r\nblade of steel with a round wood handle painted black. The ball or\r\npommel on top of the handle is steel. Both edges of the blade are\r\nsharp. This sword is made in wood the same as described for Fig.\r\n1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Dovetail Joint Puzzle [236]\r\n\r\nA simple but very ingenious example in joinery is illustrated. In\r\nthe finished piece, Fig. 1, the dovetail appears on each side of\r\nthe square stick of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: How the Joint Is Cut]\r\n\r\nwood, the illustration, of course, shows only two sides, the other\r\ntwo are identical. The joint is separable and each part is solid\r\nand of one piece. In making, take two pieces of wood, preferably\r\nof contrasting colors, such as cherry and walnut or mahogany and\r\nboxwood, about 1-1/2 in. square and of any length desired. Cut the\r\ndovetail on one end of each stick as shown in Fig. 2, drive\r\ntogether and then plane off the triangular corners marked A. The\r\nend of each piece after the dovetails are cut appear as shown in\r\nFig. 3, the lines marking the path of the dovetail through the\r\nstick.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Radiator Water [236]\r\n\r\nPure rain water is the best to use in a cooling system of an\r\nautomobile engine, as it is free from the mineral substances which\r\nare deposited in the radiator, piping and jackets by hard water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Springboard for Swimmers [237]\r\n\r\nA good springboard adds much to the fun of swimming. The boards\r\nare generally made so that the plank will bend, being dressed down\r\nthin at one end and fastened. The thinness of the plank, or an\r\ninsecure fastening, causes many a plank to snap in two or come\r\nloose from its fastenings in a short time.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying sketch shows the method of constructing a\r\nspringboard that does not depend upon the bending of the wood for\r\nits spring. It is made of a plank, 2 in. thick and from 14 to 16\r\nft. long, one end of which is secured with a hinge arrangement\r\nhaving a U-shaped rod whose ends are held with nuts. On each edge\r\nof the board, at the lower end, are fastened two pieces of strap\r\niron, each about 1 ft. long and with the lower ends drilled to fit\r\nthe horizontal of the U-shaped rod.\r\n\r\nSecure a pair of light buggy springs from a discarded rig and\r\nattach them to the ends of a square bar of iron having a length\r\nequal to the width of the plank. Fasten this to the plank with\r\nbolts, as shown in the sketch. Should the springs be too high they\r\ncan be moved forward.\r\n--Contributed by John Blake, Franklin, Mass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Buggy Springs Used beneath the Board]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Taking Button from a Child\'s Nostril [237]\r\n\r\nA three-year-old child snuffed a button up its nostril and the\r\nmother, in an attempt to remove it, had caused the button to be\r\npushed farther up the channel. Doctors probed for the button\r\nwithout success. The distracted mother happened to think of snuff,\r\nand, as there was some at hand, took a pinch of snuff between the\r\nthumb and forefinger and held it close to the child\'s nose. The\r\nviolent sneezing caused the button to be blown out. Such an\r\naccident may come under the observation of any parent, and if so,\r\nthis method can be used to relieve the child when medical\r\nassistance is not at hand.\r\n--Contributed by Katharine D. Morse, Syracuse, N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Brass Frame in Repouss\xc3\xa9  [237]\r\n\r\nPunches can be purchased, as can the pitch bed or block. Both can\r\nbe made easily, however. Several punches of different sizes and\r\nshapes will be needed. A piece of mild steel, about 3/8 in.\r\nsquare, can be easily worked into tools shaped as desired. A cold\r\nchisel will be needed to cut the metal to length; a file to reduce\r\nthe ends to shape, and a piece of emery paper to smooth and polish\r\nthe end of the tool so that it will not scar the metal.\r\n\r\nA small metal box must be secured to hold the pitch. The\r\nillustration shows an iron receptacle. The pitch is prepared by\r\nheating the following materials in these proportions: pitch, 5\r\nlb.; plaster of Paris, 5 lb.; tallow, 1/2\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Design for the Frame]\r\n\r\nlb. To put it in another way, use pitch and plaster in equal parts\r\nwith 1/10 part tallow. See that the pitch and plaster are dry so\r\nthat the moisture will not cause the pitch to boil over. Keep\r\nstirring the mass so that it never boils. Melt the pitch first and\r\nadd the plaster by degrees.\r\n\r\nFor a piece of repouss\xc3\xa9 such as the frame shown, secure a piece of\r\nbrass of about No. 18 gauge. With carbon paper trace the design on\r\nthe brass. Place the metal on the pitch bed and work over the\r\noutline of the design. Use the chisel-edged tool and try to make\r\nthe lines continuous. When this has been done, heat the pitch\r\nslightly\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Working Out The Design]\r\n\r\nand place the metal, design down, on the pitch, and with the\r\nraising punches work up the shape as desired after the pitch has\r\nhardened. When the desired form has been obtained, turn the metal\r\nover and "touch up" any places improperly raised. The metal will\r\nprobably be warped somewhat. To remedy this, place a board on the\r\nmetal and pound until the metal assumes a flat shape again. Next\r\ndrill a hole in the center waste and saw out for the opening,\r\nusing a small metal saw. Trim up the edges and file them smooth.\r\nClean the metal thoroughly, using powdered pumice with lye. Cotton\r\nbatting fastened to the end of a stick will make a good brush.\r\nUpon the cleansed metal put a lacquer to prevent tarnishing. Metal\r\nclips may be soldered to the back to hold the picture in place and\r\nalso a metal strip to hold the frame upright. These should be\r\nplaced before the metal is lacquered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Finding the Horsepower of Small Motors [238]\r\n\r\nA small motor often excites curiosity as to its true horsepower,\r\nor fraction of a horsepower. Guesses in this direction vary\r\nremarkably for the same motor or engine. It is comparatively easy\r\nto determine the horsepower put out by almost any machine by the\r\nfollowing method which is intended for small battery motors and\r\nsmall steam engines.\r\n\r\nBefore giving the description, it may be well to know what\r\nhorsepower means. Horsepower is the rate of work and a unit is\r\nequal to 33,000 ft. lb. per minute, or 550 ft. lb. per second.\r\nThat is lifting 33,000 lb. 1 ft. in one minute or 550 lb. 1 ft. in\r\none second. This may be applied to the problem of finding the\r\nhorsepower of a motor by fastening a piece of twine about 25 ft.\r\nlong to the shaft of the engine or motor to be tested in such a\r\nway that when the shaft revolves it will wind up the string\r\nsimilar to a windlass. Place the motor in such a position that the\r\ntwine will hang freely without touching anything: out of a high\r\nwindow will do. Fasten a weight to the other end of the line as\r\nheavy as the motor or engine can lift and still run. It must weigh\r\nenough to slow the power down a little, but not to stop it. Mark\r\nthe position of the weight and start the motor, at the same time\r\naccurately measuring time in minutes and seconds it takes to lift\r\nthe weight from the lowest point to the highest. Next measure\r\naccurately the distance in feet covered by the weight in its\r\nascent and obtain the correct weight in pounds of the weight.\r\n\r\nMultiply the weight by the distance covered and divide the result\r\nby the number of minutes or fraction of a minute obtained and\r\ndivide this last result by 33,000 and the quotient will be the\r\nhorsepower of the motor or engine.\r\n\r\nPerhaps an illustration will make this solution much plainer.\r\nSuppose the motor will lift a weight of 1 lb. and still revolve,\r\n30 ft. in 10 seconds or 1/6 of a minute. Multiplying 1 by 30 we\r\nget 30, which divided by 1/6 gives 180. This in turn divided by\r\n33,000 equals in round numbers 1/200 part of a horsepower.\r\n--Contributed by Harold H.

Secure two\r\nglass vessels having straight sides of the same height, one 18 in.\r\nin diameter (Fig. 1) and the other 12 in. in diameter (Fig. 2).\r\nThe smaller is placed within the larger, the bottoms being covered\r\nwith moss and aquarium decorations which can be purchased at a\r\nbird store. Fill the 3-in. space between the vessels with water.\r\nCut a piece of galvanized screen into circular form to cover the\r\nlarger vessel, and hang a bird swing, A, Fig. 3, in the center.\r\nPlace the screen on top of the vessels so that the swing will hang\r\nin the center of the inner vessel. A weight--a box filled with\r\nsand will do--should be placed on top of the screen, over the\r\nsmaller vessel, to keep it from floating. Moss should be put over\r\nthe top of the screen so that the two separate vessels can not be\r\nseen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 18 in. Diameter; 12 in. Diameter]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Birds and Fish Apparently Together]\r\n\r\nPlace the birds in the inner vessel and the fish in the water. The\r\neffect is surprising.

A riveting hammer and a pair\r\nof pliers will be needed, also a pair of tin shears and a piece of\r\nmetal upon which to rivet.\r\n\r\nCut out a piece of metal for the base to a size of  5-1/2 by 5-1/2\r\nin. Trim the sharp corners off slightly. Draw a pencil line all\r\naround the margin and 5/8 in. away from the edge. With the pliers\r\nshape the sides as shown in the illustration.\r\n\r\nNext lay out the holding cup according to the plan of development\r\nshown, and cut out the shape with the shears. Polish both of these\r\npieces, using any of the common metal polishes. Rivet the cup to\r\nthe base, and then, with the pliers, shape the sides as shown in\r\nthe photograph. The manner of making and fastening the handle is\r\nclearly illustrated. Use a file to smooth all the cut edges so\r\nthat they will not injure the hands.\r\n\r\nIn riveting, care should be taken to round up the heads of the\r\nrivets nicely as a good mechanic would. Do not be content merely\r\nto bend them over. This rounding is easily accomplished by\r\nstriking around the rivets\' outer circumference, keeping the\r\ncenter high.\r\n\r\nA good lacquer should be applied after the parts have been\r\nproperly cleaned and polished, to keep the metal from tarnishing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Details of Candle Holder]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Home-Made Duplicator [240]\r\n\r\nThe usual gelatine pad, which is the principal part of the average\r\nhectograph or duplicator, is, as a rule, unsatisfactory, as it is\r\napt to sour and mold in the summer and freeze in the winter,\r\nwhich, with other defects, often render it useless after a few\r\nmonths service.\r\n\r\nA compound that is almost indestructible is the preparation sold\r\nat art stores as modeling clay. This clay is as easily worked as a\r\nputty and is spread into the tray, which may be of wood or tin,\r\nand the surface leveled by pounding with a mallet or hammer, then\r\nby drawing a straightedge over it.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the pad is now saturated with pure glycerine. This\r\nis poured upon the surface after it is slightly warmed, covering\r\nthe same and then laying a cloth over the pad and allowing it to\r\nstand long enough for the clay to absorb the glycerine, after\r\nwhich it is ready for use.\r\n\r\nThe original copy is written with a copying pencil or typewritten\r\nthrough a hectograph ribbon. A sheet of newspaper is laid upon the\r\npad and a round stick or pencil is passed over it to make the\r\nsurface level and smooth. Remove the newspaper and place the\r\noriginal copy face down on the leveled surface and smooth it out\r\nin the same way so that every part touches the pad. Remove the\r\ncopy in about five minutes and place the clean sheets of paper one\r\nafter another on the surface and remove them. From 50 to 75 copies\r\nof the original can be made in a short time.\r\n\r\nThis compound is impervious to water, so the negative print is\r\nremoved by simply washing with a damp sponge, the same as removing\r\nwriting from a slate. This makes it possible to place another\r\noriginal on the pad immediately without waiting for the ink to\r\nvanish by chemical action as in the original hectograph.\r\n\r\nThe action of the weather has no effect upon this compound and it\r\nis proof against accident, for the tray may be dropped and the pad\r\ndented or cut into pieces, and the clay can be pressed back and\r\nleveled. The only caution is to keep it covered with a cloth\r\nsaturated in glycerine while not in use.\r\n--Contributed by A. A.

The siphon is made\r\nof glass tubes, the longer pieces being bent on one end as shown.\r\nThe air receiver and regulating device are attached to the top end\r\nof the lower tube, as shown in Fig. 2. The receiver or air inlet\r\nis the most important part. It is made of a glass tube, 3/4 in. in\r\ndiameter and 5 in. long. A hole is filed or blown through one side\r\nof the glass for the admission of air. The ends of the smaller\r\nglass\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG.1  FIG.2  Forcing Air Through Water]\r\n\r\ntubes are passed through corks having a diameter to fit the ends\r\nof this larger tube. The ends of these tubes should be so adjusted\r\nthat the continuous drops of water from the upper will fall into\r\nthe tube below. The succession of air bubbles thus imprisoned are\r\ndriven down the tube and into the tank below.\r\n\r\nThe regulator is placed in the tube or siphon above the air\r\nreceiver. Its purpose is to retard the flow of water from the\r\nsiphon above and make it drop rapidly. It consists of a rubber\r\nconnecting tube with two flat pieces of wood clamped over the\r\ncenter and adjusted with screws. The apparatus is started by\r\nclamping the rubber tube tightly and then exhausting the air in\r\nthe siphon tube, then placing the end in the upper reservoir and\r\nreleasing the clamp until the water begins to drop. If the\r\nreservoir is kept filled from the tank, the device will work for\r\nan indefinite time.\r\n--Contributed by John T. Dunlop, Shettleston, Scotland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Imitation Arms and Armor-Part II [242]\r\n\r\nImitation swords, stilettos and battle-axes, put up as ornaments,\r\nwill look well if they are arranged on a shield which is hung high\r\nup on a wall of a room or hall, says the English\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG 1; FIG 2; FIG 3; Three Fifteenth Century\r\nSwords]\r\n\r\nMechanic, London. The following described arms are authentic\r\ndesigns of the original articles. A German sword of the fifteenth\r\ncentury is shown in Fig. 1. This sword is 4 ft. long with the\r\ncrossguard and blade of steel. The imitation sword is made of wood\r\nand covered with tinfoil to produce the steel color. The shape of\r\nthe sword is marked out on a piece of wood that is about 1/8 in.\r\nthick with the aid of a straightedge and pencil, allowing a little\r\nextra length on which to fasten the handle. Cut the sword out with\r\na saw and make both edges thin like a knife blade and smooth up\r\nwith sandpaper. The extra length for the handle is cut about 1 in.\r\nin width and 2 in. long. The handle is next carved and a mortise\r\ncut in one end to receive the handle end of the blade. As the\r\nhandle is to represent copper, the ornamentations can be built up\r\nof wire, string, small rope and round-headed nails, the whole\r\nfinally having a thin coat of glue worked over it with a stiff\r\nbristle brush and finished with bronze paint.\r\n\r\nThe crossbar is flat and about 1 in. in width. Cut this out of a\r\npiece of wood and make a center hole to fit over the extra length\r\non the blade, glue and put it in place. Fill the hole in the\r\nhandle with glue and put it on the blade. When the glue is\r\nthoroughly dry, remove all the surplus with a sharp knife. Sheets\r\nof tinfoil are secured for covering the blade. Cut two strips of\r\ntinfoil, one about 1/2 in. wider than the blade and the other 1/4\r\nin. narrower. Quickly cover one side of the blade with a thin coat\r\nof glue and evenly lay on and press down the narrow strip of\r\ntinfoil. Stick the wider strip on the other side in the same way,\r\nallowing equal margin of tinfoil to overlap the edges of the\r\nblade. Glue the overlapping edges and press them around on the\r\nsurface of the narrow strip. The crossguard must be covered in the\r\nsame manner as the blade. When the whole is quite dry, wipe the\r\nblade up and down several times with light strokes using a soft\r\nrag.\r\n\r\nThe sword shown in Fig. 2 is a two-handed Swiss sword about 4 ft.\r\nin length, sharp on both edges with a handle of dark wood around\r\nwhich is wound spirally a heavy piece of brass or copper wire and\r\nheld in place with round-headed brass nails. The blade and\r\ncrossbar are in imitation steel. The projecting ornament in the\r\ncenter of the crossguard may be cut from heavy pasteboard and bent\r\ninto shape, then glued on the blade as shown.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 3 is shown a claymore, or Scottish sword of the fifteenth\r\ncentury. This sword is about 4 ft. long and has a wood handle\r\nbound closely around with heavy cord. The crossbar and blade are\r\nsteel, with both edges sharp. A German poniard is shown in Fig. 4.\r\nThis weapon is about 1 ft. long, very broad, with wire or string\'\r\nbound handle, sharp edges on both sides. Another poniard of the\r\nfourteenth century is shown in Fig. 5. This weapon is also about 1\r\nft. long with wood handle and steel embossed blade. A sixteenth\r\ncentury German poniard is shown in Fig. 6. The blade and\r\nornamental crossbar is of steel, with both edges of the blade\r\nsharp. The handle is of wood. A German stiletto, sometimes called\r\ncuirass breakers, is shown in Fig. 7. This stiletto has a wood\r\nhandle, steel crossbar and blade of steel with both edges sharp.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 8 is shown a short-handled flail, which is about 2-1/2 ft.\r\nlong with a dark handle of wood, studded with brass or steel\r\nnails. A steel band is placed around the handle near the top. The\r\nimitation of the steel band is made by gluing a piece of tinfoil\r\non a strip of cardboard and tacking it to the handle. A large\r\nscrew-eye is screwed into the top of the handle. The spiked ball\r\nmay be made of wood or clay. Cover the ball with some pieces of\r\nlinen, firmly glued on. When dry, paint it a dark brown or black.\r\nA large screw-eye must be inserted in this ball, the same as used\r\non the end of the handle, and both eyes connected with a small\r\npiece of rope twisted into shape. The rope is finished by covering\r\nwith tinfoil. Some short and heavy spike-headed nails are driven\r\ninto the ball to give it the appearance shown in the illustration.\r\n\r\nA Russian knout is shown in Fig. 9. The lower half of the handle\r\nis of wood, the upper part iron or steel, which can be imitated by\r\ncovering a piece of wood that is properly shaped with tinfoil. The\r\nwhole handle can be made of wood in one piece, the lower part\r\npainted black and the upper part covered with tinfoil. A screw-eye\r\nis screwed into the upper end. A length of real iron or steel\r\nchain is used to connect the handle with the ball. The ball is\r\nmade as described in Fig. 8. The spikes in the ball are about 1\r\nin. in length. These must be cut from pieces of wood, leaving a\r\nsmall peg at the end and in the center about the size of a No. 20\r\nspike. The pegs are glued and inserted into holes drilled into the\r\nball.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 10 is shown a Sclavonic horseman\'s battle-axe which has a\r\nhandle of wood painted dark gray or light brown; the axe is of\r\nsteel. The blade is cut from a piece of 1/4-in. wood with a\r\nkeyhole saw. The round part is made thin and sharp on the edge.\r\nThe thick hammer side of the axe is built up to the necessary\r\nthickness to cover\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ancient Weapons]\r\n\r\nthe handle by gluing on pieces of wood the same thickness as used\r\nfor the blade, and gradually shaping off to the middle of the axe\r\nby the use of a chisel, finishing with sandpaper and covering with\r\ntinfoil. Three large, round-headed brass or iron nails fixed into\r\nthe front side of the handle will complete the axe.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the sixteenth century horseman\'s battle-axes\r\nshaped as shown in Fig. 11 were used. Both handle and axe are of\r\nsteel. This axe is made similar to the one described in Fig. 10.\r\nWhen the woodwork is finished the handle and axe are covered with\r\ntinfoil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Round Belt Without Ends [243]\r\n\r\nA very good belt may be made by laying several strands of strong\r\ncord, such as braided fishline, together as shown in Fig. 1 and\r\nwrapping them as\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Method of Forming the Belt]\r\n\r\nshown in Fig. 2. When wrapped all the way around, the ends are\r\ntied and cut off. This will make a very good flexible belt; will\r\npull where other belts slip, and as the tension members are all\r\nprotected from wear, will last until the wrapping member is worn\r\nthrough without being weakened.\r\n--Contributed by E. W. Davis, Chicago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Old-Time Magic - The Growing Flower [244]\r\n\r\nThis trick is performed with a wide-mouthed jar which is about 10\r\nin. high. If an earthern jar of this kind is not at hand, use a\r\nglass fruit jar and cover it with black cloth or paper, so the\r\ncontents cannot be seen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Flower Grows Instantly]\r\n\r\nTwo pieces of wire are bent as shown in Fig. 1 and put together as\r\nin Fig. 2. These wires are put in the jar, about one-third the way\r\ndown from the top, with the circle centrally located. The wires\r\ncan be held in place by carefully bending the ends, or using small\r\nwedges of wood.\r\n\r\nCut a wire shorter in length than the height of the jar and tie a\r\nrose or several flowers on one end. Put a cork in the bottom of\r\nthe jar and stick the opposite end of the wire from where the\r\nflowers are tied through the circle of the two wires and into the\r\ncork. The dotted lines in Fig. 3 show the position of the wires\r\nand flowers.\r\n\r\nTo make the flowers grow in an instant, pour water into the jar at\r\none side of the wide mouth. The cork will float and carry the wire\r\nwith the flowers attached upward, causing the flowers to grow,\r\napparently, in a few seconds\' time. Do not pour in too much water\r\nto raise the flowers so far that the wire will be seen.\r\n--Contributed by A. S. Macdonald, Oakland, Calif.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Water and Wine Trick [244]\r\n\r\nThis is an interesting trick based on the chemical properties of\r\nacids and alkalies. The materials needed are: One glass pitcher,\r\nfilled with water, four glass tumblers, an acid, an alkali and\r\nsome phenolphthalein solution which can be obtained from your\r\nlocal druggist. Before the performance, add a few drops of the\r\nphenolphthalein to the water in the pitcher and rub a small\r\nquantity of the alkali solution on the sides of two of the\r\ntumblers and repeat, only using as large a quantity of the acid as\r\nwill escape notice on the remaining tumblers. Set the tumblers so\r\nyou will know which is which and proceed as follows: Take hold of\r\na prepared tumbler with the left hand and pour from the pitcher,\r\nheld in the right hand, some of the liquid. The liquid turned into\r\nthe glass will become red like wine. Set this full tumbler aside\r\nand take the pitcher in the left hand and pour some of the liquid\r\nin one of the tumblers containing the acid as it is held in the\r\nright hand. There will be no change in color. Repeat both parts in\r\nthe same order then begin to pour the liquids contained in the\r\ntumblers back into the pitcher in the order reversed and the\r\nexcess of acid will neutralize the alkali and cause it to lose its\r\ncolor and in the end the pitcher will contain a colorless liquid.\r\n--Contributed by Kenneth Weeks, Bridgeton, N.J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Cheap Nails are Expensive [244]\r\n\r\nThe life of iron shingle nails is about 6 years. An iron nail\r\ncannot be used again in putting on a new roof. Solid zinc nails\r\nlast forever and can be used as often as necessary. As zinc is\r\nmuch lighter than iron, the cost of zinc nails is only about 2-1/2\r\ntimes that of iron nails.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Cutting Lantern Slide Masks [245]\r\n\r\nIt has long been a puzzle to me why round cornered masks are\r\nalmost invariably used for lantern slides, when most works of art\r\nare included within rectangular spaces, says a correspondent of\r\nPhoto Era. Certainly the present commercial masks are in very poor\r\ntaste. The worker who wishes to make the most of every slide will\r\ndo well to cut his own masks, not only because of the fact just\r\nmentioned, but also because he can suit the size of the opening to\r\nthe requirements of each slide. Slides can be works of art just as\r\nmuch as prints; so that masking a slide becomes just as important\r\nas trimming a print, and equally worthy of individual treatment.\r\nIt is folly to give each slide a mask opening of uniform size and\r\nshape.\r\n\r\nWhen many slides are to be masked, it becomes tedious work to\r\ntreat each one separately, unless some special device is used. The\r\naccompanying drawing shows a way to mark masks which is simple,\r\npractical and costs nothing. The drawing is exactly lantern slide\r\nsize.\r\n\r\nLay the slide over such a guide and note the size of the opening\r\nbest suited to the picture. This will be determined by the\r\nintersection of the ruled lines, which are numbered for\r\nconvenience in working. If the size wanted is No. 4 for width and\r\nNo. 2 for height, place the guide over a piece of black mask paper\r\nand prick through the proper intersections with the point of a\r\npin. This outlines the desired\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Form for Marking Out Rectangular Lantern Slide\r\nMasks]\r\n\r\nopening, which may then be cut out easily with a knife and\r\nstraight edge.\r\n\r\nThe black paper from plate boxes and film rolls is excellent for\r\nmaking masks. It should be cut up in pieces 3-1/4 by 4 in. and\r\nkept ready for use at any time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Relieving the Weight of a Talking Machine Reproducer [245]\r\n\r\nToo loud reproduction from a record, the scratching noise\r\nsometimes heard and the forcing of the needle into a soft record,\r\nbecause the extension arm and reproducer are too heavy, can be\r\nremedied in the following manner: Attach a small ring to the under\r\nside of the horn and use a rubber band to lift the extending arm\r\nslightly.\r\n--Contributed by W. A. Jaquythe, Richmond, Cal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Thermometer Back in Etched Copper [246]\r\n\r\nEtching copper is not a very difficult process. Secure a sheet of\r\nNo. 16 gauge copper of the width and length\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Copper Thermometer Holder]\r\n\r\nwanted for the back of the thermometer. In the design shown the\r\nextreme width is 3-1/2 in. and the extreme length 7 in.\r\n\r\nDraw a design. The one shown is merely suggestive. The worker may\r\nchange the outline or proportions as desired. The decoration, too,\r\nmay be changed. The essential thing is to keep a space upon which\r\nto place the thermometer. This design is in what is known as\r\ntwo-part symmetry. A line is drawn down the paper and one-half of\r\nthe outline and decoration worked out. This done, the paper is\r\nfolded along the center line, a piece of carbon paper is inserted\r\nbetween the folds and the design transferred on the inner surfaces\r\nby tracing with a pencil over the half of the outline previously\r\ndrawn. Trace the design and outline upon the metal, using the\r\ncarbon paper.\r\n\r\nCut out the outline with metal shears and file the edges smooth.\r\n\r\nWith a small brush and ordinary asphaltum or black varnish, paint\r\nthe design, the margin and the entire back of the metal. When this\r\ncoat has dried put on a second and then a third. The asphaltum is\r\nto keep the acid into which the metal is to be immersed later from\r\neating any part of the metal but the background. Two coats or more\r\nare needed to withstand the action of the acid.\r\n\r\nThe acid bath is composed of nitric acid and water, about half and\r\nhalf, or, possibly, a little less acid than water, the mixture\r\nbeing made by pouring the acid into the water, not the water into\r\nthe acid, which is dangerous. Keep this solution off the hands and\r\nclothes, and do not inhale the fumes.\r\n\r\nPut the asphalt-coated metal in the bath and allow it to remain\r\nfor four or five hours, depending upon the thickness of the metal\r\nand the strength of the acid. With a stick, or a pair of old\r\ntongs, take the metal out of the acid occasionally and examine it\r\nto see how deep the acid has eaten it--1/32 in. is about right for\r\nthe No. 16 gauge.\r\n\r\nWhen etched to the desired depth, remove the piece and with an old\r\nknife\' scrape off the asphaltum. Finish the cleaning by scrubbing\r\nwith turpentine and a brush having stiff bristles.\r\n\r\nIf the metal is first covered with turpentine and then heated over\r\na flame, all the colors of the rainbow will appear on its surface.\r\nThese colors fade away in the course of a long time, but they can\r\nbe easily revived. Another way to get these colors is to heat the\r\nmetal and then plunge it into the acid bath quickly.\r\n\r\nA green finish is obtained by painting the background with an acid\r\nstain composed as follows: 1 part ammonia muriate; 3 parts ammonia\r\ncarbonate; 24 parts water. If one coat does not give the depth of\r\ncolor desired, repeat as many times as is necessary, allowing each\r\ncoat time to dry before applying the next.\r\n\r\nTo "fix" this color so that it will not rub off, and to keep the\r\nmetal from tarnishing, apply a coat of banana oil or lacquer.\r\n\r\nThermometers of suitable size can be bought in either brass or\r\nnickel. They have holes through their top and bottom ends through\r\nwhich metal paper fasteners can be inserted, and these in turn put\r\nthrough holes punched in the copper back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** To Make an Electric Piano [247]\r\n\r\nMake or buy a table, about 3 ft. long and 1 ft. or more wide, and\r\nabout 2-1/2 ft. high. Nail a board, A, Fig. 1, about 8 in. wide\r\nand of the same length as the table, to the table, as shown in the\r\nillustration. Paint the table any color desired.\r\n\r\nPurchase a dozen or so battery electric bells (they are cheaper if\r\nbought by the dozen) and screw them to the board, as in Fig. 2.\r\nArrange the bells in the scale shown at B, Fig. 2. Bore two holes\r\nnear the posts of each bell for the wires to pass through.\r\n\r\nButtons for the bells may be purchased, but it is cheaper to make\r\nthem in the following way: Take a piece of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: How the Electric Piano is Constructed]\r\n\r\nwood and cut it round, about 2-1/2 in. in diameter and 1/4 in.\r\nthick, Fig. 3, and bore two holes, C and D, through it. Then get\r\ntwo posts, about 1 in. long, (battery posts will do) and put them\r\nthrough the holes as in Fig. 4. Cut out a piece of tin, 3/8 in.\r\nwide, punch a hole through it and put in under post E, so that\r\nwhen it is pressed down, it will touch post F. It may be either\r\nnailed or screwed down.\r\n\r\nMake two holes in the table for each button and its wires, as at\r\nH, Fig. 2. Nail or screw the buttons to the table, as shown in\r\nFig. 5, with the wires underneath. The connections are simple: I,\r\nFig. 5, is a wire running from one end of the table to the other\r\nend, attached to a post at each end; J is another wire attached in\r\nthe same way; L is the carbon wire running from the batteries to\r\nI; M is the zinc wire running from the batteries to wire J; 0\r\nindicates the batteries; P is a wire running from J to one post of\r\na button; Q is another wire running from the other post of the\r\nbutton to one of the posts of the bell; R is a wire running from I\r\nto one post of the bell. When the button S is pressed, the bell\r\nwill ring. Each button should be connected with its bell in the\r\nsame way.\r\n--Contributed by Vincent de Ybarrondo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Imitation Arms and Armor - PART III [248]\r\n\r\nMaces and battle-axes patterned after and made in imitation of the\r\nancient weapons which were used from the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ancient Weapons]\r\n\r\nfourteenth to the sixteenth century produce fine ornaments for the\r\nhall or den, says the English Mechanic. The imitation articles are\r\nmade of wood, the steel parts represented by tinfoil stuck on with\r\nglue and the ornaments carved out with a carving tool.\r\n\r\nAn English mace used about the middle of the fifteenth century is\r\nshown in Fig. 1. The entire length of this weapon is about 24 in.;\r\nthe handle is round with a four-sided sharp spike extending out\r\nfrom the points of six triangular shaped wings. Cut the handle and\r\nspike from one piece of wood and glue the wings on at equal\r\ndistances apart around the base of the spike. The two bands or\r\nwings can be made by gluing two pieces of rope around the handle\r\nand fastening it with tacks. These rings can be carved out, but\r\nthey are somewhat difficult to make. After the glue is dry, remove\r\nall the surplus that has been pressed out from the joints with the\r\npoint of a sharp knife blade and then sandpaper the surface of the\r\nwood to make it smooth. Secure some tinfoil to cover the parts in\r\nimitation of steel. A thin coat of glue is quickly applied to the\r\nsurface of the wood and the tinfoil laid on evenly so there will\r\nbe no wrinkles and without making any more seams than is\r\nnecessary. The entire weapon, handle and all, is to appear as\r\nsteel.\r\n\r\nAn engraved iron mace of the fifteenth century is shown in Fig. 2.\r\nThis weapon is about 22 in. long, mounted with an eight-sided or\r\noctagonal head. It will be easier to make this mace in three\r\npieces, the octagonal head in one piece and the handle in two\r\nparts, so that the circular shield shown at the lower end of the\r\nhandle can be easily placed between the parts. The circular piece\r\nor shield can be cut from a piece of wood about 1/4 in. thick. The\r\ncircle is marked out with a compass. A hole is made through the\r\ncenter for the dowel of the two handle parts when they are put\r\ntogether. A wood peg about 2 in. long serves as the dowel. A hole\r\nis bored in the end of both handle pieces and these holes well\r\ncoated with glue, the wood peg inserted in one of them, the shield\r\nput on in place and handle parts put together and left for the\r\nglue to set. The head is fastened on the end of the handle with a\r\ndowel in the same manner as putting the handle parts together.\r\n\r\nThe head must have a pattern sketched upon each side in pencil\r\nmarks, such as ornamental scrolls, leaves, flowers, etc. These\r\nornaments must be carved out to a depth of about 1/4 in. with a\r\nsharp carving tool. If such a tool is not at hand, or the amateur\r\ncannot use it well, an excellent substitute will be found in using\r\na sharp-pointed and red-hot poker, or pieces of heavy wire heated\r\nto burn out the pattern to the desired depth. The handle also has\r\na scroll to be engraved. When the whole is finished and cleaned\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Battle Axes of the Fourteenth, Fifteenth and\r\nSixteenth Centuries]\r\n\r\nUp, it is covered with tinfoil in imitation of steel. The tinfoil\r\nshould be applied carefully, as before mentioned, and firmly\r\npressed into the engraved parts with the finger tips or thumb.\r\n\r\nA French mace used in the sixteenth century is shown in Fig. 3.\r\nThis weapon is about 22 in. long and has a wood handle covered\r\nwith dark red cloth or velvet, the lower part to have a gold or\r\nred silk cord wound around it, as shown, the whole handle finished\r\noff with small brass-headed nails. The top has six ornamental\r\ncarved wings which are cut out, fastened on the handle and covered\r\nwith tinfoil, as described in Fig. 2.\r\n\r\nFigure 4 shows a Morning Star which is about 26 in. long. The\r\nspiked ball and the four-sided and sharp-pointed spike are of\r\nsteel. The ball may be made of clay or wood and covered with\r\ntinfoil. The spikes are cut out of wood, sharp-pointed and\r\ncone-shaped, the base having a brad to stick into the ball. The\r\nwood spikes are also covered with tinfoil. The handle is of steel\r\nimitation, covered in the middle with red cloth or velvet and\r\nstudded with large-headed steel nails.\r\n\r\nA war hammer of the fifteenth century is shown in Fig. 5. Its\r\nlength is about 3 ft. The lower half of the handle is wood.\r\ncovered with red velvet, with a golden or yellow cord wound\r\nspirally over the cloth. The upper half of the handle is steel,\r\nalso, the hammer and spike. The entire handle should be made of\r\none piece, then the hammer put on the base of the spike. The spike\r\nmade with a peg in its lower end and well glued, can be firmly\r\nplaced in position by the peg fitting in a hole made for its\r\nreception in the top of the handle. Finish up the steel parts with\r\ntinfoil.\r\n\r\nThe following described weapons can be constructed of the same\r\nmaterials and built up in the same way as described in the\r\nforegoing articles: A horseman\'s short-handled battle-axe, used at\r\nthe end of the fifteenth century, is shown in Fig. 6. The handle\r\nis of wood and the axe in imitation steel. Figure 7 shows an\r\nEnglish horseman\'s battle-axe used at the beginning of the reign\r\nof Queen Elizabeth. The handle and axe both are to be shown in\r\nsteel. A German foot soldier\'s poleaxe used, at the end of the\r\nfourteenth century is shown in Fig. 8. The handle is made of dark\r\nwood and the axe covered with tinfoil. Figure 9 shows an English\r\nfoot soldier\'s jedburgh axe of the sixteenth century. The handle\r\nis of wood, studded with large brass or steel nails. The axe is\r\nshown in steel. All of these axes are about the same length.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Playing Baseball with a Pocket Knife [250]\r\n\r\nAn interesting game of baseball can be played by two persons with\r\na common pocket knife on a rainy day or in\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Positions of the Knife Indicate the Plays]\r\n\r\nthe winter time when the regular game cannot be played outdoors.\r\nThe knife is opened and loosely stuck into a board, as in Fig. 1,\r\nand with a quick upward movement of the forefinger it is thrown\r\ninto the air to fall and land in one of the positions shown. The\r\nplays are determined by the position of the knife after the fall.\r\n\r\nA foul ball is indicated by Fig. 2, the knife resting on its back.\r\nThe small blade sticking in the board which holds the handle in an\r\nupright position, as shown in Fig. 3, calls for a home run. Both\r\nblades sticking in the board (Fig. 4), a three-base hit. A\r\ntwo-base hit is made when the large blade sticks in the board,\r\nFig. 5. A one-base hit is secured when the large blade and the end\r\nof the handle touch the board as in Fig. 6. The knife falling on\r\nits side (Fig. 7) calls for one out. Each person plays until three\r\nouts have been made, then the other plays, and so on for nine\r\ninnings.\r\n--Contributed by Herbert Hahn, Chicago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Remove Paper Stuck to a Negative [250]\r\n\r\nWhen making photographic prints from a negative, sometimes a drop\r\nof moisture will cause the print to stick to the gelatine film on\r\nthe glass. Remove as much of the paper as can be readily torn off\r\nand soak the negative in a fresh hypo bath of 3 or 4 oz. hypo to 1\r\npt. of water for an hour or two. Then a little gentle rubbing with\r\nthe finger-not the finger nail will remove anything adhering to\r\nthe film. It may be found that the negative is not colored. If it\r\nis spotted at all, the negative must be washed for a few minutes\r\nand placed in a combined toning and fixing bath, which will remove\r\nthe spots in a couple of hours. The negative must be well washed\r\nafter going through the solutions to take away any trace of hypo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Old-Time Magic - A Sack Trick [251]\r\n\r\nThe magician appears accompanied by his assistant. He has a sack\r\nsimilar to a meal bag only on a large scale. The upper end of this\r\nbag is shown in Fig. 1, with the rope laced in the cloth. He then\r\nselects several people from the audience as a committee to examine\r\nthe sack to see that there is absolutely no deception whatever in\r\nits makeup. When they are satisfied that the bag or sack is all\r\nright, the magician places his assistant inside and drawing the\r\nbag around him he allows the committee to tie him up with as many\r\nknots as they choose to make, as shown in Fig. 2.\r\n\r\nThe bag with its occupant is placed in a small cabinet which the\r\ncommittee surround to see that there is no outside help. The\r\nmagician then takes his watch and shows the audience that in less\r\nthan 30 seconds his assistant will emerge from the cabinet with\r\nthe sack in his hand. This he does, the sack is again examined and\r\nfound to be the same as when it was first seen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sack Trick-Holding the Rope Inside the Bag]\r\n\r\nThe solution is when the assistant enters the bag he pulls in\r\nabout 15 in. of the rope and holds it, as shown in Fig. 3, while\r\nthe committee is tying him up. As soon as he is in the cabinet he\r\nmerely lets out the slack thus making enough room for his body to\r\npass through. When he is out of the bag he quickly unties the\r\nknots and then steps from his cabinet.\r\n--Contributed by J. F.

Members of the\r\naudience are allowed to inspect both the table and the candles.\r\n\r\nThe magician walks over to the burning candle, shades the light\r\nfor a few seconds, turns to the audience with his hands a few\r\ninches apart, showing that there is nothing between them, at the\r\nsame time saying that he has a light between his hands, invisible\r\nto them (the audience), with which he is going to light the other\r\ncandle. He then walks over to the other candle, and, in plain\r\nsight of the audience lights the candle apparently with nothing.\r\n\r\nIn reality the magician has a very fine wire in his hand which he\r\nis heating while he bends over the lighted candle, and the\r\naudience gaze on and see nothing. He turns to the other candle and\r\ntouches a grain of phosphorus that has been previously concealed\r\nin the wick with the heated wire, thus causing it to light.\r\n--Contributed by C. Brown, New York City.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Using the Sun\'s Light in a Magic Lantern [251]\r\n\r\nThe light furnished with a small magic lantern does very well for\r\nevening exhibitions, but the lantern can be used in the daytime\r\nwith good results by directing sunlight through the lens instead\r\nof using the oil lamp. A window facing the sun is selected and the\r\nshade is drawn almost down, the remaining space being covered by a\r\npiece of heavy paper. A small hole is\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Magic Lantern]\r\n\r\ncut in the paper and the lantern placed on a table in front of the\r\nhole, the lamp having been removed and the back opened. The\r\nlantern must be arranged so that the lens will be on a horizontal\r\nline with the hole in the paper. A mirror is then placed just\r\noutside of the window and at such an angle that the beam of light\r\nis thrown through the hole in the paper and the lens of the\r\nlantern.\r\n\r\nThe shades of the remaining windows are then drawn and the lantern\r\nis operated in the usual way.\r\n--Contributed by L.

The gauge consists of a piece of\r\nhard wood, 3/4 in. thick, with a width and length that will be\r\nsuitable for the size and number of drills you have on hand. Drill\r\na hole through the wood with each drill you have and place a screw\r\neye in one end to be used as a hanger. When you want to drill a\r\nhole for a pipe, bolt,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Drill Gauge]\r\n\r\nscrew, etc., you take the gauge and find what size drill must be\r\nused in drilling the hole.-Contributed by Andrew G. Thome,\r\nLouisville, Ky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Stove Polish [252]\r\n\r\nA good stove polish can be made by mixing together 1 lb. of\r\nplumbago, 4 oz. of turpentine, 4 oz. of water and 1 oz. of sugar.\r\nMix well and apply with a cloth or brush.\r\n\r\nA Home-Made Daniell Cell [252]\r\n\r\nAn effective Daniell galvanic cell may be constructed from\r\nmaterial costing very little money. A common tin tomato can with a\r\ncopper wire soldered to the top forms the jar and positive\r\nelectrode. A piece of discarded stove zinc rolled into an open\r\ncylinder of about 1-1/2-in. diameter, 5 in. long, with a copper\r\nwire soldered at one end forms the negative electrode.\r\n\r\nTo make the porous cell, roll a piece of heavy brown wrapping\r\npaper, or blotting paper, into a tube of several thicknesses,\r\nabout 5 in. long with an internal diameter of 2 in. Tie the paper\r\nfirmly to prevent unrolling and close up one end with plaster of\r\nparis 1/2 in. thick. It is well to slightly choke the tube to\r\nbetter retain the plaster. The paper used must be unsized so that\r\nthe solution scan mingle through the pores.\r\n\r\nTwo liquids are necessary for the cell. Make a strong solution in\r\na glass or wooden vessel of blue vitriol in water. Dilute some oil\r\nof vitriol (sulphuric acid) with about 12 times its measure of\r\nwater and keep in a bottle when not in use. In making up the\r\nsolution, add the acid to the water with constant stirring. Do not\r\nadd water to the acid.\r\n\r\nThe cell is charged by placing the zinc in the paper tube and both\r\nplaced into the tin can. Connect the two wires and pour the dilute\r\nacid into the porous cell around the zinc, and then immediately\r\nturn the blue vitriol solution into the can outside the paper cup.\r\n\r\nA current generates at once and metallic copper begins to deposit\r\non the inside of the can. It is best to let the action continue\r\nfor a half hour or so before putting the cell into use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Daniell Cell]\r\n\r\nSeveral hours working will be required before the film of copper\r\nbecomes sufficiently thick to protect the tin from corrosion when\r\nthe cell stands idle. For this reason it will be necessary to pour\r\nout the blue vitriol solution into another receptacle immediately\r\nafter through using, as otherwise the tin would be soon eaten full\r\nof holes. The porous cup should always be emptied after using to\r\nprevent the diffusion of the blue vitriol solution into the cup,\r\nand the paper tube must be well rinsed before putting away to dry.\r\n\r\nThis makes one of the most satisfactory battery cells on account\r\nof the constancy of its current, running for hours at a time\r\nwithout materially losing strength, and the low cost of\r\nmaintenance makes it especially adapted for amateurs\' use. Its\r\ncurrent strength is about one volt, but can be made up into any\r\nrequired voltage in series. A battery of a dozen cells should cost\r\nnot to exceed 50 cts. for the material, which will give a strong,\r\nsteady current, amply sufficient for all ordinary experimental\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nA strong solution of common salt may be used in place of the oil\r\nof vitriol in the porous cup, but is not so good.\r\n--Contributed by C.

Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Home-Made Equatorial [253]\r\nBy Harry Clark\r\n\r\nThe ordinary equatorial is designed and built for the latitude of\r\nthe observatory where it is to be used. This is necessary since\r\nthe hour axis must point to the north pole of the heavens whose\r\nelevation above the horizon is equal to the latitude of the\r\nobserver\'s station. The final adjustment of an ordinary equatorial\r\nis very tedious so that when once set up it is not to be moved.\r\nThis calls for a suitable house to protect the instrument. It has\r\nbeen the aim of the writer to build a very simple instrument for\r\namateur work which would be adjustable to any latitude, so easily\r\nset up ready for work and so portable that it need not be left out\r\nof doors from one evening until the next.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Instrument for Locating Stars]\r\n\r\nThe instrument is mounted on a tripod or piece of iron pipe\r\ncarrying a short vertical rod of 3/8-in. steel. A rectangular\r\nwooden frame with suitable bearings rotates about this shaft. The\r\nframe has also two horizontal bearings carrying a short shaft to\r\nthe end of which the frame carrying the hour axis is firmly\r\nclamped. By this arrangement of two perpendicular shafts the hour\r\naxis may be directed to any point in the heavens without care as\r\nto how the tripod or pipe is set up.\r\n\r\nThe frame for the hour axis is about 12 in. long with a bearing at\r\neach end. The shaft which it carries is 1/4-in. steel, carrying\r\nthe hour circle at one end, and at the other the frame for the\r\ndeclination axis which is similar to the other, but somewhat\r\nlighter. The declination axis is also of 1/4-in. steel, carrying\r\nat one end the declination circle and the pointer at the other.\r\n\r\nThe entire frame of the instrument is made of cherry and it will\r\nsave the builder much time if he will purchase cherry "furniture"\r\nwhich is used by printers and can be obtained from any printers\'\r\nsupply company. It is best quality wood free from imperfections in\r\nstraight strips one yard long and of a uniform width of about 5/8\r\nin. As to thickness, any multiple of 12-point (about 1/8 in.) may\r\nbe obtained, thus saving much work in fitting up joints. Fifty\r\ncents will buy enough wood for an entire instrument. All corners\r\nare carefully mortised and braced with small brass angle-pieces.\r\nThe frame is held together by small brass machine screws. After\r\nmuch experimentation with bearings, it was found best to make them\r\nin halves as metal bearings are usually made. The loose half is\r\nheld in place by guides on all four sides and is tightened by two\r\nscrews with milled nuts. A great deal of trouble was experienced\r\nin boring out the bearings until the following method was devised.\r\nOne hole was bored as well as possible. The bearing was then\r\nloosened and a bit run through it to bore the other. Finally, a\r\npiece of shafting was roughened by rolling it on a file placed in\r\nboth bearings and turned with a brace. The bearings were gradually\r\ntightened until perfectly ground.\r\n\r\nThe declination axis must be perpendicular to both the hour axis\r\nand the line of sight over the pointer. To insure this, a positive\r\nadjustment was provided. The end of the shaft is clamped in a\r\nshort block of wood by means of a bearing like the ones described.\r\nOne end of the block is hinged to the axis frame, while the other\r\nend is attached by two screws, one drawing them together, the\r\nother holding them apart. The axis is adjusted by turning these\r\nscrews. Each shaft, save the one in the pipe, is provided with\r\nthis adjustment.\r\n\r\nThe pointer is of two very thin strips placed at right angles and\r\ntapered slightly at each end. The clamp is attached as shown in\r\nthe illustration. The eye piece is a black iron washer supported\r\non a small strip of wood. The aperture should be 1/4 in., since\r\nthe pupil of the eye dilates very much in darkness. The error due\r\nto large aperture is reduced by using a very long pointer which\r\nalso makes it possible to focus the eye upon the front sight and\r\nthe star simultaneously. The forward sight is a bright brass peg\r\nilluminated by a tiny electric lamp with a reflector to shield the\r\neye. The pointer arranged in this way is a great improvement over\r\nthe hollow tube sometimes used, since it allows an unobstructed\r\nview of the heavens while indicating the exact point in question.\r\n\r\nThe circles of the instrument are of aluminum, attached to the\r\nshafts by means of wooden clamps. They were nicely graduated by a\r\nhome-made dividing engine of very simple construction, and the\r\nfigures were engraved with a pantograph. The reading is indicated\r\nby a cut on a small aluminum plate attached to a pointer. The hour\r\ncircle is divided into 24 parts and subdivided to every four\r\nminutes. The figures are arranged so that when the instrument is\r\nset up, the number of hours increases while the pointer travels\r\noppositely to the stars. The declination circle is graduated from\r\nzero to 90 deg. in each direction from two points 180 deg. apart.\r\nIt is, adjusted to read zero when the pointer and two axes are\r\nmutually perpendicular as shown in the picture.\r\n\r\nTo adjust the instrument it is set up on the iron pipe and the\r\npointer directed to some distant object. All set screws, excepting\r\nthose on the declination axis, are tightened. Then the pointer is\r\ncarefully turned through 180 deg. and if it is not again directed\r\nto the same point, it is not perpendicular to the declination\r\naxis. When properly set it will describe a great circle. With the\r\ndeclination axis in an approximately horizontal position the place\r\nwhere the pointer cuts the horizon is noted. The declination axis\r\nis then turned through 180 deg., when the pointer should again cut\r\nat the same place. Proper adjustment will cause it to do so. It is\r\ndesirable that the hour circle should read approximately zero when\r\nthe declination axis is horizontal, but this is not necessary for\r\na reason soon to be explained. All these adjustments, once\r\ncarefully made, need not be changed.\r\n\r\nIn using the instrument the hour axis can be directed to the north\r\npole by the following method. Point it approximately to the north\r\nstar. The pole is 1 deg. and 15 min. from the star on a straight\r\nline from the star to "Mizar," the star at the bend of the handle\r\nin the Big Dipper. Turn the hour circle into a position where the\r\npointer can describe a circle through "Mizar." Only a rough\r\nsetting is necessary. Now turn the pointer so that a reading of 88\r\ndeg. 45 min. shows on the declination circle on that side of 90\r\nwhich is toward "Mizar." When this is done, clamp both axes and\r\nturn the shafts in the base until the pointer is directed\r\naccurately to the north star. It is evident from a study of the\r\npicture that the position of the small pointer which indicates the\r\nreading on the hour circle is not independent of the way in which\r\nthe tripod or pipe is set up. It would then be useless to adjust\r\nit carefully to zero when the pointer cuts the "zenith" as is done\r\nwith a large equatorial. Instead, the adjustment is made by\r\nsetting the clock or watch which is part of the outfit. The\r\npointer is directed to Alpha, Cassiopiae, and the hour reading\r\nsubtracted from 24 hours (the approximate right ascension of the\r\nstar) gives the time which the clock should be set to indicate.\r\nAll of these settings should require not more than five minutes.\r\n\r\nTo find a star in the heavens, look up its declination and right\r\nascension in an atlas. Set the declination circle to its reading.\r\nSubtract the clock time from the right ascension (plus 24 if\r\nnecessary) and set the hour circle to the result. The star will\r\nthen be seen on the tip of the pointer.\r\n\r\nTo locate a known star on the map, turn the pointer to the star.\r\nDeclination is read directly. Add the clock time to the hour\r\nreading to get right ascension. If the result is more than 24\r\nhours, subtract 24.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Ground Glass Substitute [255]\r\n\r\nOrdinary plain glass coated with the following mixture will make a\r\ngood ground glass substitute: Dissolve 18 gr. of gum sandarac and\r\n4 gr. of gum mastic in 3-1/2 dr.. of ether, then add 1 2-3 dr.\r\nbenzole. If this will be too transparent, add a little more\r\nbenzole, taking care not to add too much.

These balls can be pressed together in flat\r\ndisks and put in the bag, Fig. 2. without taking up any great\r\namount of space. When the spring is released it will fill out the\r\nblack cloth to represent a cannon ball that cannot be\r\ndistinguished from the real article.\r\n--Contributed by J. F.

The chain from the dog\'s collar is\r\nfastened to the ring. This method can also be used for tethering a\r\ncow or horse, the advantage being the use of a short tie rope\r\neliminating the possibility of the animal becoming entangled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Water-Color Box [257]\r\n\r\nThere are many different trays in the market for the purpose of\r\nholding water colors, but they are either too expensive for the\r\naverage person or too small to be convenient. I do a great deal of\r\nwater-color work and always felt the need of a suitable color\r\ndish. At last I found something that filled my want and suited my\r\npocketbook. I bought 22 individual salt dishes and made a box to\r\nhold them, as shown in the illustration. This box has done good\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nSome of the advantages are: Each color is in a separate dish which\r\ncan be easily taken out and cleaned; the dishes are deep enough to\r\nprevent spilling the colors into the adjoining ones, and the box\r\ncan be made as big or as small as individual needs require. The\r\ntray containing the color dishes and brushes rests on 1/4-in.\r\nround pieces 2-1/4 in. from the bottom of the box, thus giving\r\nample store room for colors, prints, slides and extra brushes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Color Trays Made of Salt Dishes]\r\n\r\n--Contributed by B.

Put the first\r\ntub on top of the other with two narrow strips between them (Fig.\r\n2). Fill the upper tub, about three-fourths full, with well packed\r\nhorse manure, and pour water on it until it is well soaked. When\r\nthe water has percolated through into the lower tub, it is ready\r\nto use on house and garden plants and is better than plain water,\r\nas it adds both fertilizer and moisture.\r\n--Contributed by C.

The end pieces are cut in\r\ntwo at one-fourth their distance from each end, a hinge screwed to\r\nthe under side to hold them together, and a hook and eye fastened\r\non the other side to hold the parts rigid when they are in use.\r\nWhen the ends are turned under, the frame is narrow enough to be\r\neasily carried from one room to another, or placed against a wall.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Drip Shield for the Arms [258]\r\n\r\nWhen working with the hands in a pan of water, oil or other fluid,\r\nit is very disagreeable to have the liquid run down the arms, when\r\nthey are raised from the pan, often to soil the sleeves of a clean\r\ngarment. A drip shield which will stop the fluid and cause it to\r\nrun back into the pan can be easily made from a piece of sheet\r\nrubber or, if this is not available, from a piece of the inner\r\ntube of a bicycle tire. Cut a washer with the hole large enough to\r\nfit snugly about the wrist, but not so tight as to stop the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Shields for the Arms]\r\n\r\ncirculation of the blood. A pair of these shields will always come\r\nin handy.\r\n--Contributed by L. M. Eifel, Chicago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Cane Chairs [259]\r\n\r\nThere are but few households that do not have at least one or two\r\nchairs without a seat or back. The same households may have some\r\none who would enjoy recaning the chairs if he only knew how to do\r\nit, and also make considerable pin money by repairing chairs for\r\nthe neighbors. If the following directions are carried out, new\r\ncane seats and backs can easily be put in chairs where they are\r\nbroken or sagged to an uncomfortable position.\r\n\r\nThe first thing necessary is to remove the old cane. This can be\r\ndone by turning the chair upside down and, with the aid of a sharp\r\nknife or chisel, cutting the cane between the holes. After this is\r\ndone the old bottom can be pulled out. If plugs are found in any\r\nof the holes, they should be knocked out. If the beginner is in\r\ndoubt about finding which holes along any curved sides should be\r\nused for the cane running nearly parallel to the edge, he may find\r\nit to his advantage to mark the holes on the under side of the\r\nframe before removing the old cane.\r\n\r\nThe worker should be provided with a small sample of the old cane.\r\nAt any first-class hardware store a bundle of similar material may\r\nbe secured.\r\n\r\nThe cane usually comes in lengths of about 15 ft. and each bundle\r\ncontains\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Three Stages of Weaving]\r\n\r\nenough to reseat several chairs. In addition to the cane, the\r\nworker should provide himself with a piece of bacon rind, a square\r\npointed wedge, as shown in Fig. 1, and 8 or 10 round wood plugs,\r\nwhich are used for temporarily holding the ends of the cane in the\r\nholes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: First Layer of Strands]\r\n\r\nA bucket of water should be supplied in which to soak the cane\r\njust before weaving it. Several minutes before you are ready to\r\nbegin work, take four or five strands of the cane, and, after\r\nhaving doubled them up singly into convenient lengths and tied\r\neach one into a single knot, put them into the water to soak. The\r\ncane is much more pliable and is less liable to crack in bending\r\nwhen worked while wet. As fast as the soaked cane is used, more of\r\nit should be put into the water.\r\n\r\nUntie one of the strands which has been well soaked, put about 3\r\nor 4 in. down through the hole at one end of what is to be the\r\noutside strand of one side and secure it in this hole by means of\r\none of the small plugs mentioned. The plug should not be forced in\r\ntoo hard nor cut off, as it must be\r\n\r\n[Illustration: First Two Layers in Place]\r\n\r\nremoved again. The other end of the strand should be made pointed\r\nand passed down through the hole at the opposite side, and, after\r\nhaving been pulled tight, held there by inserting another plug.\r\nPass the end up through the next hole, then across and down, and\r\nhold while the second plug is moved to the last hole through which\r\nthe cane was drawn. In the same manner proceed across the chair\r\nbottom. Whenever the end of one strand is reached, it should be\r\nheld by a plug, and a new one started in the next hole as in the\r\nbeginning. No plugs should be permanently removed until another\r\nstrand of cane is through the same hole to hold the first strand\r\nin place. After laying the strands across the seat in one\r\ndirection, put in another layer at right angles and lying entirely\r\nabove the first layer. Both of these layers when in place appear\r\nas shown in one of the illustrations.\r\n\r\nAfter completing the second layer, stretch the third one, using\r\nthe same holes as for the first layer. This will make three\r\nlayers, the first being hidden by the third while the second layer\r\nis at right angles to and between the first and third. No weaving\r\nhas been done up to this time, nothing but stretching and\r\nthreading the cane through the holes. The cane will have the\r\nappearance shown in Fig. 3. The next thing to do is to start the\r\ncane across in the same direction as the second layer and begin\r\nthe weaving. The top or third layer strands should be pushed\r\ntoward the end from which the weaving starts, so that the strand\r\nbeing woven may be pushed down between the first and third layers\r\nand up again between pairs. The two first strands of the fourth\r\nlayer are shown woven in Fig. 3. During the weaving, the strands\r\nshould be lubricated with the rind of bacon to make them pass\r\nthrough with ease. Even with this lubrication, one can seldom\r\nweave more than half way across the seat with the pointed end\r\nbefore finding it advisable to pull the remainder of the strand\r\nthrough. After finishing this fourth layer of strands, it is quite\r\nprobable that each strand will be about midway between its two\r\nneighbors instead of lying close to its mate as desired, and here\r\nis where the square and pointed wedge is used. The wedge is driven\r\ndown between the proper strands to move them into place.\r\n\r\nStart at one corner and weave diagonally, as shown in Fig. 4,\r\nmaking sure that the strand will slip in between the two which\r\nform the corner of the square in each case. One more weave across\r\non the diagonal and the seat will be finished except for the\r\nbinding, as shown in Fig. 5. The binding consists of one strand\r\nthat covers the row of holes while it is held down with another\r\nstrand, a loop over the first being made every second or third\r\nhole as desired. It will be of great assistance to keep another\r\nchair with a cane bottom at hand to examine while recaning the\r\nfirst chair.\r\n--Contributed by M. R.

They were quite common in ancient times before\r\nclocks and watches were invented. At the present time they are\r\nused more as an ornamentation than as a means of measuring time,\r\nalthough they are quite accurate if properly constructed. There\r\nare several different designs of sundials, but the most common,\r\nand the one we shall describe in this article, is the horizontal\r\ndial. It consists of a flat circular table, placed firmly on a\r\nsolid pedestal and having a triangular plate of metal, Fig. 1,\r\ncalled the gnomon, rising from its center and inclined toward the\r\nmeridian line of the dial at an angle equal to the latitude of the\r\nplace where the dial is to be used. The shadow of the edge of the\r\ntriangular plate moves around the northern part of the dial from\r\nmorning to afternoon, and thus supplies a rough measurement of the\r\nhour of the day.\r\n\r\nThe style or gnomon, as it always equals the latitude of the\r\nplace, can be laid out as follows: Draw a line AB, Fig. 1, 5 in.\r\nlong and at the one end erect a perpendicular BC, the height of\r\nwhich is taken from table No. 1. It may be necessary to\r\ninterpolate for a given latitude, as for example, lat. 41\r\ndegrees-30\'. From table No. 1 lat. 42 degrees is 4.5 in. and for\r\nlat. 40 degrees, the next smallest, it is 4.2 in. Their difference\r\nis .3 in. for 2 degrees, and for 1 degrees it would be .15 in. For\r\n30\' it would be 1/2 of 1 degrees or .075 in. All added to the\r\nlesser or 40 degrees, we have 4.2+.15+.075 in.= 4.42 in. as the\r\nheight of the line BC for lat. 41 degrees-30\'. If you have a table\r\nof natural functions, the height of the line BC, or the style, is\r\nthe base (5 in. in this case) times the tangent of the degree of\r\nlatitude. Draw the line AD, and the angle BAD is the correct angle\r\nfor the style for the given\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Details of Dial]\r\n\r\nTABLE No. 1.\r\n\r\nHeight of stile in inches for a 5in. base, for various latitudes\r\n\r\n    Latitude Height  Latitude Height\r\n      25      2.33     42     4.50\r\n      26      2.44     44     4.83\r\n      27      2.55     46     5.18\r\n      28      2.66     48     5.55\r\n      30      2.89     50     5.96\r\n      32      3.12     52     6.40\r\n      34      3.37     54     6.88\r\n      36      3.63     56     7.41\r\n      38      3.91     58     8.00\r\n      40      4.20     60     8.66\r\n\r\nlatitude. Its thickness, if of metal, may be conveniently from\r\n1/8 to 1/4 in. ; or if of stone, an inch or two, or more, according\r\nto the size of the dial. Usually for neatness of appearance the\r\nback of the style is hollowed as shown. The upper edges which\r\ncast the shadows must be sharp and straight, and for this size\r\ndial (10 in. in diameter) they should be about 7-1/2 in. long.\r\n\r\nTo layout the hour circle, draw two parallel lines AB and CD,\r\nFig. 2, which will represent the base in length and thickness.\r\nDraw two semi-circles, using the points A and C as centers,\r\nwith a radius of 5 in. The points of intersection with the lines\r\nAB and CD will be the 12 o\'clock marks. A line EF drawn\r\nthrough the points A and C, and perpendicular to the base or\r\nstyle, and intersecting the semicircles, gives the 6 o\'clock\r\npoints. The point marked X is to be used as the center of the\r\ndial. The intermediate hour and half-hour lines can be plotted\r\nby using table No. 2 for given latitudes, placing them to the\r\nright or left of the 12-o\'clock points. For latitudes not given,\r\ninterpolate in the same manner as for the height of the style.\r\nThe\r\n\r\nTable NO. 2.\r\nChords in inches for a 10 in. circle Sundial.\r\n\r\nLat                 HOURS OF DAY\r\n   12-30   1   1-30   2   2-30   3   3-30  4   4-30   5   5-30\r\n   11-30  11   10-30 10   9-30   9   8-30  8   7-30   7   6-30\r\n20  .28  .56   .87  1.19 1.57  1.99  2.49 3.11  3.87 4.82 5.93\r\n30  .33  .66  1.02  1.40 1.82  2.30  2.85 3.49  4.26 5.14 6.10\r\n35  .38  .76  1.16  1.59 2.06  2.57  3.16 3.81  4.55 5.37 6.23\r\n40  .42  .85  1.30  1.77 2.27  2.82  3.42 4.07  4.79 5.55 6.32\r\n45  .46  .94  1.42  1.93 2.46  3.03  3.64 4.29  4.97 5.68 6.39\r\n50  .50 1.01  1.53  2.06 2.68  3.21  3.82 4.46  5.12 5.79 6.46\r\n55  .54 1.08  1.63  2.19 2.77  3.37  3.98 4.60  5.24 5.87 6.49\r\n60  .57 1.14  1.71  2.30 2.89  3.49  4.10 4.72  5.34 5.93 6.52\r\n\r\n1/4-hour and the 5 and 10-minute divisions may be spaced with the\'\r\neye or they may be computed.\r\n\r\nWhen placing the dial in position, care must be taken to get it\r\nperfectly level and have the style at right angles to the dial\r\nface, with its sloping side pointing to the North Pole. An\r\nordinary compass, after allowing for the declination, will enable\r\none to set the dial, or it may be set by placing it as near north\r\nand south as one may judge and comparing with a watch set at\r\nstandard time. The dial time and the watch time should agree after\r\nthe watch has been corrected for the equation of time from table\r\nNo. 3, and for the difference between standard and local time,\r\nchanging the position of the dial until an agreement is reached.\r\nSun time and standard time agree only four times a year, April 16,\r\nJune 15, Sept. 2 and Dec. 25, and on these dates the dial needs no\r\ncorrection. The corrections for the various days of the month can\r\nbe taken from Table 3. The + means that the clock is faster, and\r\nthe means that the dial is faster than the sun. Still another\r\ncorrection must be made which is constant for each given locality.\r\nStandard time is the correct time for longitude 750 New York, 900\r\nChicago, 1050 Denver and 1200 for San Francisco. Ascertain in\r\ndegrees of longitude how far your dial is east or west of the\r\nnearest standard meridian and divide this by 15, reducing the\r\nanswer to minutes and seconds, which will be the correction in\r\nminutes and seconds of time. If the dial is east of the meridian\r\nchosen, then the watch is slower; if west, it will be faster. This\r\ncorrection can be added to the values in table No. 3, making each\r\nvalue slower when it is east of the standard meridian and faster\r\nwhen it is west.\r\n\r\nThe style or gnomon with its base can be made in cement and set on\r\na cement pedestal which has sufficient base placed in the ground\r\nto make it solid.\r\n\r\nThe design of the sundial is left to the ingenuity of the maker.\r\n--Contributed by J.

The designs\r\nshown represent original arms of the sixteenth and seventeenth\r\ncenturies. As they are the genuine reproductions, each article can\r\nbe labelled with the name, adding to each piece interest and\r\nvalue, says the English Mechanic, London.\r\n\r\nEach weapon is cut from wood. The blades of the axes and the\r\ncutting edges of the swords are dressed down and finished with\r\nsandpaper and the steel parts represented by covering the wood\r\nwith tinfoil. When putting on the tinfoil, brush a thin coat of\r\nglue on the part to be covered and quickly lay on the foil. If a\r\ncutting edge is to be covered the tinfoil on one side of the blade\r\nmust overlap the edge which is pasted on the opposite side. The\r\nother side is then covered with the tinfoil of a size that will\r\nnot quite cover to the cutting edge. After laying the foil and\r\nallowing time for the glue to dry, wipe the surface with light\r\nstrokes up and down several times using a soft piece of cloth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Partisan, Fork and Halberd]\r\n\r\nA French partisan of the sixteenth century is shown in Fig. 1. The\r\nweapon is 6-1/2 ft. long with a round handle having the same\r\ncircumference for the entire length which is covered with crimson\r\ncloth or velvet and studded all over with round-headed\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Spontoon. Glaive and Voulge]\r\n\r\nbrass nails. The spear head is of steel about 15 in. long from the\r\npoint where it is attached to the handle. The widest part of the\r\nblade from spear to spear is about 8 in. The length of the tassel\r\nor fringe is about 4 in.\r\n\r\nFigure 2 shows a German military fork of the sixteenth century,\r\nthe length of which is about 5 ft. with a handle of wood bound\r\nwith heavy cord in a spiral form and the whole painted a dark\r\ncolor. The entire length of the fork from the handle to the points\r\nis about 10 in., and is coveted with tinfoil in imitation of\r\nsteel.\r\n\r\nA Swiss halberd of the sixteenth century is shown in Fig. 3. This\r\ncombination of an axe and spear is about 7 ft. long from the point\r\nof the spear to the end of the handle, which is square. The spear\r\nand axe is of steel with a handle of plain dark wood. The holes in\r\nthe axe can be bored or burned out with red-hot iron rods, the\r\nholes being about 1/4 in. in diameter.\r\n\r\nFigure 4 shows an Austrian officers\' spontoon, used about the\r\nseventeenth century. It is about 6 ft. long with a round wooden\r\nhandle. The spear head from its point to where fixed on the handle\r\nis about 9 in. long. The edges are sharp. The cross bar which runs\r\nthrough the lower end of the spear can\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Halberd. Ranseur and Lance]\r\n\r\nbe made in two pieces and glued into a hole on each side. The\r\nlength of this bar is about 5 in.

The entire length is about 6-1/2 ft. The blade is\r\nengraved steel with a length of metal work from the point of the\r\nspear to where it joins the handle or staff of about 18 in. It has\r\na round wooden handle painted black or dark brown. The engraved\r\nwork must be carved in the wood and when putting the tinfoil on,\r\npress it well into the carved depressions.\r\n\r\nFigure 6 shows a Saxon voulge of the sixteenth century, 6 ft.\r\nlong, with a round wood handle and a steel axe or blade, sharp on\r\nthe outer edge and held to the handle by two steel bands, which\r\nare a part of the axe. The bands can be made of cardboard and\r\nglued on to the wood axe. These bands can be made very strong by\r\nreinforcing the cardboard with a piece of canvas. A small curved\r\nspear point is carved from a piece of wood, covered with tinfoil\r\nand fastened on the end of the handle as shown. The band of metal\r\non the side is cut from cardboard, covered with tinfoil and\r\nfastened on with round-headed brass or steel nails.\r\n\r\nA very handsome weapon is the German halberd of the sixteenth\r\ncentury which is shown in Fig. 7. The entire length is about 6-1/2\r\nft., with a round wooden handle fitted at the lower end with a\r\nsteel ornament. The length of the spear point to the lower end\r\nwhere it joins on to the handle is 14 in. The extreme width of the\r\naxe is 16 or 17 in. The outer and inner edges of the\r\ncrescent-shaped part of the axe are sharp. This axe is cut out\r\nwith a scroll or keyhole saw and covered with tinfoil.\r\n\r\nAn Italian ranseur of the sixteenth century is shown in Fig. 8.\r\nThis weapon is about 6 ft. long with a round staff or handle. The\r\nentire length of the metal part from the point of the spear to\r\nwhere it joins the staff is 15 in. The spear is steel, sharp on\r\nthe outer edges.\r\n\r\nFigure 9 shows a tilting lance with vamplate used in tournaments\r\nin the sixteenth century.

They can be made of\r\nvarious materials, the most durable being bamboo, although beads\r\nof glass or rolled paper will produce good results. Substances\r\nsuch as straw, while readily adaptable\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bamboo and Straw Portieres]\r\n\r\nand having a neat appearance, are less durable and will quickly\r\nshow wear. The paper beads are easily made as shown in Figs. 1, 2\r\nand 3. In Figs. 1 and 2 are shown how the paper is cut tapering,\r\nand as it appears after rolling and gluing down the ends. A\r\nstraight paper bead is shown in Fig. B.\r\n\r\nThe first step is to select the kind of beads desired for\r\nstringing and then procure the hanging cord. Be sure to get a cord\r\nof such size that the beads will slip on readily and yet have the\r\nleast possible lateral movement. This is important to secure\r\nneatness. One end of each cord is tied to a round piece of wood,\r\nor in holes punched in a leather strap. Iron or brass rings can be\r\nused if desired.\r\n\r\nCut all the cords the same length, making allowance for the number\r\nof knots necessary to produce the design selected. Some designs\r\nrequire only one knot at the bottom. It is best to make a rough\r\nsketch of the design on paper. This will greatly aid the maker in\r\ncarrying on the work.\r\n\r\nWhen the main part of the screen is finished, the cross cords,\r\nused for spacing and binding the whole together, are put in place.\r\nThis is done with a needle made from a piece of small wire, as\r\nshown in Fig. 4. The cross cords are woven in as shown in Fig. 5.\r\nAs many of these cross cords can be put in as desired, and if\r\nplaced from 6 to 12 in. apart, a solid screen will be made instead\r\nof a portiere. The twisted cross cords should be of such material,\r\nand put through in such manner that they will not be readily seen.\r\nIf paper beads are used they can be colored to suit and hardened\r\nby varnishing. The first design shown is for using bamboo. The\r\ncords are knotted to hold the bamboo pieces in place. The finished\r\nportiere will resemble drawn work in cloth. Many beautiful\r\nhangings can be easily fashioned.\r\n\r\nThe second design is to be constructed with a plain ground of\r\neither straw, bamboo or rolled paper. The cords are hung upon a\r\nround stick with rings of metal to make the sliding easy.

Each side of the cut-out A was bent inward in\r\nthe shape of a letter S, in which was placed a piece of glass.\r\nFour V-shaped notches were cut, as shown at B, near the top of the\r\ncan and their points turned outward. A slit was cut in the bottom,\r\nshaped as shown at C, and the pointed ends thus formed were turned\r\nup to make a place for holding the base of a candle. A larger can\r\nwas secured and the bottom perforated. This was turned over the\r\ntop of the other can. A heavy wire was run through the\r\nperforations and a short piece of broom handle used to make a\r\nbail.\r\n--Contributed by Maurice Baudier, New Orleans, La.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** New Tires for Carpet-Sweeper Wheels [266]\r\n\r\nThe rubber tires on carpet-sweeper wheels often become so badly\r\nworn and streched that they fail to grip the carpet firmly enough\r\nto run the sweeper. To remedy this, procure some rubber tape a\r\nlittle wider than the rims of the old wheels, remove the old\r\nrubber tires and wind the tape on the rims to the proper\r\nthickness. Trim the edges with a sharp knife and rub on some chalk\r\nor soapstone powder to prevent the tape from sticking to the\r\ncarpet. A sweeper treated in this manner will work as well as a\r\nnew one.\r\n--Contributed by W. H. Shay, Newburgh, N.

The brass should be somewhat larger than the\r\ndesign.\r\n\r\nThe brass is fastened to a block of soft wood with small nails\r\ndriven through the edges. Indent the name and outline of the flag\r\nwith a small chisel with the face ground flat, about 1/16 in.\r\nwide. This should be done gradually, sinking the lines deeper and\r\ndeeper by going over them a number of times. After this is\r\nfinished, the brass is loosened from the block, turned over but\r\nnot fastened, and the whole outside of and between the letters is\r\nindented with the rounded end of a nail, giving the appearance of\r\nhammered brass.\r\n\r\nThe edges are now cut off and four holes drilled, two for the\r\nchain by which to hang the flag to the wall, and two along the\r\nside for attaching the staff. The staff is a small brass rod with\r\na knob attached to the top end.\r\n\r\nIt would be well to polish the brass at first, if the finished\r\nwork is to be\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Finished Flag]\r\n\r\nbright, as it cannot be done after the flag is completed. A coat\r\nof lacquer is applied to keep it from tarnishing. This is done by\r\nheating the brass and quickly applying a coat of shellac.\r\n--Contributed by Chas.

Unlike most\r\nclocks, the pendulum swings\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Magnetic Clock]\r\n\r\nforward and backward instead of laterally. The construction is\r\nvery simple, and the result is not only novel but well worth\r\nwhile, because one does not have to bother about winding a clock,\r\nsuch as this one, says the Scientific American.\r\n\r\nThe clock is mounted on a wooden base measuring 3-3/4 by6-1/2 in.,\r\nby 1-5/16 in. thick. Secured centrally on this base is a 1/8 by\r\n3/4-in. bar, 6 in. long and at each side of this, 5/16 in. away,\r\nis an electromagnet, 3/4 in. in diameter and 1-7/16 in. high. Two\r\nuprights, 7-1/2 in. high and 1/4 in. in diameter, are secured in\r\nthe base bar, and are connected at the top by a brass yoke piece\r\non which the clock frame is supported. Just below the yoke piece a\r\nhole is drilled in each upright to receive the pivot pins of the\r\ncrosspiece secured to the upper end of the pendulum rod. The\r\npendulum bob at the lower end is adjusted to swing just clear of\r\nthe electromagnets. Mounted at the right-hand side of the base are\r\nthree tall binding-posts, the center one being 2-3/4 in. high, and\r\nthe other two 2-5/8 in. high. Each is fitted with a piece of\r\ncopper wire provided with a small brass spring tip. These springs\r\nlie in the plane of the pendulum, which serves to swing the\r\ncentral tip first against one and then against the other of the\r\nside tips, thereby closing the circuit of first one magnet and\r\nthen the other. Each magnet attracts the pendulum until its\r\ncircuit is broken by release of the center tip, and on the return\r\nswing of the pendulum the circuit of the other magnet is similarly\r\nclosed. Thus the pendulum is kept in motion by the alternate\r\nmagnetic impulses. The clock train is taken from a standard clock\r\nand the motion of the pendulum is imparted to the escape wheel by\r\nmeans of a pawl, bearing on the latter, which is lifted at each\r\nforward stroke of the pendulum by an arm projecting forward from\r\nthe pivotal end of the pendulum rod.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Method of Joining Boards [268]\r\n\r\nThe amateur wood-worker often has trouble in joining two boards\r\ntogether so that they will fit square and tight. The accompanying\r\nsketch shows a simple and effective method of doing this. Secure a\r\nboard, A, about 12 in. wide that is perfectly flat. Fasten another\r\nboard, B, about 6 in. wide, to the first one with screws or glue.\r\nNow place the board to be joined, C, on the board B, letting it\r\nextend over the inside edge about 1 in. and fastening it to the\r\nothers with clamps at each end. Lay the plane on its side and\r\nplane the edge straight. Place the second board in the clamps in\r\nthe same manner as the first, only have the opposite side up. If\r\nthe cutting edge of the blade is not vertical, the boards planed\r\nin this manner will fit as shown in the upper sketch. In using\r\nthis method, first-class joints can be made without much trouble.\r\n--Contributed by V.

It is best to use a piece of wood cut from\r\nthe side or cover of a cigar box. A rectangular hole 3/16 in. wide\r\nand 1 in. long is cut in the wood longitudinally along its axis\r\nand 1-3/8 in. from one end, as shown at A, Fig. 1. A small notch\r\nis made with the point of a knife blade at B and notches are cut\r\nin the end of the wood as shown at C. Rubber bands are fastened in\r\nthese notches as shown in Fig. 2. The trigger, whose dimensions\r\nare given in Fig. 3, is fastened in the hole A, Fig. 1, by driving\r\na pin through the wood. The assembled parts are shown in Fig. 4.\r\n\r\nPlace the cardboard square in the nick B, attach the rubber bands\r\nand pull the trigger.

The film when in a chemical-soaked\r\ncondition is easily damaged. The tray illustrated herewith was\r\nmade for the purpose of developing plates without having to take\r\nhold of them until the bath had completed its work, the\r\nexamination being made through the plate and the bottom of the\r\ntray.\r\n\r\nA pocket is provided for the liquid developer in one end of the\r\ntray when it\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Developing Tray with Glass Bottom]\r\n\r\nis turned up in a vertical position.

The apparatus is made of a box 8 in. deep, 8 in. wide and\r\nabout 1 ft. long. A double convex lens, G, is fitted in a brass\r\ntube which should have a sliding fit in another shorter and larger\r\ntube fastened to the end of the box. A mirror, II, is set at an\r\nangle of 45 deg.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sketching Aid]\r\n\r\nin the opposite end of the box. This reflects the rays of light\r\npassing through the lens to the surface K, which may be either of\r\nground or plain glass. The lid or cover EF protects the glass and\r\nkeeps the strong light out when sketching. The inside of the box\r\nand brass tube are painted a dull black.\r\n\r\nIn use, the device is set with the lens tube directed toward the\r\nscene to be painted or sketched and the lens focused so the\r\nreflected picture will be seen in sharp detail on the glass.\r\nSelect your colors and put them on the respective colors depicted\r\non the glass.

There is no limit to\r\nthe size of the helmet, and it may be made as a model or full\r\nsized. In constructing helmets, a mass of clay of any kind that is\r\neasily workable and fairly stiff, is necessary, says the English\r\nMechanic, London. It must be kept moist and well kneaded. A large\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Making the Clay Model and Three Helmet Designs]\r\n\r\nBoard or several planks, joined closely together, on which to\r\nplace the clay, will be necessary. The size of this board will\r\ndepend on the size of the work that is intended to be modeled upon\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe way to make a helmet is described in the following method of\r\nproducing a German morion, shown in Fig. 1. This helmet has\r\nfleur-de-lis in embossed work, and on each side is a badge of the\r\ncivic regiment of the city of Munich. The side view of the helmet\r\nis shown in Fig. 1.\r\n\r\nThe clay, is put on the board and modeled into the shape shown in\r\nFig. 2. This is done with the aid of a pair of compasses, a few\r\nclay-modeling tools, and the deft use of the fingers. The\r\nfleur-de-lis are slightly raised, as in bas-relief. To aid in\r\ngetting the helmet in correct proportion on both sides, and over\r\nthe crest on top, cut out the shape from a piece of wood, as shown\r\nin Fig. 3, with a keyhole saw. This wood being passed carefully\r\nand firmly over the clay will bring it into shape, and will also\r\nshow where there may be any deficiencies in the modeling, which\r\ncan then be easily remedied by adding more clay. The cut-out\r\npattern shown in Fig. 4 is the side outline of the helmet.\r\n\r\nScraps of thin, brown, wrapping paper are put to soak in a basin\r\nof water to which has been added about a tablespoonful of size\r\nmelted and well stirred, or some thin glue, and left over night to\r\nsoak. The paper should be torn in irregular shapes about as large\r\nas the palm of the hand. After the clay model is finished, give it\r\na thin coat of oil-sweet or olive oil will answer the purpose very\r\nwell. All being ready, the clay model oiled, and the basin of\r\nsoaked paper near to hand, take, up one piece of paper at a time\r\nand very carefully place it upon the model, pressing it well on\r\nthe clay and into and around any crevices and patterns, and\r\ncontinue until the clay is completely covered.\r\n\r\nThis being done, give the paper a thin and even coating of glue,\r\nwhich must be quite hot and put on as quickly\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ancient Helmets]\r\n\r\nas possible. Put on a second layer of paper as carefully as\r\nbefore, then another coating of glue, and so on, until there are\r\nfrom four to six coats of glue and paper. When dry, the paper\r\ncoating should be quite stout and strong enough for the helmet to\r\nbe used for ornamental purposes. Before taking it off the model,\r\nwhich should be no difficult matter, owing to the clay being\r\noiled, trim off any ragged edges of paper with a sharp knife, and\r\nsmooth and finish all over with some fine sandpaper. The paper is\r\nthen given a thin coat of glue and sections of tinfoil stuck on to\r\ngive it a finished appearance. When the helmet is off the model,\r\nmake holes with a small awl at equal distances, through which to\r\ninsert some fancy brass nails, bending the points over and flat\r\nagainst the inside of the helmet.\r\n\r\nA vizor helmet is shown in Fig. 5. This helmet has a movable vizor\r\nin the front that can be lifted up, a crest on top, and around the\r\nneck a narrow gorget which rests upon the wearer\'s shoulders. The\r\nwhole helmet with the exception of the vizor, should be modeled\r\nand made in one piece. The vizor can then be made and put in place\r\nwith a brass-headed nail on each side. The oblong slits in front\r\nof the vizor must be carefully marked out with a pencil and cut\r\nthrough with a knife or chisel.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 6 is shown an Italian casque of a foot soldier of the\r\nsixteenth century. This helmet may have the appearance of being\r\nrichly engraved as shown in one-half of the drawing, or, a few\r\nlines running down, as seen in the other part of the sketch, will\r\nmake it look neat. The band is decorated with brass studs.\r\n\r\nAn Italian cabasset of the sixteenth century is shown in Fig. 7.\r\nThis helmet is elaborately decorated with fancy and round-headed\r\nnails, as shown: in the design.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 8 is shown a large bassinet with a hinged vizor which\r\ncomes very much forward, so as to allow the wearer to breathe\r\nfreely. This helmet was worn about the sixteenth century, and was\r\nprobably used for tilting and tournaments.\r\n\r\nA burgonet skull-cap of the seventeenth century is shown in Fig.\r\n9. The vizor is composed of a single bar of metal, square in\r\nshape, which slides up and down in an iron socket attached to the\r\nfront of the helmet, and is held in any position by a thumbscrew\r\nas shown in the illustration.\r\n\r\nA hole in the peak of the helmet allows it to hang in front of the\r\nwearer\'s face. This contrivance should be made of wood, the helmet\r\nto be modeled in three pieces, the skullcap, peak and lobster\r\nshell neck guard in one piece, and the ear guards in two pieces,\r\none for each side. The center of the ear guards are perforated.\r\nAll of the helmets are made in the same manner as described for\r\nFig. 1.

Punch holes in one of the pie plates, as shown in\r\nFig. 1. The two holes, E and F, are on the rim and should be\r\nexactly on a line with the hole D punched in the center. The holes\r\nB and C are about 3 in. apart and should be at equal distances\r\nfrom the center hole D. The rim of the second plate is drilled to\r\nmake two holes, AA, Fig. 2, that will match the holes E and F in\r\nthe first plate, Fig. 1. A round collar of galvanized iron, FF,\r\nFig. 4, 3 in. high, is made with a diameter to receive the first\r\nplate snugly. Two small flaps are cut and turned out and holes\r\npunched in their centers, AA, to receive screws for holding it to\r\nthe base. Two bolts are soldered in the holes E and F, Fig. 1, and\r\nused to hold the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Details of Electric Stove]\r\n\r\nrims of both plates together, when they are placed in opposite\r\npositions, as shown in Fig. 4. This will make an open space\r\nbetween the plates. The collar is then screwed to one end of the\r\nbase, as shown in Fig. 2.\r\n\r\nTwo holes are bored through the base to correspond with the holes\r\nD and A in the bottom plate. The glass tube is cut to make two\r\npieces, each 4-1/2 in. long. This can be done easily by filing a\r\nnick in the tube at the proper point and breaking it. These tubes\r\nare forced into the holes bored in the base, and, if the\r\nmeasurements are correct, should extend about 1/4 in. above the\r\ncollar. The mineral wool, JJ, Fig. 4, is then packed down inside\r\nthe collar, until it is within 1 in. of the top. This will allow\r\nthe plate, Fig. 1, to rest on the wool and the ends of the glass\r\ntubes, GG, Fig. 4, to project through the holes D and A of the\r\nplate, Fig. 1. The rim of the plate should be level with the top\r\nedge of the collar. If asbestos is used, the sheets should be cut\r\ninto disks having the same diameter as the inside of the collar,\r\nand holes cut to coincide with the holes D and A of the plate. The\r\nsmall scraps should be dampened and made into pulp to fill the\r\nspace H, Fig. 4. The plate, Fig. 1, is held to the base by two\r\nscrews which are run through the holes BC and take the position\r\nshown by DD, Fig. 4.\r\n\r\nThe two binding-posts are attached on the base at D, Fig. 2, also\r\nthe switch B and the fuse block C, holes being bored in the base\r\nto make the wire connections. The reverse side of the base, with\r\nslits cut for the wires, is shown in Fig. 3. The points marked BB\r\nare the glass tubes; AA, the holes leading to the switch; and C,\r\nthe fuse block. The wires run through the glass tubes GG, Fig. 4,\r\nare allowed to project about 1 in. for connections.\r\n\r\nThe best way to find the correct length of the resistance wire is\r\nto take a large clay or drain tile and wind the wire tightly\r\naround it, allowing a space between each turn. The tile is then\r\nset on its side with a block or brick under each end. It should\r\nnot be set on end, as the turns of the wires, when heated, will\r\nslip and come in contact with each other, causing a short circuit.\r\nWhen the tile is in place, a short piece of fuse wire is fastened\r\nto each of its two ends. A 5-ampere fuse wire is about strong\r\nenough. A connection is made to these two wires from an\r\nelectric-light socket. The wire will get hot but probably remain\r\nthe same color. If this is the case, one of the feed wires is\r\ndisconnected from the fuse wire and gradually moved farther down\r\nthe coil until a point is found where the resistance wire glows a\r\ndull red. This point marks the proper length to cut it, as the\r\nwire should not be allowed to become any hotter. If the wire gets\r\nbright hot when the current is turned on, more wire should be\r\nadded. The wire is then made into a long coil by winding it around\r\na large wire nail. The coils should be open and about 1/8 in.\r\napart.\r\n\r\nNext, the fire clay is moistened and well mixed, using care not to\r\nget it too wet. It should have the proper consistency to mould\r\nwell. The clay, II, Fig. 4, is then packed in the first plate to a\r\nheight of about 1/4 in. above the rim. While the clay is damp, one\r\nend of the coil is connected with the wire in the central glass\r\ntube, and the coil laid in a spiral winding on the damp clay, KK,\r\nand pressed into it. When this is done, the other end is connected\r\nto the wire projecting from the outer glass tube. As these\r\nconnections cannot be soldered, the ends of the wires should be\r\ntwisted closely together, so that the circuit will not become\r\nbroken. Make sure that the coils of wire do not touch each other\r\nor the top plate. The fuse wire (about 5 amperes) is put into the\r\nfuse block, and wires with a socket adapter connected to the two\r\nbinding-posts. The top plate is put in place and screwed down.\r\nThis completes the stove.\r\n\r\nIt should be set aside in a warm place for a few days to dry out\r\nthe packing. If it is not thoroughly dry, steam will form when the\r\ncurrent is applied. It should not be left heated in this\r\ncondition.

In making a lead sphere as shown in the illustration, it is\r\nnot necessary to know the method of molding. The round lead weight\r\nfor shot-putting or hammer throwing can be cast in a hollow\r\ncardboard or pressed-paper ball, sold in department and toy stores\r\nfor 10 cents. Cut a 1/2-in. hole in the ball as shown in Fig. 1\r\nand place it with the hole up in damp sand and press or tamp the\r\nsand lightly around the ball as shown in the section, Fig. 2.\r\nCover over about 1 in. deep. A wood plug inserted in the hole will\r\nprevent any sand falling inside. When the sand is tamped in and\r\nthe plug removed, it leaves a gate for the metal. Pour melted lead\r\ninto the gate until it is full, then, when cool, shake it out from\r\nthe sand and remove the charred paper. A file can be used to\r\nremove any rough places. The dry paper ball prevents any\r\nsputtering of the hot lead.\r\n--Contributed by W. A.

If a\r\nknife with a flexible blade is not used, the pie will be damaged.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Separating Pies from Pans]\r\n\r\nIf the pie pans are provided with the simple attachment shown in\r\nthe accompanying sketch, the baked dough can be separated from the\r\ntin with one revolution of the cutter. The cutter is made from a\r\npiece of heavy tin, bent to the same outline as the inside of the\r\npan and pivoted at its center.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Stretcher for Drying Photograph Prints [275]\r\n\r\nA quick and convenient way to dry prints is to place them on a\r\ncheesecloth stretcher. Such a stretcher can be made on a light\r\nwood frame, constructed of 3/4-in. square material in any size,\r\nbut 12 by 24 in. is large enough. The end pieces B are fastened on\r\ntop of the long side pieces A, and the cheesecloth C stretched and\r\ntacked over them, as shown.\r\n\r\nThe prints should be placed face up on the cloth, and the frame\r\nset near a window. If the stretcher is made in\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cloth on the Frame]\r\n\r\nthis way, the air can enter from both top and bottom, and the\r\nprints will dry rapidly. Several of these frames can be stacked\r\nand a large number of prints thus dried at the same time.\r\n--Contributed by Andrew G. Thorne, Louisville, Ky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Temporary Funnel [275]\r\n\r\nThe amateur photographer often has some solution which he desires\r\nto put into a bottle which his glass funnel will not fit, says the\r\nPhotographic Times. The funnel made by rolling up a piece of paper\r\nusually allows half of the solution to run down the outside of the\r\nbottle, thereby causing the amateur to be dubbed a "musser," A\r\nbetter way is to take an ordinary envelope and cut it off as shown\r\nby the dotted lines. Then clip a little off the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Paper Funnel]\r\n\r\npoint, open out, and you have a funnel that will not give any\r\ntrouble. It is cheap and you can afford to throw it away when\r\ndirty, thereby saving time and washing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** An Electric Engine [276]\r\n\r\nThe parts of this engine are supported on a base 3/4 in. thick, 4\r\nin. wide and 7 in. long. The upright B, Fig. 1,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Shaft Turned by Magnetism]\r\n\r\nwhich is 1/2 in. thick and 3 in. high, is secured across the base\r\nabout one-third of the distance from one end and fastened with a\r\nwood screw put through from the under side. The magnet core C is\r\nmade of a carriage bolt, 2-1/2 in. long, which is fastened in a\r\nhole in the top part of the upright B so that the end C will\r\nprotrude slightly. Before placing the bolt in the hole of the\r\nupright, slip on two cardboard washers, each 1 in. in diameter,\r\none at the head end and the other against the upright B. Wrap a\r\nthin piece of paper around the bolt between the washers and wind\r\nthe space full of No. 22 gauge magnet wire, allowing each end to\r\nproject for connections.\r\n\r\nThe driving arm D, Figs. 1 and 3, is made of a piece of soft sheet\r\niron, 1/2 in. wide and 3 in. long. A small block is fastened to\r\nthe lower end of the metal and pivoted between two uprights, 1/2\r\nin. high, which are fastened to the base. The uprights on each\r\nside of the block are better shown in Fig. 3.\r\n\r\nTwo supports, each 1/2 in. thick and 3 in. high, are fastened with\r\nscrews about half way between the end of the base and the upright\r\nB, Fig. 1. The end view of these supports is shown in Fig. 2, at\r\nGG. A 1/8-in. hole is bored through the top part of each support\r\nso they will be in a line for the axle. The axle is made of a\r\npiece of steel 1/8 in. in diameter and about 4 in. long. An offset\r\nis bent in the center, as shown, for the crank. A small flywheel\r\nis attached to one end of the shaft. The connecting rod E, Fig. 1,\r\nis made of wood and fastened to the upper end of the driving arm D\r\nwith a small screw or nail. The contact F is made of a strip of\r\ncopper, 14 in. wide. This is to open and close the circuit when\r\nthe engine is running. The connections are made as shown in Fig.\r\n1.\r\n\r\nConnect two dry cells to the binding-posts and turn the flywheel.\r\nThe current passing through the magnet pulls the driving arm\r\ntoward the bolt head, which gives the shaft a half turn. The\r\nturning of the shaft pulls the arm away from the copper piece F,\r\ncausing a break in the current. As the shaft revolves, the arm is\r\nagain brought back against the copper strip F, thus the current is\r\nbroken and applied at each revolution of the shaft. --Contributed\r\nby S. W.

Procure a box of the right size and saw it out in\r\nthe shape shown in the illustration. The apron or board in front\r\nslides on the two front ropes. The board can be raised to place\r\nthe\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Made of a Box]\r\n\r\nchild in the box and to remove him. The ropes are fastened to the\r\nbox by tying knots in their ends and driving staples over them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Clay Flower Pots Used for Bird Houses [277]\r\n\r\nA novel use of the common garden flower pot may be made by\r\nenlarging the small opening at the bottom with a pair of pliers,\r\nand carefully breaking the clay away until the opening is large\r\nenough to admit a small bird.\r\n\r\nPlace the pot, bottom side up, on a board, 3 in. wider than the\r\ndiameter of the largest pot used, and fasten it to the board with\r\nwood cleats and brass screws. Fit the cleats as close as possible\r\nto the sides of the pot. One or more pots may be used, as shown in\r\nthe sketch.\r\n\r\nThe board on which the pots are fastened is nailed or screwed to a\r\npost or pole 10 or 12 ft. in height. The board is braced with lath\r\nor similar strips of wood, making a framework suitable for a\r\nroost. In designing the roost, the lath can be arranged to make it\r\nquite attractive, or the braces may be of twigs and branches of a\r\ntree to make a rustic effect.\r\n--Contributed by William F. Stecher, Dorchester, Mass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pots Fastened to the Board]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Location of a Gas Meter [277]\r\n\r\nThe gas meter should not be located in a warm place or the gas\r\nwill expand before the meter measures it and the gas bill will be\r\nproportionately increased. Gas expands by about 1/491 part of its\r\nvolume for each deg. F. that it is heated. If the meter is warmed\r\n10 deg. F., it will make the gas cost over 2 per cent more,\r\nwithout any corresponding benefit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make Rope Grills [277]\r\n\r\nBeautiful and useful household ornaments, grills and gratings for\r\ndoors, windows, shelves, odd corners, etc., can be made by the\r\nfollowing method at a slight cost and by anyone possessing a\r\nlittle ingenuity. The materials required are rope or, preferably,\r\ncommon window cord (called sash cord) about 5/16 in. in diameter;\r\nordinary glue, paraffin and paint or varnish. A few strips of wood\r\nor molding are very handy to use around the edges.\r\n\r\nThe design must be considered first and when one is selected, if\r\nit is other than straight lines, adopt the method described.\r\n\r\nTake a smooth flat board and layout the design or designs which,\r\nwhen combined, will produce the pattern desired. Drive finishing\r\nnails at the angle points or along curves as required. Coat the\r\nboard along the lines of the patterns with melted paraffin, using\r\nan ordinary painter\'s brush to prevent the ropes from sticking to\r\nthe boards after they are soaked in glue and run around the nails.\r\n\r\nSoak the sash cord in common glue sizing for a short time, then\r\nbend or twist it along or around the lines desired, as shown in\r\nFig. 1, and give it time to dry. The bottom part of the sketch,\r\nFig. 1, shows a method of winding the rope on a round stick to\r\nmake circular objects. Wind the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2-Designs for Grills]\r\n\r\ndesired number of turns and when dry, cut and glue them together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1-Method of Forming the Rope]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 2, six designs are shown. These suggest ideas in making up\r\ncombinations or in plain figures and the number is limited only by\r\nthe ingenuity of the designer.\r\n--Contributed by Geo. M. Harrer, Lockport, N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Simple and Effective Filter [278]\r\n\r\nProcure an ordinary lamp chimney and fit two or three thicknesses\r\nof cheese cloth over the end of it. Press a tuft of absorbent\r\ncotton into the small part of the neck to a depth of about 3 in.\r\nInsert the chimney in a hole cut in a wood shelf used as a\r\nsupport. Pour the water in until the filter is filled, when it\r\nwill be observed that any organic matter, chips of iron rust,\r\netc., will be retained by the cotton. The fine organic matter may\r\npenetrate the cotton for about 1 in., but no farther. The\r\nresultant filtered water will be clear and pure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Filter]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Cutting Tools [278]\r\n\r\nThe cutting point of a tool should never be below the centers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Imitation Arms and Armor-Part VI [279]\r\n\r\nA mass of any kind of clay that is easily modeled and fairly stiff\r\nmust be prepared and kept moist and well kneaded for making the\r\nmodels over which paper is formed to make the shape of the\r\narticles illustrated in these sketches. A modeling board must be\r\nmade of one large board or several pieces joined closely together\r\nupon which to work the clay, says the English Mechanic, London.\r\nThe size of the board depends upon the size of the work to be\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Armor and Clay Models]\r\n\r\nAn open chamfron of the fifteenth century is shown in Fig. 1. This\r\npiece of horse armor, which was used in front of a horse\'s head,\r\nmakes a splendid center for a shield on which are fixed the\r\nswords, etc., and is a good piece for the amateur armorer to try\r\nhis hand on in the way of modeling in clay or papier mache work.\r\nThe opening for the animal to put his head into is semicircular,\r\nand the sides do not cover the jaws. As the main part of this\r\narmor is worn in front of the head the extreme depth is about 4\r\nin. The entire head piece must be modeled in clay with the hands,\r\nafter which it is covered with a thin and even coating of sweet or\r\npure olive oil. A day before making the clay model some pieces of\r\nthin, brown wrapping paper are torn in irregular shapes to the,\r\nsize of the palm of the hand and put to soak in a basin of water\r\nin which a tablespoonful of size has been dissolved. If size\r\ncannot be obtained from your local painter, a weak solution of\r\nglue will do equally well. All being ready, and the clay model\r\noiled, take up one piece of paper at a time and very carefully\r\nplace it on the surface of the model, pressing it on well and into\r\nand around any crevices and patterns. Continue this operation\r\nuntil the clay model is completely covered on every part. This\r\nbeing done, give the paper a thin and even coating of glue, which\r\nmust be quite hot and laid on as quickly as possible. Lay on a\r\nsecond layer of paper as carefully as before, then another coat of\r\nglue, and so on until there are five or six coats of glue and\r\npaper. When this is dry it will be strong enough for all\r\nornamental purposes. The ragged edges of the paper are trimmed off\r\nwith a sharp knife and the whole surface smoothed with fine\r\nsandpaper. Then carefully glue on sections of tinfoil to give the\r\narmor the appearance of steel. The armor is now removed from the\r\nmodel.\r\n\r\nA mitten gauntlet of the fifteenth century is shown in Fig. 2.\r\nThis can be made in one piece, with the exception of the thumb\r\nshield, which is separate. The thumb shield is attached to the\r\nthumb of an old glove which is fastened with round headed nails on\r\nthe inside of the gauntlet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Corrugated Breastplate and Former]\r\n\r\nThe part covering the wrist is a circular piece, but the back is\r\nnot necessary, as it would not be seen when the gauntlet is\r\nhanging in its place.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 3 is shown a gauntlet of the seventeenth century with\r\nseparately articulated fingers. This gauntlet may be molded in one\r\npiece, except the thumb and fingers, which must be made separately\r\nand fastened with the thumb shield to the leather glove that is\r\nattached to the inside of the gauntlet, the same as in Fig. 2.\r\n\r\nA breastplate and tassets of the sixteenth century are shown in\r\nFig. 4. The tassets are separate and attached to the front plate\r\nwith straps and buckles, as shown in the sketch. There is a belt\r\naround the waist which helps to hold the back plate on. Attached\r\nto the back of the plate would be two short straps at the\r\nshoulder. These are passed through the buckles shown at the top\r\nright and left-hand corners of the front plate. For decorative\r\npurposes the back plate need not be made, and therefore it is not\r\ndescribed. The method of making armor is the same as of making\r\nhelmets, but as larger pieces are formed it is well to use less\r\nclay owing to the bulk and weight.\r\n\r\nAn arrangement is shown in Fig. 5 to reduce the amount of clay\r\nused. This triangular-shaped support, which can be made in any\r\nsize, is placed on the modeling board or bench and covered with\r\nclay. This will make the model light and easy to move around, and\r\nwill require less clay. It is not necessary to have smooth boards;\r\nthe rougher the better, as the surface will hold the clay. The\r\nclay forms modeled up ready to receive the patches of brown paper\r\non the surface are shown in Figs. 6 and 7.\r\n\r\nA German fluted armor used at the beginning of the sixteenth\r\ncentury is shown in Fig. 8. The breastplate and tassets of this\r\narmor are supposed to be in one piece, but for convenience in\r\nmaking it will be found best to make them separately and then glue\r\nthem together after they are taken from the model. A narrow\r\nleather belt placed around the armor will cover the joint. Fluted\r\narmor takes its name from a series of corrugated grooves, 1/2 in.\r\nin depth, running down the plate. A piece of board, cut into the\r\nshape shown in Fig. 9, will be very useful for marking out the\r\nfluted lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Home-Made Hand Vise [280]\r\n\r\nA vise for holding small articles while filing can be made as\r\nshown in the illustration. The vise consists of three pieces of\r\nwood, two for the jaws and one a wedge. The hinge for connecting\r\nthe two jaws is made of four small screw eyes, two in each jaw.\r\nWhen locating the place for the screw eyes, place the two in one\r\njaw so they will fit between the two of the other jaw. Put a nail\r\nthrough the eyes when the jaws are matched together and they are\r\nready for the wedge in clamping the article to be filed.\r\n--Contributed by John G.

A hole is made through the center of the stopper large\r\nenough to admit a small brass rod. The length of this rod will be\r\ngoverned by the shape of the bottle, but 3-1/2 in. will be about\r\nright. The bottom of the rod is bent and two pieces of aluminum\r\nfoil, each about 1/4 in. wide and 1/2 in. long, are glued to it.\r\nThe two pieces of foil, fastened to the rod, are better shown in\r\nFig. 2. Fasten a polished brass ball to, the top of the rod, and\r\nthe instrument is ready for use. Place the article which you wish\r\nto test near the ball, and if it holds a\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Aluminum Foil in a Bottle]\r\n\r\nslight electrical charge, the two pieces of foil will draw\r\ntogether. If it does not hold a charge, the foils will not move.\r\n--Contributed by Ralph L. La Rue, Goshen, N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Fishing through Ice with a Tip-Up [281]\r\n\r\nThe tip-up, used for signaling the fisherman when a fish is\r\ncaught, is made of a 1/4-in. pine board, about 15 in. long, 2-1/2\r\nin. wide at one end and narrowing down to about 1 in at the other.\r\nAt a point 6 in. from the smaller end, the board should be cut\r\nslightly wider and a 1/2-in. hole bored through it. Two or three\r\nwrappings of fine copper wire may be wound around the board on\r\neach side\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tip-Up in Place]\r\n\r\nof the hole to give added strength. Both ends of the board should\r\nbe notched deeply.\r\n\r\nA long gash is cut in the ice and then a round hole is made with a\r\nchisel, as this will cut under the water without splashing. The\r\nchipped ice can be removed with a pail. A rod or round stick of\r\nwood is passed through the hole in the tip-up and placed across\r\nthe round hole, as shown in the illustration.\r\n\r\nThe fishhook is baited in the usual way and hung on a line from\r\nthe short end of the tip-up. When a fish is hooked, the other end\r\nwill tip up and signal the fisherman. Any number of holes can be\r\ncut in the ice and a tip-up used in each, thus enabling one person\r\nto take care of as many lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Home-Made Candle Holder [281]\r\n\r\nThe candlestick or holder shown in the illustration is made of an\r\nordinary tin can, such as is used for canning salmon or potted\r\nham. Three triangular cuts are made in the cover or bottom of the\r\ncan and the points turned up about the can die. The can may be\r\nbronzed, silvered, enameled or otherwise decorated, thus making it\r\nornamental as well as useful.\r\n--Contributed by Mrs. A. M. Bryan, Corsicana, Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Match Holder of Wood and Metal [282]\r\n\r\nA very simple piece of art craft work is easily made, as follows:\r\nSecure a piece of paper and upon it draw the outline and design,\r\nas indicated in the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Match Holder]\r\n\r\naccompanying sketch. The size may be made to suit the taste of the\r\nworker. A good size is 5 in. wide by 6 in. long over all. The\r\nmetal holder should be proportioned to this size, as shown.\r\n\r\nHaving completed the drawing, take a piece of thin wood, 3/8 or\r\n1/4 in. thick, and trace upon it the design and outline, using a\r\npiece of carbon paper. A couple of thumb tacks should be used to\r\nfasten the paper and design in place. Put the tacks in the lines\r\nof the design so that the holes will not show in the finished\r\npiece. Any kind of wood will do. Basswood or butternut, or even\r\npine, will do as well as the more expensive woods.\r\n\r\nNext prepare the metal holder. This may be made of brass or copper\r\nand need not be of very heavy gauge-No. 22 is plenty heavy enough.\r\nThe easiest way to get the shape of the metal is to make a paper\r\npattern of the development. The illustration shows how this will\r\nlook and the size of the parts for the back dimensioned above.\r\nTrace this shape on the metal with the carbon paper and cut it out\r\nby means of metal shears. Polish the metal, using powdered pumice\r\nand lye, then with a nail, punch the holes, through which small\r\nround-head brass screws are to be placed to hold the metal to the\r\nwood back. Carefully bend the metal to shape by placing it on the\r\nedge of a board and putting another board on top and over the\r\nlower edge so as to keep the bending true.\r\n\r\nThe wood back may be treated in quite a variety of ways. If soft\r\nwood, such as basswood or pine was used, it may be treated by\r\nburning with the pyrography outfit. If no outfit is at hand a very\r\nsatisfactory way is to take a knife and cut a very small V-shaped\r\ngroove around the design and border so as to keep the colors from\r\n"running." Next stain the leaves of the conventional plant with a\r\nlittle green wood dye and with another dye stain the petals of the\r\nflower red. Malachite and mahogany are the colors to use. Rub a\r\ncoat of weathered oil stain over the whole back and wipe dry with\r\na cloth. The green and red are barbarously brilliant when first\r\nput on, but by covering them at the same time the background is\r\ncolored brown, they are "greyed" in a most pleasing manner. When\r\nit has dried over night, put a coat or two of wax and polish over\r\nthe wood as the directions on the can suggest.\r\n\r\nThe metal holder may next be fastened in place.\r\n\r\nIf one has some insight in carving, the background might be\r\nlowered and the plant modeled, the whole being finished in linseed\r\noil. If carving is contemplated, hard woods such as cherry or\r\nmahogany should be used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Protecting the Fingers from Chemicals [283]\r\n\r\nThe finger nails and fingers may be easily protected from stains\r\nof chemicals by coating them with a wax made up as follows: Melt\r\nwhite wax in the same manner as melting glue. This may be done by\r\ncutting the wax into small pieces, placing them in a vessel and\r\nsetting the vessel in boiling water. To each ounce of melted wax\r\nthoroughly stir in 1 dr. of pure olive oil. The fingers should be\r\ndipped into the wax while it is in a liquid state. This will form\r\na coating that will permit the free use of the fingers, yet\r\nprotects the skin from the chemicals. It is useful for\r\nphotographers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Combined Turning Rings and Swings [283]\r\n\r\nThis trapeze, with rings for the large boys and a swing for the\r\nsmaller ones, can be made on the same standards. Instead of the\r\nusual two short ropes, tied and bolted through the top crosstimber\r\nbore two holes large enough for the ropes to pass through easily.\r\nPass the rope along the crosspiece and down the post and tie it to\r\ncleats nailed at a height that can be easily reached.\r\n\r\nAt the ends of the crosspiece drive two nails, allowing them to\r\nproject 1 or 2 in. This will keep the rope from slipping off when\r\nthe rings and swing are raised and lowered. All sharp edges should\r\nbe sandpapered to prevent\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rings and Swing]\r\n\r\nthe rope from being cut. A board with notches cut in the ends will\r\nmake a good swing board which can be removed instantly.\r\n--Contributed by W. A. Jaquythe, Richmond, Cal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Homemade Telegraph Key [283]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Key and Connections]\r\n\r\nA piece of wood, 1/2 in. thick, 2 in. wide and 5 in. long, is used\r\nfor the base of this instrument. Two wire nails, each 1 in. long,\r\nare used for the cores of the magnets. Each nail is wound with\r\nthree or four layers of fine insulated magnet wire, about No. 25\r\ngauge, similar to that used in electric bells, leaving about 1/4\r\nin. of the end bare so that they may be driven into the wood base.\r\nThe connections for the coils are shown in the sketch, at A.\r\n\r\nAbout 1 in. behind the coils is fastened a small block of wood,\r\nthe top of which is just even with the top of the nails in the\r\ncoils. A piece of tin, cut in the shape of the letter T, is\r\nfastened with two screws to the top of this block, and the end\r\nbent slightly so as to clear the top of the nails about 1/32 in.\r\n\r\nThe key lever is cut from a thin piece of wood, in the shape shown\r\nin the sketch, and pivoted in a slotted block which is used as a\r\nbase for the key. A piece of bare copper wire is fastened along\r\nthe under side of the key, as shown by the dotted lines. A rubber\r\nband, passing over the end of the key and attached to the base\r\nwith a tack, acts as a spring to keep the key open. A small piece\r\nof tin is fastened to the base under the knob of the key. This is\r\nfor making the contact between the copper on the key and the wires\r\nfrom the coils, when the key is pushed down.\r\n--Contributed by W. H.

All of\r\nthe parts for the armor have been described, except that for the\r\nlegs. Figure 2 shows how the armor is modeled on the side of the\r\nleft leg. The clay is modeled as described in previous chapters,\r\nthe paper covering put on, and the tinfoil applied in imitation of\r\nsteel. The chain mail seen between and behind the tassets is made\r\nby sewing small steel rings on a piece of cloth as shown in Fig.\r\n3. These rings may be purchased at a hardware store or harness\r\nshop.\r\n\r\nThe whole figure when completed is placed on a square box covered\r\nwith red or green baize. The armor should be supported by a light\r\nframe of wood built up on the inside, says the English Mechanic,\r\nLondon. Two vertical pieces are firmly attached to the box so they\r\nwill extend up inside the legs, and at the top of them is attached\r\na crosspiece on which is placed a vertical stick high enough to\r\ncarry the helmet. The two lower pieces must be built up and padded\r\nout with straw, then covered with red cloth or baize to represent\r\nthe legs.\r\n\r\nIn making up the various pieces for a full model it will be found\r\nvery convenient to use rope, a stout cord or strings in making up\r\nthe patterns on the parts. Instead of using brass-headed nails,\r\nbrass paper fasteners will be found useful. These can be purchased\r\nat a stationery store. Secure the kind having a round brass head\r\nfrom which hang two brass tongues. These are pushed through a hole\r\nand spread out flat on the opposite side. Other materials can be\r\nused in the place of tinfoil to represent steel. Silver paper will\r\ndo very well, but if either the tinfoil or silver paper are found\r\ndifficult to manipulate, go over the armor with a coat of silver\r\npaint put on with a brush. When dry give the surface a coat of\r\nvarnish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Home-Made Tripod Holder [284]\r\n\r\nAn inexpensive tripod holder, one that will prevent the tripod\r\nfrom slipping on a smooth floor, and prevent the points from doing\r\ndamage to the polished surface or puncturing an expensive rug or\r\ncarpet, can be made in a few minutes\' time, says Camera Craft.\r\n\r\nSecure two strips of wood, or ordinary plaster laths will do, and\r\nplane them down to a thickness of 3/16 in., for the sake of\r\nlightness. Cut them to a length or 40 in. and round off the ends\r\nto improve their appearance. Take the piece shown in Fig. 1 and\r\ndrill a 1/4-in. hole in the center, and eight small holes, 1 in.\r\napart, at each end. In one end of the piece, Fig. 2, make the same\r\nseries of eight small holes and, in the other end, drill six\r\n1/4-in. holes, 3 in. apart. A 1/4-in. flat headed carriage bolt,\r\nabout 1 in. long, completes the equipment.\r\n\r\nThe two pieces are bolted together, not too tight, and the points\r\nof the tripod legs inserted in their respective small holes. So\r\nset up, there is absolutely no danger of one of the legs slipping\r\nout of position. By moving the position of the bolt from, one to\r\nanother of the larger holes in the strip, Fig. 2, almost any\r\ndesired inclination of the camera can be secured.\r\n\r\nThe same sort of simple apparatus built slightly stronger, and\r\nwith a small caster under each of the three series of small holes,\r\nmakes an\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Tripod Cannot Slip]\r\n\r\nexcellent tripod clamp for use when the camera has to be shifted\r\nabout, as in portraiture and the like.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Weave a Shoestring Watch Fob [285]\r\n\r\nHaving procured a pair of ordinary shoestrings, take both ends of\r\none of them and force the ends through the middle of the other,\r\nleaving a loop 1-1/2 in. long, as shown in Fig. 2. In this sketch,\r\nA is the first string and B is the second, doubled and run through\r\nthe web of A. Take hold of the loop and turn it as shown in Fig.\r\n2, allowing the four ends to hang in four directions. Start with\r\none end, the one marked A, in Fig. 1, for instance, and lay it\r\nover the one to the right. Then take B and lay it over A, and the\r\none beneath C; lay Cover B and the one under D, and then lay D\r\nover C and stick the end under A. Then draw all four ends up\r\nsnugly. Commence the next layer by laying the end A back over B\r\nand D; D over A and C; C over D and B, then B over C and the end\r\nstuck under A. Proceed in the same manner and keep on until about\r\n1-1/2 in. of the ends remain unwoven. Four pins stuck through each\r\ncorner and into the layers will hold the ends from coming apart.\r\nThe ends of the strings are raveled out so as to make a tassel.\r\nThis will make a square fob which will appear as shown in Fig. 4.\r\n\r\nA round fob is made in a similar way, taking the same start as for\r\nthe square fob, but instead of reversing\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fobs Made from Shoestrings]\r\n\r\nthe ends of each alternate layer, always lap one string, as at A\r\nin Fig. 3. over the one to its right, as B, slipping the last end\r\nof the four strings under and tightening all, as in making the\r\nsquare fob. Fasten the ends with pins and ravel out for a tassel.\r\nThe round fob is shown in Fig. 5.\r\n\r\nA fob in the shape of a horseshoe can be made by taking four\r\nshoestrings and tying a small string around the middle of them,\r\nthen weaving the layers both ways from the point where the strings\r\nare tied. A loop, 1-1/2 in. long, is left out at the center before\r\nstarting on one side. The loop is for attaching the fob to the\r\nwatch. After the weaving is complete and the tassel ends made, a\r\nsmall stiff wire is forced through the center to form the shape of\r\na horseshoe.\r\n\r\nOther designs can be made in the same manner. Strings of different\r\ncolors will make up a very pretty fob, especially if silk strings\r\nare used.\r\n--Contributed by John P. Rupp, Monroeville, Ohio.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Table Mat of Leather [286]\r\n\r\nThe table mat, the design of which is shown herewith, is to be\r\nmade of leather. It may be made of Russian calf and the background\r\nmodeled down\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pattern for the Table Mat]\r\n\r\nas has been described in several previous articles dealing with\r\nleather work. To do this the leather is moistened on the back side\r\njust enough to make the leather take the impression of the tool,\r\nbut not enough to make the moisture show through on the face. Any\r\nsmooth piece of steel, such as a nut pick, that will not cut or\r\nscratch the leather and will make a V-shaped depression will do.\r\n\r\nA second method is to secure a piece of sheepskin and, using the\r\nreverse side, outline the design by means of a pyrographer\'s\r\noutfit. This manner of treating leather is so common that it needs\r\nno description.\r\n\r\nA third method is to secure a piece of sheep or goat skin, trace\r\nthe design on the reverse side by means of carbon paper, and put\r\nthe outline and design in with brush and stains such as are sold\r\nfor this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying pattern shows but one-fourth of the mat. Draw the\r\none-fourth on paper to the size desired and then fold on lines A\r\nand B, tracing this one-fourth on the other parts by the insertion\r\nof double-surfaced carbon paper.\r\n\r\nOn the calfskin the pattern is to be held on the leather and the\r\ntool worked over the pattern to get the outline transferred. After\r\nthis the pattern is to be removed and the leather modeled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Sad Iron Polisher [286]\r\n\r\nA small amount of wax is necessary on an iron for successful work.\r\nThe wax is usually applied by hand to the heated surface of the\r\niron. A much better and handier way is to bore five or six holes\r\nin one end of the ironing board to a depth of half\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Polisher]\r\n\r\nits thickness, filling them with wax, beeswax or paraffin, and\r\ncovering them over with two thicknesses of muslin.\r\n\r\nThe rubbing of the hot iron over this cloth absorbs just enough of\r\nthe wax to make the iron work smoothly. When the supply of wax is\r\nexhausted, it can be easily renewed.\r\n--Contributed by A. A. Houghton, Northville, Mich.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Making Coins Stick to Wood by Vacuum [287]\r\n\r\nTake a quarter and place it flat against a vertical surface of\r\nwood such\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Floating Coin]\r\n\r\nas the side of a bookcase, door facing or door panel, and strike\r\nit hard with a downward sliding motion, pressing it against the\r\nwood. Take the hand away and the coin will remain on the woodwork.\r\nThe striking and pressure expel the air between the quarter and\r\nthe wood, thus forming a vacuum sufficient to hold the coin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Simple and Safe Method for Sending Coins by Mail [287]\r\n\r\nSending coins by mail is not as a rule advisable, but sometimes it\r\n\r\n[Illustration: How the Paper is Folded]\r\n\r\nbecomes necessary, and usually a regular coin mailer is not\r\navailable. A very simple and secure way to wrap a coin or coins\r\nfor mailing is as follows: Procure a piece of heavy paper, nearly\r\nas wide as the envelope is long, and about 12 in. long. Fold on\r\nthe dotted lines shown by A and B in the sketch, and slip the coin\r\nin the pocket thus formed. Fold together on lines C, D, E and F,\r\nmaking the last two folds wide enough to fit snugly in the\r\nenvelope. This method holds the coin in the center of the envelope\r\nwhere it cannot work around and cut through the edges.\r\n--Contributed by O. J. Thompson, Petersburg, Ill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Mounting Photographs in Plaster Plaques [287]\r\n\r\nPurchase a few pounds of plaster of paris from your local druggist\r\nand select a dish of the desired shape in which to make your cast.\r\nThe size of the dish will depend on the size of the print to be\r\nmounted. Select the print you wish to mount, those on matte paper\r\nwill work best, and after wetting, place it face down in the dish,\r\npress into place and remove all drops of water with a soft cloth.\r\nBe sure and have the print in the center of the dish. Earthen\r\ndishes will be found more convenient, although tin ones can be\r\nused with good success, says Photographic Times.\r\n\r\nMix same of the plaster in clear water so it will be a little\r\nthick. Enough plaster should. be mixed to cover the bottom of the\r\ndish about 1/2 in. thick. Pour the plaster into the dish over the\r\nprint and allow to stand until it becomes quite hard. The cast can\r\nthen be removed and the print should be fast to it. If the print\r\nor plaster is inclined to stick, take a knife and gently pry\r\naround the edges and it can be removed without breaking.\r\n\r\nPrints of any size may be used by having the mold or dish large\r\nenough to leave a good margin. This is a very important point as\r\nit is the margin that adds richness to all prints. Platinum or\r\nblueprint papers work well, but any kind that will not stick may\r\nbe used. After the plaster has thoroughly dried, any tint may be\r\nworked on the margin by the use of water colors; if blueprints are\r\nused, it is best to leave a plain white margin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Iron Rest for an Ironing Board [288]\r\n\r\nA flatiron rest can be made on an ironing-board by driving a\r\nnumber of large tacks into one end of the board. The tacks should\r\nbe about 1 in. apart and driven in only part way, leaving about\r\n1/4 in. remaining above the surface of the board. The hot iron\r\nwill not burn the wood and it cannot slip off the tacks. This iron\r\nrest is always with the board and ready when wanted. --Contributed\r\nby Beatrice Oliver, New York, N.

Pour this solution slowly on top of the first in\r\nsuch a way that it forms an upper layer, without mixing the\r\nsolutions. The two solutions are then covered over with a thin\r\nlayer of boiling water and allowed to cool.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Crystallization]\r\n\r\nLower into the test tube a wire, at the extremity of which is\r\nfixed a small crystal of hyposulphite of soda. The crystal\r\ntraverses the solution of acetate without causing trouble, but\r\ncrystallization will immediately set in as soon as it touches the\r\nlower hyposulphite of soda solution, as shown at the left in the\r\nsketch.\r\n\r\nWhen the hyposulphite of soda solution becomes crystallized, lower\r\nin the upper solution a crystal of acetate of soda suspended by\r\nanother wire, as shown in the right of the sketch, and this will\r\ncrystallize the same as the other solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Decoloration of Flowers by Fumes of Sulphur [288]\r\n\r\nDissolve some sulphur in a small dish which will inflame by\r\ncontact with air thus forming sulphuric acid fumes. Cover the dish\r\nwith a conical chimney made of tin and expose to the upper opening\r\nthe flowers that are to be decolored. The action is very rapid and\r\nin a short time myrtle, violets, bell flowers, roses, etc., will\r\nbe rendered perfectly white.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Flowers]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Preserve Egg Shells [288]\r\n\r\nMany naturalists experience difficulty in preserving valuable egg\r\nshells. One of the most effective ways of preserving them is as\r\nfollows: After the egg is blown, melt common beeswax and force it\r\ninto the shell with a discarded fountain pen filler. Set in a cool\r\nplace until the wax hardens. The most delicate shells treated in\r\nthis manner can be handled without fear of breaking, and the\r\ntransparency of the wax will not alter the color, shading, or\r\ndelicate tints of the egg.\r\n--Contributed by L.

The support for the cylinder is first made and located on\r\nthe cover of the box in such a position that it will give ample\r\nroom for the motor. The motor base and the support are fastened by\r\nscrews turned up through the cover or top of the box. The location\r\nof these parts is shown in Fig. 1.\r\n\r\nThe core for holding the cylindrical wax records is 4-1/2 in. long\r\nand made of wood, turned a little tapering, the diameter at the\r\nsmall or outer end being 1-5/8 in., and at the larger end, 1-7/8\r\nin. A wood wheel with a V-shaped groove on its edge is nailed to\r\nthe larger end of the cylinder. The hole in the core is fitted\r\nwith a brass tube, driven in tightly to serve as a bearing. A rod\r\nthat will fit the brass tube, not too tightly, but which will not\r\nwobble loose, is threaded and turned into the upper end of the\r\nsupport. The core with its attached driving wheel is shown in Fig.\r\n3. The dotted lines show the brass bearing and rod axle. The end\r\nof the axle should be provided with a thread over which a washer\r\nand nut are placed, to keep the core from coming off in turning.\r\n\r\nThe sound box, Fig. 2, is about 2-1/2 in. in diameter and 1 in.\r\nthick, made of heavy tin. The diaphragm, which should be of thin\r\nferrotype tin, should be soldered to the box. The needle is made\r\nof a piece of sewing needle, about 1/8s in. long, and soldered to\r\nthe center of the diaphragm. The first point should be ground\r\nblunt, as shown in the sketch. When soldering these parts\r\ntogether, take care to have the diaphragm lie perfectly flat and\r\nnot made warping by any pressure applied while the solder is\r\ncooling.\r\n\r\nThe tin horn can be easily made, attached to the sound box with a\r\npiece of rubber hose and held so it will swing the length of the\r\nrecord by a rod attached to the top of the box, as shown.\r\n\r\nThe motor can be controlled by a small three or four-point battery\r\nrheostat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Phonograph and Construction of Parts]\r\n\r\n--Contributed by Herbert Hahn, Chicago, Ill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Substitute for a Compass [289]\r\n\r\nAn easy way to make a pencil compass when one is not at hand, is\r\nto take a knife with two blades at one end, open one to the full\r\nextent and the other only halfway.

The top part of the jug\r\nwas left uncovered as shown in the sketch, and a hole was b r 0\r\nken in it just above the ground. The boy then placed some shelled\r\ncorn in the bottom, put a board on top, and weighted it with a\r\nheavy stone.\r\n\r\nThe jug had been forgotten for several days when a farmer found\r\nit, and, wondering what it was, he raised the board and found nine\r\nfull-grown rats and four, mice in the bottom.

If desired, a tenon may be made on the bottom of each\r\nblock, as shown in Fig. 2, to fit a mortise cut in the bench.\r\nPlace the blocks far enough apart so the board to be planed will\r\nrest firmly in the notches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Notch Holds the Wood]\r\n\r\nPlane the board square first and then place it in the notches and\r\nplane the corners down to the proper dimensions.\r\n--Contributed by Willie Woolsen, Cape May Point, N.J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Letter Holder of Pierced Metal [294]\r\n\r\nThe letter holder shown in the illustration will be found\r\nconvenient for holding out-going letters that await the postman\'s\r\ncoming. It can be made of either copper or brass and need not\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Finished Letter Holder]\r\n\r\nbe of very heavy material. Gauge 22 will be sufficiently heavy.\r\nOne sheet of metal, 6 by 9-1/2 in., a board on which to work it,\r\nand an awl and hammer, will be needed. Prepare a design for the\r\nfront. If one such as is shown is to be used,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Layout for the Metal]\r\n\r\nmake one-quarter of it first, and then get the other parts by\r\nfolding on the center lines and tracing. This will insure having\r\nall parts alike. The letters can be put on afterward.\r\n\r\nFasten the metal to the board, using tacks and nailing outside of\r\nthe required space, in the waste metal. Trace the design on the\r\nmetal with carbon paper; or, if desired, paste the paper design\r\nright on the metal. With an awl pierce the metal between the\r\nmarginal line and the design, as shown. The holes should be\r\nuniform along the outlines but should be pierced promiscuously\r\notherwise. On the back, only the marginal line is to be pierced.\r\n\r\nRemove the metal, together with the paper if the latter was pasted\r\nto the metal, and trim off the surplus metal where the tacks had\r\nbeen placed. File off any sharpness so that the hand may not be\r\ninjured in handling it. Place the metal on the edge of a table or\r\nbetween two boards, and bend on the two lines indicated in the\r\ndrawing, to right angles.\r\n\r\nA good finish is obtained by just letting the copper age with its\r\nnatural color. If any polishing is required, it should be done\r\nbefore the metal is fastened to the board and pierced.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Imitating Ground Glass [294]\r\n\r\nMake a mixture of white lead in oil, 1 part; varnish, 3/4 part;\r\nturpentine, 1/4 part, and add sugar of lead as a dryer. Make a\r\nvery thin paint of this and use a broad, flat brush, says Master\r\nPainter. With care you may succeed in getting the paint on quite\r\nevenly all over, which is desirable. One coat will do. If it\r\nbecomes necessary to remove this coating for renewal, it may be\r\neffected by an application of potash lye, or the old may be\r\nrenewed by a coating of a mixture of 2 parts hydrochloric acid, 2\r\nparts white vitriol, 1 part sulphate of copper (blue vitriol) and\r\n1 part of gum arabic, applied by means of a brush.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Draw before Cutting [294]\r\n\r\nA detail drawing made of a piece of furniture before starting the\r\nwork will often save time and mistakes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Making "Spirits" Play a Violin [295]\r\n\r\nA very pretty trick, that can be worked in your own parlor, will\r\nproduce as much sensation as a fake "medium." In all appearance, a\r\nviolin, mandolin or guitar, placed on a table, will begin to\r\nproduce music simply through stamping the foot and a few passes of\r\nthe hand. The music will not sound natural, but weird and distant.\r\n\r\nThe trick is done by placing the end of a small stick on a music\r\nbox in the basement of the house and allowing the other end to\r\npass up through the floor and table top so it will project about\r\n1/16 in. The stick may be placed by the side of, behind or through\r\nthe center of a table leg. Be careful not to have any obstruction\r\nin the way of the stick. The instrument is placed sideways on the\r\nprotruding end of the stick. The "fake" work of invoking the\r\n"spirit" is performed and ended by stamping the foot, which\r\nsignals the operator in the basement to start the machine, and the\r\nviolin seemingly produces music without anyone touching it.\r\n\r\nSo impressive are the results, that many people really think the\r\nspirits of the departed are playing the violin with unseen hands.\r\nThe music is transmitted through the stick from the music box to\r\nthe violin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Music Produced by the Phonograph is Transmitted\r\nto the Viohn on the Second Floor by the Aid of a Long Stick]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Sizing a Threaded Hole [295]\r\n\r\nIt sometimes becomes necessary to transfer the size of a threaded\r\nhole from some out-of-the-way place to the shop in order to make a\r\npiece to fit it. With proper tools this is easy; without them, it\r\nmight be difficult. One thing is always at hand and that is wood.\r\nWhittle a stick tapering until it starts in the hole. Then turn it\r\ninto the hole and a fair thread will be made on the wood. The\r\nstick can be carried in the pocket without risk of changing the\r\nsize, as would be the case with ordinary calipers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Leaded-Glass Fire Screen [295]\r\n\r\nThe main frame of the fire screen shown in Fig. 1 is made from two\r\npieces of 1/2-in. square bar iron. The longest piece, which should\r\nbe about 5-1/2 ft. long, is bent square so as to form two\r\nuprights, each 28 in. long and measuring 26 in. across the top.\r\nThe bottom crosspiece can be either riveted or welded to the\r\nuprights. Two pairs of feet, each 6 in. long and spread about 8\r\nin. apart, are shaped as shown in Fig. 2. These are welded to the\r\nlower end of the uprights.\r\n\r\nThe ornamental scrollwork on the frame is simple and effective,\r\nand is easy to construct, says Work, London. The scrolls are\r\nattached to the frame by means of 3/16-in. round-head machine\r\nscrews. The leaf ornament at the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Completed Fire Screen and Parts]\r\n\r\ntermination of the scroll is shaped and embossed as shown in Fig.\r\n3. The metal used for the scrolls is 3/16 in. thick by 1/2 in.\r\nwide. The leaf ornament is formed by turning over the end of a\r\npiece of metal and working it together at a welding heat, and then\r\nshaping out the leaf with\' a chisel and files, after which they\r\nare embossed with a ballpeen hammer.\r\n\r\nThe center is made from colored glass of special make for leaded\r\nwork. The design is formed in the lead, of which a cross section\r\nis shown in Fig. 4. Use care to give the lead a symmetrical\r\noutline. The design should be drawn full size on a large sheet of\r\nheavy paper and the spaces to be occupied by the lead cut out so\r\nas to leave the exact size and shape of each piece of paper the\r\nsame as wanted for each piece of glass. These are used as patterns\r\nin marking the glass for cutting. The glass is cut the same as\r\nordinary window glass. The glass, lead, border and special flux\r\ncan be purchased from an art glass shop.\r\n\r\nAfter the glass is cut, the work of putting the pieces together\r\nwith the lead between them is begun. Secure a board as wide as the\r\nscreen--several narrow boards put together will do and begin by\r\nplacing one vertical side border, A, Fig. 5, and the base border,\r\nB, on it as shown. Place the corner piece of glass, C, in the\r\ngrooves of the borders, cut a long piece of lead, D, and hold it\r\nin place with two or three brads or glazier\'s points. The piece of\r\nlead E is cut and a small tenon joint made as shown in Fig. 6.\r\nWhile the piece of lead D, Fig. 5, is held by the brads, the piece\r\nE can be fitted and soldered. The soldering is done with a hot\r\nsoldering iron and wire solder, using rosin as a flux, or, better\r\nstill, special flux purchased for this purpose. After the joints\r\nare soldered, the piece of glass F is put in place and the lead\r\nheld with brads as before until the cross leads are fitted and\r\nsoldered. The brads are then removed, the glass piece as shown by\r\nthe dotted lines put in, and the leads around it held with brads\r\nuntil the crosspieces are put in and soldered. This method is\r\npursued until the glass is complete, then the two remaining\r\nvertical and top pieces of border are put on and all corners\r\nsoldered.\r\n\r\nThe leaded glass is held in the iron frame by means of eight\r\nU-shaped clips, as shown in Fig. 7. A hole is drilled in the frame\r\nfor the retaining screw, the latter being tapped to the base of\r\nthe clip. Special screws may be made with ornamental heads, as\r\nshown in Fig. 8, and used for securing the side scrolls and clips\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Revolving Teeter Board [297]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Details of Teeter Board ]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying sketch shows the details of a revolving teeter\r\nboard for the children\'s playground that can be constructed in a\r\nfew hours. Secure a post, not less than 4 in. square and of the\r\nlength given in the drawing, and round the corners of one end for\r\na ring. This ring can be made of 1-in. strap iron and it should be\r\nshrunk on the post. Bore a 3/4-in. hole in the end of the post for\r\nthe center pin to rest in. Make three washers 3-in. in diameter\r\nand 1/4 in. thick and drill 3/4-in. holes through their centers.\r\nDrill and countersink two smaller holes for 2-in. wood screws in\r\neach washer. Fasten one of these washers to the top of the post as\r\nshown. The post is now ready to be set in the ground. Coarse\r\ngravel should be packed tightly about it to make it solid.\r\nConcrete is much better if it can be secured.\r\n\r\nTo make the swivel you will need two 1/4 by 5 by 8-in. plates,\r\nrounded at the top as shown, and two wood blocks, A and B, each\r\n3-1/2 by 5 by 10 in. Drill the lower ends of the plates for four\r\n2-1/2-in. lag screws and the upper ends for a 5/8-in. bolt. Fasten\r\nthe plates to the block B, then drill a 3/4-in. hole as shown and\r\nfasten the two remaining washers to the block, one on each side\r\nand central with the hole. Bore a 5/8-in. hole lengthwise through\r\nthe block A for the 5/8-in. rocker bolt. This bolt should be\r\n11-1/2 in. long.\r\n\r\nThe teeter board is made of a 2 by 12-in. plank about 12 ft. long.\r\nIt should be slightly tapered from the center to the ends. Two\r\nstyles of hand holds are shown, but the one on the left is the one\r\nmost generally used. The handles are rounded at the ends and are\r\nfastened to the board with lag screws or bolts. The block A is\r\nfastened to the board with lag screws and should be a working fit\r\nbetween the wo plates where it is held by means of the 5/8-in.\r\nbolt. The center pin is 3/4-in. in diameter and about 9 in. long.\r\n--Contributed by W. H. Dreier, Jr., Camden, N.

Gymnasiums are not always available\r\nfor the average boy who likes exercise and who would like to learn\r\nthe tricks on horizontal and parallel bars, horse and rings, which\r\nall young athletes are taught in regular gymnastic courses.\r\n\r\nAny small crowd of boys--even two--having a few simple tools, a\r\nwill to use them and the small amount of money required to buy the\r\nnecessary\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Adjustable Horizontal Bar\r\n\r\nwood, bolts and rope, can make a first class gymnasium. If trees\r\nare convenient, and some one can swing an axe, the money outlay\r\nwill be almost nothing. The following plans are for material\r\npurchased from a mill squared and cut to length. To substitute\r\nsmall, straight trees for the squared timbers requires but little\r\nchanges in the plans.\r\n\r\nThe most important piece of apparatus in the gymnasium is the\r\nhorizontal bar. Most gymnasiums have two: one adjustable bar for\r\nvarious exercises and a high bar for gymnastic work. The outdoor\r\ngymnasium combines the two. The material required is as follows: 2\r\npieces of wood, 4 in. square by 9-1/2 ft. long; 4 pieces, 2 by 4\r\nin. by 2 ft. long; 4 pieces, 1 by 7 in. by 6-1/2 ft. long; 4\r\nfiller pieces, 3/4 by 3 in. by 3 ft. 9 in. long and 1 piece, 2-1/2\r\nin. square by 5 ft. 7 in. long. This latter piece is for the bar\r\nand should be of well seasoned, straight-grained hickory. It makes\r\nno difference what kind of wood is used for the other pieces, but\r\nit is best to use cedar for the heavy pieces that are set in the\r\nground as it will take years for this wood to rot. Ordinary yellow\r\npine will do very well. The four 7-in. boards should be of some\r\nhard wood if possible such as oak, hickory, maple, chestnut or\r\nash. The other material necessary consists of 2 bolts, 1/2 in. in\r\ndiameter and 7 in. long; 16 screws, 3 in. long; 4 heavy screw eyes\r\nwith two 1/2-in. shanks; 50 ft. of heavy galvanized wire: 80 ft.\r\nof 1/4-in. manila rope and 4 pulley blocks. Four cleats are also\r\nrequired but these can be made of wood at home.\r\n\r\nDraw a line on the four 7-in. boards along the side of each from\r\nend to end, 1-1/4-in. from one edge. Beginning at one end of each\r\nboard make pencil dots on this line 5 in. apart for a distance of\r\n3 ft. 4 in. Bore holes through the boards on these marks with a\r\n9/15-in. bit. Fasten two of these boards on each post with the\r\n3-in. screws, as shown in the top view of the post Fig. 1, forming\r\na channel of the edges in which the holes were bored. Two of the\r\nfiller pieces are fastened in each channel as shown, so as to make\r\nthe space fit the squared end of the bar snugly. The ends of the\r\nboards with the holes should be flush with the top of the post.\r\nThis will make each pair of holes in the 7-in. boards coincide, so\r\nthe 1/2-in. bolt can be put through them and the squared end of\r\nthe bar.\r\n\r\nSelect a level place where the apparatus is to be placed and dig\r\ntwo holes 6 ft. apart, each 3 ft. deep and remove all loose dirt.\r\nThe ends of the posts not covered with the boards are set in these\r\nholes on bricks or small stones. The channels formed by the boards\r\nmust be set facing each other with the inner surfaces of the posts\r\nparallel and 5 ft. 8 in. apart. The holes around the posts are\r\nfilled with earth and well tamped.\r\n\r\nThe hickory piece which is to form the bar should be planed,\r\nscraped and sandpapered until it is perfectly smooth and round\r\nexcept for 3 in. at each end. Bore a 9/16-in. hole through each\r\nsquare end 1-1/4 in. from the end. The bar may be fastened at any\r\ndesired height by slipping the 1/2-in. bolts through the holes\r\nbored in both the bar and channel.\r\n\r\nEach post must be well braced to keep it rigid while a person is\r\nswinging on the bar. Four anchors are placed in the ground at the\r\ncorners of an imaginary rectangle 9 by 16 ft., in the center of\r\nwhich the posts stand as shown in Fig. 2. Each anchor is made of\r\none 2-ft. piece of wood, around the center of which four strands\r\nof the heavy galvanized wire are twisted, then buried to a depth\r\nof 2 ft., the extending ends of the wires coming up to the surface\r\nat an angle.\r\n\r\nThe heavy screw eyes are turned into the posts at the top and\r\nlengths of ropes tied to each. These ropes or guys pass through\r\nthe pulley blocks, which are fastened to the projecting ends of\r\nthe anchor wire, and return to the posts where they are tied to\r\ncleats. Do not tighten the guy ropes without the bar in place, as\r\nto do so will strain the posts in the ground. Do not change the\r\nelevation of the bar without slacking up on the ropes. It takes\r\nbut little pull on the guy ropes to make them taut, and once\r\ntightened the bar will be rigid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ground Plan]\r\n\r\nOil the bar when it is finished and remove it during the winter.\r\nIt is well to oil the wood occasionally during the summer and\r\nreverse the bar at times to prevent its becoming curved. The wood\r\nparts should be well painted to protect them from the weather.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Electrostatic Illumination [299]\r\n\r\nAnyone having the use of a static machine can perform the\r\nfollowing experiment which gives a striking result. A common\r\ntumbler is mounted on a revolving\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Illuminated Tumbler]\r\n\r\nplatform and a narrow strip of tinfoil is fastened with shellac\r\nvarnish to the surface of the glass as follows: Starting beneath\r\nthe foot of the glass from a point immediately below the stem, it\r\nis taken to the edge of the foot; it follows the edge for about 1\r\nin. and then passes in a curve across the base, and ascends the\r\nstem; then it passes around the bowl in a sinuous course to the\r\nrim, which it follows for about one-third of its circumference;\r\nafter which it descends on the inside and terminates at the\r\nbottom. The tinfoil on the outside of the glass is divided by\r\ncutting with a knife every 1/8 in., the parts inside and beneath\r\nthe glass being left undivided. Current is then led from a static\r\nmachine to two terminals, one terminal being connected to one end\r\nof the tinfoil strip, and similarly the second terminal makes\r\ncontact with the other end. As soon as the current is led into the\r\napparatus, a spark is seen at each place where the knife has cut\r\nthrough the tinfoil. If the tumbler is rotated, the effect will be\r\nas shown in the illustration. A variety of small and peculiar\r\neffects can be obtained by making some of the gaps in the tinfoil\r\nlarger than others, in which case larger sparks would be produced\r\nat these points. The experiment should be carried out in a\r\ndarkened room, and under these circumstances when nothing is\r\nvisible, not even the tumbler, the effect is very striking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Balloon Ascension Illusion [300]\r\nBy C. W. Nieman\r\n\r\nIn these days of startling revelations in air-craft flight we are\r\nprepared to see any day some marvelous machine driven bird cutting\r\nfigure-eights all over the sky above our heads. One boy recently\r\ntook advantage of this state of expectancy to have an evening\'s\r\nharmless amusement, through an illusion which deceived even the\r\nmost incredulous. He caused a whole hotel-full of people to gaze\r\nopen mouthed at a sort of "Zeppelin XXIII," which skimmed along\r\nthe distant horizon, just visible against the dark evening sky,\r\ndisappearing only to reappear again, and working the whole crowd\r\nup to a frenzy of excitement. And all he used was a black thread,\r\na big piece of cardboard and a pair of field glasses.\r\n\r\nHe stretched the thread between two buildings, about 100 ft.\r\napart, in an endless belt, passing through a screweye at either\r\nend. On this thread he fastened a cardboard "cut-out" of a\r\ndirigible, not much to look at in daytime, but most deceptive at\r\ndusk. By pulling one or the other string he moved the "airship" in\r\neither direction. He took the precaution of stretching his thread\r\njust beyond a blackberry hedge and thus kept over-inquisitive\r\npersons at a safe distance. He also saw to it that there was a\r\nblack background at either end so that the reversing of the\r\ndirection of the craft would not be noticed.\r\n\r\nIn attracting the crowd he had a confederate stand looking at the\r\nmoving ship through a field glass, which at once gave the\r\nsuggestion of distance, and materially heightened the illusion.\r\nWhen the interest of the crowd, which at once gathered, was at its\r\nheight, the "aeronaut" pulled his craft out of sight and let the\r\ndisillusion come when the light of day laid bare his fraud.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Cork Extractor [300]\r\n\r\nThe device shown in the sketch is for removing a cork or stopper\r\nfrom a bottle whether full or empty where the cork has been pushed\r\ninside.

The outdoor "gym" can have a set of these bars with\r\nvery little more labor than was required for the horizontal bar.\r\n\r\nThe material required is as follows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Detail of the Parallel Bars]\r\n\r\n4 posts, preferably cedar, 4 in. square and 6 ft. long;\r\n2 base pieces, 4 in. square and 5-1/2 ft. long;\r\n2 cross braces, 2 by 4 in. by 2 ft. 2 in. long;\r\n2 side braces, 2 by 4 in. by 7 ft. 8 in. long;\r\n4 knee braces, 2 by 4 in. by 3 ft. 8 in. long;\r\n2 bars of straight grained hickory, 2 by 3 in. by 10 ft. long;\r\n4 wood screws, 6 in. long;\r\n4 bolts, 8 in. long; 8 bolts, 7 in. long and\r\n1 doz. large spikes.\r\n\r\nTo make the apparatus, lay off the bases as shown in the end view\r\nand bevel the ends at an angle of 60 deg. Chisel out two notches 4\r\nin. wide and 1 in. deep, beginning at a point 9 in. from either\r\nside of the center. These are to receive the lower ends of the\r\nposts. Bevel two sides of one end of each post down to the width\r\nof the finished bar--a little less than 2 in. Cut notches in these\r\nends to receive the oval bars. Bevel the ends of the knee braces,\r\nas shown in the diagram, and fasten the lower ends to the beveled\r\nends of the bases with the spikes. Fasten the upper ends of the\r\nknee braces to the uprights with the 8-in. bolts put through the\r\nholes bored for that purpose, and countersinking the heads. Lay\r\nthe whole end flat on the ground and make a mark 2-1/2 ft. from\r\nthe bottom of the base up along the posts, and fasten the end\r\nbraces with their top edges flush with the marks, using four of\r\nthe 7-in bolts. Finally toe-nail the base into the ends of the\r\nposts merely to hold them in position while the whole structure is\r\nbeing handled.\r\n\r\nTwo endpieces must be made. These sets or ends of the apparatus\r\nare to be buried in trenches dug to the depth of 2-1/2 ft., with\r\nthe distance between the two inner surfaces of the posts, which\r\nface each other, of 7 ft. After the trenches are dug, additional\r\nlong, shallow trenches must be made connecting the posts to\r\nreceive the side braces. The function of these side braces is to\r\nhold both ends together solidly. It is necessary to bury these\r\nbraces so they will be out of the way of the performer. The side\r\nbraces are bolted to the posts just below the cross braces, so the\r\nbolts in both will not meet. The bars are dressed down so that a\r\ncross section is oval as shown in the end view. They are to be\r\nscrewed to the notched ends of the uprights with the 6-in. screws.\r\nThe holes should be countersunk so they can be filled with putty\r\nafter the screws are in place. The bars should be well oiled with\r\nlinseed oil to protect them from the weather, and in the winter\r\nthey should be removed and stored.\r\n\r\nEvery piece of wood in this apparatus can be round and cut from\r\ntrees, except the bars. If using mill-cut lumber, leave it\r\nundressed, and if using round timber leave the bark upon it as a\r\nprotection from the weather. It is well to paint the entire\r\napparatus, save the bars, before burying the lower part of the end\r\npieces. The wood so treated will last for years, but even\r\nunpainted they are very durable. Be sure to tamp down the earth\r\nwell about the posts. A smooth piece of ground should be selected\r\non which to erect the apparatus.

A convenient article where a ladle and strainer are needed\r\nis to swing a cup-shaped strainer under the bowl of a ladle as\r\nshown in the illustration. The strainer can be held in place with\r\nsmall bands that fit loosely over the handle and a small tip\r\nsoldered to the ladle. These will allow the ladle to be turned,\r\nleaving the strainer always in position. A large sized ladle,\r\nequipped with a strainer, is just the thing for painters to dip\r\nand strain paint, while a small one is of great assistance to the\r\nhousewife for dipping and straining soups, jellies, etc.\r\n--Contributed by W.

Oil, or various cutting compounds of oil, is used for\r\nthis purpose and to keep the surface cool. If a little turpentine\r\nis added to the oil, it will greatly assist in leaving a smooth\r\nsurface. A proportion of one-quarter turpentine is good.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Center of Gravity Experiment [302]\r\n\r\nThis experiment consists of suspending a pail of water from a\r\nstick placed upon a table as shown in the accompanying sketch. In\r\norder to accomplish this experiment, which seems impossible, it is\r\nnecessary to place a stick, A, of sufficient length,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Experiment]\r\n\r\nbetween the end of the stick on the table and the bottom of the\r\npail. This makes the center of gravity somewhere near the middle\r\nof the stick on the table, thus holding the pail as shown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Lathe Accuracy [302]\r\n\r\nA heavy lathe cut will not do accurate work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** An Outdoor Gymnasium PART III-The Horse [303]\r\n\r\nThe German horse is that peculiar piece of apparatus which is\r\npartly a horizontal obstruction to leap over, partly a barrier for\r\njumps, partly a smooth surface of long and narrow dimensions over\r\nand about which the body may slide and swing, and partly an\r\nartificial back for the purpose of a peculiar style of leap frog.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The German Horse]\r\n\r\nTo make a horse for the outdoor "gym" requires no difficult work\r\nsave the preparation of the top or body of the horse. The making\r\nof the regular gymnasium horse requires a very elaborate\r\nwood-working and leather upholstering plant, but the one used for\r\noutdoor work can be made of a log of wood. Procure from a saw\r\nmill, wood yard or from the woods, one-half of a tree trunk from a\r\ntree 9 to 15 in. in diameter--the larger the better. The length\r\nmay be anywhere from 4 to 7 ft., but 5 ft. is a good length.\r\n\r\nThe round part of this log must be planed, scraped and sandpapered\r\nuntil it is perfectly smooth, and free from knots, projections and\r\nsplinters. Hand holds must be provided next. These are placed 18\r\nin. apart in a central position on the horse. Make two parallel\r\nsaw cuts 2 in. apart, straight down in the round surface of the\r\nhorse until each cut is 9 in. long. Chisel out the wood between\r\nthe cuts and in the mortises thus made insert the hand holds. Each\r\nhand hold is made of a 9-in. piece of 2 by 4-in. stud cut rounding\r\non one edge. These are well nailed in place.\r\n\r\nThe body of the horse is to be fastened on top of posts so that it\r\nmay be adjusted for height. It is not as difficult to make as the\r\nhorizontal and parallel bars. The material required is as follows:\r\nTwo posts, 4 in. square by 5 ft. long; 2 adjusting pieces, 2 by 4\r\nin. by 3 ft. 3 in. long; 1 cross brace, 2 by 4 in. by 3 ft. long;\r\n2 bases, 4 in. square by 5-1/2 ft. long; 4 knee braces, 2 by 4 in.\r\nby 3 ft. long; two 1/2-in. bolts, 1 in. long, to fasten the knee\r\nbraces at the top; ten 1/2-in. bolts, 7 in. long, 4 to fasten the\r\nknee braces at the bottom, 2 to fasten the cross brace and 4 to be\r\nused in fastening the adjusting pieces to the posts.\r\n\r\nTo construct, layout the bases as shown in the drawing, making the\r\nmortises to receive the bottom ends of the posts exactly in the\r\ncenter, and cut a slanting mortise 6 in. from each end to receive\r\nthe ends of the knee braces. Bevel the ends of the knee braces and\r\nfasten the upper ends of each pair to the post with one 9-in.\r\nbolt. Fasten the lower ends to the base with the 7-in. bolts.\r\n\r\nThe upper end of each post should have 5/8-in. holes bored through\r\nit parallel to the base at intervals of 3 in., beginning 1-1/2 in.\r\nfrom the top and extending down its length for 2 ft. 4-1/2 in. The\r\nadjusting pieces are to be bored in a similar manner after which\r\nthey are to be mortised into the under side of the horse top 15\r\nin. from each end, and secured with screws put through the top and\r\ninto the end of the adjusting pieces.\r\n\r\nThe bases with their posts and knee braces are buried 2 ft. 4 in.\r\nin the ground, parallel to each other and the same distance apart\r\nas the adjusting pieces are mortised in the horse top. When the\r\nground has been filled in and tamped hard, the cross brace should\r\nbe bolted in position with its lower edge resting on the ground\r\nand connecting the two posts.\r\n\r\nThe height of the horse from the ground is adjusted by changing\r\nthe bolts in the different holes connecting the two adjusting\r\npieces with the two posts. Much pleasant and healthful gymnastic\r\nexercise can be had in competitive horse jumping and leaping, the\r\nhandles providing a way to make many different leaps through, over\r\nand around, including not only those made to see who can go over\r\nthe horse from a standing or running start at the greatest height,\r\nbut who can go over at the greatest height when starting from the\r\n"toeing off mark" farthest away from the horse. This horse should\r\nbe located on level ground having smooth space about it for\r\nseveral feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Spoon Rest for Kettles [304]\r\n\r\nA rest for keeping spoons from slipping into kettles can be made\r\nfrom\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Spoon Rest]\r\n\r\na strip of metal bent as shown in the illustration. The spring of\r\nthe metal will make it easy to apply to the kettle. The spoon\r\nplaced in the rest will drain back into the kettle. The cover can\r\nbe placed on without removing the spoon.\r\n--Contributed by W. A. Jaquythe, Richmond. Cal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Reason for Bursting of Gun Barrels [304]\r\n\r\nGun barrels do not burst without a cause and usually that cause is\r\none of which the shooter is entirely ignorant, but nevertheless,\r\nno one is responsible but himself, says the Sporting Goods Dealer.\r\nGun barrels can only burst by having some obstruction in the\r\nbarrel or by overloading with powder. Any gun barrel can be burst\r\nby misuse or by carelessly loading smokeless powder, but no barrel\r\nwill burst by using factory loaded ammunition, provided there is\r\nno obstruction or foreign substance inside the barrel. When a gun\r\nbarrel bursts at the breech or chamber, it is caused by an\r\noverloaded shell, and when it bursts in the center or near the\r\nmuzzle, it is caused by some obstruction, such as a dent, snow,\r\nwater, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Hand Sled Made of Pipe and Fittings [305]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying sketch shows how an ordinary hand sled can be\r\nmade of 3/4-in. pipe and fittings. Each runner is made of one\r\npiece of pipe bent to the proper shape. This can be accomplished\r\nby filling the pipe with melted rosin or lead, then bending to the\r\nshape desired, and afterward removing the rosin or lead by\r\nheating. Each joint is turned up tightly and well pinned or\r\nbrazed. One of the top crosspieces should have right-hand and\r\nleft-hand threads or be fitted with a union. Also, one of the top\r\npieces connecting the rear part to the front part of each runner\r\nmust be fitted in the same way. The top is fastened to the two\r\ncrosspieces. Such a hand sled can be made in a\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Parts Made of Pipe Fittings]\r\n\r\nfew hours\' time and, when complete, is much better than a wood\r\nsled.\r\n--Contributed by James E. Noble, Toronto, Ontario.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Emergency Magnifying Glass [305]\r\n\r\nWhen in need of a microscope in the study of botany, one may be\r\nmade in the following manner: Bend a small wire or the stem of a\r\nleaf so as to form a small loop not larger than the ordinary drop\r\nof water.\r\n\r\n\r\nLoop Inclosing a Drop of Water\r\n\r\nWhen this is done place a drop of clear water in the loop and the\r\nmicroscope is complete. This temporary device will prove valuable\r\nwhere a strong magnifying glass is not at hand.\r\n--Contributed by Arthur E. Joerin, Paris, France.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Bent-Iron Pipe Rack [305]\r\n\r\nStrips of soft iron, 1/4 or 3/16 in. in width and 1/32 in.\r\nthick, are used in\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Design of a Rack]\r\n\r\nmaking the pipe rack shown in Fig. 1. This material can be\r\nobtained from any local hardware dealer who carries bar iron in\r\nstock.\r\n\r\nDraw a full-size sketch of the design on paper, then run a string\r\nover each part, which, when straightened out, will give the\r\nlength. The scrolls are bent with a pair of round-nose pliers.\r\nThese, with a pair of flat-nose pliers, are all the tools\r\nnecessary. The part for holding the pipes is shown in Fig. 2. The\r\nend elevation, at E and F, shows how the rack is fastened to the\r\nmain frame of the rack.\r\n--Contributed by J. W. Vener, Boston, Mass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** To Clean Silver [305]\r\n\r\nA good method to clean silver of any kind is to place the articles\r\nin an aluminum vessel and add a few pieces of zinc. Hot water is\r\nadded and the silver boiled until clean. It is best to use soft\r\nwater. The tarnish is removed by the electrolytic action of the\r\nzinc on the aluminum and the silver, and the latter will take on a\r\nbright luster. This method of cleaning will not injure oxidized or\r\nblack silver, nor that which is partly oxidized.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Sharpening Skates with a File [306\r\n\r\nTwo methods are shown in the sketches for filing skates-one for\r\nhollow filing and the other for filing flat\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Filing a Flat Surface]\r\n\r\nand straight across the blade. The method shown in Figs. 1 and 2\r\nis for filing the blade flat. The device for holding the skates\r\nconsists of a board on which four blocks, AA and BB, are nailed.\r\nThese blocks are fastened on the board in the relative positions\r\nof the heel and sole on a shoe. The skates are clamped on them in\r\nthe same manner as on a shoe. A flat file is drawn across both\r\nblades of the skates as shown. After the roundness is cut down on\r\nthe edges of the blades the skates are removed and the file is\r\ndrawn along the sides to remove the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Filing a Curved Surface]\r\n\r\nburr. Skates filed in this way have flat surfaces with sharp\r\nedges.\r\n\r\nSome skaters like a hollow-ground skate and the method shown in\r\nFigs. 3 and 4 can be used for filing a slightly curved surface in\r\nthe blade. A piece of tin or sheet metal is shaped over a round\r\nfile as shown in Fig. 3. The manner of filing the curves is shown\r\nin Fig. 4. The piece of metal is held over the file and blade of\r\nthe skate as the file is worked.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Lines and Letters Made with a Carpenter\'s Pencil [306]\r\n\r\nThe sketch shows some unusual work made with a carpenter\'s\r\npencil. If the flat lead is notched with a three-cornered file\r\n(Fig. 1), two parallel lines may be drawn at one stroke, or\r\nvarious rulings may be made, as shown in Fig. 2. Broad lines can\r\nbe made, as shown in Fig. 3, or unequal widths as in Fig. 4.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pencil Points and Their Work]\r\n\r\nIn Figs. 2, 5 and 6 are shown lines especially adapted for the\r\nbookkeeper or draftsman. If one lacks the ability to draw old\r\nEnglish letters with a pen, the letters may be first drawn with a\r\ncarpenter\'s pencil (Fig. 7) and the outlines marked with ink and\r\nfinally filled in. Narrow lines are made with points cut as in\r\nFigs. 8 and 9. A little practice with the carpenter\'s pencil in\r\nmaking these letters will enable the student to finally produce\r\nthem with the pen used for the purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Insulating Aluminum Wire [306]\r\n\r\nAluminum wire plunged hot into a cold solution of carbonate of\r\nsoda becomes coated with a strong layer of oxide which forms an\r\nexcellent insulator to electricity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Build an Ice-Yacht  [307]\r\nCondensed from an article by H. Percy Ashley in Rudder.\r\n\r\nThe plans and specifications shown in the illustrations are for\r\nmaking a 400-ft. class ice-yacht, having a double cockpit to\r\naccommodate four persons. The weight of the persons in the forward\r\ncockpit keeps the boat from rearing when in a stiff breeze. The\r\nforward cockpit can be removed if necessary. The materials used\r\nare: backbone,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ice-Yacht Complete]\r\n\r\nwhite pine; center, clear spruce; sides, white oak caps; runner\r\nplank, basswood, butternut or oak; cockpit, oak; runners, chocks,\r\netc., quartered white oak. All the iron work should be first-grade\r\nSwedish iron, with the exception of the runners, which are soft\r\ncast iron.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to go into detail with the measurements as\r\nthey are plainly shown in the sketches. The backbone is 37-1/2 ft.\r\nover all, 12 in. in the center, 5 in. stern, 3-1/2 in. at the\r\nnose; width 4-1/2 in. All wood should be selected from the best\r\ngrades, well seasoned and free from checks. In Fig. 1 is shown the\r\ncomplete ice-yacht with general dimensions for the sail and main\r\nparts. Other dimensions are shown in Fig-, 2. The backbone is\r\ncapped on the upper and lower edges full length with strips of\r\noak, 4-1/4 in. wide and 5/8 in. thick. The lengthwise side strips\r\nof spruce are 1-1/4 in. thick. The filling-in pieces placed\r\nbetween the side pieces are of seasoned white pine, leaving the\r\nopen places as shown in Fig. 2. The parts are put together with\r\nhot glue and brass screws.\r\n\r\nThe runner plank should be placed\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Details of the Ice-Yacht Parts]\r\n\r\nwith the heart of the wood up, so as to give the natural curve\r\nfrom the ice so that it will act as a spring. The plank is 16 in.\r\nwide in the center, 14 in. at the ends; 4-1/8 in. thick at the\r\ncenter and 2-3/4 in. at the ends.\r\n\r\nDetails of the runners are shown in Figs. 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9.\r\nThe cast iron shoes are filed and finished with emery paper,\r\nmaking the angle on the cutting edge 45 deg. on both sides. The\r\nrunners are 7-1/4 in. wide over all and 2-1/8 in. thick. The soft\r\niron casting is 2-1/4 in. deep. The shoes are fastened by 5/8-in.\r\nmachine bolts. These are shown in Figs. 3 and 9. The rudder is\r\n2-3/4 in. thick, 5 in. deep, including wood and iron, and 3 ft.\r\nlong. The cast iron shoe is 1-7/8 in. deep and fastened on with\r\nfour 1/2-in. machine bolts. A brass plate, 1/4 in. thick, 2 in.\r\nwide and 7 in. long, is inserted on each side of the runners as\r\nshown in Fig. 9. Three holes are drilled through for a 3/4-in.\r\nriding bolt that can be shifted as desired for rough or smooth\r\nice. The runner chocks and guides are 1-7/8 in. thick and 4-1/2\r\nin. deep. They are set in the runner plank 1/4 in. and fastened\r\nwith glue and 1/2-in. lag screws. These are shown in Figs. 6 and\r\n7.\r\n\r\nThe aft cockpit is stationary, while the fore or passenger cockpit\r\ncan be removed at will. Both cockpits are the same size, 42 in.\r\nwide and 7 ft. long over all. Each one has a bent rail, 1-1/2 in.\r\nby 4 in., grooved 1/2 in. by 7/8 in. before bending. The flooring\r\nis of oak, 1-1/2 in. thick and 4 in. wide, tongue-and grooved. The\r\nforward cockpit is made in halves and hung on the backbone with\r\nwrought-iron straps and bolts. These are shown in Figs. 41, 43 and\r\n44. Two pieces of oak, 1/2 in, by 4 in. are fastened with screws\r\nto the flooring, parallel with the backbone in the forward\r\ncockpit. The runner plank which passes under this cockpit gives it\r\nstability.\r\n\r\nThe spars should be hollow and have the following dimensions:\r\nMast, 23 ft. 3 in.; heel, 3-3/4 in. ; center, 5-1/4 in.; tip, 4\r\nin. ; boom 23-1/2 ft.; heel, 3-3/4 in. ;center, 4 in.; tip, 2-7/8\r\nin. at ends; gaff, 12-1/2 ft.; center, 3-1/2 in.; ends, 2-1/2 in.;\r\njib-boom, 10-1/2 ft.; 1-3/4 in. at the ends, 2-1/8 in. at the\r\ncenter. The gaff is furnished with bent jaws of oak, Fig. 17, and\r\nthe main boom with gooseneck, Fig. 12.\r\n\r\nGalvanized cast-steel yacht rigging, 5/16 in. in diameter, is used\r\nfor the shrouds; jibstay, 3/8 in. in diameter; runner plank guys,\r\n5/16 in. in diameter; bobstay, 3/8 in. in diameter; martingale\r\nstay, 1/4 in. in diameter. The throat,and peak halyards are 3/8\r\nin. in diameter; jib halyards, 1/4 in. in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe main sheet rigging is 9/16-in. Russian bolt rope; jibs,\r\n7/16-in. manila bolt rope, 4-strand; jib-sheet, 3/8-in. manila\r\nbolt rope. Four 1/2-in. bronze turnbuckles, Fig. 34, are used for\r\nthe shrouds; one 5/8-in. turnbuckle for the jibstay and one for\r\nthe bobstay; four 3/8-in. turnbuckles for the runner plank stays,\r\nand one for the martingale stay.\r\n\r\nTwo rope blocks for 3/8-in. wire rope, Fig. 10, are used for the\r\npeak and throat, and one block for the wire rope 1/4 in. in\r\ndiameter for the jib halyard. Four 6-in. and one 7-in. cleats,\r\nFig. 18, are used. The blocks shown in Fig. 11 are used for the\r\nmain and jib sheets. The steering arrangement is shown in Figs. 4\r\nand 5. The tiller is 3-1/2 ft. long; rudder post, 1-1/4 in. in\r\ndiameter; shoulder to lower end of jaws, 4 in.; depth of jaws,\r\n2-7/8 in.; length of post including screw top, 12 in. The rubber\r\nwasher acts as a spring on rough ice.\r\n\r\nIn Figs. 13, 14, 15 and 16 are shown metal bands for the nose of\r\nthe backbone, and Figs. 19, 20, 21, 22 and 23 show the saddles\r\nthat fit over the backbone and hold the runner plank in place.\r\nThere are two sets of these. A chock should be sunk in the runner\r\nplank at each side to connect with the backbone to keep it from\r\nslipping sidewise as the boat rises in the air. The martingale\r\nspreader is shown in Figs. 24 and 25. Straps through which the\r\nring bolts for the shrouds pass on the ends to fasten the\r\nturnbuckles for the runner plank guys are shown in Figs. 26 and\r\n27. The bobstay spreaders are shown in Figs. 28, 29 and 30. In\r\nFig. 31 is shown the top plate for the rudder post and in Figs. 32\r\nand 33, the lower plate for same. The mast step is shown in Figs.\r\n35, 36 and 37. Two positions of the jib traveler are shown in Fig.\r\n38. The anchor plate for the bobstay under the cockpit is shown in\r\nFigs. 39 and 40.\r\n\r\nAt the nose and heel the runner plank guys end in a loop. The\r\nbobstay has a loop at the nose and ends in a turnbuckle that\r\nfastens to the anchor plate under the cockpit, aft. The shrouds,\r\njibstay and martingale have loops at the masthead and are spliced\r\nbare over solid thimbles. The loops are finished in pigskin and\r\nserved with soft cotton twine over the splice and varnished. The\r\nparceling is done with insulating tape. Serve the tiller with soft\r\ncotton twine and ride a second serving over the first. For the\r\nhalyards hoisting use a jig shown in Fig. 46. The thimble shown in\r\nFig. 47 is made by splicing the rope to the thimble at running\r\npart of halyard and passing back and forth through cleat and\r\nthimble. This gives a quick and strong purchase and does away with\r\ncumbersome blocks of the old-fashioned jig. The jib-sheet leads\r\naft to the steering cockpit. The main-sheet ends in a jig of a\r\nsingle block and a single block with becket. Be sure that your\r\nsail covers are large enough--the sail maker always makes them too\r\ntight. The cockpit covers must fit tightly around the cockpit\r\nrail. Many boats have sail and cockpit covers in one piece.\r\n\r\nThe woodwork may be finished as desired by the builder. The\r\ndimensions of the sails are given in the general drawing, Fig. 1.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Turning Lights On and Off from Any Number of Places [310]\r\n\r\nThis can be done by the use of any number of reversing switches\r\nsuch as\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wiring Diagram]\r\n\r\nthose shown at Band C. These are inserted between the two-way\r\nswitches A and D. Turning such a switch up or down connects the\r\nfour contact pieces either diagonally as at C, or lengthwise as at\r\nB. The diagram shows connection from A to D, when the lamps will\r\nbe on, but by turning either of these four switches into its\r\nalternative position, shown by the dotted lines, the circuit will\r\nbe broken and the lights extinguished. When this has been done,\r\nthe circuit may be restored and the lamps lighted again by\r\naltering either of the four switches in exactly the same way, and\r\nso on.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that a reversing switch used in this way\r\npractically undoes whatever is done by the other switches. In the\r\naccompanying diagram only two reversing switches are shown and the\r\nlights can be independently controlled from four distinct\r\npositions. Any number of reversing switches can be placed between\r\nthe two-way switches A and D to increase the number of places from\r\nwhich the lights could be turned on and off.\r\n--Contributed by J. S. Dow, Mayfield, London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make an Electric Pendant Switch [310]\r\n\r\nIt is often desired to use a pendant switch for controlling\r\nclusters of incandescent lamps. When such a switch is not at hand,\r\na very good substitute can be made by screwing a common fuse plug\r\ninto a key socket and connecting the socket in series with the\r\nlamps to be controlled. In this way you get a safe, reliable,\r\nfused switch.\r\n--Contributed by C. C. Heyder, Hansford, W. Va.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Measure [310]\r\n\r\nNever guess the length of a piece of work--measure it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Home-Made Water Motor  [311]\r\n\r\nThe small water motor shown in the illustration is constructed in\r\nthe same manner as a German toy steam turbine. The wheel, which is\r\nmade of aluminum 1/16 in. thick and 7 in. in diameter, has 24\r\nblades attached to it.\r\n\r\nThe lugs or extensions carrying the rim must be made from the\r\nmetal of the wheel, therefore a circle 8 in. in diameter must be\r\nfirst described on the aluminum plate, then another circle 7 in.\r\nin diameter within the first and then a circle for the base of the\r\nblades, 3-1/2 in. in diameter. Twenty-four radial lines at equal\r\ndistances apart are drawn between the two smaller circles and a\r\n1/4-in. hole drilled at the intersecting points of the radial\r\nlines and the innermost circle.\r\n\r\nCentrally between each pair of radial lines and between the two\r\nouter circles, 1/2 by 3/8-in. lugs are marked out and the metal\r\ncut away as shown in Fig. 1. A 1/8-in. hole is then drilled in the\r\ncenter of each lug. Each division is separated by cutting down\r\neach radial line to the 1/4-in. hole with a hacksaw. Each arm is\r\nthen given a quarter turn, as shown by the dotted lines in Fig. 2,\r\nand the lug bent over at right angles to receive the rim. The rim\r\nis made of the same material as the disk and contains twenty-four\r\n1/8 in. holes corresponding to those in the lugs to receive brass\r\nbolts 1/4-in. long.\r\n\r\nThe disks PP were taken from the ends of a discarded typewriter\r\nplaten, but if these cannot be readily obtained, they can be\r\nturned from metal or a heavy flat disk used instead.\r\n\r\nThe casing was made from two aluminum cake pans whose diameter was\r\n8 in. at the base, increasing to 9 in. at the rim. The centers of\r\nthese were located and a 1/4-in. hole drilled for the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3]\r\n\r\nshaft. The disks P are the same as used on the wheel. Six holes\r\n1/8-in. in diameter were drilled through the flat part of the rims\r\nwhile the two halves were held together in a vise. Bolts were\r\nplaced through these holes to join the casing when ready for\r\nassembling. One side of the casing was then bolted to two 4-in.\r\nordinary metal shelf brackets which were\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Details of Motor]\r\n\r\nscrewed to a substantial wood base. This kept one-half of the\r\ncasing independent of the main structure so that the wheel is\r\neasily accessible.\r\n\r\nThe nozzle was made of 1/2-in. brass pipe which was first filled\r\nwith molten babbitt metal. When the metal was cool, a 1/4-in. hole\r\nwas drilled halfway through the length of the tube, the hole being\r\ncontinued through to the other end by means of a 1/8-in. drill.\r\nThe lower orifice was then slightly enlarged with a small taper\r\nreamer, and the upper portion of the bore was reamed out almost to\r\nthe brass to make a smooth entrance for the water.\r\n\r\nA fixture to hold this nozzle is shown in Fig. 3. It was cast of\r\nbabbitt metal in a wood mold. The hole for the nozzle was drilled\r\nat an angle of 20 deg. to the plate part. An alternative and\r\nperhaps easier way would be to insert the nozzle in the mold at\r\nthe proper angle and cast the metal around it. A hole was then cut\r\nin one of the sides of the casing at a point 2-7/8 in. along a\r\nhorizontal line from the center. The nozzle fixture was then\r\nbolted on with the exit orifice of the nozzle pointing downward\r\nand through the hole in the casing.\r\n\r\nSix 1/8-in. holes were drilled through the flat portions of the\r\nrims while the two halves of the casing were held securely\r\ntogether in a vise. Bolts were used in these holes to join the\r\ncasing.\r\n\r\nThe wheel was used on the dripboard of a kitchen sink and no\r\nprovision was made to carry off the spent water except to cut two\r\n1/2-in. holes in the bottom of the casing and allowing the waste\r\nto flow off directly into the sink.\r\n--Contributed by Harry F.

It consists of two cement slabs, one flat\r\nand upright, the other curved and on the ground. The vertical slab\r\nis fastened securely against a fence, barn or shed. The barn or\r\nthe shed is preferable, for if the slab is fastened to a fence,\r\nthe ball will bound over a great many times and much time will be\r\nlost in finding it.\r\n\r\nThe player stands as far as he cares from the slabs and throws the\r\nball against the lower slab. The ball immediately rebounds to the\r\nupright slab and returns with almost as great a force as it was\r\ndelivered. If the thrower does not throw the ball exactly in the\r\nsame spot each time, the ball will not rebound to the same place,\r\nconsequently the eye and muscles are trained to act quickly,\r\nespecially if the player stands within 15 or 20 ft. of the slabs\r\nand throws the ball with great force.\r\n\r\nThis apparatus also teaches a person to throw accurately, as a\r\ndifference in aim of a few inches on the lower slab may cause the\r\nball to flyaway over the player\'s head on the rebound.\r\n--Contributed by F.

Punch\r\ntwo holes 1 in. apart at A, B, C and D, Fig. 1, in the cardboard\r\nborder close to the edge of the picture. Put a string up through\r\nthe hole B, Fig. 2, then across the corner of the photograph and\r\ndown through the hole C and up through hole D, then to E, etc.,\r\nuntil the starting point A is reached, and tie the ends.\r\n\r\nThe photograph will not get damaged, if it is covered with tissue\r\npaper and placed with the face to the cardboard. The extension\r\nborder of cardboard prevents the edges of the mount from being\r\ndamaged and the corners\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Back for Mailing Photo]\r\n\r\nfrom wearing. Both cardboard and photograph are wrapped together\r\nin paper, and the package is ready for mailing.\r\n--Contributed by Earl R. Hastings, Corinth, Vt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Mystifying Watch Trick [313]\r\n\r\nBorrow a watch from one of the audience and allow the owner to\r\nplace it in the box, as shown in Fig. 1. This box should be about\r\n3 in. long, 4 in. wide and 2-1/2 in. deep, says the Scientific\r\nAmerican. It should be provided with a hinged cover, M, with a\r\nlock, N. The tricky part of this box is the side S, which is\r\npivoted at T by driving two short nails into it, one through the\r\nfront side and the other through the back, so that when S is\r\npushed in at the top, it swings around as shown in Fig. 1 and\r\nallows the watch to slide out into the performer\'s hand. The side\r\nS should fit tightly when closed, so that the box may be examined\r\nwithout betraying the secret. As the side S extends down to the\r\nbottom of the box, it facilitates the use of the fingers in\r\npulling outward at the lower pan while the thumb is pressing\r\ninward at the top part. The side of the box opposite S should be\r\nbuilt up in the same way, but not pivoted.\r\n\r\nUse a flat-bottom tumbler, A, Fig. 2, containing an inner cone, B,\r\nfor the reproduction of the watch. The cone is made of cardboard\r\npasted together so it fits snugly inside of the tumbler. The cone\r\nis closed except at the bottom, then bran is pasted on the outside\r\nsurfaces to make the tumbler appear as if filled with bran when it\r\nis in place. Place the tumbler with the cone inside on a table\r\nsomewhat in the background. Put some loose bran on top of the cone\r\nand allow the cork, attached as shown in B, Fig. 2, to hang down\r\non the outside of the tumbler, away from the audience. A large\r\nhandkerchief should be laid beside the tumbler.\r\n\r\nAfter the watch has been placed in the box, Fig. 1, the performer\r\ntakes the box in his left hand, and while in the act of locking it\r\nwith his right hand secures possession of the watch as previously\r\nexplained. Tossing the key to the owner of the watch, the\r\nperformer places the box on a chair or table near the audience\r\nand, with the watch securely palmed, walks back to get the\r\ntumbler. Standing directly in front of the tumbler with his back\r\ntoward the audience, the performer\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Parts for the Watch Trick]\r\n\r\nquickly raises the cone with his right hand, lays the watch in the\r\nbottom of the tumbler and replaces the cone.\r\n\r\nThe loaded tumbler and the handkerchief are then brought forward,\r\nand the former is placed in full view of the audience with the\r\ncork hanging down behind it. The performer calls attention to the\r\ntumbler being full of bran and picks up some of it from the top to\r\nsubstantiate his statement. He then spreads the handkerchief over\r\nthe tumbler, commands the watch to pass from the box into the\r\ntumbler and the bran to disappear.\r\n\r\nThe box is then handed to the owner of the watch so that he may\r\nunlock it with the key he holds. As soon as the box is found to be\r\nempty, the performer grasps the handkerchief spread over the\r\ntumbler, also the cork tied to the cone. Raising the handkerchief,\r\nhe carries up the cone within it, leaving the watch in the bottom\r\nto be returned to its owner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Locking Several Drawers with One Lock [314]\r\n\r\nA series or row of drawers can be secured with one lock by using\r\nthe\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Drawer Lock]\r\n\r\ndevice shown in the sketch. This method takes away several\r\ndangling locks and the carrying of many keys. A rod is used\r\nthrough the various staples over the hasps. The rod is upset on\r\none end and flattened to make sufficient metal for drilling a hole\r\nlarge enough to insert the bar of a padlock. If the bar is made of\r\nsteel and hardened, it is almost impossible to cut it in two.\r\n--Contributed by F. W. Bentley, Huron, S. Dak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Testing Small Electric Lamps [314]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying sketch shows the construction of a handy device\r\nfor testing miniature electric lights. The base is made to take in\r\nan electric flash lamp battery. Two strips of brass, C and D, are\r\nconnected to the battery. The lamp is tested by\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lamp Tester]\r\n\r\nputting the metal end on the lower brass strip and the side\r\nagainst the upper one. A great number of lamps can be tested in a\r\nshort time by means of this device.\r\n--Contributed by Abner B. Shaw, North Dartmouth, Mass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Pin Ball [314]\r\n\r\nThe pin ball shown in the illustration is made of calfskin\r\nmodeling leather and saddler\'s felt. Two pieces of leather are\r\nused, and one piece of felt, all three being cut circular to a\r\ndiameter of about 3 in. The felt may be about 1/2 in. thick, and\r\nleather of a deep brown color is recommended.\r\n\r\nMoisten the leather on the back side with as much water as it will\r\ntake without showing through the face. Lay it on a sheet of heavy\r\nglass or copper, or other hard, smooth, nonabsorbent material.\r\nPlace the design, which has been previously prepared, over the\r\nface of the leather. Indent the outline of the design with a\r\nnutpick or any other pointed tool that will not cut the leather.\r\nRemove the pattern, and go\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Made of Leather and Felt]\r\n\r\nover the outline again to deepen the tool marks.\r\n\r\nThe space between the border and the design is now stamped with a\r\ncuppointed nail set, care being taken not to cut the leather,\r\nespecially if the tool be new. Rubbing the edges of the nail set\r\nover a piece of emery paper will serve to dull them, if they are\r\ntoo sharp.\r\n\r\nWhen the designs have been worked on the leather, paste or glue\r\nthe leather to the two sides of the belt, and punch a hole in the\r\ncenter through which to place a cord for hanging up the ball.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Cleaning Woodwork [315]\r\n\r\nAn easy method of removing the dirt and old varnish at the same\r\ntime around a kitchen sink is told by a correspondent of National\r\nMagazine as follows:\r\n\r\nMake a soft soap from common yellow laundry soap, and when it is\r\nalmost cold stir in one tablespoonful of concentrated lye and\r\none-half cupful of kerosene. When the mixture becomes a heavy\r\npaste, it is ready to be spread over the woodwork with a paint\r\nbrush. Allow the soap to remain for a day and a half, then wash it\r\noff with plenty of hot water. The woodwork will be clean and ready\r\nfor varnishing when it dries out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Bill File Made of Corkscrews [315]\r\n\r\nAn ordinary corkscrew makes a convenient file for small bills or\r\nmemoranda. It may be thrown in any position without danger of the\r\npapers slipping off. A rack to hold a number of files can be made\r\nof a wood strip (Fig. 1) fitted with hooks or screw eyes cut in a\r\nhook shape, as shown in Fig. 2,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bill File]\r\n\r\nSingle bills may be separated from the others and will remain\r\nseparated as in Fig. 3.\r\n--Contributed by James M. Kane, Doylestown, Pa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Ornamental Metal Inkstand [315]\r\n\r\nThe metal required for making this stand is 3/16 in. in width and\r\nmay be\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Inkstand and Details of Frame]\r\n\r\nsteel, brass or copper. The shaping is done as shown in Figs. 2\r\nand 3. There are, in all, eight pieces to be bent. The two\r\nsupports are each formed of one piece of metal with the exception\r\nthat the end scroll pieces on the under side are made separately.\r\nEight rivets are required to fasten the two horizontal rings to\r\nthe supports. The glass receptacle can be purchased at a\r\nstationery store.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Holding Eyeglasses Firm [315]\r\n\r\nPersons who wear noseglasses and who are troubled with excessive\r\nperspiration, should chalk the sides of the bridge of the nose\r\nbefore putting on the glasses. The latter will then never slip,\r\neven in the warmest weather. If the chalk shows, use a pink stick,\r\nwhich can be purchased from any art school or supply store.\r\n\r\nSubstitute for Gummed Paper [315]\r\n\r\nGummed paper is a great convenience in the home especially for\r\nlabels, but it is not always found among the household supplies.\r\nThe gummed portions of unsealed envelopes in which circulars are\r\nreceived can be utilized for this purpose. Quite a large label may\r\nbe made from these envelope flaps.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Repairing a Broken Phonograph Spring  [316]\r\n\r\nAs I live a great distance from a railroad station, I did not care\r\nto pay the price, and await the time necessary to deliver a new\r\nphonograph spring to replace one that broke in my machine, and I\r\nrepaired the old one in a creditable manner as follows:\r\n\r\nI forced the two ends of the break out where I could get at them,\r\nthen heated each end separately with a pair of red hot tongs and\r\nturned a hook or lap on them the same as the joints in knock-down\r\nstovepipes. When the ends were hooked together, the spring worked\r\nas good as new. The heated portion did not affect the strength of\r\nthe spring.\r\n--Contributed by Marion P. Wheeler, Greenleaf, Oregon.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Calls While You Are Out [316]\r\n\r\nIf you wish to know whether or not the door or telephone bell\r\nrings during your absence, place a little rider of paper or\r\ncardboard on the clapper in such a way that it will be dislodged\r\nif the bell rings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Small Bench Lathe Made of Pipe Fittings [316]\r\n\r\nThe most important machine in use in the modern machine or\r\nwood-working shop is the lathe. The uses to which this wonderful\r\nmachine can be put would be too numerous to describe, but there is\r\nhardly a mechanical operation in which the turning lathe does not\r\nfigure. For this reason every amateur mechanic and wood-worker who\r\nhas a workshop, no matter how small, is anxious to possess a lathe\r\nof some\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1-Details of Lathe]\r\n\r\nsort. A good and substantial homemade lathe, which is suitable for\r\nwoodturning and light metal work, may be constructed from pipe and\r\npipe fittings as shown in the accompanying sketch.\r\n\r\nThe bed of this lathe is made of a piece of  1-in. pipe, about 30\r\nin. long. It can be made longer or shorter, but if it is made much\r\nlonger, a larger size of pipe should be used. The head-stock is\r\nmade of two tees, joined by a standard long nipple as shown in\r\nFig. 1. All the joints should be screwed up tight and then\r\nfastened with 3/16-in. pins to keep them from turning. The ends of\r\nthe bed are fixed to the baseboard by means of elbows, nipples and\r\nflanges arranged as shown. The two bearings in the headstock are\r\nof brass. The spindle hole should be drilled and reamed after they\r\nare screwed in place in the tee. The spindle should be of steel\r\nand long enough to reach through the bearing and pulley and have\r\nenough end left for the center point. The point should extend\r\nabout 1-1/2 in. out from the collar. The collar can be turned or\r\nshrunk on the spindle as desired. The end of the spindle should be\r\nthreaded to receive a chuck.\r\n\r\nThe tailstock is also made of two tees joined by a nipple. The\r\nlower tee should be bored out for a sliding fit on the bed pipe.\r\nThe upper one should be tapped with a machine tap for the spindle\r\nwhich is threaded to fit it. The\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2]\r\n\r\nspindle has a handle fitted at one end and has the other end bored\r\nout for the tail stock center. Both the tail stock and the\r\nheadstock centerpoints should be hardened. A clamp for holding the\r\ntail stock spindle is made of a piece of strap iron, bent and\r\ndrilled as shown. It is held together by means of a small machine\r\nscrew and a knurled nut. The tee should have a slot cut in it\r\nabout one-half its length and it should also have one bead filed\r\naway so that the clamp will fit tightly over it.\r\n\r\nThe hand rest is made from a tapering elbow, a tee and a forging.\r\nThe forging can be made by a blacksmith at a small expense. Both\r\nthe lower\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3]\r\n\r\ntees of the handrest and the tailstock should be provided with\r\nscrew clamps to hold them in place.\r\n\r\nThe pulley is made of hardwood pieces, 3/4 or 1 in. thick as\r\ndesired. It is fastened to the spindle by means of a screw, as\r\nshown in Fig. 2, or a key can be used as well.\r\n\r\nCare must be taken to get the tailstock center vertically over the\r\nbed, else taper turning will result. To do this, a straight line\r\nshould be scratched\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4-Chuck ]\r\n\r\non the top of the bed pipe, and when the tail stock is set exactly\r\nvertical, a corresponding line made on this. This will save a\r\ngreat deal of time and trouble and possibly some errors.\r\n\r\nThe two designs of chucks shown in Figs. 3 and 4 are very easy to\r\nmake, and will answer for a great variety of work.\r\n\r\nAs the details are clearly shown and the general dimensions given\r\non the accompanying sketches, it should not be a difficult matter\r\nfor the young mechanic to construct this machine.\r\n--Contributed by W. M. Held, Laporte, Indiana.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Holder for Flexible Lamp-Cord [317]\r\n\r\nThe holder is made of a round stick--a piece of a broom handle\r\nwill do--as shown in Fig. 1. It is about 1 in. long with two\r\nnotches cut out for the strands of the cord. These holders are\r\neasily made and will answer the purpose almost as well as the ones\r\nmade in porcelain. Painting or enameling will improve not only\r\ntheir appearance, but also their insulating properties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ceiling-Cord Holder]\r\n\r\nSeveral of them can be used along a line, as shown in Fig. 2.\r\n--Contributed by M. Musgrove, Boissevain, Man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Support for Double Clotheslines [318]\r\n\r\nAnyone using a double clothesline over pulleys will find the\r\narrangement shown in Fig. 1 for supporting the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Holder on a Clothesline]\r\n\r\nlower line quite convenient. The support is made of a piece of\r\n3/4-in. square or round wood which has a screw-eye turned into\r\neach end. The line is run through these screw-eyes as shown in\r\nFig. 2.\r\n--Contributed by W. W. UpDeGraff, Fruitvale, Cal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Hot Pan or Plate Lifter  [318]\r\n\r\nUnless a person uses considerable caution, bad burns may be\r\nsuffered when taking hot pies from an oven. If one reaches in and\r\ntakes hold of the pie pan with a cloth, the arm is liable to touch\r\nthe oven door and receive a\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lifter on Pie Pan]\r\n\r\nburn. To obviate this, I made the device shown in the sketch for\r\nlifting hot pie pans and plates. The handle is of pine about 18\r\nin. long, and the two loops are made of heavy wire. The ends of\r\nthe first loop of wire are put through the handle from the back,\r\nas shown, and then bent so as to stand out at an angle. The second\r\nloop is hinged to swing free on the opposite side of the handle.\r\nIn use, the hinged side of the loop is dropped under one edge of a\r\nplate or pan and the rigid loop is then hooked under the opposite\r\nside. The weight of the pan or dish draws the loops together and\r\nthere is little or no danger of a spill. The same lifter will pick\r\nup any size of plate or pan from a saucer to the largest pie\r\nplates.\r\n--Contributed by E. J. Cline, Ft.

Each club is bored to receive lead washers\r\nwhich are held in place by a spiral spring. A bolt is run through\r\nfrom the handle end and fastened with a round nut. The lead\r\nwashers and spring slip over the bolt as shown in the\r\nillustration. Changing the number of washers changes the weight of\r\nthe club.\r\n--Contributed by Walter W. White, Denver, Colo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Venting a Funnel  [318]\r\n\r\nWhen using a tight-fitting funnel in a small-neck bottle, trouble\r\nis usually experienced by the air causing a spill. This can be\r\neasily remedied by splitting a match in half and tying the parts\r\non the sides of the stem with thread.\r\n--Contributed by Maurice Baudier, New Orleans, La.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Lubricating Woodscrews [318]\r\n\r\nA screw may be turned into hardwood easily, by boring a small hole\r\nand lubricating the screw threads with soft soap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** To Make "Centering" Unnecessary [319]\r\n\r\nFor drilling a hole in a chucked piece, centering is just one\r\noperation too many, if this method is followed:\r\n\r\nFirst, face off the end of the piece, making a true spot at least\r\nas big as the diameter of the drill. Put a center punch mark where\r\nthe tool lines indicate the center of revolution. This serves as a\r\nrough guide for placing the drill between the tail stock center\r\nand the work as usual. Clamp a tool in the tool-post and, on\r\nstarting the lathe, bring it in contact with the drill and keep it\r\nfirmly so until the drill is in fully up to the lips. This\r\nprevents the drill from wobbling, and when once in true up to its\r\nsize, it cannot change any more than under any other starting\r\nconditions. After being entered, the drill does not need the tool,\r\nwhich should be backed out of contact.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Fountain Pen Cap Used as a Ruler [319]\r\n\r\nWhen it is necessary to draw a short line and there is no ruler at\r\nhand, take\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ruling Lines]\r\n\r\noff the cap of your fountain pen and use it as a ruler. If the cap\r\nis fitted with a retaining clip, all the better, as this will\r\nprove a safeguard against slipping.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Vanishing Handkerchief Trick [319]\r\n\r\nThe necessary articles used in performing this trick are the\r\nhandkerchief, vanishing wand, a long piece of glass tubing, a bout\r\n1/2 in. shorter t h a n the wand, and a paper tube closed at one\r\nend and covered with a cap at the other, says the Sphinx. The\r\nhandkerchief rod, shown at C, is concealed in the paper tube A\r\nbefore the performance. The glass tube B, after being shown empty;\r\nis put into the paper tube A, so that the handkerchief rod now is\r\nwithin it, unknown to the spectators. The handkerchief is then\r\nplaced over\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wand]\r\n\r\nthe opening of the tube and pushed in by means of the wand. In\r\ndoing this, the handkerchief and the rod are pushed into the wand,\r\nas shown in D. After the wand is removed, the cap is placed over\r\nthe paper tube, and this given to someone to hold. The command for\r\nthe handkerchief to vanish is given, and it is found to be gone\r\nwhen the glass tube is taken out of the paper cover. This is a\r\nnovel way of making a handkerchief vanish. It can be used in a\r\ngreat number of tricks, and can be varied to suit the performer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Removing Glass Letters from Windows [319]\r\n\r\nGlass letters are removed in the same way as metal letters, by\r\napplying caustic soda or potash around the edges of the letters.\r\nAs the cement softens, manipulate the point of a pocket knife\r\nunder the edges of the letter until the caustic works completely\r\nunder and makes it easy to lift the letters. With care and\r\npatience, every letter may be thus taken off without breakage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Guitar That Is Easy to Make [320]\r\n\r\nA guitar having straight lines, giving it an old-fashioned\r\nappearance, can be made by the home mechanic, and if care is taken\r\nin selecting the material, and having it thoroughly\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Details of Guitar]\r\n\r\nseasoned, the finished instrument will have a fine tone. The\r\nsides, ends and bottom are made of hard wood, preferably hard\r\nmaple, and the top should be made of a thoroughly seasoned piece\r\nof soft pine. The dimensioned pieces required are as follows:\r\n\r\n1 Top. 3/16. by 14 by 17 in. 1 Bottom. 3/16 by 14 by 17 in. 2\r\nSides. 3/16 by 3-5/8 by 16-3/4 in. 1, End. 3/16 by 3-5/8 by 13-1/8\r\nin. 1 End. 3/16 by 3-5/8 by 9-5/6 in. 1 Neck. 1 by 2-5/16 by\r\n18-1/2 in. 1 Fingerboard 5/16 by 2-5/8 by 16 in.\r\n\r\nCut the fingerboard tapering and fasten pieces cut from hatpins\r\nwith small wire staples for frets. All dimensions for cutting and\r\nsetting are shown in the sketch. The neck is cut tapering from G\r\nto F and from J to F, with the back side rounding. A drawknife is\r\nthe proper tool for shaping the neck. Cut a piece of hard wood,\r\n1/4 in. square and 1-7/8 in. long, and glue it to the neck at F.\r\nGlue the fingerboard to the neck and hold it secure with clamps\r\nwhile the glue sets.\r\n\r\nThe brace at D is 1 in. thick, cut to any shape desired. The sides\r\nare glued together and then the front is glued on them. Place some\r\nheavy weights on top and give the glue time to dry. Fasten pieces\r\nof soft wood in the corners for braces. Glue the neck to the box,\r\nmaking it secure by the addition of a carriage bolt at A. A small\r\nblock C is glued to the end to reinforce it for the bolt. Glue\r\nstrips of soft wood, as shown by K, across the front and back to\r\nstrengthen them. The back is then glued on and the outside\r\nsmoothed with sandpaper.\r\n\r\nMake the bottom bridge by using an old hatpin or wire of the same\r\nsize for E secured with pin staples. Glue the bridge on the top at\r\na place that will make the distance from the bridge F to the\r\nbottom bridge E just 24 in. This dimension and those for the frets\r\nshould be made accurately. Six holes, 3/16 in. in diameter, are\r\ndrilled in the bottom bridge for pins. The turning plugs B and\r\nstrings can be purchased at any music store.\r\n--Contributed by J. H.

When it is completed you\r\nwill have a canoe, probably equal to the Indian\'s bark canoe. Not\r\nonly will it serve as an ideal fishing boat, but when you want to\r\ncombine hunting and fishing you can put your boat on your\r\nshoulders and carry it from place to place wherever you want to go\r\nand at the same time carry your gun in your hand. The material\r\nused in its construction is inexpensive and can be purchased for a\r\nfew dollars.\r\n\r\nMake a frame (Fig. 1) on which to stretch the paper. A board 1 in.\r\nthick and about 1 ft. wide and 11-1/2 ft. long is used for a keel,\r\nor backbone, and is cut tapering for about a third of its length,\r\ntoward each end, and beveled\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Detail of Framework Construction]\r\n\r\non the outer edges (A, Fig. 2). The cross-boards (B, B, Fig. 2)\r\nare next sawed from a pine board 1 in. thick. Shape these as shown\r\nby A, Fig. 4, 13 in. wide by 26 in. long, and cut away in the\r\ncenter to avoid useless weight. Fasten them cross-wise to the\r\nbottom board as shown in Fig. 1 and 2, with long stout screws, so\r\nas to divide the keel into three nearly equal parts. Then add the\r\nstem and stern pieces (C, C, Fig. 2). These are better, probably,\r\nwhen made of green elm. Screw the pieces to the bottom-board and\r\nbend them, as shown in Fig. 2, by means of a string or wire,\r\nfastened to a nail driven into the bottom. Any tough, light wood\r\nthat is not easily broken when bending will do. Green wood is\r\npreferable, because it will retain the shape in which it has been\r\nbent better after drying. For the gunwales (a, a, Fig. 3), procure\r\nat a carriage factory, or other place, some tight strips of ash,\r\n3/8 in. thick. Nail them to the crossboards and fasten to the end\r\npieces\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Important Features of Construction]\r\n\r\n(C, C,) in notches, by several wrappings of annealed iron wire or\r\ncopper wire, as shown in Fig. 3. Copper wire is better because it\r\nis less apt to rust. For fastening the gunwales to the crossboards\r\nuse nails instead of screws, because the nails are not apt to\r\nloosen and come out. The ribs, which are easily made of long,\r\nslender switches of osier willow, or similar material, are next\r\nput in, but before doing this, two strips of wood (b, b, Fig. 3)\r\nshould be bent and placed as in Fig. 3. They are used only\r\ntemporarily as a guide in putting in the ribs, and are not\r\nfastened, the elasticity of the wood being sufficient to cause\r\nthem to retain their position. The osiers may average a little\r\nmore than 1/2 in. in thickness and should be cut, stripped of\r\nleaves and bark and put in place while green and fresh. They are\r\nattached to the bottom by means of shingle nails driven through\r\nholes previously made in them with an awl, and are then bent down\r\nuntil they touch the strips of ash (b, b, Fig. 3), and finally cut\r\noff even with the tops of the gunwales, and notched at the end to\r\nreceive them (B, Fig. 4). Between the cross-boards the ribs are\r\nplaced at intervals of 2 or 3 in., while in other parts they are\r\nas much as 5 or 6 in. apart. The ribs having all been fastened in\r\nplace as described, the loose strips of ash (b, b, Fig. 3) are\r\nwithdrawn and the framework will appear somewhat as in Fig. 1. In\r\norder to make all firm and to prevent the ribs from changing\r\nposition, as they are apt to do, buy some split cane or rattan,\r\nsuch as is used for making chair-bottoms, and, after soaking it in\r\nwater for a short time to render it soft and pliable, wind it\r\ntightly around the gunwales and ribs where they join, and also\r\ninterweave it among the ribs in other places, winding it about\r\nthem and forming an irregular network over the whole frame. Osiers\r\nprobably make the best ribs, but twigs of some other trees, such\r\nas hazel or birch, will answer nearly as well. For the ribs near\r\nthe middle of the boat, twigs 5 or 6 ft. long are required. It is\r\noften quite difficult to get these of sufficient thickness\r\nthroughout, and so, in such cases, two twigs may be used to make\r\none rib, fastening the butts side by side on the bottom-board, and\r\nthe smaller ends to the gunwales, as before described. In drying,\r\nthe rattan becomes very tight and the twigs hard and stiff.\r\n\r\nThe frame-work is now complete and ready to be covered. For this\r\npurpose buy about 18 yd. of very strong wrapping-paper. It should\r\nbe smooth on the surface, and very tough, but neither stiff nor\r\nvery thick. Being made in long rolls, it can be obtained in almost\r\nany length desired. If the paper be 1 yd. wide, it will require\r\nabout two breadths to reach around the frame in the widest part.\r\nCut enough of the roll to cover the frame and then soak it for a\r\nfew minutes in water. Then turn the frame upside down and fasten\r\nthe edges of the two strips of paper to it, by lapping them\r\ncarefully on the under side of the bottom-board and tacking them\r\nto it so that the paper hangs down loosely on all sides. The paper\r\nis then trimmed, lapped and doubled over as smoothly as possible\r\nat the ends of the frame, and held in place by means of small\r\nclamps. It should be drawn tight along the edges, trimmed and\r\ndoubled down over the gunwale, where it is firmly held by slipping\r\nthe strips of ash (b, b) just inside of the gunwales into notches\r\nwhich should have been cut at the ends of the cross-boards. The\r\nshrinkage caused by the drying will stretch the paper tightly over\r\nthe framework. When thoroughly dry, varnish inside and out with\r\nasphaltum varnish thinned with turpentine, and as soon as that has\r\nsoaked in, apply a second coat of the same varnish, but with less\r\nturpentine; and finally cover the laps or joints of the paper with\r\npieces of muslin stuck on with thick varnish. Now remove the loose\r\nstrips of ash and put on another layer of paper, fastening it\r\nalong the edge of the boat by replacing the strips as before. When\r\nthe paper is dry, cover the laps with muslin as was done with the\r\nfirst covering. Then varnish the whole outside of the boat several\r\ntimes until it presents a smooth shining surface. Then take some\r\nof the split rattan and, after wetting it, wind it firmly around\r\nboth gunwales and inside strip, passing it through small holes\r\npunched in the paper just below the gunwale, until the inside and\r\noutside strips are bound together into one strong gunwale. Then\r\nput a piece of oil-cloth in the boat between the cross-boards,\r\ntacking it to the bottom-board. This is done to protect the bottom\r\nof the boat.\r\n\r\nNow you may already have a canoe that is perfectly water-tight,\r\nand steady in the water, if it has been properly constructed of\r\ngood material. If not, however, in a few days you may be\r\ndisappointed to find that it is becoming leaky. Then the best\r\nremedy is to cover the whole boat with unbleached muslin, sewed at\r\nthe ends and tacked along the gunwales. Then tighten it by\r\nshrinking and finally give it at least three coats of a mixture of\r\nvarnish and paint. This will doubtless stop the leaking entirely\r\nand will add but little to either the weight or cost.\r\n\r\nRig the boat with wooden or iron row locks (B, B, Fig. 5),\r\npreferably iron, and light oars. You may put in\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Off for a Hunt]\r\n\r\nseveral extra thwarts or cross-sticks, fore and aft, and make a\r\nmovable seat (A, Fig. 5.) With this you will doubtless find your\r\nboat so satisfactory that you will make no more changes.\r\n\r\nFor carrying the boat it is convenient to make a sort of short\r\nyoke (C, Fig. 5), which brings all the weight upon the shoulders;\r\nand thus lightens the labor and makes it very handy to carry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** To Hang Heavy Things on a Nail [323]\r\n\r\nBoys will find many places around\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Double Nails]\r\n\r\nthe house, where a hook to hang things on will be a great\r\nconvenience. Instead of buying hooks use wire nails, and if driven\r\nas shown in the cut, they will support very heavy weights. Drive\r\nthe lower nail first.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Home-Made Elderberry Huller [324]\r\n\r\nAs we had only one day to pick elderberries, we wanted to get as\r\nmany of them as we could in that time. We could pick them faster\r\nthan they could\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Details of the Elderberry Huller]\r\n\r\nbe hulled by hand so we made a huller to take along with us to\r\nhull the berries as fast as they were picked. We procured a box\r\nand made a frame, Fig. 1, to fit it easily, then made another\r\nframe the same size and put a piece of wire mesh between them as\r\nshown in Fig. 2, allowing a small portion of the mesh to stick out\r\nof the frames. The top frame would keep the berries from rolling\r\nor jumping off, and the bottom frame kept the wire mesh and frame\r\nfrom being shaken off the box. The projecting edges of the mesh\r\nwould keep the frame on the top edge of the box. The top view of\r\nthe frame is shown in Fig. 1 and the end in Fig. 5, and the box on\r\nwhich the frame rests in Fig. 3. The actual size of the wire mesh\r\nused is shown in Fig. 4. One person could hull with this huller as\r\nmany berries as two persons would pick.\r\n--Contributed by Albert Niemann, Pittsburg, Pa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Bulb on a Glass Tube [324]\r\n\r\nAs a great many persons during the winter months are taking\r\nadvantage of the long evenings to experiment in one way or\r\nanother, the following method of forming bulbs on glass tubes may\r\nbe of interest. A common method is to heat the part to be formed\r\nand by blowing in one end of the tube gradually expand the glass.\r\nThis way has its drawbacks, as many are not sufficiently familiar\r\nwith the work to blow a uniform blast, and the result is, a hole\r\nis blown through the side of the tube by uneven heating or\r\nblowing.\r\n\r\nA good way to handle this work, is to take the tube and 1 or 2 in.\r\nmore in length than the finished article is to be and place one\r\nend over an alcohol flame, and by holding a spare piece of tubing\r\nagainst the end allow them both to come to a melting heat, then\r\npull apart and instead of breaking off the long thread thus\r\nformed, simply hold it in the flame at an angle of 45 deg. and\r\nmelt it down and close the end at the same time. Close the other\r\nend with the same operation; this makes the tube airtight.\r\n\r\nGradually heat the tube at the point where the bulb is to be\r\nformed, slowly turning the tube to get a uniform heat. The air\r\ninside of the tube becoming heated will expand, and the glass,\r\nbeing softer where the flame has been applied, will be pushed out\r\nin the shape of a bulb. A great deal of care should be taken not\r\nto go to extremes, as the bulb will burst with a loud report if\r\nthe heat is applied too long. The best results are obtained by\r\nheating the glass slowly and then the bulb can be formed with\r\nregularity. This is an easy way to make a thermometer tube. After\r\nthe bulb is formed, the other end of the tube can be opened by\r\nheating, drawing out and breaking the thread like glass.\r\n--Contributed by A. Oswald.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Sconce [325]\r\n\r\nA sconce is a candlestick holder, so made that it has a reflector\r\nof brass or copper and is to hang upon the wall. The tools\r\nnecessary are a riveting hammer, file, metal shears, rivet punch,\r\nflat and round-nosed pliers, screwdriver and sheet brass or copper\r\nNo. 23 gauge.\r\n\r\nTo make the sconce proceed as follows: First, cut off a piece of\r\nbrass so that it shall have 1/2 in. extra metal all around;\r\nsecond, with a piece of carbon paper, trace upon the brass lines\r\nthat shall represent the margin of the sconce proper, also trace\r\nthe decorative design; third, with a nail set make a series of\r\nholes in the extra margin about 3/4 in. apart and large enough to\r\ntake in a 3/4-in. thin screw; fourth, fasten the metal to a thick\r\nboard by inserting screws in these holes; fifth, with a\r\ntwenty-penny wire nail that has had the sharpness of its point\r\nfiled off, stamp the background of the design promiscuously. By\r\nholding the nail about 1/4 in. above the work and striking it with\r\nthe hammer, at the same time striving to keep its point at 1/4 in.\r\nabove the metal, very rapid progress can be made. This stamping\r\nlowers the background and at the same time raises the design.\r\nSixth, chase or stamp along the border of the design and\r\nbackground using a nail filed to a chisel edge. This is to make a\r\nclean sharp division between background and design. Seventh, when\r\nthe stamping is complete remove the screws and metal from the\r\nboard and cut off the extra margin with the metal shears. File the\r\nedges until they are smooth to the touch.\r\n\r\nThe drip cup is a piece of brass cut circular and shaped by\r\nplacing the brass over a hollow in one end of a block. Give the\r\nmetal a circular motion, at the same time beat it with a\r\nround-nosed mallet. Work from the center along concentric rings\r\noutward, then reverse.\r\n\r\nThe candle holders may have two, three, four, or six arms, and are\r\nbent to shape by means of the round-nosed\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Completed Sconce; Shaping the Holders; Riveting]\r\n\r\npliers. The form of the brackets which support the drip cups may\r\nbe seen in the illustration.\r\n\r\nHaving pierced the bracket, drip cup, and holder, these three\r\nparts are riveted together as indicated in the drawing. It will be\r\nfound easier usually if the holder is not shaped until after the\r\nriveting is done. The bracket is then riveted to the back of the\r\nsconce. Small copper rivets are used.\r\n\r\nIt is better to polish all the pieces before fastening any of them\r\ntogether. Metal polish of any kind will do. After the parts have\r\nbeen assembled a lacquer may be applied to keep the metal from\r\ntarnishing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How To Make a Hectograph [326]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Making Copies with the Hectograph]\r\n\r\nA hectograph is very simply and easily made and by means of it\r\nmany copies of writing can be obtained from a single original.\r\nMake a tray of either tin or pasteboard, a little larger than the\r\nsheet of paper you ordinarily use and about 1/2 in. deep. Soak 1\r\noz. of gelatine in cold water over night and in the morning pour\r\noff the water. Heat 6-1/2 oz. of glycerine to about 200 deg. F. on\r\na water bath, and add the gelatine. This should give a clear\r\nglycerine solution of gelatine.\r\n\r\nPlace the tray so that it is perfectly level and pour in the\r\ngelatinous composition until it is nearly level with the edge of\r\nthe tray. Cover it so the cover does not touch the surface of the\r\ncomposition and let it stand six hours, when it will be ready for\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nMake the copy to be reproduced on ordinary paper with aniline ink;\r\nusing a steel pen, and making the lines rather heavy so they have\r\na greenish color in the light. A good ink may be made of methyl\r\nviolet 2 parts, alcohol 2 parts, sugar 1 part, glycerine 4 parts,\r\nand water 24 parts. Dissolve the violet in the alcohol mixed with\r\nthe glycerine; dissolve the sugar in the water and mix both\r\nsolutions.\r\n\r\nWhen the original copy of the writing is ready moisten the surface\r\nof the hectograph slightly with a sponge, lay the copy face down\r\nupon it and smooth down, being careful to exclude all air bubbles\r\nand not shifting the paper. Leave it nearly a minute and raise one\r\ncorner and strip it from the pad, where will remain a reversed\r\ncopy of the inscription.\r\n\r\nImmediately lay a piece of writing paper of the right size on the\r\npad, smooth it down and then remove as before. It will bear a\r\nperfect copy of the original. Repeat the operation until the\r\nnumber of copies desired is obtained or until the ink on the pad\r\nis exhausted. Fifty. or more copies can be obtained from a single\r\noriginal.\r\n\r\nWhen through using the hectograph wash it off with a moist sponge,\r\nand it will be ready for future use. If the surface is impaired at\r\nany time it can be remelted in a water bath and poured into a tray\r\nas before, if it has not absorbed too much ink.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Sailomobile [326]\r\nBy Frank Mulford, Shiloh, N. J.\r\n\r\nI had read of the beach automobiles used on the Florida coast;\r\nthey were like an ice boat with a sail, except they had wheels\r\ninstead of runners. So I set to work to make something to take me\r\nover the country roads.\r\n\r\nI found and used seven fence pickets for the frame work, and other\r\nthings as they were needed. I spliced two rake handles together\r\nfor the mast, winding the ends where they came together with wire.\r\nA single piece would be better if you can get one long enough. The\r\ngaff, which is the stick to which the upper end of the sail is\r\nfastened, is a broomstick. The boom, the stick at the bottom of\r\nthe sail, was made of a rake handle with a broomstick spliced to\r\nmake it long enough. Mother let me have a sheet, which I put down\r\non the floor and cut into the shape of a mainsail. The wind was\r\nthe cheapest power to be found, thus it was utilized; the three\r\nwheels were cast-off bicycle wheels.\r\n\r\nI steer with the front wheel, which was the front wheel of an old\r\nbicycle with the fork left on. The axle between the rear wheels is\r\nan iron bar which cost me 15 cents, and the pulley which raises\r\nand lowers the sail cost 5 cents. Twenty cents was all I spent,\r\nall the rest I found.\r\n\r\nA saw, hammer, and brace and bit were the tools used. Slats made\r\nthe seat and a cushion from the house made it comfortable, and in\r\na week\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sailomobile for Use on Country Roads]\r\n\r\neverything was ready for sailing.\r\n\r\nOnce it was started with only my little cousin in it and I had to\r\nrun fast to catch up.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Home-Made Magic Lantern [328]\r\n\r\nThe essential parts of a magic lantern are a condensing lens to\r\nmake the beam of light converge upon the slide to illuminate it\r\nevenly, a projecting lens\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lantern House]\r\n\r\nwith which to throw an enlarged picture of the illuminated slide\r\nupon a screen and some appliances for preserving the proper\r\nrelation of these parts to each other. The best of materials\r\nshould be used and the parts put together with care to produce a\r\nclear picture on the screen.\r\n\r\nThe first to make is the lamp house or box to hold the light. Our\r\nillustration shows the construction for an electric light, yet the\r\nsame box may be used for gas or an oil lamp, provided the material\r\nis of metal. A tin box having dimensions somewhere near those\r\ngiven in the diagrammatic sketch may be secured from your local\r\ngrocer, but if such a box is not found, one can be made from a\r\npiece of tin cut as shown in Fig. 1. When this metal is bent at\r\nright angles on the dotted lines it will form a box as shown in\r\nFig. 2\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Magic Lantern Details]\r\n\r\nwhich is placed on a baseboard, 1/2 to 3/4 in. thick, 8 in. wide,\r\nand 14 in. long. This box should be provided with a reflector\r\nlocated just back of the lamp.\r\n\r\nProcure a plano-convex or a bi-convex 6-in. lens with a focal\r\nlength of from 15 to 20 in. and a projecting lens 2 in. in\r\ndiameter with such a focal length that will give a picture of the\r\nrequired size, or a lens of 12-in. focus enlarging a 3-in. slide\r\nto about 6 ft. at a distance of 24 ft.\r\n\r\nThe woodwork of the lantern should be of 1/2-in., well seasoned\r\npine, white wood or walnut and the parts fastened together with\r\nwood screws, wire brads, or glue, as desired. The board in which\r\nto mount the condensing lens is 16 in. wide and 15 in. high,\r\nbattened on both ends to keep the wood from warping. The board is\r\ncentered both ways, and, at a point 1 in. above the center,\r\ndescribe a 9-in. circle with a compass and saw the wood out with a\r\nscroll or keyhole saw. If a small saw is used, and the work\r\ncarefully done, the circular piece removed will serve to make the\r\nsmaller portion of the ring for holding the condensing lens. This\r\nring is made up from two rings, A and B, Fig. 3. The inside and\r\noutside diameters of the ring B are 3/8 in. greater than the\r\ncorresponding diameters of ring A, so when fastened together\r\nconcentrically an inner rabbet is formed for the reception of the\r\nlens and an outer rabbet to fit against the board C in and against\r\nwhich it rotates being held in place by buttons, DD.\r\n\r\nA table, E, about 2 ft. long is fastened to the board C with\r\nbrackets F and supported at the outer end with a standard. The\r\nslide support, G, and the lens slide, H, are constructed to slip\r\neasily on the table, E, the strips II serving as guides. Small\r\nstrips of tin, JJ, are bent as shown and fastened at the top and\r\nbottom of the rectangular opening cut in the support G for holding\r\nthe lantern slides.\r\n\r\nAll the parts should be joined together snugly and the movable\r\nparts made to slide freely and when all is complete and well\r\nsandpapered, apply two coats of shellac varnish. Place the lamp\r\nhouse on the bottom board behind the condensing lens and the\r\nlantern is ready for use.\r\n\r\nThe proper light and focus may be obtained by slipping the movable\r\nparts on the board E, and when the right position is found for\r\neach, all lantern slides will produce a clear picture on the\r\nscreen, if the position of the lantern and screen is not changed.\r\n--Contributed by Stuart Mason Kerr, St. Paul, Minn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Quickly Made Lamp [329]\r\n\r\nA very simple lamp can be made from materials which are available\r\nin practically every household in the following manner: A cheap\r\nglass tumbler is partly filled with water and then about 1/2 in.\r\nof safe, light burning oil, placed on the water. Cut a thin strip\r\nfrom an ordinary cork and make a hole in the center to carry a\r\nshort piece of wick. The wick should\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lamp]\r\n\r\nbe of such a length as to dip into the oil, but not long enough.\r\nTo reach the water. The upper surface of the cork may be protected\r\nfrom the flame with a small piece of tin bent over the edges and a\r\nhole punched in the center for the wick. The weight of the tin\r\nwill force the cork down into the oil. The level of the oil should\r\nbe such as to make the flame below the top of the tumbler and the\r\nlight then will not be blown out with draughts. The arrangement is\r\nquite safe as, should the glass happen to upset, the water at once\r\nextinguishes the flame.\r\n--Contributed by G. P.

Fold two strips of light cardboard, 1/2 in. wide, so as\r\nto form two oblong boxes, 1/2 in. long and 3/16 in. thick, open on\r\nthe edges. On one of these forms wind evenly the wire taken from a\r\nbell magnet to the depth of 1/8 in. and on the other wind some 20\r\ngauge wire to the same depth. Fasten the wire with gummed label,\r\nto keep it from unwinding.\r\n\r\nGlue the coils to the back of the case and connect one wire from\r\neach binding-post as shown in Fig. 2, while the other two wires\r\nare connected to an induction coil lead which is inserted in the\r\nhole from which the stem was removed. Fasten a brass-headed tack\r\nto the case at the point F with sealing wax or solder and bend a\r\nwire in the shape shown in Fig. 3 to swing freely on the tack.\r\nAttach a piece of steel rod, 3/4 in. long, in the center coil, C,\r\nFig. 2.\r\n\r\nA rubber band, D, connects the steel rod C with the top of the\r\nwatch case.

A convenient\r\nwashing trough for washing full length films is shown in the\r\naccompanying sketch. The trough must be made for the size of the\r\nfilm to be washed. Cut a 1/4-in. board as long as the film and a\r\ntrifle wider than the film\'s width. Attach strips to the edges of\r\nthe board to keep the water from spilling over the sides.\r\n\r\nCut a hole in one side of a baking powder can about half way\r\nbetween the top and bottom, large enough to admit a fair-sized\r\nstream of water from a faucet. Then solder the cover to the can\r\nand punch a number of holes about 1/4 in. apart along the opposite\r\nside from where the large hole was cut. Place this can on one end\r\nof the trough, as shown, with the large hole up.\r\n\r\nSome heavy wire bent in the shape of a U and fastened to the under\r\nside of the trough at the can end will furnish supports to keep\r\nthat end of the trough the highest and place the opening in the\r\ncan close beneath the water faucet. A common pin stuck through one\r\nend of the film and then in the trough close to the can will hold\r\nit in position for washing. Five minutes\' washing with this device\r\nis sufficient to remove all traces of the hypo from the film.\r\n--Contributed by M. M.

Take a\r\nwide-mouthed bottle and fill almost full of water; then into this\r\nbottle place, mouth downward, a small vial or bottle having just\r\nenough air in the bottle to keep it barely afloat. Put a sheet of\r\nrubber over the mouth of the large bottle, draw the edge down over\r\nthe neck and wrap securely with a piece of string thus forming a\r\ntightly stretched diaphragm over the top. When a finger is pressed\r\non the rubber the small bottle will slowly descend until the\r\npressure is released when the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pressure Experiments]\r\n\r\nsmall bottle wilt ascend. The moving of the small bottle is caused\r\nby the pressure transmitted through the water, thus causing the\r\nvolume of air in the small tube to decrease and the bottle to\r\ndescend and ascend when released as the air increases to the\r\noriginal volume.\r\n\r\nThis experiment can be performed with a narrow-necked bottle,\r\nprovided the bottle is wide, but not very thick. Place the small\r\nbottle in as before, taking care not to have too much air in the\r\nbottom. If the cork is adjusted properly, the bottle may be held\r\nin the hand and the sides pressed with the fingers, thus causing\r\nthe small bottle to descend and ascend at will. If the small\r\nbottle used is opaque, or an opaque tube such as the cap of a\r\nfountain pen, many puzzling effects may be obtained. --Contributed\r\nby John Shahan, Auburn, Ala.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make an Inexpensive Wooden Fan [332]\r\n\r\nSelect a nice straight-grained piece of white pine about 1/4 in.\r\nthick, 3/4 in. wide and 4 in. long.

Its smaller parts, such as blades and pulleys, were\r\nconstructed of 1-in. sugar pine on account of its softness.\r\n\r\nThe eight blades were made from pieces 1 by 1-1/2 by 12 in. Two\r\nopposite edges were cut away until the blade was about 1/8 in.\r\nthick. Two inches\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Details of Miniature Windmill Construction]\r\n\r\nwere left uncut at the hub end. They were then nailed to the\r\ncircular face plate A, Fig. 1, which was 6 in. in diameter and 1\r\nin. thick. The center of the hub was lengthened by the wooden\r\ndisk, B, Fig. 1, which was nailed to the face plate. The shaft C,\r\nFig. 1, was 1/4-in. iron rod, 2 ft. long, and turned in the\r\nbearings detailed in Fig. 2. J was a nut from a wagon bolt and was\r\nplaced in the bearing to insure easy running. The bearing blocks\r\nwere 3 in. wide, 1 in. thick and 3 in. high without the upper\r\nhalf. Both bearings were made in this manner.\r\n\r\nThe shaft C was keyed to the hub of the wheel, by the method shown\r\nin Fig. 3. A staple, K, held the shaft from revolving in the hub.\r\nThis method was also applied in keying the 5-in. pulley F, to the\r\nshaft, G, Fig. 1, which extended to the ground. The 2-1/2-in.\r\npulley, I, Fig. 1, was keyed to shaft C, as shown in Fig. 4. The\r\nwire L was put through the hole in the axle and the two ends\r\ncurved so as to pass through the two holes in the pulley, after\r\nwhich they were given a final bend to keep the pulley in place.\r\nThe method by which the shaft C was kept from working forward is\r\nshown in Fig. 5. The washer M intervened between the bearing block\r\nand the wire N, which was passed through the axle and then bent to\r\nprevent its falling out. Two washers were placed on shaft C,\r\nbetween the forward bearing and the hub of the wheel to lessen the\r\nfriction.\r\n\r\nThe bed plate D, Fig. 1, was 2 ft. long, 3 in. wide and 1 in.\r\nthick and was tapered from the rear bearing to the slot in which\r\nthe fan E was nailed. This fan was made of 1/4-in. pine 18 by 12\r\nin. and was cut the shape shown. The two small iron pulleys with\r\nscrew bases, H, Fig. 1, were obtained for a small sum from a\r\nhardware dealer. Their diameter was 1-1/4 in. The belt which\r\ntransferred the power from shaft C to shaft G was top string, with\r\na section of rubber in it to take up slack. To prevent it from\r\nslipping on the two wooden pulleys a rubber band was placed in the\r\ngrooves of each.\r\n\r\nThe point for the swivel bearing was determined by balancing the\r\nbed plate, with all parts in place, across the thin edge of a\r\nboard. There a 1/4-in. hole was bored in which shaft G turned. To\r\nlessen the friction here, washers were placed under pulley F. The\r\nswivel bearing was made from two lids of baking powder cans. A\r\nsection was cut out of one to permit its being enlarged enough to\r\nadmit the other. The smaller one, 0, Fig. 6, was nailed top down\r\nwith the sharp edge to the underside of the bed plate, so that the\r\n1/4-in. hole for the shaft G was in the center. The other lid, G,\r\nwas tacked, top down also, in the center of the board P, with\r\nbrass headed furniture tacks, R, Fig. 6, which acted as a smooth\r\nsurface for the other tin to revolve upon. Holes for shaft G were\r\ncut through both lids. Shaft G was but 1/4 in. in diameter, but to\r\nkeep it from rubbing against the board P, a 1/2-in. hole was bored\r\nfor it, through the latter.\r\n\r\nThe tower was made of four 1 by 1 in. strips, 25 ft. long. They\r\nconverged from points on the ground forming an 8-ft. square to the\r\nboard P at the top of the tower. This board was 12 in. square and\r\nthe corners were notched to admit the strips as shown, Fig. 1.\r\nLaths were nailed diagonally between the strips to strengthen the\r\ntower laterally. Each strip was screwed to a stake in the ground\r\nso that by disconnecting two of them the other two could be used\r\nas hinges and the tower could be tipped over and lowered to the\r\nground, as, for instance, when the windmill needed oiling.\r\nBearings for the shaft G were placed 5 ft. apart in the tower. The\r\npower was put to various uses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Telegraph Instrument and Buzzer [334]\r\n\r\nThe only expenditure necessary in constructing this telegraph\r\ninstrument is the price of a dry cell, providing one has a few old\r\nmaterials on hand. Procure a block of wood about 6 in. long and 3\r\nin. wide and take the coils out of an old electric bell. If you\r\nhave no bell, one may be had at the dealers for a small sum.\r\nFasten these coils on the blocks at one end as in Fig. 1. Cut a\r\npiece of tin 2 in. long and 1/2 in. wide and bend it so the end of\r\nthe tin\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Home-Made Telegraph Instrurment]\r\n\r\nwhen fastened to the block will come just above the core of the\r\ncoil. Cut another piece of tin 3 in. long and bend it as shown at\r\nA, Fig. 2. Tack these two pieces of tin in front of the coils as\r\nshown in the illustration. This completes the receiver or sounder.\r\n\r\nTo make the key, cut out another piece of tin (X, Fig. 1) 4 in.\r\nlong and bend it as shown. Before tacking it to the board, cut off\r\nthe head of a nail and drive it in the board at a point where the\r\nloose end of the tin will cover it. Then tack the key to the board\r\nand connect the wires of the battery as in Fig. 1. Now, move the\r\ncoils back and forth until the click sounds just the way you wish\r\nand you are ready to begin on the Morse code.\r\n\r\nWhen tired of this instrument, connect the wire from the coils to\r\nthe key to point A and the one connected at the point under the\r\nkey to B, leaving the other wire as it is. By adjusting the coils,\r\nthe receiver will begin to vibrate rapidly, causing a buzzing\r\nsound.\r\n--Contributed by John R. McConnell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Water Bicycle [335]\r\n\r\nWater bicycles afford fine sport, and, like many another device\r\nboys make, can be made of material often cast off by their people\r\nas rubbish. The principle material necessary for the construction\r\nof a water bicycle is oil barrels. Flour barrels will not do-they\r\nare not strong enough, nor can they be made perfectly airtight.\r\nThe grocer can furnish you with oil barrels at a very small cost,\r\nprobably let you have them for making a few deliveries for him.\r\nThree barrels are required for the water bicycle, although it can\r\nbe made with but two. Figure 1 shows the method of arranging the\r\nbarrels; after the manner of bicycle wheels.\r\n\r\nProcure an old bicycle frame and make for it a board platform\r\nabout 3 ft. wide at the rear end and tapering to about 2 ft. at\r\nthe front, using cleats to hold the board frame, as shown at\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Water, Bicycle Complete]\r\n\r\nthe shaded portion K. The construction of the barrel part is shown\r\nin Fig. 2. Bore holes in the center of the heads of the two rear\r\nbarrels and also in the heads of the first barrel and put a shaft\r\nof wood, through the rear barrels and one through the front\r\nbarrel, adjusting the side pieces to the shafts, as indicated.\r\n\r\nNext place the platform of the bicycle frame and connections\r\nthereon. Going back to Fig. 1 we see that the driving chain passes\r\nfrom the sprocket driver L of the bicycle frame to the place\r\ndownward between the slits in the platform to the driven sprocket\r\non the shaft between the two barrels. Thus a center drive is made.\r\nThe rear barrels are, fitted with paddles as at M, consisting of\r\nfour pieces of board nailed\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Barrel Float for Bicycle]\r\n\r\nand deated about the circumference of the barrels, as shown in\r\nFig. 1.\r\n\r\nThe new craft is now ready for a first voyage. To propel it, seat\r\nyourself on the bicycle seat, feet on the pedals, just as you\r\nwould were you on a bicycle out in the street. The steering is\r\neffected by simply bending the body to the right or left, which\r\ncauses the craft to dip to the inclined side and the affair turns\r\nin the dipped direction. The speed is slow at first, but increases\r\nas the force is generated and as one becomes familiar with the\r\nworking of the affair. There is no danger, as the airtight barrels\r\ncannot possibly sink.\r\n\r\nAnother mode of putting together the set of barrels, using one\r\nlarge one in the rear and a small one in the front is presented in\r\nFig, 3. These two barrels are empty oil barrels like the others.\r\nThe head holes are bored and the proper wooden shafts are inserted\r\nand the entrance to the bores closed tight by calking with hemp\r\nand putty or clay. The ends of the shafts turn in the wooden frame\r\nwhere the required bores are made to receive the same. If the\r\njournals thus made are well oiled, there will not be much\r\nfriction. Such a frame can be fitted with a platform and a raft to\r\nsuit one\'s individual fancy built upon it, which can\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Another Type of Float]\r\n\r\nbe paddled about with ease and safety on any pond. A sail can be\r\nrigged up by using a mast and some sheeting; or even a little\r\nhouseboat, which will give any amount of pleasure, can be built.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How To Make a Small Searchlight [336]\r\n\r\nThe materials required for a small searchlight are a 4-volt lamp\r\nof the loop variety, thin sheet brass for the cylinder, copper\r\npiping and brass tubing for base. When completed the searchlight\r\nmay be fitted to a small boat and will afford a great amount\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Searchlight]\r\n\r\nof pleasure for a little work, or it may be put to other uses if\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\nMake a cylinder of wood of the required size and bend a sheet of\r\nthin brass around it. Shape small blocks of boxwood, D, Fig. 1, to\r\nfit the sides and pass stout pieces of brass wire through the\r\nmiddle of the blocks for trunnions. Exactly through the middle of\r\nthe sides of the cylinder drill holes just so large that when the\r\nblocks containing the trunnions are cemented to the cylinder there\r\nis no chance of contact between cylinder and trunnion, and so\r\ncreating a false circuit.\r\n\r\nThe trunnion should project slightly into the cylinder, and after\r\nthe lamp has been placed in position by means of the small wood\r\nblocks shown in Fig. 1, the wires from the lamp should be soldered\r\nto the trunnions. It is best to solder the wire to the trunnions\r\nbefore cementing the side blocks inside the cylinder.\r\n\r\nTurn a small circle of wood, A, Fig. 2, inside the cylinder to fit\r\nexactly and fasten to it a piece of mirror, C, Fig. 2, exactly the\r\nsame size to serve as a reflector. Painting the wood with white\r\nenamel or a piece of brightly polished metal will serve the\r\npurpose. On the back of the piece of wood fasten a small brass\r\nhandle, B, Fig. 2, so that it may readily be removed for cleaning.\r\n\r\nIn front of cylinder place a piece of magnifying glass for a lens.\r\nIf a piece\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Front View;  Side View]\r\n\r\nto fit cannot be obtained, fit a glass like a linen tester to a\r\nsmall disc of wood or brass to fit the cylinder. If magnifying\r\nglass cannot be had, use plain glass and fit them as follows:\r\n\r\nMake two rings of brass wire to fit tightly into the cylinder,\r\ntrace a circle (inside diameter of cylinder) on a piece of\r\ncardboard; place cardboard on glass and cut out glass with a glass\r\ncutter; break off odd corners with notches on cutters and grind\r\nthe edge of the glass on an ordinary red brick using plenty of\r\nwater. Place one brass ring in cylinder, then the glass disc and\r\nthen the other ring.\r\n\r\nFor the stand fill a piece of copper piping with melted rosin or\r\nlead. When hard bend the pipe around a piece of wood which has\r\nbeen sawed to the shape of bend desired. Then melt out the rosin\r\nor lead. Make an incision with a half-round file in the under side\r\nof the tube for the wires to come through. Make the base of wood\r\nas shown in Fig. 1. One half inch from the top bore a hole large\r\nenough to admit the copper pipe and a larger hole up the center to\r\nmeet it for the wires to come down.\r\n\r\nIf it is desired to make the light very complete, make the base of\r\ntwo pieces of brass tube--one being a sliding fit in the other and\r\nwith projecting pieces to prevent the cylinder from going too far.\r\nThe light may then be elevated or lowered as wished. On two\r\nordinary brass terminals twist or solder some flexible wire, but\r\nbefore doing so fix a little bone washer on the screws of the\r\nterminal so as to insulate it from the tube. When the wires have\r\nbeen secured to the terminals cover the joint with a piece of very\r\nthin india rubber tubing, such as is used for cycle valves. The\r\ntwo wires may now be threaded down the copper tube into the base,\r\nand pulled tight, the terminals firmly fixed into the tubes; if\r\ntoo small, some glue will secure them. To get the cylinder into\r\nits carriage, put one trunnion into the terminal as far as it will\r\ngo and this will allow room for the other trunnion to go in its\r\nterminal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Electric Alarm that Rings a Bell and Turns on a Light [337]\r\n\r\nThe illustration shows an alarm clock connected up to ring an\r\nelectric bell, and at the same time turn on an electric light to\r\nshow the time. The parts indicated are as follows: A, key of alarm\r\nclock; B, contact post, 4 in. long; C, shelf, 5-1/4 by 10 in.; D,\r\nbracket; E, electric bulb (3-1/2 volts) ; S, brass strip, 4-1/2\r\nin. long, 3/8 in. wide and 1/16 in. thick; T, switch; F, wire from\r\nbatteries to switch; G, wire from bell to switch; H, wire from\r\nlight to switch; I, dry batteries; J, bell; X, point where a\r\nsplice is made from the light to wire leading to batteries from\r\nbrass strip under clock. Push the switch lever to the right before\r\nretiring.\r\n\r\nTo operate this, set alarm key as shown in diagram, after two\r\nturns have been made on the key. When alarm goes off, it turns\r\ntill it forms a connection by striking the contact post and starts\r\nthe electric bell ringing. Throw lever off from the right to\r\ncenter, which stops bell ringing. To throw on light throw levers\r\nto the left. The bell is then cut out but the light remains on\r\ntill lever is again thrown in the center,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Details of Alarm Construction]\r\n\r\nIn placing clock on shelf, after setting alarm, be sure that the\r\nlegs of clock are on the brass strip and that the alarm key is in\r\nposition so it will come in contact with the contact post in back\r\nof clock. The contact post may be of 1/4-in. copper tubing, or\r\n1/4-in. brass rod.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of this is that one can control the bell and light,\r\nwhile lying in bed, by having the switch on the baseboard, near\r\nthe bed, so it can be reached without getting out of bed.\r\n--Contributed by Geo.

Make\r\na shoulder, as at A, Fig. 1, 4 in. from one end, making it as true\r\nand smooth as possible, as this is to be the muzzle of the cannon.\r\nMake the spindle as in Fig. 1, 1/4 in. in diameter. Procure a good\r\nquality of stiff paper, about 6 in. wide, and wrap it around the\r\nshoulder of the stick, letting it extend 3/4 in. beyond the end of\r\nthe spindle, as at B, Fig. 2. Push an ordinary shingle nail\r\nthrough the paper and into the extreme end of the spindle, as at\r\nA, Fig. 2. This is to form the fuse hole.\r\n\r\nHaving finished this, place stick and all in a pail of sand, being\r\ncareful not to get the sand in it, and letting the opening at the\r\ntop extend a little above the surface of the sand. Then fill the\r\npaper cylinder with melted lead and let cool. Pull out the nail\r\nand stick, scrape off the paper and the cannon is ready for\r\nmounting, as in Fig. 3.\r\n--Contributed by Chas. S.

There are a number of other small heaters which can be\r\neasily made and for which lamps form very suitable heating\r\nelements, but the bed warmer is probably the best example. All\r\nthat is required is a tin covering, which can be made of an old\r\ncan, about 3-1/2 in. in diameter. The top is cut out and the edge\r\nfiled smooth. The lamp-socket end of the flexible cord is inserted\r\nin the can and the shade holder gripped over the opening. A small\r\nlamp of about 5 cp. will do the heating.\r\n\r\nA flannel bag, large enough to slip over the tin can and provided\r\nwith a neck that can be drawn together by means of a cord, gives\r\nthe heater a more finished appearance, as well as making it more\r\npleasant to the touch.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Making a Fire with the Aid of Ice [338]\r\n\r\nTake a piece of very clear ice and melt it down into the hollow of\r\nyour hands so as to form a large lens.

The\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Details of the Bow-Gun and Arrow Sling]\r\n\r\nmaterial must be 1-1/2 in. thick, 6 in. wide and a trifle over 3\r\nft. long. The bow is made from straight-grained oak, ash, or\r\nhickory, 5/8 in. thick, 1 in. wide and 3 ft. long. A piece of oak,\r\n3/8 in. thick, 1-1/2 in. wide and 6 ft. long, will be sufficient\r\nto make the trigger, spring and arrows. A piece of tin, some nails\r\nand a good cord will complete the materials necessary to make the\r\ncrossbow.\r\n\r\nThe piece of maple or pine selected for the stock must be planed\r\nand sandpapered on both sides, and then marked and cut as shown in\r\nFig. 1. A groove is cut for the arrows in the top straight edge\r\n3/8 in. wide and 3/8 in. deep. The tin is bent and fastened on the\r\nwood at the back end of the groove where the cord slips out of the\r\nnotch; this is to keep the edges from splitting.\r\n\r\nA mortise is cut for the bow at a point 9-1/2 in. from the end of\r\nthe stock, and one for the trigger 12 in. from the opposite end,\r\nwhich should be slanting a little as shown by the dotted lines. A\r\nspring, Fig. 2, is made from a good piece of oak and fastened to\r\nthe stock with two screws. The trigger, Fig. 3, which is 1/4 in.\r\nthick, is inserted in the mortise in the position when pulled\r\nback, and adjusted so as to raise the spring to the proper height,\r\nand then a pin is put through both stock and trigger, having the\r\nlatter swing quite freely. When the trigger is pulled, it lifts\r\nthe spring up, which in turn lifts the cord off the tin notch.\r\n\r\nThe stick for the bow, Fig. 4, is dressed down from a point 3/4\r\nin. on each side of the center line to 1/2 in. wide at each end.\r\nNotches are cut in the ends for the cord. The bow is not fastened\r\nin the stock, it is wrapped with a piece of canvas 1-1/2 in. wide\r\non the center line to make a tight fit in the mortise. A stout\r\ncord is now tied in the notches cut in the ends of the bow making\r\nthe cord taut when the wood is straight.\r\n\r\nThe design of the arrows is shown in Fig. 5 and they are made with\r\nthe blades much thinner than the round part.\r\n\r\nTo shoot the crossbow, pull the cord back and down in the notch as\r\nshown in Fig. 6, place the arrow in the groove, sight and pull the\r\ntrigger as in shooting an ordinary gun.\r\n\r\nThe arrow sling is made from a branch of ash about 1/2 in. in\r\ndiameter, the bark removed and a notch cut in one end, as shown in\r\nFig. 7. A stout cord about 2-1/2 ft. long is tied in the notch and\r\na large knot made in the other or loose end.

Such a temporary safe light may be made from an\r\nempty cigar box in a short time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lantern]\r\n\r\nRemove the bottom of the box, and nail it in position as shown at\r\nA. Remove one end, and replace as shown at B. Drive a short wire\r\nnail through the center of the opposite end to serve as a seat for\r\nthe candle, C. The lamp is finished by tacking two or more layers\r\nof yellow post-office paper over the aperture D, bringing the\r\npaper well around to the sides and bottom of the box to prevent\r\nlight leakage from the cracks around the edges, says Photo Era.\r\nThe hinged cover E, is used as a door, making lighting and\r\ntrimming convenient. The door may be fastened with a nail or piece\r\nof wire. It is well to reinforce the hinge by gluing on a strip of\r\ncloth if the lamp is to be in use more than once or twice. This\r\nlamp is safe, for the projecting edges of A and B form\r\nlight-shields for the ventilation orifice and the crack at the top\r\nof the hinged cover, respectively. Moreover, since the flame of\r\nthe candle is above A, only reflected and transmitted light\r\nreaches the plate, while the danger of igniting the paper is\r\nreduced to a minimum.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Runny Paint [340]\r\n\r\nThe paint will sag and run if too much oil is put in white lead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Camps and How to Build Them [341]\r\n\r\nThere are several ways of building a temporary camp from material\r\nthat is always to be found in the woods, and whether these\r\nimprovised shelters are intended to last until a permanent camp is\r\nbuilt, or only as a camp on a short excursion, a great deal of fun\r\ncan be had in their construction. The Indian camp is the easiest\r\nto make. An evergreen tree with branches growing well down toward\r\nthe ground furnishes all the material. By chopping the trunk\r\nalmost through, so that when the tree falls the upper part will\r\nstill remain attached to the stump, a serviceable shelter can be\r\nquickly provided. The cut should be about 5 ft. from the ground.\r\nThen the boughs and branches on the under side of the fallen top\r\nare chopped away and piled on top. There is room for several\r\npersons under this sort of shelter, which offers fairly good\r\nprotection against any but the most drenching rains.\r\n\r\nThe Indian wigwam sheds rain better, and where there are no\r\nsuitable trees that can be cut, it is the easiest camp to make.\r\nThree long poles with the tops tied together and the lower ends\r\nspaced 8 or 10 ft. apart, make the frame of the wigwam. Branches\r\nand brush can easily be piled up, and woven in and out on these\r\npoles so as to shed a very heavy rain.\r\n\r\nThe brush camp is shaped like an ordinary "A" tent. The ridge pole\r\nshould be about 8 ft. long and supported by crotched uprights\r\nabout 6 ft. from the ground. Often the ridge pole can be laid from\r\none small tree to another. Avoid tall trees on account of\r\nlightning. Eight or ten long poles are then laid slanting against\r\nthe ridge pole on each side. Cedar or hemlock boughs make the best\r\nthatch for the brush camp. They should be piled up to a thickness\r\nof a foot or more over the slanting poles and woven in and out to\r\nkeep them from slipping. Then a number of poles should be laid\r\nover them to prevent them from blowing away. In woods where there\r\nis plenty of bark available in large slabs, the bark lean-to is a\r\nquickly constructed and serviceable camp. The ridge pole is set up\r\nlike that of the brush camp. Three or four other poles are laid\r\nslanting to the ground on one side only. The ends of these poles\r\nshould be pushed into the earth and fastened with crotched sticks.\r\nLong poles are then laid crossways of these slanting poles, and\r\nthe whole can be covered with brush as in the case of the brush\r\ncamp or with strips of bark laid overlapping each other like\r\nshingles. Where bark is used, nails are necessary to hold it in\r\nplace. Bark may also be used for a wigwam and it can be held in\r\nplace by a cord wrapped tightly around the whole structure,\r\nrunning spiral-wise from the ground to the peak. In the early\r\nsummer, the bark can easily be removed from most trees by making\r\ntwo circular cuts around the trunk and joining them with another\r\nvertical cut. The bark is easily pried off with an ax, and if laid\r\non the ground under heavy stones, will dry flat. Sheets of bark, 6\r\nft. long and 2 or 3 ft. wide, are a convenient size for camp\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\nThe small boughs and twigs of hemlock, spruce, and cedar, piled 2\r\nor 3 ft. deep and covered with blankets, make the best kind of a\r\ncamp bed. For a permanent camp, a bunk can be made by laying small\r\npoles close together across two larger poles on a rude framework\r\neasily constructed. Evergreen twigs or dried leaves are piled on\r\nthis, and a blanket or a piece of canvas stretched across and\r\nfastened down to the poles at the sides. A bed like this is soft\r\nand springy and will last through an ordinary camping season\r\nwithout renewal. A portable cot that does not take up much room in\r\nthe camp outfit is made of a piece of heavy canvas 40 in. wide and\r\n6 ft. long. Four-inch hems are sewed in each side of the canvas,\r\nand when the camp is pitched, a 2-in. pole is run through each hem\r\nand the ends of the pole supported on crotched sticks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Camp Details]\r\n\r\nFresh water close at hand and shade for the middle of the day are\r\ntwo points that should always be looked for in. selecting a site\r\nfor a camp. If the camp is to be occupied for any length of time,\r\nuseful implements for many purposes can be made out of such\r\nmaterial as the woods afford. The simplest way to build a crane\r\nfor hanging kettles over the campfire is to drive two posts into\r\nthe ground, each of them a foot or more from one end of the fire\r\nspace, and split the tops with an ax, so that a pole laid from one\r\nto the other across the fire will be securely held in the split.\r\nTongs are very useful in camp. A piece of elm or hickory, 3 ft.\r\nlong and 1-1/2 in. thick, makes a good pair of tongs. For a foot\r\nin the middle of the stick, cut half of the thickness away and\r\nhold this part over the fire until it can be bent easily to bring\r\nthe two ends together, then fasten a crosspiece to hold the ends\r\nclose together, shape the ends so that anything that drops into\r\nthe fire can be seized by them, and a serviceable pair of tongs is\r\nthe result. Any sort of a stick that is easily handled will serve\r\nas a poker. Hemlock twigs tied around one end of a stick make an\r\nexcellent broom. Movable seats for a permanent camp are easily\r\nmade by splitting a log, boring holes in the rounded side of the\r\nslab and driving pegs into them to serve as legs. A short slab or\r\nplank can easily be made into a three-legged stool in the same\r\nway.\r\n\r\nCampers usually have boxes in which their provisions have been\r\ncarried. Such a packing box is easily made into a cupboard, and it\r\nis not difficult to improvise shelves, hinges, or even a rough\r\nlock for the camp larder.\r\n\r\nA good way to make a camp table is to set four posts into the\r\nground and nail crosspieces to support slabs cut from chopped wood\r\nlogs to form a top. Pieces can be nailed onto the legs of the\r\ntable to hold other slabs to serve as seats, and affording\r\naccommodation for several persons.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Brooder for Small Chicks [343]\r\n\r\nA very simple brooder can be constructed by cutting a sugar barrel\r\nin half and using one part in the manner\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Brooder for Young Chicks Kept Warm with a Jug of\r\nBoiling Water]\r\n\r\ndescribed. Line the inside of the half  barrel with paper and then\r\ncover this with old flannel cloth. Make a cover for the top and\r\nline it in the same manner. At the bottom cut a hole in the edge,\r\nabout 4 in. deep and 4 in. wide, and provide a cover or door. The\r\ninside is kept warm by filling a jug with boiling water and\r\nsetting it within, changing the water both morning and night. When\r\nthe temperature outside is 10 deg. the interior can, be kept at 90\r\nor 100 deg., but the jug must be refilled with boiling water at\r\nleast twice a day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Faucet Used as an Emergency Plug [343]\r\n\r\nA brass faucet split as shown at A during a cold spell, and as no\r\nsuitable plug to screw into the elbow after removing the faucet\r\nwas at hand, I drove a small cork, B, into the end of the faucet\r\nand screwed it back in place. The cork converted the faucet into\r\nan\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Tight-Fitting Cork Driven into a Cracked Faucet\r\nConverted It into an Emergency Plug]\r\n\r\nemergency plug which prevented leakage until the proper fitting to\r\ntake its place could be secured.\r\n--Contributed by James M. Kane, Doylestown, Pa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Automatic Electric Heat Regulator [344]\r\n\r\nIt is composed of a closed glass tube, A, Fig. 1, connected by\r\nmeans of a very small lead pipe, B, to another\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Heat Regulator]\r\n\r\nglass tube, C, open at the bottom and having five pieces of\r\nplatinum wire (1, 2, 3, 4 and 5), which project inside and outside\r\nof the tube, fused into one side. This tube is plunged into an\r\nebonite vessel of somewhat larger diameter, which is fastened to\r\nthe base by a copper screw, E. The tube C is filled to a certain\r\nheight with mercury and then petroleum. The outer ends of the five\r\nplatinum wires are soldered to ordinary copper wires and\r\nconnections made to various points on a rheostat as shown. The\r\ndiagram, Fig. 2, shows how the connections to the supply current\r\nare made. The apparatus operates as follows: The tube is immersed\r\nin the matter to be heated, a liquid, for instance. As\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wiring Diagram Showing How the Connections to a\r\nSource of Current Supply are Made]\r\n\r\nthe temperature of this rises, the air expands and exerts pressure\r\non the petroleum in the tube C so that the level of the mercury is\r\nlowered. The current is thus compelled, as the platinum wires with\r\nthe fall of the mercury are brought out of circuit, to pass\r\nthrough an increasing resistance, until, if necessary, the flow is\r\nentirely stopped when the mercury falls below the wire 5.\r\n\r\nWith this very simple apparatus the temperature can be kept\r\nconstant within a 10-deg. limit, and it can be made much more\r\nsensitive by increasing the number of platinum wires and placing\r\nthem closer together, and by filling the tube A with some very\r\nvolatile substance, such as ether, for instance. The petroleum\r\nabove the mercury prevents sparking between the platinum wire and\r\nthe mercury when the latter falls below anyone of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Repairing a Washer on a Flush Valve [344]\r\n\r\nWhen the rubber washer on the copper flush valve of a soil-basin\r\ntank becomes loose it can be set by pouring a small quantity of\r\nparaffin between the rubber and the copper while the valve is\r\ninverted, care being taken to have the rubber ring centered. This\r\nmakes\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Flush Valve]\r\n\r\na repair that will not allow a drop ot water to leak out of the\r\ntank.\r\n--Contributed by Frank Jermin, Alpena, Michigan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Cleaning Discolored Silver [344]\r\n\r\nA very quick way to clean silver when it is not tarnished, but\r\nmerely discolored, is to wash the articles in a weak solution of\r\nammonia water. This removes the black stains caused by sulphur in\r\nthe air. After cleaning them with the solution, they should be\r\nwashed and polished in magnesia powder or with a cloth. This\r\nmethod works well on silver spoons tarnished by eggs and can be\r\nused every day while other methods require much time and,\r\ntherefore, cannot be used so often.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Small Electric Motor [345]\r\nBy W. A. ROBERTSON\r\n\r\nThe field frame of the motor, Fig. 1, is composed of wrought sheet\r\niron, which may be of any thickness so that, when several pieces\r\nare placed together, they will make a frame 3/4 in. thick. It is\r\nnecessary to layout a template of the frame as shown, making it\r\n1/16 in. larger than the dimensions given, to allow for filing to\r\nshape after the parts are fastened together. After the template is\r\nmarked out, drill the four rivet holes, clamp the template, or\r\npattern, to the sheet iron and mark carefully with a scriber. The\r\nbore can be marked with a pair of dividers, set at 1/8 in. This\r\nwill mark a line for the center of the holes to be drilled with a\r\n1/4-in. drill for removing the unnecessary metal. The points\r\nformed by drilling the holes can be filed to the pattern size. Be\r\nsure to mark and cut out a sufficient number of plates to make a\r\nframe 3/4 in. thick, or even 1/16 in. thicker, to allow for\r\nfinishing.\r\n\r\nAfter the plates are cut out and the rivet holes drilled, assemble\r\nand rivet them solidly, then bore it out to a diameter of 2-3/4\r\nin. on a lathe. If the thickness is sufficient, a slight finishing\r\ncut can be taken on the face. Before removing the field from the\r\nlathe, mark off a space, 3-3/8 in. in diameter, for the field core\r\nwith a sharp-pointed tool, and for the outside of the frame, 4-1/2\r\nin. in diameter, by turning the lathe with the hand. Then the\r\nfield can be finished to these marks, which will make it uniform\r\nin size. When the frame is finished so far, two holes, 3-3/8 in.\r\nbetween centers, are drilled and tapped with a 3/8-in. tap. These\r\nholes are for the bearing studs. Two holes are also drilled and\r\ntapped for 1/4-in. screws, which fasten the holding-down lugs or\r\nfeet to the frame. These lugs are made of a piece of 1/8-in. brass\r\nor iron, bent at right angles as shown.\r\n\r\nThe bearing studs are now made, as shown in Fig. 2, and turned\r\ninto the threaded holes in the frame. The bearing supports are\r\nmade of two pieces of 1/8-in. brass, as shown in the left-hand\r\nsketch, Fig. 3, which are fitted on the studs in the frame. A\r\n5/8-in. hole is\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Field-Coil Core is Built Up of Laminated\r\nWrought Iron Riveted Together]\r\n\r\ndrilled in the center of each of these supports, into which a\r\npiece of 5/8-in. brass rod is inserted, soldered into place, and\r\ndrilled to receive the armature shaft. These bearings should be\r\nfitted and soldered in place after the armature is constructed.\r\nThe manner of doing this is to wrap a piece of paper on the\r\noutside of the finished armature ring and place it through the\r\nopening in the field, then slip the bearings on the ends of the\r\nshaft. If the holes in the bearing support should be out of line,\r\nfile them out to make the proper adjustment. When the bearings are\r\nlocated, solder them to the supports, and build up the solder\r\nwell. Remove\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Bearing Studs are Turned from Machine Steel Two\r\nof Each Length being Required]\r\n\r\nthe paper from the armature ring and see that the armature\r\nrevolves freely in the bearings without touching the inside of the\r\nfield at any point. The supports are then removed and the solder\r\nturned up in a lathe, or otherwise finished. The shaft of the\r\narmature, Fig. 4, is turned up from machine steel, leaving the\r\nfinish of the bearings until the armature is completed and\r\nfastened to the shaft.\r\n\r\nThe armature core is made up as\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Assembled Bearing Frame on the Field Core and\r\nthe Armature Shaft Made of Machine Steel]\r\n\r\nfollows: Two pieces of wrought sheet iron, 1/8 in. thick, are cut\r\nout a little larger than called for by the dimensions given in\r\nFig. 5, to allow for finishing to size. These are used for the\r\noutside plates and enough pieces of No. 24 gauge sheet iron to\r\nfill up the part between until the whole is over 3/4 in. thick are\r\ncut like the pattern. After the pieces are cut out, clamp them\r\ntogether and drill six 1/8-in. holes through them for rivets.\r\nRivet them together, and anneal the whole piece by placing it in a\r\nfire and heating the metal to a cherry red, then allowing it to\r\ncool in the ashes. When annealed, bore out the inside to 1-11/16\r\nin. in diameter and fit in a brass spider, which is made as\r\nfollows: Procure a piece of brass, 3/4 in. thick, and turn it up\r\nto the size shown and file out the metal between the arms. Slip\r\nthe spider on the armature shaft and secure it solidly with the\r\nsetscrew so that the shaft will not turn in the spider when truing\r\nup the armature core. File grooves or slots in the armature ring\r\nso that it will fit on the arms of the spider. Be sure to have the\r\ninside of the armature core run true. When this is accomplished,\r\nsolder the arms of the spider to the metal of the armature core.\r\nThe shaft with the core is then put in a lathe and the outside\r\nturned off to the proper size. The sides are also faced off and\r\nfinished. Make the core 3/4 in. thick. Remove the core from the\r\nlathe and file out slots 1/4 in. deep and 7/16 in. wide.\r\n\r\nThe commutator is turned from a piece of brass pipe, 3/4 in.\r\ninside diameter, as shown in Fig. 6; The piece is placed on a\r\nmandrel and turned to 3/4 in. in length and both ends chamfered to\r\nan angle of 60 deg. Divide the surface into 12 equal parts, or\r\nsegments. Find the centers of each segment at one end, then drill\r\na 1/8-in. hole and tap it for a pin. The pins are made of brass,\r\nthreaded, turned into place and the ends turned in a lathe to an\r\noutside diameter of 1-1/4 in. Make a slit with a small saw blade\r\nin the end of each pin for the ends of the wires coming from the\r\ncommutator coils. Saw the ring into the 12 parts on the lines\r\nbetween the pins.\r\n\r\nThe two insulating ends for holding these segments are made of\r\nfiber turned to fit the bore of the brass tubing, as shown in Fig.\r\n7. Procure 12 strips of mica, the same thickness as the width of\r\nthe saw cut made between the segments, and use them as a filler\r\nand insulation between the commutator\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Armature-Ring Core, Its Hub and the Construction of\r\nthe Commutator and Its Insulation]\r\n\r\nbars. Place them on the fiber hub and slip the hub on the shaft,\r\nthen clamp the whole in place with the nut, as shown in Fig. 3.\r\nTrue up the commutator in a lathe to the size given in Fig. 6.\r\n\r\nThe brush holder is shaped from apiece of fiber, as shown in Fig.\r\n8. The studs for holding the brushes are cut from 5/16-in. brass\r\nrod, as shown in Fig. 9. The brushes consist of brass or copper\r\nwire gauze, rolled up and flattened out to 1/8 in. thick and 1/4\r\nin. wide, one end being soldered to keep the wires in place. The\r\nholder is slipped on the projecting outside end of the bearing, as\r\nshown m Fig. 3, and held with a setscrew.\r\n\r\nThe field core is insulated before winding with 1/64-in. sheet\r\nfiber, washers, 1-1/8 in. by 1-1/2 in., being formed for the ends,\r\nwith a hole cut in them to fit over the insulation placed on the\r\ncores. A slit is cut through from the hole to the outside, and\r\nthen they are soaked in warm water, until they become flexible\r\nenough to be put in place. After they have dried, they are glued\r\nto the core insulation.\r\n\r\nThe field is wound with No. 18 gauge double-cotton-covered magnet\r\nwire, about 100 ft. being required. Drill a small hole through\r\neach of the lower end insulating washers. In starting to wind,\r\ninsert the end of the wire through the hole from the inside at A\r\nFig. 1, and wind on four layers, which will take 50 ft. of the\r\nwire, and bring the end of the wire out at B. After one coil, or\r\nside, is wound start at C in the same manner as at A, using the\r\nsame number of turns and the same length of wire. The two ends are\r\njoined at B.\r\n\r\nThe armature ring is insulated by covering the inside and brass\r\nspider with 1/16-in. sheet fiber. Two rings of 1/16-in sheet fiber\r\nare cut and glued to the sides of the ring. When the glue is set,\r\ncut out the part within the slot ends and make 12 channel pieces\r\nfrom 1/64-in. sheet fiber, which are glued in the slots and to the\r\nfiber washers. Be sure to have the ring and spider covered so the\r\nwire will not touch the iron or brass.\r\n\r\nEach slot of the armature is wound with about 12 ft. of No. 21\r\ngauge double-cotton-covered magnet wire. The winding is started at\r\nA, Fig. 5, by bending the end around one of the projections, then\r\nwind the coil in one of the slots as shown, making 40 turns or\r\nfour layers of 10 turns each shellacking each layer as it is\r\nwound. After the coil is completed in one slot allow about 2 in.\r\nof the end to protrude, to\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Insulated Brush Holder and Its Studs for\r\nHolding the Brushes on the Commutator]\r\n\r\nfasten to the commutator segment. Wind the next slot with the same\r\nnumber of turns in the same manner and so on, until the 12 slots\r\nare filled. The protruding ends of the coils are connected to the\r\npins in the commutator segments after the starting end of one\r\ncoils is joined to the finishing end of the next adjacent. All\r\nconnections should be securely soldered.\r\n\r\nThe whole motor is fastened with screws to a wood base, 8 in.\r\nlong, 6 in. wide and 1 in. thick. Two terminals are fastened at\r\none side on the base and a switch at the other side.\r\n\r\nTo connect the wires, after the motor is on the stand, the two\r\nends of the wire, shown at B, Fig. 1, are soldered together. Run\r\none end of the field wire, shown at A, through a small hole in the\r\nbase and make a groove on the under side so that the wire end can\r\nbe connected to one of the terminals The other end of the field\r\nwire C is connected to the brass screw in the brass brush stud.\r\nConnect a wire from the other brush stud, run it through a small\r\nhole in the base and cut a groove for it on the under side so that\r\nit can be connected through the switch and the other terminal.\r\nThis winding is for a series motor. The source of current is\r\nconnected to the terminals. The motor can be run on a 110-volt\r\ndirect current, but a resistance must be placed in series with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Protecting Tinware [347]\r\n\r\nNew tinware rubbed over with fresh lard and heated will never\r\nrust.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Another Optical Illusion [348]\r\n\r\nAfter taking a look at the accompanying illustration you will be\r\npositive that the cords shown run in a spiral toward the center,\r\nyet it shows a series of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Cord Is Not a Spiral]\r\n\r\nperfect circles of cords placed one inside the other. You can test\r\nthis for yourself in a moment with a pair of compasses, or, still\r\nmore simply, by laying a point of a pencil on any part of the cord\r\nand following it round. Instead of approaching or receding from\r\nthe center in a continuous line, as in the case of a spiral, you\r\nwill find the pencil returning to the point from which it started.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Substitute for Insulating Cleats [348]\r\n\r\nIn wiring up door bells, alarms and telephones as well as\r\nexperimental\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Insulators]\r\n\r\nwork the use of common felt gun wads make a very good cleat for\r\nthe wires. They are used in the manner illustrated in the\r\naccompanying sketch. The insulated wire is placed between two wads\r\nand fastened with two nails or screws. If one wad on the back is\r\nnot thick enough to keep the wire away from the support, put on\r\ntwo wads behind and one in front of the wire and fasten in the\r\nsame manner as described.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Electrically Operated Indicator for a Wind Vane [348]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying photograph shows a wind vane connected with\r\nelectric wires to an instrument at considerable distance which\r\nindicates by means of a magnetic needle the direction of the wind.\r\nThe bearings of the vane consist of the head of a wornout bicycle.\r\nA 1/2-in. iron pipe extends from the vane and is held in place by\r\nthe clamp originally used to secure the handle bar of the bicycle.\r\nIn place of the forks is attached an eight-cylinder gas engine\r\ntimer which is slightly altered in such a manner that the brush is\r\nat all times in contact, and when pointing between two contacts\r\nconnects them both. Nine wires run from the timer, one from each\r\nof the eight contacts, and one, which serves as the ground wire,\r\nis fastened to the metallic body. The timer is set at such a\r\nposition that when the vane points directly north, the brush of\r\nthe timer makes a connection in the middle of a contact. When the\r\ntimer is held in this position the brush will make connections\r\nwith each of the contacts as the vane revolves.\r\n\r\nThe indicating device which is placed in a convenient place in the\r\nhouse consists of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Wind Vane, Magnets and Indicator]\r\n\r\neight 4-ohm magnets fastened upon a l-in. board. These magnets are\r\nplaced in a 10-in. circle, 45 deg. apart and with their faces\r\npointing toward the center. Covering these is a thin, wood board\r\nupon which is fastened a neatly drawn dial resembling a mariner\'s\r\ncompass card. This is placed over the magnets in such a manner\r\nthat there will be a magnet under each of the eight principal\r\npoints marked on the dial. Over this dial is a magnetic needle or\r\npointer, 6 in. long, perfectly balanced on the end of a standard\r\nand above all is placed a cover having a glass top. The eight\r\nwires from the timer contacts connect with the outside wires of\r\nthe eight magnets separately and the inside wires from the magnets\r\nconnect with the metal brace which holds the magnets in place. A\r\nwire is then connected from the metal brace to a push button, two\r\nor three cells of dry battery and to the ground wire in connection\r\nwith the timer The wires are connected in such a manner that when\r\nthe vane is pointing in a certain direction the battery will be\r\nconnected in series with the coil under that part of the dial\r\nrepresenting the direction in which the vane is pointing, thus\r\nmagnetizing the core of the magnet which attracts the opposite\r\npole of the needle toward the face of the magnet and indicating\r\nthe way the wind is blowing. The pointer end of the needle is\r\npainted black.\r\n\r\nIf the vane points in such a direction that the timer brush\r\nconnects two contacts, two magnets will be magnetized and the\r\nneedle will point midway between the two lines represented on the\r\ndial, thus giving 16 different directions. Around the pointer end\r\nof the needle is wound a fine copper wire, one end of which\r\nextends down to about 1/32 in. of the dial. This wire holds the\r\nneedle in place when the pointer end is directly over the magnet\r\nattracting it; the magnet causing the needle to "dip" will bring\r\nthe wire in contact with the paper dial. Without this attachment,\r\nthe needle would swing a few seconds before coming to a\r\nstandstill.\r\n\r\nThe vane itself is easily constructed as can be seen in the\r\nillustration. It should be about 6 ft. long to give the best\r\nresults. The magnets used can be purchased from any electrical\r\nstore in pairs which are called "instrument magnets." Any\r\nautomobile garage can supply the timer and an old valueless\r\nbicycle frame is not hard to find. The cover is easily made from a\r\npicture frame with four small boards arranged to take the place of\r\nthe picture as shown.\r\n\r\nThe outfit is valuable to a person who is situated where a vane\r\ncould not be placed so as to be seen from a window and especially\r\nat night when it is hard to determine the direction of the wind.\r\nBy simply pressing the push button on the side of the cover, the\r\nneedle will instantly point to the part of the dial from which the\r\nwind is blowing.\r\n--Contributed by James L.

Cut 3-in. squares out of the\r\nfour corners of the carpet and place the box squarely on it. Turn\r\nthree of the flaps of the carpet up and tack them securely to the\r\nsides of the box. Before tacking the fourth side, fold a couple of\r\nnewspapers to the right size and shove them in between the carpet\r\nand the bottom of the box for a cushion. Fill the box with any\r\nhandy ballast, making it heavy or light, according to who is going\r\nto use it, and securely nail on the top of the box. The handle can\r\nbe made from an old broom handle the whole of which will be none\r\ntoo long. Drive a heavy screw eye into the big end of the handle\r\nand fasten to the polisher by a staple driven through the eye into\r\nthe center of the cover, thus making a universal joint. The size\r\nof the box given here is the best although any size near that, if\r\nnot too high, will answer the purpose just as well. The box is\r\npushed or pulled over the floor and the padded side will produce a\r\nfine polish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Lady\'s Card-Case [350]\r\n\r\nA card-case such as is shown here makes a very appropriate present\r\nfor any lady. To make it, secure a piece of "ooze" calf skin\r\nleather 4-1/2 by 10-1/2 in. The one shown in the accompanying\r\npicture was made of a rich tan ooze of light weight and was lined\r\nwith a grey-green goat skin. The design was stenciled and the open\r\nparts backed with a green silk plush having a rather heavy nap.\r\nThe lining of goat skin need not cover more than the central\r\npart-not the flies. A piece 4-1/2 by 5\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Design for the Cover of Lady\'s Card-Case]\r\n\r\nin. will be sufficient. A piece of plush 1-1/4 by 6 in. will be\r\nenough for the two sides. Begin work by shaping the larger piece\r\nof leather as shown in the drawing. Allow a little margin at the\r\ntop and bottom, however, to permit trimming the edges slightly\r\nafter the parts have been sewed together. A knife or a pair of\r\nscissors will do to cut the leather with, though a special knife,\r\ncalled a chip carving knife, is most satisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe next thing is to put in the marks for the outline of the\r\ndesigns and the borders. A tool having a point shaped as in the\r\nillustration is commonly used. It is called a modeling tool for\r\nleather and may be purchased, or, one can be made from an ordinary\r\nnut pick by taking off the sharpness with fine emery paper so that\r\nit will not cut the leather. To work these outlines, first moisten\r\nthe leather on the back with as much water as it will take and\r\nstill not show through on the face side. Place the leather on some\r\nlevel, nonabsorbent surface and with the tool--and a straightedge\r\non the straight lines--indent the leather as shown. The easiest\r\nway is to place the paper pattern on the leather and mark on the\r\npaper. The indentations will be transferred without the necessity\r\nof putting any lines on the leather.\r\n\r\nWith the knife cut out the stencils as shown. Paste the silk plush\r\nto the inner side, being careful not to get any of the paste so\r\nfar out that it will show. A good leather paste will be required.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Leather Tools]\r\n\r\nNext place the lining, fold the flies along the lines indicated in\r\nthe drawing. Hold the parts together and stitch them on a\r\nsewing-machine. An ordinary sewing-machine will do if a good stout\r\nneedle is used. A silk thread that will match the leather should\r\nbe used. Keep the ooze side of the lining\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Complete Card Case]\r\n\r\nout so that it will show, rather than the smooth side. With the\r\nknife and straightedge trim off the surplus material at the top\r\nand bottom and the book is ready for use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Home-Made Fire Extinguisher [351]\r\n\r\nDissolve 20 lb. of common salt and 10 lb. of sal ammoniac in 7\r\ngal. of water, and put the solution in thin glass bottles, cork\r\ntightly and seal to prevent evaporation. The bottles should hold\r\nabout 1 qt. If a fire breaks out, throw one of the bottles in or\r\nnear the flames, or break off the neck and scatter the contents on\r\nthe fire. It may be necessary to use several bottles to quench the\r\nflames.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Crutch Made of an Old Broom [352]\r\n\r\nAn emergency crutch made of a worn-out broom is an excellent\r\nsubstitute for a wood crutch, especially when one or more crutches\r\nare needed for a short time, as in cases of a sprained ankle,\r\ntemporary lameness, or a hip that has been wrenched.\r\n\r\nShorten and hollow out the brush of the broom and then pad the\r\nhollow part with cotton batting, covering it with a piece of cloth\r\nsewed in place. Such a crutch does not heat the arm pit and there\r\nis an elasticity about it not to be had in the wooden crutch. The\r\ncrutch can be made to fit either child or adult and owing to its\r\ncheapness, can be thrown away when no longer needed. --Contributed\r\nby Katharine D. Morse, Syracuse, N. Y.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Crutch]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Toy Darts and Parachutes [352]\r\n\r\nA dart (Fig. 1) is made of a cork having a tin cap, a needle and\r\nsome feathers. The needle is run through the center of the cork A\r\nand a pin or piece of steel is put through the eye of the needle.\r\nTake a quantity of small\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dart Parts and Paper Parachute]\r\n\r\nfeathers, B, and tie them together securely at the bottom. Bore a\r\nhole in the center of the cap C, and fasten the feathers inside of\r\nit. Fasten the cap on the cork and the dart is ready for use. When\r\nthrowing the dart at a target stand from 6 to 10 ft. away from it.\r\n\r\nThe parachute is made by cutting a piece of paper 15 in. square\r\nand tying a piece of string to each corner. The strings should be\r\nabout 15 in. long. Tie all four strings together in a knot at the\r\nend and fasten them in the top of a cork with a small tack. It is\r\nbest to be as high as possible when flying the parachute as the\r\nair currents will sail it high and fast. Take hold of the\r\nparachute by the cork and run it through the air with the wind,\r\nletting it go at arm\'s length.\r\n--Contributed by J.

There is a 1-in. board all around\r\nthe bottom on the inside. I used wire mesh having 1/2-in. openings\r\nand formed it into the shape of a large tray with edges 6 in.\r\nhigh, the corners being wired, and tacked it to the boards. This\r\nnot only keeps the rats out, but prevents the chickens from\r\ndigging holes, thus helping the rats to enter.\r\n--Contributed by John A. Hellwig, Albany, N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Homemade Telephone Receiver [353]\r\n\r\nThe receiver illustrated herewith is to be used in connection with\r\nthe transmitter described elsewhere in this volume. The body of\r\nthe receiver, A, is made of a large wooden ribbon spool. One end\r\nis removed entirely, the other sawed in two on the line C and a\r\nflange, F, is cut on the wood, 1/8 in. wide and 1/16 in. deep. A\r\nflange the same size is made on the end D that was sawed off, and\r\nthe outside part tapered toward the hole as shown. The magnet is\r\nmade of a 30-penny nail, B, cut to the length of the spool, and a\r\ncoil of wire, E, wound on the head end. The coil is 1 in. long,\r\nmade up of four layers of No. 22 gauge copper magnet wire,\r\nallowing the ends to extend out about 6 in. The nail with the coil\r\nis then put into the hole of the spool as shown. The diaphragm C,\r\nwhich is the essential part of the instrument, should be made as\r\ncarefully as possible from ferrotype tin, commonly called tintype\r\ntin. The diaphragm is placed between the flanges on the spool and\r\nthe end D that was sawed off. The end piece and diaphragm are both\r\nfastened to the spool with two or three slender wood screws, as\r\nshown.\r\n\r\nA small wooden or fiber end, G, is fitted with two binding posts\r\nwhich are connected to the ends of the wire left projecting from\r\nthe magnet winding. The binding posts are attached to the line and\r\na trial given. The proper distance must be found between the\r\ndiaphragm and the head of the nail. This can be accomplished by\r\nmoving\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Receiver]\r\n\r\nthe nail and magnet in the hole of the spool. When the distance to\r\nproduce the right sound is found, the nail and magnet can be made\r\nfast by filling the open space with melted sealing wax. The end G\r\nis now fastened to the end of the spool, and the receiver is ready\r\nfor use.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Clean Jewelry [353]\r\n\r\nTo cleanse articles of silver, gold, bronze and brass use a\r\nsaturated solution of cyanide of potassium. To clean small\r\narticles, dip each one into the solution and rinse immediately in\r\nhot water; then dry and polish with a linen cloth. Larger articles\r\nare cleaned by rubbing the surface with a small tuft of cotton\r\nsaturated in the solution. As cyanide of potassium is a deadly\r\npoison, care must be taken not to have it touch any sore spot on\r\nthe flesh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Ornamental Iron Flower Stand [353]\r\n\r\nThe illustration shows an ornamental iron stand constructed to\r\nhold a glass or china vase. This stand can be made by first\r\ndrawing an outline of the vase on a heavy piece of paper. The vase\r\nis to have three supports. The shape of the scrolls forming each\r\nsupport should be drawn on the paper\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Stand with Vase]\r\n\r\naround the shape of the vase. A single line will be sufficient,\r\nbut care must be taken to get the shapes of the scrolls true. Take\r\na piece of string or, better still, a piece of small wire, and\r\npass it around the scroll shape on the paper. This will give the\r\nexact length of the iron required to make the scroll. As sheet\r\nmetal is used for making the scrolls, it can be cut in the right\r\nlengths with a pair of tinner\'s shears. Take a pair of round-nose\r\npliers, begin with the smallest scrolls, and bend each strip in\r\nshape, using the flat-nose pliers when necessary to keep the iron\r\nstraight, placing it on the sketch from time to time to see that\r\nthe scrolls are kept to the shape required. The scrolls are\r\nriveted and bolted together. The supports are fastened together\r\nwith rings of strip iron 3/8 in. wide, to which the supports are\r\nfastened with rivets. The metal can be covered with any desired\r\ncolor of enamel paint.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Coin Purse [354]\r\n\r\nThe dimensions for a leather coin purse are as follows: from A to\r\nB, as shown in the sketch, 6-3/8 in.; from C to D, 4-1/4 in.; from\r\nE to F, 3-1/2 in. and\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Leather Design for a Purse]\r\n\r\nfrom G to H, 3-1/4 in. Russian calf modeling leather is the\r\nmaterial used. A shade of brown is best as it does not soil\r\neasily, and does not require coloring.\r\n\r\nCut out the leather to the size of the pattern, then moisten the\r\nsurface on the rough side with a sponge soaked in water. Be\r\ncareful not to moisten the leather too much or the water will go\r\nthrough to the smooth side. Have the design drawn or traced on the\r\npattern. Then lay the pattern on the smooth side of the leather\r\nand trace over the design with the small end of the leather tool\r\nor a hard, sharp pencil. Trace also the line around the purse.\r\nDampen the leather as often as is necessary to keep it properly\r\nmoistened.\r\n\r\nAfter taking off the pattern, retrace the design directly on the\r\nleather to make it more distinct, using a duller point of the\r\ntool. Press or model down the leather all around the design,\r\nmaking it as smooth as possible with the round side of the tool.\r\nWork down the outside line of the design, thus raising it.\r\n\r\nFold the leather on the line EF. Cut another piece of leather the\r\nsize of the side ECBD of the purse, and after putting the wrong\r\nsides of the leather together, stitch around the edge as\r\ndesignated by the letters above mentioned. Do not make this piece\r\ncome quite up to the line EF, so that the coins may be more easily\r\nput in and taken out. About 1 in. from the lines EF on the piece,\r\nstitch in a strip of leather about 1/4 in. wide when stitching up\r\nthe purse, through which to slip the fly AGH.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Window Anti-Frost Solution [354]\r\n\r\nA window glass may be kept from frosting by rubbing over the inner\r\nsurface a solution of 55 parts of glycerine and 1,000 parts of 60\r\nper cent alcohol. The odor may be improved by adding a little oil\r\nof amber. This solution will also prevent a glass from sweating in\r\nwarm weather.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Turbine Engine [355]\r\n\r\nIn the following article is described a machine which anyone can\r\nmake, and which will be very interesting, as well as useful. It\r\ncan be made without the use of a lathe, or other tools usually out\r\nof reach of the amateur mechanic. It is neat and efficient, and a\r\nmodel for speed and power. Babbitt metal is the material used in\r\nits construction, being cast in wooden molds. The casing for the\r\nwheel is cast in halves--a fact which must be kept in mind.\r\n\r\nFirst, procure a planed pine board 1 by 12 in. by 12 ft. long. Cut\r\noff six\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2]\r\n\r\npieces 12 in. square, and, with a compass saw, cut out one piece\r\nas shown in Fig. 1, following the dotted lines, leaving the lug a,\r\nand the projections B and b to be cut out with a pocket knife.\r\nMake the lug 1/4 in. deep, and the projections B, b, 1/2 in. deep.\r\nThe entire cut should be slightly beveled.\r\n\r\nNow take another piece of wood, and cut out a wheel, as shown in\r\nFig. 2. This also should be slightly beveled. When it is finished,\r\nplace it on one of the square pieces of wood, with the largest\r\nside down, then place the square piece out of which Fig. 1 was\r\ncut, around the wheel, with the open side down. (We shall call\r\nthat side of a mold out of which a casting is drawn, the "open"\r\nside.) Place it so that it is even at the edge with the under\r\nsquare piece and place the wheel so that the space between the\r\nwheel and\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1]\r\n\r\nthe other piece of wood is an even 1/8 in. all the way around.\r\nThen nail the wheel down firmly, and tack the other piece\r\nslightly.\r\n\r\nProcure a thin board 1/4 in. thick, and cut it out as shown in\r\nFig. 3; then nail it, with pins or small nails, on the center of\r\none of the square pieces of wood. Fit this to the two pieces just\r\nfinished, with the thin wheel down--but first boring a 3/4-in.\r\nhole 1/4 in. deep, in the center of it; and boring a 3/8-in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3]\r\n\r\nhole entirely through at the same place. Now put mold No.1 (for\r\nthat is what we shall call this mold) in a vise, and bore six\r\n1/4-in. holes through it. Be careful to keep these holes well out\r\nin the solid part, as shown by the black dots in Fig. 1. Take the\r\nmold apart, and clean all the shavings out of it; then bolt it\r\ntogether, and lay it away to dry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4]\r\n\r\nNow take another of the 12-in. square pieces of wood, and cut it\r\nout as shown in Fig. 4, slightly beveled. After it is finished,\r\nplace it between two of the 12-in. square pieces of wood, one of\r\nwhich should have a 3/8-in. hole bored through its center. Then\r\nbolt together with six 1/4-in. bolts, as shown by the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5]\r\n\r\nblack dots in Fig. 4, and lay it away to dry. This is mold No.2.\r\nNow take mold No.1; see that the bolts are all tight; lay it on a\r\nlevel place, and pour babbitt metal into it, until it is full. Let\r\nit stand for half an hour, then loosen the bolts and remove the\r\ncasting.\r\n\r\nNow cut out one of the 12-in.-square pieces of wood as shown in\r\nFig. 5. This is the same as Fig. 1, only the one is left-handed,\r\nthe other right-handed. Put this together in mold No.1, instead of\r\nthe right-handed piece; and run in babbitt metal again. The\r\ncasting thus made will face together with the casting previously\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nPour metal into mold No.2. This will cast a paddle-wheel, which is\r\nintended to turn inside of the casting already made.\r\n\r\nIf there should happen to be any\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6]\r\n\r\nholes or spots, where the casting did not fill out, fill them by\r\nplacing a small piece of wood with a hole in it, over the\r\ndefective part, and pouring metal in to fill it up.\r\n\r\nIf you cannot obtain the use of a drill press, take an ordinary\r\nbrace, fasten a 3/8-in. drill in it, and bore a hole through the\r\nend of a strip about 2 in. wide and 16 in. long; put the top of\r\nthe brace through this hole, and fasten the other end of the strip\r\nto a bench, as shown in illustration. Find the center of the\r\npaddle-wheel, place it under the drill, true it up with a square;\r\nand drill it entirely through. Find the centers of the insides of\r\nthe other two castings, and drill them in the same manner.\r\n\r\nA piece of mild steel 5 in. long, and 3/8-in. in diameter must now\r\nbe obtained. This is for a shaft. Commencing 1-1/2 in. from the\r\none end, file the shaft off flat for a distance of 1 in. Then cut\r\na slot in the paddle-wheel, and place the shaft inside of the\r\npaddlewheel, with the flat part of the shaft turned to face the\r\nslot in the wheel. Pour metal into the slot to key the wheel on to\r\nthe shaft.\r\n\r\nThe paddle-wheel is now ready to be fitted inside of the casing.\r\nIt may be necessary to file some of the ends off the paddles, in\r\norder to let the paddle-wheel go into the casing. After it is\r\nfitted in, so that it will turn easily, place the entire machine\r\nin a vise, and bore three 1/4-in. holes, one in the lug, one in\r\nthe projections, B, b, and the other in the base, as shown by the\r\nblack dots in Fig. 6. Also bore the port-hole in projection B, and\r\nthe exhaust hole in projection b, and two 1/4-in. holes at d, d,\r\nFig. 6. Cut out a piece of gasket and fit it between the two\r\ncastings. Then bolt the castings together, screw down, and connect\r\nto the boiler.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Using the Brace]\r\n\r\nThe reader must either cast a pulley out of babbitt metal, or else\r\ngo to a machinist and get a collar turned, with a boss and a set\r\nscrew, and with three small screw holes around the edge. Cut out a\r\nsmall wood wheel and screw the collar fast to it, fasten it to the\r\nshaft of the turbine and turn on the steam. Then take a knife or a\r\nchisel, and, while it is running at full speed, turn the wheel to\r\nthe shape desired.\r\n\r\nYour turbine engine is now ready for work, and if instructions\r\nhave been carefully followed, will do good service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Painting A Car [357]\r\n\r\nWhen painting the automobile body and chassis be sure to stuff the\r\noil holes with felt or waste before applying the paint. If this\r\ncaution is not observed the holes will become clogged with paint\r\nwhich will prevent any oil reaching the bearing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How To Build An Ice Boat [357]\r\n\r\nThe ice boat is each year becoming more popular. Anyone with even\r\nsmall experience in using tools can\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Four-Runner Ice Yacht]\r\n\r\nconstruct such a craft, and the pleasure many times repays the\r\neffort.\r\n\r\nTake two pieces of wood 2 by 6 in., one 6 ft. and the other 8 ft.\r\nlong. At each end of the 6-ft. piece and at right angles to it,\r\nbolt a piece of hardwood 2 by 4 by 12 in. Round off the lower edge\r\nof each piece to fit an old skate. Have a blacksmith bore holes\r\nthrough the top of the skates and screw one of them to each of the\r\npieces of hardwood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plan of Ice Boat]\r\n\r\nThese skates must be exactly parallel or there will be trouble the\r\nfirst time the craft is used.\r\n\r\nOver the middle of the 6-ft. piece and at right angles to it, bolt\r\nthe 8-ft. plank, leaving 1 ft. projecting as in Fig. 1.\r\n\r\nThe rudder skate is fastened to a piece of hardwood 2 by 2 by 12\r\nin. as the runners were fastened. This piece should be mortised 3\r\nby 3 by 4 in. in the top before the skate is put on. Figure 2\r\nshows the rudder post.\r\n\r\nA piece of hardwood 1 by 6 by 6 in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Details of Ice Boat Construction]\r\n\r\nshould be screwed to the under side of the 8-ft. plank at the end\r\nwith the grain running crosswise. Through this bore a hole\r\n1-1/2-in. in diameter in order that the rudder post may fit\r\nnicely. The tiller, Fig. 3, should be of hardwood, and about 8 in.\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nTo the under side of the 8-ft. plank bolt a piece of timber 2 by 4\r\nby 22 in. in front of the rudder block, and to this cross piece\r\nand the 6-ft. plank nail 8-in. boards to make the platform.\r\n\r\nThe spar should be 9 ft. long and 2-1/2 in. in diameter at the\r\nbase, tapering to 1-1/2 in. at the top. This fits in the square\r\nhole, Fig. 1. The horn should be 5-1/2 ft. long, 2 by 3 in. at the\r\nbutt and 1 in. at the end.\r\n\r\nFigure 4 gives the shape and dimensions of the mainsail which can\r\nbe made of muslin. Run the seam on a machine, put a stout cord in\r\nthe hem and make loops at the corners.\r\n\r\nFigure 6 shows the way of rigging the gaff to the spar. Figure 7\r\nshows the method of crotching the main boom and Fig. 8 a reef\r\npoint knot, which may come in handy in heavy winds.\r\n\r\nMake your runners as long as possible, and if a blacksmith will\r\nmake an iron or steel runner for you, so much the better will be\r\nyour boat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Electric Rat Exterminator [358]\r\n\r\nSome time ago we were troubled by numerous large rats around the\r\nshop, particularly in a storehouse about 100 ft. distant, where\r\nthey often did considerable damage. One of the boys thought he\r\nwould try a plan of electrical extermination, and in order to\r\ncarry out his plan he picked up an old zinc floor plate that had\r\nbeen used under a stove and mounted a wooden disk 6 in. in\r\ndiameter in the center. On this disk he placed a small tin pan\r\nabout 6 in. in diameter, being careful that none of the fastening\r\nnails made an electrical connection between the zinc plate and the\r\ntin pan.\r\n\r\nThis apparatus was placed on the floor of the warehouse where it\r\nwas plainly visible from a window in the shop where we worked and\r\na wire was run from the pan and another from the zinc plate\r\nthrough the intervening yard and into the shop. A good sized\r\ninduction coil was through connected with these wires and about\r\nsix dry batteries were used to run the induction coil whenever a\r\npush button was manipulated.\r\n\r\nIt is quite evident that when a rat put its two fore feet on the\r\nedge of the pan in order to eat the mush which it contained, that\r\nan electrical connection would be made through the body of the\r\nrat, and when we pushed the button up in the shop the rat would be\r\nthrown\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Electric Rat Trap]\r\n\r\n2 or 3 ft. in the air and let out a terrific squeak. The\r\narrangement proved quite too effective, for after a week the rats\r\nall departed and the boys all regretted that their fun was at an\r\nend.\r\n--Contributed by John D.

The center post rests in an auger hole bored in an\r\nold stump or in a post set in the ground. The stump makes the best\r\nsupport. The center pole should be 10 ft. high. An old wheel is\r\nmounted at the top of the pole, and the pole works in the wheel as\r\nan axle, says the American Boy. The wheel is anchored out by\r\nseveral guy\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Home-Made Merry-Go-Round]\r\n\r\nwires. The seat arms may be any length desired.

Take the\r\nglass, dial and works out of the shell and cut some pieces out of\r\nthe metal so that when the pieces left are turned back it will\r\nhave the appearance as in Fig. 1. Then get a 10-cent frying pan, 6\r\nin. in diameter, and drill a hole in the center so the shaft for\r\nthe hands will easily pass through and extend out far enough to\r\nreplace the two hands. Put the works back in the metal shell and\r\nsolder it to the frying pan by the pieces turned out as in Fig. 2.\r\nGild the pan all over, including the handle, and print black\r\nfigures in the small circles. Calendar figures can be pasted on\r\nsmall circles and these pasted on the frying pan. The parts can be\r\ndivided into minutes with small lines the same as shown in the\r\ndrawing.

Herd, Davenport, Iowa\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Small Silver Plating Outfit [360]\r\n\r\nTake an ordinary glass fruit jar or any other receptacle in glass,\r\nnot metal, which will hold 1 qt. of liquid and fill it with rain\r\nor distilled water and then add 3/4 oz. of silver chloride and\r\n1-1/2 oz. of c.p. potassium cyanide. Let this dissolve and\r\nincorporate well with the water before using. Take an ordinary wet\r\nbattery and fasten two copper wires to the terminals and fasten\r\nthe other ends of the wires to two pieces of heavy copper wire or\r\n1/4-in. brass pipe. The wires must be well soldered to the brass\r\npipe to make a good connection. When the solution is made up and\r\nentirely dissolved the outfit is ready for plating.\r\n\r\nProcure a small piece of silver, a silver button, ring, chain or\r\nanything made entirely of silver and fasten a small copper wire to\r\nit and hang on the brass pipe with connections to the carbon of\r\nthe battery. Clean the article to be plated well with pumice and a\r\nbrush saturated in water. When cleaning any article there should\r\nbe a copper wire attached to it. Do not touch the article after\r\nyou once start to clean it, or the places touched by your fingers\r\nwill cause the silver plate to peel off when finished. When well\r\nscoured, run clear, cold water over the article and if it appears\r\ngreasy, place in hot water. When well cleaned place in the plating\r\nbath and carefully watch the results. If small bubbles come to the\r\nsurface you will know that you have too much of the anode or the\r\npiece of silver hanging in the solution and you\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plating Jar and Battery]\r\n\r\nmust draw out enough of the piece until you can see no more\r\nbubbles. Leave the piece to be plated in the solution for about\r\none-half hour, then take the article out and with a tooth brush\r\nand some pumice, clean the yellowish scum off, rinse in clear\r\nwater and dry in sawdust. When thoroughly dry, take a cotton\r\nflannel rag and some polishing powder and polish the article. The\r\narticle must have a fine polish before plating if it is desired to\r\nhave a finely polished surface after the plate is put on.\r\n\r\nIn order to see if your battery is working, take a small copper\r\nwire and touch one end to the anode pipe and the other end to the\r\npipe holding the article to be plated. When these two parts touch\r\nthere will be a small spark. Always take the zincs out of the\r\nsolution when not in use and the batteries will last longer. This\r\ndescription applies only to silver plating. Articles of lead,\r\npewter, tin or any soft metal cannot be silver plated unless the\r\narticle is first copper plated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Removing a Tight-Fitting Ring from a Finger [361]\r\n\r\nWhen a ring cannot be removed easily from the finger, take a\r\nstring or thread and draw one end through between the ring and the\r\nflesh. Coil the other end of the string around the finger covering\r\nthe part from the ring to and over the finger joint. Uncoil the\r\nstring by taking the end placed through the ring and at the same\r\ntime keep the ring close up to the string. In this way the ring\r\ncan be easily\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wrapping the Finger]\r\n\r\nslipped over the knuckle and off from the finger.\r\n--Contributed by J. K.

If the picture is\r\nmounted on cardboard, the lines can be cut through with a sharp\r\npointed knife. If you have a jig saw, you can make a bromide\r\nenlargement from the negative you have selected and mount the\r\nprint on a smooth board that is not too thick. This wood-mounted\r\npicture can be sawed out making all shapes of blocks, which forms\r\na perfect jig-saw puzzle.\r\n--Contributed by Erich Lehmann, New York City.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Rolling Uphill Illusion [361]\r\n\r\nThis interesting as well as entertaining illusion, can be made by\r\nanyone having a wood-turning lathe. A solid, similar to two cones\r\nplaced base to base, is accurately turned in a lathe, the sides\r\nsloping to an angle of 45 deg. The spindle can be turned out of\r\nthe solid at the same time as the cone; or, after turning the\r\ncone, drive an iron or wood shaft through the center making a\r\ntight fit.\r\n\r\nThe boards for the track are made with a sloping edge on which the\r\ncone is to roll. This slope will depend on the diameter of the\r\ncone, which can be any size from 3 to 12 in. The slope should not\r\nbe too flat, or the cone will not roll, and it should be such that\r\nthe\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Illusion]\r\n\r\none end will be higher than the other by a little less than half\r\nthe diameter of the cone. Thus it will be seen that the diameter\r\nof the cone determines the length of the slope of the tracks. A\r\nnotch should be cut in the tracks, as indicated, for the shaft to\r\ndrop into at the end of the course.\r\n\r\nThe lower end of the tracks are closed until the high edge of the\r\ncone rests upon the inside edges of the tracks and the high end\r\nspread sufficiently to take the full width of the cone and to\r\nallow the shaft to fall into the notches. When the cone and tracks\r\nare viewed from the broadside the deception will be more perfect,\r\nand will not be discovered until the construction of the model is\r\nseen from all sides. Should it be difficult to make the cone from\r\nwood, a good substitute can be made from two funnels.\r\n--Contributed by I. G. Bayley, Cape May Point, N.J.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Annealing Chisel Steel [362]\r\n\r\nPersons who have occasion to use tool or carbon steel now and then\r\nand do not have access to an assorted stock of this material find\r\nthat the kind most readily obtained at the hardware store is the\r\nunannealed steel known as chisel steel. Machining or filing such\r\nsteel is exceedingly slow and difficult, besides the destruction\r\nof tools; as a matter of fact this steel is intended for chisels,\r\ndrills, and like tools which require only forging and filing. If\r\nthis steel is annealed, it can be worked as easily as the more\r\nexpensive annealed steel.\r\n\r\nAnnealing may be done by heating the steel to a cherry red, not\r\nany more, and burying it in a box of slaked lime, where it is\r\nallowed to remain until all the heat is gone. If well done, the\r\nmetal will be comparatively soft and in a condition to machine\r\neasily and rapidly. In lieu of lime, bury in ashes, sand, loam, or\r\nany substance not inflammable, but fine enough to closely surround\r\nthe steel and exclude the air so that the steel cools very slowly.\r\n\r\nIf possible, keep the steel red hot in the fire several hours, the\r\nlonger the better. In certain processes, like that of file\r\nmanufacturing, the steel blanks are kept hot for 48 hours or more.\r\nWhere it is impossible to wait so long as the foregoing method\r\ntakes, then a cold water anneal may be used with less time. This\r\nmethod consists of heating the work as slowly and thoroughly as\r\nthe time will permit, then removing the steel from the fire and\r\nallowing it to cool in the air until black and then quenching in\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nIn addition to softening the steel, annealing benefits the metal\r\nby relieving strains in the piece. Should a particularly accurate\r\njob be called for, the steel should be annealed again after the\r\nroughing cuts have been taken and before machining to the final\r\nsize. This will insure a true job and diminishes the danger of\r\nspring in the final hardening.\r\n--Contributed by Donald A. Hampson, Middletown, N.

The most expensive perfume can be\r\nmade at home for less than 10 cents an ounce. The outfit necessary\r\nis a large bottle or glass jar with a smaller bottle to fit snugly\r\ninto the open mouth of the large one. Secure a small piece of very\r\nfine sponge and wash it clean to thoroughly remove all grit and\r\nsand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bottle with Flowers]\r\n\r\nSaturate the sponge with pure olive oil, do not use strong oil,\r\nand place it inside of the smaller bottle.\r\n\r\nFill the large bottle or jar with flowers, such as roses,\r\ncarnations, pansies, honeysuckles or any flower having a strong\r\nand sweet odor. Place the small bottle containing the sponge\r\nupside down in the large one, as shown in the illustration.\r\n\r\nThe bottle is now placed in the sun and kept there for a day and\r\nthen the flowers are removed and fresh ones put in. Change the\r\nflowers each day as long as they bloom. Remove the sponge and\r\nsqueeze out the oil. For each drop of oil add 2 oz. of grain\r\nalcohol.

Brown, Chippewa Falls, Wis.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Use of Kerosene in Polishing Metals [364]\r\n\r\nAnyone who has polished a flat iron or steel surface with emery\r\ncloth knows how soon the cloth gums and fills up. The cloth in\r\nthis condition will do little or no cutting. A simple remedy for\r\nthis trouble is to use kerosene on the surface. The oil floats\r\naway a large part of the gumming substance and leaves the emery\r\ncloth sharp and clean to do the best work, also, it seems to act\r\nas a lubricant to keep particles of metal from collecting on the\r\ncloth and scratching or digging in the surface of the metal. A\r\nvery light lard oil is equally good for this purpose, but not\r\nalways easily obtained. A surface polished where oil or kerosene\r\nis used does not rust so easily as one polished dry, for the\r\nreason that a little oil remains on the metal.\r\n\r\nKerosene is the best to use on oil stones, being better than\r\nheavier oil. This oil readily floats away all particles of the\r\nfeather edge that are liable to become loosened and forced into\r\nthe stone. These particles of metal when stuck to the stone are\r\nthe cause of spoiling it, as well as nicking the tools that are\r\nbeing sharpened. Keep the surface of the stone well oiled at all\r\ntimes to make the cutting free.\r\n--Contributed by Donald A. Hampson, Middletown, N.

If there is no camphor at hand add a few drops of\r\nvinegar occasionally.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Practical Camera for Fifty Cents [365]\r\nBy C. H. Claudy\r\n\r\nI say for fifty cents, but really this is an outside estimate. If\r\nyou possess a few tools and the rudiments of a shop, by which is\r\nmeant a few odds and ends of screws, brass and nails, you can\r\nreally make this camera for nothing.\r\n\r\nThe camera box is the first consideration, and for this a cigar\r\nbox answers every purpose. It is better to use one of the long\r\nboxes which contain a hundred cigars and which have square ends.\r\nThis box should be cut down, by means of a saw and a plate, until\r\nthe ends are 4 in. square. Leave the lid hinged as it is when it\r\ncomes. Clean all the paper from the outside and inside\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Construction of Camera Box]\r\n\r\nof the box--which may be readily done with a piece of glass for a\r\nscraper and a damp cloth--and paint the interior of the box a dead\r\nblack, either with carriage makers\' black or black ink.\r\n\r\nNow bore in the center of one end a small hole, 1/4 in. or less in\r\ndiameter. Finally insert on the inside of the box, on the sides,\r\ntwo small strips of wood, 1/8 by 1/4 in. and fasten them with\r\nglue, 1/8 in. from the other end of the box. Examine Fig. 1, and\r\nsee the location of these strips, which are lettered EE. Their\r\npurpose is to hold the plate, which may be any size desired up to\r\n4 in. square. Commercially, plates come 3-1/2 by 3-1/2 in., or, in\r\nthe lantern slide plate, 3-1/4 by 4 in. If it is desired to use\r\nthe 3-1/2 by 3-1/2 in. plates. which is advised, the box should\r\nmeasure that size in its internal dimensions.\r\n\r\nWe now come to the construction of the most essential part of the\r\ncamera--the pin hole and the shutter, which take the place of the\r\nlens and shutter used in more expensive outfits. This construction\r\nis illustrated in Fig. 4. Take a piece of brass, about 1/16-in.\r\nthick and 1-1/2 in. square. Bore a hole in each corner, to take a\r\nsmall screw, which will fasten it to the front of the camera. With\r\n1/4-in. drill bore nearly through the plate in the center, but be\r\ncareful that the point of the drill does not come through. This\r\nwill produce the recess shown in the first section in Fig. 4. Now\r\ntake a No. 10 needle, insert the eye end in a piece of wood and\r\nvery carefully and gently twirl it in the center of the brass\r\nwhere it is the thinnest, until it goes through. This pin hole, as\r\nit is called, is what produces the image on the sensitive plate,\r\nin a manner which I shall presently describe. The shutter consists\r\nof a little swinging piece of brass completely covering the recess\r\nand pin hole, and provided with a little knob at its lower end.\r\nSee Fig. 3, in which F is the front of the camera, B the brass\r\nplate and C the shutter. This is also illustrated in the second\r\ncross section in Fig. 4. In the latter I have depicted it as swung\r\nfrom a pivot in the brass, and in Fig. 3 as hung from a screw in\r\nthe wood of the front board; either construction will be\r\neffective.\r\n\r\nLastly, it is necessary to provide a finder for this camera in\r\norder to know what picture you are taking. Make a little frame of\r\nwire, the size of the plate you are using, and mount it upright\r\n(see Fig. 5) on top of the camera as close to the end where the\r\npin hole is as you can. At the other end, in the center, erect a\r\nlittle pole of wire half the height of the plate. If now you look\r\nalong the top of this little pole, through the wire frame and see\r\nthat the top of the little pole appears in the center of the\r\nframe, everything that you see beyond will be\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pin Hole and Shutter Construction]\r\n\r\ntaken on the plate, as will be made plain by looking at the dotted\r\nlines in Fig. 5, which represents the outer limits of your vision\r\nwhen confined within the little frame.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Explanation of Action of Pin Hole]\r\n\r\nWhen you want to use this camera, take it into an absolutely dark\r\nroom\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Constructing a Finder for Camera]\r\n\r\nand insert a plate (which you can buy at any supply store for\r\nphotographers) in the end where the slides of wood are, and\r\nbetween them and the back of the box. Close the lid and secure it\r\nwith a couple of rubber bands. See that the little shutter covers\r\nthe hole. Now take the camera to where you wish to take a\r\nphotograph, and rest it securely on some solid surface. The\r\nexposure will be, in bright sunlight and supposing that your\r\ncamera is 10 in. long, about six to eight seconds. This exposure\r\nis made by lifting the little brass shutter until the hole is\r\nuncovered, keeping it up the required time, and then letting it\r\ndrop back into place. It is important that the camera be held\r\nrigid during the exposure, and that it does not move and is not\r\njarred--otherwise the picture will be blurred. Remove the plate in\r\nthe dark room and pack it carefully in a pasteboard box and\r\nseveral wrappings of paper to protect it absolutely from the\r\nlight. It is now ready to be carried to some one who knows how to\r\ndo developing and printing.\r\n\r\nTo explain the action of the pin hole I would direct attention to\r\nFig. 2. Here F represents the front of the camera, D the pinhole,\r\nAA the plate and the letters RR, rays from a lighted candle. These\r\nrays of course, radiate in all directions, an infinite multitude\r\nof them. Similar rays radiate from every point of the object, from\r\nlight reflected from these points. Certain of these rays strike\r\nthe pin hole in the front of the camera, represented here by RRRR.\r\nThese rays pass through the pin hole, and as light travels only in\r\nstraight lines, reach the plate AA, forming an inverted image of\r\nthe object, in this case a candle in a candlestick. Millions of\r\nrays are given off by every point in every object which is lighted\r\nby either direct or reflected light. To all practical purposes\r\nonly one of these rays from each point in an object can pass\r\nthrough a minute opening like a pin hole. This being so, any\r\nscreen which interrupts these selected rays of light will show\r\nupon it a picture of the object, only inverted. If that screen\r\nhappens to be a photographically sensitive plate, which is\r\nprotected from all other light by being in a dark box, upon it\r\nwill be imprinted a photographic image which can be made visible\r\nby the application of certain chemicals, when it becomes a\r\nnegative, from which may be printed positives. This camera is not\r\na theoretical possibility, but an actual fact. I have made and\r\nused one successfully, as a demonstration of pin-hole photography.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Use for an Old Clock [367]\r\n\r\nRemove the hair spring of the clock, and fasten a spring to one\r\nend of the pawl and a small wire to the other end. Make a slit in\r\nthe case of the clock opposite the pawl. Fasten the spring on the\r\noutside in any convenient way and pass the wire through the slit\r\nto an eccentric or other oscillating body. To make the dial, paste\r\na piece of paper over the old dial, pull the wire back and forth\r\none hundred times, and make a mark where the minute hand stops.\r\nUsing this for a unit divide up the whole dial.

Fasten this so that one end of it\r\nwill swing freely, but not loosely between the ends of the other\r\npiece marked C-C. Near the end fasten a spiral spring, S, which\r\ncan be obtained almost anywhere. Fasten the end of this to the\r\nscrew marked X. Also fasten to this screw a copper wire leading to\r\nthe binding-post. In the lower end of the lever make a small hole\r\nto fasten a string through.\r\n\r\nThis string may be fastened across a door or window and any\r\nmovement of it will pull it to the contact point on the right. If\r\nthe string is cut or broken the spring will pull the lever to the\r\ncontact point on the left and thus complete the circuit. If the\r\nstring is burned it will also act as a fire alarm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Fit Corks [368]\r\n\r\nOccasionally odd-sized bottles are received in stores which\r\nrequire corks cut to fit them. No matter how sharp a knife may be,\r\nit will leave some sharp edges after cutting the cork, which will\r\ncause leakage. The illustration shows three very effective methods\r\nof reducing the size of corks. The one shown in Fig. 1 is made\r\nfrom two pieces of 1/2-in. wood fastened together at one end with\r\na common hinge. Two or three grooves are cut cross-wise in sizes\r\ndesired. The cork is put into the groove and both pieces are\r\npressed together, which will make the cork smaller.\r\n\r\nRolling the cork between two flat\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Three Methods for Reducing Size of Corks]\r\n\r\nsurfaces (Fig. 2) is simple and almost as good as pressing in the\r\ngrooves. A cork rolled on the floor (Fig. 3) is a quick and\r\neffective way. A slower and equally as good way is to soak the\r\ncork in hot water for a short time.\r\n--Contributed by L.

I split\r\nthe handles to within 1 ft. of the end (Fig. 1) with a rip saw,\r\nand then stuck them in a barrel of water for three days to make\r\nthe wood pliable for bending. A grip for each stick was made as\r\nlong as the hand is wide and a hole bored through the center the\r\nsize of a No. 10 gauge wire. These grips were placed between the\r\ntwo halves of each stick at the right distance for the length of\r\nthe boy\'s arm and a wire run through both split\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Broom Handle Crutch]\r\n\r\npieces and the handle then riveted as shown in Fig. 2. Another\r\npiece was cut as shown at A, Fig. 3, and nailed to the upper ends\r\nof each half of the broom handle.\r\n--Contributed by Geo. P.

Levinson, Saginaw, Michigan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Easy Designs in Ornamental Iron Work [370]\r\n\r\nMany an industrious lad has made money manufacturing the common\r\nforms of wood brackets, shelves, boxes, stands, etc., but the day\r\nof the scroll\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1 to 6]\r\n\r\nsaw and the cigar-box wood bracket and picture frame has given way\r\nto the more advanced and more profitable work of metal\r\nconstruction. Metal brackets, stands for lamps, gates, parts of\r\nartistic fences for gardens, supporting arms for signs, etc., are\r\namong the articles of modern times that come under the head of\r\nthings possible to construct of iron in the back room or attic\r\nshop. The accompanying sketches present some of the articles\r\npossible to manufacture.\r\n\r\nFirst, it is essential that a light room be available, or a\r\nportion of the cellar where there is light, or a workshop may be\r\nbuilt in the yard. Buy a moderate sized anvil, a vise and a few\r\nother tools, including bell hammer, and this is all required for\r\ncold bending. If you go into a forge for hot bending, other\r\ndevices will be needed. Figure 1 shows how to make the square\r\nbend, getting the shoulder even. The strip metal is secured at the\r\nhardware store or the iron works. Often the strips can be secured\r\nat low cost from junk dealers. Metal strips about 1/2 in. wide and\r\n1/8 in. thick are preferable. The letter A indicates a square\r\nsection of iron, though an anvil would do, or the base of a\r\nsection of railroad iron. The bend is worked on the corner as at\r\nB, cold. If a rounded bend is desired, the same process is applied\r\non the circular piece of iron or the horn of an anvil. This is\r\nshown in Fig. 2, at C. This piece of iron can be purchased at any\r\njunk store, where various pieces are always strewn about. A piece\r\nabout 20 in. long and 4 in. in diameter is about the right size.\r\nThe bend in the metal begins at D and is made according to the\r\nrequirements. Occasionally where sharp bends or abrupt corners are\r\nneeded, the metal is heated previous to bending.\r\n\r\nAlthough the worker may produce various forms of strip-metal work,\r\nthe bracket is, as a rule, the most profitable to handle. The\r\nplain bracket is shown in Fig. 3, and is made by bending the strip\r\nat the proper angle on form A, after which the brace is adjusted\r\nby means of rivets. A rivet hole boring tool will be needed. A\r\nsmall metal turning or drilling lathe can be purchased for a few\r\ndollars and operated by hand for the boring, or a common hand\r\ndrill can be used. Sometimes the bracket is improved in design by\r\nadding a few curves to the end pieces of the brace, making the\r\neffect as shown in Fig. 4. After these brackets are made they are\r\ncoated with asphaltum or Japan; or the brackets may be painted or\r\nstained any desired shade.\r\n\r\nIn some of the work required, it is necessary to shape a complete\r\nloop or circle at the end of the piece. This may be wrought out as\r\nin Fig. 5. The use of a bar of iron or steel is as shown. The bar\r\nis usually about 2 in. in diameter and several feet in length, so\r\nthat it will rest firmly on a base of wood or stone. Then the\r\nbending is effected as at F, about the bar E, by repeated blows\r\nwith the hammer. After a little practice, it is possible to\r\ndescribe almost any kind of a circle with the tools. The bar can\r\nbe bought at an iron dealers for about 40 cents. From the junk\r\npile of junk shop one may get a like bar for a few cents.\r\n\r\nA convenient form for shaping strip metal into pieces required for\r\nbrackets, fences, gates, arches, and general trimmings is\r\nillustrated at Fig. 6. First there ought to be a base block, G, of\r\nhard wood, say about 2 ft. square. With a round point or gouging\r\nchisel work out the groove to the size of the bar, forming a seat,\r\nby sinking the bar, H, one-half its depth into the wood as shown.\r\nIn order to retain the bar securely in position in the groove,\r\nthere should be two caps fitted over it and set-screwed to the\r\nwooden base. These caps may be found in junk dealers\' heaps,\r\nhaving been cast off from 2-in. shaft boxes. Or if caps are not\r\navailable, the caps can be constructed from sheet metal by bending\r\nto the form of the bar, allowing side portions or lips for boring,\r\nso that the caps can be set screwed to the wood. Thus we get a\r\ntool which can be used on the bench for the purpose of effecting\r\nseries of bends in strips of metal.\r\n\r\nSince the introduction of the laws requiring that signs of certain\r\nsize and projection be removed from public thoroughfares in\r\ncities, there has been quite a call for short sign brackets, so\r\ntermed, of the order exhibited in Fig. 7. These sign-supporting\r\nbrackets do not extend more than 3 ft. out from the building. A\r\nboy can take orders for these signs in almost any city or large\r\ntown with a little canvassing. The sign supporting bracket shown\r\nis merely a suggestion. Other designs may be wrought out in\r\nendless variety. A hook or eye is needed to sustain the ring in\r\nthe sign.\r\n\r\nThe young man who undertakes to construct any sort of bracket,\r\nsupports, frames or the like, will find that he will get many\r\norders for lamp-supporting contrivances, such as shown at Fig. 8.\r\nIt is hardly necessary to go into details\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7 to 10]\r\n\r\nfor making these stands, as every part is bent as described in\r\nconnection with the bending forms, and the portions are simply\r\nriveted at the different junctures. Both iron and copper rivets\r\nare used as at I, in Fig. 9, a cross sectional view.\r\n\r\nThe best way is to bore straight through both pieces and insert\r\nthe rivet. In some cases the rivet is headed up in the bore and\r\nagain washers are used and the heading effected on the washer.\r\nCopper rivets are soft and easily handled, but are costly as\r\ncompared with iron rivets.\r\n\r\nGood prices are obtained for the guards for open fireplaces made\r\nin many varieties in these days. The return of the open fireplace\r\nin modern houses has created a demand for these guards and in Fig.\r\n10 we show a design for one of them. The posts are made\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11 to 15]\r\n\r\nsufficiently stiff by uniting two sides with rivets. The ends at\r\ntop are looped as shown, while the ends or butts at the base are\r\nopened out to make the feet. Rings are shaped on forms and are\r\nthen riveted to the base cross-piece as illustrated. Crosses are\r\nmade to describe to central design and the plan is worked out\r\nquite readily with the different shapes.\r\n\r\nThe making of metal fire grate fronts has proven to be a very\r\ninteresting and profitable occupation for boys in recent times.\r\nNot long ago it was sufficient for the ingenious youth to turn out\r\njuvenile windmills, toy houses and various little knickknacks for\r\namusement. The modern lad wants more than this. He desires to turn\r\nsome of his product into cash. Therefore we present some of the\r\npatterns of fire grates which boys have made and can make again\r\nfrom scrap iron, with few tools and devices, and find a ready\r\nmarket for the same as soon as they are made. Figure 11 is a\r\nsketch of a form of fire grate bar or front that is constructed\r\nwith a series of circles of strip metal. The best way is to go to\r\nthe hardware store or iron dealer\'s and buy a quantity of 1/4-in.,\r\n1/2-in., and 3/4-in. iron, about 1/8 to 3/16 in. thick. In fact\r\n1/16-in. metal would do in many cases where the parts are worked\r\nout small in size. The 1/8-in. metal is very strong. Then after\r\ngetting the supply of strip metal in stock, procure the usual type\r\nof metal worker\'s hammer, a cheap anvil, a 9-1b. vise, a cold\r\nchisel, a file or two, and a round piece of shaft iron, about 3\r\nin. diameter and 2 to 3 ft. long. This piece of iron is\r\nrepresented at B, Fig. 12.\r\n\r\nThe iron is held in position by means of the straps of metal C, C,\r\nwhich are bent over the shaft tightly and grip the board base with\r\nset or lag screws as shown. The wooden base should be about 2 in.\r\nthick and large enough to make a good support for the iron shaft.\r\nThe process of bending the rings in this way is as shown. The\r\npiece of strip iron is grasped at D. Then with the hammer the iron\r\nis gradually worked cold about the mandrel as at E until the\r\nperfect form is acquired. After the form is finished, the strip at\r\nthe terminus of the ring is cut off. In order to get a steady base\r\nthe wooden part may be bolted to a bench. In Fig. 13 is shown the\r\nmethod of clipping off the completed ring. The cold chisel is held\r\nupright, and by delivering several blows with the hammer upon the\r\nsame, the point is caused to chip through the metal and release\r\nthe ring. The shaft or mandrel is marked G. The cold chisel is\r\nindicated at I and the position where the hand grasps the strip is\r\nat H. The final operation in shaping the ring is by driving the\r\nprotruding cut, lip down, to the common level of the opposite\r\npoint, thus giving us the finished ring with the lips closed on\r\nthe mandrel as at J, Fig. 14. These rings can be turned out in\r\nthis way very speedily. The next operation involves the process of\r\nuniting the rings in the plan to shape the design. The design work\r\nis often worked out ahead and followed. Some become so proficient\r\nthat they can develop a design as they proceed.\r\n\r\nFigure 11 is a design of grate front used for various purposes in\r\nconnection with grate fires. The series of rings are united by a\r\nrivet between each at the joining point. With thin metal the holes\r\ncan be punched with an iron punch and hammer on an anvil where\r\nthere is a hole to receive the point of the punch after the punch\r\npenetrates the metal. For the heavier forms of metal a drill is\r\nnecessary. A metal drill and brace can be purchased very cheaply\r\nfor this work. After drilling the holes, the parts are erected and\r\nthe rivets inserted and headed up as each addition is made. Thus\r\nthe series of rings are united and then the side pieces are\r\nsimilarly riveted. The points at the top are then worked out and\r\njoined on. These points are filed down to the necessary taper\r\nafter the union is effected. The finishing work involves smoothing\r\nrough places with a file and painting. Asphaltum makes a good\r\nblack finish. Some of the best designs of grates are bronzed. Some\r\nare silvered. The different designs are finished as desired by\r\ncustomers.\r\n\r\nFigure 15 is another design of grate in which the process of\r\nshaping the rings is like that in the first design. There are some\r\nhalf circles in this pattern and these are framed by shaping the\r\nsame about the mandrel with the hammer. In order to get the\r\nshoulders close and the circle complete it is necessary to heat\r\nthe metal. A coke fire can be made in a hole in the ground. Then\r\nprocure a tin blowpipe and blow the flame against the metal at the\r\npoint to be bent. This metal will become red hot very soon, and\r\ncan be bent readily against the anvil and the circular form. Let\r\nthe metal cool off on the ground after heating. Fig. 16 is another\r\ndesign\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16 to 20]\r\n\r\nwhich can be wrought out. The middle adjustment is wire screen\r\nwork which may be bought at a hardware store and set into the\r\nposition shown. Fig. 17 shows a chipping off device useful in\r\nconnection with this work. Metal chippers can be bought at any\r\ntool store. The chipper is placed in the jaws of the vise as at K,\r\nand secured there. The strip of metal in process of cutting is\r\nmarked M. The hammer head is caused to strike the metal just over\r\nthe cutting edge of the chipper. The quick, hard blow causes the\r\ncutting edge to penetrate far enough to sever the piece. Bending\r\ncold with a wooden form is done as in Fig. 18. The wooden form is\r\nmarked P and is about 8 in. wide and 7 in. high, forming a\r\none-sided oval shape. There is a pin R set into the base board of\r\nthe oval form and the strip of metal for bending is grasped at S\r\nand the other end is inserted back of the pin R. By applying\r\npressure, the strip of metal is bent to the form.\r\n\r\nFigure 19 shows the hour-glass wood bending form, made by\r\nselecting a piece of hard wood block, about 6 in. square and\r\nboring through with an inch bit. Then the hole is shaped\r\nhour-glass like. The view is a sectional one. The block is placed\r\nin a vise and the strip for bending is inserted as at T.\r\n\r\nThe strip of metal is grasped at W and can be bent to various\r\nforms by exerting pressure. Fig. 20 is another type of fireplace\r\nfront, constructed by uniting the shaped metal pieces. In fact an\r\nalmost endless variety of designs can be wrought out after the\r\nstart is once made. A good way to figure the price on the grate is\r\nto add up the costs of the parts and charge about 12 cents per\r\nhour for the work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Water Wheel [374]\r\n\r\nConsiderable power can be developed with an overshot water wheel\r\nerected as in Fig. 1. This wheel is made with blocks of wood cut\r\nout in sections as indicated by the lines, so as to form the\r\ncircle properly. The wheel can be\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Overshot and Undershot Wheels]\r\n\r\nabout 24 in. in diameter to produce results and about 10 in. wide.\r\nGet some tin cans and attach them around the wheel as shown. Bore\r\nthe wheel center out and put on the grooved wood wheel, P, and a\r\nrope for driving, R. This rope runs to a wooden frame in the\r\nmanner illustrated. The water is carried in a sluice affair, N, to\r\nthe fall, O, where the water dippers are struck by the volume and\r\nfrom 2 to 4 hp. will be produced with this size of wheel if there\r\nis sufficient flow of water. This power can be used for running\r\ntwo or three sewing machines, fans, fret-saws, and the like.\r\nAnother form of water wheel is shown in Fig. 2. This is driven by\r\nan underflow of current. This type of wheel can be made on lines\r\nsimilar to the other, only that the paddles are of wood and extend\r\noutward as shown. The wheel is supported in a bearing on the piece\r\nS. A belt, T, communicates the power to the wheel V and from here\r\nthe power is carried to any desired point.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How To Build An Imitation Street Car Line [374]\r\n\r\nAn imitation street car line may sound like a big undertaking,\r\nbut, in fact, it is one of the easiest things a boy can construct,\r\ndoes not take much time and the expense is not great. A boy who\r\nlives on a farm can find many fine places to run such a line, and\r\none in town can have a line between the house and the barn, if\r\nthey are some distance apart.\r\n\r\nOften all the boards and blocks required can be had for helping a\r\ncarpenter clear away the rubbish around a new building. Wheels and\r\nparts of old bicycles, which can be used in so many ways, can be\r\nfound at a junk shop at very low prices, wheels in good repair are\r\nnot expensive. For the car for the street car line try to find a\r\nset of wheels having axles, but if you cannot find such, make\r\nshafts of hard wood, about 3 in. by 2-1/2 in. and by means of a\r\njackknife turn, or shave down the ends to receive the hub bearings\r\nof the wheels. Fasten the wheel hubs securely over the ends of the\r\nwood with pins or little bolts, or if the wheel bearing is of such\r\na nature that it revolves on its own journal, the journal can be\r\nfastened to the end of the wood piece. Each of the wheels should\r\nbe provided with a sprocket; any chain sprocket of a bicycle may\r\nbe used. Fasten these sprockets on the outside of the wheels as\r\nshown in Fig. 1. They can be set on over the bearing end and\r\nsecured with a set screw, or the original key can be employed. It\r\nis best in cases like this to use the original parts. Make the\r\nfloor of the car of pieces of boards placed on the axles and\r\nnailed, screwed or bolted, as shown at A. To erect the frame,\r\nplace uprights, C C C C, in position as shown, fastening the ends\r\nto the base-boards and making\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3]\r\n\r\nthe roof line as at B, then put in the cross-pieces, G G. Seats, E\r\nE, are simply boxes. The drive of the car is effected by using the\r\ndriving sprockets, D D, fitted to the crosspieces, G G, with the\r\noriginal bearings. The parts are thereby secured to the car and\r\nthe chain placed on.\r\n\r\nKey the cranks for turning to the upper sprocket\'s shaft and all\r\nis ready. If there are sprocket gears and cranks on either side,\r\nfour boys may propel the car at one time. Considerable speed can\r\nbe made on smooth roads, but it is the best amusement to run a car\r\nline on wooden tracks with a brake consisting of a piece of wooden\r\nshaft, passing through a bore in the car floor, and fitted with a\r\nleather covered pad as at H. A spiral spring holds up the brake\r\nuntil pressure is applied by foot power, when the brake contacts\r\nwith the wooden track and checks the car.\r\n\r\nThe track plan is illustrated in Fig. 2. Get some boards and place\r\nthem end for end on other pieces set as ties. The main boards or\r\ntracks, JJ, can be about 6 in. wide, to the edges of which nail\r\nstrips about 3/4 in. wide and about the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Construction of Car]\r\n\r\nsame height. The ties, I I, can be almost any box boards. Wire\r\nnails are the best to use in putting the tracks together. The\r\nsprocket connection with the chain is shown in Fig. 3. This\r\nconsists of the sprocket gear on the propelling shaft, and the\r\ncrank. The pedals may be removed and a chisel handle, or any tool\r\nhandle, substituted, so as to afford means for turning the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Section of the Track]\r\n\r\ncrank by hand power. Great fun can be had with the road, and,\r\nfurthermore, it can be made remunerative, as boys and girls can be\r\ngiven rides for a penny each.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Clean Before Painting [375]\r\n\r\nApply a coat of raw starch water to a dirty wall before painting;\r\nthis, when dry, may be brushed or wiped off.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Varnish for Electric Terminals [375]\r\n\r\nA good varnish for electric terminals is made of sealing wax\r\ndissolved in gasoline. To prevent brittleness add a little linseed\r\noil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Measuring the Height of a Tree [376]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Method of Applying the Triangle Measure]\r\n\r\n"Near the end of the season our boy announced the height of\r\nour tall maple tree to be 33 ft.\r\n"\'Why, how do you know?\' was the general question.\r\n"\'Measured it.\' "\'How?\'\r\n"\'Foot rule and yardstick.\'\r\n"\'You didn\'t climb that tall tree?\' his mother asked anxiously.\r\n"\'No\'m; I found the length of the shadow and measured that.\'\r\n"\'But the length of the shadow changes.\'\r\n"\'Yes\'m; but twice a day the shadows are just as long as the\r\nthings themselves. I\'ve been trying it all summer. I drove a\r\nstick into the ground, and when its shadow was just as long as\r\nthe stick I knew that the shadow of the tree would be just as\r\nlong as the tree, and that\'s 33 ft.\'"\r\n\r\nThe above paragraph appeared in one of the daily papers which come\r\nto our office. The item was headed, "A Clever Boy." Now we do not\r\nknow who this advertised boy was, but we knew quite as clever a\r\nboy, one who could have got the approximate height of the tree\r\nwithout waiting for the sun to shine at a particular angle or to\r\nshine at all for that matter. The way boy No. 2 went about the\r\nsame problem was this: He got a stick and planted it in the ground\r\nand then cut it off just at the level of his eyes. Then he went\r\nout and took a look at the tree and made a rough estimate of the\r\ntree\'s height in his mind, and judging the same distance along the\r\nground from the tree trunk, he planted his stick in the ground.\r\nThen he lay down on his back with his feet against the standing\r\nstick and looked at the top of the tree over the stick.\r\n\r\nIf he found the top of stick and tree did not agree he tried a new\r\nposition and kept at it until he could just see the tree top over\r\nthe end of the upright stick. Then all he had to do was to measure\r\nalong the ground to where his eye had been when lying down and\r\nthat gave him the height of the tree.\r\n\r\n\'The point about this method is that the boy and stick made a\r\nright-angled triangle with boy for base, stick for perpendicular,\r\nboth of the same length, and the "line of sight" the hypotenuse or\r\nlong line of the triangle. When he got into the position which\r\nenabled him to just see the tree top over the top of the stick he\r\nagain had a right-angled triangle with tree as perpendicular, his\r\neye\'s distance away from the trunk, the base, and the line of\r\nsight the hypotenuse. He could measure the base line along the\r\nground and knew it must equal the vertical height, and he could do\r\nthis without reference to the sun.

The\r\nprecipitate varies considerably in color and may be either yellow,\r\nblue, orange, green or brown, depending on the strength of the\r\ncurrent, the strength of the solution, and the composition of the\r\nbrass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Novelty Chain Made from a Match [377]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying engraving shows what is possible to do with a\r\npenknife.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lay a Match on the Picture]\r\n\r\nA small chain composed of several links was cut from the wood that\r\nforms the match.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Keeping Doors Closed [377]\r\n\r\nGlass doors in bookcases may be kept from swinging open by boring\r\na hole, about 1/4 in. deep, either at the top or bottom in the\r\nedge of the door, 2 in. from the closing edge, and inserting an\r\nordinary cork, allowing a small portion to project and rub on the\r\nfacing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Restoring Broken Negatives [377]\r\n\r\nWhoever has the misfortune to break a valuable negative need not\r\ndespair, for the damage can be repaired most effectively. In case\r\nthe negative be broken into many pieces, take a clean glass, the\r\nsame size as the broken negative, and put upon this the pieces,\r\njoining them accurately, says Camera Craft. Put another clean\r\nglass on top of this and bind the three together with\r\npasse-partout binding or gummed strips of ordinary paper, as one\r\nwould a lantern slide, and cover the glass edges.\r\n\r\nNext make a transparency of this--in the camera, of course--and if\r\nit is done right, the positive will only show the cracks as dark\r\nand light lines. The\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Before and After Mending]\r\n\r\ndark lines are removed with the etching knife and the light ones\r\nwith the retouching pencil. From this transparency another\r\nnegative can be made, or as many negatives as necessary, by either\r\ncontact or in the camera, and if the work on the glass positive\r\nwas done carefully, no trace of the break should be seen on the\r\nfinished negative. If the negative is broken in two or three\r\nlarger pieces only, a contact positive may be made in the printing\r\nframe without binding, by using a clean glass in the latter, upon\r\nwhich the pieces are put together, face up, and a dry plate\r\nexposed in contact with them in the dark room. The accompanying\r\nengravings show a print before and after repairing a broken\r\nnegative in this manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Coin and Tumbler Trick [378]\r\n\r\nThe accompanying sketch shows how a good trick may be easily\r\nperformed by anyone. Lay a piece of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: This Is a Good Trick]\r\n\r\nheavy paper that is free from creases on a board or table. Secure\r\nthree tumblers that are alike and stick a piece of the same heavy\r\npaper over the openings in two of them, neatly trimming it all\r\naround the edges so as to leave nothing of the paper for anyone to\r\nsee. Make three covers of paper as shown in Fig. 1 to put over the\r\ntumblers. Place three coins on the sheet of paper, then the\r\ntumblers with covers on top of the coins, the unprepared tumbler\r\nbeing in the middle. Now lift the covers off the end tumblers, and\r\nyou will see that the paper on the openings covers the coins.\r\nReplace the covers, lift the middle one, and a coin will be seen\r\nunder the tumbler, as the opening of this tumbler is not covered.\r\nDrop the cover back again and lift the other tumblers and covers\r\nbodily, so that the spectators can see the coins, remarking at the\r\nsame time that you can make them vanish from one to the other. The\r\nopenings of the tumblers must never be exposed so that any one can\r\nsee them, and a safe way to do this is to keep them level with the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Another Way to Renew Dry Batteries  [378]\r\n\r\nThere are many methods of renewing dry batteries, and I have used\r\nseveral of them, but I found the following the best: Remove the\r\npaper cover and with a 1/4-in. drill make about six holes around\r\nthe side of the zinc, about 1/2 in. from the bottom. Then drill\r\nanother row of holes about half way up the side and put the\r\nbattery to soak in a solution of sal ammoniac for 48 hours. Then\r\nremove and plug the holes up with hard soap, and replace in the\r\npaper box, when it will give nearly as strong a current as when\r\nnew.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Simply Made Wire Puzzle [378]\r\n\r\nThe object of this simply made wire puzzle is to get the ring off,\r\nwhich is not easy unless you know how. To do so it is necessary to\r\nmove the triangle with ring to one of the hinge joints and fold\r\nthe puzzle. Then slip the ring off the triangle over the hinge\r\njoint and it will slip all around and off at the other hinge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Puzzle]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Pronunciation [378]\r\n\r\nDiabolo is pronounced Dee-ab-lo.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Repairing Box Cameras [379]\r\n\r\nIn repairing the inner part of box cameras which have been broken\r\nloose, use a binding of strong black cloth well glued in place.\r\nThis will materially strengthen the joints where the wooden pieces\r\nare so thin that it is impossible to use brads in holding them\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nDo not forget to thoroughly clean all the old glue or cement from\r\nthe joints with a rasp or sandpaper before attempting a repair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Fishhook Box [379]\r\n\r\nA box that may be used to hold fishhooks, sinkers, matches or any\r\nsmall articles, can be made from two empty shotgun cartridges as\r\nshown in the sketch.

Punch two holes near the\r\ntop of the can; bend a piece of wire and place the ends through\r\nthe holes as shown at A in the sketch. Pull the ends to draw the\r\nloop close up on the inside of the tin and then twist the ends to\r\nform a handle as shown at B.

Ill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Devices of Winter Sports-How to Make and Use Them [380]\r\n\r\nIn the north the red-cheeked boy digs a hole in the ice and while\r\nhe amuses and invigorates himself at skating the fish underneath\r\nthe icy sheet\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "Tip Up Pole"]\r\n\r\nfasten themselves to the hook he has let down through a hole. The\r\nboy used to sit over the hole in the ice and wait for the fish to\r\nbite, but that became too slow and detracted too much from his\r\npleasure at skating. So his inventive genius set itself to work\r\nand the "tip-up" and "signal" shown in the illustration was the\r\nresult. When the fish is not biting the flag lies flat on the ice,\r\nbut as soon as a fish has swallowed the hook the flag pole stands\r\nstraight up wafting its bright colored flag to the breezes and all\r\nthe boys on the skating pond read the word "fish." The fish is\r\ndrawn up, the hook rebaited and the youthful fisherman resumes his\r\npleasures on the ice. Often a score or more of these "tip-ups" are\r\nplanted about the edges of the ice pond, each boy bringing his\r\nfishing tackle with his skates and thus finding a double source of\r\namusement. Maybe one boy will thus have a half dozen different\r\nlines in the water at once, it being easy to watch them all\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThe device by which the fish is made to give its own signal when\r\ncaught is exceedingly simple and any boy can make it. Procure a\r\nlight rod about 2 ft. in length and to one end fasten a small\r\nflag, made of any bright colored cloth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "Tip-Up" Fish Caught]\r\n\r\nBind the rod at right angles to another stick which is placed\r\nacross the hole, so that a short piece of the flagrod projects\r\nover the cross stick. To this short end fasten the fishing line.\r\nBe sure and use strong string in binding the two rods together,\r\nand also take care that the cross stick is long enough to permit\r\nseveral inches of each end to rest on the ice. After fastening the\r\nline to the short end of the rod, bait the hook with a live minnow\r\nor other suitable bait and let it down through the hole. When the\r\nfish is hooked the flag will instantly raise and wave about\r\nstrenuously until the fish is taken from the water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** "Jumping-Jack" Fisherman [380]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Jumping-Jack Fisherman]\r\n\r\nIf the small boy has a "jumping-jack" left over from Christmas. he\r\nmay make this do his fishing for him and serve as well as the\r\n"tip-up," or he can easily make the jumping-jack himself\r\nindependent of Santa Claus. The string which is pulled to make the\r\njoints move is tied securely to the fishing line; the hook is\r\nbaited and lowered into the water through a hole in the ice. The\r\n"jumping-jack" waves his legs and arms frantically to notify the\r\nboys when the fish is biting. The "jumping-jack" is also used for\r\nfishing in summer time by placing it on a float which is cast into\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Merry-Go-Round Whirl on Ice [380]\r\n\r\nA German device for the amusement of children is a whirl on an ice\r\nmerry-go-round. It is made by placing a vertical shaft or stake,\r\nprovided with a couple of old cart-wheels, in a hole in the ice.\r\nOne wheel acts as a turning base and prevents the shaft from\r\nsinking into the pond, and the other forms a support for the long\r\nsweep attached for propulsion purposes, and should be fastened to\r\nthe shaft about 3 ft. above the base wheel. The sleds are made\r\nfast in a string to the long end of the sweep, which when turned\r\nrapidly causes the sleds to slide over the ice in a circle at a\r\nhigh speed.\r\n\r\nIf the sweep is long enough to have each end from the shaft the\r\nsame length, two strings of sleds may be attached, which will\r\nbalance the device and make the turning much easier.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** The Running Sleigh [381]\r\n\r\nAnother winter sport, very popular in Sweden, and which has\r\nalready reached America, is the "running sleigh," shown in the\r\nillustration. A light sleigh is equipped with long double runners\r\nand is propelled by foot power. The person using the sleigh stands\r\nwith one foot upon a rest attached to one of the braces connecting\r\nthe runners and propels the sleigh by pushing backward with the\r\nother foot. To steady the body an upright support is attached to\r\nthe runners. The contrivance can be used upon hard frozen ground,\r\nthin ice and snow-covered surfaces, and under favorable conditions\r\nmoves with remarkable speed. The "running sleigh" has a decided\r\nadvantage over skis, because the two foot supports are braced so\r\nthat they cannot come apart. Any boy can make the sleigh.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Running Sleigh]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** The Winged Skater [381]\r\n\r\nWith the actual speed of the wind a skater may be hurled along the\r\nice if he is aided by sails. He has been known to travel at the\r\nrate of 40 miles an hour,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Frame for Skater\'s Sails]\r\n\r\nAnd the sport while affording the limit of excitement, is not\r\nattended with danger. The sails are easily made, as the\r\nillustrations and description will show.\r\n\r\nSecure two large thin hoops about 4 ft. in diameter. They may be\r\nobtained from an old hogshead or by bending thin strips. For each\r\nhoop select a piece of strong cane about 3/4 in. in diameter to\r\nconstitute the fore and main masts or cross-yards. Extend these\r\nacross the center of the hoop and fasten each end firmly to the\r\nhoop\'s sides. For the middle of each cross-spar make a cleat and\r\nlash it on firmly. The main spar should also be made of two pieces\r\nof strong cane, each about 9-1/2 ft. long. Bind them together at\r\neach end so that the large end of one is fastened to the small end\r\nof the other.\r\n\r\nNext comes the attaching of the sails to the separate masts. The\r\nsails should be made of strong sheeting or thin canvas. Tack the\r\ncloth to the hoop on the inner side after it has been wrapped\r\naround the hoop two or three times.\r\n\r\nNow the main spar should be attached by springing it apart and\r\nslipping the cleats of the cross-spar between the two pieces. Bind\r\nthe inner sides of the hoops tightly together by means of a very\r\nstrong double cord, as shown in the figure. Then your sail is\r\nready for the ice pond. See that your skates are securely\r\nfastened, raise your\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Skater\'s Sails Finished]\r\n\r\nsail and you will skim along the ice as lightly as a bird on the\r\nwing. With a little practice you will learn to tack and guide\r\nyourself as desired.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plan of Ice Boat, Sail and Rudder]\r\n\r\nIf the hoops cannot be easily obtained the sails may be made\r\nequally effective by using the main spar and fore and main masts\r\nas herein described, making the sails square shaped instead of\r\nround and leaving off the hoops. In this case the sails should be\r\nsecurely bound with strong tape. Attach a corner to each end of\r\nthe cross-spar, and a corner to the outer end of the main spar.\r\nThe remaining corner of each then appears opposite to each other,\r\nand should be fastened together by strong cord in the same manner\r\nas the hoops. In this case the sails may be left off until after\r\nthe frame is entirely put together and then fastened on to the\r\nspars by buttons.\r\n\r\nA more simple sail may be made according to the plans illustrated\r\nin the lower drawing. It is made by binding together in the center\r\nthe halves of two strong hogshead hoops, or two bent poles are\r\nbetter. If possible the sail should be about 8 ft. long and 4 ft.\r\nwide. Fasten on the sail at the four corners. The rig will convey\r\ntwo persons and is more easily constructed than any other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Ice Boating [382]\r\n\r\nBut the sport that is greatest of all, the one that used to be\r\npart of the life of every northern boy, and which is being revived\r\nin popularity after years of stagnation, is ice boating. With the\r\naid of old skates, pieces of board and an old sheet or a small bit\r\nof canvas, any boy possessed of ordinary mechanical genius may\r\nmake an ice boat. The frame of the boat should be made something\r\nin the form of a kite. The center-board should be 4 or 5 ft. long,\r\n6 in. wide and 2 in. thick. The cross board may be of a piece of 1\r\nby 6 in. plank 3 ft. long. Fasten these with braces of small stout\r\nstrip, as shown in the drawing, and screw the cross-piece securely\r\nto the center-board. Bore a hole in the center of the intersection\r\nfor the mast pole. The seat may be made of a piece of strong cloth\r\nor leather. Three skates are fastened on to either side of the\r\ncross-board and one to the rear end of the center-board, the\r\nlatter of which is to operate as a rudder. In attaching the skates\r\nfirst make a couple of runner blocks, each 6 in. long and 3 in.\r\nwide. Bore holes in them for the straps of the skates to pass\r\nthrough and fasten them securely. Nail the runner blocks firmly to\r\nthe crossboard about 1-1/2 in. from each end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Boy\'s Ice Boat]\r\n\r\nIn making the rudder hew down a piece of scantling 1 ft. long\r\nuntil it assumes the shape of a club with a flat base. Nail a\r\nstrip of wood firmly to this base, and to the strip fasten the\r\nskate. Run the top of the club through a hole bored in the stern\r\nof the centerboard. Then make the helm by boring a hole in one end\r\nof a strip of soft board about 1 ft. long, and through this hole\r\npass the club or rubber-pole and fasten it so it may be shifted\r\nwhen desired. Make the sail out of an old sheet, if it be strong\r\nenough, piece of canvas, or any such substance and attach it to\r\nthe mast and sprit as shown in the illustration, and guide it by a\r\nstout string attached to the lower outer corner. As an ice boat\r\nwill travel faster than the wind, some care and considerable skill\r\nis necessary. Unless you are accustomed to managing a sail boat,\r\ndo not select a place in which to learn where there are all holes\r\nor open water. To stop the boat throw the head around into the\r\nwind, same as you would with a sailboat. If the wind is strong the\r\noccupants of the boat should lie flat on their stomach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Coasters and Chair Sleighs [383]\r\n\r\nMake your own sled, boys! There is no use in buying them, because\r\nyour hand-made sled is probably better than any purchased one and\r\nthen you can take so much more pride in it when you know it is of\r\nyour own construction. There are so many different designs of\r\nsleds that can be made by hand that the matter can be left almost\r\nentirely to your own ingenuity. You can make one like the bought\r\nsleds and face the runners with pieces of an iron hoop which will\r\nanswer every purpose. A good sled for coasting consists simply of\r\ntwo barrel staves and three pieces of board as shown in the\r\npicture, Fig. 1.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. l; Barrel Stave Sled]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chair Sleigh]\r\n\r\nNo bought sled will equal it for coasting and it is also just the\r\nthing for carrying loads of snow for building snow houses. The\r\nmethod of its construction is so simple that no other description\r\nis needed than the picture. You can make a chair-sleigh out of\r\nthis by fitting a chair on the cross board instead of the long top\r\nboard or it will be still stronger if the top board is allowed to\r\nremain, and then you will have a device that can readily again be\r\ntransformed into a coasting sled. In making the chair-sleigh it is\r\nnecessary, in order to hold the chair in place, to nail four\r\nL-shaped blocks on the cross boards, one for each leg of the\r\nchair. Skating along over the ice and pushing the chair in front\r\nof him the proud possessor of a chair-sleigh may take his mother,\r\ngrown sister or lady friend with him on his outings, and permit\r\nher to ride in the chair.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Folding Chair Sleigh [384]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2-Folding Chair Sleigh Bottom ]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3-Folding Chair Sleigh-Top Parts Disconnected]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4-Folding Chair Sleigh Open]\r\n\r\nA folding chair sleigh is even more enjoyable and convenient than\r\nthe device just described. If the ice pond is far from home this\r\nmay be placed under your arm and carried where you like.\r\n\r\nThe illustrations, Figs. 2 and 3, show all the parts as they\r\nshould look before\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6-Folding Chair Sleigh Closed]\r\n\r\nbeing joined together. The seat may be made of a piece of canvas\r\nor carpet. The hinges are of leather. Figure 4 shows the folding\r\nchair sleigh after it has been put together. Skates are employed\r\nfor the runners. The skates may be strapped on or taken off\r\nwhenever desired. When the chair is lifted the supports slip from\r\nthe notches on the side bars and fall on the runner bars. The\r\nchair is then folded up so that it can be carried by a small boy.\r\nWith regular metal hinges and light timbers a very handsome chair\r\ncan be constructed that will also afford an ornamental lawn chair\r\nfor summer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** The Toboggan Sled [384]\r\n\r\nWhen the snow is very deep a toboggan sled is the thing for real\r\nsport. The runners of the ordinary sled break through the crust of\r\nthe deep snow, blocking the progress, and spoiling the fun. The\r\ntoboggan sled, with its broad, smooth bottom, glides along over\r\nthe soft surface with perfect ease.\r\n\r\nTo make the toboggan sled, secure two boards each 10 ft. long and\r\n1 ft. wide and so thin that they can be easily bent. Place the\r\nboards beside each other and join them together with cross sticks.\r\nScrew the boards to the cross stick from the bottom and be sure\r\nthat the heads of the screws are buried deep enough in the wood to\r\nnot protrude, so\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6-The Toboggan]\r\n\r\nthat the bottom will present an absolutely smooth surface to the\r\nsnow. Fasten two side bars to the top of the cross sticks and\r\nscrew them firmly. In some instances the timbers are fastened\r\ntogether by strings, a groove being cut m the bottom of the boards\r\nso as to keep the strings from protruding and being ground to\r\npieces. After the side bars are securely fastened, bend the ends\r\nof the boards over and tie them to the ends of the front cross bar\r\nto hold them in position. See Fig. 6. The strings for keeping the\r\nboards bent must be very strong. Pieces of stout wire, or a\r\nslender steel rod, are even better. The toboggan slide is the\r\nfavored device of sport among the boys in Canada, where nearly\r\nevery boy knows how to make them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** The Norwegian Ski. [384]\r\n\r\nYou have often read of the ski, the snowshoe used by the\r\nNorwegians and other people living in the far north. With them the\r\nmen and women glide down the snow-covered mountain sides, leap\r\nacross ditches, run races and have all kinds of sport. They are\r\njust as amusing to the American boy who has ever learned to\r\nmanipulate them, and it is wonderful how much skill can be\r\nattained in their use. Any boy with a little mechanical ingenuity\r\ncan make a pair of skis (pronounced skees). They can be made from\r\ntwo barrel staves. Select staves of straight grained wood. Sharpen\r\nthe ends of each and score each end by cutting grooves in the\r\nwood, as shown in the cut, Fig. 7. A pocket knife or small gouge\r\nwill suffice for this work. Then smear the end of the staves with\r\noil and hold them close to a hot fire until they can be bent so as\r\nto tip the toes upward, as shown in the picture, Fig. 7. Then with\r\na cord bind the staves as they are bent and permit them to remain\r\nthus tied until they retain the curved form of their own accord.\r\nNow screw on top of each ski a little block, just broad and high\r\nenough to fit in front of the heels of your shoe. Fasten a strap\r\nin front of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Home-Made Skis]\r\n\r\neach block through which to slip your toes, and the skis are made.\r\nThe inside of the shoe heel should press firmly against the block\r\nand the toe be held tightly under the strap. This will keep the\r\nskis on your feet. Now procure a stick with which to steer and\r\nhunt a snow bank. At first you will afford more amusement to\r\nonlookers than to yourself, for the skis have a way of trying to\r\nrun in opposite directions, crosswise and various ways, but with\r\npractice you will soon become expert in their manipulation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Home-Made Settee [385]\r\n\r\nMany people have old wooden beds stored away which can easily be\r\nmade into handy settees like the one shown in the accompanying\r\nphotograph. A few nails and one-half dozen 3-in. screws are all\r\nthe materials necessary besides the old bed. The tools needed are\r\na saw, hammer and a screwdriver. The head-board, if too high, can\r\nbe cut\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Settee Made from Old Wooden Bed]\r\n\r\noff and some of the ornaments replaced. The footboard must be cut\r\nin two to make the ends or arms of the settee. The side rails and\r\na few of the slats are used in making the seat.\r\n--Contributed by Wm. F. Hild, Lake Forest, Ill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Enameling a Bicycle Frame [385]\r\n\r\nMake an enamel by mixing 2 oz. burnt umber with 1 qt. boiled oil,\r\nheating, and then adding 1 oz. asphaltum. Keep the mass hot until\r\nthoroughly mixed, says the Master Painter. Thin with turpentine\r\nwhile still hot.\r\n\r\nUse a camel\'s hair brush for applying the enamel and allow it to\r\nset; then place the article in an oven, bake for six or eight\r\nhours at a temperature of 250 deg. F. When cool rub down with\r\nsteel wool. Apply a finishing coat and allow it to bake eight\r\nhours at 250 deg. F. Rub down with a soft rag, varnish and bake\r\nagain at 200 deg. F. Heat and cool the frame gradually each time.\r\nBlack enamel is easiest to apply and bakes hardest, but requires a\r\ntemperature of 300 deg.

The trolley was made, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2, of\r\nstrips of wood bolted with stove bolts on two grooved pulleys. The\r\nmiddle wide board was made of hardwood. The wheels were taken from\r\nlight pulley blocks and stove bolts were purchased from a local\r\nhardware store to accurately fit the hubs.

As this\r\nperformance requires from twenty to thirty\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Details of Furnace Regulator Construction]\r\n\r\nminutes I concluded to make a self-acting device which would close\r\nthe draft and leave the furnace safe, without any further\r\nattention on my part, after putting in the coal and opening it up\r\nto burn. As some other boys may like to build the same regulator I\r\nwill tell just how to make one and how it operates.\r\n\r\nReferring to Fig. 1, you will see a straight cord is attached to\r\nthe draft door of the furnace, D, and is run over the pulley P and\r\nfinally is attached to a small piece of iron H. This piece of\r\niron is hinged to 1. To the other side of H another cord G is\r\nfastened, which passes over the pulley N and terminates in any\r\nconvenient place in the rooms above. This piece of iron H is held\r\nin place by the release A. Now C is a coil of wire from a door\r\nbell. R is an armature which works A on pivot J. M is a U-tube,\r\nfilled with mercury, one end being connected to a half liter glass\r\nflask F by the tube T, and the other end terminates in an overflow\r\ntube O. B is a battery of three bichromate cells which are\r\nconnected up with the C and the platinum points 1--2, which are\r\nfused into the U-tube.\r\n\r\nOn fixing the furnace the iron piece H takes position X, this\r\nbeing the normal position when draft door D is closed. On arriving\r\nupstairs I pull the cord G, which causes the piece H to become\r\nfixed in the vertical position by means of A. This opens the draft\r\ndoor at the same time. Now when the furnace heats up sufficiently\r\nit causes the air to expand in F, which causes the mercury in M to\r\nrise a little above the point 2. This immediately causes a current\r\nto flow through C which in turn draws R towards it, raises A and\r\ncauses H to drop to position X. This shuts the furnace door. Now\r\nthe furnace, of course, cools down, thus causing the air in F to\r\ncontract and consequently opening the circuit through C. If at any\r\ntime the furnace should overheat, the raising of A, on which is\r\ngrounded a wire from a signal bell upstairs, will make a circuit\r\nthrough the bell by means of the point Z and wire leading\r\ntherefrom. This bell also serves to tell me whether H has dropped\r\nor not. This same device of regulating the draft D can be used to\r\nregulate the damper, found on the coal doors of most furnaces, by\r\nsimply fusing a platinum point on the other side of M and changing\r\nthe cord which is attached to D. A two-contact switch could also\r\nbe inserted to throw connections from 2 to 3. It would work in\r\nthis manner: The damper door, of course, which keeps a low fire,\r\nwould be up in a position similar to D; on the furnace cooling too\r\nmuch, connection, due to contracting of air in F, would be made\r\nthrough 3 and C, causing H to drop, thus closing door. This simple\r\ndevice worked very well all last winter and gave me no trouble\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nIf you cannot readily procure a U-tube, you can make one, as I\r\ndid, and the work is interesting.\r\n\r\nThe U-tube is constructed in the following manner. A glass tube is\r\nclosed at one end. This is done by holding the tube in one corner\r\nof a gas flame, somewhat near the dark area (A, Fig. 2), and\r\nconstantly turning the tube, when it will be found that the glass\r\nhas melted together. Now, after it is cool, about 3 or 4 in. from\r\nthe sealed end, the tube is held steadily so that the flame will\r\nheat one small portion ( B, Fig. 2 ). After this small portion is\r\nheated blow into the tube, not very hard, but just enough to cause\r\ntube to bulge out. Allow to cool. Then reheat the small bulged\r\nportion, blow quite hard, so that the glass will be blown out at\r\nthis point, forming a small hole. Now insert about 1/2 in. of\r\nplatinum wire and reheat, holding platinum\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Making the U-Tube]\r\n\r\nwire by means of a small pliers so that it will be partly in the\r\ntube and partly without. The platinum will stick to the glass, and\r\nif glass is sufficiently heated one will be able to pull it, by\r\nmeans of pliers, from one side of the hole to the other, thus\r\nsealing the wire into the tube. Another wire is sealed in the same\r\nway about 1 in. from the first. Now, to bend the tube, one must\r\nhold it, with both hands, in the flame and turn constantly until\r\nsoft. Quickly withdraw from flame and bend, just as you would a\r\npiece of copper wire. Allow to cool slowly.\r\n\r\nThe several tubes are connected with a short piece of rubber\r\ntubing.\r\n\r\nThe total cost of materials for constructing the apparatus\r\ncomplete will not amount to more than one dollar.\r\n--Contributed by M.

If a\r\ntrap should be banged carelessly against the side of the boat or\r\nsome other obstruction and smashed, instead of spending several\r\ndollars to replace it, a half hour\'s time will turn out a new one\r\njust as good, says a correspondent of Outing.\r\n\r\nA trap of this kind can be made from an ordinary fruit jar such as\r\nused in putting up preserves, either of one or two-quart capacity.\r\nA one-quart jar gives good results, but if the bait to be caught\r\nis of fairly large size, the two quart size may be used. As the\r\njars have the same style top they can be used interchangeably with\r\none mouthpiece.\r\n\r\nThe mouthpiece is made of a round neck bottle of which the glass\r\nis colorless and rather thin. If the neck of the bottle is cut at\r\nthe right point, it makes a glass funnel that will just fit into\r\nthe fruit jar. The funnel forms the mouth of the trap. Put the\r\nneck of the bottle into the fruit jar and mark the glass with a\r\nfile where the bottle and jar meet. Make as deep a cut as possible\r\nwith a file around the bottle on the mark and place two turns of a\r\nyarn string saturated in kerosene around just below the cut when\r\nthe bottle is standing in an upright position. Set fire to the\r\nstring and turn the bottle from side to side to distribute the\r\nheat evenly, then when the string has burned out, plunge the\r\nbottle in cold water and it will separate on the cut.\r\n\r\nBind some copper wire around the neck of the jar so that three\r\nends will project 1/2 in. or more. These are bent down over the\r\nfunnel when put into the jar, forming clamps to hold it in place.\r\nThe copper wire can be bent many times in emptying or baiting the\r\ntrap without breaking.\r\n\r\nTwo copper wire bands are tied tightly around the jar about 3 in.\r\napart. They should be twisted tight with a pair of pliers and the\r\nends joined, forming a ring for attaching a cord.\r\n\r\nFor catching "kellies" or "killies," bait the trap with crushed\r\nclams or salt-water mussels and for fresh water shiners use\r\nmincemeat or bread crumbs and do not spill any bait outside of the\r\ntrap. Leave the trap down ten to fifteen minutes and when\r\nresetting it after emptying, put back one or two of the victims,\r\nas the others enter more readily if they see some of their\r\ncompanions ahead of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Remedy for Leaking Fountain Pens [390]\r\n\r\nFountain-pen leaks may often be prevented by unscrewing the joint\r\nand lightly smearing the screw with vaseline. This also makes it\r\neasy to unscrew the joint for filling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Kites of Many Kinds and How to Make Them [391]\r\n\r\nOne of the prettiest of all is the butterfly kite. To make this\r\nget two thin kite sticks of equal length. Bend each in an are,\r\ntying one end of a strong string to one end of each stick and the\r\nother end of the string to a point about 3 in. from the other end\r\nof the stick. This leaves one end of each stick free, hooking over\r\nthe hemisphere described by the thread and the stick. Now tie\r\nanother thread to\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Boy Kite]\r\n\r\neach of these free ends and tie the other end of the thread to a\r\npoint near the other end of the stick, corresponding with the\r\ndistance from the end at which the first strings were tied on the\r\nopposite side. This done, you should have two arched frames, each\r\nan exact counterpart of the other in size, curvature and weight.\r\nNow fasten the two frames together so that the arcs will overlap\r\neach other as shown in the sketch. Bind the intersecting points\r\nsecurely with thread. To make the butterfly\'s head, secure two\r\nheavy broom straws or two short wires, and\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Girl Kite]\r\n\r\nattach them to the top part of the wing frames near where the\r\nsticks intersect, so that the straws or wires will cross. These\r\nform the antennae, or the "smellers." Then select the color of\r\npaper you want, yellow, brown, blue, white or any other color; lay\r\nit on a flat surface and place the frame on top of it, holding the\r\nframe down securely with a weight. Then with a pair of scissors\r\ncut the paper around the frame, leaving about a 1/2-in. margin for\r\npasting. Cut slits in the paper about 2 in. apart around the\r\ncurves and at all angles to keep the paper from wrinkling when it\r\nis pasted. Distribute the paste with a small brush and make the\r\noverlaps a little more than 1/4 in. wide and press them\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Butterfly Kite]\r\n\r\ntogether with a soft cloth. When the kite is dry decorate it with\r\npaint or strips of colored paper in any design you may fancy. The\r\nbest effects are produced by pasting pieces of colored paper on\r\ntop of the other paper. Black paper decorations show up to fine\r\nadvantage when the kite is in flight. Attach the "belly-band" to\r\nthe\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Frame for Girl Kite]\r\n\r\ncurved sticks by punching a hole in the paper in the same manner\r\nas it is attached to the common hexagonal or coffin-shaped kite.\r\nWith a tail, your kite is ready to fly. Another interesting design\r\nis the boy kite. With light colored coat and vest and gay striped\r\ntrousers, the kite standing high in the air always attracts\r\nattention and affords splendid sport for the American youth in\r\nspringtime.\r\n\r\nIn making a boy kite it should be remembered that the larger the\r\nboy is the better he will fly. To construct the frame, two\r\nstraight sticks, say 3-1/2 ft. long, should serve for the legs and\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Frame for Boy Kite]\r\n\r\nbody; another straight stick forms the spine and should be about 2\r\nft. 4 in. long. For the arms, get a fourth straight stick about 3\r\nft. 3 in. long. Make the frame for the head by bending a light\r\ntough stick in a circle about 7 in. in diameter. Bind it tightly\r\nwith a strong thread and through its center run the spine. Then\r\ntack on the arm stick 3 in. under the circle so that the spinal\r\ncolumn crosses the arm stick exactly in the center. Wrap tightly\r\nwith strong thread and tack on the two sticks that are to serve\r\nfor the legs and body. The leg sticks should be fastened to the\r\narm stick about 6 in. on either side of the spinal column, and\r\ncrossed so that the other ends are 3 ft. apart. Tack them and the\r\narm stick together at the point where they intersect. Small hoops\r\nand cross stick of the same material as the head frame should be\r\nfastened to both extremities of the arm stick and the lower ends\r\nof the leg stick for the hands and feet. See that both hand frames\r\nare exactly alike and exercise equal caution regarding the foot\r\nframes; also see that the arm stick is at exact right angles with\r\nthe spine stick and that the kite joints are all firmly tied and\r\nthe kite evenly balanced; otherwise it may be lopsided. Fasten on\r\nthe strings of the frame, beginning at the neck at equal distances\r\nfrom the spine, as indicated by the dotted lines in the diagram.\r\nExtend a string slantingly from the arms tick to the head on both\r\nsides of the spinal column, and run all the other strings as shown\r\nin the cut, being careful that both sides of the frame correspond\r\nin measurements.\r\n\r\nTo cover the kite, select different colors of paper to suit your\r\ntaste, and after pasting them together, lay the paper on the floor\r\nand placing the frame on it, cut out the pattern. Leave an edge of\r\n1/2 in. all around and make a slit in this edge every 6 in. and at\r\neach angle; make the slits 2 in. apart around the head. After the\r\nkite is pasted and dry, paint the buttons, hair, eyes, hands,\r\nfeet, etc., as you desire. Arrange the "belly band" and tail band\r\nand attach the kite string in the same manner as in the ordinary\r\ncoffin-shaped kite.\r\n\r\nThe "lady kite" is made on the same principle as the boy kite. The\r\nframe may be made exactly as the boy kite and then "dressed" with\r\ntissue paper to represent a girl, or it may be made on the special\r\nframe, page 81. Remember the dotted lines represent the strings or\r\nthread, and the other lines indicate the kite sticks. Be careful\r\nwith your measurements so that each side of the kite corresponds\r\nexactly and is well balanced. Also see that every point where the\r\nsticks intersect is firmly tacked and bound.\r\n\r\nTo cover the kite, first paste together pieces of tissue paper of\r\ndifferent color to suit your taste. The paste should be made of\r\nflour and water and boiled. Make the seams or overlaps not quite\r\n3/8 in. wide. Lay the paper on the floor, using weights to hold it\r\ndown, and place the frame of the kite upon it. Then cut out the\r\npaper around the frame, leaving an edge of 1/2 in. Don\'t forget to\r\nmake a slit in the edge every 6 or 7 in. and at each angle. Around\r\nthe head the slits are cut 2 in. apart, as in the case of the boy\r\nkite. After the kite is dry, paint the paper as your fancy\r\ndictates.\r\n\r\nTo make the breast band, punch holes through the paper, one upon\r\neach side of the leg sticks, just above the bottom, and one upon\r\neach side of the arm sticks at the shoulder. Run one end of the\r\nstring through the hole at the bottom of the left limb and tie it\r\nto the leg stick; tie the other end at the right shoulder. Fasten\r\none end of another string of the same length at the bottom of the\r\nright leg; pass the string up across the first band and tie the\r\nother end at the left shoulder. Attach the kite string to the\r\nbreast band at the point where the two strings intersect. Tie the\r\nknot so that you can slide the kite string up or down until it is\r\nproperly adjusted. The tail band is made by tying a string to the\r\nleg sticks at the bottom of the breast band. Let the string hang\r\nslack below the skirt and attach the tail to the center. The same\r\ngeneral rules apply in attaching the string and tail to the boy\r\nkite.\r\n\r\nYou can make the lady look as if dancing and kicking in the clouds\r\nby making the feet of stiff pasteboard and allowing them to hang\r\nloose from the line which forms the bottom of the skirt. The feet\r\nwill move and sway with each motion of the kite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make Rubber Stamps [393]\r\n\r\nIndia rubber, especially prepared for stamp-making, should be\r\nprocured from a dealer or manufacturer, if good results are to be\r\nobtained. As an experiment, it is possible for an amateur to\r\nprepare the rubber, but, in such cases, it is always attended with\r\nuncertain results. The mixed uncured rubber comes in white sheets,\r\nstrong, firm and about 1/8 in. thick, and for its manipulation a\r\npress is indispensable, but can be home-made.\r\n\r\nFor the base of the press use a piece of iron, having two holes\r\ndrilled in it at the middle of opposite sides, through which pass\r\nbolts, letting the thread ends extend upward and counter-sinking\r\nplaces for the bolt heads to keep the under side of the base\r\nlevel. Solder the bolts in place at the base. The upper part of\r\nthe press, or the platen, is also of iron, cut so it can be swung\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fish Kettle Vulcanizer]\r\n\r\noff the bolts, rather than by removing the nuts and lifting it\r\noff. String a half dozen nuts, larger than those which screw on,\r\non each bolt, so that when the upper nut on each is screwed to the\r\nextent of the thread the pressure will be communicated through the\r\nnuts wedged in between the platen and the upper nut. The bolt\r\nholes in the platen should be directly over those in the base.\r\nDistance pieces of an exact thickness should be provided for use\r\non the base; these serve to keep the pressure even.\r\n\r\nIn preparing the mould, if type is to be copied, use rather large\r\ntype with wide spaces and set up with high quads and spaces, or\r\nthe type faces may be filled up by rubbing with either wax, or\r\nsoap, lightly brushing off any that remains loose. The type so set\r\nshould be locked into a frame. This may be made of two pieces of\r\nwood bolted together at both ends, or of printer\'s furniture.\r\nPlace it on a flat surface (marble is good, but any perfectly\r\nsmooth surface will do) and place distance pieces 1/8 in. higher\r\nthan its upper surface on either side of it. Apply olive oil to\r\nthe type faces and wipe off any excess. To form the matrix or\r\nreverse of the model, take a piece of iron larger than the\r\ninscription to be copied, and spread upon it to a depth of 1/4 in,\r\na putty made by mixing plaster of paris and water to the right\r\nconsistency. By means of a table knife spread the plaster smoothly\r\nand then invert the plate upon the model and press down until\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Vulcanizing Press for Rubber Stamps]\r\n\r\nthe distance pieces are struck. Let it set 10 minutes and then\r\nremove. If care has been taken the matrix will be perfect. After\r\nit has thoroughly dried, preferably in an oven, saturate it with\r\nan alcoholic solution of shellac to strengthen it.\r\n\r\nCut a piece of smooth rubber, large enough to cover the matrix,\r\nfrom the sheet, throw this into a box of talc, or powdered\r\nsoapstone, so that it receives a coating on both sides; dust a\r\nlittle of the powder over the matrix, also. Place the press on a\r\nsupport over a gas burner; or a kerosene lamp, and apply the heat.\r\nPlace the matrix on the base of the press, dust off the piece of\r\nindia rubber and place in the press upon the matrix and screw down\r\nthe platen. Heat the press to 284 deg. F. and keep screwing down\r\nthe platen so that the rubber, now soft and putty-like, is forced\r\ninto every recess of the matrix. A thermometer is not necessary;\r\nsome rubber always protrudes and the stage of the process can be\r\ntold from that. At first it is quite elastic, then as the heat\r\nincreases it becomes soft, then the curing begins and it again\r\nbecomes elastic, so that, if a point of a knife blade is pressed\r\nagainst it, it resumes its shape when the point is removed. When\r\nthis takes place it is then thoroughly vulcanized and the sheet\r\ncan be removed from the matrix. Ten minutes, under favorable\r\nconditions, is sufficient time for moulding the rubber. By means\r\nof common glue, or bicycle tire cement, fasten the rubber stamp to\r\na wooden handle.\r\n\r\nIt is possible to dispense with the press in making stamps, where\r\nthe work is not done in quantities, and use a hot flat-iron. The\r\nmatrix is placed on a stove at low heat, the rubber laid on and\r\nthe hot iron applied. But a few moments are required to mould it.\r\n\r\nAn old letter press if it be inclosed in a tin oven makes a good\r\npress, or all the necessary materials and apparatus can be\r\npurchased from a dealer. Any type such as all printers use will\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** To Light a Gaslight Without Matches [394]\r\n\r\nIt is probably well known that if you rub your feet briskly over a\r\ncarpet on a dry, cold day and then touch any metallic object with\r\nyour finger it will emit a small spark. The following amusing\r\nexperiment may be done on the same principle:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lamp Igniter]\r\n\r\nTake any small piece of wire about 2 in. long and twist it around\r\na gas burner as shown at A in the sketch. Have the tip of the\r\nburner about 1/8 in. below the end of the wire. The wire must be\r\njust far enough away from the center of the burner to keep it out\r\nof the flame, or else it will melt.\r\n\r\nNow get a friend to turn on the gas when you are ready for it. Go\r\naround the room once or twice rubbing your feet along the carpet.\r\nWhen you come around to the gaslight touch the point of the wire\r\nand if the gas is turned on, the light will flare right up as if\r\nit had been lit with a match.\r\n\r\nThis experiment cannot be done on a damp day or without shoes, and\r\nworks best in cold weather.\r\n--Contributed by E.

Use old boards, as new boards scare\r\nrabbits.\r\n\r\nFigure 1 shows how the box is made. It should be 4 in. wide and 6\r\nin. high\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Good Trap for Small Animals]\r\n\r\non the inside. The top and bottom boards project 1 in. beyond the\r\nside boards at the back and the end board is set in. The top board\r\nshould be 2 in. shorter than the sides at the front. Nail a strip\r\non the top board back of the door and one on the bottom board so\r\nthe game cannot push the door open from inside the trap and get\r\nout.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the top board bore a hole and put a crotched\r\nstick in for the lever to rest on. Bore another hole in the top of\r\nthe door for the lever to pass through. Two inches from the back\r\nof the box bore a hole for the trigger, which should be made out\r\nof heavy wire in the manner shown in Fig. 2. The door of the trap\r\nmust work easily and loosely.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Novel Electric Motor [395]\r\n\r\nThe materials necessary to make this motor are an old electric\r\nbell of the "buzzer" type and a cogwheel from an old clock.\r\n\r\nRemove the hammer-head and gong from the bell, then bend the end\r\nof the hammer into a loop, as in Fig. 1. Now make a little wire\r\ncatch like Fig. 2, and fasten its loop into the loop of the\r\nhammer. Mount the bell on a small board as in Fig. 3 and fasten\r\nthe cogwheel almost on a line with it. Now press down the hammer\r\nand place a nail in the position shown in the diagram so that the\r\ncatch touches one of the teeth.\r\n\r\nFasten the board in an upright position and attach two dry\r\nbatteries to the binding-posts. If properly connected, the\r\nfly-wheel will turn quite rapidly and with amazing force for so\r\nsmall a machine. The machine, however, has a fixed direction as\r\nshown by the arrow, but the belting can be arranged so as to send\r\nthe models in a reversed direction if required. The materials for\r\nthe motor should not cost more than\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Novel Electric Motor]\r\n\r\n25c for the bell and if you have an old bell it will cost next to\r\nnothing.\r\n--Contributed by Fred C.

The chemicals\r\nrequired are only four in number, and a comparatively small amount\r\nof each will suffice, so that the process can be tried without any\r\nvery great outlay.\r\n\r\nA dram of dextrine is mixed with 2 oz. of water and allowed to\r\ndissolve. It is then made up to 4 oz. with boiling water, and,\r\nwhen cold, a solution of 1 dr. of ammonium chloride in 2 oz. of\r\nwater is added. As this mixture does not keep well, it should be\r\nused as soon as possible after being made up.\r\n\r\nThe silk is soaked in the liquid until it is thoroughly saturated,\r\nwhich should take about four or five minutes, and it is then hung\r\nup to dry, suspending it, tightly stretched, from its two top\r\ncorners. The fabric when "salted," as this operation is termed,\r\nwill keep indefinitely. All these operations can be done in\r\ndaylight.\r\n\r\nThe next stage is the application of the sensitizer, for which\r\npurpose the two following solutions must be made up and then\r\nmixed:\r\n\r\n    Silver nitrate  120 gr.\r\n    Water             1 oz.\r\n\r\n    Citric acid      50 gr.\r\n    Water             1oz.\r\n\r\nThe mixture is spread evenly over the silk with a soft\r\ncamel\'s-hair brush. There must be no metal in the mounting of the\r\nbrush that is used.\r\n\r\nParticular care must be taken to see that no particle of the\r\nsurface of the silk is left uncovered. The best way to insure this\r\nis to brush the liquid over the silk, first in one direction and\r\nthen crosswise. The process of sensitizing must be done in a weak\r\nartificial light, such as at night by ordinary gas or lamp light,\r\nor in the very feeblest daylight.\r\n\r\nThe silk is then again fastened up and allowed to dry, but it is\r\nnow sensitive to the light and the drying must therefore be done\r\nin the dark. It is ready for printing as soon as it is dry, and as\r\nit does not keep well in the sensitive condition, it should be\r\nused up within a few days at the most.\r\n\r\nThe printing, which is done in daylight, is carried on in the same\r\nway as for printing-out papers, except that the silk should be\r\nprinted a little darker than usual. It will be found convenient to\r\ngum the edges slightly, and then to fix the silk on a stiff piece\r\nof paper before putting it into the printing frame. If this\r\nprecaution is not adopted there is a tendency for the silk to slip\r\nor crease when it is being examined. The silk must be handled\r\ncarefully while in the printing frame for this reason, but apart\r\nfrom that, there is no particular difficulty. The paper can be\r\ntaken off when the printing is finished.\r\n\r\nPrints on silk are toned, fixed and washed in the same way as\r\nordinary silver prints. The washing should be thorough, and before\r\nthe prints are quite dry, they should be ironed to remove all\r\ncreases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Removing Old Paint [396]\r\n\r\nA chair more than a hundred years old came to me by inheritance.\r\nIt was originally painted green and had been given two coats of\r\ndark paint or varnish within the last 30 years. Desiring to\r\nimprove the appearance of the relic, I decided to remove the paint\r\nand give it a mahogany stain. The usual paint removers would\r\nreadily take off the two latter coats but had no effect upon the\r\nfirst. I tried to remove the troublesome green in various ways,\r\nbut with little success until I applied a hot, saturated solution\r\nof concentrated lye. By coating the paint with this repeatedly,\r\napplying one coat upon another for two days, and then using a\r\nstiff brush, the layer was easily and completely removed.\r\n--Contributed by Thos. R. Baker, Chicago, Ill.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Window Lock [397]\r\n\r\nBore a hole through the sash of the lower window and halfway\r\nthrough the sash of the upper window, where they meet in the\r\ncenter, and insert a heavy nail or spike. This will fasten the\r\nsash together so well that nothing short of a crowbar can pry them\r\napart. The nail can be easily removed when the windows are to be\r\nopened.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Homemade Magnifying Glass [397]\r\n\r\nA very good magnifying glass can be made from an ordinary\r\nincandescent lamp of about 16-cp. size which has been rendered\r\nuseless by being burned out or having the filament broken. Grind\r\nor break off the tip end of the globe and fill with water. Put in\r\nclear water and plug or cork up the hole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Trailer for a Bicycle [397]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1; Trailer Attached to a Bicycle]\r\n\r\nInstead of using a seat on the handlebars or frame of a bicycle\r\nfor my little girl, I made a trailer, as shown in Fig. 1, to\r\nattach to the rear axle. I made it from old bicycle parts. The\r\nhandlebars, which form the back of the seat, fasten into the seat\r\npost of an old bicycle attached to the trailer axle. The trailer\r\nis attached to the rear axle of the bicycle with two arms or\r\nforks, on the ends of which are two forgings, formerly used on the\r\nrear ends of a bicycle frame, brazed in, and one of the tube\r\nprojections cut off from each to make a hook, as shown in Fig. 2.\r\nThe piece marked E shows one of these forgings or hooks in\r\nsection. The original axle of the bicycle was removed and one\r\n1-5/16 in. longer supplied, which was turned below the threads for\r\nclearance, as shown at A. A washer, D, with a hexagon hole was\r\nfitted over the regular nut C, on the axle, and filed tapering so\r\nthe forging or hook E, on the trailer attachment, could be kept in\r\nposition. The washer F is held tightly against the hook by\r\npressure from a spring, G. The spring is held in place by a small\r\nnut, H, and cotter pin, 1. This attachment makes a flexible joint\r\nfor turning corners. When turning from right to left the left hook\r\non the trailer fork stays in\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2-The Hook in Position]\r\n\r\nposition, while the right hook pushes the washer F outward and\r\nrelieves the strain on the fork. This attachment also makes it\r\neasy to remove the trailer from the bicycle. The washers F are\r\npushed outward and the hook raised off the axle.\r\n--Contributed by John F. Grieves, Providence, R. I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Home-Made Telephone Transmitter [398]\r\n\r\nThe parts for transmitting the sound are encased in a covering, H,\r\nmade from the gong of an old electric bell. A round button, D, is\r\nturned or filed from the carbon electrode of an old\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Telephone Transmitter]\r\n\r\ndry cell and a hole drilled through the center to fit in a\r\nbinding-post taken from the same battery cell. This button must be\r\ncarefully insulated from the shell, H, by running the binding-post\r\nthrough a piece of small rubber tube where it passes through the\r\nhole and placing a rubber or paper washer, F, under the carbon\r\nbutton, and an insulating washer under the nut on the outside.\r\nThis will provide one of the terminals of the instrument.\r\nConstruct a paper tube having the same diameter as the button and\r\nwith a length equal to the depth of the bell case, less 1/8 in.\r\nGlue or paste this tube to the button so it will form a paper cup\r\nwith a carbon bottom.\r\n\r\nThe diaphragm, B, which is the essential part of the instrument,\r\nshould be made as carefully as possible from ferrotype tin,\r\ncommonly called tintype tin. Cut a circular piece from this metal\r\nthe exact size of the outside of the shell. A hole is made in the\r\ncenter of the disk a little larger than a binding-post that is\r\ntaken from another old battery cell. When making the hole in the\r\ndisk be careful not to bend or crease the tin. Scrape the black\r\ncoating from the tin around the outside about 1/4 in. wide and a\r\nplace about 1 in. in diameter at the center.\r\n\r\nThe second electrode, C, is made the same as D, and fastened to\r\nthe tin diaphragm with the binding post without using any\r\ninsulation. A third binding post, G, is fastened to the shell\r\nthrough a drilled hole to make the other terminal. The mouthpiece,\r\nA, may be turned from wood in any shape desired, but have a flange\r\non the back side that will make a tight fit with the outside of\r\nthe shell.\r\n\r\nFill the paper tube with powdered carbon, E, which can be made by\r\npounding and breaking up pieces of carbon to about the size of pin\r\nheads. Powdered carbon can be purchased, but if you make it be\r\nsure to sift out all the very fine particles. Assemble the parts\r\nas shown and the transmitter is ready for use. If speech is not\r\nheard distinctly, put in a little more, or remove some of the\r\ncarbon and try it out until you get the instrument working nicely.\r\n--Contributed by Harold H.

Fasten\r\ncanvas or cotton cloth to the ends of the ribs and let it hang so\r\nthat the bottom edge will touch the ground. Light ropes can be\r\ntied to the ends of the ribs and fastened to stakes driven in the\r\nground in a tent-like manner to make the whole more substantial\r\nand to stand against a heavy wind. This makes an exceptionally\r\nfine tent, as the umbrella\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lawn Tent Complete]\r\n\r\nis waterproof; also, there is more room to stand up in than in a\r\ntent that is in the shape of a wigwam.\r\n--Contributed by J.A. Whamer, Schenectady, N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Windmill of One or Two Horsepower for Practical\r\nPurposes [399]\r\n\r\nA windmill for developing from 1/2 to 2 hp. may be constructed at\r\nhome, the expense being very small and the results highly\r\nsatisfactory.\r\n\r\nThe hub for the revolving fan wheel is first constructed. One good\r\nway to get both the hub, lining, shaft and spokes for the blades,\r\nis to go to a wheelwright\'s and purchase the wheel and axle of\r\nsome old rig. There are always a number of discarded carriages,\r\nwagons or parts thereof in the rear of the average blacksmith\'s\r\nshop. Sometimes for half a dollar, and often for nothing, you can\r\nget a wheel, an axle, and connected parts. Remove from the wheel,\r\nall but the four spokes needed for the fans as in Fig. 1. The same\r\nhub, axle and bearings will do. In case you cannot secure a wheel\r\nand shaft, the hub may be made from a piece of hardwood, about 4\r\nin. in diameter and 6 in. long. A 2-in. hole should be bored\r\nthrough for a wooden shaft, or a 1-1/2-in. hole for a metal shaft.\r\nThe hub may be secured by putting two or three metal pins through\r\nhub and shaft. Adjust the spokes by boring holes for them and\r\narrange them so that they extend from the center A, like B. The\r\nwheel is then ready for the blades. These\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig.1; Windmill]\r\n\r\nblades should be of sheet metal or thin hardwood. The sizes may\r\nvary according to the capacity of the wheel and amount of room for\r\nthe blades on the spokes. Each one is tilted so as to receive the\r\nforce of the wind at an angle, which adjustment causes the wheel\r\nto revolve when the wind pressure is\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2, Fig. 3]\r\n\r\nstrong enough. Secure the blades to the spokes by using little\r\nmetal cleats, C and D. Bend these metal strips to suit the form of\r\nthe spokes and flatten against the blades and then insert the\r\nscrews to fasten the cleats to the wood. If sheet metal blades are\r\nused, rivets should be used for fastening them.\r\n\r\nThe stand for the wheel shaft is shown in Fig. 2. Arrange the base\r\npiece in platform order, (J). This is more fully shown in Fig. 5.\r\nOn top of this base piece, which is about 36 in. long, place the\r\nseat or ring for the revolving table. The circular seat is\r\nindicated at I, Fig. 1. This ring is like an inverted cheese box\r\ncover with the center cut out. It can be made by a tinner. Size of\r\nring outside, 35 in. The shoulders are 4 in. high and made of tin\r\nalso. Form the shoulder by soldering the piece on. Thus we get a\r\nsmooth surface with sides for the mill base to turn in so as to\r\nreceive the wind at each point to advantage. The X-shaped piece H\r\nrests in the tin rim. The X-form, however, does not show in this\r\nsketch, but in Fig. 5, where it is marked S. This part is made of\r\ntwo pieces of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4]\r\n\r\n2-in. plank, about 3 in. wide, arranged so that the two pieces\r\ncross to make a letter X. When the pieces join, mortise them one\r\ninto the other so as to secure a good joint. Adjust the uprights\r\nfor sustaining the wheel shaft to the X-pieces as shown at E, E,\r\nFig. 2. These are 4 by 4 in. pieces of wood, hard pine preferred,\r\nplaned and securely set up in the X-pieces by mortising into the\r\nsame. Make the bearings for the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5]\r\n\r\nwheel shaft in the uprights and insert the shaft.\r\n\r\nThe gearing for the transmission of the power from the wheel shaft\r\nto the shaft calculated for the delivery of the power at an\r\naccessible point below must next be adjusted. The windmill is\r\nintended for installation on top of a building, and the power may\r\nbe transmitted below, or to the top of a stand specially erected\r\nfor the purpose. It is a good plan to visit some of the\r\nsecond-hand machinery dealers and get four gears, a pulley and a\r\nshaft. Gears about 5 in. in diameter and beveled will be required.\r\nAdjust the first pair of the beveled gears as at F and G. If the\r\nwheel shaft is metal, the gear may be set-screwed to the shaft, or\r\nkeyed to it. If the shaft is hardwood, it will be necessary to\r\narrange for a special connection. The shaft may be wrapped with\r\nsheet metal and this metal fastened on with screws. Then the gear\r\nmay be attached by passing a pin through the set-screw hole and\r\nthrough the shaft. The upright shaft like the wheel shaft is best\r\nwhen of metal. This shaft is shown extending from the gear, G, to\r\na point below. The object is to have the shaft reach to the point\r\nwhere the power is received for the service below. The shaft is\r\nshown cut off at K. Passing to Fig. 3 the shaft is again taken up\r\nat L. It now passes through the arrangement shown, which device is\r\nrigged up to hold the shaft and delivery wheel P in place. This\r\nshaft should also be metal. Secure the beveled gears M and N as\r\nshown. These transmit the power from the upright shaft to the\r\nlower horizontal shaft. Provide the wheel or pulley, P, with the\r\nnecessary belt to carry the power from this shaft to the point of\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nThe tail board of the windmill is illustrated in Fig. 4. A good\r\nway to make this board is to use a section of thin lumber and\r\nattach it to the rear upright, E of Fig. 2. This may be done by\r\nboring a hole in the upright and inserting the shaft of the\r\ntail-piece. In Fig. 4 is also shown the process of fastening a\r\ngear, R, to the shaft. The set screws enter the hub from the two\r\nsides and the points are pressed upon\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6]\r\n\r\nthe shaft, thus holding the gear firmly in place. The platform for\r\nthe entire wheel device is shown in Fig. 5. The X-piece S is bored\r\nthrough in the middle and the upright shaft passes through. The\r\ntin run-way or ring is marked T, and the X-piece very readily\r\nrevolves in this ring, whenever the wind alters and causes the\r\nwheel\'s position to change. The ring and ring base are secured to\r\nthe platform, U. The latter is made of boards nailed to the\r\ntimbers of the staging for supporting the mill. This staging is\r\nshown in Fig. 6, in a sectional view. The ring with its X-piece is\r\nmarked V, the X-piece is marked W, and the base for the part, and\r\nthe top of the stage is marked X. The stage is made of 2 by 4-in.\r\nstock. The height may vary, according to the requirements. If the\r\naffair is set up on a barn or shed, the staging will be sufficient\r\nto support the device. But if the stage is constructed direct from\r\nthe ground, it will be necessary to use some long timbers to get\r\nthe wheel up high enough to receive the benefit of the force of\r\nthe wind. Proceeding on the plan of the derrick stand, as shown in\r\nFig. 6, a stage of considerable height can be obtained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** To Renew Old Dry Batteries [401]\r\n\r\nRemove the paper that covers the cell and knock several good-sized\r\nholes in the zinc shell. Place the battery in a glass jar, fill it\r\ntwo-thirds full of strong sal ammoniac (or salt) solution and\r\nconnect the terminals to whatever apparatus the current is to be\r\nused for.

It is very easily made and\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Electric Motor]\r\n\r\nif you have an old electro-magnet will cost practically nothing.\r\n\r\nA large soft-iron wheel is mounted on an axle with a pulley-wheel\r\non one end and a circuit breaker on the other end. The teeth on\r\nthe circuit-breaker must be the same number as on the soft-iron\r\nwheel.\r\n\r\nThe electro-magnet is mounted so that its core is level with the\r\naxle and in a line with the wheel. One wire from it is attached to\r\none binding screw and the other end is grounded to the iron frame\r\nthat supports it. This frame is connected to the frame supporting\r\nthe wheel. A small brush presses on the circuit-breaker and is\r\nconnected to the other binding screw.\r\n\r\nIn the diagram A represents the iron wheel; B, the brush; C, the\r\ncircuit breaker; D, the magnet. The wire connecting the two frames\r\nis shown by a dotted line.\r\n\r\nTo start the motor, attach your battery to the screws and turn the\r\nwheel a little. The magnet attracts one of\' the teeth on the\r\nwheel, but as soon as it is parallel with the core of the magnet\r\nthe circuit is broken and the momentum of the wheel brings another\r\ntooth to be attracted.\r\n\r\nTo reverse the motor reverse the connections and start the wheel\r\nthe other way. Be sure that the frames are screwed down well or\r\nthe motor will run jerkily and destroy the connections.\r\n--Contributed by F.

Any tool a boy can obtain is apt to be of use to him,\r\nchisel, bit, jack-knife or hammer.\r\n\r\nFigure 1 shows what two boys did with old cycle wheels. They went\r\nto some junk shops where the concerns had purchased cast-away\r\nbicycles and noticed that there were numerous wheels in very good\r\norder that could be selected from among the sets of wheels with\r\nbroken or bent rims, spokes, burst tires, etc. In fact, the lads\r\nhad no trouble in getting several sets of bicycle wheels in good\r\ncondition for very little money. These wheels were taken to the\r\nback-yard shop of the boys where the young fellows had rigged up a\r\nshed-like affair and put in a bench. The previous Christmas one of\r\nthe boys received a box of tools as a gift, in which was included\r\na little hand vise and the required tools for general boy\'s\r\nhandiwork.\r\n\r\nFour of the cycle wheels they used in making the hand-propelled\r\nvehicle shown at Fig. 1.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2]\r\n\r\nA wooden body, A, made of smooth boards rests upon shafts. Fixed\r\non this body is an upright carrying the sprocket B. The upright is\r\na piece of wood about 10 in. high and 4 in. wide, fitted with one\r\nof the bearings from the cycle. The regular cycle chain sprocket\r\nis used at B as well as upon the shaft. The regular chain of the\r\ncycle is likewise employed, so, when buying the wheels, it is well\r\nto select one or more chains with corresponding sprockets from the\r\njunk heap. The detail of the adjustment of the parts is shown in\r\nnext views. The letter D signifies the seat which is a box. The\r\nsteering gear is a bent iron rod, also found in the waste pile of\r\nthe junk shop, and is bent to right form by heating and bending\r\nover on a rock or any solid matter. The steering rod is marked E.\r\nIt fits into a socket in the shaft of the forward wheels.\r\n\r\nFigure 2 shows the construction of the cart below. The cog is\r\nkeyed or set-screwed to the driving shaft of the wheels with\r\neither key or set-screw used in original fastening, as the case\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3, 4 Driving Shaft and Disk for Steering Gear]\r\n\r\nmay be. The chain is marked F, and there is a slot cut in the\r\nfloor of the cart to let the chain pass up and through to the cog\r\non the propelling shaft crank. The disk which receives the\r\nsteering rod is at G. The forward shaft bears only at the center\r\nupon a disk of metal, consisting of any circular piece found among\r\nthe pieces of iron or brass at the junk store. One can get nearly\r\nall the mechanical parts in junk establishments that purchase\r\nparts of out-of-date or cast-away bicycles. The detail of the\r\ndriving shaft is shown at Fig. 3. The sprocket wheel is at H and\r\nthis is just as it is taken from the original bicycle shaft. The\r\nbearings consist of wires looped around the shaft and inserted\r\ninto holes bored in metal plates as shown. These plates are\r\nscrewed to the bottom of the cart. The shaft itself is found in\r\nrods or even cast-away metal axles which are commonly found in\r\nmost any carriage works, cycle shops or junk dealer\'s. Figure 4\r\nshows the disk that receives the steering gear. The disk is bored\r\naround edges for the securing screws, while the center is open for\r\nthe steering rod.

On the end of the shaft will be\r\nfound a round plate,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1]\r\n\r\nin which drill four 3/16-in. holes. Now secure, or have turned, a\r\npiece of iron or steel 1-1/2 in. in diameter, Fig. 2. Drill and\r\ncountersink four 3/16-in. holes in it to fit the holes on the\r\nshaft plate. File a spur center 5/16 in. long, and two side points\r\n3/16 in. long. Bolt this plate to the shaft plate with four\r\nflat-headed stove bolts, 3/16 in. in diameter by 5/8 or 3/4 in.\r\nlong, Fig. 3.\r\n\r\nFor the bed, use a board 32 in., long and as wide as the base of\r\nthe machine arm. This gives a limit of 2 ft. between spur and dead\r\ncenters. Let this board be made level with the rest of machine\r\ntable by making a pair of legs if needed. Next make a T-rail, Fig.\r\n4, of two boards, one 5 by 3/4 by 32 in., the other 3-1/2 by 3/4\r\nby 32 in. Threequarter inch of the wider board projects over each\r\nof the smaller boards. Nail firmly and clinch nails, or screw\r\ntogether. Screw this rail on the machine board so that its center\r\ncoincides exactly with the machine centers. Bore a number of\r\n3/8-in. holes with centers 2-3/4 in. apart along the center line\r\nof this rail, beginning 6 in. from the end nearest the machine.\r\nMake another T-rail for slide tool rest, of two pieces 32 by 3 by\r\n3/4 in., and 32 by 1-1/2 by 3/4 in. Fasten this in front of the\r\nlarger T-rail and parallel to it, the center lines being 6-1/2 in.\r\napart.\r\n\r\nTo make the tail-piece, that is, the part to hold wood to be\r\nturned, get a board 6-1/2 by 7 by 3/4 in., and on the edges, Fig.\r\n5, A, screw two pieces 7 by 3/4 by 1-1/2 in. so that the cap thus\r\nmade will fit snugly over the large T-rail. Fasten to these last\r\ntwo pieces,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4]\r\n\r\nwith screws, two more pieces 7 by 3/4 by 3/4 in., Fig. 5, B. This\r\ntail-piece should move smoothly back and forth with no side\r\nmotion. Now get a block of hardwood 4 by 2-1/4 in., and 1-3/4 in.\r\nhigher than the spur center when mounted on the middle of the\r\ntailpiece just described. At exactly the height of the spur center\r\nbore through this block a 3/4-in. hole, Fig. 5. Have\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2]\r\n\r\na blacksmith make a crank 8 in. long, threaded for 5 in. as shown.\r\nAt the dead center end taper the crank and make a cup center, out\r\nof which allow a 3/16-in. point to project. The cup prevents the\r\npoint from boring into\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3]\r\n\r\nwood too rapidly. One inch from the outer end of the crank block,\r\nFig. 5, bore a 3/16-in. hole, and force a 1/4-in. bolt to cut its\r\nthread in the wood. This is a set screw to hold the crank in any\r\nposition desired. Place a strap nut, threaded to fit the crank, on\r\nthe head-end of the crank block, and a plain nut to act as a\r\nbearing, on the crank end. One and one-half inches from the back\r\nof the tail-piece bore a 3/8-in. hole. Make a peg 3/8 by 2 in. To\r\nput in a piece of wood to turn, move the tail-piece back until the\r\nhead end is over the center of the hole nearest the end of the\r\nblock, then the peg will slip into second hole from the head end\r\nof the tail-piece, and into a corresponding T-rail hole, pinning\r\nthe two together. Insert wood and screw up dead center to hold it.\r\n\r\nFor a tool rest make a second piece like the base of the\r\ntail-piece, 11 in. long and fitting the small T-rail. Cut out two\r\nblocks 1-1/2 by 2-1/4 by 3/4 in. and screw them, one on each end\r\nof the base of the tool rest, covering the half farthest from the\r\ncenters, and having an 8-in. space between blocks. On the tops of\r\nthese blocks screw a strip 11 by 2-1/4 by 3/4 in. Now for the rest\r\nproper, cut out a board 8 by 11/16 by 9 in. to slide in the slot\r\nof the rest. Take a piece of oak 11 by 2 in., and high enough so\r\nthat the top will be level with the centers of the lathe, and\r\nbevel as shown in Fig. 6. Screw on one end of the 8 by 9-in. piece\r\nexactly in the middle. This piece will slide in and out, closer or\r\nfarther from the centers as desired, and also along the T-rail.\r\n\r\nA center for turning rosettes, saucers, etc., may be made as\r\nfollows: Remove the spur center and bolt in its place a 1-in.\r\ncircular board of the same\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5]\r\n\r\ndiameter, using longer 3/16-in. stove bolts with heads\r\ncountersunk. Rotate the lathe, and with a gimlet bore a hole at\r\nthe exact center and through the board. Now take off the board and\r\ncountersink on the back a place for the head of a coarse threaded\r\nscrew. Turn in a 1-3/4 -in. screw, replace the board and any block\r\nheld on the end of the rotating screw will turn on and be held\r\nwhile being turned.\r\n--Contributed by L. L.

Cut the pasteboard into two covers, 1/4 in.\r\nlarger all around than the magazine, except at the back with which\r\nthey should be even. Next cut a strip 1 in. wide off the back of\r\neach cover. Place the covers on the cloth, Fig. 1, with the back\r\nedges 1/4 in. farther apart than the thickness of the volume to be\r\nbound. Cut the cloth around the covers, leaving 1-1/2 in. margin.\r\nPaste the cloth on the covers as they lay, and turn over the 1-1/2\r\nin. margin, pasting down smoothly. Cut a piece of stiff paper to\r\nfit and paste on the back. Take a piece of cloth as wide as the\r\ncover, and long enough to extend over the back and 1-1/2 in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plan of Magazine Binder]\r\n\r\nBeyond each "strip." Paste on to hold all together. Two pieces of\r\npaper the exact size of the magazine, pasted on the inside of each\r\ncover protects the edges of the cloth, and adds to the appearance.\r\nLet dry slowly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Magazine Binder Complete]\r\n\r\nWith backs and edges of magazines even, place in a vise and set up\r\ntight allowing 3/4 in. from back to show above the vise. Bore\r\nthree 3/16-in. holes 1/2 in. from the back, one in the middle, the\r\nother two 1-1/2 in. from each end. Make corresponding holes in the\r\nstrips of the binder and use the shoestring to complete as in Fig.\r\n2.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Temporary Spline [406]\r\n\r\nA piece of wire solder makes a good temporary spline for the\r\ndraftsman.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Library Set in Pyro-Carving [407]\r\nBy HELEN WESTINGHOUSE\r\n\r\nThe multitude of indifferently executed small articles which\r\nfollowed the introduction of pyrography is beginning to disappear.\r\nPeople are considering the art more seriously and\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Table and Seat Decorated in Pyro-Carving]\r\n\r\napplying it to more dignified uses. Pyro-carving is one of the new\r\nmethods of decorating furniture which is both beautiful and\r\npractical, two qualities which do not always go together.\r\n\r\nThe library set illustrated consists of a table, 30 to 50 in.,\r\nwith two benches, 14 in. wide, of the same length. The supports\r\nare made of selected white pine, which must be absolutely free\r\nfrom pitch. The pine is soft enough to work easily with the point\r\nand stands wear much better than basswood. The tops and braces are\r\nmade of curly fir. All of the material must be 2-in. lumber, which\r\ndresses to about 1-1/2 in. All surfaces, except the faces of the\r\nsupports, are given a well rubbed coat of oil with a little burnt\r\number, the stain to be applied directly to the wood without a\r\nfiller.\r\n\r\nOn the outside of the supports the design is drawn in with pencil,\r\nthe background is then cut out smoothly with a chisel to the depth\r\nof an eighth of an inch, leaving the decoration in relief. It is\r\nthen burned deeply, the background in straight flat strokes, the\r\noutlines having the effect of a sloping, dark edge. The shadows\r\nare burned in as deeply as possible and the shading is put in with\r\nthe flat of the point.\r\n\r\nA wax or eggshell oil-varnish finish is most suitable for this\r\nset, but any other finish may be applied, as the builder may\r\ndesire, to make it harmonize with other furnishings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Cleaning Brass [407]\r\n\r\nSmall brass castings can be cleaned by heating them slightly and\r\nthen dipping them in a solution of sal ammoniac. The pieces will\r\ncome out as bright and clean as if new. This cleaning process is\r\nthe same as that used in cleaning a soldering iron.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Phoneidoscope [407]\r\n\r\nThe phoneidoscope has many and varied forms, but the simplest can\r\nbe made by bending the forefinger and thumb so as to form a circle\r\nand then drawing a soap film across the opening. This is done in a\r\nmanner similar to the blowing of soap bubbles. The angle with the\r\ndirection of the light may be readily adjusted by turning the\r\nwrist, a motion of the elbow alters the distance from the mouth\r\nand the tension of the film can be regulated by moving the thumb\r\nand forefinger. Singing or speaking at the film when under proper\r\ntension will cause beautiful figures to appear, which may be\r\nreflected from the film directly on the screen.\r\n--Contributed by Robt. E. Bradley, Winchester, Mass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Home-Made Yankee Bobsled [408]\r\n\r\nA good coasting sled, which I call a Yankee bob, can be made from\r\ntwo hardwood barrel staves, two pieces of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Runners Made of Barrel Staves]\r\n\r\n2 by 6-in. pine, a piece of hardwood for the rudder and a few\r\npieces of boards. The 2 by 6-in. pieces should be a little longer\r\nthan one-third the length of the staves, and each piece cut\r\ntapering from the widest part, 6 in., down to 2 in., and then\r\nfastened to the staves with large wood screws as shown in Fig. 1.\r\nBoards 1 in. thick are nailed on top of the pieces for a seat and\r\nto hold the runners together. The boards should be of such a\r\nlength as to make the runners about 18 in. apart.\r\n\r\nA 2-in. shaft of wood, Fig. 2, is turned down to 1 in. on the ends\r\nand put through holes that must be bored in the front ends of the\r\n2 by 6-in. pieces. A small pin is put through each end of the\r\nshaft to keep it in place. The rudder is a 1-1/2-in. hardwood\r\npiece which should be tapered to 1/2 in. at the bottom and shod\r\nwith a thin piece of iron. A 1/2-in. hole is bored through the\r\ncenter of the shaft and a lag screw put through and turned in the\r\nrudder piece, making it so the rudder will turn right and left\r\nand, also, up and down. Two cleats are nailed to the upper sides\r\nof the runners and in the middle lengthways for the person\'s heels\r\nto rest against.\r\n\r\nAny child can guide this bob, as all he has to do is to guide the\r\nrudder right and left to go in the direction named. If he wants to\r\nstop, he pulls up on the handle and the heel of the rudder will\r\ndig into the snow, causing too much friction for the sled to go\r\nany further.\r\n--Contributed by Wm.

However, a lens having a reasonable\r\nmagnifying power can be made in a few minutes for almost nothing.\r\nTake a piece of glass tubing, heat one place in a hot flame, hold\r\none end and pull on the other and draw the heated place down to a\r\nfine string as shown in Fig. 1. Take about 3 in. of this fine tube\r\nand heat one end which will form a glass bead as shown in Fig. 2.\r\nThis bead is the lens. When in this form it can be used only in an\r\nartificial light coming from one direction, but if you take a\r\npiece of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lens Formed by Heat]\r\n\r\ncardboard and bore a hole in it a little smaller than the bead on\r\nthe glass tube which is forced into the hole, Fig 3, you can use\r\nthis mounted lens in ordinary daylight. In this case a mirror must\r\nbe used to reflect the light up through the lens. It is difficult\r\nto see anything at first, as the lens must be held very close to\r\nthe eye, but in practice you will soon learn to see the object as\r\nit appears enlarged.\r\n\r\nIf you soak a little dried grass or hay in water for a few days\r\nand look at a drop of this water, germs in various life forms can\r\nbe seen. The water must be put on the lens. One thing to remember\r\nis that the smaller the lens, the greater the magnifying power.\r\n--Contributed by Daniel Gray, Decatur, Illinois.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Freezing Pipes [409]\r\n\r\nThe water in hot water supply pipes will freeze quicker than water\r\nthat has not been heated. This is because the air, which is a poor\r\nconductor of heat, has been driven out by the heat.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Carry Books [409]\r\n\r\nAlmost all school children carry their books with a strap put\r\naround and b u c k led very tight. This will make dents in the\r\ncover where the board overlaps the body of the book. If the strap\r\nis left loose, the books are liable to slip out. Place the cover\r\nof one book between the cover and fly leaf of its neighbor and the\r\ndifficulty will be remedied. This will place the books in\r\nalternate directions. Books stacked in this manner do not require\r\nthe strap buckled tight, or, they can be carried without any strap\r\njust as well.\r\n--Contributed by Thos.

The twine may be colored in any color or\r\ncombination of colors desired. A Roman stripe at each end of the\r\nhammock makes a pretty effect.\r\n\r\nA hammock 45 in. wide will not be too large for solid comfort. To\r\nknit it first thread the big needle and holding it in the left\r\nhand, hold the cord in place with the thumb until you have looped\r\nthe cord over the tongue, then pass the cord under the needle to\r\nthe opposite side and catch it over the tongue. Repeat this\r\noperation until the needle is full. Cut a 2-yd. length of cord and\r\nmake a loop and fasten to the door knob or to some other\r\nconvenient place. Tie the cord on the needle to this loop 3 in.\r\nfrom the end of the loop. Place the small mesh stick under the\r\ncord with the beveled edge close to the loop, and, with a thumb on\r\nthe cord to hold it in place, pass the needle around the stick and\r\nthen, point downward, pass it through the loop from the top, and\r\nthen bring it over the stick so forming the first half of the\r\nknot.\r\n\r\nPull this tight and hold in place with a thumb while throwing the\r\ncord over your hand, which forms the loop. Pass the needle from\r\nunder through the loops and draw fast to fasten the knot. Hold\r\nthis in place and repeat the operation.\r\n\r\nMake 30 of these knots and then push them off the stick and\r\nproceed in the same way with the next row, passing the needle\r\nfirst through each of the 30 knots made for the first row. Make 30\r\nrows and then tie the last loops to the other iron ring.\r\nStretchers may be made and put in place and the hammock, strong\r\nand durable, is finished. The work must be carefully and evenly\r\ndone. One is apt to have a little trouble getting the first row\r\nright, but after that the work proceeds quite rapidly.\r\n\r\nHow to Obtain Cheap Dry Batteries [410]\r\n\r\nNot very many people realize that good, serviceable dry cells can\r\nbe obtained from an automobile garage very cheap. These cells\r\nhaving been "run out" beyond the required number of amperes for\r\nautomobile use, will give excellent service, considering their\r\ncost. Many of them will give two-thirds of their original\r\namperage. Six of such cells have been in use on my door-bell\r\ncircuit for nearly a year.

Yes, certainly,\r\nyou can look into the water and see the fish that are there\r\nswimming about, if you have the proper equipment. What you need is\r\na water telescope. This is a device made of wood or metal with one\r\nend of glass. When the glass end is submerged, by looking in at\r\nthe open end, objects in the water are made plainly visible to a\r\nconsiderable depth. In Norway, the fishermen use the water\r\ntelescope regularly in searching for herring shoals or cod.\r\n\r\nAll that is necessary to make a wooden water telescope is a long\r\nwooden box, a piece of glass for one\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wooden Water Telescope]\r\n\r\nend and some paint and putty for making the seams watertight. Fix\r\nthe glass in one end of the box, and leave the other open to look\r\nthrough.\r\n\r\nA tin water telescope is more convenient than the wooden one, but\r\nmore difficult to make, The principal essential for this is a\r\ncircular piece of glass for the large end. A funnel shaped tin\r\nhorn will do for the rest. Solder in the glass at the large end\r\nand the telescope is made. Sinkers consisting of strips of lead\r\nshould be soldered on near the bottom to counteract the buoyancy\r\nof the air contained in the watertight funnel and also helps to\r\nsubmerge the big end. The inside of the funnel should be painted\r\nblack to prevent the light from being reflected on the bright\r\nsurface of the tin. If difficulty is found in obtaining a circular\r\npiece of glass, the bottom may be made square and square glass\r\nused. Use plain, clear glass; not magnifying glass. To picnic\r\nparties the water telescope is of great amusement, revealing\r\nnumerous odd sights in the water which many have never seen\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Rid Your Yard of Cats [411]\r\n\r\nThe following is a description of a device I built at my home in\r\nBrooklyn, which not only gave us relief from the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Electric Apparatus for Driving Away Cats]\r\n\r\nnightly feline concerts, but also furnished much amusement to my\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\nI first ran two bare copper wires along the top of the fence about\r\n1 in. apart, fastening them down with small staples, care being\r\ntaken that they did not touch. To the ends of these wires I\r\nfastened ordinary insulated bell wire, running them to the house\r\nand connecting them to the upper binding-posts of an induction\r\ncoil; I then ran a wire from the lower binding-post of my coil\r\nthrough the batteries back to the other lower binding-post of\r\ncoil, breaking the circuit by putting in an ordinary switch. The\r\nmore batteries used, the stronger the current. The switch should\r\nalways be left open, as it uses up the current very rapidly.\r\n\r\nWhen "tabby" is well on the wires I close the switch and she goes\r\nthe length of the fence in bounds, often coming back to see what\r\nthe trouble is, thus receiving another shock.\r\n--Contributed by Charles L.

Various devices are used to keep\r\nthe film straight, and\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pins Keep the Film Straight]\r\n\r\npush pins or thumb tacks are supplied with almost all of them. The\r\nillustration shows a simple and inexpensive device constructed of\r\ncommon wood clothespins without any metal pins to come in contact\r\nwith the film and cause rust streaks. A pair of pins are fastened\r\nat each end of the film by pushing one pin over the other which in\r\nturn is clamped on the film. A string tied to the heads of one\r\npair of pins provides a way to hang the whole on a nail. The lower\r\npair of pins makes a weight to keep the film straight.\r\n--Contributed by J.

Then layoff a concentric circle of 1/4 in. greater\r\nradius. Cut out along the lines of the large circle. On the line\r\nof the small circle mark with a prick punch or nail a series of\r\nslight dents, about 1/4 in. apart, all the way around. Now make\r\ncuts from the line of the large circle to these dents, stopping\r\nwhen the shears give the little "click" on entering the dent. Bend\r\nthe little tongues thus formed alternately to the right and left,\r\nthen by shaping them with some care you will have a good running\r\nsurface for the belt. It will not make any difference if there are\r\nmore tongues on one side than the other, or if they are not\r\nequally spaced, within reason.\r\n\r\nFor the hub, solder or rivet a "handle" across the center hole and\r\ndrill a hole through it of the same size as the center hole. With\r\nthe help of solder a grooved pulley which will answer almost every\r\nexperimental purpose may be made, and it is remarkable with how\r\nslight care a perfectly true wheel may be made in this manner.\r\n\r\nThe same principle might in some way be applied to gear-wheels,\r\nfor light and temporary use.\r\n--Contributed by C.

Make a design on a piece of paper. The accompanying\r\nsketch offers a suggestion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Etched Copper Picture Frame]\r\n\r\nIf the design is to be symmetrical, draw a line down the middle of\r\nthe paper, make one-half the fold and trace the remaining half by\r\nplacing a piece of double-surfaced carbon paper between the\r\nhalves. Fasten this design with a little paste on the copper at\r\ntwo of its corners and trace it on the copper by means of the\r\ncarbon paper.\r\n\r\nRemove the paper, and, with a small brush and black varnish or\r\nasphaltum paint, cover the part not to be eaten by the acid of the\r\nbath into which the metal is to be immersed. Two or three coats\r\nwill be necessary to withstand the acid. The conventional trees,\r\nthe border as shown in the illustration, and the back are covered\r\nwith the varnish or asphaltum.\r\n\r\nThe etching solution should be put in a stone vessel of some kind\r\nand care should be taken not to allow it to get on the hands or\r\nclothes. A stick should be used to handle the metal while it is in\r\nthe solution. This solution is made by putting in the stone jar\r\nthe following: Water a little more than one-half, nitric acid a\r\nlittle less than one-half. DO NOT ADD THE WATER TO THE ACID. Leave\r\nthe metal in this solution three or four hours. The time will\r\ndepend upon the strength of the acid and the depth to which you\r\nwish the etching to be done. An occasional examination of the\r\nobject will show when to take it out.\r\n\r\nWhen the etching has been carried as far as desirable, take the\r\ncopper from the bath and remove the asphaltum by scraping it as\r\nclean as possible, using an old case knife. After doing this, put\r\nsome of the solution, or pickle as it is called, in an old pan and\r\nwarm it over a flame. Put the metal in this hot liquid and swab it\r\nwith batting or cloth fastened to the end of a stick. Rinse in\r\nclear water to stop the action of the acid. When clean, cut the\r\nmetal out from the center where the picture is to be placed, using\r\na metal saw.\r\n\r\nSolder on the back several small clips with which to hold the\r\npicture in place. There must also be a support soldered in place\r\nto keep the frame upright. To further clean the metal before\r\nsoldering, use a solution in the proportion of one-half cup of lye\r\nto 3 gal. water. Heat either the solution or the metal just before\r\nusing.\r\n\r\nWhen soldering, care must be taken to have the parts to be\r\nsoldered thoroughly clean. Any grease or foreign matter will\r\nprevent the solder from running properly. On a piece of slate\r\nslab, heavy glass or other hard, nonabsorbent substance that is\r\nclean, put a little water and grind a lump of borax around until\r\nthe resultant is like thin cream. Thoroughly clean the parts that\r\nare to be soldered by scraping with a knife, and do not touch with\r\nthe fingers afterward. Place a piece of thin silver solder between\r\nthe parts after having coated them and the solder with the borax.\r\nUse a pair of tweezers to pick up the solder. Hold the parts\r\nfirmly together and apply heat--slowly at first until all moisture\r\nhas been expelled and the borax crystallized, after which the\r\nflame may be applied more directly and the parts brought to a\r\nsoldering heat. An alcohol flame will do. Heat applied too quickly\r\nwill throw off the solder and spoil the attempt.\r\n\r\nThere are various ways of finishing the metal. It may be polished\r\nby means of powdered pumice, chalk or charcoal, and then treated\r\nwith a coat of French varnish diluted ten times its volume in\r\nalcohol. Another popular way is to give the background a\r\nbluish-green effect by brushing it over a great many times, after\r\nit has been cleaned, with a solution composed of muriate of\r\nammonia, 1 part; carbonate of ammonia, 3 parts; water, 24 parts.\r\nThe whole may then be treated with French varnish to preserve the\r\ncolors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make an Easel [415]\r\n\r\nA strong and substantial easel may be made at home with very\r\nlittle expense and no great difficulty.\r\n\r\nSmooth down with a plane, four pieces of pine, 1 in. thick, 4 in.\r\nwide and 4 ft. long, until suitable for legs.

With an auger bore a hole in each leg about 3 in. from the\r\nbottom, and fit into each a little peg, Fig. 2, for the picture to\r\nrest on. The peg should be of hardwood so it will not break.\r\n\r\nCut the handle from an old broom, measure off the right length,\r\nand put a hinge on one end. Fasten this leg on the second\r\ncross-piece, thus forming a support for the two front legs, Fig.\r\n3. The easel may be finished according to the individual taste. It\r\nmay be sandpapered and stained and varnished, or painted in some\r\npretty tint, or, if preferred, may be enameled.\r\n--Contributed by G. J.

The platform is flatter, however, and the\r\nbody one tier so that it is lower. A framework of wood is built at\r\nM and this is a support\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wind Propeller]\r\n\r\nfor several purposes. The sail is secured to the mast which is\r\nfixed into the body of the cart as shown. The sail is linen\r\nfabric. There are two crosspieces to aid in keeping the sail\r\nproperly opened. The steering arrangement is through the rear\r\nshaft. The shaft is pivoted as in a hand-propelled cart, and the\r\nrod I extends from the middle connection of the shaft up to a\r\npoint where the person seated on the wooden frame can handle it.\r\nThere is a brake arranged by making a looped piece J and hinging\r\nit as shown.

Renew them all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Construct an Annunciator [416]\r\n\r\nOftentimes a single electric bell may be connected in a circuit so\r\nthat it can be operated from more than one push button. These push\r\nbuttons are usually located in entirely different parts of the\r\nbuilding and it is necessary to have some means of determining the\r\nparticular push button that was pressed and caused the bell to\r\noperate. The electric annunciator is a device that will indicate\r\nor record the various calls or signals that may be sent over the\r\ncircuits to which the annunciator is connected. A very simple and\r\ninexpensive annunciator may be made in the following way:\r\n\r\nBefore taking up the construction of the annunciator it would be\r\nbest to make a diagrammatic drawing of the circuit in which the\r\nannunciator is to operate. The simplest circuit that will require\r\nan annunciator is one where the bell may be operated from either\r\nof two push buttons. In this case the annunciator must be\r\nconstructed to give only two indications. Fig. 1 shows how the\r\nvarious\' elements of such a circuit may be connected. B is an\r\nordinary vibrating electric bell, M1 and M2 are the two\r\nelectromagnets of the annunciator, A is a battery of several dry\r\ncells, and P1 and P2 are the push buttons from either of which the\r\nbell may be operated.\r\n\r\nWhen the push button P1 is pressed the circuit is completed\r\nthrough the winding of the magnet M1 and its core becomes\r\nmagnetized. In a similar manner the core of the magnet M2 becomes\r\nmagnetized when the push button P2 is pressed and the circuit\r\ncompleted through the winding of the magnet M2.\r\n\r\nIf an iron armature, that is supported by a shaft through its\r\ncenter and properly balanced, be placed near the ends of the cores\r\nof M1 and M2, as shown in Fig. 2, it may assume the position\r\nindicated by either the full or dotted lines, depending upon which\r\nof the magnets, M1 or M2, was last magnetized. The position of\r\nthis armature will serve to indicate the push button from which\r\nthe bell was operated. The magnets should be placed inside a case\r\nand the indication may be made by a pointer attached to the shaft,\r\nsupporting the armature.\r\n\r\nIf you are able to secure the electromagnets from a discarded\r\nelectric bell they will work fine for the magnets M1 and M2. They\r\nshould be disconnected from their iron support and mounted upon\r\nsome non-magnetic material, such as brass or copper, making the\r\ndistance between their centers as small as possible. The piece of\r\nmetal upon which the magnets are mounted should now be fastened,\r\nby means of two wood screws, to the back of the board, shown in\r\nFig. 6, that is to form the face of the annunciator. It should be\r\nabout 1/8 in. thick, 1/2 in. wide and long enough to extend a\r\nshort distance beyond the cores of the magnets M1 and M2. Drill a\r\n1/16-in. hole through its center, as shown in Fig. 2. Drive a\r\npiece of steel rod into this hole, making sure the rod will not\r\nturn easily in the opening, and allow about 1/2 in. of the rod to\r\nproject on one side, and 1-1/2 in. on the other side.\r\n\r\nDrill a hole in the board upon which the magnets are mounted so\r\nthat when the long end of the rod carrying the armature is passed\r\nthrough the hole, the armature will be a little more than 1/16 in.\r\nfrom each magnet core. The short end of the rod should be\r\nsupported by means of a piece of strip brass bent into the form\r\nshown in Fig. 3.\r\n\r\nDrill a hole in the center of this piece, so the rod will pass\r\nthrough it. When the armature has been put in its proper place,\r\nfasten this strip to the board with two small wood screws. You may\r\nexperience some difficulty in locating the hole in the board for\r\nthe rod, and it no doubt would be best to drill this hole first\r\nand fasten the magnets in place afterwards.\r\n\r\nTwo small collars should be fastened to the rod to prevent its\r\nmoving endwise. Fit the collars tightly on the rod to hold them in\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nCut the long end of the rod off so it projects through the face of\r\nthe annunciator about 5/8 in. Take some very thin sheet brass and\r\ncut out a needle or indicator as shown in Fig. 4. In a small piece\r\nof brass drill a hole so it will fit tight on the other end of the\r\nrod. Solder the indicator to this piece and force it in place on\r\nthe end of the rod.\r\n\r\nWhen the armature is the same\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Details of the Annunciator]\r\n\r\ndistance from each core, the indicator should be parallel to the\r\nlong dimension of the face of the case. The case of the instrument\r\nmay be made in the following way:\r\n\r\nSecure a piece of 3/8-in. oak, or other hard wood, 3 in. wide and\r\n2 ft. long. Then cut from this board the following pieces: two\r\nwhose dimensions correspond to those of Fig. 5 and are to form the\r\nsides of the case; two whose dimensions correspond to those of\r\nFig. 6 and are to form the back and the face of the case; three\r\nwhose dimensions correspond to those of Figs. 7, 8, and 9 and are\r\nto form the lower and upper end of the case and the finish for the\r\ntop.\r\n\r\nSecure a piece of window glass, 4-1/2 in. by 3-1/8 in. that is to\r\nbe used as the front. Before assembling the case cut on the inner\r\nsurface of the pieces forming the sides and the lower end, a\r\ngroove just wide enough to take the glass and 1/16 in. in depth.\r\nThe outer edge of this groove should be 3/8 in. from the outer\r\nedge of the frame. After the case is fastened together there\r\nshould be a slot between the piece forming the upper end and the\r\npiece that serves as a finish at the top, that will allow the\r\nglass to be slipped into place. A small strip of wood should be\r\ntacked over this slot, after the glass is put in place, to prevent\r\nthe dust and dirt from falling down inside of the case.\r\n\r\nThe piece upon which the works are to be mounted may be fastened\r\nin place by means of four round-headed brass screws that pass\r\nthrough the sides of the case. It should be fastened about 1/2 in.\r\nback of the glass front. The back may be fastened inside of the\r\ncase in a similar manner.\r\n\r\nCut two pieces, from some sheet brass, whose dimensions correspond\r\nto those of Fig. 10. These pieces are to be used in supporting the\r\ncase by means of some small screws. Fasten three binding-posts,\r\nthat are to form the terminals of the annunciator, on the top of\r\nthe upper end of the case. Mark one of these binding-posts C and\r\nthe other two Ll and L2. Connect one terminal of each of the\r\nmagnet windings to the post marked C and the other terminal to the\r\nposts Ll and L2. You can finish the case in any style you may\r\ndesire. Often times it is desirable to have it correspond to the\r\nfinish of the woodwork of the room in which it is to be placed.\r\nThe distance the point of the indicator will move through depends\r\nupon the distance between the cores of the magnets and the\r\ndistance of the armature from these cores. These distances are\r\noften times such that the indications of the cell are not very\r\ndefinite. If the armature is moved too far from the cores there is\r\nnot sufficient pull exerted by them when magnetized, to cause the\r\nposition of the armature\' to change.\r\n\r\nMount on the shaft carrying the armature a small gear wheel.\r\nArrange another smaller gear to engage this on and fasten the\r\nindicator to the shaft of the smaller gear. Any movement now of\r\nthe armature shaft will result in a relative large movement of the\r\nindicator shaft. Figure 11 shows the arrangement of the gears just\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Steam Calliope [418]\r\n\r\nSecure ten gas jet valves, the part of the gas fixture shown in\r\nFig. 1, and prepare to place them in a piece of 1-in. pipe, 12 in.\r\nlong. This is done by drilling and tapping 10 holes, each\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Details of the Calliope]\r\n\r\n1 in. apart, in a straight line along the pipe. The valves screwed\r\ninto these holes appear as shown in Fig. 2. The whistles are made\r\nfrom pipe of a diameter that will fit the valves. No dimensions\r\ncan be given for the exact lengths of these pipes as they must be\r\ntried out to get the tone. Cut ten pieces of this pipe, each one\r\nof a different length, similar to the pipes on a pipe organ. Cut a\r\nthread on both ends, put a cap on the end intended for the top,\r\nand fit a plug in the other end. The plug must have a small\r\nportion of its side filed out, and a notch cut in the side of the\r\npipe with its horizontal edge level with the top of the plug. This\r\npart of each whistle is made similar to making a bark whistle on a\r\ngreen stick of willow. The pipes are then screwed into the valves.\r\n\r\nThe whistles may be toned by trying out and cutting off pieces of\r\nthe pipe, or by filling the top end with a little melted lead. The\r\n1-in. pipe must have a cap screwed on one end and the other\r\nattached to a steam pipe. The steam may be supplied by using an\r\nold range boiler, placed horizontally in a fireplace made of brick\r\nor sheet iron. If such a boiler is used, a small safety valve\r\nshould be attached. The keys and valve operation are shown in Fig.\r\n3. This is so plainly illustrated that it needs no explanation.\r\n--Contributed by Herbert Hahn, Chicago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Sharpening Scissors [419]\r\n\r\nWhen sharpening scissors on a grindstone it is very difficult to\r\nprocure a straight edge.

Call for pure sodium\r\nchloride.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Glass Blowing and Forming [420]\r\n\r\nFortunate indeed is the boy who receives a stock of glass tubing,\r\na Bunsen burner, a blowpipe, and some charcoal for a gift, for he\r\nhas a great deal of fun in store for himself. Glass blowing is a\r\nuseful art to understand, if the study of either chemistry or\r\nphysics is to be taken up, because much apparatus can be made at\r\nhome. And for itself alone, the forming of glass into various\r\nshapes has not only a good deal of pleasure in it, but it trains\r\nthe hands and the eye.\r\n\r\nGlass, ordinarily brittle and hard, becomes soft and pliable under\r\nheat. When subjected to the action of a flame until dull red, it\r\nbends as if made of putty; heated to a bright yellow, it is so\r\nsoft that it may be blown, pulled, pushed or worked into any shape\r\ndesired. Hence the necessity for a Bunsen burner, a device\r\npreferred to all others for this work, because it gives the\r\nhottest flame without soot or dirt. The Bunsen burner, as shown in\r\nFig. 1, is attached to any gas bracket with a rubber tube, but the\r\nflame is blue, instead of yellow, as the burner introduces air at\r\nits base, which mixes with the gas and so produces an almost\r\nperfect combustion, instead of the partial combustion which\r\nresults in the ordinary yellow flame. All gas stoves have Bunsen\r\nburners, and many oil stoves.\r\n\r\nIf gas is not available, an alcohol lamp with a large wick will do\r\nalmost as well. The blowpipe, shown in Fig. 2, is merely a tube of\r\nbrass with the smaller end at right angles to the pipe, and a fine\r\ntip to reduce the size of the blast, which is used to direct a\r\nsmall flame. Besides these tools, the glass worker will need some\r\nround sticks of charcoal, sharpened like a pencil, as shown in\r\nFig. 3, a file, and several lengths of German glass tubing.\r\n\r\nTo bend a length of the tubing, let it be assumed for the purpose\r\nof making a syphon, it is only necessary to cork one end of the\r\ntube and heat it near the top of the Bunsen flame, turning the\r\ntubing constantly to make it heat evenly on all sides, until it is\r\na dull red in color. It will then bend of its own weight if held\r\nin one hand, but to allow it to do so is to make a flat place in\r\nthe bend. The heating should be continued until the red color is\r\nquite bright, when the open end of the tube is put in the mouth\r\nand a little pressure of air made in the tube by blowing. At the\r\nsame time, the tube is bent, steadily but gently. The compressed\r\nair in the tube prevents it from collapsing during the process.\r\n\r\nTo make a bulb on the end of a tube, one end must be closed. This\r\nis easily done by heating as before, and then pulling the tube\r\napart as shown in Fig. 4. The hot glass will draw, just like a\r\npiece of taffy, each end tapering to a point. This point on one\r\nlength is successively heated and pressed toward and into the\r\ntube, by means of a piece of charcoal, until the end is not only\r\nclosed, but as thick as the rest of the tube, as in Fig. 5. An\r\ninch or more is now heated white hot, the tube being turned\r\ncontinually to assure even heating and to prevent the hot end from\r\nbending down by its own weight. When very hot, a sudden puff into\r\nthe open end of the tube will expand the hot glass into a bulb, as\r\nin Fig. 6. These can be made of considerable size, and, if not too\r\nthin, make very good flasks (Fig. 7) for physical experiments. The\r\nbase of the bulb should be flattened by setting it, still hot, on\r\na flat piece of charcoal, so that it will stand alone.\r\n\r\nTo weld two lengths of, glass tubing together, heat the end of a\r\ntube and insert the point of a piece of charcoal in the opening,\r\nand twirl it about until the end of the tube has a considerable\r\nflare. Do the same to the end of the other tube, which is to be\r\njoined to the first, and then, heating both to a dull red, let\r\nthem touch and press lightly together as in Fig. 8. As soon as\r\nthey are well in contact, heat the two joined flares together,\r\nvery hot, and, pulling slightly, the flares will flatten out and\r\nthe tube be perfectly joined. Tubes joined without previous\r\nflaring have a constricted diameter at the joint.\r\n\r\nTo make a T-joint in two pieces of tubing, it is necessary to make\r\na hole in the side of one piece, as shown at A in Fig. 9. This is\r\naccomplished by the aid of the principle of physics that gases\r\nexpand when heated. Both ends of the tube, which should be cold,\r\nare corked tightly. The whole is then gradually warmed by being\r\nheld near the flame. When warm, a small flame is directed by the\r\nblowpipe from the Bunsen flame to a spot on one side of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Glass Blowing and Forming]\r\n\r\nthe closed tube. As it heats, the air within the tube expands and\r\nbecomes compressed, and as soon as the hot spot on the side of the\r\ntube is soft enough, the confined air blows out, pushing the hot\r\nglass aside as it does so, leaving a small puncture. This is to be\r\nenlarged with pointed charcoal until it also flares as shown at B.\r\nThis flare is then connected to the flared end of a straight tube,\r\nC, and the T-joint, D, is complete.\r\n\r\nUsing the blowpipe is not difficult. The lips and cheeks should be\r\npuffed out with a mouthful of air, which is ample to blow a flame\r\nwhile the lungs are being refilled. In this way, it is possible to\r\nuse the blowpipe steadily, and not intermittently, as is necessary\r\nif the lungs alone are the "bellows."\r\n\r\nSmall glass funnels, such as are used in many chemical operations,\r\nare made by first forming a bulb, then puncturing the bulb at the\r\ntop, when hot, with a piece of charcoal, and smoothing down or\r\nflaring the edges. Very small and fine glass tubes, such as are\r\nused in experiments to demonstrate capillary attraction, water or\r\nother liquid rising in them when they are plunged into it, are\r\nmade by heating as long a section of tubing as can be handled in\r\nthe flame--2 in. will be found enough--and, when very hot, giving\r\nthe ends a sudden vigorous pull apart. The tube pulls out and gets\r\nsmaller and smaller as it does so, until at last it breaks. But\r\nthe fine thread of glass so made is really a tube, and not a rod,\r\nas might be supposed. This can be demonstrated by blowing through\r\nit at a gas flame, or by immersing it in colored liquid. The\r\nsolution will be seen to rise some distance within the tube, the\r\namount depending on the diameter of the tube.\r\n\r\nThe file is for cutting the glass tubing into lengths convenient\r\nto handle. It should be a three-cornered file, of medium fineness,\r\nand is used simply to nick the glass at the place it is desired to\r\ncut it. The two thumbs are then placed beneath the tube, one on\r\neach side of the nick, and the tube bent, as if it were plastic,\r\nat the same time pulling the hands apart. The tube will break off\r\nsquarely at the nick, without difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe entire outfit may be purchased from any dealer in chemical or\r\nphysical apparatus, or any druggist will order it. Enough tubing\r\nto last many days, the Bunsen burner, blowpipe, file and charcoal\r\nshould not exceed $2 in cost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Cadmium and Solder [421]\r\n\r\nThe addition of cadmium to soft solder composed of tin and lead,\r\nlowers its melting point and increases its strength.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Telegraph Codes [422]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Telegraph Codes]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Cruising Catamaran [423]\r\n\r\nA launch is much safer than a sailing boat, yet there is not the\r\nreal sport to be derived from it as in sailing. Herein is given a\r\ndescription of a sailing catamaran especially adapted for those\r\nwho desire to sail and have a safe craft. The main part of the\r\ncraft is made from two boats or pontoons with watertight tops,\r\nbottoms and sides and fixed at a certain distance apart with a\r\nplatform on top for the passengers. Such a craft cannot be\r\ncapsized easily, and, as the pontoons are watertight, it will\r\nweather almost any rough water. If the craft is intended for rough\r\nwaters, care must be taken to make the platform pliable yet stiff\r\nand as narrow as convenient to take care of the rocking movements.\r\n\r\nThis catamaran has been designed to simplify the construction,\r\nand, if a larger size than the dimensions shown in Fig. 1 is\r\ndesired, the pontoons may be made longer by using two boards end\r\nto end and putting battens on the inside over the joint. Each\r\npontoon is made of two boards 1 in. thick, 14 in. wide and 16 ft.\r\nlong, dressed and cut to the shape shown in Fig. 2. Spreaders are\r\ncut from 2-in. planks, 10 in. wide and 12 in. long, and placed 6\r\nft. apart between the board sides and fastened with screws. White\r\nlead should be put in the joints before turning in the screws. Cut\r\nthe ends of the boards so they will fit perfectly and make pointed\r\nends to the pontoons as shown\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Details of the Pontoons]\r\n\r\nin Fig. 3, and fit in a wedge shaped piece; white lead the joints\r\nand fasten well with screws.\r\n\r\nTurn this shell upside down and lay a board 1/2 in. thick, 12 in.\r\nwide and 16 ft. long on the edges of the sides, mark\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Completed Boat]\r\n\r\non the under side the outside line of the shell and cut to shape\r\nroughly. See that the spreaders and sides fit true all over, then\r\nput white lead on the joint and nail with 1-3/4 -in. finishing\r\nnails as close as possible without weakening the wood. Slightly\r\nstagger the nails in the sides, the 1-in. side boards will allow\r\nfor this, trim off the sides, turn the box over and paint the\r\njoints and ends of the spreaders, giving them two or three coats\r\nand let them dry.\r\n\r\nTry each compartment for leaks by turning water in them one at a\r\ntime. Bore a 5/8-in. hole through each spreader in the center and\r\nthrough the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Crosspiece and Rudder Details]\r\n\r\nbottom board as shown. The top board, which is 1/4-in. thick, 12\r\nin. wide and 16 ft. long, is put on the same as the bottom.\r\n\r\nAfter finishing both pontoons in this way place them parallel. A\r\nblock of wood is fastened on top of each pontoon and exactly over\r\neach spreader on which to bolt the crosspieces as shown in Fig. 4.\r\nEach block is cut to the shape and with the dimensions shown in\r\nFig. 5.\r\n\r\nThe crosspieces are made from hickory or ash and each piece is\r\n2-1/2 in. thick, 5 in. wide and 6-1/2 ft. long. Bore a 5/8-in.\r\nhole 3 in. from each end through the 5-in. way of the wood. Take\r\nmaple flooring 3/4 in. thick, 6 in. wide, 74-1/2 in. long and\r\nfasten with large screws and washers to the crosspieces and put\r\nbattens across every 18 in. Turn the flooring and crosspieces\r\nupside down and fasten to the pontoons with long 5/8-in. bolts put\r\nthrough the spreaders. Put a washer on the head of each bolt and\r\nrun them through from the under side. Place a thick rubber washer\r\nunder and on top of each crosspiece at the ends as shown in Fig.\r\n4. This will make a rigid yet flexible joint for rough waters. The\r\nflooring being placed on the under side of the crosspieces makes\r\nit possible to get the sail boom very low. The sides put on and\r\nwell fastened will greatly assist in stiffening the platform and\r\nhelp it to stand the racking strains. These sides will also keep\r\nthe water and spray out and much more so if a 12-in. dash is put\r\non in front on top of the crosspiece.\r\n\r\nThe rudders are made as shown in Fig. 6, by using an iron rod 5/8\r\nin. in diameter and 2 ft. long for the bearing of each. This rod\r\nis split with a hacksaw for 7 in. of its length and a sheet metal\r\nplate 3/32 in. thick, 6 in. wide, and 12 in. long inserted and\r\nriveted in the split. This will allow 3/4 in. of the iron rod to\r\nproject from the bottom edge of the metal through which a hole is\r\ndrilled for a cotter pin. The bottom bracket is made from stake\r\niron bent in the shape of a U as shown, the rudder bearing passing\r\nthrough a hole drilled in the upper leg and resting on the lower.\r\nSlip the top bracket on and then bend the top end of the bearing\r\nrod at an angle as shown in both Figs. 6 and 7. Connect the two\r\nbent ends with a crosspiece which has a hole drilled in its center\r\nto fasten a rope as shown in Fig. 1.\r\n\r\nAttach the mast to the front crosspiece, also bowsprit, bracing\r\nthem both to the pontoons. A set of sails having about 300 sq. ft.\r\nof area will be about right for racing. Two sails, main and fore,\r\nof about 175 to 200 sq. ft. will be sufficient for cruising.\r\n--Contributed by J. Appleton, Des Moines, Iowa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Alligator Photo Mounts [424]\r\n\r\nRough alligator finished photograph mounts will not receive a good\r\nimpression from a die. If a carbon paper is placed on the mounts\r\nbefore making the impression, a good clear imprint will be the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Attach a Sail to a Bicycle [425]\r\n\r\nThis attachment was constructed for use on a bicycle to be ridden\r\non the well packed sands of a beach, but it could be used on a\r\nsmooth, level road as well. The illustration shows the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bicycle Sailing on a Beach]\r\n\r\nmain frame to consist of two boards, each about 16 ft. long, bent\r\nin the shape of a boat, to give plenty of room for turning the\r\nfront wheel. On this main frame is built up a triangular mast, to\r\ncarry the mainsail and jib, having a combined area of about 40 sq.\r\nft. The frame is fastened to the bicycle by numerous pieces of\r\nrope.\r\n\r\nSailing on a bicycle is very much different from sailing in a\r\nboat, for the bicycle leans up against the wind, instead of\r\nheeling over with it as the boat. It takes some time to learn the\r\nsupporting power of the wind, and the angle at which one must ride\r\nmakes it appear that a fall is almost sure to result. A turn must\r\nbe made by turning out of the wind, instead of, as in ordinary\r\nsailing, into it; the boom supporting the bottom of the mainsail\r\nis then swung over to the opposite tack, when one is traveling at\r\na good speed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Removing Iodine Stains [425]\r\n\r\nA good way to chemically remove iodine stains from the hands or\r\nlinen is to wash the stains in a strong solution of hypo sulphite\r\nof sodium, known as "hypo," which is procurable at any\r\nphotographic-supply dealer\'s or drug store.\r\n\r\nThere is no danger of using too strong a solution, but the best\r\nresults are obtained with a mixture of 1 oz. of hypo to 2 oz. of\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Drying Photograph Prints without Curling [425]\r\n\r\nHaving made some photograph prints at one time that I wanted to\r\ndry without the edges curling, I took an ordinary tin can and a\r\nstrip of clean cotton cloth, as wide as the can was long, and\r\nwound it one turn around the can and then placed the prints, one\r\nafter the other, while they were damp, on the cloth, face\r\ndownward, and proceeded to roll the cloth and prints quite close\r\non the can. I then pinned the end of the cloth to keep it from\r\nunwinding and set the whole in a draft for drying.\r\n\r\nThe curvature of the can just about\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rolling Up the Prints]\r\n\r\ncounteracted the tendency of the coating on the paper to make the\r\nprints curl and when they were thoroughly dried and removed they\r\nremained nice and flat.\r\n--Contributed by W. H. Eppens, Chicago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Piercing Glass Plates with a Spark Coil [426]\r\n\r\nAnyone possessing a 1-in. induction coil and a 1-qt. Leyden jar\r\ncan easily perform the interesting experiment of piercing glass\r\nplates. Connect the Leyden jar to the induction coil as shown in\r\nthe diagram. A discharger is now constructed of very dry wood and\r\nboiled in paraffine for about 15 minutes. The main part of the\r\ndischarger, A B, is a piece of wood about 6 in. long and to the\r\nmiddle of it is fastened a wood handle by means of one or two wood\r\nscrews. A binding-post is fastened to each end of the main piece\r\nor at A and B as shown in the diagram.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Puncturing Glass Plates]\r\n\r\nTwo stiff brass wires of No. 14 gauge and 6 in. long, with a small\r\nbrass ball attached to one end of each, are bent in an arc of a\r\ncircle and attached one to each binding-post. A plate of glass, G,\r\nis now placed between the two brass balls and the coil set in\r\naction. The plate will soon be pierced by the spark. Larger coils\r\nwill pierce heavier glass plates.\r\n--Contributed by I. Wolff, Brooklyn, N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Home-Made Still [426]\r\n\r\nRemove the metal end of an old electric light globe. This can be\r\ndone by soaking a piece of twine in alcohol and tying it around\r\nthe globe at the place the break is to be made. Light the string\r\nand after it is burned off, turn cold water on the globe. The\r\nresult will be a smooth break where the string\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Complete Still]\r\n\r\nwas placed. Purchase a piece of glass tubing from your druggist\r\nand secure a cork that will fit the opening in the glass bulb.\r\nBore a hole in the cork the right size for the glass tube to fit\r\nin tightly. If you cannot get a glass tube with a bend in it, you\r\nwill have to make a bend, as shown in the illustration, by heating\r\nthe tube at the right place over an alcohol lamp and allowing the\r\nweight of the glass to make the bend while it is hot.\r\n\r\nInsert the short end of the tube in the cork and place the other\r\nend in a test tube that is placed in water as shown. The globe may\r\nbe fastened in position by a wire passed through the cork and tied\r\nto a ring stand. If you do not have a ring stand, suspend the\r\nglobe by a wire from a hook that is screwed into any convenient\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nA neat alcohol lamp may be made of an old ink or muscilage bottle.\r\nInsert a wick in a piece of the glass tubing and put this through\r\na hole bored in a cork and the lamp is ready to burn alcohol or\r\nkerosene. Alcohol is cleaner to use as a fuel. Fill the globe\r\nabout two-thirds full of water or other liquid and apply the heat\r\nbelow as shown. The distilled liquid will collect in the test\r\ntube.\r\n--Contributed by Clarence D.

Stick a pin in the center of this cork so that the end\r\nwill be about 1-1/2 in. above the tap. Procure another cork about\r\n1 in. in diameter by 1-3/4 in. long. The forks are now stuck into\r\nthe latter cork at equal distances apart, each having the same\r\nangle from the cork. A long needle with a good sharp point is run\r\nthrough the cork with the forks and 1/2 in. of the needle end\r\nallowed to project through the lower end.\r\n\r\nThe point of the needle now may be placed on the pin head. The\r\nforks will balance and if given a slight push they will appear to\r\ndance. Different angles of the forks will produce various feats of\r\nbalancing.\r\n--Contributed by O. E.

A string is put through\r\nthe slit, the long cuts and back through the slit and then a\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Removing the String]\r\n\r\nbutton is fastened to each end. The small slit should not be so\r\nlarge as the buttons. The trick is to remove the string. The\r\nsolution is quite simple. Fold the paper in the middle and the\r\npart between the long cuts will form a loop. Bend this loop down\r\nand pass it through the small slit. Turn the paper around and it\r\nwill appear as shown in Fig. 2. One of the buttons may now be\r\ndrawn through and the paper restored to its original shape.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Experiment with an Incandescent Lamp [427]\r\n\r\nWhen rubbing briskly an ordinary incandescent lamp on a piece of\r\ncloth and at the same time slightly revolving it, a luminous\r\neffect is produced similar to an X-ray tube. The room must be dark\r\nand the lamp perfectly dry to obtain good results. It appears that\r\nthe inner surface of the globe becomes charged, probably by\r\ninduction, and will sometimes hold the filament as shown in the\r\nsketch.\r\n--Contributed by E. W.

The armature is\r\nconstructed, as shown in Figs. 1 and 2, by using a common spool\r\nwith 8 flat-headed screws placed at equal distances apart and in\r\nthe middle of the spool. Each screw is wound with No. 24 gauge\r\niron wire, as shown at A, Fig. 1. The commutator is made from a\r\nthin piece of copper, 1 in. in diameter and cut as shown in Fig.\r\n3, leaving 8 points, 1/8 in. wide and 1/8 in.- deep. The field is\r\nbuilt up by using 8 strips of tin, 12 in. long and 2 in. wide,\r\nriveted together and shaped as shown at B, Fig. 4. Field magnets\r\nare constructed by using two 3/8-in. bolts, 1-1/2 in. long. A\r\ncircular piece of cardboard is placed on each end of the bolt,\r\nleaving space enough for the bolt to pass through the field B, and\r\nto receive a nut. Wind the remaining space between the cardboards\r\nwith 30 ft. of No. 22 double-wound cotton-covered copper wire. A\r\nlight frame of wood is built around the magnets, as shown at C,\r\nFig. 4. Holes are made in this frame to receive the axle of the\r\narmature. Two strips of copper, 1/4 in. wide and 3 in. long, are\r\nused for the brushes. The armature is placed in position in its\r\nbearings and the brushes adjusted as shown in Fig. 4, one brush\r\ntouching the shaft of the armature outside of the frame, and the\r\nother just touching the points of the commutator, which is placed\r\non the shaft inside of the frame. Connect the outside wire of one\r\nmagnet to the inside wire of the other, and the remaining ends,\r\none to the batteries and back to the brush that touches the shaft,\r\nwhile the other is attached to the brush touching the commutator.\r\nIn making the frame for the armature bearings, care should be\r\ntaken to get the holes for the shaft centered, and to see that the\r\nscrews in the armature pass each bolt in the magnets at equal\r\ndistances, which should be about 1/8 in.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Aluminum Polish [428]\r\n\r\nAn emulsion of equal parts of rum and olive oil can be used for\r\ncleaning aluminum, says Blacksmith and Wheelwright.

A wing is made in\r\nthe shape shown in Fig. 1 by cutting it from the large piece of an\r\nold tin can, after melting the solder and removing the ends. This\r\nwing is then given a twist so that one end will be just opposite\r\nthe other and appear as shown in Fig. 2. Secure a common spool and\r\ndrive two nails in one end, leaving at least 1/2 in. of each nail\r\nprojecting after the head has been removed. Two holes are made in\r\nthe wing, exactly central, to fit on these two nails. Another nail\r\nis driven part way into the end of a stick, Fig. 4, and the\r\nremaining part is cut off so the length will be that of the spool.\r\nA string is used around the spool in the same manner as on a top.\r\nThe wing is placed on the two nails in the spool, and the spool\r\nplaced on the nail in the stick, Fig. 5, and the flier is ready\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Homemade Flying Machine]\r\n\r\nfor action. A quick pull on the string will cause the wing to\r\nleave the nails and soar upward for a hundred feet or more. After\r\na little experience in twisting the wing the operator will learn\r\nthe proper shape to get the best results.\r\n\r\nBe very careful in making the tests before the wings are turned to\r\nthe proper shape, as the direction of the flier cannot be\r\ncontrolled and some one might be injured by its flight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make an Ironing-Board Stand [429]\r\n\r\nSecure some 1 by 3-in. boards, about 3 ft. long, and plane them\r\nsmooth.

The negative is made in the\r\nusual way and,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Reproduced from a Relief Photograph]\r\n\r\nwhen ready for printing, a positive or transparency is made from\r\nit in the same manner as a lantern slide or window transparency,\r\nsays the Sketch, London.

To make the print in relief place the\r\npositive in the frame first with the film side out and the\r\nnegative on top of this with the film side up in the usual manner.\r\nPut in the paper and print. This will require a greater length of\r\ntime than with the ordinary negative on account of printing\r\nthrough double glass and films.

The distance covered is said to have been about 30\r\nmiles. Another scientist was able to telephone through the earth\r\nwithout the aid of wires. Nothing, however, has been made public\r\nas to how this was accomplished.\r\n\r\nIt is my object to unveil the mystery and to render this field\r\naccessible to others, at least to a certain degree, for I have by\r\nno means completed my researches in this particular work.\r\n\r\nIn order to establish a wireless communication between two points\r\nwe need first of all a hole or well in the ground at each point.\r\nIn my experiments I was unable to get a deep well, but the\r\ninstruments worked fine for a distance of 200 ft., using wells\r\nabout 25 ft. deep. As in ordinary telephone lines, we require a\r\ntransmitter and receiver at each point. These must be of the\r\nlong-distance type. If a hole is dug or a well is found suitable\r\nfor the purpose, a copper wire is hung in the opening, allowing\r\nthe end to touch the bottom. To make the proper contact an oval or\r\nround--but not pointed--copper plate is attached to the end of the\r\nwire. If a well is used, it is necessary to have a waterproof\r\ncable for the part running through the water. The top end is\r\nattached to the telephone transmitter and receiver, as in the\r\nordinary telephone, to the batteries and to a zinc plate, which is\r\nto be buried in the earth a few feet away from the well or hole,\r\nand not more than 1 ft. under the surface. A battery of four dry\r\ncells is used at each station.\r\n\r\nBoth stations are connected in the same way, as shown in the\r\nsketch. This makes it possible for neighbors to use their wells as\r\na means of communication with each other.\r\n--Contributed by A. E.

A very\r\ngood microscope may be made out of the bulb of a broken\r\nthermometer. Empty out the mercury, which is easily done by\r\nholding the bulb with the stem down over a lamp or candle. A\r\nspirit lamp is the best, as it makes no smoke and gives a steady\r\nheat. Warm the bulb slowly and the mercury will be expelled and\r\nmay be caught in a tea cup. Do not heat too fast, or the pressure\r\nof the mercury vapor may burst the glass bulb, cautions the\r\nWoodworkers\' Review. To fill the bulb with water warm it and\r\nimmerse the end of the tube in the water. Then allow it to cool\r\nand the pressure of the air will force the water into the bulb.\r\nThen boil the water gently, holding the bulb with the stem up;\r\nthis will drive out all the air, and by turning the stem or tube\r\ndown and placing the end in water the bulb will be completely\r\nfilled. It is surprising how much can be seen by means of such a\r\nsimple apparatus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Making a Microscope]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Novel Electric Time Alarm [433]\r\n\r\nAll time alarms run by clockwork must be wound and set each time.\r\nThe accompanying diagram shows how to make the connection that\r\nwill ring a bell by electric current at the time set without\r\nwinding the alarm. The bell is removed from an ordinary alarm\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Electric Time Alarm]\r\n\r\nclock and a small metal strip attached, as shown at B. An\r\ninsulated connection is fastened on the clapper of the bell, as\r\nshown at A. The arm holding the clapper must be bent to have the\r\npoint A remain as close to the strip B as possible without\r\ntouching it. The connection to the battery is made as shown. When\r\nthe time set for the alarm comes the clapper will be moved far\r\nenough to make the contact. In the course of a minute the catch on\r\nthe clapper arm will be released and the clapper will return to\r\nits former place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Phonograph Record Cabinet [433]\r\n\r\nThe core, Fig. 1, consists of six strips of wood beveled so as to\r\nform six equal sides. The strips are 3 ft.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Phonograph Wax Record Case]\r\n\r\nlong and 3 in. wide on the outside bevel and are nailed to three\r\nblocks made hexagon, as shown in Fig. 2, from 7/8-in. material.\r\nOne block is placed at each end and one in the middle. A 1/2-in.\r\nmetal pin is driven in a hole bored in the center of each end\r\nblock. The bottoms of the pasteboard cases, used to hold the wax\r\nrecords, are either tacked or glued to this hexagon core, as shown\r\nin Fig. 3, with their open ends outward.\r\n\r\nTwo circular pieces are made of such a diameter as will cover the\r\nwidth of the core and the cases attached, and extend about 1/2 in.\r\neach side. A 1/2-in. hole is bored in the center of these pieces\r\nto receive the pins placed in the ends of the core, Fig. 1. These\r\nwill form the ends of the cabinet, and when placed, one on each\r\nend of the core, heavy building paper or sheet metal is tacked\r\naround them for a covering, as shown in Fig. 4. A small glass door\r\nis made, a little wider than one row of cases, and fitted in one\r\nside of the covering. The outside may be painted or decorated in\r\nany way to suit the builder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Experiments with a Mirror [434]\r\n\r\nAsk your friend if he can decipher the sign as illustrated in the\r\nsketch, Fig. 1, which you pretend to have read over the shop of an\r\nArmenian shoemaker.\r\n\r\nHe will probably tell you that he is not conversant with Oriental\r\nlanguages. He will not believe it if you tell him it is written in\r\ngood English, but place a frameless mirror perpendicularly on the\r\nmysterious script, right across the quotation marks, and it will\r\nappear as shown in Fig. 2. We understand at once that the\r\nreflected image is the faithful copy of the written half.\r\n\r\nWith the aid of a few books arrange the mirror and the paper as\r\nshown in Fig. 3 and ask your friend to write anything he chooses,\r\nwith the condition that he shall see his hand and read the script\r\nin the mirror only. The writer will probably go no farther than\r\nthe first letter. His hand seems to be struck with paralysis and\r\nunable to write anything but zigzags, says Scientific American.\r\n\r\nAnother experiment may be made by taking an egg shell and trimming\r\nit with the scissors so as to reduce it to a half shell. In the\r\nhollow bottom roughly draw with your pencil a cross with pointed\r\nends. Bore a hole, about the size or a pea, in the center of the\r\ncross. Place yourself so as to face a window, the light falling\r\nupon your face, not upon the mirror which you hold in one hand.\r\nClose one eye. Place the shell between the other eye and the\r\nmirror, at a distance of 2 or 3 in. from either, the concavity\r\nfacing the mirror as shown in Fig. 4. Through the hole in the\r\nshell look at the mirror as if it were some distant object. While\r\nyou are so doing the concave shell will suddenly assume a strongly\r\nconvex appearance. To destroy the illusion it becomes necessary\r\neither to open both eyes or to withdraw the shell away from the\r\nmirror. The nearer the shell to the mirror and the farther the eye\r\nfrom the shell the more readily comes the illusion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Experimenting with a Mirror]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Miniature Electric Lamps [434]\r\n\r\nAfter several years\' research there has been produced a miniature\r\nelectric bulb that is a great improvement and a decided departure\r\nfrom the old kind which used a carbon filament. A metallic\r\nfilament prepared by a secret chemical process and suspended in\r\nthe bulb in an S-shape is used instead of the old straight span.\r\nThe voltage is gauged by the length of the span. The brilliancy of\r\nthe filament excels anything of its length in any voltage.\r\n\r\nOf course, the filament is not made of the precious metal, radium;\r\nthat simply being the trade name. However, the filament is\r\ncomposed of certain metals from which radium is extracted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Types of "Radium" Lamps]\r\n\r\nThe advantages of the new bulb are manifold. It gives five times\r\nthe light on the same voltage and uses one-half of the current\r\nconsumed by the old carbon filament. One of the disadvantages of\r\nthe old style bulb was the glass tip which made a shadow. This has\r\nbeen obviated in the radium bulb by blowing the tip on the side,\r\nas shown in the sketch, so as to produce no shadow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Magazine Clamp [435]\r\n\r\nThis device as shown in the illustration can be used to hold\r\nnewspapers and magazines while reading. Two pieces of wood are cut\r\nas shown, one with a slot to fit over the back of a magazine and\r\nthe other notched to serve as a clamp. The piece, A, may be\r\nslotted wide enough to insert two or three magazines and made long\r\nenough to hold several newspapers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Clamp]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Pewter Finish for Brass [435]\r\n\r\nA color resembling pewter may be given to brass by boiling the\r\ncastings in a cream of tartar solution containing a small amount\r\nof chloride of tin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Drowning a Dog\'s Bark with Water [435]\r\n\r\nThe owner of two dogs was very much annoyed by the dogs barking at\r\nnight. It began to be such a nuisance that the throwing of old\r\nshoes and empty bottles did not stop the noise. The only thing\r\nthat seemed to put a stop to it was water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Water Treatment for Dog\'s Bark]\r\n\r\nBeing on the third floor of the house, and a little too far from\r\nthe kennel to throw the water effectively, a mechanism was\r\narranged as shown in the sketch.\r\n\r\nA faucet for the garden hose was directly below the window. An\r\n8-in. wooden grooved pulley was slipped over an axle which had one\r\nend fitted on the handle of the faucet. A rope was extended to the\r\nwindow on the third floor and passed around the pulley several\r\ntimes, thence over an iron pulley fastened to the wall of the\r\nhouse and a weight was attached to its end. By pulling the rope up\r\nat the window the large pulley would turn on the water and when\r\nreleased the weight would shut off the flow. The nozzle was\r\nfastened so as to direct the stream where it would do the most\r\ngood.\r\n--Contributed by A. S.

TUCK\r\n\r\nAn exceedingly interesting machine is the so-called wondergraph.\r\nIt is easy and cheap to make and will furnish both entertainment\r\nand instruction for young and old. It is a drawing machine, and\r\nthe variety of designs it will produce, all symmetrical and\r\nornamental and some wonderfully complicated, is almost without\r\nlimit. Fig. 1 represents diagrammatically the machine shown in the\r\nsketch. This is the easiest to make and gives fully as great a\r\nvariety of results as any other.\r\n\r\nTo a piece of wide board or a discarded box bottom, three grooved\r\ncircular disks are fastened with screws so as to revolve freely\r\nabout the centers. They may be sawed from pieces of thin board or,\r\nbetter still, three of the plaques so generally used in burnt-.\r\nwood work may be bought for about 15 cents. Use the largest one\r\nfor the revolving table T. G is the guide wheel and D the driver\r\nwith attached handle. Secure a piece of a 36-in. ruler, which can\r\nbe obtained from any furniture dealer, and nail a small block,\r\nabout 1 in. thick, to one end and drill a hole through both the\r\nruler and the block, and pivot them by means of a wooden peg to\r\nthe face of the guide wheel. A fountain pen, or pencil, is placed\r\nat P and held securely by rubber bands in\r\n\r\n[Illustration: An Easily Made Wondergraph]\r\n\r\na grooved block attached to the ruler. A strip of wood, MN, is\r\nfastened to one end of the board. This strip is made just high\r\nenough to keep the ruler parallel with the face of the table, and\r\na row of small nails are driven part way into its upper edge.\r\nAnyone of these nails may be used to hold the other end of the\r\nruler in position, as shown in the sketch. If the wheels are not\r\ntrue, a belt tightener, B, may be attached and held against the\r\nbelt by a spring or rubber band.\r\n\r\nAfter the apparatus is adjusted so it will run smoothly, fasten a\r\npiece of drawing paper to the table with a couple of thumb tacks,\r\nadjust the pen so that it rests lightly on the paper and turn the\r\ndrive wheel. The results will be surprising and delightful. The\r\naccompanying designs were made with a very crude combination of\r\npulleys and belts, such as described.\r\n\r\nThe machine should have a speed that will cause the pen to move\r\nover the paper at the same rate as in ordinary writing. The ink\r\nshould flow freely from the pen as it passes over the paper. A\r\nvery fine pen may be necessary to prevent the lines from running\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nThe dimensions of the wondergraph may vary. The larger designs in\r\nthe illustration were made on a table, 8 in. in diameter, which\r\nwas driven by a guide wheel, 6 in. in diameter. The size of the\r\ndriver has no effect on the form or dimensions of the design, but\r\na change in almost any other part of the machine has a marked\r\neffect on the results obtained. If the penholder is made so that\r\nit may be fastened at various positions along the ruler, and the\r\nguide wheel has holes drilled through it at different distances\r\nfrom the center\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagrams Showing Construction of Wonder graphs]\r\n\r\nto hold the peg attaching the ruler, these two adjustments,\r\ntogether with the one for changing the other end of the ruler by\r\nthe rows of nails, will make a very great number of combinations\r\npossible. Even a slight change will greatly modify a figure or\r\ngive an entirely new one. Designs may be changed by simply\r\ntwisting the belt, thus reversing the direction of the table.\r\n\r\nIf an arm be fastened to the ruler at right angles to it,\r\ncontaining three or four grooves to hold the pen, still different\r\nfigures will be obtained. A novel effect is made by fastening two\r\npens to this arm at the same time, one filled with red ink and the\r\nother with black ink. The designs will be quite dissimilar and may\r\nbe one traced over the other or one within the other according to\r\nthe relative position of the pens.\r\n\r\nAgain change the size of the guide wheel and note the effect. If\r\nthe diameter of the table is a multiple of that of the guide\r\nwheel, a complete figure of few lobes will result as shown by the\r\none design in the lower right hand corner of the illustration.\r\nWith a very flexible belt tightener an elliptical guide wheel may\r\nbe used. The axis may be taken at one of the foci or at the\r\nintersection of the axis of the ellipse.\r\n\r\nThe most complicated adjustment is to mount the table on the face\r\nof another disc, table and disc revolving in opposite directions.\r\nIt will go through a long series of changes without completing any\r\nfigure and then will repeat itself. The diameters may be made to\r\nvary from the fraction of an inch to as large a diameter as the\r\nsize of the table permits. The designs given here were originally\r\ntraced on drawing paper 6 in. square.\r\n\r\nRemarkable and complex as are the curves produced in this manner,\r\nyet they are but the results obtained by combining simultaneously\r\ntwo simple motions as may be shown in the following manner: Hold\r\nthe table stationary and the pen will trace an oval. But if the\r\nguide wheel is secured in a fixed position and the table is\r\nrevolved a circle will be the result.\r\n\r\nSo much for the machine shown in\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Specimen Scrolls Made on the Wondergraph]\r\n\r\nFig. 1. The number of the modifications of this simple contrivance\r\nis limited only by the ingenuity of the maker. Fig. 2 speaks for\r\nitself. One end of the ruler is fastened in such a way as to have\r\na to-and-fro motion over the arc of a circle and the speed of the\r\ntable is geared down by the addition of another wheel with a small\r\npulley attached. This will give many new designs. In Fig. 3 the\r\nend of the ruler is held by a rubber band against the edge of a\r\nthin triangular piece of wood which is attached to the face of the\r\nfourth wheel. By substituting other plain figures for the\r\ntriangle, or outlining them with small finishing nails, many\r\ncurious modifications such as are shown by the two smallest\r\ndesigns in the illustrations may be obtained. It is necessary, if\r\nsymmetrical designs are to be made, that the fourth wheel and the\r\nguide wheel have the same diameter.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 4, V and W are vertical wheels which may be successfully\r\nconnected with the double horizontal drive wheel if the pulley\r\nbetween the two has a wide flange and is set at the proper angle.\r\nA long strip of paper is given a uniform rectilinear motion as the\r\nstring attached to it is wound around the axle, V. The pen, P, has\r\na motion compounded of two simultaneous motions at right angles to\r\neach other given by the two guide wheels. Designs such as shown as\r\na border at the top and bottom of the illustration are obtained in\r\nthis way. If the vertical wheels are disconnected and the paper\r\nfastened in place the well known Lissajou\'s curves are obtained.\r\nThese curves may be traced by various methods, but this\r\narrangement is about the simplest of them all. The design in this\r\ncase will change as the ratio of the diameters of the two guide\r\nwheels are changed.\r\n\r\nThese are only a few of the many adjustments that are possible.\r\nFrequently some new device will give a figure which is apparently\r\nlike one obtained in some other way, yet, if you will watch the\r\nway in which the two are commenced and developed into the complete\r\ndesign you will find they are formed quite differently.\r\n\r\nThe average boy will take delight in making a wondergraph and in\r\ninventing the many improvements that are sure to suggest\r\nthemselves to him. At all events it will not be time thrown away,\r\nfor, simple as the contrivance is, it will arouse latent energies\r\nwhich may develop along more useful lines in maturer years.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a 110-Volt Transformer [439]\r\n\r\nSecure two magnets from a telephone bell, or a set of magnets\r\nwound for 2,000 ohms.

Rubsan, Muskogee, Okla.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Experiment with a Vacuum [439]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Experimental Apparatus]\r\n\r\nTake any kitchen utensil used for frying purposes-an ordinary\r\nskillet, or spider, works best-having a smooth inner bottom\r\nsurface, and turn in water to the depth of 1/2 in. Cut a piece of\r\ncardboard circular to fit the bottom of the spider and make a hole\r\nin the center 4 in. in diameter. The hole will need to correspond\r\nto the size of the can used. It should be 1 in. less in diameter\r\nthan that of the can. Place this cardboard in the bottom of the\r\nspider under the water. A 2-qt. syrup can or pail renders the best\r\ndemonstration, although good results may be obtained from the use\r\nof an ordinary tomato can. The edge of the can must have no\r\nindentations, so it will fit perfectly tight all around on the\r\ncardboard. Place the can bottom side up and evenly over the hole\r\nin the cardboard. Put a sufficient weight on the can to prevent it\r\nmoving on the cardboard, but not too heavy, say, l lb.\r\n\r\nPlace the spider with its adjusted contents upon a heated stove.\r\nSoon the inverted can will begin to agitate. When this agitation\r\nfinally ceases remove the spider from the stove, being careful not\r\nto move the can, and if the quickest results are desired, apply\r\nsnow, ice or cold water to the surface of the can until the sides\r\nbegin to flatten. The spider with its entire contents may now be\r\nlifted by taking hold of the can. When the vacuum is complete the\r\nsides of the can will suddenly collapse, and sometimes, with a\r\nconsiderable report, jump from the spider.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the foregoing phenomenon is that the circular hole in\r\nthe cardboard admits direct heat from the surface of the spider.\r\nThis heat causes the air in the can to expand, which is allowed to\r\nescape by agitation, the water and the cardboard acting as a valve\r\nto prevent its re-entrance. When the enclosed air is expelled by\r\nthe heat and a vacuum is formed by the cooling, the above results\r\nare obtained as described.\r\n--Contributed by N. J.

At first it seems impossible to secure such\r\na picture, but when told that a mirror was used the process is\r\nthen known to be a simple one.\r\n\r\nThe mirror is set in such a way as to allow the camera and\r\noperator, when standing directly in front of it, to be\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photographing the Photographer]\r\n\r\nin a rather strong light.

With a few exceptions all the parts\r\nare short lengths of pipe and common tees, elbows and nipples.\r\n\r\nThe wheels were manufactured for use on a baby carriage. The\r\nsprocket wheel and chain were taken from a discarded bicycle,\r\nwhich was also drawn upon for the cork handle used on the steering\r\nlever. The floor is made of 1-in. white pine, 14 in. wide and 48\r\nin. long, to which are bolted ordinary flanges to hold the framing\r\nand the, propelling and steering apparatus together. The axles\r\nwere made from 3/8 in. shafting. The fifth wheel consists of two\r\nsmall flanges working on the face surfaces. These flanges and the\r\nauxiliary steering rod are connected to the axles by means of\r\nholes stamped in the piece of sheet iron which encases the axle.\r\nThe sheet iron was first properly stamped and then bent around the\r\naxle. The levers for propelling and steering the car work in\r\nfulcrums made for use in lever valves. The turned wooden handles\r\nby which these levers are operated were inserted through holes\r\ndrilled in the connecting tees. The working joint for the steering\r\nand hand levers consists of a 1/2 by 3/8 by 3/8 in. tee, a 1/2 by\r\n3/8 in. cross and a piece of rod threaded on both ends and screwed\r\ninto the tee. The cross is reamed and, with the rod, forms a\r\nbearing.\r\n\r\nThe operation of this little hand car is very similar in principle\r\nto that of the ordinary tricycle, says Domestic Engineering. The\r\nmachine can be propelled as fast as a boy can run. It responds\r\nreadily to the slightest movement of the steering lever.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Rustic Seat [441]\r\n\r\nThe rustic settee illustrated in Fig. 1 may be made 6 ft. long,\r\nwhich will accommodate four average-sized persons. It is not\r\nadvisable to exceed this length, as then it would look out of\r\nproportion, says the Wood-Worker. Select the material for the\r\nposts, and for preference branches that are slightly curved, as\r\nshown in the sketch. The front posts are about 3-1/2 in. in\r\ndiameter by 2 ft. 4 in. long. The back posts are 3 ft. 4 in. high,\r\nwhile the center post is 3 ft. 8 in. in height. The longitudinal\r\nand transverse rails are about 3 in. in diameter and their ends\r\nare pared away to fit the post to which they are connected by\r\n1-in. diameter dowels. This method is shown in Fig. 4. The dowel\r\nholes are bored at a distance of 1 ft. 2-1/2 in, up from the lower\r\nends of posts. The front center leg is partially halved to the\r\nfront rail and also connected to the back post by a bearer, 4 in.\r\ndeep by 1-1/2 in. thick. This bearer is tenoned to the back post.\r\n\r\nFig. 3 shows a sectional view of the bearer joint to front leg,\r\nand also the half-round seat battens resting on the bearer, also\r\nshowing them with their edges planed. It is advisable to have a\r\nspace between the edges of each batten, say about 1-8 in., to\r\nallow rainwater to drain. The ends of the seat battens are pared\r\naway to fit the transverse rails neatly as shown in Fig. 2. The\r\nstruts for the post range in diameter from 1-1/2 in. to 2 in. The\r\nends of the struts are pared to fit the posts and\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rustic Seat and Details of Construction]\r\n\r\nrails, and are then secured with two or three brads at each end.\r\n\r\nSelect curved pieces, about 2-1/2 in. in diameter, for the arm\r\nrests and back rails; while the diagonally placed filling may be\r\nabout 2 in. in diameter. Start with the shortest lengths, cutting\r\nthem longer than required, as the paring necessary to fit them to\r\nthe rails and posts shortens them a little. Brad them in position\r\nas they are fitted, and try to arrange them at regular intervals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Heated Steering Wheel [441]\r\n\r\nMotorists that suffer with cold hands while driving their cars may\r\nhave relief by using a steering wheel that is provided with\r\nelectric heat. An English invention describes a steering wheel\r\nwith a core that carries two electrically heated coils insulated\r\none from the other and from the outer rim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Homemade Workbench [442]\r\nBy C. E. McKINNEY, Jr.\r\n\r\nThe first appliance necessary for the boy\'s workshop is a\r\nworkbench. The average boy that desires to construct his own\r\napparatus as much as possible can make the bench as described\r\nherein. Four pieces of 2 by 4-in. pine are cut 23 in. long for the\r\nlegs, and a tenon made on each end of them, 1/2 in. thick, 3-1/2\r\nin. wide and 1-1/2 in. long, as shown\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Details of Construction of Homemade Workbench]\r\n\r\nat A and B, Fig. 1. The crosspieces at the top and bottom of the\r\nlegs are made from the same material and cut 20 in. long. A\r\nmortise is made 1-1/4 in. from each end of these pieces and in the\r\nnarrow edge of them, as shown at C and D, Fig. 1. The corners are\r\nthen cut sloping from the edge of the leg out and to the middle of\r\nthe piece, as shown. When each pair of legs are fitted to a pair\r\nof crosspieces they will form the two supports for the bench.\r\nThese supports are held together and braced with two braces or\r\nconnecting pieces of 2 by 4-in. pine, 24 in. long. The joints are\r\nmade between the ends of these pieces and the legs by boring a\r\nhole through each leg and into the center of each end of the\r\nbraces to a depth of 4 in., as shown at J, Fig. 2. On the back\r\nside of the braces bore holes, intersecting the other holes, for a\r\nplace to insert the nut of a bolt, as shown at HH. Four 3/8 by\r\n6-in, bolts are placed in the holes bored, and the joints are\r\ndrawn together as shown at J. The ends of the two braces must be\r\nsawed off perfectly square to make the supports stand up straight.\r\n\r\nIn making this part of the bench be sure to have the joints fit\r\nclosely and to draw the bolts up tight on the stretchers. There is\r\nnothing quite so annoying as to have the bench support sway while\r\nwork is being done on its top. It would be well to add a cross\r\nbrace on the back side to prevent any rocking while planing\r\nboards, if the bench is to be used for large work.\r\n\r\nThe main top board M, Fig. 2, may be either made from one piece of\r\n2 by 12-in. plank, 3-1/2 ft. long, or made up of 14 strips of\r\nmaple, 7/8 in. thick by 2 in. wide and 3-1/2 ft. long, set on\r\nedge, each strip glued and screwed to its neighbor. When building\r\nup a top like this be careful to put the strips together with the\r\ngrain running in the same direction so the top may be planed\r\nsmooth. The back board N is the same length as the main top board\r\nM, 8-1/2 in. wide and only 7/8 in. thick, which is fitted into a\r\n1/2/-in. rabbet int back of the board M. Thes boards form the top\r\nof the bench, and are fastened to the top pieces of the supports\r\nwith long screws. The board E is 10 in. wide and nailed to the\r\nback of the bench. On top of this board and at right angles with\r\nit is fastened a 2-1/2-in. board, F. These two boards are 7/8 in.\r\nthick and 3-1/2 ft. long. Holes are bored or notches are cut in\r\nthe projecting board, F, to hold tools.\r\n\r\nDetails of the vise are shown in Fig. 3, which is composed of a 2\r\nby 6-in. block 12 in. long, into which is fastened an iron bench\r\nscrew, S. Two guide rails, GG, 7/8 by 1-1/2 in. and 20 in. long,\r\nare fastened into mortises of the block as shown at KK, and they\r\nslide in corresponding mortises in a piece of 2 by 4-in. pine\r\nbolted to the under side of the main top board as shown at L. The\r\nbench screw nut is fastened in the 2 by 4-in. piece, L, between\r\nthe two mortised holes. This piece, L, is securely nailed to one\r\nof the top cross pieces, C, of the supports and to a piece of 2 by\r\n4-in. pine, P, that is bolted to the under sides of the top boards\r\nat the end of the bench. The bolts and the bench screw can be\r\npurchased from any hardware store for less than one dollar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Forming Coils to Make Flexible Wire Connections [443]\r\n\r\nWhen connections are made to bells and batteries with small copper\r\nwires covered with cotton or silk, it is necessary to have a coil\r\nin a short piece of the line to make it flexible. A good way to do\r\nthis is to provide a short rod about 3/16 in. in diameter cut with\r\na slit in one end to hold the wire and a loop made on the other\r\nend to turn with the fingers. The end of the wire is\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Forming Wire Coils]\r\n\r\nplaced in the slit and the coil made around the rod by turning\r\nwith the loop end.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Photographing the North Star [443]\r\n\r\nThe earth revolving as upon an axis is inclined in such a position\r\nthat it points toward the North Star. To an observer in the\r\nnorthern hemisphere the effect is the same as if the heavens\r\nrevolved with the North star as a center. A plate exposed in a\r\ncamera which is pointed toward that part of the sky on a clear\r\nnight records that effect in a striking manner. The accompanying\r\nillustration is from a photograph taken with an exposure of about\r\nthree hours, and the trace of the stars shown on the plate by a\r\nseries of concentric circles are due to the rotation of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe bright arc of the circle nearest the center is the path of the\r\nNorth star. The other arcs are the impressions left by neighboring\r\nstars, and it will be noticed that their brightness varies with\r\ntheir relative brilliancy. Many are so faint as to be scarcely\r\ndistinguished, and, of course, telescopic power would reveal\r\nmyriads of heavenly bodies which leave no trace on a plate in an\r\nordinary camera. The North or pole star is commonly considered at\r\na point directly out from the axis of the earth, but the\r\nphotograph shows that it is not so located. The variation is known\r\nastronomically to be 1-1/4 deg. There is a slight irregularity in\r\nthe position of the earth\'s axis, but the changes are so slow as\r\nto be noticed only by the lapse of a thousand years. Five thousand\r\nyears ago the pole star was Draconis, and in eighteen thousand\r\nyears it will be Lyrae. We have direct evidence of the change of\r\nthe earth\'s axis in one of the Egyptian pyramids where an aperture\r\nmarked the position of the pole star in ancient times, and from\r\nthis it is now deviated considerable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photograph of the North Star]\r\n\r\nThis experiment is within the reach of everyone owning a camera.\r\nThe photograph shown was taken by an ordinary instrument, using a\r\nstandard plate of common speed. The largest stop was used and the\r\nonly requirement beyond this is to adjust the camera in a position\r\nat the proper inclination and to make the exposure for as long as\r\ndesired. On long winter nights the exposure may be extended to 12\r\nhours, in which event the curves would be lengthened to full\r\nhalf-circles.\r\n\r\nThe North star is one of the easiest to locate in the entire\r\nheavens. The constellation known as the Great Dipper is near by,\r\nand the two stars that mark the corners of the dipper on the\r\nextremity farthest from the handle lie in a line that passes\r\nacross the North star. These two stars in the Great Dipper are\r\ncalled the pointers. The North Star is of considerable brilliancy,\r\nthough by no means the brightest in that part of the heavens.\r\n--Contributed by O.

The usual method is to place the burnt\r\nportion of the match in the flame to be relighted as shown\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Relighting a Match]\r\n\r\nin Fig. 1. It is very hard to relight the charred end and usually\r\nburnt fingers are the result of pushing the match farther in the\r\nflame. Hold the burnt end in the fingers and place the other end\r\nin the flame as shown in Fig. 2. A light will be secured quickly\r\nand the flame will only follow the stick to the old burnt portion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Home-Made Hand Drill [444]\r\n\r\nIn the old kitchen tool box I found a rusty egg beater of the type\r\nshown in Fig. 1. A shoemaker friend\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Details of Hand Drill Construction]\r\n\r\ndonated a pegging awl, Fig. 2, discarded by him due to a broken\r\nhandle. With these two pieces of apparatus I made a hand drill for\r\nlight work in wood or metal. By referring to Fig. 3 the chuck, A,\r\nwith stem, B, were taken from the awl. The long wire beater was\r\ntaken from the beater frame and a wire nail, 0, soldered to the\r\nframe, D, in the place of the wire. The flat arms were cut off and\r\nshaped as shown by E. The hole in the small gear, G, was drilled\r\nout and a tube, F, fitted and soldered to both the gear and the\r\narms E. This tube, with the gear and arms, was slipped over the\r\nnail, 0, then a washer and, after cutting to the proper length the\r\nnail was riveted to make a loose yet neat fit for the small gear.\r\nThe hand drill was then completed by soldering the stem, B, of the\r\nchuck to the ends of the flat arms E. Drills were made by breaking\r\noff sewing-machine needles above the eye as shown in Fig. 4 at A,\r\nand the end ground to a drill point.\r\n--Contributed by R. B.

Mills of this kind can\r\nbe built of larger size and in some localities have been used for\r\npumping water.\r\n\r\nTwo semi-circular surfaces are secured to the axle at right angles\r\nto each other and at 45 deg. angle with that of the axle as shown\r\nin Fig. 2. This axle and wings are mounted in bearings on a solid\r\nor stationary stand or frame. By mounting a pulley on the axle\r\nwith the wings it can be used to run toy machinery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Electric Anesthesia [445]\r\n\r\nIt is a well known fact that magnetism is used to demagnetize a\r\nwatch, and that frost is drawn out of a frozen member of the body\r\nby the application of snow. Heat is also drawn out of a burned\r\nhand by holding it close to the fire, then gradually drawing it\r\naway. The following experiment will show how a comparatively\r\nfeeble electric current can undo the work of a strong one.\r\n\r\nI once tried to electrocute a rat which was caught in a wire\r\nbasket trap and accidentally discovered a painless method. I say\r\npainless, because the rodent does not object to a second or third\r\nexperiment after recovering, and is apparently rigid and without\r\nfeeling while under its influence.\r\n\r\nTo those who would like to try the experiment I will say that my\r\noutfit consisted of an induction coil with a 3/8-in. iron core\r\nabout 3 in. long. The primary coil was wound with four layers of\r\nNo. 20 wire and the secondary contains 4 oz. No. 32 wire, and used\r\non one cell of bichromate of potash plunge battery. The proper\r\namount of current used can be determined by giving the rodent as\r\nmuch as a healthy man would care to take. Fasten one secondary\r\nelectrode to the trap containing the rat and with a wire nail\r\nfastened to the other terminal, hold the vibrator of the coil with\r\nyour finger and let the rat bite on the nail and while doing so\r\nrelease the vibrator. In three seconds the rat will be as rigid as\r\nif dead and the wires can be removed.\r\n\r\nNow connect your wires to the primary binding-posts of the coil\r\nand wind the end of one of them around the rat\'s tail and start\r\nthe vibrator. Touch the other terminal to the rat\'s ear and nose.\r\nIn a few minutes he will be as lively as ever.\r\n--Contributed by Chas. Haeusser, Albany, N.

A binding-post is fastened to\r\nthis board at each end, to which is attached the ends of the\r\nspring, as shown in Fig. 1. The temper of a small portion of each\r\nend of the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Battery Rheostat]\r\n\r\nspring will need to be drawn. This can be accomplished by heating\r\nover an alcohol lamp or in a fire and allowing it to cool slowly.\r\nThe ends are then shaped to fit the binding-posts. A wire is\r\nconnected to one of the binding-posts and a small square piece of\r\ncopper is attached to the other end of the wire, as shown in Fig.\r\n2. When this device is placed in a circuit the current can be\r\nregulated by sliding the small square copper piece along the\r\nspring.\r\n--Contributed by H. D.

The problem may be solved in\r\nthe following way:\r\n\r\nMake a rectangular frame out of pine wood, 1/4 by 1/2 in., as\r\nshown in the sketch. It is made a little wider and a little\r\nshorter than the film to be dried. This will allow the end of the\r\nfilm to be turned over at each end of the frame and fastened with\r\npush pins. Do not stretch the film when putting it on the frame as\r\nit shrinks in drying. The film will dry quicker and will be flat\r\nwhen dried by using this frame.\r\n--Contributed by Elmer H. Flehr, Ironton, Ohio.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Home-Made Novelty Clock [446]\r\n\r\nThis clock that is shown in the accompanying engraving is made in\r\nscroll work, the cathedral and towers being of white maple, the\r\nbase is of walnut with mahogany trimmings, all finished in their\r\nnatural colors. It has 11 bells in the two towers at the sides and\r\n13\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Clock]\r\n\r\nminiature electric lamps of different colors on two electric\r\ncircuits. The clock is operated by a small motor receiving its\r\npower from dry cell batteries. This motor turns a brass cylinder\r\nover which runs a continuous roll of perforated paper similar to\r\nthat used on a pianola. A series of metal fingers, connected by\r\nwires to the bells, press lightly on this brass roll and are\r\ninsulated from the roll by the perforated paper passing between.\r\nWhen a perforation is reached a finger will make a contact with\r\nthe brass roll for an instant which makes a circuit with the\r\nmagnet of an electric hammer in its respective bell or forms the\r\ncircuit which lights the electric bulbs as the case may be.\r\n\r\nAt each hour and half hour as the clock strikes, the motor is\r\nstarted automatically and the chimes sound out the tunes while the\r\ncolored lights are turned on and off; two small doors in the\r\ncathedral open and a small figure comes out while the chimes are\r\nplaying, then returns and the doors are closed.\r\n--Contributed by C.

The powder charge is in the safest form\r\npossible, as it is fired with a blow from a hammer instead of\r\nlighting a fuse. If the cannon is made according to directions,\r\nthere cannot possibly be any explosion.\r\n\r\nThe materials used in the construction of the catapult may be\r\nfound in almost any junk pile, and the only work required, outside\r\nof what can be done at home, is to have a few threads cut on the\r\npieces of pipe. The fittings can be procured ready to attach,\r\nexcept for drilling a hole for the firing pin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Homemade Cannon Which will Hurl a Life-Size Dummy\r\n100 Ft. through the Air]\r\n\r\nSecure a piece of common gas pipe, 4 to 6 in. in diameter, the\r\nlength being from 18 to 24 in. Old pipe may be used if it is\r\nstraight. Have a machinist cut threads on the outside of one end,\r\nas shown in Fig. 1, and fit an iron cap, Fig. 2, tightly on the\r\nthreaded end of the pipe. The cap is drilled and tapped in the\r\ncenter for a 1-in. pipe. Thread both ends of a 1-in. pipe that is\r\n4 in. long, Fig. 3, and turn one end securely into the threaded\r\nhole of the cap. This pipe should project 1/4 in. inside of the\r\ncap. Fit a cap, Fig. 4, loosely on the other end of the 1-in.\r\npipe. A hole is drilled into the center of this small cap just\r\nlarge enough to receive a 6-penny wire nail, B, Fig. 4.\r\n\r\nThis completes the making of the cannon and the next step is to\r\nconstruct a dummy which can be dressed in old clothes. Cut out two\r\nround blocks of wood from hard pine or oak that is about 3 in.\r\nthick, as shown in Fig. 5. The diameter of these blocks should be\r\nabout 1/8 in. less than the hole in the cannon, so they will slide\r\neasily. In the center of each block bore a 1/4-in. hole. Secure an\r\niron rod, about 4 ft. long, and make a ring at one end and thread\r\n4 in. of the other. Slip one of the circular blocks on the rod and\r\nmove it up toward the ring about 14 in. Turn a nut on the threads,\r\nstopping it about 3-1/2 in. from the end of the rod. Slip the\r\nother circular piece of wood on the rod and up against the nut,\r\nand turn on another nut to hold the wooden block firmly in its\r\nplace at the end of the rod. If the rod is flattened at the place\r\nwhere the upper block is located, it will hold tight. These are\r\nshown in Fig. 5. Take some iron wire about 1/8 in. in diameter and\r\nmake a loop at the top of the rod for the head. Wire this loop to\r\nthe ring made in the rod and make the head about this loop by\r\nusing canvas or gunny cloth sewed up forming a bag into which is\r\nstuffed either excelsior, paper or hay. The arms are made by\r\nlashing with fine wire or strong hemp, a piece of wood 1 in.\r\nsquare and 20 in. long, or one cut in the shape shown in Fig. 6,\r\nto the rod. Place the wood arms close to the bottom of the head.\r\nMake a triangle of wire and fasten it and the cross arm securely\r\nto the top of the rod to keep them from slipping down. A false\r\nface, or one painted on white cloth, can be sewed on the stuffed\r\nbag. An old coat and trousers are put on the frame to complete the\r\ndummy. If the clothing is not too heavy and of white material so\r\nmuch the better. To greatly increase the spectacular flight\r\nthrough the air, a number of different colored streamers, 6 or 8\r\nin. wide and several feet in length made from bunting, can be\r\nattached about the waist of the dummy. The complete dummy should\r\nnot weigh more than 6 lb.\r\n\r\nThe cannon is mounted on a board with the cap end resting against\r\na cleat which is securely nailed to the board and then bound\r\ntightly with a rope as shown in Fig. 8. Lay one end of the board\r\non the ground and place the other on boxes or supports\r\nsufficiently high to incline it at an angle of about 45. deg.\r\nEnough of the board should project beyond the end of the cannon on\r\nwhich to lay the dummy. When completed as described, it is then\r\nready to load and fire. Clear away everyone in front and on each\r\nside of the cannon, as the dummy will fly from 50 to 100 ft. and\r\nno one must be in range of its flight. This is important, as the\r\nrod of the frame holding the clothes will penetrate a board at\r\nshort range. An ordinary shot gun cartridge of the paper shell\r\ntype is used for the charge and it must be loaded with powder\r\nonly. Coarse black powder is the best, but any size will do. When\r\nloading\xc2\xb7 the rod with the wooden blocks, on which the dummy is\r\nattached, do not place the end block against the breech end of the\r\ncannon, leave about 2 or 3 in. between the end of the cannon and\r\nthe block. Insert the cartridge in the 1-in. pipe. The cartridge\r\nshould fit the pipe snug, which it will do if the proper size is\r\nsecured. Screw on the firing-cap, insert the wire nail firing pin\r\nuntil it rests against the firing-cap of the cartridge. If the\r\nrange is clear the firing may be done by giving the nail a sharp\r\nrap with a hammer. A loud report will follow with a cloud of smoke\r\nand the dummy will be seen flying through the air, the arms, legs\r\nand streamers fluttering, which presents a most realistic and\r\nlife-like appearance. The firing may be repeated any number of\r\ntimes in the same manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Make a Miniature Volcano [448]\r\n\r\nA toy volcano that will send forth flames and ashes with lava\r\nstreaming down its sides in real volcanic action can be made by\r\nany boy without any more danger than firing an ordinary\r\nfire-cracker. A mound of sand or earth is built up about 1 ft.\r\nhigh in the shape of a volcano. Roll up a piece of heavy paper,\r\nmaking a tube 5 in. long and 1-1/2 in. in diameter. This tube of\r\npaper is placed in the top of the mound by first setting it upon a\r\nflat sheet of paper and building up the sand or\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Volcano in Action]\r\n\r\nearth about the sides until it is all covered excepting the top\r\nopening. This is to keep all dampness away from the mixture to be\r\nplaced within.\r\n\r\nA fuse from a fire-cracker, or one made by winding some powder in\r\ntissue paper, is placed in the paper tube of the volcano with one\r\nend extending over the edge. Get some potash from a drug store and\r\nbe sure to state the purpose for which it is wanted, as there are\r\nnumerous kinds of potash that will not be suitable. An equal\r\namount of sugar is mixed with the potash and placed in the paper\r\ntube. On top of this put a layer of pure potash and on this pour\r\nsome gun powder. This completes the volcano and it only remains\r\nfor the fuse to be lighted and action will begin with an explosion\r\nwhich sends fire, smoke and sparks upward. Flames will follow and\r\nthe lava pours down the sides of the mound.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Wire Loop Connections for Battery Binding-Posts [449]\r\n\r\nThe trouble with battery binding post connections can be avoided\r\nby winding the bare end of the connecting wire around the\r\nbinding-post screw and then back around its extending length as\r\nshown in the sketch. Always screw down permanent connections with\r\npliers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Loop]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Melting Metal in the Flame of a Match [449]\r\n\r\nThe flame of an ordinary match has a much higher temperature than\r\nis generally known and will melt cast-iron or steel filings. Try\r\nit by striking a match and sprinkle the filings through the flame.\r\nSputtering sparks like gunpowder will be the result of the melting\r\nmetal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Russian Squirrels [449]\r\n\r\nThe squirrel slaughter of Russia amounts to 25,000,000 per year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Landscape Drawing Made Easy [449]\r\n\r\nWith this device anyone, no matter how little his artistic ability\r\nmay be, can draw accurately and quickly any little bit of scenery\r\nor other subject and get everything in the true perspective and in\r\nthe correct proportion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Drawing with the Aid of Reflecting Glasses]\r\n\r\nNo lens is required for making this camera-just a plain mirror set\r\nat an angle of 45 deg., with a piece of ordinary glass underneath,\r\na screen with a peek hole and a board for holding the drawing\r\npaper. The different parts may be fastened together by means of a\r\nbox frame, or may be hinged together to allow folding up when\r\ncarrying and a good tripod of heavy design should be used for\r\nsupporting it. In order to get the best results the screen should\r\nbe blackened on the inside and the eyepiece should be blackened on\r\nthe side next to the eye. A piece of black cardboard placed over\r\nthe end of the eyepiece and perforated with a pin makes an\r\nexcellent peek hole.\r\n\r\nIn operation the rays of light coming from any given object, such\r\nas the arrow AB, strike the inclined mirror and are reflected\r\ndownward.

Thus an understanding will be gained of how the parts fit\r\ntogether, and of the way to proceed with the work.\r\n\r\nDimensioned drawings of the canoe and molds are contained in Fig.\r\n1. The boat is built on a temporary base, A, Fig. 2, which is a\r\nboard, 14 ft. 1 in. long, 3 in. wide and 1-1/2 in. thick. This\r\nbase is fastened to the trestles and divided into four sections,\r\nthe sections on each side of the center being 4 ft. long.\r\n\r\nThe next thing to be considered are the molds (Fig. 3). These are\r\nmade of 1-in. material. Scrap pieces may be found that can be used\r\nfor these molds. The dimensions given in Fig 1 are for one-half of\r\neach form as shown in Fig. 3, under their respective letters. The\r\nmolds are then temporarily attached to the base on the division\r\nlines.\r\n\r\nProceed to make the curved ends as shown in Fig. 4. Two pieces of\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Shaping the Canoe]\r\n\r\nstraight-grained green elm, 32 in. long, 1-3/4, in. wide and 1 in.\r\nthick, will be required. The elm can be obtained from a carriage\r\nor blacksmith\'s shop. The pieces are bent by wrapping a piece of\r\nwire around the upper end and baseboard. The joint between the\r\ncurved piece and the base is temporary. Place a stick between the\r\nwires and twist them until the required shape is secured. If the\r\nwood does not bend readily, soak it in boiling water. The vertical\r\nheight and the horizontal length of this bend are shown in Fig. 4.\r\nThe twisted wire will give the right curve and hold the wood in\r\nshape until it is dry.\r\n\r\nThe gunwales are the long pieces B, Fig. 2, at the top of the\r\ncanoe. These are made of strips of ash, 15 ft. long, 1 in. wide\r\nand 1 in. thick. Fasten them temporarily to the molds, taking care\r\nto have them snugly fit the notches shown. The ends fit over the\r\noutside of the stem and stern pieces and are cut to form a sharp\r\npoint, as shown in Fig. 5. The ends of the gunwales are fastened\r\npermanently to the upper ends of the bent stem and stern pieces\r\nwith several screws.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Construction of the Various Parts]\r\n\r\nTwo other light strips, C and D, Fig. 2, are temporarily put in,\r\nand evenly spaced between the gunwales and the bottom board. These\r\nstrips are used to give the form to the ribs, and are removed when\r\nthey have served their purpose.\r\n\r\nThe ribs are now put in place. They are formed of strips of well\r\nseasoned elm or hickory, soaked in boiling water until they bend\r\nwithout breaking or cracking. Each rib should be 1-1/2 in.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Paddle Parts]\r\n\r\nwide, 3/8 in. thick and long enough to reach the distance between\r\nthe gunwales after the bend is made. The ribs are placed 1 in.\r\napart. Begin by placing a rib in the center of the base and on the\r\nupper side. Nail it temporarily, yet securely, and then curve the\r\nends and place them inside of the gunwales, as shown in Fig. 6.\r\nFasten the ends of the rib to the gunwales with 1-in. galvanized\r\nbrads. This method is used in placing all the ribs. When the ribs\r\nare set, remove the pieces C and D, Fig. 2, and the molds.\r\n\r\nA strip is now put in to take the place of the base. This strip is\r\n1-3/4 in. wide, 1/2 in. thick and long enough to reach the entire\r\nlength of the bottom of the canoe. It is fastened with screws on\r\nthe inside, as shown in Fig. 7, and the ends are lap-jointed to\r\nthe stem and stern pieces as shown in Fig. 4. When this piece is\r\nfastened in place, the base can be removed. The seats are attached\r\nas shown in Fig. 8, and the small pieces for each end are fitted\r\nas shown in Fig. 9.\r\n\r\nThe frame of the canoe is now ready to be covered. This will\r\nrequire 5-1/2 yd. of extra-heavy canvas. Turn the framework of the\r\ncanoe upside down and place the canvas on it. The center of the\r\ncanvas is located and tacked to the center strip of the canoe at\r\nthe points where ribs are attached. Copper tacks should be used.\r\nThe canvas is then tacked to the ribs, beginning at the center rib\r\nand working toward each end, carefully drawing the canvas as\r\ntightly as possible and keeping it straight. At the ends the\r\ncanvas is split in the center and lapped over the bent wood. The\r\nsurplus canvas is cut off. A thin coat of glue is put on, to\r\nshrink the cloth and make it waterproof.\r\n\r\nThe glue should be powdered and brought into liquid form in a\r\ndouble boiler. A thin coat of this is applied with a paintbrush. A\r\nsmall keel made of a strip of wood is placed on the bottom to\r\nprotect it when making a landing on sand and stones in shallow\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Single Paddle]\r\n\r\nwater. When the glue is thoroughly dry the canvas is covered with\r\ntwo coats of paint, made up in any color with the best lead and\r\nboiled linseed oil. The inside is coated with spar varnish to give\r\nit a wood color.\r\n\r\nThe paddles may be made up in two ways, single or double. The\r\ndouble paddle has a hickory pole, 7 ft. long and 2 in. in\r\ndiameter, for its center part. The paddle is made as shown in Fig.\r\n10, of ash or cypress. It is 12 in. long, and 8 in. wide at the\r\nwidest part. The paddle end fits into a notch cut in the end of\r\nthe pole (Fig. 11).\r\n\r\nA shield is made of a piece of tin or rubber and placed around the\r\npole near the paddle to prevent the water from running to the\r\ncenter as the pole is tipped from side to side. The complete\r\npaddle is shown in Fig. 12. A single paddle is made as shown in\r\nFig. 13. This is made of ash or any other tough wood. The\r\ndimensions given in the sketch are sufficient without a\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Thorns Used as Needles on a Phonograph [453]\r\n\r\nVery sharp thorns can be used successfully as phonograph needles.\r\nThese substitutes will reproduce sound very clearly and with\r\nbeautiful tone. The harsh scratching of the ordinary needle is\r\nreduced to a minimum, and the thorn is not injurious to the\r\nrecord.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Tool Hangers [453]\r\n\r\nA tool rack that is serviceable for almost any kind of a tool may\r\nbe made\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tool Hanger]\r\n\r\nby placing rows of different-size screw eyes on a wall close to\r\nthe workbench, so that files, chisels, pliers and other tools, and\r\nthe handles of hammers can be slipped through the eyes.\r\n\r\nA place for every tool saves time, and besides, when the tools are\r\nhung up separately, they are less likely to be damaged, than when\r\nkept together on the workbench.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Child\'s Footrest on an Ordinary Chair [453]\r\n\r\nSmall chairs are enjoyed very much by children for the reason that\r\nthey can rest their feet on the floor. In many households there\r\nare no small chairs for the youngsters, and they have to use\r\nlarger ones. Two things result, the child\'s legs become tired from\r\ndangling unsupported or by trying to support them on the\r\nstretchers, and the finish on the chair is apt to\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Footrest on Chair]\r\n\r\nbe scratched. The device shown in the sketch forms a footrest or\r\nstep that can be placed on any chair. It can be put on or taken\r\noff in a moment. Two suitable pieces of wood are nailed together\r\nat an angle and a small notch cut out, as shown, to fit the chair\r\nstretcher.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Drying Photo Postal Cards [453]\r\n\r\nA novel idea for drying photo postal cards comes from a French\r\nmagazine. The drying of the cards takes a long time on account of\r\ntheir thickness, but may be hastened by using corrugated paper for\r\npacking bottles as a drying stand. Curve the cards, printed side\r\nup, and place the ends between two\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Card on Dryer]\r\n\r\ncorrugations at a convenient distance apart. They will thus be\r\nheld firmly while the air can circulate freely all around them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Preserving Key Forms [454]\r\n\r\nAfter losing a key or two and having some difficulty in replacing\r\nthem, I used the method shown in the sketch\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Key Forms Cut in Paper]\r\n\r\nto preserve the outlines for making new ones. All the keys I had\r\nwere traced on a piece of paper and their forms cut out with a\r\npair of shears. When a key was lost, another could thus be easily\r\nmade by using the paper form as a pattern.\r\n--Contributed by Ernest Weaver, Santa Anna, Texas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** Renewing Typewriter Ribbons [454]\r\n\r\nRoll the ribbon on a spool and meanwhile apply a little glycerine\r\nwith a fountain-pen filler. Roll up tightly and lay aside for a\r\nweek or ten days. Do not apply too much glycerine as this will\r\nmake the ribbon sticky--a very little, well spread, is enough. The\r\nsame application will also work well on ink pads.\r\n--Contributed by Earl R.

The device is in the form of an\r\nattachment readily connected to or removed from any ordinary pen\r\nand holder, although the chances are that when once used it will\r\nnot be detached until a new pen is needed.\r\n\r\nTake the butt end of a quill, A, from a chicken, goose or turkey\r\nfeather--the latter preferred as it will hold more ink--and clean\r\nout the membrane in it thoroughly with a wire or hatpin. Then make\r\na hole in the tapered end of the quill just large enough to pull\r\nthrough a piece of cotton string. Tie a knot in one end of this\r\nstring, B, and pull it through the small end of the quill until\r\nthe knot chokes within, then cut off the string so that only 1/4\r\nin. projects. Shave out a small stopper from a bottle cork for the\r\nlarge end\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fountain Attachment]\r\n\r\nof the quill. This completes the ink reservoir.\r\n\r\nPlace the quill on top of the penholder C, so that its small end\r\nrests against the pen immediately above its eye. Pull the string\r\nthrough this eye. Securely bind the quill to the pen and holder\r\nwith a thread, as shown, first placing under it a wedge-shaped\r\nsupport of cork or wood, D, hollowed on both sides to fit the\r\ncurved surfaces of the quill and holder. The illustration shows\r\nthe detail clearly.\r\n\r\nTo fill the reservoir place the pen upright on its point and dip a\r\nsmall camel\'s-hair brush or cloth-bound toothpick into the ink\r\nbottle and "scrape" off the ink it will hold on the inner edge of\r\nthe quill. Cork tightly, and the device is ready for use. When not\r\nin use place the holder at an angle with the pen uppermost.\r\n--Contributed by Chelsea C. Fraser, Saginaw, Michigan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** How to Construct a Small Thermostat [455]\r\nBy R. A. McCLURE\r\n\r\nIt is a well known fact, that there is a change in the dimensions\r\nof a piece of metal, due to a change in its temperature. This\r\nchange in dimensions is not the same for all materials; it being\r\nmuch greater in some\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Simple Thermostat; Couple and Mounting Strip]\r\n\r\nmaterials than in others, while in some there is practically no\r\nchange.\r\n\r\nIf two thin, narrow strips of different metals, that contract or\r\nexpand at different ratio due to a variation in temperature, be\r\nrigidly fastened together at their ends, and the combination then\r\nheated or cooled, the combined piece will have its shape changed.\r\nOne of the pieces will increase in length more than the other, due\r\nto a rise in temperature, and this same piece will decrease in\r\nlength more than the other when subjected to a decrease in\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nIf one end of this combined piece be rigidly clamped to a support,\r\nas shown in Fig. 1, and the combination then have its temperature\r\nchanged, the free end will move to the right or left of its\r\noriginal position, depending upon which of the pieces changes in\r\nlength the more. If there is a rise in temperature and the\r\nright-hand piece B increases in length faster than the left-hand\r\npiece A, the free end of the combined piece win move to the left\r\nof its original position. If, on the other hand, there is a\r\ndecrease in temperature, the right-hand piece will decrease in\r\nlength more than the left-hand piece, and the upper or free end\r\nwill move to the right of its original position.\r\n\r\nSuch a combination of two metals constitutes a simple thermostat.\r\nIf the movement of the free end of the combination be made to\r\nactuate a needle moving over a properly calibrated scale we have a\r\nsimple form of thermometer. If two electrical contacts, CC, be\r\nmounted on the right and left-hand sides of the upper end of the\r\ncombined piece, as shown in Fig. 1, we have a thermostat that may\r\nbe used in closing an electrical circuit when the temperature of\r\nthe room in which it is placed rises or falls a certain value.\r\nThese contacts should be so arranged that they can be moved toward\r\nor away from the combined piece independently. By adjusting the\r\nposition of these contacts, the electrical circuit will be closed\r\nwhen the temperature of the thermostat has reached an\r\nexperimentally predetermined value.\r\n\r\nThe following description is that of a thermostat, constructed by\r\nthe author of this article, which gave very satisfactory results.\r\nFirst obtain a piece of steel, 6 in. long, 5/8 in. wide and 2/100\r\nin. thick, and a piece of brass, 6 in. long, 5/8 in. wide and\r\n3/100 in. thick. Clean one side of each of these pieces and tin\r\nthem well with solder. Place the two tinned surfaces just treated\r\nin contact with each other and heat them until the solder on their\r\nsurfaces melts and then allow them to cool. A better way would be\r\nto clamp the two thin pieces between two heavy metal pieces, and\r\nthen heat the whole to such a temperature that the solder will\r\nmelt, and then allow it to cool. This last method will give more\r\nsatisfactory results than would be obtained if no clamps are used,\r\nas the thin metal pieces are liable to bend\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Support for Couple, and Needle-Mounting Strip]\r\n\r\nout of shape when they are heated, and as a result they will not\r\nbe in contact with each other over their entire surfaces. After\r\nthese pieces have been soldered together forming one piece, which\r\nwe shall for convenience speak of as the couple, two small holes\r\nshould be drilled in one end to be used in mounting it, and a\r\nnotch cut in the other end, as shown in Fig. 2.\r\n\r\nCut from some thin sheet brass, about 2/100 in. in thickness, two\r\npieces, 1/4 in. wide and 1/2 in. long. Bend these pieces of brass\r\nover a piece of hatpin wire, thus forming two V-shaped pieces. Cut\r\noff a piece of the hatpin, 5/8 in. long, and fasten it across the\r\nnotched end of the couple by means of the U-shaped piece of brass,\r\nwhich should be soldered in place as shown in Fig. 3. All\r\nsuperfluous solder should then be cleaned from the couple and the\r\nsteel pin. Now bend the couple so as to form a perfect half\r\ncircle, the brass being on the inside.\r\n\r\nThe base upon which this couple is to be mounted should be made as\r\nfollows: Obtain a piece of brass, 7 in. long, 3/4 in. wide, and\r\n1/4 in. thick. In this piece drill holes, as indicated in Fig. 4,\r\nexcept A, which will be drilled later. Tap the holes B, C and D\r\nfor 1/8-in. machine screws.\r\n\r\nCut from some 1/8-in. sheet brass a piece, 1-7/8 in. long and 3/4\r\nin. wide, to be used as a support for the couple. In one end of\r\nthis piece drill two small holes, as indicated in Fig. 5, and tap\r\nthem for 3/16-in. machine screws. In the opposite end cut a slot,\r\nwhose dimensions correspond to those given in Fig. 5. Now bend the\r\npiece, at the dotted line in Fig. 5, into the form shown in Fig.\r\n6, making sure that the dimension given is correct. This piece can\r\nnow be mounted upon the piece shown in Fig. 4, by means of two\r\nbrass machine screws placed in the holes B. The slot in the\r\nsupport for the couple will permit its being moved along the\r\nmounting strip, the purpose of which will be shown later.\r\n\r\nNext cut another piece of 1/8-in. brass, 2-3/4 in. long and 5/8\r\nin. wide. In this piece drill two 1/8-in. holes, as indicated in\r\nFig. 7, and then bend it at the dotted lines into the form shown\r\nin Fig. 8. Mount this strip upon the main mounting strip by means\r\nof two brass machine screws placed in the holes C, so that the\r\nupper part is over the center-punch mark for the hole A in the\r\nmain mounting strip.\r\n\r\nYou are now ready to drill the hole A, which should be done as\r\nfollows: Remove the piece you last mounted and then clamp the main\r\nmounting strip in the drill press so that the center-punch mark\r\nfor the hole A is directly under the point of the drill. Then\r\nremount the piece you just removed, without disturbing the piece\r\nyou clamped in the drill press, and drill a small hole through\r\nboth pieces. This hole should be about 3/64 in. in diameter. After\r\nthis small hole has been drilled through both pieces, a\r\ncountersink should be placed in the drill chuck and the hole in\r\nthe upper piece countersunk to a depth equal to half the thickness\r\nof the metal in which it is drilled. Unclamp the pieces from the\r\ndrill press, turn them over, and countersink the small hole in\r\nwhat was originally the lower piece. The object of countersinking\r\nthese holes is to reduce the bearing surface of a small shaft that\r\nis to be supported in the holes and must be as free from friction\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\nWe may now construct the needle, or moving portion of the\r\nthermostat, which should be done as follows: The shaft that is to\r\ncarry the moving system must be made from a piece of steel rod,\r\nabout 3/32 in. in diameter. Its dimensions should correspond to\r\nthose given in Fig. 9. Considerable care should be used in turning\r\nthis shaft down, to make sure that it fits perfectly in the small\r\nholes in the supporting pieces. The shaft should turn freely, but\r\nit must not be loose in the holes, nor should it have but a very\r\nsmall end play.\r\n\r\nCut from some 1/32-in. sheet brass a piece whose dimensions\r\ncorrespond to those given in Fig. 10. Drill a 1/8-in. hole, A, in\r\nthis piece, and cut a slot, B, from one side of the piece into\r\nthis hole, and a second slot, C, along the center of the piece as\r\nindicated in the figure. Considerable care should be exercised in\r\ncutting the slot C, so that its breadth is exactly equal to the\r\ndiameter of the piece of steel wire fastened on the end of the\r\ncouple. Also make sure to get the sides of this slot perfectly\r\nsmooth. Cut from some 1/8-in. brass a disk having a diameter of\r\n1/2 in., and solder it to the end of the needle. The dotted line\r\nin Fig. 10 indicates the proper position of the disk. Now drill a\r\nhole, D, through the disk and needle, of such a diameter that\r\nconsiderable force must be applied to the steel shaft you have\r\nalready made, in order to force it through the hole. Force the\r\nshaft\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Shaft for Needle and Needle]\r\n\r\nthrough this hole until the needle is exactly in the center of the\r\nshaft.\r\n\r\nThe parts of the thermostat thus far made can now be assembled.\r\nPlace the steel shaft in its bearings and see that it turns\r\nperfectly free. Then place the steel pin, on the end of the\r\ncouple, in the slot C, and fasten the\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wiring Diagram for One and Two Bells]\r\n\r\nother end of the couple, by means of two machine screws, to the\r\nsupport made for the couple. Increase or decrease the temperature\r\nof the thermostat and note the results. If everything is working\r\nall right, the end of the needle should move when the temperature\r\nof the thermostat is changed. The amount the end of the needle\r\nmoves can be easily changed by moving the support or the couple\r\ntoward or away from the shaft supporting the needle, which changes\r\nthe position of the steel pin in the slot C. The nearer the steel\r\npin is to the shaft supporting the needle, the greater the\r\nmovement of the end of the needle due to a given change in\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nA small piece of white cardboard can be mounted directly under the\r\nend of the needle by means of small brass strips, that in turn can\r\nbe attached to the lower ends of the main mounting holes D, Fig.\r\n4. A scale can be marked on this piece of cardboard by noting the\r\nposition of the needle corresponding to different temperatures as\r\ndetermined by a thermometer. When this scale has been completed,\r\nyou can use the thermostat as a thermometer.\r\n\r\nTwo contacts may be mounted, one on each side of the needle, in a\r\nmanner similar to the method suggested for mounting the cardboard.\r\nThese contacts should be so constructed that the end of the needle\r\nwill slide over them with little friction, and so that their\r\nposition with respect to the end of the needle may be easily\r\nchanged.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Assembled Thermostat]\r\n\r\nBoth contacts must be insulated from the remainder of the\r\nthermostat, and may or may not be connected together, depending on\r\nhow the thermostat is to be used.\r\n\r\nIt would be advisable, if possible, to have the part of the needle\r\nthat touches the contact points, as well as these points, of\r\nplatinum, as the arc that is likely to be formed will not destroy\r\nthe platinum as easily as it will the brass. A small wooden\r\ncontaining case can now be made and the thermostat is complete.\r\nThere should be a large number of holes drilled in the sides, ends\r\nand back of the case so that the air inside may be always of the\r\nsame temperature as the outside air.\r\n\r\nIn adjusting, testing, or calibrating your thermostat, make sure\r\nthat it is in the same position that it will be in when in use.\r\n\r\nThe connections of the thermostat for ringing one bell when the\r\ntemperature rises or falls to a certain value, are shown in Fig.\r\n11. The connections of the thermostat for ringing one bell when\r\nthe temperature rises to a certain value and another bell when the\r\ntemperature falls to a certain value, are shown in Fig. 12. The\r\ncomplete thermostat is shown in Fig. 13.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** A Tailless Kite [458]\r\n\r\nThe frame of a 3-ft. kite is made of two sticks, each 3 ft. long.\r\nThese are tied together so that the cross stick will be at a\r\ndistance of 15 per cent of the full length of the upright stick,\r\nfrom its end, or in this case 5.4 in. The sticks may be made of\r\nstraight grained pine, 3/8 in. square, for small kites, and larger\r\nhardwood sticks, for larger kites.\r\n\r\nThe cross stick is bent into a bow\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plan and Dimensions for Kite]\r\n\r\nby tying a strong cord across from end to end.

Connect all four ends or points with a cord, being careful\r\nnot to pull the bend of the cross stick down, but seeing that it\r\nremains straight across the kite. When this is done the frame is\r\nready for the cover.\r\n\r\nThe cover will require 2-1/2 sheets of tissue paper, 20 by 30 in.,\r\nwhich should be pasted together as the sketch indicates. Cut out\r\nthe paper, allowing 2 in. margin for lapping over the cord on the\r\nframe. Place the frame on the cover with the convex side toward\r\nthe paper and paste the margin over the cord, allowing the paper\r\nto bag a little to form pockets for the air to lift the kite. The\r\ncorners should be reinforced with circular pieces of paper pasted\r\nover the ends of the sticks.\r\n\r\nThe flying cord is attached to the points A and B of the frame.\r\nThere is no cross cord. The kite will fly at right angles to the\r\nflying cord. It is easily started flying from the ground by laying\r\nit with the head toward the operator and pulling it up into the\r\nwind.\r\n--Contributed by Chas. B. Damik, Cooperstown, N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n** The Levitation - A Modern Stage Trick [459]\r\n\r\nThis illusion has mystified thousands of the theater-going public,\r\nin fact, it has been the "piece de resistance" of many illusion\r\nacts. The ordinary method of procedure is as follows: The person\r\nwho is to be suspended in the air, apparently with no\r\nsupport--usually a lady--is first put in a hypnotic (?) sleep. She\r\nis placed on a couch in the middle of the stage, and in most cases\r\nthe spotlight is brought into play. The performer then takes a\r\nposition close to the couch and with dramatic\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Raising the Subject in Midair]\r\n\r\neffect makes a few hypnotic passes over the subject. She then\r\nslowly rises from the couch until she has attained a height\r\nvarying from 4 to 5 ft. above the stage, as shown in Fig. 1. The\r\ncouch is then taken a way and a hoop is passed over the floating\r\nlady. The performer now causes the lady to float back to the couch\r\nor board that she may have been resting on, after which the\r\nso-called hypnotic spell is withdrawn.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the claims that the illusion owes its origin to Hindoo\r\nmagic, it is nothing more nor less than a clever mechanical\r\ncontrivance, the construction of which will be readily understood\r\nby a glance at the accompanying illustrations.\r\n\r\nThe bottom of the couch, if one is used, contains a cradle-like\r\narrangement which fits the recumbent form of the lady and is\r\nconnected to a heavy sheet of plate glass by means of a rod, D,\r\nFig. 2, attached to one end, and running parallel to the side of\r\nthe cradle. When the glass is lifted, the body of the subject is\r\nalso raised, seemingly at the will of the performer. This is\r\naccomplished by the aid of an assistant beneath the stage floor.\r\nThe plate of glass, E, Fig. 3, passes perpendicularly through the\r\nstage down to a double block and tackle. The end of the cable is\r\nattached to a drum or windlass and the plate glass held steady\r\nwith guides at the sides of the slot in the stage floor, through\r\nwhich it passes. The winding up of the cable naturally forces the\r\nplate glass and cradle up, causing the lady to rise.\r\n\r\nSome illusionists place the lady on a board on two ordinary\r\ntrestles and cause the board to rise with the lady\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Direction the Hoop Takes In Passing over the Board]\r\n\r\non it, as shown in the illustration, thus obviating the use of\r\nheavy paraphernalia as in the cradle attachment. The cradle\r\nattachment is also generally accompanied by a 2-in. iron bar, used\r\nin the place of the plate glass, the performer or operator\r\nstanding at the rear of the couch to conceal the bar as it comes\r\nfrom beneath the stage. However, the method illustrated is the one\r\ngenerally used.\r\n\r\nThe solid hoop is passed over the body in the following manner:\r\nStart at the end, B, Fig. 2, passing the hoop as far as C with the\r\nhoop on the outside of the back horizontal rod. The side of the\r\nhoop toward the audience is then turned and swung clear around\r\nover the feet at A and entered between the rod and board on which\r\nthe lady rests. The hoop is then carried as far as it will go back\r\ntoward the end B. Then the side nearest the operator is passed\r\nover the head of the body apparently the second time and passed\r\noff free at the feet. Thus to the closest observer the impression\r\nis given that the hoop has encircled the lady twice. The\r\nillustrations give in detail the working of the illusion above the\r\nstage floor. No set rule is used for the tackle and drum below the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\nA\r\nAccelerometer, Simple  93\r\nAcid Burns, Treating  126\r\nAcetylene Gas Generator, Homemade  57\r\nAcetylene Lamp, Lighting  401\r\nAerating Water in a Small Tank  241\r\nAeroplane, Paper, How to Make  329\r\nAeroplanes, Model, Equilibrator for  11\r\nAlarm, Burglar, How to Make  368\r\nAlarm, Callers\' Approach   87\r\nAlarm Clock Chicken Feeder  79\r\nAlarm Clock to Pull Up Furnace Draft  107\r\nAlarm, Electric  94\r\nAlarm, Electric, Door Bell and  114\r\nAlarm, Electric Fire, How to Make  430\r\nAlarm, Electric, That Rings Bell and Turns On Light  337\r\nAlarm, Electric Time  433\r\nAlarm, Fire  47, 359\r\nAluminum Polish  428\r\nAluminum, Satin Finish on  198\r\nAluminum Wire, Insulating  306\r\nAmmeter, How to Make  49, 203\r\nAmusement-Boys Representing the Centaur  173\r\nAmusement Device--Merry-Go-Round Thriller  209\r\nAmusement Device--Merry-Go-Round, To Build  359\r\nAmusement Device--Teeter Board.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
