I have endeavoured to show that Country Walks may be full\r\nof interest and instruction to all who care to make good use of their\r\neyes. If I have failed, the fault rests with me for the way in which I\r\nhave treated the subject. I am aware that I have occasionally used\r\nwords and phrases which may puzzle young brains, but I hope that\r\nnearly all will be intelligible to boys and girls of nine or ten years\r\nold, with a little explanation from parents or teachers.\r\n\r\nThe chief, if not the sole merit of this little book consists in the\r\nillustrations which adorn it; and I must express my sincere gratitude\r\nto Mr. Gould, the eminent ornithologist, for his kind permission to\r\ncopy some of the magnificent drawings in his work on \'The Birds of\r\nGreat Britain.\' To Mr. R. S. Chattock, of Solihull, I am also deeply\r\nindebted, for the pains he has taken in reproducing, on a reduced\r\nscale, Mr. Gould\'s drawings, and for the drawings of the sticklebacks\r\nand the frontispiece. My generous friend and neighbour, Mr. Eyton, of\r\nEyton, has furnished another instance of his numerous acts of\r\nkindness, in allowing me the use of Mr. Gould\'s work and of various\r\nwoodcuts. To two lady friends I also express my best thanks; and last,\r\nthough not least, to the publishers, Messrs. Groombridge, for the care\r\nthey have taken to present the volume to the public in a very\r\nattractive form.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                                                  PAGE\r\n\r\nWALK I.--APRIL                                                       1\r\n\r\nOn the Moors--Swallows--Water-voles--Peewits--Marsh\r\nMarigold--Water-primrose--Moles--Herons--Kingfishers--\r\nMoschatelle--Water-scorpion.\r\n\r\nWALK II.--APRIL                                                     17\r\n\r\nOphrydium--Reed Sparrow--Whirligig Beetles--Fresh-water\r\nMussels--Zebra Mussel--Titmice--Thrushes cracking\r\nSnail-shells--Dabbling in a Pond--Dyticus, or Great\r\nWater-beetle--Corethra Larva--Weasels.\r\n\r\nWALK III.--MAY                                                      36\r\n\r\nSearching for Sticklebacks\' Nests--Nest-making Fish--Snail\r\nLeeches--Other Leeches--Cuckoo Flowers--Blue\r\nSpeedwell--Stitchwort--Tadpoles--Frogs--Frog and Cat.\r\n\r\nWALK IV.--MAY                                                       50\r\n\r\nThe Melicerta or Tubicolous Wheel-animalcule--Water-crowfoot\r\nor Buttercup--Sedge-warbler--Reed-warbler\'s\r\nNest--Cuckoos--Horsetail--Hydr\xc3\xa6.\r\n\r\nWALK V.--MAY                                                        69\r\n\r\nDrive to Shawbury--Trout Fishing--Parasite on Trout--Curious habit\r\nof a Two-winged Fly--Ephemer\xc3\xa6, or May-flies--Willy hooking out\r\nDace--Another fish Parasite--Globe Flower--Dragon-flies--Quotation\r\nfrom Thomson\'s \'Seasons.\'\r\n\r\nWALK VI.--JUNE                                                      84\r\n\r\nIn the Fields--St. George\'s Mushroom--Tree-creepers--A handful\r\nof Grasses--Nettles and Dead Nettles--Butterfly--Larv\xc3\xa6 feeding\r\non Nettle Leaves--Fresh-water Polyzoa--Eggs of Newts--Development\r\nof Newts--Donacia Beetles--Planarian Worms.\r\n\r\n\r\nWALK VII.--JUNE                                                    103\r\n\r\nHedgehog and young ones--Hedgehogs, injurious or not?--On the\r\nMoors again--Great Tomtit--Shrikes or Butcher Birds--Lady-bird\r\nBeetles--Swifts--Coots--Water-hens--Grebes--Convolvulus.\r\n\r\n\r\nWALK VIII.--JULY                                                   119\r\n\r\nFrog\'s Spawn Alga--Other Fresh-water Alg\xc3\xa6--Hawks--Kestrel--Sparrow\r\nHawk--Buzzard--Shrew-mouse, superstitions about--Spiders\' Nests\r\nand Webs--Spiders\' Fangs--Spiders\' Feet.\r\n\r\n\r\nWALK IX.--JULY                                                     133\r\n\r\nIn the Fields again--Scarlet Pimpernel--Goat\'s Beard--Caddis Worms\r\nand Flies--Forget-me-not--Goldfinches--Cruelty of country lads to\r\nyoung birds--Grasshoppers--Crickets--Pike, voracity and size of.\r\n\r\n\r\nWALK X.--OCTOBER                                                   145\r\n\r\nIn the Woods at the foot of the Wrekin--A hunt for Fungi--Fly\r\nAgarics--Victims nailed to a tree--Gamekeepers--Squirrels--Rare\r\nFungi--Woodcocks--Ring-marks on fallen timber--Conclusion.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNTRY WALKS OF A NATURALIST\r\n\r\nWITH\r\n\r\nHIS CHILDREN.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWALK I.\r\n\r\nAPRIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe could not have a more pleasant day, children, for a ramble in the\r\nfields than to-day. It is warm and bright, and the birds are singing\r\nmerrily, thoroughly enjoying the sunshine; the little lambs are\r\nfrisking about, and running races with each other. Put away lessons\r\nthen, and we will have a holiday. "Oh," said Willy, "it will be so\r\npleasant, and I will take one or two bottles, and my gauze net,\r\nbecause we are sure to find something interesting to bring home. Where\r\nshall we go?" "I do not think it much matters where, for there is\r\nalways much to observe and to admire wherever we stroll in the\r\ncountry." "Let us go on the moors, then," said Jack, "for you know,\r\npapa, a little boy in the village told me the other day he had found a\r\npeewit\'s nest with four eggs in, and I should like to try and find\r\none myself." Well, here we are, then; we shall have to jump over a\r\ndrain or two in our ramble, and as the banks are soft it will be\r\nnecessary to take great care, or we may tumble in. Ah! do you see,\r\nthere are two sand-martins, the first I have seen this year. See how\r\nfast they fly, now sailing high up in the air, now skimming quite\r\nclose to the ground. I have not seen any swallows or house-martins\r\nyet, but no doubt they will make their appearance in a few days.\r\n"Where do they come from, papa," asked May, "because we never see\r\nthese birds in the winter? You often say, when the spring comes we\r\nshall see the swallows, and then they go away again towards the end of\r\nsummer." Let us sit down on this clump of wood, and I will tell you\r\nabout the swallows.\r\n\r\nWe have in this country four different species of the swallow family\r\nwhich visit us every year; they come to us from Africa: these are the\r\nsand-martin, two specimens of which we have just seen, the swallow,\r\nthe house-martin, and the swift. A very little attention will enable\r\nyou to distinguish these different kinds. The sand-martin is the\r\nsmallest of the family; as the birds fly by us you notice that the\r\nback part is brown, or mouse colour; the under part white. The back of\r\nthe house-martin is of a glossy black or bluish-black colour; it is\r\nwhite underneath; while the swallow, which is larger than the other\r\ntwo, has a glossy back, like the house-martin; but underneath it is\r\nmore or less tinged with buff; and see, as I speak here is one flying\r\npast us. To-day is the 12th of April, about the time the swallow\r\ngenerally comes to this country. Now you see clearly enough its\r\ncolour, and you will notice, too, a very marked difference in the form\r\nof its tail; see how much forked it is, much more so than the tail of\r\nthe martin. This forked appearance is produced by the two outer tail\r\nfeathers, which are much longer than the rest. Now I hope you will\r\ntake notice of these differences, and call things by their right\r\nnames, instead of jumbling them all up together under the name of\r\nswallow. I have not spoken of the swift, which does not visit this\r\ncountry till May; it is the largest of the swallow family, and has the\r\nwhole of its body, both above and beneath, of a blackish-brown colour,\r\nexcept a small patch of dirty white under the chin.\r\n\r\n"But, papa," said Jack, "do all these four kinds of swallows come from\r\nAfrica? It is very curious to know how they can find their way\r\nbackwards and forwards from Africa to this country, and how they come\r\nback to the very spots they visited the year before?" Indeed, it is a\r\nvery curious thing; nevertheless experiments have been made to show\r\nthat these birds return every year to the same localities.\r\n\r\nMany years ago Dr. Jenner procured several swifts from a farmhouse in\r\nGloucestershire, and marked them by cutting off two claws from the\r\nfoot of twelve of them. Next year their hiding places were examined in\r\nthe evening, when the birds had gone to roost, when Dr. Jenner found\r\nmany of the birds he had marked by cutting off the two claws. For two\r\nor three consecutive years he examined their nesting places, and\r\nalways found some of his marked birds. At the end of seven years a cat\r\nbrought a swift into the farmer\'s kitchen, and this was one of those\r\nwhich Dr. Jenner had marked. Now, Willy, I will ask you a question in\r\ngeography. The swallow family visits this country from Africa. What\r\nsea, then, must the birds fly across? "The Mediterranean, papa." Quite\r\nright; and now can you tell me the narrowest part of the Mediterranean\r\nSea? "The Straits of Gibraltar." Right again; and there the passage is\r\nabout five miles wide; and at Gibraltar swallows, swifts, and martins\r\nare often seen as well as several other bird-visitors of this country.\r\nPeople on board ship have seen swallows a long way from land passing\r\nbetween Europe and Africa. Sometimes the poor birds are so tired from\r\ntheir flight that they are obliged to rest on the masts, yards, and\r\nrigging of the vessels. This often happens when the weather is hazy.\r\nHolloa, Jack, what is that splash in the water about six yards off?\r\nKeep quiet, and we shall see what it was. Ah! it is one of my friends,\r\nthe water-voles; I see the rogue, with his large yellow teeth and\r\nblack eyes. Do you see? He is on the other side of the drain, nibbling\r\naway at something. People generally call him a water-rat, but he is no\r\nrelation at all to a rat, nor is he an injurious creature like it.\r\n"Well, but papa," said Willy, "the lads in the village always kill\r\nthese water-rats, as they call them, whenever they can. I suppose they\r\ntake them for common rats. Do you say they do no harm?" Very little,\r\nwater-voles will not eat young chickens and ducklings; nor do they\r\nfind their way into stacks and consume the corn; their food is\r\nentirely confined to vegetables, such as the roots and stems of\r\nwater-weeds. I feel, however, pretty sure that the water-vole is fond\r\nof beans, and will occasionally do some mischief where a field of\r\nnewly-sown beans adjoins the river or stream, in the banks of which\r\nthese animals form their holes. I will clap my hands, and off our\r\nlittle friend with his dusky coat starts, diving under the water,\r\nwhence when he comes out he will probably escape into a hole on the\r\nbank. Some day I will show you the skulls of a water-vole and a rat,\r\nand you will see there is a great difference in the form and\r\narrangement of the teeth, and that the first-named animal is not, as I\r\nsaid before, related to the rat. The water-vole is really a relative\r\nof that interesting creature you have often read of--I mean the\r\nbeaver. "Well, papa," said Jack, "I am tired of sitting here, let us\r\nnow go and hunt for peewit\'s eggs." All right, Jack, and if you find\r\nany you shall each have one for your breakfast in the morning. When\r\nhard-boiled and cold, a peewit\'s egg is a very delicious thing, though\r\nI think the peewits are such valuable birds, and do so much good, that\r\nI should not like to take many of their eggs. We had better separate\r\nfrom each other, so as to have a better chance of finding a nest. Soon\r\nwe hear a shout from Willy, whose sharp eyes had discovered a nest\r\nwith four eggs in it; so off we all scamper to him. See how the old\r\nbird screams and flaps, and how near she comes to us; she knows we\r\nhave found her eggs, and wishes to lure us away from the spot; so she\r\npretends she has been wounded, and tries to make us follow after her.\r\nNow, Jack, run and catch her. Hah! Hah! There they go. I will back the\r\npeewit against the boy. So you have given up the chase, have you?\r\nWell, rest again, and take breath. The peewit, as you saw, makes\r\nscarcely any nest, merely a hollow in the ground, with, perhaps, a few\r\ndried grasses. The peculiar instinct of the peewit in misleading\r\npeople as to the whereabouts of its eggs, or young ones, is very\r\ncurious.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAPWING.]\r\n\r\nA very observant naturalist says, "As soon as any one appears in the\r\nfields where the nest is, the bird runs quietly and rapidly in a\r\nstooping posture to some distance from it, and then rises with loud\r\ncries and appearance of alarm, as if her nest was immediately below\r\nthe spot she rose from. When the young ones are hatched, too, the\r\nplace to look for them is, _not_ where the parent birds are screaming\r\nand fluttering about, but at some little distance from it. As soon as\r\nyou actually come to the spot where their young are, the old birds\r\nalight on the ground a hundred yards or so from you, watching your\r\nmovements. If, however, you pick up one of the young ones, both male\r\nand female immediately throw off all disguise, and come wheeling and\r\nscreaming around your head, as if about to fly in your face." Peewits\r\nare certainly bold birds when their young ones are in danger. Mr.\r\nCharles St. John says he has often seen the hooded crows hunting the\r\nfields frequented by the peewits, as regularly as a pointer, flying a\r\nfew yards above the ground, and searching for the eggs. The cunning\r\ncrow always selects the time when the old birds are away on the shore.\r\nAs soon as he is perceived, however, the peewits all combine in\r\nchasing him away. We are told that they will also attack any bird of\r\nprey that ventures near their breeding ground; they are quarrelsome,\r\ntoo, and the cock birds will fight with each other should they come\r\ninto too close quarters. A cock bird one day attacked a wounded male\r\nbird which came near his nest; the pugnacious little fellow ran up to\r\nthe intruder, and taking advantage of his weakness, jumped on him, and\r\npecking at his head, dragged him along the ground as fiercely as a\r\ngame cock. This was witnessed by Mr. St. John.[A] "I have often heard\r\npeewits uttering their peculiar noise," said Willy, "quite late at\r\nnight. What do they feed on? I should so much like to have a tame\r\nyoung one." The food of the peewits consists of insects, worms,\r\nsnails, slugs, the larv\xc3\xa6 of various insects; I am certain they do much\r\ngood to the farmer by destroying numerous insect-pests. "Oh, papa,"\r\nexclaimed May, "do come here, what a splendid cluster of bright golden\r\nflowers is growing on the side of the drain." Yes, indeed it is a\r\nbeautiful cluster; it is the marsh-marigold, and looks like a gigantic\r\nbuttercup; it is sometimes in flower as early as March, and continues\r\nto blossom for three months or more. Country people often call it the\r\nmay-flower, as being one of the flowers once used for may-garlands. I\r\ndare say you have sometimes seen wreaths hanging on cottage doors.\r\nSome people have invented what I think very ugly names for this showy\r\nplant, such as horse-blob, water-blob.\r\n\r\n    "Beneath the shelving bank\'s retreat\r\n    The horseblob swells its golden ball."\r\n\r\nI have somewhere read that the young buds are sometimes pickled and\r\nused instead of capers, but I do not think I should like to try them.\r\n"And what," asked May, "are those bright green feathery tufts under\r\nthe water? they are very pretty, but they do not bear any flowers."\r\nNo, there are no flowers at present, but in about a month\'s time you\r\nwill see plenty. Out of the middle of the feathery tuft there grows a\r\nsingle tall stem with whorls of four, five, or six pale purple flowers\r\noccurring at intervals. Its English name is water-violet,--not a\r\nfitting name for it, because this plant is not at all related to the\r\nviolet tribe, but is one of the primrose family; so we should more\r\ncorrectly call it water-primrose. Its Latin name is _Hottonia\r\npalustris_; it is called Hottonia in honour of a German botanist,\r\nProfessor Hotton, of Leyden. Willy will tell us that the word\r\n_palustris_ means "marshy," in allusion to the places where the water\r\nprimrose is found growing. It is a very common plant in the ditches on\r\nthe moors here, and I will take care to show you its pretty tall stem\r\nwhen the flowers appear. While I was talking to May about the water\r\nprimrose, Jack espied a sulphur-coloured butterfly, and off he set in\r\nfull chase; he did not, however, succeed in capturing it, for his foot\r\ntripped over a molehill and down he tumbled--the beautiful sulphur\r\nbutterfly having fled across a wide ditch and escaped. Not far from\r\nwhere he fell there was a thorn bush and a number of unfortunate moles\r\ngibbeted thereon: some had been killed quite recently, so I took three\r\nor four from the thorn with the intention of taking them home and\r\nexamining their stomachs to see what they had eaten. In the meantime,\r\ndown we sat on an adjoining bank covered with primroses looking so gay\r\nand smelling so sweet. Willy then wanted to know the history of the\r\nmole; why people generally think it right to kill these animals, and\r\nwhether they really are blind. May, of course, could not resist the\r\ncharm of collecting primroses for mamma. The two boys cared more for\r\nanimals, so I answered their questions about the mole. First of all I\r\npointed out the amazing strength of its feet, its soft and silky fur,\r\nthe form of its body so well adapted for a rapid progress through the\r\nunderground passages it forms. Look, I said, at its soft fur, how it\r\nwill lie in any direction; each delicate hair is inserted in the skin\r\nperpendicularly to its surface, so that the mole can move rapidly\r\neither backwards or forwards with great ease; the fur, lying as\r\nreadily in one direction as another, makes no difficulty to a backward\r\nretreat. If you look closely when I push away the fur with my finger\r\nand breath in the neighbourhood of the eyes, you will see two tiny\r\nblack specs; so we can hardly call the mole a blind animal; but as it\r\nlives for the most part underground its power of vision must be small.\r\nThe fore feet do the work of the spade and potato-fork combined; its\r\nsense of smell is acute, and this, no doubt, aids the animal in the\r\nsearch of its food; the mole\'s sense of hearing is also very good.\r\n"Well, but, papa," exclaimed Jack, "a mole has got no ears, so how can\r\nit hear?" There is no outward appearance of ears, it is true, but\r\nlook: I blow away the fur, and now you see clearly a hole which is the\r\nbeginning of the passage that leads to the internal ear. The ears of\r\nmany animals are very admirably made and fitted for the purpose of\r\nreceiving sounds, but you must not suppose that because some\r\nanimals--as moles, seals, whales, &c.--have no outward appendages,\r\nthey are destitute of ears and the power of hearing. But you must wait\r\ntill you are a little older, and then I will explain to you the matter\r\nmore fully. The little curiously shaped earbones which are found in\r\nall mammalia are found also in the mole; and I have in my drawer at\r\nhome a mole\'s earbones which I dissected from the animal.\r\n\r\nBut here comes, I do think, the mole-catcher himself; let us hear what\r\nhe has to say. "Good morning, Mr. Mole-catcher; have you been setting\r\nany more traps to-day? I suppose those unfortunate fellows gibbeted on\r\nyonder thorn were caught by you." "Well, yeez, sir," he replied, "I\r\nreckons as they were; I have stopped their play, I guess; but there\'s\r\na plaguey lot more on them about, I\'m a thinking." "What harm do you\r\nconsider that moles do?" I asked. "Harm, maister? why, lor\' bless you,\r\nsee them hummocks they throw up all about. The farmers dunna like them\r\nugly heaps, I can assure you." "Probably not; still if they were\r\nspread on the land the soil would be as good as top-dressing. Do you\r\nknow what moles eat?" "Well, sir, I believes they eats worms." "Yes,\r\nthey feed principally on worms, but they also devour wireworms and\r\nother creatures which prey upon the farmer\'s crops. I think moles do\r\nmore good than harm, and I have examined the stomachs of many, and I\r\nam of opinion that it is a mistake to kill them." "Lor\', sir, you be\'s\r\na gemman that has seen the inside of a mole\'s stomach, has you? You\r\nmay be a cliver sort of a mon, but moles be varmint." Thus saying, the\r\nold fellow wished us good morning and left us. "Papa," said Willy, "do\r\nnot moles make very curious places under the ground in which they\r\nreside at times? I think I have somewhere seen pictures of these\r\nencampments." Yes, they do; but I only know of them from description\r\nand figures; the fortress is generally made under a hillock; it\r\nconsists of many galleries connected with each other, and with a\r\ncentral chamber. You remember a young mole was brought to us last\r\nsummer, and that we put it into a box with plenty of loose earth and\r\nsome worms. We only kept it a day or two. One morning I found it dead.\r\nI suppose it had not enough to eat. The mole has an insatiable\r\nappetite, and, according to the observations of some naturalists, it\r\nwill devour birds. Mr. Bell says that "even the weaker of its own\r\nspecies under particular circumstances are not exempted from this\r\npromiscuous ferocity; for if two moles be placed together in a box\r\nwithout a very plentiful supply of food the weaker certainly falls a\r\nprey to the stronger. No thoroughbred bulldog keeps a firmer hold of\r\nthe object of its attack than the mole. Mr. Jackson, a very\r\nintelligent mole-catcher, says that, when a boy, his hand was so\r\nseverely and firmly laid hold of by one that he was obliged to use his\r\nteeth in order to loosen its hold."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HERON AND YOUNG.]\r\n\r\nWe now proceeded on our ramble, and I espied about one hundred yards\r\noff a heron on the bank of the Strine. He did not see us at first, but\r\nwhen we got a little nearer, off he flew, with his long legs stretched\r\nout behind, and his head bent close to his shoulders. He had evidently\r\nbeen fishing, for we could see the scales of fish on the side of the\r\nbank. Willy asked whether herons built on trees, and Jack wanted to\r\nknow how they managed with their great long legs while sitting on\r\ntheir nests. These birds in the breeding season assemble together and\r\nmake their nests on tall firs or oak trees; sometimes they build on\r\nrocks near the sea coast. It is said, too, that they will occasionally\r\nbuild on the ground. The heron\'s nest is not unlike that of the rook,\r\nonly larger and broader; it is made of sticks and lined with wool and\r\ncoarse grass; the female lays four or five eggs of a green colour, her\r\nlong legs are tucked under her. Rooks and jackdaws sometimes take up\r\ntheir quarters near to a heronry, and do you know they steal their\r\neggs, the rogues, and devour them. Both male and female herons take\r\ngreat care of their little ones and bring them food. Besides fish the\r\nheron will eat frogs, rats, young ducks, and coots. Eels are great\r\ndainties in the opinion of Mr. Heron; and sometimes an eel, after\r\nbeing pierced through the head by the sharp and strong bill of the\r\nheron, manages to wrap himself so tight round the bird\'s neck as to\r\nstop his breathing and cause his death. A good many years ago herons\r\nwere protected by the law; they were considered royal game, and their\r\ncapture by the peregrine falcon was looked upon as very exciting\r\nsport. As we followed the bank of the stream out flew a couple of\r\nkingfishers with straight and rapid flight; we distinctly heard the\r\nshrill note these birds utter; they flew about two hundred yards and\r\nlighted on a rail near the water\'s edge. Let us see if we can get a\r\nlittle nearer to them, I said, and then sit down and see what they\r\nwill do. "Papa," said May, "is not the kingfisher a very beautiful\r\nbird, and the most brightly coloured of all British birds?" Yes, it\r\nis; its splendid colours remind one of the gorgeous plumage of\r\ntropical birds, and we have no other British bird with such brilliant\r\ncolours. There, did you see that? one of the birds darted off the rail\r\ninto the water. I have no doubt he has caught a small fish; and now he\r\nhas lighted on the same rail, and with my pocket telescope I can see\r\nhim throw his head up and swallow some dainty morsel. It is not at all\r\nan uncommon sight to see a kingfisher hover over the water after the\r\nmanner of a kestril-hawk; suddenly it will descend with the greatest\r\nrapidity and again emerge, seldom failing to secure a fish for its\r\ndinner. "Did you ever find a kingfisher\'s nest, papa?" Willy inquired.\r\nYes; some years ago I found one in a hole in a bank; there were four\r\neggs in it, and I had to put my whole arm into the hole before I got\r\nat the nest, which consisted of sand mixed with a great quantity of\r\nvery small fish bones. The eggs are very pretty, having a delicate\r\npink tinge, the shell is thin, and the form of the egg almost round.\r\n"But where," asked Jack, "do the little fish bones of the nest come\r\nfrom?" I think I have told you that many birds--hawks, eagles, owls,\r\nshrikes, &c.--throw up from their crops the indigestible portions of\r\ntheir food. It is not uncommon to find these on the ground in the\r\ncourse of one\'s rambles. Kingfishers possess this power; they throw up\r\nthe undigested fishbones, and curiously enough, as it would appear,\r\nform them into a nest. There is a kingfisher\'s nest in the British\r\nMuseum, which I remember to have seen a few years ago. It has been a\r\ndisputed point whether the parent bird throws the fishbones up at\r\nrandom into the hole where she is going to lay, or whether she forms\r\nthem into a nest. The nest in the British Museum was secured at the\r\nexpense of great patience and pains by the celebrated ornithologist\r\nand splendid draughtsman, Mr. Gould, whose drawings you may one day\r\nsee in the library of the museum at Eyton. This specimen, if I\r\nremember right, was of a flattened form and fully half an inch thick.\r\nIt is said that the kingfisher always selects a hole that has an\r\nupward slope, so that, though heavy rains may cause the water of the\r\nriver bank to rise into the hole, the eggs will be dry. Some\r\nnaturalists have said that kingfishers do not make their own holes,\r\nbut use those already made by other animals. Mr. Gould, however, is of\r\nopinion that kingfishers drill their own holes. The tunnels always\r\nslope upwards, as I said; at the further end of the tunnel is an\r\noven-like chamber where the nest is made. The fish-bone nest is\r\nthought by Mr. Gould to be really a nest, and intended to keep the\r\neggs off the damp ground. However, there is difference of opinion on\r\nthis point, and I reserve my own. We will see if we cannot find a\r\nkingfisher\'s nest some time this summer. Now, May, what little plant\r\nhave you got hold of? "Indeed I don\'t know, papa, but it is a very\r\ncurious little plant; I gathered it at the bottom of that hedge bank."\r\nAh, I know it well, and a little favorite it is too; it is the\r\nmoschatell. You see it is about five inches high, with pale green\r\nflowers and leaves; the flowers are arranged in heads of five each,\r\nnamely, four on the side, and one on the top; it has a delicate\r\nmusk-like odour, very pleasant and refreshing. Take a few specimens\r\nhome and put them in water with your primroses. Mamma, I know, is very\r\nfond of the pretty little moschatell.\r\n\r\n"Oh, papa," exclaimed Willy, "look at the bottom of this drain; what\r\nis that strange-looking insect crawling slowly about at the bottom?" I\r\nsee; it is a water-scorpion, a very common insect in these drains on\r\nthe moors,--indeed, it is common everywhere; let us catch him and take\r\nhim home for examination. He is a queer-looking creature, with a small\r\nhead and pointed beak; his forearms are something like lobster\'s\r\nclaws; his prevailing colour blackish-brown, like the mud upon which\r\nhe crawls; his body is very flat, and ends in two long stick-like\r\nprojections; underneath these horny covers of the creature may be seen\r\nhis two wings. He is an aquatic murderer; inserting that pointed beak\r\ninto the body of some other insect, and holding his victim in his\r\nlobster-like forearms--oh! fatal embrace--he sucks out the juices of\r\nthe struggling prey. Kirby and Spence say that some of the tribe of\r\ninsects to which the water-scorpion belongs are so savage that they\r\nseem to love destruction for its own sake. A water-scorpion which was\r\nput into a basin of water with several young tadpoles killed them all\r\nwithout attempting to eat one. The tail projections, I ought to tell\r\nyou, are connected with the insect\'s breathing; they are protruded out\r\nof the water and conduct the air to the spiracles at the end of the\r\nbody, about which I must tell you more at another time. The eggs of\r\nthe water-scorpion I have frequently found; they are of an oval form,\r\nwith seven long hair-like projections at one end. But it is time to go\r\nhome, our walk to-day is over; let us look forward to another holiday\r\nand another country ramble.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: \'Wild Sports of the Highlands,\' p. 136.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWALK II.\r\n\r\nAPRIL\r\n\r\n\r\nWe will walk to-day along the side of the canal bank as far as the\r\naqueduct, then take the Duke\'s Drive and home by Lubstree Park; we\r\nshall find lots to see and to admire in the course of our ramble. We\r\nnotice plenty of those beautiful balls of green jelly (_Ophrydium\r\nversatile_) in the clear water of the canal which, you know, we see\r\nevery spring. These balls vary in size from that of a pea to that of\r\nJack\'s fist; they are, you see, generally attached to some water-weed,\r\nand consist of myriads of very minute creatures called _infusoria_,\r\nwhich are imbedded in a mass of whitish jelly; these animals can\r\ndetach themselves from the jelly and swim freely about; of course it\r\nrequires a microscope to see the tiny green animalcules. If we examine\r\na single specimen under a high power of the microscope we shall see\r\nits shape, which, when fully extended, is long and cylindrical, having\r\nat one end a mouth surrounded, as is usually the case in the\r\n_infusoria_, by a circle of very fine hairs, or _cilia_, as they are\r\ncalled, from the Latin word _cilium_ an eyelash; the mouth opens into\r\na long narrow channel; the creature\'s throat, which leads to its\r\nstomach; towards the opposite extremity the animal tapers, till it\r\nends in an extremely long fine hair-like tail which is fixed in the\r\njelly-like ball; when the little creature prefers to swim freely about\r\nin the water it leaves its tail behind it, unlike, in this respect, to\r\nlittle Bo-peep\'s sheep! These balls were once supposed to belong to\r\nthe vegetable kingdom, but there is no doubt about their animal\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n"Oh! papa, what is that bird with a black head that flew from the side\r\nof the canal to the hedge?" said Willy. "There, don\'t you see it?"\r\nYes! I see, my boy, it is the black-headed Bunting or Reed Sparrow,\r\ncommon on the sides of rivers, canals, and ponds. The specimen you see\r\non the hedge is a male bird, the females are a little smaller and have\r\nnot black heads. See how beautifully contrasted are the deep-black\r\nhead and white collar on the neck. In the spring and summer these\r\nbirds may be frequently seen, male and female together; in winter they\r\nassociate with others of the finch tribe, forming large flocks. The\r\nnest is generally placed on the ground amongst the sedges and coarse\r\ngrass; the eggs, which are four or five in number, are laid in May\r\nand, I believe, a second brood sometimes is produced in July. The\r\nnests of the Reed-bunting are difficult to find, at least, I have\r\nseldom been successful. You know how cunning the peewit is in trying\r\nto lead people away from its nest or young ones. Well, some observers\r\nhave remarked the same thing in the case of the reed-bunting. One\r\nwriter says, "Walking last spring amongst some rushes growing near a\r\nriver my attention was arrested by observing a black-headed bunting\r\nshuffling through the rushes and trailing along the ground, as if one\r\nof her legs or wings was broken. I followed her to see the result, and\r\nshe, having led me to some considerable distance, took wing, no doubt\r\nmuch rejoiced on return to find her stratagems had been successful in\r\npreserving her young brood." "Ha! ha!" interrupted Jack, "the\r\ngentleman was nicely deceived then." No, not entirely, because he goes\r\non to say he afterwards found the nest, which had five young ones in\r\nit. One thing more I ought to tell you; not to confuse the\r\nreed-bunting with the reed-warbler, a very different bird, which very\r\nprobably we may notice in to-day\'s ramble.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHIRLIGIG BEETLE, MAGNIFIED.]\r\n\r\nWe now had another look into the canal, and saw numerous little\r\nwhirligig beetles, performing their merry-go-rounds on the top of the\r\nwater. With what amazing rapidity they skim along, to be sure! Some\r\ndiving beneath the surface, some resting on a water leaf. If we catch\r\none in our net and examine it more closely we shall see that, in form,\r\nit is like a miniature boat. It seems surprising that these little\r\n"whirligigs," "whirl-wigs," or "shiners," as they are called, should\r\nperform their rounds so closely together, without sometimes coming\r\ninto collision. If you will look ever so long a time you will not see\r\none animated boat run foul of another. Just think of a couple of\r\nhundred skaters on a small piece of ice playing at cros-stick. Oh!\r\nwould they not be constantly knocking one another over?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEAD OF WHIRLIGIG BEETLE, MAGNIFIED.\r\n\r\n_a._ Mouth. _b, c._ Eye.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNow look at Mr. Whirligig\'s eyes, you see each is separated into two\r\nparts by a division; the one is on the upper part of the head and\r\nlooks towards the sky, the other is on the under part of the head and\r\nlooks into the water. Now let us all keep quite still--the whirligigs\r\nrest. Now let us move--just look, they see our motions and off they\r\nstart on their merry-go-rounds. It was with this upper part of the eye\r\nthey saw us; should some sly fish, from below the surface of the\r\nwater, make a rush at one, the beetle sees the enemy with his under\r\neye and avoids him. What have you caught now, Jack? fish him out\r\nwhatever it is. Oh! a fresh-water mussel, and a very fine specimen\r\ntoo; there are plenty of these fellows in the canal all the way from\r\nhere to Newport. "Are they good to eat, papa?" asked Willy. I never\r\ntried one, but, from having often dissected specimens, I should say\r\nthey were as tough as the sole of a boot. I never heard of anyone\r\neating them. These molluscs carry their eggs, myriads in number,\r\nwithin their gills. The young, at the time they are ejected, are very\r\ncurious little animals with triangular shells, and, oddly enough, they\r\nwill fasten upon the fins or tails of fish, on which they will stick\r\nfor some time, but how long I do not know.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRY OF SWAN-MUSSEL, PARASITIC ON A FISH\'S FIN.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRY OF SWAN-MUSSEL, HIGHLY MAGNIFIED.]\r\n\r\nThis particular mollusc is known by the name of swan-mussel; the young\r\nfry are sent into the water in April and May. There is another kind of\r\nfresh-water mussel in rivers and streams, called the pearl-mussel,\r\npearls being occasionally found in them. I had one of these pearls\r\nonce given me by a lad, taken from a river in the Isle of Man. I took\r\nit to a jeweller, in Liverpool, who valued it at a guinea. Your uncle\r\nArthur, to whom I gave it, had it set in gold as a pin "I wish," said\r\nMay, who had listened to this part of the story with great attention,\r\n"I wish pearl-mussels would live in the canal, it would be so nice to\r\nget the pearls out of them." Very few mussels are found to contain the\r\npearls; perhaps you might have to open many hundreds before you found\r\na single pearl, and I should not like to cause the death of so many\r\nharmless animals for the sake of a single pearl.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRESH-WATER MUSSEL.]\r\n\r\n"Here is another swan-mussel, and, just look, papa," said Jack, "some\r\nother shells are fastened on it." So there are; it is a lot of the\r\ncurious and pretty little zebra-mussel. How prettily they are marked\r\nwith zig-zag stripes of reddish brown, especially the young specimens.\r\nThe name of mussel is better suited to these molluscs than to the\r\nlarge kinds upon which the "zebras" are often attached, because, like\r\nthe salt water mussel you have often seen at New Brighton, they have\r\nthe power of spinning, what is called, "a byssus"--here, you see, is\r\nthe substance I mean--by which they fasten themselves to shells, or to\r\nstones, roots, and other things.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ZEBRA MUSSEL.--_b._ BYSSUS.]\r\n\r\nThere flies one of those pretty little birds, the long-tailed\r\ntitmouse; it is common enough, certainly, but I never fail to notice\r\nseveral upon the hedges and poplar trees of the "Duke\'s drive." There\r\nare several members of the titmouse family found in Great Britain;\r\nlet me count them. First we have the great tit, then the little\r\nblue-tit, the long-tailed tit, the cole tit, the marsh, the crested\r\nand the bearded tit. How many does that make? Seven; but the crested\r\ntit is very uncommon, and the bearded tit does not occur in\r\nShropshire. The other five are quite common and we shall, I dare say,\r\nbe able to see all in the course of to-day\'s walk. The long-tailed\r\ntit, so called on account of the great length of the tail feathers, is\r\na very active, lively little bird. Indeed, activity and liveliness\r\nbelong to all the tit family. See how the little fellow flits from\r\nbranch to branch, seldom remaining long on one spot. It is a very\r\nsmall bird, almost the smallest British bird we have; of course I am\r\nthinking of the tit\'s body and not taking into account its tail. The\r\nskin is remarkably tender, and thin as tissue paper. Like all the\r\ntitmice, the long-tailed tit feeds on insects and their larv\xc3\xa6. I do\r\nnot remember to have heard or seen this species tapping the bark of a\r\ntree with its beak, as the great and the blue tit are frequently in\r\nthe habit of doing, but most probably they do the same. "What do they\r\ntap for, papa?" asked May. I suppose for the purpose of frightening\r\nthe tiny insects, which lurk under the bark, from their hiding places,\r\nwhen they quickly snap them up with their sharply-pointed bills and\r\ndevour them. "Is not this the tit which the people about here call a\r\nbottle tit, and which makes a very beautiful nest?" asked Willy. Yes,\r\nthe nest is indeed a very pretty object, and one that you would never,\r\nI think, confuse with the nest of any other bird. The outside is\r\nformed of that white-coloured lichen, so pretty and so common, and\r\nmoss, and if you were to put your finger, May, into the inside, which\r\nis full of the softest feathers, you would say it was as nice as your\r\nown muff. The nest is oval, with a hole at the side. I believe that\r\nsometimes two holes exist, but I have never seen two in a nest. The\r\neggs are very small, and are white with a few lilac spots. As many as\r\na dozen or more are sometimes found in a nest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LONG-TAILED TIT.]\r\n\r\nThe little blue-tit, which has just fled across our path is a very\r\npretty active bird and common everywhere, in lanes, woods, and\r\ngardens. The blue-tit makes its nest in a wall or a hole in a tree and\r\nlays about nine or ten pretty little spotted eggs. How often I\r\nremember, when I was a boy, to have been bitten rather sharply by this\r\nlittle bird into whose nest I had placed my hand; I can fancy I hear\r\nthe snake-like hissing which the blue-tit utters when some rude hand\r\ninvades its home. Its food consists of various kinds of insects and\r\ninsect larv\xc3\xa6, which it finds on the bark of trees and in fruit buds. I\r\nthink it does much good by destroying numbers of injurious insects,\r\nthough gardeners and others destroy this bird, because they say it\r\nharms the fruit buds. Look at that little sprightly fellow, how\r\nrestless he is; in what curious attitudes he puts himself on yonder\r\nbranch. Hark! you hear him tapping quite distinctly. Besides insects,\r\nblue-tit does not object to make a meal of dead mice or rats. Mr. St.\r\nJohn tells us that a blue-tomtit once took up his abode in the\r\ndrawing-room, having been first attracted there by the house flies\r\nwhich crawl on the window. "These he was most active in searching for\r\nand catching, inserting his little bill into every corner and crevice\r\nand detecting every fly which had escaped the brush of the housemaid."\r\nHe soon became more bold and came down to pick up crumbs which the\r\nchildren placed for him on the table, looking up into Mr. St. John\'s\r\nface without the least apparent fear. Boys sometimes call the little\r\nblue-tit Billy Biter, no doubt from personal experience of the\r\nsharpness of Mr. Tit\'s beak. The great tit which we can see under the\r\nyew tree in our garden, almost any hour of the day, is very common in\r\nthe neighbourhood, and I dare say if we look well about us during our\r\nwalk we shall see some to-day.\r\n\r\n"Oh! papa," exclaimed Willy, "there are some birds on the towing-path\r\nof the canal, about sixty yards off; they seem to be breaking\r\nsomething with their beaks by knocking it against the ground; just\r\nlook." Yes, they are thrushes, and I can tell you what they are doing\r\nand what we shall find when we come up to the spot. We shall see\r\nseveral broken snail shells (_Helix_), which the thrushes find on the\r\ngrassy slopes of the canal bank, and then bring up to the path in\r\norder to get at the animals inside the shells by breaking them against\r\nthe hard ground and stones. There! as I told you, you see at least a\r\ndozen broken snail shells. I am sure the thrushes do a great deal of\r\ngood by destroying both snails and young slugs, and it is a pity their\r\nlabours are not more appreciated than they are. Lads in the village,\r\nand great grown men from the collieries, are continually hunting for\r\nthe nests, eggs, or young of thrushes, and many other useful birds,\r\nwhich they wantonly destroy. Now we get on the Duke\'s Drive, and\r\nthere, on a branch of a poplar tree, I see the great tit. Look at him;\r\nhe is the king of the titmice, and he seems to know it. He is a\r\nrestless fellow, like tits in general. Look at his black head and\r\nbreast, white cheeks and greenish back. Now, by one of his hooked\r\nclaws, he hangs suspended from a branch; now again he is clinging by\r\nboth legs; see how busy he is, examining the leaves and bark in search\r\nfor insects. But Major Tit is a bit of a tyrant sometimes and uses\r\nthat sharp short straight bill of his with deadly effect upon some of\r\nhis feathered companions, on whose heads he beats repeated blows till\r\nhe cracks the skulls and eats the brains! The marsh-tit and the\r\ncole-tit are pretty common in this neighbourhood, we may often notice\r\nthem in our walks.\r\n\r\nIf Willy were to get over the hedge with his net and dip it amongst\r\nthe weeds of the pool, I dare say he will succeed in catching a few\r\nwater-insects, which he can put in his bottle and bring to me. Of\r\ncourse the boy was delighted at the idea of dabbling with his net in\r\nthe water--boys generally get immense fun from such amusement, and\r\ntheir clothes frequently not a little dirt. A weedy pond is a grand\r\nplace for naturalists, and various are the beautiful and strange forms\r\nof animal life which are found there. Dipping amongst the duckweed and\r\nwater-crowfoot is always attended with numerous captures, and Willy\'s\r\nbottle was soon full of active little creatures. Let us see what it\r\ncontains. A large beetle is very conspicuous amongst the contents, now\r\nrushing to the top of the water, now sinking to the bottom, scattering\r\nfar and wide the tiny water-fleas, and other little creatures by the\r\nstrong and rapid movements of his swimming legs. This is the great\r\nwater beetle; we will sit down on this clump of poplar tree by the\r\nside of the road, and take the beetle out and examine him; we must\r\ntake care he does not bite our fingers as we hold him, for his jaws\r\nare powerful and sharp. Mr. _Dyticus_, for that is his learned\r\nname--from a Greek word which means "fond of diving"--is one of the\r\nmost voracious of water-insects, but let us first examine his form.\r\nYou see it is well adapted for the kind of life the beetle leads; look\r\nat that long oar-shaped pair of feet, what a broad fringe of hairs\r\nbesets them, how admirably fitted they are for swimming; the\r\nwing-covers are smooth and glossy, without any furrows; by this I know\r\nthe specimen to be a male, for the wing-covers of the female are\r\nfurrowed. The structure of the forefeet is very curious; you observe\r\nits under portion forms a broad circular shield, covered with a number\r\nof sucking-cups, two or three being much larger than the rest; by\r\nmeans of these sucking-cups the beetle can attach itself securely to\r\nany object it wishes. The wings are large and strong, and situated, as\r\nin all the beetle tribe, under the horny wing-covers. I will put this\r\nbit of stick near his mouth; there, Jack, you see his strong jaws, and\r\ngreat use he can make of them I can tell you. If Willy were to put one\r\nof these beetles into his aquarium with his favourite sticklebacks, he\r\nwould soon have cause to lament the untimely loss of some of them; woe\r\nbetide the unfortunate fish or newt that is once caught by the strong\r\njaws of this fresh-water tyrant! I have seen Mr. Dyticus rush upon a\r\nfull-grown newt, and no twistings and writhings could free the victim\r\nfrom the fatal embrace. They will attack young gold and silver fish,\r\nand Mr. Frank Buckland has told us of the sad havoc these\r\nwater-beetles do to young salmon, as witnessed by himself in a pond in\r\nIreland. The forefeet you see are strong but small; the beetle uses\r\nthem as claws in seizing its prey and conveying it to the mouth. A\r\nyoung and tender fish, you can easily imagine, Mr. Dyticus would very\r\nreadily devour, but he will attack beetles as large and even larger\r\nthan himself, seizing them on the under side where the head joins the\r\nbody, the only soft place in a beetle. Dr. Burmeister, a naturalist\r\nwho paid great attention to insects, tells us that he once kept a\r\nbeetle related to the great water-beetle, and saw it devour two frogs\r\nin the space of forty hours. After the eggs are laid, which always\r\ntakes place in the water, the larv\xc3\xa6 are hatched in about a fortnight.\r\nIn time--I do not know how long--these larv\xc3\xa6 grow to the size of about\r\ntwo inches in length, and queer fellows they are, and very voracious\r\nand formidable-looking. Now, Willy, lend me your net, and I dare say\r\nwe shall soon secure a specimen. What have we here? how the pond\r\nswarms with water-fleas! Oh! here is a treasure! What can it be? a\r\nlong animated thread of glass--we will put it into a bottle by itself\r\nand I will tell you about it afterwards. Splash goes the net again,\r\nbut no water-beetle larv\xc3\xa6. Never mind; what does the child\'s songbook\r\nsay--\r\n\r\n    "If at once you don\'t succeed,\r\n    Try, try, try again."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREAT WATER-BEETLE, LARVA AND PUPA.]\r\n\r\nA capital little verse to remember, so we will try again; and there\r\nnow we are rewarded by the capture of a dyticus larva--a creature with\r\na long body--in some respects reminding one of a shrimp. Oh! look at\r\nhis jaws, how wide he opens them! You see that the last segment of the\r\nbody is provided with a long pair of bristly tails, by means of which\r\nthe creature can suspend itself at the top of the water. I have often\r\nkept specimens of these larv\xc3\xa6 in vessels of water and noticed their\r\npredaceous habits; they feed on the larv\xc3\xa6 of other water insects, but\r\nare not able to destroy fish, not being furnished with jaws or bodies\r\nnearly so strong as the perfect insect itself possesses. When the\r\nlarva wishes to turn into its pupa state, it makes a round hole in the\r\nbank of the pond it inhabits, and there undergoes its change, turning\r\ninto a full-grown beetle in about three weeks\' time. "Papa," said\r\nWilly, "I have often caught beetles that remind me of the great\r\nwater-beetle, but they are not so large; what are they?" They belong\r\nto the same family as the great water-beetles, and are called\r\n_Colymbetes_, _Acilius_, _Cybister_; I do not know that they have any\r\nEnglish names. Come, we have dabbled in this pond long enough for the\r\npresent, let us proceed on our walk. "Well, but, papa," said May, "you\r\nhave not told us what that long worm-like creature is in the separate\r\nbottle; do let us look at it again. Oh! really it is a curious\r\ncreature, why it is as transparent as glass, now it jerks itself\r\nabout, now it floats without motion in mid-water. What is it?" "I am\r\ninclined to think," said Willy, "judging from its wriggling, jerking\r\nmotions that it must be the larva of some kind of gnat." Right again,\r\nmy boy, it _is_ the larva of a gnat, and one known to naturalists by\r\nthe name of _Corethra_; you see there are eleven divisions or segments\r\nin the body; the head is of strange form, and near the mouth are two\r\nhooked arms which spring from the middle of the forehead and bend down\r\nin front of the mouth; with these weapons the _Corethra_ larva seizes\r\nits prey and crushes it between two rows of sharp spikes placed under\r\nthe mouth; after being bruised and mangled by this apparatus the prey\r\nis ready to be swallowed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CORETHRA LARVA, MAGNIFIED.]\r\n\r\n"But what," asked Jack, "are those four curious black bodies; one pair\r\nnear the head, the other pair near the tail of the animal?" They are\r\nair-sacs, and are connected with the breathing or respiration of the\r\nlarv\xc3\xa6. Some have supposed that they serve the same office as the\r\nswimming bladder of certain fish, which being compressed or dilated at\r\nwill enables the creature to remain still in mid-water or to rise or\r\nsink in it. After a time the larva changes to a pupa, in which state\r\nit lives without eating for a few days, and then turns into a gnat. We\r\nnow proceed on our walk and come to a part of the road which has a\r\nplantation on either side; we see a little active creature crossing\r\nthe road and at once recognise a weasel. Let us keep quite still and\r\nsilent, and we shall, I dare say, have an opportunity of watching it\r\nfor a short time. Just look at him! how nimbly the little creature\r\nruns along; now he stops and raises his head as if listening for\r\nsomething, now off he starts again; he is evidently hunting, and\r\nprobably is on the scent of a young rabbit, rat, or field-mouse. Ah!\r\nsee he has caught something on the grass near the hedge; what has he\r\ngot in his mouth? it is a small rat, I think; now he throws his\r\nflexible body over it and gives it one or two bites. Now, Jack, run up\r\nand catch him. Ah! he is off like a shot; you must not think to "catch\r\na weasel asleep." I often see these little animals in my rambles, and\r\nalways stop to witness their extraordinary activity. Weasels will\r\nsometimes climb trees and surprise some unfortunate bird on her nest;\r\nthey are fond of eggs, and a bird\'s young brood are very dainty\r\nmorsels; they will also eat moles and are sometimes caught in\r\nmole-traps. An excellent observer mentions a case of a mole-trap\r\nhaving been found many years ago with two weasels in it; they had been\r\nhunting in the mole\'s runs, had come in opposite directions, and "by a\r\ncurious coincidence, must have both sprung the trap at the same\r\ninstant." Weasels are generally classed as vermin and killed on all\r\npossible occasions; I think it is often a mistake to destroy them; no\r\ndoubt they will occasionally catch a young rabbit or a leveret or suck\r\na few partridges\' eggs, but the common food of the weasel consists of\r\nsuch small animals as mice, moles, rats, small birds. In wheat or\r\nother grain ricks, they ought to be encouraged, as they enter them\r\nfor the sake of the rats and mice they find there. I have been told by\r\na friend that in some parts of Wales the farmers look upon the weasel\r\nas a friend, in consideration of the destruction it causes to mice and\r\nrats. A gentleman living near Corwen killed a weasel, and expected to\r\nreceive the thanks of the farmer on whose land it had been killed; he\r\nwas surprised to find that the farmer was by no means grateful. In\r\nthis respect I think the Welsh farmers are wiser than the English\r\nones. Hawks sometimes prey upon weasels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STOAT AND EGGS.]\r\n\r\nMr. Bell tells a story of a gentleman who was riding over his grounds,\r\nonce having seen a kite pounce upon some object on the ground and rise\r\nwith it in his talons. "In a few moments the kite began to show signs\r\nof great uneasiness, rising rapidly in the air, or as quickly falling,\r\nand wheeling irregularly round, whilst it was evidently trying to\r\nforce some hurtful thing from it with its feet." After a short but\r\nsharp contest the kite fell suddenly to the ground, not far from where\r\nthe gentleman was watching the proceeding. On riding up to the spot\r\n"pop goes the weasel," none the worse for his a\xc3\xabrial journey, but the\r\nkite was dead, for the weasel had eaten a hole under the wing. The\r\nweasel makes its nest in a bank or in loosely-constructed stone walls;\r\nthree or four young ones are generally produced. Some years ago I\r\nremember seeing a mother-weasel and three young playing about on a\r\nbank. It was a most interesting sight. The weasel is much smaller than\r\nthe stoat, and you can tell it at once by its tail, which is entirely\r\nred; that of the stoat has a black tip. But it is getting late and we\r\nmust hasten home.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWALK III.\r\n\r\nMAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo-day we will go and hunt for sticklebacks\' nests; as it is calm I\r\nthink we shall have very little trouble in finding a few; a calm day\r\nshould always be chosen, because to find the nests of these little\r\nfish it is necessary to have very sharp eyes, and to look very\r\nclosely, and you know if there is much wind the water is ruffled, and\r\nthen it is not easy to see objects in it. Let us start off, then, with\r\nbait-can, canvass-net, and two or three large-mouthed bottles, to that\r\nsmall, clear, shallow pond in Mr. Jervis\'s field, and see if we can\r\nbring home a few fish and eggs. "It will be great fun," said Willy,\r\n"and when we have caught the little fish we will bring them home and\r\nput them in my aquarium." There are three species of sticklebacks\r\nfound in this country, the three-spined, the ten-spined, and the\r\nfifteen-spined--this last inhabits salt water. All three build nests,\r\nand show great care for their little brood. The nests of the\r\nthree-spined species are those most generally known, though I dare\r\nsay, if we search carefully in the drains on the moors, we shall be\r\nsuccessful in finding a nest of the ten-spined fellow, or tinker, as\r\nhe is sometimes called.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THREE-SPINED STICKLEBACK AND NEST.]\r\n\r\nHere we are at the pond, how clear it is, and how beautifully green\r\nare the few patches of star-wort in the water! As the grass is quite\r\ndry we can all sit down so as to get our eyes as near to the water as\r\npossible; never mind a few crawling ants, May; if they bite you, I\r\nshall not feel it. Ah! do you see that little fellow with crimson\r\nbreast and eyes like emeralds? He sees us, for look how disturbed he\r\nseems; now he darts away and hides under a weed, but soon returns to\r\nthe same spot; it is pretty certain he has a nest close by. I will put\r\nmy walking-stick into the water near him. Well, actually, the brave\r\nlittle fellow is not the least frightened; see, he bunts his nose\r\nagainst the stick, and is very angry; he is afraid of some danger to\r\nhis nest--this makes him so bold. Now I have made out where the nest\r\nis, it is close under him; do you see a few small holes in the mud at\r\nthe bottom of the water? No, you don\'t see anything; well, then, give\r\nme my stick and I will point them out. There now, do you see what I\r\nmean? Yes, you do; that is all right. "Let us get the nest out of the\r\nwater," said Jack. Have patience; let us watch what the fish is doing;\r\nsee, he is busy fanning away with his tiny fins directly over the\r\nnest. "What is he doing that for?" said Willy. The quick movements of\r\nhis fins bring fresh currents of water to the eggs or little fry that\r\nmay be within. Ah! did you see that? another fish came near the nest;\r\nhow furiously our brave "soldier" charged him; how quickly the\r\nintruder retired! I do not think he will dare to approach so near\r\nagain for a long time, for those sharp spines on the under side of the\r\nsoldier are like a couple of bayonets and can inflict serious wounds.\r\nLet us leave this nest for a time and try to find some more. Now that\r\nyou have once seen a nest, you will not have much difficulty in\r\nfinding others. Willy soon found another nest; "just look," he said,\r\n"there are a lot of the tiniest little things close to the nest." Yes,\r\nindeed, so there are; the eggs have hatched, and these are the little\r\nfry; there is Father Stickles quite proud of his numerous family, and\r\nquite ready to fight for them should any enemy be rash enough to\r\nintrude, for you must know that sticklebacks, like many other fish, do\r\nnot object to eat the young fry of their neighbours, and if the parent\r\nthere--it is the male only that is the protector--were to be removed,\r\na hungry pack of other sticklebacks would crowd around and make sad\r\nhavoc amongst that happy little family. I remember some years ago\r\nhaving once taken a father stickleback away from his nest, and, after\r\nputting him in my collecting bottle, I sat down to watch the result.\r\nSoon an invading army of other sticklebacks approached and attacked\r\nthe nest for the purpose of getting at the clusters of eggs it\r\ncontained. They pulled it about sadly, till I began to be sorry for\r\nwhat I had done. I returned the captive-parent to the water; at first\r\nhe hardly knew where he was, and seemed confused, the result, no\r\ndoubt, of his confinement in the bottle; but he was not long in coming\r\nto himself--he remembered his nest and the treasures it contained; he\r\nsaw that devastating army all around it, and, summoning all his\r\ncourage, the soldier-parent began an attack, now rushing at one and\r\nnow at another enemy, till he was left alone on the battle-field,\r\nhaving thus gained, single-handed, a glorious victory indeed.\r\n\r\nWell, we will take this one home, with nest and eggs it contains. You\r\nsee the nest is a mass of tangled grass roots and other weeds; now\r\nthat it is out of the water it is a shapeless mass. However, here is a\r\ncluster of pinkish eggs, and if you look closely you will see two\r\nlittle specks in each egg; so that the fish is being formed, for these\r\nare the little thing\'s eyes. You can see, too, the tiny things jerking\r\ntheir tails about every now and then. It is most interesting to watch\r\nthe care the parent takes of his little ones when hatched. Some few\r\nyears ago I put a male stickleback in a basin of water in charge of\r\nhis nest. When the young ones were hatched it was most curious to\r\nnotice his anxiety for their welfare. Of course young sticklebacks,\r\nlike young children, are of an inquisitive turn of mind, and apt to\r\nplay truant too occasionally; but should some little fellow wander too\r\nfar from the nest, Father Stickles hurries after him, takes the little\r\ntruant in his mouth, and spits him out right over the nest. This I\r\nrepeatedly witnessed myself, and I have no doubt you will be able to\r\nsee the same thing yourselves.\r\n\r\n"Are not sticklebacks quarrelsome little fish?" asked Willy. Yes, they\r\nare very fond of fighting, and they are so bold that they do not fear\r\nany enemy, whatever his size. I once kept a small pike, about ten\r\ninches long, in an aquarium, into which I also introduced five or six\r\nsticklebacks. I suppose the pike did not much like the look of the\r\nprickles or spines, for he did not eat the fish. Once I saw him make\r\nthe attempt, but after getting Master Stickles into his mouth, he\r\nquickly threw him out again, not relishing, I suppose, the _sauce\r\npiquante_ of the spines. The sticklebacks were really masters; they\r\ntormented Mr. Pike dreadfully; first one would take a bite at his\r\ntail, and then another, till the tail had a woful expression indeed;\r\nso I turned the pike into a pool of water, and I dare say the _retail_\r\nbusiness has long ere this been completed.\r\n\r\n"Are there any other kinds of fish," asked Willy, "that make nests and\r\ntake care of their young ones like the three species of sticklebacks?"\r\nYes, there are several kinds of fish which do so, but no other British\r\nfresh-water kinds, I believe. There is the salt-water _Lumpsucker_, a\r\nfish of strange form and brilliant colour--you know the pickled\r\nspecimen in my study--whose young soon after birth fix themselves to\r\nthe sides and on the back of their male parent, who sails, thus\r\nloaded, away to deeper and more safe retreats. There are the long\r\npipe-fishes, the males of which possess each a singular pouch on the\r\ntail; in this the eggs of the female are deposited and matured; the\r\nyoung ones occasionally leave their strange abode, and after swimming\r\nabout for a time return to it again, reminding us in this respect of\r\nthe kangaroos and opossums amongst mammalia. There are also fish which\r\ninhabit the rivers of Demerara which make nests and show great\r\nattachment to their young ones, and I dare say several other fish will\r\nbe found to do the same.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SNAIL LEECH.]\r\n\r\n"Oh! papa, do look here; as I was turning over this bit of flat tile I\r\nsaw in the water I found a creature something like a leech, and on\r\nraising it up I saw what looks like a quantity of the animal\'s eggs,\r\nand she seems to be sitting upon them as a hen upon her eggs." All\r\nright, Jack; let me look, I dare say it is one of the snail-leeches.\r\nYes, to be sure it is, and here are the eggs which the creature\r\ncarefully covers with her body, and upon which she will sit till the\r\nyoung ones are formed; the small brood, sometimes one hundred and\r\nfifty or more in number, then attach themselves to the under surface\r\nof the parent, and are carried about wherever she goes. There are\r\nvarious species of this interesting family; all are inhabitants of\r\nfresh water; some incubate or sit upon their eggs, others carry them\r\nabout in a hollow formed by the contraction of the sides. They have a\r\nlong tubular proboscis, by means of which they suck out the juices of\r\npond-snails and other water creatures. These snail-leeches move along\r\nin the same way as the common horse-leech and the medicinal leech,\r\nnamely, by fixing the head-part on to the surface of some substance in\r\nthe water and then drawing the hinder part up to it; they then extend\r\nthe head-portion and fix it upon another spot, again drawing up the\r\nother extremity. But the leeches, properly so called, have all red\r\nblood; that of the snail-leeches is colourless.\r\n\r\n"Is the leech used to bleed people when they are ill ever found in the\r\nponds of this country?" asked Willy. I believe it is rarely met with\r\nnow-a-days; most of the leeches used in medicine are imported from\r\nSpain, Hungary, the south of France, and Algeria; many millions are\r\nbrought every year to this country. The medicinal leech, was, however,\r\nonce pretty common in the lakes and pools of the north of England. The\r\npoet Wordsworth introduces us to an old leech-gatherer lamenting the\r\nscarcity of the animals in the following lines:\r\n\r\n    "He with a smile did then his words repeat\r\n    And said that gathering leeches far and wide\r\n    He travelled; stirring thus about his feet\r\n    The waters of the pool where they abide.\r\n    Once I could meet with them on every side;\r\n    But they have dwindled long by slow decay;\r\n    Yet still I persevere and find them where I may."\r\n\r\nThis sonnet was written in 1807, and when we consider the immense\r\nnumbers used in medicine, and the utter neglect of leech culture in\r\nthis country, we shall cease to wonder that native leeches are very\r\nscarce. It is said that four only of the principal dealers in London\r\nimport every year more than seven million leeches. The annual demand\r\nin France was estimated in 1846 to be from twenty to thirty millions;\r\nParis requiring three millions a year. "I should be very sorry, papa,"\r\nsaid Jack, "to walk about like the old man in the lines you quoted\r\njust now, with bare legs in the water, making them a bait for leeches.\r\nUgh! it is horrible to think of; they must suck a good deal of blood\r\nfrom the man\'s legs." There is nothing like being used to a thing, and\r\nwhen you remember that many people derive their whole support from the\r\nleeches they gather, you will not wonder that they do not fear a few\r\nleech bites. I do not suppose they lose much blood; no doubt the\r\ngatherers pick them up pretty quickly and put them into their\r\ncollecting cases; besides the chief flow of blood from a leech-bite\r\noccurs after the leech has been removed; the flow is encouraged by the\r\napplication of warm fomentations, but the cold water of a pool would\r\nstop the flow of blood in the case of the man\'s legs. We ought to be\r\nthankful for the existence of an animal which is of such immense\r\nservice to mankind. I suppose it was the appreciation of their value\r\nin medicine that induced French ladies, about forty-five years ago, to\r\nregard leeches with especial favour. Many people remember the\r\nCochin-China _mania_ and the sea-anemone _mania_, but, May, what will\r\nyoung ladies say to the fact that in 1824 there existed in France a\r\n_mania_ for leeches? The most enthusiastic admirer of Cochin fowls or\r\nsea-anemones would never have thought of carrying her admiration of\r\nher pets so high as to wear on her dress figures of these animals; but\r\nwe learn from a French writer that there might have been seen at that\r\nperiod elegant ladies wearing dresses _\xc3\xa0 la Broussais_ on the trimming\r\nof which were imitations of leeches! Broussais, you must know, was a\r\nphysician, no doubt a fashionable ladies\' doctor, and a great patron\r\nof leeches. "What," asked Willy, "are the leeches I often find in the\r\ndrains on the moors and in other places?" I have no doubt you often\r\nfind these kinds; there is a small leech, the commonest of all, called\r\n_Nephelis_, whose little oval cocoons are so frequent on the under\r\nsides of stones in the water and on water plants. I will soon find a\r\nfew cocoons; look here, under this bit of brick tile are five or six;\r\nthey now contain eggs, as I will show you, by slitting open the case\r\nwith my penknife. These gradually change to young leeches, which find\r\ntheir way out of the cocoon through one or other of the two openings\r\nat either end. Then there is the horse leech, and another very similar\r\nto it, called _Aulastoma_, which means having "a mouth as wide as a\r\nhall;" it has no English name, but we may give it one if you like, and\r\ncall it "the hall-mouthed leech." Its mouth is capable of great\r\nstretching, and can readily take in huge earthworms nearly the size of\r\nitself. I once witnessed a curious sight--I put a couple of\r\n"hall-mouths" into a glass vessel of water, and introduced also a\r\ngreat fat lob-worm; each leech seized the worm, the one took the head,\r\nthe other the tail. As the worm got gradually swallowed the two\r\nleeches came to very close quarters, and at last touched. What was to\r\nhappen? would they twist and writhe about and break the worm, and so\r\nshare the "grub" between them? No; the one fellow quickly proceeded to\r\nswallow his antagonist. I watched him carefully, and he succeeded in\r\ngetting down the red lane about an inch of his companion; but whether\r\nhe did not like the taste, or whether he had qualms of conscience for\r\ntaking such unfair advantage of a near relation, I know not; after a\r\nfew minutes the partly swallowed leech made his appearance again,\r\napparently none the worse for his temporary sojourn in the throat of\r\nhis companion. This leech may be seen sometimes on damp earth in\r\nsearch of its favorite earthworms. I should mention also that another\r\nworm-devouring leech has lately been found in this country; it is\r\nknown by the name of _Trocheta_, called after a French naturalist, Du\r\nTrochet, who first described it. I dare say if we look carefully we\r\nshall find it in this neighbourhood. All these leeches lay cocoons in\r\nwhich the young are developed. Let us leave the pool and take our\r\nlittle fish with us, taking care not to shake the can more than we can\r\nhelp. We are now in the fields; the grass is beautifully green after\r\nthe late rain. Look at that crab tree in the hedge; did you ever see\r\nsuch a magnificent mass of blossom? The hawthorn hedges are loaded\r\nwith May-buds; what a show of May there will be in a fortnight\'s time.\r\nLet us gather a sprig of crab blossom and a few bits of May-bud, and\r\nsee if we cannot gather a pretty handful of wild flowers for May to\r\ntake home to mamma. Here are a few cowslips with their drooping golden\r\nbells and delicious scent; I am afraid we shall not find enough to\r\nmake a cowslip ball. Here is cuckoo-flower, which, as old Gerarde\r\nsays, "doth flower in April and Maie, when the cuckoo doth begin her\r\npleasant notes without stammering." Old Gerarde, by the way, ought to\r\nhave said "_his_ pleasant notes," for it is the male bird alone that\r\ncries "cuckoo." Its flowers are of a delicate pale purple when at the\r\nheight of its beauty; they become nearly white when on the wane.\r\n"Ladies\' smock" is another name for this harbinger of Spring;\r\nShakespeare speaks of it--\r\n\r\n    "The daisies pied and violets blue,\r\n    And lady-smocks all silver white."\r\n\r\n\r\nHere is blue speedwell and the delicately pencilled stitchwort with\r\nits pure snow-white blossoms and delicate green leaves. It is a lovely\r\nSpring flower and very common amongst the grass of every hedgerow. We\r\nwill pluck a few bits; how brittle the stem is. What curious ideas our\r\nancestors must have had; fancy calling this plant "all-bones!" Its\r\nname, stitchwort, no doubt alludes to the plant\'s supposed virtue in\r\ncases of "stitches" in the side. The following lines of Calder\r\nCampbell on Spring flowers I am sure you will think very pretty:\r\n\r\n    "The buds are green on the Linden tree,\r\n    And flowers are bursting on the lea;\r\n    There is the daisy, so prim and white,\r\n    With its golden eye and its fringes bright;\r\n    And here is the golden buttercup,\r\n    Like a miser\'s chest with the gold heap\'d up;\r\n    And the stitchwort with its pearly star,\r\n    Seen on the hedgebank from afar;\r\n    And there is the primrose, sweet, though wan,\r\n    And the cowslip dear to the ortolan,\r\n    That sucks its morning draught of dew\r\n    From the drooping curls of the harebell blue."\r\n\r\nHere is more "May-flower" or marsh marigold; let us take some; it will\r\nmake a bright show in our wildflower cluster. We will put a sprig or\r\ntwo of copper beech, with its rich brown leaves, which we can get from\r\nthe garden, two bits of lilac, purple and white; and though the\r\nnosegay is common, it is still very beautiful, and mamma will put it\r\nin her best vase and give it a place in the drawing-room for those to\r\nadmire who have hearts to admire the wild gifts of Nature.\r\n\r\nWhy, Jacko, what are you grubbing up in that ditch? "I am not grubbing\r\nup anything," said Jacko, "but here are a lot of black creatures,\r\nlively enough when you stir them up; I suppose they must be tadpoles."\r\nTadpoles, Jack, unquestionably, but are they the young of the toad or\r\nthe frog? Let me see. Well, it is not easy to say which in their\r\npresent stage, a tadpole is so like a tadpole, whether the young of\r\nfrog or toad. If you had found the eggs, which you might have done\r\nearlier in the year, there would have been no difficulty in saying\r\nwhether they belonged to a toad or a frog; for the toad lays its black\r\neggs imbedded in a long clear jelly-like line, whereas the frog\'s eggs\r\nare imbedded in a shapeless mass of jelly. Look at some of these\r\nlittle black fellows, as black as niggers; there is a delicate fringe\r\non each side of the head; these are the creature\'s gills and answer\r\nthe same purpose as the gills in a fish; the blood circulates through\r\nthem, and is made fresh and pure by the action of the air contained in\r\nthe water. In this state the tadpole is more of a fish than a reptile;\r\nin a short time, however, these gills will be lost and then the\r\ntadpole can no longer breathe the air of the water, but must come to\r\nthe surface to take in air from the atmosphere. By-and-by we should\r\nsee two small tubercles appear near the root of the tail; these are\r\nthe first indications of hind-legs. Meanwhile the forelegs are budding\r\nforth, and in time would assume their distinct forms. The changes of\r\nthe tadpole, when it is a fish, to a frog, when it becomes a reptile,\r\nare most curious and instructive. If you have never seen the\r\ncirculation of blood in a tadpole\'s tail, you have something to look\r\nforward to, and I will promise to show it you some day under the\r\nmicroscope. "What kind of frog," Willy asked, "do they eat in France?\r\nbecause you know the French eat frogs." The frog which the French eat\r\nis a different species from our common frog, though I dare say our\r\ncommon frog would be quite as good. The edible frog has been several\r\ntimes found in this country, and Mr. Eyton says that during the time a\r\ndetachment of the French were prisoners at Wellington, they were\r\nhighly delighted to find their old friend the edible frog in the wild\r\nmoors here. I have never myself seen any other than the common frog in\r\nthis neighbourhood. You may think a frog would make a curious sort of\r\npet, but a gentleman once kept a frog for several years quite\r\ndomesticated. It made its appearance in an underground kitchen at\r\nKingston on the banks of the Thames. The servants, wonderful to say,\r\nshowed him kindness and gave him food; one would rather have expected\r\nthat they would have uttered loud shrieks of terror and fainted away\r\nat the unexpected sight. Curiously enough, during the winter seasons,\r\nwhen frogs as a rule are lying asleep at the bottom of a pool, this\r\nfrog used to come out of his hole and seek a snug place near the\r\nkitchen fire, where he would continue to bask and enjoy himself till\r\nthe servants retired to rest. And more curious still, this frog got\r\nremarkably fond of a favourite old cat, and used to nestle under the\r\nwarm fur of Mrs. Pussy, she in the mean time showing she did not in\r\nthe least object to Mr. Frog\'s presence.\r\n\r\nBoth frogs and toads do a great deal of good by destroying quantities\r\nof slugs and injurious insects; they are, moreover, perfectly\r\nharmless. Some ignorant people, who love to destroy everything, insist\r\non killing frogs and toads; they say they eat the strawberries in\r\ntheir gardens. Did you ever examine a frog\'s or a toad\'s tongue,\r\nWilly? You never did; then I hope the next frog you catch you will\r\ncarefully open his mouth--treat him as if you loved him, as honest\r\nIsaac Walton says--and give me some short account of the structure of\r\na frog\'s tongue. "All right, papa," said Willy, "I will bear the\r\nmatter in mind. It makes me laugh, though, to think of my examining a\r\nfrog\'s tongue; still I wonder what it is like, and I wish I could at\r\nonce catch a frog to see; but we are now again near home, and I must\r\nwait for another walk."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWALK IV.\r\n\r\nMAY.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Papa," said Willy, "you once told me of a very beautiful little\r\ncreature, almost too small to be seen by the naked eye, that lives in\r\nwater, and builds its house out of the small particles of clay or mud\r\nthat float therein. The bricks are not of the shape of house bricks,\r\nbut quite round. Do you not think we can find some of these animals in\r\nthe course of to-day\'s walk? I forget the name of the creature." I\r\nknow what you mean; you are speaking of a microscopic animal called\r\n_Melicerta_. "Oh, yes, that is its name, now I remember." I have no\r\ndoubt we shall be able to obtain specimens from the canal; so we will\r\nwalk along the bank for a short distance and then get into the fields\r\nagain. We must take with us a clear wide-mouthed bottle, and we shall\r\nsoon see whether we have captured any specimens. These exquisite\r\nlittle creatures attach themselves to the leaves and stems of\r\nwater-plants; they are most readily seen on the finely cut leaves of\r\nthe water-buttercup or spiked milfoil. The way to proceed is to place\r\na tuft of this plant in the bottle and to hold it up to the light, and\r\nwe shall soon see whether any Melicert\xc3\xa6 are there.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MELICERTA ON WEED.]\r\n\r\nHere is plenty of water-buttercup--a very interesting plant\r\nby-the-bye, and one which is subject to much variation; for when it\r\ngrows in swiftly flowing water all the leaves are very long and\r\nhair-like, but in still water there are flattened leaves as well, and\r\nthe hair-like leaves are not nearly so long. You see it is now in\r\nflower; a beautiful white mass it forms in small still ponds. "Well,\r\nbut, papa," said May, "the flowers are white, and I thought all\r\nbuttercups were yellow." Nearly all the buttercups have yellow\r\nflowers, but there are two British species which have white blossoms,\r\nnamely, this one and the little ivy-leaved buttercup, or crowfoot, as\r\nit is often called, which is found either in the water or near the\r\nwater\'s edge. Though the ivy-leaved crowfoot is generally regarded as\r\na species, I think it is only a variety of the one we are now looking\r\nat. Now I fish a plant out with my stick and nip off a tuft of\r\nhair-like leaves and pop it into the bottle. Have I anything here? No\r\ndoubt the microscope would show countless numbers of minute\r\nanimalcules, but I detect no Melicert\xc3\xa6. Let us try again. I nip off\r\nanother tuft. There! do you see one, two, three, four little things\r\nsticking almost at right angles to some of the leaves? No, you see\r\nnothing? Well, perhaps not, for your eyes are not so accustomed to\r\nthese things as mine are, but I will take out my pocket lens; there,\r\nsurely you see that one close to the side of the bottle, do you not?\r\nOh yes, you see what I mean; well, that is the case or house of a\r\nMelicerta, which animal I will describe to you, and when we get home\r\nwe will look at it under the microscope. The case is about the twelfth\r\npart of an inch long and about the thickness of a horsehair, and of a\r\nreddish colour generally, though the colour depends on the nature of\r\nthe material out of which the case is made. Let us sit down and put\r\nthe bottle on this large stone, and I dare say some of the creatures\r\nwill soon show their heads at the top of the tubes, for they are all\r\nindoors now; the disturbance caused in breaking off the bit of weed\r\nand putting it in the bottle has alarmed the Melicert\xc3\xa6, and very\r\nquickly they sunk within their houses of clay.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MELICERTA, ON WEED, MAGNIFIED.]\r\n\r\nNow I see one fellow slowly appearing at the top, after the manner of\r\na chimney-sweeper, but certainly in a much more elegant form. There!\r\nit has unfolded four flower-like expansions, of which the uppermost\r\nare much the largest. The animal shows only the upper part of its\r\nbody, and I can see with my pocket lens that it is somewhat\r\ntransparent and whitish. But my lens has not sufficient magnifying\r\npower to reveal more, so I must tell you what I have seen of Melicerta\r\nunder my compound microscope. Each of these four leaf-like lobes or\r\nexpansions is surrounded with very minute hairs, which can move with\r\ngreat rapidity in all directions; these you will remember are called\r\n"cilia," from the resemblance to _eyelashes_, for which cilia is the\r\nLatin word. The motion caused by these numerous cilia lashing the\r\nwater brings currents containing particles of food for the Melicerta,\r\nand materials for his house. Mr. Melicerta "is at once brick-maker,\r\nmason, and architect, and fabricates as pretty a tower as it is easy\r\nto conceive." The mouth is situated between the two large leaflets,\r\nand leads to a narrow throat, in which are the curious jaws and teeth\r\nof the animal. Below the jaws are the stomach and intestine; so you\r\nsee the Melicerta, though so minute a creature, has a complex\r\nstructure. "You said, papa," remarked May, "that the little creature\r\nmakes its own tube; how does it do that?" Upon the upper part of the\r\nhead there is a small hollow cup, which is lined with cilia, and\r\nprobably also secretes some sticky fluid to make the pellets of clay\r\nadhere together; the particles of clay and mud, having been brought to\r\nthe space between the leaflets by the action of the cilia, are\r\nconveyed to this little cup-shaped cavity, and are then worked about\r\nby the cilia within, till a round pellet is formed which completely\r\nfits the cavity. The little creature then bends itself down upon the\r\ntube and deposits the pellet upon it, then it raises itself up again\r\nand proceeds to form another brick, its jaws working all the time. "I\r\nwonder," said Jack, "how the little creature manages to set apart and\r\nput in its proper place the particles required for food and those\r\nrequired for brick-making; it would be funny if it sometimes made a\r\nmistake and put the clay in its stomach and the food in the brick\r\nmachine!" It is curious, indeed, to know how the materials are put in\r\nthe proper place; I suppose the Melicerta has the power to change the\r\ndirection of the currents and thus to place the particles in their\r\nproper place. By rubbing a little paint, such as carmine or indigo, in\r\nsome water and placing a drop upon the glass slide with the Melicerta,\r\nthese currents may be readily seen; and I have more than once seen\r\nrows of coloured bricks, red or blue, which the animal moulded and\r\nthen deposited on the tube! We will take the bottle home, and if you\r\nhave patience I doubt not I shall be able to show you a good deal of\r\nwhat I have been describing; but you must have patience, for, as an\r\nexcellent naturalist has said, "The Melicerta is an awkward object to\r\nundertake to show to our friends, for, as they knock at the door, she\r\nis apt to turn sulky, and when once in this mood it is impossible to\r\nsay when her fair form will reappear. At times the head is wagged\r\nabout in all directions with considerable vehemence, playing singular\r\nantics, and distorting her lobes so as to exhibit a Punch and Judy\r\nprofile."[B]\r\n\r\nHark! what is that bird singing so sweetly and with such animation in\r\nthe hedge? Do you hear? It is the dear little sedge-warbler; often,\r\nindeed, heard, but not so often seen, for it is fond of hiding itself\r\nin bushes or sedges. The sedge-warbler, like the migratory warblers\r\ngenerally, comes to us in April and leaves us in September. How often\r\nhave I listened with delight to its music when returning home quite\r\nlate at night in summer months! If the bird stops its music for a few\r\nmoments, you have only to throw a stone among the bushes and the\r\nsinging commences again. I am not clever in describing musical sounds,\r\nand I cannot describe that of the sedge-warbler, nor can I always\r\ndistinguish it from the song of its near relative the reed-warbler.\r\nBoth imitate the songs of other birds, and their incessant warblings\r\nand babblings at night cause them to be often mistaken for\r\nnightingales. I have generally found the nest of the sedge-warbler on\r\nthe ground, on a tuft of coarse grass or sedge; the nest of the\r\nreed-warbler is supported on four or five tall reeds, and is made of\r\nthe seed-branches of the reeds and long grass wound round and round;\r\nit is made deep, so that the little eggs are not tossed out when the\r\nreeds are shaken by the high winds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEST OF REED WARBLER.]\r\n\r\nHark! there is the cuckoo; how clearly he utters "cuckoo! cuckoo!" He\r\nis not far away. Some people can imitate the well-known note so well\r\nas to deceive the bird and bring it near the place where they are\r\nhiding. Your Uncle Philip only the other day made a cuckoo respond to\r\nhim; had the day been calm instead of windy, he would, no doubt, have\r\ninduced the bird to come close to us. There he goes with his long\r\ntail, flying something like a hawk. You should remember the rhyming\r\nlines about the cuckoo\'s visit to this country:\r\n\r\n    In April,\r\n    Come he will.\r\n    In May,\r\n    He sings all day.\r\n    In June,\r\n    He alters his tune.\r\n    In July,\r\n    He prepares to fly.\r\n    Come August,\r\n    Go he must.\r\n\r\n"I think you said, papa," said May, "that it is only the male bird\r\nthat utters the cuckoo note; what kind of a voice has the female?" I\r\nhave never heard the note of the female cuckoo. Mr. Jenyns says, "The\r\nnote of the female cuckoo is so unlike that of the male, which is\r\nfamiliar to every one, that persons are sometimes with difficulty\r\npersuaded that it proceeds from that bird. It is a kind of chattering\r\ncry, consisting of a few notes uttered fast in succession, but\r\nremarkably clear and liquid." Very curious are the habits of the\r\ncuckoo. Unlike most other birds, they do not pair; you all know, too,\r\nthat cuckoos make no nests, but lay their eggs one by one in the nests\r\nof various other birds, such as those of the hedge-warbler, or\r\nhedge-sparrow as it is generally but wrongly called, robin,\r\nwhite-throat, and other birds. It is probable that the same cuckoo\r\ndoes not go twice to the same nest to deposit her egg. What a curious\r\nexception is the case of the cuckoo to the instinctive love of their\r\noffspring observable in almost all birds! After the eggs are laid the\r\nparent bird has no further trouble with them; no period of incubation\r\nto bare the breast of the brooding bird; no anxiety about her young\r\nones, as some idle, wanton lad hunts amongst the trees and bushes,\r\ndestroys both nest and eggs, or tortures the helpless fledglings!\r\n"But, papa," said Willy, "how does it happen that the young birds\r\nhatched in the same nest with the young cuckoo always get turned out\r\nof it." The cuckoo, being much the larger and heavier bird, fills up\r\nthe greater part of the nest, consequently the smaller fledgling\r\ncompanions get placed on the sides of the nest, and partially also on\r\nthe back of the young cuckoo; when, therefore, the latter stands up in\r\nthe nest he often lifts up on his back one of the small companions,\r\nwho thus gets thrown headlong to the ground. This seems to me to be\r\nthe mode in which the ejection sometimes takes place, till at last the\r\nyoung cuckoo is left sole possessor of the nest, and of course gets\r\nall the food; at the same time I ought to say that some naturalists\r\nattribute a murderous disposition to the young cuckoo, and say that\r\nthe other inmates of the nest are maliciously thrown out. Others,\r\nagain, say that the foster birds throw their own young ones out. It\r\nis certain that the young are sometimes treated thus, for they have\r\nbeen seen on the ground when the young cuckoo was too small to eject\r\nthem itself.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CUCKOO.]\r\n\r\n"But why do not cuckoos make nests and sit on their eggs like other\r\nbirds?" said Jack. Such a question is more easily asked than answered;\r\nnevertheless I hope you will always try to discover reasons for\r\nthings. "It is now," writes a celebrated naturalist, "commonly\r\nadmitted that the more immediate and final cause of the cuckoo\'s\r\ninstinct is, that she lays her eggs, not daily, but at intervals of\r\ntwo or three days; so that if she were to make her own nest and sit on\r\nher own eggs, those first laid would have to be left for some time\r\nunincubated, or there would be eggs and young birds of different ages\r\nin the same nest. If this were the case the process of laying and\r\nhatching might be inconveniently long, more especially as she has to\r\nmigrate at a very early period, and the first hatched young would\r\nprobably have to be fed by the male alone." The cuckoos come to this\r\ncountry about the middle of April; the male birds arrive before the\r\nfemales. Whether this arrangement is ungallant conduct on the part of\r\nthe gentlemen birds, who prefer to come alone, or whether, just when\r\nthe gentleman cuckoo is ready and almost impatient for a start, her\r\nladyship has all at once discovered some important matter that ought\r\nto be finished before leaving the country, some adjustment of her\r\ndress, some tiresome feather that will ruffle itself up in spite of\r\nevery effort to keep it smooth, I know not, but the fact remains, that\r\nmy Lord and Lady Cuckoo do not travel together. Let us suppose that\r\nboth sexes have arrived in this country, we will say about the 23rd of\r\nApril. It is natural they want a little time to look about them; at\r\nany rate, no egg is ready for being sat upon till some weeks after the\r\narrival of the birds, say the 15th of May. The eggs require fourteen\r\ndays\' setting before they are hatched; this brings the date to the\r\n29th of May. The young ones will require three weeks in the nest and\r\nconstant feeding all the time; we now arrive at about the 20th of\r\nJune, when the young ones would be ready to leave the nest. But they\r\nwant five weeks\' more feeding by the parents, after they leave the\r\nnest, before they are able to provide for themselves; this would bring\r\nthe date to about the 25th of July, when there is hardly a parent bird\r\nin the country; they have left for other parts of the world. "Oh! but,\r\npapa," said Willy, "you said in the lines you told us to remember--\r\n\r\n    In July,\r\n    He prepares to fly.\r\n    Come August,\r\n    Go he must.\r\n\r\nAnd now you say the cuckoos leave before the end of July. I think you\r\nmust have made a mistake somehow." I am glad that you have found out\r\nthe error, if it is one. Old rhymes are not always to be trusted; but\r\nI suspect that the couplet "Come August, go he must," means to imply\r\nthat the cuckoo does never really stay so late with us. I must not,\r\nhowever, forget to tell you that it is the old parent birds that leave\r\nus early; young birds remain till September, and even October, but\r\nthey have not by that time acquired the cuckoo note. If you ask why\r\ncannot the old cuckoos stay with us a little longer, and then all go\r\naway together as a family party, young and old, in September, instead\r\nof being in such a hurry, I have only to say that it is the fashion\r\namongst cuckoos, and of course cuckoos, like certain other animals,\r\nmust be in the fashion. This is Dr. Jenner\'s explanation of the\r\npeculiar habits of the cuckoo in respect of its eggs. I am not\r\nprepared to say whether or not it is sufficient to explain them. The\r\ncuckoo\'s egg is very small when compared with the size of the bird; it\r\nis of a pale grey tinged with red.\r\n\r\n"But how does the cuckoo\'s egg get into some of the nests?" asked\r\nWilly; "for some of the nests in which the cuckoo\'s egg is found are\r\ntoo small to allow the cuckoo herself to enter to lay her egg." You\r\nare quite right; I believe it has been proved that the cuckoo lays her\r\negg on the ground, and carries it in her bill into other birds\' nests.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HORSE-TAIL.]\r\n\r\n"Oh! papa," said Jack, "what is this curious plant that grows so\r\nabundantly on the grass here? I know it well by sight, but do not know\r\nits name." It is a spike of horse-tail; see how the stem is marked\r\nwith lines, and how curiously jointed it is, and quite hollow except\r\nwhere the joints occur. The fruit is borne at the top of the plant\r\n(_a_); see, as I shake it, what a quantity of dust comes from it; this\r\ndust is the fruit, or spores as they are called; each spore is of an\r\noval form, with four elastic threads. If I were to put some of this\r\ndust on a glass slide, and look at it under the microscope, I should\r\nsee a curious sight. The four threads would be spread out, but if I\r\nwere to breathe on the glass, these threads would coil themselves\r\nround the oval body; but as soon as the effect of the moisture had\r\npassed away, the threads would shoot out again in the same position as\r\nthey were at first, causing the spore to leap as if it were alive.\r\nThe stems are of two kinds, fertile and unfertile; the one you have in\r\nyour hands is a fertile spike, and appears only in the spring; the\r\nunfertile ones have no dust-like fruit, and have numerous jointed\r\nbranches growing in rows, or whorls as they are termed, round them;\r\nthey remain throughout the summer, and in some places form quite a\r\nthick cover. Feel how rough the stem is; this is due to the presence\r\nof a quantity of silex or flint in it; on this account some of the\r\nspecies are used for polishing purposes. One kind, under the name of\r\n"Dutch rushes," is imported from Holland, being used for polishing\r\nmahogany, ivory, metal, &c. The horse-tails for the most part grow in\r\nmoist ground, in ditches and on the borders of lakes; some, however,\r\nare common in corn fields and on the roadside. In this country they do\r\nnot attain a height of more than a few feet, but in tropical countries\r\none or two species grow to the height of sixteen feet or more.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HYDR\xc3\x86, ON ROOTS OF DUCKWEED.]\r\n\r\nNow for a dip with the bottle in this pond. I will try and catch a few\r\nHydr\xc3\xa6. Strange animals, indeed, they are, and strange is their\r\nhistory; but let us catch a few first. Nothing yet in my bottle like a\r\nhydra. Ah! now we have one or two. You see a small creature sticking\r\nto the stem of a bit of duckweed; around its mouth are five or six\r\nlittle projections. At present they are contracted; but the hydra is\r\nable to lengthen them out, when they appear as long, thin lines, which\r\nare used as the creature\'s fishing-lines; it is not much larger than a\r\npin\'s head at present, but it can stretch its body out as it does its\r\nlines. I will take a handful of duckweed, and put it, dripping wet,\r\ninto this bag, and when we get home we will place the whole in a glass\r\nvessel full of water. In the course of half an hour or so, we shall,\r\nno doubt, see several hydr\xc3\xa6, probably of different species, in various\r\nattitudes--some hanging loosely down, others erecting themselves in\r\ngraceful curves and throwing out their arms or tentacles many times\r\nlonger than their bodies; others shooting up their arms right above\r\ntheir heads; others contracted, looking like miniature dabs of jelly;\r\nothers attached head and tail to the side of the glass; others\r\nfloating on the surface of the water, their tail-ends sticking out and\r\nserving to keep them from sinking; some of a beautiful grass-green\r\ncolour, others light brown or flesh colour, others almost white,\r\nothers red. These creatures may be cut into several parts, yet each\r\npart will grow again into a perfect animal; young ones bud out of the\r\nsides of the parents. Some have said that they can be turned inside\r\nout, and find no inconvenience whatever from the operation. "But how,"\r\nasked Willy, "could anybody manage to turn so small a thing as a hydra\r\ninside out?" It does seem an impossible task, I confess, and a man\r\nmust have much skill and patience to enable him to accomplish it.\r\nHowever, I will give you the description of an attempt made many years\r\nago by a celebrated naturalist of Geneva, named Trembley, who made the\r\nhydr\xc3\xa6 or fresh-water polypes a study for many years. This is what\r\nTrembley says:--"I begin by giving a worm to the polype on which I\r\nwish to make an experiment, and when it is swallowed I begin\r\noperations. It is well not to wait till the worm is much digested. I\r\nput the polype, whose stomach is well filled, in a little water in the\r\nhollow of my left hand; I then press it with a small forceps nearer to\r\nthe tail end than to the head. In this way I push the swallowed worm\r\nagainst the mouth of the polype, which is thus forced to open, and by\r\nagain slightly pressing the polype with my forceps I cause the worm\r\npartly to come out from its mouth, and thus draw out with it an equal\r\npart of the end of its stomach. The worm, coming out of the mouth of\r\nthe polype, forces it to enlarge itself considerably, especially if it\r\ncomes out doubled up. When the polype is in this state, I take it\r\ngently out of the water, without disturbing anything, and place it on\r\nthe edge of my hand, which is simply moistened, so that it may not\r\nadhere too closely. I oblige it to contract more and more, and this\r\nalso enlarges the stomach and mouth. The worm then is partly coming\r\nout of the mouth, and, keeping it open, I then take in my right hand\r\na hog\'s bristle, rather thick and without a point, and I hold it as\r\none holds a lancet for bleeding. I bring its thickest end to the hind\r\nend of the polype and push it, making it enter into its stomach, which\r\nis the more easily done as in that part it is empty and much enlarged.\r\nI push on the end of the hog\'s bristle, which continues to invest the\r\npolype. When it reaches the worm, which holds the mouth open, it\r\neither pushes the worm or passes by its side, and at last comes out by\r\nthe mouth, the polype being thus completely turned inside out."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HYDRA, WITH YOUNG ONES BUDDING OUT FROM ITS SIDE.]\r\n\r\nVery strange, indeed, to think that animals with the wrong side\r\noutermost should continue to eat, grow, and multiply, as Trembley\r\nassures us his specimens did, though, perhaps, we shall not wonder\r\nthat they often tried to turn themselves back to their original\r\ncondition, and with success, unless Trembley took steps to prevent\r\nthem. There are other strange things recorded of the fresh-water\r\npolypes, as that different individuals can be grafted together without\r\nthe slightest inconvenience to any of the parties, the joint-stock\r\ncompany of course being limited.\r\n\r\nThe hydr\xc3\xa6 live on small worms, larv\xc3\xa6 of gnats, water-fleas, and other\r\nminute creatures; they catch them with their tentacles or\r\nfishing-lines, and draw them to the mouth. It is maintained by many\r\nobservers, with good reason, that these arms have the power of\r\nparalysing, in an instant, the worms they wrap themselves round. There\r\nare at least three well-marked species of hydr\xc3\xa6 to be met with in the\r\nponds and ditches of this country. There is the green hydra, the\r\nlight flesh-coloured or common hydra, and the long-armed hydra, the\r\nmost interesting of all. See, there is the water-primrose, now in\r\nflower, with its delicate pink corolla and bright orange centre. Let\r\nus gather a few plants, and then return home.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote B: \'Marvels of Pond Life,\' by H. J. Slack, p. 92.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWALK V.\r\n\r\nMAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo-day we will go to Shawbury and try our luck with the trout. If the\r\nfish will not rise there will be plenty to observe, and I have no\r\ndoubt we shall enjoy the day thoroughly; the wind is in the south-west\r\nand the day is cloudy; the May-fly is well out, and I think we have\r\nevery chance of good sport. Let us look out our fishing-tackle and\r\ndrive off at once to the river. How delightful it is to stroll by the\r\nriver side and hear the rippling of the water; delightful, too, is the\r\nsensation of feeling at the end of your line the tugs and jumps of a\r\ngood lively trout. I cannot resist quoting some lines from \'The\r\nAngler\'s Song,\' which I think you will say are very pretty:\r\n\r\n  Merry in the greenwood is the note of horn and hound,\r\n  And dull must be the heart of him that leaps not to their sound;\r\n  Merry from the stubble whirrs the partridge on her wing,\r\n  And blithely doth the hare from her shady cover spring;\r\n  But merrier than horn or hound, or stubble\'s rapid pride,\r\n  Is the sport that we court by the gentle river side.\r\n\r\n  Our art can tell the insect tribe that every month doth bring,\r\n  And with a curious wile we know to mock its gauzy wing;\r\n  We know what breeze will bid the trout through the curling waters leap,\r\n  And we can surely win him from shallow or from deep;\r\n  For every cunning fish can we a cunning bait provide,\r\n  In the sport that we court by the gentle river side.\r\n\r\n  Where may we find the music like the music of the stream?\r\n  What diamond like the glances of its ever-changing gleam?\r\n  What couch so soft as mossy banks, where through the noontide hours\r\n  Our dreamy heads are pillowed on a hundred simple flowers?\r\n  While through the crystal stream beneath we mark the fishes glide,\r\n  To the sport that we court by the gentle river side?\r\n\r\n  For as the lark with upland voice the early sun doth greet,\r\n  And the nightingale from shadowy boughs her vesper hymn repeat;\r\n  For as the pattering shower on the meadow doth descend,\r\n  And far as the flitting clouds with the sudden sunbeams blend;\r\n  All beauty, joy and harmony, from morn to eventide,\r\n   Bless the sport that we court by the gentle river side.\r\n\r\nWell, here we are once more at the charming little village of\r\nShawbury. How often, both as a boy and a man, have I wandered by the\r\nbanks of the river Roden. What changes have taken place since my early\r\nrambles! Long familiar forms, companions in my fishing expeditions,\r\nhave vanished; the mind fondly cherishes their memory, and recalls\r\npast hours of cheerful intercourse. We will put up the horse and\r\ncarriage at the Elephant and Castle Inn and stroll away to the river.\r\n\r\nAh! here is a capital place. Now, Master Willy, there is no tree to\r\ninterfere with your throw, so cast in just near that spot, quietly,\r\ncarefully, anxiously; if there is a fish there he cannot resist your\r\ngreen drake. I recommend him the artificial before the fat natural\r\nfly. As Christopher North says--"Devouring ephemerals! Can you not\r\nsuffer the poor insects to sport out their day? They must be insipid\r\neating--but here are some savoury exceedingly ... they carry _sauce\r\npiquante_ in their tails. Do try the taste of this bobber--but any of\r\nthe three you please." There, hold fast, Willy, for that\'s a good\r\none. Bring him up carefully to the side; hold your rod erect; play him\r\na little, for he is full of vigour. There! well done; I have got him\r\nin the landing net. Is not he a beauty? A pound weight, I\'ll be bound;\r\nand what condition! His flesh will be almost as pink as that of a\r\nsalmon. Further down stream I managed to take a fish in very different\r\ncondition; I took him where the river was rather muddy, and flowed\r\nvery slowly. Just look at him, with a body lean and dark coloured, and\r\nan enormous head for so slender a body. "Oh! but, papa," said Willy,\r\n"what are these curious creatures crawling over him? Do look." Ah! I\r\nknow them well; anglers call them trout lice. I will scrape off a\r\nspecimen, and put him in the bottle. Now look at him. The body is\r\nnearly round, and almost transparent; colour rather green; it has four\r\npairs of swimming feet, each pair beset with a fringe of hairs; a pair\r\nof foot-jaws; a small half-cleft tail; and a pair of fleshy circular\r\nsuckers just in front of the foot-jaws, by means of which the little\r\ncreature is able to attach itself, as a parasite, upon various fish.\r\nIt is a graceful little creature, and, as you see, can swim with great\r\nactivity in the water; now it swims in a straight line, now it\r\nsuddenly turns quickly round and turns over and over. It is known to\r\nnaturalists under the name of _Argulus foliaceus_; I do not think it\r\nhas any English name. It is found on many kinds of fish, and generally\r\nin greater abundance upon individuals that are in an unhealthy state;\r\nthough these parasites often attach themselves to fish in good\r\ncondition. The mouth is furnished with a long, sharp sucking-tube, by\r\nmeans of which the animal can pierce the skin of the fish it lives\r\nupon, and suck up the juices. We will take a few home, and I will show\r\nyou the different parts of the creature under the microscope.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PARASITE (_Argulus foliaceus_) ON TROUT, NAT. SIZE AND\r\nMAGNIFIED.]\r\n\r\nLet us now sit down and rest for an hour, and eat our lunch; the fish\r\ndo not rise as freely as they did; perhaps later on they will be in\r\nthe humour again. But what do I see sticking to the sides of that rail\r\nacross the river; I must go and see. Well, really this is an\r\ninteresting thing. An immense mass of flies, a few alive, but the\r\ngreater number quite dead; and, look! a quantity of white eggs\r\nunderneath them. Let us examine a fly; it is of a brown or tawny\r\ncolour, and has rather long, diverging, colourless wings, marked with\r\nirregular brown spots. Why, there must be thousands of dead flies\r\ncovering these eggs. What an odd idea! Presently up comes Mr. Collins\r\nfrom the farm near the bank of the stream. "Oh, sir, I know those\r\nflies quite well; they are oak-flies (_Leptis scolopacea_)." Certainly\r\nnot, I replied, though they do somewhat resemble them in colour and\r\nappearance; but the farmer stoutly asserted he was right, and I did\r\nnot think it worth while discussing the matter further with him. Mr.\r\nCollins is a good fly-fisherman; and fly-fishermen, unless they are\r\nnaturalists, are generally very positive. How often have I tried to\r\nteach anglers that the May-fly does not come from a caddis worm; how\r\noften have I failed! Well, the two-winged fly I have just found in\r\nsuch thousands, with their dead bodies brooding over this mass of\r\neggs, is known to entomologists by the name of _Atherix Ibis_; the\r\nfemales are gregarious, and, as we have seen, attach their eggs to\r\nrails, boughs, or other objects overhanging streams; each female,\r\nhaving laid her eggs, remains there and dies; shortly after comes\r\nanother and does the same, and so on till immense clusters are formed.\r\nThe larva, when hatched, falls into the water, its future residence;\r\nit is said to have a forked tail about one third the length of its\r\nbody, and to "have the power of raising itself in the water by an\r\nincessant undulating motion in a vertical plane." I am not, however,\r\nacquainted with either larva or pupa, but hope to become so this\r\nsummer. "It is very curious, papa," said Jack, "that the flies, after\r\nthey have laid their eggs, should die there; why do not they fly away?\r\nDo any other animals do the same?" Yes, pretty much so. Some of the\r\nfemale insects of the genus called _Coccus_, scale insect, or mealy\r\nbug, common on the stems of various trees, to which they sometimes do\r\nincredible mischief, lay their eggs and die over them, the dead bodies\r\nof the parents forming coverings for the young. See how fast the green\r\ndrake is appearing. Notice how it flies with head erect for a second\r\nor two, and then falls almost helplessly on the surface of the water.\r\n\r\nThere! did you see that fish rise at him? He has escaped the hungry\r\ntrout, and has reached a blade of grass, where he will probably rest\r\nfor some hours. But give me my rod; perhaps the same trout will rise\r\nat my artificial fly. There! that throw was exactly over the spot. No;\r\nhe won\'t have it. I\'ll try again and again. No. Objects to _sauce\r\npiquante_, I suppose. Well, I will tempt him again in an hour\'s time\r\nor so. The water is smooth here, and free from rapids; let us lie down\r\non the grass and see the birth of _Ephemera_--for that is the\r\nMay-fly\'s proper name. Here comes something floating down. It is\r\nwithin the reach of my hand, so I will secure it. What is it? As I\r\nthought. Ephemera is throwing off its swaddling clothes. See how it\r\ntwirls and twists itself about. Now it is free; and the\r\nstrange-looking worm has changed into a beautiful fly. But there is\r\nyet one other operation to go through ere it assumes its final and\r\ncomplete form; you see at present it is a heavy flier, for the wings\r\nare scarcely dry, and the muscles as yet unequal to great exertion; so\r\nin their present imperfect form they are constantly dropping for a\r\nsecond or two in the water, and are often sucked down the throat of\r\nsome roach, trout, or other fish on the look-out. You should remember\r\nthat the _Ephemera_, or May-fly, in this its _sub-imago_, or imperfect\r\nwinged state, represents the "green drake" of the angler. What have I\r\nhere on this blade of grass? Do you see? What is the shadowy form that\r\nlifelessly clings to it? It is a delicate membrane, thin and light;\r\nsee, I blow it away. You saw the split in the back, through which the\r\nformer tenant left the abode. It is the cast-off skin of the green\r\ndrake, now metamorphosed into a creature more active than harlequin or\r\ncolumbine, the male into a dark brown insect, with gauze-like wings,\r\nthe female into a beautiful creature, with body marbled white and\r\nbrown, and able to fly well and strongly, now high in the air, now\r\nsailing along close to the surface of the water, ever and anon dipping\r\ngently into it for the purpose of laying her eggs. The small oval eggs\r\nsink down to the bottom, and attach themselves to the weeds and stones\r\nthat are found there. The flight of the male Ephemera is different; it\r\nis the males that practise together that peculiar up-and-down dance,\r\nwith heads erect and bodies curving prettily upwards; of course, you\r\ncan understand how countless multitudes fall victims to fish and bird,\r\nfor dainty morsels they are. These flies, though voracious feeders\r\nboth in the larval and nymphal state, never eat at all after they have\r\nassumed their perfect form. Indeed, they have no true mouth, only an\r\nimperfect or rudimentary one; and you would never find a particle of\r\nfood in their stomachs, which are always more or less full of\r\nair-bubbles, which, no doubt, assist in buoying up the insect, and\r\nthus save the expenditure of muscular power. I\'ll catch one of those\r\ndancing males, and press him quickly in the middle. There! crack he\r\ngoes! for the little air-bubbles in the stomach have burst by the\r\npressure of my finger and thumb.\r\n\r\nAbundant as are the May-flies at the latter end of May and the\r\nbeginning of June in this country, in other countries they are\r\nsometimes more astonishingly numerous. In some parts of Holland,\r\nSwitzerland, and France, their great numbers have been compared to\r\npelting flakes of snow. "The myriads of Ephemer\xc3\xa6 which filled the\r\nair," says Reaumur, "over the current of the river and over the bank\r\non which I stood, are neither to be expressed nor conceived. When the\r\nsnow falls, with the largest flakes and with the least interval\r\nbetween them, the air is not so full of them as that which surrounded\r\nthe Ephemer\xc3\xa6." The occurrence of such prodigious numbers is, I\r\nbelieve, unknown in the British isles. In the perfect or _imago_ state\r\nthe May-fly lives but a short time. The word _ephemera_ means "living\r\nonly for a day;" and though individuals may live longer, yet the term\r\nis fairly correct as expressing their short existence. The May-flies\r\n(_Ephemer\xc3\xa6_) have all three long fine hairs at the end of the tail;\r\nsome members of the same family, but belonging to a different genus,\r\nhave only two hair-like appendages. For instance, the fly known to\r\nfishermen as the "March-brown" belongs to the same family as the\r\nMay-fly; it is smaller than it, and has only two hairs at the end of\r\nthe tail; but with this exception, the natural March-brown and the\r\nMay-fly are wonderfully alike; yet it is most curious to notice what a\r\nwonderful difference there is in the larv\xc3\xa6 of these two insects.\r\nSignificant facts, no doubt, lie at the bottom of such differences in\r\nthe case of insects so evidently allied, but these I will not speak\r\nof. Here are the two forms of larv\xc3\xa6, the one being the larva of the\r\ncommon May-fly (_Ephemera_), the other that of the March-brown\r\n(_Ba\xc3\xabtis_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LARVA OF BA\xc3\x8bTIS, WITH BREATHING PADDLES, MAGNIFIED.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LARVA OF EPHEMERA, OR MAY-FLY, MAGNIFIED TWO DIAMETERS.]\r\n\r\nCome, we have lunched, and rested, and watched the May-flies; let us\r\ntry to catch a few more trout. It is very strange why sometimes the\r\nfish will not rise, though the weather is propitious and the water in\r\nfirst-rate order. Holloa! master Willy, what game are you after now?\r\n"Oh, papa," he exclaimed, "there are a lot of dace on this shallow, so\r\nI put the spinning hooks on, and, see, I have managed to hook a couple\r\nout, by simply throwing the tackle on the other side of the fish and\r\nthen drawing it smartly through the water over them." Well, that looks\r\nlike a bit of poaching, at all events; the fish are spawning amongst\r\nthat water-crowfoot, no doubt; just hook out some weed, and I dare say\r\nwe shall see some eggs. To be sure; there they are, dotted over the\r\nlong thread-like leaves of the plant, like little pearls. You have\r\ncaught enough, for I think it is not sportsmanlike conduct to take\r\nsuch unfair advantage of the unfortunate dace. Put on your casting\r\nline and try under the old forge bridge. You think there is not much\r\nuse? A true fly-fisherman should never say so. I have taken many a\r\ntrout under the bridge, and I dare say you may be successful this\r\ntime. There! I told you so. Keep your line tight, and Jack shall land\r\nhim. He is not a large fish evidently, but very lively. Now you have\r\nhim, throw him on the grass. Are there any parasites on him? Yes; but\r\ndifferent to the last we observed. Here is a leech-like creature,\r\nrather small and cylindrical; it is the _Piscicola_, a not uncommon\r\nparasitic leech on fish. Well, put him into the bottle; we can take\r\nhim home and examine him at leisure. How many trout have we taken\r\nnow? "We have got nine, papa, and, remember, I have caught three."\r\nYes; but I suppose you include the poaching? "No; I have caught three\r\ntrout with the fly, and I don\'t count the dace." Not a bad day\'s\r\nsport, after all; for I threw back again three small fish. What is\r\nthis showy plant, with large, yellow, globe-like blossoms? How pretty\r\nit is, growing in abundance in a little spot near the river! It is the\r\nglobe flower, so called from the rounded shape of the corolla; it is\r\none of the buttercup family, as you will, perhaps, guess. In its wild\r\nstate I believe it is found in mountain districts, so I suspect it has\r\nfound its way here from some of the cottage gardens which are only a\r\nquarter of a mile distant. We will grub up a few roots; perhaps Mrs.\r\nCharlton would like them for her wild garden shrubbery. When you go\r\na-fishing always be provided, if not inconvenient, with a trowel and a\r\nsmall basket, as well as with a few wide-mouthed bottles; they will be\r\nvery useful, especially if the trout will not rise. The trowel and\r\nbasket you can leave at a cottager\'s house, and the bottles are\r\nindispensable to every angler-naturalist. What are you running after,\r\nJacko? Oh! I see; one of the most beautiful insects that are found in\r\nthis country. Ah! he is too quick for you. It is the brilliant\r\nsteel-blue dragon-fly. Let us sit down for a few minutes and watch its\r\nflight. How rapidly it flies, now pursuing the course of the river,\r\nnow suddenly darting back again. It is the _Agrion virgo_, the most\r\nsplendid of all the dragon-flies, even rivalling the gorgeously\r\ncoloured insects of tropical countries. All the dragon-flies proceed\r\nfrom water larv\xc3\xa6; strange creatures of unbecoming forms and ferocious\r\ndispositions. The mouth, or rather the lower lip of the larva is of\r\nvery singular form. Two jaw-like organs are at the end of the lip, its\r\nbasal portion being articulated to the head; this mask, as it has been\r\ncalled, is folded beneath the head when in repose, but it can be\r\nsuddenly shot out in front of the head so as to seize any small\r\ncreatures that may pass near it which the larva thinks good to eat.\r\nImagine one of your arms being joined on to your chin, bend your elbow\r\nup till your hand covers your face--this will represent the dragon\r\nlarva with the mask in repose; now shoot out your arm in a straight\r\nline from the head--this will represent the mask unfolded and in use;\r\nyour fingers may be considered to represent the jaws of the creature.\r\nWhen the larva wishes to turn into an insect, it leaves the water and\r\ncreeps up the stem of some water weed or other object out of the\r\nwater, bursts its skin, and commences its new state of existence. If\r\nwe look about us near the water side, we shall be sure to find some\r\nempty pupa skins. Here are two on this sedge; you see a slit on the\r\nback through which the dragon-fly has come out. The dragon-flies are\r\nthe largest and most active of our British insects, and, to quote the\r\ndescriptive words of Professor Rymer Jones, "are pre-eminently\r\ndistinguished by the rapidity of their flight and the steadiness of\r\ntheir evolutions while \'hawking\' for prey in the vicinity of ponds and\r\nmarshy grounds, where in hot summer weather they are everywhere to be\r\nmet with. Equally conspicuous from their extreme activity, their\r\ngorgeous colours, and the exquisite structure of their wings, they\r\nmight be regarded as the monarchs of the insect race. The very names\r\nselected for them by entomologists would testify the perfection of\r\ntheir attributes; their titles ranging from that of _Anax imperator_,\r\nindicative of imperial sway, to epithets expressive of feminine\r\ndelicacy and ladylike grace, such as _virgo_, _puella_, _demoiselle_,\r\nand _damsel-fly_, which are appropriated to the sylph-like forms that\r\nmany of them exhibit. In their habits, however, they by no means\r\ndeserve the gentle appellations bestowed upon them. They are, in\r\ntruth, the tigers of the insect world, and their whole lives are\r\ndevoted to bloodshed and rapine. Indomitable in their strength of\r\nwing, furnished with tremendous jaws, and possessed of acuteness of\r\nsight and rapidity of motion scarcely to be paralleled, there seems to\r\nbe no escape from their ferocity, and terrible is the slaughter they\r\neffect amongst the insect legions they are appointed to destroy." It\r\nmust not, however, be supposed from the above description that the\r\ndragon-flies are creatures that deserve to be killed. On the contrary,\r\nthey are most serviceable to men, and destroy countless numbers of\r\ninjurious flies and butterflies whose larv\xc3\xa6 do damage to vegetation.\r\n"Well, papa," said Jack, "the boys in the village always kill them if\r\nthey can catch them, and say they sting horses." I know that this is a\r\npopular tradition, inherited by the rural folks of our day from their\r\ngreat-great-grandmothers\' grandmothers. Dragon-flies are often called\r\n_horse stingers_; in America they are sometimes called _devil\'s\r\ndarning-needles_; in Scotland, I believe, they are known by the name\r\nof _flying adders_. Where is my net? I will try and catch a\r\ndemoiselle. There! I have her, or I should rather say _him_, for these\r\ndark spots on the wings disclose the sex; the female has unspotted\r\nwings, and is of a rich green colour. "How splendidly it shines in the\r\nsun," said Willy; "nothing can exceed the beauty of its wings." Well,\r\nnow you have looked at him closely and admired him, I will let him go\r\nagain. Off he flies, none the worse for his temporary captivity. Now\r\nfor my friend the trout, who would not take my fly an hour ago. Ah! I\r\nhave got him the first throw; see how he jumps. Now, Willy, for the\r\nlanding-net. Bravo! all safe, and a good fish too. Our sport is over\r\nfor the day, and we must get ready to drive home. To-morrow, Willy,\r\nyou may learn these lines from Thomson\'s \'Seasons:\'\r\n\r\n    "When with his lively ray the potent sun\r\n    Has pierced the stream and roused the finny race,\r\n    Then, issuing cheerful, to thy sport repair;\r\n    Chief should the western breezes curling play,\r\n    And light o\'er ether bear the shadowy clouds.\r\n    Just in the dubious point where with the pool\r\n    Is mixed the trembling stream, or where it boils\r\n    Around the stone, or from the hollowed bank\r\n    Reverted plays in undulating flow,\r\n    There throw, nice judging, the delusive fly;\r\n    And as you lead it round in artful curve\r\n    With eye attentive mark the springing game,\r\n    Straight as above the surface of the flood\r\n    They wanton rise, or urged by hunger leap,\r\n    Then fix with gentle twitch, the barbed hook.\r\n    Some lightly tossing to the grassy bank,\r\n    And to the shelving shore slow-dragging some,\r\n    With various hand proportioned to their force.\r\n    If yet too young and easily deceived,\r\n    A worthless prey scarce bends your pliant rod;\r\n    Him, piteous of his youth, and the short space\r\n    He has enjoyed the vital light of heaven,\r\n    Soft disengage, and back into the stream\r\n    The speckled captive throw. But should you lure\r\n    From his dark haunt, beneath the tangled roots\r\n    Of pendent trees, the monarch of the brook,\r\n    Behoves you then to ply your finest art.\r\n    Long time he, following cautious, scans the fly;\r\n    And oft attempts to seize it, but as oft\r\n    The dimpled water speaks his jealous fear.\r\n    At last, while haply o\'er the shaded sun\r\n    Passes a cloud, he desperate takes the leap,\r\n    With sullen plunge. At once he darts along,\r\n    Deep struck, and runs out all the lengthened line;\r\n    Then seeks the furthest ooze, the sheltering weed,\r\n    The caverned bank, his old secure abode,\r\n    And flies aloft, and flounces round the pool,\r\n    Indignant of the guile. With yielding hand,\r\n    That feels him still, yet to his furious course\r\n    Gives way, you, now retiring, following now\r\n    Across the stream, exhaust his idle rage;\r\n    Till, floating broad upon his breathless side,\r\n    And to his fate abandoned, to the shore\r\n    You gaily drag your unresisting prize."\r\n\r\nThere is some good advice here worth remembering; at any rate,\r\npersevere, persevere, and no doubt you will become in time\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A MOST SUCCESSFUL ANGLER.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWALK VI.\r\n\r\nJUNE.\r\n\r\n\r\n"We had many pleasant rambles last autumn," said Willy, "in search of\r\nfungi. How I wish the time was come when we could hunt for fungi\r\nagain. Think of the woods at the bottom of the Wrekin, and those\r\ndelightful fir plantations near Tibberton. Besides you know some kinds\r\nare so good broiled for breakfast. I often think of fungus-hunting.\r\nWhen shall we be able to go out hunting again?"\r\n\r\nSeptember and October are the best months, but we shall meet with\r\nfungi earlier. However, I will promise you a long day\'s ramble or two\r\nin search of fungi when the time comes. In the mean time let us keep\r\nour eyes open, and I dare say we shall even now, in the month of June,\r\nmeet with a few interesting species. We will go into some of the\r\nmeadows near home to-day, and I am much mistaken if we shall not be\r\nable to find St. George\'s mushroom. It is a very delicious fungus, and\r\nperfectly wholesome. I gathered a few specimens the other day, and now\r\nthat the weather is warm, I doubt not we shall meet a good number; so,\r\nbesides collecting bottles, we will take a basket, and Jack shall be\r\nthe carrier. Now separate yourselves and search this pasture well.\r\n"Here are a lot of fungi growing in a ring," exclaimed May. Let me\r\nlook. You have found what we wanted. This fungus is the _Agaricus\r\ngambosus_, or St. George\'s mushroom. See how closely the gills are set\r\ntogether; they are yellowish-white in colour; the top is thick and\r\nfleshy; the stem, too, is very thick. Few fungi, comparatively\r\nspeaking, grow so early in the year, and you could not mistake\r\n_gambosus_ for any other kind. What? You think the smell rather\r\nstrong. Well, I confess this fungus has a strong and not a very\r\npleasant odour. Put what you have collected into the basket; you will\r\nfind that the taste is better than the smell. Here are some specimens\r\nwith the top cracked and split; these are a little older, but they are\r\nvery good. We will put them with the rest. "Oh, papa," exclaimed Jack,\r\n"I was looking at that ash tree in the hedge, and I thought I saw a\r\nmouse run up the trunk." I suspect it was not a mouse, but a bird,\r\ncalled, from its habit of running up trees, the tree-creeper. Let us\r\nget a little nearer. I see I am right; there the little bird is,\r\nrunning rapidly up the tree; now he stops, as if examining the bark;\r\nnow he is off again. How very like a mouse, to be sure! It is one of\r\nthe smallest of our British birds, and, though common enough, is not\r\nvery often seen, except by those who, caring for such things, use\r\ntheir eyes well. Now he has gone to the opposite side of the tree; off\r\nhe goes again and explores another trunk. By means of its long curved\r\nclaws and stiff forked tail-feathers, this prettily marked bird is\r\nenabled to climb with great rapidity. It remains in this country all\r\nthe year, and is more abundant in plantations and parks where there\r\nare plenty of trees. It makes its nest in a hollow tree, or on the\r\ninner side of the bark of a decayed one. The little bird lays many\r\neggs, from six to nine, in the month of April; they are nearly white,\r\nwith a few pinkish spots, generally at the larger end of the egg. It\r\nutters a few pleasing but feeble notes. The young ones are, as you may\r\nsuppose, tiny little things. You should notice the curved pointed beak\r\nof this bird, and the stiff tail-feathers it presses against the tree\r\nas a fulcrum to aid it in its ascent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TREE-CREEPER AND YOUNG.]\r\n\r\nWe will go into this adjoining field, which will soon be ready to mow.\r\nWe will keep by the hedge--for it would not be right to trample down\r\nthe tall grass--and gather a few grasses. Few people know more about\r\ngrass than that it is good pasturage for cattle and sheep. Let us\r\ngather a lot, and take care, as far as we can, to gather only one kind\r\neach. How graceful and beautiful they are, and what difference there\r\nis amongst them; some have a stiff spike-like head of flowers, others\r\nhave pretty drooping heads; some are harsh and rough to the touch,\r\nothers soft as satin. Some, again, are of great value as pasturage and\r\nfor making into hay; others are positively noxious weeds. You know the\r\ntwitch or couch grass, that gives the farmer so much trouble; it is\r\nmost rapid in its growth and difficult to kill; its underground\r\ncreeping stems spread in all directions, and, if left to itself, would\r\nsoon take sole possession of the whole soil. So the farmers are very\r\ncareful to rake together all they can; they then collect it in heaps\r\nand burn it. Here is the rough "cocksfoot grass," with its head or\r\n"panicle" as it is called, upright and tufted. Look at its large\r\nyellow stamens; it is a very productive species and enters largely\r\ninto all hay-grass. Here is the common quaking grass, with its\r\nslender, smooth, spreading branches. See how the numerous little heads\r\ntremble with the slightest motion; we do not see much of it in these\r\nmeadows. It is an exceedingly pretty grass, and often seen on the\r\nchimney-pieces of cottagers, but is by no means a valuable\r\nagricultural grass; on the contrary, it is a sign, when abundant, of\r\npoor land.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PANICLE OF GRASS.]\r\n\r\nHere we have the smooth-stalked meadow grass, and here is the hedge\r\nwood-melic grass, with its slightly drooping panicle, and spikelets on\r\nlong slender footstalks. Here is the soft meadow grass; feel how\r\nsmooth its panicle is; this, the oat-like grass. "What is that very\r\ntall grass," asked Willy, "that often grows near the water? It is much\r\ntaller than you are, and has a rich brown drooping head." You mean the\r\ncommon reed-grass, no doubt; it is not yet in flower, but you will see\r\nit in August and September. It is a magnificent grass, though not of\r\nmuch use to the farmer. The little birds find shelter amongst its\r\nstems, and the reed-warbler often chooses them as pillars whereon to\r\nsupport its nest. Then you must not forget another tall and handsome\r\ngrass, often found on the banks of rivers and lakes, called the\r\nreed-canary grass; it flowers about the middle of July. You know the\r\nribbon-grass, in the garden, with its leaves striped with green and\r\nwhite, varying immensely in the width of its bands, so that you can\r\nnever find two leaves exactly alike. "Yes, indeed, papa," said May,\r\n"I know it well; you know we always put some with the flowers we\r\ngather for the drawing-room table." Well, this is only a cultivated\r\nvariety of the reed-canary grass; and I have sometimes let a cluster\r\nof the ribbon-grass run wild as it were, and then the leaves turn to\r\none uniform green. The reed-meadow grass is another tall and handsome\r\nkind; this cattle are very fond of; it is sweet to the taste and grows\r\nin damp situations. "You sometimes see," said May, "a very beautiful\r\nand curious grass, with long yellow feathery tails, amongst the\r\nornaments in rooms." That is the "feather-grass;" it is a very rare\r\ngrass, and has been seldom found wild in this country. The long yellow\r\ntails are the awns, which resemble delicate feathers. Here is the\r\nsweet-scented vernal grass; taste and see how pleasant it is; it is\r\nthe grass which, perhaps more than any other, gives that charming\r\nodour to the hayfields. "There is a clear pond in yonder corner of the\r\nfield, let us go there and see what we can find," said Willy. All\r\nright. It is a very likely pond for many interesting creatures; but\r\nlet us first look at the plants that grow round or in it. There are a\r\nfew sedges here and there--a pretty order of plants; at present you\r\nmust be content with making yourselves acquainted with their general\r\nform. Take care how you gather them, for the leaves and stems of some\r\nkinds are very rough, and if you draw them quickly through your hand\r\nyou may cut it rather sorely. "Oh! do come here, papa," said May;\r\n"here is quite a new flower to me; is it not a beauty?" Indeed, it is\r\na lovely plant; it is the buckbean or marshtrefoil, and generally\r\ngrows in some boggy spot, such as this. Look at the three green\r\nleaflets, like those of the common bean--hence one of the names of the\r\nplant. Look again at the clusters of blossoms; some are not fully out,\r\nand are of a lovely rose colour; others are quite out, and the flowers\r\ncovered with a white silken fringe. Bite a bit, and taste how bitter\r\nit is; people often gather the roots and use them as a tonic medicine.\r\nI think in some countries, as in Norway and in Germany, the leaves\r\nhave been used in the place of hops for brewing beer; about a couple\r\nof ounces being equal to a couple of pounds of hops. The late Sir\r\nWilliam Hooker found the buckbean very plentiful in Iceland, and says\r\nthat where it occurs it is of great use to travellers over the\r\nmorasses, for they are aware that the thickly entangled roots make a\r\nsafe bed under the soft morass for them to pass over. Here is hairy\r\nmint, nearly a foot high; do you dislike the smell? I think it\r\npleasant myself; it is not yet in flower, but will be so in about six\r\nweeks\' time. Holloa! Jack, what\'s the matter? "I have only tumbled\r\ndown, papa, amongst these nasty nettles, and got stung rather\r\nsharply." That is interesting. Do you know how it is that nettles\r\nsting? "Oh, papa," said Jack, pitifully, "you are like the man in the\r\nfable who was giving a lecture to the drowning boy; the boy asked him\r\nto get him first of all out of the water, and to give him the lecture\r\nafterwards. Now, you should first tell me how to cure these nettle\r\nstings, and I would then be more inclined to learn how it is that\r\nnettles sting."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NETTLE.]\r\n\r\nThe pain will soon pass off, and I do not know that there is any\r\nremedy. When at school, I was told to rub the stung part over with a\r\ndock leaf, but I do not think this ever did it any good. Now, I want\r\nyou to pay particular attention; you know what we call "the dead\r\nnettle"--I mean what plant I allude to; there is the red, white, and\r\nyellow so-called dead nettles; you remember the shape of the flowers\r\nof these three kinds. Look at the flowers of the real stinging\r\nnettles; are they not extremely unlike? You see the small green\r\nflowers in long branched clusters; how different from the lip-shaped\r\nflower of the dead nettles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEAD NETTLE.]\r\n\r\nThere is some general resemblance, however, between the real nettles\r\nand the so-called dead nettles; the leaves for instance of the white\r\ndead nettle are very like those of the stinger. The dead nettles,\r\nhowever, are not at all related to the true nettle, and belong to\r\nquite a different family called the Labiate tribe, from the Latin word\r\n_Labium_, "a lip," in allusion to the form of the corolla. Is the pain\r\nbetter, now, Jacko? "Yes, it is getting less severe; look what large\r\nwhite lumps have arisen on the back of my hand." The sting of the\r\nnettle is a very curious and interesting object under the microscope.\r\nIt consists of a hollow tube with a glandular organ at the bottom of\r\nit, in which is contained an acrid fluid very irritating to the skin;\r\nthe fine point of the sting or hair pierces the skin, and the pressure\r\nforces up the fluid from the bottom of the hair, which is then\r\nconveyed into the wound by a point at the top of the sting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LABIATE PLANT.\r\n\r\n_a._ Stamens. _b._ Corolla. _c._ Calyx.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STING OF NETTLE, MAGNIFIED.]\r\n\r\nThe nettles of foreign countries have much greater poisonous\r\nproperties. The effects of incautiously handling some East Indian\r\nspecies are terrible. The first pain is compared with the pain\r\ninflicted by a red-hot iron; this increases and continues for days. A\r\nFrench botanist was once stung by one of these nettles in the\r\nBotanical Gardens of Calcutta; he says the pain so affected the lower\r\npart of his face that he feared lock-jaw. He did not get rid of the\r\npain till nine days had expired. Dr. Hooker saw gigantic nettles in\r\nNepal, one was a shrubby species growing fifteen feet high, called by\r\nthe natives _mealum-ma_. They had so great a dread of it that Dr.\r\nHooker could hardly persuade them to help him to cut it down. He\r\ngathered several specimens without allowing any part to touch his\r\nskin, but the "scentless effluvium" was so powerful as to cause\r\nunpleasant effects for the rest of the day. "The sting produces\r\nviolent inflammation, and to punish a child with _mealum-ma_ is the\r\nseverest Lepcha threat." Then there is the nettle of Timor, or\r\n_devils-leaf_, the sting of which sometimes produces fatal effects.\r\nTree-nettles in Australia are occasionally found as much as\r\ntwenty-five feet in circumference. There are three species of stinging\r\nnettles in this country, the great nettle, the small nettle, and the\r\nRoman nettle; the first two are very common, the last very rare\r\nindeed. There is a curious story told of the introduction of this\r\nlast species into this country. You may believe as much as you please\r\nof it. It is said that before the Romans under Julius C\xc3\xa6sar thought it\r\nprudent to come to England--of the coldness of which they had heard a\r\ngood deal--they procured some seeds of the Roman nettle, intending to\r\nsow them when they landed in this country; so when they landed at\r\nRomney, in Kent, they sowed the seeds. "And what use, papa," asked\r\nWilly, "would nettles be to them during the cold weather in England?"\r\nWell, they meant to nettle themselves, and so chafe their skins so as\r\nto enable them to bear the cold better. And tough skins they must have\r\nhad, for the poison of the Roman nettle is much more severe than that\r\nof the two common species. Camden, I believe, tells the story; as I\r\nsaid, you may believe it or not. Do you see that tortoiseshell\r\nbutterfly hovering near the nettles? Its larva was a greenish-black\r\ncaterpillar with yellow stripes, and it lived, when in that state,\r\nentirely on the leaves of the nettle; the larv\xc3\xa6 also of other kinds of\r\nbutterflies feed on this plant, as the admiral butterfly, and the\r\npeacock butterfly. I have eaten the young shoots of the common nettles\r\nin the spring of the year; they do not make a bad substitute for\r\nspinach.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LARVA, CHRYSALIS, AND INSECT OF THE SMALL\r\nTORTOISE-SHELL BUTTERFLY. (_Vanessa urtic\xc3\xa6._)]\r\n\r\nHow prettily the yellow flags skirt the pool; there, you see, is the\r\ncommon branched bur-reed, with its sword-like leaves and round heads\r\nof flowers; a little way in the pool is the pretty arrowhead with its\r\nlarge conspicuous arrow-shaped leaves and flesh-coloured flowers, both\r\nleaves and flowers standing several inches out of the water. In the\r\nwater, too, I see the brown leaves of the perfoliate pondweed; they\r\nare almost transparent, and look when dry something like gold-beater\'s\r\nskin. I see also the cylindrical tufts of the horn-wort with its\r\nbristle-like leaves often several times forked. It grows entirely\r\nunder the water. See also a few rose-coloured spikes of the amphibious\r\npersicaria.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: YOUNG CRISTATELLA, MAGNIFIED.]\r\n\r\nSuch are some of the most conspicuous plants near our pond. It looks\r\nlikely to contain some fresh-water polyzoa, than which there are few\r\nmore beautiful tenants of the water. Here is a young one on this leaf\r\nof persicaria; do you see it? I put it into my bottle. Now look, it\r\nhas lately been hatched from that round egg with curious hooks around\r\nits margin. It is called _Cristatella_. At present there are only\r\nthree individuals in the outer heart-shaped covering, but additional\r\nones will bud out of these three, and others from these last, till the\r\nwhole colony may number as many as sixty individuals, being then fully\r\nan inch long; the mouth of each is placed between the tentacles, which\r\nhave upon them, running down each side, a great number of very minute\r\nhairs or _cilia_, to which, you may remember, I have alluded before.\r\nThe colour of the colony is yellowish white, sometimes brownish white.\r\nIt is a most exquisite little animal, or rather colony of animals;\r\nfor, though there are several creatures in one house, as it were, each\r\nis separate and independent of its neighbour. You will often find\r\nother forms of polyzoa in clear ponds and mill-pools; sometimes you\r\nwould suppose you were looking at a mass of sponge, as in the case of\r\n_Alcyonella_, or the creeping root of some weed, as in _Plumatella_\r\nand _Fredericella_; but when the sponge-like mass or rootlets are\r\nplaced in water you will observe numbers of little animals to show\r\ntheir heads and tentacles above the mass or from the little holes in\r\nthe creeping rootlets. Ah! what have we here? Do you see those long\r\nnarrow ribbons of floating grass about a yard from us? Do you notice\r\nsome of the ribbons to be bent and folded here and there? Between each\r\nfold we shall find an egg of a newt. Let me get this bit of grass\r\nribbon. There, I unfold it where it is creased, and you see a\r\ntransparent glairy substance, within which is a round yellowish egg.\r\nHere again is another. The leaves of persicaria, also, are often\r\nselected by the female newt for the purpose of depositing her eggs.\r\nHere you see is a leaf folded up; between the folds is another newt\'s\r\negg. I have never seen the newt in the act of laying her eggs, but, I\r\nbelieve, it may readily be observed by placing a female newt any time\r\nduring the months of May and June in a vessel of water with some\r\nleaves of persicaria. Mr. Bell says, "The manner in which the eggs\r\nare deposited is very interesting and curious. The female, selecting\r\nsome leaf of an aquatic plant, sits as it were upon its edge, and\r\nfolding it by means of her two hind feet, deposits a single egg in the\r\nduplicature of the folded part of the leaf, which is thereby glued\r\nmost securely together, and the egg is thus effectually protected from\r\ninjury. As soon as the female has in this way deposited a single egg,\r\nshe quits the leaf, and after the lapse of a short time seeks another,\r\nthere to place another egg." The eggs undergo various changes, and the\r\nanimal, at an early part of its life, has a pair of delicate organs on\r\neach side of the neck; these are rudimentary gills, by means of which\r\nthe little creature breathes. In its very early condition these gills\r\nare simple lobes; I ought to say that the first pair of lobes serve\r\nthe purpose of holders by which the little creature attaches itself to\r\nleaves and other things. But when it is about three weeks old the\r\ngills have many leaf-like divisions, and look like beautiful feathered\r\nfringes. The circulation of blood in these gills may be readily seen\r\nunder the microscope, and will be surveyed with the greatest delight.\r\nBy-and-bye the animal buds out its four legs and looses the gills;\r\nthey do not drop off, but become absorbed; hitherto it has carried on\r\nits respiration or breathing by means of these gills, but how does it\r\nbreathe now that it has lost them? The lungs in the inside of the body\r\nhave been gradually growing larger and fit for breathing the\r\natmospheric air; for newts, when arrived at their full or perfect\r\nstate, are, you know, chiefly terrestrial creatures, and breathe by\r\nmeans of their lungs. When young they are in a fish state, and\r\nbreathe the air contained in the water exactly as fish do. If you will\r\nlook at a pond where newts abound, you will see the old ones\r\nconstantly coming to the top of the water, gulping down a mouthful of\r\nair and then returning to the bottom. Full-grown newts do not frequent\r\nthe water excepting for the sake of laying their eggs. The young ones\r\nare ready for leaving the water in the autumn, but I have often\r\nobtained young newts with their gills fully developed in the depth of\r\nwinter. Probably these had been hatched late in the summer and had not\r\ntime to grow their lungs, so had to keep to their gills and lead the\r\nlife of a fish during the winter.\r\n\r\n"People often call newts \'askers,\' papa," said Willy, "and the lads of\r\nthe village always kill them when they catch them; they say their bite\r\nis poisonous." I am sorry to say they do; but it is an error to\r\nsuppose their bite is poisonous. You have yourself handled many\r\nspecimens, and I am sure you never saw one attempt to bite. I do not\r\nbelieve their small teeth and weak jaws could pierce the skin. Four\r\nspecies of newts have been described as occurring in this country--the\r\ntwo common kinds are the smooth newt and the warty newt. I think I\r\nonce found the palmated newt near Eyton; the male of this species is\r\ndistinguished from other newts by having the hind legs webbed and by a\r\nthin filament or thread at the end of the tail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DONACIA.\r\n\r\n_a, b._ Larv\xc3\xa6, nat. size. _c._ Cocoons on root, nat. size. _d._\r\nBeetle, slightly magnified, _e._ Head of larva.]\r\n\r\n"What is this, papa," said Jack, "that I have found sticking to the\r\nroots of this water-weed; they look like the eggs of some creature?"\r\nThey are not eggs, but the cocoons of a very common but pretty beetle\r\ncalled _Donacia_. See, I will slit one open with my penknife. There\r\nis the little animal inside, a white, fat, maggoty thing; it has two\r\ncurious hooks at the end of the tail, it has only just framed its\r\ncell, and is about to change from the larval to the pupal state. Here\r\nyou see are other maggots among the roots; they have not yet made a\r\ncocoon. I will open some more; here is one in its pupal condition.\r\nHere is another almost ready to come out as a beetle. The _Donacia_\r\nhave all a metallic appearance and very beautiful they are, whether\r\nblue, red, copper, or purple; the under side is covered with a fine\r\nsilky down. They are found in great numbers on water-weeds, and being\r\nvery sluggish are readily caught or picked off the plants they\r\nfrequent with the hand. Do you notice those small, flat, brown or\r\nblack dabs so common on almost any water-weed you pluck up? These are\r\nplanarian worms, and though not of prepossessing appearance generally,\r\nare extremely interesting animals to study. These large, reddish, oval\r\nor round cocoons are the eggs of the planari\xc3\xa6. Here is one of the\r\nlargest of the family. It is of a milk-white colour, beautifully\r\nmarked with delicate tree-like branches; sometimes this species\r\n(_Planaria lactea_) is of a light pink colour. The mouth is not\r\nsituated where mouths usually are, in the fore part of the body, but\r\nalmost in the centre. See, I will place this white planaria on my\r\nhand; do you notice that it protrudes something you might perhaps say\r\nwas its tongue? It is not its tongue, however; it is a tubular\r\nproboscis, and is very strong and muscular, and unlike the soft body\r\nof the animal. By means of this proboscis the creature is enabled to\r\npierce the bodies of other creatures and to suck out their juices. I\r\nhave kept planari\xc3\xa6 under observation, and seen them drive this\r\nproboscis through each other. These black and brown dabs often feed\r\nupon the milky planari\xc3\xa6. They are something like the hydr\xc3\xa6 in their\r\npower of producing lost portions of their bodies. Cut them in two or\r\nmore pieces, each piece will grow into a perfect planaria again. These\r\nyou see do not swim but crawl, or glide over the surface of plants in\r\nthe water. Some kinds, however, different from these, are able to swim\r\nwell. We have had a long and successful hunt to-day. Let us go.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWALK VII.\r\n\r\nJUNE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis morning, before we started for our walk, we went to look at a\r\nhedgehog which had been brought to us the preceding day. We discovered\r\nthat the animal, in the course of the night, had crept into a bag with\r\na quantity of bran in it, and that there were four little ones with\r\nher. There they were as snug as possible, the mother and little\r\nurchins! Very curious little animals too these young hedgehogs. The\r\nspines or prickles were nearly white and soft, and were not spread\r\nover the whole body, but arranged in rows down it. The appearance was\r\nthat of a plucked duckling when it is what is called "penny." They\r\nwere perfectly blind, and the passage of the ear was quite closed;\r\nthey uttered faint, puppy-like cries. I was desirous to try and rear\r\nthem; but I had grave doubts about the old one, for those who have\r\nattempted to rear young hedgehogs have generally found that the mother\r\nate her offspring. We removed her, young and all, to another place,\r\ngiving them plenty of straw and supplying bread and milk for the old\r\none. Buffon, amongst others, relates "that he had repeatedly placed\r\nthe mother with the young in a place of confinement; but that, instead\r\nof suckling them, she invariably killed and devoured them,\r\nnotwithstanding that she was provided with plenty of food."\r\n\r\nHowever, we determined to give our young urchins a chance, and hoped\r\nthe mother hedgehog would be favorably disposed towards her offspring;\r\nso we now left her undisturbed. Willy wished to know whether hedgehogs\r\nwere injurious creatures, for "you know, papa," he said, "that country\r\nlads and gamekeepers always kill them whenever they have a chance." I\r\nam convinced that hedgehogs do much more good than harm, by the\r\ndestruction they cause to insects, slugs, snails, field-mice, and\r\nother pests of the farm. There is a foolish idea in the minds of the\r\nuneducated that these animals suck cows. You have only to laugh at\r\nsuch an absurdity; but I doubt you will scarcely ever succeed in\r\npersuading such people that the idea is a ridiculous one, and utterly\r\nunsupported by fact. Hedgehogs will undoubtedly destroy eggs, and one\r\ncan understand why gamekeepers wage war against them, fearing for the\r\nsafety of the eggs or young birds of their favorite partridges or\r\npheasants. This is natural. I suspect, however, that hedgehogs seldom\r\nmolest the nests, and that the injury they do in this respect is very\r\nsmall. "But you know, papa," said Jack, "that they will eat young\r\nbirds. Do you not remember the dead sparrow we once gave to a\r\nhedgehog, and how furiously he went at it, and how soon he ate it all\r\nup except the feathers." "Yes," added Willy, "and do you not also\r\nremember our putting a toad in the same box with a hedgehog? Oh! how\r\nangry he seemed, and how savagely he shook the unfortunate toad! He\r\ndid not, however, seem to like the flavour, and soon gave up the\r\nfight." Hedgehogs will certainly destroy young birds; but we must\r\nremember to set the good any animal does against the harm, and strike\r\nthe balance; and, as I said, I suspect in this case the good will\r\nlargely preponderate. Hedgehogs are extremely fond of beetles; they\r\nseize on them with great earnestness, and crack them with as much\r\ndelight as you lads crack nuts. Hedgehogs are sometimes kept in houses\r\nfor the purpose of eating the cockroaches so often abounding in\r\nkitchens. Snakes are also devoured by hedgehogs. The late Professor\r\nBuckland, having occasion to suspect that hedgehogs sometimes preyed\r\non snakes, "procured a common snake and also a hedgehog, and put them\r\nin a box together. Whether or not the latter recognised its enemy was\r\nnot apparent; it did not dart from the hedgehog, but kept creeping\r\ngently round the box. The hedgehog was rolled up, and did not appear\r\nto see the snake. The professor then laid the hedgehog on the snake,\r\nwith that part of the ball where the head and tail meet downwards, and\r\ntouching it. The snake proceeded to crawl; the hedgehog started,\r\nopened slightly, and seeing what was under it gave the snake a hard\r\nbite, and instantly rolled itself up again. It soon opened a second,\r\nand again a third time, repeating the bite. This done, the hedgehog\r\nstood by the snake\'s side, and passed the whole body of the snake\r\nsuccessively through its jaws, cracking it, and breaking the bones at\r\nintervals of half an inch or more, by which operation the snake was\r\nrendered motionless. The hedgehog then placed itself at the tip of the\r\nsnake\'s tail, and began to eat upwards, as one would eat a radish,\r\nwithout intermission, but slowly, till half of the snake was devoured.\r\nThe following morning the remaining half was also completely eaten\r\nup." When rather young these animals make very interesting pets; they\r\nsoon become tame, and will allow you to stroke their cheeks. You\r\nremember our placing a hedgehog on the study table, and seeing how it\r\ngot off on to the ground. It came to the edge, and threw itself off,\r\ncoiling up its body partly as it fell; the elastic nature of its\r\nprickly covering enabling it to bear the shock of the fall without the\r\nslightest inconvenience.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GREAT GREY SHRIKE, OR BUTCHER BIRD, WITH ITS\r\nVICTIMS--SHREWS AND BLUE TITMOUSE.]\r\n\r\nLet us go on the moors again, and watch the coots and water-hens in\r\nthe reedy pools near the aqueduct. Do you see that great tit on a\r\nbranch of this poplar? He is actually at work doing a bit of butchery\r\non a small warbler. See how he is beating the poor little fellow on\r\nthe head; he wants to get at his brains. "Are there not birds called\r\nbutcher-birds?" asked Willy, "that fix their victims on thorns, and\r\nthen peck off their flesh? Shall we see any of them?" There are three\r\nkinds of butcher-birds that have been known to come to this country.\r\nTwo kinds are very uncommon, and we are not likely to meet with any of\r\nthem in our walks. I may as well, however, tell you something about\r\nthem; but, as I have no personal knowledge of the habits of any of the\r\nspecies, I must get my information from other sources. The great grey\r\nshrike, the red-backed shrike, and the woodchat shrike, are the three\r\nspecies of the family occurring in Great Britain; the red-backed\r\nshrike is the only tolerably common one, arriving in this country\r\nlate in April, and quitting it in September. Mr. John Shaw tells me\r\nthis bird visits the quarry grounds at Shrewsbury every spring, and an\r\nearly riser, if he goes there, can see these birds readily. Mr.\r\nYarrell says that the great grey shrike is only an occasional visitor\r\nto this country, and is generally obtained between autumn and spring.\r\nIts food consists of mice, shrews, small birds, frogs, lizards, and\r\nlarge insects. "After having killed its prey, it fixes the body in a\r\nforked branch, or upon a sharp thorn, the more readily to pull off\r\nsmall pieces from it." The following remarks are by a gentleman who\r\nhad one of these birds in confinement:--"An old bird of this species,"\r\nhe says, "taken near Norwich in October, 1835, lived in my possession\r\ntwelve months. It became very tame, and would readily take its food\r\nfrom my hands. When a bird was given it, it invariably broke the\r\nskull, and generally ate the head first. It sometimes held the bird in\r\nits claws, and pulled it to pieces in the manner of hawks, but seemed\r\nto prefer forcing part of it through the wires, then pulling at it. It\r\nalways hung what it could not eat up on the sides of the cage. It\r\nwould often eat three small birds in a day. In the spring it was very\r\nnoisy, one of its notes a little resembling the cry of the kestrel."\r\nIt is a cunning as well as a bold bird. It is said that by imitating\r\nthe notes of some of the smaller birds it calls them near it, and then\r\npounces upon some deluded victim. The shrike is used by falconers\r\nabroad for trapping falcons; "it is fastened to the ground, and by\r\nscreaming loudly gives notice to the falconer, who is concealed, of\r\nthe approach of a hawk." You will notice in any picture of a shrike\r\nhow admirably adapted is its curved beak for butchering purposes. The\r\nred-backed shrike "frequents the sides of woods and high hedgerows,\r\ngenerally in pairs, and may frequently be seen perched on the\r\nuppermost branch of an isolated bush, on the look out for prey. The\r\nmales occasionally make a chirping noise, not unlike the note of the\r\nsparrow." It also imitates the voice of small birds. Mr. Yarrell says\r\n"the food of the red-backed shrike is mice, and probably shrews, small\r\nbirds, and various insects, particularly the common May-chaffer. Its\r\ninclination to attack and its power to destroy little birds has been\r\ndoubted; but it has been seen to kill a bird as large as a finch, and\r\nis not unfrequently caught in the clap-nets of London bird-catchers,\r\nhaving struck at their decoy-birds;" and Mr. Hewitson says--"Seeing a\r\nred-backed shrike busy in a hedge, I found, upon approaching it, a\r\nsmall bird, upon which it had been operating, firmly fixed upon a\r\nblunt thorn; its head was torn off, and the body entirely plucked."\r\n\r\n"What an amazing quantity of little lady-bird beetles there are on\r\nthis hedge-bank," said May. "The ground is almost red with them." Yes,\r\nit is a very common, but very pretty species. You see there are seven\r\nblack spots on its red wing-covers, three on each, arranged\r\ntriangularly, and one at the top of the wing-covers, just at the point\r\nwhere they meet. "Are these insects injurious, papa?" asked Willy;\r\n"you say there are so many insects that are. I do hope the little\r\nlady-birds do no mischief." I am happy, then, to tell you that they\r\nare as useful as they are pretty. You all know what are called\r\nplant-lice, those nasty green or black flies called Aphides, which\r\ncover the leaves or branches of so many trees and flowers, and do most\r\nterrible mischief. Well, the lady-birds, both when they are larv\xc3\xa6 and\r\nwhen they are beetles, eat these pests, and help to keep their\r\ndevastating swarms in check. I have frequently seen an aphis in the\r\nmouth of a lady-bird; and the larva, a curious six-footed grub, about\r\nthe third of an inch long, which you may often see late in the summer\r\nand the autumn, is still more fond of aphis food. Mr. Curtis says two\r\nlady-birds cleared two geranium plants of aphides in twenty-four\r\nhours. The species we are looking at is the "seven-spotted lady-bird;"\r\nthere is another very common kind, whose scarlet wing-cases have one\r\nblack spot on the centre of each. This species is subject to\r\nconsiderable variety; it is called the "two-spotted lady-bird." There\r\nis another you may often find; it is small and yellow, with eleven\r\nspots on each wing-cover. This is called the "twenty-two-spotted\r\nlady-bird;" it is an elegant little creature. It is interesting to\r\nnote how the observation of some particular animal has led naturalists\r\nto the choice of their favorite study. Mr. Gould tells us that his\r\nfirst inclination to the study of birds arose from his father having\r\nonce lifted him up to peep into a hedge-warbler\'s nest. His admiration\r\nfor the beautiful blue eggs led him to devote his time to ornithology,\r\nor the study of birds. If I remember rightly, Kirby\'s mind was\r\ndirected to the study of insects by noticing the wonderful vitality\r\nshown by a little lady-bird beetle, which, after having been immersed\r\ntwenty-four hours in spirits of wine, on being taken out actually flew\r\naway. "What is the meaning," asked Mary, "of the nursery rhyme about\r\nthe lady-bird?\r\n\r\n    Lady-bird, lady-bird, fly away home,\r\n    Your house is on fire, and your children will burn?"\r\n\r\nIndeed, I cannot tell you. There are different versions of the old\r\nsong. One runs thus:\r\n\r\n    Lady-bird, lady-bird, fly away home;\r\n    Your house is on fire, your children at home,\r\n    All but one that lives under the stone,--\r\n    Fly thee home, lady-bird, ere it be gone.\r\n\r\nIn Yorkshire and Lancashire it is--\r\n\r\n    Lady-bird, lady-bird, fly thy way home,\r\n    Thy house is on fire, thy children all roam,\r\n    Except little Nan, who sits in her pan,\r\n    Weaving gold laces as fast as she can.\r\n\r\nThe names of Lady-bird, Lady-cow, no doubt originated from the general\r\nreverence for this insect and its dedication to the Virgin Mary. In\r\nScandinavia this little beetle is called "Our Lady\'s Key-maid," in\r\nSweden "The Virgin Mary\'s Golden Hen." Similar reverence is paid in\r\nGermany, France, England, and Scotland. In Norfolk it is called Bishop\r\nBarnabee, and the young girls have the following rhyme, which they\r\ncontinue to recite to it placed on the palm of the hand, till it takes\r\nwing and flies away.\r\n\r\n    "Bishop, Bishop Barnabee,\r\n    Tell me when my wedding be;\r\n    If if be to-morrow day,\r\n    Take your wings and fly away!\r\n    Fly to the East, fly to the West,\r\n    Fly to him that I love best."\r\n\r\nThe word barnabee or burnabee, or, as Southey writes it, burnie-bee,\r\nno doubt has reference to the burnished or polished wing cases of the\r\ninsect.\r\n\r\nLet us now look out for the coots and water-hens, which love to dabble\r\namongst the weeds of these pools, and to hide amongst the hedges and\r\nbulrushes that so thickly skirt them. See how rapidly the swifts or\r\n"Jack-squealers," as the country folks call them, are gliding by; you\r\nremember when we were noticing the swallows and martins that we\r\nthought of the swifts. Look at the beautiful scythe-like form of the\r\nwings; the tail, you see, is slightly forked; but the bird has the\r\npower of bringing the feathers together, so that sometimes you cannot\r\nsee its cleft form. I generally notice swifts in the neighbourhood\r\nabout the 5th of May; this year Mr. John Shaw tells me he saw some in\r\nShrewsbury as early as the 23rd of April. Although they come to us the\r\nlast of the swallow family, they leave us the soonest. By the middle\r\nof August most of the swifts will have left us.\r\n\r\nThis bird has remarkably short legs; and I remember more than once\r\ntaking one off the ground when I was a boy at school, for unless it is\r\nraised a little above the level of the ground, it finds it very\r\ndifficult to mount upwards by reason of its extremely short legs and\r\nlong wings. If we had a swift in our hands, I could point out how it\r\ndiffered from the rest of the swallow family in the structure of its\r\nfeet; in the other members the four toes are arranged three before and\r\none behind; in the swift all the four toes are directed forwards.\r\nThere is another kind of swift, the "white-bellied swift," which has,\r\non a few occasions, been noticed in this country. It is rather larger\r\nthan the common swift, and has wings of greater length, and can fly\r\neven more rapidly. Hark! I hear the noise of a coot proceeding from\r\nthe reeds of a pond. I dare say if we keep quite still we shall get a\r\nglimpse of her. There she comes; and do look, a lot of young ones with\r\nher; little black downy things they are, as we should see were we near\r\nenough to examine them. The old birds have a naked white patch on the\r\nforehead, and are therefore called bald-coots. You can see the white\r\npatch now she faces us and the sun is shining; the body is a dingy\r\nblack tinged with dark grey; you notice a little white about the\r\nwings. The feet of the coot are curiously formed, each of the four\r\ntoes is partly webbed, having a membrane forming rounded lobes; the\r\nclaws are very sharp, and the bird does not hesitate to make use of\r\nthem if you catch hold of it carelessly; so Col. Hawker gives the\r\nfollowing caution to young sportsmen--"Beware of a winged coot, or he\r\nwill scratch you like a cat."\r\n\r\nI never saw a coot dive; and think it seldom does; water-hens, every\r\none knows, are frequent divers.\r\n\r\nThe old bird is pulling up some of the weeds of the pool for the young\r\nones; how carefully she attends to them; the heads of the little ones\r\nare nearly naked, and of a bright orange colour mixed with blue; but\r\nthis brilliant colouring lasts only a few days. The nest is made of\r\nbroken reeds and flags, and hidden amongst the tall rushes and edges\r\nin the water.\r\n\r\nBewick mentions the case of a coot having built her nest among some\r\nrushes, which were afterwards loosened by the wind, and of course the\r\nnest was driven about and floated upon the surface of the water in\r\nevery direction; notwithstanding which, the female continued to sit as\r\nusual, and brought out her young upon her movable habitation. See, now\r\nthey have all gone away to hide amongst the reeds; they like to come\r\nout into the open water late in the evening, and it is not often easy\r\nto observe them in the day-time. There are plenty of moor-hens or\r\nwater-hens in these reedy pools. They are not so peaceful as the\r\ncoots, for they have been known to attack young ducklings. There one\r\nswims, jerking up its tail, which is whitish underneath, and nodding\r\nits head; the moor-hen is a smaller bird than the coot, though\r\nresembling it both in form and habits. The feet, however, are very\r\ndifferent, for, instead of the toes being furnished with a lobed\r\nmembrane, they have a continuous narrow one down each. Moor-hens have\r\nbeen known to remove their eggs from the nest, in order to add to it,\r\nand to replace them again. Mr. Selby relates the following interesting\r\naccount:\r\n\r\n"During the early part of the summer of 1835 a pair of water-hens\r\nbuilt their nest by the margin of the ornamental pond at Bell\'s Hill,\r\na piece of water of considerable extent, and ordinarily fed by a\r\nspring from the height above, but into which the contents of another\r\nlarge pond can occasionally be admitted. This was done while the\r\nfemale was sitting; and as the nest had been built when the\r\nwater-level stood low, the sudden influx of this large body of water\r\nfrom the second pond caused a rise of several inches, so as to\r\nthreaten the speedy immersion and consequent destruction of the eggs.\r\nThis the birds seem to have been aware of, and immediately took\r\nprecaution against so imminent a danger; for when the gardener, upon\r\nwhose veracity I can safely rely, seeing the sudden rise of the water,\r\nwent to look after the nest, expecting to find it covered and the eggs\r\ndestroyed, or at least forsaken by the hen, he observed, while at a\r\ndistance, both birds busily engaged about the brink where the nest was\r\nplaced; and when near enough, he clearly perceived that they were\r\nadding, with all possible dispatch, fresh materials to raise the\r\nfabric beyond the level of the increased contents of the pond, and\r\nthat the eggs had by some means been removed from the nest by the\r\nbirds, and were then deposited upon the grass, about a foot or more\r\nfrom the margin of the water. He watched them for some time, and saw\r\nthe nest rapidly increase in height; but I regret to add that he did\r\nnot remain long enough, fearing he might create alarm, to witness the\r\ninteresting act of the replacing of the eggs, which must have been\r\neffected shortly afterwards; for upon his return in less than an hour,\r\nhe found the hen quietly sitting upon them in the newly raised nest.\r\nIn a few days afterwards the young were hatched, and, as usual, soon\r\nquitted the nest and took to the water with the parent. The nest was\r\nshown to me _in situ_ very soon afterwards, and I could then plainly\r\ndiscern the formation of the new with the old part of the fabric."\r\n\r\n"What is that little bird in the water?" asked Jack. "Oh! he is\r\nsuddenly gone; do you see the curl in the water where it dived?" It\r\nwas no doubt a dabchick, then, from your description, though I was not\r\nin time to see it before it dived; if we keep quite still and silent I\r\ndare say it will appear again. There it is, dabbling in the water in\r\nsearch of water insects that are found amongst the weeds. Another name\r\nof this bird is the little grebe; several species of grebes have been\r\nfound in this county; the great-crested grebe is a very handsome bird\r\nand frequents lakes and rivers; but of the five British grebes, the\r\nlittle dabchick is by far the most common. The feet of these birds are\r\npeculiar, the toes are not connected together by a web, as you see in\r\nducks and geese; they are, however, united at the base, and each of\r\nthe three front toes is surrounded by a broad continuous membrane; the\r\nlower part of the leg is also very flat; the legs are placed very far\r\nbackwards, so that these birds stand almost upright; the wings are\r\nshort and seldom used for flight; however, they are admirable swimmers\r\nand divers, and pretty, lively little birds. The plumage of this\r\nlittle grebe varies according to the time of year. Now, in the summer\r\nweather, the head, neck and back are a very dark brown; the cheeks and\r\nfront of the neck a rich chestnut; chin jet black; in the winter they\r\nlose this chestnut colour, and are then of a light olive-grey colour\r\nand white underneath. Formerly the two different states of the plumage\r\nwere thought to mark two different species.\r\n\r\nThe nest, as Mr. Gould tells us, is a raft of weeds and aquatic plants\r\ncarefully heaped together in a rounded form. The young ones have\r\ndelicate rose-coloured bills and harlequin-like markings on the body,\r\nand rosy-white breasts. "So active and truly aquatic is the dabchick,\r\neven when only one or two days old, that it is almost impossible to\r\nsee it in a state of nature; for immediately after the young birds are\r\nhatched, they either take to the water of their own accord, or cling\r\nwhen not more than an hour old to the backs of their parents, who dive\r\naway with them out of harm\'s way." Mr. Gould mentions that a friend of\r\nhis, when out on a fishing excursion with him, once shot a dabchick as\r\nit dived across a shallow stream; on emerging wounded, on the surface,\r\ntwo young ones clinging to the back were caught by Mr. Gould in his\r\nlanding net.\r\n\r\nSo rapid is their diving that they can often avoid the charge of a\r\ngun; they then rise again "with only the tips of their bill above\r\nwater, and even these generally concealed amongst some patch of weeds\r\nor grass." The grebes have a peculiar habit of plucking off the soft\r\nfeathers from the under side of the body and swallowing them. Why they\r\ndo so is not known.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CONVOLVULUS.]\r\n\r\n"What is this pretty pink flower," asked May, "with long trailing\r\nstems and leaves broadly arrow-shaped? From its resemblance to that\r\nbeautiful convolvulus in the garden I should think it must be a\r\nsmaller kind of that plant." You are quite right, it is a convolvulus,\r\nand its English name of Field Bindweed is expressive of the clinging\r\nhabits of this plant; see how tightly it has wrapped itself round\r\nthis tall blade of grass. Although a very pretty plant; with its pink\r\nflowers and darker plaits, its arrow-shaped leaves, and its fragrant\r\nsmell, it is a troublesome weed to the farmer. Then there is the\r\ngreater bindweed, with its large bell-blossoms sometimes white as\r\nsnow, sometimes striped with pink, sometimes almost rose-colour, so\r\noften seen growing profusely over the tallest bushes. Both kinds of\r\nbindweed, however, are mischievous weeds; the large kind you may find\r\nin flower as late as September. Some of the bindweed family, I ought\r\nto say, are valuable in medicine. There is for instance the\r\n_Convolvulus jalapa_ and _Convolvulus scammonia_, both of which are\r\nextensively used in medicine; the former a South American plant and\r\nthe latter a Syrian one. Then there is the so-called sweet-potato,\r\nwhich is the root of _Convolvulus batatas_ used in China, Japan, and\r\nother tropical countries as a wholesome food. Strange it seems that\r\nplants so closely related should differ so much in their properties.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying vignette may be supposed to represent Master Willy\r\nwatching the movements of a snail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWALK VIII.\r\n\r\nJULY.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us have another stroll on the moors. We pass over a small brook on\r\nour way, and of course stop on the bridge and gaze into the little\r\nrivulet. What do I see about four yards off in the shade? A number of\r\nsmall dark-coloured patches which I recognise at once as one of our\r\nmost beautiful fresh-water alg\xc3\xa6. We will gather some from the bottom.\r\nThere! the little tufts are attached to the upper sides of stones.\r\nWhen taken out of the water, the plant looks and feels like a mass of\r\nvery dark jelly. I will float a piece out in this bottle of water. Did\r\nyou ever see anything more beautiful? It consists of a number of\r\ndelicate branches, each arranged in a bead-like row, and from a\r\ncertain resemblance which these beaded rows bear to frog-spawn, as\r\nwell as from their jelly-like consistency, this alga has received the\r\nname of _Batrachospermum_, which means "frogs\' spawn." If we take a\r\nbit home and spread it out carefully on a piece of drying paper,\r\nseparating the numerous beaded branches one from the other with the\r\npoint of a needle, and leave it to dry gradually, we shall get a very\r\npretty object indeed. As you may suppose, the plant is a most charming\r\nobject for the microscope. "Do you think," asked Willy, "it would do\r\nin my aquarium?" I have several times tried it in an aquarium; it\r\nwould live for a few days, then gradually lose colour and break to\r\npieces. The fact is that, as Dr. Hassall says, these plants "inhabit\r\nmostly pure and running waters, being usually met with in fountains,\r\nwells, and streams, the force of which is not considerable." The\r\nfrog-spawn alga, therefore, will not thrive in any but the purest\r\nwater, and a gentle flow is necessary to its growth and health. "These\r\nplants are so exceedingly flexible," Dr. Hassall continues, "that they\r\nobey the slightest motion of the fluid which surrounds them, and would\r\nseem almost to be endowed with vitality; nothing can surpass the ease\r\nand grace of their movements. When removed from the water they lose\r\nall form, and appear like pieces of jelly without trace of\r\norganization. On immersion, however, the branches again quickly resume\r\ntheir former disposition. They adhere strongly to paper, and in drying\r\nfrequently change to some other tint usually much deeper; on being\r\nmoistened after long intervals they recover much of their original\r\nfreshness; and it is even asserted that, after having lain in the\r\nherbarium for some years, when they are replaced in water in a\r\nsuitable locality, they will vegetate as before." This last assertion\r\nI must say I do not credit. I shall never forget the delight I felt\r\nwhen I first made the acquaintance of this curious and graceful alga.\r\nFrom the eyes of how many people are its charms hidden! It is only\r\nthose that look closely that would notice the little jelly-like tufts\r\ngrowing modestly in shaded places for the most part. This species,\r\nhowever, is common enough in gently flowing and shallow streams, and\r\nwe may often come across it in our rambles if we take the trouble to\r\nuse our eyes. There are other extremely beautiful forms of fresh-water\r\nalg\xc3\xa6.\r\n\r\nHere in this same stream are the long green threads of _Cladophora\r\nglomerata_. I use as few hard words as possible, but I cannot help\r\nusing them sometimes, as many objects have no English names. This alga\r\nis also attached to stones and floats out with the current sometimes\r\ntwo feet in length; and, like the frog-spawn alga, is fond of pure\r\nwater, but I have often kept the _Cladophora_ alive in perfect health\r\nin an aquarium for weeks together. Its deep refreshing green colour\r\nand graceful form make it a very desirable acquisition for the\r\naquarium. I break off a small bit. Now see its beautifully branched\r\nform. Do you remember a round green ball about the size of a small\r\napple which I have at home? Well, that ball, which came from\r\nEllesmere, is nothing else than a mass of this same _Cladophora_. Dr.\r\nHassall is no doubt correct in his explanation of the formation of\r\nthese balls. He says, "This state of _Cladophora glomerata_ I believe\r\nto be formed as follows: A specimen by the force of some mountain\r\nstream swollen by recent rains becomes forced from its attachment; as\r\nit is carried along by the current, it is made to revolve repeatedly\r\nupon itself, until at last a compact ball is formed of it, which\r\nfinally becomes deposited in some basin or reservoir in which the\r\nstream loses itself, and in which these balls are usually found." Here\r\nare some specimens in the water of a rich brown colour instead of\r\ngreen. This is caused by the growth of other alg\xc3\xa6 over its long\r\nbranches. See! I shake a bit in my bottle, and you see a quantity of\r\nbrown deposit comes off, showing the green threads of the _Cladophora_\r\nunderneath. This brown deposit looks to you, I dare say, very\r\nuninteresting. I will show you some under the microscope when we get\r\nhome, and you will see many extremely beautiful forms. These are known\r\nby the name of _Diatomace\xc3\xa6_ and _Desmidi\xc3\xa6_. I will not tell you more\r\nof them at present; but a picture which I will show you will give you\r\nthe forms of some of these microscopic plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRESH-WATER ALG\xc3\x86, DESMIDE\xc3\x86, AND DIATOMACE\xc3\x86.\r\n\r\nAll highly magnified.\r\n\r\n    1.--Staurastrum.\r\n    2.--Trigonocystis.\r\n    3.--Euastrum.\r\n    4.--Closterium.\r\n    5.--Diatoma.\r\n    6, 7.--Meridion.\r\n    8.--Eunotia.\r\n    9.--Exilaria.]\r\n\r\nHere we are once more on the wild moors. There is really nothing very\r\n"wild" about them now; cultivation has turned them into excellent\r\npasturage; the epithet, too, is a corruption of weald, signifying a\r\nwood. But this whole district, extending from Longdon-upon-Tern to\r\nAqualate, was once, there can be no doubt, covered with water. Perhaps\r\nit was the bed of a large lake a great many years ago; the soil, you\r\nsee, is composed of peat varying in thickness in different parts, and\r\nbelow the peat is often found sand and pebbles, which looks as if it\r\nwas once the bottom of a vast lake ten miles or more long, and three\r\nbroad. The village of Kinnersly was evidently once an island, and you\r\ncan now see the moors extending all around it. Once, then, the whole\r\ndistrict was covered with water, but about 200 years ago it was\r\ncovered with wood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: KESTREL.]\r\n\r\n"Oh! papa, did you see that?" said Jack. "A hawk pounced upon a small\r\nbird and has taken him to that fir tree, where he is eating him." It\r\nis a kestril; one of the commonest of the British hawks, and which\r\nwe may often see in this district; though I am afraid those\r\ndestructive animals called gamekeepers will in time succeed in\r\ndestroying every hawk in the neighbourhood. "Well, but, papa," said\r\nWilly, "do they not do a great deal of harm to young partridges and\r\npheasants, and of course the gamekeeper will not stand that?" I dare\r\nsay; indeed I have no doubt that a kestril will occasionally seize\r\nupon a young partridge, but it is also certain that mice form the\r\nprincipal part of its food. Remains of mice, shrews, beetles, lizards,\r\nhave been found in the kestril\'s stomach, and I am sure it would be a\r\ngreat pity to seek to exterminate this handsome and attractive bird.\r\n"Is this the hawk that you very often see hovering steadily in the\r\nair over one spot?" asked May. Yes, it is, and from this habit it has\r\ngot the name of windhover; the outspread tail is suspended and the\r\nhead always points in the direction of the wind. The sparrow-hawk I\r\noccasionally see, and now and then the merlin, a beautiful little\r\nfellow and of great courage; the sparrow-hawk is a much greater enemy\r\nto young birds than the kestril, and ought not to be allowed to\r\nincrease where game or poultry are reared, for so bold are these birds\r\nthat they will not unfrequently skim over a poultry yard, seize a\r\nyoung chicken and carry it off. Have you never heard the cry of terror\r\nan old hen utters when a hawk is seen in the air near her little\r\nbrood?\r\n\r\nMr. Gould gives us the following anecdote of a sparrow-hawk as related\r\nto him by a friend:--\r\n\r\n"Three or four years since I was driving towards Dover, when suddenly\r\na sparrow-hawk, with a stoop like a falcon\'s, struck a lark close to\r\nmy horse\'s head. The lark fell as a grouse or a partridge will fall to\r\na falcon or tiercel, and the sparrow-hawk did not attempt to carry,\r\nbut held on his way. I jumped down and picked up the body of the lark\r\nand the head; the two being entirely disunited. The velocity and force\r\nof the stoop must have been tremendous. I have often seen grouse and\r\npartridges ripped up the back and neck, and the skull laid bare, but I\r\nnever saw a head taken clean off before." A sparrow-hawk has been\r\nknown to pursue a finch between the legs of a man, and to dash through\r\na window-pane with the intention of seizing some cage-bird.\r\n\r\n"What was that very large bird, papa," said Willy, "that you noticed\r\nnear Eyton last November? It was one of the hawk family, was it not?"\r\nYes; I have no doubt it was the common buzzard, though it would not\r\nallow me to get very near it; but I watched it at a distance for some\r\ntime. It would remain on a tree for some time, and then take a slow\r\nflight away, returning again to some tree. Buzzards are not nearly\r\nsuch active fliers and bold birds as the smaller kinds of hawks.\r\nThough I said it was the common buzzard, you must not suppose that\r\nthis bird is really common; it is called common as being the species\r\nmost frequently seen in this country. Mr. Yarrell, in his book on\r\n\'British Birds,\' has given the figure of a buzzard nursing and feeding\r\na brood of young chickens. Is not that a curious thing?\r\n\r\nHe says, "The extreme partiality of the common buzzard to the seasonal\r\ntask of incubation and rearing young birds has been exemplified in\r\nvarious instances. A few years back, a female buzzard, kept in the\r\ngarden of the Chequers Inn, at Uxbridge, showed an inclination to sit\r\nby collecting and bending all the loose sticks she could gain\r\npossession of. Her owner, noticing her actions, supplied her with\r\nmaterials. She completed her nest and sat on two hens\' eggs, which she\r\nhatched, and afterwards reared the young. Since then she has hatched\r\nand brought up a brood of chickens every year.\r\n\r\n"She indicates her desire to sit by scratching holes in the ground,\r\nand breaking and tearing everything within her reach. One summer, in\r\norder to save her the fatigue of sitting, some young chickens just\r\nhatched were put down to her, but she destroyed the whole. Her\r\nfamily, in June, 1839, consisted of nine, the original number was ten,\r\nbut one had been lost. When flesh was given to her, she was very\r\nassiduous in tearing and offering it as food to her nurselings, and\r\nappeared uneasy if, after taking small portions from her, they turned\r\naway to pick up grain."\r\n\r\nWhat is this little mouse-like thing in the grass? how quickly it\r\nruns. Now I have got him. No! off again; burrowing under the\r\ngrass-roots. Now I have him safe enough; he cannot bite me with this\r\nglove on. Look at the little rogue, with his soft short silky fur and\r\nlong nose. See how flexible that pointed nose is; how useful in\r\ngrubbing amongst the closest herbage, or under the surface of the\r\nsoil. How sharp are the little creature\'s teeth. With them he eats\r\nworms and the larv\xc3\xa6 of various kinds of insects. Well, what is its\r\nname? It is the common shrew, and though the form of the body is\r\nmouse-shaped, it is, properly speaking, not a mouse at all, being much\r\nmore nearly related to the mole. It is said that shrews are very fond\r\nof fighting, and that if two be confined together in a box, the\r\nstronger will conquer the weaker and then eat him. Moles are said to\r\neat their small relatives, but I have never had any evidence of the\r\nfact, though it is probable enough. May wanted to know whether cats\r\neat shrews. I have often tried cats with dead shrews, and have always\r\nfound they will not touch them. I dare say, however, they would kill\r\nthem. The smell of the shrew is certainly unpleasant, as you may find\r\nout from this little fellow I hold in my hand. Mind he does not bite\r\nyour nose. Now we have examined him I shall let him go. It is no\r\npleasure to take an animal\'s life, and as this little shrew does no\r\nharm but good by destroying insect larv\xc3\xa6, it would be a shame to hurt\r\nhim. Where injurious creatures must be killed, let us always be\r\ncareful to take away life so as to cause the least possible pain. Now,\r\nwould any of you have ever thought that the little shrew I have just\r\nreleased had ever been supposed to be one of the most dangerous\r\nenemies to cattle? This was really once believed by our ancestors, who\r\nthought that a shrew, by running over the backs of cattle, made them\r\nweak in the loins, and that its bite made a beast swell at the heart\r\nand die. Absurd as was the belief, the supposed cure for the injury\r\nwas, if possible, still more ridiculous. It consisted in passing over\r\nthe cow\'s back the twigs of a shrew ash. "Now a shrew ash," says\r\nGilbert White, "is an ash whose twigs or branches when applied to the\r\nlimbs of cattle will immediately relieve the pains which a beast\r\nsuffers from the running of a shrew-mouse over the part affected, for\r\nit is supposed that a shrew-mouse is of so baneful and deleterious a\r\nnature, that wherever it creeps over a beast, be it horse, cow, or\r\nsheep, the suffering animal is afflicted with cruel anguish and\r\nthreatened with the loss of the use of the limb. Against this\r\naccident, to which they were continually liable, our provident\r\nforefathers always kept a shrew ash at hand which, when once\r\nmedicated, would maintain its virtue for ever. A shrew ash was made\r\nthus: into the body of the tree a deep hole was bored with an auger,\r\nand a poor devoted shrew-mouse was thrust in alive, and plugged in,\r\nno doubt with several quaint incantations long since forgotten." It is\r\nmarvellous how people could ever have believed such stuff; but equal\r\nabsurdities are still accepted by many people to this very day; so\r\nstrong a hold on men\'s minds have the kindred vices of superstition\r\nand ignorance.\r\n\r\nLook at these spiders\' webs on this hawthorn hedge, they are formed of\r\ndelicate silken threads, and are of a long funnel shape; the spider\r\noccupies the bottom part and soon rushes up should any insect get into\r\nthe trap, and quickly rushes down and escapes at the back door if your\r\nhand enters the front. The top of the funnel is spread out into large\r\nbroad sheets, and the whole snare is attached by silken cords to the\r\ntwigs of the bushes. This is the snare and residence of a good-sized\r\nspecies, the _Agelena labyrinthica_. Such webs are common on hedges,\r\non grass, heath, and gorse. Now you must distinguish between spiders\'\r\nnests and spiders\' snares. The very common wheel-like webs, which you\r\nsee abundantly on hedges, are snares or traps for insects, and\r\nbeautiful they look on a dewy morning all strung with liquid pearls.\r\nHere under this oak are a number of old acorn-cups of last autumn\'s\r\nproduce; the acorns have fallen out and the black cups remain. Do you\r\nsee a delicate spider\'s web filling this cup; inside are a quantity of\r\ntiny round eggs, and a small spider is keeping guard within; this is a\r\nspider\'s nest. Many spiders spin cocoons for their little round eggs,\r\nplace them in various situations, and leave them; others show the\r\ngreatest care for them and carry them about wherever they go. The\r\ncocoons of the species whose web or trap we are now looking at are\r\nmade of strong white silk, each cocoon containing perhaps 100 round\r\neggs, rather yellowish in colour. They are fastened to the inside of a\r\nweb the spider spins by means of silken pillars formed by a number of\r\nthreads closely glued together. The sac containing the cocoons is\r\nfastened to stems of grass or other objects, and partially hidden by a\r\nfew withered leaves. "For the purpose of securing their prey," says\r\nMr. Blackwall, the author of a splendid work on \'British Spiders,\'\r\n"spiders have recourse to divers expedients. Numerous species run\r\nrapidly about in quest of those objects which constitute their food;\r\nothers, approaching their victims with great circumspection, spring\r\nupon them from a distance; some lie concealed in flowers or among\r\nleaves, seizing such insects as come within their reach; and many\r\nspecies procure a supply of nutriment by means of complicated snares\r\nof their own fabrication." Of these snares the most beautiful, as I\r\nsaid, are the "wheel within wheel" nets of the various species of the\r\nfamily _Ep\xc3\xabirid\xc3\xa6_. "What are those spider-like things," asked Willy,\r\n"with long thin bodies, you often see skating along the water? they\r\nare something like the spiders." They are not spiders at all, but\r\ninsects called "water-measurers," from their peculiar habit of taking\r\na short skate on the surface of the water and then stopping; having\r\nmeasured that distance, off they go again. However, many spiders do\r\nrun along on the surface of the water, and you know there is one, the\r\ngreat water-spider, that lives habitually in it. Some years ago I had\r\none of these water-spiders in a glass vessel of water, and saw it spin\r\nits curious dome-shaped web which it attached to the sides of the\r\nglass and some weeds. These domes are formed of closely woven white\r\nsilk, in the form of a diving bell or half a pigeon\'s egg, as De Geer\r\nhas said, with the opening below. It looks like a half-ball of silver;\r\nthis appearance is due to a quantity of air. It is, in fact, a huge\r\nair-bubble surrounded by a covering of white silk, and, as you may\r\nsuppose, a very interesting and pretty object. Within this silver dome\r\nthe spider places her eggs, perhaps a hundred or more in number, which\r\nare enveloped in a cocoon, this being attached to the inner side of\r\nthe dome. "But how," said Jack, "is the bubble formed? Where does the\r\nair come from?" You have asked a very interesting question, and one\r\nwhich can be answered; for the question was set at rest by Mr. Bell,\r\nan excellent observer and well-known naturalist, about twelve years\r\nago, if I remember rightly. He found that the old spider actually took\r\nthe air down with her from the surface of the water, and deposited it\r\nin her domed house. I shall now quote Mr. Bell\'s words: "The manner in\r\nwhich the animal possesses itself of the bubble of air is very\r\ncurious, and, as far as I know, has never been exactly described. It\r\nascends to the surface slowly, assisted by a thread attached to a leaf\r\nor other support below and to the surface of the water. As soon as it\r\ncomes near the surface it turns with the extremity of the abdomen\r\nupwards, and exposes a portion of the body to the air for an instant,\r\nthen with a jerk it snatches, as it were, a bubble of air, which is\r\nnot only attached to the hairs which cover the abdomen, but is held on\r\nby the two hinder legs, which are crossed at an acute angle near their\r\nextremity; this crossing of the legs taking place at the instant the\r\nbubble is seized. The little creature then descends more rapidly and\r\nregains its cell, always by the same route, turns the abdomen within\r\nit, and disengages the bubble." Spiders have strong jaws; at the\r\nbottom of each hooked jaw there is a small sac which contains a\r\npoisonous fluid; this fluid is conveyed by a narrow channel from the\r\nsac along the jaw, and is pressed out at an opening or slit at the tip\r\nof the fang into the wound inflicted on its victim. The feet of\r\nspiders are generally terminated by two or more claws furnished with\r\nteeth; by means of these combs the animal is enabled to manage the\r\nthreads of its web with great dexterity and efficiency.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPIDER\'S FANG, MAGNIFIED.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SPIDER\'S FOOT, MAGNIFIED.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWALK IX.\r\n\r\nJULY.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us be off to the fields once more; the sun is very hot, but we can\r\nfind refreshing shade under the trees when we are tired. What is this\r\nbeautiful little plant with bright scarlet flowers fully expanded? It\r\nis the scarlet pimpernel, or "poor man\'s weather-glass;" for on rainy\r\ndays, and even before the showers are coming, the little plant,\r\nconscious of their approach, closes up its flowers. Other wild\r\nflowers, such as the convolvulus, close before rain. The little\r\npimpernel, however, is supposed to be the best barometer. There is\r\nanother thing about the pimpernel; you will not often see its blossoms\r\nexpanded after three o\'clock in the afternoon. In other countries,\r\nalso, the regular closing of the flowers has been noticed. Dr. Seeman,\r\nwho went as naturalist on one of the Arctic Expeditions, noticed the\r\nflowers to close during the long day of an arctic summer. "Although,"\r\nhe says, "the sun never sets while it lasts, the plants make no\r\nmistake about the time, when if it be not night it ought to be, but\r\nregularly as the evening hours approach, and when a midnight sun is\r\nseveral degrees above the horizon, they droop their leaves, and sleep\r\neven as they do at sunset in more favoured climes." Look at the\r\nbright scarlet flower, with its small purple eye. Excepting poppies,\r\nwith their dazzling brightness, I do not think there is another wild\r\nflower that has scarlet petals. However, the blossoms are not always\r\nscarlet; there is a white variety with a purple eye, and another\r\nhaving a dark blue blossom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCARLET PIMPERNEL.]\r\n\r\nWell, Jack, you have found something, have you? Ah! this is a queer\r\nplant, it has queer habits, and a queer name; it is called\r\n"Jack-go-to-bed at noon." We sometimes call you after the name of\r\nanother plant, "Jack-by-the-hedge." May, of course, is "May," or\r\nhawthorn blossom, and Robin at home, from his often tearing his\r\nclothes, is "Ragged Robin." Another name for the plant you hold in\r\nyour hand is goat\'s beard; the leaves are long and grass-like, the\r\nflowers bright yellow; it is not yet quite eleven o\'clock, and the\r\nblossoms are expanded; they generally close about noon. Look at the\r\ncolour of the stem, it has a kind of sea-green bloom upon it. Well,\r\nyou would never find this plant with blossom expanded in the\r\nafternoon; so "Jack-go-to-bed at noon" is really not a bad name for\r\nit.\r\n\r\n    "And goodly now the noon-tide hour\r\n    When from his high meridian tower\r\n    The sun looks down in majesty.\r\n    What time about the grassy lea\r\n    The goat\'s-beard prompt his rise to hail\r\n    With broad expanded disc, in veil\r\n    Close mantling wraps its yellow head,\r\n    And goes, as peasants say, to bed."\r\n\r\nHere we are at a stream; do you see those things at the bottom slowly\r\nmoving? They seem to be bits of stick. "I know what they are," said\r\nJack, "there is a good fat maggot in each of these cases; they are\r\ncaddis-worms." Quite right, and in time they will change to insects.\r\nHere is another kind; the house is made of small bits of gravel, and\r\nit is attached to this smooth stone. I will break open the case; do\r\nyou see inside is a long cylindrical case, with a thin covering; I\r\nslit this open with my penknife, and now you see the creature inside.\r\nThere are a great variety of these caddis-worms, and most interesting\r\nit is to notice the different kind of houses they build. Some of the\r\nlarv\xc3\xa6 live in movable cases, as we have seen, some in fixed\r\nhabitations; the materials, too, out of which the different cases are\r\nconstructed, are different, sometimes they are bits of gravel, or\r\nsand, wood, leaves, grass, the empty shells of various fresh-water\r\nmolluscs. The fragments of stick and the small bits of gravel are held\r\ntogether by a kind of cement which the larva spins from his mouth.\r\nSometimes we may meet with cases made of sand, having on either side\r\nlong slender bits of rush or stick. A lady once took a number of the\r\nlarv\xc3\xa6 out of their cases, and placed them in a vessel of water with\r\nvarious materials, such as coloured glass, cornelian, agate, onyx,\r\nbrass filings, coralline, tortoiseshell; and these little maggoty\r\nthings made use of and built their houses out of them. The perfect\r\ninsect has four wings; and from these being closely covered with\r\nhairs, the order to which they belong has received the name of\r\n_Trichoptera_, which means "having hairy wings." You must know many of\r\nthese insects; they are very common near ponds and streams; generally\r\nthey fly in a zig-zag fashion, and have the appearance of moths.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _a, b, c, d._ Larva, cocoon, nympha, and insect of\r\nCaddis-fly.]\r\n\r\nAh! here is a splendid bed of the forget-me-not growing on this bank\r\nnear the stream. Look at the blue enamel-like flowers, each with a\r\nyellow centre-eye; the leaves are bright green and rather rough. There\r\nare other species very much resembling this one you may often see in\r\nhedgerows and fields; but they are generally smaller plants; this one\r\nis the true forget-me-not. There are several stories about the origin\r\nof the name. Here is one:--Many years ago, a lady and knight were\r\nwandering by a river; the lady espied these bright blue flowers, on a\r\nsmall islet I suppose, in the deep river, and wished to possess them.\r\nHer lover immediately plunged in and plucked the plants, but the\r\nstrength of the stream was too much for him on his return. With a\r\ngreat effort, however, he threw the flowers on the bank, exclaiming\r\n"Forget-me-not," and sank!\r\n\r\n    "But the lady fair of the knight so true\r\n      Still remember\'d his hapless lot;\r\n    And she cherish\'d the flower of brilliant hue\r\n    And she braided her hair with the blossoms blue,\r\n      And she call\'d it \'Forget-me-not.\'"\r\n\r\nWe must proceed on our walk and not linger too long here, though, I\r\nmust own, it is hard to tear oneself away from the banks of a\r\ngently-flowing river. So good-by to\r\n\r\n    "That blue and bright-eyed flowret of the brook,\r\n    Hope\'s gentle gem, the sweet \'Forget-me-not.\'"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOLDFINCH.]\r\n\r\nAs we crossed the road we met two men with cage-traps, and a slender\r\ntwig covered thickly with bird-lime. In each cage-trap was a tame\r\ngoldfinch, which were the decoy birds. The men had only succeeded in\r\ntaking one goldfinch--for which they asked half a crown. The decoy\r\nbirds attract other goldfinches by their call-note; these sometimes\r\nalight on the trap, which instantly closes upon them; sometimes they\r\nalight on the twig smeared with bird-lime, which is so sticky that\r\nthey cannot free themselves from it. "Gay plumage, lively habits, an\r\nagreeable form and song, with a disposition to become attached to\r\nthose who feed them, are such strong recommendations, that the\r\ngoldfinch has been, and will probably continue to be, one of the most\r\ngeneral cage favourites. So well also do the birds of this species\r\nbear confinement, that they have been known to live ten years in\r\ncaptivity, continuing in song the greater part of each year. This\r\ntendency to sing and call make them valuable as brace-birds,\r\ndecoy-birds, and call-birds, to be used by the birdcatcher with his\r\nground nets, while the facility with which others are captured, the\r\nnumbers to be obtained, and the constant demand for them by the\r\npublic, render the goldfinch one of the most important species\r\nincluded within the bird-dealer\'s traffic."\r\n\r\nMr. Mayhew says that a goldfinch has been known to exist twenty-three\r\nyears in a cage. The same person tells us that goldfinches are sold in\r\nthe streets of London from sixpence to a shilling each, and when there\r\nis an extra catch, and the shops are fully stocked, at threepence and\r\nfourpence each. Only think, it is computed that as many as 70,000 song\r\nbirds are captured every year about London; the street sale of the\r\ngoldfinch being about a tenth of the whole. Goldfinches may be taught\r\nto perform many amusing tricks, to draw up water for themselves by a\r\nsmall thimble-sized bucket, or to raise the lid of a small box to\r\nobtain the seed within. A goldfinch has been trained to appear dead;\r\nit could be held up by the tail or claw without exhibiting any signs\r\nof life, or to stand on its head with its claws in the air, or to\r\nimitate a Dutch milk-maid going to market with pails on its shoulders,\r\nor to appear as a soldier, keeping guard as sentinel. One was once\r\ntrained to act as a cannoneer with a cap on its head, a firelock on\r\nits shoulder, and a match in its claw; it would then discharge a small\r\ncannon. "The same bird also acted as if it had been wounded. It was\r\nwheeled in a barrow, to convey it, as it were, to the hospital; after\r\nwhich it flew away before the company." Another turned a kind of\r\nwindmill; another stood in the midst of some fireworks, which were\r\ndischarged all around it, without showing any fear. When we consider\r\nhow docile and affectionate many birds become; when we think of their\r\nbeauty and the sweet music they pour from their little throats; when\r\nwe consider also of what immense use a great number of species are to\r\nman in helping to check injurious insects and caterpillars; does it\r\nnot seem strange that they meet with so little protection? How often,\r\nas you know, we have met lads and great strong men with helpless\r\nfledglings in their hands, which they intend to torture in some way or\r\nother; perhaps they will tie strings to their legs and drag them\r\nabout, or place them on a large stone and throw at them. To\r\nexpostulate with them on the wickedness of such barbarous conduct is\r\nhopeless; one might as well quote Hebrew to a tadpole!\r\n\r\nHow noisy the grasshoppers are, with their incessant shrill chirpings;\r\nhow thoroughly they enjoy the heat and sun! Just catch me one or two,\r\nWilly; there, one has hopped just before you; now he is on that blade\r\nof grass. Have you got him? No? Well, take this gauze net. Now you\r\nhave him. "How does the grasshopper make that peculiar sound?" asked\r\nMay. If you will get near one of these insects while he is making the\r\nnoise you will see how he does it. There, one stands on that plantain\r\nstem. Do you see how briskly he rubs his legs against the wing-covers?\r\nNow he is quiet, and his legs are still; so it is evident that the\r\nfriction or rubbing of the legs against the wings causes the sound. I\r\nrub the thigh of this specimen I hold in my hands against the wing.\r\nYou distinctly hear the shrill sound. It is the males only who make\r\nthe noise; the females are mute. Some people have described another\r\norgan which seems to increase the sound. I have sometimes placed both\r\nfield-crickets and grasshoppers under a tumbler, and supplied them\r\nwith moist blades of grass; it is curious to see how fast they eat\r\nthem. You should remember that the grasshopper is a relative of the\r\nlocust, to which, indeed, it bears a close resemblance; only the\r\nlocust is a much larger insect. There are several species of locusts,\r\nand all are extremely injurious. You have read in the Bible of the\r\nfearful damage they are able to cause to the trees and various crops.\r\nIt is seldom that locusts visit this country, happily, for there is\r\nnot a greater insect scourge in existence. Our green grasshopper is\r\nalso related to the cricket, so merrily noisy in dwelling-houses.\r\nCrickets are difficult to get rid of when they have thoroughly\r\nestablished themselves in a house. Like many noisy persons, crickets\r\nlike to hear nobody louder than themselves; and some one relates that\r\na woman who had tried in vain every method she could think of to\r\nbanish them from her house, at last got rid of them by the noise made\r\nby drums and trumpets, which she had procured to entertain her guests\r\nat a wedding. It is said, but you need not believe the story, that\r\nthey instantly forsook the house, and the woman heard of them no more.\r\nPossibly some half dozen more women in the house would have had the\r\nsame effect, without the musical instruments! What do you say to that\r\nidea, May? "That is too bad of you, papa, but you know you are only\r\njoking."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _a, b, c._ Leg, wing-cover, and wing of Grasshopper,\r\nmagnified.]\r\n\r\nHere is a large pond, and from this bank we can look down into the\r\nwater. There are some yellow water-lilies with their broad expanded\r\nleaves. I have noticed that the blossoms are often attacked by the\r\nlarv\xc3\xa6 of some two-winged flies. These flies lay their eggs within the\r\npetals, "lily-cradled" literally; the eggs hatch and the larv\xc3\xa6 eat the\r\ncradle. I do not know more of these flies: I have often meant to trace\r\ntheir history, but have somehow forgotten to do so. Do you see that\r\npike basking on the top of the water; how still and motionless he\r\nlies. He is a good-sized fish, at least I should say he was four\r\npounds weight. "I wish we could catch him," said Willy. We have no\r\ntackle with us; besides, when pike are sunning themselves in that way\r\non the top of the water, they are seldom inclined to take a bait.\r\n"What is the largest pike," asked Jack, "you ever saw caught?" The\r\nlargest I ever saw alive was caught in the canal about five years ago;\r\nit weighed twenty-one pounds, and was really a splendid fish. What\r\nvoracious fish they are; they will often take young ducks, water-hens\r\nand coots, and will sometimes try to swallow a fish much too large for\r\ntheir throats. It is said that a pike once seized the head of a swan\r\nas she was feeding under water, and gorged so much of it as killed\r\nthem both. The servants perceiving the swan with its head under water\r\nfor a longer time than usual, took the boat and found both swan and\r\npike dead. "Gesner relates that a pike in the Rhone seized on the lips\r\nof a mule that was brought to water, and that the beast drew the fish\r\nout before it could disengage itself. Walton was assured by his friend\r\nMr. Segrave, who kept tame otters, that he had known a pike, in\r\nextreme hunger, fight with one of his otters for a carp that the otter\r\nhad caught and was then bringing out of the water. A woman in Poland\r\nhad her foot seized by a pike as she was washing clothes in a pond."\r\nMr. Jesse tells the story of a gentleman, who, as he was one day\r\nwalking by the side of the river Wey, saw a large pike in a shallow\r\ncreek. He immediately pulled off his coat, tucked up his shirt\r\nsleeves, and went into the water to intercept the return of the fish\r\nto the river, and to endeavour to throw it out upon the bank by\r\ngetting his hands under it. During this attempt the pike, finding he\r\ncould not make his escape, seized one of the arms of the gentleman,\r\nand lacerated it so much that the marks of the wound were visible for\r\na long time afterwards. Pike will live to a great age, ninety years\r\nor more. In the year 1497, according to old Gesner, a pike was taken\r\nat Halibrun in Suabia with a brazen ring attached to it, on which was\r\nthe following inscription in Greek:--"I am the fish which was put into\r\nthe lake by the hands of the governor of the universe, Frederick the\r\nSecond, the 5th of October, 1230." This pike, therefore, would be two\r\nhundred and sixty-seven years old; people said it weighed three\r\nhundred and fifty pounds, and that its skeleton was nineteen feet\r\nlong. I will show you a picture of this ring in Gesner\'s book when we\r\nget home.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWALK X.\r\n\r\nOCTOBER.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow pleasant is the season of autumn, with its yellow fields of ripe\r\ncorn, and its orchards laden with the fruits of the apple and the\r\npear. But now the golden grain is safely stored. The birds, too, have\r\ndone singing, with the exception of the robin and the hedge-warbler,\r\nwhich even in the winter occasionally cheer us with their welcome\r\nnotes. There are yet, however, a few wild flowers to interest us, and\r\nthe ferns are still beautiful. The various kinds of fungi are\r\nspringing up in the fields and woodlands; it is a charming day for a\r\nstroll; we will drive to the Wrekin and explore the woods at its base.\r\nI am sure we shall be able to meet with many pretty forms. The woods\r\nare rendered extremely beautiful by the rich autumnal tints of the\r\nfoliage. We will go through this wicket and follow the path in the\r\ndirection of Ten-Tree Hill. Now, who will be the first to find the\r\nbright scarlet fly agaric? It is a poisonous species, though so\r\nbeautiful. We will put the wholesome fungi in one basket and the\r\nsuspected ones in another.\r\n\r\nHere you see is the elegant parasol fungus, with its tall stem and top\r\nspotted with brown flakes; it is a most delicious one to eat, and in\r\nmy opinion is superior to the common mushroom. "Shall we find the\r\nbeefsteak fungus, papa?" said Willy. I have never seen it growing\r\nhere; the beefsteak fungus prefers to grow on very old oak trees, and\r\nit is, moreover, by no means common. It is so called from its\r\nresemblance to a beefsteak when cut through; a reddish gravy-like\r\njuice flows from the wound, and I think the whole fungus when young\r\nvery inviting. I have on three or four occasions eaten this species,\r\nbut I do not think it a very palatable one, though perfectly wholesome\r\nand doubtless nutritious.\r\n\r\nHere is a quantity of _Amanita phalloides_, very beautiful with its\r\ngreen tints and white stem; but I should not like to eat any of this\r\nkind. Do you notice what a very unpleasant smell it has?\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FUNGI.\r\n\r\n    1.--Beef-steak Fungus.\r\n    2.--Latticed Stinkhorn, (very rare.)\r\n    3.--Boletus.\r\n    4.--Hedgehog Mushroom.\r\n    5.--Fly Agaric.\r\n    6.--Clavaria.\r\n    7.--Bird\'s-nest Fungus; b, Sporangium of ditto, magnified.]\r\n\r\nWhat a number of animals are nailed to that beech-tree! Let us see\r\nwhat they are: two cats, three weasels, two stoats, four jays, two\r\nmagpies, two kestrils, an owl, and a sparrow-hawk. The keeper has\r\ntrapped or shot these as enemies to the game, and no doubt, with the\r\nexception of the weasels, owl, and kestrils, the other animals often\r\ndestroy young pheasants or suck their eggs. Still I should not like to\r\nsee all wild animals destroyed that occasionally harm game preserves.\r\nGamekeepers have strong affection for their hares, partridges, and\r\npheasants, and consider all other wild animals as either enemies or\r\nbeneath notice. Indeed, a gamekeeper\'s zoology is confined to five\r\nthings--pheasants, partridges, hares, rabbits, and ants\' eggs. Ah! I\r\ndo think I espy about twenty yards ahead the fly agaric (_Amanita\r\nmuscaria_). To be sure, here is a fine lot; some just appearing\r\nabove ground in the form of scarlet balls; others fully expanded. How\r\nsplendid they are! You notice many white patches on their tops; let us\r\nsee how these patches are formed. Here is a specimen hardly showing\r\nitself. I will dig it up. There, now you see; the whole fungus is\r\nwrapped up in a thin white envelope; this is called a _volva_, from\r\nthe Latin word volvo--"I roll up." When the _volva_ breaks, it leaves\r\nscattered patches on the top. The gills are white or yellowish and the\r\nstem is bulbous. This is not a very common fungus; it is, however,\r\nfrequent enough in the woods about the Wrekin. The effects of this\r\nfungus on a person who has eaten it are of an intoxicating nature. Dr.\r\nBadham, who used to eat various kinds of fungi and has written a very\r\ngood book on wholesome kinds, once gathered some specimens of the fly\r\nagaric. He sent them to two lady friends, intending to call soon\r\nafterwards and explain that he had sent them on account of their\r\nextreme beauty solely. Dr. Badham did not come, but these two ladies\r\nsaid, "Oh, of course Dr. Badham would never send us anything\r\nunwholesome; let us have some cooked for tea." So they had some cooked\r\nand ate thereof, and were taken very ill. The bad effects, however,\r\nsoon passed away. Look at that little squirrel, see how nimbly he\r\nclimbs the tree; now he hides on a forked branch and thinks we do not\r\nsee him. Well, I must not forget to tell you that this fungus, growing\r\nin this spot so plentifully, is called fly agaric because a decoction\r\nof it was once used to destroy flies. The people in Siberia swallow\r\nportions of it to produce intoxication. Here is another species\r\nclosely related to the one we have been considering, and not unlike it\r\nin form; this is the blushing agaric (_Amanita rubescens_); you see\r\nits top also is covered with whitish flakes or warts; and persons who\r\nare not in the habit of noticing differences might confuse this\r\nspecies with the other. Now look; I will cut this specimen through\r\nwith my knife, and bruise it slightly; do you see how it changes to a\r\nreddish hue, thus at once distinguishing itself from its unwholesome\r\nrelative? This quality gives the name to the fungus. The blushing\r\nagaric is perfectly wholesome. You remember how often we had it cooked\r\nlast autumn, and how delicious it was both for breakfast and dinner. I\r\nwould never, however, advise persons who have not paid attention to\r\nthe study of fungi to gather and eat them without asking the opinion\r\nof some one who had knowledge of the subject; and I am sure that you,\r\nchildren, will never think of eating any kind that you have not first\r\nbrought to me. There sits the squirrel. Let us make him show us how he\r\ncan leap from one bough to another. I clap my hands and Jack throws a\r\nstone, and off the little fellow goes, taking wonderful leaps. As the\r\nwinter approaches the squirrel will be busy laying up stores for\r\nconsumption during that season, such as nuts, acorns, and beech-mast.\r\nFor the greater part of the winter the squirrel is dormant; on fine\r\nwarm days, however, he ventures out of his retreat in the hole of a\r\ntree, visits his cupboard, cracks a few nuts, and then goes to sleep\r\nagain. The nest of the squirrel is made of moss, leaves, and twigs\r\ncuriously intertwined, and is generally placed between the forked\r\nbranches; the young ones, two or three in number, are born in the\r\nmonth of June. A gentleman, in a letter to Mr. Jenyns, says "a pair\r\nwhich frequented a tree opposite the window of one of the rooms,\r\nevinced great enmity to a couple of magpies with whom they kept up a\r\nperpetual warfare, pursuing them from branch to branch, and from tree\r\nto tree with untiring agility. Whether this persecution arose from\r\nnatural antipathy between the combatants, or from jealousy of\r\ninterference with their nests, is not known."\r\n\r\nWhat are those black circular spots some four or five yards in\r\ndiameter, so common in the woods of the Wrekin? They are places where\r\nwood has been burnt for charcoal. Always examine such spots, as you\r\nmay find rare plants growing upon them which scarcely grow anywhere\r\nelse. Here, for instance, is _Flammula carbonaria_ abundant. On these\r\ncharcoal spots this fungus delights to grow, and I do not think you\r\nwill find it elsewhere. Mr. Worthington Smith tells us it is a very\r\nrare British fungus; it is not mentioned in Mr. Berkley\'s \'Outlines of\r\nFungology.\' Here is a beautifully marked variety of _Polyporus\r\nperennis_, also very rare; it is tinted with rich sienna, chocolate,\r\nand black; it is found only in these charcoal rings. Let us go farther\r\non. Look at that splendid bright, orange-yellow fungus growing amongst\r\nthe moss in large tufts as it were. Each plant has a tender stem with\r\nshort branches; what a number are growing together with roots or lower\r\nportions of the stem closely intertwined! This is _Clavaria\r\nfastigiata_. Here we meet with the sticky _Gomphidius viscidus_, and\r\nhere with the handsome _Tricholoma scalpturatus_, and the lovely _T.\r\nrutilans_. I am obliged to use Latin names as there are no English\r\nones. The ground here is covered with the small _Clitocyle fragrans_;\r\nit smells like newly-mown hay. And now we meet with various _Boleti_.\r\nLook at the under surface; you see it is riddled with numerous small\r\nholes, very unlike the gills of the mushroom and all agarics. We shall\r\nfind _Boletus luteus_, _B. flavus_, _B. edulis_, _B. scaber_, the\r\nhandsome but poisonous _B. luridus_. _Boletus edulis_ is, as its name\r\nimports, very good to eat and perfectly wholesome; so, too, is _B.\r\nscaber_ and _B. luteus_. Holloa! what bird has just fled before us? it\r\nis a woodcock evidently, and has probably lately arrived in this\r\ncountry from the south of Europe, though woodcocks occasionally reside\r\nhere all through the year. The woodcock is a very handsome bird with\r\nits dark mottled brown plumage, long bill, and large, full, black\r\neyes. "What do these birds feed upon?" asked Willy. You often hear\r\npeople say "they live upon suction," and "do not eat any food." That I\r\nfancy is a common belief amongst sportsmen. It is, however, altogether\r\na mistake; for these birds eat quantities of earthworms, as has\r\nfrequently been witnessed. I will give an instance of this in the case\r\nof a woodcock kept in an aviary somewhere in Spain. "There was a\r\nfountain perpetually flowing to keep the ground moist and trees\r\nplanted for the same purpose; fresh sod was brought to it, the richest\r\nin worms that could be found. In vain did the worms seek concealment;\r\nwhen the woodcock was hungry it discovered them by the smell, stuck\r\nits beak into the ground, but never higher than the nostrils, drew\r\nthem out singly, and raising its bill into the air, it extended upon\r\nit the whole length of the worm, and in this way swallowed it smoothly\r\nwithout any action of the jaws. This whole operation was performed in\r\nan instant, and the action of the woodcock was so equal and\r\nimperceptible that it seemed doing nothing; it never missed its aim;\r\nfor this reason, and because it never plunged its bill beyond the\r\norifice of the nostrils, it was concluded that the bird was directed\r\nto its food by smell." There is one very interesting point in the\r\nnatural history of the woodcock which I must not forget to mention.\r\nThe old birds sometimes carry their little ones from the place where\r\nthey are hatched down to soft marshy places to feed on the worms and\r\ninsect larv\xc3\xa6 found there; they take them in the evening and return\r\nwith them in the morning. "But how do they carry them?" asked May.\r\nSome observers have said they are carried in the claws, but Mr. St.\r\nJohn maintains that the little birds are clasped tightly between the\r\nthighs.\r\n\r\n"Is it not a difficult thing to tell the difference between the male\r\nand female woodcock?" asked Willy. Yes, I do not think it is possible\r\nin every case to tell the difference; the male bird is smaller than\r\nthe female of the same age, and there are slight differences in the\r\ncolour of the plumage, but as you may meet with birds of different\r\nages, and as woodcocks are much subject to variation of plumage, it is\r\ndifficult to pronounce whether this woodcock is a male and that a\r\nfemale.\r\n\r\n"Oh, papa, what are these ring-marks on the end of this bit of timber\r\nupon which we are sitting?" said Willy. These rings or zones represent\r\nthe various growths made every year by the tree when it was growing,\r\neach zone being the produce of one year. As the wood ceases to grow\r\nfor some months in the winter, a distinction in appearance between the\r\nlast wood of a former and the first wood of the succeeding year is\r\noccasioned; so that, in our own country at least, the age of a tree\r\ncan be ascertained within some limit by counting the number of zones;\r\nthere is, however, great difference in the size of the same species of\r\ntrees, even of the same age, and great difference too in the width of\r\nthe zones; indeed, you can see this in the case of the wood we have\r\nbeen sitting upon. See how the zones differ, how broad some are, how\r\nnarrow are others; nay, even in one year you see how the zone varies.\r\nThe subject of the growth of trees is very interesting, and I would\r\nadvise you, when you get older, to pay some attention to it.\r\n\r\nHere is another fungus, and a species which I am very glad to find in\r\nthe Wrekin woods, though it grows but sparingly. Take it up; turn it\r\nover. How curious! the under side is not a series of gills, as in\r\n_Agaricus_, nor a substance perforated by a number of little holes, as\r\nin _Boletus_. It is formed of a quantity of delicate white teeth or\r\nspines; see how beautiful they are and how easily broken. The spines\r\nare exactly like miniature awls. It is called from the prickly\r\nappearance of the under surface, or _hymenium_, the hedgehog mushroom\r\n(_Hydnum repandum_). "Is it good to eat?" asked Jack. It is, in my\r\nopinion, one of the most exquisite fungi that grows, and the most\r\ncurious thing about it is that its flavour very strongly resembles\r\noysters. Last year we had some of these fellows cut up in bits about\r\nthe size of a bean and stewed in white sauce; the sauce we ate with a\r\nbeefsteak at dinner, and I do think that as far as flavour is\r\nconcerned one might almost pass it off as oyster sauce without any one\r\nfinding it out. Not that the hedgehog-mushroom-sauce is really as good\r\nas oyster sauce, but, as I said, the flavour strongly reminds one of\r\nit, nor do I think that any fungi, delicious as they are, can ever\r\ncome up to oysters, the _ne-plus-ultra_ of exquisite food.\r\n\r\nIt is getting towards evening and we must not linger much longer. How\r\nmany eatable fungi have we got? let me count. _Lepiota procera_,\r\n_Amanita rubescens_, _Hydnum repandum_, and _Marasmius oreades_ which\r\nwe gathered in the meadow before we entered the wood. We will take\r\nthem home, they will come in very well either at breakfast or at\r\ndinner time. The other fungi we will also take home and compare them\r\nwith the descriptions and drawings in my books.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd now our rambles are ended; we have seen there is much to notice,\r\nmuch to admire. Let us never forget our great Creator who has made all\r\nthe beautiful things we see around us; let us learn this lesson from\r\nthe contemplation of the works of the Almighty--that as all created\r\nthings are fulfilling their appointed work, so we too should fulfil\r\nours, and by obedience, diligence, kindness, and patience show our\r\nlove of Him for whose "pleasure all things are, and were created."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nPRINTED BY J.

The\r\n     tendency of the volume is not only unexceptionable, but\r\n     excellent in a Christian point of view. We have seldom seen\r\n     a book in which the best and highest aim is so manifest\r\n     without the attractiveness of the tale being at all lessened\r\n     by the embodiment of religious principles."--_Eclectic\r\n     Review._\r\n\r\n     "The story is so delightful, and the whole spirit of the\r\n     book so pure, that it compels our admiration."--_Daily\r\n     News._\r\n\r\n     "Since \'Currer Bell\' we have read nothing more genuine, nor\r\n     more touching. \'Nelly\'s Story\' has power to carry the reader\r\n     right through with it, and can hardly fail to impress a\r\n     moral of inestimable importance."--_Carlisle Journal._\r\n\r\n     "Admirably written, pervaded throughout by fine, correct,\r\n     and wholesome sentiments."-_Morning Post._\r\n\r\n     "Its excellent moral tone, and keen observation, are sure to\r\n     render the book widely popular."--_John Bull._\r\n\r\n     "\'Nelly\'s Story\' is a good one.

Marty,\r\n     the maid of Mrs. Grey, might pass for a creation of Dickens.\r\n     The moral of \'Quicksands\' is at once comprehensive and\r\n     striking."--_Weekly Mail._\r\n\r\nGROOMBRIDGE & SONS, 5, Paternoster Row, London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGIFT BOOKS FOR BOYS.\r\n\r\nFoolscap 8vo, cloth gilt, Illustrated with 8 full-page Wood\r\nEngravings, price 2s. 6d.\r\n\r\nINVENTION AND DISCOVERY\r\n\r\nA COLLECTION\r\nOF\r\nINTERESTING ANECDOTES.\r\n\r\nBY\r\nRALPH AND CHANDOS TEMPLE.\r\n\r\n     "Has a point and object, and a good one--nicely worked\r\n     out."--_Saturday Review._\r\n\r\n     "We can recommend this book as a Christmas present, and one\r\n     which has given us no small pleasure."--_Literary Churchman._\r\n\r\n     "Exceedingly well-timed.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
