We English should\r\nknow something of them, for Viking blood flowed in the veins of many\r\nof our ancestors. And these fierce fighting men came in their ships\r\nacross the North Sea from Norway on more than one occasion to invade\r\nEngland. But they came once too often, and were thoroughly defeated at\r\nthe Battle of Stamford Bridge, when, as will be remembered, Harald the\r\nHard, King of Norway, was killed in attempting to turn his namesake,\r\nKing Harold of England, off his throne.\r\n\r\nNorwegian historians, however, do not say very much about this\r\nparticular invasion. They prefer to dwell on the great deeds of\r\nanother King Harald, who was called "Fairhair," and who began his\r\nreign some two hundred years earlier. This Harald was only a boy\r\nof ten years of age when he came to the throne, but he determined\r\nto increase the size of his kingdom, which was then but a small one,\r\nso he trained his men to fight, built grand new ships, and then began\r\nhis conquests. Norway was at that time divided up into a number of\r\ndistricts or small kingdoms, each of which was ruled over by an Earl\r\nor petty King, and it was these rulers whom Harald set to work to\r\nsubdue. He intended to make one united kingdom of all Norway, and\r\nhe eventually succeeded in doing so. But he had many a hard fight;\r\nand if the Sagas, as the historical records of the North are called,\r\nspeak truly, he fought almost continuously during twelve long years\r\nbefore he had accomplished his task, and even then he was only just\r\ntwenty-one years of age.\r\n\r\nThey say that he did all these wonderful things because a girl, named\r\nGyda, whom he wanted to marry, refused to have anything to say to him\r\nuntil he had made himself King of a really big kingdom. He made a vow\r\nthat he would not comb or cut his hair until he had conquered the whole\r\ncountry. He led his men to victory after victory, and at length fought\r\nhis last great battle at Hafrsfjord (to the south of Stavanger). The\r\nsea-fight was desperate and long, but Harald\'s fleet succeeded in\r\noverpowering that of the enemy, and Sulki, King of Rogaland, as well\r\nas Erik, King of Hardanger, were slain. Then Harald cut and dressed\r\nhis hair, the skalds composed poems in honour of the event, and for\r\never after he was known as Fairhair. He was truly a great Viking,\r\nand he did not rest content with the conquest of Norway alone; for\r\nhe brought his ships across the North Sea and conquered the Isle of\r\nMan, the Hebrides, the Shetlands, and the Orkneys, and he lived to\r\nthe age of eighty-three.\r\n\r\nThen there are the stories of the two Olafs--Olaf Tryggvasson and\r\nOlaf the Saint, each of whom took part in many a fight on British\r\nsoil, each of whom was the champion of Christianity in Norway\r\nand fought his way to the throne, and each of whom fell in battle\r\nunder heroic circumstances, the one at Svold (A.D. 1000), the other\r\nat Sticklestad (A.D. 1030). To us it is interesting to know that\r\nKing Olaf Tryggvasson, on one of his early Viking expeditions, was\r\nbaptized in the Scilly Isles, that as his second wife he married an\r\nIrish Princess, and that for some time he lived in Dublin. To the\r\nNorwegians he is a Norse hero of the greatest renown, who during his\r\nshort reign of barely five years never ceased to force Christianity\r\non the heathen population, and who, at the age of thirty-one, came to\r\nan untimely end. His fleet was ambuscaded and surrounded, and when\r\nhis men had made their last stand he refused to surrender. Neither\r\nwould he suffer the ignominy of capture or death at the hands of\r\nhis enemies; so, with shield and sword in hand, and in full armour,\r\nhe leaped overboard, and immediately sank. For years afterwards his\r\nfaithful people believed that he would appear again, and many fancied\r\nthat, on occasions, their hero\'s spirit visited them.\r\n\r\nEveryone knows the old triumphant line, "London Bridge is broken\r\ndown," yet few are aware that the words are translated from an old\r\nNorse song, and fewer still could say who broke down the bridge. The\r\nstory goes that this was accomplished by the other Olaf, afterwards\r\nknown as St. Olaf. He and his Vikings had allied themselves with\r\nEtheldred the Unready against the Danes, who held the Thames above\r\nLondon Bridge. The bridge itself, which in those days was a rough\r\nwooden structure, was densely packed with armed men, prepared to\r\nresist the advance of the combined fleets. But Olaf drove his stout\r\nships against it, made them fast to the piers, hoisted all his sail\r\nand got out his oars, and succeeded in upsetting the bridge into\r\nthe river, thus securing victory for Etheldred. But that was before\r\nOlaf gained the throne of Norway. What he did as King of that country\r\nwould take too long to tell here. Every district of Norway possesses\r\nlegends bearing on his visits when engaged in converting the people to\r\nChristianity, and describing his powers of working miracles. Everywhere\r\nthe name of St. Olaf still remains engraven on the country. His death,\r\nhowever, was that of a soldier--on the battle-field; and the lance\r\nwhich Norway\'s patron saint carried in his last fight may even now\r\nbe seen by the altar in Trondhjem Cathedral.\r\n\r\nIt was St. Olaf\'s half-brother, Harald the Hard, who fell, as we have\r\nsaid, at Stamford Bridge, when attempting the invasion of England in\r\n1066. But all this is history nearly a thousand years old, and the\r\nstirring tales of the Vikings are fully recorded, and may be read\r\nin the Sagas. Ten centuries have changed the order of things. To-day\r\nwe have, in our turn, become the invaders, albeit full of peace and\r\ngood-will; and over the same seas upon which once danced Long Ship,\r\nSerpent, and Dragon, our great ugly, smoky steamers now plough\r\ntheir way.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nMODERN NORWAY\r\n\r\n\r\n"Norroway over the Foam," as it used to be called, is a good land to\r\ngo to and a beautiful land to look upon. It lies less than two days\'\r\njourney from our shores, so it is easy enough to reach. Away from\r\nthe towns--and they are not many--everything is picturesque, grand,\r\nand majestic, and the country indeed looks (as the people firmly\r\nbelieved of it long ago) as if it might have been the playground\r\nof countless giants, who amused themselves by pulling up acres of\r\nland, letting the sea into the valleys, and pelting each other with\r\nmountains and islands. Thank goodness the giants have disappeared! But\r\nif they really did have a hand in fashioning Norway, they are to be\r\ncongratulated on the result.\r\n\r\nOne of the first things one likes to know about a foreign country is\r\nits size. Well, Norway is just a little larger than the British Isles,\r\nand that part of it which forms the usual holiday touring ground of\r\nBritish and other people--_i.e._, from Trondhjem to the south--is no\r\nlarger than England. The remainder of the country consists of a long,\r\nnarrow strip running up into the Arctic Circle, and ending in Lapland\r\nin the Far North.\r\n\r\nOn three sides Norway is washed by the sea; on the other side she\r\nhas two neighbours--Sweden from the south right away up to Lapland,\r\nand then Russia.\r\n\r\nNow let us see what sort of a land it is. First, there are the fjords,\r\nstretching often a hundred miles or more inland from the sea-coast,\r\nsometimes with delightful fertile shores, at other times hemmed in on\r\neither hand by rocky cliffs rising two or three thousand feet sheer\r\nfrom the water. Then there are the mountains, which are everywhere;\r\nfor, with the exception of Spain, Norway is the most mountainous\r\ncountry in Europe. And on their summits lie vast fields of eternal\r\nsnow, with glaciers pushing down into the green valleys, or even into\r\nthe ocean itself. Again, from these mountains flow down rivers and\r\nstreams, now forming magnificent waterfalls as they leap over the\r\nedge of the lofty plateau, now rushing wildly over their rock-strewn\r\ntorrent beds, until they reach the lake, which, thus gathering the\r\nwaters, send them on again in one wide river to the fjord.\r\n\r\nSuch things lend themselves to create scenery which cannot fail\r\nto charm, and in one day in Norway you may see them all. Take,\r\nfor instance, the famous view of the N\xc3\xa6rodal from Stalheim, a place\r\nwhich every visitor to Western Norway knows well. Probably nowhere\r\nin the world is there anything to approach it in grandeur, for not\r\nonly are there the great mountains forming the sides of the actual\r\nvalley in the foreground, but away beyond appears a succession of\r\nother mountains, stretching far across the Sogne Fjord, even to the\r\nsnowy peaks of Jotunheim.\r\n\r\nPeople who live in such a land must needs be proud of it, and the\r\ndescendants of the Vikings believe that there exists in the world no\r\nfairer country than their beloved Norge. [1] Maybe they are not far\r\nwrong. But these Northern people are not numerous, and they are not\r\nforced, for want of space, to spoil their landscapes by studding the\r\ncountry-side with little red-brick cottages, for all Norway contains\r\nnot one-half the number of inhabitants found in London. Under such\r\ncircumstances the feeling of freedom is great, and the Norwegians\r\nclaim that, as a nation, they are the freest of the free. Recent\r\nevents would seem to justify the claim. Only the other day Norway\r\ndissolved the Union with Sweden with little difficulty, and of her\r\nown free-will cast herself loose from the light fetters with which,\r\nfor nearly a century, she considered that she had been bound.\r\n\r\nWith Norway time has dealt kindly. In modern ages war has not\r\nravaged her lands. The oldest living Norseman was born too late to\r\nfight for his country, and it is to be hoped that his grandsons and\r\ngreat-grandsons may continue to live in ignorance of the horrors which\r\nwar entails. Yet are they all prepared to take up arms in defence\r\nof hearth and home, for each able-bodied man serves his time as a\r\nsoldier, and doubtless, if occasion should arise, would prove to the\r\nworld that the old Viking spirit within him was still alive.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, the sense of restfulness pervading everything that\r\nis Norway\'s charm, and even the ordinary bustle of life is unknown\r\noutside the towns. In the summer the beaten tracks of the country\r\nare practically in the hands of the foreign visitors, whose money\r\nhelps not a little to support many a Norse family. In the winter\r\nthings are different, as, except perhaps in Christiania, very few\r\nforeigners are to be met with, and the Norwegians live their own lives.\r\n\r\nThe towns are neither numerous nor large, and, with a few exceptions,\r\nare situated on the sea-coast. Perhaps a quarter of the whole\r\npopulation of Norway is to be found in the towns, the remainder\r\nconsisting of country-folk, who live on their farms. What we term\r\nvillages barely exist, and the nearest approach to them is a group\r\nof farms with a church in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nChristiania, the capital of the country, is the largest town, and other\r\ntowns of importance are Bergen, Trondhjem, Stavanger, Frederikstad,\r\nT\xc3\xb6nsberg, and Christiansand, all busy seaports and picturesquely\r\nsituated. But the interest of a country such as Norway does not lie\r\nin the towns, which, with their wide streets, stately buildings,\r\nwell-stocked shops, hotels, restaurants, places of amusement, and\r\ncrowded dwellings, do not differ very greatly from other European\r\ntowns, and a townsman\'s life in his town is much the same all over\r\nthe civilized world.\r\n\r\nTown-dwellers in all Norway number no more than the inhabitants of\r\nManchester, and though force of circumstance necessitates their living\r\nin the towns, their thoughts are ever of the country--of the fjeld,\r\nthe fjord, the forest, the mountain lake, or the salmon river. In the\r\nsummer nothing pleases them better than to tramp, with knapsack on\r\nback, for days on end, in the wilderness of the mountains, obtaining\r\nshelter for the night at some out-of-the-way mountain farm or at one\r\nof the snug little huts of the Norwegian Tourist Club. In the winter\r\nthey have their sleighs, snow-shoes, toboggans, and skates to assist\r\nthem in taking air and exercise, and in a Norwegian winter one does\r\nnot live in a state of uncertainty as to whether the ice will bear or\r\nthe snow be still lying on the ground when one wakes up in the morning.\r\n\r\nSo comfortable has travelling in Norway been made for foreigners that\r\nthere is no difficulty in going anywhere. There is a railway from\r\nChristiania to Bergen, and another from Christiania to Trondhjem. There\r\nare regular steamers on all the fjords and along the coast, even up\r\nto the North Cape and beyond. Wherever there are roads there is a\r\nwell-appointed service of vehicles and posting-stations, and wherever\r\nanyone is likely to go by steamer, road, or rail there are hotels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE PEOPLE AND THEIR INDUSTRIES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe greater number of the people are country-folk, who gain a\r\nliving by farming, timber-working, or, when living near the sea,\r\nby fishing. Then there are a certain number of men who are soldiers\r\nby profession, and more still who are sailors--not fighting sailors,\r\nbut serving on board the 8,000 merchant vessels which Norway possesses.\r\n\r\nEveryone who lives in a Norwegian town is connected one way or\r\nanother with some sort of trade or profession; and, of course, in\r\nthe seaports there are always ships coming and going, unloading and\r\nloading, and so providing plenty of work for a great many men. In\r\nthe towns also there are, as in every civilized town, men who follow\r\nregular professions--clergymen, merchants, bankers, lawyers, doctors,\r\nhotel-keepers, shop-keepers, and others, as well as Government\r\nofficials, learned professors, literary men, and artists.\r\n\r\nAs a nation Norway cannot be considered wealthy, but the fact that she\r\nemploys so many ships for trading purposes is perhaps a proof that she\r\nis fairly prosperous. There are few really rich Norwegians, and still\r\nfewer who are able to live as independent gentlemen on their estates;\r\nno man can claim the right to be called noble, for the nobility of\r\nthe country was abolished by law nearly a century ago, and since\r\nthen equality has been the birthright of every Norseman. But no one\r\ncan prevent money made in trade gradually finding its way into the\r\npockets of a few capable men of business, and thus class distinctions\r\nmust be created. The majority of the Norwegians, however, are content\r\nto work and earn sufficient to maintain themselves and their families\r\nin fairly comfortable circumstances, and fortunately the products of\r\nthe country enable them to do so.\r\n\r\nThe forests, covering as they do almost one-fourth of the area of\r\nNorway, are of immense value, and the timber trade is a source of\r\nincome to a great number of the people. Much of it, of course, is used\r\nin the country itself, as the houses and bridges are mostly built of\r\nwood; but there is plenty left to be exported to England and other\r\nforeign countries, as anyone who visits the ports in the South of\r\nNorway can judge for himself. Between Christiansand and Christiania,\r\nfor instance, one may see enormous stores of timber awaiting shipment,\r\nand one wonders how it will ever be shipped. Then, travelling among\r\nthe forest-clad mountains, one finds the woodman busy with his axe,\r\nand the great bare tree-trunks being hauled down to the banks of the\r\ntorrent or river, so as to float on the waters to the low country,\r\nand thence even to the sea-coast. Again, on lakes like the Randsfjord,\r\nthe sight presented by the gathered logs, which have floated down\r\nfrom the mountains, and which are being rafted for their final voyage,\r\nis an extraordinary one. Acres and acres of floating timber cover the\r\nend of the lake, and the massive trunks are packed so close that you\r\nmight wander about on them at your will for hours.\r\n\r\nBut it is not only timber in a raw state that does so much for the\r\nprosperity of Norway, for a great trade is done also in matches as\r\nwell as in wood-pulp. The latter is a comparatively modern industry,\r\nand its development has been rapid. Anyone who visits Christiania\r\nand has the opportunity of taking the little town of H\xc3\xb6nefos in his\r\ntravels, should not fail to pay a visit to the pulping works. It is\r\nsaid that in Chicago one may see a herd of swine driven in at the\r\nfront gate of a factory and brought out at another gate in the form\r\nof sausages. At H\xc3\xb6nefos trees go into the works and come out as paper,\r\nor very nearly so.\r\n\r\nThe waterfall, which gave a name to the place, is at the meeting\r\nof two rivers--one flowing from Spirillen Lake and the other from\r\nthe Randsfjord, and was at one time beautiful. Now, however, its\r\npicturesqueness is marred by the presence of a barn-like structure\r\ncontaining the pulping works, while the fall itself is utilized\r\nto drive the machinery. And, it must be confessed, all this has\r\nbeen brought about by an Englishman, for here at H\xc3\xb6nefos is made\r\nthe paper upon which is printed _Lloyd\'s Weekly_ and the _Daily\r\nChronicle_. Neither is the fact concealed, but rather boasted of in\r\nlarge letters on the outside of the barn. But Norway can well spare\r\nthis one scrap from its storehouse of scenery, and the works find\r\nregular employment for upwards of a hundred Norwegians.\r\n\r\nThe process of pulping is simplicity itself; the trees are felled in\r\nthe forests on the hillsides close by, and sawn into blocks. Aerial\r\nwires stretch from the felling ground to the works, and the blocks\r\ncome swinging down in baskets, to be handed over forthwith to the\r\nmercy of the machinery. With the aid of heavy crushers and a certain\r\namount of water the logs are soon reduced to pulp, which then floats\r\naway into sifters, to be eventually rolled out into flat sheets.\r\n\r\nAn immense amount of this pulp is exported to England in sacks,\r\nand is used for many other purposes besides paper-making.\r\n\r\nAnother thing which we get from Norway is ice. Most of those huge\r\nblocks of ice which you see in the fishmongers\' shops in the summer\r\nhave come across the North Sea, and ice-cutting is a very important\r\nbusiness in the winter months. The ice is obtained principally from the\r\nmountain lakes, and in the vicinity of Christiania long wooden chutes\r\nare erected from the mountain-tops to the edge of the fjord. Down\r\nthese the huge cubes travel, direct from their homes to the deck of\r\nthe boat, and thus save the cost of overland transport. They are sawn\r\nmost carefully, the dimensions being about two feet each way; rope\r\nhandles are then frozen into the blocks for facility of movement,\r\nand the cubes are stored in ice-houses until the summer, by which\r\ntime they have lost almost half their original weight.\r\n\r\nNext to timber, the chief export from the country is fish (including\r\ncod-liver oil). The great fisheries are round the Lof\xc3\xb6dden Islands\r\non the North-West Coast, well within the Arctic Circle, and it\r\nis estimated that some 30,000 men and 6,000 boats are engaged in\r\ncapturing the cod from January to April each year. The fishermen\r\nassemble from far and wide, and take up their residence for the\r\nseason in temporary huts, clustered together on the shores of the\r\nislands. The work is arduous as well as dangerous, for storms and\r\nheavy seas are of frequent occurrence, and tides and currents among\r\nthe islands most treacherous. And here, close to the fisheries,\r\nis situated the dreaded whirlpool, the M\xc3\xa6lstrom of renown.\r\n\r\nBut it is the people\'s living, and in a favourable season they make\r\nimmense hauls. An ordinary catch for an ordinary day is 500 cod per\r\nboat, and a good day will double that number, though in such a case\r\nthe boat has to make a second trip to bring the fish ashore. A simple\r\ncalculation will show that millions of cod are landed on the islands\r\nevery day. Imagine the sight and imagine the smell!\r\n\r\nThe fish are split open and, after the roe and the liver have\r\nbeen removed, hung up on hurdles to dry. Some are sold to the\r\nfishing-smacks, which come to the islands to buy the fresh fish, and\r\nthen salt it down in barrels, or take it away to dry elsewhere. Scores\r\nof bundles of dried cod, looking like slips of leather, may be seen\r\nfor the remainder of the year on every wharf in Norway. Who eats it\r\nall is a mystery; but it goes to England and Spain in large quantities,\r\nand most of us have eaten it on Ash Wednesdays.\r\n\r\nCod\'s roe and liver are probably of more value than the fish from\r\nwhich they are extracted, and there are large factories for making\r\ncod-liver oil, not only at the Lof\xc3\xb6ddens, but also at other places\r\non the coast. At Hammerfest, which boasts of being the northernmost\r\ntown in the world, the whole air is laden with the nauseous fumes\r\nissuing from the steaming caldrons of boiling cod-liver oil.\r\n\r\nThe fish trade of Norway is not, however, confined to cod and the\r\nLof\xc3\xb6dden Isles, for in many other parts fishing is the chief industry\r\nof the people, and hundreds of thousands of barrels of salted herrings\r\nand sprats leave the country every year, while sardines and anchovies\r\nare tinned or potted in the factories at Stavanger and other large\r\nseaports. The salmon, also, for which the Norwegian rivers are famous,\r\nare brought over to England packed in ice, and well repay the owners\r\nof the rivers.\r\n\r\nEven in the depth of winter a good deal of sea fishing goes on through\r\nthe ice of the frozen fjords. The fisherman erects a shelter of some\r\nkind to protect him from the biting wind, and within view of this he\r\nbreaks two or three holes in the thick ice. In each hole his baited\r\nhooks are dropped down, the other end of the line being fastened\r\nto a simple contrivance of pieces of stick, which begin to waggle\r\nwhen a fish is hooked. On the Christiania Fjord numbers of these\r\nsporting fishermen are to be seen at work all through the winter,\r\nand judging by the frequency of their visits to their different holes,\r\nthey must take a quantity of fish. It is cold work, however, sitting\r\nand watching for the signal to come from the hole, and one cannot\r\nhelp admiring the men\'s energy and keenness.\r\n\r\nIt is only natural that, living in a country where fish is so\r\nplentiful, the people themselves should be great fish-eaters, and\r\nthe daily fish-markets at Bergen and other places on the coast are\r\nmost interesting sights. As a rule the fish are brought to market\r\nalive in half-sunken canoes, towed astern of the fishing-boats,\r\nand at Bergen all the bargaining is done between the buyers on the\r\nquayside and the sellers in their boats.\r\n\r\nIn proportion to the population the variety of occupations in Norway is\r\ncertainly great, and there are other industries besides those already\r\nmentioned. There is, for example, a considerable trade in skins\r\nand furs, in condensed milk, butter, and margarine, and in certain\r\nminerals and chemicals. Employment is found also for many men on the\r\nrailways--in road-making, in boat and shipbuilding, in timber-dressing,\r\nin mechanical engineering, in slate-quarrying, in stone-cutting,\r\nand in mining (principally in the silver mines at K\xc3\xb6ngsberg).\r\n\r\nIt would seem, therefore, as if there were plenty of work for the\r\nNorwegians to do, and they are willing workers. Abject poverty, as\r\nwe know the term, has no place in Norway at present, for the country\r\ncan support its people, thanks, perhaps, to the fact that the desire\r\nto emigrate to America and Canada is strong.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nON THE FARM\r\n\r\n\r\nNorway is not like England, where nearly every bit of ground is\r\ncultivated, for nothing will grow on bare rocks, and a good deal of\r\nNorway is barren land. In fact, except in the low country down in the\r\nsouth, the only land worth cultivating lies, as a rule, in the valleys\r\nnear the fjords. There are situated all the farms, sometimes with small\r\norchards of apples and cherries, but more often with potato plots,\r\na little corn, and a great amount of grassland. As the mountains\r\nare always so close at hand, the fields are generally strewn with\r\nrocks and boulders, and are very uneven, so haymaking is not easy,\r\nand such a thing as a mowing-machine would be quite useless.\r\n\r\nEvery blade of grass that can be gathered has to be made into hay,\r\notherwise the ponies and cows would starve in the winter, as they\r\nare often snowed up for weeks at a time. Haymaking is, therefore, a\r\ngreat business, and the amount of grass which the Norwegians contrive\r\nto scrape off their land is marvellous. At the best of times it only\r\ngrows to a height of about six inches, but scythes and reaping-hooks\r\nfind their way into every nook and corner, and grass that no English\r\nfarmer would trouble to cut is all raked in with the greatest\r\ncare. Parties go up the mountain-sides to ledges of the cliffs, and\r\non to the tops of the mountains, to make sure that nothing is wasted,\r\nthe grass being brought down to the farms to be dried.\r\n\r\nLong wires may be seen stretching from the valleys away up, thousands\r\nof feet, to the tops of the mountains, and on these the bundles of\r\ngrass are tied, to come swirling down to the farmstead. There is no\r\ntime in the short Northern summer to make the hay as we make it, and\r\nthere is usually so much rain that the grass would never dry at all\r\nif left lying on the ground; so long hurdles are put up in positions\r\nwhere they will catch the sun and the wind, and on them the grass\r\nis hung up to dry, there remaining until it has made itself into\r\nhay. Afterwards it is stored in covered barns ready for winter use.\r\n\r\nThe corn, also, is dried in a peculiar manner. As it is cut it is made\r\nup into small sheaves, a number of these being tied, ears downwards,\r\nto a pole planted upright in the ground. This makes drying rapid,\r\nand, if wet weather sets in, the rain runs off freely. A field of\r\nthese wheat-stacks has a very odd appearance at a little distance,\r\nand near the woods one sees similar, though somewhat larger, stacks\r\nof branches and leaves, on which the goats are fed in the winter.\r\n\r\nDirectly the snow has melted off the mountains the flocks and herds\r\nare sent up to the highland pastures (s\xc3\xa6ters), usually in charge of the\r\nyounger women and girls of the farm, and there, throughout the summer,\r\nthe dairy work is carried on. As in all mountainous countries, rich\r\nand sweet herbage follows the melting of the snow, and the cows and\r\ngoats give an abundance of good milk, which is turned into butter and\r\ncheese, to be sold or consumed in the winter. Life at the s\xc3\xa6ter-hut,\r\nor mountain farm, is healthy and delightful, though much hard work\r\nhas to be got through each day.\r\n\r\nChildren seldom go to the s\xc3\xa6ters until old enough to be able to do\r\nreal work, but one often sees a girl of fourteen or so looking after\r\na flock of goats. She will be out with them all day as they feed\r\non the mountain-sides, and will do all the milking. When seen for\r\nthe first time this is rather an amusing operation, and decidedly a\r\npractical one. The milkmaid seizes a goat, straddles her, with face\r\ntowards the goat\'s tail, and, stooping down, proceeds to milk. From\r\na little distance all you see is the goat\'s hind-legs emerging from\r\nbeneath a blue petticoat, which looks most peculiar.\r\n\r\nBut the children who are too young to spend the summer at the s\xc3\xa6ters\r\nfind plenty to do at home, and they learn almost as soon as they\r\ncan toddle that there is work for everyone. Quite small boys and\r\ngirls manage to do a good day\'s haymaking, and they can row a boat or\r\ndrive a _carriole_ before they have reached their teens. Such things\r\nthey regard as amusements, for they have few other ways of amusing\r\nthemselves, and their one ambition is to do what their fathers and\r\nmothers do.\r\n\r\nIn some cases the small farmers move their whole families up to the\r\nmountain pastures for the summer; and, in addition to the dairy work,\r\nthey rent the fishing on some of the mountain lakes, which they\r\nnet freely. The trout thus caught are split open and salted down\r\nin barrels, eventually being sent down to the markets in the towns,\r\nwhere they fetch a good price. And all these peasants possess rifles,\r\nand are keen sportsmen, so that when August comes they go in pursuit\r\nof the wild reindeer, and lay up a store of meat, which, salted and\r\ndried, comes in very handy in the hard times of winter.\r\n\r\nAs a rule the peasants eat very little meat, and what they do eat has\r\nprobably been smoked and dried and hung up for several months. A good\r\ndeal of salt fish is consumed; but the principal food is porridge\r\n(_gr\xc3\xb6d_), made of barley, rye, or oatmeal, and eaten generally with\r\nsour buttermilk, with the addition of potatoes, when plentiful. White\r\nbread is not found far from the towns, and the black, or rye, bread\r\nis a heavy compound, a taste for which takes an Englishman some time\r\nto acquire. But even that is superior to the _fladbr\xc3\xb6d_, which in\r\nappearance and consistency resembles old boot-leather.\r\n\r\nThe well-to-do farmer lives more sumptuously. He occasionally has fresh\r\nmeat and fresh fish, and the dried articles nearly every day. He also\r\nindulges in cheese, usually of the commoner kind, known as _prim_,\r\nor _mysost_, which is not unlike brown Windsor soap. There are two\r\nother native cheeses, but they are considered somewhat expensive\r\nluxuries. They are called _gammelost_ and _pultost_, and are made\r\nfrom sour skimmed milk, being afterwards kept in a dark cellar for\r\na year or so to ripen. The latter is the greater delicacy, and is\r\nstored, in a sloppy state, in wooden tubs. If you should ever chance\r\nto see one of the tubs being produced, do not wait to see it opened,\r\nor your nose will never forget it!\r\n\r\nVerily, winter is the bugbear of the struggling Norwegian countryman\'s\r\nexistence. Like the provident ant, he spends the greater part of the\r\nsummer in laying up for the winter, and he has not only himself and his\r\nfamily to think of, but also his cattle, for if the latter cannot be\r\nproperly housed and fed he will be ruined. There are times, however,\r\nwhen he contrives to throw off the constant thought of the future,\r\nand when he can enjoy himself thoroughly. Sunday is a day of rest,\r\nwith possibly a long row across the fjord to church, after which\r\ncomes a good gossip with the neighbours, and the chance of a feast\r\nat a friend\'s farm. There are also high-days and holidays, weddings\r\nand christenings, accompanied by plentiful food and drink, as well\r\nas by dancing and fiddling.\r\n\r\nBut when the snow covers up the country the days are none too exciting,\r\nthough the cattle have to be fed and many odd jobs attended to. Most\r\nof the men are handy carpenters, and can make such things as dairy\r\nutensils, while the women in many parts weave sufficient cloth to keep\r\nthe whole family clothed. By the younger men, however, the season is\r\nlooked forward to as a time of real enjoyment. Then it is that they\r\nget out their snowshoes and enter with zest into the grand sport\r\nof ski-ing, or, taking their guns with them, go off on their ski to\r\nshoot ryper or hares for the market.\r\n\r\nSuch is the life of the ordinary small farmer and peasant; but down\r\nby the fjords and on the beaten track of the foreign tourists the\r\nlarger farmer has grasped the situation, and has discovered the value\r\nof having more than one string to his bow. So in summer he combines\r\nhotel-keeping with farming. His farm produce is consumed in his hotel,\r\nand if he is fortunate enough to have a salmon river flowing through\r\nhis land, he can be certain of a good rent for it. Thus the prosperous\r\nfarmer becomes a person of some importance in the district, and one\r\nday, perhaps, a Member of the Storthing, or Parliament.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nMANNERS AND CUSTOMS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe religion of the country is the Lutheran, almost in its original\r\nform, for in some matters the Norwegians are most conservative. Though\r\nnot, perhaps, what we would consider a religious-minded people, they\r\nare naturally good, honest, and kind, and they take their religion on\r\ntrust. They pay tithes, and give Easter and Christmas offerings to\r\ntheir clergy willingly, since they regard the priest as a superior\r\nperson, and hold him in high esteem. He is a man, like his fellows,\r\nand farms his own land, which appeals to the people in the country\r\nparts. Moreover, he is possessed of learning, and away from the towns\r\nhe is mainly responsible for the national education.\r\n\r\nOften the journey to church is long, for the farms lie far apart, and\r\nwhen the church is distant ponies or boats are brought into requisition\r\nfor the conveyance of, at any rate, the women and children. Down by\r\nthe fjord on a fine Sunday morning the sight of the boats crossing\r\nover to a church is a picturesque one. Deep laden with men, women,\r\nand children, they come one after another; and when they reach the\r\nshore, the women take their clean white head-dresses and gay kerchiefs\r\nout of the compact little _tiner_ (oval chip-wood boxes), and finish\r\ntheir toilets before going up to the church.\r\n\r\nThe Norwegian Sabbath begins on Saturday evening and ends at noon\r\non Sunday, after which time the day is spent in simple enjoyment\r\nas a true holiday. Then in the evening the boats start for home,\r\nand across the still waters one may hear the women singing glees,\r\nas often as not to the accompaniment of the fiddle.\r\n\r\nA wedding causes quite as much interest and excitement in Norway as it\r\ndoes in England, and in the olden time the festivities lasted for a\r\nweek or more. Nowadays the merry-making has been somewhat curtailed,\r\nbut the actual ceremony has lost none of its solemnity and little\r\nof its brightness. In the towns civilization has robbed the wedding\r\nof its picturesqueness. The men are clothed in their best "blacks,"\r\nas if going to a funeral, and the ladies wear dresses of Parisian\r\nstyle. But away in the depths of the country one may still see a real\r\nNorwegian wedding, with the bride and bridesmaids, if not also most of\r\nthe guests, dressed in the national costume, and it is a pretty sight.\r\n\r\nIn front comes a _stolkj\xc3\xa6rre_, the pony being led by the master of\r\nthe ceremonies. On the seat sits the bride in the full dress of the\r\ncountry, and wearing her bridal crown; by her side the bridegroom,\r\nalso well adorned for the occasion; and, on the step of the cart, that\r\nmost important person, the fiddler, working his bow with astounding\r\nenergy. If the pony can bear the weight, perhaps a couple of the\r\nbride\'s relations will sit up behind, otherwise they will walk in the\r\nprocession which follows; and there may be seen all the available\r\npeasants of the district--young men and maidens, grandfathers and\r\ngrandchildren.\r\n\r\nSo they wend their way to the church; and after the service, if the\r\ngood old customs be kept up, the party proceeds to a green close by\r\nand enjoys a boisterous dance until it is time to go on to the wedding\r\nsupper. Feasting and merry-making then continue for several hours--in\r\nfact, the sleepiness of the guests is the only thing that breaks up\r\nthe entertainment for the night. Next day the festivities are resumed,\r\nand are possibly carried on into a third day. The fiddler is always\r\nbusy, for without him there can be no real fun, the people\'s love of\r\nmusic being no less than their love of dancing.\r\n\r\nThe violin is the one instrument which they know and understand, and\r\nit has been in use among the Norwegians for hundreds of years. Their\r\nmost famous violin-player, Ole Bull, who died some few years ago,\r\nwas looked on as a great composer and musician. But all over the\r\ncountry there are to be found men who can play after a fashion; and\r\na century or so ago, when the people were still very superstitious,\r\nthey fully believed that anyone who could play at all well had had\r\nintercourse with the fairies, who were supposed to be marvellous\r\nmusicians and acquainted with an immense variety of beautiful tunes.\r\n\r\nThe food provided at a peasant\'s wedding feast is, of course, something\r\nout of the common, and the guests are supposed to bring a present of\r\nsomething good to eat, such as fresh meat, butter, old cream, cream\r\nporridge, or cheese, for the ordinary fare of the country folk is,\r\nas we have said, of the plainest.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the national costume, mentioned above, it is,\r\nunfortunately, a fact that it is gradually disappearing. There are\r\nparts, however, where there are no railways, no steamboats, and few\r\ntourists, and in such places the people still live much as they did\r\na hundred years ago, even the men wearing clothes similar to those\r\nworn by their grandfathers and great-grandfathers, and some of these\r\nare quaint in the extreme.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the quaintest dresses are those of the people of S\xc3\xa6tersdal, a\r\ndistrict in the South of Norway, between Christiansand and Telemarken;\r\nand, when properly turned out, the men are quite as "dressy" as\r\nthe women. They wear a pair of trousers buttoned with half a dozen\r\nsilver buttons tight round the ankles, and coming right up to the\r\narmpits. Several broad stripes adorn the legs from top to bottom. And\r\nthe coat takes the form of a curious little cape, richly embroidered\r\nwith silver, and having sleeves, fastened at the wrists with more\r\nsilver buttons. Shoes, with buckles, white stockings, and a cut-down\r\ntall hat, gaily decorated with ribbons and embroidery, complete the\r\ncostume. The women wear short skirts--only a little below the knees--of\r\ndark blue, with a bright trimming round the bottom; coloured stockings;\r\na bodice laced with silver, and covered with silver brooches and\r\nother ornaments; a waistbelt, which is sometimes entirely of metal;\r\na kerchief tied over the head, after the fashion of the bandana of\r\nWest Indian negresses; and on occasions a shawl of many colours.\r\n\r\nA step farther north, in what is called Lower Telemarken, a similar\r\nkind of dress still exists, though the man\'s waistcoat-jacket is of\r\na somewhat different pattern and colour, and the women wear their\r\nskirts a trifle longer. On Sundays and great occasions the latter\r\nalso put on cloth stockings and gloves, embroidered tastefully with\r\ntrails of flowers.\r\n\r\nBut such dresses as these are not the national costume of Norway. For\r\nthat we have to go still farther north--to the Hardanger. If an English\r\ngirl wishes to dress a doll as a typical Norwegian, the clothes would\r\nbe those of the Hardanger, and they would be these: a dark blue serge\r\nskirt (to the ankles), trimmed with black velvet and silver braid;\r\na white chemisette with full sleeves; a red flannel bodice embroidered\r\nwith white, black, and silver, and glittering with brass saucer-shaped\r\nornaments; and a waistbelt adorned with metal buttons. The effect\r\nis neat, bright, and decidedly piquant. The girls plait their fair\r\nhair in two long tails, wearing a handkerchief as a head-dress; but\r\nthe married women have a most elaborate coiffure, something of the\r\nsister-of-mercy type, consisting of the so-called _skaut_, or hood,\r\nand the _lin_, or forehead band. It takes a considerable time to\r\nput on, as the snow-white linen has to be most carefully stretched\r\nover a frame, which is first fastened on the top of the head, and\r\nthen so arranged that the numerous small plaits hang in a particular\r\nmanner. This is the ordinary head-dress, though the country women\r\ncoming in to church on Sundays often wear curious old-fashioned\r\nbonnets, which have the appearance of being heirlooms handed down\r\nfrom generation to generation.\r\n\r\nThe men do not dress up to the women. They confine themselves\r\nto a rough trouser suit, generally of dark blue, and a black felt\r\nhat. Even amongst the older men of the Hardanger one seldom sees the\r\nknee-breeches and stockings which used to be worn.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nSCHOOL AND PLAY\r\n\r\n\r\nI am not certain whether Norse boys and girls are very good, or\r\nwhether they are spoilt. You may travel all day on a steamer with\r\na well-to-do family from the town, or you may live in a farmhouse\r\nwith a peasant\'s family for a month, and the chances are that you\r\nwill never hear the parents say "Don\'t." One thing I am sure of: the\r\nchildren who live in the country parts do very much as they please;\r\nin the summer they go to bed when they feel tired, sometimes not\r\ntill nearly midnight; and they are not worried about getting their\r\nboots and their clothes wet, because no Norwegian troubles his or her\r\nhead about such matters. Moreover, the life is such a simple one that\r\nperhaps there is little opportunity for real naughtiness.\r\n\r\nThese country children have a very easy time, as for the greater part\r\nof the year they have no school to go to, and they spend all the\r\nsummer out in the open air, looking after the ponies, cows, sheep,\r\nor goats, or hay-making, or rowing about, or fishing, or something\r\nof the kind. In the winter they, as well as the town children,\r\nare all obliged to go to school, from the age of seven to fourteen\r\nor fifteen--_i.e.,_ until their Confirmation, and until this takes\r\nplace they receive religious instruction from the priest on Sunday\r\nafternoons, for there is no religious teaching in the schools.\r\n\r\nThere is a great difficulty about the country schools, because in\r\nsome districts the farms are miles and miles apart, and it would be\r\nquite impossible for the children to walk to school and back in the\r\nday. In such districts the Government schoolmasters have to go about\r\nfrom place to place, and teach the children in their own homes. If\r\nthere should be two or three farms close together, one of the farmers\r\nprovides a schoolroom in his house, and the schoolmaster lives with\r\nhim as his guest for a time, and then goes on to another house. But\r\nthe schoolmasters must give every child twelve weeks\' schooling in\r\nthe year. This does not amount to a great deal--only three months of\r\nschool in the year!\r\n\r\nThe wonder is that the children contrive to remember anything that\r\nthey have learned, with nine long months in which to forget it. Yet\r\nthey work hard while they are about it; they are inspected every\r\nyear, and they are required to pass quite difficult examinations at\r\nthe end. It is expected, however, that before long the twelve weeks\'\r\ncompulsory schooling will be increased to fifteen weeks.\r\n\r\nIn the towns the children are not forced to attend school for more than\r\nthe twelve weeks in the year, but there are, of course, numbers of\r\nprivate schools, high schools, etc., to which parents can send their\r\nchildren, on payment, for a superior education. And at such schools\r\nthe work goes on for a much longer period of the year--in fact, all\r\nthrough the year, except for two months in the summer and a week at\r\nChristmas and at Easter.\r\n\r\nIt is all much the same as our own arrangements in England. There\r\nis the Government school, where the education is free, and there are\r\nother schools, where a higher education is paid for. But the compulsory\r\nschooling does not end with the seven years at the Government schools\r\nreferred to above, for there are continuation schools, at which the\r\npupils have to put in a further twenty-four weeks.\r\n\r\nIn Norway there are no large public schools for boarders, so, in spite\r\nof their long holidays, the children do not have half the fun that\r\nEnglish boys and girls have. There is no cricket, football, hockey,\r\ngolf, or any game of that sort, and there is not a racquet-, fives-,\r\nor tennis-court in the land. How then, you will ask, do they manage\r\nto amuse themselves?\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that the winter is much longer in Norway than it\r\nis with us, and even if the boys wanted to play football they would not\r\nbe able to do so, as the ground is covered with snow. At that season\r\nthey have their various winter sports to keep them busy--ski-ing,\r\nskating, tobogganing, and the like, and they do not require any other\r\ngames. In the summer, instead of playing cricket, they go for walking\r\ntours into the mountains, or they go fishing in the rivers and lakes,\r\nor sometimes shooting.\r\n\r\nThough the Norwegians boast that ball games have been played in the\r\ncountry since Saga times, such games are of the most elementary kind,\r\nand would be scorned by any English boy. But for all that the Norse\r\nboys are every bit as manly as any other boys, because they enjoy\r\nmany forms of sport which make them so; and they are strong, because\r\nthey take plenty of exercise, and have physical drill in their schools.\r\n\r\nThis brings us to other games played by Norwegian children--not the\r\ngames which are purchased in the shops in Christiania, Bergen, and\r\nother towns, but the games which are played without any of the bought\r\nthings. Of course the girls have dolls and dolls\' houses and dolls\'\r\ntea-parties, like the girls of every land, and there are toys of\r\nevery description in the shops. The peasant children, however, who\r\nlive far out in the country, never see a shop, and have to provide\r\nthemselves with things to play with; but it is wonderful what an\r\namount of amusement they can get out of an old bone, or a block of\r\nwood, tied to a yard or two of string.\r\n\r\nAs a rule their fathers are good hands at carving wood, so toys are\r\neasily made for the smaller children, and one finds everywhere such\r\nsimple toys as wooden dolls, animals, miniature boats, sleighs,\r\nand carts.\r\n\r\nBut the real enjoyment of the Norwegian children--at any rate of the\r\ngirls--is the outdoor game, played when the weather is fine, both\r\nin the town and in the country, wherever there are enough children\r\nto make a game. To see a bevy of these quaint little girls throwing\r\nheart and soul into their games is delightful, and they have scores\r\nand scores of different ones. In most of them dancing and singing play\r\na great part, and the most popular form of game is what is called a\r\n"Ring Dance," in which, as the name implies, the players join hands\r\nand dance round in a circle.\r\n\r\nMany of these ring dances have their counterpart in English games,\r\nand the tunes and words sung to them are almost similar. Whether we\r\nadopted them from the Norwegians, or they adopted them from us, is a\r\nmatter which will probably never be decided, but several games of this\r\nkind are common to all Europe. "Blind Man\'s Buff," "Hunt the Slipper,"\r\nand "Forfeits," for instance, are found nearly everywhere. Here\r\nis the Norse version of "Round and round the Mulberry Bush," which\r\nin some parts is called "The Washing-Maids\' Dance," and in others\r\n"Round the Juniper Bush":\r\n\r\n\r\n    "So we go round the juniper bush, the juniper bush, the juniper\r\n                                                            bush,\r\n    So we go round the juniper bush early on Monday morning.\r\n    This is the way we wash our clothes, wash our clothes, wash\r\n                                                        our clothes,\r\n    This is the way we wash our clothes early on Monday morning.\r\n\r\n    "So we go round the juniper bush, the juniper bush, the juniper\r\n                                                            bush,\r\n    So we go round the juniper bush early on Tuesday morning.\r\n    This is the way we ring out our clothes, ring out our clothes,\r\n                                                ring out our clothes,\r\n    This is the way we ring out our clothes early on Tuesday morning."\r\n\r\n\r\nThe washing operations proceed through the next three days of the week,\r\nwith a verse to each day. Thus on Wednesday they hang up the clothes,\r\non Thursday they mangle them, and on Friday iron them. Then on Saturday\r\nthey scrub the floor, and on Sunday go to church.\r\n\r\nWith each verse the children dance hand in hand round the imaginary\r\njuniper bush, singing lustily, and illustrating the different actions\r\nof the washing operations. Finally, two and two and arm in arm,\r\nthey promenade round, as if going to church, and generally prolong\r\nthe walk while they sing the last verse a second time.\r\n\r\nAnother very favourite game is _Sl\xc3\xa6ngkompas_, which is perhaps best\r\ntranslated almost literally as Scatter-Compass. It is a rapid game,\r\nand full of excitement. The players grasp hands in a circle and gallop\r\nround, singing the refrain as they go:\r\n\r\n\r\n    "Those who would join in _Sl\xc3\xa6ngkompas_ must be tolerably quick!\r\n    One--two--three--and four--and five.\r\n    So comes _Sl\xc3\xa6ngkompas_ again."\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the counting begins the players let go hands, and, clapping to\r\nthe tune, spin round separately until the word "five" is reached,\r\nwhen they should be in position ready to join hands again and continue\r\nto gallop round in the original circle.\r\n\r\nThe aim of the game is to keep things going until the verse has been\r\nsung three times, but, of course, the players often become giddy and\r\nlose their places.\r\n\r\nThere is not space to describe more of these ring dances here, but\r\nthere are many of them, and a great many which our English children\r\nwould do well to adopt.\r\n\r\nOur good old street game of "Hop-scotch" you may see played\r\nalmost anywhere in Norway under the somewhat curious name of\r\n"Hop-in-Paradise," while in some parts "Cat\'s Cradle," though a milder\r\nform of amusement, is quite popular, and a large variety of figures\r\nis known.\r\n\r\nThen the girls are very fond of dressing up as brides, with crowns\r\nand all, and having a mock wedding, with its accompanying procession\r\nand dancing. Above all things they love dancing, and their fathers and\r\ngrandfathers play the fiddle for them for many an hour of a winter\'s\r\nevening, while the mothers sing nursery rhymes to the smaller\r\nchildren. And, as with the games, these jingles are more or less\r\nthe same as our own. They have "This is the house that Jack built,"\r\nwith the malt, and the rat, and everything, only that they prefer\r\nthe name Jacob to Jack. They have "Fly away, Peter, fly away, Paul";\r\nand the baby on his mother\'s knee has the joy of being shaken about to\r\n"This is the way the farmer rides, bumpety-bumpety-bump."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nSOME FAIRY TALES\r\n\r\n\r\nNorwegian children are just as fond of fairy stories as are any\r\nother children, and they are lucky in having a great number, for\r\nthat famous story-teller, Hans Christian Andersen, was a Dane, and\r\nas the Danish language is very like the Norwegian, his stories were\r\nprobably known in Norway long before they were known in England. But\r\nthe Norwegians have plenty of other stories of their own, and they\r\nlove to sit by the fire of burning logs or round the stove in the\r\nlong winter evenings and listen to them. Of course, they know all\r\nabout people like Cinderella and Jack the Giant-Killer, but their\r\nfavourite hero is called by the name of Ashpot, who is sometimes a\r\nkind of boy Cinderella and sometimes a Jack the Giant-Killer.\r\n\r\nThe following are two stories which the little yellow-haired Norse\r\nchildren gloat over:\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time there was a man who had been out cutting wood, and\r\nwhen he came home he found that he had left his coat behind, so he\r\ntold his little daughter to go and fetch it. The child started off,\r\nbut before she reached the wood darkness came on, and suddenly a\r\ngreat big hill-giant swooped down upon her.\r\n\r\n"Please, Mr. Giant," said she, trembling all over, "don\'t take me\r\naway to-night, as father wants his coat; but to-morrow night, if you\r\nwill come when I go to the _stabbur_ to fetch the bread, I will go\r\naway with you quite quietly."\r\n\r\nSo the giant agreed, and the next night, when she went to fetch the\r\nbread, he came and carried her off. As soon as it was found that she\r\nwas missing, her father sent her eldest brother to look for her, but\r\nhe came back without finding her. The second brother was also sent,\r\nbut with no better result. At last the father turned to his youngest\r\nson, who was the drudge of the house, and said: "Now, Ashpot, you go\r\nand see if you can find your sister."\r\n\r\nSo away went Ashpot, and no sooner had he reached the wood than he\r\nmet a bear.\r\n\r\n"Friend bear," said Ashpot, "will you help me?"\r\n\r\n"Willingly," answered the bear. "Get up on my back."\r\n\r\nAnd Ashpot mounted the bear\'s back and rode off. Presently they met\r\na wolf.\r\n\r\n"Friend wolf," said Ashpot, "will you do some work for me ?"\r\n\r\n"Willingly," answered the wolf.\r\n\r\n"Then jump up behind," said Ashpot, and the three went on deeper into\r\nthe wood.\r\n\r\nThey next met a fox, and then a hare, both of whom were enlisted into\r\nAshpot\'s service, and, mounted on the back of the bear, were swiftly\r\ncarried off to the giant\'s abode.\r\n\r\n"Good-day, Mr. Giant!" said they.\r\n\r\n"Scratch my back!" roared the giant, who lay stretched in front of\r\nthe fire warming himself.\r\n\r\nThe hare immediately climbed up and began to scratch as desired; but\r\nthe giant knocked him over, and down he fell on to the hearth-stone,\r\nbreaking off his fore-legs, since which time all hares have had\r\nshort fore-legs.\r\n\r\nThe fox next clambered up to scratch the giant\'s back, but he was\r\nserved like the hare. Then the wolf\'s turn came, but the giant said\r\nthat he was no better at scratching than the others.\r\n\r\n"_You_ scratch me!" shouted the giant, turning impatiently to the bear.\r\n\r\n"All right," answered Bruin; "I know all about scratching," and he\r\nforthwith dug his claws into the giant\'s back and ripped it into a\r\nthousand pieces.\r\n\r\nThen all the beasts danced on the dead body of the monster, and\r\nAshpot recovered his sister and took her home, carrying off, at the\r\nsame time, all the giant\'s gold and silver. The bear and the wolf\r\nburst into the cattle-sheds and devoured all the cows and sheep,\r\nthe fox feasted in the henroost, while the hare had the free run of\r\nthe oatfield. So everyone was satisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe other story is also about Ashpot, whose two elder brothers\r\nstill treated him very badly, and eventually turned him out of his\r\nhome. Poor Ashpot wandered away up into the mountains, where he met\r\na huge giant. At first he was terribly afraid, but after a little\r\nwhile he told the giant what had happened to him, and asked him if\r\nhe could find a job for him.\r\n\r\n"You are just the very man I want," said the giant. "Come along\r\nwith me."\r\n\r\nThe first work to be done was to make a fire to brew some ale, so they\r\nwent off together to the forest to cut firewood. The giant carried a\r\nclub in place of an axe, and when they came to a large birch-tree he\r\nasked Ashpot whether he would like to club the tree down or climb up\r\nand hold the top of it. The boy thought that the latter would suit\r\nhim best, and he soon got up to the topmost branches and held on to\r\nthem. But the giant gave the tree such a blow with his club as to\r\nknock it right out of the ground, sending Ashpot flying across the\r\nmeadows into a marsh. Luckily he landed on soft ground, and was none\r\nthe worse for his adventure; and they soon managed to get the tree\r\nhome, when they set to work to make a fire.\r\n\r\nBut the wood was green, and would not burn, so the giant began to\r\nblow. At the first puff Ashpot found himself flying up to the ceiling\r\nas if he had been a feather, but he managed to catch hold of a piece of\r\nbirch-bark among the rafters, and on reaching the ground again he told\r\nthe giant that he had been up to get something to make the fire burn.\r\n\r\nThe fire was soon burning splendidly, and the giant commenced to brew\r\nthe ale, drinking it off as fast as it was made. Ashpot watched him\r\ngetting gradually drunk, and heard him mutter to himself, "To-night\r\nI will kill him," so he began to think of a plan to outwit his\r\nmaster. When he went to bed he placed the giant\'s cream-whisk between\r\nthe sheets as a dummy, while he himself crept under the bedstead.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the night, just as he had expected, he heard the\r\ngiant come into his room, and then there was a tremendous whack as\r\nthe giant brought his club down on to the bed. Next morning the boy\r\ncame out of his room as if nothing had happened, and his master was\r\nvery much surprised to find him still alive.\r\n\r\n"Hullo!" said the giant. "Didn\'t you feel anything in the night?"\r\n\r\n"I did feel something," said Ashpot; "but I thought that it was only\r\na sausage-peg that had fallen on the bed, so I went to sleep again."\r\n\r\nThe giant was more astonished than ever, and went off to consult\r\nhis sister, who lived in a neighbouring mountain, and was about ten\r\ntimes his size. At length it was settled that the giantess should\r\nset her cooking-pot on the fire, and that Ashpot should be sent to\r\nsee her, when she was to tip him into the caldron and boil him. In\r\nthe course of the day the giant sent the boy off with a message to\r\nhis sister, and when he reached the giantess\'s dwelling he found her\r\nbusy cooking. But he soon saw through her design, and he took out of\r\nhis pocket a nut with a hole in it.\r\n\r\n"Look here," he said, showing the nut to the ogress, "you think you\r\ncan do everything. I will tell you one thing that you can\'t do: you\r\ncan\'t make yourself so small as to be able to creep into the hole in\r\nthis nut."\r\n\r\n"Rubbish!" replied the giantess. "Of course I can!"\r\n\r\nAnd in a moment she became as small as a fly, and crept into the nut,\r\nwhereupon Ashpot hurled it into the fire, and that was the end of\r\nthe giantess.\r\n\r\nThe boy was so delighted that he returned to his old tyrant the giant\r\nand told him what had happened to his sister. This set the big man\r\nthinking again as to how he was to rid himself of this sharp-witted\r\nlittle nuisance. He did not understand boys, and he was afraid of\r\nAshpot\'s tricks, so he offered him as much gold and silver as he\r\ncould carry if he would go away and never return. Ashpot, however,\r\nreplied that the amount he could carry would not be worth having,\r\nand that he could not think of going unless he got as much as the\r\ngiant could carry.\r\n\r\nThe giant, glad to get rid of him at any cost, agreed, and, loading\r\nhimself with gold and silver and precious stones, he set out with the\r\nboy towards his home. When they reached the outskirts of the farms\r\nthey saw a herd of cattle, and the giant began to tremble.\r\n\r\n"What sort of beasts are these?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"They are my father\'s cows," replied Ashpot, "and you had better put\r\ndown your burden and run back to your mountain, or they may bite you."\r\n\r\nThe giant was only too happy to get away, so, depositing his load,\r\nwhich was as big as a small hill, he made off, and left the boy to\r\ncarry his treasure home by himself.\r\n\r\nSo enormous was the amount of the valuables that it was six years\r\nbefore Ashpot succeeded in removing everything from the field where\r\nthe giant had set it down; but he and all his relations were rich\r\npeople for the rest of their lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE HARDANGER FJORD\r\n\r\n\r\nAll that is grand, all that is beautiful, will be found in the\r\nHardanger--the "Smiling Hardanger," as the Norwegians themselves call\r\nit; and even if an English visitor went nowhere else, he would have\r\nseen typical Norwegian scenery of every possible kind.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to go there is from Bergen, and most people bent\r\non a tour in Norway make a start either from Christiania or from\r\nBergen. Bergen itself claims to be the most beautiful town in the\r\ncountry, and it really is a lovely spot, with its old wooden houses\r\nall around the harbour, full of picturesque shipping, and with its\r\namphitheatre of bold mountains rising upwards almost from the centre\r\nof the town. But Bergen has its drawbacks, and the principal one is\r\nthat it rains every day, or nearly every day.\r\n\r\nTo reach the Hardanger from Bergen, and to go from one end of the fjord\r\nto the other, you take a passage in one of the comfortable little\r\nlocal steamers, and you begin your journey early in the morning. It\r\nis a very pleasant way of travelling, as you sit on deck all day and\r\nenjoy the scenery, and only go down to the saloon at meal-times. If\r\nyou do not wish to go all the way to the very end of the fjord,\r\nthere are numbers of pretty little places where you can break your\r\njourney. But if you like you can travel throughout the day and finish\r\nup late at night at Odda, or at Vik-i-Eidfjord, each of which is at\r\nthe head of a branch of the Hardanger Fjord.\r\n\r\nLet us take our tickets right through to Eidfjord, make a good long\r\nday of it, and see what there is to be seen. For some little time\r\nafter leaving the harbour we see nothing of great interest, only a few\r\ngraceful-looking barges in full sail, reminding us of the pictures of\r\nthe old Viking ships, and flocks of seagulls fluttering and screaming\r\nround the stern of our boat. Then the steamer begins to pick its way\r\nthrough the scattered islands, some of which are mere barren granite\r\nrocks, others partially cultivated, and with neat little farmsteads\r\nlying snug in the valleys.\r\n\r\nSo we go on for an hour or two, occasionally stopping off a small group\r\nof farms, to land, perhaps, a farmer returning from the Bergen market,\r\nor a girl coming home from her situation in the town. Presently we\r\ncome alongside a pier under an overhanging cliff, and we see the\r\nname of the place written up on a board, just like the name of a\r\nrailway-station. This is God\xc3\xb6sund, a favourite holiday haunt of\r\nthe Bergen people. It is not a town or even a village, but just a\r\nch\xc3\xa2let-like hotel of two or three buildings, standing on the side\r\nof a fir-clad hill, in the midst of a fairyland of creeks and wooded\r\nislets--as pretty a spot as one could wish to see.\r\n\r\nNow we are nearing the Hardanger Fjord; we pass through the narrow\r\nstraits known as the L\xc3\xb6ksund, and we enter the fjord. Glorious and\r\never-changing views open out before us, as hour after hour the steamer\r\npasses from one small station to another, dropping a mail-bag, and\r\nperhaps a passenger or two. We pass farms lying close to the shore,\r\nthe wooden houses being in many cases painted red or white, and thus\r\nforming a brilliant contrast to the blue-black mountains and dark\r\ngreen forests which rise up behind them. We see every now and then\r\na clean white wooden church, and, away up on the mountain-sides we\r\ncan discern tiny specks, which, we are told, are the s\xc3\xa6ter dwellings.\r\n\r\nSometimes the steamer is out in the middle of the fjord, which, in\r\nparts, is five miles or more in width, but at other times we find\r\nourselves close in to a rocky precipice, and wondering how it will\r\nbe possible to avoid grounding. Above us the mountain-side rises\r\nperpendicularly to a height of, it may be, 3,000 or 4,000 feet;\r\nand, looking down into the clear water, we can see that it is ever\r\nso deep. As a matter of fact, the chart tells us that hereabouts it\r\nis a little more than 2,000 feet in depth.\r\n\r\nSoon we reach the bay in which is Rosendal, where one could spend\r\na very pleasant week or so, with trout fishing to be had in the\r\nstreams and lakes, and mountain walks up to the edge of the great\r\nFolgefond snowfield. The steamer calls for a few minutes, and then\r\ngoes on up the beautiful little branch fjord known as the Mauranger,\r\nat the extremity of which lies Sundal.\r\n\r\nThe scenery here is delightful, and especially so at the spot where\r\nthe Bondhus Valley is seen stretching down to the fjord. Half-way\r\nup the valley a round-topped mountain appears to bar the way, and\r\nfarther off a blue-grey glacier--the Bondhus Br\xc3\xa6--is seen falling\r\nfrom the white snowfield, and choking the head of the vale.\r\n\r\nThose who have the mind to do so can wander up to the glacier, sleep\r\nthe night at a s\xc3\xa6ter, and on the following day hire a sleigh, and\r\ncareer for miles over the vast field of perpetual snow, right across\r\nthe headland to Odda. And great is the joy of plunging suddenly,\r\non a hot August day, into the depths of winter.\r\n\r\nBut our steamer does not stay here long--only long enough to put some\r\nNorwegian passengers on shore, and take fresh ones on board. This\r\noccupies some time, however, for Norse people, and especially the\r\nladies, refuse to be hurried. It is amusing to watch them starting\r\non their travels. All their friends come to see them off, although\r\nit is quite possible that the traveller is only going to the next\r\nstation on the fjord, not a dozen miles away. Each friend bears\r\nsome small package--a pot of cranberry jam, a basket of apples or\r\ncherries, a bag of cakes, or something of that kind. The gaily-painted\r\nwooden trunks and the _tiners_ are stowed away on board; and then the\r\n"farvels" commence, with kisses and handshakes, and pats on the back,\r\nand many last words until the bell rings for the steamer\'s departure,\r\nwhen a lady passenger suddenly discovers that she has left something\r\nbehind. The wildest confusion follows, and away run all the friends to\r\nfetch it from the house, returning just in time. Then the good-byes\r\nbegin again, and as the steamer finally departs, everyone shouts,\r\n"Farvel! farvel! farvel!" frequently and rapidly; hats are raised,\r\nand handkerchiefs continue waving until the boat can no longer be seen.\r\n\r\nReturning down the Mauranger Fjord we steam out across the main\r\nfjord, and early in the afternoon call at several small places on the\r\nnorthern shore--Bakke, Vikingn\xc3\xa6s, Nordheimsund--each with its spruce\r\nhotel, enticing the traveller to loiter and explore the country in\r\nthe neighbourhood. A little later we enter the Fiksensund, a narrow\r\nbranch fjord, and a wonder of wonders. For a distance of seven miles\r\nit wends its way amongst the mountains. In places the precipitous\r\nhillsides are within a hundred yards of each other, and in no part is\r\nthis extraordinary fjord-arm a third of a mile in width. For thousands\r\nof feet sheer out of the water rise the bold walls of granite, with\r\nhere and there a ledge thickly wooded with fir and birch. It looks as\r\nif the mountains had been torn asunder to admit the sea, and local\r\nlegends say that a spiteful giantess did this and many other nasty\r\nthings in the giant age. Half-way up the fjord the steamer fires a\r\ngun, so that the passengers may hear the echo, and the sound comes\r\nback time after time from every nook and cranny. At the end is Botnen,\r\nwith a road running away north to other farms, and eventually to the\r\nrailway from Bergen to Vossevangen.\r\n\r\nAgain we return to the main fjord, and before long enter the\r\nGravensfjord, wherein lies Eide, a kind of junction of the\r\nsteamer-routes, and a very touristy place, as there is a good\r\ndriving-road to Voss. The Bergen steamer continues its way up\r\nthe S\xc3\xb6rfjord to Odda, which is reached late at night; but we,\r\nwho are bound for Eidfjord, change into a small branch steamer,\r\nand are soon rounding a mighty headland, and, if there is any wind,\r\ngetting a tossing for a few minutes, the fjord just here being wide\r\nand open. The head of a seal may occasionally be seen bobbing up\r\nand down, and large flocks of duck are always swimming about at a\r\nrespectful distance from the steamer. And what a view we have across\r\nthe expanse of water! The never-ending mountains stretch away one\r\nbehind the other, to be crowned in the distance by the dazzling white\r\nsnowfield, lighted up by the fast sinking sun.\r\n\r\nAnd when the sun goes down the scenery, as we steam on, changes\r\neach moment. In the twilight the granite cliffs stand out black and\r\nuninviting, and the country looks cold and grey. It may be that\r\nwe are tired of the long journey, for with the growing darkness\r\ncomes the feeling that something to eat and bed would be pleasant\r\nthings. Then the steamer\'s whistle makes us spring to our feet, and,\r\npeering ahead, we see lights on the Vik jetty and in the hotel close\r\nby. In a few minutes we are in N\xc3\xa6sheim\'s comfortable dining-room,\r\nenjoying our well-deserved supper after a day of days on Norway\'s\r\nmost glorious fjord.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nA GLIMPSE OF THE FJELDS\r\n\r\n\r\n"Fjeld-weather" is the Norwegian term for fine, warm, bright days. It\r\nimplies that the weather is suitable for a tour on the mountains. But,\r\nalas! it is not the weather that is always encountered there, for\r\neven in the summer the climate of the high plateau is ever varying,\r\nand though there may be a long spell of fine, hot weather, with\r\na glorious crisp air, yet at any moment a change of the wind may\r\nbring a week of soaking rain, sleet, possibly snow, and a fall of\r\ntemperature by twenty degrees. That is no time for the fjelds, and\r\nthe traveller is better off in a fjordside hotel.\r\n\r\nGiven fine weather, there is no more splendid touring ground than the\r\nhighlands of Norway, where, at a height of anything up to 4,000 or\r\n5,000 feet above the sea, stretch thousands of square miles of wild and\r\nuninhabited moorland, cut up with numerous large lakes, and clothed\r\nonly with a dwarf vegetation. Such parts usually lie off the beaten\r\ntrack, and to reach them means an expedition--heavy, uphill walking\r\nfor two or three days, with the baggage carried on the backs of ponies.\r\n\r\nIf you were going to undertake an expedition to these high fjelds,\r\nyou would probably make a start from the lowlands by following\r\nsome well-worn track leading to a s\xc3\xa6ter. In nine cases out of ten\r\nthe track will be running by the side of a river, at first wide and\r\nflowing lazily through the valley, but soon narrowing, until its upper\r\nwaters become a rushing mountain torrent, swishing between mighty\r\nboulders. After a while you find that the path gradually begins to\r\nascend by zigzags up the mountain-side, and the scenery, whenever\r\nyou pause to look down, is magnificent. In time you reach the upland\r\npastures, with here and there a s\xc3\xa6ter-dwelling, and this is the end\r\nof the first stage of your journey, for you probably will have climbed\r\nsome 2,000 feet and walked a dozen miles or more. Thus you will be glad\r\nenough to accept the hospitality offered to you by the simple peasants.\r\n\r\nAll these s\xc3\xa6ter-huts are much alike, though, of course, they vary\r\nin size and in the way in which they are fitted up; but as they are\r\nonly occupied during the summer months, luxurious fittings are not\r\nconsidered a necessity. The outer walls are constructed of fir-trunks,\r\nlet into one another at the corners on the log-hut principle, and\r\nthe interior is lined with boarding. In some parts, however, where\r\ntimber is scarce the buildings are of stone.\r\n\r\nThe roof consists of rough planks, on which is placed a layer of\r\nbirch-bark to fill in the cracks; and on the top, again, are laid\r\nsods of earth to a thickness of about a foot. Grass and weeds soon\r\ncover the roof, binding it together and keeping the rain out.\r\n\r\nThe door opens into a dark hall or chamber, which serves as a\r\nreceptacle for rubbish of all kinds--fishing-nets, tools, skins,\r\nempty milk-pans, and the like; and in the corner is a roughly-built\r\nfireplace for boiling the milk and for cooking. On one side of this\r\nhall is the door into the sole living apartment, which possesses\r\na window at one end, and against one of the side walls a couple of\r\nbunks, wherein three or four dairymaids sleep.\r\n\r\nSometimes there is a separate room, or even a detached hut,\r\nfor the dairy work; but there is generally only the one room,\r\nthe milk being set in large, shallow wooden vessels on a number of\r\nshelves fixed against one of the walls. Everything is scrupulously\r\nclean, and the cattle women are working hard all the long daylight\r\nhours. Periodically a man from the farm in the lowlands comes up to\r\nthe s\xc3\xa6ter with a couple of ponies and takes down butter and cheese,\r\nand such visits are the only excitement in s\xc3\xa6ter-life.\r\n\r\nIf you have time to linger here for a day or two you will be made\r\nwelcome, and you will find plenty to interest you. The views down into\r\nthe deep valleys and away to the fjords in the distance are always\r\ndelightful, and there may be a stream with pools holding trout worth\r\ntrying for. The tiny rivulets which trickle down from the hills are\r\nlined with ferns and forget-me nots, and elsewhere may be seen flowers\r\nof every hue--red Alpine catchfly, blue meadow cranesbill, hawksweed,\r\nwild radis, and a score of other pretty things.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest joy of all is the sight of a wide marsh covered with\r\nthe delicious _multeb\xc3\xa6r_, whose luscious, yellow fruit and gold-red\r\nleaves brighten the country-side. This is the cloudberry, found in\r\nScotland and in the North of England, and to come on a stretch of\r\nthis fruit after a long, hot walk is a thing worth living for. Besides\r\nthis best of all Norse wild fruits, the fjelds produce many excellent\r\nberries, such as crowberries, whortleberries, marsh whortleberries,\r\nbearberries, dewberries, cranberries, and others. The children of the\r\ncountry parts all over Norway spend much of their time in feasting\r\non these little fruits, and during the summer and autumn months their\r\nhands and faces are generally well stained with the dark juice.\r\n\r\nUpwards, beyond these pleasant pastures, when you have left behind\r\nthe last s\xc3\xa6ter-shanty and the last thicket of birches, you reach a\r\nworld where, except for the scattered Tourist Club huts and their\r\nsummer caretakers, you cannot count on coming across either dwelling\r\nor human being.\r\n\r\nWandering far afield, you may meet a couple of Lapps with their herd\r\nof reindeer, and down by one of the tarns you may chance on a rough\r\nstone shelter, inhabited for the time being by two Norwegian fishermen,\r\nwhose nets are laid in the mountain lake.\r\n\r\nAll over this lofty wilderness the snow lies deep for several months\r\nof the year, but as soon as it begins to thaw it disappears rapidly,\r\nwhen, as in Switzerland, Nature\'s garden immediately blossoms forth\r\nin all its glory. It must be confessed, however, that the carpet of\r\nAlpine flowers on the Norwegian high-fjelds cannot compare with that of\r\nSwitzerland. On the great mountain plateau of Norway everything gives\r\nway to the lichen-like reindeer moss, and the flowers are merely in\r\npatches, or growing in masses only in those swampy parts where the\r\nmoss does not thrive.\r\n\r\nThe fjelds furnish a recreation-ground for the Norwegian\r\ntownsman. There he can lead the life that he loves best, and one week\r\nof the wilds will set him up for the remainder of the year. Even though\r\nhe cares nothing for shooting or fishing, the sense of freedom as he\r\ndoes his daily tramp delights his soul. And his wife or his sister as\r\noften as not will accompany him, for the Norwegian ladies are brave\r\nwalkers, and know how to rough it.\r\n\r\nBut the majority of Norsemen are good sportsmen and good fishermen,\r\nand in most seasons there are plenty of fjeld-ryper to be shot and good\r\nhauls of trout to be made in the mountain lakes and connecting streams.\r\n\r\nBut what is the country like up here on the very summit of\r\neverything? It is called a plateau; but that does not mean that it\r\nis absolutely level, for, as a matter of fact, there is no part of\r\nit level enough to be made into a football ground. It is all up and\r\ndown, and every here and there are low hills, with occasionally great\r\nprominent, rounded mountain-tops, rising to a height of 500 or 600\r\nfeet above the plateau. Then there are chains of lakes, often several\r\nmiles in length, acres of swampy ground in every direction, shallow\r\nravines filled with a jumble of rocks and boulders, and constant sand\r\nmounds, partly overgrown with grass and dwarf juniper. And up here\r\nare the snowfields, about which we shall have more to say presently.\r\n\r\nIt is all weird and wild and wonderful, and if there be no wind the\r\nsilence is intense, and only broken by the bark of an Arctic fox from\r\nsome rocky hillside or by the plaintive call of a golden plover.\r\n\r\nWhy, it may be asked, should anyone wish to go to such a desolate\r\nplace? Only to shoot or to fish, to gather in a store of the purest\r\nair in the world, or perhaps to enjoy a period of calm and quiet\r\nsolitude--world-forgetting, by the world forgot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nWILD NATURE--BEASTS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a country like Norway, with its vast forests and waste moorlands,\r\nit is only natural to find a considerable variety of animals and\r\nbirds. Some of these are peculiar to Scandinavia. Some, though only\r\noccasionally met with in the British Isles, are not rare in Norway;\r\nwhilst others (more especially among the birds) are equally common\r\nin both countries.\r\n\r\nThere was a time when the people of England lived in a state of fear\r\nand dread of the ravages of wolves and bears, and the Norwegians of\r\nthe country districts even now have to guard their flocks and herds\r\nfrom these destroyers. Except in the forest tracts of the Far North,\r\nhowever, bears are not numerous, but in some parts, even in the South,\r\nthey are sufficiently so to be a nuisance, and are ruthlessly hunted\r\ndown by the farmers. As far as wolves are concerned civilization is,\r\nfortunately, driving them farther afield each year, and only in the\r\nmost out-of-the-way parts are they ever encountered nowadays. Stories\r\nof packs of hungry wolves following in the wake of a sleigh are still\r\ntold to the children in Norway, but they relate to bygone times--half\r\na century or more ago, and such wild excitements no longer enter into\r\nthe Norsemen\'s lives.\r\n\r\nYet less ferocious animals give the people trouble enough, and\r\namongst these may be mentioned the lynx and the wolverine, or glutton,\r\neach of which will make his supper off a sheep or a goat if he gets\r\nthe chance. Of the two the lynx is perhaps the worse poacher, and\r\nhis proverbial sharpness renders him difficult to catch. Not so the\r\nglutton, who, if he succeeds in crawling through a hole in the fence\r\nof a sheepfold, stuffs himself so full that he cannot get out again. I\r\nthink that most of us would rather be called lynx-eyed than gluttonous,\r\nand certainly a lynx is a much handsomer beast than a glutton.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the rabbit, all our English animals are found\r\nin Norway--the badger, fox, hare, otter, squirrel, hedgehog, polecat,\r\nstoat, and the rest of them. But besides these there are little Arctic\r\nfoxes and Arctic hares, with bluish-grey coats in the summer and\r\nsnowy-white ones in the winter. This change of colour is a provision\r\nof Nature, rendering these particular animals, and some birds also,\r\nalmost invisible among the snows. The ermine is another instance of\r\nthis. In summer he is just an ugly little brown stoat; but in winter\r\nhe comes out in pure white, with a jet-black tip to his tail, a skin\r\nworth a lot of money.\r\n\r\nOf all these small Norwegian animals perhaps the most interesting\r\nis the lemming, who, for some reason best known to himself, does not\r\ntrouble to put on a white coat in the winter, but keeps to his stripy\r\njacket all the year round. He lives everywhere--up on the mountains\r\nand down in the valleys, and is hardly as large as an ordinary rat;\r\nbut woe betide the dog that brings him to bay, for if he finds his\r\nroad to escape barred, he will sit up and fight to the death, and he\r\nknows how to bite. Yet he would much rather run away if he could,\r\nas in ordinary life he is quite peacefully inclined, and feeds on\r\nnothing more than grass and herbs and roots.\r\n\r\nBut there is a peculiarity about the lemming which makes the\r\ncountry-folk of Norway more afraid of him than of any other animal. In\r\nmost years you may wander about the country for weeks and never see a\r\nlemming, but occasionally there comes what is called a "lemming-year,"\r\nwhen more young lemmings are born than usual, and then the trouble\r\nbegins. They eat up everything round about their homes, and they begin\r\nto wander in search of food in packs of thousands, like swarms of\r\nlocusts. The farmers try to destroy them, but they soon give up the\r\nattempt, as for days and days the lemmings come on in great waves,\r\neating up the grass and the crops wherever they pass. Except the sea,\r\nnothing will stop them when once they have made a start; they come\r\ndown the mountain-sides, swim the rivers and streams, rush through the\r\nforests, and, eating as they go, devastate the farm-lands. They do not\r\nwander hither and thither, but keep to the same direction straight\r\nahead, until they eventually reach the sea. Whether they think that\r\nit is only another river to be crossed, or whether they think that\r\nthey have done enough damage for one lifetime, nobody knows; but into\r\nthe sea they all plunge madly, and, of course, are soon drowned.\r\n\r\nThis, however, does not end the nuisance, for thousands of them\r\ndie as they sweep over the country, leaving their dead bodies to\r\npoison the water, and thus making the people ill with what they term\r\n"lemming fever." So the pretty little lemmings are on occasions\r\nmore to be dreaded than are even bears and wolves, but fortunately\r\n"lemming-years" do not come round very often, and the whole country\r\nis not visited by the pest at the same time. They made their last\r\nbig raid in several districts in 1902, and they may come swarming\r\ndown from the mountains again any summer.\r\n\r\nI must now say something about the wild animals which are helpful\r\nto the people in that they provide them with food and bring money to\r\ntheir pockets. Foxes and other fur-bearing animals will always fetch\r\ngood prices. There are also the hares, especially the white ones,\r\nwhich are shot and snared in winter-time in great quantities, and\r\nsold all over Europe. You may see them hanging up in the poulterers\'\r\nshops in London. Then there is that huge beast, the elk, almost as\r\nbig as a small horse, who roams about the forests like his Canadian\r\nbrother, the moose, and is hunted and shot for his flesh, skin, and\r\nmassive flat horns. Red deer there are also in some parts of Norway;\r\nbut the animal of greatest interest is undoubtedly the reindeer.\r\n\r\nUp on the great mountain plateaux there are still plenty of wild\r\nreindeer roaming about in large herds, and numbers of them are shot\r\nevery autumn by the farmers, who sell the skins, and dry the meat\r\nto be eaten in the winter months. It is, however, the so-called tame\r\nreindeer which are so invaluable to the people of the North. Without\r\nthem it would be difficult, if not impossible, for the Laplanders to\r\nexist, and without them thousands of Norwegians would be poor indeed.\r\n\r\nIt is a popular idea that, in the winter, reindeer draw the sleighs\r\nall over Norway. As a matter of fact, it is only in the extreme North,\r\namong the Lapps, that reindeer are employed for this kind of work; and\r\nvery few Europeans ever have the opportunity of enjoying a drive in a\r\nreindeer "pulk," as the queer sleigh is called. That the experience\r\nis most exhilarating and exciting is certain. In the first place,\r\nthere is only one trace, connecting a kind of shoulder harness with\r\nthe forepart of the sleigh; again, there is only one rein coming from\r\na collar round the deer\'s neck, and consequently driving a reindeer\r\nas we drive a horse is, of course, out of the question. All that\r\nit is possible to do is to head him in the required direction, and\r\nhope for the best. A jerk of the rein sets him going; and, as often\r\nas not, he starts at a frantic gallop, kicking up the snow into the\r\ndriver\'s face until he is almost blinded, and careering right and\r\nleft at his own sweet will until he is tired. There is no difficulty\r\nabout keeping to the road, because there are no roads--only miles and\r\nmiles of snow, and the reindeer knows pretty well which way to go,\r\nsince the camping-places and habitations in these regions are limited.\r\n\r\nImagine what it would be like to jump into a boat-like "pulk" all\r\nalone--for there is only room for one--twist the rein round your wrist,\r\ngive it a flick, and so away over the waste of snow, watching the\r\ngreat antlers of the deer in front of you, and flinging yourself from\r\nside to side to prevent capsizing. And, if you do happen to upset,\r\nyou must hang on to the rein like grim death and be dragged over the\r\nsnow, otherwise the reindeer will either fly like the wind and be lost,\r\nor he may turn on you and attack you with his fore-hoofs.\r\n\r\nThese are the animals which are called the tame reindeer, but\r\ntheir tameness only consists in the fact that they are kept in herds\r\ntogether, and watched by men and dogs. They graze wherever they choose,\r\nand the men and the dogs have to follow them. When they are wanted\r\nfor driving, to be milked, or to be killed, the Lapp has to lasso\r\nthem over the horns, from a distance of thirty or forty yards, for no\r\nreindeer is ever sufficiently tame to permit a man to walk up to him.\r\n\r\nThe wealth of a Laplander depends on the number of reindeer which he\r\npossesses. They carry his baggage and draw his sleighs when encampments\r\nare moved; they provide him with milk and cheese, and, when killed,\r\nwith excellent meat. Their skins keep him warm at night, and out of\r\nthem are made boots, shoes, and leggings, as well as every kind of\r\narticle of leather which the Lapp has a use for. Horns, hoofs, and\r\nbones all have their value, and not so long ago the women did all\r\ntheir sewing with needles and threads made out of reindeer\'s bones\r\nand sinews. Moreover, after supplying their own wants, the herdsmen\r\ncan sell the surplus meat and skins, and thus obtain the wherewithal\r\nto buy other necessaries or luxuries.\r\n\r\nCows, horses, sheep, goats, or pigs would be out of place in Lapland,\r\nand would find nothing to eat. But the "camel of the Arctic Desert,"\r\nas the reindeer has been called, thrives in the cold without care or\r\nshelter, and subsists on the moss, which he obtains by scraping deep\r\nholes in the snow. Small wonder that he is a valuable beast to the\r\nLaplander, who, however, repays him only with blows and lashes.\r\n\r\nFarther south, on the Hardanger Fjeld and elsewhere, herds of tame\r\nreindeer have now been established by Norwegian companies as a new\r\nindustry. Lapps are hired to look after them, and the meat is sold\r\nin great quantities in many parts of Europe, especially in Paris. A\r\ngood trade is done also in the skins, for glove-making and other\r\npurposes. It is by no means difficult to have a look at one of these\r\nherds, and any visitor to Norway who finds himself within a day\'s\r\nclimb of the mountains whereon a herd is known to be grazing should do\r\nhis utmost to see the reindeer. He will find them not, like the deer\r\nin Richmond Park, waiting to be looked at, but timid and restless,\r\nand ready to take flight at the slightest provocation. Only the Lapp\r\nherdsmen and their dogs are able to control these wild children of\r\na wild land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nWILD NATURE--BIRDS\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat a place Norway must be for birds\'-nesting! There, if one went at\r\nthe right time, and did not mind roughing it, one might find eggs which\r\none could never come across in England, although laid by birds which\r\nare called British. But the Norwegians protect a great many of their\r\nbirds by law in the same way as we do, and if this had only been done\r\na hundred years ago the Great Auk would not have disappeared for ever.\r\n\r\nMost of our British birds are found in Norway at some time of the year,\r\nand many of our rarer birds are almost common in Norway--golden eagles,\r\nsnowy owls, ravens, ring-ouzels, and crested tits, for instance. As\r\nwith us, there are resident birds and migratory birds. Nearly all the\r\nkinds of birds which come from the South in the summer months to nest\r\nin the British Isles also go farther North and nest in Norway. You will\r\nfind swallows, martins, cuckoos, warblers, and others of our summer\r\nbirds all nesting over there, and you will find some varieties of\r\nsouthern birds which do not come to England, but go straight up from\r\nEastern or Central Europe to breed in the cool of the North. Amongst\r\nthese may be mentioned the blue-throated warbler, ortolan bunting,\r\nLapland bunting, shore lark, red-throated pipit, tree warbler, and\r\nmany others.\r\n\r\nThen there are birds which are common enough in England in the winter,\r\nbut which mostly go away to Norwegian breeding-grounds, such as geese,\r\nducks, woodcock, and snipe; while bramblings, fieldfares, and redwings\r\nare birds of the North, and never nest in Great Britain. Besides\r\nthese, there are a certain number of birds which have no claim to be\r\ntermed British, and which are found in Norway all the year round--the\r\nnut-cracker, several kinds of woodpecker, the ryper (the game-bird of\r\nthe country), and others. And, on the other hand, some of our common\r\nresident birds migrate from Norway in the winter.\r\n\r\nThe house-sparrow is as much at home in Norway as he is in every other\r\nland, but in winter he sticks close to the habitations, and were it\r\nnot for the fact that the people are bird-lovers, sparrows would have\r\na poor chance of picking up a living at this time of the year. Towards\r\nthe end of autumn it is a general custom to erect near the house a\r\nsheaf of corn on a pole, so that the small birds may have something\r\nto eat when the hard weather comes. And the ceremony of putting up\r\nthe pole is made the occasion for a feast for the children. They are\r\nthus not likely to forget the birds, and even in the towns one sees\r\nthese bundles of corn hanging outside the windows.\r\n\r\nIt is, perhaps, a little disappointing to find that robins in Norway\r\nare not associated with Christmas, but the fact remains that they are\r\nnot brave enough to risk starvation, and though a few of them are said\r\nto stay in the country, the bulk of them leave in September. But the\r\nwren takes the place of the robin as far as tameness and impertinence\r\nare concerned, as in winter he attaches himself to the peasant\'s\r\ncottage and makes himself quite at home, being known either as\r\n"Peter-of-the-Afternoon" or as "Tommy-round-the House." Magpies\r\nalso are great favourites with the country people at this season,\r\nas they become quite tame, and hop in and out of the cottages. They\r\nare regularly fed, and no one would dream of molesting them.\r\n\r\nThe Norwegians have several quaint old legends connected with some\r\nof their birds. This is the story of the gold-crest, known in Norway\r\nas the "bird king":\r\n\r\n"Once upon a time the golden eagle determined to be publicly\r\nacknowledged as king of the birds, and he called a meeting of every\r\nkind of bird in the world. As many of the birds would come from\r\ntropical countries, he appointed a day in the warmest month; and the\r\nplace he chose was a vast tract called Gr\xc3\xb6nfjeld, where every species\r\nof bird would feel at home, since it bordered on the sea, yet was\r\nwell provided with trees, shrubs, flowers, rocks, sand, and heather,\r\nas well as with lakes and rivers full of fish. So on the morning of\r\nthe great congress the birds began to arrive in a steady stream, and\r\nby noon every description of bird was represented--even the ostrich\r\n(though how he contrived to cross the seas the story does not say). The\r\neagle welcomed them, and when the last hummingbird had settled down he\r\naddressed the meeting, saying that there was no doubt that he had a\r\nright to demand to be proclaimed their king. The spread of his wings\r\nwas prodigious, he could fearlessly look at the sun, and to whatever\r\nheight he soared he could detect the slightest movement of a fly on\r\nthe earth. But the birds objected to him on account of his predatory\r\nhabits, and then each in turn stated his own case as a claimant for\r\nthe kingship--the ostrich could run the fastest, the bird of paradise\r\nand the peacock could look the prettiest, the parrot could talk the\r\nbest, the canary could sing the sweetest, and every one of them,\r\nfor some reason or other, was in his own opinion superior to his\r\nfellows. After several days of fruitless discussion it was finally\r\ndecided that whichever bird could soar the highest should be, once\r\nand for all, proclaimed king."\r\n\r\n"Every bird who could fly at all tried his best, and the golden\r\neagle, confident of success, waited till last. Eventually he spread\r\nhis wings, and as he did so an impudent little gold-crest hopped\r\n(unbeknown to his great rival) on to his back. Up went the eagle,\r\nand soon outdistanced every other bird. Then, when he had almost\r\nreached the sun, he shouted out, \'Well, here I am, the highest of\r\nall!\' \'Not so,\' answered the gold-crest, as, leaving the eagle\'s back,\r\nhe fluttered upwards, until suddenly he knocked his head against\r\nthe sun and set fire to his crest. Stunned by the shock, the little\r\nupstart fell headlong to the ground, but, soon recovering himself, he\r\nimmediately flew up on to the royal rock and showed the golden crown\r\nwhich he had assumed. Unanimously he was proclaimed _fuglekongen_\r\n(king of the birds), and by this name," concludes the legend, "he\r\nhas ever since been known, his sunburnt crest remaining as a proof\r\nof his cunning and daring."\r\n\r\nIn those parts of Norway where the gold-crest is rarely seen the\r\nsame story, omitting the part about the sun and the burnt crest,\r\nis told of the common wren, who is said to have broken off his tail\r\nin his great fall. And to this is applied a moral, viz.: Proud and\r\nambitious people sometimes meet with an unexpected downfall.\r\n\r\nBesides the three British woodpeckers, there are four other kinds\r\nresident in Norway, and of these the great black woodpecker is the\r\nlargest. The woodmen consider it to be a bird which brings bad luck,\r\nand avoid it as much as possible. They call it "Gertrude\'s Bird"\r\nbecause of the following legend: "Our Saviour once called on an old\r\nwoman who lived all alone in a little cottage in an extensive forest\r\nin Norway. Her name was Gertrude, and she was a hard, avaricious\r\nold creature, who had not a kind word for anybody, and although she\r\nwas not badly off in a worldly point of view, she was too stingy and\r\nselfish to assist any poor wayfarer who by chance passed her cottage\r\ndoor. One day our Lord happened to come that way, and, being hungry\r\nand thirsty, he asked of Gertrude a morsel of bread to eat and a\r\ncup of cold water to drink. But no, the wicked old woman refused,\r\nand turned our Saviour from the door with revilings and curses. Our\r\nLord stretched forth His hand towards the aged crone, and, as a\r\npunishment, she was immediately transformed into a black woodpecker;\r\nand ever since that day the wicked old creature has wandered about\r\nthe world in the shape of a bird, seeking her daily bread from wood\r\nto wood and from tree to tree." The red head of the bird is supposed\r\nto represent the red nightcap worn by Gertrude.\r\n\r\nLegends of this description were doubtless introduced in the early days\r\nof Christianity in order to impress the new religion on the people,\r\nand several have been preserved. Thus the turtle-dove is revered\r\nas a bird which spoke kind words to our Lord on the cross; and,\r\nsimilarly, the swallow is said to have perched upon the cross and to\r\nhave commiserated with Him; while the legend of the crossbill relates\r\nhow its beak became twisted in endeavouring to withdraw the nails,\r\nand how to this day it bears upon its plumage the red blood-stains\r\nfrom the cross.\r\n\r\nYet one more Christian legend--about the lapwing, or peewit: "The\r\nlapwing was at one time a hand-maiden of the Virgin Mary, and stole\r\nher mistress\'s scissors, for which she was transformed into a bird,\r\nand condemned to wear a forked tail resembling scissors. Moreover, the\r\nlapwing was doomed for ever and ever to fly from tussock to tussock,\r\nuttering the plaintive cry of \'Tyvit! tyvit!\'--_i.e.,_ \'Thief! thief!\'"\r\n\r\nIn the old Viking times, before Christianity had found its way so far\r\nNorth, the bird which influenced the people most was the raven. He\r\nwas credited with much knowledge, as well as with the power to bring\r\ngood or bad luck. One of the titles of Odin was "Raven-god," and he\r\nhad as messengers two faithful ravens, "who could speak all manner\r\nof tongues, and flew on his behests to the uttermost parts of the\r\nearth." In those days the figure of a raven was usually emblazoned\r\non shield and standard, and it was thought that as the battle raged\r\nvictory or defeat could be foreseen by the attitude assumed by the\r\nembroidered bird on the standard. And it is well known that William\r\nthe Conqueror (who came of Viking stock) flew a banner with raven\r\ndevice at the Battle of Hastings.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest use of all to which the sable bird was put was to\r\nguide the roving pirates on their expeditions. Before a start was\r\nmade a raven was let loose, and the direction of his flight gave the\r\nViking ships their course. In this manner, according to the old Norse\r\nlegends, did Floki discover Iceland; and many other extraordinary\r\nthings happened under the auspices of the raven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nWATERFALLS, SNOWFIELDS, AND GLACIERS\r\n\r\n\r\nA really fine waterfall is a most fascinating thing. Long before you\r\nreach it you hear the roar of the water, and see the spray ascending\r\nlike steam from a boiling caldron. Then when you stand before it,\r\nyou gaze in wonder on the never-ending rush of water, hurtling in\r\none great mass from top to bottom of the lofty cliff, or leaping in\r\nmighty bounds from ledge to ledge.\r\n\r\nNowhere in Europe can one see such a variety of waterfalls as in\r\nNorway, for every district has its _fos_, and in some districts the\r\ncascades are innumerable. In the Romsdal, for instance, an English\r\ntraveller once counted within a mile no fewer than seventy-three\r\nwaterfalls, "none of which were less than 1,000 feet high, while\r\nsome plunged down 2,000 feet." But the majority of these would only\r\nconsist of a single thread of water, not of that great, broad sheet\r\nwhich is the feature of the more famous falls.\r\n\r\nWhich of Norway\'s many waterfalls is the finest is a matter of\r\nopinion. Some people give the palm to the Rjukanfos (Telemarken), some\r\nto the Skj\xc3\xa6ggedalsfos [2] (or Ringedalsfos), some to the V\xc3\xb6ringfos,\r\nwhile others maintain that the Vettifos, the Tvindefos, and the\r\nTyssedalsfos are without rivals. The fact is that each of these\r\n(and other falls which could be named) has its own particular charm,\r\nand the last one visited always seems to be the best. A great deal\r\nalso depends on the time of year, and on the amount of snow which has\r\nfallen on the mountains during the preceding winter. For, it must be\r\nremembered, it is the rapid melting of the snow in the spring that\r\ngives to most of the Norwegian waterfalls such a volume of water in\r\nthe early months of the year.\r\n\r\nBut the summer rainfall on the high fjelds is always heavy, and\r\neven after all the snow of the year has melted, an immense amount\r\nof water has to drain away to the lowlands, and so to the sea. At\r\nfirst it collects in the tarns which fill the hollows of the mountain\r\nplateaux, but these, overflowing, soon send their surplus water by\r\ncertain channels away over the cliffs.\r\n\r\nThe greater waterfalls, however, are those which indirectly carry off\r\nthe water from the snowfields, the mountains capped with perpetual\r\nsnow; for, except during the frost-bound months of winter, these\r\nfalls are always full.\r\n\r\nThe snowfields are of themselves of immense interest, but so intimately\r\nare they connected with the glaciers that we shall speak of the two\r\ntogether. A snowfield may exist without a glacier, but a glacier\r\ncannot exist without a snowfield--that is to say, the glacier is made\r\nby the snowfield.\r\n\r\nHow snowfields came into existence nobody knows for certain, but it\r\nis generally supposed by learned people who have studied the matter\r\nthat, thousands of years ago, after what is called the Great Ice Age,\r\nNorway gradually put off her mantle of ice and snow and became what\r\nshe is now; but the snow on the higher parts of the land has never\r\nyet had time to melt right away, because fresh snow is always falling\r\nand adding to the pile. And it is the weight of all this fresh snow on\r\nthe top of the accumulation of centuries which produces the glaciers.\r\n\r\nThe Folgefond, in the Hardanger district, is the snowfield which most\r\npeople who visit Norway see sooner or later, and since it covers\r\nan area of 120 square miles, at a height of about 5,500 feet above\r\nthe sea, it is visible from a great many points of view. It forms a\r\nbackground to many a picture of the varied scenery of the Hardanger\r\nFjord, and it has the advantage of being easily accessible.\r\n\r\nOf course, the belief in the old popular legends is dying out even in\r\nNorway, but there are still some aged grandfathers and grandmothers\r\nliving near the great snowfield who can tell the tales as they were\r\ntold to them. Thus they relate that where the Folgefond now lies was\r\nonce a fertile and well-peopled valley, called Folgedalen, and that in\r\none night its farms, forests, people, and cattle were buried in snow as\r\na judgment for some great sin. One story ascribes the misfortune to the\r\ncurse of a gipsy woman, who had been refused alms by the priest; while\r\nanother relates that the valley was overwhelmed because the inhabitants\r\nhad murdered their liege lord, the petty King of the district.\r\n\r\nBut why it happened and how it happened does not really much matter,\r\nfor there the vast field of snow is to-day, and there it will doubtless\r\nremain for many centuries to come. As has been said, you can go up\r\nto the top of it and sleigh across a portion of its summit, or you\r\ncan potter round about it and examine its many glaciers.\r\n\r\nThe two largest glaciers of the Folgefond are the Buar Br\xc3\xa6, near\r\nOdda, and the Bondhus Br\xc3\xa6, near Sundal, and to spend a day at either\r\nof them is a real treat. But it is not wise to visit these glaciers\r\nwithout someone who knows them, for one might easily fall into one\r\nof the great fissures in the ice, known as crevasses, especially if\r\nlately-fallen snow had hidden the opening of the mighty crack.\r\n\r\nA glacier, as most people know (now that everyone goes to Switzerland,\r\nif not to Norway), is nothing more than a river of ice; not a nice,\r\nclean, smooth sheet of ice, but a rough mass of frozen billows,\r\nalmost blue in colour, and generally covered with sand, dust, and\r\nstones of all sizes. Wherever, beneath the edge of a snowfield,\r\nthe country shapes itself into a valley, there you will find a glacier.\r\n\r\nIf you make a snowball, and keep pressing and kneading it in your\r\nhands, you will soon convert it into a solid lump of ice. That is\r\njust what the sun does to the snowfield. It keeps melting the new\r\nsnow, and this presses down into the old snow, so that the weight\r\nof the whole thing squeezes out the frozen snow into the valleys in\r\nthe form of glaciers. And, as this process goes on year after year,\r\nthe glacier would naturally keep going lower and lower down into the\r\nvalley were it not for the fact that the point (or snout, as it is\r\ntermed) of the glacier very frequently breaks off, and disappears into\r\nthe torrent of ice-water which flows away from it. So some glaciers,\r\nalthough always moving, never grow any longer, but others creep a\r\nlittle bit farther down each year.\r\n\r\nThere are many other interesting things about a glacier. One of them\r\nis the moraine, which consists of heaps of rocks and stones broken off\r\nfrom the edges of the valley by the great river of ice as it pushes\r\nits way imperceptibly forward. These rocks are embedded in the ice\r\nor borne on its surface, and are only given up when the extremity\r\nof the glacier melts away into the torrent. Some of the rocks thus\r\ntransported are of immense weight, and the torrent is powerless to\r\nmove them; year by year, therefore, the jumbled heap of boulders and\r\nrocks is added to until it often grows to an enormous size.\r\n\r\nAnother fine snowfield in the Hardanger district is the J\xc3\xb6kul,\r\na splendid white dome, whose melting snows help to swell the\r\nV\xc3\xb6ringfos. The J\xc3\xb6kul does not possess many large glaciers, but one\r\nof them has, in past years, been a great source of trouble to the\r\npeople who live near it. This is the Rembesdal glacier, at the far\r\nend of the Simodal Valley, near Eidfjord.\r\n\r\nThe Simodal is a beautiful and fertile valley, with farms on either\r\nbank of the river, which rushes through it to the fjord. This river\r\ncomes from the glacier, but not directly. The head of the valley is\r\nchoked by a high cliff, over which tumbles a grand waterfall, and\r\nthis issues from a large mountain lake, into the opposite end of which\r\ndescends the snout of the glacier, with a continuous stream of milky\r\nwater flowing from it. So far there is nothing peculiar in all this,\r\nbut the peculiarity lies higher up.\r\n\r\nSome little distance up the glacier, and almost at right angles to one\r\nside of it, is a rocky hollow or small valley, and into this the water\r\nbegins to pour in the spring as soon as the sun is strong enough to\r\nbegin to melt the snow. The great glacier blocks up the end of this\r\nhollow with a thick dam of ice, and before long a huge lake is formed.\r\n\r\nWhat used to happen every two or three years was that the pressure of\r\nthe water in this dammed-up lake became so tremendous that the glacier\r\nat last could resist it no longer. Away went the side and lower part\r\nof the glacier, and with one mighty crash the water escaped. Down\r\ninto the lower lake, and over the waterfall, the wall of solid water,\r\nseveral feet in height, descended into the valley. There it carried\r\ndestruction far and wide, sweeping away crops, cattle, farm buildings,\r\nbridges, and everything that came in its way. The loss of life also\r\nwas often considerable, for there was no warning other than the roar\r\nof the water as it burst into the valley.\r\n\r\nA few years ago, however, some Norwegian engineers devised a means of\r\naverting these terrible floods by enabling the upper lake to empty\r\nitself gradually. They constructed under the glacier an iron-lined\r\ntunnel, connecting the upper lake with the lower, and in this way the\r\nwater escaped at once. So the people of Simodal can now sleep in peace.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nDRIVING IN NORWAY\r\n\r\n\r\nLike Switzerland, Norway has splendid roads. No difficulty in\r\nroad-making seems to be too great for the Norwegian engineers to\r\novercome. One frequently sees miles of road cut out of the solid\r\nrock of some mountain-side, and skirting the edge of a fjord or\r\nlong lake. Again, a road may wind its way through a narrow gorge,\r\nwith precipices a thousand feet high on either hand, and down in the\r\ndepths a wild torrent, crossed every here and there by massive stone\r\nbridges; or, over the open mountains a road will zigzag upwards to\r\na pass in long loops, like the famous "Snake Road" near R\xc3\xb6ldal.\r\n\r\nAnd the surface of all these roads is hard and kept in good repair--at\r\nany rate, in the summer months. In the winter they are, of course,\r\nthick in snow, which, when beaten down by the sleigh traffic, forms\r\na new surface, which takes the wear and tear off the actual roadway\r\nfor several months.\r\n\r\nBut we are now writing of the summer, after the snow has all melted,\r\nthe snow-ploughs put on one side, and the roads recovered from the\r\nhavoc wrought by the streams of melting snow. Then the sleighs have\r\nbeen hidden away in the innermost recesses of barns and outhouses,\r\nand the driving season begins.\r\n\r\nDriving is one of the greatest enjoyments of Norwegian travel, though\r\ntoo much of it is perhaps wearisome. The best plan is to arrange a\r\ntour, so that some of it shall be by railway, some by steamer, some\r\nwalking, and some driving, and this is generally easy to manage. The\r\nparticular charm of driving is that the traveller can take his own\r\ntime, go his own pace, and stop when and where he chooses. In this\r\nmanner the scenery is capable of being more fully appreciated.\r\n\r\nUntil quite recently there were very few railways in Norway, and there\r\nare not many now. There are, however, plenty of excellent roads,\r\nand a well-organized system of posting. The posting-stations are\r\nsituated about ten miles apart, and consist usually of a small inn\r\nor farmhouse, where the traveller can demand food and lodgings, as\r\nwell as a change of conveyance and horses. The _skydsgut_ (literally\r\npost-boy, but frequently an old man, or even a woman), accompanies\r\nthe conveyance from his station to the next, and returns with it,\r\nthough nowadays it is more usual to engage a vehicle (if not also a\r\nhorse or pony) for a whole day\'s journey, which has the advantage of\r\navoiding the perpetual rearrangement of one\'s luggage.\r\n\r\nThere are four kinds of conveyance in general use: the _cal\xc3\xa8che_, drawn\r\nby a pair of horses, and something like a heavily-built victoria;\r\nthe _trille_, a light, four-wheeled trap with two horses; and the\r\n_stolkj\xc3\xa6rre_ and the _carriole_, the last two being the most popular\r\nand convenient vehicles for quick travelling.\r\n\r\nThe _stolkj\xc3\xa6rre_ is a rough, box-like cart, with a seat for two\r\npersons, and another little seat behind for the _skydsgut_. It has\r\nthe advantages of ample room for luggage, and economy when travelling\r\ntwo together, the hire of one _stolkj\xc3\xa6rre_ being less than that of two\r\n_carrioles_; but, having no springs, it jolts and jars its occupants\r\nmost unmercifully.\r\n\r\nThe _carriole_ may be considered to be the national vehicle of Norway,\r\nand is certainly the most comfortable. In appearance it resembles a\r\nminiature buggy, and it holds one person, who can stretch his legs\r\nin a long, narrow trough between the seat and the splash-board;\r\nor, by straddling the trough, the occupant can rest his feet on two\r\nconveniently-placed iron steps. The luggage is strapped on to a board\r\nbehind, and the _skydsgut_ sits on it. A day\'s drive in a _carriole_,\r\nif the weather be fine and the pony a good one, is a real pleasure,\r\nand an intelligent _skydsgut_ will enliven the journey with his\r\namusing babble, as well as with scraps of information about the\r\ncountry traversed.\r\n\r\nThe ponies are generally about thirteen hands in height, good-tempered,\r\nsure-footed, strong, and hardy, and think nothing of doing thirty or\r\nforty miles a day, if given an occasional rest. Driving them requires\r\nno great skill, and it is best to leave them as much as possible to\r\ntheir own devices, since reins and bit have very little influence\r\nover their movements. One may haul on to the reins for half an hour\r\nwithout inducing the pony to pull up, but the magic sound of the\r\n"burr-r-r" uttered by the _skydsgut_ will cause the little beast to\r\nstop dead. And he will not go on again until he hears the peculiar\r\nclick of his master\'s tongue. So the stranger in the _carriole_\r\nor _stolkj\xc3\xa6rre_ will do well to hold the reins for the sake of\r\nappearances, and allow his _skydsgut_ to do the rest.\r\n\r\nOne word of comfort to the adventurous driver: Do not be alarmed\r\nif you notice that the harness is dropping to pieces. Your henchman\r\n(up behind) will soon put matters right with some scraps of string\r\nand a few bits of stick.\r\n\r\nBut the actual drive--how lovely it all is! Now you are passing up a\r\nvalley among the hayfields and orchards which border the river, and\r\nby the roadside you find a profusion of wild flowers--great purple\r\ngentians, blue harebells, yellow mountain globe flowers, and other\r\nblossoms of varied colours. Butterflies there are also in abundance,\r\nand, if you be an entomologist, your heart will rejoice at the sight of\r\nsuch rare English insects as the Camberwell Beauty, the Northern Brown,\r\nand others. Now you enter a dark pine-forest, to find yourself before\r\nlong emerging on to an open stretch of wild moorland; and so you cross\r\nthe col, and commence to drop down into another valley, narrow and\r\nshut in by towering mountains. Waterfalls sparkle in the sun as they\r\ntumble over the cliffs, and the still unmelted snow stands out white\r\nand glistering on the distant hill-tops. The road swings from side to\r\nside of the valley, crossing the torrent in its bottom by stout timber\r\nbridges, and at last you reach the margin of the great lake, where\r\nstands the neat little inn ready to provide you with your midday meal.\r\n\r\nThe organized tours, however short they be, always include a drive of\r\nthis description, and no Englishman would consider that he had visited\r\nNorway unless he had driven through a part of the country. Even in\r\na week one can cover a deal of ground. One can go by steamer from\r\nBergen up the Hardanger Fjord to Eide, and thence drive across the\r\nneck of land to the Sogne Fjord, through the finest and most varied\r\nscenery imaginable, returning to Bergen, if needs be, by steamer down\r\nthe Sogne Fjord. Or, if there be a few days to spare, one can steam\r\nacross the head of the Sogne Fjord from Gudvangen to L\xc3\xa6rdals\xc3\xb6ren, and\r\nthence again take _carriole_ or _stolkj\xc3\xa6rre_ to the Fillefjeld, and so\r\nvisit the wildest of Norway\'s mountain districts, the Jotunheim--the\r\nHome of the Giants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nARCTIC DAYS AND NIGHTS\r\n\r\n\r\nEveryone has read of the midnight sun and of the sunless winter of the\r\nNorth. They are features of all tales of Arctic exploration. Yet, in\r\norder to see the sun shining at midnight or to experience pitch-dark\r\ndays, it is not necessary to be actually a seeker after the North\r\nPole. Sunny nights and black winter days may be enjoyed, or otherwise,\r\neven in Norway, but only in the Far North--within the Arctic Circle.\r\n\r\nIt is not quite easy to realize what things are like right away up\r\nin the North, as it were, on the top of the world, and why things\r\nare as they are is difficult to explain without entering into a host\r\nof scientific details. We will, therefore, avoid a long discussion\r\nabout the movements of the earth and suchlike matters, and merely\r\nmention certain facts. At the North Pole itself there is continuous\r\nday for six months of the year, and continuous night for the other\r\nsix months, while on the line known as the Arctic Circle the sun\r\nshines at midnight once, and once only, in the year, and during one\r\nentire day of twenty-four hours in the winter it does not rise above\r\nthe horizon at all. South of the Arctic Circle there is no such thing\r\nas midnight sun or as a day without sunrise.\r\n\r\nAs far as Norway is concerned, a considerable tract of country lies\r\nwithin the Arctic Circle--in fact, an area rather larger than that\r\nof Ireland--so it is not very difficult to find a place where the\r\nmidnight sun can be seen for a period in the summer-time, and where\r\nin the winter some of the days are really dark. Of course, to see\r\nthe midnight sun it is necessary to be at the place selected at the\r\nright time, and even then there is always the chance of the sky being\r\nclouded over, and no sun visible. For the latter reason travellers\r\nwith plenty of leisure endeavour to go as far North as possible,\r\nso as to be almost certain of seeing the great sight.\r\n\r\nNowadays everything is made easy for everybody, and steamers take\r\npassengers to the North Cape throughout the summer for the sole purpose\r\nof enabling them to see the midnight sun from the very best point\r\nof view. Here, provided that the sky is clear, the midnight sun can\r\nbe seen from May 13 to July 31. Between those dates it does not set,\r\nand it would be a bad summer indeed if the clouds hid the sun for so\r\nlong a time.\r\n\r\nTo reach the North Cape takes a good deal of time, and many people\r\ndislike a lengthy sea voyage; but even if one starts from Bergen\r\nand goes all the way by sea, there is something of interest to be\r\nseen every day, as the steamer keeps close to the coast, threads its\r\nway among the innumerable small islands, and calls at many places\r\nwith beautiful scenery in the background, more especially Molde and\r\nChristiansund.\r\n\r\nA little farther on you come to Trondhjem; but if you would curtail\r\nthe sea voyage it is not necessary to take the steamer from Bergen,\r\nsince Trondhjem can be reached by rail from Christiania or by a\r\ndriving tour right through the country from various places. Onwards\r\nfrom Trondhjem, however, you must go by sea, unless you are prepared\r\nfor a long and rough overland journey.\r\n\r\nTrondhjem, the ancient capital of Norway, is a place of historic\r\ninterest, and contains the finest cathedral in Scandinavia. Its\r\nname means "throne home," as the old Kings of Norway used to reside\r\nthere, and it was the place where the coronation ceremony was always\r\nperformed. Though no longer the capital of the country, it is still\r\na flourishing town, and the present King (Haakon VII.) was crowned\r\nthere a few years ago.\r\n\r\nNow the real sea voyage to the North Cape commences, and with luck\r\nyou may reach your destination in five days, but on every one of the\r\nfive you will stop somewhere or see something which will be worth\r\nseeing. The town of Namsos is of no great interest, but the coast and\r\nisland scenery now becomes stupendous and grand, with great giant\r\nrocks rising up out of the sea. The most remarkable of these are\r\nTorghatten and Hestmanden.\r\n\r\nThe peculiarity of Torghatten lies in the fact that there is a hole\r\nor tunnel straight through the massive rock, which itself is some\r\n800 feet in height. As you sail past it you see daylight through the\r\nhole, and if you land to examine it you will find that it is nearly\r\n200 yards from end to end, and that its almost perpendicular sides\r\nvary in height from 60 feet at one end to four times that height at\r\nthe other end. No man can account for this remarkable tunnel except\r\nby quoting the local legend, and in this the Hestmand (the other\r\nextraordinary rocky island) is mixed up.\r\n\r\nHestmanden, the "man on horseback," is a wonderful mass of rock,\r\nthe outline of which, allowing for a little imagination, resembles\r\na man on a horse. And this is the legend:\r\n\r\nNot far from Torghatten is an island called Lek\xc3\xb6, on which, in the\r\nage of the giants, there lived a beautiful maiden. In those days\r\nthe Hestmand was a real live giant, and he fell desperately in love\r\nwith the Lek\xc3\xb6 maiden. But the latter, who was only half a giantess,\r\nwas afraid of the great monster, and would have nothing to do with\r\nhim. So the Hestmand flew into a rage, and one day chased the object\r\nof his affections, who fled for her life. The giants did not do things\r\nby halves, and the Hestmand was so angry that he meant to kill the\r\nmaiden, and he shot at her with a giant arrow, which was a fairly\r\nlarge fir-tree. Now, just at the moment that he shot his arrow, the\r\nmaiden\'s brother, who was another giant, realized what was going on,\r\nand flung his hat between his sister and the arrow. The maiden was\r\nsaved, but the arrow pierced the hat. Then the sun suddenly appeared\r\nabove the horizon, and the actors in the tragedy were instantly turned\r\ninto stone. Hestmanden is the wicked giant on his horse; Torghatten\r\nis the hat which was pierced by the arrow; the arrow itself may be\r\nseen, as a great stone pinnacle, on a neighbouring island; while\r\nLek\xc3\xb6moen, the mountain on Lek\xc3\xb6, is the beautiful maiden who caused\r\nall the trouble.\r\n\r\nBut to continue the voyage. Immediately after passing Hestmanden\r\nthe Arctic Circle is crossed, and a few hours later a call is made\r\nat the little town of Bod\xc3\xb6. Thence to the Lof\xc3\xb6dden Islands is no\r\ngreat distance, and after they have been visited and the wonderful\r\ncod drying-grounds inspected, the steamer wends its way to Troms\xc3\xb6,\r\nand then to Hammerfest, which we have already referred to as a great\r\nplace for the manufacture of cod-liver oil. Beyond this the rocky\r\ncoast presents a succession of rugged and wild capes and promontories\r\nuntil the object of the voyage at length comes in sight.\r\n\r\nThe North Cape, the northernmost point of Norway, is a rocky headland\r\non Mager\xc3\xb6 Island--the end of all things, rising a thousand feet above\r\nthe deep blue Arctic sea. The climb up the steep, zigzag pathway\r\nfrom the spot where the steamer lands you is arduous, and you will\r\nbe glad of the rest by King Oscar\'s column. You would have been glad\r\nif a score of other passengers had not been with you, and still more\r\nglad if you had come here half a century earlier, before the hand of\r\nman had marked the spot, and before all your distant friends expected\r\nyou to post them a postcard from the North Cape.\r\n\r\nStill, something of romance remains as, gazing northwards, you\r\nremember that, except, perhaps, for a corner of Spitzbergen, nothing\r\nintervenes between you and the North Pole--only that barrier of ice\r\nwhich, so far, has defied all penetration. But this is mere sentiment,\r\nand you have come to see something else--the merging of sunset with\r\nsunrise. Du Chaillu well describes the scene: "The brilliancy of the\r\nsplendid orb varies in intensity, like that of sunset and sunrise,\r\naccording to the state of moisture of the atmosphere. One day it will\r\nbe of a deep red colour, tingeing everything with a roseate hue,\r\nand producing a drowsy effect. There are times when the changes in\r\nthe colour between the sunset and sunrise might be compared to the\r\nvariations of a charcoal fire, now burning with a fierce red glow,\r\nthen fading away, and rekindling with greater brightness.\r\n\r\n"There are days when the sun has a pale, whitish appearance, and when\r\neven it can be looked at for six or seven hours before midnight. As\r\nthis hour approaches the sun becomes less glaring, gradually changing\r\ninto more brilliant shades as it dips towards the lowest point of its\r\ncourse. Its motion is very slow, and for quite a while it apparently\r\nfollows the line of the horizon, during which there seems to be a\r\npause, as when the sun reaches noon. This is midnight. For a few\r\nminutes the glow of sunset mingles with that of sunrise, and one\r\ncannot tell which prevails; but soon the light becomes slowly and\r\ngradually more brilliant, announcing the birth of another day, and\r\noften before an hour has elapsed the sun becomes so dazzling that\r\none cannot look at it with the natural eye."\r\n\r\nSuch is the wondrous sight, and all through the summer, even before\r\nand after the period of the non-setting of the sun, the nights are\r\nalmost as light as day. Indeed, all over Norway, far to the south\r\nof the Arctic Circle, the summer nights are remarkably short--not\r\naltogether an unmixed blessing to those who find it difficult to\r\nsleep in daylight.\r\n\r\nBut what a change comes over these northern lands in winter! At\r\nthe North Cape the sun sets on November 18, not to rise again until\r\nJanuary 24, and everywhere within the Arctic Circle there is a time\r\nof continuous night. To us, who have no experience of such a state of\r\naffairs, it seems as if life must be bereft of all its pleasures. Yet\r\nthe dwellers in the Arctic regions think nothing of it. To them even\r\nthe dark winter has its charms, for, as has been said of a certain\r\ngentleman, it is not really as black as it has been painted.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, there is the snow, covering everything, and even\r\nat the darkest time of year there is sufficient light, if the sky be\r\nclear, to see to read for an hour before and an hour after midday. Then\r\nthere is the light given by the moon and stars, and lastly the cheering\r\nglow of the aurora borealis,or northern lights. It is not, therefore,\r\nalways dark, though when snow falls or the clouds block out the sky\r\nthe darkness becomes intense. At such times the picture is truly a\r\nmelancholy one.\r\n\r\nTo say that the light given by the aurora borealis does duty for\r\nsunlight is not true. Magnificent spectacle as it presents, this\r\nmarvellous phenomenon produces no light of any real value, and only\r\noccasionally for a few minutes does it illumine the landscape. Tales\r\nof sleighing over the wastes of snow by the light of the aurora\r\nborealis have no foundation in fact, for seldom, if ever, has it\r\nsufficient power to obliterate the stars, and never does the moon\r\npale before it. On the other hand, it is certain that these northern\r\nlights, streaming up into the heavens on every clear night of the long\r\nwinter, must bring feelings of pleasure to the inhabitants of the Polar\r\nregions. The form, the intensity, and the colour of the light is ever\r\nvarying, and thus, in watching it, there is always expectancy. We in\r\nEngland are accustomed to see these lights on autumn nights, but the\r\ndisplay is feeble in comparison with that of the Arctic winter.\r\n\r\nNo one knows for certain what the aurora borealis really is, and\r\neven the most scientific people can tell you no more than that they\r\nsuppose it to be "a phenomenon of electrical origin"!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nLAPLANDERS AT HOME\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough Lapps are occasionally seen in charge of reindeer herds on\r\nsome of the southern mountain tracts of Norway, their real home is\r\nin the Far North, not only of Norway, but also of Sweden, Finland,\r\nand Russia, and the country which they inhabit is known as Lapland.\r\n\r\nThat portion of it which belongs to Norway covers only some 3,000 or\r\n4,000 square miles, while the whole of the Land of the Lapps has an\r\narea of something like 35,000 square miles. But statistics show that\r\nin Norwegian Lapland there are a great many more inhabitants than\r\nthere are in Russian, Finnish, and Swedish Lapland put together;\r\nand the people, whether they be under the rule of Russia, Sweden,\r\nor Norway, are all of the same race--Asiatics and Mongols--totally\r\nunlike Europeans in appearance.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, they are dark, and what we consider ugly, though\r\nit is quite possible that in their eyes we ourselves are hideous. Then\r\nthey are short--a five-foot Lapp would be almost a giant--but what\r\nthey lack in stature they make up in sturdiness; for, although spare\r\nof body, probably no men in the world can do a longer day\'s work,\r\nor survive greater hardships. Dirty they are certainly, since they\r\nnever change their clothes and seldom comb their hair; yet, for all\r\nthat, they are perfectly healthy and happy.\r\n\r\nThey have gradually split up into three groups, known as Mountain\r\nLapps, Sea Lapps, and River Lapps, the first being nomads, or\r\nwanderers, and the other two settlers, by the sea or river, who have\r\nabandoned the original mode of life of their race.\r\n\r\nMountain Lapps are the most restless individuals it is possible to\r\nimagine. Winter and summer they are always on the move, and three days\r\nare seldom passed in one place. Time does not enslave them, for they do\r\nnot trouble about it. Routine is nothing to them: they eat and drink\r\nwhen they feel inclined, and they sleep when a favourable opportunity\r\noccurs. In such matters, as well as in many others, they resemble wild\r\nanimals. But in some respects they are methodical: they work by the\r\nseasons, and in their wanderings take the same lines each year. In\r\nthe summer months they are down by the sea; during the remainder of\r\nthe year they are on the mountains, though at Christmas-time they\r\nusually arrange to encamp somewhere in the vicinity of a church;\r\nfor Christmas is a great event in the lives of the Lapps, since they\r\nprofess Christianity, and if they are able to go to church at no\r\nother time of the year, they make a point of doing so at this season.\r\n\r\nTo-day these people are law-abiding and peaceable, but they are a\r\nstrange mixture of good and bad. They are kind and hospitable, and of\r\na cheerful disposition; at the same time they can be cruel, cunning,\r\nand selfish, while their love of money is no less than their love of\r\ndrink--when they can obtain it.\r\n\r\nFor one thing only does the Mountain Lapp live--his herd of\r\nreindeer. They provide all his wants--food, clothing, and the\r\nwherewithal to purchase luxuries. They are his wealth; his very\r\nexistence depends on them, and, in consequence, his mode of living\r\nhas to be accommodated to the habits of his reindeer. Whither-soever\r\nthey choose to graze, their owner has to follow; and he deems it\r\nno hardship to pitch his rough tent on the snowy wastes in winter,\r\nor even to sleep out under a rock, with the thermometer at seventy\r\ndegrees below zero. It is his life; from earliest childhood he has\r\nknown none other; he is content with it. And it is not only the men who\r\npass their lives thus; for the Lapp family is to some extent a united\r\none, and the women and children thoroughly enjoy the wild, free life,\r\napparently suffering no ill effects from the rigours of the climate.\r\n\r\nA Lapp baby starts life in a very queer way. Until it is able to\r\nwalk it is kept in what is called a _komse_, a kind of cradle made\r\nof strips of wood covered with leather, and just large enough to take\r\nthe baby. The little creature is rolled up in sheepskin and put into\r\nthe cradle, which is then stuffed with moss, and the leather covering\r\nlaced securely all around, so that only the baby\'s face is seen. To\r\nprotect its head the _komse_ is provided with a wooden hood, like most\r\ncradles, and there is generally a shawl, which can be thrown over\r\nthe whole thing in severe weather; in fact, when the baby has been\r\nproperly done up in its _komse_, it might go by parcel post without\r\ncoming to much harm. It is a very excellent arrangement, because the\r\nfamily is incessantly moving about, and the mothers have their work\r\nto do, so cannot always be bothering about their babies. A thong of\r\nleather stretches from head to foot of the _komse_, which the mother\r\ncan thus sling on her shoulder when going about, and by this thong\r\nthe baby can be hung up to a tent-pole or to the branch of a tree if\r\nits mother is busy. But as often as not the _komses_ are just stuck\r\nup on end in the snow or against a rock while work is going on.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the child can walk and has finished its cradle existence, it\r\nis dressed in clothes similar to those of his or her father or mother,\r\nand looks most quaint. And the life which these children lead is devoid\r\nof much amusement. From the beginning they are helping to pack up and\r\nmove the tent, and to look after the reindeer; they are nothing more\r\nthan little old men and women; their toys are miniatures, or models,\r\nof such things as they will have to use later in life--lassoes,\r\nsnowshoes, sleighs--and their games are restricted to learning the use\r\nof the same. They are treated by their parents more or less as if they\r\nwere grown up, and allowed to do much as they please. Consequently,\r\nthey become self-willed, and have little respect for their elders.\r\n\r\nAfter all, the mode of life of the Lapps does not differ very\r\ngreatly from that of our own gipsies, though of the two the Lapps\r\nare certainly the better people. The wandering spirit is inherent\r\nin both, but a portion of each sooner or later shakes it off, and\r\nleads a more settled life. Some there are, however, who will never\r\nbe anything but wanderers, so long as there remains a free country\r\nwherein they are at liberty to roam.\r\n\r\nLet us now see the kind of place which the Mountain Lapp calls\r\n"home." It cannot be anything very elaborate or bulky, as it has to be\r\npacked up and moved about nearly every day, and it has to be carried\r\non the backs of the reindeer in summer, or drawn by them in sleighs\r\nin the winter. So it is nothing more than a most unconventional form\r\nof tent, not altogether unlike the wigwam of the Red Indian, or the\r\ndwelling of many other nomadic people. A few long poles are stuck up\r\non a circle, with their ends fastened together to form a sort of cone,\r\nand over this framework is stretched a covering of coarse woollen\r\nmaterial. At one side there is a loose flap, forming a door, and the\r\nwhole of the top part of the tent round about the ends of the poles\r\nis left open, to admit light and to allow the smoke from the fire to\r\nissue forth. The diameter of the tent is about twelve or fifteen feet,\r\nand the height in the centre eight or ten feet. This is the kitchen,\r\nlarder, store-room, drawing-room, dining-room, and bedroom of the\r\nfamily--men, women, boys, girls, babies, dogs and all.\r\n\r\nA few branches of trees are spread on the ground, and in the middle,\r\nimmediately under the opening in the roof, is the fire, which is\r\nkept alight day and night. Around it the inmates sit on the ground\r\nby day, and sleep by night. There is no furniture of any kind, and\r\nonly a few cooking-pots, with some wooden bowls, and spoons of wood\r\nor of horn. Beds and blankets and suchlike luxuries are also absent,\r\nso undressing, dressing, washing, and absurdities of that kind are\r\nnot indulged in. When the time has come to go to sleep, those who\r\nare in the tent just roll themselves close up to the fire, and sleep\r\nquite comfortably in the clothes which they probably have not taken\r\noff for a year or two. The whole family is not likely to be in the\r\ntent at the same time; some members of it must always be looking\r\nafter the reindeer, as the herd can never be left to its own devices;\r\nconsequently, there is generally plenty of room.\r\n\r\nMeals are free-and-easy affairs; there is no dinner-bell and no\r\nfixed time for eating. But food is always ready, hanging in a pot\r\nover the fire; and when anyone feels inclined to eat, the hand is\r\nplunged into the pot, and a piece of meat pulled out and devoured. In\r\naddition to reindeer-meat--of which the Lapps consume a great deal--the\r\nfood consists of cheese, and sometimes a kind of porridge; while for\r\ndrink they have water, melted snow, reindeer-milk, and, on occasions,\r\ncoffee. The latter they are very fond of, but few families can afford\r\nto drink it often; so also with spirits, which, however, they only\r\nmanage to obtain in the towns.\r\n\r\nThus live the Mountain Lapps year in year out. To-day a family is in\r\none place, to-morrow a dozen miles away; now and again other families\r\nare met with, and received hospitably; but for the most part the\r\nfamily and its herd keep to themselves, since to do otherwise might\r\nlead to difficulties about grazing. The rain floods their tent; the\r\nsnow buries it; the wind blows it down; yet they survive, and glory\r\nin their free life.\r\n\r\nThe Sea Lapps, though much more numerous than their brethren of the\r\nmountains, are not so interesting. They live by the coast in huts built\r\nof wood or of sods, and obtain a livelihood by fishing. The River\r\nLapps, on the other hand, are both herdsmen and fishermen. Residing\r\nin small settlements on the banks of the rivers, they keep reindeer\r\nas well as a few cows and sheep, and they do a little in the way\r\nof farming the land round the settlement. Many of them are even\r\nintellectual, and the advantages of having their children properly\r\neducated in the schools are gradually becoming appreciated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nWINTER IN CHRISTIANIA\r\n\r\n\r\nCold it is, of course--bitterly cold, and always freezing hard; but\r\nit is a dry cold, and you hardly notice it. The streets are all one\r\nsheet of frozen snow, and great care is taken to keep them in good\r\nrepair, gangs of road-menders being always at hand to fill up ruts\r\nby the simple process of picking up the hard snow of the roadway and\r\nthen sprinkling a little water on the top, which at once produces a\r\nsolid surface. No wheeled traffic is now to be seen; everything is on\r\nrunners, from the carriage of the King to the doll\'s perambulator. One\r\nno longer hears the rumble of the _carrioles_ and _stolkj\xc3\xa6rres_ over\r\nthe rough flags, and the silence is broken only by the jingling of\r\nthe sleigh-bells.\r\n\r\nIt is a strange sight indeed, this winter city, with its fur-clad\r\nmen and women, and snow-covered houses and gardens, its keen, crisp\r\nair and pale blue sky. What a change from the fogs and dampness of\r\nour English climate!\r\n\r\nChristiania is gay at this time of year, for it is the "season." The\r\nmembers of the Storthing, with their wives and families, are in town\r\nfor the session, and all sorts of gaieties are in progress. But all\r\nthose Norwegians who have leisure to enjoy themselves turn their\r\nattentions to the real pleasures of winter--sleighing, ski-ing,\r\ntobogganing, and skating. The boys and girls are thoroughly\r\nhappy. Directly school is over away they go, with their skates,\r\nsnowshoes, or toboggans, to have a right good time in their different\r\nplaygrounds. The hill on which the palace stands is given up to these\r\nlittle revellers, and in the evenings dozens of them of all ages may\r\nbe seen descending the slopes face downwards on their _kj\xc3\xa6lker_, or\r\nracing through the trees with their long ski on their feet. The public\r\ngardens also are flooded to form a rink for the sole use of the infant\r\nskaters, and, judging by their rosy cheeks, the outdoor exercise in\r\nthe cold, dry air makes them as healthy as any children in the world.\r\n\r\nBut grown-up people consider skating feeble sport in comparison with\r\nski-ing, which may be called the national sport of Norway. Not so\r\nmany years ago it was restricted to that country; but now the sport\r\nhas become a favourite one in Sweden, Switzerland, and in other\r\nparts of Europe where the snow lies deep. Yet, to see perfection\r\nin the art, one must go to Norway--the real home of the great long\r\nwooden snowshoe. From earliest youth the Norwegians of both sexes\r\nare accustomed to go about the country in the long winter months on\r\nthese strange contrivances, for without them it would be absolutely\r\nimpossible to move off the roads. Children are taught in the schools to\r\nuse them; soldiers wear them at winter drill and manoeuvres; farmers,\r\nmilkmaids, cowboys, all may be seen daily in the country parts going\r\nfrom place to place on them, and so keen are the young rustic lads\r\non becoming proficient ski-runners that all over Norway are to be\r\nfound ski clubs, formed for the purpose of encouraging snowshoeing\r\nas a pastime, and for sending competitors to the great annual meeting\r\nat Christiania.\r\n\r\nThese snowshoe competitions are most interesting and exciting; and the\r\npluck, endurance, and daring which they bring out are remarkable. They\r\ntake place on the hills just outside Christiania, and are attended by\r\nevery man, woman, and child who can reach the spot. On the first day is\r\nheld the long-distance race, and on the second the jumping competition,\r\nonly winners in the former being allowed to enter for the latter.\r\n\r\nEvery English boy knows what it is to take part in a cross-country\r\nrun of half a dozen miles. The Norwegian test is something more\r\nformidable--about fifteen miles of rough, mountainous country,\r\nover hill and dale, through forests, and as often as not down rocky\r\nprecipices, all half buried in snow; in the runner\'s hand a staff, and\r\non his feet his ski, six or eight feet long. The course is carefully\r\nmarked out beforehand by tying pieces of coloured rag to branches and\r\nrocks, and it is a point-to-point race throughout. Every district sends\r\nits champion, and there are frequently as many as eighty competitors,\r\nwho are started one after another at intervals of a minute. Except,\r\nhowever, for expert ski-runners who can follow the course, it is not\r\nan interesting race to watch, as one only sees the start or the finish,\r\nto learn subsequently who covered the distance in the shortest time.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the men as they come in is sufficient proof of\r\nthe terrific nature of the test. So bathed in perspiration are they\r\nthat they might have been running a "Marathon" race in the height\r\nof summer; and so parched are their tongues that they can scarcely\r\nspeak. Lucky the skier who, during his run, chances on an unfrozen\r\nforest pool whereat he may quench his thirst by deep draughts of what\r\nthe Norwegian terms "goosewine"--our "Adam\'s ale."\r\n\r\nBut the second day\'s sport is of a different kind; the whole thing\r\nis visible to the spectators, who from first to last are subjected\r\nto thrills of wild excitement. The ground selected for the contest\r\nis the side of a somewhat steep hill, and the snow must be in proper\r\ncondition--deep, and not having a hard-frozen crust. The competitors\r\nassemble on the summit, and at the bottom of the slope--perhaps a\r\nhundred yards from the starting-point--is a large enclosed space,\r\naround which stand the spectators. Half-way down the hillside, a\r\nhorizontal platform, well covered with hard snow, has been built out,\r\nso as to form the "taking-off" point for the long jump; and close\r\nby it is the box for the judges and committee. The soldiers on ski,\r\nkeeping the ground, give the signal that all is ready; in another\r\nsecond a bugle-call resounds from the top of the hill; and the first\r\nman has started.\r\n\r\nDown the slope he comes at the top of his speed, his fists clenched,\r\nand determination in his face. Gathering himself together as he nears\r\nthe "take-off," he bends slightly on his ski, and, with a frantic\r\nbound, flies forward into space. For an instant a breathless silence\r\nfalls on the crowd, and then, as the _ski-l\xc3\xb6ber_ lands at the bottom,\r\nand struggles in vain to keep his feet, cheers mingled with laughter\r\nfill the air. Number 2 is no more successful than his predecessor; but\r\nNumber 3 lands on both feet with much grace, continues his way on level\r\nground, and, wheeling round, receives the well-merited applause of the\r\nonlookers. Others follow in quick succession, some making brilliant\r\nleaps, some having awkward spills; yet one and all racing down to the\r\nplatform with almost abandoned recklessness. What with the delay caused\r\nby accidents, and the time taken in measuring the successful jumps,\r\nthe contest occupies some hours. Then the judges declare the names of\r\nthe prize-winners, together with the length of each man\'s leap; and,\r\nprodigious as it may seem, it is no unusual thing for the champion\r\nto accomplish 100 feet, measured on the slope from the "take-off"\r\nto the landing-point.\r\n\r\nSuch are some of the winter sports of Norway. Can anyone wonder\r\nthat the men who enter into them with so great a zest have earned\r\nfor themselves the name of "Hardy Norsemen"? Can anyone wonder that\r\nDr. Nansen, in his younger days the champion _ski-l\xc3\xb6ber_ at one of\r\nthese great meetings, should have defeated all others in the race\r\nfor the North Pole?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n[1] Pronounced Nor-gay.\r\n\r\n[2] Frontispiece.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Peeps at Many Lands: Norway, by \r\nA.F.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
