And that was not the worst of it, either. At the foot\r\nof the long hill leading into the village the mighty leviathan so\r\nunceremoniously borrowed had come to a halt, refusing to move another\r\ninch, and Stephen now sat helplessly in it, awaiting the aid his\r\ncomrades had promised to send back from the town.\r\n\r\nWhat an ignominious climax to what had promised to be a royal holiday!\r\nSteve scowled with chagrin and disappointment.\r\n\r\nThe catastrophe served him right. Unquestionably he should not have\r\ntaken the car without asking. He had never run it all by himself before,\r\nalthough many times he had driven it when either his father or Havens\r\nhad been at his elbow. It had gone all right then. What reason had he to\r\nsuppose a mishap would befall him when they were not by? It was\r\ninfernally hard luck!\r\n\r\nGoodness only knew what was the matter with the thing. Probably\r\nsomething was smashed, something that might require days or even weeks\r\nto repair, and would cost a lot of money. Here was a pretty dilemma!\r\n\r\nHow angry his father would be!\r\n\r\nThe family were going to use the automobile Saturday to take Doris back\r\nto Northampton for the opening of college and had planned to make quite\r\na holiday of the trip. Now it would all have to be given up and\r\neverybody would blame him for the disappointment. A wretched hole he was\r\nin!\r\n\r\nThe boys had not given him much sympathy, either. They had been ready\r\nenough to egg him on into wrong-doing and had made of the adventure the\r\njolliest lark imaginable; but the moment fun had been transformed into\r\ncalamity they had deserted him with incredible speed, climbing out of\r\nthe spacious tonneau and trooping jauntily off on foot to see the town.\r\nIt was easy enough for them to wash their hands of the affair and leave\r\nhim to the solitude of the roadside; the automobile was not theirs and\r\nwhen they got home they would not be confronted by irate parents.\r\n\r\nHow persuasively, reflected Stephen, they had urged him on.\r\n\r\n"Oh, be a sport, Steve!" Jack Curtis had coaxed. "Who\'s going to be the\r\nwiser if you do take the car? Anyhow, you have run it before, haven\'t\r\nyou? I don\'t believe your father will mind."\r\n\r\n"Take a chance, Stevie," his chum, Bud Taylor, pleaded. "What\'s the good\r\nof being such a boob? Do you think if my father had a car and it was\r\nstanding idle in the garage when a bunch of kids needed it to go to a\r\nschool game I would hesitate? You bet I wouldn\'t!"\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t likely your Dad would balk at your using the car if he knew\r\nthe circumstances," piped another boy. "We have got that match to play\r\noff, and now that the electric cars are held up by the strike how are we\r\nto get to Torrington? Don\'t be a ninny, Steve."\r\n\r\nThus they had ridiculed, cajoled, and wheedled Steve until his\r\nconscience had been overpowered and, yielding to their arguments, he had\r\nset forth for the adjoining village with the triumphant throng of\r\ntempters. At first all had gone well. The fourteen miles had slipped\r\npast with such smoothness and rapidity that Stephen, proudly enthroned\r\nat the wheel, had almost forgotten that any shadow rested on the\r\nhilarity of the day. He had been dubbed a good fellow, a true sport, a\r\nbenefactor to the school--every complimentary pseudonym imaginable--and\r\nhad glowed with pleasure beneath the avalanche of flattery. As the big\r\ncar with its rollicking occupants had spun along the highway, many a\r\npasser-by had caught the merry mood of the cheering group and waved a\r\nsmiling salutation in response to their shouts.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, exhilarated by the novelty of the escapade, Steve had\r\nincreased the speed until the red car fairly shot over the level\r\nmacadam, its blurred outlines lost in the scarlet of the autumn foliage.\r\nThen suddenly when the last half-mile was reached and Torrington\r\nvillage, the goal of the pilgrimage, was in sight, quite without warning\r\nthe panting monster had stopped and all attempts to urge it farther were\r\nof no avail. There it stood, its motionless engine sending out odors of\r\nhot varnish and little shimmering waves of heat.\r\n\r\nImmediately a hush had descended upon the boisterous company. There was\r\na momentary pause, followed by a clamor of advice. When, however, it\r\nbecame evident that there was no prospect of restoring the disabled\r\nmachine to action, one after another of the frightened schoolboys had\r\ndropped out over the sides of the car and after loitering an instant or\r\ntwo with a sort of shamefaced indecision, at the suggestion of Bud\r\nTaylor they had all set out for the town.\r\n\r\n"Tough luck, old chap!" Bud had called over his shoulder. "Mighty tough\r\nluck! Wish we had time to wait and see what\'s queered the thing; but the\r\ngame is called at two-thirty, you know, and we have only about time to\r\nmake it. We\'ll try and hunt up a garage and send somebody back to help\r\nyou. So long!"\r\n\r\nAnd away they had trooped without so much as a backward glance, leaving\r\nStephen alone on the country road, worried, mortified, and resentful.\r\nThere was no excuse for their heartless conduct, he fumed indignantly.\r\nThey were not all on the eleven. Five of the team had come over in Tim\r\nBarclay\'s Ford, so that several of the fellows Steve had brought were\r\nmerely to be spectators of the game. At least Bud Taylor, his especial\r\ncrony, was not playing. He might have remained behind. How selfish\r\npeople were, and what a fleeting thing was popularity! Why, half an hour\r\nago he had been the idol of the crowd! Then Bud had shouted: "Come\r\nahead, kids, let\'s hoof it to Torrington!" and in the twinkling of an\r\neye the tide had turned, the mob had shifted its allegiance and gone\r\ntagging off at the heels of a new leader. They did not mean to have\r\ntheir pleasure spoiled, not they!\r\n\r\nScornfully Stephen watched them mount the hill, their crimson sweaters\r\nmaking a zigzag line of color in the sunshine; even their laughter,\r\ncare-free as if nothing had happened, floated back to him on the still\r\nair, demonstrating how little concern they felt for him and his\r\nrefractory automobile. Well might they proceed light-heartedly to the\r\nvillage, spend their money on sodas and ice-cream cones, and shout\r\nthemselves hoarse at the game. No thought of future punishment marred\r\ntheir enjoyment and the program was precisely the one he had outlined\r\nfor himself before Fate had intervened and raised a prohibitory hand.\r\n\r\nThe fun he had missed was, however, of scant consequence now. All he\r\nasked was to get the car safely back to his father\'s garage before the\r\nfamily returned from New York on the afternoon train. Now that his\r\nexcitement had cooled into sober second thought, he marveled that he had\r\nbeen led into committing such a monstrous offense. He must have been\r\nmad. Often he had begged to do the very thing he had done and his father\r\nhad always refused to let him, insisting that an expensive touring car\r\nwas no toy for a boy of his age. Perhaps there had been some truth in\r\nthe assertion, too, he now admitted. Yet were he to hang for it, he\r\ncould not see why he had not run the car exactly as his elders were wont\r\nto do. Of course he had had a pretty big crowd aboard and the heavy load\r\nmight have strained the machinery; and possibly--just possibly--he had\r\nspeeded a bit. He certainly had made phenomenally good time for he did\r\nnot want the fellows to think he was afraid to let out the engine.\r\n\r\nWell, whatever the matter was, the harm was done now and he was in a\r\nmost unenviable plight. No doubt it would cost a small fortune to get\r\nthe automobile into shape again, more money than he had in the world;\r\ncertainly far more than he had in his pocket at the present moment. What\r\nwas he to do? Even suppose the boys did remember to send back help\r\n(they probably wouldn\'t--but suppose they did) how was he to pay a\r\nmachinist? As he pictured himself being towed to a garage and the car\r\nbeing left there, he felt an uncomfortable sensation in his throat. He\r\ncertainly was in for it now.\r\n\r\nIt would be ignominious to charge the repairs to his father but that\r\nwould be the only course left him. Fortunately Mr. Tolman, who was a\r\nrailroad official, was well known in the locality and therefore there\r\nwould be no trouble about obtaining credit; but to ask his father to pay\r\nthe bills for this escapade was anything but a manly and honorable way\r\nout and Steve wished with all his heart he had never been persuaded into\r\nthe wretched affair. If there were only some escape possible, some\r\nalternative from being obliged to confess his wrong-doing! But to hope\r\nto conceal or make good the disaster was futile. And even if he could\r\ncover up what had happened, how contemptible it would be! He detested\r\ndoing anything underhanded. Only sneaks and cowards resorted to\r\nsubterfuge and although he had been called many names in his life these\r\ntwo had not been among them.\r\n\r\nNo, he should make a clean breast of what he had done and bear the\r\nconsequences, and once out of his miserable plight he would take care\r\nnever again to be a party to such an adventure. He had learned his\r\nlesson.\r\n\r\nSo absorbed was he in framing these worthy resolutions that he did not\r\nnotice a tiny moving speck that appeared above the crest of the hill and\r\nnow came whirling toward him. In fact the dusty truck and its yet more\r\ndusty driver were beside him before he heeded either one. Then the\r\nnewcomer came to a stop and he heard a pleasant voice:\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter, sonny?"\r\n\r\nStephen glanced up, trying bravely to return his questioner\'s smile.\r\n\r\nThe man who addressed him was white-haired, ruddy, and muscular, and he\r\nwore brown denim overalls stained with oil and grease; but although he\r\nwas middle-aged there was a boyish friendliness in his face and in the\r\nfrank blue eyes that peered out from under his shaggy brows.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the trouble with your machine?" he repeated.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," returned Stephen. "If I did, you bet I wouldn\'t be\r\nsitting here."\r\n\r\nThe workman laughed.\r\n\r\n"Suppose you let me have a look at it," said he, climbing off the seat\r\non which he was perched.\r\n\r\n"I wish you would."\r\n\r\n"It is a pretty fine car, isn\'t it?" observed the man, as he approached\r\nit. "Is it yours?"\r\n\r\n"My father\'s."\r\n\r\n"He lets you use it, eh?"\r\n\r\nStephen did not answer.\r\n\r\n"Some fathers ain\'t that generous," went on the man as he began to\r\nexamine the silent monster. "If I had an outfit like this, I ain\'t so\r\nsure I\'d trust it to a chap of your size. Still, if you have your\r\nlicense, I suppose you must know how to run it."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "You\'ve got your engine nicely warmed up, youngster," he\r\nobserved casually. Page 9.]\r\n\r\nA shiver passed through Stephen\'s body. A license! What if the stranger\r\nshould ask to see it?\r\n\r\nThere was a heavy fine, he now remembered, for driving a car unless one\r\nwere in possession of this precious paper, although what the penalty was\r\nhe could not at the instant recall; he had entirely forgotten there were\r\nany such legal details. Fearfully he eyed the mechanic.\r\n\r\nThe man, however, did not pursue the subject but instead appeared\r\nengrossed in carefully inspecting the automobile inside and out. As he\r\npoked about, now here, now there, Stephen watched him with constantly\r\nincreasing nervousness; and after the investigation had proceeded for\r\nsome little time and no satisfactory result had been reached, the boy\'s\r\nheart sank. Something very serious must be the matter if the trouble\r\nwere so hard to locate, he reasoned. In imagination he heard his\r\nfather\'s indignant reprimands and saw the Northampton trip shrivel into\r\nnothingness.\r\n\r\nThe workman in the meantime remained silent, offering no comment to\r\nrelieve his anxiety. What he was thinking under the shabby visor cap\r\npulled so low over his brows it was impossible to fathom. His hand was\r\nnow unscrewing the top of the gasoline tank.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got your engine nicely warmed up, youngster," observed he\r\ncasually. "Maybe \'twas just as well you did come to a stop. You must\r\nhave covered the ground at a pretty good clip."\r\n\r\nThere certainly was something very disconcerting about the stranger\'s\r\nconversation and again Stephen looked at him with suspicion.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know," he mumbled, trying to assume an off-hand air.\r\n"Perhaps we did come along fairly fast."\r\n\r\n"You weren\'t alone then."\r\n\r\n"N--o," was the uncomfortable reply. "The fellows who sent you back from\r\nthe village were with me."\r\n\r\nFor the first time the workman evinced surprise.\r\n\r\n"Nobody sent me," he retorted. "I just thought as I was going by that\r\nyou looked as if you were up against it, and as I happen to know\r\nsomething about engines I pulled up to give you a helping hand. The fix\r\nyou are in isn\'t serious, though." He smiled broadly as if something\r\namused him.\r\n\r\n"What is the matter with the car?" demanded the boy desperately, in a\r\nvoice that trembled with eagerness and anxiety and defied all efforts to\r\nremain under his control.\r\n\r\n"Why, son, nothing is wrong with your car. You\'ve got no gasoline,\r\nthat\'s all."\r\n\r\n"Gasoline!" repeated the lad blankly.\r\n\r\n"Sure! You couldn\'t have had much aboard when you started, I guess. It\r\nmanaged to bring you as far as this, however, and here you came to a\r\nstop. The up-grade of the hill tipped the little gas you did have back\r\nin the tank so it would not run out, you see. Fill her up again and\r\nshe\'ll sprint along as nicely as ever."\r\n\r\nThe relief that came with the information almost bowled Steve over.\r\n\r\nFor a moment he could not speak; then when he had caught his breath he\r\nexclaimed excitedly:\r\n\r\n"How can I get some gasoline?"\r\n\r\nHis rescuer laughed at the fevered question.\r\n\r\n"Why, I happen to have a can of it here on my truck," he drawled, "and I\r\ncan let you have part of it if you are so minded."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t want to take yours," objected the boy.\r\n\r\n"Nonsense! Why not? I am going right past a garage on my way back and\r\ncan get plenty more. We\'ll tip enough of mine into your tank to carry\r\nyou home. It won\'t take a minute."\r\n\r\nThe suggestion was like water to the thirsty.\r\n\r\n"All right!" cried Stephen. "If you will let me pay for it I shall be\r\nmightily obliged to you. I\'m mightily obliged anyway."\r\n\r\n"Pshaw! I\'ve done nothing," protested the person in the oily jumper.\r\n"What are we in the world for if not to do one another a good turn when\r\nwe can?"\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he extricated from his conglomerate load of lumber, tools,\r\nand boxes a battered can, the contents of which he began to transfer\r\ninto Stephen\'s empty tank.\r\n\r\n"There!" ejaculated he presently, as he screwed the metal top on. "That\r\nisn\'t all she\'ll hold, but it will at least get you home. You are going\r\nright back, aren\'t you?"\r\n\r\nThe boy glanced quickly at the speaker.\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right. I would if I were in your place," urged the man.\r\n\r\nFurtively Stephen scrutinized the countenance opposite but although the\r\nwords had contained a mingled caution and rebuke there was not the\r\nslightest trace of interest in the face of the speaker, who was\r\nimperturbably wiping off the moist nickel cap with a handful of waste\r\nfrom his pocket.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he repeated half-absently, "I take it that amount of gas will\r\njust about carry you back to Coventry; it won\'t allow for any detours,\r\nto be sure, but if you follow the straight road it ought to fetch you up\r\nthere all right."\r\n\r\nStephen started and again an interrogation rose to his lips. Who was\r\nthis mysterious mechanic and why should he assume with such certainty\r\nthat Coventry was the abiding place of the car? He longed to ask but a\r\nfear of lengthening the interview prevented him from doing so. If he\r\nbegan to ask questions might not the stranger assume the same privilege\r\nand wheel upon him with some embarrassing inquiry? No, the sooner he was\r\nclear of this wizard in the brown overalls the better. But for the sake\r\nof his peace of mind he should like to know whether the man really knew\r\nwho he was or whether his comments were simply matters of chance. There\r\ncertainly was something very uncanny and uncomfortable about it all,\r\nsomething that led him to feel that the person in the jumper was fully\r\nacquainted with his escapade, disapproved of it, and meant to prevent\r\nhim from prolonging it. Yet as he took a peep into the kindly blue eyes\r\nwhich he did not trust himself to meet directly he wondered if this\r\nassumption were not created by a guilty conscience rather than by fact.\r\nCertainly there was nothing accusatory in the other\'s bearing. His face\r\nwas frankness itself. In books criminals were always fearing that people\r\nsuspected them, reflected Steve. The man knew nothing about him at all.\r\nIt was absurd to think he did.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the boy was eager to be gone from the presence of those\r\nsearching blue eyes and therefore he climbed into his car, murmuring\r\nhurriedly:\r\n\r\n"You\'ve been corking to help me out!"\r\n\r\nThe workman held up a protesting hand.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t think of it again," he answered. "I was glad to do it. Good luck\r\nto you!"\r\n\r\nWith nervous hands Stephen started the engine and, backing the\r\nautomobile about, headed it homeward. Now that danger was past his\r\ndesire to reach Coventry before his father should arrive drove every\r\nother thought from his mind, and soon the mysterious hero of the brown\r\njumper was forgotten. Although he made wonderfully good time back over\r\nthe road it seemed hours before he turned in at his own gate and brought\r\nthe throbbing motor to rest in the garage. A sigh of thankfulness\r\nwelled up within him. The great red leviathan that had caused him such\r\nanguish of spirit stood there in the stillness as peacefully as if it\r\nhad never stirred from the spot it occupied. If only it had remained\r\nthere, how glad the boy would have been.\r\n\r\nHe ventured to look toward the windows fronting the avenue. No one was\r\nin sight, it was true; but to flatter himself that he had been\r\nunobserved was ridiculous for he saw by the clock that his father,\r\nmother, and Doris must already have reached home. Doubtless they were in\r\nthe house now and fully acquainted with what he had done. If they had\r\nnot missed the car from the garage they would at least have seen it\r\nwhirl into the driveway with him at the wheel. Any moment his father\r\nmight appear at his shoulder. To delay was useless. He had had his fun\r\nand now in manly fashion he must face the music and pay for it. How he\r\ndreaded the coming storm!\r\n\r\nOnce, twice he braced himself, then moved reluctantly toward the house,\r\nclimbed the steps, and let himself in at the front door. He could hardly\r\nexpect any one would come to greet him under the circumstances. An\r\nominous silence pervaded the great dim hall but after the glare of the\r\nwhite ribbon of road on which his eyes had been so intently fixed he\r\nfound the darkness cool and tranquilizing. At first he could scarcely\r\nsee; then as he gradually became accustomed to the faint light he espied\r\non the silver card tray a telegram addressed to himself and with a\r\nquiver of apprehension tore it open. Telegrams were not such a common\r\noccurrence in his life that he had ceased to regard them with misgiving.\r\n\r\nThe message on which his gaze rested, however, contained no ill tidings.\r\nOn the contrary it merely announced that the family had been detained in\r\nNew York longer than they had expected and would not return until noon\r\nto-morrow. He would have almost another day, therefore, before he would\r\nbe forced to make confession to his father! The respite was a welcome\r\none and with it his tenseness relaxed. He even gained courage on the\r\nstrength of his steadier nerves to creep into the kitchen and confront\r\nMary, the cook, whom he knew must have seen him shoot into the driveway\r\nand who, having been years in the home, would not hesitate to lecture\r\nhim roundly for his conduct. But Mary was not there and neither was\r\nJulia, the waitress. In the absence of the head of the house the two had\r\nevidently ascended to the third story there to forget in sleep the cares\r\nof daily life. Stephen smiled at the discovery. It was a coincidence.\r\nUnquestionably Fate was with him. It helped his self-respect to feel\r\nthat at least the servants were in ignorance of what he had done. Nobody\r\nknew--nobody at all!\r\n\r\nWith an interval of rest and a dash of cold water upon his face\r\ngradually the act he had committed began to sink back into normal\r\nperspective and loom less gigantic in his memory. After all was it such\r\na dreadful thing, he asked himself. Of course he should not have done it\r\nand he fully intended to confess his fault and accept the blame. But was\r\nthe folly so terrible? He owned that he regretted it and admitted that\r\nhe was somewhat troubled over the probable consequences, and every time\r\nhe awoke in the night a dread of the morrow came upon him. In the\r\nmorning he rushed off to school, found the team had won the game, and\r\ncame home feeling even more justified than before. Why, if he had not\r\ntaken the car, the school might have forfeited that victory!\r\n\r\nAll the afternoon as he sat quietly at his books he tried to keep this\r\nconsideration uppermost in his mind. Then at dinner time there was a\r\nstir in the hall and he knew the moment he feared had arrived. The\r\nfamily were back again! Slowly he stole down over the heavily carpeted\r\nstairs. Yes, there they were, just coming in at the door, laughing and\r\nchatting gaily with Julia, who had let them in. The next instant his\r\nmother had espied him on the landing and had called a greeting.\r\n\r\nThere was a smile on her face that reproached him for having yielded to\r\nthe temptation to deceive her even for a second.\r\n\r\n"Such a delightful trip as we have had, Steve!" she called. "We wished a\r\ndozen times that you were with us. But some vacation you shall have a\r\nholiday in New York with your father to pay for what you have missed\r\nthis time. You shall not be cheated out of all the fun, dear boy!"\r\n\r\n"Everything been all right here, son?" inquired his father from the foot\r\nof the stairs.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Dad."\r\n\r\n"Havens has not showed up yet, I suppose."\r\n\r\nThe boy flushed.\r\n\r\n"No, sir."\r\n\r\n"It seems to take him an interminable time to have his tonsils out. If\r\nhe does not appear pretty soon I shall have to get another man to run\r\nthe car. We can\'t be left high and dry like this," fretted the elder man\r\nirritably. "Suppose I knew nothing about it, where would we be? I wished\r\nto-day you were old enough to have a license and could have come to the\r\nstation to meet us. I believe with a little more instruction you could\r\nmanage that automobile all right. Not that I should let you go racing\r\nover the country with a lot of boys. But you might be very useful in\r\ntaking your mother and sister about and helping when we were in a fix\r\nlike this. I think you would enjoy doing it, too."\r\n\r\n"I--I\'m--sure I should," replied the lad, avoiding his father\'s eye and\r\nstudying the toe of his shoe intently. It passed through his mind as he\r\nstood there that now was the moment for confession. He had only to say,\r\n\r\n"_I had the car out yesterday_," and the dreaded ordeal would be over.\r\nBut somehow he could not utter the words. Instead he descended from the\r\nlanding and followed the others into the library where the conversation\r\nimmediately shifted to other topics. In the jumble of narrative his\r\nchance to speak was swallowed up nor during the next few days did any\r\nsuitable opportunity occur for him to make his belated confession. When\r\nMr. Tolman was not at meetings of the railroad board he was at his\r\noffice or occupied with important affairs, and by and by so many events\r\nhad intervened that to go back into the past seemed to Stephen idle\r\nsentimentality. At length he had lulled his conscience into deciding\r\nthat in view of the conditions it was quite unnecessary to acquaint his\r\nfather and mother with his wrong-doing at all. He was safely out of the\r\nentanglement and was it not just as well to accept his escape with\r\ngratitude and let sleeping dogs lie? All the punishments in the world\r\ncould not change anything now. What would be the use of telling?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nA MEETING WITH AN OLD FRIEND\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day of the excursion to Northampton was one of those clear mornings\r\nwhen a light frost turned the maples to vermilion and in a single night\r\ntransformed the ripening summer foliage to the splendor of autumn. The\r\nTolman family were in the highest spirits; it was not often that Mr.\r\nTolman could be persuaded to leave his business and steal away for a\r\nweek-end and when he did it was always a cause for great rejoicing.\r\nDoris, elated at the prospect of rejoining her college friends, was also\r\nin the happiest frame of mind and tripped up and down stairs, collecting\r\nher forgotten possessions and jamming them into her already bulging\r\nsuitcase.\r\n\r\nAs for Steve, the prickings of conscience that had at first tormented\r\nhim and made him shrink from being left alone with his father had quite\r\nvanished. He had argued himself into a state of mental tranquility\r\nwhere further punishment for his misdemeanor seemed superfluous. After\r\nhis hairbreadth escape from disaster there was no danger, he argued, of\r\nhis repeating the experiment, and was not this the very lesson all\r\npunishments sought to instill? If he had achieved this result without\r\nbothering his father about the details, why so much the better. Did not\r\nthe old adage say that "experience is the best teacher"? Certainly in\r\nthis case the maxim held true.\r\n\r\nHaving thus excused his under-handedness and stifled the protests of his\r\nbetter nature he felt, or tried to feel, entirely at peace with the\r\nworld; and as he now sauntered out to greet the new day he did it as\r\njauntily as if he had nothing to conceal. Already the car was at the\r\ndoor with the luggage aboard and its engine humming invitingly. As the\r\nboy listened to the sound he could not but rejoice that the purring\r\nmonster could tell no tales. How disconcerting it would be should the\r\nscarlet devil suddenly shout aloud: "Well, Steve, don\'t you hope we do\r\nnot get stalled to-day the way we did going to Torrington?" Mercifully\r\nthere was no danger of that. The engine might puff and purr and snort\r\nbut at least it could not talk, and his secret was quite safe. This\r\nreflection lighted his face with courage and when the family came out to\r\njoin him no one would have suspected that the slender boy waiting on the\r\ndoorstep harbored a thought of anything but anticipation in the prospect\r\nof the coming holiday.\r\n\r\n"Is everything in, Steve?" asked his father, approaching with Doris\'s\r\nremaining grip.\r\n\r\n"I think so, Dad," was the reply. "It certainly seems as if I had piled\r\nin almost a dozen suitcases."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, Stevie," pouted Doris. "There were only four."\r\n\r\n"Five, Miss Sophomore!" contradicted her brother. "Five! That one Dad is\r\nbringing makes the fifth, and I would be willing to bet that it is\r\nyours."\r\n\r\n"That\'s where you are wrong, Smartie," the girl laughed good-humoredly,\r\nmaking a mischievous grimace at him from beneath the brim of her saucy\r\nlittle toque of blue velvet. "I am not guilty of the extra suitcase.\r\nIt\'s mother\'s."\r\n\r\n"Your mother\'s!" ejaculated Mr. Tolman incredulously. "Mercy on us! I\r\nnever knew your mother to be starting out on a short trip with such an\r\narray of gowns." Then turning toward his wife, he added in bantering\r\nfashion: "Aren\'t you getting a little frivolous, my dear? If it were\r\nDoris now--"\r\n\r\n"But it isn\'t this time!" interrupted the young lady triumphantly.\r\n\r\nHer mother exchanged a glance with her and they both laughed.\r\n\r\n"No, Henry, I am the one to blame," Mrs. Tolman admitted. "You see, if I\r\nam to keep pace with my big son and daughter I must look my best; so I\r\nhave not only brought the extra suitcase but I am going to be\r\ntremendously fussy as to where it is put."\r\n\r\n"I do believe Mater\'s brought all her jewels with her!" Steve declared\r\nwickedly. "Well, she shall have her sunbursts, tiaras, and things where\r\nshe can keep her eye on them every moment. Suppose I put them down here\r\nat your feet, Mother."\r\n\r\nWithout further ado, he started to lift the basket suitcase into the\r\ncar.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t tip it up, son. Don\'t tip it up!" cautioned his mother.\r\n\r\n"Your mother is afraid of knocking some of the pearls or emeralds out of\r\ntheir setting," chuckled Mr. Tolman. "Go easy, Steve!"\r\n\r\nA general laugh arose as the offending piece of baggage was stowed away\r\nout of sight. An instant later wraps and rugs were bundled in, everybody\r\nwas cosily tucked up, and Mr. Tolman placed his hands on the wheel.\r\n\r\n"Now we\'re off, Dad!" cried Stephen, as he sprang in beside his father.\r\nMr. Tolman needed no second bidding.\r\n\r\nThere was a whir, a leap forward, and the automobile glided down the\r\nlong avenue and out into the highway.\r\n\r\nSteve, studying the road map, was too much interested in tracing out the\r\nroute they were to follow to notice that after the car had spun along\r\nsmoothly for several miles its speed lessened, and it was not until it\r\ncame to a complete standstill that he aroused himself from his\r\npreoccupation sufficiently to see that his father was bending forward\r\nover the starter.\r\n\r\n"What\'s wrong, Henry?" inquired his wife from the back seat.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t imagine," was the impatient reply. "Had I not left the tank\r\nwith gasoline in it, I should say it was empty; but of course that\r\ncannot be the case, for I always keep enough in it to carry us to the\r\ngarage. Otherwise we should be stalled at our own doorstep and not able\r\nto get anywhere."\r\n\r\nClimbing out, he began to unscrew the metal top of the tank while\r\nStephen watched him in consternation.\r\n\r\nThe boy did not need to hear the result of the investigation for already\r\nthe wretched truth flashed upon him. The tank was empty; of course it\r\nwas! He knew that without being told. Had not the workman who had\r\nreplenished it Wednesday said quite plainly that there was only enough\r\ngas in it to get him home to Coventry? He should have remembered to stop\r\nat the garage and take on an extra supply on the way back as his father\r\nalways did. How stupid he had been! In his haste to get home he had\r\nforgotten every other consideration and the present dilemma was the\r\nresult of his thoughtlessness. Yet how could he have stopped at the\r\nCoventry garage even had he thought of it? All the men there knew him\r\nand his father, and if he had gone there or had even driven through the\r\ncenter of the town somebody would have been sure to see him and mention\r\nthe incident. Why, it was to avoid this very danger that he had returned\r\nby the less frequented way.\r\n\r\nThe man in the brown jeans had certainly calculated to a nicety when he\r\nmeasured out that gasoline. He had not meant him to do any more riding\r\nthat day; that was apparent. What business was it of his, anyway, and\r\nwhy was he so solicitous as to where he went? There was something\r\npuzzling about that man. Steve had thought so at the time. Not that it\r\nmattered now. All that did matter was that here they were stalled at the\r\nside of the road in almost the same spot where he had been stalled the\r\nother day; and they were there because he had neglected to procure\r\ngasoline.\r\n\r\nThe lad felt the hot blood throb in his cheeks. Again the chance for\r\nconfession confronted him and again his tongue was tied. In a word he\r\ncould have explained the whole predicament; but he did not. Instead he\r\nsat as if stunned, the heart inside him pounding violently. He saw that\r\nhis father was not only deeply annoyed but baffled to solve the\r\nincident.\r\n\r\n"The gas is all out; that\'s the trouble!" he announced.\r\n\r\n"What are we going to do, Dad?" inquired Doris anxiously.\r\n\r\n"Oh, we can get more all right, daughter," returned her father\r\nreassuringly. "Don\'t worry, my dear. But what I can\'t understand is how\r\nwe come to be in such a plight."\r\n\r\n"Doesn\'t gasoline evaporate, Henry?" suggested Mrs. Tolman.\r\n\r\n"To some extent, yes; but there could be no such shrinkage as this\r\nunless there was a leak in the tank. I never dreamed the supply was so\r\nlow. Well, it is my own fault. I should have made sure everything was\r\nright before we started."\r\n\r\nSteve shifted his position uncomfortably. He was manly enough not to\r\nenjoy hearing his father shoulder blame that did not rightfully belong\r\nto him.\r\n\r\n"Now let me think what we had better do," went on Mr. Tolman.\r\n"Unfortunately there isn\'t a house in sight from which we can telephone\r\nfor help; and we are fully five miles from Torrington. Our only hope is\r\nthat some one bound for the town may overtake us and allow Steve to ride\r\nto the village for aid."\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t I walk it, Dad?" asked the boy, with an impulse to make good\r\nthe mischief he had done.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no; I wouldn\'t do that unless the worst befalls," his father\r\nreplied kindly. "We should gain nothing. It is a long tramp and would\r\nsimply be a waste of time. Let us wait like Mr. Micawber, and see if\r\nsomething does not turn up."\r\n\r\nWretchedly Stephen settled back into his seat. He would rather have\r\nwalked to Torrington, done almost anything rather than remain there in\r\nthe quiet autumn stillness and listen to the accusations of his\r\nconscience. What a coward he was!\r\n\r\n"It is a shame for us to be tied up here!" he heard Doris complain.\r\n\r\n"I know it, daughter, and I am as sorry as you are," responded her\r\nfather patiently. "In fact, probably, I am more sorry, since it is\r\nthrough my own carelessness that we are stranded."\r\n\r\nAgain the impulse to blurt out the truth and take the blame that\r\nbelonged to him took possession of Stephen; but with resolution he\r\nforced it back. Nervously he fingered the road map. If he had only\r\nspoken at the beginning! It was harder now. He should have made a clean\r\nbreast of the whole affair when his father got home from New York. Then\r\nwas the time to have done it. But since he had let that opportunity pass\r\nit was awkward, almost absurd, to make confession now. He would much\r\nbetter keep still.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile a gradual depression fell upon the occupants of the\r\ncar. Mrs. Tolman did not speak; Doris subsided into hushed annoyance;\r\nand Mr. Tolman began to pace back and forth at the side of the road and\r\nanxiously scan the stretch of macadam that narrowed away between the\r\navenue of trees bordering the highway. Presently he uttered an\r\nexclamation of relief.\r\n\r\n"Here comes a truck!" he cried. "We will tip the driver and persuade him\r\nto let you ride on to Torrington with him, Steve. This is great luck!"\r\n\r\nStepping into the pathway of the approaching car he held up his hand and\r\nthe passer-by came to a stop beside him.\r\n\r\nStephen looked up expectantly; then a thrill of foreboding seized him\r\nand he quickly turned his head aside. It needed no second glance to\r\nassure him that the man whom his father was addressing was none other\r\nthan the workman in the brown jeans who had rescued him from his former\r\nplight. He bent lower over the road map, trying to conceal his face and\r\ndecide what to do. In another moment the teamster would probably\r\nrecognize him, recall the incident of their former meeting, and hailing\r\nhim as an old acquaintance, relate the entire story. The possibility was\r\nappalling, but terrible as it was it did not equal the disquietude he\r\nexperienced when he heard his father ejaculate with sudden surprise:\r\n\r\n"Why, if it isn\'t O\'Malley! I did not recognize you, Jake. You are just\r\nin time to extricate us from a most inconvenient situation. We are\r\nheaded for Northampton and find ourselves without gasoline. If you can\r\ntake my son along to Torrington with you so he can hunt up a garage and\r\nride back with some one on a service car I shall be very grateful to\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n"I\'d be glad to go myself, sir."\r\n\r\n"No, no! I shall not allow you to do that," protested Mr. Tolman. "You\r\nare on your way to work and I could not think of detaining you. All I\r\nask is that you take my boy along to the village."\r\n\r\n"I\'d really be pleased to go, sir," reiterated O\'Malley. "I am in no\r\ngreat rush."\r\n\r\n"No, I shan\'t hear to it, Jake," Mr. Tolman repeated. "Nevertheless I\r\nappreciate your offer. Take the boy along and that is all I\'ll ask.\r\nCome, Steve, jump aboard! O\'Malley, son, is one of our railroad people,\r\nwhose services we value highly. He is going to be good enough to let you\r\nride over to Torrington with him."\r\n\r\nAlthough the introduction compelled Stephen to give the waiting employee\r\na nod of greeting, he did not meet his eye or evince any sign of\r\nrecognition, and he sensed that the light that had flashed into the\r\nman\'s face at sight of him died out as quickly as it had come. The boy\r\nhad an uncomfortable realization as he climbed to the seat of the truck\r\nand took his place beside its driver that O\'Malley must be rating him as\r\na snob. No one but a cad would accept a stranger\'s kindness and then cut\r\nhim dead the next time he encountered him. It was better to endure this\r\nmisjudgment, however, than to acknowledge a previous acquaintance with\r\nthe mechanic and thereby arouse his father\'s suspicion and curiosity.\r\nHence, without further parley, he settled himself and in silence the\r\ntruck started off.\r\n\r\nFor some minutes he waited, expecting that when they were well out of\r\nearshot of the family the man at the wheel would turn and with a laugh\r\nmake some reference to the adventure of the past week. It certainly must\r\nhave amused him to find the great red car again stalled in the same\r\nspot, and what would be more natural than that he should comment on the\r\ncoincidence and perhaps make a joke of the circumstance? But to the\r\nboy\'s chagrin the teamster did no such thing. Instead he kept his eyes\r\nfixed on the road and gave no evidence that he had ever before seen the\r\nlad at his elbow.\r\n\r\nStephen was aghast. It was not possible the workman had forgotten the\r\nhappening. He began to feel very uncomfortable. As the landscape slipped\r\npast and the car sped on, the distance to Torrington lessened. Still\r\nthere seemed to be no prospect of the stranger at the wheel breaking his\r\nsilence. If it had merely been a silence perhaps Steve would not have\r\nminded so much; but there was an implied rebuke in the stillness that\r\nnettled and stung and left him with a consciousness of being ignored by\r\na superior being.\r\n\r\n"I say!" he burst out, when he could endure the ignominy of his position\r\nno longer, "don\'t you remember me, Mr. O\'Malley?"\r\n\r\nThe man who guided the car did not turn his head but he nodded.\r\n\r\n"I remember you all right," replied he politely. "I just thought you did\r\nnot remember me."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I remembered you right away," declared Steve eagerly.\r\n\r\n"Did you?"\r\n\r\nThere was a subtle irony in the tone that the lad was not clever enough\r\nto detect.\r\n\r\n"Of course."\r\n\r\n"Is that so!" came dryly from O\'Malley.\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed! I remembered you right away," Steve stumbled on. "You are\r\nthe man who gave me the gasoline when I was stuck here Wednesday."\r\n\r\n"I am."\r\n\r\n"I knew you the first minute I saw you," repeated Stephen.\r\n\r\n"I did not notice any sign that you did," was the terse response.\r\n\r\n"Oh--well--you see, I couldn\'t very well speak back there," explained\r\nSteve with confusion. "They would all have wanted to know where I--I\r\nmean I would have to--it would just have made a lot of talk," concluded\r\nhe lamely.\r\n\r\nFor the first time the elder man, moving his eyes from the ribbon of\r\ngleaming highway, confronted him.\r\n\r\n"So your father did not know you had the car out the other day?" said\r\nhe.\r\n\r\n"N--o."\r\n\r\nThe workman showed no surprise.\r\n\r\n"I guessed as much," he remarked. "But of course you have told him\r\nsince."\r\n\r\n"Not yet," Steve stammered. "I was going to--honest I was; but things\r\nkept interrupting until it got to be so late that it seemed silly to\r\nrake the matter all up. Besides, I shan\'t do it again, so what is the\r\nuse of jawing about it?"\r\n\r\nHe stopped, awaiting a response from the railroad employee; but none\r\ncame.\r\n\r\n"Anyhow," he argued with rising irritability, "what good does it do to\r\ndiscuss things that are over and done with? You can\'t undo them."\r\n\r\nThe man at the wheel vouchsafed no answer.\r\n\r\n"It is because I forgot to stop for more gas when I went home the other\r\nday that we are in this fix now," Steve finally blurted out, finding\r\nrelief in brutal confession.\r\n\r\nStill the only reply to his monologue was the chugging of the engine.\r\n\r\nAt last his voice rose to a higher pitch and there was anger in it.\r\n\r\n"I\'m talking to you," he shouted in exasperation.\r\n\r\n"I am listening."\r\n\r\n"Well, why don\'t you say something?"\r\n\r\n"What is there to say?"\r\n\r\n"Why--eh--you could tell me what you think."\r\n\r\n"I guess you know that already."\r\n\r\nStephen\'s face turned scarlet.\r\n\r\n"I did intend to tell my father," repeated he, instantly on the\r\ndefensive. "Straight goods, I did."\r\n\r\nThe man shrugged his shoulders.\r\n\r\n"It was only that it didn\'t seem to come right. You know how things go\r\nsometimes."\r\n\r\nHe saw the workman\'s lip curl.\r\n\r\n"You think I ought to have told."\r\n\r\n"Have I said so?"\r\n\r\n"No, but I know you do think so."\r\n\r\n"I wasn\'t aware I\'d expressed any opinion."\r\n\r\n"No--but--well--hang it all--you think I am a coward for not making a\r\nclean breast of the whole thing!" cried Stephen, now thoroughly enraged.\r\n\r\n"What do you think yourself?" O\'Malley suddenly inquired with\r\ndisconcerting directness.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know I\'ve been rotten," admitted the boy. "Still, even now--" He\r\npaused.\r\n\r\n"You mean that even now it isn\'t too late?" put in the truckman, his\r\nface lighting to a smile.\r\n\r\n"N--o; that wasn\'t exactly what I was going to say," began the lad,\r\nresuming his argumentative tone. "What I mean is that--"\r\n\r\nA swift frown replaced the elder man\'s smile.\r\n\r\n"Here we are at the garage," he broke in. "They will do whatever you\r\nwant them to."\r\n\r\nHe seemed in a hurry and as Stephen could find no excuse for lingering\r\nhe climbed reluctantly out of the truck and stood balancing himself on\r\nthe curb that edged the sidewalk.\r\n\r\n"I\'m much obliged to you for bringing me over," he observed awkwardly.\r\n\r\n"That\'s all right."\r\n\r\nThe man in the brown jeans started his engine.\r\n\r\n"Say, Mr. O\'Malley!" called Stephen desperately.\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"You--you--won\'t tell my father about my taking the car, will you?" he\r\npleaded wretchedly.\r\n\r\n"_I_ tell him?"\r\n\r\nNever had he heard so much scorn compressed into three words.\r\n\r\n"You need have no worries," declared the man over his shoulder, a\r\ncontemptuous sneer curling his lips. "I confess my own wrong-doing but I\r\ndo not tattle the sins of other people. Your father will never be the\r\nwiser about you so far as I am concerned. Whatever you want him to know\r\nyou will have to tell him yourself."\r\n\r\nBaffled, mortified, and stinging with humiliation as if he had been\r\nwhipped, Stephen watched him disappear round the bend of the road.\r\n\r\nO\'Malley despised him, that he knew; and he did not at all relish being\r\ndespised.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nA SECOND CALAMITY\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile hunting up the garage and negotiating for gasoline Steve thrust\r\nresolutely from his mind his encounter with O\'Malley and the galling\r\nsense of inferiority it carried with it; but once on the highroad again\r\nthe smart returned and the sting lingering behind the man\'s scorn was\r\nnot to be allayed. It required every excuse his wounded dignity could\r\nmuster to bolster up his pride and make out for himself the plausible\r\ncase that had previously comforted him and lulled his conscience to\r\nrest. It was now more impossible than ever for him to make any\r\nconfession, he decided; for having denied in his father\'s presence\r\nO\'Malley\'s acquaintance it would be ridiculous to acknowledge that he\r\nhad known the truck driver all along. Of course he could not do that.\r\nWhatever he might have said or done at the time, it was entirely too\r\nlate to go back on his conduct now. One event had followed on the heels\r\nof another until to slip out a single stone of the structure he had\r\nbuilt up would topple over the whole house.\r\n\r\nIf he had spoken in the beginning that would have been quite simple. All\r\nhe could do now was to let bygones be bygones and in the pleasure of\r\nto-day forget the mistakes of yesterday. Consoled by this reflection he\r\nmanaged to recapture such a degree of his self-esteem that by the time\r\nhe rejoined the family he was once more holding his head in the air and\r\nsmiling with his wonted lightness of heart.\r\n\r\n"We shall get you to Northampton now, daughter, without more delay, I\r\nhope," Mrs. Tolman affirmed when the car was again skimming along. "We\r\nmay be a bit behind schedule; nevertheless a late arrival by motor will\r\nbe pleasanter than to have made the trip by train."\r\n\r\n"I should say so!" was the fervent ejaculation.\r\n\r\n"Come, come!" interrupted Mr. Tolman. "I shall not sit back and allow\r\nyou two people to cry down the railroads. They are not perfect, I will\r\nadmit, and unquestionably trains do not always go at the hours we wish\r\nthey did; a touring car is, perhaps, a more comfortable and luxurious\r\nmethod of travel, especially in summer. But just as it is an improvement\r\nover the train, so the train was a mighty advance over the stagecoach of\r\nolden days."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know, Dad," Stephen mused. "I am not so sure that I should\r\nnot have liked stagecoaches better. Think what jolly sport it must have\r\nbeen to drive all over the country!"\r\n\r\n"In fine weather, yes--that is, if the roads had been as excellent as\r\nthey are now; but you must remember that in the old coaching days\r\nroad-building had not reached its present perfection. Traveling by\r\nstage over a rough highway in a conveyance that had few springs was not\r\nso comfortable an undertaking as it is sometimes pictured. Furthermore\r\nyou must not forget that it was also perilous, for not only was there\r\ndanger from accident on these poorly constructed, unlighted\r\nthoroughfares but there was in addition the menace from highwaymen in\r\nthe less populated districts. It took a great while to make a journey of\r\nany length, too, and to sleep in a coach where one was cramped, jolted,\r\nand either none too warm or miserably hot was not an unalloyed delight,\r\nas I am sure you will agree."\r\n\r\n"I had not thought of any of those things," owned Stephen. "It just\r\nseemed on the face of it as if it must have been fun to ride on top of\r\nthe coach and see the sights as one does from the Fifth Avenue or London\r\nbuses."\r\n\r\n"Oh," laughed his father, "a few hours\' adventure like that is quite a\r\ndifferent affair from making a stagecoach journey. I grant that to ride\r\non a clear morning through the streets of a great city, or bowl along\r\nthe velvet roads of a picturesque countryside as one frequently does in\r\nEngland is very delightful. To read Dickens\' descriptions of journeys up\r\nto London is to long to don a greatcoat, wind a muffler about one\'s\r\nneck, and amid the cracking of whips and tooting of horns dash off\r\nbehind the horses for the fairy city his pen portrays. Who would not\r\nhave liked, for example, to set out with Mr. Pickwick for the Christmas\r\nholidays at Dingley Dell? Why, you cannot even read about it without\r\nseeing in your mind\'s eye the envious throng that crowded the inn yard\r\nand watched while the stableboys loosed the heads of the leaders and the\r\nsteeds galloped away! And those marvelous country taverns he depicts,\r\nwith their roaring fires, their steaming roasts, their big platters of\r\nfowl deluged in gravy, and their hot puddings! Was there ever writer\r\nmore tantalizing?"\r\n\r\n"You will have us all hungry in two minutes, Dad, if you keep on,"\r\nexclaimed Stephen.\r\n\r\n"And Dickens has us hungry, too," declared Mr. Tolman. "Nevertheless we\r\nmust not forget that he paints but one side of the picture. He fails to\r\nemphasize what such a trip meant when the weather was cold and stormy,\r\nand those outside the coach as well as those inside it were often\r\ndrenched with rain or snow, and well-nigh frozen to death. Moreover,\r\nwhile it is true that many of the inns along the turnpike were clean and\r\nfurnished excellent fare, there were others that could boast nothing\r\nbetter than chilly rooms, damp beds, and only a very limited\r\nhospitality."\r\n\r\n"I believe you are a realist, Henry," said his wife playfully.\r\n\r\nHer husband laughed.\r\n\r\n"Nor must we lose sight of the time consumed by making a trip by coach,"\r\nhe went on. "Business in those days was not such a rushing matter as it\r\nis now, of course; yet even when issues of importance were at stake, or\r\ncrises of life and death were to be met, there was no hurrying things\r\nbeyond a certain point. Physical impossibility prohibited it. Horses\r\ndriven at their liveliest pace could cover only a comparatively small\r\nnumber of miles an hour; and at the points where the relays were\r\nchanged, or the horses fed and rested; the mails deposited or taken\r\naboard; and passengers left or picked up, there were unavoidable delays.\r\nIn fact, the strongest argument against the stagecoach, and the one that\r\ninfluenced public opinion the most, was this so-called fast-mail\r\nservice; for in order to make connections with other mail coaches along\r\nthe route and not forfeit the money paid for doing so, horses were often\r\ndriven at such a merciless rate of speed that the poor creatures became\r\ntotal wrecks within a very short time. Many a horse fell in its tracks\r\nin the inn yards, having been lashed along to make the necessary ten\r\nmiles an hour and reach a specified town on schedule. Other horses were\r\nmaimed for life. It is tragic to consider that in England before the\r\nadvent of the railroad about thirty thousand horses were annually either\r\nkilled outright or injured so badly that they were of little use\r\nafterward."\r\n\r\n"Great Scott, Dad!" ejaculated Stephen.\r\n\r\n"And England was no more guilty in this respect than was America, for in\r\nthe early days of our own country when people were demanding quicker\r\ntransportation and swifter mail service thousands of noble beasts\r\noffered up their last breath in making the required rate of speed."\r\n\r\n"I suppose nobody thought about the horses," murmured the boy. "I am\r\nsure I didn\'t."\r\n\r\n"If the public thought at all it was too selfish to care, I am afraid,\r\nuntil threatened by the possibility of the total extermination of these\r\ncreatures," was his father\'s reply. "This danger, blended with a humane\r\nimpulse which rose from the gentler-minded portion of the populace, was\r\nthe decisive factor in urging men to seek out some other method of\r\ntravel. Then, too, the world was waking up commercially and it was\r\nbecoming imperative to find better ways for transporting the ever\r\nincreasing supplies of merchandise. The quick moving of troops from one\r\npoint to another was also an issue. Although the canals of England\r\nenabled the government to carry quite a large body of men, the method\r\nwas a slow one. In 1806, for instance, it took exactly a week to shift\r\ntroops from Liverpool to London, a distance of thirty-four miles."\r\n\r\n"Why, they could have marched it in less time than that, couldn\'t they?"\r\nquestioned Doris derisively.\r\n\r\n"Yes, the journey might easily have been made on foot in two days,"\r\nnodded her father. "But in war time a long march which exhausts the\r\nsoldiers is frequently an unwise policy, for the men are in no condition\r\nwhen they arrive to go into immediate action, as re\xc3\xabnforcements often\r\nmust."\r\n\r\n"I see," answered Doris.\r\n\r\n"When the Liverpool and Manchester Railroad was opened in 1830 this\r\nthirty-four miles was covered in two hours," continued Mr. Tolman. "Of\r\ncourse the quick transportation of troops was then, as now, of very\r\nvital importance. We have had plenty of illustrations of that in our\r\nrecent war against Germany. Frequently the fate of a battle has hung on\r\nlarge re\xc3\xabnforcements being speedily dispatched to a weak point in the\r\nline. Moreover, by means of the railroads, vast quantities of food,\r\nammunition and supplies of all sorts can constantly be sent forward to\r\nthe men in action. During the late war our American engineers laid miles\r\nand miles of track under fire, thereby keeping open the route to the\r\nfront so that there was no danger of the fighters being cut off and left\r\nunequipped. It was a service for which they, as well as our nation, won\r\nthe highest praise. And not only was there a constant flow of supplies\r\nbut it was by means of these railroads that hospital trains were enabled\r\nto carry to dressing stations far behind the lines thousands of wounded\r\nmen whose lives might otherwise have been lost."\r\n\r\n"I suppose the slightly wounded could be made more comfortable in this\r\nway, too," Mrs. Tolman suggested.\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed," was the reply. "Not only were the men better cared for in\r\nthe roomier hospitals behind the lines, but as there was more space\r\nthere the peril from contagion, always a menace when large numbers of\r\nsick are packed closely together, was greatly lessened; for there is\r\nnothing army doctors dread so much as an epidemic of disease when there\r\nis not enough room to isolate the patients."\r\n\r\n"When did England adopt railroads in place of stagecoaches, Dad?" asked\r\nDoris presently.\r\n\r\nAt the question her father laughed.\r\n\r\n"See here!" he protested good-humoredly, "what do you think I am? Just\r\nbecause I happen to be a superintendent do you think me a volume of\r\nrailroad history, young woman? The topic, I confess, is a fascinating\r\none; but I am off for a vacation to-day."\r\n\r\n"Oh, tell us, Dad, do!" urged the girl.\r\n\r\n"Nonsense! What is the use of spoiling a fine morning like this talking\r\nbusiness?" objected her father.\r\n\r\n"But it is not business to us," interrupted Mrs. Tolman. "It is simple a\r\nstory--a sort of fairy tale."\r\n\r\n"It is not unlike a fairy tale, that\'s a fact," reflected her husband\r\ngravely. "Imagine yourself back, then, in 1700, before steam power was\r\nin use in England. Now you must not suppose that steam had never been\r\nheard of, for an ancient Alexandrian record dated 120 B. C. describes a\r\nsteam turbine, steam fountain, and steam boiler; nevertheless, Hero, the\r\nhistorian who tells us of them, leaves us in doubt as to whether these\r\nwonders were actually worked out, or if they were, whether they were\r\nanything but miniature models. Still the fact that they are mentioned\r\ngoes to prove that there were persons in the world who at a very early\r\ndate vaguely realized the possibilities of steam as a force, whether\r\nturned to practical uses or not. For years the subject remained an\r\nalluring one which led many a scientist into experiments without number.\r\nIn various parts of the world men played with the idea and wrote about\r\nit; but no one actually produced any practical steam contrivance until\r\n1650, when the second Marquis of Worcester constructed a steam fountain\r\nthat could force the water from the moat around his castle as high as\r\nthe top of one of the towers. The feat was looked upon as a marvel and\r\nafterward a larger fountain, similar in principle, was constructed at\r\nVauxhall and from that time on the future of steam as a motive power was\r\nassured."\r\n\r\n"Did the Marquis of Worcester go on with his experiments and make other\r\nthings?" demanded Stephen.\r\n\r\n"Apparently not," replied his father. "He did, nevertheless, furnish a\r\nbasis for others to work on. Scientists were encouraged to investigate\r\nwith redoubled zeal this strange vapor which, when controlled and\r\ndirected, could carry water to the top of a castle tower. When in 1698\r\nSavery turned Worcester\'s crude steam fountain to draining mines and\r\ncarrying a water supply, every vestige of doubt that this mighty power\r\ncould be applied to practical uses vanished."\r\n\r\n"Did the steam engine come soon afterward?" queried Doris, who had\r\nbecome interested in the story.\r\n\r\n"No, not immediately," answered Mr. Tolman, pausing to shift the gear of\r\nthe car. "Before the steam engine, as we know it, saw the light, there\r\nhad to be more experimenting and improving of the steam fountain. It was\r\nnot until 1705 that Thomas Newcomen and his partner, John Calley,\r\ninvented and patented the first real steam engine. Of course it was not\r\nin the least like the engines we use now. Still, it was a steam device\r\nwith moving parts which would pump water, a tremendous advance over the\r\nmechanisms of the past where all the power had been secured by the\r\nalternate filling and emptying of a vacuum, or vacant receptacle,\r\nattached to the pump. Now, with Newcomen\'s engine a complete revolution\r\ntook place. The engine with moving parts, the ancestor of our modern\r\nexquisitely constructed machinery, speedily crowded out the primitive\r\nsteam fountain idea. The new device was very imperfect, there can be no\r\nquestion about that; but just as the steam fountain furnished the\r\ninspiration for the engine with moving parts, so this forward step\r\nbecame the working hypothesis for the engines that followed."\r\n\r\n"What engines did follow?" Doris persisted, "and who did invent our\r\nsteam engine?"\r\n\r\n"Silly! And you in college," jeered Steve disdainfully.\r\n\r\n"I am not taking a course in steam engines there," laughed his sister\r\nteasingly. "Anyway, girls are not expected to know who invented all the\r\nmachines in the world, are they, Dad?"\r\n\r\nMr. Tolman waited a moment, then said soothingly:\r\n\r\n"No, dear. Girls are not usually so much interested in scientific\r\nsubjects as boys are--although why they should not be I never could\r\nquite understand. Nevertheless, I think it might be as well for even a\r\ngirl to know to whom we are indebted for such a significant invention as\r\nthe steam engine.\r\n\r\n"It was James Watt," Stephen asserted triumphantly.\r\n\r\n"It certainly was," his father agreed. "And since your brother has his\r\ninformation at his tongue\'s end, suppose we get him to tell us more\r\nabout this remarkable person."\r\n\r\nStephen flushed.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid," began he lamely, "that I don\'t know much more. You see, I\r\nstudied about him quite a long time ago and I don\'t remember the\r\ndetails. I should have to look it up. I do recall the name, though--"\r\n\r\nHis father looked amused.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know which of you children is the more blameworthy," remarked\r\nhe in a bantering tone. "Doris, who never heard of Watt; or Stephen, who\r\nhas forgotten all about him."\r\n\r\nBoth the boy and the girl chuckled good-humoredly.\r\n\r\n"At least I knew his name, Dad--give me credit for that," piped Steve.\r\n\r\n"That was something, certainly," Mrs. Tolman declared, joining in the\r\nlaugh.\r\n\r\n"Well, since neither of us can furnish the story, I don\'t see but that\r\nyou will have to do it, Dad," Doris said mischievously.\r\n\r\n"It would be a terrible humiliation if I should discover that I could\r\nnot do it, wouldn\'t it?" replied Mr. Tolman with a smile. "In point of\r\nfact, there actually is not a great deal more that it is essential for\r\none to know. It was by perfecting the engines of the Newcomen type and\r\nadding to them first one and then another valuable device that Watt\r\nfinally built up the forerunner of our present-day engine. The\r\nprogression was a gradual one. Now he would better one part, then some\r\nother. He surrounded the cylinder, for example, with a jacket, or\r\nchamber, which contained steam at the same pressure as that within the\r\nboiler, thereby keeping it as hot as the steam that entered it--a very\r\nimportant improvement over the old idea; then he worked out a plan by\r\nwhich the steam could be admitted at each end of the cylinder instead of\r\nat one end, as was the case with former engines. The latter innovation\r\nresulted in the push and pull of the piston rod. So it went."\r\n\r\n"How did Watt come to know so much about engines?" asked Stephen.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Watt was an engineer by trade--or rather he was a maker of\r\nmathematical instruments for the University of Glasgow, where he came\r\ninto touch with a Newcomen engine. He also made surveys of rivers,\r\nharbors, and canals. So you see it was quite a consistent thing that a\r\nman with such a bent of mind should take up the pastime of experimenting\r\nwith a toy like the steam engine in his leisure hours."\r\n\r\n"Did he go so far as to patent it, Henry?" Mrs. Tolman questioned.\r\n\r\n"Yes, he did. Many of our scientists either had not the wit to do this,\r\nalas, or else they were too impractical to appreciate the value of their\r\nideas. In consequence the glory and financial benefit of what they did\r\nwas often filched from them. But Watt was a Scotchman and canny enough\r\nto realize to some extent what his invention was worth. He therefore\r\nobtained a patent on it which was good for twenty-five years; and when,\r\nin 1800, this right expired he retired from business with both fame and\r\nfortune."\r\n\r\n"It is nice to hear of one inventor who got something out of his toil,"\r\nMrs. Tolman observed.\r\n\r\n"Indeed it is. Think of the many men who have slaved day and night,\r\nforfeited health, friends, and money to give to the world an idea, and\r\nnever lived to receive either gratitude or financial reward, dying\r\nunknown or entirely forgotten. There is something tragic about the\r\ninjustice of it. But Watt, I am glad to say, lived long enough to\r\nwitness the service he had done mankind and enjoy an honored place among\r\nthe great of the world."\r\n\r\n"Is the kind of engine Watt invented now in use?" Doris inquired.\r\n\r\n"Yes, that is a double-acting or reciprocating engine of a more perfect\r\ntype," her father returned. "Mechanics and engineers went on improving\r\nWatt\'s engine just as he had improved those that had preceded it. It is\r\ninteresting, too, to notice that after thousands of years scientists\r\nhave again worked around to the steam turbine described so long ago in\r\nthe Alexandrian records. This engine, although it does away with many of\r\nthe moving parts introduced by Newcomen, preserves the essential\r\nprinciples of that early engine combined with Watt\'s later improvements.\r\nTo-day we have a number of different kinds of engines, their variety\r\ndiffering with the purpose to which they are applied. Their cost,\r\nweight, and the space they require have been reduced and their power\r\nincreased, and in addition we have made it possible to run them not only\r\nby means of coal or wood but by gasoline, oil, or electricity. We have\r\nsmall, light-weight engines for navigation use; mighty engines to propel\r\nour great warships and ocean liners; stationary engines for mills and\r\npower plants; to say nothing of the wonderful locomotive engines that\r\ncan draw the heaviest trains over the highest of mountains. The\r\nprinciple of all these engines is, however, the same and for the brain\r\nbehind them we must thank James Watt."\r\n\r\n"Was it Watt who invented the locomotive, too?" ventured Doris. Her\r\nfather shook his head.\r\n\r\n"The perfecting of the locomotive, my dear, is, as Kipling says, another\r\nstory."\r\n\r\n"Tell it to us."\r\n\r\n"Not now, daughter," protested Mr. Tolman. "I am far too hungry; and\r\nmore than that I am eager to enjoy this beautiful country and forget\r\nrailroads and locomotives."\r\n\r\n"Did you say you were hungry, Henry?" asked Mrs. Tolman.\r\n\r\n"I am--starved!" her husband said apologetically. "Isn\'t it absurd to be\r\nhungry so early in the day?"\r\n\r\n"It is nearly noon, Dad!" said Steve, glancing down at the clock in the\r\nfront of the car.\r\n\r\n"Noon! Why, I thought it was still the middle of the morning."\r\n\r\n"No, indeed! While you have been talking we have come many a mile, and\r\nthe time has slipped past," his wife said. "If all goes well--" The shot\r\nfrom a bursting tire rent the air.\r\n\r\n"Which evidently it does not," interrupted Mr. Tolman grimly, bringing\r\nthe car to a stop. "How aggravating! We were almost into Palmer, where I\r\nhad planned for us to lunch. Now it may be some little time before we\r\ncan get anything to eat."\r\n\r\n"Motorist\'s luck! Motorist\'s luck, my dear!" cried Mrs. Tolman gaily.\r\n"An automobilist must resign himself to taking cheerfully what comes."\r\n\r\n"That is all very well," grumbled her husband, as he clambered out of\r\nthe car. "Nevertheless you must admit that this mishap on the heels of\r\nthe other one is annoying."\r\n\r\nStephen also got out and the two bent to examine the punctured tire.\r\n\r\n"I should not mind so much if I were not so hungry," murmured Mr.\r\nTolman. "How are you, Steve? Fainting away?"\r\n\r\nThe boy laughed.\r\n\r\n"Well, I could eat something if I had it," he confessed.\r\n\r\n"I wish I hadn\'t mentioned food," went on Mr. Tolman humorously. "It was\r\nan unfortunate suggestion."\r\n\r\n"I\'m hungry, too," piped Doris.\r\n\r\n"There, you see the epidemic you have started, Henry," called Mrs.\r\nTolman accusingly. "Here is Doris vowing she is in the last throes of\r\nstarvation."\r\n\r\nNobody noticed that in the meanwhile the mother had reached down and\r\nlifted into her lap the small suitcase hidden in the bottom of the car.\r\nShe opened the cover and began to remove its contents.\r\n\r\nAt length, when a remark her husband made to her went unheeded, he\r\nsensed her preoccupation and came around to the side of the car where\r\nshe was sitting. Immediately he gave a cry of surprise.\r\n\r\n"My word!" he exclaimed. "Steve, come here and see what your mother\r\nhas."\r\n\r\nStephen looked.\r\n\r\nThere sat Mrs. Tolman, unpacking with quiet enjoyment sandwiches, eggs,\r\ncake, cookies, and olives.\r\n\r\nA shout of pleasure rose from the famished travelers.\r\n\r\n"So it was not your jewels, after all, Mater!" cried Stephen.\r\n\r\n"No, and after the way you have slandered me and my little suitcase,\r\nnone of you deserve a thing to eat," his mother replied. "However, I am\r\ngoing to be magnanimous if only to shame you. Now climb in and we will\r\nhave our lunch. You can fix the tire afterward."\r\n\r\nThe men were only too willing to obey.\r\n\r\nAs with brightened faces they took their seats in the car, Stephen\r\nsmiled with affection at his mother.\r\n\r\n"Well, Mater, Watt was not the only person who lived to see himself\r\nappreciated; and I don\'t believe people were any more grateful to him\r\nfor his steam engine than we are to you right now for this luncheon. You\r\nare the best mother I ever had."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF THE FIRST RAILROAD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe new tire went on with unexpected ease and early afternoon saw the\r\nTolmans once more bowling along the highway toward Northampton. The\r\nvalley of the Connecticut was decked with harvest products as for an\r\nautumnal pageant. Stacks of corn dotted the fields and pyramids of\r\ngolden pumpkins and scarlet apples made gay the verandas of the old\r\nhomesteads or brightened the doorways of the great red barns flanking\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n"All that is needed to transform the scene into a giant Hallowe\'en\r\nfestival is to have a witch whisk by on a broomstick, or a ghost bob up\r\nfrom behind a tombstone," declared Mrs. Tolman. "Just think! If we had\r\ncome by train we would have missed all this beauty."\r\n\r\n"I see plainly that you do not appreciate the railroads, my dear,"\r\nreturned her husband mischievously. "This is the second time to-day that\r\nyou have slandered them. You sound like the early American traveler who\r\nasserted that it was ridiculous to build railroads which did very\r\nuncomfortably in two days what could be done delightfully by coach in\r\neight or ten."\r\n\r\n"Why, I should have thought people who had never heard of motor-cars\r\nwould have welcomed the quicker transportation the railroads offered,"\r\nwas Mrs. Tolman\'s reply.\r\n\r\n"One would have thought so," answered Mr. Tolman. "Still, when we recall\r\nhow primitive the first railroads were, the prejudice against them is\r\nnot to be wondered at."\r\n\r\n"How did they differ from those we have now, Dad?" Doris asked.\r\n\r\n"In almost every way," answered her father, with a smile. "You see at\r\nthe time Stephenson invented his steam locomotive nothing was known of\r\nthis novel method of travel. As I told you, persons were accustomed to\r\nmake journeys either by coach or canal. Then the steam engine was\r\ninvented and immediately the notion that this power might be applied to\r\ntransportation took possession of the minds of people in different parts\r\nof England. As a result, first one and then another made a crude\r\nlocomotive and tried it out without scruple on the public highway, where\r\nit not only frightened horses but terrified the passers-by. Many an\r\namusing story is told of the adventures of these amateur locomotives. A\r\nmachinist named Murdock, who was one of James Watt\'s assistants, built a\r\nsort of grasshopper engine with very long piston rods and with legs at\r\nthe back to help push it along; with this odd contrivance he ventured\r\nout into the road one night just at twilight. Unfortunately, however,\r\nhis restless toy started off before he was ready to have it, and\r\nturning down an unfrequented lane encountered a timid clergyman who was\r\ntaking a peaceful stroll and frightened the old gentleman almost out of\r\nhis wits. The poor man had never seen a locomotive before and when the\r\nsteaming object with its glowing furnace and its host of moving arms and\r\nlegs came puffing toward him through the dusk he was overwhelmed with\r\nterror and screamed loudly for help."\r\n\r\nA laugh arose from the listeners.\r\n\r\n"And that is but one of the many droll experiences of the first\r\nlocomotive makers," continued Mr. Tolman. "For example Trevithick,\r\nanother pioneer in the field, also built a small steam locomotive which\r\nhe took out on the road for a trial trip. It chanced that during the\r\nexperimental journey he and his fireman came to a tollgate and puffing\r\nup to the keeper with the baby steam engine, they asked what the fee\r\nwould be for it to pass. Now the gate keeper, like the minister, had had\r\nno acquaintance with locomotives, and on seeing the panting red object\r\nlooming like a specter out of the darkness and hearing a man\'s voice\r\nintermingled with its gasps and snorts, he shouted with chattering\r\nteeth:\r\n\r\n"There is nothing to pay, my dear Mr. Devil! Just d-r-i-v-e along as\r\nf-a-s-t--as--ever--you--can."\r\n\r\nHis hearers applauded the story.\r\n\r\n"Who did finally invent the railroad?" inquired Doris after the\r\nmerriment had subsided.\r\n\r\n"George Stephenson, an Englishman," replied her father. "For some time\r\nhe had been experimenting with steam locomotives at the Newcastle coal\r\nmines where some agency stronger than mules or horses was needed to\r\ncarry the products from one place to another. He had no idea of\r\ntransporting people when he began to work out the suggestion. All he\r\nthought of was a coal train which would run on short lengths of track\r\nfrom mine to mine. But the notion assumed unexpected proportions until\r\nthe Darlington road, the most ambitious of his projects, reached the\r\nastonishing distance of thirty-seven miles. When the rails for it were\r\nlaid the engineer intended it should be used merely for coal\r\ntransportation, as its predecessors had been; but some of the miners who\r\nlived along the route and were daily obliged to go back and forth to\r\nwork begged that some sort of a conveyance be made that could also run\r\nalong the track and enable them to ride to work instead of walking. So a\r\nlittle log house not unlike a log cabin, with a table in the middle and\r\nsome chairs around it, was mounted on a cart that fitted the rails, and\r\na horse was harnessed to the unique vehicle."\r\n\r\n"And it was this log cabin on wheels that gave Stephenson his\r\ninspiration for a railroad train!" gasped Doris.\r\n\r\n"Yes," nodded her father. "When the engineer saw the crude object the\r\nfirst question that came to him was why could not a steam locomotive\r\npropel cars filled with people as well as cars filled with coal.\r\nAccordingly he set to work and had several coach bodies mounted on\r\ntrucks, installing a lever brake at the front of each one beside the\r\ncoachman\'s box. In front of the grotesque procession he placed a steam\r\nlocomotive and when he had fastened the coaches together he had the\r\nfirst passenger train ever seen."\r\n\r\n"It must have been a funny looking thing!" Steve exclaimed, smiling with\r\namusement at the picture the words suggested.\r\n\r\n"It certainly was," agreed his father. "If you really wish to know how\r\nfunny, some time look up the prints of this great-great-grandfather of\r\nour present-day Pullman and you will be well repaid for your trouble;\r\nthe contrast is laughable."\r\n\r\n"But was this absurd venture a success?" queried Mrs. Tolman\r\nincredulously.\r\n\r\n"Indeed it was!" returned her husband. "In fact, Stephenson, like Watt,\r\nwas one of the few world benefactors whose gift to humanity was\r\ninstantly hailed with appreciation. The railroad was, to be sure, a\r\nwretched little affair when viewed from our modern standpoint, for there\r\nwere no gates at the crossings, no signals, springless cars, and every\r\nimaginable discomfort. Fortunately, however, our ancestors had not grown\r\nup amid the luxuries of this era, and being of rugged stock that was\r\nwell accustomed to hardships of every variety they pronounced the\r\ninvention a marvel, which in truth it was.\r\n\r\n"You\'ve said it!" chuckled Steve in the slang of the day.\r\n\r\n"In the meantime," went on Mr. Tolman, "conditions all over England were\r\nbecoming more and more congested, and from every direction a clamor\r\narose for a remedy. You see the invention of steam spinning machinery\r\nhad greatly increased the output of the Manchester cotton mills until\r\nthere was no such thing as getting such a vast bulk of merchandise to\r\nthose who were eager to have it. Bales of goods waiting to be\r\ntransported to Liverpool not only overflowed the warehouses but were\r\neven stacked in the open streets where they were at the mercy of robbers\r\nand storms. The canals had all the business they could handle, and as is\r\nalways the result in such cases their owners became arrogant under their\r\nprosperity and raised their prices, making not the slightest attempt to\r\nhelp the public out of its dilemma. Undoubtedly something had to be done\r\nand in desperation a committee from Parliament sent for Stephenson that\r\nthey might discuss with him the feasibility of building a railroad from\r\nManchester to Liverpool. The committee had no great faith in the\r\nenterprise. Most of its members did not believe that a railroad of any\r\nsort was practical or that it could ever attain speed enough to be of\r\nservice. However, it was a possibility, and as they did not know which\r\nway to turn to quiet the exasperated populace they felt they might as\r\nwell investigate this remedy. It could do no harm."\r\n\r\nMr. Tolman paused as he stooped to change the gear of the car.\r\n\r\n"So Stephenson came before the board, and one question after another was\r\nhurled at him. When, however, he was asked, half in ridicule, whether or\r\nnot his locomotive could make thirty miles an hour and he answered in\r\nthe affirmative, a shout of derision arose from the Parliament members.\r\nNobody believed such a miracle possible. Nevertheless, in spite of their\r\nsceptical attitude, it was finally decided to build the\r\nLiverpool-Manchester road and about a year before its opening a date was\r\nset for a contest of locomotives to compete for the five-hundred-pound\r\nprize offered by the directors of the road."\r\n\r\n"I suppose ever so many engines entered the lists," ventured Steve with\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n"There were four," returned his father.\r\n\r\n"And Stephenson drove one of them?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I hope it got the prize!" put in Doris eagerly.\r\n\r\nHer father smiled at her earnestness.\r\n\r\n"It did," was his reply. "Stephenson\'s engine was called the \'Rocket\'\r\nand was a great improvement over the locomotive he had used at the\r\nmines, for this one had not only a steam blast but a multi-tubular\r\nboiler, a tremendous advance in engine building."\r\n\r\n"I suppose that the winner of the prize not only got the money the road\r\noffered but his engine was the one chosen as a pattern for those to be\r\nused on the new railroad," ventured Stephen.\r\n\r\n"Precisely. So you see a great deal depended on the showing each\r\nlocomotive made. Unluckily in the excitement a tinder box had been\r\nforgotten, and when it came time to start, the spark to light the fires\r\nhad to be obtained from a reading glass borrowed from one of the\r\nspectators. This, of course, caused some delay. But once the fires were\r\nblazing and steam up, the engines puffed away to the delight of those\r\nlooking on."\r\n\r\n"I am glad Stephenson was the winner," put in Doris.\r\n\r\n"Yes," agreed her father. "He had worked hard and deserved success. It\r\nwould not have seemed fair for some one else to have stolen the fruit of\r\nhis toil and brain. Yet notwithstanding this, his path to fame was not\r\nentirely smooth. Few persons win out without surmounting obstacles and\r\nStephenson certainly had his share. Not only was he forced to fight\r\ncontinual opposition, but the opening of the Manchester and Liverpool\r\nroad, which one might naturally have supposed would be a day of great\r\ntriumph, was, in spite of its success, attended by a series of\r\ncatastrophes. It was on September 15, 1830, that the ceremonies took\r\nplace, and long before the hour set for the gaily decorated trains to\r\npass the route was lined with excited spectators. The cities of\r\nLiverpool and Manchester also were thronged with those eager to see the\r\nengines start or reach their destination. There were, however, mingled\r\nwith the crowd many persons who were opposed to the new venture."\r\n\r\n"Opposed to it?" Steve repeated with surprise.\r\n\r\n"Yes. It seems odd, doesn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"But why didn\'t they want a railroad?" persisted the boy. "I thought\r\nthat was the very thing they were all demanding."\r\n\r\n"You must not forget the condition of affairs at the time," said his\r\nfather. "Remember the advent of steam machinery had deprived many of the\r\ncotton spinners of their jobs and in consequence they felt bitterly\r\ntoward all steam inventions. Then in addition there were the stagecoach\r\ndrivers who foresaw that if the railroads supplanted coaches they would\r\nno longer be needed. Moreover innkeepers were afraid that a termination\r\nof stage travel would lessen their trade."\r\n\r\n"Each man had his own axe to grind, eh?" smiled Steve.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid so," his father answered. "Human nature is very selfish, and\r\nthen as now men who worked for the general welfare regardless of their\r\nown petty preferences were rare. To the side of the enemies of the\r\ninfant invention flocked every one with a grievance. The gentry argued\r\nthat the installation of locomotives would frighten the game out of the\r\ncountry and ruin the shooting. Other opposers contended that the smoke\r\nfrom the engines would not only kill the birds but in time kill the\r\npatrons of the railroads as well. Still others protested that the\r\nsparks from the funnels might set fire to the fields of grain or to the\r\nforests. A swarm of added opponents dwelt on the fact that the\r\npassengers would be made ill by the lurching of the trains; that the\r\nrapid inrush of air would prevent their breathing; and that every sort\r\nof people would be herded together without regard to class,--the latter\r\na very terrible calamity in a land where democracy was unknown. Even\r\nsuch intelligent men as the poet Wordsworth and the famous writer Ruskin\r\ncame out hotly against the innovation, seeing in it nothing but evil."\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t the opening of the Manchester and Liverpool Railroad convince\r\nthe kickers they were wrong?" asked Steve.\r\n\r\n"Unfortunately not," was Mr. Tolman\'s reply. "You see several unlucky\r\nincidents marred the complete success of the occasion. As the trains\r\ntrimmed with bunting and flowers started out the scene seemed gay\r\nenough. On one car was a band of music; on another the directors of the\r\nroad; and on still another rode the Duke of Wellington, who at that time\r\nwas Prime Minister of England and had come down from London with various\r\nother dignitaries to honor the enterprise. Church bells rang, cannon\r\nboomed, and horns and whistles raised a din of rejoicing. But everywhere\r\namong the throng moved a large group of unemployed laborers who had\r\nreturned from the Napoleonic wars in a discontented frame of mind and\r\nresented the use of steam machinery. They were on edge for trouble and\r\nif there were none they were ready to make it. So strong was the\r\nresentment of this element against the government that it seemed\r\ntempting Providence for the Prime Minister to venture into the\r\nmanufacturing district of Manchester. At first it was decided that he\r\nwould better omit the trip altogether; but on second thought it seemed\r\nwiser for him not to add fuel to the flames by disappointing the mill\r\nworkers. The audience was in too ugly a mood to be angered. Therefore\r\nWellington bravely resolved to carry out the program and ride in one of\r\nthe open cars."\r\n\r\n"I hope nothing happened to him, Dad!" gasped Doris breathlessly.\r\n\r\n"Nothing beyond a good many minor insults and indignities," responded\r\nher father. "He was, however, in constant peril, and to those who bore\r\nthe responsibility of the function he was a source of unceasing anxiety.\r\nBut in spite of the jeers of the mob, their crowding and pushing about\r\nhis car, he kept a smiling face like the true gentleman he was. Some of\r\nthe rougher element even went so far as to hurl missiles at him. You can\r\nimagine how worried his friends were for his safety and how the\r\ndirectors who had invited him fidgeted. And as if this worry were not\r\nenough, by and by a fine rain began to fall and those persons riding in\r\nthe open coaches, as well as the decorations and the spectators, got\r\nwell drenched. Then there were delays on the turnouts while one train\r\npassed another; and as a climax to these discouragements, Mr. Hickson,\r\na member of Parliament from Liverpool, got in the path of an approaching\r\nengine, became confused and was run over; and although Stephenson\r\nhimself carried him by train to Liverpool he died that evening."\r\n\r\n"I should call the f\xc3\xaate to introduce the steam engine into England a\r\nmost disastrous and forlorn one," remarked Mrs. Tolman.\r\n\r\n"Well, in reality it was not such a failure as it sounds," replied her\r\nhusband, "for only those most closely connected with it sensed the\r\nmisfortunes that attended it. The greater part of the people along the\r\nroute were good-humored and pleased; they marveled at the trains as they\r\npassed, cheered the Duke and the authorities with him, listened with\r\ndelight to the band, and made a jest of the rain. A holiday crowd, you\r\nknow, is usually quite patient. Hence the delays that fretted the guests\r\nand the officials of the road did not annoy the multitudes so vitally."\r\n\r\n"Poor Stephenson really got some satisfaction out of the day then,"\r\nsighed Mrs. Tolman.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, indeed," said her husband. "Although I fancy the death of Mr.\r\nHickson must have overshadowed his rejoicings. Notwithstanding this,\r\nhowever, the railroad proved itself a practical venture, which was the\r\nmain thing. Such slight obstacles as the terror of the horses and the\r\nfact that the tunnels into Liverpool were so low that the engines had to\r\nbe detached and the trains hauled into the yards by mules could be\r\nremedied."\r\n\r\nA flicker of humor danced in Mr. Tolman\'s eyes.\r\n\r\n"And did England begin to build railroads right away?" Steve inquired.\r\n\r\n"Yes, and not only England but France also. Frenchmen who crossed the\r\nChannel took home glowing accounts of the novel invention and\r\nimmediately the French Government realized that that country must also\r\nhave railroads. But just as the conservative element in England had been\r\nsceptical and blocked Stephenson\'s progress--or tried to--so a\r\ncorresponding faction in France did all it could to cry down the\r\nenterprise. Even those who upheld the introduction of the roads\r\nadvocated them for only short distances out of Paris; a long trunk route\r\nthey labeled as an absurdity. Iron was too expensive, they argued;\r\nfurthermore the mountains of the country rendered extensive railroading\r\nimpossible. France did not need railroads anyway. Nevertheless the\r\nlittle group of seers who favored the invention persisted and there was\r\nno stopping the march of which they were the heralds. Railroads had come\r\nto stay and they stayed."\r\n\r\n"It was a fortunate thing they did, wasn\'t it?" murmured Doris.\r\n\r\n"A very fortunate thing," returned Mr. Tolman heartily. "Every great\r\ninvention is usually suggested by a great need and so it was with this\r\none. By 1836 the craze for railroad building swept both hemispheres. In\r\nEngland the construction of lines to most out-of-the-way and\r\nundesirable places were proposed, and the wildest schemes for propelling\r\ntrains suggested; some visionaries even tried sails as a medium of\r\nlocomotion instead of steam. Rich and poor rushed to invest their\r\nsavings in railroads and alas, in many cases the misguided enthusiasts\r\nlost every shilling of their money in the project. Great business firms\r\nfailed, banking houses were ruined, and thousands of workmen were thrown\r\nout of employment. In consequence a reaction followed and it was years\r\nbefore wary investors could again be induced to finance a railroad. In\r\nthe interim both engines and coaches underwent improvement, especially\r\nthe third-class carriage which in the early days was nothing more than\r\nan open freight car and exposed its unhappy patrons to snow, rain, and\r\nfreezing weather."\r\n\r\n"Great Scott!" cried Steve. "I should say there was room for improvement\r\nif that was the case."\r\n\r\n"There was indeed," echoed his father. "In fact, it was a long time\r\nbefore travel by train became a pleasure. Most of the engines used pitch\r\npine or soft coal as a fuel and as there were no guards on the\r\nsmokestacks to prevent it, the smoke, soot, and cinders used to blow\r\nback from the funnels and shower the passengers. On the first railroad\r\ntrip from New York to Albany those sitting outside the coaches were\r\ncompelled to put up umbrellas to protect themselves from these\r\nannoyances."\r\n\r\n"Imagine it!" burst out Doris, with a rippling laugh.\r\n\r\n"Nor were the umbrellas of any service for long," continued Mr. Tolman,\r\n"for the sparks soon burned their coverings until nothing but the steel\r\nribs remained."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t wonder the trip was not a pleasure," smiled Mrs. Tolman.\r\n\r\n"Yet, in spite of its discomfort, it was a novelty and you must not\r\nforget that, as I said before, the public of that period was a simple\r\nand less exacting one than is the public of to-day. We make a frightful\r\nfuss if we are jolted, chilled, crowded, delayed, or made uncomfortable;\r\nbut our forefathers were a hale and hearty lot--less overworked perhaps,\r\nless nervous certainly, less indulged. They had never known anything\r\nbetter than cold houses, draughty and crowded stagecoaches, and stony\r\nhighways--plenty of obstacles, you see, and few luxuries. Therefore with\r\nna\xc3\xafve delight they welcomed one new invention after another, overlooking\r\nits defects and considering themselves greatly blessed to have anything\r\nas fine. Probably we, who are a thousand per cent better off than they,\r\ndo more grumbling over the tiny flaws in the mechanism of our lives than\r\nthey did over the mammoth ones."\r\n\r\n"Oh, come, Dad!" protested Stephen. "Aren\'t you putting it rather\r\nstrong?"\r\n\r\n"Not a whit too strong, Steve," Mrs. Tolman interrupted. "I believe we\r\nare a fussy, pampered, ungrateful generation. It is rather pathetic,\r\ntoo, to think it is we who now reap the benefits of all those perfected\r\nideas which our ancestors enjoyed only in their most primitive\r\nbeginnings. It seems hardly fair that Stephenson, for example, should\r\nnever have seen a modern Pullman.\r\n\r\n"He was spared something, wasn\'t he, Dad?" chuckled Steve mischievously.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Tolman did not heed the remark.\r\n\r\n"He had the vision," returned he softly, "the joy of seeing the marvel\r\nfor the first time, imperfect as it was. Perhaps that was compensation\r\nenough. It is the reward of every inventor. Remember it is no mean\r\nprivilege to stand upon the peak in Darien which Keats pictures."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nSTEVE LEARNS A SAD LESSON\r\n\r\n\r\nNo more disasters attended the journey and the travelers spun swiftly on\r\nto Northampton, arriving at the old New England town late in the\r\nafternoon. What a scene of activity the college campus presented! Bevies\r\nof girls, hatless and in gay-colored sweaters, drifted hither and\r\nthither, their laughter floating through the twilight with musical\r\nclearness. Occasionally some newcomer would join a group and a shout of\r\nwelcome would hail her advent. Although Steve turned away from these\r\ngushing greetings with masculine scorn nevertheless he was far more\r\ninterested in the novel picture than he would have been willing to\r\nadmit. More than once he caught his eyes following a slender figure in\r\nwhite, across whose hair the sunset slanted, turning its blowing masses\r\nto a glory of gold. With what ease and freedom the girl moved! And when,\r\nas she passed, some one unceremoniously tossed her a ball and she caught\r\nit with swift accuracy, his admiration was completely won.\r\n\r\nSteve speculated as to whether she would prove to be as pretty at close\r\nrange as she was at a distance and decided not. Distance always brings\r\na glamor with it. However, pretty or not, there was no disputing that\r\nshe was a great favorite for every circle of students opened its magic\r\nring at her approach and greeted her with a noisy clamor of affection.\r\nThat she held herself with quiet reserve and was less demonstrative than\r\nthose about her did not appear to lessen in the least their regard for\r\nher, and as Stephen watched he registered the wager that she was a\r\nperson of more common sense than most girls.\r\n\r\nUntil recently it had been his habit to condemn the entire sex; but of\r\nlate he had discovered that exceptions might be made to his rule. There\r\nwere girls in the world worth noticing, even some worth talking to; and\r\nhe felt certain that this attractive creature in white was one of them.\r\nHowever, it was an absurdity to be thinking about her now and quite\r\nbeneath his dignity. But he meant sometime, when he could do so in\r\ncasual fashion, to find out from Doris who she was. He had a curiosity\r\nto know what this person who looked as if she could row a boat, swim,\r\nand play tennis well, was called. Doris was always raving about her\r\nroommate, Jane Harden. She had said so much about her that he fairly\r\ndetested the sound of her name. Now if only Jane Harden were a girl like\r\nthis one, there would be some reason and excuse for being enthusiastic\r\nover her. To have this guest brought home to spend the Christmas\r\nholidays would be a pleasure to look forward to. How well she would\r\nskate and how gracefully; and how pretty she would be, especially if\r\nshe had her hat off as she had now!\r\n\r\nIt was Doris who interrupted his reverie with the words:\r\n\r\n"I hate to have you dear people go but I suppose you will have to. But\r\ndo just wait long enough for me to see if I can\'t find Jane somewhere.\r\nShe is crazy to meet my family and will scold me to death if I let you\r\nget away."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid we can\'t stay but a moment or two, dear," objected Mrs.\r\nTolman. "It is growing late, you know, and we must get to the hotel\r\nbefore it is too dark."\r\n\r\n"But I won\'t delay you a second, Mother--truly, I won\'t. I do want you\r\nto meet Jane. I\'ll ask the girls if they have seen her anywhere."\r\n\r\n"If you get out into that mob they\'ll fall all over you and you\'ll never\r\nget back," growled Steve, who was beginning to feel hungry and was none\r\ntoo graciously inclined toward the prospective stranger.\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes, I will," laughed Doris as she darted away.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this sanguine prediction, however, she did not return as\r\npromptly as she had promised, and Mr. Tolman began to fidget uneasily.\r\n\r\n"We really ought to be starting on," he said at last. "Where is that\r\nchild?"\r\n\r\n"I knew she\'d stop to admire everybody\'s new hat and talk over the whole\r\nsummer," grumbled Steve scornfully.\r\n\r\n"You are thinking of your dinner, son," his mother put in playfully.\r\n\r\n"You bet I am! I\'m hungry as a bear."\r\n\r\nA pause followed in which visions of a big beefsteak with crisply fried\r\npotatoes blotted out every other picture from Steve\'s mind.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps we ought not to have waited," he heard his mother murmur. "But\r\nI had not the heart to disappoint Doris. She is so fond of Jane and has\r\ntalked so much about her! I had no idea it would take her so long to--"\r\n\r\n"Here she comes!" Mr. Tolman broke in.\r\n\r\nStephen glanced up. Yes, there was Doris hurrying across the grass and\r\nbeside her, walking with the same free and buoyant swing, was the girl\r\nof the golden hair,--Jane Harden.\r\n\r\nWith the same reserve and yet without a shadow of self-consciousness she\r\ncame forward and in acknowledgment of the hurried introductions extended\r\nher hand with a grave smile of welcome; but both smile and gesture\r\ncarried with them a sincerity very appealing. When she greeted Steve he\r\nflushed at being addressed as _Mr. Tolman_ and mentally rose six inches\r\nin his boots. Yes, she was decidedly pretty, far prettier than she had\r\nbeen in the distance even. In all his life he had never seen a more\r\nattractive girl.\r\n\r\n"I hope, Jane, that you are coming home with Doris for a visit sometime\r\nwhen your own family can spare you," he heard his mother say. "We all\r\nshould like to have you."\r\n\r\n"And I should like to come," was the simple and direct answer.\r\n\r\n"Do plan on it then. Come any time that you can arrange to. We should\r\nvery much enjoy having you, shouldn\'t we, Stephen?"\r\n\r\nStephen, so suddenly appealed to, turned very red and answered "Yes" in\r\na tone that seemed to come gruffly from way down inside his chest, and\r\nthen to the sound of hasty farewells the car started and shot out into\r\nthe village street and the campus with its rainbow-hued occupants was\r\nlost to sight.\r\n\r\n"A charming girl, isn\'t she?" Mrs. Tolman said to her husband. "So\r\nnatural and unaffected! Doris says that she is quite the idol of the\r\ncollege and bids fair to be class president. I wish Doris would bring\r\nher home for the holidays."\r\n\r\nInwardly Steve echoed the sentiment but outwardly he preserved silence.\r\nHe was too human a boy to dwell long on thoughts of any girl and soon\r\nJane Harden was quite forgotten in the satisfaction of a steaming dinner\r\nand a comfortable bed, and the fairy journey of the next day when amid a\r\nsplendor of crimson and gold the glories of Jacob\'s Ladder and the\r\nMohawk Trail stretched before his eyes.\r\n\r\nWithin the week the big red car headed for Coventry and without a mishap\r\nrolled into the familiar main street of the town which never had seemed\r\ndearer than after the interval of absence. As the automobile sped past,\r\nfriendly faces nodded from the sidewalks and hands were waved in\r\ngreeting. Presently his mother called from the tonneau:\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t that the Taylors\' car, Henry, coming toward us? If it is do stop,\r\nfor I want to speak to them."\r\n\r\nMr. Tolman nodded and slowed down the engine, at the same time putting\r\nout his hand to bring the on-coming car to a standstill. Yes, there were\r\nthe Taylors, and on the front seat beside the chauffeur sat "But," the\r\nfriend who had been most influential in coaxing Stephen into the dilemma\r\nof the past fortnight. It was Bud, Steve could not forget, who had been\r\nthe first to drop out of the car when trouble had befallen and who had\r\nled the other boys off on foot with him to Torrington. The memory of his\r\nchum\'s treacherous conduct still rankled in Steve\'s mind. He had not\r\nspoken to him since. But now here the two boys were face to face and\r\nunless they were to betray to their parents that something was wrong\r\nthey must meet with at least a semblance of cordiality. The question was\r\nwhich of them should be the first to make the advance.\r\n\r\nTwice Bud cleared his throat and appeared to be on the verge of uttering\r\na greeting when he encountered Stephen\'s scowl and lost courage to call\r\nthe customary: "Ah, there, Stevie!"\r\n\r\nAnd Stephen, feeling that right was on his side and being too proud to\r\nopen the conversation, could not bring himself to say: "Hi, Bud!" as he\r\nalways did.\r\n\r\nAs a result the schoolmates simply glared at each other.\r\n\r\nFortunately their elders were too much occupied with friendly gossip to\r\nnotice them and it was not until the talk shifted abruptly into a\r\nchannel that appalled both boys that their glance met with the sympathy\r\nof common danger.\r\n\r\nIt was Bud\'s mother from whose lips the terrifying words innocently\r\nfell.\r\n\r\n"Havens ill and you in New York Wednesday!" she exclaimed incredulously.\r\n"But I certainly thought I saw your car turning into the gate that very\r\nafternoon."\r\n\r\n"I guess not, my dear," asserted Mrs. Tolman tranquilly. "The car has\r\nnot been out of the garage until now. It must have been somebody else\r\nyou saw."\r\n\r\n"But it was your car--I am certain of it," persisted Mrs. Taylor.\r\n\r\n"Nonsense, Mary!" laughed her husband. "If the car has been in the\r\ngarage for a week how could it have been. You probably dreamed it. You\r\nwant a big red car so much yourself that you see them in your sleep."\r\n\r\n"No, I don\'t," protested Mrs. Taylor smiling good-humoredly at her\r\nhusband\'s banter.\r\n\r\n"Well, it may have been the Woodworths\'," Mrs. Tolman said with soothing\r\ninspiration. "They have a car like ours and Mrs. Woodworth came to call\r\nwhile I was away. I\'ll ask the maid when I get home."\r\n\r\n"Y-e-s, it may have been the Woodworths\'," admitted Mrs. Taylor\r\nreluctantly. It was plain, however, that she was unconvinced. "But I\r\ncould have staked my oath that it was your car and Steve driving it,"\r\nshe added carelessly.\r\n\r\n"Steve!" Mr. Tolman ejaculated.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Steve never drives the car," put in Mrs. Tolman quickly. "He is not\r\nold enough to have a license yet, you know. That proves absolutely that\r\nyou were mistaken. But Stephen has run the car now and then when Havens\r\nor his father were with him and he does very well at it. Some day he\r\nwill be driving it alone, won\'t you, son?"\r\n\r\nBending forward she patted the boy\'s shoulder affectionately.\r\n\r\nFor an instant it seemed to Stephen as if every one in both cars must\r\nhave heard the _pound_, _pound_, _pound_ of his heart, as if everybody\r\nfrom Coventry to Torrington must have heard it. Helplessly he stared at\r\nBud and Bud stared back. No words were needed to assure the two that\r\nonce again they were linked together by misdoing as they often had been\r\nin the past. Bud looked anxiously toward his chum. He was a mischievous,\r\nhappy-go-lucky lad but in his homely, freckled face there was a winsome\r\nmanliness. Whatever the scrapes he got into through sheer love of fun it\r\nwas characteristic of him that he was always courageous enough to\r\nconfess to them. This was the first inkling he had had that Stephen had\r\nnot acquainted his father with the escapade of the previous week and\r\nsuch a course was so at variance with his own frank nature that he was\r\naghast. Even now he waited, expecting his pal would offer the true\r\nexplanation of the mystery under discussion. He was ready to bear his\r\nshare of the blame,--bear more than belonged to him if he could lighten\r\nSteve\'s sentence of punishment.\r\n\r\nBut the silence remained unbroken and the words he expected to hear did\r\nnot come. A wave of surprise swept over his face, surprise followed by a\r\ngrowing scorn. It came to him in a flash that Stephen Tolman, the boy he\r\nhad looked up to as a sort of idol, was a coward, a coward! He was\r\nafraid! It seemed impossible. Why, Steve was always in the thick of the\r\nfootball skirmishes, never shrinking from the roughness of the game; he\r\nwas a fearless hockey player, a dauntless fighter. Coward was the last\r\nname one would have thought of applying to him. And yet here he sat\r\ncowering before the just result of his conduct. Bud was disappointed,\r\nashamed; he turned away his head but not before the wretched lad who\r\nconfronted him had caught in his glance the same contemptuous expression\r\nhe had seen in O\'Malley\'s face.\r\n\r\nAgain Stephen was despised and knew it.\r\n\r\nNevertheless it would not do to betray his secret now. He must not show\r\nthat he was disconcerted. At every cost he must brazen out the affair.\r\nHe had gone too far to do otherwise. He wondered as he sat there if any\r\none suspected him; if his father, whose eye was as keen as that of an\r\neagle, had put together any of the threads of evidence. He might be\r\ncherishing suspicions this very moment. It seemed impossible that he\r\nshouldn\'t. If only he would speak and have it over! Anything would be\r\nbetter than this suspense and uncertainty.\r\n\r\nMr. Tolman, however, maintained unwonted stillness and save for a\r\nrestless twitching of his fingers on the wheel of the car did not move.\r\nIf, thought Steve miserably, he could summon the nerve to look up, he\r\nwould know in a second from his father\'s face whether he was annoyed or\r\nangry. At last the situation became unbearable and come what might he\r\nraised his eyes. To his amazement his father was sitting there quite\r\nserenely and so was everybody else, and the pause that seemed to him to\r\nstretch into hours had glided off as harmlessly and as naturally as\r\nother pauses. Apparently nobody was thinking about him, at least nobody\r\nbut Bud. With a sigh of relief his tense muscles relaxed. He could trust\r\nBud not to betray him. Once again he was safe!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nMR. TOLMAN\'S SECOND YARN\r\n\r\n\r\nFor a day or two it seemed to Stephen that he would never cease to be\r\nhaunted by the shame and regret that followed his confiscation of the\r\nbig red touring car, or forget the good resolutions he made in\r\nconsequence; but within an incredibly short time both considerations\r\nwere thrust into the background by the rush of life\'s busy current.\r\nSchool and athletics kept him occupied so that he had little leisure for\r\nthought, and when he was in the house his father and mother smiled on\r\nhim as affectionately as before, which did much to restore to him his\r\nnormal poise. Long ago the boys had dropped the motor-car episode from\r\ntheir memories and even Bud Taylor did not refer to it when he and Steve\r\ncame together to organize the hockey team for the approaching matches.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Thanksgiving holidays were drawing near and Mr.\r\nTolman suggested that he and Stephen should run over to New York for a\r\nshort visit. With the prospect of so much pleasure was it strange the\r\nboy ceased to dwell on the unhappiness of the past or the possibility of\r\ndisaster in the future? The coming journey to New York was, to be sure,\r\nno great novelty, for Stephen had often accompanied his father there on\r\nbusiness excursions; nevertheless such an outing was a treat to which he\r\nlooked forward as a sort of Arabian Nights adventure when for a short\r\ntime he stayed at a large hotel, ate whatever food pleased his fancy,\r\nand went sight-seeing and to innumerable "shows" with his father. He was\r\nwont to return to Coventry after the holiday with a throng of happy\r\nmemories and many a tale of marvels with which to entertain the boys.\r\n\r\nTherefore when he and his father boarded the express Thanksgiving week\r\nthe lad was in the highest spirits.\r\n\r\n"Motor-cars are all very well," observed Mr. Tolman, as the porter\r\nstowed their luggage away, "but on a cold night like this a Pullman car\r\non a well-laid track is not to be despised. Eh, son?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe that I should want to travel to New York in a\r\ntouring-car at this time of year," agreed Stephen, smiling.\r\n\r\n"It is getting too late in the season to use an open car, anyway,"\r\nrejoined his father. "I have delayed putting the car up because I have\r\nbeen hoping we might have a little more warm weather; but I guess the\r\nwarm days have gone and the winter has come to stay now."\r\n\r\n"But there is no snow yet, Dad."\r\n\r\n"No. Still it is too chilly to drive with any comfort. The Taylors\r\nshipped their car off last week and when I get home I shall do the\r\nsame."\r\n\r\nStephen looked disappointed.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t mind the cold when I\'m wrapped up," he ventured.\r\n\r\n"You are not at the wheel, son," was his father\'s quick retort. "The man\r\nwho is has his fingers nipped roundly, I can assure you. It is a pity we\r\nhave become so soft and shrink so from discomfort. Think what our\r\nforbears endured when they went on journeys!"\r\n\r\n"Neither the English stagecoaches nor Stephenson\'s railroad could have\r\nbeen very comfortable, to judge from your descriptions of them," laughed\r\nSteve.\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t heap all the blame on the English," his father replied. "Our\r\nown modes of travel in the early days were quite as bad as were those on\r\nthe other side of the water."\r\n\r\n"I wish you would tell me about the first American railroads," said the\r\nboy. "I was wondering about them the other night."\r\n\r\nMr. Tolman settled back in his seat thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n"America," he answered presently, "went through a pioneer period of\r\nrailroading not unlike England\'s. Many strange steam inventions were\r\ntried in different parts of the country, and many fantastic scientific\r\nnotions put before the public. Even previous to Watt\'s steam engine\r\nOliver Evans had astonished the quiet old city of Philadelphia by\r\ndriving through its peaceful streets in a queer steam vehicle, half\r\ncarriage and half boat, which he had mounted on wheels. Evans was an\r\ningenious fellow, a born inventor if ever there was one, who worked out\r\nquite a few steam devices, some of which Watt later improved and\r\nadopted. Then in 1812 John Stevens of New York got interested in the\r\nsteam idea and urged the commissioners of his state to build a railroad\r\nbetween Lake Erie and Albany, suggesting that a steam engine not unlike\r\nthe one that propelled the Hudson River ferryboats could be used as\r\npower for the trains. He was enthusiastic over the scheme but the New\r\nYork officials had no faith in the proposition, insisting that a steam\r\nlocomotive could never be produced that would grip the rails with\r\nsufficient tension to keep cars on the track or draw a heavy load."\r\n\r\n"They\'d better have given the plan a showdown," interrupted Steve\r\ngrimly.\r\n\r\n"No doubt that is true," admitted his father. "However, it is very easy\r\nfor us, with our knowledge of science, to look back and laugh at their\r\nmistakes. The world was very new in those days and probably had we lived\r\nat that time and been equally ignorant of railroads and engines we\r\nshould have been just as cautious and unbelieving. The railroad was\r\nstill a young invention, you must remember, and to many persons it\r\nseemed a rather mad, uncertain enterprise."\r\n\r\n"When was the first American railroad built?" inquired the lad.\r\n\r\n"If by a railroad you mean something which moved along rails like a\r\ntram-car, the first such road was built at Quincy, Mass., in 1826; but\r\nit was not a steam railroad. It was merely a train of cars drawn by\r\nhorses along a track that spanned a series of stone ties. Nor was it\r\nvery extensive in length. In fact, it was only three miles long and\r\nprobably would not have been built at all if the question had not arisen\r\nas to how the heavy blocks of granite necessary for the construction of\r\nBunker Hill monument were to be carried from the quarries to the\r\nNeponset River, the point from which they were to be shipped to\r\nCharlestown. Bryant, the builder of the road, had heard of Stephenson\'s\r\nsuccessful use of tracks at the Newcastle coal mines and saw no reason\r\nwhy a road of similar pattern could not be laid from the quarries to the\r\nship landing. If such a plan could be worked out, he argued, it would be\r\na great saving of time and labor. Accordingly the railroad was built at\r\na cost of more than ten thousand dollars a mile and it unquestionably\r\nperformed the service required of it even if it did necessitate the\r\nexpenditure of a good deal of money. Since the grade sloped toward the\r\nriver the heavily loaded cars moved down the tracks very easily and as\r\nthey were empty on their return the ascent was made with equal ease. All\r\nthe year round this quaint railroad was in constant use, a snowplow\r\nbeing attached to the front car in winter to clear the deep snow from\r\nthe tracks."\r\n\r\n"I suppose that was the first railroad snowplow, too," observed Stephen.\r\n\r\n"I suppose it was," his father agreed. "For some time afterward this\r\nold road with its granite ties was the model from which American\r\nengineers took their inspiration, it being many years before railroad\r\nbuilders realized that wooden ties were more flexible and made a better,\r\neven though less durable roadbed."\r\n\r\n"Were any more railroads like the Quincy road built in America?"\r\nquestioned Steve.\r\n\r\n"Yes, a railroad very much like it was built in the Pennsylvania mining\r\ncountry to transport coal from the mines at Summit down to the Lehigh\r\nValley for shipment. An amusing story is told of this railroad, too. It\r\nextended down the mountainside in a series of sharp inclines between\r\nwhich lay long stretches of level ground. Now you know when you coast\r\ndownhill your speed will give you sufficient impetus to carry you quite\r\na way on a flat road before you come to a stop. So it was with this\r\nrailroad. But the force the cars gained on the hillside could not carry\r\nthem entirely across these long levels, and therefore platform cars were\r\nbuilt on which a number of mules could be transported and later\r\nharnessed to the cars to pull them across the flat stretches. At the end\r\nof each level the mules would be taken aboard again and carried down to\r\nthe next one, where they were once more harnessed to the cars. Now the\r\ntale goes that to the chagrin of the railroad people the mules soon grew\r\nto enjoy riding so much that they had no mind to get out and walk when\r\nthe level places were reached and it became almost impossible to make\r\nthem. All of which proves the theory I advanced before--that too much\r\nluxury is not good for any of us and will even spoil a perfectly good\r\nmule."\r\n\r\nSteve chuckled in response.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid with railroads like these America did not make much\r\nprogress," he said.\r\n\r\n"No very rapid strides," owned his father. "Nevertheless men were\r\nconstantly hammering away at the railroad idea. In out-of-the-way\r\ncorners of the country were many persons who had faith that somehow,\r\nthey knew not how, the railroad would in time become a practical agency\r\nof locomotion. When the Rainhill contest of engines took place in\r\nEngland before the opening of the Liverpool-Manchester road, and\r\nStephenson carried off the prize, Horatio Allen, one of the engineers of\r\nthe Delaware and Hudson Canal Company, was sent over to examine the\r\nlocomotives competing and if possible buy one for a new railroad they\r\nhoped to put into operation. Unluckily none of the engines were for sale\r\nbut he was able to purchase at Stourbridge a steam locomotive and this\r\nhe shipped to New York. It reached there in 1829--a ridiculous little\r\nengine weighing only seven tons. Before its arrival a track of hemlock\r\nrails fastened to hemlock ties had been laid and as the Lackawanna River\r\nlay directly in the path of the proposed road a wooden trestle about a\r\nhundred feet high had been built across the river. This trestle was of\r\nvery frail construction and calculated to sustain only a four-ton\r\nengine and therefore when the seven-ton locomotive from Stourbridge\r\narrived and was found to weigh nearly double that specification there\r\nwas great consternation."\r\n\r\n"Did they tear the trestle down and build another?" asked Steve with\r\nmuch interest.\r\n\r\nMr. Tolman did not heed the question.\r\n\r\n"Now in addition to the disconcerting size of the engine," he continued,\r\n"the wooden rails which had been laid during the previous season had\r\nwarped with the snows and were in anything but desirable condition. So\r\naltogether the prospect of trying out the enterprise, on which a good\r\ndeal of money had already been spent, was not alone disheartening but\r\nperilous."\r\n\r\n"The inspectors or somebody else would have put an end to such a crazy\r\nscheme jolly quick if it had been in our day, wouldn\'t they?" grinned\r\nthe boy.\r\n\r\n"Yes, nobody could get very far with anything so unsafe now," his father\r\nresponded. "But all this happened before the era of inspectors,\r\nconstruction laws, or the _Safety First_ slogan. Hence no one interfered\r\nwith Horatio Allen. If he chose to break his neck and the necks of many\r\nothers as well he was free to do so. Therefore, nothing daunted, he got\r\nup steam in his baby engine, which was the more absurd for having\r\npainted at its front a fierce red lion, and off he started--along his\r\nhemlock railroad. The frail bridge swayed and bent as the locomotive\r\nrumbled over it but by sheer miracle it did not give way and Allen\r\nreached the other side without being plunged to the bottom of the\r\nriver."\r\n\r\nSteve drew a long breath of relief.\r\n\r\n"Did they go on using the railroad after that?" he asked.\r\n\r\nHis father shook his head.\r\n\r\n"No," he replied. "Although every one agreed that the demonstration was\r\na success the wooden rails were not durable enough to last long and the\r\ncompany was not rich enough to replace them with metal ones. Therefore,\r\nin spite of Allen\'s pleas and his wonderful exhibition of courage, the\r\nroad fell into disuse, the engine was taken apart, and the enterprise\r\nabandoned."\r\n\r\n"What a pity!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, it was, for had New York persevered in this undertaking the\r\nrailroad might have made its advent in the United States much sooner\r\nthan it did. As it was, once again, like a meteor, the experiment\r\nflashed into sight and disappeared with success well within reach."\r\n\r\n"And who was the next promoter?"\r\n\r\n"Peter Cooper was the next experimenter of note," Mr. Tolman answered,\r\n"and his adventure with railroading was entertaining, too. He lived in\r\nBaltimore and being of a commercial trend of mind he decided that if a\r\nrailroad could be built through the Potomac Valley and across the\r\nAlleghany Mountains it might win back for his state the trade that was\r\nrapidly being snatched away by the Erie and Pennsylvania Canal. With\r\nthis idea in mind Cooper built thirteen miles of track and after\r\nexperimenting with a sort of tram-car and finding it a failure he had a\r\ncar made that should be propelled by sails."\r\n\r\n"Sails!" gasped Steve.\r\n\r\nHis father smiled at his astonishment.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sails!" he repeated. "Into this strangely equipped vehicle he\r\ninvited some of the editors of the Baltimore papers, and little sensing\r\nwhat was before them the party set forth on its excursion."\r\n\r\n"Did the car go?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, it went all right!" chuckled Mr. Tolman. "The trouble was not with\r\nits _going_. The difficulty was that as it flew along the rails a cow\r\nsuddenly loomed in its pathway and as she did not move out of the way of\r\nthe approaching car she and the railroad pioneers came into collision.\r\nWith a crash the car toppled over and the editors, together with the\r\nenraged Peter Cooper, were thrown out into the mud. Of course the affair\r\ncaused the public no end of laughter but to Cooper and his guests it\r\nproved convincingly that sails were not a desirable substitute for steam\r\npower."\r\n\r\n"I suppose Cooper then went to work to build some other kind of a\r\nrailroad," mused Steve.\r\n\r\n"That is exactly what he did," was the rejoinder. "He did not, however,\r\ndo this deliberately but rather fell into a dilemma that left him no\r\nother choice. You see a group of men coaxed him to buy some land\r\nthrough which it was expected the new Baltimore and Ohio Railroad was to\r\npass. These prospectors figured that as the road was already started and\r\na portion of the wooden track laid the railroad was a sure thing, and by\r\nselling their land to the railroad authorities they would be enabled to\r\nturn quite a fortune for themselves. In all good faith Cooper had joined\r\nthe company and then, after discovering that the railroad men had\r\napparently abandoned their plan to build, in dastardly fashion, one\r\nafter another of the promoters wriggled out of the enterprise and left\r\npoor Peter Cooper with a large part of his money tied up in a worthless,\r\npartially constructed railroad."\r\n\r\n"What a rotten trick!" cried Steve.\r\n\r\n"Yes; and yet perhaps Cooper deserved a little chastisement," smiled Mr.\r\nTolman. "Instead of making money out of other people as he had\r\nintended--"\r\n\r\n"He got stung himself!" burst out the boy.\r\n\r\n"Practically so, yes," was the reply. "Well, at any rate, there he was\r\nand if he was ever to get back any of his fortune he must demonstrate\r\nthat he had profound faith in the partly constructed railroad.\r\nAccordingly he bought a small engine weighing about a ton--"\r\n\r\n"One ton!"\r\n\r\n"So small that it was christened the \'Tom Thumb.\' He now had his wooden\r\nrails and his pygmy engine but was confronted by still another\r\nperplexity. The railroad must pass a very abrupt curve, it was\r\nunavoidable that it should do so--a curve so dangerous that everybody\r\nwho saw it predicted that to round it without the engine jumping the\r\ntrack and derailing the cars behind would be impossible. Poor Peter\r\nCooper faced a very discouraging problem. There was no gainsaying that\r\nthe curve was a bad one; moreover, his locomotive was not so perfect a\r\nproduct as he might have wished. It had been built under his direction\r\nand consisted of the wee engine he had bought in New York connected with\r\nan iron boiler about the size of an ordinary tin wash boiler; and as no\r\niron piping was made in America at this time Cooper had taken some old\r\nsteel musket barrels as a substitute for tubing. With this crude affair\r\nhe was determined to convince the public that a steam railroad was a\r\nworkable proposition."\r\n\r\n"He had a nerve!"\r\n\r\n"It took nerve to live and accomplish anything in those days," returned\r\nMr. Tolman. "In the first place few persons had fortunes large enough to\r\nback big undertakings; and in addition America was still such a young\r\ncountry that it had not begun to produce the materials needed by\r\ninventors for furthering any very extensive projects. In fact the world\r\nof progress was, as Kipling says, \'very new and all.\' Hence human\r\ningenuity had to make what was at hand answer the required purpose, and\r\nas a result Peter Cooper\'s Tom Thumb engine, with its small iron boiler\r\nand its gun-barrel tubing, was set upon the wooden track, and an open\r\ncar (a sort of box on wheels with seats in it) was fastened to it. Into\r\nthis primitive conveyance the guests invited for the occasion clambered.\r\nAhead lay the forbidding curve. Stephenson, the English engineer, had\r\nalready stated mathematically the extreme figure at which a curve could\r\nbe taken and the locomotive still remain on the track, and Peter Cooper\r\nwas well aware that the curve he must make was a far worse one. However,\r\nit would never do for him to betray that he had any misgivings.\r\nTherefore, together with his guests, he set out on his eventful trip\r\nwhich was either to demolish them all, or convince the dignitaries of\r\nthe railroad company that not only was a steam railroad practical but\r\nthat the Baltimore and Ohio Road was a property valuable enough to be\r\nbacked by capital."\r\n\r\nSteve leaned forward, listening eagerly to the story.\r\n\r\n"Slowly the little engine started, and nearer and nearer came the\r\nterrible curve. The train was now running at fifteen miles an hour, a\r\nspeed almost unbelievable to the simple souls of that time. Round the\r\ncurve it went in safety, increasing its velocity to eighteen miles an\r\nhour. The railroad officials who were Cooper\'s guests were frantic with\r\nenthusiasm. One man produced paper and pencil and begged those present\r\nto write their names, just to prove that it was possible to write even\r\nwhen flying along at such a meteoric rate of speed. Another man jotted\r\ndown a few sentences to demonstrate that to think and write connected\r\nphrases were things that could be done, in spite of the fact that one\r\nwas dashing through space with this unearthly rapidity."\r\n\r\n"So the railroad men were converted, were they?"\r\n\r\n"They were more than converted; they were exultant," said his father.\r\n"Of course it was some time after this before the Baltimore and Ohio\r\nRailroad became a reality. Capital had to be raised and the project\r\nstably launched."\r\n\r\n"Oh, then this was not the first railroad in the country, after all,"\r\nobserved the boy in a disappointed tone.\r\n\r\n"No. South Carolina boasts the first regular passenger locomotive\r\npropelled by steam," returned Mr. Tolman. "This road ran from Charleston\r\nto Hamburg and although a charter was obtained for it in 1827 it took\r\nall the first year to lay six miles of track. In fact it was not until\r\n1830 that the railroad began to be operated to any extent. When it was,\r\na locomotive, every part of which had been produced in this country, was\r\nemployed to draw the trains. This was the first steam locomotive of\r\nAmerican make in history. It was dubbed \'The Best Friend\' and, like the\r\nengines that had preceded it, had a series of interesting adventures.\r\nSince it was the only locomotive in the possession of the road and was\r\nin use all day any repairs on the hard-worked object had to be made at\r\nnight."\r\n\r\n"Humph!" ejaculated Stephen.\r\n\r\n"Nevertheless \'The Best Friend\' might have gone on its way prosperously\r\nhad it not been for the ignorance of those who ran it. The engineer, to\r\nbe sure, understood more or less about a steam locomotive although he\r\nwas none too wise; but the fireman, unfortunately, understood next to\r\nnothing, and one day, on being left alone in the cab and seeing the\r\nsteam escaping from the safety valve, he conceived the notion that a\r\nleak was causing unnecessary waste. Therefore he securely screwed up the\r\nspace through which the steam had been issuing, and to make prevention\r\nmore certain he himself, a large and heavy man, sat down on the escape\r\nvalve."\r\n\r\n"And presto!" exclaimed Steve, rubbing his hands.\r\n\r\n"Exactly so! Presto, indeed! Figuratively speaking, he blew sky-high and\r\n\'The Best Friend\' with him," replied Mr. Tolman. "It was an unfortunate\r\nhappening, too, for people were still ill-informed about the uses of\r\nsteam and very nervous about its mysterious power and this accident only\r\nserved to make them more so. For some time afterward many persons\r\nrefused to patronize the railroad in spite of all the authorities could\r\ndo to soothe them. In time, however, the public calmed down, although in\r\norder to reassure them it was found necessary to put a car heaped with\r\nbales of cotton between them and the engine, not only to conceal the\r\nmonster from their view but also to convince them that it was some\r\ndistance away. Whether they also had a vague notion that in case they\r\nwent skyward the cotton might soften their fall when they came down, I\r\ndo not know."\r\n\r\n"Railroading certainly had its troubles, didn\'t it?" Steve commented\r\nwith amusement.\r\n\r\n"It certainly had, especially in our own country," was the reply. "In\r\nEngland Stephenson and other experimenters like him had materials at\r\nhand which to some extent served their purpose; moreover, thanks to Watt\r\nand other inventors, there were definite scientific ideas to work from.\r\nBut in America the successful railroad which might serve as a model was\r\nunknown. Therefore for some time English engines continued to be shipped\r\nacross the sea, and even then it was a long time before our American\r\nengineers understood much about their mechanism. Only by means of\r\nrepeated experiments, first in one part of the country and then in\r\nanother, did our American railroads, so marvelous in their construction,\r\ncome into being."\r\n\r\nMr. Tolman paused a moment, yawned, and then rose and beckoned to the\r\nporter.\r\n\r\n"We still have much to perfect in our modern railroad, however," he said\r\nwith a touch of humor. "The sleeping car, for example, is an\r\nabomination, as you are speedily to have proved to you. Here, porter!\r\nWe\'d like these berths made up. I guess we\'d better turn in now, son.\r\nYou have had enough railroading for one day and are tired. You must get\r\na rest and be in the pink of condition to-morrow for, remember, you are\r\ngoing to wake up in New York."\r\n\r\n"If it will make to-morrow come any quicker I am quite ready to go to\r\nbed," retorted Stephen, with a sleepy smile.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nA HOLIDAY JOURNEY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning, when Steve woke to the swaying of the train and a\r\ndrowsy sense of confusion and smoke, he could not for an instant think\r\nwhere he was; but it did not take long for him to open his eyes,\r\nrecollect the happenings of the previous day, smile with satisfaction,\r\nand hurriedly wriggle into his clothes.\r\n\r\nAlready he could hear his father stirring in the berth below and\r\npresently the elder man called:\r\n\r\n"We shall be in New York in half-an-hour, son, so get your traps packed\r\nup. How did you sleep?"\r\n\r\n"Sound as a top!"\r\n\r\n"That is fine! I was afraid you might not rest very well. As I observed\r\nlast night, a sleeping car is not all that it might be. The day will\r\ncome when it will have to be improved. However, since it gets us to New\r\nYork safely and economizes hours of day travel, it is a blessing for\r\nwhich we should be grateful."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he moved into the aisle and helped the boy down from his\r\nperch; they then sought out a distant seat where they dropped down and\r\nwatched the rapidly passing landscape.\r\n\r\n"I have been thinking, as I was dressing, of the story you told me last\r\nnight about our American railroads," said the lad. "It surprised me a\r\ngood deal to hear that the South took the lead over the North in the\r\nintroduction of the steam locomotive."\r\n\r\nMr. Tolman smiled into the eager face.\r\n\r\n"While it is true that South Carolina took the initiative in railroading\r\nfor a short time the South did not remain long in the ascendency," he\r\nanswered, "for the third steam locomotive put into actual passenger\r\nservice was built at Albany. This city, because of its geographical\r\nposition, was a great stagecoach center, having lines that radiated from\r\nit into the interior in almost every direction. And not only was it an\r\nimportant coaching rendezvous but as it was also a leading commercial\r\ntributary of New York the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad had built a short\r\ntrack between Albany and Schenectady and supplied it with cars propelled\r\nby horse power. Now in 1831 the company decided to transform this road\r\ninto a steam railroad and to this end ordered a steam locomotive called\r\nthe \'DeWitt Clinton\' to be constructed at West Point with the aim of\r\ndemonstrating to the northern States the advantages of steam\r\ntransportation. You can imagine the excitement this announcement caused.\r\nThink, if you had never seen a steam engine, how eager you would be to\r\nbehold the wonder. These olden time New Yorkers felt precisely the same\r\nway. Although the route was only sixteen miles long the innovation was\r\nsuch a novel and tremendous one that all along the way crowds of\r\nspectators assembled to watch the passing of the magic train. At the\r\nstarting point near the Hudson there was a dense throng of curious\r\nonlookers who gathered to see for the first time in all their lives the\r\nsteam locomotive and its brigade of coaches,--for in those days people\r\nnever spoke of a train of cars; a group of railroad carriages was always\r\nknown as a brigade, and the term _coach_ was, and in many cases still is\r\napplied to the cars. This train that created so much interest was\r\npractically like Stephenson\'s English trains, being made up of a small\r\nlocomotive, a tender, and two carriages constructed by fastening\r\nstagecoach bodies on top of railroad trucks. Stout iron chains held\r\nthese vehicles together--a primitive, and as it subsequently proved, a\r\nvery impractical method of coupling."\r\n\r\n"It must have been a funny enough train!" Steve exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"I doubt if it appeared so to the people of that time," his father\r\nreturned, "for since the audience of that period had nothing with which\r\nto compare it, it probably seemed quite the ordinary thing. Was it not\r\nlike the railroad trains used in England? How was America to know\r\nanything different? Yes, I am sure the \'DeWitt Clinton\' was considered a\r\nvery grand affair indeed, even though it was only a small engine without\r\na cab, and had barely enough platform for the engineer to stand upon\r\nwhile he drove the engine and fed the pitch-pine logs into the furnace."\r\n\r\n"How many people did the train hold?" inquired Steve, with growing\r\ncuriosity.\r\n\r\n"Each coach carried six persons inside and two outside," was Mr.\r\nTolman\'s reply, "and on this first eventful trip not quite enough\r\nadventurous souls could be found to fill the seats. Perhaps could the\r\nunwary passengers who did go have foreseen the discomforts ahead of them\r\nthere would have been fewer yet. But often ignorance is bliss. It\r\ncertainly was so in this case for in high feather the fortunate ones\r\ntook their places, the envied of many a beholder."\r\n\r\n"What happened?" asked the boy eagerly. "Was the trip a success?"\r\n\r\n"That depends on what you mean by success," laughed his father. "If you\r\nare asking whether the passengers arrived safely at Schenectady I can\r\nassure you that they did; but if you wish to know whether the journey\r\nwas a comfortable one, and likely to convert the stranger to steam\r\ntravel, that is quite another matter. The description of the excursion\r\nwhich history has handed down to us is very na\xc3\xafve. In the first place\r\nthe pitch-pine fuel sent a smudge of smoke and cinders back over all the\r\npassengers and if it did not entirely choke them it at least encrusted\r\nthem thickly with dirt, particularly the ones who sat outside. The\r\numbrellas they opened to protect themselves were soon demolished, their\r\ncoverings being blown away or burned up by the sparks. In fact, it was\r\nonly by continual alertness that the clothing of the venturesome\r\ntravelers was not ignited. In the meantime those inside the coaches\r\nfared little better, for as the coaches were without springs and the\r\ntrack was none too skilfully laid, the jolting of the cars all but sent\r\nthe heads of the passengers through the roof of the coaches. Added to\r\nthis the train proceeded in a series of jerks that wrenched the chains\r\nand banged one coach into another with such violence that those outside\r\nwere in danger of being hurled down upon the track, and those inside\r\nwere tossed hither and thither from seat to seat. You will easily\r\ncomprehend that the outing was not one of unalloyed pleasure."\r\n\r\nThe boy laughed heartily.\r\n\r\n"Of course," went on Mr. Tolman, "there was no help for anybody until\r\nthe first stopping place was reached; but when the engine slowed down\r\nand the grimy, almost unrecognizable pilgrims had a chance to catch\r\ntheir breath, something had to be done by way of a remedy. The remedy\r\nfortunately was near at hand and consisted of nothing very difficult.\r\nSome of the more enterprising of the company leaped out and tore the\r\nrails from a near-by fence and after stretching the coupling chains taut,\r\nthey bound them to the wooden boards. In this way the coaches were kept\r\napart and the silk hats of the dignitaries who had been invited to\r\nparticipate in the opening of the road rescued from total\r\nannihilation."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll bet everybody was glad to disembark at Schenectady," declared\r\nStephen.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll wager they were! They must have been exhausted from being jounced\r\nand jostled about. Nevertheless the novelty of the adventure probably\r\nbrought its own compensations, and they were doubtless diverted from\r\ntheir woes by the sight of the cheering and envious spectators, the\r\nterrified horses, and the open-mouthed children that greeted them\r\nwherever they went."\r\n\r\n"But the promoters could hardly expect the public to be very keen for a\r\nsteam railroad after such an exhibition," reflected Steve.\r\n\r\n"Fortunately our forefathers were not as critical as you," said his\r\nfather, "and in consequence the coach line from Albany to Schenectady\r\nwas speedily supplanted by a steam railroad, as were the various coach\r\nlines into the interior of the State. As a result hundreds of\r\nbroken-down coach horses were turned out to pasture, a merciful thing.\r\nGradually a series of short steam railway lines were constructed from\r\none end of the State to the other, until in 1851 these were joined\r\ntogether to make a continuous route to Lake Erie. Perhaps we have only\r\nscant appreciation of the revolution that came with this advance in\r\ntransportation. It meant the beginning of travel and commerce between\r\nthe eastern States and those in the interior of the country; it also\r\nmeant the speedy shipment of eastern products to the West, where they\r\nwere greatly needed, and the reception of western commodities in the\r\nEast. But more than all this, it signified a bond of fellowship between\r\nthe scattered inhabitants of the same vast country who up to this time\r\nhad been almost total strangers to one another, and was a mighty stride\r\nin the direction of national loyalty and sympathy. Therefore it was\r\nentirely seemly that Millard Fillmore, then President of the United\r\nStates, and Daniel Webster, the Secretary of State, should be honored\r\nguests at the celebration that attended the opening of the railroad."\r\n\r\n"Did the road reach no farther than Lake Erie?" asked Stephen.\r\n\r\n"Not at first," replied his father. "From that point commerce was\r\ncarried on by means of ships on the Great Lakes. But in time western\r\nrailroad companies began to build short stretches of track which later\r\non they joined together as the other railroad builders had done."\r\n\r\n"Did the line go all the way across the country?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, indeed. Our trans-continental railroads were a mighty project in\r\nthemselves and their story is a romance which I will tell you some other\r\ntime. Before such stupendous enterprises could be realities, our young,\r\nyoung country had a vast deal of growing to do, and its infant railroads\r\nand engineering methods had to be greatly improved. So long as we still\r\nbuilt roads where the rails were liable to come up through the floor and\r\ninjure the passengers, and where the tracks were not strongly enough\r\nconstructed to resist floods and freshets, our steam locomotion could\r\nnot expect any universal degree of popularity."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suppose, though, that the cows continued to tip the cars over\r\nand turn the passengers out into the dirt as they did in the days of\r\nPeter Cooper," mused Steve thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n"They may not have derailed the trains," his father replied quite\r\nseriously, "but they often did delay them. Nor could the passengers be\r\nblamed for finding fault with the unheated cars, or the fact that\r\nsometimes, when it snowed hard, the engineer ran his engine under cover\r\nand refused to go on, leaving those on the train the choice of staying\r\nwhere they were until the storm abated or going on foot to their\r\ndestination."\r\n\r\n"Not really!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed. Such things happened quite frequently. Then there are\r\nstories of terrible gales when the snow piled up on the track until the\r\nengine had to be dug out, for snow plows did not keep the tracks clear\r\nthen as they do now; nor was it an uncommon thing for the mud from the\r\nspring washouts to submerge the rails, in which case the engines had to\r\nbe pulled out of the mire by oxen. In fact, at certain seasons of the\r\nyear some trains carried oxen for this very purpose. For you must\r\nremember that the engines of that date were not powerful enough to make\r\nprogress through mud, snow, or against fierce head winds. Often a strong\r\ngale would delay them for hours or bring them to a standstill\r\naltogether."\r\n\r\n"Well, I guess it is no wonder we were not equipped to build a\r\ntrans-continental road under such conditions," said the lad, with a quiet\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n"Oh, these defects were only a minor part of our railroad tribulations,"\r\nresponded his father. "For example, when Pennsylvania started her first\r\nrailroad the year after the line between New York and Schenectady was\r\nlaid, there was a fresh chapter of obstacles. Strangely enough, the\r\nlocomotive, \'Old Ironsides,\' was built by Mr. M. W. Baldwin, whose name\r\nhas since become celebrated as the founder of the Baldwin Locomotive\r\nWorks. In 1832, however, the Baldwin locomotive was quite a different\r\nproduct from the present-day magnificently constructed steam engine.\r\nThis initial attempt at locomotive building was a queer little engine\r\nwith wheels so light that unless there was plenty of ballast aboard it\r\nwas impossible to keep it on the track; and besides that, the poor wee\r\nthing could not get up steam enough to start itself and in consequence\r\nMr. Baldwin and some of his machinists were obliged to give it a violent\r\npush whenever it set out and then leap aboard when it was under way in\r\norder to weigh it down and keep it on the track."\r\n\r\n"Imagine having to hold an engine down!" ejaculated Steve, with\r\namusement.\r\n\r\n"The story simply goes to prove how much in the making locomotives\r\nreally were," Mr. Tolman said. "And not only did this toy engine have to\r\nbe started by a friendly push, but it was too feeble to generate steam\r\nfast enough to keep itself going after it was once on its way. Therefore\r\nevery now and then the power would give out and Mr. Baldwin and his men\r\nwould be forced to get out and run along beside the train, pushing it as\r\nthey went that it might keep up its momentum until a supply of steam\r\ncould again be acquired. Can you ask for anything more primitive than\r\nthat?"\r\n\r\n"It certainly makes one realize the progress locomotive builders have\r\nmade," the boy replied, with gravity.\r\n\r\n"It certainly does," agreed his father. "Think how Baldwin and his men\r\nmust have struggled first with one difficulty and then with another;\r\nthink how they must have experimented and worked to perfect the tiny\r\nengine with which they began! It was the conquering of this multitude of\r\ndefects that gave to the world the intricate, exquisitely made machine\r\nwhich at this very minute is pulling you and me into New York."\r\n\r\nThere was an interval of silence during which Stephen glanced out at the\r\nflying panorama framed by the window.\r\n\r\n"Where was New England all this time?" demanded he, with jealous\r\nconcern. "Didn\'t Massachusetts do anything except build the old granite\r\nroad at Quincy?"\r\n\r\n"Railroads, for various reasons, were not popular in Massachusetts,"\r\nreturned his father. "As usual New England was conservative and was\r\ntherefore slow in waking up to the importance of steam transportation.\r\nBoston was on the coast, you see, and had its ships as well as the canal\r\nboats that connected the city with the manufacturing districts of the\r\nMerrimac. Therefore, although the question of building railroads was\r\nagitated in 1819 nothing was done about the matter. As was natural the\r\ncanal company opposed the venture, and there was little enthusiasm\r\nelsewhere concerning a project that demanded a great outlay of money\r\nwith only scant guarantee that any of it would ever come back to the\r\ncapitalists who advanced it. Moreover, the public in general was\r\nsceptical about railroads or else totally uninterested in them. And even\r\nhad a railroad been built at this time it would not have been a steam\r\nroad for it was proposed to propel the cars by horse power just as those\r\nat Quincy had been."\r\n\r\n"Oh!" interjected Steve scornfully. "They might at least have tried\r\nsteam."\r\n\r\n"People had little faith in it," explained Mr. Tolman. "Those who had\r\nthe faith lacked the money to back the enterprise, and those who had the\r\nmoney lacked the faith. If a company could have gone ahead and built a\r\nsteam railroad that was an unquestioned success many persons would\r\nundoubtedly have been convinced of its value and been willing to put\r\ncapital into it; but as matters stood, there was so much antagonism\r\nagainst the undertaking that nobody cared to launch the venture. There\r\nwere many business men who honestly regarded a steam railroad as a\r\nmenace to property and so strong was this feeling that in 1824 the town\r\nof Dorchester, a village situated a short distance from Boston, actually\r\ntook legal measures to prevent any railroad from passing through its\r\nterritory."\r\n\r\n"They needn\'t have been so fussed," said Stephen, with a grin.\r\n"Railroads weren\'t plenty enough to worry them!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, the Quincy road was not the only railroad in Massachusetts," his\r\nfather asserted quickly, "for in spite of opposition a railroad to\r\nLowell, modeled to some extent after the old granite road, had been\r\nbuilt. This railroad was constructed on stone ties, as the one at Quincy\r\nhad been; for although such construction was much more costly it was\r\nthought at the time to be far more durable. Several years afterward,\r\nwhen experience had demonstrated that wood possessed more _give_, and\r\nthat a hard, unyielding roadbed only creates jar, the granite ties that\r\nhad cost so much were taken up and replaced by wooden ones."\r\n\r\n"What a shame!"\r\n\r\n"Thus do we live and learn," said his father whimsically. "Our blunders\r\nare often very expensive. The only redeeming thing about them is that we\r\npass our experience on to others and save them from tumbling into the\r\nsame pit. Thus it was with the early railroad builders. When the Boston\r\nand Providence Road was constructed this mistake was not repeated and a\r\nflexible wooden roadbed was laid. In the meantime a short steam\r\nrailroad line had been built from Boston to Newton, a distance of seven\r\nmiles, and gradually the road to this suburb was lengthened until it\r\nextended first to Natick and afterward to Worcester, a span of\r\nforty-four miles. Over this road, during fine weather, three trains ran\r\ndaily; in winter there were but two. I presume nothing simpler or less\r\npretentious could have been found than this early railroad whose trains\r\nwere started at the ringing of a bell hung on a near-by tree. Although\r\nit took three hours to make a trip now made in one, the journey was\r\nconsidered very speedy, and unquestionably it was if travelers had to\r\ncover the distance by stagecoach. When we consider that in 1834 it took\r\nfreight the best part of a week to get to Boston by wagons a three-hour\r\ntrip becomes a miracle."\r\n\r\n"I suppose there was not so much freight in those days anyway," Steve\r\nspeculated.\r\n\r\n"Fortunately not. People had less money and less leisure to travel, and\r\ntherefore there were not so many trunks to be carried; I am not sure,\r\ntoo, but the frugal Americans of that day had fewer clothes to take with\r\nthem when they did go. Then, as each town or district was of necessity\r\nmore or less isolated, people knew fewer persons outside of their own\r\ncommunities, did a less extensive business, and had less incentive to go\r\na-visiting. Therefore, although the Boston and Worcester Railroad could\r\nboast only two baggage cars (or burthen cars, as they were called), the\r\nsupply was sufficient, which was fortunate, especially since the\r\nfreight house in Boston was only large enough to shelter these two."\r\n\r\n"And out of all this grew the Boston and Albany Railroad?" questioned\r\nthe boy.\r\n\r\n"Yes, although it was not until 1841, about eight years later, that the\r\nline was extended to New York State. By that time tracks had been laid\r\nthrough the Berkshire hills, opening up the western part of\r\nMassachusetts. The story of that first momentous fifteen-hour journey of\r\nthe Boston officials to the New York capital, where they were welcomed\r\nand entertained by the Albany dignitaries, is picturesque reading\r\nindeed. One of the party who set out from Boston on that memorable day\r\ncarried with him some spermaceti candles which on the delegates\' arrival\r\nwere burned with great ceremony at the evening dinner."\r\n\r\n"I suppose it seemed a wonderful thing to reach Albany in fifteen\r\nhours," remarked Steve.\r\n\r\n"It was like a fairy tale," his father answered. "To estimate the marvel\r\nto the full you must think how long it would have taken to drive the\r\ndistance, or make the journey by water. Therefore the Boston officials\r\nburned their spermaceti candles in triumph; and the next day, when the\r\nAlbany hosts returned to Boston with their guests, they symbolized the\r\nonrush of the world\'s progress by bringing with them a barrel of flour\r\nwhich had been cut, threshed, and ground only two days before, and put\r\ninto a wooden barrel made from a tree which was cut down, sawed, and\r\nput together while the flour was being ground. This does not seem to us\r\nanything very astounding but it was a feat to stop the breath in those\r\ndays."\r\n\r\n"And what did they do with the flour?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, that evening when they reached Boston the flour was made into some\r\nsort of bread which was served at the dinner the Boston men gave to\r\ntheir visitors."\r\n\r\n"I wonder what they would have said if somebody had told them then that\r\nsometime people would be going from Boston to New York in five hours?"\r\nthe lad observed.\r\n\r\n"I presume they would not have believed it," was the reply. "Nor would\r\nthey have been able to credit tales of the great numbers of persons who\r\nwould constantly be traveling between these two great cities. At that\r\ntime so few people made the trip that it was very easy to keep track of\r\nthem; and that they might be identified in case of accident the company\r\nretained a list of those who went on the trains. At first this rule\r\nworked very well, the passengers being carefully tabulated, together\r\nwith their place of residence; but later, when traffic began to increase\r\nand employees began to have more to do, those whose duty it was to make\r\nout these lists became hurried and careless and in the old railroad\r\nannals we read such entries as these:\r\n\r\n"\'_Woman in green bonnet; boy; stranger; man with side whiskers,_\'\r\netc."\r\n\r\nA peal of laughter broke from Stephen.\r\n\r\n"Railroad officials would have some job to list passengers now, wouldn\'t\r\nthey?" he said. "We should all just have to wear identification tags as\r\nthe men did during the War."\r\n\r\nHis father acquiesced whimsically.\r\n\r\n"I have sometimes feared we might have to come to that, anyway," he\r\nreplied. "With the sky populated with aeroplanes and the streets filled\r\nwith automobiles man stands little chance in these days of preserving\r\neither his supremacy or his identity. When we get on Fifth Avenue to-day\r\nyou see if you do not agree with me," he added, as the train pulled into\r\nthe big station.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nNEW YORK AND WHAT HAPPENED THERE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt took no very long interval to prove that there was some foundation\r\nfor Mr. Tolman\'s last assertion, for within a short time the travelers\r\nwere standing on Fifth Avenue amid the rush of traffic, and feeling of\r\nas little importance as dwarfs in a giant\'s country. The roar of the\r\nmighty city, its bustle and confusion, were both exhilarating and\r\nterrifying. They had left their luggage at the hotel and now, while\r\nSteve\'s father went to meet a business appointment, the boy was to take\r\na ride up the Avenue on one of the busses, a diversion of which he never\r\ntired. To sit on top and look down on the throng in the streets was\r\nalways novel and entertaining to one who passed his days in a quiet New\r\nEngland town. Therefore he stopped one of the moving vehicles and in\r\ngreat good humor bade his father good-by; and feeling very\r\nself-sufficient to be touring New York by himself, clambered eagerly up\r\nto a seat.\r\n\r\nThere were few passengers on the top of the coach for the chill of early\r\nmorning still lingered in the air; but before they reached Riverside\r\nDrive a man with a bright, ruddy countenance and iron-grey hair hailed\r\nthe bus and climbed up beside the boy. As he took his place he glanced\r\nat him kindly and instantly Steve felt a sense of friendliness toward\r\nthe stranger; and after they had ridden a short distance in silence the\r\nman spoke.\r\n\r\n"What a beautiful river the Hudson is!" he remarked. "Although I am an\r\nold New Yorker I never cease to delight in its charm and its fascinating\r\nhistory. It was on this body of water, you know, that the first\r\nsteamboat was tried out."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t know it," Stephen confessed, with an honest blush.\r\n\r\n"You will be learning about it some day, I fancy," said the other, with\r\na smile. "An interesting story it is, too. All the beginnings of our\r\ngreat industries and inventions read like romances."\r\n\r\n"My father has just been telling me about the beginnings of some of our\r\nrailroads," observed Steve shyly, "and certainly his stories were as\r\ngood as fairy tales."\r\n\r\n"Is your father especially interested in railroads?" inquired the New\r\nYorker.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir. He is in the railroad business."\r\n\r\n"Ah, then that accounts for his filling your ears with locomotives\r\ninstead of steamboats," declared the man, with a twinkle in his eyes.\r\n"Now if I were to spin a yarn for you, it would be of steamboats because\r\nthat happens to be the thing I am interested in; I believe their history\r\nto be one of the most alluring tales to which a boy could listen.\r\nSometime you get a person who knows the drama from start to finish to\r\nrelate to you the whole marvelous adventure of early steamboating, and\r\nyou see if it does not beat the railroad story all out."\r\n\r\nHe laughed a merry laugh in which Stephen joined.\r\n\r\n"I wish you would tell it to me yourself," suggested the lad.\r\n\r\nThe man turned with an expression of pleasure on his red-cheeked face.\r\n\r\n"I should like nothing better, my boy," he said quickly, "but you see it\r\nis a long story and I am getting out at the next corner. Sometime,\r\nhowever, we may meet again. Who knows? And if we do you shall hold me to\r\nmy promise to talk steamboats to you until you cry for mercy."\r\n\r\nBending down he took up a leather bag which he had placed between his\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n"I am leaving you here, sonny," he said. "I take it you are in New York\r\nfor a holiday."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, I am," returned Steve with surprise. "My father and I are\r\nstaying here just for a few days."\r\n\r\n"I hope you will have a jolly good time during your visit," the man\r\nsaid, rising.\r\n\r\nStephen murmured his thanks and watched the erect figure descend from\r\nthe coach and disappear into a side street. It was not until the New\r\nYorker was well out of sight and the omnibus on its way that his eye was\r\ncaught by the red bill book lying on the floor at his feet. None of the\r\nfew scattered passengers had noticed it and stooping, he picked it up\r\nand quietly slipped it into his pocket.\r\n\r\nWhat should he do with it?\r\n\r\nOf course he could hand it over to the driver of the bus and tell him he\r\nhad found it. But the man might not be honest and instead of turning it\r\nin to the company might keep it. There was little doubt in Steve\'s mind\r\nthat the pocketbook belonged to the stranger who had just vacated the\r\nplace and it was likely his address was inside it. If so, what a\r\npleasure it would be to return the lost article to its rightful owner\r\nhimself. By so doing he would not only be sure the pocketbook reached\r\nits destination but he might see the steamboat man again.\r\n\r\nHe longed to open the bill book and investigate its contents. What was\r\nin it, he wondered. Well, the top of a Fifth Avenue coach was no place\r\nto be looking through pocketbooks, there was no question about that. Let\r\nalone the fact that persons might be watching him, there was danger that\r\nin the fresh morning breeze something might take wing, sail down to the\r\nHudson, and never be seen again. Therefore he decided to curb his\r\nimpatience and wait until he reached a more favorable spot to examine\r\nhis suddenly acquired treasure. Accordingly he tucked the long red\r\nwallet farther down into the breast pocket of his ulster, and feeling\r\nassured that nothing could be done about it at present, gave himself up\r\nto the pleasure and excitement of the drive.\r\n\r\nIt was not until he had rejoined his father at the hotel and the two\r\nwere sitting at lunch in the great dining room that the thought of it\r\nagain flashed into his mind.\r\n\r\n"Gee, Dad!" he suddenly exclaimed, looking up from his plateful of fried\r\nchicken with fork suspended in mid-air. "I meant to tell you I found a\r\npocketbook in the bus this morning."\r\n\r\n"A pocketbook!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir. I think the man who had been sitting beside me must have\r\ndropped it when he stooped over to get his bag. At any rate it was lying\r\nthere after he got out."\r\n\r\n"What did you do with it?" Mr. Tolman inquired with no great warmth of\r\ninterest. "Gave it to the conductor, I suppose."\r\n\r\nThe boy shook his head.\r\n\r\n"No, I didn\'t," was the answer. "I was afraid he might not turn it in,\r\nand as I liked the man who lost it I wanted to be sure he got it, so I\r\nbrought it back with me."\r\n\r\n"And where is it now?" demanded Mr. Tolman, now all attention. "I hope\r\nyou were not so careless as to leave it upstairs in our room."\r\n\r\n"No. I didn\'t leave it in the room," returned the lad. "It is out in my\r\ncoat pocket. I meant to take it out and see what was in it; but so many\r\nthings happened that I forgot about it until this very minute."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean that you left it in your ulster pocket and let them hang\r\nit out there on the rack?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"You checked your coat and left it there?"\r\n\r\n"Why--yes," came the faltering reply.\r\n\r\nMr. Tolman was on his feet.\r\n\r\n"Wait here until I come back," he said in a sharp tone.\r\n\r\n"Where are you going?"\r\n\r\n"Give me your check quickly," went on his father, without heeding the\r\nquestion. "Hurry!"\r\n\r\nSteve fumbled in his jacket pocket.\r\n\r\n"Be quick, son, be quick!" commanded Mr. Tolman impatiently. "Don\'t you\r\nknow it is never safe to leave anything of value in your coat when you\r\nare staying at a large city hotel? Somebody may have taken the\r\npocketbook already."\r\n\r\nScarlet with consternation the lad produced the check.\r\n\r\n"If nothing has happened to that pocketbook you will be very fortunate,"\r\nasserted the man severely. "Stay here! I will be right back."\r\n\r\nWith beating heart the boy watched him thread his way between the tables\r\nand disappear from the dining room into the lobby.\r\n\r\nSuppose the bill book should be gone!\r\n\r\nWhat if there had been valuable papers in it, money--a great deal of\r\nmoney--and now through his carelessness it had all disappeared? How\r\nstupid he had been not to remember about it and give it to his father\r\nthe instant they had met! In fact, he would much better have taken a\r\nchance and handed it to the bus conductor than to have done the foolish\r\nthing he had. He had meant so well and blundered so grievously! How\r\noften his father had cautioned him to be careful of money when he was\r\ntraveling!\r\n\r\nTensely he sat in his chair and waited with miserable anxiety, his eyes\r\nfixed on the dining-room door. Then presently, to his great relief, he\r\nsaw his father returning.\r\n\r\n"Did you--" he began.\r\n\r\n"You will have to come yourself, Steve," said the elder man whose brow\r\nwas wrinkled into a frown of annoyance. "The maid who checked the coats\r\nis not there, and the one who is insists that the ulster is not mine,\r\nand in spite of the check will not allow me to search the pockets of\r\nit."\r\n\r\nStephen jumped up.\r\n\r\n"I suppose she is right, too," went on Mr. Tolman breathlessly, "but the\r\ndelay is very unfortunate."\r\n\r\nThey made their way into the corridor, where by this time an office\r\nclerk and another man had joined the maid who was in charge of the coat\r\nrack.\r\n\r\nStephen presented his check and without comment the woman handed him his\r\ncoat. With trembling hand he dived into the deep pocket and from it drew\r\nforth the red bill book which he gave to his father.\r\n\r\n"There it is, Dad, safe and sound!" he gasped.\r\n\r\nInstantly the clerk was in their path.\r\n\r\n"I beg pardon, sir," said he with deference, "but does that pocketbook\r\nbelong to you?"\r\n\r\nMr. Tolman wheeled about.\r\n\r\n"Eh--what did you say?" he inquired.\r\n\r\n"I asked, sir, if that pocketbook was your property?" repeated the\r\nclerk.\r\n\r\nMr. Tolman faced his inquisitor.\r\n\r\n"What business is that of yours?" he demanded curtly.\r\n\r\n"I am sorry, sir, to appear rude," the hotel employee replied, "but we\r\nhave been asked to be on the lookout for a young lad who rode this\r\nmorning on one of the Fifth Avenue busses where a valuable pocketbook\r\nwas lost. Your son tallies so well with the description that--"\r\n\r\n"It was I," put in Stephen eagerly, without regard for consequences.\r\n"Who wants me?"\r\n\r\nWith a smile of eagerness he turned, expecting to encounter the genial\r\nface of his acquaintance of the morning. Then he would smile, hold out\r\nthe pocketbook, and they would laugh together as he explained the\r\nadventure, and perhaps afterward have luncheon in company.\r\n\r\nInstead no familiar form greeted him. On the contrary the slender man\r\nwho had been standing beside the clerk came forward.\r\n\r\nMr. Tolman sensed the situation in a second.\r\n\r\n"You mean somebody thinks my son took the pocketbook?" asked he\r\nindignantly, as he confronted the clerk and his companion.\r\n\r\n"It is not my affair, sir, and I am sorry it should happen in our\r\nhotel," apologized the clerk. "Perhaps if you will just explain the\r\nwhole matter to this gentleman--" he broke off, saying in an undertone\r\nto the man at his elbow. "This is your boy, Donovan."\r\n\r\nThe tall man came nearer.\r\n\r\n"You are a detective?" asked Mr. Tolman bluntly.\r\n\r\n"Well, something of the sort, sir," admitted the man called Donovan. "It\r\nis occasionally my business to hunt people up."\r\n\r\n"And you have been sent to hunt my son up?"\r\n\r\nDonovan nodded.\r\n\r\nStephen turned white and his father put a reassuring hand on his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n"My son and I," he replied, addressing the detective quietly, "can\r\nexplain this entire affair to you and will do so gladly. The boy did\r\nfind the pocketbook but he was ignorant of its value because he has not\r\neven looked inside it. In fact, that he had the article in his\r\npossession did not come into his mind until a few moments ago. If he had\r\nknown the thing was valuable, do you suppose he would have left it in\r\nhis ulster pocket and checked the coat in a public place like this?"\r\n\r\nThe detective made no reply.\r\n\r\n"We both shall be very glad," went on Mr. Tolman firmly, "to go with you\r\nto headquarters and straighten the matter out."\r\n\r\n"There may be no need of that, sir," Donovan responded with a pleasant\r\nsmile. "If we can just talk the affair over in a satisfactory way--"\r\n\r\n"Suppose you come upstairs to our room," suggested Mr. Tolman. "That\r\nwill give us more quiet and privacy. Will that be agreeable to you?"\r\n\r\n"Perfectly."\r\n\r\nAs the three walked toward the elevator Steve glanced with trepidation\r\nat the plain-clothes man.\r\n\r\nThe boy knew he had done nothing wrong; but would he be able to convince\r\nthe detective of the truth of his story? He was thoroughly frightened\r\nand wondered whether his father was also alarmed.\r\n\r\nIf, however, Mr. Tolman was worried he at least did not show it. Instead\r\nhe courteously led the way from the elevator down the dim corridor and\r\nunlocked the door of Number 379.\r\n\r\n"Come in, Mr. Donovan," he said cordially. "Here is a chair and a cigar.\r\nNow, son, tell us the story of this troublesome pocketbook from\r\nbeginning to end."\r\n\r\nIn a trembling voice Stephen began his tale. He spoke slowly,\r\nuncertainly, for he was well scared. Gradually, however, he forgot his\r\nagitation and his voice became more positive. He recounted the details\r\nof the omnibus ride with great care, adding ingenuously when he came to\r\nthe termination of the narrative:\r\n\r\n"And I hoped the man\'s name would be inside the pocketbook because I\r\nliked him very much and wanted to return to him what he had lost."\r\n\r\n"And wasn\'t it?" put in Mr. Donovan quickly.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," was the innocent retort. "Don\'t you remember I told you\r\nthat I hadn\'t looked inside yet?"\r\n\r\nThe detective laughed with satisfaction.\r\n\r\n"That was a shabby trick of mine, youngster," said he. "It was mean to\r\ntry to trap you."\r\n\r\n"Trap me?" repeated Steve vaguely.\r\n\r\n"There, there, sonny!" went on Donovan kindly. "Don\'t you worry a minute\r\nmore about this mix-up. Mr. Ackerman, the gentleman who lost the bill\r\nbook, did not think for a second that you had taken it. He simply was so\r\nsure that he had lost it on the bus that he wanted to locate you and\r\nfind out whether you knew anything about it or not. His name was not\r\ninside the pocketbook, you see, and therefore any one who found it would\r\nhave no way of tracing its owner. What it contains are valuable papers\r\nand a big wad of Liberty Bonds which, as your father knows, could\r\nquickly be converted into cash. In consequence Mr. Ackerman decided that\r\nthe sooner the pocketbook was found the better. The omnibus people\r\ndenied any knowledge of it and you were the only remaining clue."\r\n\r\nMr. Tolman sank back in his chair and a relaxation of his muscles\r\nbetrayed for the first time that he had been much more disturbed than he\r\nhad appeared to be.\r\n\r\n"Well," he said, lighting a fresh cigar, "the bill book is not only\r\nlocated but we can hand it back intact to its owner. If you can inform\r\nus where the gentleman lives, my boy and I will call a taxi and go to\r\nhis house or office with his property."\r\n\r\nA flush of embarrassment suffused the face of the officer.\r\n\r\n"Maybe you would like to come with us, Donovan," added Mr. Tolman, who\r\ninstantly interpreted the man\'s confusion.\r\n\r\n"I hate to be dogging your footsteps, sir, in this fashion," Mr. Donovan\r\nanswered, with obvious sincerity. "Still, I--"\r\n\r\n"You have your orders, no doubt."\r\n\r\n"Well, yes, sir," admitted the plain-clothes man with reluctance. "I\r\nhave."\r\n\r\n"You were to keep your eye on us until the pocketbook reached its\r\nowner."\r\n\r\n"That\'s about it, sir. Not that I personally have the least suspicion\r\nthat a gentleman like you would--"\r\n\r\n"That is all right, my man. I perfectly understand your position," Mr.\r\nTolman cut in. "After all, you have your duty to do and business is\r\nbusiness. We\'ll just telephone Mr. Ackerman that we are coming so that\r\nwe shall be sure of catching him, and then we will go right up there."\r\n\r\n"Very well, sir."\r\n\r\nStephen\'s father started toward the telephone and then, as if struck by\r\na sudden thought, paused and turned.\r\n\r\n"Steve," he said, "I believe you are the person to communicate with Mr.\r\nAckerman. Call him up and tell him you have found his purse and that you\r\nand your father would like to come up to his house, if it will be\r\nconvenient, and return it."\r\n\r\n"All right, Dad."\r\n\r\n"You will find his number on this slip of paper, sonny," the detective\r\nadded, handing the lad a card. "He is not at his office. He went home to\r\nlunch in the hope that he had left the pocketbook there."\r\n\r\nAfter some delay Stephen succeeded in getting the number written on the\r\ncard. A servant answered the summons.\r\n\r\n"May I speak to Mr. Ackerman, please?" inquired the lad. "He is at\r\nluncheon? No, it would not do the least good for me to tell you my name\r\nfor he would not know who it was. Just tell him that the boy who sat\r\nbeside him this morning on the Fifth Avenue bus--" there was a little\r\nchuckle. "Oh, he will be here directly, will he? I thought perhaps he\r\nwould."\r\n\r\nA moment later a cheery voice which Steve at once recognized to be that\r\nof the steamboat man came over the wire:\r\n\r\n"Well, sonny?"\r\n\r\n"I found your bill book, Mr. Ackerman, and my father and I would like to\r\nbring it up to you."\r\n\r\n"Well, well! that is fine news!" cried the man at the other end of the\r\nline. "How did you know who it belonged to?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I--we--found out--my father and I," stammered the lad. "May we come\r\nup to your house with it now?"\r\n\r\n"You would much better let me come to you; then only one person will be\r\ninconvenienced," the New Yorker returned pleasantly. "Where are you\r\nstaying?"\r\n\r\n"At the Manhattan."\r\n\r\n"You must not think of taking the trouble of coming way up here. Let me\r\njoin you and your father at your hotel."\r\n\r\n"Very well, Mr. Ackerman. If you\'d rather--"\r\n\r\n"I certainly should rather!" was the emphatic answer. "I could not think\r\nof bringing two people so far out of their way."\r\n\r\n"There are three of us!" squeaked Stephen.\r\n\r\n"Three?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir. We have another person--a friend--with us," explained the\r\nboy, with quiet enjoyment. How easy it was to laugh now!\r\n\r\n"All the more reason why I should come to you, then," asserted Mr.\r\nAckerman. "I will be at the Manhattan within half an hour. Perhaps if\r\nyou and your father and your friend have the afternoon free you would\r\nlike to go to some sort of a show with me after we conclude our\r\nbusiness. Since you are here on a holiday you can\'t be very busy."\r\n\r\nStephen\'s eyes sparkled with merriment.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know whether our friend can go or not," he replied politely,\r\n"but I think perhaps Dad and I could; and if we can we should like to\r\nvery much."\r\n\r\n"That will be excellent. I will come right along. Not only shall I be\r\nglad to get my pocketbook back again but I shall be glad to see you once\r\nmore. I told you this morning that I had a feeling we should meet some\r\ntime. Whom shall I ask for at the hotel?"\r\n\r\n"Stephen Tolman."\r\n\r\nWith a click the boy hung up the receiver.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Ackerman is coming right down," said he, addressing his father and\r\nthe detective with a mischievous smile. "He has invited the three of us\r\nto go to the matinee with him."\r\n\r\n"The three of us!" echoed the plain-clothes man.\r\n\r\n"Yes," returned the lad. "I told him we had a friend with us and so he\r\nsaid to bring him along."\r\n\r\n"Good heavens!" Donovan ejaculated.\r\n\r\nMr. Tolman laughed heartily.\r\n\r\n"Not all the thieves you arrest take you to a theater party afterward,\r\ndo they, Officer?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"I said from the first you were gentlemen," Mr. Donovan asserted with\r\nhumor.\r\n\r\n"But couldn\'t you go?" inquired Steve, quite seriously.\r\n\r\n"Bless you, no, sonny!" replied the man. "I am from headquarters, you\r\nknow, and my work is chasing up crooks--not going to matinees."\r\n\r\nNevertheless there was an intonation of gentleness in his voice, as he\r\nadded, "I am obliged to you just the same, for in spite of my calling I\r\nam a human being and I appreciate being treated like one."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nAN ASTOUNDING CALAMITY\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Ackerman was as good as his word, for within half an hour he\r\npresented himself at the hotel where he found Mr. Tolman, Mr. Donovan\r\nand Steve awaiting him in their pleasant upstairs room. As he joined\r\nthem his eye traveled inquiringly from one to another of the group and\r\nlingered with curiosity on the face of the detective. The next instant\r\nhe was holding out his hand to Stephen.\r\n\r\n"Well, my boy, I am glad to see you again," said he, a ring of\r\nheartiness in his voice.\r\n\r\n"And I am glad to see you, too, Mr. Ackerman," Steve replied, returning\r\nthe hand-clasp with fervor. "This is my father, sir; and this"--for a\r\nsecond he hesitated, then continued, "is our friend, Mr. Donovan."\r\n\r\nWith cordiality the New Yorker acknowledged the introductions.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Donovan," explained Mr. Tolman, scanning Mr. Ackerman\'s countenance\r\nwith a keen, half-quizzical expression, "is from headquarters."\r\n\r\nThe steamboat magnate started and shot a quick glance at those present.\r\nIt was plain he was disconcerted and uncertain as to how to proceed.\r\n\r\nMr. Donovan, however, came to his rescue, stepping tactfully into the\r\nbreach:\r\n\r\n"I was not needed for anything but to supply your address, sir; but I\r\nwas able to do that, so between us all we have contrived to return your\r\npocketbook to you as good as before it left your possession."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke Mr. Tolman drew forth the missing bill book and held it\r\ntoward its owner.\r\n\r\n"That looks pretty good to me!" Mr. Ackerman exclaimed, as he took the\r\narticle from Mr. Tolman\'s outstretched hand and regarded it\r\nreflectively. "I don\'t know when I have ever done anything so careless\r\nand stupid. You see I had got part way to the bank before I remembered\r\nthat I had left my glasses, on which I am absolutely dependent, at home.\r\nTherefore, there being no taxi in sight, I hailed a passing bus and\r\nclimbed up beside this youngster. How the bill book happened to slip out\r\nof my pocket I cannot explain. It seemed to me it would be safer to have\r\nthe securities upon my person than in a bag that might be snatched from\r\nme; but apparently my logic was at fault. I was, however, so certain of\r\nmy wisdom that I never thought to question it until I had reached the\r\nsidewalk and the bus had gone.\r\n\r\n"Your boy, Mr. Tolman, confided while we rode along this morning that he\r\nwas visiting in New York for a few days; but of course I did not ask his\r\nname or address and so when I wanted his help in tracing the missing\r\npocketbook I had no way of locating him beyond assuming that he must be\r\nstaying at one of the hotels. Therefore when the omnibus company could\r\nfurnish no clue, I got into touch with an agency whose business it is to\r\nhunt people up. If the pocketbook had been dropped on the bus I felt\r\nsure your boy, who was almost the only other person on top of the coach,\r\nwould know about it; if, on the other hand, it had been dropped in the\r\nstreet, my problem would be a different one. In either case the sooner I\r\nknew my course of action the better. I hope you will believe, Mr.\r\nTolman, that when I called in the aid of detectives I had no suspicions\r\nagainst your son\'s honesty."\r\n\r\nMr. Tolman waved the final remark aside good-humoredly.\r\n\r\n"We have not taken the affair as a personal matter at all," he declared.\r\n"We fully appreciate your difficulty in finding Stephen, for he was also\r\nup against the problem of finding you. New York is a rather large city\r\nanyway, and for two people who do not even know one another\'s names to\r\nget together is like hunting a needle in a haystack. Our only recourse\r\nto discovering the owner of the pocketbook would be through the\r\nadvertising columns of the papers and that is the method we should have\r\nfollowed had not Donovan appeared and saved us the trouble."\r\n\r\nHe exchanged a smile with the detective.\r\n\r\n"The advertising column was my one hope," Mr. Ackerman replied. "I felt\r\nsure that any honest person who picked up the purse would advertise it.\r\nIt was not the honest people I was worrying about. It was the thought\r\nthat I had dropped the bill book in the street where any\r\nTom-Dick-and-Harry could run away with it that concerned me. Moreover,\r\neven if your boy had found it on the bus, he might have turned it in to\r\nan employee of the coach line who was not honest enough to give it in\r\nturn to his superiors. So I wanted to know where I stood; and now that I\r\ndo I cannot tell you how grateful I am both to Stephen and to this\r\nofficer here for the service they have rendered me." Then, turning\r\ntoward Mr. Tolman, he added in an undertone, "I hope neither you nor\r\nyour son have suffered any annoyance through this unfortunate incident."\r\n\r\n"Not in the least," was the prompt response. "I confess we were a trifle\r\ndisconcerted at first; but Mr. Donovan has performed his duty with such\r\ncourtesy that we entertain toward him nothing but gratitude."\r\n\r\n"I am glad of that," Mr. Ackerman replied, "for I should deeply regret\r\nplacing either you or your boy, even for a moment, in an uncomfortable\r\nposition, or one where it might appear that I--"\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Tolman cut him short.\r\n\r\n"You took the quickest, most sensible course, Ackerman," said he. "Too\r\nmuch was at stake for you to risk delay. When a pocketbook filled with\r\nnegotiable securities disappears one must of necessity act with speed.\r\nNeither Stephen nor I cherish the least ill-will about the affair; do\r\nwe, son?"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed."\r\n\r\nThen smiling ingenuously up into the face of the New York man, he said:\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you want to look in your pocketbook and see if everything is all\r\nright, sir?"\r\n\r\nThe steamboat financier laughed.\r\n\r\n"You are a prudent young man," declared he. "No, I am quite willing to\r\nrisk that the property you have so kindly guarded is intact."\r\n\r\n"It ought to be," the boy said. "I haven\'t even opened the pocketbook."\r\n\r\n"A better proof still that everything is safe within it," chuckled Mr.\r\nAckerman. "No, sonny, I am not worrying. I should not worry even if you\r\nhad ransacked the bill book from one end to the other. I\'d take a chance\r\non the honesty of a boy like you."\r\n\r\nMr. Tolman, however, who had been listening, now came forward and broke\r\ninto the conversation:\r\n\r\n"Stephen\'s suggestion is a good, businesslike one, Ackerman," he\r\ndeclared. "As a mere matter of form--not as a slam against our morals--I\r\nam sure that both he and I would prefer that you examined your property\r\nwhile we are all here together and assure yourself that it is all\r\nright."\r\n\r\n"Pooh! Pooh! Nonsense!" objected the financier.\r\n\r\n"It is a wise notion, Mr. Ackerman," rejoined Mr. Donovan. "Business is\r\nbusiness. None of us questions the honor of Mr. Tolman or his son. They\r\nknow that. Nevertheless I am sure we should all feel better satisfied\r\nif you went through the formality of an investigation."\r\n\r\n"Very well, just as you say. But I want it understood that I do it at\r\ntheir and your request. I am perfectly satisfied to leave things as they\r\nare."\r\n\r\nTaking the now familiar red pocketbook from his coat he opened it\r\nunconcernedly; then the three persons watching him saw a look of\r\nconsternation banish the smile from his face.\r\n\r\n"What\'s wrong, Ackerman?" inquired the plain-clothes man quickly.\r\n\r\nWithout a word the other held the bill book toward him. It was empty.\r\nBonds, securities, money were gone! A gasp of incredulity came from\r\nStephen.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t open it--truly I didn\'t!" exclaimed he, in a terror-stricken\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Ackerman did not heed the remark.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid this looks pretty black for us, Ackerman," said Mr. Tolman\r\nslowly. "We have nothing to give you but the boy\'s word."\r\n\r\nMr. Donovan, however, who had been studying the group with a hawklike\r\nscrutiny now sprang to his feet and caught up his hat.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see how they dared put it over!" he exclaimed excitedly. "But\r\nthey almost got away with it. Even I was fooled."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean to insinuate," Mr. Tolman burst out, "that you think\r\nwe--"\r\n\r\n"Good heavens, no!" replied the detective with his hand on the door\r\nknob. "Don\'t go getting hot under the collar, Mr. Tolman. Nobody is\r\nslamming _you_. I have been pretty stupid about this affair, I\'m afraid;\r\nbut give me credit for recognizing honest people when I see them. No,\r\nsomebody has tricked you--tricked you all. But the game isn\'t up yet. If\r\nyou gentlemen will just wait here--"\r\n\r\nThe sentence was cut short by the banging of the door. The detective was\r\ngone. His departure was followed by an awkward silence.\r\n\r\nMr. Ackerman\'s face clouded into a frown of disappointment and anxiety;\r\nMr. Tolman paced the floor and puffed viciously at a cigar; and Steve,\r\nhis heart cold within him, looked from one to the other, chagrin,\r\nmortification and terror in his eyes.\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t open the pocketbook, Mr. Ackerman," he reiterated for the\r\ntwentieth time. "I truly didn\'t."\r\n\r\nBut the steamboat magnate was too deeply absorbed in his own thoughts\r\nand speculations to notice the high-pitched voice with its intonation of\r\ndistress.\r\n\r\nAt last Mr. Tolman could endure the situation no longer.\r\n\r\n"This is a most unfortunate happening, Ackerman," he burst out. "I am\r\nmore concerned about it than I can express. My boy and I are utter\r\nstrangers to you and we have no way of proving our honesty. All I can\r\nsay is that we are as much amazed at the turn affairs have taken as\r\nyourself, and we regret it with quite as much poignancy--perhaps more\r\nsince it reflects directly upon us. If there is anything we can do--"\r\n\r\nHe stopped, awaiting a reply from the other man, but none came.\r\n\r\n"Good heavens, Ackerman," he cried. "You don\'t mean to say you do not\r\nbelieve my son and me--that you suspect us of double-dealing!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what to believe, Tolman," owned Mr. Ackerman with candor.\r\n"I want very much to credit your story; in my heart, I do credit it. But\r\nhead and heart seem to be at variance in this matter. Frankly I am\r\npuzzled to know where the contents of that pocketbook have gone. Were\r\nthe things taken out before the bill book fell into your son\'s hands or\r\nafterward? And if afterward, who took them? Who had the chance? Donovan\r\nseems to think he has a clue, but I confess I have none."\r\n\r\n"Hadn\'t you looked over the bonds and stuff since you took them home?"\r\n\r\n"No," Mr. Ackerman admitted. "I got them from the broker yesterday and\r\nas it was too late to put them into the safe-deposit vault, I took them\r\nhome with me instead of putting them in our office safe as I should have\r\ndone. I thought it would be easier for me to stop at the bank with them\r\nthis morning on my way to business. It was foolish planning but I aimed\r\nto save time."\r\n\r\n"So the pocketbook was at your house over night?"\r\n\r\nMr. Ackerman nodded.\r\n\r\n"Yes," confessed he. "Nevertheless it did not go out of my possession.\r\nI had it in the inner pocket of my coat all the time."\r\n\r\n"You are sure no one took the things out while you were asleep last\r\nnight?"\r\n\r\n"Why--I--I don\'t see how they could," faltered Mr. Ackerman. "My\r\nservants are honest--at least, they always have been. I have had them\r\nfor years. Moreover, none of them knew I had valuable papers about me.\r\nHow could they?" was the reply.\r\n\r\nOnce more silence fell upon the room.\r\n\r\n"Come, Tolman," ejaculated the steamboat man presently, "you are a\r\nlevel-headed person. What is your theory?"\r\n\r\n"If I did not know my son and myself as well as I do," Mr. Tolman\r\nanswered with deliberation, "my theory would be precisely what I fancy\r\nyours is. I should reason that during the interval between the finding\r\nof the purse and its return the contents had been extracted."\r\n\r\nHe saw the New Yorker color.\r\n\r\n"That, I admit, is my logical theory," Mr. Ackerman owned with a blush,\r\n"but it is not my intuitive one. My brain tells me one thing and my\r\nheart another; and in spite of the fact that the arguments of my brain\r\nseem correct I find myself believing my heart and in consequence\r\ncherishing a groundless faith in you and your boy," concluded he, with a\r\nfaint smile.\r\n\r\n"That is certainly generous of you, Ackerman!" Mr. Tolman returned, much\r\nmoved by the other\'s confidence. "Stephen and I are in a very\r\ncompromising situation with nothing but your belief between us and a\r\ngreat deal of unpleasantness. We appreciate your attitude of mind more\r\nthan we can express. The only other explanation I can offer, and in the\r\nface of the difficulties it would involve it hardly seems a possible\r\none, is that while the coat was hanging in the lobby--"\r\n\r\nThere was a sound outside and a sharp knock at the door, and an instant\r\nlater Mr. Donovan entered, his face wreathed in smiles. Following him\r\nwas the woman who had checked the coats, a much frightened bell boy, and\r\na blue-uniformed policeman.\r\n\r\nThe woman was sobbing.\r\n\r\n"Indeed, sir," she wailed, approaching Steve, "I never meant to keep the\r\npocketbook and make trouble for you. I have a boy of my own at home, a\r\nlad about your age. What is to become of him now? Oh, dear; oh, dear!"\r\n\r\nShe burst into passionate weeping.\r\n\r\n"Now see here, my good woman, stop all this crying and talk quietly,"\r\ncut in the policeman in a curt but not unkind tone. "If you will tell us\r\nthe truth, perhaps we can help you. In any case we must know exactly\r\nwhat happened."\r\n\r\n"She must understand that anything she says can be used against her,"\r\ncautioned the detective, who in spite of his eagerness to solve the\r\nmystery was determined the culprit should have fair play.\r\n\r\n"Indeed, I don\'t care, sir," protested the maid, wiping her eyes on her\r\nridiculously small apron. "I can\'t be any worse off than I am now with a\r\npoliceman taking me to the lock-up. I\'ll tell the gentlemen the truth, I\r\nswear I will."\r\n\r\nWith a courtesy he habitually displayed toward all womanhood Mr. Tolman\r\ndrew forward a chair and she sank gratefully into it.\r\n\r\n"I spied the bill book in the young gentleman\'s pocket the minute he\r\ntook off his coat," began she in a low tone. "It was bright colored and\r\nas it was sticking part way out I couldn\'t help seeing it. Of course, I\r\nexpected he would take it with him into the dining room but when he\r\ndidn\'t I came to the conclusion that there couldn\'t be anything of value\r\nin it. But by and by I had more coats to hang up and one of them, a big,\r\nheavy, fur-lined one, brushed against the young gentleman\'s ulster and\r\nknocked the pocketbook out on to the floor so that it lay open under the\r\ncoat rack. It was then that I saw it was stuffed full of papers and\r\nthings."\r\n\r\nShe stopped a moment to catch her breath and then went resolutely on:\r\n\r\n"It seemed to me it was no sort of a plan to put the wallet back into\r\nthe lad\'s pocket, for when I wasn\'t looking somebody might take it. So I\r\ndecided I much better keep it safe for him, and maybe," she owned with a\r\nblush, "get a good-sized tip for doing it. I have a big pocket in my\r\nunderskirt where I carry my own money and I slipped it right in there,\r\nmeaning to hand it to the young man when he came out from lunch."\r\n\r\nThe corners of her mouth twitched and her tears began to fall again, but\r\nshe wiped them away with her apron and proceeded steadily:\r\n\r\n"But nothing turned out as I planned, for no sooner was the bill book in\r\nmy pocket than I was called away to help about the wraps at a lady\'s\r\nluncheon upstairs. There were so many people about the hall that I had\r\nno chance to restore the bill book to the lad\'s pocket without some one\r\nseeing me and thinking, perhaps, that I was stealing. There was no help\r\nbut to take it with me, trusting they would not keep me long upstairs\r\nand that I would get back to my regular place before the young gentleman\r\ncame out of the dining room. It was when I got out of the elevator in\r\nthe upper hall that I spied Dick, one of the bell boys I knew, and I\r\ncalled to him; and after explaining that I couldn\'t get away to go\r\ndownstairs I asked him to take the wallet and put it in 47\'s pocket.\r\nHe\'s a good-natured little chap and always ready to do an errand, and\r\nmore than that he\'s an honest boy. So I felt quite safe and went to\r\nwork, supposing the young man had his pocketbook long ago."\r\n\r\nAll eyes were turned upon the unlucky bell boy who hung his head and\r\ncolored uncomfortably.\r\n\r\n"So it was the boy who took the contents of the pocketbook!" was Mr.\r\nAckerman\'s comment.\r\n\r\n"Speak up, boy," commanded the officer. "The gentleman is talking to\r\nyou." The lad looked up with a frightened start.\r\n\r\nHe might have been sixteen years of age but he did not look it for he\r\nwas pale and underfed; nor was there anything in his bearing to indicate\r\nthe poise and maturity of one who was master of the occasion. On the\r\ncontrary, he was simply a boy who was frankly distressed and frightened,\r\nand as unfeignedly helpless in the present emergency as if he had been\r\nsix years old and been caught stealing jam from the pantry shelf. It did\r\nnot take more than a glance to convince the onlookers that he was no\r\nhardened criminal. If he had done wrong it had been the result either of\r\nimpulse or mischief, and the dire result of his deed was a thing he had\r\nbeen too unsophisticated to foresee. The plight in which he now found\r\nhimself plainly amazed and overwhelmed him and he looked pleadingly at\r\nhis captors.\r\n\r\n"Well, my boy, what have you to say for yourself?" repeated Mr. Ackerman\r\nmore gently.\r\n\r\n"Nothin\'."\r\n\r\n"Nothing?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir."\r\n\r\n"You did take the things out of the pocketbook then."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"But you are not a boy accustomed to taking what does not belong to\r\nyou."\r\n\r\nThe culprit shot a glance of gratitude toward the speaker but made no\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n"How did you happen to do it this time?" persisted Mr. Ackerman kindly.\r\n"Come, tell me all about it."\r\n\r\nPerhaps it was the ring of sympathy in the elder man\'s voice that won\r\nthe boy\'s heart. Whatever the charm, it conquered; and he met the eyes\r\nthat scanned his countenance with a timid smile.\r\n\r\n"I wanted to see what was in the pocketbook," said he with na\xc3\xafve\r\nhonesty, "and so I took the things out to look at them. I wasn\'t goin\'\r\nto keep \'em. I dodged into one of the little alcoves in the hall and had\r\njust pulled the papers out when I heard somebody comin\'. So I crammed\r\nthe whole wad of stuff into my pocket, waiting for a time when I could\r\nlook it over and put it back. But I got held up just like Mrs. Nolan\r\ndid," he pointed toward the woman in the chair. "Some man was sick and\r\nthe clerk sent me to get a bottle of medicine the minute I got\r\ndownstairs, and all I had the chance to do was to stick the empty wallet\r\nin 47\'s pocket and beat it for the drug store. I thought there would be\r\nletters or something among the papers that would give the name of the\r\nman they belonged to, and I\'d take \'em to the clerk at the desk an\' say\r\nI found \'em. But no sooner had I got the medicine up to room Number 792\r\nthan the policeman nabbed me with the papers an\' things on me. That\'s\r\nall there is to it, sir."\r\n\r\n"Have you the things now?" the officer put in quickly.\r\n\r\n"Sure! Didn\'t I just tell you I hadn\'t had the chance to hand \'em over\r\nto the clerk," the boy reiterated, pulling a wad of crumpled Liberty\r\nBonds and documents out of his pocket, and tumbling them upon the table.\r\n\r\nThere was no doubting the lad\'s story. Truth spoke in every line of his\r\nface and in the frankness with which he met the scrutiny of those who\r\nlistened to him. If one had questioned his uprightness the facts bore\r\nout his statements, for once out of the hotel on an errand he might\r\neasily have taken to his heels and never returned; or he might have\r\ndisposed of his booty during his absence. But he had done neither. He\r\nhad gone to the drug store and come back with every intention of making\r\nrestitution for the result of his curiosity. That was perfectly evident.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry, sir," he declared, when no one spoke. "I know I shouldn\'t\r\nhave looked in the pocketbook or touched the papers; but I meant no\r\nharm--honest I didn\'t."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be bound of that, sir," the woman interrupted. "Dick was ever a\r\nlad to be trusted. The hotel people will tell you that. He\'s been here\r\nseveral years and there\'s never been a thing against him. I blame myself\r\nfor getting him into this trouble, for without meaning to I put\r\ntemptation in his way. I know that what he\'s told you is the living\r\ntruth, and I pray you\'ll try and believe him and let him go. If harm was\r\nto come to the lad through me I\'d never forgive myself. Let the boy go\r\nfree and put the blame on me, if you must arrest somebody. I\'m older and\r\nit doesn\'t so much matter; but it\'s terrible to start a child of his\r\nage in as a criminal. The name will follow him through life. He\'ll\r\nnever get rid of it and have a fair chance. Punish me but let the little\r\nchap go, I beg of you," pleaded the woman, with streaming eyes.\r\n\r\nMr. Ackerman cleared his throat; it was plain that the simple eloquence\r\nof the request had touched him deeply.\r\n\r\n"With your permission, officer, I am going to withdraw my charge," he\r\nsaid, with a tremor in his voice. "You are to let both these persons go\r\nscot free. You, my good woman, meant well but acted foolishly. As for\r\nthe boy, Donovan, I will assume the responsibility for him."\r\n\r\n"You are willing to stand behind him, Mr. Ackerman?"\r\n\r\n"I am."\r\n\r\nThe detective turned toward the boy who had risen and was fumbling\r\nawkwardly with the brass buttons adorning his uniform.\r\n\r\n"You hear, Dick Martin, what the gentleman says," began he impressively.\r\n"He believes you are a good boy, and as you have handed back the\r\nvaluables in your possession he is going to take a chance on you and let\r\nyou go."\r\n\r\nA wave of crimson swept over the face of the boy and for the first time\r\nthe tension in the youthful countenance relaxed.\r\n\r\n"But Mr. Ackerman," Donovan continued, "expects you are going to behave\r\nyourself in future and never do such a thing again."\r\n\r\n"I am going to see your father, Dick," broke in Mr. Ackerman\'s kindly\r\nvoice, "and talk with him and--"\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t any father," declared the lad.\r\n\r\n"Your mother then."\r\n\r\n"I\'ve no mother either."\r\n\r\n"Who do you live with?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Aronson."\r\n\r\n"Is he a relative?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, no, sir! I haven\'t any relatives. There\'s nobody belongin\' to me.\r\nMr. Aronson is the tailor downstairs where I sleep. When I ain\'t working\r\nhere I do errands for him and he lets me have a cot in a room with four\r\nother boys--newsboys, bell hops and the like. We pay two dollars between\r\nus for the room and sometimes when I carry a lot of boxes round for Mr.\r\nAronson he gives me my breakfast."\r\n\r\n"Nobody else is responsible for you?"\r\n\r\n"Nop!" returned the boy with emphasis. "No, sir, I mean."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll attend to all this, Donovan," murmured Mr. Ackerman in an\r\nundertone to the detective. "The lad shall not remain there. I don\'t\r\nknow yet just what I\'ll do with him but I will plan something." Then\r\naddressing the lad, he continued, "In the meantime, Dick, you are to\r\nconsider me your relative. Later I shall hunt you up and we will get\r\nbetter acquainted. Be a good boy, for I expect some day you are going to\r\nmake me very proud of you."\r\n\r\n"What!"\r\n\r\nIn sheer astonishment the boy regarded his benefactor.\r\n\r\nThere was something very appealing in the little sharp-featured face\r\nwhich had now lost much of its pallor and softened into friendliness.\r\n\r\n"Why shouldn\'t you make me proud of you?" inquired Mr. Ackerman softly.\r\n"You can, you know, if you do what is right."\r\n\r\n"I\'m goin\' to try to, sir," burst out Dick with earnestness. "I\'m goin\'\r\nto try to with all my might."\r\n\r\n"That is all any one can ask of you, sonny," replied the steamboat\r\nmagnate. "Come, shake hands. Remember, I believe in you, and shall trust\r\nyou to live up to your word. The officer is going to let you go and none\r\nof us is going to mention what has happened. I will fix up everything\r\nfor you and Mrs. Nolan so you can both go back to your work without\r\ninterference. Now bid Mr. Tolman and his son good-by and run along.\r\nBefore I leave the hotel I will look you up and you can give me Mr.\r\nAronson\'s address."\r\n\r\nMaster Richard Martin needed no second bidding. Eager to be gone he\r\nawkwardly put out his hand, first to Mr. Tolman and then to Steve; and\r\nafterward, with a shy smile to the detective and the policeman and a\r\nboyish duck of his head, he shot into the hall and they heard him\r\nrushing pell-mell down the corridor. Mrs. Nolan, however, was more\r\nself-controlled. She curtsied elaborately to each of the men and called\r\ndown upon their heads every blessing that the sky could rain, and it was\r\nonly after her breath had become quite exhausted that she consented to\r\nretire from the room and in company with the policeman and the detective\r\nproceeded downstairs in the elevator.\r\n\r\n"Well, Tolman," began the New Yorker when they were at last alone, "you\r\nsee my heart was my best pilot. I put faith in it and it led me aright.\r\nUnfortunately it is now too late for the matinee but may I not renew my\r\ninvitation and ask you and your son to dine with me this evening and\r\nconclude our eventful day by going to the theater afterward?"\r\n\r\nMr. Tolman hesitated.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t refuse," pleaded the steamboat man. "Our acquaintance has, I\r\nconfess, had an unfortunate beginning; but a bad beginning makes for a\r\ngood ending, they say, and I feel sure the old adage will prove true in\r\nour case. Accept my invitation and let us try it out."\r\n\r\n"You are very kind," murmured Mr. Tolman vaguely, "but I--"\r\n\r\n"Help me to persuade your father to be generous, Stephen," interposed\r\nMr. Ackerman. "We must not let a miserable affair like this break up\r\nwhat might, perhaps, have been a delightful friendship."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t need any further persuading, Ackerman," Mr. Tolman spoke\r\nquickly. "I accept your invitation with great pleasure."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right!" cried Mr. Ackerman, with evident gratification.\r\n"Suppose you come to my house at seven o\'clock if that will be\r\nconvenient for you. We will have a pleasant evening together and forget\r\nlost pocketbooks, detectives and policemen."\r\n\r\nTaking out a small card, he hurriedly scrawled an address upon it.\r\n\r\n"I keep a sort of bachelor\'s hall out on Riverside Drive," explained he,\r\nwith a shade of wistfulness. "My butler looks out for me and sees that I\r\ndo not starve to death. He and his son are really excellent housekeepers\r\nand make me very comfortable." He slipped into his overcoat. "At seven,\r\nthen," he repeated. "Don\'t fail me for I should be much disappointed.\r\nGood-by!" and with a wave of his hand he departed, leaving Stephen and\r\nhis father to themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nAN EVENING OF ADVENTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nThat evening Steve and his father took a taxi-cab and drove to the\r\nnumber Mr. Ackerman had given them. It proved to be an imposing\r\napartment house of cream brick overlooking the Hudson; and the view from\r\nthe fifth floor, where their host lived, was such a fascinating one that\r\nthe boy could hardly be persuaded to leave the bay window that fronted\r\nthe shifting panorama before him.\r\n\r\n"So you like my moving picture, do you, Steve?" inquired the New Yorker\r\nmerrily.\r\n\r\n"It is great! If I lived here I shouldn\'t do a bit of studying," was the\r\nlad\'s answer.\r\n\r\n"You think the influence of the place bad, then."\r\n\r\n"It would be for me," Stephen chuckled.\r\n\r\nBoth Mr. Tolman and Mr. Ackerman laughed.\r\n\r\n"I will own," the latter confessed, "that at first those front windows\r\ndemoralized me not a little. They had the same lure for me as they have\r\nfor you. But by and by I gained the strength of mind to turn my back and\r\nlet the Hudson River traffic look out for itself."\r\n\r\n"You might try that remedy, son," suggested Steve\'s father.\r\n\r\n"No, no, Tolman! Let the boy alone. If he is enjoying the ferries and\r\nsteamboats so much the better."\r\n\r\n"But there seem to be plenty of steamboats here in the room to enjoy,"\r\nwas Mr. Tolman\'s quick retort.\r\n\r\n"Steamboats?" repeated Steve vaguely, turning and looking about him.\r\n\r\nSure enough, there were steamboats galore! Wherever he looked he saw\r\nthem. Not only were the walls covered with pictures of every imaginable\r\ntype of steamer, but wherever there was space enough there were tiers of\r\nlittle ship models in glass cases. There were side-wheelers, awkwardly\r\nconstructed boats with sprawling paddles, screw propellers, and\r\ntwin-screw craft; ferryboats, tugs, steam yachts, and ocean liners.\r\nEvery known variety of sea-going contrivance was represented. The large\r\nroom was like a museum of ships and the boy gave an involuntary\r\nexclamation of delight.\r\n\r\n"Jove!"\r\n\r\nIt was a laconic tribute to the marvels about him but it was uttered\r\nwith so much vehemence that there was no mistaking its sincerity.\r\nEvidently, terse as it was, its ring of fervor satisfied Mr. Ackerman\r\nfor he smiled to himself.\r\n\r\n"I never saw so many boats in all my life!" burst out Steve.\r\n\r\n"I told you I was in the steamboat business," put in Mr. Ackerman\r\nmischievously.\r\n\r\n"I should think you were!" was the lad\'s comment.\r\n\r\n"This is a wonderful collection, Ackerman," Mr. Tolman asserted, as he\r\nrose and began to walk about the room. "How did you ever get it\r\ntogether? Many of these prints are priceless."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I have been years doing it," Mr. Ackerman said. "It has been my\r\nhobby. I have chosen to sink my money in these toys instead of in an\r\nabandoned farm or antique furniture. It is just a matter of taste, you\r\nsee."\r\n\r\n"You must have done some scouring of the country to make your collection\r\nso complete. I don\'t see how you ever succeeded in finding these old\r\npictures and models. It is a genuine history lesson."\r\n\r\n"I do not deserve all the credit, by any means," the capitalist\r\nprotested with modesty. "My grandfather, who was one of the owners of\r\nthe first of the Hudson River steamers, began collecting pictures and\r\ndrawings; and at his death they came to my father who added to them.\r\nAfterward, when the collection descended to me, I tried to fill in the\r\ngaps in order to make the sequence complete. Of course in many cases I\r\nhave not been able to find what I wanted, for neither prints nor models\r\nof some of the ships I desired were to be had. Either there were no\r\ncopies of them in existence, or if there were no money could tempt their\r\nowners to part with them. Still I have a well enough graded lot to show\r\nthe progression."\r\n\r\n"I should think you had!" said Mr. Tolman heartily. "You have arranged\r\nthem beautifully, too, from the old whalers and early American coasting\r\nships to the clippers. Then come the first steam packets, I see, and\r\nthen the development of the steamboat through its successive steps up to\r\nour present-day floating palace. It tells its own story, doesn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"In certain fashion, yes," Mr. Ackerman agreed. "But the real romance of\r\nit will never be fully told, I suppose. What an era of progress through\r\nwhich to have lived!"\r\n\r\n"And shared in, as your family evidently did," interposed Mr. Tolman\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\nHis host nodded.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he answered, "I am quite proud to think that both my father and\r\nmy grandfather had their humble part in the story."\r\n\r\n"And well you may be. They were makers of history."\r\n\r\nBoth men were silent an instant, each occupied with his own thoughts.\r\n\r\nMr. Tolman moved reflectively toward the mantelpiece before which Steve\r\nwas standing, gazing intently at a significant quartette of tiny models\r\nunder glass. First came a ship of graceful outline, having a miniature\r\nfigurehead of an angel at its prow and every sail set. Beside this was\r\nan ungainly side-wheeler with scarce a line of beauty to commend it.\r\nNext in order came an exquisite, up-to-date ocean liner; and the last in\r\nthe group was a modern battleship with guns, wireless, and every detail\r\ncunningly reproduced.\r\n\r\nStephen stood speechless before them.\r\n\r\n"What are you thinking of, son?" his father asked.\r\n\r\n"Why, I--" the boy hesitated.\r\n\r\n"Come, tell us! I\'d like to know, too," echoed Mr. Ackerman.\r\n\r\n"Why, to be honest I was wondering how you happened to pick these\r\nparticular four for your mantel," replied the lad with confusion.\r\n\r\nThe steamboat man smiled kindly.\r\n\r\n"You think there are handsomer boats in the room than these, do you?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly there are better looking steamships than this one," Steve\r\nreturned, pointing with a shrug of his shoulders at the clumsy\r\nside-wheeler.\r\n\r\n"But that rather ugly craft is the most important one of the lot, my\r\nboy," Mr. Tolman declared.\r\n\r\n"I suppose that is true," Mr. Ackerman agreed. "The fate of all the\r\nothers hung on that ship."\r\n\r\n"Why?" was the boy\'s prompt question.\r\n\r\n"Oh, it is much too long a yarn to tell you now," laughed his host.\r\n"Were we to begin that tale we should not get to the theater to-night,\r\nsay nothing of having any dinner."\r\n\r\n"I\'d like to hear the story," persisted Stephen.\r\n\r\n"You will be reading it from a book some day."\r\n\r\n"I\'d rather hear you tell it."\r\n\r\n"If that isn\'t a spontaneous compliment, Ackerman, I don\'t know what\r\nis," laughed Mr. Tolman.\r\n\r\nThe steamboat man did not reply but he could not quite disguise his\r\npleasure, although he said a bit gruffly:\r\n\r\n"We shall have to leave the story and go to the show to-night. I\'ve\r\nbought the tickets and there is no escape," added he humorously. "But\r\nperhaps before you leave New York there will be some other chance for me\r\nto spin my yarn for you, and put your father\'s railroad romances\r\nentirely in the shade."\r\n\r\nThe butler announced dinner and they passed into the dining room.\r\n\r\nIf, however, Stephen thought that he was now to leave ships behind him\r\nhe was mistaken, for the dining room proved to be quite as much of a\r\nmuseum as the library had been. Against the dull blue paper hung\r\npictures of racing yachts, early American fighting ships, and nautical\r\nencounters on the high seas. The house was a veritable wonderland, and\r\nso distracted was the lad that he could scarcely eat.\r\n\r\n"Come, come, son," objected Mr. Tolman at last, "you will not be ready\r\nin time to go to any show unless you turn your attention to your\r\ndinner."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right," Mr. Ackerman said. "Fall to and eat your roast beef. We\r\nare none too early as it is."\r\n\r\nAccordingly Stephen fixed his eyes on his plate with resolution and\r\ntried his best to think no more of his alluring surroundings. With the\r\ncoming of the ice-cream he had almost forgotten there were such things\r\nas ships, and when he rose from the table he found himself quite as\r\neager to set forth to the theater as any other healthy-minded lad of his\r\nage would have been.\r\n\r\nThe "show" Mr. Ackerman had selected had been chosen with much care and\r\nwas one any boy would have delighted to see. The great stage had, for\r\nthe time being, been transformed to a western prairie and across it came\r\na group of canvas-covered wagons, or prairie schooners, such as were\r\nused in the early days by the first settlers of the West. Women and\r\nchildren were huddled beneath the arched canopy of coarse cloth and\r\ninside this shelter they passed the weary days and nights of travel.\r\nThrough sun and storm the wagons rumbled on; jogging across the rough,\r\nuncharted country and jolting over rocks, sagebrush, and sand. There\r\nwere streams to ford, mountains to climb on the long trip westward, but\r\nundaunted by obstacles the heroic little band of settlers who had with\r\nsuch determination left kin and comfort behind them passed on to that\r\nnew land toward which their faces were set.\r\n\r\nIt was such a company as this that Stephen now saw pictured before him.\r\nPerched on the front seat of the wagon driving the horses was the father\r\nof the family, rugged, alert, and of the woodsman type characteristic of\r\nthe New England pioneer. The cavalcade halted. A fire was built and the\r\ntravelers cooked their supper. Across the valley one could see the\r\nfading sunset deepen into twilight. From a little stream near-by the men\r\nbrought water for the tired horses. Then the women and children\r\nclambered into the "ship of the desert" and prepared for a night\'s rest.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the men lingered about the dying fire and one of them, a\r\ngun in his hand, paced back and forth as if on guard. Then suddenly he\r\nturned excitedly to his comrades with his finger on his lips. He had\r\nheard a sound, the sound they all dreaded,--the cry of an Indian.\r\n\r\nPresently over the crest of the hill came stealing a stealthy band of\r\nsavages. On they came, crouching against the rocks and moving forward\r\nwith the lithe, gliding motion of serpents. The men sank down behind the\r\nbrush, weapons in hand, and waited. On came the bloodthirsty Indians.\r\nThen, just when the destruction of the travelers seemed certain, onto\r\nthe stage galloped a company of cowboys. Immediately there was a\r\nflashing of rifles and a din of battle. First it seemed as if the heroic\r\nrescuers would surely be slaughtered. But they fought bravely and soon\r\nthe Indians were either killed or captured. Amid the confusion the\r\nowners of the prairie schooners leaped to the seats of their wagons,\r\nlashed forward their tired horses, and disappeared in safety with the\r\nterrified women and children.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the curtain fell upon this thrilling adventure that\r\nStephen sank back into his chair and drew a long breath.\r\n\r\n"Some show, eh, son?" said Mr. Tolman, as they put on their overcoats to\r\nleave the theater after the three long acts were over.\r\n\r\nThe boy looked up, his eyes wide with excitement.\r\n\r\n"I should say!" he managed to gasp.\r\n\r\n"Did you like it, sonny?" Mr. Ackerman inquired.\r\n\r\n"You bet I did!"\r\n\r\n"Think you would have preferred to cross the continent by wagon rather\r\nthan by train?"\r\n\r\nSteve hesitated.\r\n\r\n"I guess a train would have been good enough for me," he replied. "Was\r\nit really as bad as that before the railroads were built?"\r\n\r\n"Quite as bad, I\'m afraid," was his father\'s answer. "Sometimes it was\r\neven worse, for the unfortunate settlers did not always contrive to\r\nescape. It took courage to be a pioneer and travel the country in those\r\ndays. Undoubtedly there was much romance in the adventure but hand in\r\nhand with it went no little peril and discomfort. We owe a great deal to\r\nthe men who settled the West; and, I sometimes think, even more to the\r\ndauntless women."\r\n\r\nStephen did not reply. Very quietly he walked down the aisle between his\r\nfather and Mr. Ackerman, and when he gave his hand to the latter and\r\nsaid good-night he was still thoughtful. It was evident that the scenes\r\nhe had witnessed had made a profound impression on him and that he was\r\nstill immersed in the atmosphere of prairie schooners, lurking Indians,\r\nand desert hold-ups. Even when he reached the hotel he was too tense and\r\nbroad awake to go to bed.\r\n\r\n"I wish you\'d tell me, Dad, how the first railroad across the country\r\nwas built," he said. "I don\'t see how any track was ever laid through\r\nsuch a wilderness. Didn\'t the Indians attack the workmen? I should think\r\nthey would have."\r\n\r\nHis father placed a hand kindly on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n"To-morrow we\'ll talk trans-continental railroads, son, if by that time\r\nyou still wish to," said he. "But to-night we\'ll go to bed and think no\r\nmore about them. I am tired and am sure you must be."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not!" was the prompt retort.\r\n\r\n"I rather fancy you will discover you are after you have undressed,"\r\nsmiled his father. "At any rate we\'ll have to call off railroading for\r\nto-night, for if you are not sleepy, I am."\r\n\r\n"But you won\'t have time to tell me anything to-morrow," grumbled Steve,\r\nrising unwillingly from his chair. "You will be busy and forget all\r\nabout it and--"\r\n\r\n"I have nothing to do until eleven o\'clock," interrupted Mr. Tolman,\r\n"when I have a business meeting to attend. Up to that time I shall be\r\nfree. And as for forgetting it--well, you might possibly remind me if\r\nthe promise passes out of my mind."\r\n\r\nIn spite of himself the boy grinned.\r\n\r\n"You can bank on my reminding you all right!" he said, yawning.\r\n\r\n"Very well. Then it is a bargain. You do the reminding and I will do the\r\nstory-telling. Are you satisfied and ready to go to bed and to sleep\r\nnow?"\r\n\r\n"I guess so, yes."\r\n\r\n"Good-night then."\r\n\r\n"Good-night, Dad. I--I\'ve had a bully day."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE CROSSING OF THE COUNTRY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn spite of the many excitements crowded into his first day in New York\r\nStephen found that when his head actually touched the pillow sleep was\r\nnot long in coming and he awoke the next morning refreshed by a heavy\r\nand dreamless slumber. He was even dressed and ready for breakfast\r\nbefore his father and a-tiptoe to attack whatever program the day might\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nFortunately Mr. Tolman was of a sufficiently sympathetic nature to\r\nremember how he had felt when a boy, and with generous appreciation for\r\nthe lad\'s impatience he scrambled up and made himself ready for a\r\nbreakfast that was earlier, perhaps, than he would have preferred.\r\n\r\n"Well, son," said he, as they took their places in the large dining\r\nroom, "what is the prospect for to-day? Are you feeling fit for more\r\nadventures?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m primed for whatever comes," smiled the boy.\r\n\r\n"That\'s the proper spirit! Indians, bandits and cowboys did not haunt\r\nyour pillow then."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t stay awake to see."\r\n\r\n"You are a model traveler! Now we must plan something pleasant for you\r\nto do to-day. I am not sure that we can keep up the pace yesterday set\r\nus, for it was a pretty thrilling one. Robberies and arrests do not come\r\nevery day, to say nothing of flotillas of ships and Wild West shows.\r\nHowever, we will do the best we can not to let the day go stale by\r\ncontrast. But first I must dictate a few letters and glance over the\r\nmorning paper. This won\'t take me long and while I am doing it I would\r\nsuggest that you go into the writing room and send a letter to your\r\nmother. I will join you there in half an hour and we will do whatever\r\nyou like before I go to my meeting. How is that?"\r\n\r\n"Righto!"\r\n\r\nAccordingly, after breakfast was finished, Steve wandered off by himself\r\nin search of paper and ink, and so sumptuous did he find the writing\r\nappointments that he not only dashed off a letter to his mother\r\nrecounting some of the happenings of the previous day, but on\r\ndiscovering a rack of post cards he mailed to Jack Curtis, Tim Barclay,\r\nBud Taylor and some of the other boys patronizing messages informing\r\nthem that New York was "great" and he was _sorry they were not there_.\r\nIn fact, it seemed at the moment that all those unfortunate persons who\r\ncould not visit this magic city were to be profoundly pitied.\r\n\r\nIn the purchase of stamps for these egoistic missives the remainder of\r\nthe time passed, and before he realized the half-hour was gone, he saw\r\nhis father standing in the doorway.\r\n\r\n"I am going up to the room now to hunt up some cigars, Steve," announced\r\nthe elder man. "Do you want to come along or stay here?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll come with you, Dad," was the quick reply.\r\n\r\nThe elevator shot them to the ninth floor in no time and soon they were\r\nin their room looking down on the turmoil in the street below.\r\n\r\n"Some city, isn\'t it?" commented Mr. Tolman, turning away from the busy\r\nscene to rummage through his suit case.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a corker!"\r\n\r\n"I thought you would like to go out to the Zoo this morning while I am\r\nbusy. What do you say?"\r\n\r\n"That would be bully."\r\n\r\n"It is a simple trip which you can easily make alone. If you like, you\r\ncan start along now," Mr. Tolman suggested.\r\n\r\n"But you said last night that if I would hurry to bed, to-day you would\r\ntell me about the Western railroads," objected Stephen.\r\n\r\nHe saw his father\'s eyes twinkle.\r\n\r\n"You have a remarkable memory," replied he. "I recall now that I did say\r\nsomething of the sort. But surely you do not mean that you would prefer\r\nto remain here and talk railroads than to go to the Zoo."\r\n\r\n"I can go to the Zoo after you have gone out," maintained Steve,\r\nstanding his ground valiantly.\r\n\r\n"You are a merciless young beggar," grinned his father. "I plainly see\r\nthat like Shylock you are determined to have your pound of flesh. Well,\r\nsit down. We will talk while I smoke."\r\n\r\nAs the boy settled contentedly into one of the comfortable\r\nchintz-covered chairs, Mr. Tolman blew a series of delicate rings of\r\nsmoke toward the ceiling and wrinkled his brow thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n"You got a pretty good idea at the theater last night what America was\r\nbefore we had trans-continental railroads," began he slowly. "You know\r\nenough of geography too, I hope, to imagine to some extent what it must\r\nhave meant to hew a path across such an immense country as ours; lay a\r\nroadbed with its wooden ties; and transport all this material as well as\r\nthe heavy rails necessary for the project. We all think we can picture\r\nto ourselves the enormity of the undertaking; but actually we have\r\nalmost no conception of the difficulties such a mammoth work\r\nrepresented."\r\n\r\nHe paused, half closing his eyes amid the cloud of smoke.\r\n\r\n"To begin with, the promoters of the enterprise received scant\r\nencouragement to attack the problem, for few persons of that day had\r\nmuch faith in the undertaking. In place of help, ridicule cropped up\r\nfrom many sources. It was absurd, the public said, to expect such a\r\nwild-cat scheme to succeed. Why, over six hundred miles of the area to\r\nbe covered did not contain a tree and in consequence there would be\r\nnothing from which to make cross-ties. And where was the workmen\'s food\r\nto come from if they were plunged into a wilderness beyond the reach of\r\ncivilization? The thing couldn\'t be done. It was impossible. Of course\r\nit was a wonderful idea. But it never could be carried out. Where were\r\nthe men to be found who would be willing to take their lives in their\r\nhands and set forth to work where Indians or wild beasts were liable to\r\ndevour them at any moment? Moreover, to build a railroad of such length\r\nwould take a lifetime and where was the money coming from? For you must\r\nremember that the men of that period had no such vast fortunes as many\r\nof them have now, and it was no easy task to finance a scheme where the\r\noutlay was so tremendous and the probability of success so shadowy. Even\r\nas late as 1856 the whole notion was considered visionary by the greater\r\npart of the populace."\r\n\r\n"But the fun of doing it, Dad!" ejaculated Stephen, with sparkling eyes.\r\n\r\n"The fun of it!" repeated his father with a shrug. "Yes, there was fun\r\nin the adventure, there is no denying that; and fortunately for the\r\ndreamers who saw the vision, men were found who felt precisely as you\r\ndo. Youth always puts romance above danger, and had there not been these\r\nromance lovers it would have gone hard with the trans-continental\r\nrailroads. We might never have had them. As it was, even the men who\r\nventured to cast in their lot with the promoters had the caution to\r\ndemand their pay in advance. They had no mind to be deluded into working\r\nfor a precarious wage. At length enough toilers from the east and from\r\nthe west were found who were willing to take a chance with their\r\nphysical safety, and the enterprise was begun."\r\n\r\nStephen straightened up in his chair.\r\n\r\n"Had the only obstacle confronting them been the reach of uncharted\r\ncountry ahead that would have been discouraging enough. Fancy pushing\r\nyour way through eight hundred miles of territory that had never been\r\ntouched by civilization! And while you are imagining that, do not forget\r\nthat the slender ribbon of track left behind was your only link with\r\nhome; and your only hope of getting food, materials, and sometimes\r\nwater. Ah, you would have had excitement enough to satisfy you had you\r\nbeen one of that company of workmen! On improvised trucks they put up\r\nbunks and here they took turns in sleeping while some of their party\r\nstood guard to warn them of night raids from Indians and wild beasts.\r\nEven in the daytime outposts had to be stationed; and more than once, in\r\nspite of every precaution, savages descended on the little groups of\r\nbuilders, overpowered them, and slaughtered many of the number or\r\ncarried away their provisions and left them to starve. Sometimes\r\nmarauders tore up the tracks, thereby breaking the connection with the\r\ncamps in the rear from which aid could be summoned; and in early\r\nrailroad literature we find many a tale of heroic engineers who ran\r\ntheir locomotives back through almost certain destruction in order to\r\nprocure help for their comrades. Supply trains were held up and swept\r\nclean of their stores; paymasters were robbed, and sometimes murdered,\r\nso no money reached the employees; every sort of calamity befell the\r\nmen. Hundreds of the ten thousand Chinese imported to work at a\r\nmicroscopic wage died of sickness or exposure to the extreme heat or\r\ncold."\r\n\r\n"Gee!" gasped Stephen, "I\'d no idea it was so bad as all that!"\r\n\r\n"Most persons have but a faint conception of the price paid for our\r\nrailways--paid not alone in money but in human life," answered Mr.\r\nTolman. "The route of the western railroads, you see, did not lie solely\r\nthrough flat, thickly wooded country. Our great land, you must remember,\r\nis made up of a variety of natural formations, and in crossing from the\r\nAtlantic coast to that of the Pacific we get them one after another. In\r\ncontrast to the forests of mighty trees, with their tangled undergrowth,\r\nthere were stretches of prairie where no hills broke the level ground;\r\nanother region contained miles and miles of alkali desert, dry and\r\nscorching, where the sun blazed so fiercely down on the steel rails that\r\nthey became too hot to touch. Here men died of sunstroke and of fever;\r\nand some died for want of water. Then directly in the railroad\'s path\r\narose the towering peaks of the Sierras and Rockies whose snowy crests\r\nmust be crossed, and whose cold, storms and gales must be endured.\r\nBattling with these hardships the workmen were forced to drill holes in\r\nthe rocky summits and bolt their rough huts down to the earth to\r\nprevent them from being blown away."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see how the thing could have been done!" Steve exclaimed, with\r\ngrowing wonder.\r\n\r\n"And you must not forget to add to the chapter of tribulations the\r\nrivers that barred the way; the ravines that must either be filled in or\r\nbridged; the rocks that had to be blasted out; and the mountains that\r\nmust be climbed or tunneled."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see how they ever turned the trick!" the boy repeated.\r\n\r\n"It is the same old tale of progress," mused his father. "Over and over\r\nagain, since time began, men have given their lives that the world might\r\nmove forward and you and I enjoy the benefits of civilization. Remember\r\nit and be grateful to the past and to that vast army of toilers who\r\noffered up their all that you might, without effort, profit by the\r\nthings it took their blood to procure. There is scarcely a comfort you\r\nhave about you that has not cost myriad men labor, weariness, and\r\nperhaps life itself. Therefore value highly your heritage and treat the\r\nfruits of all hard work with respect; and whenever you can fit your own\r\nsmall stone into the structure, or advance any good thing that shall\r\nsmooth the path of those who are to follow you, do it as your sacred\r\nduty to those who have so unselfishly builded for you."\r\n\r\nThere was a moment of silence and the rumble of the busy street rose to\r\ntheir ears.\r\n\r\n"I never shall build anything that will help the men of the future,"\r\nobserved Stephen, in a low tone.\r\n\r\n"Every human being is building all the time," replied his father. "He is\r\nbuilding a strong body that shall mean a better race; a clean mind that\r\nshall mean a purer race; a loyalty to country that will result in finer\r\ncitizenship; and a life of service to his fellows that will bring in\r\ntime a broader Christianity. Will not the world be the better for all\r\nthese things? It lies with us to carry forward the good and lessen the\r\nevil of the universe, or tear down the splendid ideals for which our\r\nfathers struggled and retard the upward march of the universe. If\r\neverybody put his shoulder to the wheel and helped the forward spin of\r\nour old world, how quickly it would become a better place!"\r\n\r\nAs he concluded his remarks Mr. Tolman took out his watch.\r\n\r\n"Well, well!" said he. "I had no idea it was so late. I must hurry or I\r\nshall not finish my story."\r\n\r\n"As I told you the men from the east and those from the west worked\r\ntoward each other from opposite ends of the country. As soon as short\r\nlengths of track were finished they were joined together. Near the great\r\nSalt Lake of Utah a tie of polished laurel wood banded with silver\r\nmarked the successful crossing of Utah\'s territory. Five years later\r\nNevada contributed some large silver spikes to join her length of track\r\nto the rest. California sent spikes of solid gold, symbolic both of her\r\ncooperation and her mineral wealth; Arizona one of gold, one of silver,\r\nand one of iron. Many other States offered significant tributes of\r\nsimilar nature. And when at last the great day came when all the short\r\nlines were connected in one whole, what a celebration there was from sea\r\nto sea! Wires had been laid so that the hammer that drove the last spike\r\nsent the news to cities all over the land. Bells rang, whistles blew,\r\nfire alarms sounded. The cost of the Union Pacific was about thirty-nine\r\nmillion dollars and that of the Central Pacific about one hundred and\r\nforty million dollars. The construction of the Southern Pacific\r\npresented a different set of problems from those of the Northern, but\r\nmany of the difficulties encountered were the same. Bands of robbers and\r\nIndians beset the workmen and either cut the ties and spread the rails,\r\nor tore the track up altogether for long distances. Forest fires often\r\novertook the men before they could escape, although trains sometimes\r\ncontrived to get through the burning areas by drenching their roofs and\r\nwere able to bring succor to those in peril. Then there were washouts\r\nand snowstorms quite as severe as any experienced in the northern\r\ncountry."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid I should have given the whole thing up!" interrupted Steve.\r\n\r\n"Many another was of your mind," returned Mr. Tolman. "The frightful\r\nheat encountered when crossing the deserts was, as I have said, the\r\ngreatest handicap. Frequently the work was at a standstill for months\r\nbecause all the metal--rails and tools--became too hot to handle. The\r\ndifficulty of getting water to the men in order to keep them alive in\r\nthis arid waste was in itself colossal. Tank cars were sent forward\r\nconstantly on all the railroads, northern as well as southern, and the\r\nsuffering experienced when such cars were for various reasons stalled\r\nwas tremendous. The sand storms along the Southern Pacific route were\r\nyet another menace. So you see an eagerness for adventure had to be\r\nbalanced by a corresponding measure of bravery. Those early days of\r\nrailroad building were not all romance and picturesqueness."\r\n\r\nStephen nodded as his father rose and took up his hat and coat.\r\n\r\n"I\'d like to hear Mr. Ackerman tell of the early steamboating," remarked\r\nthe lad. "I\'ll bet the story couldn\'t match the one you have just told."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps not," his father replied. "Nevertheless the steamships had\r\ntheir full share of exciting history and you must not be positive in\r\nyour opinion until you have heard both tales. Now come along, son, if\r\nyou are going with me, for I must be off."\r\n\r\nObediently Stephen slipped into his ulster and tagged at his father\'s\r\nheels along the corridor.\r\n\r\nWhat a magic country he lived in! And how had it happened that it had\r\nbeen his luck to be born now rather than in the pioneer days when there\r\nwere not only no railroads but no great hotels like this one, and no\r\nelevators?\r\n\r\n"I suppose," observed Mr. Tolman, as they went along, "we can hardly\r\nestimate what the coming of these railroads meant to the country. All\r\nthe isolated sections were now blended into one vast territory which\r\nbrought the dwellers of each into a common brotherhood. It was no small\r\nmatter to make a unit of a great republic like ours. The seafarer and\r\nthe woodsman; easterner, westerner, northerner, and southerner exchanged\r\nvisits and became more intelligently sympathetic. Rural districts were\r\nopened up and made possible for habitation. The products of the seacoast\r\nand the interior were interchanged. Crops could now be transported;\r\nmaterial for clothing distributed; and coal, steel, and iron--on which\r\nour industries were dependent--carried wherever they were needed.\r\nCommerce took a leap forward and with it national prosperity. From now\r\non we were no longer hampered in our inventions or industries and forced\r\nto send to England for machinery. We could make our own engines,\r\nmanufacture our own rails, coal our own boilers. Distance was diminished\r\nuntil it was no longer a barrier. Letters that it previously took days\r\nand even weeks to get came in hours, and the cost and time for freight\r\ntransportation was revolutionized. In 1804, for example, it took four\r\ndays to get a letter from New York to Boston; and even as late as 1817\r\nit cost a hundred dollars to move a ton of freight from Buffalo to New\r\nYork and took twenty days to do it. In every direction the railroads\r\nmade for national advancement and a more solid United States. No\r\nsoldiers, no statesmen of our land deserve greater honor as useful\r\ncitizens than do these men who braved every danger to build across the\r\ncountry our trans-continental railways."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nNEW PROBLEMS\r\n\r\n\r\n"I have been thinking, Dad," said Steve that evening, while they sat at\r\ndinner, "of the railroad story you told me this morning. It was some\r\nyarn." His father laughed over the top of his coffee cup.\r\n\r\n"It was, wasn\'t it?" replied he. "And the half was not told then. I was\r\nin too much of a hurry to give you an idea of all the trials the poor\r\nrailroad builders encountered. Did it occur to you, for example, that\r\nafter the roads to the Pacific coast were laid their managers were\r\nconfronted by another great difficulty,--the difference in time between\r\nthe east and the west?"\r\n\r\n"I never thought of that," was Steve\'s answer. "Of course the time must\r\nhave differed a lot."\r\n\r\n"Indeed it did! Every little branch road followed the time peculiar to\r\nits own section of the country, and the task of unifying this so that a\r\nbasis for a common time-table could be adopted was tremendous. A\r\nconvention of scientists from every section of the country was called to\r\nsee what could be done about the fifty-three different times in use by\r\nthe various railroads."\r\n\r\n"Fifty-three!" ejaculated Stephen, with a grin. "Why, that was almost as\r\nmany as Heinz pickles."\r\n\r\n"In this case the results of the fifty-three varieties were far more\r\nmenacing, I am afraid, than those of the fifty-seven," said his father,\r\nwith a smile, "for travel under such a r\xc3\xa9gime was positively unsafe."\r\n\r\n"I can see that it would be. What did they do?"\r\n\r\n"Well, after every sort of suggestion had been presented it was decided\r\nto divide the country up into four immense parts, separated from one\r\nanother by imaginary lines running north and south."\r\n\r\n"Degrees of longitude?"\r\n\r\n"Precisely!" returned Mr. Tolman, gratified that the boy had caught the\r\npoint so intelligently. "The time of each of these sections jumped\r\nfifteen degrees, or one hour, and the railroads lying in each district\r\nwere obliged to conform to the standard time of their locality. Until\r\nthis movement went into effect there had been, for example, six\r\nso-called standard times to reckon with in going from Boston to\r\nWashington."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see why everybody didn\'t get smashed up!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t either; and I fancy the passengers and the railroad people\r\ndidn\'t," declared Mr. Tolman. "But with the new state of things the\r\nsnarl was successfully untangled and the roads began to be operated on a\r\nmore scientific basis. Then followed gradual improvements in cars which\r\nas time went on were made more comfortable and convenient. The\r\ninvention of the steam engine and the development of our steel products\r\nwere the two great factors that made our American railroads possible.\r\nWith the trans-continental roads to carry materials and the opening up\r\nof our coal, iron and copper mines we were at last in a position to make\r\nour railroads successful. Then science began to evolve wonderful\r\nlabor-saving machinery which did away with the slow, primitive methods\r\nour pioneer engineers had been obliged to employ. The steam shovel was\r\ninvented, the traveling crane, the gigantic derrick, the pile driver.\r\nThe early railroad builders had few if any of these devices and were\r\nforced to do by hand the work that machinery could have performed in\r\nmuch less time. When one thinks back it is pathetic to consider the\r\nnumber of lives that were sacrificed which under present-day conditions\r\nmight have been saved. Yet every great movement goes forward over the\r\ndead bodies of unnamed heroes. To an extent this is unavoidable and one\r\nof the enigmas of life. If every generation were as wise at the\r\nbeginning as it is at the end there would be no progress. Nevertheless,\r\nwhen you reflect that ten thousand Chinese and Chilean laborers died\r\nwhile building one of the South American railroads it does make us\r\nwonder why we should be the ones to reap the benefits of so much that\r\nothers sowed, doesn\'t it?" mused the boy\'s father.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to say that ten thousand persons were killed while that\r\nrailroad was being built?" questioned Stephen, aghast.\r\n\r\n"They were not all killed," was the reply. "Many of them died of\r\nexposure to cold, and many from the effects of the climate. Epidemics\r\nswept away hundreds of lives. This particular railroad was one of the\r\nmightiest engineering feats the world had seen for in its path lay the\r\nAndes Mountains, and there was no escape from either crossing or\r\ntunneling them. The great tunnel that pierces them at a height of 15,645\r\nfeet above sea level is one of the marvels of science. In various parts\r\nof the world there are other such monuments to man\'s conquest of the\r\nopposing forces of nature. Honeycombing the Alps are spiral tunnels that\r\ncurve round and round like corkscrews inside the mountains, rising\r\nslowly to the peaks and making it possible to reach the heights that\r\nmust be traversed. Among these marvels is the Simplon Tunnel, famous the\r\nworld over. The road that crosses the Semmering Pass from Trieste to\r\nVienna is another example of what man can do if he must. By means of a\r\nseries of covered galleries it makes its way through the mountains that\r\nstretch like a wall between Italy and Austria. In the early days this\r\nterritory with its many ravines and almost impassable heights would have\r\nbeen considered too difficult to cross. The railroad over the Brenner\r\nPass between Innsbruck and Botzen penetrates the mountains of the Tyrol\r\nby means of twenty-three tunnels."\r\n\r\n"I learned about the St. Gothard tunnel in school," Steve interrupted\r\neagerly.\r\n\r\n"Yes, that is yet another of the celebrated ones," his father\r\nrejoined. "In fact, there are now so many of these miracles of skilful\r\nrailroading that we have almost ceased to wonder at them. Railroads\r\nthread their way up Mt. Washington, Mt. Rigi, and many another dizzy\r\naltitude; to say nothing of the cable-cars and funicular roads that take\r\nour breath away when they whirl us to the top of some mountain, either\r\nin Europe or in our own land. Man has left scarce a corner of our planet\r\ninaccessible, until now, not content with scaling the highest peaks by\r\ntrain, he has progressed still another stage and is flying over them.\r\nThus do the marvels of one age become the commonplace happenings of the\r\nnext. Our ancestors doubtless thought, when they had accomplished the\r\nmiracles of their generation, that nothing could surpass them. In the\r\nsame spirit we regard our aeroplanes and submarines with triumphant\r\npride. But probably the time will come when those who follow us will\r\nlook back on what we have done and laugh at our attempts just as you\r\nlaughed when I told you of the first railroad."\r\n\r\nStephen was thoughtful for a moment.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a great game--living--isn\'t it, Dad?"\r\n\r\n"It is a great game if you make yourself one of the team and pull on the\r\nside of the world\'s betterment," nodded his father. "Think what such a\r\nthing as the railroad has meant to millions and millions of people. Not\r\nonly has it opened up a country which might have been shut away from\r\ncivilization for centuries; but it has brought men all over the world\r\ncloser together and made it possible for those of one land to visit\r\nthose of another and come into sympathy with them. Japan, China, and\r\nIndia, to say nothing of the peoples of Europe, are almost our neighbors\r\nin these days of ships and railroads."\r\n\r\n"I suppose we should not have known much about those places, should we,"\r\nreflected the boy.\r\n\r\n"Certainly not so much as we do now," was his father\'s answer. "Of\r\ncourse, travelers did go to those countries now and then; but to get far\r\ninto their interior in a palanquin carried by coolies, for example, was\r\na pretty slow business."\r\n\r\n"And uncomfortable, too," Stephen decided. "I guess the natives were\r\nmighty glad to see the railroads coming."\r\n\r\nTo the lad\'s surprise his father shook his head.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid they weren\'t," observed he ruefully. "You recall how even\r\nthe more civilized and better educated English and French opposed the\r\nfirst railroads? Well, the ignorant orientals, who were a hundred times\r\nmore superstitious, objected very vehemently. The Chinese in particular\r\nfeared that the innovation would put to flight the spirits which they\r\nbelieved inhabited the earth, air, and water. Surely, they argued, if\r\nthese gods were disturbed, disaster to the nation must inevitably\r\nfollow. It was almost impossible to convince even the more intelligent\r\nleaders that the railroad would be a benefit instead of a menace for\r\nbefore the ancient beliefs argument was helpless."\r\n\r\n"Well, the railroads were built just the same, weren\'t they?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. Fortunately some of the more enlightened were led to see the\r\nwisdom of the enterprise, and they converted the others to their views\r\nor else overrode their protests. They were like a lot of children who\r\ndid not know what was best for them and as such they had to be treated.\r\nNevertheless, you may be quite certain that the pioneer days of railroad\r\nbuilding in the East were not pleasant ones. Materials had to be carried\r\nfor great distances both by water and by land. In 1864, when the first\r\nlocomotive was taken to Ceylon, it had to be transported on a raft of\r\nbamboo and drawn from the landing place to the track by elephants."\r\n\r\n"Humph!" chuckled Steve. "It\'s funny to think of, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"More funny to think of than to do, I guess," asserted his father.\r\n"Still it is the battle against obstacles that makes life interesting,\r\nand in spite of all the hardships I doubt if those first railroad men\r\nwould have missed the adventure of it all. Out of their resolution,\r\nfearlessness and vision came a wonderful fulfillment, and it must have\r\nbeen some satisfaction to know that they had done their share in\r\nbringing it about."\r\n\r\n"I suppose that is what Mr. Ackerman meant when he spoke of the history\r\nof steamboating," said the boy slowly.\r\n\r\n"Yes. He and his family had a hand in that great game and I do not\r\nwonder he is proud of it. And speaking of Mr. Ackerman reminds me that\r\nhe called up this afternoon to ask if you would like to take a\r\nmotor-ride with him to-morrow morning while I am busy."\r\n\r\n"You bet I would!" was the fervent reply.\r\n\r\n"I thought as much, so I made the engagement for you. He is coming for\r\nyou at ten o\'clock. And he will have quite a surprise for you, too."\r\n\r\n"What is it?" the boy asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n"It is not my secret to tell," was the provoking answer. "You will know\r\nit in good time."\r\n\r\n"To-morrow?"\r\n\r\n"I think so, yes."\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you tell me anything about it?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing but that you were indirectly responsible for it."\r\n\r\n"_I!_" gasped Stephen.\r\n\r\nMr. Tolman laughed.\r\n\r\n"That will give you something to wonder and to dream about," he\r\nresponded, rising from the table. "Let us see how much of a Sherlock\r\nHolmes you are."\r\n\r\nSteve\'s mind immediately began to speculate rapidly on his father\'s\r\nenigmatic remark. All the way up in the elevator he pondered over the\r\nconundrum; and all the evening he turned it over in his mind. At last,\r\ntired with the day\'s activities, he went to bed, hoping that dreams\r\nmight furnish him with a solution of the riddle. But although he slept\r\nhard no dreams came and morning found him no nearer the answer than he\r\nhad been before.\r\n\r\nHe must wait patiently for Mr. Ackerman to solve the puzzle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nDICK MAKES HIS SECOND APPEARANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Mr. Ackerman\'s car rolled up to the hotel later in the morning the\r\npuzzle no longer lacked a solution for in the automobile beside the\r\nsteamboat magnate sat Dick Martin, the lad of the pocketbook adventure.\r\nAt first glance Steve scarcely recognized the boy, such a transformation\r\nhad taken place in his appearance. He wore a new suit of blue serge, a\r\nsmartly cut reefer, shiny shoes, a fresh cap, and immaculate linen. Soap\r\nand water, as well as a proper style of haircut had added their part to\r\nthe miracle until now, with face glowing and eyes alight with pleasure,\r\nDick was as attractive a boy as one would care to see.\r\n\r\n"I have brought Dick along with me, you see," the New Yorker explained,\r\nwhen the three were in the car and speeding up Fifth Avenue. "He and I\r\nhave been shopping and now he is coming home to stay with me until we\r\nhear from one of the schools to which I have written. If they can find a\r\nplace for him he will start at once. Then he is going to study hard and\r\nsee what sort of a man he can make of himself. I expect to be very proud\r\nof him some day."\r\n\r\nThe lad flushed.\r\n\r\n"I am going to do my best," said he, in a low tone.\r\n\r\n"That is all any one can do, sonny," declared Mr. Ackerman kindly.\r\n"You\'ll win out. Don\'t you worry! I\'m not."\r\n\r\nHe smiled and Dick smiled back timidly.\r\n\r\n"Have you been up to Mr. Ackerman\'s house yet and seen the boats?"\r\nStephen asked, to break the pause that fell between them.\r\n\r\n"His collection, you mean? Sure! I\'m--staying there."\r\n\r\n"Living there, sonny," put in the financier.\r\n\r\n"Then I suppose he\'s told you all about them," went on Stephen, a hint\r\nof envy in his tone.\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t yet," laughed their host, "for there hasn\'t been time. Dick\r\nonly left the hotel yesterday and we have had a great deal to do since.\r\nWe had to go to his lodgings and say good-by to the people there who\r\nhave been kind to him and tell them why he was not coming back. And then\r\nthere were errands and many other things to see to. So he has not been\r\nat home much yet," concluded Mr. Ackerman, with a kindly emphasis on the\r\nfinal sentence.\r\n\r\nDick beamed but it was evident that the magnitude of his good fortune\r\nhad left him too overwhelmed for words.\r\n\r\nPerhaps neither of the boys minded that there was little conversation\r\nduring the drive for there was plenty to see and to Dick Martin, at\r\nleast, an automobile ride was such an uncommon experience that it\r\nneeded no embellishments. They rode up Morningside Drive and back again,\r\nlooking down on the river as they went, and exclaiming when some unusual\r\ncraft passed them. Evidently Mr. Ackerman was quite content to let\r\nmatters take their natural course; but he was not unmindful of his\r\nguests and when at last he saw a shadow of fatigue circle Dick\'s eyes\r\nand give place to the glow of excitement that had lighted them he said:\r\n\r\n"Now suppose we go back to the house for a while. We have an hour or\r\nmore before Stephen has to rejoin his father and you two chaps can poke\r\nabout the suite. What do you say?"\r\n\r\nSteve was all enthusiasm. He had been quietly hoping there would be a\r\nchance for him to have another peep at the wonderful steamboats.\r\n\r\n"I\'d like nothing better!" was his instant reply. "I did not see half I\r\nwanted to when I was there before, and we go home to-morrow, you know.\r\nIf I don\'t see your ships and things to-day I never shall."\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t say that!" Mr. Ackerman said quickly. "You and Dick and I are\r\ngoing to be great friends. We are not going to say good-by and never see\r\none another any more. Sometime you will be coming to New York again, I\r\nhope. However, if he wants to have a second glimpse of our boats now\r\nwe\'ll let him, won\'t we, Dick?"\r\n\r\nAgain the boy smiled a timid smile into his benefactor\'s face.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "I wish you\'d tell me about this queer little\r\nold-fashioned boat." Page 181.]\r\n\r\nIt did not take long to reach the house and soon the three were in the\r\nwonderful room with its panorama of ships moving past the windows and\r\nits flotilla of still more ships decorating the walls.\r\n\r\n"Now you boys go ahead and entertain yourselves as you please," Mr.\r\nAckerman said. "I am going to sit here and read the paper; but if there\r\nis anything you want to ask me you are welcome to do so."\r\n\r\nStephen strolled over to the mantelpiece and stood before the model of\r\nthe quaint side-wheeler that had held his attention at the time of his\r\nfirst visit; then he stole a furtive glance at the man in the big chair.\r\n\r\n"Did you really mean, Mr. Ackerman," he faltered, "that we could ask you\r\nquestions?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly."\r\n\r\n"Then I wish you\'d tell me about this queer little old-fashioned boat,\r\nand how you happened to put it between this up-to-date ocean liner and\r\nthis battleship."\r\n\r\nThe elder man looked up.\r\n\r\n"That boat that interests you is a model of Fulton\'s steamboat--or at\r\nleast as near a model as I could get," explained he. "I put it there to\r\nshow the progress we have made in shipbuilding since that day."\r\n\r\nSteve laughed.\r\n\r\n"I see the progress all right," replied he, "but I am afraid I do not\r\nknow much about Fulton and his side-wheeler."\r\n\r\nMr. Ackerman let the paper slip into his lap.\r\n\r\n"I assumed every boy who went to school learned about Robert Fulton,"\r\nanswered he, half teasingly and yet with real surprise.\r\n\r\n"I suppose I ought to have learned about him," retorted Stephen, with\r\ningratiating honesty, "and maybe I did once. But if I did I seem to have\r\nforgotten about it. You see there are such a lot of those old chaps who\r\ndid things that I get them all mixed up."\r\n\r\nApparently the sincerity of the confession pleased the capitalist for he\r\nlaughed.\r\n\r\n"I know!" returned he sympathetically. "Every year more and more things\r\nroll up to remember, don\'t they? Had we lived long ago, before so many\r\nbattles and discoveries had taken place, and so many books been written,\r\nlife would have been much simpler. Now the learning of all the ages\r\ncomes piling down on our heads. But at least you can congratulate\r\nyourself that you are not so badly off as the boys will be a hundred\r\nyears hence; they, poor things, will have to learn all about what _we_\r\nhave been doing, and if the world progresses as rapidly in history and\r\nin science as it is doing now, I pity them. Not only will they have to\r\ngo back to Fulton but to him they will probably have to add a score of\r\nother inventors."\r\n\r\nBoth boys joined in the steamboat man\'s hearty laugh.\r\n\r\n"Well, who was Fulton, anyway, Mr. Ackerman?" Stephen persisted.\r\n\r\n"If you want me to tell you that Robert Fulton was the first American to\r\nmake a successful steamboat I can give you that information in a\r\nsecond," was the reply. "But if you wish to hear how he did it that is a\r\nmuch longer story."\r\n\r\n"I like stories," piped Dick from the corner of the couch where he was\r\nsitting.\r\n\r\n"So do I," echoed Steve.\r\n\r\n"Then I see there is no help for me!" Mr. Ackerman answered, taking off\r\nhis spectacles and putting them into the case.\r\n\r\nWith an anticipatory smile Stephen seated himself on the great leather\r\ndivan beside the other boy.\r\n\r\n"Before the steamboat came," began Mr. Ackerman, "you must remember that\r\npaddle wheels had long been used, for both the Egyptians and the Romans\r\nhad built galleys with oars that moved by a windlass turned by the hands\r\nof slaves or by oxen. Later there were smaller boats whose paddle wheels\r\nwere driven by horses. So you see paddle wheels were nothing new; the\r\nworld was just waiting for something that would turn them around. After\r\nthe Marquis of Worcester had made his steam fountain he suggested that\r\nperhaps this power might be used to propel a boat but unfortunately he\r\ndied before any experiments with the idea could be made. Various\r\nscientists, however, in Spain, France, England and Scotland caught up\r\nthe plan but after struggling unsuccessfully with it for a time\r\nabandoned it as impractical. In 1802 Lord Dundas, a proprietor in one of\r\nthe English canals, made an encouraging start by using a tow-boat with\r\na paddle wheel at its stern. But alas, this contrivance kicked up such a\r\nfuss in the narrow stream that it threatened to tear the banks along the\r\nedge all to pieces and therefore it was given up and for ten years\r\nafterward there was no more steamboating in England."\r\n\r\nThe boys on the couch chuckled.\r\n\r\n"In the meantime in America thoughtful men were mulling over the problem\r\nof steam navigation. Watt\'s engine had opened to the minds of inventors\r\nendless possibilities; and the success of the early railroads made many\r\npersons feel that a new era of science, whose wonders had only begun to\r\nunfold, was at hand. In Connecticut there lived a watchmaker by the name\r\nof John Fitch, who, although he knew little of the use of steam, knew\r\nmuch about machinery. Through the aid of a company that furnished him\r\nwith the necessary money he built a steamboat which was tried out in\r\n1787 and made three miles an hour. Of course it was not a boat like any\r\nof ours for it was propelled by twelve oars, or paddles, operated by a\r\nvery primitive steam engine. Nevertheless, it was the forerunner of\r\nlater and better devices of a similar nature, and therefore Fitch is\r\noften credited with being the inventor of the steamboat. Perhaps, had he\r\nbeen able to go on with his schemes, he might have given the world\r\nsomething really significant in this direction; but as it was he simply\r\npointed the way. His money gave out, the company would do nothing\r\nfurther for him, and after building a second boat that could go eight\r\nmiles an hour instead of three he became discouraged and intemperate and\r\nlet his genius go to ruin, dying later in poverty--a sad end to a life\r\nthat might well have been a brilliant one. After Fitch came other\r\nexperimenters, among them Oliver Evans of Philadelphia who seems to have\r\nbeen a man of no end of inventive vision."\r\n\r\n"Wasn\'t he the one who tried sails on a railroad train?" inquired Steve,\r\nnoting with pleasure the familiar name.\r\n\r\n"He was that very person," nodded Mr. Ackerman. "He evidently had plenty\r\nof ideas; the only trouble was that they did not work very well. He had\r\nalready applied steam to mills and wagons, and now he wanted to see what\r\nhe could do with it aboard a boat. Either he was very impractical or\r\nelse hard luck pursued his undertakings. At any rate, he had a boat\r\nbuilt in Kentucky, an engine installed on it, and then he had the craft\r\nfloated to New Orleans from which point he planned to make a trip up the\r\nMississippi. But alas, before his boat was fully ready, there was a drop\r\nin the river and the vessel was left high and dry on the shore."\r\n\r\n"Jove!" exclaimed Dick involuntarily.\r\n\r\n"Pretty tough, wasn\'t it?" remarked Mr. Ackerman.\r\n\r\n"What did he do then?" demanded Stephen. "Did he resurrect the boat?"\r\n\r\n"No, it did not seem to be any use; instead he had the engine and boiler\r\ntaken out and put into a saw mill where once again hard luck pursued\r\nhim, for the mill was burned not long after. That was the end of Oliver\r\nEvans\'s steamboating."\r\n\r\nMr. Ackerman paused thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n"Now while Fitch and those following him were working at the steamboat\r\nidea here in America, Robert Fulton, also a native of this country, was\r\nturning the notion over in his mind. Strangely enough, he had not\r\nintended to be an inventor for he was in France, studying to be a\r\npainter. During a visit to England he had already met several men who\r\nwere interested in the steam engine and through them had informed\r\nhimself pretty thoroughly about the uses and action of steam. In Paris\r\nhe made the acquaintance of a Mr. Barlow and the two decided to raise\r\nfunds and build a steamboat to run on the Rhone. This they did, but\r\nunfortunately the boat sank before any degree of success had been\r\nachieved. Then Fulton, not a whit discouraged, told the French\r\nGovernment that if they would furnish the money he would build a similar\r\nboat to navigate the Seine. The French, however, had no faith in the\r\nplan and promptly refused to back it."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll bet they wished afterward they had!" interrupted Dick.\r\n\r\n"I presume they did," agreed Mr. Ackerman. "It is very easy to see one\'s\r\nmistakes after a thing is all over. Anyway, Mr. Barlow came back to\r\nAmerica, where Fulton joined him, and immediately the latter went to\r\nbuilding a steamboat that should be practical. On his way home he had\r\nstopped in England and purchased various parts for his engine and when\r\nhe got to New York he had these set up in an American boat. You must not\r\nfor a moment imagine that everything about this first steamboat of\r\nFulton\'s was original. On the contrary he combined what was best in the\r\nexperiments of previous inventors. He adopted the English type of\r\nengine, the side paddle, everything that seemed to him workable. Barlow\r\nand a rich New Yorker named Livingston backed the enterprise. Now some\r\ntime before the State of New York, half in jest and half in irony, had\r\ngranted to Livingston the sole right to navigate the New York waters by\r\nmeans of ships driven by steam or fire engines. At the time the\r\nprivilege had caused much mirth for there were nothing but sailing ships\r\nin existence, and there was no prospect of there ever being any other\r\nkind of vessel. Hence the honor was a very empty one and nobody expected\r\na time would arrive when it would ever be of any value to its owner. But\r\nLivingston was a shrewder and more far-seeing man than were the old\r\nlegislators at Albany, and to Fulton he was an indispensable ally."\r\n\r\nThe boy listened breathlessly.\r\n\r\n"How these three men managed to keep their secret so well is a mystery;\r\nbut apparently they did, and when Fulton suddenly appeared on the\r\nHudson with a steamboat named the _Clermont_ for Mr. Livingston\'s\r\ncountry seat on the Palisades, the public was amazed. A model of the\r\nboat with a miniature engine had previously been tried out so the three\r\npromoters had little doubt that their project would work, and it did. As\r\nthe new craft moved along without any sails to propel it the sensation\r\nit made was tremendous. People were divided as to whether to flee from\r\nit in terror or linger and marvel at it. It is a pity that the\r\nnewspapers of the period did not take the advent of this remarkable\r\ninvention more seriously for it would have been interesting to know more\r\nof the impression it created. As it was little is recorded about it.\r\nProbably the very silence of the press is significant of the fact that\r\nthere was scant faith in the invention, and that it was considered too\r\nvisionary a scheme to dignify with any notice. However that may be, the\r\nnewspapers passed this wonderful event by with almost no comment.\r\nHistory, however, is more generous and several amusing stories have come\r\ndown to us of the fright the _Clermont_ caused as she crept along the\r\nriver at dusk with a shower of vermilion sparks rising from her funnel.\r\nOne man who came around a bend of the stream in his boat and encountered\r\nthe strange apparition for the first time told his wife afterward that\r\nhe had met the devil traveling the river in a sawmill."\r\n\r\nThere was a shout of laughter from the boys.\r\n\r\n"The trial trip, to which many distinguished guests were invited, took\r\nplace a few days later, and after improving some of the defects that\r\ncropped up the steamboat was advertised to run regularly between New\r\nYork and Albany. Now if you think this announcement was hailed with joy\r\nyou are much mistaken," continued Mr. Ackerman, smiling to himself at\r\nsome memory that evidently amused him. "On the contrary the owners of\r\nthe sailing ships which up to this time had had the monopoly of traffic\r\nwere furious with rage. So vehemently did they maintain that the river\r\nbelonged to them that at last the matter went to the courts and Daniel\r\nWebster was retained as Fulton\'s counsel. The case attracted wide\r\nattention throughout the country, and when it was decided in Fulton\'s\r\nfavor there was great excitement. Every sort of force was brought to\r\nbear to thwart the new steamboat company. Angry opponents tried to blow\r\nup the boat as it lay at the dock; attempts were made to burn it. At\r\nlength affairs became so serious that a clause was appended to the\r\ncourt\'s decree which made it a public crime punishable by fine or\r\nimprisonment to attempt to injure the _Clermont_."\r\n\r\nMr. Ackerman paused to light a fresh cigar.\r\n\r\n"From the moment the law took this stand the success of the undertaking\r\nbecame assured and it is interesting to see how quickly the very men who\r\njeered loudest at the enterprise now came fawning and begging to have a\r\npart in it. Other steamboats were added to the line and soon rival\r\nfirms began to construct steamboats of their own and try to break up\r\nFulton\'s monopoly of the waters of the State. For years costly lawsuits\r\nraged, and in defiance of the right the New York legislature had granted\r\nto Livingston, the fiercest competition took place. Sometime I should\r\nlike to tell you more of this phase of the story for it is a very\r\nexciting and interesting yarn. Yet in spite of all the strife and hatred\r\nthat pursued him Fulton\'s river-boats and ferries continued to run."\r\n\r\n"The State stuck to its bargain, then," murmured Steve, "and left\r\nLivingston the rights awarded him?"\r\n\r\n"No," replied Mr. Ackerman. "For a time they clung to their agreement;\r\nbut at last the courts withdrew the right as illegal, and poor\r\nLivingston, who had sunk the greater part of his fortune in the\r\nsteamboat business, lived to see the fruit of his toil wrested from him.\r\nIn point of fact, I believe the decision of the courts to have been a\r\njust one for no one person or group of persons should control the\r\nwaterways of the country. You can see the wisdom of this yourself.\r\nNevertheless, the decree hit Livingston pretty hard. It was the first\r\nstep in the destruction of a monopoly," added Mr. Ackerman whimsically.\r\n"Since then such decrees have become common happenings in America,\r\nmonopolies being considered a menace to national prosperity. Certainly\r\nin this case it was well that the Supreme Court of the United States\r\ndecided that all waters of the country should be free to navigators, no\r\nmatter in what kind of vessel they chose to sail."\r\n\r\n"It was tough on Fulton and his friends, though, wasn\'t it?" observed\r\nDick, who was plainly unconvinced as many another had been of the\r\njustice of the arguments.\r\n\r\n"Yes," agreed Mr. Ackerman, smiling into his troubled eyes, "I grant you\r\nit was tough on them."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nA STEAMBOAT TRIP BY RAIL\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was with a sense of deep regret that Stephen bade good-by to Mr.\r\nAckerman and Dick and returned to the hotel to join his father. For the\r\nsteamboat financier he had established one of those ardent admirations\r\nwhich a boy frequently cherishes toward a man of attractive personality\r\nwho is older than himself; and for Dick he had a genuine liking. There\r\nwas a quality very winning in the youthful East-sider and now that the\r\nchance for betterment had come his way Steve felt sure that the boy\r\nwould make good. There was a lot of pluck and grit in that wiry little\r\nframe; a lot of honesty too, Stephen reflected, with a blush. He was not\r\nat all sure but that in the matter of fearlessness and moral courage the\r\nNew York lad had the lead of him. Certainly he was not one who shrank\r\nfrom confessing when he had been at fault which, Steve owned with shame,\r\ncould not be said of himself.\r\n\r\nFor several days he had not thought of his automobile escapade but now\r\nonce more it came to his mind, causing a cloud to chase the joyousness\r\nfrom his face. Alas, was he never to be free of the nagging\r\nmortification that had followed that single act? Was it always to lurk\r\nin the background and make him ashamed to confront the world squarely?\r\nWell, it was no use regretting it now. He had made his choice and he\r\nmust abide by it.\r\n\r\nNevertheless he was not quite so spontaneously happy when he met his\r\nfather at luncheon and recounted to him the happenings of the morning.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Ackerman is taking a big chance with that boy," was Mr. Tolman\'s\r\ncomment, when a pause came in the narrative. "I only hope he will not\r\ndisappoint him. There must be a great difference between the standards\r\nof the two. However, Dick has some fine characteristics to build\r\non--honesty and manliness. I think the fact that he showed no coward\r\nblood and was ready to stand by what he had done appealed to Ackerman.\r\nIt proved that although they had not had the same opportunity in life\r\nthey at least had some good stuff in common. You can\'t do much with a\r\nboy who isn\'t honest."\r\n\r\nStephen felt the blood beating in his cheeks.\r\n\r\nFortunately his father did not notice his embarrassment and as they soon\r\nwere on their way to a picture show the memory that had so importunately\r\nraised its unwelcome head was banished by the stirring story of a\r\nCalifornian gold mine. Therefore by the time Stephen was ready to go to\r\nbed the ghost that haunted him was once more thrust into the background\r\nand he had gained his serenity. No, he was not troubled that night by\r\ndreams of his folly nor did he awaken with any remembrance of it.\r\nInstead he and his father chatted as they packed quite as pleasantly as\r\nif no specter stood between them.\r\n\r\n"Well, son, have you enjoyed your holiday?" inquired Mr. Tolman, as they\r\nsettled themselves in the great plush chairs of the parlor car and\r\nwaited for the train to start.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'ve had a bully time, Dad."\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad of that," was the kind reply. "It was unlucky that my business\r\ntook up so much more of my time than I had expected and that I had to\r\nleave you to amuse yourself instead of going about with you, as I had\r\nplanned. It was too bad. However, if you have managed to get some fun\r\nout of your visit that is the main thing. In fact, I am not sure but\r\nthat you rather enjoyed going about alone," concluded he mischievously.\r\n\r\nStephen smiled but did not reply. There was no denying that he had found\r\nbeing his own master a pleasant experience which had furnished him with\r\na gratifying sense of freedom and belief in his own importance. What a\r\ntale he would have to tell the fellows at home! And how shocked his\r\nmother would be to hear that he had been turned loose in a great city in\r\nthis unceremonious fashion! He could hear her now saying to his father:\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see what you were thinking of, Henry, to let Stephen tear about\r\nall alone in a city like New York. I should have worried every instant\r\nif I had known what he was doing. Suppose anything had happened to\r\nhim!"\r\n\r\nWell, mercifully, nothing had happened,--that is, nothing worse than his\r\nfalling into the hands of a detective and being almost arrested for\r\nrobbery, reflected the boy with a grin.\r\n\r\nPerhaps Mr. Tolman interpreted his thoughts for presently he observed\r\nwith a smile:\r\n\r\n"It is time you were branching out some for yourself, anyway, son. You\r\nare old enough now to be treated like a man, not like a little boy."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he looked toward Stephen with an expression of such pride\r\nand affection that the force of it swept over the lad as it never had\r\ndone before. What a bully sort his father was, he suddenly thought; and\r\nhow genuinely he believed in him! Why not speak out now and clear up the\r\nwretched deception he had practiced, and start afresh with a clean\r\nconscience? With impulsive resolve he gripped the arms of the chair and\r\npulled himself together for his confession. But just at the crucial\r\nmoment there was a stir in the aisle and a porter followed by two\r\nbelated passengers hurried into the train which was on the brink of\r\ndeparture. That they had made their connection by a very narrow margin\r\nwas evident in their appearance, for both were hot and out of breath,\r\nand the stout colored porter puffed under the stress of his haste and\r\nthe heavy luggage which weighed him down.\r\n\r\n"It\'s these two chairs, sir," he gasped, as he tossed the new leather\r\nsuit case into the rack. "Is there anything else I can do for you?"\r\n\r\n"No," replied the traveler, thrusting a bill into the darkey\'s hand.\r\nAlready the train was moving. "Keep the change," he added quickly.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, sir! Thank you!" stammered the vanishing negro.\r\n\r\n"Well, we caught it, didn\'t we, Dick? It didn\'t look at one time as if\r\nit were possible. That block of cars on the avenue was terrible. But we\r\nare off now! It was about the closest shave I ever made." Then he turned\r\naround. "Hullo!" he cried. "Who\'s this? Bless my soul!"\r\n\r\nBoth Mr. Tolman and Steve joined in the laugh of amazement.\r\n\r\n"Well, if this isn\'t a great note!" went on Mr. Ackerman, still beaming\r\nwith surprise. "I thought you people were not going until the afternoon\r\ntrain."\r\n\r\n"I managed to finish up my business yesterday and get off earlier than I\r\nplanned," Mr. Tolman explained. "But I did not know _you_ had any\r\nintention of going in this direction."\r\n\r\n"I hadn\'t until this morning," laughed the financier. "Then a telegram\r\narrived saying they could take Dick at the New Haven school to which I\r\nhad written if he entered right away, at the beginning of the term. So I\r\ndropped everything and here we are _en route_. It was rather short\r\nnotice and things were a bit hectic; but by turning the whole apartment\r\nupside down, rushing our packing, and keeping the telephone wire hot we\r\ncontrived to make the train."\r\n\r\n"It is mighty nice for us," put in Mr. Tolman cordially. "So Dick is\r\nsetting forth on his education, is he?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, he is starting out to make of himself a good scholar, a good\r\nsport, a good athlete, and I hope a good man," returned the New Yorker.\r\n\r\n"A pretty big order, isn\'t it, Dick?" laughed Mr. Tolman.\r\n\r\n"It seems so," returned the boy.\r\n\r\n"It is not a bit too big," interrupted Mr. Ackerman. "Dick knows he\r\nhasn\'t got to turn the trick all in a minute. He and I understand such\r\nthings take time. But they _can be done_ and we expect we are going to\r\ndo them."\r\n\r\nHe flashed one of his rare smiles toward his prot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9 and the lad smiled\r\nback frankly.\r\n\r\n"I expect so, too," echoed Mr. Tolman. "You\'ve got plenty of backers\r\nbehind you, Dick, and you have a clear path ahead. That is all any boy\r\nneeds."\r\n\r\n"You\'re going back to school, aren\'t you, youngster?" Mr. Ackerman\r\nsuddenly inquired of Stephen.\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir. I start in next week."\r\n\r\n"Decided yet whether you will be a railroad man like your Dad, or a\r\nsteamboat man like me?" went on the New Yorker facetiously.\r\n\r\n"Not yet."\r\n\r\n"Oh, for shame! It should not take you any time at all to decide a\r\nquestion like that," the capitalist asserted teasingly. "What\'s\r\nhindering you?"\r\n\r\nStephen gave a mischievous chuckle.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t decide until I have heard both sides," said he. "So far I know\r\nonly half the steamboat story."\r\n\r\n"I see! In other words you think that between here and New Haven I might\r\nbeguile the time by going on with the yarn I began yesterday."\r\n\r\n"That thought crossed my mind, sir,--yes."\r\n\r\n"You should go into the diplomatic service, young man. Your talents are\r\nbeing wasted," observed Mr. Ackerman good-humoredly. "Well, I suppose I\r\ncould romance for the benefit of you two boys for part of the way, at\r\nleast. It will give your father, Steve, a chance to go into the other\r\ncar and smoke. Where did we break off our story? Do you remember?"\r\n\r\n"Where the United States said anybody had the right to sail anywhere he\r\nwanted to, in any kind of a boat he chose," piped Dick with promptness.\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes. I recall it all now," said Mr. Ackerman. "The courts withdrew\r\nthe grant giving Livingston the sole right to navigate the waters of New\r\nYork State by means of steamboats. So you want to hear more about it, do\r\nyou?"\r\n\r\n"Yes!" came simultaneously from both the boys.\r\n\r\n"Then all aboard! Tolman, you can read, or run off and enjoy your cigar.\r\nWe are going on a steamboat cruise."\r\n\r\n"Push off! You won\'t bother me," was the tolerant retort, as the elder\r\nman unfolded the morning paper.\r\n\r\nMr. Ackerman cleared his throat.\r\n\r\n"Before this decree to give everybody an equal chance in navigating the\r\nwaters of the country was handed down by the courts," he began, "various\r\ncompanies, in defiance of Livingston\'s contract, began building and\r\nrunning steamboats on the Hudson. Two rival boats were speedily in\r\noperation and it was only after a three years\' lawsuit that they were\r\nlegally condemned and handed over to Fulton to be broken up. Then the\r\nferryboat people got busy and petitioned the New York Legislature for\r\nthe right to run their boats to and fro between the New York and New\r\nJersey sides of the river, and it is interesting to remember that it was\r\non one of these ferry routes that Cornelius Vanderbilt, the great\r\nAmerican financier, began his career."\r\n\r\n"I never knew that!" ejaculated Dick, intent on the story.\r\n\r\n"After the ruling of the Supreme Court in 1818 that all the waters of\r\nthe country were free there was a rush to construct and launch steamers\r\non the Hudson. The route was, you see, not only the most direct one\r\nbetween Albany and New York but it also lay in the line of travel\r\nbetween the eastern States and those of the west which were just being\r\nopened to traffic by the railroads and ships of the Great Lakes. Now you\r\nmust not for a moment imagine that in those days there were any such\r\nvast numbers of persons traversing the country as there are now. Our\r\nearly Americans worked hard and possessed only comparatively small\r\nfortunes so they had little money to throw away on travel simply for its\r\nown sake; moreover the War of 1812 had left the country poor.\r\nNevertheless there were a good many persons who were obliged to travel,\r\nand it followed that each of the Hudson River lines of steamers was\r\neager to secure their patronage. Hence a bitter competition arose\r\nbetween the rival steamboat companies."\r\n\r\nHe paused and smiled whimsically at some memory that amused him.\r\n\r\n"Every inducement was offered the public by these battling forces. The\r\nolder vessels were scrapped or reduced to tug service and finer\r\nsteamboats were built; and once upon the water the engines were driven\r\nat full speed that quicker trips might lure passengers to patronize the\r\nswifter boats. Captains and firemen pitted their energies against one\r\nanother and without scruple raced their ships, with the result that\r\nthere were many accidents. In spite of this, however, the rivalry grew\r\nrather than diminished."\r\n\r\n"It must have been great sport," remarked Stephen.\r\n\r\n"Oh, there was sport in plenty," nodded Mr. Ackerman. "Had you lived\r\nduring those first days of Hudson River transportation you would have\r\nseen all the sport you wanted to see, for the steamboat feud raged with\r\nfury, the several companies trying their uttermost to get the trade away\r\nfrom the Fulton people and from one another. Money became no object,\r\nthe only aim being to win in the game. Fares were reduced from ten\r\ndollars to one, and frequently passengers were carried for nothing\r\nsimply for the sheer spite of getting them away from other lines.\r\nVanderbilt was in the thick of the fray, having now accumulated\r\nsufficient fortune to operate no less than fifty boats. Among the finest\r\nvessels were those of the Emerald Line; and the _Swallow_ and the\r\n_Rochester_, two of the speediest rivals, were continually racing each\r\nother. The devices resorted to in order to ensnare passengers were very\r\namusing: some boats carried bands; others served free meals; and because\r\nthere were few newspapers in those days, and only limited means for\r\nadvertising, runners were hired to go about the city or waylay\r\nprospective travelers at the docks and try to coax them into making\r\ntheir trip by some particular steamer."\r\n\r\n"That was one way of getting business!" laughed Steve.\r\n\r\n"And often a very effective way, too," rejoined Mr. Ackerman. "In June\r\nof 1847 a tremendously exciting race took place between the _Oregon_ and\r\nthe _Vanderbilt_, then a new boat, for a thousand dollars a side. The\r\nsteamers left the Battery at eleven o\'clock in the morning and a dense\r\ncrowd turned out to see them start. For thirty miles they kept abreast;\r\nthen the _Oregon_ gained half a length and in passing the other boat\r\nbumped into her, damaging her wheelhouse. It was said at the time that\r\nthe disaster was not wholly an accident. Certainly there were grounds\r\nfor suspicion. As you may imagine, the calamity roused the rage of the\r\ncompeting boat. But the commander of the _Oregon_ was undaunted by what\r\nhe had done. All he wished was to win the race and that he was\r\ndetermined to do. He got up a higher and higher pressure of steam, and\r\nused more and more coal until, when it was time to return to New York,\r\nhe discovered that his supply had given out and that he had no more\r\nfuel."\r\n\r\n"And he had to give up the race?" queried Dick breathlessly.\r\n\r\n"Not he! He wasn\'t the giving-up kind," said Mr. Ackerman. "Finding\r\nnothing at hand to run his boilers with he ordered all the expensive\r\nfittings of the boat to be torn up and cast into the fire--woodwork,\r\nfurniture, carvings; anything that would burn. In that way he kept up\r\nhis furious rate of speed and came in victorious by the rather close\r\nmargin of twelve hundred feet."\r\n\r\n"Bully for him!" cried Dick.\r\n\r\nBut Stephen did not echo the applause.\r\n\r\n"It was not a square race," he said, "and he had no right to win.\r\nAnyway, his steamboat must have been pretty well ruined."\r\n\r\n"I fancy it was an expensive triumph," owned Mr. Ackerman. "Without\r\ndoubt it cost much more than the thousand dollars he won to repair the\r\nvessel. Still, he had the glory, and perhaps it was worth it to the\r\ncompany."\r\n\r\n"Were there other races like that?" Dick asked.\r\n\r\n"Yes, for years the racing went on until there were so many fires,\r\nexplosions and collisions, that the steamer inspection law was put\r\nthrough to regulate the conditions of travel. It certainly was high time\r\nthat something was done to protect the public, too, for such universal\r\nrecklessness prevailed that everybody was in danger. Boats were\r\noverloaded; safety valves were plugged; boilers carried several times as\r\nmuch steam as they had any right to do, and many lives had been\r\nsacrificed before the government stepped in and put a stop to this\r\nstrife for fame and money. Since then the traffic on the Hudson has\r\ndropped to a plane of sanity and is now carried on by fine lines of\r\nboats that conform to the rules for safety and efficient service."\r\n\r\n"And what became of Mr. Vanderbilt?" interrogated Dick, who was a New\r\nYorker to the core and had no mind to lose sight of the name with which\r\nhe was familiar.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mr. Vanderbilt was a man who had many irons in the fire," replied\r\nMr. Ackerman, smiling at the boy\'s eagerness. "He did not need to be\r\npitied for just about this time gold was discovered in California and as\r\nthe interest of the country swung in that direction Vanderbilt, ever\r\nquick to seize an opening wherever it presented itself, withdrew some of\r\nhis steamers from the Hudson and headed them around to the Pacific coast\r\ninstead."\r\n\r\n"And your family, Mr. Ackerman, were mixed up in all this steamboat\r\nrumpus?" commented Steve suddenly.\r\n\r\n"Yes, my grandfather was one of the Hudson River racers and quite as bad\r\nas the rest of them," the man replied. "Nevertheless he was a stanch,\r\nclever old fellow, and because he did his part toward building up the\r\ncommerce and prosperity of the nation I have always regarded him with\r\nthe warmest respect. I do not approve of all his methods, however, any\r\nmore than I approve of many of the cut-throat business methods of to-day\r\nwhich sometime will be looked back upon with as much shame as these have\r\nbeen. There are moments, I must confess, when I wonder if we, with all\r\nour supposed enlightenment, have made any very appreciable advance over\r\nthe frank and open racing done by our forefathers on the Hudson,"\r\nreflected he half-humorously. "Perhaps we are a trifle more humane; and\r\nyet there is certainly much to be desired in the way we still sacrifice\r\nthe public to our greed for money. An evil sometimes has to come to a\r\nclimax to make us conscious of our injustice. Let us hope that our\r\ngeneration will not be so blind that it will not heed the warnings of\r\nits conscience, and instead delay until some such catastrophe comes upon\r\nit as pursued the racing boats of the Hudson River."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE ROMANCE OF THE CLIPPER SHIP\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was with genuine regret that Mr. Tolman and Stephen parted from Mr.\r\nAckerman and Dick when the train reached New Haven.\r\n\r\n"We shall not say good-by to Dick," Mr. Tolman declared, "for he is not\r\nto be very far away and I hope sometime he will come to Coventry and\r\nspend a holiday with us. Why don\'t you plan to do that too, Ackerman?\r\nRun over from New York for Thanksgiving and bring the boy with you. Why\r\nnot?"\r\n\r\n"That is very kind of you."\r\n\r\n"But I mean it," persisted Mr. Tolman. "It is no perfunctory invitation.\r\nPlan to do it. We should all be delighted to have you. There is nothing\r\nin the world Mrs. Tolman loves better than a houseful of guests. Doris\r\nwill be home from college and I should like you to see what a fine big\r\ndaughter I have. As for Steve--"\r\n\r\n"I wish you would come, Mr. Ackerman," interrupted the boy.\r\n\r\nMr. Ackerman hesitated.\r\n\r\n"I tell you what we\'ll do," replied he at length. "We\'ll leave it to\r\nDick. If he makes a good record at school and earns the holiday we will\r\naccept your invitation. If he doesn\'t we won\'t come. Is that a bargain,\r\nyoungster?" he concluded, turning to the lad at his side.\r\n\r\nThe boy flushed.\r\n\r\n"It is a rather stiff one, sir," he answered, with a laughing glance.\r\n\r\n"I think that\'s playing for too high stakes, Ackerman," Mr. Tolman\r\nobjected. "It is a little rough to put all the burden on Dick. Suppose\r\nwe divide up the responsibility and foist half of it on Stephen? Let us\r\nsay you will come if both boys make good in their studies and conduct."\r\n\r\nDick drew a breath of relief at the words, regarding the speaker with\r\ngratitude.\r\n\r\n"That is a squarer deal, isn\'t it?" continued Mr. Tolman.\r\n\r\n"I think so--yes," was Dick\'s response.\r\n\r\n"And you, Steve--do you subscribe to the contract?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I\'ll sign," grinned Stephen.\r\n\r\n"Then the agreement is clinched," exclaimed his father, "and it will be\r\nthe fault of you two young persons if we do not have a jolly reunion at\r\nThanksgiving time. Good-by Ackerman! Good-by, Dick. Good luck to you! We\r\nare pinning our faith on you, remember. Don\'t disappoint us."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll try not to," the boy answered, as he stepped to the platform.\r\n\r\n"Dick is a fine, manly young chap," observed Mr. Tolman, after the train\r\nwas once more under way and he and Stephen were alone. "I have a\r\nfeeling that he is going to make good, too. All he needed was a chance.\r\nHe has splendid stuff in him. There isn\'t a mean bone in his body."\r\n\r\nStephen moved uncomfortably in his chair and a guilty blush rose to his\r\ncheek but apparently his father did not notice it.\r\n\r\n"You liked Mr. Ackerman also, didn\'t you, son? Indeed there is no need\r\nto ask for he is a genius with young people and no boy could help liking\r\na man of his type. It is a pity he hasn\'t a dozen children, or isn\'t the\r\nleader of a boy\'s school."\r\n\r\n"He is corking at story-telling!" was Steve\'s comment.\r\n\r\n"He certainly is. I caught some fragments of his Hudson River tale and\r\ndid not wonder that it fascinated you. What a remarkable era that was!"\r\nhe mused.\r\n\r\n"There were a lot of questions I wanted to ask him," Stephen said.\r\n\r\n"Such as?"\r\n\r\n"Well, for one thing I was curious to know what happened after the\r\nsteamers on the Hudson were proved a success."\r\n\r\n"I can answer that question," replied his father promptly. "After the\r\nriver boats had demonstrated their practicability steamships were built\r\nfor traffic along short distances of the coast. Owing to the War of 1812\r\nand the danger to our shipping from the British, however, the launching\r\nof these new lines did not take place immediately; but in time the\r\nroutes were established. The first of these was from New York to New\r\nHaven. You see, travel by steam power was still so much of a novelty\r\nthat Norwich, first proposed as a destination, was felt to be too far\r\naway. It was like taking one\'s life in one\'s hands to venture such an\r\nimmense distance from land on a steamboat."\r\n\r\nStephen smiled with amusement.\r\n\r\n"But gradually," continued Mr. Tolman, "the public as well as the\r\nsteamboat companies became more daring and a line from New York to\r\nProvidence, with Vanderbilt\'s _Lexington_ as one of the ships, was put\r\ninto operation. Then in 1818 a line of steamers to sail the Great Lakes\r\nwas built; and afterwards steamships to travel to points along the Maine\r\ncoast. The problem of navigation on the rivers of the interior of the\r\ncountry followed and here a new conundrum in steamboat construction\r\nconfronted the builders, for the channels of many of the streams were\r\nshallow and in consequence demanded a type of boat very long and wide in\r\nproportion to its depth of hull. After such a variety of boat had been\r\nworked out and constructed, lines were established on several of the\r\nlarge rivers, and immediately the same old spirit of rivalry that\r\npervaded the Hudson years before cropped up in these other localities.\r\nBitter competition, for example, raged between the boats that plied up\r\nand down the Mississippi; and in 1870 a very celebrated race took place\r\nbetween the _Natchez_ and the _Robert E. Lee_. The distance to be\r\ncovered was 1218 miles and the latter ship made it in three days,\r\neighteen hours, and thirty minutes. The test, however, was not a totally\r\nfair one since the _Natchez_ ran into a fog that held her up for six\r\nhours. But the event illustrates the keen interest with which men\r\nfollowed the progress of American shipping; and you can see how natural\r\nit was that after the river boats, lake steamers, coastwise vessels and\r\ntugs had had their day the next logical step (and very prodigious one)\r\nwas the--"\r\n\r\n"The ocean liner!" ejaculated Stephen.\r\n\r\n"Precisely!" nodded his father. "Now there are two separate romances of\r\nour ocean-going ships. The first one is of the sailing vessels and is a\r\nchronicle of adventure and bravery as enthralling as any you could wish\r\nto read. I wish I had time to tell it to you in full and do it justice,\r\nbut I fear I can only sketch in a few of the facts and leave you to read\r\nthe rest by yourself some time. You probably know already that whalers\r\nwent out from Gloucester, New Bedford, and various of our eastern ports\r\nand often were gone on two or three-year cruises; and when you recall\r\nthat in those early days there not only was no wireless but not even the\r\ncharts, lighthouses, and signals of a thoroughly surveyed coast you will\r\nappreciate that setting forth on such a voyage for whale-oil (then used\r\nalmost exclusively for lighting purposes) took courage. Of course the\r\ncaptains of the ships had compasses for the compass came into use just\r\nbefore the beginning of the Fifteenth Century and was one of the things\r\nthat stimulated the Portuguese and Spaniards to start out on voyages of\r\ndiscovery. The Spaniards built ships that were then considered the\r\nlargest and finest afloat, and probably Columbus caught the enthusiasm\r\nof the period and with the newly invented compass to guide him was\r\nstirred to brave the ocean and discover other territory to add to the\r\nriches of the land he loved. It was a golden age of romance and\r\nadventure and the journeys of Columbus grew out of it quite naturally.\r\nBut in America shipping had its foundation in no such picturesque\r\nbeginning. The first vessel made in this country was constructed as a\r\nmere matter of necessity, being built at the mouth of the Kennebec River\r\nto carry back to England a group of disheartened, homesick settlers."\r\n\r\nHe paused thoughtfully a moment.\r\n\r\n"Even the ships of later date had their birth in the same motive--that\r\nof necessity. The early colonists were forced to procure supplies from\r\nEngland and they had no choice but to build ships for that purpose. At\r\nfirst these sailing packets were very small, and as one thinks of them\r\nto-day it is to marvel that they ever made so many trips without\r\nfoundering. As for our coastwise ships, up to 1812 they were nothing\r\nmore than schooner-rigged hulls."\r\n\r\n"I wonder where the word _schooner_ came from," commented Steve.\r\n\r\n"The legend goes that the term _scoon_ was a colloquialism used when\r\nskipping stones. When a pebble glanced along the top of the water it was\r\nsaid to _scoon_," answered his father, with a smile. "After the War of\r\n1812 was over and our American vessels were safe from possible attack,\r\nand after the country itself had recovered somewhat from the stress of\r\nthis financial burden so that men had more money to invest in commerce,\r\nwe began to branch out and build finer vessels; and when it came to\r\nrigging them there seemed to be no name to apply to the arrangement of\r\nthe sails. The story goes that one day as one of these new ships sailed\r\nout of Gloucester harbor a fisherman watching her exclaimed with\r\nadmiration, \'See her _scoon_!\' The phrase not only caught the public\r\nfancy but that of the shipbuilders as well, and the word _schooner_ was\r\nquickly adopted."\r\n\r\n"I never knew that before!" announced Steve, when the narrative was\r\nconcluded.\r\n\r\n"Slowly the models of ships improved," went on his father, without\r\nheeding the interruption. "Vessels became larger, faster, more graceful.\r\nEven the whalers and fishing smacks took on more delicate lines.\r\nMerchants from Salem, Gloucester, New Bedford invested their hard-earned\r\nsavings in whalers and trading ships, and many of them made their\r\nfortunes by so doing. The sailing packets that went to Liverpool began\r\nto make excellent time records. Although the English were now using\r\nsteamers for trans-Atlantic travel they had not perfected them to a\r\nsufficient extent to make their trips faster than those of sailing\r\nships."\r\n\r\n"About how long did it take them to cross?" inquired Stephen.\r\n\r\n"The average time to Liverpool was from nineteen to twenty-one days,"\r\nwas the answer. "And for the return voyage from thirty to thirty-five."\r\n\r\n"Whew, Dad! Why, one could walk it in that time!" exclaimed the lad.\r\n\r\n"It was a long time," his father agreed. "But it is not fair to measure\r\nit by present-day standards. Think how novel a thing it was to cross the\r\nocean at all!"\r\n\r\n"I suppose so," came reflectively from Stephen.\r\n\r\n"It was not long," continued his father, "before the English improved\r\ntheir engines so that their steamers made better time, and then our\r\nAmerican sailing packets were left far behind. This, as you can imagine,\r\ndid not please our proud and ambitious colonists who were anxious to\r\nincrease their commerce and build up their young and growing country.\r\nSomething must be done! As yet they had not mastered the enigma of steam\r\nbut they could make their sailing ships swifter and finer and this they\r\nset to work to do. Out of this impetus for prosperity came the\r\nremarkable clipper-ship era.\r\n\r\n"We shall probably never see such beautiful ships again," continued Mr.\r\nTolman, a trifle sadly. "Youth and romance go hand in hand, and our\r\ncountry was very young, and proud and eager in those days. Our commerce\r\nwas only beginning and the far corners of the world were strange,\r\nunexplored and alluring. It is like an Arabian Night\'s Tale to read of\r\nthose wonderful ships built to carry merchandise to China, India and\r\nother foreign ports. Speed was their aim--speed, speed, speed! They must\r\nhold their own against the English steamers if they would keep their\r\nplace on the seas. For in those days the methods of packing produce were\r\nvery primitive, and it was imperative that such perishable things as\r\ntea, dried fruits, spices and coffee should be rushed to the markets\r\nbefore the dampness spoiled them. If they mildewed they would be a dead\r\nloss to the merchants handling them. Moreover as cable and telegraph\r\nwere unknown there was no way to keep in touch with the demands of the\r\npublic, or be sure of prices. Therefore every merchant hurried his goods\r\nhome in the hope of being the first in the field and reaping the largest\r\nprofits."\r\n\r\n"More racing!" exclaimed Stephen.\r\n\r\n"It was racing, indeed!" returned his father. "Ships raced one another\r\nback from China, each trying desperately to discharge her cargo before\r\nher rival did. Like great sea-birds these beautiful boats skimmed the\r\nwaves, stretching every inch of canvas to be the winner at the goal. As\r\na result the slow merchant packets with their stale cargoes could find\r\nno patrons, the clippers commanding not only all the trade but the\r\nhighest prices for produce as well. Silks, chinaware, ivory,\r\nbamboo--all the wealth of the Orient began to arrive in America where\r\nit was hungrily bought up, many a man making his fortune in the East\r\nIndia trade. Of this fascinating epoch Hawthorne gives us a vivid\r\npicture."\r\n\r\n"It must have been great to travel on one of those ships!" said Stephen.\r\n\r\n"It was not all pleasure, by any means, son," Mr. Tolman replied. "Often\r\nthe vessels encountered hurricanes and typhoons in the treacherous\r\nEastern waters. Sometimes ships were blown out of their course and\r\nwrecked, or cast ashore on islands where their crews became the prey of\r\ncannibals."\r\n\r\n"Jove!"\r\n\r\n"It had its outs--this cruising to distant ports," announced his father.\r\n"Moreover, the charts in use were still imperfect and lighthouse\r\nprotection was either very scanty or was lacking entirely."\r\n\r\n"What became of the clipper ships?"\r\n\r\n"Well, we Americans never do anything by halves, you know. When we go in\r\nwe go in all over," laughed his father. "That is what we did with our\r\nclipper ships. We were so pleased with them that we built more and more,\r\nsending them everywhere we could think of. Many went around to\r\nCalifornia to carry merchandise to the gold searchers. At last there\r\nwere so many of these swift vessels that they cut into one another and\r\nfreight rates dropped. Besides, steamboats were coming into general use\r\nand were now running on all the more important ocean routes. The day of\r\nthe sailing ship was over and the marvelous vessels were compelled to\r\nyield their place to the heralds of progress and become things of the\r\npast. Nevertheless, their part in our American commerce will never be\r\nforgotten and we have them to thank not only for the fame they brought\r\nour country but also for much of its wealth."\r\n\r\nWith a quick gesture of surprise he rose hurriedly.\r\n\r\n"See!" he exclaimed. "We are almost home. We have talked \'ships and\r\nsealing-wax\' for hours."\r\n\r\n"It hasn\'t seemed for hours," retorted Stephen, springing to collect his\r\nluggage.\r\n\r\n"Nor to me, either."\r\n\r\n"Some time I\'d like to hear about the ocean liners," ventured the boy.\r\n\r\n"You must get Mr. Ackerman to tell you that story when he comes to visit\r\nus Thanksgiving," was the reply, "if he _does_ come. That part of it\r\nseems to be up to you and Dick."\r\n\r\n"I mean to do my part to get him here," Steve announced. "I hope Dick\r\nwill plug, too."\r\n\r\n"I rather think you can trust him for that," was the quiet answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nAGAIN THE MAGIC DOOR OPENS\r\n\r\n\r\nA change of trains and a brief hour\'s journey brought the travelers\r\nsafely to Coventry where Havens met them with the automobile.\r\n\r\n"This will be our last ride this fall," observed Mr. Tolman, as he\r\nloitered on the platform while the luggage was being lifted into the\r\ncar. "We shall have to put the motor up in a day or two. It will not\r\nneed much of an overhauling in the way of repairs this season, I guess,\r\nfor it is comparatively new and should be in pretty good condition.\r\nThere may be a few slight things necessary but nothing much. Isn\'t that\r\nso, Havens?"\r\n\r\n"It is badly scratched, sir."\r\n\r\n"Scratched!"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir--both inside and out. I wonder you haven\'t noticed it. Still\r\nyou wouldn\'t unless you got it in just the right light. I did not myself\r\nat first. There are terrible scratches everywhere. You would think ten\r\nmen had climbed all over it. Look!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, it can\'t be so bad as all that," laughed Mr. Tolman good-humoredly,\r\nevidently not taking the chauffeur\'s comment seriously. "The car was\r\nnew in the spring and we have not given it very hard wear. What little\r\nluggage we have carried has been carefully put in; I have seen to that\r\nmyself. Only a short time ago I thought how splendidly fresh the varnish\r\nlooked. In fact, I examined it just before you were ill. It can\'t have\r\nbecome very much defaced since then for we have not had the car out of\r\nthe garage except for one short excursion."\r\n\r\nHavens\' brow darkened into a puzzled frown.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t understand it at all, sir," he replied. "I could swear the\r\nscratches were not there when I went away. If you didn\'t tell me\r\nyourself the car hadn\'t been used much I\'d stake my oath it had had a\r\ngreat deal of knocking about while I was gone. Look here, Mr. Tolman!\r\nLook at that, and that, and that--great digs in the paint as if people\r\nwith boots on had climbed over the sides."\r\n\r\nMr. Tolman looked and so, with a sinking heart, did Stephen.\r\n\r\n"Mercy on us! I never noticed all this before!" cried Mr. Tolman, in\r\nconsternation. "What in the world--" he stopped as if he could find no\r\nwords to voice his amazement. "Look at this!" He placed a finger on a\r\nbroad, clearly defined line that extended from the top of the tonneau to\r\nthe bottom. "You would think somebody had dug his heels in here and then\r\nslid down until he reached the ground! And this! What on earth has\r\nhappened to the thing, Havens? It looks as if it had been used for a\r\ngymnasium."\r\n\r\nHot and cold by turns, Steve listened. The marks to which his father\r\npointed told a truthful story. Somebody had braced his heels against the\r\nside and then slid to the ground; it was Bud Taylor. And that other\r\njagged line indicated where Tim Barclay had scrambled over the edge and\r\nmade his hurried exit. The history of the whole miserable adventure was\r\netched in the varnish as vividly as if it had been traced there in\r\nwords. Stephen gasped with horror when he saw how plainly the entire\r\nstory stood out in the sunlight of the November day. Why, the most\r\nstupid person alive could read it! Every moment he expected that his\r\nfather or Havens would wheel on him and ask accusingly:\r\n\r\n"When was it you carried all those boys to Torrington?"\r\n\r\nHe could hear his heart thumping inside him and feel the beat of the\r\nblood that scorched his cheek. He had not pictured a dilemma like this.\r\nThe affair had gone off so smoothly that he had flattered himself every\r\npossibility of discovery was past, and in this comforting knowledge he\r\nhad basked with serenity. And now, behold, here he was at the brink of\r\nperil, and just when he had had such a glorious holiday, too!\r\n\r\n"How do you solve the riddle, Havens?" he heard his father asking.\r\n\r\n"I ain\'t solvin\' it, sir," was the drawling answer. "Maybe Steve could\r\ngive you a hint, though," he added slyly.\r\n\r\nThe lad stiffened. He and Havens had never been friends. They had been\r\nthrough too many battles for that. The chauffeur did not like boys and\r\ntook no trouble to conceal the fact, and as a result he had been the\r\nprey of many a mischievous prank. It was through his vigilance that\r\nStephen had more than once been brought to justice and in the punishment\r\nthat followed Havens had exulted without restraint. As a retaliation the\r\nboy tormented him whenever opportunity presented, the two carrying on a\r\nhalf-bitter, half-humorous feud which was a source of mutual\r\ngratification.\r\n\r\nHad not this been the case the confession that trembled on Stephen\'s\r\ntongue would doubtless have been uttered then and there. But to speak\r\nbefore Havens and afford him the chance to crow and rejoice,--that was\r\nnot to be thought of. Therefore, drawing in his chin and holding his\r\nhead a trifle higher than was his wont, he replied with hauteur:\r\n\r\n"I\'ve no solution at all to offer. How could I have?"\r\n\r\nFor the fraction of a second Mr. Tolman looked sharply at his son as if\r\nsome new thought had suddenly struck him; then the piercing scrutiny\r\nfaded from his eyes and he turned away.\r\n\r\n"Well, I guess we shall have to drop the matter for the present, anyway,\r\nand be getting home," said he. "It will do no good for us to stand here\r\nin the cold and argue. We shall be no nearer an answer. Come, jump in,\r\nSteve!"\r\n\r\nWith a strange sense of reluctance the boy obeyed. He felt the door to\r\nconfession closing with finality behind him; and now that he saw all\r\nchance for dallying on its threshold cut off, he began to regret that it\r\nshould so completely close. Once again the opportunity to clear his\r\nconscience had come about in an easy, natural manner; confession had\r\nbeen gently and tactfully invited and he had turned his back. Never\r\nagain, probably, would he have such a chance as this. Without any\r\nignominious preamble he could have spoken the few words necessary and\r\nbeen a free man! But alas, he had hesitated too long. His father\r\nfollowed him into the car, banged the door, and they shot homeward.\r\n\r\nPerhaps, temporized the lad as they rode along, he would say something\r\nwhen they reached the house. Why wasn\'t it better anyway to wait until\r\nhe and his father were quiet and alone? Who could blame him for not\r\nwanting to confess his misdemeanors before an audience? His father would\r\nunderstand and forgive his reticence, he was sure. Having lulled his\r\nconscience to rest with the assurance of this future reparation he sank\r\nback against the cushions and drew the robe closer about him. There was\r\nno use in letting the ride be spoiled by worry. He did not need to speak\r\nuntil he got back, and he needn\'t speak at all if he did not wish to. If\r\nno favorable opening occurred, why, he could still remain silent and\r\nwait a better chance. He had taken no vow, made no promise; nothing\r\nactually bound him to act unless he chose.\r\n\r\nIt was surprising how his spirits rose with this realization. He even\r\nventured to talk a little and make a joke or two. These overtures\r\nreceived only scant response from his father, however, for Mr. Tolman\'s\r\nbrow had settled into a frown and it needed no second glance to assure\r\nStephen that the happenings of the past half-hour had put the elder man\r\nvery much out of humor. How unfortunate, mused the boy, that this mood\r\nshould have come upon his father. It would take more than an ordinary\r\nmeasure of courage to approach him now. Why, it would be braving the\r\nlions, actually tempting fate to go to him with a confession when he\r\nlooked like this. Would it not be much wiser to wait?\r\n\r\nWith a sharp swerve they turned in at the gate and rolled up the long\r\ndriveway; then the front door burst open and from it issued not only\r\nMrs. Tolman and Doris but with them the girl with the wonderful hair,\r\nJane Harden, whom he had seen at Northampton. A hubbub of greeting\r\nensued and in the interchange of gay conversation all thought of\r\nconfession was swept from Stephen\'s mind.\r\n\r\nNor in the days that followed, with their round of skating, hockey,\r\nsnow-shoeing, and holiday festivities, did the inclination to revert to\r\nthe follies of the past arise. The big red touring-car was sent away\r\nwithout further allusion to its battered condition and with its\r\ndeparture the last link with the misfortunes that tormented him seemed\r\ndestroyed. Once, it is true, when he overheard his father telling his\r\nmother that the bill for repainting and varnishing the car was going to\r\nbe very large, his conscience smote him. But what, he argued, could he\r\ndo? Even were he to come forward now and shoulder the blame it would not\r\nreduce the expense of which his father complained. He had no money.\r\nTherefore he decided it was better to close his ears and try and forget\r\nthe entire affair. His father had evidently accepted the calamity with\r\nresignation and made up his mind to bear the consequences without\r\nfurther demur. Why not let the matter rest there? At this late date it\r\nwould be absurd to speak, especially when it could not alter the\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime letters came from Mr. Ackerman and from Dick. The latter\r\nwas very happy at the New Haven school and was making quite a record for\r\nhimself, and it was easy to detect between the lines of the steamboat\r\nmagnate\'s epistle that he was much gratified by the progress of his\r\nprot\xc3\xa9g\xc3\xa9. Thanksgiving would soon be here and if the Tolmans still\r\nextended their invitation for the holidays the two New Yorkers would be\r\nglad to accept it.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll write Ackerman to-day," announced Mr. Tolman at breakfast. "The\r\ninvitation has hung on Stephen and Dick, and I am glad to say they each\r\nhave made good. How fine that that little East Side chap should have\r\nturned out so well! I don\'t wonder Ackerman is pleased. Everybody does\r\nnot get appreciation in return for kindness. I know many a parent whose\r\nchildren repay what is done for them only with sneaking, unworthy\r\nconduct and utter ingratitude. Dick may not have been born into\r\nprosperity but he is a thoroughbred at heart and it shows in his\r\nactions. He is every inch a gentleman."\r\n\r\nAt the words Stephen\'s blood tingled.\r\n\r\nWhat would his father think of him if he knew what a mean-spirited\r\ncoward he was? Well, it was impossible to tell him now. It would upset\r\nthe whole Thanksgiving party.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nMORE STEAMBOATING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe night before Thanksgiving Mr. Ackerman and Dick arrived at Coventry\r\nand it was difficult to believe the change wrought in the New York boy.\r\nNot only was his face round, rosy and radiant with happiness but along\r\nwith a new manliness had stolen a gentler bearing and a courtesy that\r\nhad not been there when he had set forth to school.\r\n\r\n"Why, you must have put on ten pounds, Dick!" cried Mr. Tolman, shaking\r\nhands with his young guest after greeting the steamboat magnate.\r\n\r\n"It is eleven pounds, sir," laughed Dick. "We have bully eats at school\r\nand all you want of them."\r\n\r\nThe final phrase had a reminiscent ring as if it harked back to a time\r\nwhen three ample meals were a mirage of the imagination.\r\n\r\n"Well, I am glad to hear you have done justice to them and encouraged\r\nthe cook," was Mr. Tolman\'s jocular reply. "Now while you stay here you\r\nmust cheer on our cook in the same fashion. If you don\'t we shall think\r\nyou like New Haven better."\r\n\r\n"I guess there is no danger of that," put in Mr. Ackerman. "Dick seems\r\nhollow down to his ankles. There is no filling him up; is there, boy?"\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t eat that third ice-cream you offered me yesterday," was the\r\nhumorous retort.\r\n\r\n"I hope you\'ve saved some room for to-morrow\'s dinner," Mrs. Tolman\r\ninterrupted, "for there will be mince pie and plum pudding and I don\'t\r\nknow what not. And then there is the turkey--we ordered an extra large\r\none on purpose."\r\n\r\nDick and Steve exchanged a sheepish grin.\r\n\r\n"Well, it is jolly to see you good people," Mr. Tolman declared, as he\r\nushered the visitors into the living room, where a bright fire burned on\r\nthe hearth. "Our boys have done well, haven\'t they, Ackerman? I don\'t\r\nknow which is to win the scholarship race--the steamboats or the\r\nrailroads."\r\n\r\n"We could compare marks," Stephen suggested.\r\n\r\n"That would hardly be fair," Mr. Ackerman objected quickly, "for the\r\nsteamboats did not start even with the railroads in this contest. Dick\r\nhas had to put in a lot of hours with a tutor to make up for the work he\r\nmissed at the beginning of the year. He has been compelled to bone down\r\nlike a beaver to go ahead with his class; but he has succeeded, haven\'t\r\nyou, sonny?"\r\n\r\n"I hope I have," was the modest retort.\r\n\r\n"Furthermore," went on Mr. Ackerman, "there are other things beside\r\nscholarship to be considered in this bargain. We want fine, manly boys\r\nas well as wise ones. Conduct counts for a great deal, you know."\r\n\r\nStephen felt himself coloring.\r\n\r\n"There have been no black marks on Dick\'s record thus far. How about\r\nyours, Steve?" asked the New York man.\r\n\r\n"I--er--no. I haven\'t had any black marks, either," responded Stephen,\r\nwith a gulp of shame.\r\n\r\n"That is splendid, isn\'t it!" commented Mr. Ackerman. "I wasn\'t looking\r\nfor them. You have too fine a father to be anything but a square boy."\r\n\r\nOnce more Stephen knew himself to be blushing. If they would only talk\r\nabout something else!\r\n\r\n"Are you going to finish your steamboat story for us while you are\r\nhere?" inquired he with sudden inspiration.\r\n\r\n"Why, I had not thought of doing any steamboating down here," laughed\r\nthe capitalist. "Rather I came to help the Pilgrims celebrate their\r\nfirst harvest."\r\n\r\n"But even they had to come to America by boat," suggested Doris\r\nmischievously.\r\n\r\n"I admit that," owned the New Yorker. "And what is more, they probably\r\nwould have come in a steamboat if one had been running at the time."\r\n\r\n"What was the first American steamship to cross the Atlantic, Ackerman?"\r\nquestioned Mr. Tolman when they were all seated before the library fire.\r\n\r\n"I suppose the _Savannah_ had that distinction," was the reply. "She was\r\nbuilt in New York in 1818 to be used as a sailing packet; but she had\r\nside wheels and an auxiliary engine, and although she did not make the\r\nentire trans-Atlantic distance by steam she did cover a part of it\r\nunder steam power. Her paddle wheels, it is interesting to note, were so\r\nconstructed that they could be unshipped and taken aboard when they were\r\nnot in use, or when the weather was rough. I believe it took her\r\ntwenty-seven days to make the trip from Savannah to Liverpool and eighty\r\nhours of that time she was using her engine. Although she made several\r\ntrips in safety it was quite a while before the American public was\r\nsufficiently convinced of the value of steam to build other steamships.\r\nA few small ones appeared in our harbors, it is true, but they came from\r\nNorway or England; they made much better records, too, than anything\r\npreviously known, the _Sirius_ crossing in 1838 in nineteen days, and\r\nthe _Great Western_ in fifteen. In the meantime shipbuilders on both\r\nsides of the Atlantic were studying the steamboat problem and busy\r\nbrains in Nova Scotia and on the Clyde were working out an answer to the\r\npuzzle. One of the most alert of these brains belonged to Samuel Cunard,\r\nthe founder of the steamship line that has since become world famous. In\r\nMay, 1840, through his instrumentality, the _Unicorn_ set out from\r\nEngland for Boston arriving in the harbor June third after a voyage of\r\nsixteen days. When we reflect that she was a wooden side-wheeler, not\r\nmuch larger than one of our tugboats, we marvel that she ever put in her\r\nappearance. Tidings of her proposed trip had already preceded her, and\r\nwhen after much anxious watching she was sighted there was the greatest\r\nenthusiasm along the water front, the over-zealous populace who wished\r\nto give her a royal welcome setting off a six-pounder in her honor that\r\nshattered to atoms most of her stained glass as she tied up at the\r\ndock."\r\n\r\nHis audience laughed.\r\n\r\n"You see," continued the capitalist, "the ship came in answer to a\r\ncircular sent out by our government to various shipbuilders asking bids\r\nfrom swift and reliable boats to carry our mails to England. Cunard\r\nimmediately saw the commercial advantages of such an opportunity, and\r\nnot having money enough to back the venture himself the Halifax man went\r\nto Scotland where he met Robert Napier, a person who like himself had\r\nhad wide experience in shipping affairs. Both men were enthusiastic over\r\nthe project; before long the money necessary for the undertaking was\r\nraised, and the British and North American Royal Mail Steam Packet\r\nCompany, with a line of four ships, was awarded the United States\r\nGovernment contract. These ships were very significantly named: the\r\n_Britannia_ in honor of England, the _Arcadia_ as a compliment to Mr.\r\nCunard\'s Nova Scotia home, the _Caledonia_ in memory of Napier\'s Scotch\r\nancestry, and the _Columbia_ out of regard to America. And in passing it\r\nis rather interesting to recall that in homage to these pioneer ships it\r\nhas become a tradition of the Cunard Line to use names that terminate in\r\nthe letter _a_ for all the ships that have followed them. For, you must\r\nremember, it was this modest group of steam packets that were the\r\nancestors of such magnificent boats as the _Mauretania_ and\r\n_Lusitania_."\r\n\r\n"There was some difference!" interrupted Stephen.\r\n\r\n"Well, rather! Had you, however, told Samuel Cunard then that such\r\nmammoth floating hotels were possible he would probably not have\r\nbelieved you. He had task enough on his hands to carry the mails;\r\ntransport the few venturesome souls that dared to cross the sea; and\r\ncompete with the many rival steamship lines that sprang up on both sides\r\nof the ocean as soon as some one had demonstrated that trans-Atlantic\r\ntravel was practical. For after Cunard had blazed the path there were\r\nplenty of less daring persons ready to steal from him the fruits of his\r\nvision and courage. From 1847 to 1857 the Ocean Steamship Company\r\ncarried mails between New York and Bremen, and there was a very popular\r\nline that ran from New York to Havre, up to the period of the Civil War.\r\nAmong the individual ships none, perhaps, was more celebrated than the\r\n_Great Eastern_, a vessel of tremendous length, and one that more nearly\r\napproached our present-day liners as to size. Then there was the Collins\r\nLine that openly competed with the Cunard Line; and to further increase\r\ntrans-Atlantic travel, in 1855 Cornelius Vanderbilt, ever at the fore in\r\nnovel projects, began operating lines of steamships not only to England\r\nand France but to Bremen."\r\n\r\nMr. Ackerman paused a moment.\r\n\r\n"By 1871 there was an American line between Philadelphia and Liverpool.\r\nIn the meantime, ever since 1861, there had been a slow but steady\r\nadvance in ocean shipbuilding. Although iron ships had gradually\r\nreplaced wooden ones the side-wheeler was still in vogue, no better\r\nmethod of locomotion having been discovered. When the change from this\r\nprimitive device to the screw propeller came it was a veritable leap in\r\nnaval architecture. Now revolutions in any direction seldom receive a\r\nwelcome and just as the conservatives had at first hooted down the idea\r\nof iron ships, asserting they would never float, so they now decried the\r\nuse of the screw propeller. Indeed there was no denying that this\r\ninnovation presented to shipbuilders a multitude of new and balking\r\nproblems. While the clipper ships had greatly improved the designs of\r\nvessels the stern was still their weakest point and now, in addition to\r\nthis already existing difficulty, came the new conundrums presented by\r\nthe pitch, or full turn of the thread, in the screw propeller; also the\r\nchurning of the current produced by the rapidly whirling wheel, which\r\nwas found to retard the speed of the ship very materially. Valiantly\r\nengineers wrestled with one after another of these enigmas until they\r\nconquered them and put shipbuilding on the upward path where it has been\r\never since. In time steel ships replaced the cruder vessels of iron;\r\nfiner types of engines were worked out; the wireless and the many\r\nelectrical devices which herald approaching foes and announce the\r\npresence of icebergs have been invented; until now the ocean liner is\r\npractically safe from all perils except fogs, icebergs and submarines."\r\n\r\nHe stopped a moment with eyes fixed on the glowing logs that crackled on\r\nthe hearth.\r\n\r\n"Meanwhile," he went on, "comfort aboard ship has progressed to luxury.\r\nBetter systems of ventilation, more roomy sleeping quarters, more\r\nwindows and improved lighting facilities have been installed. The\r\ngeneral arrangement of the ship has also been vastly improved since the\r\ndays when the high bulwark and long deckhouse were in use. Now iron\r\nrailings allow the sea to wash back and forth in time of storm, and in\r\nconsequence there is less danger of vessels being swamped by the waves.\r\nThen there are watertight doors and bulkheads, double bottoms to the\r\nhulls, and along with these more practical advances have come others of\r\na more healthful and artistic trend. The furniture is better; the\r\ndecoration of the cabins and saloons prettier and more harmonious; there\r\nhas been more hygienic sanitation. When the _Oceanic_ of the White Star\r\nLine was built in 1870 she had a second deck, and this novel feature was\r\nadopted broadcast and eventually ushered in the many-deck liners now in\r\nuse. The _Servia_, built in 1881, was the first steel ship and the\r\nadvantage of its greater elasticity was instantly seen. Builders were\r\nwise enough to grasp the fact that with the increasing length of\r\nvessels steel ships would be able to stand a greater strain. Little by\r\nlittle the gain went on in every direction. Nevertheless, in spite of\r\nthe intelligence of the shipbuilders, it was long before trans-Atlantic\r\nnavigators had the courage to trust themselves entirely to their engines\r\nand discard masts; although they shifted to steel ones instead of those\r\nof iron or wood, they still persisted in carrying them."\r\n\r\nHe smiled as he spoke.\r\n\r\n"When the twin-screw propeller made its appearance it brought with it\r\ngreater speed and there was a revival of the old racing spirit. Between\r\nthe various shipping lines of all nations the contest for size and\r\nswiftness has raged ever since. Before the Great War, Germany had a very\r\nextensive collection of large and rapid liners, many of them built on\r\nthe Clyde, that fought to surpass the Cunard ships. The White Star Line\r\nalso took a hand in the game and built others. In the contest, alas,\r\nAmerica has been far behind until gradually she has let other countries\r\nslip in and usurp the major proportion of ocean commerce. It is a\r\npitiful thing that we should not have applied our skill and wealth of\r\nmaterial to building fine American steamship lines of our own instead of\r\nletting so many of our tourists turn their patronage to ships of foreign\r\nnations. Perhaps if the public were not so eager for novelty, and so\r\nconstantly in search for the newest, the largest and the fastest boats,\r\nwe should be content to make our crossings in the older and less gaudy\r\nships, which after all are quite as seaworthy. But we Americans must\r\nalways have the superlative, and therefore many a steamer has had to be\r\nscrapped simply because it had no palm gardens, no swimming pools, no\r\nshore luxuries. We have not, however, wholly neglected naval\r\nconstruction for we have many fine steamships, a praiseworthy lot of\r\nbattleships and cruisers and some very fine submarines. I hope and\r\nbelieve that the time will come when our merchant marine will once again\r\nstand at the front as it did in the days of the clipper ships. Our\r\ncommerce reaches out to every corner of the earth and why should we rely\r\non other countries to transport our goods?"\r\n\r\n"I suppose there are no pirates now, are there, Mr. Ackerman?" asked\r\nDick, raising his eyes expectantly to the capitalist\'s face.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid there are very few, Dick boy," returned the elder man\r\nkindly. "I suppose that is somewhat of a disappointment to you. You\r\nwould have preferred to sail the seas in the days when every small liner\r\ncarried her guns as a defence against raiders and was often forced to\r\nuse them, too. But when international law began to regulate traffic on\r\nthe high seas and the ocean thoroughfare ceased to be such a deserted\r\none pirates went out of fashion, and every nation was granted equal\r\nrights to sail the seas unmolested. It was because this freedom was\r\nmenaced by German submarines in the late war and our privilege to travel\r\nby water threatened that our nation refused to tolerate such\r\nconditions. A code of humane laws that had been established for the\r\nuniversal good was being broken and we could not permit it. For you must\r\nremember that now there are almost as many laws on the ocean as on the\r\nland. There are rules for all kinds of vessels, of which there are a far\r\ngreater variety than perhaps you realize. Not only have we steamships,\r\ncruisers, and battleships but we have schooners, barques, brigs,\r\ntugboats, dredgers, oil-tankers, turret ships for freight, cargo boats,\r\nsteam tramps, coalers, produce ships, ice-breakers, train ferries, steam\r\ntrawlers, fire boats, river boats, harbor excursion boats, coasters,\r\nwhalebacks, steam yachts, launches and lake steamers. Each of these is\r\ncarefully classified and has its particular traffic rules, and in\r\naddition to these is obliged to obey certain other general marine laws\r\nto which all of them are subject, in order that travel by water may be\r\nmade safe."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t all ships have to be inspected, too?" asked Stephen.\r\n\r\n"Yes; and not only are they inspected but to protect the lives of their\r\npassengers and crew, as well as preserve their cargo, they must adhere\r\nto specified conditions. The number of passengers and crew is regulated\r\nby law, as is the amount of the cargo. Ocean liners, for example, must\r\nhave aboard a certain number of lifeboats, rafts, belts, life\r\npreservers, fire extinguishers, lines of hose; and the size of all these\r\nis carefully designated. There must be frequent drills in manning the\r\nboats; the fire hose must be tested to see that it works and is in\r\nproper condition; and in thick weather the foghorns must be sounded at\r\nregular intervals. There is no such thing now as going to sea in\r\nhaphazard fashion and trusting to luck. Everything that can be done for\r\nthe safety of those who travel the ocean must be done."\r\n\r\nHe paused a moment, then added:\r\n\r\n"And in the meanwhile, that every protection possible shall be offered\r\nto ships, we have been as busy on the land as on the water and have\r\nestablished a code of laws to govern our coasts, harbors and rivers.\r\nGovernment surveys have charted the shores of all countries so that now\r\nthere are complete maps that give not only the coast line but also the\r\noutlying islands, rocks and shoals that might be a menace to ships. It\r\nis no longer possible for a State bordering on the sea to put up a low\r\nbuilding at the water\'s edge and set a few candles in the windows as was\r\ndone back in the year eighteen hundred."\r\n\r\nBoth the boys laughed.\r\n\r\n"We can laugh now," assented Mr. Ackerman with a smile, "but in those\r\ndays I fancy it was no laughing matter. Even with all our up-to-date\r\ndevices there are wrecks; and think of the ships that must have gone\r\ndown before charts were available, lighthouses and bell buoys in vogue,\r\nwireless signals invented and the coast patrol in operation. I shudder\r\nto picture it. Sailing the seas was a perilous undertaking then, I\r\nassure you. Even the first devices for safety were primitive. The\r\nArgand lamp of 1812 was not at all powerful and the lenses used were far\r\nfrom perfect. Foghorns were operated by hand or by horse power and were\r\nnot strong enough to be heard at any great distance. Bell buoys were\r\nunknown although there were such things as bell-boats which were\r\nanchored in dangerous spots and rung by the wash of the waves. There\r\nwere lightships, too, but more often than not their feeble light was\r\nobscured or unnoticed and they were run down by the ships they sought to\r\nprotect. Altogether there was room for improvement at every point and\r\nslowly but surely it came. After the Daboll trumpet, whistle and siren\r\nhad been tried finer horns operated by steam or power engines supplanted\r\nthem until now all along our coasts and inland streams signals of\r\nspecified strength have been installed, a commission deciding just what\r\nsize signals shall be used and where they shall be placed. There are\r\nlighthouses of prescribed candle power; automatic flashlights and\r\nwhistling buoys; coastguard stations with carefully drilled crews; all\r\nregulated by law and matters of compulsion. If men and ships are lost\r\nnow it is because it is beyond human power to help it."\r\n\r\n"There are facts about the water that are impossible to modify,"\r\ninterrupted Mr. Tolman, "and I suppose we shall never be able wholly to\r\neliminate the dangers growing out of them. There are for example silence\r\nzones where, because of the nature of air currents or atmospheric\r\nconditions, no sounds can be heard. Often a foghorn comparatively near\r\nat hand will belch forth its warning and its voice be swallowed up in\r\nthis strange stillness. Many a calamity has occurred that could only be\r\naccounted for in this way. Man is ingenious, it is true, but he is not\r\nomniscient and in the face of some of the caprices of nature he is\r\npowerless."\r\n\r\nMr. Ackerman rose and stood with his back to the fire.\r\n\r\n"And now," went on Mr. Tolman, addressing Stephen and Dick, "I should\r\nsay you two had had quite a lecture on steamboating and should move that\r\nyou both go to bed."\r\n\r\nQuickly Mr. Ackerman interrupted him.\r\n\r\n"I should amend the motion by suggesting that we all go to bed," laughed\r\nhe. "I am quite as tired as the boys are."\r\n\r\nThe amendment was passed, the motion carried, and soon the entire Tolman\r\nfamily was wrapped in sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nA THANKSGIVING TRAGEDY\r\n\r\n\r\nPerhaps had Stephen known what was in store for him on the morrow he\r\nmight not have slept so soundly. As it was, he and Dick had to be called\r\nthree times before they opened their eyes on the Thanksgiving sunshine.\r\nA heavy frost had fallen during the night, touching the trees with\r\nsplendor and transforming the brown earth to a jewelled sweep of gems\r\nthat flashed like brilliants in the golden light. The boys scrambled\r\ninto their clothes and, ruddy from a cold shower, descended to the\r\ndining room where amid the fragrance of steaming coffee the family were\r\njust sitting down to breakfast.\r\n\r\n"Well, what is up for to-day, boys?" inquired Mrs. Tolman, after the\r\nmore formal greetings were over. "What are you planning to do with Dick,\r\nStephen?"\r\n\r\n"We\'re going skating over to the Hollow if the ice is any good," was the\r\nprompt response. "It was fine yesterday and unless somebody has smashed\r\nit all up it ought to be good to-day."\r\n\r\n"That plan sounds rather nice, doesn\'t it, Jane?" Doris suggested to her\r\nroommate. "Why don\'t we go, too?"\r\n\r\n"I\'d like nothing better," was the answer.\r\n\r\n"The youngsters have sketched a very alluring program," Mr. Ackerman\r\nsaid. "If I had any skates I should be tempted to join them. I have not\r\nbeen on the ice in years but in my day I used to be quite a hockey\r\nplayer."\r\n\r\n"Oh, do come, Mr. Ackerman!" cried Steve eagerly. "If you used to skate\r\nit will all come back to you. It is like swimming, you know; once you\r\nhave learned you never forget how."\r\n\r\n"But I\'ve nothing to skate with," laughed the New Yorker.\r\n\r\n"Oh, we can fix you up with skates all right, if you really want to go,"\r\nMr. Tolman said. "I have a couple of pairs and am sure you could manage\r\nto use one of them."\r\n\r\n"So you are a skater, are you, Tolman?" the capitalist observed, with\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I am nothing great," Mr. Tolman protested, "but I have always\r\nenjoyed sports and muddled along at them. Coventry is quite a distance\r\nfrom Broadway, you see, and therefore we must get our recreation in\r\nother ways."\r\n\r\n"It is a darn sight better than anything New York has to offer,"\r\ncommented the other man soberly. "Good wholesome out-of-door exercise is\r\nnot to be mentioned in the same breath with a hot theater where a\r\npicture show is a makeshift for something better. Give me fresh air and\r\nexercise every time!"\r\n\r\n"Well, since that is the way you feel about it we can comply with your\r\nrequest," Mr. Tolman rejoined, with a smile. "If you do not mind\r\nhobbling back to New York lame as a cart-horse you can certainly have\r\nyour wish, for we have the ice, the skates, plenty of coats and\r\nsweaters--everything necessary. Suppose we all start for the Hollow at\r\nten o\'clock. It is a mile walk but as we are having a late dinner we\r\nshall still have a long morning."\r\n\r\n"That will suit me all right," returned Mr. Ackerman.\r\n\r\n"By the way, Henry," interrupted Mrs. Tolman, addressing her husband,\r\n"Havens is waiting to see you. He has some message for you."\r\n\r\n"Where is he?"\r\n\r\n"In the hall."\r\n\r\n"Ask Mary to tell him to go into my den. I\'ll be there in a minute."\r\n\r\nWhat a merry party it was that chatted and laughed there in the warmth\r\nof the sunny dining room! For the time being the elders dropped their\r\ncares and became as young in spirit as the boys and girls. Jokes,\r\nstories and good-humored banter passed back and forth until with one\r\naccord everybody rose from the table and sauntered into the library\r\nwhere a great blaze of logs glowed and crackled.\r\n\r\n"If you will excuse me I will see what Havens wants," remarked Mr.\r\nTolman, as he lighted his cigar. "Probably the garage people have\r\nunearthed some more repairs that must be made on that car. They seem to\r\nhave a faculty for that sort of thing. Every day they discover something\r\nnew the matter with it. I shall have a nice little bill by the time they\r\nfinish."\r\n\r\nShrugging his shoulders, he passed into the hall. It was more than half\r\nan hour before he returned and when he did a close observer would have\r\nnoticed that his face had lost its brightness and that the gaiety with\r\nwhich he took up the conversation with his guests was forced and\r\nunnatural. However, he tried resolutely to banish his irritation,\r\nwhatever its cause. He went up to the attic with Mr. Ackerman, where the\r\ntwo searched out skates, woolen gloves and sweaters; he jested with\r\nDoris and Jane Harden; he challenged Dick to a race across the frozen\r\nground. But beneath his lightness lingered a grave depression which\r\nbetokened to those who knew him best that something was wrong. Yet he\r\nwas evidently determined the cloud should not obtrude itself and spoil\r\nthe happiness of the day. Probably some business annoyance that could\r\nnot be remedied had arisen; or possibly Havens had given notice. Such\r\ncontingencies were of course to be deplored but as they could not be\r\nhelped, why let them ruin the entire holiday?\r\n\r\nTherefore nobody heeded Mr. Tolman\'s mood which was so well controlled\r\nthat his guests were unconscious of it, and the group of skaters swung\r\nalong over the frosty fields with undiminished merriment. The Hollow for\r\nwhich they were bound lay in a deserted stone quarry where a little arm\r\nof the river had penetrated the barrier of rocks and, gradually flooding\r\nthe place, made at one end a deep pool; from this point the water spread\r\nitself over the meadows in a large, shallow pond. Had the spot been\r\nnearer the town it would doubtless have been overrun with skaters; but\r\nas it was isolated, and there was a larger lake near the center of the\r\nvillage, few persons took the trouble to seek out this remote stretch of\r\nice.\r\n\r\nThis morning it lay desolate like a gleaming mirror, not a human being\r\nmarring its solitude.\r\n\r\n"We shall have the place all to ourselves!" exclaimed Mr. Ackerman.\r\n"There will be no spectators to watch me renew my youth, thank\r\ngoodness!"\r\n\r\nQuickly the skates were strapped on and the young people shot out into\r\nthe sunshine and began to circle about. More cautiously Mr. Tolman and\r\nhis guest followed.\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t go into the quarry," shouted Mr. Tolman, "for I doubt if it\r\nhas been cold enough yet to freeze the ice very solidly there. There are\r\nliable to be air holes where the river makes in."\r\n\r\n"Oh, we fellows have skated in the quarry millions of times, Dad,"\r\nStephen protested. "It is perfectly safe."\r\n\r\n"There is no way of telling whether it is or not," was the response, "so\r\nsuppose for to-day we keep away from it."\r\n\r\n"But--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, don\'t argue, Stevie," called Doris. "If Dad doesn\'t want us to go\r\nthere that\'s enough, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"But half the fun is making that turn around the rocks," grumbled\r\nStephen, in a lower tone. "I don\'t see why Dad is such a fraid-cat. I\r\nknow this pond better than he does and--"\r\n\r\n"If your father says not to skate there that ought to go with you," cut\r\nin Dick. "He doesn\'t want you to--see? Whether it is safe or not has\r\nnothing to do with it."\r\n\r\n"But it\'s so silly!" went on Stephen. "Why--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, cut it out! Can it!" ejaculated the East Side lad. "Your dad says\r\n_No_ and he\'s the boss."\r\n\r\nThe ungracious retort Steve offered was lost amid the babel of laughter\r\nthat followed, and the skaters darted away up the pond. Indeed, one\r\ncould not long have cherished ill humor amid such radiant surroundings.\r\nThere was too much sunshine, too much sparkle in the clear air; too much\r\njollity and happiness. Almost before he realized it Stephen\'s irritation\r\nhad vanished and he was speeding across the glassy surface of the ice as\r\ngay as the gayest of the company.\r\n\r\nHe never could explain afterward just how it happened that he found\r\nhimself around the bend of the quarry and sweeping with the wind toward\r\nits farther end. He had not actually formulated the intention of\r\nslipping away from the others and invading this forbidden spot.\r\nNevertheless, there he was alone in the tiny cove with no one in sight.\r\nWhat followed was all over in a moment,--the breaking ice and the\r\nplunge into the frigid water. The next he knew he was fighting with all\r\nhis strength to prevent himself from being drawn beneath the jagged,\r\ncrumbling edge of the hole. To clamber out was impossible, for every\r\ntime he tried the thin ice would break afresh under his hands and\r\nsubmerge him again in the bitter cold of the moving stream. Over and\r\nover he tried to pull himself to safety but without success. Then\r\nsuddenly he felt himself becoming numb and helpless. His teeth chattered\r\nand he could no longer retain his hold on the frail support that was\r\nkeeping his head above water. He was slipping back into the river. _He\r\nwas not going to be able to get out!_\r\n\r\nWith a piercing scream he made one last desperate lunge forward, and\r\nagain the ice that held him broke and the water dashed over his ears and\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\nWhen he next opened his eyes it was to find himself in his own bed with\r\na confusion of faces bending over him.\r\n\r\n"There!" he heard some one say in a very small, far-away voice. "He is\r\ncoming to himself now, thank God! It was chiefly cold and fright. He is\r\nsafe now, Tolman. Don\'t you worry! You\'d better go and get off some of\r\nyour wet clothing, or you will catch your death."\r\n\r\nMr. Ackerman was speaking.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Henry, do go!" pleaded his wife.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: He was fighting to prevent himself from being drawn\r\nbeneath the jagged, crumbling edge of the hole. Page 244.]\r\n\r\nAs Stephen looked about him in the vague, groping uncertainty of\r\nreturning consciousness his glance fell upon his father who stood beside\r\nhis pillow, shivering nervously. He put out his hand and touched the\r\ndripping coat sleeve.\r\n\r\n"What--" began he weakly.\r\n\r\nThen with a rush it all came back to him and everything was clear. He\r\nhad been drowning and his father had plunged into the water to save him!\r\n\r\nA sob rose in his throat and he caught the elder man\'s hand between both\r\nof his.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Dad," he exclaimed, "I\'ve been so rotten to you--so mean--so\r\ncowardly. I\'m ashamed to--"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t talk about it now, son. I know."\r\n\r\n"You know what I did?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"But--" the boy paused bewildered.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t talk any more about it now, Stevie," pleaded his mother.\r\n\r\n"But I\'ve got to know," said the lad. "Can\'t you see that--"\r\n\r\n"Let me talk with him alone a moment," suggested Mr. Tolman in an\r\nundertone. "He is all upset and he won\'t calm down until he has this\r\nthing off his mind. Leave me here with him a little while. I\'ll promise\r\nthat he does not tire himself."\r\n\r\nThe doctor, Mr. Ackerman and Mrs. Tolman moved across the room toward\r\nthe window.\r\n\r\n"You asked how I knew, son," began his father with extreme gentleness.\r\n"I didn\'t really know. I just put two and two together. There was the\r\nscratched machine and the gasoline gone--both of which facts puzzled me\r\nnot a little. But the proof that clinched it all and made me certain of\r\nwhat had happened came to me this morning when Havens brought me an old\r\nred sweater and some school papers of Bud Taylor\'s that the men who were\r\noverhauling the car found under the seat. In an instant the whole thing\r\nwas solved."\r\n\r\n"You knew before we went skating then?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"And--and--you jumped into the water after me just the same."\r\n\r\nMr. Tolman\'s voice trembled:\r\n\r\n"You are my son and I love you no matter what you may do."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Dad, I\'m so sorry!" sobbed the boy. "I wanted to tell you--I meant\r\nto. It was just that I was too much of a coward. I was so ashamed of\r\nwhat I had done that I hadn\'t the nerve. After it was over it all seemed\r\nso wrong. I knew you would be angry--"\r\n\r\n"Rather say _sorry_, son."\r\n\r\n"Well, sorry. And now that you have been so white to me I\'m more ashamed\r\nstill."\r\n\r\n"There, there, my boy, we will say no more about it," his father\r\ndeclared. "You and your conscience have probably had a pretty bitter\r\nbattle and I judge you have not been altogether happy since your\r\nadventure. People who do wrong never are. It is no fun to carry your\r\nfault to bed with you and find it waiting when you wake up in the\r\nmorning."\r\n\r\n"You bet it isn\'t!" replied the lad, with fervor. "But can\'t I do\r\nsomething now to make good, Dad?"\r\n\r\nMr. Tolman checked an impulsive protest and after a moment responded\r\ngravely:\r\n\r\n"We will see. Perhaps you would like to earn something toward doing over\r\nthe car."\r\n\r\n"Yes! Yes! I would!"\r\n\r\n"Well, all that can be arranged later. We--"\r\n\r\n"Henry," broke in Mrs. Tolman, "you must go this instant and get into\r\nsome dry clothes. You are chilled through. The doctor says Stephen is\r\ngoing to be none the worse for his ducking and that he can come down\r\nstairs to dinner after he has rested a little longer. So our\r\nThanksgiving party is not to be spoiled, after all. In fact, I believe\r\nwe shall have more to give thanks for than we expected," concluded she,\r\nmaking an unsteady attempt to speak lightly.\r\n\r\n"I think so, too," echoed her husband.\r\n\r\n"And so do I!" added Stephen softly, as he exchanged an affectionate\r\nsmile with his father.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nTHE END OF THE HOUSE PARTY\r\n\r\n\r\nAs they were persons of strong constitution and in good athletic\r\ntraining neither Mr. Tolman nor Steve were any the worse for the narrow\r\nescape of the morning, and although a trifle spent with excitement both\r\nwere able to take their places at the dinner table so that no cloud\r\nrested on the festivity of the day.\r\n\r\nCertainly such a dinner never was,--or if there ever had been one like\r\nit in history at least Dick Martin had never had the luck to sit down to\r\nit. The soup steaming and hot, the celery white and crisp, the sweet\r\npotatoes browned in the oven and gleaming beneath their glaze of sugar,\r\nthe cranberry sauce vivid as a bowl of rubies; to say nothing of squash,\r\nand parsnips and onions! And as for the turkey,--why, it was the size of\r\nan ostrich! With what resignation it lay upon its back, with what an\r\nabject spirit of surrender,--as if it realized that resistance was\r\nfutile and that it must docilely offer itself up to make perfect the\r\nfeast. And the pudding, the golden-tinted pies with their delicate\r\ncrust, the nuts; the pyramid of fruit, riotous in color; the candies of\r\nevery imaginable hue and flavor! Was it a wonder that Dick, who had\r\nnever before beheld a real New England home Thanksgiving, regarded the\r\nnovelty with eyes as large as saucers and ate until there was not room\r\nfor another mouthful?\r\n\r\n"Gee!" he gasped in a whisper to Stephen, as he sank weakly back into\r\nhis chair when the coffee made its appearance. "This sure is some\r\ndinner."\r\n\r\nThe others who chanced to overhear the observation laughed.\r\n\r\n"Had enough, sonny?" inquired Mr. Tolman.\r\n\r\n"_Enough!_"\r\n\r\nThere was more laughter.\r\n\r\n"I suppose were it not for the trains and the ships we should not be\r\nhaving such a meal as this to-day," remarked Mrs. Tolman.\r\n\r\n"You are right," was Mr. Ackerman\'s reply. "Let me see! Fruit from\r\nFlorida, California and probably from Italy; flour from the Middle West;\r\ncoffee from South America; sugar probably from Cuba; turkey from Rhode\r\nIsland, no doubt; and vegetables from scattered New England farms. Add\r\nto this cigarettes from Egypt and Turkey and you have covered quite a\r\nportion of the globe."\r\n\r\n"It is a pity we do not consider our indebtedness to our neighbors all\r\nover the world oftener," commented Mr. Tolman. "We take so much for\r\ngranted these days. To appreciate our blessings to the full we should\r\nhave lived in early Colonial times when the arrival of a ship from\r\nacross the ocean was such an important event that the wares she brought\r\nwere advertised broadcast. Whenever such a vessel came into port a list\r\nof her cargo was issued and purchasers scrambled eagerly to secure the\r\nluxuries she carried. Pipes of wine, bolts of cloth, china, silks,\r\ntea--all were catalogued. It was no ordinary happening when such a boat\r\ndocked, I assure you."\r\n\r\n"I suppose it was a great event," reflected Mrs. Tolman, "although I\r\nnever half realized it."\r\n\r\n"And not only was the advent of merchandise a red-letter day but so was\r\nthe advent of travelers from the other side of the water. Picture if you\r\ncan the excitement that ensued when Jenny Lind, the famous singer,\r\nvisited this country! And the fact that we were now to hear this\r\ncelebrated woman was not the only reason for our interest. She had\r\nactually come in a ship from across the sea! Others would come also.\r\nAmerica was no longer cut off from the culture of the old world, an\r\nisolated country bereft of the advantages of European civilization. We\r\nwere near enough for distinguished persons to make trips here! Charles\r\nDickens and the Prince of Wales came--and how cosmopolitan we felt to be\r\nentertaining guests from the mother-country! Certainly the Atlantic\r\ncould not be very wide if it could be crossed so easily and if we could\r\nhave the same speakers, the same readers, the same singers as did the\r\nEnglish! Our fathers and grandfathers must have thrilled with\r\nsatisfaction at the thought. The ocean was conquered and was no longer\r\nan estranging barrier."\r\n\r\n"What would they have said to crossing the water by aeroplane or bobbing\r\nup in a foreign port in a submarine?" put in Doris.\r\n\r\n"And some day I suppose the marvels of our age that cause our mouths to\r\nopen wide and our eyes to bulge with amazement will become as humdrum as\r\nthe ocean liner and the Pullman have," Mrs. Tolman remarked.\r\n\r\n"Yes," returned her husband. "Think of the fight every one of these\r\ninnovations has had to put up before it battled its way to success. The\r\nfirst locomotives, you remember, were not only rated as unsafe for\r\ntravel but also actually destructive to property. The major part of the\r\npublic had no faith in them and predicted they would never be used for\r\ngeneral travel. As for crossing the ocean--why, one was welcome to take\r\nhis life in his hands if he chose, of course; but to cross in an iron\r\nship--it was tempting Providence! Did not iron always sink? And how\r\npeople ridiculed Darius Green and his flying machine! Most of the\r\nprophets were thought to be crazy. History is filled with stories of men\r\nwho wrecked their worldly fortunes to perpetuate an idea, and but too\r\nfrequently an idea they never lived to see perfected."\r\n\r\nDuring the pause that followed Mr. Ackerman leaned across the table and\r\nas he sipped his coffee asked mischievously:\r\n\r\n"Well, Steve, having now heard both stories, have you come to a\r\nconclusion which one you are going to vote for?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir," was the dubious response. "I\'m farther away from a decision\r\nthan ever. Just as I get it settled in my mind that the railroads have\r\ndone the biggest things and conquered the most difficulties along come\r\nthe steamships and I am certain they are six times as wonderful."\r\n\r\n"And you, Dick--what do you say?" questioned the financier, smiling.\r\n"Surely you are going to stand up for the steamboat."\r\n\r\nBut to his chagrin Dick shook his head.\r\n\r\n"I feel as Steve does," replied he. "No sooner do I get settled one way\r\nthan something turns me round the other."\r\n\r\n"So far as I can see we shall have to leave the matter a draw, shan\'t\r\nwe, Tolman?" observed the New Yorker.\r\n\r\n"It would be a jolly subject for a debate, wouldn\'t it?" put in Stephen.\r\n"Sometimes we have discussions like that at school and the next time we\r\ndo I believe I\'ll suggest this topic. It would be mighty interesting."\r\n\r\n"It certainly would," his father echoed. "But it also would be a very\r\nsorry event if you could not demonstrate that the railroads had the\r\nsupremacy for were their prestige to be threatened I might have to move\r\nout of town."\r\n\r\n"In case Connecticut did not want you, you might come to New York where\r\nyou would be sure of being appreciated," put in Mr. Ackerman. "And that\r\nis not all talk, either, for I want you and the whole family to give me\r\na promise to-day that you will come over and join Dick and me at\r\nChristmas. I\'ve never had a boy of my own to celebrate the holiday with\r\nbefore, you must remember; but this time I have a real family and I am\r\ngoing to have a real Christmas," he continued, smiling affectionately at\r\nthe lad beside him. "So I want every one of you to come and help me to\r\nmake the day a genuine landmark. And if I\'m a little new at playing\r\nSanta Claus some of you who have been schooled in the r\xc3\xb4le for many\r\nyears can show me how. We can\'t promise to stage for you such an\r\nexcitement as Stephen got up for us this morning, and we never can give\r\nyou a dinner equal to this; but we can give you a royal welcome. You can\r\ncome by boat or come by train," added he slyly. "No guest who patronizes\r\nthe railroads will be shut out, even if he is misguided. The chief thing\r\nis for you to come, one and all, and we will renew our friendship and\r\nonce again bless Stephen, Dick, and my lost pocketbook, for bringing us\r\ntogether."\r\n\r\nFINIS\r\n\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nThe first volume in "The Invention Series"\r\n\r\nPAUL AND THE PRINTING PRESS\r\n\r\nBy SARA WARE BASSETT\r\n\r\nWith illustrations by A.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
