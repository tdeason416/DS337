The boy is directly\r\ninterested in the practical use which he can make of this wonderful\r\nphenomenon in nature.\r\n\r\nIt is, in reality, the most successful avenue by which he may obtain the\r\ntheory, for he learns the abstract more readily from concrete examples.\r\n\r\nIt is an art in which shop practice is a greater educator than can be\r\npossible with books. Boys are not, generally, inclined to speculate or\r\ntheorize on phenomena apart from the work itself; but once put them into\r\ncontact with the mechanism itself, let them become a living part of it,\r\nand they will commence to reason and think for themselves.\r\n\r\nIt would be a dry, dull and uninteresting thing to tell a boy that\r\nelectricity can be generated by riveting together two pieces of\r\ndissimilar metals, and applying heat to the juncture. But put into his\r\nhands the metals, and set him to perform the actual work of riveting the\r\nmetals together, then wiring up the ends of the metals, heating them,\r\nand, with a galvanometer, watching for results, it will at once make him\r\nsee something in the experiment which never occurred when the abstract\r\ntheory was propounded.\r\n\r\nHe will inquire first what metals should be used to get the best\r\nresults, and finally, he will speculate as to the reasons for the\r\nphenomena. When he learns that all metals are positive-negative or\r\nnegative-positive to each other, he has grasped a new idea in the realm\r\nof knowledge, which he unconsciously traces back still further, only to\r\nlearn that he has entered a field which relates to the constitution of\r\nmatter itself. As he follows the subject through its various channels he\r\nwill learn that there is a common source of all things; a manifestation\r\ncommon to all matter, and that all substances in nature are linked\r\ntogether in a most wonderful way.\r\n\r\nAn impulse must be given to a boy\'s training. The time is past for the\r\nrule-and-rote method. The rule can be learned better by a manual\r\napplication than by committing a sentence to memory.\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of this book, therefore, I have made practice and\r\nwork the predominating factors. It has been my aim to suggest the best\r\nform in which to do the things in a practical way, and from that work,\r\nas the boy carries it out, to deduce certain laws and develop the\r\nprinciples which underlie them. Wherever it is deemed possible to do so,\r\nit is planned to have the boy make these discoveries for himself, so as\r\nto encourage him to become a thinker and a reasoner instead of a mere\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\nA boy does not develop into a philosopher or a scientist through being\r\ntold he must learn the principles of this teaching, or the fundamentals\r\nof that school of reasoning. He will unconsciously imbibe the spirit and\r\nthe willingness if we but place before him the tools by which he may\r\nbuild even the simple machinery that displays the various electrical\r\nmanifestations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nTHE STUDY OF ELECTRICITY. HISTORICAL\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no study so profound as electricity. It is a marvel to the\r\nscientist as well as to the novice. It is simple in its manifestations,\r\nbut most complex in its organization and in its ramifications. It has\r\nbeen shown that light, heat, magnetism and electricity are the same, but\r\nthat they differ merely in their modes of motion.\r\n\r\nFIRST HISTORICAL ACCOUNT.--The first historical account of electricity\r\ndates back to 600 years B. C. Thales of Miletus was the first to\r\ndescribe the properties of amber, which, when rubbed, attracted and\r\nrepelled light bodies. The ancients also described what was probably\r\ntourmaline, a mineral which has the same qualities. The torpedo, a fish\r\nwhich has the power of emitting electric impulses, was known in very\r\nearly times.\r\n\r\nFrom that period down to about the year 1600 no accounts of any\r\nhistorical value have been given. Dr. Gilbert, of England, made a number\r\nof researches at that time, principally with amber and other materials,\r\nand Boyle, in 1650, made numerous experiments with frictional\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\nSir Isaac Newton also took up the subject at about the same period. In\r\n1705 Hawksbee made numerous experiments; also Gray, in 1720, and a\r\nWelshman, Dufay, at about the same time. The Germans, from 1740 to 1780,\r\nmade many experiments. In 1740, at Leyden, was discovered the jar which\r\nbears that name. Before that time, all experiments began and ended with\r\nfrictional electricity.\r\n\r\nThe first attempt to "bottle" electricity was attempted by\r\nMuschenbr[oe]ck, at Leyden, who conceived the idea that electricity in\r\nmaterials might be retained by surrounding them with bodies which did\r\nnot conduct the current. He electrified some water in a jar, and\r\ncommunication having been established between the water and the prime\r\nconductor, his assistant, who was holding the bottle, on trying to\r\ndisengage the communicating wire, received a sudden shock.\r\n\r\nIn 1747 Sir William Watson fired gunpowder by an electric spark, and,\r\nlater on, a party from the Royal Society, in conjunction with Watson,\r\nconducted a series of experiments to determine the velocity of the\r\nelectric fluid, as it was then termed.\r\n\r\nBenjamin Franklin, in 1750, showed that lightning was electricity, and\r\nlater on made his interesting experiments with the kite and the key.\r\n\r\nDISCOVERING GALVANIC ELECTRICITY.--The great discovery of Galvani, in\r\n1790, led to the recognition of a new element in electricity, called\r\ngalvanic or voltaic (named after the experimenter, Volta), and now known\r\nto be identical with frictional electricity. In 1805 Poisson was the\r\nfirst to analyze electricity; and when [OE]rsted of Copenhagen, in 1820,\r\ndiscovered the magnetic action of electricity, it offered a great\r\nstimulus to the science, and paved the way for investigation in a new\r\ndirection. Ampere was the first to develop the idea that a motor or a\r\ndynamo could be made operative by means of the electro-magnetic current;\r\nand Faraday, about 1830, discovered electro-magnetic rotation.\r\n\r\nELECTRO-MAGNETIC FORCE.--From this time on the knowledge of electricity\r\ngrew with amazing rapidity. Ohm\'s definition of electro-motive force,\r\ncurrent strength and resistance eventuated into Ohm\'s law. Thomson\r\ngreatly simplified the galvanometer, and Wheatstone invented the\r\nrheostat, a means of measuring resistance, about 1850. Then primary\r\nbatteries were brought forward by Daniels, Grove, Bunsen and Thomson,\r\nand electrolysis by Faraday. Then came the instruments of precision--the\r\nelectrometer, the resistance bridge, the ammeter, the voltmeter--all of\r\nthe utmost value in the science.\r\n\r\nMEASURING INSTRUMENTS.--The perfection of measuring instruments did more\r\nto advance electricity than almost any other field of endeavor; so that\r\nafter 1875 the inventors took up the subject, and by their energy\r\ndeveloped and put into practical operation a most wonderful array of\r\nmechanism, which has become valuable in the service of man in almost\r\nevery field of human activity.\r\n\r\nRAPIDITY OF MODERN PROGRESS.--This brief history is given merely to show\r\nwhat wonders have been accomplished in a few years. The art is really\r\nless than fifty years old, and yet so rapidly has it gone forward that\r\nit is not at all surprising to hear the remark, that the end of the\r\nwonders has been reached. Less than twenty-five years ago a high\r\nofficial of the United States Patent Office stated that it was probable\r\nthe end of electrical research had been reached. The most wonderful\r\ndevelopments have been made since that time; and now, as in the past,\r\none discovery is but the prelude to another still more remarkable. We\r\nare beginning to learn that we are only on the threshold of that\r\nstorehouse in which nature has locked her secrets, and that there is no\r\nlimit to human ingenuity.\r\n\r\nHOW TO ACQUIRE THE VAST KNOWLEDGE.--As the boy, with his limited vision,\r\nsurveys this vast accumulation of tools, instruments and machinery, and\r\nsees what has been and is now being accomplished, it is not to be\r\nwondered at that he should enter the field with timidity. In his mind\r\nthe great question is, how to acquire the knowledge. There is so much to\r\nlearn. How can it be accomplished?\r\n\r\nThe answer to this is, that the student of to-day has the advantage of\r\nthe knowledge of all who have gone before; and now the pertinent thing\r\nis to acquire that knowledge.\r\n\r\nTHE MEANS EMPLOYED.--This brings us definitely down to an examination of\r\nthe means that we shall employ to instil this knowledge, so that it may\r\nbecome a permanent asset to the student\'s store of information.\r\n\r\nThe most significant thing in the history of electrical development is\r\nthe knowledge that of all the great scientists not one of them ever\r\nadded any knowledge to the science on purely speculative reasoning. All\r\nof them were experimenters. They practically applied and developed their\r\ntheories in the laboratory or the workshop. The natural inference is,\r\ntherefore, that the boy who starts out to acquire a knowledge of\r\nelectricity, must not only theorize, but that he shall, primarily,\r\nconduct the experiments, and thereby acquire the information in a\r\npractical way, one example of which will make a more lasting impression\r\nthan pages of dry text.\r\n\r\nThroughout these pages, therefore, I shall, as briefly as possible,\r\npoint out the theories involved, as a foundation for the work, and then\r\nillustrate the structural types or samples; and the work is so arranged\r\nthat what is done to-day is merely a prelude or stepping-stone to the\r\nnext phase of the art. In reality, we shall travel, to a considerable\r\nextent, the course which the great investigators followed when they were\r\ngroping for the facts and discovering the great manifestations in\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nWHAT TOOLS AND APPARATUS ARE NEEDED\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARING THE WORKSHOP.--Before commencing actual experiments we should\r\nprepare the workshop and tools. Since we are going into this work as\r\npioneers, we shall have to be dependent upon our own efforts for the\r\nproduction of the electrical apparatus, so as to be able, with our\r\nhome-made factory, to provide the power, the heat and the electricity.\r\nThen, finding we are successful in these enterprises, we may look\r\nforward for "more worlds to conquer."\r\n\r\nBy this time our neighbors will become interested in and solicit work\r\nfrom us.\r\n\r\nUSES OF OUR WORKSHOPS.--They may want us to test batteries, and it then\r\nbecomes necessary to construct mechanism to detect and measure\r\nelectricity; to install new and improved apparatus; and to put in and\r\nconnect up electric bells in their houses, as well as burglar alarms. To\r\nmeet the requirements, we put in a telegraph line, having learned, as\r\nwell as we are able, how they are made and operated. But we find the\r\ntelegraph too slow and altogether unsuited for our purposes, as well as\r\nfor the uses of the neighborhood, so we conclude to put in a telephone\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nWHAT TO BUILD.--It is necessary, therefore, to commence right at the\r\nbottom to build a telephone, a transmitter, a receiver and a\r\nswitch-board for our system. From the telephone we soon see the\r\ndesirability of getting into touch with the great outside world, and\r\nwireless telegraphy absorbs our time and energies.\r\n\r\nBut as we learn more and more of the wonderful things electricity will\r\ndo, we are brought into contact with problems which directly interest\r\nthe home. Sanitation attracts our attention. Why cannot electricity act\r\nas an agent to purify our drinking water, to sterilize sewage and to\r\narrest offensive odors? We must, therefore, learn something about the\r\nsubject of electrolysis.\r\n\r\nWHAT TO LEARN.--The decomposition of water is not the only thing that we\r\nshall describe pertaining to this subject. We go a step further, and\r\nfind that we can decompose metals as well as liquids, and that we can\r\nmake a pure metal out of an impure one, as well as make the foulest\r\nwater pure. But we shall also, in the course of our experiments, find\r\nthat a cheap metal can be coated with a costly one by means of\r\nelectricity--that we can electroplate by electrolysis.\r\n\r\nUSES OF THE ELECTRICAL DEVICES.--While all this is progressing and our\r\nfactory is turning out an amazing variety of useful articles, we are led\r\nto inquire into the uses to which we may devote our surplus electricity.\r\nThe current may be diverted for boiling water; for welding metals; for\r\nheating sad-irons, as well as for other purposes which are daily\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nTOOLS.--To do these things tools are necessary, and for the present they\r\nshould not be expensive. A small, rigidly built bench is the first\r\nrequirement. This may be made, as shown in Fig. 1, of three 2-inch\r\nplanks, each 10 inches wide and 6 feet long, mounted on legs 36 inches\r\nin height. In the front part are three drawers for your material, or the\r\nsmall odds and ends, as well as for such little tools as you may\r\naccumulate. Then you will need a small vise, say, with a 2-inch jaw, and\r\nyou will also require a hand reel for winding magnets. This will be\r\nfully described hereafter.\r\n\r\nYou can also, probably, get a small, cheap anvil, which will be of the\r\ngreatest service in your work. It should be mounted close up to the work\r\nbench. Two small hammers, one with an A-shaped peon, and the other with\r\na round peon, should be selected, and also a plane and a small wood saw\r\nwith fine teeth. A bit stock, or a ratchet drill, if you can afford it,\r\nwith a variety of small drills; two wood chisels, say of 3/8-inch and\r\n3/4-inch widths; small cold chisels; hack saw, 10-inch blade; small\r\niron square; pair of dividers; tin shears; wire cutters; 2 pairs of\r\npliers, one flat and the other round-nosed; 2 awls, centering punch,\r\nwire cutters, and, finally, soldering tools.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 2. Top View_ MAGNET-WINDING REEL]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 3. Side View_ MAGNET-WINDING REEL]\r\n\r\nIf a gas stove is not available, a brazing torch is an essential tool.\r\nNumerous small torches are being made, which are cheap and easily\r\noperated. A small soldering iron, with pointed end, should be provided;\r\nalso metal shears and a small square; an awl and several sizes of\r\ngimlets; a screwdriver; pair of pliers and wire cutters.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing it will be seen that the cost of tools is not a very\r\nexpensive item.\r\n\r\nThis entire outfit, not including the anvil and vise, may be purchased\r\nnew for about $20.00, so we have not been extravagant.\r\n\r\nMAGNET-WINDING REEL.--Some little preparation must be made, so we may be\r\nenabled to handle our work by the construction of mechanical aids.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 4. Journal Block._]\r\n\r\nFirst of these is the magnet-winding reel, a plan view of which is shown\r\nin Fig. 2. This, for our present work, will be made wholly of wood.\r\n\r\nSelect a plank 1-1/2 inches thick and 8 inches wide, and from this cut\r\noff two pieces (A), each 7 inches long, and then trim off the corners\r\n(B, B), as shown in Fig. 4. To serve as the mandrel (C, Fig. 2), select\r\na piece of broomstick 9 inches long. Bore a hole (D) in each block (A) a\r\nhalf inch below the upper margin of the block, this hole being of such\r\ndiameter that the broomstick mandrel will fit and easily turn therein.\r\n\r\nPlace a crank (E), 5 inches long, on the outer end of the mandrel, as in\r\nFig. 3. Then mount one block on the end of the bench and the other block\r\n3 inches away. Affix them to the bench by nails or screws, preferably\r\nthe latter.\r\n\r\nOn the inner end of the mandrel put a block (F) of hard wood. This is\r\ndone by boring a hole 1 inch deep in the center of the block, into which\r\nthe mandrel is driven. On the outer face of the block is a square hole\r\nlarge enough to receive the head of a 3/8-inch bolt, and into the\r\ndepression thus formed a screw (G) is driven through the block and into\r\nthe end of the mandrel, so as to hold the block (F) and mandrel firmly\r\ntogether. When these parts are properly put together, the inner side of\r\nthe block will rest and turn against the inner journal block (A).\r\n\r\nThe tailpiece is made of a 2" \xc3\x97 4" scantling (H), 10 inches long, one\r\nend of it being nailed to a transverse block (I) 2" \xc3\x97 2" \xc3\x97 4". The inner\r\nface of this block has a depression in which is placed a V-shaped cup\r\n(J), to receive the end of the magnet core (K) or bolt, which is to be\r\nused for this purpose. The tailpiece (H) has a longitudinal slot (L) 5\r\ninches long adapted to receive a 1/2-inch bolt (M), which passes down\r\nthrough the bench, and is, therefore, adjustable, so it may be moved to\r\nand from the journal bearing (A), thereby providing a place for the\r\nbolts to be put in. These bolts are the magnet cores (K), 6 inches long,\r\nbut they may be even longer, if you bore several holes (N) through the\r\nbench so you may set over the tailpiece.\r\n\r\nWith a single tool made substantially like this, over a thousand of the\r\nfinest magnets have been wound. Its value will be appreciated after you\r\nhave had the experience of winding a few magnets.\r\n\r\nORDER IN THE WORKSHOP.--Select a place for each tool on the rear upright\r\nof the bench, and make it a rule to put each tool back into its place\r\nafter using. This, if persisted in, will soon become a habit, and will\r\nsave you hours of time. Hunting for tools is the unprofitable part of\r\nany work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nMAGNETS, COILS, ARMATURES, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TWO KINDS OF MAGNET.--Generally speaking, magnets are of two kinds,\r\nnamely, permanent and electro-magnetic.\r\n\r\nPERMANENT MAGNETS.--A permanent magnet is a piece of steel in which an\r\nelectric force is exerted at all times. An electro-magnet is a piece of\r\niron which is magnetized by a winding of wire, and the magnet is\r\nenergized only while a current of electricity is passing through the\r\nwire.\r\n\r\nELECTRO-MAGNET.--The electro-magnet, therefore, is the more useful,\r\nbecause the pull of the magnet can be controlled by the current which\r\nactuates it.\r\n\r\nThe electro-magnet is the most essential of all contrivances in the\r\noperation and use of electricity. It is the piece of mechanism which\r\ndoes the physical work of almost every electrical apparatus or machine.\r\nIt is the device which has the power to convert the unseen electric\r\ncurrent into motion which may be observed by the human eye. Without it\r\nelectricity would be a useless agent to man.\r\n\r\nWhile the electro-magnet is, therefore, the form of device which is\r\nalmost wholly used, it is necessary, first, to understand the principles\r\nof the permanent magnet.\r\n\r\nMAGNETISM.--The curious force exerted by a magnet is called magnetism,\r\nbut its origin has never been explained. We know its manifestations\r\nonly, and laws have been formulated to explain its various phases; how\r\nto make it more or less intense; how to make its pull more effective;\r\nthe shape and form of the magnet and the material most useful in its\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig 5._ PLAIN MAGNET BAR]\r\n\r\nMATERIALS FOR MAGNETS.--Iron and steel are the best materials for\r\nmagnets. Some metals are non-magnetic, this applying to iron if combined\r\nwith manganese. Others, like sulphur, zinc, bismuth, antimony, gold,\r\nsilver and copper, not only are non-magnetic, but they are actually\r\nrepelled by magnetism. They are called the diamagnetics.\r\n\r\nNON-MAGNETIC MATERIALS.--Any non-magnetic body in the path of a magnetic\r\nforce does not screen or diminish its action, whereas a magnetic\r\nsubstance will.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 5 we show the simplest form of magnet, merely a bar of steel (A)\r\nwith the magnetic lines of force passing from end to end. It will be\r\nunderstood that these lines extend out on all sides, and not only along\r\ntwo sides, as shown in the drawing. The object is to explain clearly how\r\nthe lines run.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 6._ SEVERED MAGNET]\r\n\r\nACTION OF A SEVERED MAGNET.--Now, let us suppose that we sever this bar\r\nin the middle, as in Fig. 6, or at any other point between the ends. In\r\nthis case each part becomes a perfect magnet, and a new north pole (N)\r\nand a new south pole (S) are made, so that the movement of the magnetic\r\nlines of force are still in the same direction in each--that is, the\r\ncurrent flows from the north pole to the south pole.\r\n\r\nWHAT NORTH AND SOUTH POLES MEAN.--If these two parts are placed close\r\ntogether they will attract each other. But if, on the other hand, one of\r\nthe pieces is reversed, as in Fig. 7, they will repel each other. From\r\nthis comes the statement that likes repel and unlikes attract each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nREPULSION AND ATTRACTION.--This physical act of repulsion and attraction\r\nis made use of in motors, as we shall see hereinafter.\r\n\r\nIt will be well to bear in mind that in treating of electricity the\r\nnorth pole is always associated with the plus sign (+) and the south\r\npole with the minus sign (-). Or the N sign is positive and the S sign\r\nnegative electricity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 7._ REVERSED MAGNETS]\r\n\r\nPOSITIVES AND NEGATIVES.--There is really no difference between positive\r\nand negative electricity, so called, but the foregoing method merely\r\nserves as a means of identifying or classifying the opposite ends of a\r\nmagnet or of a wire.\r\n\r\nMAGNETIC LINES OF FORCE.--It will be noticed that the magnetic lines of\r\nforce pass through the bar and then go from end to end through the\r\natmosphere. Air is a poor conductor of electricity, so that if we can\r\nfind a shorter way to conduct the current from the north pole to the\r\nsouth pole, the efficiency of the magnet is increased.\r\n\r\nThis is accomplished by means of the well-known horseshoe magnet, where\r\nthe two ends (N, S) are brought close together, as in Fig. 8.\r\n\r\nTHE EARTH AS A MAGNET.--The earth is a huge magnet and the magnetic\r\nlines run from the north pole to the south pole around all sides of the\r\nglobe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 8._ HORSESHOE MAGNET]\r\n\r\nThe north magnetic pole does not coincide with the true north pole or\r\nthe pivotal point of the earth\'s rotation, but it is sufficiently near\r\nfor all practical purposes. Fig. 9 shows the magnetic lines running from\r\nthe north to the south pole.\r\n\r\nWHY THE COMPASS POINTS NORTH AND SOUTH.--Now, let us try to ascertain\r\nwhy the compass points north and south.\r\n\r\nLet us assume that we have a large magnet (A, Fig. 10), and suspend a\r\nsmall magnet (B) above it, so that it is within the magnetic field of\r\nthe large magnet. This may be done by means of a short pin (C), which is\r\nlocated in the middle of the magnet (B), the upper end of this pin\r\nhaving thereon a loop to which a thread (D) is attached. The pin also\r\ncarries thereon a pointer (E), which is directed toward the north pole\r\nof the bar (B).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 9._ EARTH\'S MAGNETIC LINES]\r\n\r\nYou will now take note of the interior magnetic lines (X), and the\r\nexterior magnetic lines (Z) of the large magnet (A), and compare the\r\ndirection of their flow with the similar lines in the small magnet (B).\r\n\r\nThe small magnet has both its exterior and its interior lines within the\r\nexterior lines (Z) of the large magnet (A), so that as the small magnet\r\n(B) is capable of swinging around, the N pole of the bar (B) will point\r\ntoward the S pole of the larger bar (A). The small bar, therefore, is\r\ninfluenced by the exterior magnetic field (Z).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 10._ TWO PERMANENT MAGNETS]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 11._ MAGNETS IN THE EARTH\'S MAGNETIC FIELD]\r\n\r\nLet us now take the outline represented by the earth\'s surface (Fig.\r\n11), and suspend a magnet (A) at any point, like the needle of a\r\ncompass, and it will be seen that the needle will arrange itself north\r\nand south, within the magnetic field which flows from the north to the\r\nsouth pole.\r\n\r\nPECULIARITY OF A MAGNET.--One characteristic of a magnet is that, while\r\napparently the magnetic field flows out at one end of the magnet, and\r\nmoves inwardly at the other end, the power of attraction is just the\r\nsame at both ends.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 12 are shown a bar (A) and a horseshoe magnet (B). The bar (A)\r\nhas metal blocks (C) at each end, and each of these blocks is attracted\r\nto and held in contact with the ends by magnetic influence, just the\r\nsame as the bar (D) is attracted by and held against the two ends of the\r\nhorseshoe magnet. These blocks (C) or the bar (D) are called armatures.\r\nThrough them is represented the visible motion produced by the magnetic\r\nfield.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 12._ ARMATURES FOR MAGNETS]\r\n\r\nACTION OF THE ELECTRO-MAGNET.--The electro-magnet exerts its force in\r\nthe same manner as a permanent magnet, so far as attraction and\r\nrepulsion are concerned, and it has a north and a south pole, as in the\r\ncase with the permanent magnet. An electro-magnet is simply a bar of\r\niron with a coil or coils of wire around it; when a current of\r\nelectricity flows through the wire, the bar is magnetized. The moment\r\nthe current is cut off, the bar is demagnetized. The question that now\r\narises is, why an electric current flowing through a wire, under those\r\nconditions, magnetizes the bar, or _core_, as it is called.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 13._ MAGNETIZED FIELD]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 14._ MAGNETIZED BAR]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 13 is shown a piece of wire (A). Let us assume that a current of\r\nelectricity is flowing through this wire in the direction of the darts.\r\nWhat actually takes place is that the electricity extends out beyond the\r\nsurface of the wire in the form of the closed rings (B). If, now, this\r\nwire (A) is wound around an iron core (C, Fig. 14), you will observe\r\nthat this electric field, as it is called, entirely surrounds the core,\r\nor rather, that the core is within the magnetic field or influence of\r\nthe current flowing through the wire, and the core (C) thereby becomes\r\nmagnetized, but it is magnetized only when the current passes through\r\nthe wire coil (A).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 15._ DIRECTION OF CURRENT]\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing, it will be understood that a wire carrying a current\r\nof electricity not only is affected within its body, but that it also\r\nhas a sphere of influence exteriorly to the body of the wire, at all\r\npoints; and advantage is taken of this phenomenon in constructing\r\nmotors, dynamos, electrical measuring devices and almost every kind of\r\nelectrical mechanism in existence.\r\n\r\nEXTERIOR MAGNETIC INFLUENCE AROUND A WIRE CARRYING A CURRENT.--Bear in\r\nmind that the wire coil (A, Fig. 14) does not come into contact with the\r\ncore (C). It is insulated from the core, either by air or by rubber or\r\nother insulating substance, and a current passing from A to C under\r\nthose conditions is a current of _induction_. On the other hand, the\r\ncurrent flowing through the wire (A) from end to end is called a\r\n_conduction_ current. Remember these terms.\r\n\r\nIn this connection there is also another thing which you will do well to\r\nbear in mind. In Fig. 15 you will notice a core (C) and an insulated\r\nwire coil (B) wound around it. The current, through the wire (B), as\r\nshown by the darts (D), moves in one direction, and the induced current\r\nin the core (C) travels in the opposite direction, as shown by the darts\r\n(D).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 16._ DIRECTION OF INDUCTION CURRENT]\r\n\r\nPARALLEL WIRES.--In like manner, if two wires (A, B, Fig. 16) are\r\nparallel with each other, and a current of electricity passes along the\r\nwire (A) in one direction, the induced current in the wire (B) will move\r\nin the opposite direction.\r\n\r\nThese fundamental principles should be thoroughly understood and\r\nmastered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nFRICTIONAL, VOLTAIC OR GALVANIC, AND ELECTRO-MAGNETIC ELECTRICITY\r\n\r\n\r\nTHREE ELECTRICAL SOURCES.--It has been found that there are three kinds\r\nof electricity, or, to be more accurate, there are three ways to\r\ngenerate it. These will now be described.\r\n\r\nWhen man first began experimenting, he produced a current by frictional\r\nmeans, and collected the electricity in a bottle or jar. Electricity, so\r\nstored, could be drawn from the jar, by attaching thereto suitable\r\nconnection. This could be effected only in one way, and that was by\r\ndischarging the entire accumulation instantaneously. At that time they\r\nknew of no means whereby the current could be made to flow from the jar\r\nas from a battery or cell.\r\n\r\nFRICTIONAL ELECTRICITY.--With a view of explaining the principles\r\ninvolved, we show in Fig. 17 a machine for producing electricity by\r\nfriction.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 17._ FRICTION-ELECTRICITY MACHINE]\r\n\r\nThis is made up as follows: A represents the base, having thereon a flat\r\nmember (B), on which is mounted a pair of parallel posts or standards\r\n(C, C), which are connected at the top by a cross piece (D). Between\r\nthese two posts is a glass disc (E), mounted upon a shaft (F), which\r\npasses through the posts, this shaft having at one end a crank (G). Two\r\nleather collecting surfaces (H, H), which are in contact with the glass\r\ndisc (E), are held in position by arms (I, J), the arm (I) being\r\nsupported by the cross piece (D), and the arm (J) held by the base piece\r\n(B). A rod (K), U-shaped in form, passes over the structure here thus\r\ndescribed, its ends being secured to the base (B). The arms (I, J) are\r\nboth electrically connected with this rod, or conductor (K), joined to a\r\nmain conductor (L), which has a terminating knob (M). On each side and\r\nclose to the terminal end of each leather collector (H) is a fork-shaped\r\ncollector (N). These two collectors are also connected electrically with\r\nthe conductor (K). When the disc is turned electricity is generated by\r\nthe leather flaps and accumulated by the collectors (N), after which it\r\nis ready to be discharged at the knob (M).\r\n\r\nIn order to collect the electricity thus generated a vessel called a\r\nLeyden jar is used.\r\n\r\nLEYDEN JAR.--This is shown in Fig. 18. The jar (A) is of glass coated\r\nexteriorly at its lower end with tinfoil (B), which extends up a little\r\nmore than halfway from the bottom. This jar has a wooden cover or top\r\n(C), provided centrally with a hole (D). The jar is designed to receive\r\nwithin it a tripod and standard (E) of lead. Within this lead standard\r\nis fitted a metal rod (F), which projects upwardly through the hole (D),\r\nits upper end having thereon a terminal knob (G). A sliding cork (H) on\r\nthe rod (F) serves as a means to close the jar when not in use. When in\r\nuse this cork is raised so the rod may not come into contact,\r\nelectrically, with the cover (C).\r\n\r\nThe jar is half filled with sulphuric acid (I), after which, in order\r\nto charge the jar, the knob (G) is brought into contact with the knob\r\n(M) of the friction generator (Fig. 17).\r\n\r\nVOLTAIC OR GALVANIC ELECTRICITY.--The second method of generating\r\nelectricity is by chemical means, so called, because a liquid is used as\r\none of the agents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 18._ LEYDEN JAR]\r\n\r\nGalvani, in 1790, made the experiments which led to the generation of\r\nelectricity by means of liquids and metals. The first battery was called\r\nthe "crown of cups," shown in Fig. 19, and consisting of a row of glass\r\ncups (A), containing salt water. These cups were electrically connected\r\nby means of bent metal strips (B), each strip having at one end a copper\r\nplate (C), and at the other end a zinc plate (D). The first plate in the\r\ncup at one end is connected with the last plate in the cup at the other\r\nend by a conductor (E) to make a complete circuit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 19._ GALVANIC ELECTRICITY. CROWN OF CUPS]\r\n\r\nTHE CELL AND BATTERY.--From the foregoing it will be seen that within\r\neach cup the current flows from the zinc to the copper plates, and\r\nexteriorly from the copper to the zinc plates through the conductors (B\r\nand E).\r\n\r\nA few years afterwards Volta devised what is known as the voltaic pile\r\n(Fig. 20).\r\n\r\nVOLTAIC PILE--HOW MADE.--This is made of alternate discs of copper and\r\nzinc with a piece of cardboard of corresponding size between each zinc\r\nand copper plate. The cardboard discs are moistened with acidulated\r\nwater. The bottom disc of copper has a strip which connects with a cup\r\nof acid, and one wire terminal (A) runs therefrom. The upper disc, which\r\nis of zinc, is also connected, by a strip, with a cup of acid from which\r\nextends the other terminal wire (B).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 20._ VOLTAIC ELECTRICITY]\r\n\r\n_Plus and Minus Signs._--It will be noted that the positive or copper\r\ndisc has the plus sign (+) while the zinc disc has the minus (-) sign.\r\nThese signs denote the positive and the negative sides of the current.\r\n\r\nThe liquid in the cells, or in the moistened paper, is called the\r\n_electrolyte_ and the plates or discs are called _electrodes_. To define\r\nthem more clearly, the positive plate is the _anode_, and the negative\r\nplate the _cathode_.\r\n\r\nThe current, upon entering the zinc plate, decomposes the water in the\r\nelectrolyte, thereby forming oxygen. The hydrogen in the water, which\r\nhas also been formed by the decomposition, is carried to the copper\r\nplate, so that the plate finally is so coated with hydrogen that it is\r\ndifficult for the current to pass through. This condition is called\r\n"polarization," and to prevent it has been the aim of all inventors. To\r\nit also we may attribute the great variety of primary batteries, each\r\nhaving some distinctive claim of merit.\r\n\r\nTHE COMMON PRIMARY CELL.--The most common form of primary cell contains\r\nsulphuric acid, or a sulphuric acid solution, as the electrolyte, with\r\nzinc for the _anode_, and carbon, instead of copper, for the _cathode_.\r\n\r\nThe ends of the zinc and copper plates are called _terminals_, and while\r\nthe zinc is the anode or positive element, its _terminal_ is designated\r\nas the positive pole. In like manner, the carbon is the negative\r\nelement or cathode, and its terminal is designated as negative pole.\r\n\r\nFig. 21 will show the relative arrangement of the parts. It is customary\r\nto term that end or element from which the current flows as positive. A\r\ncell is regarded as a whole, and as the current passes out of the cell\r\nfrom the copper element, the copper terminal becomes positive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 21._ PRIMARY BATTERY]\r\n\r\nBATTERY RESISTANCE, ELECTROLYTE AND CURRENT.--The following should be\r\ncarefully memorized:\r\n\r\nA cell has reference to a single vessel. When two or more cells are\r\ncoupled together they form a _battery_.\r\n\r\n_Resistance_ is opposition to the movement of the current. If it is\r\noffered by the electrolyte, it is designated "Internal Resistance." If,\r\non the other hand, the opposition takes place, for instance, through the\r\nwire, it is then called "External Resistance."\r\n\r\nThe electrolyte must be either acid, or alkaline, or saline, and the\r\nelectrodes must be of dissimilar metals, so the electrolyte will attack\r\none of them.\r\n\r\nThe current is measured in amperes, and the force with which it is\r\ncaused to flow is measured in volts. In practice the word "current" is\r\nused to designate ampere flow; and electromotive force, or E. M. F., is\r\nused instead of voltage.\r\n\r\nELECTRO-MAGNETIC ELECTRICITY.--The third method of generating\r\nelectricity is by electro-magnets. The value and use of induction will\r\nnow be seen, and you will be enabled to utilize the lesson concerning\r\nmagnetic action referred to in the previous chapter.\r\n\r\nMAGNETIC RADIATION.--You will remember that every piece of metal which\r\nis within the path of an electric current has a space all about its\r\nsurface from end to end which is electrified. This electrified field\r\nextends out a certain distance from the metal, and is supposed to\r\nmaintain a movement around it. If, now, another piece of metal is\r\nbrought within range of this electric or magnetic zone and moved across\r\nit, so as to cut through this field, a current will be generated\r\nthereby, or rather added to the current already exerted, so that if we\r\nstart with a feeble current, it can be increased by rapidly "cutting the\r\nlines of force," as it is called.\r\n\r\nDIFFERENT KINDS OF DYNAMO.--While there are many kinds of dynamo, they\r\nall, without exception, are constructed in accordance with this\r\nprinciple. There are also many varieties of current. For instance, a\r\ndynamo may be made to produce a high voltage and a low amperage; another\r\nwith high amperage and low voltage; another which gives a direct current\r\nfor lighting, heating, power, and electroplating; still another which\r\ngenerates an alternating current for high tension power, or\r\ntransmission, arc-lighting, etc., all of which will be explained\r\nhereafter.\r\n\r\nIn this place, however, a full description of a direct-current dynamo\r\nwill explain the principle involved in all dynamos--that to generate a\r\ncurrent of electricity makes it necessary for us to move a field of\r\nforce, like an armature, rapidly and continuously through another field\r\nof force, like a magnetic field.\r\n\r\nDIRECT-CURRENT DYNAMO.--We shall now make the simplest form of dynamo,\r\nusing for this purpose a pair of permanent magnets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 22._ DYNAMO FIELD AND POLE PIECE]\r\n\r\nSIMPLE MAGNET CONSTRUCTION.--A simple way to make a pair of magnets for\r\nthis purpose is shown in Fig. 22. A piece of round 3/4-inch steel core\r\n(A), 5-1/2 inches long, is threaded at both ends to receive at one end a\r\nnut (B), which is screwed on a sufficient distance so that the end of\r\nthe core (A) projects a half inch beyond the nut. The other end of the\r\nsteel core has a pole piece of iron (C) 2" \xc3\x97 2" \xc3\x97 4", with a hole\r\nmidway between the ends, threaded entirely through, and provided along\r\none side with a concave channel, within which the armature is to turn.\r\nNow, before the pole piece (C) is put on, we will slip on a disc (E),\r\nmade of hard rubber, then a thin rubber tube (F), and finally a rubber\r\ndisc (G), so as to provide a positive insulation for the wire coil which\r\nis wound on the bobbin thus made.\r\n\r\nHOW TO WIND.--In practice, and as you go further along in this work, you\r\nwill learn the value, first, of winding one layer of insulated wire on\r\nthe spool, coating it with shellac, and then putting on the next layer,\r\nand so on; when completely wound, the two wire terminals may be brought\r\nout at one end; but for our present purpose, and to render the\r\nexplanation clearer, the wire terminals are at the opposite ends of the\r\nspool (H, H\').\r\n\r\nTHE DYNAMO FIELDS.--Two of these spools are so made and they are called\r\nthe _fields_ of the dynamo.\r\n\r\nWe will next prepare an iron bar (I), 5 inches long and 1/2 inch thick\r\nand 1-1/2 inches wide, then bore two holes through it so the distance\r\nmeasures 3 inches from center to center. These holes are to be threaded\r\nfor the 3/4-inch cores (A). This bar holds together the upper ends of\r\nthe cores, as shown in Fig. 23.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 23._ BASE AND FIELDS ASSEMBLED]\r\n\r\nWe then prepare a base (J) of any hard wood, 2 inches thick, 8 inches\r\nlong and 8 inches wide, and bore two 3/4-inch holes 3 inches apart on a\r\nmiddle line, to receive a pair of 3/4-inch cap screws (K), which pass\r\nupwardly through the holes in the base and screw into the pole pieces\r\n(C). A wooden bar (L), 1-1/2" \xc3\x97 1-1/2", 8 inches long, is placed under\r\neach pole piece, which is also provided with holes for the cap screws\r\n(K). The lower side of the base (J) should be countersunk, as at M, so\r\nthe head of the nut will not project. The fields of the dynamo are now\r\nsecured in position to the base.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 24._ DETAILS OF THE ARMATURE, CORE\r\n\r\n_Fig. 25._ DETAILS OF THE ARMATURE, BODY]\r\n\r\nTHE ARMATURE.--A bar of iron (Fig. 24), 1" \xc3\x97 1" and 2-1/4 inches long,\r\nis next provided. Through this bar (1) are then bored two 5/16-inch\r\nholes 1-3/4 inches apart, and on the opposite sides of this bar are two\r\nhalf-rounded plates of iron (3) (Fig. 25).\r\n\r\nARMATURE WINDING.--Each plate is 1/2 inch thick, 1-3/4 inches wide and 4\r\ninches long, each plate having holes (4) to coincide with the holes (2)\r\nof the bar (1), so that when the two plates are applied to opposite\r\nsides of the bar, and riveted together, a cylindrical member is formed,\r\nwith two channels running longitudinally, and transversely at the ends;\r\nand in these channels the insulated wires are wound from end to end\r\naround the central block (1).\r\n\r\nMOUNTING THE ARMATURE.--It is now necessary to provide a means for\r\nrevolving this armature. To this end a brass disc (5, Fig. 26) is made,\r\n2 inches in diameter, 1/8 inch thick. Centrally, at one side, is a\r\nprojecting stem (6) of round brass, which projects out 2 inches, and the\r\nouter end is turned down, as at 7, to form a small bearing surface.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 26._ JOURNALS _Fig. 27._ COMMUTATOR,\r\nARMATURE MOUNTINGS]\r\n\r\nThe other end of the armature has a similar disc (8), with a central\r\nstem (9), 1-1/2 inches long, turned down to 1/4-inch diameter up to\r\nwithin 1/4 inch of the disc (7), so as to form a shoulder.\r\n\r\nTHE COMMUTATOR.--In Fig. 27 is shown, at 10, a wooden cylinder, 1 inch\r\nlong and 1-1/4 inches in diameter, with a hole (11) bored through\r\naxially, so that it will fit tightly on the stem (6) of the disc (5). On\r\nthis wooden cylinder is driven a brass or copper tube (12), which has\r\nholes (13) opposite each other. Screws are used to hold the tube to the\r\nwooden cylinder, and after they are properly secured together, the tube\r\n(12) is cut by a saw, as at 14, so as to form two independent tubular\r\nsurfaces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 28._ END VIEW ARMATURE, MOUNTED]\r\n\r\nThese tubular sections are called the commutator plates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 29._ TOP VIEW OF ARMATURE ON BASE]\r\n\r\nIn order to mount this armature, two bearings are provided, each\r\ncomprising a bar of brass (15, Fig. 28), each 1/4 inch thick, 1/2 inch\r\nwide and 4-1/2 inches long. Two holes, 3 inches apart, are formed\r\nthrough this bar, to receive round-headed wood screws (16), these screws\r\nbeing 3 inches long, so they will pass through the wooden pieces (I)\r\nand enter the base (J). Midway between the ends, each bar (15) has an\r\niron bearing block (17), 3/4" \xc3\x97 1/2" and 1-1/2 inches high, the 1/4-inch\r\nhole for the journal (7) being midway between its ends.\r\n\r\nCOMMUTATOR BRUSHES.--Fig. 28 shows the base, armature and commutator\r\nassembled in position, and to these parts have been added the commutator\r\nbrushes. The brush holder (18) is a horizontal bar made of hard rubber\r\nloosely mounted upon the journal pin (7), which is 2-1/2 inches long. At\r\neach end is a right-angled metal arm (19) secured to the bar (18) by\r\nscrews (20). To these arms the brushes (21) are attached, so that their\r\nspring ends engage with the commutator (12). An adjusting screw (22) in\r\nthe bearing post (17), with the head thereof bearing against the\r\nbrush-holder (18), serves as a means for revolubly adjusting the brushes\r\nwith relation to the commutator.\r\n\r\nDYNAMO WINDINGS.--There are several ways to wind the dynamos. These\r\ncan be shown better by the following diagrams (Figs. 30, 31, 32, 33):\r\n\r\nTHE FIELD.--If the field (A, Fig. 30) is not a permanent magnet, it must\r\nbe excited by a cell or battery, and the wires (B, B\') are connected up\r\nwith a battery, while the wires (C, C\') may be connected up to run a\r\nmotor. This would, therefore, be what is called a "separately excited"\r\ndynamo. In this case the battery excites the field and the armature\r\n(D), cutting the lines of force at the pole pieces (E), so that the\r\narmature gathers the current for the wires (C, C\').\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 30._ FIELD WINDING]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 31._ SERIES-WOUND]\r\n\r\nSERIES-WOUND FIELD.--Fig. 31 shows a "series-wound" dynamo. The wires of\r\nthe fields (A) are connected up in series with the brushes of the\r\narmature (D), and the wires (G, G\') are led out and connected up with a\r\nlamp, motor or other mechanism. In this case, as well as in Figs. 32 and\r\n33, both the field and the armature are made of soft gray iron. With\r\nthis winding and means of connecting the wires, the field is constantly\r\nexcited by the current passing through the wires.\r\n\r\nSHUNT-WOUND FIELD.--Fig. 32 represents what is known as a "shunt-wound"\r\ndynamo. Here the field wires (H, H) connect with the opposite brushes\r\nof the armature, and the wires (I, I\') are also connected with the\r\nbrushes, these two wires being provided to perform the work required.\r\nThis is a more useful form of winding for electroplating purposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 32._ SHUNT-WOUND _Fig. 32._ COMPOUND-WOUND]\r\n\r\nCOMPOUND-WOUND FIELD.--Fig. 33 is a diagram of a "compound-wound"\r\ndynamo. The regular field winding (J) has its opposite ends connected\r\ndirectly with the armature brushes. There is also a winding, of a\r\ncomparatively few turns, of a thicker wire, one terminal (K) of which is\r\nconnected with one of the brushes and the other terminal (K\') forms one\r\nside of the lighting circuit. A wire (L) connects with the other\r\narmature brush to form a complete lighting circuit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nHOW TO DETECT AND MEASURE ELECTRICITY\r\n\r\n\r\nMEASURING INSTRUMENTS.--The production of an electric current would not\r\nbe of much value unless we had some way by which we might detect and\r\nmeasure it. The pound weight, the foot rule and the quart measure are\r\nvery simple devices, but without them very little business could be\r\ndone. There must be a standard of measurement in electricity as well as\r\nin dealing with iron or vegetables or fabrics.\r\n\r\nAs electricity cannot be seen by the human eye, some mechanism must be\r\nmade which will reveal its movements.\r\n\r\nTHE DETECTOR.--It has been shown in the preceding chapter that a current\r\nof electricity passing through a wire will cause a current to pass\r\nthrough a parallel wire, if the two wires are placed close together, but\r\nnot actually in contact with each other. An instrument which reveals\r\nthis condition is called a _galvanometer_. It not only detects the\r\npresence of a current, but it shows the direction of its flow. We shall\r\nnow see how this is done.\r\n\r\nFor example, the wire (A, Fig. 35) is connected up in an electric\r\ncircuit with a permanent magnet (B) suspended by a fine wire (C), so\r\nthat the magnet (B) may freely revolve.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 34._     _Fig. 35._      _Fig. 36._\r\n             TO THE RIGHT,  COMPASS MAGNET,  TO THE LEFT]\r\n\r\nFor convenience, the magnetic field is shown flowing in the direction of\r\nthe darts, in which the dart (D) represents the current within the\r\nmagnet (B) flowing toward the north pole, and the darts (E) showing the\r\nexterior current flowing toward the south pole. Now, if the wire (A) is\r\nbrought up close to the magnet (B), and a current passed through A, the\r\nmagnet (B) will be affected. Fig. 35 shows the normal condition of the\r\nmagnetized bar (B) parallel with the wire (A) when a current is not\r\npassing through the latter.\r\n\r\nDIRECTION OF CURRENT.--If the current should go through the wire (A)\r\nfrom right to left, as shown in Fig. 34, the magnet (B) would swing in\r\nthe direction taken by the hands of a clock and assume the position\r\nshown in Fig. 34. If, on the other hand, the current in the wire (A)\r\nshould be reversed or flow from left to right, the magnet (B) would\r\nswing counter-clock-wise, and assume the position shown in Fig. 36. The\r\nlittle pointer (G) would, in either case, point in the direction of the\r\nflow of the current through the wire (A).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 37._ INDICATING DIRECTION OF CURRENT]\r\n\r\nSIMPLE CURRENT DETECTOR.--A simple current detector may be made as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\nPrepare a base 3\' \xc3\x97 4\' in size and 1 inch thick. At each corner of one\r\nend fix a binding post, as at A, A\', Fig. 37. Then select 20 feet of No.\r\n28 cotton-insulated wire, and make a coil (B) 2 inches in diameter,\r\nleaving the ends free, so they may be affixed to the binding posts (A,\r\nA\'). Now glue or nail six blocks (C) to the base, each block being 1" \xc3\x97\r\n1" \xc3\x97 2", and lay the coil on these blocks. Then drive an L-shaped nail\r\n(D) down into each block, on the inside of the coil, as shown, so as to\r\nhold the latter in place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 38._ THE BRIDGE]\r\n\r\nNow make a bridge (E, Fig. 38) of a strip of brass 1/2 inch wide, 1/16\r\ninch thick and long enough to span the coil, and bend the ends down, as\r\nat F, so as to form legs. A screw hole (G) is formed in each foot, so it\r\nmay be screwed to the base.\r\n\r\nMidway between the ends this bridge has a transverse slot (H) in one\r\nedge, to receive therein the pivot pin of the swinging magnet. In order\r\nto hold the pivot pin in place, cut out an H-shaped piece of sheet brass\r\n(I), which, when laid on the bridge, has its ends bent around the\r\nlatter, as shown at J, and the crossbar of the H-shaped piece then will\r\nprevent the pivot pin from coming out of the slot (H).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 39._ DETAILS OF DETECTOR]\r\n\r\nThe magnet is made of a bar of steel (K, Fig. 39) 1-1/2 inches long, 3/8\r\ninch wide and 1/16 inch thick, a piece of a clock spring being very\r\nserviceable for this purpose. The pivot pin is made of an ordinary pin\r\n(L), and as it is difficult to solder the steel magnet (K) to the pin,\r\nsolder only a small disc (M) to the pin (L). Then bore a hole (N)\r\nthrough the middle of the magnet (K), larger in diameter than the pin\r\n(L), and, after putting the pin in the hole, pour sealing wax into the\r\nhole, and thereby secure the two parts together. Near the upper end of\r\nthe pin (L) solder the end of a pointer (O), this pointer being at right\r\nangles to the armature (K). It is better to have a metal socket for the\r\nlower end of the pin. When these parts are put together, as shown in\r\nFig. 37, a removable glass top, or cover, should be provided.\r\n\r\nThis is shown in Fig. 40, in which a square, wooden frame (P) is used,\r\nand a glass (Q) fitted into the frame, the glass being so arranged that\r\nwhen the cover is in position it will be in close proximity to the upper\r\nprojecting end of the pivot pin (L), and thus prevent the magnet from\r\nbecoming misplaced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 40._ CROSS SECTION OF DETECTOR]\r\n\r\nHOW TO PLACE THE DETECTOR.--If the detector is placed north and south,\r\nas shown by the two markings, N and S (Fig. 37), the magnet bar will\r\npoint north and south, being affected by the earth\'s magnetism; but when\r\na current of electricity flows through the coil (B), the magnet will be\r\ndeflected to the right or to the left, so that the pointer (O) will then\r\nshow the direction in which the current is flowing through the wire (R)\r\nwhich you are testing.\r\n\r\nThe next step of importance is to _measure_ the current, that is, to\r\ndetermine its strength or intensity, as well as the flow or quantity.\r\n\r\nDIFFERENT WAYS OF MEASURING A CURRENT.--There are several ways to\r\nmeasure the properties of a current, which may be defined as follows:\r\n\r\n1. THE SULPHURIC ACID VOLTAMETER.--By means of an electrolytic action,\r\nwhereby the current decomposes an acidulated solution--that is, water\r\nwhich has in it a small amount of sulphuric acid--and then measuring the\r\ngas generated by the current.\r\n\r\n2. THE COPPER VOLTAMETER.--By electro-chemical means, in which the\r\ncurrent passes through plates immersed in a solution of copper sulphate.\r\n\r\n3. THE GALVANOSCOPE.--By having a coil of insulated wire, with a magnet\r\nsuspended so as to turn freely within the coil, forming what is called a\r\ngalvanoscope.\r\n\r\n4. ELECTRO-MAGNETIC METHOD.--By using a pair of magnets and sending a\r\ncurrent through the coils, and then measuring the pull on the armature.\r\n\r\n5. THE POWER OR SPEED METHOD.--By using an electric fan, and noting the\r\nrevolutions produced by the current.\r\n\r\n6. THE CALORIMETER.--By using a coil of bare wire, immersed in paraffine\r\noil, and then measuring the temperature by means of a thermometer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 41._ ACID VOLTAMETER]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 42._ COPPER VOLTAMETER]\r\n\r\n7. THE LIGHT METHOD.--Lastly, by means of an electric light, which\r\nshows, by its brightness, a greater or less current.\r\n\r\nTHE PREFERRED METHODS.--It has been found that the first and second\r\nmethods are the only ones which will accurately register current\r\nstrength, and these methods have this advantage--that the chemical\r\neffect produced is not dependent upon the size or shape of the apparatus\r\nor the plates used.\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE A SULPHURIC ACID VOLTAMETER.--In Fig. 41 is shown a simple\r\nform of sulphuric acid voltameter, to illustrate the first method. A is\r\na jar, tightly closed by a cover (B). Within is a pair of platinum\r\nplates (C, C), each having a wire (D) through the cover. The cover has a\r\nvertical glass tube (E) through it, which extends down to the bottom of\r\nthe jar, the electrolyte therein being a weak solution of sulphuric\r\nacid. When a current passes through the wires (D), the solution is\r\npartially decomposed--that is, converted into gas, which passes up into\r\nthe vacant space (F) above the liquid, and, as it cannot escape, it\r\npresses the liquid downwardly, and causes the latter to flow upwardly\r\ninto the tube (E). It is then an easy matter, after the current is on\r\nfor a certain time, to determine its strength by the height of the\r\nliquid in the tube.\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE A COPPER VOLTAMETER.--The second, or copper voltameter, is\r\nshown in Fig. 42. The glass jar (A) contains a solution of copper\r\nsulphate, known in commerce as blue vitriol. A pair of copper plates\r\n(B, B\') are placed in this solution, each being provided with a\r\nconnecting wire (C). When a current passes through the wires (C), one\r\ncopper plate (B) is eaten away and deposited on the other plate (B\'). It\r\nis then an easy matter to take out the plates and find out how much in\r\nweight B\' has gained, or how much B has lost.\r\n\r\nIn this way, in comparing the strength of, say, two separate currents,\r\none should have each current pass through the voltameter the same length\r\nof time as the other, so as to obtain comparative results.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary, in the first and second methods, to consider the\r\nshapes, the sizes of the plates or the distances between them. In the\r\nfirst method the gas produced, within a given time, will be the same,\r\nand in the second method the amount deposited or eaten away will be the\r\nsame under all conditions.\r\n\r\nDISADVANTAGES OF THE GALVANOSCOPE.--With the third method (using the\r\ngalvanoscope) it is necessary, in order to get a positively correct\r\nreading instrument, to follow an absolutely accurate plan in\r\nconstructing each part, in every detail, and great care must be\r\nexercised, particularly in winding. It is necessary also to be very\r\ncareful in selecting the sizes of wire used and in the number of turns\r\nmade in the coils.\r\n\r\nThis is equally true of the fourth method, using the electro-magnet,\r\nbecause the magnetic pull is dependent upon the size of wire from which\r\nthe coils are made and the number of turns of wire.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIONS TO THE CALORIMETER.--The calorimeter, or sixth method, has\r\nthe same objection. The galvanoscope and electro-magnet do not respond\r\nequally to all currents, and this is also true, even to a greater\r\nextent, with the calorimeter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nVOLTS, AMPERES, OHMS AND WATTS\r\n\r\n\r\nUNDERSTANDING TERMS.--We must now try to ascertain the meaning of some\r\nof the terms so frequently used in connection with electricity. If you\r\nintended to sell or measure produce or goods of any kind, it would be\r\nessential to know how many pints or quarts are contained in a gallon, or\r\nin a bushel, or how many inches there are in a yard, and you also ought\r\nto know just what the quantity term _bushel_ or the measurement _yard_\r\nmeans.\r\n\r\nINTENSITY AND QUANTITY.--Electricity, while it has no weight, is capable\r\nof being measured by means of its intensity, or by its quantity. Light\r\nmay be measured or tested by its brilliancy. If one light is of less\r\nintensity than another and both of them receive their impulses from the\r\nsame source, there must be something which interferes with that light\r\nwhich shows the least brilliancy. Electricity can also be interfered\r\nwith, and this interference is called _resistance_.\r\n\r\nVOLTAGE.--Water may be made to flow with greater or less force, or\r\nvelocity, through a pipe, the degree of same depending upon the height\r\nof the water which supplies the pipe. So with electricity. It may pass\r\nover a wire with greater or less force under one condition than another.\r\nThis force is called voltage. If we have a large pipe, a much greater\r\nquantity of water will flow through it than will pass through a small\r\npipe, providing the pressure in each case is alike. This quantity in\r\nelectricity is called _amperage_.\r\n\r\nIn the case of water, a column 1" \xc3\x97 1", 28 inches in height, weighs 1\r\npound; so that if a pipe 1 inch square draws water from the bottom it\r\nflows with a pressure of 1 pound. If the pipe has a measurement of 2\r\nsquare inches, double the quantity of water will flow therefrom, at the\r\nsame pressure.\r\n\r\nAMPERAGE.--If, on the other hand, we have a pipe 1 inch square, and\r\nthere is a depth of 56 inches of water in the reservoir, we shall get as\r\nmuch water from the reservoir as though we had a pipe of 2 square inches\r\ndrawing water from a reservoir which is 28 inches deep.\r\n\r\nMEANING OF WATTS.--It is obvious, therefore, that if we multiply the\r\nheight of the water in inches with the area of the pipe, we shall obtain\r\na factor which will show how much water is flowing.\r\n\r\nHere are two examples:\r\n\r\n1. 28 inches = height of the water in the reservoir.\r\n\r\n2 square inches = size of the pipe.\r\nMultiply 28 \xc3\x97 2 = 56.\r\n\r\n2. 56 = height of the water in the reservoir.\r\n1 square inch = size of the pipe.\r\nMultiply 56 \xc3\x97 1 = 56.\r\n\r\nThus the two problems are equal.\r\n\r\nA KILOWATT.--Now, in electricity, remembering that the height of the\r\nwater corresponds with _voltage_ in electricity, and the size of the\r\npipe with _amperage_, if we multiply volts by amperes, or amperes by\r\nvolts, we get a result which is indicated by the term _watts_. One\r\nthousand of these watts make a kilowatt, and the latter is the standard\r\nof measurement by which a dynamo or motor is judged or rated.\r\n\r\nThus, if we have 5 amperes and 110 volts, the result of multiplying them\r\nwould be 550 watts, or 5 volts and 110 amperes would produce 550 watts.\r\n\r\nA STANDARD OF MEASUREMENT.--But with all this we must have some\r\nstandard. A bushel measure is of a certain size, and a foot has a\r\ndefinite length, so in electricity there is a recognized force and\r\nquantity which are determined as follows:\r\n\r\nTHE AMPERE STANDARD.--It is necessary, first, to determine what an\r\nampere is. For this purpose a standard solution of nitrate of silver is\r\nused, and a current of electricity is passed through this solution. In\r\ndoing so the current deposits silver at the rate of 0.001118 grains per\r\nsecond for each ampere.\r\n\r\nTHE VOLTAGE STANDARD.--In order to determine the voltage we must know\r\nsomething of _resistance_. Different metals do not transmit a current\r\nwith equal ease. The size of a conductor, also, is an important factor\r\nin the passage of a current. A large conductor will transmit a current\r\nmuch better than a small conductor. We must therefore have a standard\r\nfor the _ohm_, which is the measure of resistance.\r\n\r\nTHE OHM.--It is calculated in this way: There are several standards, but\r\nthe one most generally employed is the _International Ohm_. To determine\r\nit, by this system, a column of pure mercury, 106.3 millimeters long and\r\nweighing 14.4521 grams, is used. This would make a square tube about 94\r\ninches long, and a little over 1/25 of an inch in diameter. The\r\nresistance to a current flow in such a column would be equal to 1 ohm.\r\n\r\nCALCULATING THE VOLTAGE.--In order to arrive at the voltage we must use\r\na conductor, which, with a resistance of 1 ohm, will produce 1 ampere.\r\nIt must be remembered that the volt is the practical unit of\r\nelectro-motive force.\r\n\r\nWhile it would be difficult for the boy to conduct these experiments in\r\nthe absence of suitable apparatus, still, it is well to understand\r\nthoroughly how and why these standards are made and used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nPUSH BUTTONS, SWITCHES, ANNUNCIATORS, BELLS AND\r\nLIKE APPARATUS\r\n\r\n\r\nSIMPLE SWITCHES.--We have now gone over the simpler or elementary\r\noutlines of electrical phenomena, and we may commence to do some of the\r\npractical work in the art. We need certain apparatus to make\r\nconnections, which will be constructed first.\r\n\r\nA TWO-POLE SWITCH.--A simple two-pole switch for a single line is made\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nA base block (A, Fig. 43) 3 inches long, 2 inches wide and 3/4 inch\r\nthick, has on it, at one end, a binding screw (B), which holds a pair of\r\nfingers (C) of brass or copper, these fingers being bent upwardly and so\r\narranged as to serve as fingers to hold a switch bar (D) between them.\r\nThis bar is also of copper or brass and is pivoted to the fingers. Near\r\nthe other end of the base is a similar binding screw (E) and fingers (F)\r\nto receive the blade of the switch bar. The bar has a handle (G) of\r\nwood. The wires are attached to the respective binding screws (B, E).\r\n\r\nDOUBLE-POLE SWITCH.--A double-pole switch or a switch for a double line\r\nis shown in Fig. 44. This is made similar in all respects to the one\r\nshown in Fig. 43, excepting that there are two switch blades (A, A)\r\nconnected by a cross bar (B) of insulating material, and this bar\r\ncarries the handle (C).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 43._ TWO-POLE SWITCH]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 44._ DOUBLE-POLE SWITCH]\r\n\r\nOther types of switch will be found very useful. In Fig. 45 is a simple\r\nsliding switch in which the base block has, at one end, a pair of copper\r\nplates (A, B), each held at one end to the base by a binding screw (C),\r\nand having a bearing or contact surface (D) at its other end. At the\r\nother end of the base is a copper plate (E) held by a binding screw (F),\r\nto the inner end of which plate is hinged a swinging switch blade (G),\r\nthe free end of which is adapted to engage with the plates (A, B).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 45._ SLIDING SWITCH]\r\n\r\nSLIDING SWITCH.--This sliding switch form may have the contact plates\r\n(A, B and C, Fig. 46) circularly arranged and any number may be located\r\non the base, so they may be engaged by a single switching lever (H). It\r\nis the form usually adopted for rheostats.\r\n\r\nREVERSING SWITCH.--A reversing switch is shown in Fig. 47. The base has\r\ntwo plates (A, B) at one end, to which the parallel switch bars (C, D)\r\nare hinged. The other end of the base has three contact plates (E, F, G)\r\nto engage the swinging switch bars, these latter being at such distance\r\napart that they will engage with the middle and one of the outer plates.\r\nThe inlet wires, positive and negative, are attached to the plates (A,\r\nB, respectively), and one of the outlet wires (H) is attached to the\r\nmiddle contact plate (F), while the other wire is connected up with both\r\nof the outside plates. When the switch bars (C, D) are thrown to the\r\nleft so as to be in contact with E, F, the outside plate (E) and the\r\nmiddle plate (F) will be positive and negative, respectively; but when\r\nthe switch is thrown to the right, as shown in the figure, plate F\r\nbecomes positive and plate E negative, as shown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 46._ RHEOSTAT FORM OF SWITCH]\r\n\r\nPUSH BUTTONS.--A push button is but a modified structure of a switch,\r\nand they are serviceable because they are operating, or the circuit is\r\nformed only while the finger is on the button.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 47._ REVERSING SWITCH]\r\n\r\nIn its simplest form (Fig. 48) the push button has merely a circular\r\nbase (A) of insulating material, and near one margin, on the flat side,\r\nis a rectangular plate (B), intended to serve as a contact plate as well\r\nas a means for attaching one of the wires thereto. In line with this\r\nplate is a spring finger (C), bent upwardly so that it is normally out\r\nof contact with the plate (B), its end being held by a binding screw\r\n(D). To effect contact, the spring end of the finger (C) is pressed\r\nagainst the bar (B), as at E. This is enclosed in a suitable casing,\r\nsuch as will readily suggest itself to the novice.\r\n\r\nELECTRIC BELL.--One of the first things the boy wants to make, and one\r\nwhich is also an interesting piece of work, is an electric bell.\r\n\r\nTo make this he will be brought, experimentally, in touch with several\r\nimportant features in electrical work. He must make a battery for the\r\nproduction of current, a pair of electro-magnets to be acted upon by the\r\ncurrent, a switch to control it, and, finally, he must learn how to\r\nconnect it up so that it may be operated not only from one, but from two\r\nor more push buttons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 48._ PUSH BUTTON]\r\n\r\nHOW MADE.--In Fig. 49 is shown an electric bell, as usually constructed,\r\nso modified as to show the structure at a glance, with its connections.\r\nA is the base, B, B\' the binding posts for the wires, C, C the\r\nelectro-magnets, C\' the bracket for holding the magnets, D the armature,\r\nE the thin spring which connects the armature with the post F, G the\r\nclapper arm, H the bell, I the adjusting screw on the post J, K the wire\r\nlead from the binding post B to the first magnet, L the wire which\r\nconnects the two magnets, M the wire which runs from the second magnet\r\nto the post J, and N a wire leading from the armature post to the\r\nbinding post B\'.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 49._ ELECTRIC BELL]\r\n\r\nThe principle of the electric bell is this: In looking at Fig. 49, you\r\nwill note that the armature bar D is held against the end of the\r\nadjusting screw by the small spring E. When a current is turned on, it\r\npasses through the connections and conduits as follows: Wire K to the\r\nmagnets, wire M to the binding post J, and set screw I, then through the\r\narmature to the post F, and from post F to the binding post B\'.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 50._ ARMATURE OF ELECTRIC BELL]\r\n\r\nELECTRIC BELL--HOW OPERATED.--The moment a current passes through the\r\nmagnets (C, C), the core is magnetized, and the result is that the\r\narmature (D) is attracted to the magnets, as shown by the dotted lines\r\n(O), when the clapper strikes the bell. But when the armature moves over\r\nto the magnet, the connection is broken between the screw (I) and\r\narmature (D), so that the cores of the magnets are demagnetized and lose\r\ntheir pull, and the spring (E) succeeds in drawing back the armature.\r\nThis operation of vibrating the armature is repeated with great\r\nrapidity, alternately breaking and re-establishing the circuit, by the\r\naction of the current.\r\n\r\nIn making the bell, you must observe one thing, the binding posts (B,\r\nB\') must be insulated from each other, and the post J, or the post F,\r\nshould also be insulated from the base. For convenience we show the post\r\nF insulated, so as to necessitate the use of wire (N) from post (F) to\r\nbinding post (B\').\r\n\r\nThe foregoing assumes that you have used a cast metal base, as most\r\nbells are now made; but if you use a wooden base, the binding posts (B,\r\nB\') and the posts (F, J) are insulated from each other, and the\r\nconstruction is much simplified.\r\n\r\nIt is better, in practice, to have a small spring (P, Fig. 50) between\r\nthe armature (D) and the end of the adjusting screw (I), so as to give a\r\nreturn impetus to the clapper. The object of the adjusting screw is to\r\npush and hold the armature close up to the ends of the magnets, if it\r\nseems necessary.\r\n\r\nIf two bells are placed on the base with the clapper mounted between\r\nthem, both bells will be struck by the swinging motion of the armature.\r\n\r\nAn easily removable cap or cover is usually placed over the coils and\r\narmature, to keep out dust.\r\n\r\nA very simple annunciator may be attached to the bell, as shown in the\r\nfollowing figures:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figs. 51-54._ ANNUNCIATOR]\r\n\r\nANNUNCIATORS.--Make a box of wood, with a base (A) 4" \xc3\x97 5" and 1/2 inch\r\nthick. On this you can permanently mount the two side pieces (B) and two\r\ntop and bottom pieces (C), respectively, so they project outwardly\r\n4-1/2 inches from the base. On the open front place a wood or metal\r\nplate (D), provided with a square opening (D), as in Fig. 54, near its\r\nlower end. This plate is held to the box by screws (E).\r\n\r\nWithin is a magnet (F), screwed into the base (A), as shown in Fig. 51;\r\nand pivoted to the bottom of the box is a vertical armature (G), which\r\nextends upwardly and contacts with the core of the magnet. The upper end\r\nof the armature has a shoulder (H), which is in such position that it\r\nserves as a rest for a V-shaped stirrup (I), which is hinged at J to the\r\nbase (C). This stirrup carries the number plate (K), and when it is\r\nraised to its highest point it is held on the shoulder (H), unless the\r\nelectro-magnet draws the armature out of range of the stirrup. A spring\r\n(L) bearing against the inner side of the armature keeps its upper end\r\nnormally away from the magnet core. When the magnet draws the armature\r\ninwardly, the number plate drops and exposes the numeral through the\r\nopening in the front of the box. In order to return the number plate to\r\nits original position, as shown in Fig. 51, a vertical trigger (M)\r\npasses up through the bottom, its upper end being within range of one of\r\nthe limbs of the stirrup.\r\n\r\nThis is easily made by the ingenious boy, and will be quite an\r\nacquisition to his stock of instruments. In practice, the annunciator\r\nmay be located in any convenient place and wires run to that point.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 55._ ALARM SWITCH ON WINDOW]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 56._ BURGLAR ALARM ATTACHMENT TO WINDOW]\r\n\r\nBURGLAR ALARM.--In order to make a burglar alarm connection with a bell,\r\npush buttons or switches may be put in circuit to connect with the\r\nwindows and doors, and by means of the annunciators you may locate the\r\ndoor or window which has been opened. The simplest form of switch for a\r\nwindow is shown in the following figures:\r\n\r\nThe base piece (A), which may be of hard rubber or fiber, is 1/4 inch\r\nthick and 1" \xc3\x97 1-1/2" in size.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 57._ BURGLAR ALARM CONTACT]\r\n\r\nAt one end is a brass plate (B), with a hole for a wood screw (C), this\r\nscrew being designed to pass through the plate and also into the\r\nwindow-frame, so as to serve as a means of attaching one of the wires\r\nthereto. The inner end of the plate has a hole for a round-headed screw\r\n(C\') that also goes through the base and into the window-frame. It also\r\npasses through the lower end of the heart-shaped metal switch-piece\r\n(D).\r\n\r\nThe upper end of the base has a brass plate (E), also secured to the\r\nbase and window by a screw (F) at its upper end. The heart-shaped switch\r\nis of such length and width at its upper end that when it is swung to\r\nthe right with one of the lobes projecting past the edge of the\r\nwindow-frame, the other lobe will be out of contact with the plate (E).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 58._ NEUTRAL POSITION OF CONTACT]\r\n\r\nThe window sash (G) has a removable pin (H), which, when the sash moves\r\nupwardly, is in the path of the lobe of the heart-shaped switch, as\r\nshown in Fig. 56, and in this manner the pin (H) moves the upper end of\r\nthe switch (D) inwardly, so that the other lobe contacts with the plate\r\n(E), and establishes an electric circuit, as shown in Fig. 57. During\r\nthe daytime the pin (H) may be removed, and in order to protect the\r\nswitch the heart-shaped piece (D) is swung inwardly, as shown in Fig.\r\n58, so that neither of the lobes is in contact with the plate (E).\r\n\r\nWIRE CIRCUITING.--For the purpose of understanding fully the circuiting,\r\ndiagrams will be shown of the simple electric bell with two push\r\nbuttons; next in order, the circuiting with an annunciator and then the\r\ncircuiting necessary for a series of windows and doors, with annunciator\r\nattachments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 59._ CIRCUITING FOR ELECTRIC BELL]\r\n\r\nCIRCUITING SYSTEM WITH A BELL AND TWO PUSH BUTTONS.--Fig. 59 shows a\r\nsimple circuiting system which has two push buttons, although any number\r\nmay be used, so that the bell will ring when the circuit is closed by\r\neither button.\r\n\r\nTHE PUSH BUTTONS AND THE ANNUNCIATOR BELLS.--Fig. 60 shows three push\r\nbuttons and an annunciator for each button. These three circuits are\r\nindicated by A, B and C, so that when either button makes contact, a\r\ncomplete circuit is formed through the corresponding annunciator.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 60._ _Annunciators_]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 61._ WIRING SYSTEM FOR A HOUSE]\r\n\r\nWIRING UP A HOUSE.--The system of wiring up a house so that all doors\r\nand windows will be connected to form a burglar alarm outfit, is shown\r\nin Fig. 61. It will be understood that, in practice, the bell is mounted\r\non or at the annunciator, and that, for convenience, the annunciator\r\nbox has also a receptacle for the battery. The circuiting is shown\r\ndiagramatically, as it is called, so as fully to explain how the lines\r\nare run. Two windows and a door are connected up with an annunciator\r\nhaving three drops, or numbers 1, 2, 3. The circuit runs from one pole\r\nof the battery to the bell and then to one post of the annunciator. From\r\nthe other post a wire runs to one terminal of the switch at the door or\r\nwindow. The other switch terminal has a wire running to the other pole\r\nof the battery.\r\n\r\nA, B, C represent the circuit wires from the terminals of the window and\r\ndoor switches, to the annunciators.\r\n\r\nIt is entirely immaterial which side of the battery is connected up with\r\nthe bell.\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing it will readily be understood how to connect up any\r\nordinary apparatus, remembering that in all cases the magnet must be\r\nbrought into the electric circuit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nACCUMULATORS. STORAGE OR SECONDARY BATTERIES\r\n\r\n\r\nSTORING UP ELECTRICITY.--In the foregoing chapters we have seen that,\r\noriginally, electricity was confined in a bottle, called the Leyden jar,\r\nfrom which it was wholly discharged at a single impulse, as soon as it\r\nwas connected up by external means. Later the primary battery and the\r\ndynamo were invented to generate a constant current, and after these\r\ncame the second form of storing electricity, called the storage or\r\nsecondary battery, and later still recognized as accumulators.\r\n\r\nTHE ACCUMULATOR.--The term _accumulator_ is, strictly speaking, the more\r\nnearly correct, as electricity is, in reality, "_stored_" in an\r\naccumulator. But when an accumulator is charged by a current of\r\nelectricity, a chemical change is gradually produced in the active\r\nelement of which the accumulator is made. This change or decomposition\r\ncontinues so long as the charging current is on. When the accumulator is\r\ndisconnected from the charging battery or dynamo, and its terminals are\r\nconnected up with a lighting system, or with a motor, for instance, a\r\nreverse process is set up, or the particles re-form themselves into\r\ntheir original compositions, which causes a current to flow in a\r\ndirection opposite to that of the charging current.\r\n\r\nIt is immaterial to the purposes of this chapter, as to the charging\r\nsource, whether it be by batteries or dynamos; the same principles will\r\napply in either case.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 62._ ACCUMULATOR GRIDS]\r\n\r\nACCUMULATOR PLATES.--The elements used for accumulator plates are red\r\nlead for the positive plates, and precipitated lead, or the well-known\r\nlitharge, for the negative plates. Experience has shown that the best\r\nway to hold this material is by means of lead grids.\r\n\r\nFig. 62 shows the typical form of one of these grids. It is made of\r\nlead, cast or molded in one piece, usually square, as at A, with a wing\r\nor projection (B), at one margin, extending upwardly and provided with a\r\nhole (C). The grid is about a quarter of an inch thick.\r\n\r\nTHE GRID.--The open space, called the grid, proper, comprises cross\r\nbars, integral with the plate, made in a variety of shapes. Fig. 62\r\nshows three forms of constructing these bars or ribs, the object being\r\nto provide a form which will hold in the lead paste, which is pressed in\r\nso as to make a solid-looking plate when completed.\r\n\r\nTHE POSITIVE PLATE.--The positive plate is made in the following manner:\r\nMake a stiff paste of red lead and sulphuric acid; using a solution,\r\nsay, of one part of acid to two parts of water. The grid is laid on a\r\nflat surface and the paste forced into the perforations with a stiff\r\nknife or spatula. Turn over the grid so as to get the paste in evenly on\r\nboth sides.\r\n\r\nThe grid is then stood on its edge, from 18 to 20 hours, to dry, and\r\nafterwards immersed in a concentrated solution of chloride of lime, so\r\nas to convert it into lead peroxide. When the action is complete it is\r\nthoroughly rinsed in cold water, and is ready to use.\r\n\r\nTHE NEGATIVE PLATE.--The negative plate is filled, in like manner, with\r\nprecipitated lead. This lead is made by putting a strip of zinc into a\r\nstandard solution of acetate of lead, and crystals will then form on the\r\nzinc. These will be very thin, and will adhere together, firmly, forming\r\na porous mass. This, when saturated and kept under water for a short\r\ntime, may be put into the openings of the negative plate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 63._ ASSEMBLAGE OF ACCUMULATOR PLATES]\r\n\r\nCONNECTING UP THE PLATES.--The next step is to put these plates in\r\nposition to form a battery. In Fig. 63 is shown a collection of plates\r\nconnected together.\r\n\r\nFor simplicity in illustrating, the cell is made up of glass, porcelain,\r\nor hard rubber, with five plates (A), A, A representing the negative and\r\nB, B the positive plates. A base of grooved strips (C, C) is placed in\r\nthe batteries of the cell to receive the lower ends of the plates. The\r\npositive plates are held apart by means of a short section of tubing\r\n(D), which is clamped and held within the plates by a bolt (E), this\r\nbolt also being designed to hold the terminal strip (F).\r\n\r\nIn like manner, the negative plates are held apart by the two tubular\r\nsections (G), each of which is of the same length as the section D of\r\nthe positives. The bolt (H) holds the negatives together as well as the\r\nterminal (I). The terminals should be lead strips, and it would be well,\r\nowing to the acid fumes which are formed, to coat all brass work,\r\nscrews, etc., with paraffine wax.\r\n\r\nThe electrolyte or acid used in the cell, for working purposes, is a\r\npure sulphuric acid, which should be diluted with about four times its\r\nweight in water. Remember, you should always add the strong acid to the\r\nwater, and never pour the water into the acid, as the latter method\r\ncauses a dangerous ebullition, and does not produce a good mixture.\r\n\r\nPut enough of this solution into the cell to cover the tops of the\r\nplates, and the cell is ready.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 64._ CONNECTING UP STORAGE BATTERY IN SERIES]\r\n\r\nCHARGING THE CELLS.--The charge of the current must never be less than\r\n2.5 volts. Each cell has an output, in voltage, of about 2 volts, hence\r\nif we have, say, 10 cells, we must have at least 25 volts charging\r\ncapacity. We may arrange these in one line, or in series, as it is\r\ncalled, so far as the connections are concerned, and charge them with a\r\ndynamo, or other electrical source, which shows a pressure of 25 volts,\r\nas illustrated in Fig. 64, or, instead of this, we may put them into two\r\nparallel sets of 5 cells each, as shown in Fig. 65, and use 12.5 volts\r\nto charge with. In this case it will take double the time because we are\r\ncharging with only one-half the voltage used in the first case.\r\n\r\nThe positive pole of the dynamo should be connected with the positive\r\npole of the accumulator cell, and negative with negative. When this has\r\nbeen done run up the machine until it slightly exceeds the voltage of\r\nthe cells. Thus, if we have 50 cells in parallel, like in Fig. 64, at\r\nleast 125 volts will be required, and the excess necessary should bring\r\nup the voltage in the dynamo to 135 or 140 volts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 65._ PARALLEL SERIES]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 66._ CHARGING CIRCUIT]\r\n\r\nTHE INITIAL CHARGE.--It is usual initially to charge the battery from\r\nperiods ranging from 36 to 40 hours, and to let it stand for 12 or 15\r\nhours, after which to re-charge, until the positive plates have turned\r\nto a chocolate color, and the negative plates to a slate or gray color,\r\nand both plates give off large bubbles of gas.\r\n\r\nIn charging, the temperature of the electrolyte should not exceed 100\xc2\xb0\r\nFahrenheit.\r\n\r\nWhen using the accumulators they should never be fully discharged.\r\n\r\nTHE CHARGING CIRCUIT.--The diagram (Fig. 66) shows how a charging\r\ncircuit is formed. The lamps are connected up in parallel, as\r\nillustrated. Each 16-candle-power 105-volt lamp will carry 1/2 ampere,\r\nso that, supposing we have a dynamo which gives 110 volts, and we want\r\nto charge a 4-volt accumulator, there will be 5-volt surplus to go to\r\nthe accumulator. If, for instance, you want the cell to have a charge of\r\n2 amperes, four of these lamps should be connected up in parallel. If 3\r\namperes are required, use 6 lamps, and so on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE TELEGRAPH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe telegraph is a very simple instrument. The key is nothing more or\r\nless than a switch which turns the current on and off alternately.\r\n\r\nThe signals sent over the wires are simply the audible sounds made by\r\nthe armature, as it moves to and from the magnets.\r\n\r\nMECHANISM IN TELEGRAPH CIRCUITS.--A telegraph circuit requires three\r\npieces of mechanism at each station, namely, a key used by the sender, a\r\nsounder for the receiver, and a battery.\r\n\r\nTHE SENDING KEY.--The base of the sending instrument is six inches long,\r\nfour inches wide, and three-quarters of an inch thick, made of wood, or\r\nany suitable non-conducting material. The key (A) is a piece of brass\r\nthree-eighths by one-half inch in thickness and six inches long. Midway\r\nbetween its ends is a cross hole, to receive the pivot pin (B), which\r\nalso passes through a pair of metal brackets (C, D), the bracket C\r\nhaving a screw to hold one of the line wires, and the other bracket\r\nhaving a metal switch (E) hinged thereto. This switch bar, like the\r\nbrackets, is made of brass, one-half inch wide by one-sixteenth of an\r\ninch thick.\r\n\r\nBelow the forward end of the key (A) is a cross bar of brass (F),\r\nscrewed to the base by a screw at one end, to receive the other line\r\nwire. Directly below the key (A) is a screw (G), so that the key will\r\nstrike it when moved downwardly. The other end of the bar (F) contacts\r\nwith the forward end of the switch bar (E) when the latter is moved\r\ninwardly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 67._ TELEGRAPH SENDING KEY]\r\n\r\nThe forward end of the key (A) has a knob (H) for the fingers, and the\r\nrear end has an elastic (I) attached thereto which is secured to the end\r\nof the base, so that, normally, the rear end is held against the base\r\nand away from the screw head (G). The head (J) of a screw projects from\r\nthe base at its rear end. Key A contacts with it.\r\n\r\nWhen the key A contacts with the screw heads G, J, a click is produced,\r\none when the key is pressed down and the other when the key is released.\r\n\r\nYou will notice that the two plates C, F are connected up in circuit\r\nwith the battery, so that, as the switch E is thrown, so as to be out of\r\ncontact, the circuit is open, and may be closed either by the key A or\r\nthe switch E. The use of the switch will be illustrated in connection\r\nwith the sounder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 68._ TELEGRAPH SOUNDER]\r\n\r\nWhen the key A is depressed, the circuit of course goes through plate C,\r\nkey A and plate F to the station signalled.\r\n\r\nTHE SOUNDER.--The sounder is the instrument which carries the\r\nelectro-magnet.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 68 this is shown in perspective. The base is six inches long and\r\nfour inches wide, being made, preferably, of wood. Near the forward end\r\nis mounted a pair of electro-magnets (A, A), with their terminal wires\r\nconnected up with plates B, B\', to which the line wires are attached.\r\n\r\nMidway between the magnets and the rear end of the base is a pair of\r\nupwardly projecting brackets (C). Between these are pivoted a bar (D),\r\nthe forward end of which rests between the magnets and carries, thereon,\r\na cross bar (E) which is directly above the magnets, and serves as the\r\narmature.\r\n\r\nThe rear end of the base has a screw (F) directly beneath the bar D of\r\nsuch height that when the rear end of the bar D is in contact therewith\r\nthe armature E will be out of contact with the magnet cores (A, A). A\r\nspiral spring (G) secured to the rear ends of the arm and to the base,\r\nrespectively, serves to keep the rear end of the key normally in contact\r\nwith the screw F.\r\n\r\nCONNECTING UP THE KEY AND SOUNDER.--Having made these two instruments,\r\nwe must next connect them up in the circuit, or circuits, formed for\r\nthem, as there must be a battery, a key, and a sounder at each end of\r\nthe line.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 69 you will note two groups of those instruments. Now observe\r\nhow the wires connect them together. There are two line wires, one (A)\r\nwhich connects up the two batteries, the wire being attached so that\r\none end connects with the positive terminal of the battery, and the\r\nother end with the negative terminal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 69._ A TELEGRAPH CIRCUIT]\r\n\r\nThe other line wire (B), between the two stations, has its opposite ends\r\nconnected with the terminals of the electro-magnet C of the sounders.\r\nThe other terminals of each electro-magnet are connected up with one\r\nterminal of each key by a wire (D), and to complete the circuit at each\r\nstation, the other terminal of the key has a wire (E) to its own\r\nbattery.\r\n\r\nTWO STATIONS IN CIRCUIT.--The illustration shows station 2 telegraphing\r\nto station 1. This is indicated by the fact that the switch F\' of that\r\ninstrument is open, and the switch F of station 1 closed. When,\r\ntherefore, the key of station 2 is depressed, a complete circuit is\r\nformed which transmits the current through wire E\' and battery, through\r\nline A, then through the battery of station 1, through wire E to the\r\nkey, and from the key, through wire D, to the sounder, and finally from\r\nthe sounder over line wire B back to the sounder of station 2,\r\ncompleting the circuit at the key through wire D\'.\r\n\r\nWhen the operator at station 2 closes the switch F\', and the operator at\r\nstation 1 opens the switch F, the reverse operation takes place. In both\r\ncases, however, the sounder is in at both ends of the line, and only the\r\ncircuit through the key is cut out by the switch F, or F\'.\r\n\r\nTHE DOUBLE CLICK.--The importance of the double click of the sounder\r\nwill be understood when it is realized that the receiving operator must\r\nhave some means of determining if the sounder has transmitted a dot or a\r\ndash. Whether he depresses the key for a dot or a dash, there must be\r\none click when the key is pressed down on the screw head G (Fig. 62),\r\nand also another click, of a different kind, when the key is raised up\r\nso that its rear end strikes the screw head J. This action of the key is\r\ninstantly duplicated by the bar D (Fig. 68) of the sounder, so that the\r\nsounder as well as the receiver knows the time between the first and the\r\nsecond click, and by that means he learns that a dot or a dash is made.\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATING THE DOT AND THE DASH.--To illustrate: Let us suppose, for\r\nconvenience, that the downward movement of the lever in the key, and the\r\nbar in the sounder, make a sharp click, and the return of the lever and\r\nbar make a dull click. In this case the ear, after a little practice,\r\ncan learn readily how to distinguish the number of downward impulses\r\nthat have been given to the key.\r\n\r\n_The Morse Telegraph Code_\r\n\r\nA . -        N - .       & . ...\r\nB - ...

Now a dash by itself may be an L, a T, or\r\nthe figure 0, dependent upon its length. The short dash is T, and the\r\nlongest dash the figure 0. The operator will soon learn whether it is\r\neither of these or the letter L, which is intermediate in length.\r\n\r\nIn time the sender as well as receiver will give a uniform length to the\r\ndash impulse, so that it may be readily distinguished. In the same way,\r\nwe find that R, which is indicated by a dot, is followed, after a short\r\ninterval, by two dots. This might readily be mistaken for the single dot\r\nfor E and the two dots for I, were it not that the time element in R is\r\nnot as long between the first and second dots, as it ordinarily is\r\nbetween the single dot of E when followed by the two dots of I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nHIGH TENSION APPARATUS, CONDENSERS, ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\nINDUCTION.--One of the most remarkable things in electricity is the\r\naction of induction--that property of an electric current which enables\r\nit to pass from one conductor to another conductor through the air.\r\nAnother singular and interesting thing is that the current so\r\ntransmitted across spaces changes its direction of flow, and,\r\nfurthermore, the tension of such a current may be changed by\r\ntransmitting it from one conductor to another.\r\n\r\nLOW AND HIGH TENSION.--In order to effect this latter change--that is,\r\nto convert it from a low tension to a high tension--coils are used, one\r\ncoil being wound upon the other; one of these coils is called the\r\nprimary and the other the secondary. The primary coil receives the\r\ncurrent from the battery, or source of electrical power, and the\r\nsecondary coil receives charges, and transmits the current.\r\n\r\nFor an illustration of this examine Fig. 70, in which you will note a\r\ncoil of heavy wire (A), around which is wound a coil of fine wire (B).\r\nIf, for instance, the primary coil has a low voltage, the secondary\r\ncoil will have a high voltage, or tension. Advantage is taken of this\r\nphase to use a few cells, as a primary battery, and then, by a set of\r\n_Induction Coils_, as they are called, to build up a high-tension\r\nelectro-motive force, so that the spark will jump across a gap, as shown\r\nat C, for the purpose of igniting the charges of gas in a gasoline\r\nmotor; or the current may be used for medical batteries, and for other\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 70._ INDUCTION COIL AND CIRCUIT]\r\n\r\nThe current passes, by induction, from the primary to the secondary\r\ncoil. It passes from a large conductor to a small conductor, the small\r\nconductor having a much greater resistance than the large one.\r\n\r\nELASTIC PROPERTY OF ELECTRICITY.--While electricity has no resiliency,\r\nlike a spring, for instance, still it acts in the manner of a cushion\r\nunder certain conditions. It may be likened to an oscillating spring\r\nacted upon by a bar.\r\n\r\nReferring to Fig. 71, we will assume that the bar A in falling down upon\r\nthe spring B compresses the latter, so that at the time of greatest\r\ncompression the bar goes down as far as the dotted line C. It is obvious\r\nthat the spring B will throw the bar upwardly. Now, electricity appears\r\nto have a kind of elasticity, which characteristic is taken advantage of\r\nin order to increase the efficiency of the induction in the coil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 71._ ILLUSTRATING ELASTICITY]\r\n\r\nTHE CONDENSER.--To make a condenser, prepare two pine boards like A,\r\nsay, eight by ten inches and a half inch thick, and shellac thoroughly\r\non all sides. Then prepare sheets of tinfoil (B), six by eight inches in\r\nsize, and also sheets of paraffined paper (C), seven by nine inches in\r\ndimensions. Also cut out from the waste pieces of tinfoil strips (D),\r\none inch by two inches. To build up the condenser, lay down a sheet of\r\nparaffined paper (C), then a sheet of tinfoil (B), and before putting\r\non the next sheet of paraffined paper lay down one of the small strips\r\n(D) of tinfoil, as shown in the illustration, so that its end projects\r\nover one end of the board A; then on the second sheet of paraffine paper\r\nlay another sheet of tinfoil, and on this, at the opposite end, place\r\none of the small strips (D), and so on, using from 50 to 100 of the\r\ntinfoil sheets. When the last paraffine sheet is laid on, the other\r\nboard is placed on top, and the whole bound together, either by wrapping\r\ncords around the same or by clamping them together with bolts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 72._ CONDENSER]\r\n\r\nYou may now make a hole through the projecting ends of the strips, and\r\nyou will have two sets of tinfoil sheets, alternately connected together\r\nat opposite ends of the condenser.\r\n\r\nCare should be exercised to leave the paraffine sheets perfect or\r\nwithout holes. You can make these sheets yourself by soaking them in\r\nmelted paraffine wax.\r\n\r\nCONNECTING UP A CONDENSER.--When completed, one end of the condenser is\r\nconnected up with one terminal of the secondary coil, and the other end\r\nof the condenser with the other secondary terminal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 73._ HIGH-TENSION CIRCUIT]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 73 a high-tension circuit is shown. Two coils, side by side, are\r\nalways used to show an induction coil, and a condenser is generally\r\nshown, as illustrated, by means of a pair of forks, one resting within\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nTHE INTERRUPTER.--One other piece of mechanism is necessary, and that is\r\nan _Interrupter_, for the purpose of getting the effect of the\r\npulsations given out by the secondary coil.\r\n\r\nA simple current interrupter is made as follows: Prepare a wooden base\r\n(A), one inch thick, six inches wide, and twelve inches long. Upon this\r\nmount a toothed wheel (B), six inches in diameter, of thin sheet metal,\r\nor a brass gear wheel will answer the purpose. The standard (C), which\r\nsupports the wheel, may be of metal bent up to form two posts, between\r\nwhich the crankshaft (D) is journaled. The base of the posts has an\r\nextension plate (E), with a binding post for a wire. At the front end of\r\nthe base is an L-shaped strip (F), with a binding post for a wire\r\nconnection, and the upwardly projecting part of the strip contacts with\r\nthe toothed wheel. When the wheel B is rotated the spring finger (F)\r\nsnaps from one tooth to the next, so that, momentarily, the current is\r\nbroken, and the frequency is dependent upon the speed imparted to the\r\nwheel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 74._ CURRENT INTERRUPTER]\r\n\r\nUSES OF HIGH-TENSION COILS.--This high-tension coil is made use of, and\r\nis the essential apparatus in wireless telegraphy, as we shall see in\r\nthe chapter treating upon that subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nWIRELESS TELEGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nTELEGRAPHING WITHOUT WIRES.--Wireless telegraphy is an outgrowth of the\r\nordinary telegraph system. When Maxwell, and, later on, Hertz,\r\ndiscovered that electricity, magnetism, and light were transmitted\r\nthrough the ether, and that they differed only in their wave lengths,\r\nthey laid the foundations for wireless telegraphy. Ether is a substance\r\nwhich is millions and millions of times lighter than air, and it\r\npervades all space. It is so unstable that it is constantly in motion,\r\nand this phase led some one to suggest that if a proper electrical\r\napparatus could be made, the ether would thereby be disturbed\r\nsufficiently so that its impulses would extend out a distance\r\nproportioned to the intensity of the electrical agitation thereby\r\ncreated.\r\n\r\nSURGING CHARACTER OF HIGH-TENSION CURRENTS.--When a current of\r\nelectricity is sent through a wire, hundreds of miles in length, the\r\ncurrent surges back and forth on the wire many thousands of times a\r\nsecond. Light comes to us from the sun, over 90,000,000 of miles,\r\nthrough the ether. It is as reasonable to suppose, or infer, that the\r\nether can, therefore, convey an electrical impulse as readily as does a\r\nwire.\r\n\r\nIt is on this principle that impulses are sent for thousands of miles,\r\nand no doubt they extend even farther, if the proper mechanism could be\r\ndevised to detect movement of the waves so propagated.\r\n\r\nTHE COHERER.--The instrument for detecting these impulses, or\r\ndisturbances, in the ether is generally called a _coherer_, although\r\ndetector is the term which is most satisfactory. The name coherer comes\r\nfrom the first practical instrument made for this purpose.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 75._ WIRELESS TELEGRAPHY COHERER]\r\n\r\nHOW MADE.--The coherer is simply a tube, say, of glass, within which is\r\nplaced iron filings. When the oscillations surge through the secondary\r\ncoil the pressure or potentiality of the current finally causes it to\r\nleap across the small space separating the filings and, as it were, it\r\nwelds together their edges so that a current freely passes. The\r\nbringing together of the particles, under these conditions, is called\r\ncohering.\r\n\r\nFig. 75 shows the simplest form of coherer. The posts (A) are firmly\r\naffixed to the base (B), each post having an adjusting screw (C) in its\r\nupper end, and these screw downwardly against and serve to bind a pair\r\nof horizontal rods (D), the inner ends of which closely approach each\r\nother. These may be adjusted so as to be as near together or as far\r\napart as desired. E is a glass tube in which the ends of the rods (D)\r\nrest, and between the separated ends of the rods (D) the iron filings\r\n(F) are placed.\r\n\r\nTHE DECOHERERS.--For the purpose of causing the metal filings to fall\r\napart, or decohere, the tube is tapped lightly, and this is done by a\r\nlittle object like the clapper of an electric bell.\r\n\r\nIn practice, the coils and the parts directly connected with it are put\r\ntogether on one base.\r\n\r\nTHE SENDING APPARATUS.--Fig. 76 shows a section of a coil with its\r\nconnection in the sending station. The spark gap rods (A) may be swung\r\nso as to bring them closer together or farther apart, but they must not\r\nat any time contact with each other.\r\n\r\nThe induction coil has one terminal of the primary coil connected up by\r\na wire (B) with one post of a telegraph key, and the other post of the\r\nkey has a wire connection (C), with one side of a storage battery. The\r\nother side of the battery has a wire (D) running to the other terminal\r\nof the primary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 76._ WIRELESS SENDING APPARATUS]\r\n\r\nThe secondary coil has one of its terminals connected with a binding\r\npost (E). This binding post has an adjustable rod with a knob (F) on its\r\nend, and the other binding post (G), which is connected up with the\r\nother terminal of the secondary coil, carries a similar adjusting rod\r\nwith a knob (H).\r\n\r\nFrom the post (E) is a wire (I), which extends upwardly, and is called\r\nthe aerial wire, or wire for the antenn\xc3\xa6, and this wire also connects\r\nwith one side of the condenser by a conductor (J). The ground wire (K)\r\nconnects with the other binding post (G), and a branch wire (L) also\r\nconnects the ground wire (K) with one end of the condenser.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 77._ WIRELESS RECEIVING APPARATUS]\r\n\r\nTHE RECEIVING APPARATUS.--The receiving station, on the other hand, has\r\nneither condenser, induction coil, nor key. When the apparatus is in\r\noperation, the coherer switch is closed, and the instant a current\r\npasses through the coherer and operates the telegraph sounder, the\r\ngalvanometer indicates the current.\r\n\r\nOf course, when the coherer switch is closed, the battery operates the\r\ndecoherer.\r\n\r\nHOW THE CIRCUITS ARE FORMED.--By referring again to Fig. 76, it will be\r\nseen that when the key is depressed, a circuit is formed from the\r\nbattery through wire B to the primary coil, and back again to the\r\nbattery through wire D. The secondary coil is thereby energized, and,\r\nwhen the full potential is reached, the current leaps across the gap\r\nformed between the two knobs (F, H), thereby setting up a disturbance in\r\nthe ether which is transmitted through space in all directions.\r\n\r\nIt is this impulse, or disturbance, which is received by the coherer at\r\nthe receiving station, and which is indicated by the telegraph sounder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE TELEPHONE\r\n\r\n\r\nVIBRATIONS.--Every manifestation in nature is by way of vibration. The\r\nbeating of the heart, the action of the legs in walking, the winking of\r\nthe eyelid; the impulses from the sun, which we call light; sound, taste\r\nand color appeal to our senses by vibratory means, and, as we have\r\nhereinbefore stated, the manifestations of electricity and magnetism are\r\nmerely vibrations of different wave lengths.\r\n\r\nTHE ACOUSTIC TELEPHONE.--That sound is merely a product of vibrations\r\nmay be proven in many ways. One of the earliest forms of telephones was\r\nsimply a "sound" telephone, called the _Acoustic Telephone_. The\r\nprinciple of this may be illustrated as follows:\r\n\r\nTake two cups (A, B), as in Fig. 78, punch a small hole through the\r\nbottom of each, and run a string or wire (C) from the hole of one cup to\r\nthat of the other, and secure it at both ends so it may be drawn taut.\r\nNow, by talking into the cup (A) the bottom of it will vibrate to and\r\nfro, as shown by the dotted lines and thereby cause the bottom of the\r\nother cup (B) to vibrate in like manner, and in so vibrating it will\r\nreceive not only the same amplitude, but also the same character of\r\nvibrations as the cup (A) gave forth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 78._ ACOUSTIC TELEPHONE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 79._ ILLUSTRATING VIBRATIONS]\r\n\r\nSOUND WAVES.--Sound waves are long and short; the long waves giving\r\nsounds which are low in the musical scale, and the short waves high\r\nmusical tones. You may easily determine this by the following\r\nexperiment:\r\n\r\nStretch a wire, as at B (Fig. 79), fairly tight, and then vibrate it.\r\nThe amplitude of the vibration will be as indicated by dotted line A.\r\nNow, stretch it very tight, as at C, so that the amplitude of vibration\r\nwill be as shown at E. By putting your ear close to the string you will\r\nfind that while A has a low pitch, C is very much higher. This is the\r\nprinciple on which stringed instruments are built. You will note that\r\nthe wave length, which represents the distance between the dotted lines\r\nA is much greater than E.\r\n\r\nHEARING ELECTRICITY.--In electricity, mechanism has been made to enable\r\nman to note the action of the current. By means of the armature,\r\nvibrating in front of a magnet, we can see its manifestations. It is now\r\nbut a step to devise some means whereby we may hear it. In this, as in\r\neverything else electrically, the magnet comes into play.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 80._ THE MAGNETIC FIELD]\r\n\r\nIn the chapter on magnetism, it was stated that the magnetic field\r\nextended out beyond the magnet, so that if we were able to see the\r\nmagnetism, the end of a magnet would appear to us something like a\r\nmoving field, represented by the dotted lines in Fig. 80.\r\n\r\nThe magnetic field is shown in Fig. 80 at only one end, but its\r\nmanifestations are alike at both ends. It will be seen that the magnetic\r\nfield extends out to a considerable distance and has quite a radius of\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nTHE DIAPHRAGM IN A MAGNETIC FIELD.--If, now, we put a diaphragm (A) in\r\nthis magnetic field, close up to the end of the magnet, but not so close\r\nas to touch it, and then push it in and out, or talk into it so that the\r\nsound waves strike it, the movement or the vibration of the diaphragm\r\n(A) will disturb the magnetic field emanating from the magnet, and this\r\ndisturbance of the magnetic field at one end of the magnet also affects\r\nthe magnetic field at the other end in the same way, so that the\r\ndisturbance there will be of the same amplitude. It will also display\r\nthe same characteristics as did the magnetic field when the diaphragm\r\n(A) disturbed it.\r\n\r\nA SIMPLE TELEPHONE CIRCUIT.--From this simple fact grew the telephone.\r\nIf two magnets are connected up in the same circuit, so that the\r\nmagnetic fields of the two magnets have the same source of electric\r\npower, the disturbance of one diaphragm will affect the other similarly,\r\njust the same as the two magnetic fields of the single magnet are\r\ndisturbed in unison.\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE A TELEPHONE.--For experimental and testing purposes two of\r\nthese telephones should be made at the same time. The case or holder\r\n(A) may be made either of hard wood or hard rubber, so that it is of\r\ninsulating material. The core (B) is of soft iron, 3/8 inch in diameter\r\nand 5 inches long, bored and threaded at one end to receive a screw (C)\r\nwhich passes through the end of the case (A).\r\n\r\nThe enlarged end of the case should be, exteriorly, 2-1/4 inches in\r\ndiameter, and the body of the case 1 inch in diameter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 81._ SECTION OF TELEPHONE RECEIVER]\r\n\r\nInteriorly, the large end of the case is provided with a circular recess\r\n1-3/4 inches in diameter and adapted to receive therein a spool which\r\nis, diametrically, a little smaller than the recess. The spool fits\r\nfairly tight upon the end of the core, and when in position rests\r\nagainst an annular shoulder in the recess. A hollow space (F) is thus\r\nprovided behind the spool (D), so the two wires from the magnet may\r\nhave room where they emerge from the spool.\r\n\r\nThe spool is a little shorter than the distance between the shoulder (E)\r\nand the end of the casing, at G, and the core projects only a short\r\ndistance beyond the end of the spool, so that when the diaphragm (H) is\r\nput upon the end of the case, and held there by screws (I) it will not\r\ntouch the end of the core. A wooden or rubber mouthpiece (J) is then\r\nturned up to fit over the end of the case.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 82._ THE MAGNET AND RECEIVER HEAD]\r\n\r\nThe spool (D) is made of hard rubber, and is wound with No. 24\r\nsilk-covered wire, the windings to be well insulated from each other.\r\nThe two ends of the wire are brought out, and threaded through holes (K)\r\ndrilled longitudinally through the walls of the case, and affixed to the\r\nend by means of screws (L), so that the two wires may be brought\r\ntogether and connected with a duplex wire (M).\r\n\r\nAs the screw (C), which holds the core in place, has its head hidden\r\nwithin a recess, which can be closed up by wax, the two terminals of the\r\nwires are well separated so that short-circuiting cannot take place.\r\n\r\nTELEPHONE CONNECTIONS.--The simplest form of telephone connection is\r\nshown in Fig. 83. This has merely the two telephones (A and B), with a\r\nsingle battery (C) to supply electricity for both. One line wire (D)\r\nconnects the two telephones directly, while the other line (E) has the\r\nbattery in its circuit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 83._ SIMPLE TELEPHONE CONNECTION]\r\n\r\nCOMPLETE INSTALLATION.--To install a more complete system requires, at\r\neach end, a switch, a battery and an electro-magneto bell. You may use,\r\nfor this purpose, a bell, made as shown in the chapter on bells.\r\n\r\nFig. 84 shows such a circuit. We now dispense with one of the line\r\nwires, because it has been found that the ground between the two\r\nstations serves as a conductor, so that only one line wire (A) is\r\nnecessary to connect directly with the telephones of the two stations.\r\nThe telephones (B, B\', respectively) have wires (C, C\') running to the\r\npivots of double-throw switches (D, D\'), one terminal of the switches\r\nhaving wires (E, E\'), which go to electric bells (F, F\'), and from the\r\nbells are other wires (G, G\'), which go to the ground. The ground wires\r\nalso have wires (H, H\'), which go to the other terminals of the switch\r\n(D, D\'). The double-throw switch (D, D\'), in the two stations, is thrown\r\nover so the current, if any should pass through, will go through the\r\nbell to the ground, through the wires (E, G or E\', G\').\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 84._ TELEPHONE STATIONS IN CIRCUIT]\r\n\r\nNow, supposing the switch (D\'), in station 2, should be thrown over so\r\nit contacts with the wire (H\'). It is obvious that the current will then\r\nflow from the battery (I\') through wires (H\', C\') and line (A) to\r\nstation 1; then through wire C, switch D, wire E to the bell F, to the\r\nground through wire G. From wire G the current returns through the\r\nground to station 2, where it flows up wire G\' to the battery, thereby\r\ncompleting the circuit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 85._ ILLUSTRATING LIGHT CONTACT POINTS]\r\n\r\nThe operator at station 2, having given the signal, again throws his\r\nswitch (D\') back to the position shown in Fig. 84, and the operator at\r\nstation 1 throws on his switch (D), so as to ring the bell in station 2,\r\nthereby answering the signal, which means that both switches are again\r\nto be thrown over so they contact with the battery wires (H and H\'),\r\nrespectively. When both are thus thrown over, the bells (G, G\') are cut\r\nout of the circuit, and the batteries are both thrown in, so that the\r\ntelephones are now ready for talking purposes.\r\n\r\nMICROPHONE.--Originally this form of telephone system was generally\r\nemployed, but it was found that for long distances a more sensitive\r\ninstrument was necessary.\r\n\r\nLIGHT CONTACT POINTS.--In 1877 Professor Hughes discovered,\r\naccidentally, that a light contact point in an electric circuit\r\naugmented the sound in a telephone circuit. If, for instance, a light\r\npin, or a nail (A, Fig. 85) should be used to connect the severed ends\r\nof a wire (B), the sounds in the telephone not only would be louder, but\r\nthey would be more distinct, and the first instrument made practically,\r\nto demonstrate this, is shown in Fig. 86.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 86._ MICROPHONE]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 87._ TRANSMITTER]\r\n\r\nHOW TO MAKE A MICROPHONE.--This instrument has simply a base (A) of\r\nwood, and near one end is a perpendicular sounding-board (B) of wood, to\r\none side of which is attached, by wax or otherwise, a pair of carbon\r\nblocks (C, D). The lower carbon block (C) has a cup-shaped depression in\r\nits upper side, and the upper block has a similar depression in its\r\nlower side. A carbon pencil (E) is lightly held within these cups, so\r\nthat the lightest contact of the upper end of the pencil with the\r\ncarbon block, makes the instrument so sensitive that a fly, walking upon\r\nthe sounding-board, may be distinctly heard through the telephone which\r\nis in the circuit.\r\n\r\nMICROPHONE THE FATHER OF THE TRANSMITTER.--This instrument has been\r\ngreatly modified, and is now used as a transmitter, the latter thereby\r\ntaking the place of the pin (A), shown in Fig. 85.\r\n\r\nAUTOMATIC CUT-OUTS FOR TELEPHONES.--In the operation of the telephone,\r\nthe great drawback originally was in inducing users of the lines to\r\nreplace or adjust their instruments carefully. When switches were used,\r\nthey would forget to throw them back, and all sorts of trouble resulted.\r\n\r\nIt was found necessary to provide an automatic means for throwing in and\r\ncutting out an instrument, this being done by hanging the telephone on\r\nthe hook, so that the act merely of leaving the telephone made it\r\nnecessary, in replacing the instrument, to cut out the apparatus.\r\n\r\nBefore describing the circuiting required for these improvements, we\r\nshow, in Fig. 87, a section of a transmitter.\r\n\r\nA cup-shaped case (A) is provided, made of some insulating material,\r\nwhich has a diaphragm (B) secured at its open side. This diaphragm\r\ncarries the carbon pencil (C) on one side and from the blocks which\r\nsupport the carbon pencil the wires run to binding posts on the case.\r\nOf course the carbon supporting posts must be insulated from each other,\r\nso the current will go through the carbon pencil (C).\r\n\r\nCOMPLETE CIRCUITING WITH TRANSMITTER.--In showing the circuiting (Fig.\r\n88) it will not be possible to illustrate the boxes, or casings, which\r\nreceive the various instruments. For instance, the hook which carries\r\nthe telephone or the receiver, is hinged within the transmitter box. The\r\ncircuiting is all that it is intended to show.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 88._ COMPLETE TELEPHONIC CIRCUIT]\r\n\r\nThe batteries of the two stations are connected up by a wire (A), unless\r\na ground circuit is used. The other side of each battery has a wire\r\nconnection (B, B\') with one terminal of the transmitter, and the other\r\nterminal of the transmitter has a wire (C, C\') which goes to the\r\nreceiver. From the other terminal of the receiver is a wire (D, D\')\r\nwhich leads to the upper stop contact (E, E\') of the telephone hook. A\r\nwire (F, F\') from the lower stop contact (G, G\') of the hook goes to one\r\nterminal of the bell, and from the other terminal of the bell is a wire\r\n(H, H\') which makes connection with the line wire (A). In order to make\r\na complete circuit between the two stations, a line wire (I) is run from\r\nthe pivot of the hook in station 1 to the pivot of the hook in station\r\n2.\r\n\r\nIn the diagram, it is assumed that the receivers are on the hooks, and\r\nthat both hooks are, therefore, in circuit with the lower contacts (G,\r\nG\'), so that the transmitter and receiver are both out of circuit with\r\nthe batteries, and the bell in circuit; but the moment the receiver, for\r\ninstance, in station 1 is taken off the hook, the latter springs up so\r\nthat it contacts with the stop (E), thus establishing a circuit through\r\nthe line wire (I) to the hook of station 2, and from the hook through\r\nline (F\') to the bell. From the bell, the line (A) carries the current\r\nback to the battery of station (A), thence through the wire (B) to the\r\ntransmitter wire (C) to receiver and wire (D) to the post (E), thereby\r\ncompleting the circuit.\r\n\r\nWhen, at station 2, the receiver is taken off the hook, and the latter\r\ncontacts with the post (E\'), the transmitter and receiver of both\r\nstations are in circuit with each other, but both bells are cut out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nELECTROLYSIS, WATER PURIFICATION, ELECTROPLATING\r\n\r\n\r\nDECOMPOSING LIQUIDS.--During the earlier experiments in the field of\r\nelectricity, after the battery or cell was discovered, it was noted that\r\nwhen a current was formed in the cell, the electrolyte was charged and\r\ngases evolved from it. A similar action takes place when a current of\r\nelectricity passes through a liquid, with the result that the liquid is\r\ndecomposed--that is, the liquid is broken up into its original\r\ncompounds. Thus, water is composed of two parts, by bulk, of hydrogen\r\nand of oxygen, so that if two electrodes are placed in water, and a\r\ncurrent is sent through the electrodes in either direction, all the\r\nwater will finally disappear in the form of hydrogen and oxygen gases.\r\n\r\nMAKING HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN.--During this electrical action, the hydrogen\r\nis set free at the negative pole and the oxygen at the positive pole. A\r\nsimple apparatus, which any boy can make, to generate pure oxygen and\r\npure hydrogen, is shown in Fig. 89.\r\n\r\nIt is constructed of a glass or earthen jar (A), preferably square, to\r\nwhich is fitted a wooden top (B), this top being provided with a\r\npacking ring (C), so as to make it air-tight. Within is a vertical\r\npartition (D), the edges of which, below the cap, fit tightly against\r\nthe inner walls of the jar. This partition extends down into the jar a\r\nsufficient distance so it will terminate below the water level. A pipe\r\nis fitted through the top on each side of the partition, and each pipe\r\nhas a valve. An electrode, of any convenient metal, is secured at its\r\nupper end to the top of the cap, on each side of the partition. These\r\nelectrodes extend down to the bottom of the jar, and an electric wire\r\nconnects with each of them at the top.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 89._ DEVICE FOR MAKING HYDROGEN AND OXYGEN]\r\n\r\nIf a current of electricity is passed through the wires and the\r\nelectrodes, in the direction shown by the darts, hydrogen will form at\r\nthe negative pole, and oxygen at the positive pole. These gases will\r\nescape upwardly, so that they will be trapped in their respective\r\ncompartments, and may be drawn off by means of the pipes.\r\n\r\nPURIFYING WATER.--Advantage is taken of this electrolytic action, to\r\npurify water. Oxygen is the most wonderful chemical in nature. It is\r\ncalled the acid-maker of the universe. The name is derived from two\r\nwords, _oxy_ and _gen_; one denoting oxydation, and the other that it\r\ngenerates. In other words, it is the _generator of oxides_. It is the\r\nelement which, when united with any other element, produces an acid, an\r\nalkali or a neutral compound.\r\n\r\nRUST.--For instance, iron is largely composed of ferric acid. When\r\noxygen, in a free or gaseous state, comes into contact with iron, it\r\nproduces ferrous oxide, which is recognized as rust.\r\n\r\nOXYGEN AS A PURIFIER.--But oxygen is also a purifier. All low forms of\r\nanimal life, like bacteria or germs in water, succumb to free oxygen. By\r\n_free oxygen_ is meant oxygen in the form of gas.\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITION OF WATER.--Now, water, in which harmful germs live, is\r\none-third oxygen. Nevertheless, the germs thrive in water, because the\r\noxygen is in a compound state, and, therefore, not an active agent. But\r\nif oxygen, in the form of gas, can be forced through water, it will\r\nattack the germs, and destroy them.\r\n\r\nCOMMON AIR NOT A GOOD PURIFIER.--Water may be purified, to a certain\r\nextent, by forcing common air through it, and the foulest water, if run\r\nover rocks, will be purified, in a measure, because air is intermingled\r\nwith it. But common air is composed of four-fifths nitrogen, and only\r\none-fifth oxygen, and, as nitrogen is the staple article of food for\r\nbacteria, the purifying method by air is not effectual.\r\n\r\nPURE OXYGEN.--When, however, oxygen is generated from water, by means of\r\nelectrolysis, it is pure; hence is more active and is not tainted by a\r\nlife-giving substance for germs, such as nitrogen.\r\n\r\nThe mechanism usually employed for purifying water is shown in Fig. 90.\r\n\r\nA WATER PURIFIER.--The case (A, Fig. 90) may be made of metal or of an\r\ninsulating material. If made of metal it must be insulated within with\r\nslate, glass, marble or hard rubber, as shown at B. The case is provided\r\nwith exterior flanges (C, D), with upper and lower ends, and it is\r\nmounted upon a base plate (E) and affixed thereto by bolts. The upper\r\nend has a conically-formed cap (F) bolted to the flanges (C), and this\r\nhas an outlet to which a pipe (G) is attached. The water inlet pipe (H)\r\npasses through the lower end of the case (A). The electrodes (I, J) are\r\nsecured, vertically, within the case, separated from each other\r\nequidistant, each alternate electrode being connected up with one wire\r\n(K), and the alternate electrodes with a wire (L).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 90._ ELECTRIC WATER PURIFIER]\r\n\r\nWhen the water passes upwardly, the decomposed or gaseous oxygen\r\npercolates through the water and thus attacks the germs and destroys\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nTHE USE OF HYDROGEN IN PURIFICATION.--On the other hand, the hydrogen\r\nalso plays an important part in purifying the water. This depends upon\r\nthe material of which the electrodes are made. Aluminum is by far the\r\nbest material, as it is one of nature\'s most active purifiers. All clay\r\ncontains aluminum, in what is known as the sulphate form, and water\r\npassing through the clay of the earth thereby becomes purified, because\r\nof this element.\r\n\r\nALUMINUM ELECTRODES.--When this material is used as the electrodes in\r\nwater, hydrate of aluminum is formed, or a compound of hydrogen and\r\noxygen with aluminum. The product of decomposition is a flocculent\r\nmatter which moves upwardly through the water, giving it a milky\r\nappearance. This substance is like gelatine, so that it entangles or\r\nenmeshes the germ life and prevents it from passing through a filter.\r\n\r\nIf no filter is used, this flocculent matter, as soon as it has given\r\noff the gases, will settle to the bottom and carry with it all\r\ndecomposed matter, such as germs and other organic matter attacked by\r\nthe oxygen, which has become entangled in the aluminum hydrate.\r\n\r\nELECTRIC HAND PURIFIER.--An interesting and serviceable little purifier\r\nmay be made by any boy with the simplest tools, by cutting out three\r\npieces of sheet aluminum. Hard rolled is best for the purpose. It is\r\nbetter to have one of the sheets (A), the middle one, thicker than the\r\ntwo outer plates (B).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 91._ PORTABLE ELECTRIC PURIFIER]\r\n\r\nLet each sheet be 1-1/2 inches wide and 5-1/2 inches thick. One-half\r\ninch from the upper ends of the two outside plates (B, B) bore bolt\r\nholes (C), each of these holes being a quarter of an inch from the edge\r\nof the plate. The inside plate (A) has two large holes (D) corresponding\r\nwith the small holes (C) in the outside plates. At the upper end of this\r\nplate form a wing (E), 1/2 inch wide and 1/2 inch long, provided with a\r\nsmall hole for a bolt. Next cut out two hard-rubber blocks (F), each\r\n1-1/2 inches long, 1 inch wide and 3/8 inch thick, and then bore a hole\r\n(G) through each, corresponding with the small holes (C) in the plates\r\n(B). The machine is now ready to be assembled. If the inner plate is 1/8\r\ninch thick and the outer plates each 1/16 inch thick, use two small\r\neighth-inch bolts 1-1/4 inches long, and clamp together the three\r\nplates with these bolts. One of the bolts may be used to attach thereto\r\none of the electric wires (H), and the other wire (I) is attached by a\r\nbolt to the wing (E).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figs. 92-95._ DETAILS OF PORTABLE PURIFIER]\r\n\r\nSuch a device will answer for a 110-volt circuit, in ordinary water. Now\r\nfill a glass nearly full of water, and stand the purifier in the glass.\r\nWithin a few minutes the action of electrolysis will be apparent by the\r\nformation of numerous bubbles on the plates, followed by the\r\ndecomposition of the organic matter in the water. At first the\r\nflocculent decomposed matter will rise to the surface of the water, but\r\nbefore many minutes it will settle to the bottom of the glass and leave\r\nclear water above.\r\n\r\nPURIFICATION AND SEPARATION OF METALS.--This electrolytic action is\r\nutilized in metallurgy for the purpose of producing pure metals, but it\r\nis more largely used to separate copper from its base. In order to\r\nutilize a current for this purpose, a high ampere flow and low voltage\r\nare required. The sheets of copper, containing all of its impurities,\r\nare placed within a tank, parallel with a thin copper sheet. The impure\r\nsheet is connected with the positive pole of an electroplating dynamo,\r\nand the thin sheet of copper is connected with the negative pole. The\r\nelectrolyte in the tank is a solution of sulphate of copper. The action\r\nof the current will cause the pure copper in the impure sheet to\r\ndisintegrate and it is then carried over and deposited upon the thin\r\nsheet, this action continuing until the impure sheet is entirely eaten\r\naway. All the impurities which were in the sheet fall to the bottom of\r\nthe tank.\r\n\r\nOther metals are treated in the same way, and this treatment has a very\r\nwide range of usefulness.\r\n\r\nELECTROPLATING.--The next feature to be considered in electrolysis is a\r\nmost interesting and useful one, because a cheap or inferior metal may\r\nbe coated by a more expensive metal. Silver and nickel plating are\r\nbrought about by this action of a current passing through metals, which\r\nare immersed in an electrolyte.\r\n\r\nPLATING IRON WITH COPPER.--We have room in this chapter for only one\r\nconcrete example of this work, which, with suitable modifications, is an\r\nexample of the art as practiced commercially. Iron, to a considerable\r\nextent, is now being coated with copper to preserve it from rust. To\r\ncarry out this work, however, an electroplating dynamo, of large\r\namperage, is required, the amperage, of course, depending upon the\r\nsurface to be treated at one time. The pressure should not exceed 5\r\nvolts.\r\n\r\nThe iron surface to be treated should first be thoroughly cleansed, and\r\nthen immediately put into a tank containing a cyanide of copper\r\nsolution. Two forms of copper solution are used, namely, the cyanide,\r\nwhich is a salt solution of copper, and the sulphate, which is an acid\r\nsolution of copper. Cyanide is first used because it does not attack the\r\niron, as would be the case if the sulphate solution should first come\r\ninto contact with the iron.\r\n\r\nA sheet of copper, termed the anode, is then placed within the tank,\r\nparallel with the surface to be plated, known as the cathode, and so\r\nmounted that it may be adjusted to or from the iron surface, or cathode.\r\nA direct current of electricity is then caused to flow through the\r\ncopper plate and into the iron plate or surface, and the plating\r\nproceeded with until the iron surface has a thin film of copper\r\ndeposited thereon. This is a slow process with the cyanide solution, so\r\nit is discontinued as soon as possible, after the iron surface has been\r\ncompletely covered with copper. This copper surface is thoroughly\r\ncleaned off to remove therefrom the saline or alkaline solution, and it\r\nis then immersed within a bath, containing a solution of sulphate of\r\ncopper. The current is then thrown on and allowed so to remain until it\r\nhas deposited the proper thickness of copper.\r\n\r\nDIRECTION OF CURRENT.--If a copper and an iron plate are put into a\r\ncopper solution and connected up in circuit with each other, a primary\r\nbattery is thereby formed, which will generate electricity. In this\r\ncase, the iron will be positive and the copper negative, so that the\r\ncurrent within such a cell would flow from the iron (in this instance,\r\nthe anode) to the negative, or cathode.\r\n\r\nThe action of electroplating reverses this process and causes the\r\ncurrent to flow from the copper to the iron (in this instance, the\r\ncathode).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nELECTRIC HEATING, THERMO ELECTRICITY\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERATING HEAT IN A WIRE.--When a current of electricity passes through\r\na conductor, like a wire, more or less heat is developed in the\r\nconductor. This heat may be so small that it cannot be measured, but it\r\nis, nevertheless, present in a greater or less degree. Conductors offer\r\na resistance to the passage of a current, just the same as water finds a\r\nresistance in pipes through which it passes. This resistance is measured\r\nin ohms, as explained in a preceding chapter, and it is this resistance\r\nwhich is utilized for electric heating.\r\n\r\nRESISTANCE OF SUBSTANCES.--Silver offers less resistance to the passage\r\nof a current than any other metal, the next in order is copper, while\r\niron is, comparatively, a poor conductor.\r\n\r\nThe following is a partial list of metals, showing their relative\r\nconductivity:\r\n\r\nSilver              1.\r\nCopper              1.04 to 1.09\r\nGold                1.38 to 1.41\r\nAluminum            1.64\r\nZinc                3.79\r\nNickel              4.69\r\nIron                6.56\r\nTin                 8.9\r\nLead               13.2\r\nGerman Silver      12.2 to 15\r\n\r\nFrom this table it will be seen that, for instance, iron offers six and\r\na half times the resistance of silver, and that German silver has\r\nfifteen times the resistance of silver.\r\n\r\nThis table is made up of strands of the different metals of the same\r\ndiameters and lengths, so as to obtain their relative values.\r\n\r\nSIZES OF CONDUCTORS.--Another thing, however, must be understood. If two\r\nconductors of the same metal, having different diameters, receive the\r\nsame current of electricity, the small conductor will offer a greater\r\nresistance than the large conductor, hence will generate more heat. This\r\ncan be offset by increasing the diameter of the conductor. The metal\r\nused is, therefore, of importance, on account of the cost involved.\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON OF METALS.--A conductor of aluminum, say, 10 feet long and of\r\nthe same weight as copper, has a diameter two and a quarter times\r\ngreater than copper; but as the resistance of aluminum is 50 per cent.\r\nmore than that of silver, it will be seen that, weight for weight,\r\ncopper is the cheaper, particularly as aluminum costs fully three times\r\nas much as copper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 96._ SIMPLE ELECTRIC HEATER]\r\n\r\nThe table shows that German silver has the highest resistance. Of\r\ncourse, there are other metals, like antimony, platinum and the like,\r\nwhich have still higher resistance. German silver, however, is most\r\ncommonly used, although there are various alloys of metal made which\r\nhave high resistance and are cheaper.\r\n\r\nThe principle of all electric heaters is the same, namely, the\r\nresistance of a conductor to the passage of a current, and an\r\nillustration of a water heater will show the elementary principles in\r\nall of these devices.\r\n\r\nA SIMPLE ELECTRIC HEATER.--In Fig. 96 the illustration shows a cup or\r\nholder (A) for the wire, made of hard rubber. This may be of such\r\ndiameter as to fit upon and form the cover for a glass (B). The rubber\r\nshould be 1/2 inch thick. Two holes are bored through the rubber cup,\r\nand through them are screwed two round-headed screws (C, D), each screw\r\nbeing 1-1/2 inches long, so they will project an inch below the cap.\r\nEach screw should have a small hole in its lower end to receive a pin\r\n(E) which will prevent the resistance wire from slipping off.\r\n\r\nThe resistance wire (F) is coiled for a suitable length, dependent upon\r\nthe current used, one end being fastened by wrapping it around the screw\r\n(C). The other end of the wire is then brought upwardly through the\r\ninterior of the coil and secured in like manner to the other screw (D).\r\n\r\nCaution must be used to prevent the different coils or turns from\r\ntouching each other. When completed, the coil may be immersed in water,\r\nthe current turned on, and left so until the water is sufficiently\r\nheated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figs. 97-98._ RESISTANCE DEVICE]\r\n\r\nHOW TO ARRANGE FOR QUANTITY OF CURRENT USED.--It is difficult to\r\ndetermine just the proper length the coil should be, or the sizes of the\r\nwire, unless you know what kind of current you have. You may, however,\r\nrig up your own apparatus for the purpose of making it fit your heater,\r\nby preparing a base of wood (A) 8 inches long, 3 inches wide and 1 inch\r\nthick. On this mount four electric lamp sockets (B). Then connect the\r\ninlet wire (C) by means of short pieces of wire (D) with all the sockets\r\non one side. The outlet wire (E) should then be connected up with the\r\nother sides of the sockets by the short wires (F). If, now, we have one\r\n16-candlepower lamp in one of the sockets, there is a half ampere going\r\nthrough the wires (C, F). If there are two lamps on the board you will\r\nhave 1 ampere, and so on. By this means you may readily determine how\r\nmuch current you are using and it will also afford you a means of\r\nfinding out whether you have too much or too little wire in your coil to\r\ndo the work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 99._ PLAN VIEW OF ELECTRIC IRON]\r\n\r\nAN ELECTRIC IRON.--An electric iron is made in the same way. The upper\r\nside of a flatiron has a circular or oval depression (A) cast therein,\r\nand a spool of slate (B) is made so it will fit into the depression and\r\nthe high resistance wire (C) is wound around this spool, and insulating\r\nmaterial, such as asbestos, must be used to pack around it. Centrally,\r\nthe slate spool has an upwardly projecting circular extension (D) which\r\npasses through the cap or cover (E) of the iron. The wires of the\r\nresistance coil are then brought through this circular extension and\r\nare connected up with the source of electrical supply. Wires are now\r\nsold for this purpose, which are adapted to withstand an intense heat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 100._ SECTION OF ELECTRIC IRON]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing example of the use of the current, through resistance\r\nwires, has a very wide application, and any boy, with these examples\r\nbefore him, can readily make these devices.\r\n\r\nTHERMO ELECTRICITY.--It has long been the dream of scientists to convert\r\nheat directly into electricity. The present practice is to use a boiler\r\nto generate steam, an engine to provide the motion, and a dynamo to\r\nconvert that motion into electricity. The result is that there is loss\r\nin the process of converting the fuel heat into steam; loss to change\r\nthe steam into motion, and loss to make electricity out of the motion\r\nof the engine. By using water-power there is less actual loss; but\r\nwater-power is not available everywhere.\r\n\r\nCONVERTING HEAT DIRECTLY INTO ELECTRICITY.--Heat may be converted\r\ndirectly into electricity without using a boiler, an engine or a dynamo,\r\nbut it has not been successful from a commercial standpoint. It is\r\ninteresting, however, to know and understand the subject, and for that\r\nreason it is explained herein.\r\n\r\nMETALS; ELECTRIC POSITIVE-NEGATIVE.--To understand the principle, it may\r\nbe stated that all metals are electrically positive-negative to each\r\nother. You will remember that it has hereinbefore been stated that if,\r\nfor instance, iron and copper are put into an acid solution, a current\r\nwill be created or generated thereby. So with zinc and copper, the usual\r\nprimary battery elements. In all such cases an electrolyte is used.\r\n\r\nThermo-electricity dispenses with the electrolyte, and nothing is used\r\nbut the metallic elements and heat. The word thermo means heat. If, now,\r\nwe can select two strips of different metals, and place them as far\r\napart as possible--that is, in their positive-negative relations with\r\neach other, and unite the end of one with one end of other by means of a\r\nrivet, and then heat the riveted ends, a current will be generated in\r\nthe strips. If, for instance, we use an iron in conjunction with a\r\ncopper strip, the current will flow from the copper to the iron, because\r\ncopper is positive to iron, and iron negative to copper. It is from this\r\nthat the term positive-negative is taken.\r\n\r\nThe two metals most available, which are thus farthest apart in the\r\nscale of positive-negative relation, are bismuth and antimony.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 101._ THERMO-ELECTRIC COUPLE]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 101 is shown a thermo-electric couple (A, B) riveted together,\r\nwith thin outer ends connected by means of a wire (C) to form a circuit.\r\nA galvanometer (D) or other current-testing means is placed in this\r\ncircuit. A lamp is placed below the joined ends.\r\n\r\nTHERMO-ELECTRIC COUPLES.--Any number of these couples may be put\r\ntogether and joined at each end to a common wire and a fairly large flow\r\nof current obtained thereby.\r\n\r\nOne thing must be observed: A current will be generated only so long as\r\nthere exists a difference in temperature between the inner and the outer\r\nends of the bars (A, B). This may be accomplished by water, or any other\r\ncooling means which may suggest itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nALTERNATING CURRENTS, CHOKING COILS, TRANSFORMERS, CONVERTERS AND\r\nRECTIFIERS\r\n\r\n\r\nDIRECT CURRENT.--When a current of electricity is generated by a cell,\r\nit is assumed to move along the wire in one direction, in a steady,\r\ncontinuous flow, and is called a _direct_ current. This direct current\r\nis a natural one if generated by a cell.\r\n\r\nALTERNATING CURRENT.--On the other hand, the natural current generated\r\nby a dynamo is alternating in its character--that is, it is not a\r\ndirect, steady flow in one direction, but, instead, it flows for an\r\ninstant in one direction, then in the other direction, and so on.\r\n\r\nA direct-current dynamo such as we have shown in Chapter IV, is much\r\neasier to explain, hence it is illustrated to show the third method used\r\nin generating an electric current.\r\n\r\nIt is a difficult matter to explain the principle and operation of\r\nalternating current machines, without becoming, in a measure, too\r\ntechnical for the purposes of this book, but it is important to know the\r\nfundamentals involved, so that the operation and uses of certain\r\napparatus, like the choking coil, transformers, rectifiers and\r\nconverters, may be explained.\r\n\r\nTHE MAGNETIC FIELD.--It has been stated that when a wire passes through\r\nthe magnetic field of a magnet, so as to cut the lines of force flowing\r\nout from the end of a magnet, the wire will receive a charge of\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 102._ CUTTING A MAGNETIC FIELD]\r\n\r\nTo explain this, study Fig. 102, in which is a bar magnet (A). If we\r\ntake a metal wire (B) and bend it in the form of a loop, as shown, and\r\nmount the ends on journal-bearing blocks, the wire may be rotated so\r\nthat the loop will pass through the magnetic field. When this takes\r\nplace, the wire receives a charge of electricity, which moves, say, in\r\nthe direction of the darts, and will make a complete circuit if the ends\r\nof the looped wire are joined, as shown by the conductor (D).\r\n\r\nACTION OF THE MAGNETIZED WIRE.--You will remember, also that we have\r\npointed out how, when a current passes over a wire, it has a magnetic\r\nfield extending out around it at all points, so that while it is passing\r\nthrough the magnetic field of the magnet (A), it becomes, in a measure,\r\na magnet of its own and tries to set up in business for itself as a\r\ngenerator of electricity. But when the loop leaves the magnetic field,\r\nthe magnetic or electrical impulse in the wire also leaves it.\r\n\r\nTHE MOVEMENT OF A CURRENT IN A CHARGED WIRE.--Your attention is\r\ndirected, also, to another statement, heretofore made, namely, that when\r\na current from a charged wire passes by induction to a wire across\r\nspace, so as to charge it with an electric current, it moves along the\r\ncharged wire in a direction opposite to that of the current in the\r\ncharging wire.\r\n\r\nNow, the darts show the direction in which the current moves while it is\r\napproaching and passing through the magnetic field. But the moment the\r\nloop is about to pass out of the magnetic field, the current in the loop\r\nsurges back in the opposite direction, and when the loop has made a\r\nrevolution and is again entering the magnetic field, it must again\r\nchange the direction of flow in the current, and thus produce\r\nalternations in the flow thereof.\r\n\r\nLet us illustrate this by showing the four positions of the revolving\r\nloop. In Fig. 103 the loop (B) is in the middle of the magnetic field,\r\nmoving upwardly in the direction of the curved dart (A), and while in\r\nthat position the voltage, or the electrical impulse, is the most\r\nintense. The current used flows in the direction of the darts (C) or to\r\nthe left.\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 104, the loop (A) has gone beyond the influence of the magnetic\r\nfield, and now the current in the loop tries to return, or reverse\r\nitself, as shown by the dart (D). It is a reaction that causes the\r\ncurrent to die out, so that when the loop has reached the point farthest\r\nfrom the magnet, as shown in Fig. 105, there is no current in the loop,\r\nor, if there is any, it moves faintly in the direction of the dart (E).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figs. 103-106._ ILLUSTRATING ALTERNATIONS]\r\n\r\nCURRENT REVERSING ITSELF.--When the loop reaches its lowest point (Fig.\r\n106) it again comes within the magnetic field and the current commences\r\nto flow back to its original direction, as shown by darts (C).\r\n\r\nSELF-INDUCTION.--This tendency of a current to reverse itself, under the\r\nconditions cited, is called self-induction, or inductance, and it would\r\nbe well to keep this in mind in pursuing the study of alternating\r\ncurrents.\r\n\r\nYou will see from the foregoing, that the alternations, or the change of\r\ndirection of the current, depends upon the speed of rotation of the loop\r\npast the end of the magnet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figs. 107-108._ FORM FOR INCREASING ALTERNATIONS]\r\n\r\nInstead, therefore, of using a single loop, we may make four loops (Fig.\r\n107), which at the same speed as we had in the case of the single loop,\r\nwill give four alternations, instead of one, and still further, to\r\nincrease the periods of alternation, we may use the four loops and two\r\nmagnets, as in Fig. 108. By having a sufficient number of loops and of\r\nmagnets, there may be 40, 50, 60, 80, 100 or 120 such alternating\r\nperiods in each second. Time, therefore, is an element in the operation\r\nof alternating currents.\r\n\r\nLet us now illustrate the manner of connecting up and building the\r\ndynamo, so as to derive the current from it. In Fig. 109, the loop (A)\r\nshows, for convenience, a pair of bearings (B). A contact finger (C)\r\nrests on each, and to these the circuit wire (D) is attached. Do not\r\nconfuse these contact fingers with the commutator brushes, shown in the\r\ndirect-current motor, as they are there merely for the purpose of making\r\ncontact between the revolving loop (A) and stationary wire (D).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 109._ CONNECTION OF ALTERNATING DYNAMO ARMATURE]\r\n\r\nBRUSHES IN A DIRECT-CURRENT DYNAMO.--The object of the brushes in the\r\ndirect-current dynamo, in connection with a commutator, is to convert\r\nthis _inductance_ of the wire, or this effort to reverse itself into a\r\ncurrent which will go in one direction all the time, and not in both\r\ndirections alternately.\r\n\r\nTo explain this more fully attention is directed to Figs. 110 and 111.\r\nLet A represent the armature, with a pair of grooves (B) for the wires.\r\nThe commutator is made of a split tube, the parts so divided being\r\ninsulated from each other, and in Fig. 110, the upper one, we shall call\r\nand designate the positive (+) and the lower one the negative (-). The\r\narmature wire (C) has one end attached to the positive commutator\r\nterminal and the other end of this wire is attached to the negative\r\nterminal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 110._ DIRECT CURRENT DYNAMO]\r\n\r\nOne brush (D) contacts with the positive terminal of the commutator and\r\nthe other brush (E) with the negative terminal. Let us assume that the\r\ncurrent impulse imparted to the wire (C) is in the direction of the dart\r\n(F, Fig. 110). The current will then flow through the positive (+)\r\nterminal of the commutator to the brush (D), and from the brush (D)\r\nthrough the wire (G) to the brush (E), which contacts with the negative\r\n(-) terminal of the commutator. This will continue to be the case, while\r\nthe wire (C) is passing the magnetic field, and while the brush (D) is\r\nin contact with the positive (+) terminal. But when the armature makes a\r\nhalf turn, or when it reaches that point where the brush (D) contacts\r\nwith the negative (-) terminal, and the brush (E) contacts with the\r\npositive (+) terminal, a change in the direction of the current through\r\nthe wire (G) takes place, unless something has happened to change it\r\nbefore it has reached the brushes (D, E).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 111._ CIRCUIT WIRES IN DIRECT CURRENT DYNAMO]\r\n\r\nNow, this change is just exactly what has happened in the wire (C), as\r\nwe have explained. The current attempts to reverse itself and start out\r\non business of its own, so to speak, with the result that when the\r\nbrushes (D and E) contact with the negative and positive terminals,\r\nrespectively, the surging current in the wire (C) is going in the\r\ndirection of the dart (H)--that is, while, in Fig. 110, the current\r\nflows from the wire (C) into the positive terminal, and out of the\r\nnegative terminal into the wire (C), the conditions are exactly reversed\r\nin Fig. 111. Here the current in wire C flows _into_ the negative (-)\r\nterminal, and _from_ the positive (+) terminal into the wire C, so that\r\nin either case the current will flow out of the brush D and into the\r\nbrush E, through the external circuit (G).\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, therefore, that in the direct-current motor, advantage\r\nis taken of the surging, or back-and-forth movement, of the current to\r\npass it along in one direction, whereas in the alternating current no\r\nsuch change in direction is attempted.\r\n\r\nALTERNATING POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE POLES.--The alternating current,\r\nowing to this surging movement, makes the poles alternately positive and\r\nnegative. To express this more clearly, supposing we take a line (A,\r\nFig. 112), which is called the zero line, or line of no electricity. The\r\ncurrent may be represented by the zigzag line (B). The lines (B) above\r\nzero (A) may be designated as positive, and those below the line as\r\nnegative. The polarity reverses at the line A, goes up to D, which is\r\nthe maximum intensity or voltage above zero, and, when the current falls\r\nand crosses the line A, it goes in the opposite direction to E, which is\r\nits maximum voltage in the other direction. In point of time, if it\r\ntakes one second for the current to go from C to F, on the down line,\r\nthen it takes only a half second to go from C to G, so that the line A\r\nrepresents the time, and the line H the intensity, a complete cycle\r\nbeing formed from C, D, F, then through F, E, C, and so on.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 112._ ALTERNATING POLARITY LINES]\r\n\r\nHOW AN ALTERNATING DYNAMO IS MADE.--It is now necessary to apply these\r\nprinciples in the construction of an alternating-current machine. Fig.\r\n113 is a diagram representing the various elements, and the circuiting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 113._ ALTERNATING CURRENT DYNAMO]\r\n\r\nLet A represent the ring or frame containing the inwardly projecting\r\nfield magnet cores (B). C is the shaft on which the armature revolves,\r\nand this carries the wheel (D), which has as many radially disposed\r\nmagnet cores (E) as there are of the field magnet cores (B).\r\n\r\nThe shaft (C) also carries two pulleys with rings thereon. One of these\r\nrings (F) is for one end of the armature winding, and the other ring\r\n(G) for the other end of the armature wire.\r\n\r\nTHE WINDINGS.--The winding is as follows: One wire, as at H, is first\r\ncoiled around one magnet core, the turnings being to the right. The\r\noutlet terminal of this wire is then carried to the next magnet core and\r\nwound around that, in the opposite direction, and so on, so that the\r\nterminal of the wire is brought out, as at I, all of these wires being\r\nconnected to binding posts (J, J\'), to which, also, the working circuits\r\nare attached.\r\n\r\nTHE ARMATURE WIRES.--The armature wires, in like manner, run from the\r\nring (G) to one armature core, being wound from right to left, then to\r\nthe next core, which is wound to the right, afterward to the next core,\r\nwhich is wound to the left, and so on, the final end of the wire being\r\nconnected up with the other ring (F). The north (N) and the south (S)\r\npoles are indicated in the diagram.\r\n\r\nCHOKING COIL.--The self-induction in a current of this kind is utilized\r\nin transmitting electricity to great distances. Wires offer resistance,\r\nor they impede the flow of a current, as hereinbefore stated, so that it\r\nis not economical to transmit a direct current over long distances. This\r\ncan be done more efficiently by means of the alternating current, which\r\nis subject to far less loss than is the case with the direct current.\r\nIt affords a means whereby the flow of a current may be checked or\r\nreduced without depending upon the resistance offered by the wire over\r\nwhich it is transmitted. This is done by means of what is called a\r\nchoking coil. It is merely a coil of wire, wound upon an iron core, and\r\nthe current to be choked passes through the coil. To illustrate this,\r\nlet us take an arc lamp designed to use a 50-volt current. If a current\r\nis supplied to it carrying 100 volts, it is obvious that there are 50\r\nvolts more than are needed. We must take care of this excess of 50 volts\r\nwithout losing it, as would happen were we to locate a resistance of\r\nsome kind in the circuit. This result we accomplish by the introduction\r\nof the choking coil, which has the effect of absorbing the excessive 50\r\nvolts, the action being due to its quality of self-induction, referred\r\nto in the foregoing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 114._ CHOKING COIL]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 114, A is the choking coil and B an arc lamp, connected up, in\r\nseries, with the choking coil.\r\n\r\nTHE TRANSFORMER.--It is more economical to transmit 10,000 volts a long\r\ndistance than 1,000 volts, because the lower the pressure, or the\r\nvoltage, the larger must be the conductor to avoid loss. It is for this\r\nreason that 500 volts, or more, are used on electric railways. For\r\nelectric light purposes, where the current goes into dwellings, even\r\nthis is too high, so a transformer is used to take a high-voltage\r\ncurrent from the main line and transform it into a low voltage. This is\r\ndone by means of two distinct coils of wire, wound upon an iron core.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 115._ A TRANSFORMER]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 115 the core is O-shaped, so that a primary winding (A), from\r\nthe electrical source, can be wound upon one limb, and the secondary\r\nwinding (B) wound around the other limb. The wires, to supply the\r\nlamps, run from the secondary coil. There is no electrical connection\r\nbetween the two coils, but the action from the primary to the secondary\r\ncoil is solely by induction. When a current passes through the primary\r\ncoil, the surging movement, heretofore explained, is transmitted to the\r\niron core, and the iron core, in turn, transmits this electrical energy\r\nto the secondary coil.\r\n\r\nHOW THE VOLTAGE IS DETERMINED.--The voltage produced by the secondary\r\ncoil will depend upon several things, namely, the strength of the\r\nmagnetism transmitted to it; the rapidity, or periodicity of the\r\ncurrent, and the number of turns of wire around the coil. The voltage is\r\ndependent upon the length of the winding. But the voltage may also be\r\nincreased, as well as decreased. If the primary has, we will say, 100\r\nturns of wire, and has 200 volts, and the secondary has 50 turns of\r\nwire, the secondary will give forth only one-half as much as the\r\nprimary, or 100 volts.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, 400 volts would be required, the secondary should\r\nhave 200 turns in the winding.\r\n\r\nVOLTAGE AND AMPERAGE IN TRANSFORMERS.--It must not be understood that,\r\nby increasing the voltage in this way, we are getting that much more\r\nelectricity. If the primary coil, with 100 turns, produces a current of\r\n200 volts and 50 amperes, which would be 200 \xc3\x97 50 = 10,000 watts, and\r\nthe secondary coil has 50 turns, we shall have 100 volts and 100\r\namperes: 100 (V.) \xc3\x97 100 (A.) = 10,000 watts. Or, if, on the other hand,\r\nour secondary winding is composed of 200 turns, we shall have 400 volts\r\nand 25 amperes, 400 (volts) \xc3\x97 25 (amperes) also gives 10,000 watts.\r\n\r\nNecessarily, there will be some loss, but the foregoing is offered as\r\nthe theoretical basis of calculation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nELECTRIC LIGHTING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most important step in the electric field, after the dynamo had been\r\nbrought to a fairly workable condition, was its utilization to make\r\nlight. It was long known prior to the discovery of practical electric\r\ndynamos, that the electric current would produce an intense heat.\r\n\r\nOrdinary fuels under certain favorable conditions will produce a\r\ntemperature of 4,500 degrees of heat; but by means of the electric arc,\r\nas high as six, eight and ten thousand degrees are available.\r\n\r\nThe fact that when a conductor, in an electric current, is severed, a\r\nspark will follow the drawing part of the broken ends, led many\r\nscientists to believe, even before the dynamo was in a practical shape,\r\nthat electricity, sooner or later, would be employed as the great\r\nlighting agent.\r\n\r\nWhen the dynamo finally reached a stage in development where its\r\noperation could be depended on, and was made reversible, the first\r\nactive steps were taken to not only produce, but to maintain an arc\r\nbetween two electrodes.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult and tedious to follow out the first experiments\r\nin detail, and it might, also, be useless, as information, in view of\r\nthe present knowledge of the science. A few steps in the course of the\r\ndevelopment are, however, necessary to a complete understanding of the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nReference has been made in a previous chapter to what is called the\r\n_Electric Arc_, produced by slightly separated conductors, across which\r\nthe electric current jumps, producing the brilliantly lighted area.\r\n\r\nThis light is produced by the combustion of the carbon of which the\r\nelectrodes are composed. Thus, the illumination is the result of\r\ndirectly burning a fuel. The current, in passing from one electrode to\r\nthe other, through the gap, produces such an intense heat that the fuel\r\nthrough which the current passes is consumed.\r\n\r\nCarbon in a comparatively pure state is difficult to ignite, owing to\r\nits great resistance to heat. At about 7,000 degrees it will fuse, and\r\npass into a vapor which causes the intense illumination.\r\n\r\nThe earliest form of electric lighting was by means of the arc, in which\r\nthe light is maintained so long as the electrodes were kept a certain\r\ndistance apart.\r\n\r\nTo do this requires delicate mechanism, for the reason that when contact\r\nis made, and the current flows through the two electrodes, which are\r\nconnected up directly with the coils of a magnet, the cores, or\r\narmatures, will be magnetized. The result is that the electrode,\r\nconnected with the armature of the magnet, is drawn away from the other\r\nelectrode, and the arc is formed, between the separated ends.\r\n\r\nAs the current also passes through a resistance coil, the moment the\r\nends of the electrodes are separated too great a distance, the\r\nresistance prevents a flow of the normal amount of current, and the\r\narmature is compelled to reduce its pull. The effect is to cause the two\r\nelectrodes to again approach each other, and in doing so the arc becomes\r\nbrighter.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, therefore, that there is a constant fight between the\r\nresistance coil and the magnet, the combined action of the two being\r\nsuch, that, if properly arranged, and with powers in correct relation to\r\neach other, the light may be maintained without undue flickering. Such\r\ndevices are now universally used, and they afford a steady and reliable\r\nmeans of illumination.\r\n\r\nMany improvements are made in this direction, as well as in the\r\ningredients of the electrodes. A very novel device for assuring a\r\nperfect separation at all times between the electrodes, is by means of a\r\npair of parallel carbons, held apart by a non-conductor such as clay, or\r\nsome mixture of earth, a form of which is shown in Fig. 116.\r\n\r\nThe drawing shows two electrodes, separated by a non-conducting\r\nmaterial, which is of such a character that it will break down and\r\ncrumble away, as the ends of the electrodes burn away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 116. Parallel Carbons._]\r\n\r\nThis device is admirable where the alternating current is used, because\r\nthe current moves back and forth, and the two electrodes are thus burned\r\naway at the same rate of speed.\r\n\r\nIn the direct or continuous current the movement is in one direction\r\nonly, and as a result the positive electrode is eaten away twice as fast\r\nas the negative.\r\n\r\nThis is the arc form of lamp universally used for lighting large spaces\r\nor areas, such as streets, railway stations, and the like. It is\r\nimportant also as the means for utilizing searchlight illumination, and\r\nfrequently for locomotive headlights.\r\n\r\nArc lights are produced by what is called the _series current_. This\r\nmeans that the lamps are all connected in a single line. This is\r\nillustrated by reference to Fig. 117, in which A represents the wire\r\nfrom the dynamo, and B, C the two electrodes, showing the current\r\npassing through from one lamp to the next.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 117. Arc-Lighting Circuit._]\r\n\r\nA high voltage is necessary in order to cause the current to leap across\r\nthe gap made by the separation of the electrodes.\r\n\r\nTHE INCANDESCENT SYSTEM.--This method is entirely different from the arc\r\nsystem. It has been stated that certain metals conduct electricity with\r\ngreater facility than others, and some have higher resistance than\r\nothers. If a certain amount of electricity is forced through some\r\nmetals, they will become heated. This is true, also, if metals, which,\r\nordinarily, will conduct a current freely, are made up into such small\r\nconductors that it is difficult for the current to pass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig 118. Interrupted Conductor._]\r\n\r\nIn the arc method high voltage is essential; in the incandescent plan,\r\ncurrent is the important consideration. In the arc, the light is\r\nproduced by virtue of the break in the line of the conductor; in the\r\nincandescent, the system is closed at all times.\r\n\r\nSupposing we have a wire A, a quarter of an inch in diameter, carrying a\r\ncurrent of, say, 500 amperes, and at any point in the circuit the wire\r\nis made very small, as shown at B, in Fig. 118, it is obvious that the\r\nsmall wire would not be large enough to carry the current.\r\n\r\nThe result would be that the small connection B would heat up, and,\r\nfinally, be fused. While the large part of the wire would carry 500\r\namperes, the small wire could not possibly carry more than, say, 10\r\namperes. Now these little wires are the filaments in an electric bulb,\r\nand originally the attempt was made to have them so connected up that\r\nthey could be illuminated by a single wire, as with the arc system above\r\nexplained, one following the other as shown in Fig. 117.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Fig. 119. Incandescent Circuit._]\r\n\r\nIt was discovered, however, that the addition of each successive lamp,\r\nso wired, would not give light in proportion to the addition, but at\r\nonly about one-fourth the illumination, and such a course would,\r\ntherefore, make electric lighting enormously expensive.\r\n\r\nThis knowledge resulted in an entirely new system of wiring up the lamps\r\nin a circuit. This is explained in Fig. 119. In this figure A represents\r\nthe dynamo, B, B the brushes, C, D the two line wires, E the lamps, and\r\nF the short-circuiting wires between the two main conductors C, D.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the wires C, D are larger than the cross wires\r\nF. The object is to show that the main wires might carry a very heavy\r\namperage, while the small cross wires F require only a few amperes.\r\n\r\nThis is called the _multiple_ circuit, and it is obvious that the entire\r\namperage produced by the dynamo will not be required to pass through\r\neach lamp, but, on the other hand, each lamp takes only enough necessary\r\nto render the filament incandescent.\r\n\r\nThis invention at once solved the problem of the incandescent system and\r\nwas called the subdivision of the electric light. By this means the cost\r\nwas materially reduced, and the wiring up and installation of lights\r\nmaterially simplified.\r\n\r\nBut the divisibility of the light did not, by any means, solve the great\r\nproblem that has occupied the attention of electricians and\r\nexperimenters ever since. The great question was and is to preserve the\r\nlittle filament which is heated to incandescence, and from which we get\r\nthe light.\r\n\r\nThe effort of the current to pass through the small filament meets with\r\nsuch a great resistance that the substance is heated up. If it is made\r\nof metal there is a point at which it will fuse, and thus the lamp is\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\nIt was found that carbon, properly treated, would heat to a brilliant\r\nwhite heat without fusing, or melting, so that this material was\r\nemployed. But now followed another difficulty. As this intense heat\r\nconsumed the particles of carbon, owing to the presence of oxygen, means\r\nwere sought to exclude the air.\r\n\r\nThis was finally accomplished by making a bulb of glass, from which the\r\nair was exhausted, and as such a globe had no air to support combustion,\r\nthe filaments were finally made so that they would last a long time\r\nbefore being finally disintegrated.\r\n\r\nThe quest now is, and has been, to find some material of a purely\r\nmetallic character, which will have a very high fusing point, and which\r\nwill, therefore, dispense with the cost of the exhausted bulb. Some\r\nmetals, as for instance, osmium, tantalum, thorium, and others, have\r\nbeen used, and others, also, with great success, so that the march of\r\nimprovements is now going forward with rapid strides.\r\n\r\nVAPOR LAMPS.--One of the directions in which considerable energy has\r\nbeen directed in the past, was to produce light from vapors. The Cooper\r\nHewitt mercury vapor lamp is a tube filled with the vapor of mercury,\r\nand a current is sent through the vapor which produces a greenish\r\nlight, and owing to that peculiar color, has not met with much success.\r\n\r\nIt is merely cited to show that there are other directions than the use\r\nof metallic conductors and filaments which will produce light, and the\r\nday is no doubt close at hand when we may expect some important\r\ndevelopments in the production of light by means of the Hertzian waves.\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENTS.--Electricity, however, is not a cheap\r\nmethod of illumination. The enormous heat developed is largely wasted.\r\nThe quest of the inventor is to find a means whereby light can be\r\nproduced without the generation of the immense heat necessary.\r\n\r\nMan has not yet found a means whereby he can make a heat without\r\nincreasing the temperature, as nature does it in the glow worm, or in\r\nthe firefly. A certain electric energy will produce both light and heat,\r\nbut it is found that much more of this energy is used in the heat than\r\nin the light.\r\n\r\nWhat wonderful possibilities are in store for the inventor who can make\r\na heatless light! It is a direction for the exercise of ingenuity that\r\nwill well repay any efforts.\r\n\r\n_Curious Superstitions Concerning Electricity_\r\n\r\nElectricity, as exhibited in light, has been the great marvel of all\r\ntimes. The word electricity itself comes from the thunderbolt of the\r\nancient God Zeus, which is known to be synonymous with the thunderbolt\r\nand the lightning.\r\n\r\nMagnetism, which we know to be only another form of electricity, was not\r\nregarded the same as electricity by the ancients. Iron which had the\r\nproperty to attract, was first found near the town of Magnesia, in\r\nLydia, and for that reason was called magnetism.\r\n\r\nLater on, a glimmer of the truth seemed to dawn on the early scientists,\r\nwhen they saw the resemblance between the actions of the amber and the\r\nloadstone, as both attracted particles. And here another curious thing\r\nresulted. Amber will attract particles other than metals. The magnet did\r\nnot; and from this imperfect observation and understanding, grew a\r\nbelief that electricity, or magnetism would attract all substances, even\r\nhuman flesh, and many devices were made from magnets, and used as cures\r\nfor the gout, and to affect the brain, or to remove pain.\r\n\r\nEven as early as 2,500 years before the birth of Christ the Chinese knew\r\nof the properties of the magnet, and also discovered that a bar of the\r\npermanent magnet would arrange itself north and south, like the\r\nmariners\' compass. There is no evidence, however, that it was used as a\r\nmariner\'s compass until centuries afterwards.\r\n\r\nBut the matter connected with light, as an electrical development, which\r\ninterests us, is its manifestations to the ancients in the form of\r\nlightning. The electricity of the earth concentrates itself on the tops\r\nof mountains, or in sharp peaks, and accounts for the magnificent\r\nelectrical displays always found in mountainous regions.\r\n\r\nSome years ago, a noted scientist, Dr. Siemens, while standing on the\r\ntop of the great pyramid of Cheops, in Egypt, during a storm, noted that\r\nan electrical discharge flowed from his hand when extended toward the\r\nheavens. The current manifested itself in such a manner that the hissing\r\nnoise was plainly perceptible.\r\n\r\nThe literature of all ages and of all countries shows that this\r\nmanifestation of electrical discharges was noted, and became the subject\r\nof discussions among learned men.\r\n\r\nAll these displays were regarded as the bolts of an angry God, and\r\nhistorians give many accounts of instances where, in His anger, He sent\r\ndown the lightning to destroy.\r\n\r\nAmong the Romans Jupiter thus hurled forth his wrath; and among many\r\nancient people, even down to the time of Charlemagne, any space struck\r\nby lightning was considered sacred, and made consecrated ground.\r\n\r\nFrom this grew the belief that it was sacrilegious to attempt to imitate\r\nthe lightning of the sky--that Deity would visit dire punishment on any\r\nman who attempted to produce an electric light. Virgil relates accounts\r\nwhere certain princes attempted to imitate the lightning, and were\r\nstruck by thunderbolts as punishments.\r\n\r\nLess than a century ago Benjamin Franklin devised the lightning rod, in\r\norder to prevent lightning from striking objects. The literature of that\r\nday abounds with instances of protests made, on the part of those who\r\nwere as superstitions as the people in ancient times, who urged that it\r\nwas impious to attempt to ward off Heaven\'s lightnings. It was argued\r\nthat the lightning was one way in which the Creator manifested His\r\ndispleasure, and exercised His power to strike the wicked.\r\n\r\nWhen such writers as Pliny will gravely set forth an explanation of the\r\ncauses of lightning, as follows in the paragraph below, we can\r\nunderstand why it inculcated superstitious fears in the people of\r\nancient times. He says:\r\n\r\n"Most men are ignorant of that secret, which, by close observation of\r\nthe heavens, deep scholars and principal men of learning have found\r\nout, namely, that they are the fires of the uppermost planets, which,\r\nfalling to the earth, are called lightning; but those especially which\r\nare seated in the middle, that is about Jupiter, perhaps because\r\nparticipating in the excessive cold and moisture from the upper circle\r\nof Saturn, and the immoderate heat of Mars, that is next beneath, by\r\nthis means he discharges his superfluity, and therefore it is commonly\r\nsaid, \'That Jupiter shooteth and darteth lightning.\' Therefore, like as\r\nout of a burning piece of wood a coal flieth forth with a crack, even so\r\nfrom a star is spit out, as it were, and voided forth this celestial\r\nfire, carrying with it presages of future things; so that the heavens\r\nshoweth divine operations, even in these parcels and portions which are\r\nrejected and cast away as superfluous."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nPOWER, AND VARIOUS OTHER ELECTRICAL MANIFESTATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to mention any direction in human activity where\r\nelectricity does not serve as an agent in some form or manner. Man has\r\nlearned that the Creator gave this great power into the hands of man to\r\nuse, and not to curse.\r\n\r\nWhen the dynamo was first developed it did not appear possible that it\r\ncould generate electricity, and then use that electricity in order to\r\nturn the dynamo in the opposite direction. It all seems so very natural\r\nto us now, that such a thing should practically follow; but man had to\r\nlearn this.\r\n\r\nLet us try to make the statement plain by a few simple illustrations. By\r\ncarefully going over the chapter on the making of the dynamo, it will be\r\nevident that the basis of the generation of the current depends on the\r\nchanging of the direction of the flow of an electric current.\r\n\r\nLook at the simple horse-shoe magnet. If two of them are gradually moved\r\ntoward each other, so that the north pole of one approaches the north\r\npole of the other, there is a sensible attempt for them to push away\r\nfrom each other. If, however, one of them is turned, so that the north\r\npole of one is opposite the south pole of the other, they will draw\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nIn this we have the foundation physical action of the dynamo and the\r\nmotor. When power is applied to an armature, and it moves through a\r\nmagnetic field, the action is just the same as in the case of the hand\r\ndrawing the north and the south pole of the two approaching magnets from\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nThe influence of the electrical disturbance produced by that act\r\npermeated the entire winding of the field and armature, and extended out\r\non the whole line with which the dynamo was connected. In this way a\r\ncurrent was established and transmitted, and with proper wires was sent\r\nin the form of circuits and distributed so as to do work.\r\n\r\nBut an electric current, without suitable mechanism, is of no value. It\r\nmust have mechanism to use it, as well as to make it. In the case of\r\nlight, we have explained how the arc and the incandescent lamps utilize\r\nit for that purpose.\r\n\r\nBut now, attempting to get something from it in the way of power, means\r\nanother piece of mechanism. This is done by the motor, and this motor is\r\nsimply a converter, or a device for reversing the action of the\r\nelectricity.\r\n\r\nAttention is called to Figs. 120 and 121. Let us assume that the field\r\nmagnets A, A are the positives, and the magnets B, B the negatives. The\r\nrevolving armature has also four magnet coils, two of them, C, C, being\r\npositive, and the other two, D, D, negative, each of these magnet coils\r\nbeing so connected up that they will reverse the polarities of the\r\nmagnets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figs. 120-121._ ACTION OF MAGNETS IN A DYNAMO]\r\n\r\nNow in the particular position of the revolving armature, in Fig. 120,\r\nthe magnets of the armature have just passed the respective poles of the\r\nfield magnets, and the belt E is compelled to turn the armature past the\r\npole pieces by force in the direction of the arrow F. After the armature\r\nmagnets have gone to the positions in Fig. 121, the positives A try to\r\ndraw back the negatives D of the armature, and at the same time the\r\nnegatives B repel the negatives D, because they are of the same\r\npolarities.\r\n\r\nThis repulsion of the negatives A, B continues until the armature poles\r\nC, D have slightly passed them, when the polarities of the magnets C, D\r\nare changed; so that it will be seen, by reference to Fig. 122, that D\r\nis now retreating from B, and C is going away from A--that is, being\r\nforced away contrary to their natural attractive influences, and in Fig.\r\n123, when the complete cycle is nearly finished, the positives are again\r\napproaching each other and the negatives moving together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figs. 122-123._ CYCLE ACTION IN DYNAMO]\r\n\r\nIn this manner, at every point, the sets of magnets are compelled to\r\nmove against their magnetic pull. This explains the dynamo.\r\n\r\nNow take up the cycle of the motor, and note in Fig. 124 that the\r\nnegative magnets D of the armature are closely approaching the positive\r\nand negative magnets, on one side; and the positive magnets C are\r\nnearing the positive and negatives on the other side. The positives A,\r\ntherefore, attract the negatives D, and the negative B exert a pull on\r\nthe positives C at the same time. The result is that the armature is\r\ncaused to revolve, as shown by the dart G, in a direction opposite to\r\nthe dart in Fig. 120.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figs. 124-125._ ACTION OF MAGNETS IN MOTOR]\r\n\r\nWhen the pole pieces of the magnets C, D are about to pass magnets A, B,\r\nas shown in Fig. 125, it is necessary to change the polarities of the\r\narmature magnets C, D; so that by reference to Fig. 126, it will be seen\r\nthat they are now indicated as C-, and D+, respectively, and have moved\r\nto a point midway between the poles A, B (as in Fig. 125), where the\r\npull on one side, and the push on the other are again the same, and the\r\nlast Figure 127 shows the cycle nearly completed.\r\n\r\nThe shaft of the motor armature is now the element which turns the\r\nmechanism which is to be operated. To convert electrical impulses into\r\npower, as thus shown, results in great loss. The first step is to take\r\nthe steam boiler, which is the first stage in that source which is the\r\nmost common and universal, and by means of fuel, converting water into\r\nsteam. The second is to use the pressure of this steam to drive an\r\nengine; the third is to drive the dynamo which generates the electrical\r\nimpulse; and the fourth is the conversion from the dynamo into a motor\r\nshaft. Loss is met with at each step, and the great problem is to\r\neliminate this waste.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Figs. 126-127._ POSITIONS OF MAGNETS IN MOTOR]\r\n\r\nThe great advantage of electrical power is not in utilizing it for\r\nconsumption at close ranges, but where it is desired to transmit it for\r\nlong distances. Such illustrations may be found in electric railways,\r\nand where water power can be obtained as the primal source of energy,\r\nthe cost is not excessive. It is found, however, that even with the most\r\nimproved forms of mechanism, in electrical construction, the internal\r\ncombustion engines are far more economical.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Transmission of Energy_\r\n\r\nOne of the great problems has been the transmission of the current to\r\ngreat distances. By using a high voltage it may be sent hundreds of\r\nmiles, but to use a current of that character in the cars, or shops, or\r\nhomes, would be exceedingly dangerous.\r\n\r\nTo meet this requirement transformers have been devised, which will take\r\na current of very high voltage, and deliver a current of low tension,\r\nand capable of being used anywhere with the ordinary motors.\r\n\r\nTHE TRANSFORMER.--This is an electrical device made up of a core or\r\ncores of thin sheet metal, around which is wound sets of insulated\r\nwires, one set being designed to receive the high voltage, and the other\r\nset to put out the low voltage, as described in a former chapter.\r\n\r\nThese may be made where the original output is a very high voltage, so\r\nthat they will be stepped down, first from one voltage to a lower, and\r\nthen from that to the next lower stage. This is called the "Step down"\r\ntransformer, and is now used over the entire world, where large voltages\r\nare generated.\r\n\r\nELECTRIC FURNACES.--The most important development of electricity in the\r\ndirection of heat is its use in furnaces. As before stated, an intense\r\nheat is capable of being generated by the electric current, so that it\r\nbecomes the great agent to use for the treatment of refractory material.\r\n\r\nIn furnaces of this kind the electric arc is the mechanical form used to\r\nproduce the great heat, the only difference being in the size of the\r\napparatus. The electric furnace is simply an immense form of arc light,\r\ncapable of taking a high voltage, and such an arc is enclosed within a\r\nsuitable oven of refractory material, which still further conserves the\r\nheat.\r\n\r\nWELDING BY ELECTRICITY.--The next step is to use the high heat thus\r\ncapable of being produced, to fuse metals so that they may be welded\r\ntogether. It is a difficult matter to unite two large pieces of metal by\r\nthe forging method, because the highest heat is required, owing to their\r\nbulk, and in addition immense hammers, weighing tons, must be employed.\r\n\r\nElectric welding offers a simple and easy method of accomplishing the\r\nresult, and in the doing of which it avoids the oxidizing action of the\r\nforging heat. Instead of heating the pieces to be welded in a forge, as\r\nis now done, the ends to be united are simply brought into contact, and\r\nthe current is sent through the ends until they are in a soft condition,\r\nafter which the parts are pressed together and united by the simple\r\nmerging of the plastic condition in which they are reduced by the high\r\nelectric heat.\r\n\r\nThis form of welding makes the most perfect joint, and requires no\r\nhammering, as the mass of the metal flows from one part or end to the\r\nother; the unity is a perfect one, and the advantage is that the metals\r\ncan be kept in a semi-fluid state for a considerable time, thus assuring\r\na perfect admixture of the two parts.\r\n\r\nWith the ordinary form of welding it is necessary to drive the heated\r\nparts together without any delay, and at the least cooling must be\r\nreheated, or the joint will not be perfect.\r\n\r\nThe smallest kinds of electric heating apparatus are now being made, so\r\nthat small articles, sheet metal, small rods, and like parts can be\r\nunited with the greatest facility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nX-RAY, RADIUM, AND THE LIKE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe camera sees things invisible to the human eye. Its most effective\r\nwork is done with beams which are beyond human perception. The\r\nphotographer uses the _Actinic_ rays. Ordinary light is composed of the\r\nseven primary colors, of which the lowest in the scale is the red, and\r\nthe highest to violet.\r\n\r\nThose below the red are called the Infra-red, and they are the Hertzian\r\nwaves, or those used in wireless telegraphy. Those above the violet are\r\ncalled Ultra-violet, and these are employed for X-ray work. The former\r\nare produced by the high tension electric apparatus, which we have\r\ndescribed in the chapter relating to wireless telegraphy; and the\r\nlatter, called also the Roentgen rays, are generated by the Crookes\'\r\nTube.\r\n\r\nThis is a tube from which all the atmosphere has been extracted so that\r\nit is a practical vacuum. Within this are placed electrodes so as to\r\ndivert the action of the electrical discharge in a particular direction,\r\nand this light, when discharged, is of such a peculiar character that\r\nits discovery made a sensation in the scientific world.\r\n\r\nThe reason for this great wonder was not in the fact that it projected a\r\nlight, but because of its character. Ordinary light, as we see it with\r\nthe eye, is capable of being reflected, as when we look into a mirror at\r\nan angle. The X-ray will not reflect, but instead, pass directly through\r\nthe glass.\r\n\r\nThen, ordinary light is capable of refraction. This is shown by a ray of\r\nlight bending as it passes through a glass of water, which is noticed\r\nwhen the light is at an angle to the surface.\r\n\r\nThe X-ray will pass through the water without being changed from a\r\nstraight line. The foregoing being the case, it was but a simple step to\r\nconclude that if it were possible to find a means whereby the human eye\r\ncould see within the ultra-violet beam, it would be possible to see\r\nthrough opaque substances.\r\n\r\nFrom the discovery so important and far reaching it was not long until\r\nit was found that if the ultra-violet rays, thus propagated, were\r\ntransmitted through certain substances, their rates of vibration would\r\nbe brought down to the speeds which send forth the visible rays, and now\r\nthe eye is able to see, in a measure at least, what the actinic rays\r\nshow.\r\n\r\nThis discovery was but the forerunner of a still more important\r\ndevelopment, namely, the discovery of _radium_. The actual finding of\r\nthe metal was preceded by the knowledge that certain minerals, and\r\nwater, as well, possessed the property of radio-activity.\r\n\r\nRadio-activity is a word used to express that quality in metals or other\r\nmaterial by means of which obscure rays are emitted, that have the\r\ncapacity of discharging electrified bodies, and the power to ionize\r\ngases, as well as to actually affect photograph plates.\r\n\r\nCertain metals had this property to a remarkable degree, particularly\r\nuranium, thorium, polonium, actinium, and others, and in 1898 the\r\nCuries, husband and wife, French chemists, isolated an element, very\r\nductile in its character, which was a white metal, and had a most\r\nbrilliant luster.\r\n\r\nPitchblende, the base metal from which this was extracted, was\r\ndiscovered to be highly radio-active, and on making tests of the product\r\ntaken from it, they were surprised to find that it emitted a form of\r\nenergy that far exceeded in calculations any computations made on the\r\nbasis of radio-activity in the metals hitherto examined.\r\n\r\nBut this was not the most remarkable part of the developments. The\r\nenergy, whatever it was, had the power to change many other substances\r\nif brought into close proximity. It darkens the color of diamonds,\r\nquartz, mica, and glass. It changes some of the latter in color, some\r\nkinds being turned to brown and others into violet or purple tinges.\r\n\r\nRadium has the capacity to redden the skin, and affect the flesh of\r\npersons, even at some considerable distance, and it is a most powerful\r\ngermicide, destroying bacteria, and has been found also to produce some\r\nremarkable cures in diseases of a cancerous nature.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable similarity of the rays propagated by this substance, with\r\nthe X-rays, lead many to believe that they are electrical in their\r\ncharacter, and the whole scientific world is now striving to use this\r\nsubstance, as well as the more familiar light waves of the Roentgen\r\ntube, in the healing of diseases.\r\n\r\nIt is not at all remarkable that this use of it should first be\r\nconsidered, as it has been the history of the electrical developments,\r\nfrom the earliest times, that each successive stage should find\r\nadvocates who would urge its virtues to heal the sick.\r\n\r\nIt was so when the dynamo was invented, when the high tension current\r\nwas produced; and electrical therapeutics became a leading theme when\r\ntransmission by induction became recognized as a scientific fact.\r\n\r\nIt is not many years since the X-rays were discovered, and the first\r\nannouncement was concerning its wonderful healing powers.\r\n\r\nThis was particularly true in the case of radium, but for some reason,\r\nafter the first tests, all experimenters were thwarted in their\r\ntheories, because the science, like all others, required infinite\r\npatience and experience. It was discovered, in the case of the X-ray,\r\nthat it must be used in a modified form, and accordingly, various\r\nmodifications of the waves were introduced, called the _m_ and the _n_\r\nrays, as well as many others, each having some peculiar qualification.\r\n\r\nIn time, no doubt, the investigators will find the right quality for\r\neach disease, and learn how to apply it. Thus, electricity, that most\r\nalluring thing which, in itself, cannot be seen, and is of such a\r\ncharacter that it cannot even be defined in terms which will suit the\r\nexact scientific mind, is daily bringing new wonders for our\r\ninvestigation and use.\r\n\r\nIt is, indeed, a study which is so broad that it has no limitations, and\r\na field which never will be exhausted.\r\n\r\nTHE END\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGLOSSARY OF WORDS\r\nUSED IN TEXT OF THIS VOLUME\r\n\r\n\r\nAcid.

It contains over two hundred and fifty\r\nillustrations made especially for this work, and includes also a\r\ncomplete glossary of the technical terms used in the art. The most\r\ncomprehensive volume on this subject ever published for boys.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRICITY FOR BOYS\r\n\r\nThe author has adopted the unique plan of setting forth the fundamental\r\nprinciples in each phase of the science, and practically applying the\r\nwork in the successive stages. It shows how the knowledge has been\r\ndeveloped, and the reasons for the various phenomena, without using\r\ntechnical words so as to bring it within the compass of every boy. It\r\nhas a complete glossary of terms, and is illustrated with two hundred\r\noriginal drawings.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRACTICAL MECHANICS FOR BOYS\r\n\r\nThis book takes the beginner through a comprehensive series of practical\r\nshop work, in which the uses of tools, and the structure and handling of\r\nshop machinery are set forth; how they are utilized to perform the work,\r\nand the manner in which all dimensional work is carried out. Every\r\nsubject is illustrated, and model building explained. It contains a\r\nglossary which comprises a new system of cross references, a feature\r\nthat will prove a welcome departure in explaining subjects.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.  Email contact links and up to date contact\r\ninformation can be found at the Foundation\'s web site and official\r\npage at http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nFor additional contact information:\r\n     Dr. Gregory B. Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
