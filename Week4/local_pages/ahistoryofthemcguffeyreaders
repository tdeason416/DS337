On the reverse of the title pages, two bear a\r\ncopyright entry in the year 1836; the others were entered in 1837. They\r\nare the earliest editions of McGuffey\'s Eclectic Readers that have been\r\nfound in a search lasting forty years.\r\n\r\nThey represent the first efforts in an educational and business\r\nenterprise that has for three-quarters of a century called for the best\r\nexertions of many skilled men, and in their several forms these books\r\nhave taken a conspicuous part in the education of millions of the\r\ncitizens of this country.\r\n\r\nBut what interest can the history of the McGuffey Eclectic Readers have\r\nto those who did not use these books in their school career? Their story\r\ndiffers from that of other readers since in successive forms, adjusted\r\nmore or less perfectly to the changing demands of the schools, they\r\nattained a wider and more prolonged use than has been accorded to any\r\nother series.\r\n\r\n[The Function of Readers]\r\n\r\nBy custom and under sanction of law certain studies are pursued in the\r\ncommon schools of every state. Spelling, reading, writing, arithmetic,\r\ngeography, history, grammar, civics and physiology are the subjects\r\nusually taught. The school authorities select the textbooks which shall\r\nbe used in each subject. The readers are the only texts used in all\r\nschools affording opportunity for distinct ethical teaching. The history\r\nof our country should give ideas of patriotism; the civics should\r\ncontain the primary notions of government; the physiologies should\r\ninstruct the pupils in the laws of health; but the reader should cover\r\nthe whole field of morals and manners and in language that will impress\r\ntheir teaching indelibly upon the mind of every pupil. While the chief\r\naim of the school readers must be to teach the child to apprehend\r\nthought from the printed page and convey this thought to the attentive\r\nlistener with precision, these efforts should be exerted upon thoughts\r\nthat have permanent value. No other texts used in the school room bear\r\ndirectly and positively upon the formation of character in the pupils.\r\nThe school readers are the proper and indispensable texts for teaching\r\ntrue patriotism, integrity, honesty, industry, temperance, courage,\r\npoliteness, and all other moral and intellectual virtues. In these books\r\nevery lesson should have a distinct purpose in view, and the final aim\r\nshould be to establish in the pupils high moral principles which are at\r\nthe foundation of character.\r\n\r\n[Formers of Character]\r\n\r\nThe literature of the English language is rich in material suited to\r\nthis intent; no other language is better endowed. This material is fresh\r\nto every pupil, no matter how familiar it may be to teacher or parent.\r\nAlthough some of it has been in print for three centuries, it is true\r\nand beautiful today.\r\n\r\nPresident Eliot has said, "When we teach a child to read, our primary\r\naim is not to enable it to decipher a way-bill or a receipt, but to\r\nkindle its imagination, enlarge its vision and open for it the avenues\r\nof knowledge." Knowledge gives power, which may be exerted for good or\r\nfor evil. Character gives direction to power. Power is the engine which\r\nmay force the steamer through the water, character is the helm which\r\nrenders the power serviceable for good.\r\n\r\nReaders which have been recognized as formers of good habits of action,\r\nthought, and speech for three-quarters of a century, which have taught\r\na sound morality to millions of children without giving offense to the\r\nmost violent sectarian, which have opened the doors of pure literature\r\nto all their users, are surely worthy of study as to their origin, their\r\nsuccessive changes, and their subsequent career.\r\n\r\nThe story of these readers is told in the specimens of the several\r\neditions, in the long treasured and time-worn contracts, in the books of\r\naccounts kept by the successive publishers, and in the traditions which\r\nhave been passed down from white haired men who gossiped of the early\r\ndays in the schoolbook business. Valuable information has also been\r\nfurnished by descendants of the McGuffey family, and by the educational\r\ninstitutions with which each of the authors of the readers was\r\nconnected.\r\n\r\n[Different Editions]\r\n\r\nFor half a century the present writer has had personal knowledge of the\r\nreaders. At first, as a teacher, using them daily in the class room; but\r\nsoon, as an editor, directing the literary work of the publishers and\r\nowners. It therefore falls to him to narrate a story "quorum pars minima\r\nfui."\r\n\r\nFor more than seventy years the McGuffey Readers have held high rank as\r\ntext-books for use in the elementary schools, especially throughout the\r\nWest and South. But during this time these books have been revised five\r\ntimes and adjusted to the changed conditions in the schools. In each one\r\nof these revisions the marked characteristics of the original series\r\nhave been most scrupulously retained, and the continued success of the\r\nseries is doubtless owing to this fact. There has been a continuity of\r\nspirit.\r\n\r\n[Contents of the Books]\r\n\r\nThe First and Second Readers were first published in 1836. In 1837 the\r\nThird and Fourth Readers were printed. For reasons elsewhere explained\r\nthese books were "improved and enlarged" in 1838. In 1841 a higher\r\nreader was added to the series which was then named McGuffey\'s\r\nRhetorical Guide. In the years 1843 and 1844 the four books then\r\nconstituting the series were thoroughly remodeled and on the title pages\r\nwere placed the words "Newly Revised" and the Rhetorical Guide was\r\nannexed as the Fifth Reader. Ten years later the entire series was made\r\nover and issued in six books. These were then called the New Readers.\r\nFrom 1853 until 1878 the books remained substantially unchanged; but in\r\nthe latter year they were renewed largely in substance and improved in\r\nform. These readers as copyrighted in 1879 were extensively used for\r\nmore than a quarter of a century. Changing conditions in the school room\r\ncalled for another revision in 1901. This latest form now in extensive\r\nuse is called The New McGuffey Readers.\r\n\r\nEach of these revisions has constituted practically a new series\r\nalthough the changes have never included the entire contents. In the\r\nhigher readers will be found today many selections which appeared in the\r\noriginal books. The reason for retaining such selections is clear. No\r\none has been able to write in the English language selections that are\r\nbetter for school use than some written by Shakespeare, Milton, Bacon,\r\nand other early writers. The literature of the English language has not\r\nall been written in the present decade nor in the last century.\r\n\r\nAs at first published, the lower books of the McGuffey Readers had no\r\ntrace of the modern methods now used in teaching the mastery of\r\nwords--even the alphabet was not given in orderly form; but the\r\nalphabetic method of teaching the art of reading was then the only one\r\nused. The pupil at first spelled each word by naming the letters and\r\nthen pronounced each syllable and then the word.\r\n\r\n[First Editions]\r\n\r\nThe following stanza is copied from page 61 of the edition of 1844 to\r\nillustrate the method of presenting words:\r\n\r\n  I like to see a lit-tle dog,\r\n    And pat him on the head;\r\n  So pret-ti-ly he wags his tail\r\n    When-ev-er he is fed.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe First Reader was mostly in words of one syllable. In this book we\r\nfind the story of the lame dog that, when cured, brought another lame\r\ndog to be doctored: of the kind boy who freed his caged bird; of the\r\ncruel boy who drowned the cat and pulled wings and legs from flies; of\r\nPeter Pindar the story teller, and the "snow dog" of Mount St. Bernard;\r\nof Mr. Post who adopted and reared Mary; of the boy who told a lie and\r\nrepented after he was found out; of the chimney sweep who was tempted to\r\nsteal a gold watch but put it back and was thereafter educated by its\r\nowner; of the whisky boy; and of the mischievous boy who played ghost\r\nand made another boy insane. Nearly every lesson has a moral clearly\r\nstated in formal didactic words at its close.\r\n\r\nIn the Second Reader we find the story of the idle boy who talked with\r\nthe bees, dogs, and horses, and having found them all busy, reformed\r\nhimself; of the kind girl who shared her cake with a dog and an old man;\r\nof the mischievous boys who tied the grass across the path and thus\r\nupset not only the milk-maid but the messenger running for a doctor\r\nto come to their father; of the wise lark who knew that the farmer\'s\r\ngrain would not be cut until he resolved to cut it himself; of the wild\r\nand ravenous bear that treed a boy and hung suspended by his boot; and\r\nof another bear that traveled as a passenger by night in a stage coach;\r\nof the quarrelsome cocks, pictured in a clearly English farm yard, that\r\nwere both eaten up by the fox that had been brought in by the defeated\r\ncock; of the honest boy and the thief who was judiciously kicked by the\r\nhorse that carried oranges in baskets; of George Washington and his\r\nhistoric hatchet and the mutilated cherry-tree; and of the garden that\r\nwas planted with seeds in lines spelling Washington\'s name which removed\r\nall doubt as to an intelligent Creator. There were also some lessons on\r\nsuch animals as beavers, whales, peacocks and lions.\r\n\r\n[Favorite Selections]\r\n\r\nThe Third Reader will be remembered first because of the picture, on\r\nthe cover, of Napoleon on his rearing charger. This book contained five\r\nselections from the Bible; Croly\'s "Conflagration of the Ampitheatre\r\nat Rome;" "How a Fly Walks on the Ceiling;" "The Child\'s Inquiry;"\r\n"How big was Alexander, Pa;" Irving\'s "Description of Pompey\'s Pillar;"\r\nWoodworth\'s "Old Oaken Bucket;" Miss Gould\'s "The Winter King;" and\r\nScott\'s "Bonaparte Crossing the Alps," commencing "\'Is the route\r\npracticable?\' said Bonaparte. \'It is barely possible to pass,\' replied\r\nthe engineer. \'Let us set forward, then,\' said Napoleon." The rearing\r\nsteed facing a precipitous slope in the picture gave emphasis to the\r\nwords. There were also in this reader several pieces about Indians and\r\nbears, which indicate that Dr. McGuffey never forgot the stories told\r\nat the fireside by his father of his adventures as an Indian scout and\r\nhunter.\r\n\r\nIn the Fourth Reader there were seventeen selections from the Bible;\r\nWilliam Wirt\'s "Description of the Blind Preacher;" Phillip\'s "Character\r\nof Napoleon Bonaparte;" Bacon\'s "Essay on Studies;" Nott\'s "Speech on\r\nthe Death of Alexander Hamilton;" Addison\'s "Westminster Abbey;"\r\nIrving\'s "Alhambra;" Rogers\'s "Genevra;" Willis\'s "Parrhasius;"\r\nMontgomery\'s "Make Way for Liberty;" two extracts from Milton and two\r\nfrom Shakespeare, and no less than fourteen selections from the writings\r\nof the men and women who lectured before the College of Teachers in\r\nCincinnati. The story of the widow of the Pine Cottage sharing her last\r\nsmoked herring with a strange traveler who revealed himself as her\r\nlong-lost son, returning rich from the Indies, was anonymous, but it\r\nwill be remembered by those who read it.\r\n\r\nThese selections were the most noteworthy ones in the first editions of\r\nthese readers.\r\n\r\nThe First and Second Readers of the McGuffey Series were substantially\r\nmade new at each revision. A comparison of the original Third Reader\r\nwith an edition copyrighted in 1847, shows that the latter book was\r\nincreased about one-third in size. Of the sixty-six selections in the\r\nearly edition only forty-seven were retained, while thirty new ones were\r\ninserted. Among the latter were "Harry and his Dog Frisk" that brought\r\nto him, punished by being sent to bed, a Windsor pear; "Perseverance," a\r\ntale of kite-flying followed by the poem, "Try, try again;" the "Little\r\nPhilosopher," named Peter Hurdle, who caught Mr. Lenox\'s runaway horse\r\nand on examination seemed to lack nothing but an Eclectic spelling book,\r\na reader and a Testament--which were promised him; "The Colonists," in\r\nwhich men of various callings offered their services, and while even the\r\ndancing master was accepted as of some possible use, the gentleman was\r\nscornfully rejected; "Things by Their Right Names," in which a battle\r\nwas described as wholesale murder; "Little Victories," in which Hugh\'s\r\nmother consoled him for the loss of a leg by telling him of the lives of\r\nmen who became celebrated under even greater adversities; "The Wonderful\r\nInstrument," which turned out to be the eye; "Metaphysics," a ludicrous\r\ndescription of a colonial salt-box in affected terms of exactness\r\ndesigned to ridicule some forms of reasoning. Those who used this\r\nedition of the third reader will surely remember some of these\r\nselections.\r\n\r\n[The Bible]\r\n\r\nIn the Fourth Reader printed in 1844 there were thirty new\r\nselections--less than one-third of the book; but some of these were\r\nsuch as will be remembered by those who read them in school. There was\r\n"Respect for the Sabbath Rewarded," in which a barber of Bath had become\r\nso poor because he would not shave his customers on Sunday, that he\r\nborrowed a half-penny to buy a candle Saturday night to give light for\r\na late customer, and was thus discovered to be the long-lost William\r\nReed of Taunton, heir to many thousand pounds; "The Just Judge," who\r\ndisguised himself as a miller and, obtaining a place on the jury,\r\nreceived only five guineas as a bribe when the others got ten, and who\r\nrevealed himself as Lord Chief Justice Hale and tried the case over in\r\nhis miller\'s clothing; Hawthorne\'s "The Town Pump;" Mrs. Southey\'s\r\n"April Day."\r\n\r\n  "All day the low-hung clouds have dropped\r\n    Their garnered fullness down.\r\n  All day a soft gray mist hath wrapped\r\n    Hill, valley, grove and town."\r\n\r\n\r\nBryant\'s "Death of the Flowers;" Campbell\'s "Lochiel\'s Warning;" and the\r\ntrial scene from Shakespeare\'s Merchant of Venice. All these became\r\nfavorite reading exercises in later years.\r\n\r\nAs late as 1840 the Bible was read daily in all the schools of the\r\nWest. Although sectarian or denominational teaching was not permitted,\r\nreligious instruction was desired by the great majority of school\r\npatrons.\r\n\r\nEven up to the opening of the Civil War, whatever the faith or the\r\npractice of the adult inhabitants of the country, the Bible story and\r\nthe Bible diction were familiar to all. The speeches of the popular\r\norators of that day were filled with distinct allusions to the Bible\r\nand these were quickly and clearly apprehended by the people. It may be\r\nquestioned whether popular speeches of the present day would have equal\r\nforce if based on the assumption that everybody knows the Biblical\r\nstories. Indeed it is a common remark made by professors of English in\r\nthe higher institutions of learning that pupils know little of the\r\nBible as a distinctly formative and conservative element in English\r\nliterature. In the texts authorized for the study of English classics,\r\nBiblical allusions are very common. These have little meaning to pupils\r\nwho have not read the Bible, unless the passage is pointed out and\r\nhunted up.\r\n\r\n[Dr. Swing\'s Opinion]\r\n\r\nFrom the pages of these readers the pupils learned to master the printed\r\nword and obtain the thought of the authors. Without conscious effort\r\nthey received moral instruction and incentives toward right living.\r\nWithout intent they treasured in their memories such extracts from the\r\nauthors of the best English Literature as gave them a desire to read\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n[Books as Teachers]\r\n\r\nIn one of his sermons Dr. David Swing of Chicago said: "Much as you may\r\nhave studied the languages or the sciences, that which most affected you\r\nwas the moral lessons in the series of McGuffey. And yet the reading\r\nclass was filed out only once a day to read for a few moments, and\r\nthen we were all sent to our seats to spend two hours in learning\r\nhow to bound New Hampshire or Connecticut, or how long it would take a\r\ngreyhound to overtake a fox or a hare if the spring of each was so and\r\nso, and the poor fugitive had such and such a start. That was perhaps\r\nwell, but we have forgotten how to bound Connecticut, and how to solve\r\nthe equation of the field and thicket; but up out of the far-off years\r\ncome all the blessed lessons in virtue and righteousness which those\r\nreading books taught; and when we now remember, how even these moral\r\nmemories have faded I cannot but wish the teachers had made us bound the\r\nStates less, and solve fewer puzzles in \'position\' and the \'cube root\'\r\nand made us commit to memory the whole series of the McGuffey Eclectic\r\nHeaders. The memory that comes from these far-away pages is full of the\r\nbest wisdom of time or the timeless land. In these books we were indeed\r\nled by a schoolmaster, from beautiful maxims for children up to the\r\nbest thoughts of a long line of sages, and poets, and naturalists. There\r\nwe all first learned the awful weakness of the duel that took away a\r\nHamilton; there we saw the grandeur of the Blind Preacher of William\r\nWirt; there we saw the emptiness of the ambition of Alexander, and there\r\nwe heard even the infidel say, \'Socrates died like a philosopher, but\r\nJesus Christ like a God.\'"\r\n\r\nThis public recognition of the influence of these readers upon the mind\r\nand character of this great preacher is again noted in Rev. Joseph Fort\r\nNewton\'s biography of David Swing in which the books which influenced\r\nthat life are named as "The Bible, Calvin\'s Institutes, Fox\'s Book of\r\nMartyrs and the McGuffey Readers;" and the author quotes David Swing as\r\nsaying that "The Institutes were rather large reading for a boy, but to\r\nthe end of his life he held that McGuffey\'s Sixth Reader was a great\r\nbook. For Swing, as for many a boy in the older West, its varied and\r\nwise selections from the best English authors were the very gates of\r\nliterature ajar."\r\n\r\nOne of the most eminent political leaders of the present day attributes\r\nhis power in the use of English largely to the study of McGuffey\'s Sixth\r\nReader in the common schools of Ohio.\r\n\r\n[How a Japanese Learned English]\r\n\r\nAt a dinner lately given in New York to Marquis Ito of Japan, the\r\nmarquis responded to the toast of his health returning thanks in\r\nEnglish. He then continued his remarks in Japanese for some eight\r\nminutes. At its close Mr. Tsudjuki, who was then the minister of\r\nEducation in Japan, traveling with Marquis Ito as his friend and\r\ncompanion, and who had taken shorthand notes of the Japanese speech,\r\nrose and translated the speech readily and fluently into good English.\r\nOne of the guests asked how he had learned to speak English so\r\ncorrectly. He replied that he had done so in the public schools of Japan\r\nand added, "I learned my English from McGuffey\'s Readers, with which you\r\nare no doubt familiar."\r\n\r\n[The Authorship]\r\n\r\nIt is not unusual to see in the literary columns of a daily newspaper\r\ninquiries as to where certain poems may be found of which a single\r\nstanza is faintly recalled. Many of these prove to be fragments of\r\npieces that are found in the McGuffey Readers. Quite lately Theodore\r\nRoosevelt made the public statement that he did not propose to become a\r\n"Meddlesome Matty." This allusion was perfectly clear to the millions of\r\npeople who used the McGuffey Readers at any time after 1853.\r\n\r\nWhen the Fourth Reader was issued in 1837 it contained a preface of\r\nthree closely printed pages setting forth and defending the plan of\r\nMcGuffey\'s books. In this he said: "In conclusion, the author begs leave\r\nto state, that the whole series of Eclectic Readers is his own. In the\r\npreparation of the rules, etc., for the present volume he has had the\r\nassistance of a very distinguished Teacher, whose judgment and zeal in\r\npromoting the cause of education have often been commended by the\r\nAmerican people. In the arrangement of the series generally, he is\r\nindebted to many of his friends for valuable suggestions, and he takes\r\nthis opportunity of tendering them his thanks for the lively interest\r\nthey have manifested for the success of his undertaking."\r\n\r\nThe sole author of the four readers first issued as the Eclectic Readers\r\nwas William Holmes McGuffey. He was responsible for the marked qualities\r\nin these books which met with such astonishing popular approval in all\r\nthese years. What these qualities are is well known to those who have\r\nused the books and the users are numbered by millions.\r\n\r\n[The Rhetorical Guide]\r\n\r\nThe Rhetorical Guide was prepared by Mr. A.H. McGuffey, and his name\r\nalone was on the early editions. In 1844 the book was revised by the\r\nauthor and Dr. Pinneo, and was given the alternate title "or Fifth\r\nReader of the Eclectic Series." The work of revision occupied two years.\r\nThe title page carried the name of its author until, for reasons of his\r\nown, he asked to have it removed.\r\n\r\nAs usual when revisions of schoolbooks are made, the older edition was\r\ncontinued in publication so long as a distinct demand for it existed.\r\nBut the issuance of a revised edition always suggests the question of\r\nchange, which competing publishers promptly seek to bring about. The\r\npublishers of the "Newly Revised McGuffey Readers," therefore, sought\r\nto replace the older edition wherever it was in use and to displace\r\ncompeting books wherever possible. The edition of 1843 acquired large\r\nsales over a very wide territory in the central West and South. It is\r\nthe edition generally known by the grandfathers of the school boys of\r\nthe present day.\r\n\r\nIt may be interesting to name some of the selections in this Rhetorical\r\nGuide issued in 1844 since in modified form the work has been the\r\nhighest reader of the series.\r\n\r\n[Selections of Value]\r\n\r\nAs a guide toward rhetorical reading the book contained a carefully\r\nprepared collection of rules and directions with examples for practice\r\nin Articulation. Inflection, Accent and Emphasis, Reading Verse, for the\r\nManagement of the Voice and Gesture. These pages were intended for drill\r\nwork, and in those days the teachers were not content with the dull\r\nmonotonous utterance of the words or with mere mastery of thought, to\r\nbe tested by multitudinous questioning. If the pupil obtained from the\r\nprinted page the very thought the author intended to convey, the pupil\r\nwas expected to read orally so as to express that thought to all\r\nhearers. If the correct thought was thus heard, no questions were\r\nneeded. The test of reading orally is the communication of thought by\r\nthe reader to the intelligent and attentive hearer, and the words of the\r\nauthor carry this message more accurately than can any other words the\r\npupil may select.\r\n\r\n[Noted Selections]\r\n\r\nThe selections in the Rhetorical Guide were made, first of all, to teach\r\nthe art of reading. There was therefore great variety. Second, to\r\ninculcate a love for literature. Therefore the selections were taken\r\nfrom the great writers,--poets, orators, essayists, historians, and\r\npreachers. The extracts are wonderfully complete in themselves,--one\r\ndoes not need to read the whole of Byron\'s Don Juan to appreciate the\r\nsix stanzas that describe the thunder-storm on the Alps. Of the poetical\r\nextracts all the users of this book will remember Southey\'s "Cataract\r\nof Lodore" with its exacting drill on the ending,--"ing," Longfellow\'s\r\n"Village Blacksmith" and the "Reaper and the Flowers;" Bryant\'s\r\n"Thanatopsis" and "Song of the Stars;" Wolfe\'s "Burial of Sir John\r\nMoore;" Gray\'s "Elegy;" Mrs. Hemans\'s "Landing of the Pilgrim Fathers;"\r\nCowper\'s "My Mother\'s Picture;" Jones\'s "What Constitutes a State;"\r\nScott\'s "Lochinvar;" Halleck\'s "Marco Bozzaris;" Drake\'s "American\r\nFlag;" and Mrs. Thrale\'s "Three Warnings." As an introduction to the\r\nthought, imagery and diction of Shakespeare, there were "Hamlet\'s\r\nSoliloquy," "Speech of Henry Fifth to his Troops," "Othello\'s Apology,"\r\n"The Fall of Cardinal Wolsey" and his death, the "Quarrel of Brutus and\r\nCassius" (often committed to memory and spoken) and Antony\'s Oration\r\nover dead Caesar. The extracts from orations were chosen largely for\r\ntheir relation to great events in history. There were Patrick Henry\'s\r\n"Speech before the Virginia Convention," Walpole\'s "Reproof of Mr.\r\nPitt," and Pitt\'s reply. Who cannot remember "The atrocious crime of\r\nbeing a young man," and go on with the context? There were extracts\r\nfrom Hayne\'s "Speech on South Carolina," and Webster\'s reply defending\r\nMassachusetts; a part of Burke\'s long speech on the Trial of Warren\r\nHastings prefaced by Macaulay\'s description of the scene; Webster\'s\r\n"Speech on the Trial of a Murderer," ending with "It must be confessed,\r\nit will be confessed; there is no refuge from confession but suicide,\r\nand suicide is confession;" Webster\'s speech on the Importance of the\r\nUnion with its concluding sentiment, "Liberty and Union, now and\r\nforever; one and inseparable." There was also Fox\'s "Political Pause"\r\nwith its wonderful requirements of inflection to express irony;\r\nSprague\'s "American Indians," "Not many generations ago, where you now\r\nsit, encircled with all that exalts and embellishes civilized life,\r\nthe rank thistle nodded in the wind, and the wild fox dug his hole\r\nunscared." Did you not commit it to memory and speak it? Then there was\r\nWebster\'s Speech in which he supplied John Adams from his own fervid\r\nimagination that favorite of all patriotic boys, "Sink or swim, live\r\nor die, survive or perish; I give my hand and my heart to this vote."\r\nAt its close, "it is my living sentiment, and, by the blessing of God,\r\nit shall be my dying sentiment; independence now, and independence\r\nforever."\r\n\r\n[Literary Selections]\r\n\r\nFrom the essayists there was Lamb\'s "Eulogy on Candle Light;" that\r\ndelightful "Eulogy on Debt" from an unknown author; Addison\'s "Allegory\r\non Discontent," and "Westminster Abbey;" and Jane Taylor\'s "Discontented\r\nPendulum." Only seven selections were taken from the Bible; but one of\r\nthese was Paul\'s Defense before Agrippa. There were, however, quite a\r\nnumber of articles of strongly religious tendency, like Dr. Spring\'s\r\n"Observance of the Sabbath."\r\n\r\nThe book contained two hundred and thirty-five selections and of this\r\nnumber nearly one-half appeared in all subsequent revisions.\r\n\r\nThis Rhetorical Guide or Fifth Reader is the book that by its careful\r\nselection of specimens of the best English literature in prose and verse\r\ncontributed most to the training of its readers toward the appreciation\r\nof true beauty in literature. It contained many pieces of solid and\r\ncontinuous worth,--many that relate closely to the great historical eras\r\nof the United States.\r\n\r\n[McGuffey\'s Ancestry]\r\n\r\nIn the latest revision of the highest reader, made in 1879, one hundred\r\nand thirty-eight selections composed the book. Of this number sixty-one\r\nwere in the original book as prepared by Mr. A.H. McGuffey.\r\n\r\nIt was an admirable collection of much material that is still prized and\r\nwhich, when carefully read by pupils hungry for thoughtful language,\r\nmade a deep and lasting impression. In many cases the inmost thought of\r\nthe author may not have been at once fully apprehended by the young\r\nreaders; but with advancing years and wider experience in life the\r\nstored words became instinct with thought and feeling.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AUTHORS.\r\n\r\nDr. William Holmes McGuffey was born September 28, 1800, on the southern\r\nborder of Washington county, Pa. The family descended from William\r\nand Anna (McKittrick) McGuffey who came from Scotland, and landed at\r\nPhiladelphia. They made a home in the southern part of York county,\r\nat which, during the Revolution, General Washington often stopped to\r\nrefresh himself. In 1789 this family removed to Washington county, Pa.\r\n\r\n[The Indian Scouts]\r\n\r\nAlexander McGuffey, the father of Dr. McGuffey, was six years old when\r\nthe family came to America in August, 1774. In 1790, when he was\r\ntwenty-two years of age, he and his friend, Duncan McArthur, afterward a\r\ngovernor of Ohio, were selected from five young men who volunteered to\r\nact as scouts against the Indians in Ohio who were then threatening the\r\nfrontier settlements in the western part of Virginia and Pennsylvania.\r\nThese two young men were selected after tests by Samuel Brady to find\r\nwhich could run the fastest, shoot most accurately, and were least\r\nafraid of Indians. Alexander McGuffey served in the army three years,\r\nventuring his life with small bodies of scouts in the Indian country.\r\nHe took part in several fights with the Indians. When General St. Clair\r\nin 1792 marched north from Cincinnati to meet the Indians, this body of\r\nscouts was one day concealed in a swamp near the spring of Castalia,\r\nOhio. There they saw great numbers of Indians passing to meet General\r\nSt. Clair, and three of the scouts hastened through the Indian country\r\nto inform the general. They traveled only at night and hid during the\r\nday. One night they marched forty miles. They told General St. Clair\r\nwhat they had seen and again went out to watch the collecting Indians.\r\nThree days later St. Clair was defeated. These scouts were then twelve\r\nmiles away but the retreating soldiers soon overtook them and then the\r\n"woods were alive with Indians." The scouts turned eastward and in due\r\ntime reached Logstown, near Wheeling.\r\n\r\n[Indian Warfare]\r\n\r\nThe next year McArthur, McGuffey and George Sutherland were again sent\r\nout by General Wayne to spy the Indians. When only seven or eight miles\r\nfrom Wheeling and west of the Ohio river, they came upon a trail which\r\nled to a deer lick. Just at dusk McGuffey, who was leading the party,\r\nsaw in the path the gaily decorated head-dress of an Indian. It had been\r\nplaced there by the Indians who were in ambush close by and were ready\r\nto shoot any white man who should stop to pick it up. McGuffey saw\r\nthrough the stratagem instantly; without halting, he gave it a kick and\r\nshouted "Indians!" Several Indians fired at once and one of the balls\r\nsmashed McGuffey\'s powder horn, and passed through his clothing, but did\r\nnot wound him. The three scouts retreated in safety, and the Indians did\r\nnot follow them.\r\n\r\nThe wars with the Indians in that region closed in 1794, and Alexander\r\nMcGuffey then married Anna Holmes, of Washington county, and became a\r\nsettler. His eldest son was William Holmes McGuffey. When this son was\r\nbut two years old the family moved to Trumbull county, Ohio. Here, in\r\nthe care of a pious mother and father, he spent the years of childhood\r\nand of early manhood, performing the labors falling upon the eldest son\r\nin a large family of children dwelling in a log cabin on the frontier.\r\nFrom the heavy forest, fields were cleared, fenced and cultivated, roads\r\nwere made and bridges were built, and in all these labors the sturdy son\r\nof the famous Indian scout took part.\r\n\r\n[A Frontier School]\r\n\r\nDuring the first eighteen years of W.H. McGuffey\'s life he had no\r\nopportunities for education other than those afforded by the brief\r\nwinter schools supported by the voluntary subscriptions of the parents\r\nin the neighborhood.\r\n\r\nIn 1802 Rev. Thos. Hughes, a Presbyterian clergyman, built at\r\nDarlington, Pa., the "Old Stone Academy" for the education of young men,\r\nhaving obtained the necessary funds by traveling on horseback throughout\r\nPennsylvania and eastward even to Newburyport, Mass.\r\n\r\nThis seminary of learning was conducted on lines of the utmost economy\r\nto meet the needs of the boys living on the frontier. The tuition was\r\nonly three dollars a year and the charge for board was seventy-five\r\ncents a week. The food was simple. For breakfast, bread, butter, and\r\ncoffee; for dinner, bread, meat, and sauce; for supper, bread and milk.\r\nThe only variation allowed in this bill of fare was the occasional\r\nomission of sauce or coffee.\r\n\r\n[The Old Stone Academy]\r\n\r\nAt the close of a summer day in 1818, Thomas Hughes was riding horseback\r\nthrough Trumbull county. The dust on the highway deadened the sound of\r\nhis horse\'s feet. While passing a log cabin, half hidden from the road\r\nby intervening trees and shrubs, he heard the plaintive voice of a woman\r\nwho was in the garden, out of sight. The clergyman stopped his horse and\r\nlistened. He heard the woman earnestly praying that some way might be\r\nopened for her children to obtain such education as should fit them for\r\nthe duties of life. Riding on, the clergyman inquired at the next house\r\nregarding the inmates of the log cabin. He was informed that a Mr.\r\nMcGuffey lived there. Turning back he sought the prayerful mother and\r\nlearned from her the circumstances of the family. The doors of the "Old\r\nStone Academy" were opened to William H. McGuffey and he there obtained\r\nhis first start in a preparation for college. But his labor could not be\r\nwholly spared on the farm so lately won from the surrounding forest. He\r\nworked in the fields in summer, continuing his studies and walked many\r\nmiles once a week to recite his lessons to a kindly clergyman.\r\n\r\nW.H. McGuffey\'s father was too poor to aid his son in obtaining a\r\ncollegiate education, and the latter soon turned to teaching as a means\r\nof obtaining money to support himself in college. When prepared for\r\ncollege he went back to his native county and entered Washington\r\nCollege. He was in his twenty-sixth year when he graduated with\r\ndistinguished honors from that institution.\r\n\r\nIt was at Washington College that W.H. McGuffey first met with a great\r\nteacher and former of character,--Dr. Andrew Wylie, then the president.\r\nIt was considered by Dr. McGuffey one of the most fortunate events of\r\nhis life that he came at that time under the influence of Dr. Wylie\'s\r\nforceful mind and elevated character.\r\n\r\n[A College Professor]\r\n\r\nDr. McGuffey was obliged to suspend his collegiate course for a year to\r\nearn more money for his support. He taught a private school at Paris,\r\nKy., in 1823 and 1824. There he met Dr. Robert H. Bishop, the president\r\nof Miami University at Oxford, Ohio. Dr. Bishop was so impressed with\r\nthe character and mental power of the young teacher that on March 29,\r\n1826, even before McGuffey received his bachelor\'s degree from\r\nWashington College, he received his appointment as professor of Ancient\r\nLanguages at Miami University.\r\n\r\nHe graduated in 1826 and began his labor at Oxford, Ohio, at the opening\r\nof the fall session. He at once took high rank in a faculty consisting\r\nof strong men, and, young as he was, won the respect and homage of the\r\nstudents. In 1832 he was transferred to the chair of Mental Philosophy.\r\nTo make this subject interesting and valuable to beginners requires, on\r\nthe part of the teacher, wide reading, clearness of thought, and\r\nsimplicity and directness of speech. These qualities Dr. McGuffey had.\r\nHe had become well read in philosophy, especially of the Scottish\r\nschool, Brown being his favorite author. But he had fully assimilated\r\nthe matter and had thought independently. He also had a fund of fresh\r\nand suggestive illustrations coming within the daily experience of men,\r\nwhich brought his lectures close to the minds of the students. Whatever\r\npositions of honor or of trust his pupils held in their later careers,\r\nthey never ceased to feel the impulse which came from Dr. McGuffey as a\r\nteacher.\r\n\r\nOn March 29, 1829, he was licensed as a preacher in the Presbyterian\r\nchurch, and from that date he became a frequent public speaker. He never\r\nhad charge of a parish as minister, but usually preached on Sunday in\r\nthe college chapel to the students and to such of the public as could\r\nobtain space to sit or to stand. The preacher\'s unassuming manner, the\r\nclearness of his thought, and the simplicity of his language produced\r\nimpressions that were enduring. He never wrote his sermons. He simply\r\nthought them out rigorously, and his mind worked so logically and in\r\nsuch definite lines that he could repeat on request a sermon, preached\r\nyears before, in a form recognized by his hearers as substantially the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\n[Cincinnati College]\r\n\r\nAfter ten years spent in teaching and preaching at Miami University, Dr.\r\nMcGuffey resigned, August 26, 1836, and accepted the presidency of\r\nCincinnati College.\r\n\r\nThis institution was chartered in the winter of 1818-1819 by the\r\nlegislature of Ohio, largely at the solicitation of Dr. Daniel Drake. It\r\nwas partially endowed by the gifts of the public-spirited citizens of\r\nCincinnati. But its collegiate functions had been allowed to drop,\r\nalthough a school on the Lancastrian system was maintained.\r\n\r\nThe election of Dr. McGuffey as president of this college was a result\r\nof renewed activity on the part of the leading men in the city to found\r\na genuine college of high character in that city. They believed that if\r\nwell conducted such an institution would bring to its doors students\r\nenough to support the college by their fees.\r\n\r\nA medical department was organized in June, 1835, with eight competent\r\nprofessors, a law department with three professors, and a faculty of\r\narts with seven teachers. In this faculty, William H. McGuffey was\r\npresident and professor of Moral and Intellectual Philosophy, O.M.\r\nMitchell was professor of Mathematics and Astronomy, and Edward D.\r\nMansfield was professor of Constitutional Law and History. Dr. McGuffey\r\naccepted the presidency with a full knowledge that the work was\r\nexperimental. A trial of three years demonstrated that a college could\r\nnot be sustained without an invested endowment. Cincinnati College "was\r\nendowed with genius, and nothing else."\r\n\r\n[Ohio University]\r\n\r\nIn 1839, Dr. McGuffey accepted the presidency of the Ohio University at\r\nAthens, Ohio, which office he held for four years. During these years\r\nhis faculties were at their fullest development. He had become an\r\nexperienced, scholarly teacher and a popular speaker on religious and\r\neducational subjects. The students at Athens held him in the highest\r\nesteem, and the influence of his teaching became deeper as years rolled\r\nby and experience emphasized his lessons.\r\n\r\nIn 1839 he was honored with the degree of Doctor of Laws conferred upon\r\nhim by the Indiana University, of which his former teacher and friend,\r\nDr. Wylie, was then president.\r\n\r\nThe income of the Ohio University came chiefly from the rents of two\r\nentire townships of land which had been given it for an endowment. This\r\nland was lawfully revalued at the end of ten years. The revaluation was\r\ncontested in the courts by the tenants. The Supreme Court decided in\r\nfavor of the university; but the farmers induced the legislature in 1843\r\nto pass a law which fixed the income of the university from these lands\r\nat a sum so low as to cause the doors of the institution to be closed\r\nfor five years.\r\n\r\nDr. McGuffey returned to Cincinnati and was for two years a professor in\r\nWoodward College, now Woodward High School.\r\n\r\n[University of Virginia]\r\n\r\nIn 1845 he was appointed professor of Natural and Moral Philosophy in\r\nthe University of Virginia. This position he filled with credit to\r\nhimself and with great acceptance to the students in that institution\r\nfor more than a quarter of a century and until his death on May 4, 1873.\r\n\r\nDr. McGuffey\'s classes in the University of Virginia were well attended.\r\nHis lectures were delivered extempore, in language exactly expressing\r\nhis thoughts. His illustrations were most apt. He taught "with the\r\nsimplicity of a child, with the precision of a mathematician, and with\r\nthe authority of truth."\r\n\r\n[Method of Teaching]\r\n\r\nA portion of the lecture hour was given to questioning the members of\r\nthe class. In this he used the Socratic method, leading the pupil by a\r\nseries of questions to the discovery of the incorrectness of his\r\nreasoning or the falsity of his grounds. By this process the students\r\nwere led to question their own reasoning, to think clearly and to\r\nexpress their thoughts accurately.\r\n\r\nDr. McGuffey once told a pupil that he had preached three thousand\r\nsermons and had never written one. Until late in life he had never\r\nwritten his lectures. Shortly before his death he began the preparation\r\nof a book on Mental Philosophy. This was never completed.\r\n\r\nDr. McGuffey was twice married. By his first wife. Miss Harriet Spinning\r\nof Dayton, he had several children. One daughter, Mary, married Dr.\r\nWilliam W. Stewart of Dayton; another, Henrietta, married Professor A.\r\nD. Hepburn who was for a time president of Miami University. Professor\r\nHepburn\'s son, in turn inheriting his grandfather\'s faculty of teaching,\r\nis a professor in the University of Indiana.\r\n\r\n[Interest in Public Schools]\r\n\r\nIn 1837 Professor Calvin E. Stowe went to Europe to investigate the\r\norganization and method of elementary schools. On his return he\r\npublished, in 1838, his report on the Prussian system. Subsequently Dr.\r\nMcGuffey labored in Ohio with Samuel Lewis and other public-spirited men\r\nfor the passage of the general school law under which the common schools\r\nof Ohio were first organized. He carried to Virginia the same zeal for\r\nthe education of all the children of the state to prepare them for the\r\nduties of life. One of his first acts on assuming the duties of his\r\nprofessorship in the university was to make a tour of the state\r\nadvocating the introduction of a public school system in Virginia.\r\nTo this first appeal for common schools, open alike to rich and poor,\r\nthere was then but a feeble response; but, twenty-five years later, Dr.\r\nMcGuffey had the satisfaction of seeing the public schools organized\r\nwith one of his own friends and a former pupil at its head,--Hon. W.H.\r\nRuffner.\r\n\r\nDr. McGuffey was a man of medium stature and compact figure. His\r\nforehead was broad and full; his eyes clear and expressive. His features\r\nwere of the strongly marked rugged Scotch type. He was a ready speaker,\r\na popular lecturer on educational topics, and an able preacher. He was\r\nadmirable in conversation. His observation of men was accurate, and his\r\nstudy of character close.\r\n\r\n[Trip Through the South]\r\n\r\nAfter the Civil War and while the reconstruction was in progress it\r\nwas extremely difficult in the North to obtain a correct view of the\r\nsituation in the South. State governments had been established in which\r\n"carpet-baggers" had more or less control. Nearly all the whites in the\r\nSouth had taken part in the war. They were largely disfranchised and\r\ntheir former servants often became the legal rulers. The Klu Klux Klan\r\nhad begun their unlawful work, of which the papers gave contradictory\r\nreports.\r\n\r\nAs business men, the publishers of McGuffey\'s Readers desired to learn\r\nthe truth about the situation of the South and its probable future.\r\nThey asked Dr. McGuffey to take a trip through the Carolinas, Georgia,\r\nAlabama, and Mississippi and make report to them at Cincinnati. This he\r\ndid, visiting all the larger towns where he was usually the honored\r\nguest of some graduate of the university. He saw the legislatures in\r\nsession, met the governors, and studied the whole situation. He then\r\ncame to Cincinnati and told his story. He had made no notes, but he\r\nnever hesitated for a name. He repeated conversations with unquestioned\r\naccuracy and described with humor the gross ignorance and brutality of\r\nsome of the southern legislators, the looting of the capitol at the end\r\nof the session, the indirect robbery that was under way, the reversal of\r\nall the conditions of life, and the growing unrest of the men who had\r\nheretofore been the rulers.\r\n\r\nIt was such a picture as at that time no Northern paper would have dared\r\nto print--it was the truth. For days he held his listeners captive with\r\nthe story--the writer never heard a more interesting one.\r\n\r\n[College of Teachers]\r\n\r\nWhile Dr. McGuffey was still at Oxford, Ohio, he took part in the\r\nformation of probably the first extended Teachers\' Association formed in\r\nthe West. There had been a previous association of Cincinnati teachers\r\norganized for mutual aid and improvement. This was about to be given\r\nup; but at their first anniversary on June 20, 1831, Mr. Albert Pickett,\r\nprincipal of a private school in Cincinnati, proposed a plan for\r\norganizing in one body the instructors in public and private schools and\r\nthe friends of education. Circulars were sent out and the first meeting\r\nof the College of Teachers was held October 3, 1832. A great number of\r\nteachers from many states of the West and South attended these meetings\r\nand took part in the proceedings. Throughout its continuance Dr.\r\nMcGuffey took an active part in the work. In the years 1832-1836\r\nfifty-seven addresses were delivered to the College by thirty-nine\r\nspeakers. Of this number Dr. McGuffey prepared and delivered three.\r\n\r\n[Topics Discussed]\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of the College of Teachers were published in annual\r\npamphlets which together formed two large octavo volumes. The topics\r\nwhich were then under discussion are best shown by the titles of a few\r\nof the addresses, with the name of the speaker and the year of delivery:\r\n\r\nOn Introducing the Bible into Schools, Rev. B.P. Aydelott, 1836;\r\nImportance of making the business of Teaching a Profession, Lyman\r\nBeecher, D.D., 1833; The Kind of Education Adapted to the West,\r\nProfessor Bradford, 1833; Qualifications of Teachers, Mr. Mann Butler,\r\n1832; Physical Education, Dr. Daniel Drake, 1833; On Popular Education,\r\nJohn P. Harrison, M.D., 1836; On the Study and Nature of Ancient\r\nLanguages, A. Kinmont, 1832; On Common Schools, Samuel Lewis, Esq.,\r\n1835; On the Qualifications of Teachers, E.D. Mansfield, Esq., 1836;\r\nReciprocal Duties of Parents and Teachers, Rev. W.H. McGuffey, A.M.,\r\n1835; General Duties of Teachers, Albert Pickett, 1835; Philosophy of\r\nthe Human Mind, Bishop Purcell, 1836; Utility of Cabinets of Natural\r\nScience, Joseph Ray, 1836; Agriculture as a Branch of Education, Rev. E.\r\nSlack, 1836; Education of Emigrants, Professor Calvin Stowe, 1835; Best\r\nMethod of Teaching Composition, D.L. Talbott, 1835; Manual Labor in the\r\nSchools, Milo G. Williams.\r\n\r\nSome of these topics are still engrossing the attention of teachers at\r\ntheir annual meetings for the discussion of live educational questions.\r\n\r\nWhile Dr. McGuffey was at Oxford, teaching mental philosophy to the\r\npupils in Miami University, he prepared the manuscript for the two lower\r\nreaders of the graded series which bore his name. To test his work while\r\nin progress, he collected in his own house a number of small children\r\nwhom he taught to read by the use of his lessons.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that these readers were prepared at the solicitation of\r\nthe publishers and on such a general plan as to number and size as was\r\ndesired by the publishers. Dr. McGuffey was selected by them as the most\r\ncompetent teacher known to them for the preparation of successful books.\r\nHe did not prepare the manuscripts and search for a publisher.\r\n\r\n[The Copyright Contract]\r\n\r\nOn April 28, 1836, he made a contract with Truman & Smith, publishers of\r\nCincinnati, for the preparation and publication of a graded series of\r\nreaders to consist of four books. The First and Second readers were then\r\nin manuscript, the Third and Fourth readers were to be completed within\r\neighteen months. They were both issued in 1837. Dr. Benjamin Chidlaw,\r\nthen a student in college, aided the author by copying the indicated\r\nselections and preparing them for the printer. He received for this work\r\nfive dollars and thought himself well paid.\r\n\r\nThese four books constituted the original series of the Eclectic Readers\r\nby W.H. McGuffey which in all the subsequent revisions have borne his\r\nname and retained the impress of his mind.\r\n\r\nThe First Reader made a thin 18mo book of seventy-two pages, having\r\ngreen paper covered sides; the Second Reader contained one hundred and\r\nsixty-four pages of the same size. The Third Reader had a larger page\r\nand was printed as a duodecimo of one hundred and sixty-five pages. The\r\nfourth Reader ranked in size with the Third and contained three hundred\r\nand twenty-four printed pages. Each was printed from the type, which was\r\ndistributed when the required number for the edition came from the\r\npress.\r\n\r\nBy the terms of the contract the publishers paid a royalty of ten per\r\ncent on all copies sold until the copyright should reach the sum of one\r\nthousand dollars, after which the Readers became the absolute property\r\nof the publishers. It must be remembered that in those days this sum of\r\nmoney seemed much larger than it would at the present time, and it may\r\nbe questioned whether this newly organized firm of publishers commanded\r\nas much as a thousand dollars in their entire business. At any rate\r\nthe contract was mutually satisfactory and remained so to the end of\r\nthe author\'s life. Right here it seems proper to remark that although\r\nthe McGuffey readers became the property of the publishers when the\r\nroyalties reached one thousand dollars. Dr. McGuffey was employed by the\r\npublishers in connection with important revisions so long as he lived\r\nand the contracts specify a "satisfactory consideration" in each case.\r\n\r\n[Later Contracts]\r\n\r\nWhen, after the Civil War, these readers attained a sale which became\r\nvery profitable to the firm then owning the copyrights, the partners,\r\nwithout suggestion or solicitation, fixed upon an annuity which was paid\r\nDr. McGuffey each year so long as he lived. This was a voluntary\r\nrecognition of their esteem for the man and of the continued value of\r\nhis work.\r\n\r\n[The Beecher Family]\r\n\r\nBefore Dr. McGuffey completed the manuscripts of the Third and Fourth\r\nreaders he left Oxford and went to Cincinnati. Here he found himself in\r\nclose touch with a community fully alive to the claims of education.\r\nCincinnati, in 1837, was the largest city in the West excepting New\r\nOrleans and was the great educational center of the West. The early\r\nsettlers of Cincinnati were generally well educated men and they had a\r\nkeen sense of the value of learning. The public schools of Cincinnati\r\nwere then more highly developed than those of any other city in the\r\nWest. Woodward High School had been endowed and Dr. Joseph Ray, the\r\nauthor of the well known arithmetics, was the professor of mathematics\r\nthere. The Cincinnati College was then bright with the promise of future\r\nusefulness. Lane Seminary was founded and Dr. Lyman Beecher was inducted\r\nprofessor of Theology on December 26, 1832, and became the first\r\npresident. He went to Cincinnati with his brilliant family. His eldest\r\ndaughter, Catherine, had already won a high reputation as a teacher,\r\nacting as principal of the Hartford (Conn.) Female Institute. His\r\nyounger daughter, Harriet, married, in January, 1836, Calvin E. Stowe,\r\nthen one of the professors in Lane Seminary. It was while in Cincinnati\r\nthat she gathered material and formed opinions which she later embodied\r\nin "Uncle Tom\'s Cabin." In 1834 Henry Ward Beecher graduated at Amherst\r\nCollege. He and his brother, Charles, then went to Cincinnati to study\r\ntheology under their father. While pursuing his studies Henry Ward\r\nBeecher devoted his surplus energies to editorial work on the Cincinnati\r\nDaily Journal. These were some of the people of Cincinnati interested in\r\nthe problem of education who took part with Dr. McGuffey in the\r\ndiscussions of the College of Teachers and labored zealously for the\r\npromotion of education in every department. While president of Lane\r\nSeminary. Dr. Beecher was also the pastor of the Second Presbyterian\r\nChurch in Cincinnati where W.B. Smith was an attendant.\r\n\r\n[Alexander H. McGuffey]\r\n\r\nDr. McGuffey left Cincinnati in 1839, and when the publisher, Mr.\r\nWinthrop B. Smith, found it necessary to add to the four McGuffey\'s\r\nReaders another more advanced book, he employed for its preparation, Mr.\r\nAlexander H. McGuffey, a younger brother of Dr. McGuffey. Mr. Alexander\r\nH. McGuffey had, in 1837, prepared for Messrs. Truman & Smith the\r\nmanuscript of McGuffey\'s Eclectic Spelling Book, and although the nature\r\nof this task was very different from the preparation of a reader for the\r\nhighest grades in the elementary schools, the result showed that the\r\npublishers judged wisely in selecting a man competent to prepare a\r\nselection from English literature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ALEXANDER H. McGUFFEY]\r\n\r\nMr. Alexander Hamilton McGuffey was born August 13, 1816, in Trumbull\r\nCounty, Ohio. He was sixteen years younger than his brother, William,\r\nand when only ten years of age was placed under charge of his brother\r\nat Oxford, Ohio. There he studied Hebrew before he had any knowledge\r\nof the grammar of his mother tongue. He was a brilliant student, and\r\nhe graduated from Miami University at the age of sixteen. Soon after\r\ngraduation he was appointed Professor of Belles Lettres at Woodward\r\nCollege. In this field of labor his knowledge of English literature was\r\nbroadened and he acquired a love for the classic English writers that\r\nlasted through life. But Mr. McGuffey determined to become a lawyer and,\r\nwhile still teaching English literature in Woodward College, he read\r\nlaw. He was admitted to the bar as soon as he reached his twenty-first\r\nyear, and became a noted and wise counsellor. His labor for his clients\r\nwas in keeping them out of the courts by clearly expressed contracts and\r\nprudent action. He was seldom engaged in jury trials; but was expert in\r\ncases involving contracts and wills. In such suits his knowledge of the\r\nprinciples of law and his power of close reasoning were valuable. He was\r\noften placed in positions of trust, and was for more than fifty years\r\nthe watchful guardian of the interests of the Cincinnati College.\r\n\r\n[The Rhetorical Guide]\r\n\r\nHe prepared the manuscript of the Rhetorical Guide after the close of\r\nhis labor as a teacher. The work probably occupied his leisure time in a\r\nlaw office before he acquired remunerative practice in his profession.\r\n\r\n[McGuffey\'s Sixth Reader]\r\n\r\nThe contract between Mr. A.H. McGuffey and W.B. Smith, dated September\r\n30, 1841, provided for the preparation within eighteen months, of the\r\nmanuscript of a book to be called McGuffey\'s Rhetorical Reader, or by\r\nany other appropriate name which Mr. Smith might select. It was to\r\ncontain not less than three hundred and twenty-four duodecimo pages nor\r\nmore than four hundred and eighty. Mr. Smith paid five hundred dollars\r\nfor it, in three notes payable in three, twelve, and eighteen months\r\nafter the delivery of the manuscript. The book was issued in 1844 as\r\nMcGuffey\'s Rhetorical Guide. Its material, revised by its author, later\r\nbecame, in modified form, the Fifth Reader in the five-book series, and\r\nagain much of the same material was used in the Sixth Reader published\r\nfirst in 1855.\r\n\r\nMr. A.H. McGuffey died at his home on Mt. Auburn, Cincinnati, on June 3,\r\n1896. He was twice married. His first wife, married in 1839, was Miss\r\nElizabeth M. Drake, daughter of the eminent Dr. Daniel Drake. After her\r\ndeath he married Miss Caroline V. Rich of Boston. He had a large family.\r\nA son, Charles D. McGuffey. Esq., lives at Chattanooga, Tenn.\r\n\r\nMr. A.H. McGuffey was a noteworthy figure in any assemblage of men. He\r\nwas tall, slender and erect. His manner was urbane and reserved. He\r\nserved on many charitable and educational boards and was attentive to\r\nhis trusts. He was an active member of the Episcopalian Church, being\r\nmany years a warden in his parish, and frequently a delegate to the\r\nDiocesan Convention, where he was a recognized authority on\r\nEcclesiastical Law.\r\n\r\nIn a life of nearly eighty years in which he was active in many\r\neducational and beneficent enterprises his early work in the preparation\r\nof the Rhetorical Guide probably exercised the widest, the best, and\r\nthe most enduring influence. Many of the newspapers in all parts of the\r\ncountry published notices of his death, recognizing in kindly terms the\r\nservice that had been rendered the writers by the schoolbook of which he\r\nwas the author.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PUBLISHERS AND EDITORS.\r\n\r\nSince the McGuffey Readers became at an early day the absolute property\r\nof their publishers, they became responsible for all subsequent\r\nrevisions and corrections of the books.\r\n\r\n[Truman & Smith]\r\n\r\nThe firm of Truman & Smith was organized about 1834 by William B. Truman\r\nand Winthrop B. Smith. Both had had some experience in the business of\r\nselling books. It is highly probable that this firm became for a short\r\ntime the Western agent for some schoolbooks made in the East. But Mr.\r\nSmith soon perceived a distinct demand for a series adapted to the\r\nWestern market and supplied near at hand. He had the courage to follow\r\nhis convictions.\r\n\r\nMr. Winthrop B. Smith was born in Stamford, Conn., September 28, 1808,\r\nthe son of Anthony and Rebecca (Clarke) Smith. He was, in his youth, an\r\nemployee in a book-house in New Haven. At the age of eighteen he went to\r\nCincinnati, declaring that he would not return to his home until he was\r\nindependent. He labored there fourteen years before he returned, not\r\nrich, but established in an independent career. He often declared that\r\nuntil 1840, he was "insolvent, but no one knew it."\r\n\r\nBefore entering business, Mr. Smith received a sound common school\r\neducation. This, grounded on a nature well endowed with common sense,\r\ngreat energy, and strong determination, qualified him for success in\r\nbusiness. He became a man of great originality, clear-headed and\r\nfar-sighted. Toward his employees he was just, but exacting. He was a\r\ngood judge of the character and qualities of other men, and was thus\r\nable to bring to his aid competent assistants who were loyal and\r\neffective.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith married in Cincinnati on November 4th, 1834, Mary Sargent. He\r\ndied in Philadelphia, December 5th, 1885, in his 78th year. Of his\r\nfamily, one son is a banker in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n[Their First Publications]\r\n\r\nThe firm of Truman & Smith published several miscellaneous books, mostly\r\nreprints of standard works likely to have a steady sale. Their first\r\nventure in a copyrighted book was "The Child\'s Bible with Plates; by a\r\nlady of Cincinnati," which was entered on June 2, 1834. On June 21st of\r\nthe same year the firm entered the titles of three books: "Mason\'s\r\nSacred Harp," a collection of church music by Lowell Mason of Boston,\r\nand Timothy B. Mason of Cincinnati; "Introduction to Ray\'s Eclectic\r\nArithmetic," by Dr. Joseph Ray; and "English Grammar on the Productive\r\nSystem," by Roswell C. Smith. Of these four books the arithmetic was\r\nissued on July 4, 1834. It was the firm\'s first schoolbook. In revised\r\nand enlarged form it later became the first book in the successful\r\nseries of "Ray\'s Arithmetics."\r\n\r\nBut even in those early days, books would not sell themselves unless\r\ntheir qualities were made known to the public. Agents had to be\r\nemployed--and at first Mr. Smith was his own best agent. There were\r\nexpenses for travel and for sample books, for advertising, as well as\r\nfor printing and binding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: W.B. Smith]\r\n\r\nThe Truman and Smith team did not always pull together. Mr. Truman was\r\nnot versed in the schoolbook business. Mr. Smith was.\r\n\r\n[The Dissolution]\r\n\r\nIt is said that Mr. Smith went early one morning to their humble shop on\r\nthe second floor of No. 150 Main street, and made two piles of sample\r\nbooks. In one he put all the miscellaneous publications of the firm, big\r\nand little--the Child\'s Bible and Sacred Harp among them--and on top of\r\nthe pile placed all the cash the firm possessed; in the other, were half\r\na dozen small text books, including the four McGuffey Readers. When\r\nMr. Truman arrived, Mr. Smith expressed the desire to dissolve the\r\npartnership, showed the two piles and offered Mr. Truman his choice.\r\nHe pounced on the cash and the larger pile and left the insignificant\r\nschoolbooks for Mr. Smith, who thereupon became the sole owner of\r\nMcGuffey\'s Readers.\r\n\r\nThis separation of the partnership took place in 1841 and although there\r\nis no documentary evidence of the exact method in which it was brought\r\nabout, the division of assets was in accord with the spirit of the\r\nincident as handed down by tradition.\r\n\r\n[A Lesson in Copyright Law]\r\n\r\nMr. Truman\'s apparent disgust with the schoolbook business may have\r\ncome in part from a lawsuit in which his firm was made a defendant.\r\nSooner or later, publishers are quite likely to obtain some elementary\r\ninstructions as to the meaning and intent of the copyright law through\r\naction taken in court. Messrs. Truman & Smith took a lesson in 1838.\r\n\r\nOn October 1st of that year Benjamin F. Copeland and Samuel Worcester\r\nbrought suit in the court of the United States against Truman & Smith\r\nand William H. McGuffey for infringement of copyright, alleging that\r\nmaterial had been copied from Worcester\'s Second, Third, and Fourth\r\nReaders and that even the plan of the two latter readers had been\r\npirated.\r\n\r\nA temporary injunction was issued December 25, 1838; but before that\r\ndate the McGuffey Readers had been carefully compared with the Worcester\r\nReaders and every selection was removed that seemed in the slightest\r\ndegree an invasion of the previous copyright of the Worcester Readers.\r\nAs these McGuffey books were still not stereotyped, it cost no more to\r\nset up new matter than to reset the old. On the title page of each book\r\nappeared the words, "Revised and Improved Edition," and two pages in\r\nexplanation and defense were inserted. In these the publishers stated\r\nthat certain compilers of schoolbooks, in New England, felt themselves\r\naggrieved that the McGuffey books contained a portion of matter similar\r\nto their own which was considered common property, and had instituted\r\nlegal proceedings against them with a view to the immediate suppression\r\nof the McGuffey books and in the meantime had provided supplies of the\r\nWorcester books to meet the demand of the West.\r\n\r\n[Avoidance of Issue]\r\n\r\nNo objection was raised to meeting these compilers on their own grounds;\r\nbut for both parties there was another tribunal than the law. "The\r\npublic never choose schoolbooks to please compilers." They stated that\r\nto place themselves entirely in the right and remove every cause for\r\ncavil or complaint they had expunged everything claimed as original, and\r\nsubstituted other matter, which, both for its fitness and variety would\r\nadd to the value of the Eclectic Readers. Throughout this preface, after\r\nstating the facts regarding the suit, there was a strong claim for the\r\nsupport of Western enterprise.\r\n\r\nAlthough in this appeal the publishers stated that the correspondences\r\nbetween the two series were "few and immaterial," a careful comparison\r\nof the early edition of the Second Reader with the "Revised and Improved\r\nEdition" shows that Mr. Smith took out seventeen selections and inserted\r\nin their places new matter. To an unprejudiced examiner it appears\r\nthat the new matter was better than the old. The old marked copy of\r\nWorcester\'s Second Reader, preserved for all these years, shows ten\r\npieces that were used in both books. It thus appears that the publisher\r\ntook this opportunity to improve the books as well as to make them\r\nunassailable under the copyright law. In three months between the\r\nbringing of the suit and the granting of an injunction, Mr. Smith had\r\nmade his improved edition safe and rendered the injunction practically\r\nvoid.\r\n\r\n[The Suit Settled]\r\n\r\nThe court proceeded in the usual manner and appointed a master to\r\nexamine the books and make report to ascertain what damage had been\r\ninflicted on the owners of the Worcester Readers. But Mr. Smith was an\r\nattendant in church and doubtless had heard Dr. Beecher read, "Agree\r\nwith thine adversary quickly while thou art in the way with him, lest at\r\nany time the adversary deliver thee to the judge, and the judge deliver\r\nthee to the officer, and thou be cast into prison," and he had no desire\r\nto remain there until he had "paid the uttermost farthing."\r\n\r\nWhen the master, in the leisurely execution of his duty, made his report\r\nnearly two years later, the court found that the defendants had removed\r\nfrom their books the pirated parts and that the suit had been settled by\r\npaying the plaintiffs two thousand dollars. There was no further contest\r\nabout the plan of the two books.\r\n\r\nThe Worcester Readers had a short and inconspicuous life. When this suit\r\nwas brought, their publishers were Richardson, Lord and Holbrook of\r\nBoston. In 1836 Charles J. Hendee published them, and in 1854 they\r\nappeared with the name of Jenks, Hickling & Swan of Boston. These\r\nseveral publishers were probably gobbled up by some imaginary Book Trust\r\nsixty years ago.\r\n\r\nDr. McGuffey undoubtedly inserted these selections innocent of any wrong\r\nintent and supposed them to be in common use.\r\n\r\n[Early Popular Schoolbooks]\r\n\r\nAs early as 1848 the success of the Eclectic Readers was sufficient to\r\nexcite imitation and in the First Reader of that year Mr. Smith printed\r\nfour preliminary pages warning his patrons not to be deceived by\r\n"Newman\'s Southern Eclectic Readers."\r\n\r\nIn the first century after the settlement of this country the New\r\nEngland Primer had a history which in some respects resembles that of\r\nthe McGuffey Readers. In that case, the settlers were widely removed\r\nfrom the source of supply which had in past years served their needs.\r\nThe Primer was strongly religious and fully in accord with the faith of\r\nthe people. It served as a first book in reading and was followed by the\r\nBible. This Primer was not protected by copyright and any enterprising\r\nbookseller or printer in a remote town could manufacture an edition to\r\nsupply the local demand. The excessive cost of transportation was thus\r\navoided.\r\n\r\n[Changed Conditions]\r\n\r\nSomewhat similar causes contributed to the widespread use and\r\nlong-continued demands for Webster\'s Spelling Book, which was\r\ncopyrighted. This book had the support of the authority of Webster\'s\r\nDictionary--an original American work; and it soon became a staple\r\narticle of merchandise which was kept in stock in every country store.\r\nIt supplanted the New England Primer and became the first book in the\r\nhands of every pupil. Less marked in its religious instruction, the\r\nspeller spread through the South and into regions where the people were\r\nnot trained in the Puritan doctrines. The wonderful sales of Webster\'s\r\nSpelling Book remained for many years after the War; but have now\r\ndropped to insignificance. It is not probable that other books will\r\nunder present conditions repeat the history of these books. There is\r\nnow no wide region of fertile country rapidly filling with settlers and\r\nseparated from their former sources of supply by great distance and by\r\nmountain ranges unprovided with passable roads. Even the more newly\r\nsettled regions of the country are reached by railroads and the parts\r\nearly settled are covered by a network of railroads, of telegraph and\r\ntelephone wires which bring the consumer and the producer near together.\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of books as with most other articles, machinery has\r\ntaken the place of hand work. When W.B. Smith carried on his business in\r\nthe second story over a small shop on Main street, Cincinnati, nearly\r\nevery process in the manufacture of a book was mere hand labor. The\r\ntools employed were of the simplest character. Now a book-factory is\r\nfilled with heavy machines of the most complicated kind, which in many\r\ncases feed themselves from stocks of material placed upon them. New\r\nmachines are constantly being invented to cheapen and perfect the\r\nmanufacture. Thus a very large investment of capital is now required to\r\nset up and maintain a plant which can produce books economically and\r\nwith perfect finish in every part. Books are seldom manufactured in\r\nplaces remote from the large cities and very few of the publishers of\r\nschoolbooks make the books which they sell. They contract for them with\r\nprinters and binders.\r\n\r\n[Stereotyped Editions]\r\n\r\nThe first four editions of McGuffey\'s Readers were printed from the\r\nactual type, as all books were once printed; but before 1840 the readers\r\nwere produced from stereotyped plates. The use of such plates enabled the\r\npublisher to secure greater accuracy in the work and also enabled him to\r\npresent books that in successive editions should be exactly the same in\r\nsubstance as those already in use. Since that date electrotype plates\r\nhave displaced stereotypes, as they afford a sharper, clearer impression\r\nand endure more wear.\r\n\r\nIn a First Reader printed in the fall of 1841 there are two pages of\r\nadvertising matter in which Truman & Smith claimed to have sold 700,000\r\nof the Eclectic Series. This book is bound with board sides and a muslin\r\nback and a careful defense of this binding is made, claiming that the\r\nmuslin is "much more durable than the thin tender leather usually put\r\nupon books of this class." This statement was unquestionably true. The\r\nleather referred to was of sheepskin and of very little strength, but it\r\ntook very many years to convince the public of the untruth of the\r\nsaying, "There is nothing like leather."\r\n\r\n[Dr. Pinneo, Editor]\r\n\r\nIt is said that Mr. Smith, in the early days of his career as a\r\npublisher, himself made the changes and corrections which experience\r\nshowed were needed; but, about 1843, he employed Dr. Timothy Stone\r\nPinneo to act under his direction in literary matters.\r\n\r\n[Dr. Pinneo\'s Work]\r\n\r\nDr. Pinneo was the eldest son of the Rev. Bezaleel Pinneo, an early\r\ngraduate of Dartmouth College, who was for more than half a century\r\npastor of the First Congregational Church in Milford, Conn. Dr. Pinneo\r\nwas born at Milford in February, 1804. His mother was a woman of\r\nculture, Mary, only daughter of the Rev. Timothy Stone of Lebanon,\r\nConn., a graduate of Yale College. Dr. Pinneo graduated at Yale in the\r\nclass of 1824. A severe illness in the winter after his graduation made\r\nit necessary for him to spend his winters in the South until his health\r\nwas sufficiently restored to enable him to pursue the study of medicine.\r\nHe taught for a time in the Charlotte Hall Institute, Maryland, and\r\nthen removed to Ohio. He acted one year as professor of Mathematics\r\nand Natural Philosophy in Marietta College. He studied medicine in\r\nCincinnati and received the degree of Doctor of Medicine from the Ohio\r\nMedical College in 1843. On June 1, 1848, he married Jeanette Linsley,\r\ndaughter of Rev. Dr. Joel H. Linsley, at one time president of Marietta\r\nCollege. Dr. Pinneo was for eighteen years a resident in Cincinnati. In\r\n1862 he went to Greenwich, Conn., where he was occupied in literary work\r\nand in the conduct of a boys\' boarding school. In 1885, after his wife\'s\r\ndeath, he removed to Norwalk, Conn., where he died August 2, 1893. Two\r\ndaughters and a son survived him. Dr. Pinneo contributed materially to\r\nthe revisions of McGuffey\'s Readers made in 1843 and in 1853; but both\r\nthese revisions passed through the hands of Dr. McGuffey, then at the\r\nUniversity of Virginia, and were approved by him. It does not appear\r\nthat Dr. Pinneo exercised any personal authority over the readers. He\r\nwas employed, for moderate amounts, to prepare revisions which were\r\nsatisfactory to both publisher and author. In the revision of 1843, his\r\nwork was confined to the Third and Fourth readers. The First and Second\r\nreaders were remade by Daniel G. Mason, then a teacher in the schools of\r\nCincinnati. In the revision of 1853 the entire series passed through Dr.\r\nPinneo\'s hands. He probably corrected the proof sheets. Dr. Pinneo\'s\r\nlatest work on the McGuffey Readers was done in 1856.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Cincinnati, Dr. Pinneo prepared, and Mr. Smith published,\r\na series of grammars--the Analytical, issued in 1850, and the Primary,\r\nin 1854. He was also the author of a High School Reader and of Hemans\'s\r\nYoung Ladies\' Readers. These books had for some years a considerable\r\nsale.\r\n\r\n[Obed J. Wilson]\r\n\r\nAs early as 1853 Mr. Obed J. Wilson was in the office of Mr. Smith as\r\nan employee. Mr. Wilson was born in Bingham, Maine, in 1826, and earned\r\nhis first money as an axman in the pine forests which were in that day\r\nnear his native town. He obtained, in the common schools, sufficient\r\neducation to become a teacher and he never ceased to be a student, thus\r\nacquiring a broad acquaintance with English literature. He taught in the\r\nschools of Cincinnati when he first went West. There his abilities soon\r\nattracted the attention of Mr. Smith, who employed him. For some years\r\nhe traveled as an agent, chiefly in Indiana and Wisconsin, introducing\r\nthe books of the Eclectic Series. He gradually became Mr. Smith\'s\r\ntrusted assistant, particularly in the direction of the work of agents\r\nand in the selection of new books, and their adaptation to the demands\r\nof the field. He married Miss Amanda Landrum, who was also a skilled\r\nteacher in the Cincinnati schools. Mrs. Wilson was responsible for a\r\nrevision of the McGuffey First Reader made in 1863. She also at that\r\ntime corrected the plates of the higher numbers of the series. For many\r\nyears thereafter Mr. Wilson was the chief authority for Mr. Smith and\r\nhis successors in literary matters, and few men excelled him in breadth\r\nof reading and in discriminating taste.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson lives in his home near Cincinnati which is filled with the\r\nchoice books which he has read and studied so faithfully, and he still\r\nhas the companionship of the wife who has been his constant helpmate for\r\nmore than half a century.\r\n\r\nMr. Winthrop B. Smith was the sole proprietor of the McGuffey Readers\r\nand his other publications from 1841 until about 1852. He then admitted\r\nas partners, Edward Sargent and Daniel Bartow Sargent, his wife\'s\r\nbrothers, and the firm name became W.B. Smith & Co.\r\n\r\n[Eastern Publishers]\r\n\r\nWhile books could be manufactured in the West even in the early years\r\ncheaper than they could be delivered in the West from the better\r\norganized establishments in the older cities of the East, it was not\r\npossible to deliver books in New York from Cincinnati so cheaply as the\r\nbooks could be made in the East. The cost of transportation constituted\r\na very considerable element in the price of schoolbooks. Mr. Smith\r\ntherefore made an arrangement with Clark, Austin & Smith, of New York,\r\nto become the Eastern publishers of the McGuffey Readers and other\r\nbooks, and a duplicate set of plates was sent to New York. From these\r\nplates, editions of the readers were manufactured, largely at Claremont,\r\nN.H., bearing on the title page the imprint of Clark, Austin & Smith,\r\nNew York.\r\n\r\nThe Smith of this firm was Cornelius Smith, a brother of Winthrop B.\r\nSmith. Cornelius Smith withdrew from this firm before 1861. In that year\r\nthe war broke out, and this New York firm, which as booksellers and\r\nstationers had a large trade in the South, lost not only their custom in\r\nthat section, but were unable to collect large amounts due them for\r\ngoods. Clark, Austin, Maynard & Co. failed and Mr. W.B. Smith bought, in\r\n1862, all their assets for the sum of $6,000, placed Mr. W.B. Thalheimer\r\nin charge of the business and resumed control of the duplicate plates of\r\nthe McGuffey Readers.\r\n\r\nFrom the location of Cincinnati on the Ohio river, then affording\r\nthe cheapest means of distributing goods to all parts of the South,\r\nMr. Smith had obtained, before 1860, a very considerable part of the\r\nschoolbook trade in the Southern states of the Mississippi Valley.\r\nThe opening of the Civil War swept this trade away and left on the\r\nbooks of the firm in Cincinnati many accounts not then collectible.\r\nThe continuance of the war and the constant fluctuations in the price of\r\nmaterials, due to the use of paper money, joined to advancing age and\r\nill health, all combined to lead Mr. Smith to withdraw from business.\r\n\r\n[New Firm Formed]\r\n\r\nA new firm, Sargent, Wilson & Hinkle, was organized April 20, 1863,\r\nwith Edward Sargent, Obed J. Wilson and Anthony H. Hinkle as general\r\npartners, and with W.B. Smith and D.B. Sargent as special partners.\r\n\r\nThese active partners had long been in this business, Mr. Sargent as\r\na partner and bookkeeper, Mr. Wilson as literary editor of skill and\r\njudgment and also a forceful manager of agents, Mr. Hinkle as a\r\nthoroughly skilled binder and manufacturer.\r\n\r\nWinthrop B. Smith and D.B. Sargent remained as special partners,\r\nfurnishing capital but taking no part in the direction of the business.\r\n\r\n[Southern Reprint]\r\n\r\nThe Confederate States, at the opening of the War, had within their\r\nlimits no publisher of schoolbooks which had extensive sales. Nearly all\r\nof the schoolbooks used in the South were printed in the North. But\r\nthere were printing offices and binderies in the South. The children\r\ncontinued to go to school, and the demand for schoolbooks soon became\r\nurgent. To meet this demand, a few new schoolbooks were made and\r\ncopyrighted under the laws of the Confederacy; but others were reprints\r\nof Northern books such as were in general use. The Methodist Book\r\nConcern of Nashville, Tenn., reprinted the McGuffey Readers and supplied\r\nthe region south and west of Nashville until the Federal line swept past\r\nthat city. This action on the part of the Methodist Book Concern had the\r\neffect of preserving the market for these readers, so that as soon as\r\nany part of the South was strongly occupied by the Federal forces,\r\norders came to the Cincinnati publishers for fresh supplies of the\r\nMcGuffey Readers. This unexpected preservation of trade was of great\r\nbenefit to the firm of Sargent, Wilson & Hinkle.\r\n\r\n[Wilson, Hinkle & Co.]\r\n\r\nIn 1866 the special interests were closed out, and Mr. Lewis Van Antwerp\r\nwas admitted as a partner. On April 20, 1868, the firm of Sargent,\r\nWilson & Hinkle was dissolved. Mr. Sargent retired and the new firm,\r\nWilson, Hinkle & Co., bought all the assets. At this date Mr. Robert\r\nQuincy Beer became a partner. Mr. Beer had long been a trusted and\r\nsuccessful agent and he was put in charge of the agency department.\r\nUnder this partnership the business gradually became systematized in\r\ndepartments. One partner had in charge the reading of manuscripts and\r\nthe placing of accepted works in book form, one had charge of the\r\nmanufacture of books from plates provided by the first, and one of\r\nfinding a market for the books. At the first organization of the firm of\r\nWilson, Hinkle & Co., Mr. Wilson was the literary manager as well as the\r\ndirector of agency work. Mr. Hinkle was the manufacturer, having control\r\nof the printing and binding, and Mr. Van Antwerp had charge of the\r\naccounts. Mr. Beer was brought in to relieve Mr. Wilson in the direction\r\nof agents. But Mr. Beer died suddenly, January 3, 1870, and the\r\nsurviving partners soon sought for another competent and experienced man\r\nto take his place.\r\n\r\n[Van Antwerp, Bragg & Co.]\r\n\r\nMr. Caleb S. Bragg had for years acted as the agent for a list of books\r\nselected by him from the publications of two or three publishers and was\r\na partner in the firm of Ingham & Bragg, booksellers of Cleveland, Ohio.\r\nMr. Bragg sold his interest in the business in Cleveland and became a\r\npartner in Wilson, Hinkle & Co., on April 20, 1871; and at the same\r\ntime Henry H. Vail and Robert F. Leaman, who had for some years been\r\nemployees, were each given an interest in the profits although not\r\nadmitted as full partners until three years later. Mr. Hinkle\'s eldest\r\nson, A. Howard Hinkle, was brought up in the business, and the contract\r\nfor 1874 provided that he should be admitted as a partner, with his\r\nfather\'s interest and in his place, when that contract expired in 1877.\r\nThe contract of 1874 was preparatory to the voluntary retirement of both\r\nMr. Wilson and Mr. Hinkle. Consequently, on April 20, 1877, the firm of\r\nWilson, Hinkle & Co. was dissolved and the business was purchased by the\r\nnew firm. Van Antwerp, Bragg & Co., of which Lewis Van Antwerp, Caleb S.\r\nBragg, Henry H. Vail, Robert F. Leaman, A. Howard Hinkle, and Harry T.\r\nAmbrose were the partners. This firm continued unchanged until January\r\n1, 1892, except for the untimely death of Mr. Leaman on December 12,\r\n1887, and the retirement of Mr. Van Antwerp, January 2, 1890, just\r\nprevious to the sale of the copyrights and plates owned by the firm to\r\nthe American Book Company.\r\n\r\nThis sale, completed May 15, 1890, did not then include the printing\r\noffice and bindery belonging to the firm. These were used by the firm of\r\nVan Antwerp, Bragg & Co. until January 1, 1892, in manufacturing books\r\nordered by the American Book Company. The American Book Company became,\r\non May 15, 1890, the owners, by purchase, of all the copyrights and\r\nplates formerly owned by Van Antwerp, Bragg & Co. The four active\r\npartners in that firm, each of whom had then been in the schoolbook\r\nbusiness some twenty-five or thirty years, entered the employ of the\r\nAmerican Book Company. Mr. Bragg and Mr. Hinkle remained in charge of\r\nthe Cincinnati business, Mr. Vail and Mr. Ambrose went to New York; the\r\nformer as editor in chief, the latter was at first treasurer, but later\r\nbecame the president.\r\n\r\n[A Vigorous Firm]\r\n\r\nVan Antwerp, Bragg & Co. issued many new and successful books and remade\r\nmany, including the McGuffey Readers and Speller, Ray\'s Arithmetics and\r\nHarvey\'s Grammars. Most of these met with acceptance and this was so\r\nfull and universal throughout the central West as to give opportunity to\r\nthe competing agents of other houses to honor Van Antwerp, Bragg & Co.\r\nwith such titles as "Octopus" and "Monopoly," names that were used\r\nbefore "Trusts" were invented. They also called the firm in chosen\r\ncompanies, "Van Anteup, Grabb & Co." These were mere playful or humorous\r\ntitles in recognition of the fact that this firm had, by its industry,\r\nskill and energy, captured a larger share of the patronage of the people\r\nthan was agreeable to its competitors, and they, in despair of success\r\nby fair means, resorted to the old-fashioned method of calling their\r\nantagonist bad names. The best books, if pressed vigorously and\r\nintelligently, were sure to win in the end, and the people who used the\r\nbooks cared little what name appeared at the foot of the title-page.\r\n\r\nIn all important book contests the firm that holds possession of the\r\nfield is much in the situation of the tallest man in a Kilkenny Fair.\r\nHis head sticks up above the crowd and therefore gets the most knocks.\r\n\r\n[Revisers and Editors]\r\n\r\nThe latest revision of the McGuffey Readers, five books, was prepared\r\nand published by the American Book Company in 1901, under the same\r\ngeneral direction as the revision of 1878; but the actual work was done\r\nby Dr. James Baldwin who was the author of the Harper Readers and of\r\nBaldwin\'s Readers. Even in this latest edition there are in the higher\r\nbooks many selections that appeared in the earliest. Care was taken to\r\nmaintain the high moral tone that so clearly marked Dr. McGuffey\'s work\r\nand to bring in from later literature some valuable new material to\r\ndisplace that which had proved less interesting and less instructive.\r\nThese books acquired at once a large sale, and the sales of the previous\r\neditions are still remunerative.\r\n\r\nOf the men connected with these successive owners of these copyrights it\r\nseems proper to name those who directed the revisions which took place.\r\nIt is evident that none were undertaken without long and anxious\r\ndiscussions as to the need of revision and of its nature. In such\r\ndecisions all partners would take part; but finally the actual direction\r\nmust come into the hands of some one partner whose experience and\r\nqualification best fitted him for literary work.\r\n\r\nAs has been seen, Mr. Winthrop B. Smith was for a few years, while the\r\nbusiness was still in its infancy, the sole owner and the manager of\r\nevery part of his business. Mr. Pinneo contributed aid from 1843 to\r\n1856; but even before his work was finished Mr. O.J. Wilson\'s skill\r\nbecame recognized and his mind was dominant in literary matters so long\r\nas he remained a partner--until 1877. But in the meantime he had\r\ncarefully trained a successor in the editorial work, and from 1877 until\r\n1907 the responsibility fell upon him.\r\n\r\n[New Competitors]\r\n\r\nThe story of the revisions of 1843 and 1853 has been told. The books\r\nwere apparently in satisfactory use in a large part of the West; but\r\nabout 1874 the firm thought it wise to exploit a new series. At its\r\nrequest Mr. Thomas W. Harvey prepared a series consisting of five books.\r\nThis series was published in 1875; but the experience of a few years\r\nwith the Harvey Readers showed that the people still preferred the\r\nMcGuffey Readers and after long discussion and hesitation it was agreed\r\nthat these should again be revised. This determination was hastened by\r\nthe publication of the Appleton Readers in 1877, and by the incoming of\r\na number of skilled agents pushing these books in the field that had for\r\nmany years been held so strongly for the McGuffey Readers as to baffle\r\nthe best endeavors of two or three Eastern publishers who had tested the\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nThe Appleton Readers were prepared by Mr. Andrew J. Rickoff, then\r\nsuperintendent of the Cleveland schools; Mr. William T. Harris, then\r\nsuperintendent of the St. Louis schools, and Professor Mark Bailey of\r\nYale College. They were largely aided in the lower readers by Mrs.\r\nRickoff. These books, with this array of scholarly and well-known\r\nauthors, illustrated with carefully prepared engravings, well printed\r\nand well bound, became at once formidable competitors for patronage and\r\nwent into use in many places where the McGuffey Readers had served at\r\nleast two generations of pupils. The Harvey Readers stood no chance in\r\nthis competition.\r\n\r\n[The Revision of 1878]\r\n\r\nOn April 9, 1878, the firm of Van Antwerp, Bragg & Co. determined upon\r\nmaking a new series of readers bearing the well-recognized title of\r\nMcGuffey\'s Eclectic Readers and distinguished as a "Revised Edition."\r\nSome details of the plan as presented by the partner having literary\r\nmatters in charge were agreed to. The method of teaching in the first\r\nreader was to be adjusted to a phonic-word method, and the gradation was\r\nto be improved. The selections of the older books were to be retained\r\nexcept where they could be improved.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this resolution the editor invited four persons to\r\naid, during the summer, in this work. These were Thomas W. Harvey of\r\nPainesville, Ohio; Robert W. Stevenson, of Columbus; Edwin C. Hewett, of\r\nBloomington, Ill.; and Miss Amanda Funnelle, of Terre Haute, Indiana.\r\nEach was a teacher of wide experience.\r\n\r\nTo these assistants assembled in Cincinnati the plan of revision\r\nwas fully explained and the work was alloted. Miss Funnelle and Mr.\r\nStevenson took charge of the first three readers, Mr. Harvey and Dr.\r\nHewett of the three higher books. All were perfectly familiar with the\r\nold books and in a few days substantial agreement was reached as to the\r\nchanges needed. By two months of constant and intelligent labor the\r\nmanuscripts assumed approximate form. The opening of the schools called\r\nthe assistants back to their homes and the editor of the firm shaped the\r\nmanuscripts for the text and procured the necessary illustrations. These\r\nwere made, regardless of cost, by the best artists and engravers to be\r\nfound in the country. When the plates were finished, the publishers\r\nprinted several hundred copies of each of the three smaller books and\r\ndistributed them as proofs to selected teachers in many states, asking\r\nthem for criticisms and suggestions. The answers made were of great\r\nvalue. The First Reader was entirely re-written by the editor and the\r\nplates of other readers were made more perfect. In this revision the\r\nthree lower books were almost entirely new. The Fourth was largely\r\nnew matter, while in the Fifth and Sixth such matter as could not be\r\nimproved from the entire field of literature, was retained. The Fifth\r\nand Sixth readers furnished brief biographies of each author and\r\ncontained notes explanatory of the text. These were new features and\r\nthey proved valuable at that date.\r\n\r\n[Preparations for a Fight]\r\n\r\nAs soon as these books were completed, large editions were printed and\r\nthey were most vigorously exploited not only to take the place of the\r\nolder edition of McGuffey Readers, but to supplant the newly introduced\r\nAppleton Readers.\r\n\r\nThis book-fight was a long and bitter one. Every device known to the\r\nagency managers of the houses engaged was employed. Even exchanges of\r\nbooks became common. It was war; and like every war was carried on for\r\nvictory and not for profit. It is perhaps fortunate that such contests\r\ncannot in the nature of things last long. In the long run business\r\nmust show a profit or fail. Contrary to popular opinion, a book war is\r\nnot profitable in itself; but it is a form of competition that has\r\nexisted for fully a century. It presents no novelties even now.\r\n\r\n[Success Attained]\r\n\r\nThe two chief combatants at length withdrew with one accord. Neither\r\nfirm could claim entire victory; but the McGuffey readers came through\r\nwith much the larger sales and these increased for years. By this\r\ncontest the firm of Van Antwerp, Bragg & Co. won a reputation as\r\nfighters that protected them in after years from ill-considered attacks\r\nby its competitors.\r\n\r\nThe revised edition of the McGuffey Readers, having no author\'s name on\r\nthe title page, designed and compiled under the direction of the\r\npublishers, but retaining the moral excellences and literary qualities\r\nthat had been affixed to the series from its origin, attained the\r\nlargest sales that have as yet been accorded by the public to a single\r\nseries of books. Of the Sixth Reader, which must have the least sale,\r\nover a million copies have been distributed, as shown by the edition\r\nnumber. Of the First Reader more than eight million copies have been\r\nused.\r\n\r\n[Other Competitors]\r\n\r\nAt no time in the history of these readers have they been without\r\nformidable competition. Pickett\'s Readers were published in Cincinnati\r\nas early as 1832. Albert Pickett was at one time president of the\r\nCollege of Teachers and his books were published by John W. Pickett, who\r\nwas probably his brother. Later some additional books were prepared by\r\nJohn W. Pickett, M.D., LL.D., and published by U.P. James in 1841, and\r\nby J. Earnst in 1845. These readers were vigorously pushed into the\r\nmarket for several years, but in the end were unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nThe Goodrich Readers published by Morton & Griswold in Louisville, Ky.,\r\nwere perhaps the most constant competitors with the McGuffey Readers in\r\nthe early years throughout the states of the Mississippi Valley. These\r\nwere prepared by S.G. Goodrich, the author of the then popular "Peter\r\nParley Tales." The readers were originally published in Boston and\r\nsome copies bear the imprint of Otis, Broaders & Co. They were first\r\ncopyrighted in 1839 and were frequently revised. They finally became the\r\nproperty of the Louisville publisher. Mr. Smith and Mr. Morton kept up a\r\nmost vigorous schoolbook war, especially in Ohio, Indiana and Kentucky\r\nin the years from 1845 to 1860. Cobb\'s Readers, copyrighted in 1845,\r\nwere published for some time in Cincinnati by B. Davenport. These were\r\nonce widely introduced but soon went out of use.\r\n\r\nIt was very much the custom in those early days, before the railroads\r\nmade transportation quick and cheap for Eastern publishers to furnish a\r\nset of plates to some enterprising bookseller in the West or to print an\r\nedition for him with his imprint.\r\n\r\nEbenezer Porter\'s Rhetorical Reader copyrighted in 1835 was sold largely\r\nin the western market by William H. Moore, of Cincinnati, and in 1848\r\nthe books bore his imprint. Thus there was ample competition for the\r\nmarket even at this early date. The Pickett Readers, Cobb Readers,\r\nGoodrich Readers, and even the excellent Rhetorical Reader of Ebenezer\r\nPorter were all swept out of the schools by the superior qualities of\r\nthe McGuffey Readers and the persistent energies of their publishers.\r\n\r\n[Humorous Advertising]\r\n\r\nIn these books the publishers found space for a little advertising of\r\ntheir wares. In Pickett\'s Readers there is printed conspicuously at the\r\ntop of a page a warm commendation of Pickett\'s Readers, written in 1835\r\nby William H. McGuffey, Professor at Miami University, in which he\r\n"considers them superior to any other works I have seen." That was\r\nbefore he made his own readers. Mr. Smith responded by publishing a\r\nstrong commendation of one of his books signed by Mr. Albert Pickett.\r\nLife is seldom devoid of the lesser amenities.\r\n\r\nThe Willson Readers, published by the Harper Brothers, were vigorously\r\npushed into the schools of Ohio and Indiana about 1867. The first supply\r\nwas usually sold to the school authorities by agents who operated on the\r\ncommission plan. Thus the agents had an interest in the introduction\r\nsales, but cared nothing about the continuance of sales in after years.\r\nBooksellers, meanwhile, kept the McGuffey Readers in stock, and whenever\r\nnew readers were desired these were easily obtained. In a few years the\r\nWillson Readers were out of the schools. Of course, there was no lack of\r\ntraveling agents and of circulars which freely criticised these Willson\r\nReaders, which were constructed to teach not only reading but science.\r\nAfter a short time the children wearied of reading about bugs and\r\nbeetles they had never seen and gladly welcomed the books that had a\r\nsingle aim.\r\n\r\n[Enduring Qualities]\r\n\r\nIn the eyes of a publisher a good schoolbook is one that can be readily\r\nintroduced and one that will stay when it is put in use. The officials\r\nwho adopt a schoolbook are not the users of the book. They are adults\r\nlong past the school age. Cases have been known when in important\r\nadoptions the majority of the adopting board had not seen the inside of\r\na school room for twenty-five years. Of course such men are far behind\r\nthe schools. They are governed by their own past experience. When the\r\nteachers are allowed to have a voice in the way of advice, the real\r\nneeds of the pupils obtain more consideration. But the final real judge\r\nof the merits of a schoolbook is the boy or girl who uses it. If the\r\nbook is truly pedagogical, adjusted in every part to the average mental\r\ndevelopment of the child, it becomes a valuable tool in the school room.\r\nIf on the other hand it is a mere collection of novelties such as catch\r\nthe eye of inexpert judges and impress merely the imagination, the books\r\nmay be introduced; but they won\'t stay.\r\n\r\n[Child Nature]\r\n\r\nThe McGuffey Readers had staying qualities. Teachers often became so\r\nfamiliar with their contents that they needed no book in their hands\r\nto correct the work, but to each child the contents of the book were\r\nnew and fresh. It is the fashion of the present day to exalt the new\r\nat the expense of the old. But the child of today is very much such\r\nas Socrates and Plato studied in Greece. The development of the human\r\nmind may be more generally understood than it was then; but it may be\r\ndoubted whether the mass of teachers are today wiser in the results of\r\nchild-study than were the philosophers of ancient days. Child nature\r\nremains the same. At a given stage in his upward progress, he is\r\ninterested in much the same things. He is led to think for himself\r\nin much the same way, and the whole end and aim of education is\r\nto lead toward self activity. The readers that deal simply with\r\nfacts--information readers--may lodge in the minds of children some\r\nscraps of encyclopedic information which may in future life become\r\nuseful. But the readers that rouse the moral sentiments, that touch the\r\nimagination, that elevate and establish character by selections chosen\r\nfrom the wisest writers in English in all the centuries that have passed\r\nsince our language assumed a comparatively fixed literary form, have a\r\nmuch more valuable function to perform. Character is more valuable than\r\nknowledge and a taste for pure and ennobling literature is a safeguard\r\nfor the young that cannot be safely ignored.\r\n\r\nThe success of the McGuffey Readers was due primarily to their\r\nadaptation to the general demand of the schools and secondarily to the\r\nenergy and skill of their publishers.\r\n\r\n[Moral Teaching]\r\n\r\nThe books in their first form were strongly religious in their teaching\r\nwithout being denominational. If a selection taught a moral lesson this\r\nwas stated in formal words at the close. The pill was not sugared. Thus\r\nat the close of a lesson narrating the results of disobedience, the\r\nthree little girls assembled and "they were talking how happy it made\r\nthem to keep the Fifth Commandment." There was in the books much direct\r\nteaching of moral principles, with "thou shalt" and "thou shalt not."\r\nIn the later revisions this gradually disappeared. The moral teaching\r\nwas less direct but more effective. The pupil was left to make his own\r\ndeduction and the formal "haec fabula docet" was omitted. The author\r\nand the publishers were fully justified in their firm belief that the\r\nAmerican people are a moral people and that they have a strong desire\r\nthat their children be taught to become brave, patriotic, honest,\r\nself-reliant, temperate, and virtuous citizens.\r\n\r\nIn some of these books the retail price is printed. In 1844 the retail\r\nprice of the First Reader was twelve and a half cents. It contained 108\r\npages. In the same year, the Second Reader of 216 pages was priced at 25\r\ncents. The Fourth Reader cost 75 cents, and contained 336 pages.\r\n\r\nThese prices were in a market when the day\'s wage of a laboring man was\r\nonly fifty cents. Relatively to the cost of other articles, schoolbooks\r\nwere not nearly so cheap as they are now.\r\n\r\n[Copyright Files]\r\n\r\nWhen Truman & Smith began publishing, the copyright law required the\r\ndeposit of titles and copies of the several books in the office of\r\nthe Clerk of the District Court. At first such deposits were made in\r\nColumbus, Ohio, but later in Cincinnati. When Congress organized the\r\nCopyright Bureau in Washington, the several clerks were required to send\r\nto the Library of Congress all the sample copies deposited; but these\r\nhad been carelessly kept and many were lost. A duplicate set was for\r\nyears required to be sent to the Smithsonian Institution in Washington.\r\nThese were also passed into the custody of the Librarian of Congress;\r\nbut this collection had been carelessly preserved and the files of the\r\nMcGuffey Readers at Washington are now quite defective for the earliest\r\nissues. The Library seems to have no copy of any number of the first\r\nedition except possibly the Second and Fourth. The copy of the Second\r\nwas deposited December 12, 1836. The Fourth bears date of July, 1837.\r\nAll the other early copies found in that library are of later dates and\r\nare "Revised and Improved."\r\n\r\n[Early Engravings]\r\n\r\nIt may be well to indicate in a general way the progress that has been\r\nmade in illustrating schoolbooks. The first editions of the McGuffey\r\nReaders as issued in 1836 and 1837 did not contain a single original\r\nengraving. All seem to have been copied from English books. The nice\r\nlittle boys wear round-about jackets with wide, white ruffled collars\r\nat the neck. The proper little girls have scoop bonnets and conspicuous\r\npantalets. Most of the men wear knee breeches. The houses shown have the\r\nthatched roofs of English cottages. In one picture a boy has a regular\r\ncricket bat. Other schoolbooks of that date show similar appropriations\r\nof English engravings; but even at that time there were a few wood\r\nengravers in America. When the second general revision was made in 1843\r\nsome original illustrations appeared and in the edition of 1853 notice\r\nwas given on the title page that the engravings were copyright property\r\nthat must not be used by others.\r\n\r\nAs pictures are closely studied by children, some of the users of these\r\nearly books may remember the cut showing vividly the dangers of "whale\r\ncatching." Two boats are thrown high in the air by one sweep of the\r\nanimal\'s tail and one seaman is shown head downward still in the boat.\r\nAnother represented Jonah being cast overboard from the ship toward the\r\nwhale below whose mouth is manifestly large enough to accommodate Jonah.\r\n\r\nBut the engravings in this edition of 1853 had no considerable artistic\r\nquality and they were very coarsely engraved. In 1863 came the first\r\nemployment of a genuine artist in wood engraving. This was Mr. E.J.\r\nWhitney who had made a reputation by work done for New York publishers.\r\nHis engravings were to take the place of some then in the books and\r\ntheir sizes were precisely determined. The drawings were most carefully\r\nmade by Mr. Herrick with pencil on the whitened boxwood blocks, and sent\r\nto the publisher for examination. These, when approved, were returned to\r\nthe engraver who followed precisely the lines of the drawing. When the\r\nengraving was finished, a carefully rubbed proof on India paper was sent\r\nto the publisher. If this was satisfactory, the block was delivered\r\nand from it an electrotype was made for printing. The block itself was\r\npreserved as an original. Mr. Whitney\'s work was thoroughly good. He\r\nwas a wood engraver of the old school.\r\n\r\n[New Processes]\r\n\r\nWhen the revision of 1878 was decided on, the publishers of the\r\nMcGuffey Readers realized that much improvement must be made in the\r\nillustrations. About this time the magazines were placing great stress\r\nupon pictorial work and a new school of engravers came into existence.\r\nThe wood engravers had already departed from the painful reproduction of\r\neach line of a pencil drawing and had become skilled in representing\r\ntints of light and shade if placed on the whitened block with a brush.\r\nThis gave greater freedom of interpretation to the engraver. The next\r\nstep was to have the drawing made large and reproduced on the block by\r\nphotography. By this method most of the engravings were made for the\r\nedition of 1878. Care was taken to employ artists of reputation and the\r\nengravings were usually signed by the artist and by the engraver.\r\n\r\nBefore the last edition came out in 1901, photo-engraving had nearly\r\nsupplanted wood engraving. By this process the artist\'s drawing with\r\nthe brush is reproduced in fine tints which, when well engraved and\r\ncarefully printed, produce effective results. Pen and ink drawings are\r\nalso reproduced in exact facsimile. By this process the hand work of\r\nthe engraver is nearly eliminated. The blocks are sometimes retouched\r\nto produce effects not attained by the process work. The skill of the\r\nartist in making the drawing thus becomes all important.\r\n\r\n[Later Inventions]\r\n\r\nThe introduction of color work in the schoolbooks intended for young\r\nchildren resulted from the invention of the three-color plates. From\r\nnature, or from a colored painting, three photographs are taken--one\r\nexcluding all but the yellow rays of light, one for the red rays, and\r\none for the blue. From these photographs three tint blocks are made\r\nwhich to the eye in many cases look exactly alike. From one of these\r\nan impression is made with yellow ink, exactly over this the red plate\r\nprints with red ink and this is followed by an impression from the blue\r\nplate. If the effects of the color screens of the camera are exactly\r\nreproduced by the printer\'s inks and with exactly the right amount of\r\nink, the result is wonderfully satisfactory.\r\n\r\nWhat are the qualities in these McGuffey Eclectic Readers that won for\r\nthem through three-quarters of a century such wide and constant use?\r\n\r\n[Character Building]\r\n\r\nThe best answer to this question may be drawn from the many newspaper\r\narticles which appeared in Western and Southern papers after the death\r\nof one of the authors. There is general recognition on the part of the\r\nwriters of these articles that while the books served well their purpose\r\nof teaching the art of reading, their greatest value consisted in the\r\nchoice of masterpieces in literature which by their contents taught\r\nmorality, and patriotism and by their beauty served as a gateway to pure\r\nliterature. One editor, who used these books in his school career, said,\r\n"Thousands of men and women owe their wholesome views of life, as well\r\nas whatever success they may have attained to the wholesome maxims and\r\nprecepts found on every page of these valuable books. The seed they\r\nscattered has yielded a million-fold. All honor to the name and memory\r\nof this excellent and useful man."\r\n\r\n[What Constitutes Real Value]\r\n\r\nOne of the wise men of the olden time cared not who wrote the laws if he\r\nmight write their songs. Among a people devoid of books the folk-songs\r\nare early lodged firmly in the mind of every child. They influence his\r\nwhole life. The modern schoolbooks--particularly the readers--furnish\r\nthe basis of the moral and intellectual training of the youth in every\r\ncommunity. The McGuffey Readers, from their own peculiar inherent\r\nqualities, retained their hold upon the schools until in some states\r\nlaws were passed which in their operation caused schoolbooks to be\r\nregarded as commodities estimated almost solely upon the cost of paper,\r\nprinting and binding. The value of these material things can easily be\r\nascertained and compared; but unless the print carries the lessons that\r\nhelp to form a life the paper is wasted and the pupil\'s most valuable\r\ntime is misspent. The teaching power of a schoolbook cannot be weighed\r\nin the grocer\'s scales nor measured with a pint cup. In the field open\r\nto free and constant competition, the books best suited to the wants of\r\neach community will in the end succeed. It was under such conditions\r\nthat the McGuffey Readers won and held their place in the schools.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg\'s A History of the McGuffey Readers, by Henry H.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
