The goal\r\nof camp is not just to get the boys out the parents\' hair, but to\r\nencourage good character and citizenship. Camp leaders are enticed by the\r\ncontribution they can make to the boys\' futures and are selected (or\r\nrejected) based on their own moral virtues.\r\n\r\nThere are many practical suggestions for safety and comfort aside from the\r\nabsence of modern materials and conveniences, like nylon and gas stoves.\r\n\r\nMedical advice given in the book is from 1913 and may be unhelpful, often\r\ncontradicts current practice and involves unsafe or now illegal\r\nsubstances.\r\n\r\nThe approximate conversion for prices is 20 to 1, $1 in 1913 is about $20\r\nin 2004.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photograph by Joseph Legg]\r\n\r\nThe Heart of the Camp\r\n\r\nHave you smelled wood smoke at twilight?\r\nHave you heard the birch log burning?\r\nAre you quick to read the noises of the night?\r\nYou must follow with the others for the young men\'s feet are turning\r\nTo the camps of proved desire and known delight.\r\n\r\nFrom Kipling\'s "Feet of the Young Men."\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMPING FOR BOYS\r\nH.

To share with others this\r\nexperience has been his aim in writing the book. The various chapters have\r\nbeen worked out from a practical viewpoint, the desire being to make a\r\nhandbook of suggestions for those in charge of camps for boys and for boys\r\nwho go camping, rather than a theoretical treatise upon the general\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThanks are due to E. M. Robinson, Dr. Elias G. Brown, Charles R. Scott,\r\nIrving G. MacColl, J. A. Van Dis, Taylor Statten, W. H. Wones, H. C.\r\nBeckman, W. H. Burger, H. M. Burr, A. B. Wegener, A. D. Murray, and H. M.\r\nAllen, for valuable suggestions and ideas incorporated in many chapters.\r\n\r\nGrateful acknowledgment is made to the following publishers for permission\r\nto quote from the books mentioned in the bibliography--Charles Scribner\'s\r\nSons, Harper Brothers, Outing Publishing Company, Baker & Taylor Company,\r\nLothrop, Lee & Shepard Company, Penn Publishing Company, Doubleday, Page &\r\nCompany, Hinds, Noble & Eldredge, Ginn & Company, Sunday School Times\r\nCompany, G.

The following books, or similar ones,\r\nmay be found in any well-equipped library.\r\n\r\nIf this book will help some man to be of greater service to boys, as well\r\nas to inspire boys to live the noble life which God\'s great out-of-doors\r\nteaches, the author will feel amply repaid for his labor.

M. Burr.\r\n\r\nThe summer time is a period of moral deterioration with most boys. Free\r\nfrom restraint of school and many times of home, boys wander during the\r\nvacation time into paths of wrongdoing largely because of a lack of\r\ndirected play life and a natural outlet for the expenditure of their\r\nsurplus energy. The vacation problem therefore becomes a serious one for\r\nboth the boy and his parent. Camping offers a solution.\r\n\r\nThe Need\r\n\r\n"A boy in the process of growing needs the outdoors. He needs room and\r\nrange. He needs the tonic of the hills, the woods and streams. He needs to\r\nwalk under the great sky, and commune with the stars. He needs to place\r\nhimself where nature can speak to him. He ought to get close to the soil.\r\nHe ought to be toughened by sun and wind, rain and cold. Nothing can take\r\nthe place, for the boy, of stout physique, robust health, good blood, firm\r\nmuscles, sound nerves, for these are the conditions of character and\r\nefficiency. The early teens are the most important years for the boy\r\nphysically... Through the ages of thirteen and fifteen the more he can be\r\nin the open, free from social engagements and from continuous labor or\r\nstudy, the better. He should fish, swim, row and sail, roam the woods and\r\nthe waters, get plenty of vigorous action, have interesting, healthful\r\nthings to think about."--Prof. C. W. Votaw.\r\n\r\nThe Purpose\r\n\r\nThis is the real purpose of camping--"something to do, something to think\r\nabout, something to enjoy in the woods, with a view always to\r\ncharacter-building"--this is the way Ernest Thompson-Seton, that master\r\nwood-craftsman, puts it. Character building! What a great objective! It\r\nchallenges the best that is in a man or boy. Camping is an experience, not\r\nan institution. It is an experience which every live, full-blooded,\r\ngrowing boy longs for, and happy the day of his realization. At the first\r\nsign of spring, back yards blossom forth with tents of endless variety. To\r\nsleep out, to cook food, to search for nature\'s fascinating secrets, to\r\nmake things--all are but the expression of that instinct for freedom of\r\nliving in the great out-of-doors which God created within him.\r\n\r\nToo Much House\r\n\r\n"Too much house," says Jacob Riis; "Civilization has been making of the\r\nworld a hothouse. Man\'s instinct of self-preservation rebels; hence the\r\nappeal for the return to the simple life that is growing loud." Boys need\r\nto get away from the schoolroom and books, and may I say the martyrdom of\r\nexaminations, high marks, promotions and exhibitions! Medical examinations\r\nof school children reveal some startling facts. Why should boys suffer\r\nfrom nerves? Are we sacrificing bodily vigor for abnormal intellectual\r\ngrowth? Have we been fighting against instead of cooperating with nature?\r\n\r\nThe tide is turning, however, and the people are living more and more in\r\nthe open. Apostles of outdoor life like Henry D. Thoreau, John Burroughs,\r\nWilliam Hamilton Gibson, Howard Henderson, Ernest Thompson-Seton, Frank\r\nBeard, Horace Kephart, Edward Breck, Charles Stedman Hanks, Stewart Edward\r\nWhite, "Nessmuck," W. C. Gray, and a host of others, have, through their\r\nwritings, arrested the thought of busy people long enough to have them see\r\nthe error of their ways and are bringing them to repentance.\r\n\r\nCamps for boys are springing up like mushrooms. Literally thousands of\r\nboys who have heretofore wasted the glorious summer time loafing on the\r\ncity streets, or as disastrously at summer hotels or amusement places, are\r\nnow living during the vacation time under nature\'s canopy of blue with\r\nonly enough covering for protection from rain and wind, and absorbing\r\nthrough the pores of their body that vitality which only pure air,\r\nsunshine, long hours of sleep, wholesome food, and reasonable discipline\r\ncan supply.\r\n\r\nCharacter Building\r\n\r\nIn reading over scores of booklets and prospectuses of camps for boys, one\r\nis impressed with their unanimity of purpose--that of character building.\r\nThese are a few quotations taken from a variety of camp booklets:\r\n\r\n"The object of the camp is healthful recreation without temptation."\r\n\r\n"A camp where boys live close to nature, give themselves up to play,\r\nacquire skill in sports, eat plenty of wholesome food, and sleep long\r\nhours ... and are taught high ideals for their own lives."\r\n\r\n"To give boys a delightful summer outing under favorable conditions, and\r\nto give them every opportunity to become familiar with camp life in all\r\nits phases. We believe this contributes much to the upbuilding of a boy\'s\r\ncharacter and enables him to get out of life much enjoyment that would not\r\notherwise be possible."\r\n\r\n"A place where older boys, boys of the restless age, may live a happy,\r\ncarefree, outdoor life, free from the artificialities and pernicious\r\ninfluences of the larger cities"; a place where "all the cravings of a\r\nreal boy are satisfied"; a place "where constant association with\r\nagreeable companions and the influence of well-bred college men in a clean\r\nand healthy moral atmosphere make for noble manhood; a place where\r\nathletic sports harden the muscles, tan the skin, broaden the shoulders,\r\nbrighten the eye, and send each lad back to his school work in the fall as\r\nbrown as a berry and as hard as nails."\r\n\r\n"A camp of ideals, not a summer hotel nor a supplanter of the home. The\r\nprincipal reason for its existence is the providing of a safe place for\r\nparents to send their boys during the summer vacation, where, under the\r\nleadership of Christian men, they may be developed physically, mentally,\r\nsocially, and morally."\r\n\r\nWhether the camp is conducted under church, settlement, Young Men\'s\r\nChristian Association, or private auspices, the prime purpose of its\r\nexistence should be that of character building.\r\n\r\n"Because of natural, physical, social, educational, moral, and religious\r\nconditions, the boy is taught those underlying principles which determine\r\ncharacter. The harder things a boy does or endures, the stronger man he\r\nwill become; the more unselfish and noble things he does, the better man\r\nhe will become."\r\n\r\nNo Rough-house\r\n\r\nThe day of the extreme "rough-house" camp has passed. Boys have discovered\r\nthat real fun does not mean hurting or discomforting others, but consists\r\nin making others happy. The boy who gets the most out of camp is the boy\r\nwho puts the most into camp.\r\n\r\nMottoes\r\n\r\nMany camps build their program of camp activities around a motto\r\nsuch as\r\n"Each for All, and All for Each,"\r\n"Help the Other Fellow,"\r\n"Do Your Best,"\r\n"Nothing Without Labor,"\r\n"A Gentleman Always," and\r\n"I Can and I Will."\r\n\r\nScout Law\r\n\r\nEndurance, self-control, self-reliance, and unselfishness are taught the\r\n"Boy Scouts" through what is called the "Scout Law."\r\n\r\n(1) A Scout\'s honor is to be trusted;\r\n(2) Be loyal;\r\n(3) Do a good turn to somebody every day;\r\n(4) Be a friend to all;\r\n(5) Be courteous;\r\n(6) Be a friend to animals;\r\n(7) Be obedient;\r\n(8) Be cheerful;\r\n(9) Be thrifty.\r\n\r\nAll these are valuable, because they contribute to the making of\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nIn the conduct of a boys\' camp there must be a definite clear-cut purpose\r\nif satisfactory results are to be obtained. A go-as-you-please or\r\ndo-as-you please camp will soon become a place of harm and moral\r\ndeterioration.\r\n\r\nResults\r\n\r\nCamping should give to the boy that self-reliance which is so essential in\r\nthe making of a life, that faith in others which is the foundation of\r\nsociety, that spirit of altruism which will make him want to be of service\r\nin helping other fellows, that consciousness of God as evidenced in His\r\nhandiwork which will give him a basis of morality, enduring and\r\nreasonable, and a spirit of reverence for things sacred and eternal. He\r\nought to have a better appreciation of his home after a season away from\r\nwhat should be to him the sweetest place on earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II--LEADERSHIP\r\n\r\nTHE DIRECTOR\r\nASSISTANT LEADERS\r\nTHE TERM LEADER\r\nHOW TO GET LEADERS\r\nVARIETY OF TALENT\r\nSUGGESTIONS TO LEADERS\r\nOPPORTUNITY OF LEADERSHIP\r\n\r\nThe success or failure of a boys\' camp depends upon leadership rather than\r\nupon equipment. Boys are influenced by example rather than by precept. A\r\nboys\' camp is largely built around a strong personality. Solve the problem\r\nof leadership, and you solve the greatest problem of camping.\r\n\r\nThe Director\r\n\r\nNo matter how large or how small the camp, there must be one who is in\r\nabsolute control. He may be known as the director, superintendent, or\r\nleader. His word is final. He should be a man of executive ability and\r\ngood common sense. He should have a keen appreciation of justice. A desire\r\nto be the friend and counsellor of every boy must always govern his\r\naction. He will always have the interest and welfare of every individual\r\nboy at heart, realizing that parents have literally turned over to his\r\ncare and keeping, for the time being, the bodies and souls of their boys.\r\nTo be respected should be his aim. Too often the desire to be popular\r\nleads to failure.\r\n\r\nLeaders\r\n\r\nAim to secure as assistant leaders or counsellors young men of\r\nunquestioned character and moral leadership, college men if possible, men\r\nof culture and refinement, who are good athletes, and who understand boy\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n"They should be strong and sympathetic, companionable men. Too much care\r\ncannot be exercised in choosing assistants. Beware of effeminate men, men\r\nwho are morbid in sex matters. An alert leader can spot a \'crooked\' man by\r\nhis actions, his glances, and by his choice of favorites. Deal with a man\r\nof this type firmly, promptly, and quietly. Let him suddenly be \'called\r\nhome by circumstances which he could not control.\'" The leader must have\r\nthe loyalty of his assistants. They should receive their rank from the\r\nleader, and this rank should be recognized by the entire camp. The highest\r\nranking leader present at any time should have authority over the party.\r\n\r\nIn a boys\' camp I prefer the term "leader" to that of "counsellor." It is\r\nmore natural for a boy to follow a leader than to listen to wise\r\ncounsellors. "Come on, fellows, let\'s--" meets with hearty response.\r\n"Boys, do this," is an entirely different thing. Leaders should hold\r\nfrequent councils regarding the life of the camp and share in determining\r\nits policy.\r\n\r\nThe most fruitful source of supply of leaders should be the colleges and\r\npreparatory schools. No vacation can be so profitably spent as that given\r\nover to the leadership of boy life. Here is a form of altruistic service\r\nwhich should appeal to purposeful college men. Older high school boys who\r\nhave been campers make excellent leaders of younger boys. A leader should\r\nalways receive some remuneration for his services, either carfare and\r\nboard or a fixed sum of money definitely agreed upon beforehand. The pay\r\nshould never be so large that he will look upon his position as a "job."\r\nNever cover service with the blinding attractiveness of money. The chief\r\npurpose of pay should be to help deepen the sense of responsibility, and\r\nprevent laxness and indifference, as well as to gain the services of those\r\nwho must earn something.\r\n\r\nDo not take a man as leader simply because he has certificates of\r\nrecommendation. Know him personally. Find out what he is capable of doing.\r\nThe following blank I use in securing information:\r\n\r\nLeader\'s Information Blank, Camps Durrell and Becket\r\nName\r\nAddress\r\nCollege or school\r\nClass of\r\nDo you sing?  What part (tenor or bass)?\r\nDo you swim?\r\nDo you play baseball?   What position?\r\nDo you play an instrument? What?\r\nWill you bring it (unless piano) and music to camp?\r\nHave you won any athletic or aquatic events? What?\r\nWill you bring your school or college pennant with you?\r\nHave you ever taken part in minstrel show, dramatics, or any kind\r\nof entertainment; if so, what?\r\nWhat is your hobby? (If tennis, baseball, swimming, nature study,\r\nhiking, photography, athletics, etc., whatever it is, kindly tell\r\nabout it in order to help in planning the camp activities.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Leader\'s Pulpit--Sunday Morning in  the\r\n"Chapel-by-the-Lake"--Camp Becket.]\r\n\r\nLeaders should not be chosen in order to secure a baseball team, or an\r\nathletic team. Select men of diverse gifts. One should know something\r\nabout nature study, another about manual training, another a good\r\nstory-teller, another a good athlete or baseball player, another a good\r\nswimmer, another a musician, etc. Always remember, however, that the chief\r\nqualification should be moral worth.\r\n\r\nBefore camp opens it is a wise plan to send each leader a letter\r\nexplaining in detail the purpose and program of the camp. A letter like\r\nthe following is sent to the leaders of Camps Durrell and Becket.\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIONS TO CAMP LEADERS.\r\nREAD AND RE-READ.\r\n\r\nThe success of a boys\' camp depends upon the hearty cooperation of each\r\nleader with the superintendent. The boys will imitate you. A smile is\r\nalways better than a frown. "Kicking" in the presence of boys breeds\r\ndiscontent. Loyalty to the camp and its management is absolutely necessary\r\nif there is to be harmony in the camp life.\r\n\r\nPersonal\r\n\r\nYour personal life will either be a blessing or a hindrance to the boys in\r\nyour tent. Study each boy in your tent. Win his confidence. Determine to\r\ndo your best in being a genuine friend of each boy. Remember in prayer\r\ndaily each boy and your fellow leaders. Emphasize the camp motto, "Each\r\nfor all, and all for each." Study the "tests" on pages 8 and 9 of the\r\nbooklets, and be helpful to the boys in your tent who are ambitious to\r\nimprove and win the honor emblems.\r\n\r\nTents\r\n\r\nNeatness and cleanliness must be the watchword of each tent. Sweets draw\r\nants. Decayed material breeds disease. Insist upon the observance of\r\nsanitary rules.\r\n\r\nIt is unwise to have all the boys from one town or city in one tent. The\r\ntendency is to form clans, which destroy camp spirit. Get the fellows\r\ntogether the first thing and choose a tent name and tent yells.\r\n\r\nAppoint a boy who will be responsible for the boys and the tent when you\r\nare not present.\r\n\r\nToo much attention cannot be given to the matter of ventilation. When it\r\nrains, use a forked stick to hold the flaps open in the form of a diamond.\r\nIn clear weather, tie one flap back at each end (flap toward the feet),\r\nallowing a free draft of air at all times. On rainy days encourage the\r\nboys to spend their time in the pavillion. Whenever possible, insist upon\r\ntent and blankets being thoroughly aired each morning.\r\n\r\nThree inspectors will be appointed for each day; fifteen minutes\' notice\r\nwill be given and boys will not be allowed in or around their tents during\r\nthe period of inspection. Leaders may suggest but not participate in\r\narranging the tent.\r\n\r\nThe Honor Banner is to be given to the tent showing the best condition and\r\nheld as long as marks are highest.\r\n\r\nSwimming\r\n\r\nThe U. S. V. L. S. C.[1] crews\' in boats will patrol whenever the boys are\r\nin swimming, and the leader of swimming must give the signal before boys\r\ngo into the water. Boys who cannot swim should be encouraged to learn. The\r\nmorning dip must be a dip and not a swim.\r\n\r\n[Transcriber\'s Note 1: United States Volunteer Life Saving Corps.]\r\n\r\nBoats\r\n\r\nNo boats are to be taken unless an order has been issued by the tent\r\nleader (or by the superintendent). The man at the wharf always has power\r\nto veto orders at his discretion.\r\n\r\nOrder of Day\r\n\r\nIt is the leader\'s part to see that the order of the day is carried out\r\nand on time, including the setting up drill. (See Camp Booklet.) "Follow\r\nthe leader" is an old game which is still influencing boys.\r\n\r\nWork\r\n\r\nThree tents and their leaders are responsible for the work at camp, and\r\nwill be expected to report to the assistant superintendent after breakfast\r\nfor assignment of work. These tents are changed each day, so that the boys\r\nand leaders come on duty only one day in seven.\r\n\r\nEach tent is under its respective leader in doing the following work:\r\n\r\nTent 1. Sanitary work, such as policing the campus, emptying garbage cans,\r\nsweeping the pavillion, disinfecting, etc.\r\n\r\nTent 2. Preparing vegetables for the cook, drying dishes, pots, pans,\r\ncleaning up the kitchen, piazza, etc.\r\n\r\nTent 3. Cleaning the boats, supplying wood for the kitchen, putting ice in\r\nthe refrigerator, etc.\r\n\r\nThe next day tents 4, 5 and 6 will come on duty, and so on until each tent\r\nhas been on duty during the week.\r\n\r\nLeaders for the day will call the squad together after breakfast and\r\nexplain the day\'s plans. Encourage the boys to do this work cheerfully.\r\nLead, do not drive the boys when working. Not more than three hours should\r\nbe consumed in camp work.\r\n\r\nSports and Pastimes\r\n\r\nBring rule books on athletics. Study up group games. Bring any old clothes\r\nfor costumes; tambourines and bones for minstrel show, grease paint, and\r\nburnt cork--in fact, anything that you think will add to the fun of the\r\ncamp. Good stories and jokes are always in demand. Bring something\r\ninteresting to read to your boys on rainy days. Think out some stunt to do\r\nat the social gatherings. If you play an instrument, be sure to bring it\r\nalong with you.\r\n\r\nBank\r\n\r\nEncourage the boys to turn their money and railroad tickets over to the\r\ncamp banker instead of depositing them with you.\r\n\r\nCamp Council\r\n\r\nMeetings of the leaders will be held at the call of the superintendent.\r\nMatters talked over at the council meeting should not be talked over with\r\nthe boys. All matters of discipline or anything that deals with the\r\nwelfare of the camp should be brought up at this meeting. Printed report\r\nblanks will be given to each leader to be filled out and handed to the\r\nassistant superintendent each Thursday morning. Do not show these reports\r\nto the boys.\r\n\r\nBible Study\r\n\r\nEach leader will be expected to read to the boys in his tent a chapter\r\nfrom the Bible and have prayers before "taps" each night, also to take his\r\nturn in leading the morning devotions at breakfast table. Groups of boys\r\nwill meet for occasional Bible study at sunset under various leaders. Each\r\nsession will continue twenty minutes--no longer. Sunday morning service\r\nwill be somewhat formal in character, with an address. The sunset vesper\r\nservice will be informal.\r\n\r\nPraying that the camp may prove a place where leaders and boys may grow in\r\nthe best things of life and anticipating an outing of pleasure and profit\r\nto you, I am Your friend, (signature)\r\n\r\nOpportunities\r\n\r\nIn securing men for leadership, impress upon them the many opportunities\r\nfor the investment of their lives in the kind of work that builds\r\ncharacter. In reading over a small folder, written by George H. Hogeman of\r\nOrange, N .J., I was so impressed with his excellent presentation of this\r\ntheme of opportunities of leadership that the following is quoted in\r\npreference to anything I could write upon the subject:\r\n\r\n"The opportunity of the boys\' camp leader is, first, to engage in the\r\nservice that counts most largely in securing the future welfare of those\r\nwho will soon be called upon to carry on the work that we are now engaged\r\nin. Most people are so busy with their own present enjoyment and future\r\nsuccess that they pay little heed to the future of others. They may give\r\nsome thought to the present need of those around them because it more or\r\nless directly affects themselves, but the work of character building in\r\nboys\' camps is one that shows its best results in the years to come rather\r\nthan in the immediate present.\r\n\r\n"In the second place, the opportunity comes to the camp leader to know\r\nboys as few other people know them, sometimes even better than their own\r\nparents know them. When you live, eat, sleep with a boy in the open, free\r\nlife of camp for a month or so, you come in contact with him at vastly\r\nmore points than you do in the more restrained home life, and you see\r\nsides of his nature that are seldom seen at other times.\r\n\r\n"Finally, the opportunity is given to the man who spends his vacation in\r\ncamp to make the time really count for something in his own life and in\r\nthe lives of others. To how many does vacation really mean a relaxation, a\r\nletting down of effort along one line, without the substitution of\r\nanything definite in its place! But he must be a dull soul, indeed, who\r\ncan come to the right kind of boys\' camp and not go away with his muscles\r\nharder, his eye brighter, his digestion better, and his spirit more awake\r\nto the things that pertain to the Kingdom of God.\r\n\r\n"Then again the camp leader must have the ability to forget himself in\r\nothers. Nowhere can the real play spirit be entered into more completely\r\nthan in camp life. A watchman is the last thing he must be. That spirit of\r\nunselfishness which forgets its own personal pleasure in doing the most\r\nfor the general good, is the ideal camp spirit. As Lowell puts it in the\r\nVision of Sir Launfal, it is:\r\n\r\nNot what we give, but what we share,\r\nFor the gift without the giver is bare.\r\n\r\n"The results of all these points which I have mentioned are some very\r\npositive things. One is the very best kind of a vacation that it is\r\npossible to have. How frequently we hear in response to the question about\r\nenjoying a vacation, \'Oh, yes, I had a good enough time, but I\'ll never go\r\nback there again.\' To my mind that indicates either that the person does\r\nnot know what a really good time is, or that his surroundings made a good\r\ntime impossible.\r\n\r\n"Another result of camp is the real friendships that last long after\r\ncamping days are over. Of these I need not speak. You and I know of many\r\nsuch and what they mean in the development of Christian character in the\r\nlives of our men and boys. And, after all, there is the greatest result of\r\nall, the sense of confidence in the ultimate outcome that comes with\r\nhaving a share in the work of bringing others to the measure of the\r\nstature of the fullness of Christ."\r\n\r\n"The ideal life for a boy is not in the city. He should know of animals,\r\nrivers, plants, and that great out-of-door life that lays for him the\r\nfoundation of his later years."\r\n--G. Stanley.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Camp Becket]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III--LOCATION AND SANITATION\r\n\r\nDIRTY DIRT VS. CLEAN DIRT\r\nAVOID SWAMPS\r\nSELECTING A SITE\r\nLAYING OUT THE CAMP GROUND\r\nTHE LATRINES\r\nGARBAGE\r\nDISH WATER\r\nWASTE BARRELS\r\nWATER SUPPLY\r\nAN INDIAN METHOD\r\nINDIVIDUAL DRINKING CUPBOARD OF HEALTH\r\nMAXIMS\r\n\r\nDirt\r\n\r\nClean camps are most easily kept by not allowing them to become dirty.\r\n\r\n"Cleanliness is next to Godliness. Godliness means a right relation to\r\nthings spiritual, cleanliness a right relation to things material. An old\r\ndefinition says that \'Dirt is merely misplaced matter.\' Of all the\r\nvehicles of disease, the most important perhaps is dirt. The word dirt in\r\nits strict sense comes from the Anglo-Saxon \'drit,\' or excrement. \'Dirt,\'\r\nthen, is not earth or clean sand--not clean dirt, but dirty dirt, that is,\r\nmatter soiled by some of the excreta of the human or animal body.\r\nCleanliness must be insisted upon in a boys\' Camp--not the cleanliness\r\nthat makes a boy squeamish about working with his hands upon some\r\nnecessary job, but cleanliness that makes him afraid of sharing his tooth\r\nbrush or table utensils or his clothes.\r\n\r\nCleanliness is not the shunning of good, clean dirt, but a recognition of\r\nthe fact that to pass anything from one mouth to another is a possible\r\nsource of death and destruction." [1] "Death to dirt" should be the\r\nwatchword of the camp. The camp should be a model of cleanliness. Every\r\nboy should be taught the value of good sanitation and encouraged to\r\ncooperate in making proper sanitation effective.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Dr. Chas. E. A. Winslow--"Camp Conference," p. 58.]\r\n\r\nAvoid Swamps\r\n\r\nThe location chosen for a camp should be away from swamps. Avoid swampy\r\nand low places as you would a plague. Damp places where there are\r\nmosquitoes, should be well drained, and open to an abundance of sunshine.\r\nMosquitoes breed only in water, but a very little water is sufficient if\r\nit is dirty and stagnant. Two inches of water standing in an old tin can\r\nwill breed an innumerable horde. These "diminutive musicians" are not only\r\na nuisance, but dangerous, as malaria and typhoid spreaders by their\r\npoisonous stings.\r\n\r\nThe Site\r\n\r\nIn selecting a camp site bear in mind these things: (1) A sandy sub-soil,\r\nwith good drainage. Avoid very sandy soil; sand provides but little hold\r\nfor tent pegs, and there is grave risk of damage should there come a gale.\r\n(2) An open campus surrounded by hills or sheltering trees, and facing the\r\nwater.  (3) Plenty of good drinking water and water for swimming. (4) Base\r\nfrom which supplies and provisions are to be drawn should be within\r\nconvenient distance, not more than four miles away. (5) Camp should be\r\naway from civilization, far enough to be free from visitors and the\r\ntemptation to "go to town" on the part of the boys. Nothing demoralizes a\r\nboys\' camp so quickly as proximity to a summer resort.\r\n\r\nArrangement\r\n\r\nBefore opening the camp much thought and care should be given to its\r\nsanitary arrangement. First of all, the dryest section of the camp ground\r\nshould be selected for the erection of the sleeping tents. Locate them\r\nwhere they will have the full benefit of the sunshine. Tents erected under\r\ntrees are liable to mildew, for the want of sunshine, and the contents of\r\nthe tent will soon get musty. Next in importance to the location of\r\n"quarters" is the location of the kitchen. This should be near the dining\r\ntent, so that the serving of food may be quick, and yet far enough away to\r\ninsure that disagreeable odors will not destroy the pleasure of eating. If\r\nit is very near the sleeping tents the campers will be awakened too early\r\nby the chopping of wood and the necessary noises made in preparation of\r\nthe morning meal. It should be near water. This is very essential for\r\ncooking and cleaning. In some of the large camps water is carried to the\r\nkitchen in pipes from near-by springs or pumped from wells of pure water.\r\nThe dining quarters naturally should be located near the kitchen so that\r\nfood may be served warm. Provision should be made for the protection of\r\nthe boys from cold, wind, rain, and dampness while eating. The toilet\r\nshould be located rather far away from the camp, and not in the direction\r\nfrom which the prevailing wind comes toward the camp. Make sure that it is\r\non the line of opposite drainage from the water used by the camp. The\r\ndetails of laying out a camp, erection of tents, etc., are given in\r\nanother chapter.\r\n\r\nLatrines\r\n\r\nParticular precaution should be exercised in location and care of the\r\ntoilets or latrines, even in a one-night camp. Neglect of this will mean\r\ndisease. When on a one-night camp, dig a small pit which can be filled in\r\nagain after use. If the camp is to be continued for a week or longer, dig\r\na pit or trench about two or three feet deep and about eighteen inches\r\nwide, plant posts on each side of the trench, and eighteen inches above\r\nthe ground level. Nail shaped seating on these posts. The number of seats\r\nwill be determined by the size of the camping party. It is desirable to\r\nerect a six-foot canvas screen with an opening around the toilet. Dry\r\nearth should be sprinkled freely in the trench each time it is used. Also\r\neach morning sprinkle plenty of chloride of lime or some good, reliable\r\ndisinfectant in the trench. Do not permit the throwing of paper about the\r\ntoilet. Have a box in which paper is to be kept. Flies should be excluded\r\nby boxing up the sides of the seats and fastening a hinged lid upon the\r\nseats (see illustration). It is an advantage to admit the direct sunlight\r\nabout the middle of the day because of its bactericidal action on disease\r\ngerms. In a permanent camp regular wooden closets should be built, with\r\ncovered roof for protection from rain and wind. The back of the closet\r\nshould be arranged either by a hinged door or some other method so that\r\nthe contents may be removed as often as once a week. A wooden box on\r\nrollers placed beneath the seats will facilitate removal. The seats should\r\nbe scrubbed with hot water, sulpho-naphthol, or soap, daily. "Springfield\r\nOval" type of toilet paper prevents unnecessary waste. In one camp the\r\nwater from a near-by brook is dammed and thus by gravity made to flow by a\r\nsystem of modern plumbing through the urinals and flush closets. This is\r\nideal. Insist upon cleanliness. The cutting of initials and names upon the\r\nseats and woodwork should be considered a disgrace as well as a\r\nmisdemeanor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pit Toilet; seat, hinged cover, hinged door at back.]\r\n\r\nTaboo the taking of books and papers to the toilet to read. It should be\r\nan imperative rule that no other place be used. A little carelessness will\r\ncause disagreeable as well as dangerous results. By way of reiteration:\r\nFirst, rigid prohibition of the pollution of the surface of the ground by\r\nthe strictest rules, diligently enforced. Second, the provision of toilets\r\nor latrines of adequate size with proper precaution to prevent the\r\ndispersal of excreta by wind, flies, or other agencies. The latrines\r\nshould be located a distance from camp but not so far as to offer\r\ntemptation to pollution of the ground. Third, boys should be educated when\r\non hikes or tramps in the old Mosaic Rule laid down in Deuteronomy 23:\r\n12-14. [1]\r\n\r\n[Transcriber\'s Footnote 1: "Thou shalt have a place also without the camp,\r\nwhither thou shalt go forth abroad: And thou shalt have a paddle upon thy\r\nweapon; and it shall be, when thou wilt ease thyself abroad, thou shalt\r\ndig therewith, and shalt turn back and cover that which cometh from thee:\r\nFor the LORD thy God walketh in the midst of thy camp, to deliver thee,\r\nand to give up thine enemies before thee; therefore shall thy camp be\r\nholy: that he see no unclean thing in thee, and turn away from thee."]\r\n\r\nGarbage\r\n\r\nGarbage, consisting chiefly of trimmings of meat and vegetables and the\r\nwaste from the table, if stored in open buckets soon becomes offensive and\r\nis an ideal breeding place in warm weather for flies "that drink of\r\ncesspools, dine at privy vaults, eat sputum and are likely to be the most\r\nfamiliar guests at the dinner table, sampling every article of food upon\r\nwhich they walk, leaving in their tracks disease-producing germs which\r\nhave adhered to their sticky feet where they have previously dined."\r\nDeclare war upon the "fly who won\'t wipe his feet" by keeping the garbage\r\nin a covered galvanized-iron pail and dispose of it before decomposition\r\ntakes place. Wash and dry the pail after emptying. If the camp is located\r\nnear a farm, give the garbage to the farmer. It is the natural food of\r\nswine or poultry. Where this is not possible, the garbage should be buried\r\nevery day in the earth and covered with three or four inches of dirt.\r\nAnother and better plan, especially in a large camp, is the burning of the\r\ngarbage and human excreta in an incinerator, such as the McCall. This is\r\nthe method of the United States Army.\r\n\r\nExercise caution in throwing aside tin cans. The vegetable matter\r\nremaining in the cans soon decays and attracts flies. Have a place where\r\nthese cans may be buried or burned with other refuse each day. Keep the\r\nground surrounding the kitchen free from all kinds of garbage or refuse.\r\n\r\nDo not throw dirty dish water promiscuously upon the ground. Dig a trench\r\nand put the water in this trench. Sprinkle chloride of lime or a\r\ndisinfectant upon it each day. In a permanent camp a waste water well\r\nshould be dug and lined with stone. The drain pipe should be laid from the\r\nkitchen to the well. This water soon disappears in the soil and does not\r\nbecome a nuisance. Make sure that the well is not in line with the water\r\nsupply of the camp. A little potash or some washing soda dissolved in the\r\nsink will help to keep the drain clean.\r\n\r\nPlace barrels in different parts of the camp for refuse and scraps. A coat\r\nof whitewash or white paint will make them conspicuous. In one camp the\r\nfollowing suggestive bit of verse was painted on the waste barrels:\r\n\r\nRavenous Barrel\r\n\r\nI am all mouth and vacuum\r\n  I never get enough,\r\nSo cram me full of fruit peels,\r\n  Old papers, trash and stuff.\r\n\r\nEpicurean Barrel\r\n\r\nO, how sorry I feel for a boy\r\n  Who litters clean places with trash,\r\nWho throws away papers and fruit peels\r\n  Which form my favorite hash.\r\n\r\nWaste Barrels\r\n\r\nThese barrels should be set upon two strips of wood placed parallel. This\r\npermits the air to pass beneath the barrel and keeps its bottom from\r\ndecaying by contact with the ground. The barrels should be emptied daily\r\nand the trash burned.\r\n\r\nA dirty, carelessly kept, untidy camp will make discipline and order very\r\ndifficult to attain and the influence will soon be noticed in the careless\r\npersonal habits of the boys. There is an educational and moral value in\r\ncleanliness which is second only to that of good health.\r\n\r\nWater Supply\r\n\r\nDr. Charles E. A. Winslow, the noted biologist, is authority for the\r\nfollowing statement; [Camp Conference, p.61] "The source of danger in\r\nwater is always human or animal pollution. Occasionally we find water\r\nwhich is bad to drink on account of minerals dissolved on its way through\r\nthe ground or on account of passage through lead pipes, but the danger is\r\nnever from ordinary decomposing vegetable matter. If you have to choose\r\nbetween a bright, clear stream which may be polluted at some point above,\r\nand a pond full of dead leaves and peaty matter, but which you can inspect\r\nall around and find free from contamination, choose the pond. Even in the\r\nwoods it is not easy to find surface waters that are surely protected, and\r\nstreams particularly are dangerous sources of water supply. We have now\r\ngot rid of the idea that running water purifies itself. It is standing\r\nwater which purifies itself, if anything, for in stagnation there is much\r\nmore chance for the disease germs to die out. Better than either a pond or\r\nstream, unless you can carry out a rather careful exploration of their\r\nsurroundings, is ground water from a well or spring; though that again is\r\nnot necessarily safe. If the well is in good sandy soil with no cracks or\r\nfissures, even water that has been polluted may be well purified and made\r\nsafe to drink. In a clayey or rocky region, on the other hand,\r\ncontaminating material may travel for considerable distance under ground.\r\nEven if your well is protected below, a very important point to look after\r\nis the pollution from the surface. I believe more cases of typhoid fever\r\nfrom wells are due to surface pollution than to the character of the water\r\nitself. This is a danger which can, of course, be done away with by\r\nprotection of the well from surface drainage, by seeing that the surface\r\nwash is not allowed to drain toward it and that it is protected by a tight\r\ncovering from the entrance of its own waste water. If good water cannot be\r\nsecured in any of these ways, the water must be purified. It has been said\r\nthat what we desire in water supply is innocence and not repentance; but\r\nif you cannot get pristine innocence, you can, at least, secure works meet\r\nfor repentance and make the water safe, by filtering through either a\r\nPasteur or a Berkefeld filter--either of those filters will take out\r\nbacteria, while no other filters that I know of will or by various\r\nchemical disinfectants, not any of them very satisfactory--or, best of\r\nall, by boiling, which will surely destroy all disease germs."\r\n\r\nIndians had a way of purifying water from a pond or swamp by digging a\r\nhole about one foot across and down about six inches below the water\r\nlevel, a few feet from the pond. After it had filled with water, they\r\nbailed it out quickly, repeating the bailing process about three times.\r\nAfter the third bailing the hole would fill with filtered water. Try it.\r\n\r\nDrinking Cups\r\n\r\nInsist upon the boys bringing to camp a supply of inexpensive paper cups\r\nor collapsible pocket drinking cups. Filthy and dangerous diseases are not\r\ninfrequently transmitted by the use of a common drinking cup.\r\n\r\nPaper Drinking Cup.\r\n\r\nTake a piece of clean paper about 6 inches square and fold it on the\r\ndotted lines, as shown in Figure 1, so as to make a triangle. Do not use\r\npaper having anything printed on it, as there is danger of poison from the\r\nink. The other folds are made in the dotted lines, as shown in Figure 2.\r\nEach pointed end of the triangle is turned over on one side, as shown in\r\nFigure 3, then the sheets of the remaining points are separated and each\r\none folded down on its respective side. This practical idea is furnished\r\nby R. H. Lufkin in Popular Mechanics for February, 1911.\r\n\r\nBoard of Health\r\n\r\nBoys should be encouraged to cooperate in keeping the camp clean. A Board\r\nof Health may be organized, to be composed of an equal number of boys and\r\ncamp leaders with the camp physician, or director of the camp as chairman.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Paper Drinking Cup]\r\n\r\nThe duties of the board will be to inspect daily the toilets, sinks, and\r\ndrains, the water supply, the garbage disposal and waste barrels; condemn\r\neverything that is unsanitary, and correct all sanitary disorders. The\r\nboard will also arrange for a series of talks upon "Sanitation and\r\nHealth," such as:\r\n\r\nSunshine and Health\r\nJohnnie and the Microbes\r\nDirt and Cleanliness\r\nFresh Air\r\nFlies and Filth\r\nHealth--Its Value and Its Cost.\r\n\r\nHave the boys write essays upon these subjects and give credits or points\r\nfor original interpretation, accuracy of report of talk given, and\r\nobservance and correction of sanitary disorders.\r\n\r\nMaxims\r\n\r\nClean up as you go. Sunshine and dryness are great microbe killers. It is\r\nbetter to keep clean, than to get clean. Dirt, dampness and disease can\r\noften be avoided by decency, dryness and determination. Uncleanness is at\r\nthe root of many of the evils which cause suffering and ill health. Fire\r\nis the best disinfectant. Typhoid fever and cholera are carried by dirty\r\nhabits, by dirty water and dirty milk.\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\nCamp Sanitation-Review and Herald Pub. Assn., Washington, D. C. 6 cents.

A boy must learn to sleep under the open sky\r\nand to tramp ten miles through the rain if he wants to be strong. He must\r\nlearn what sort of men it was who made America, and he must not get into\r\nthis fuss and flurry of our American civilization and think that patent\r\nleather shoes and white kid gloves are necessary for the salvation of his\r\nlife.--Edward Everett Hale.\r\n\r\nSelecting a camp site and general directions for the laying out of the\r\ncamp grounds is treated very fully in the chapter on Camp Sanitation, so\r\nthat this chapter will be devoted to methods that to the experienced\r\ncamper may seem trite, but which the novice will appreciate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Laying Out a Camp]\r\n\r\nAdvance Party\r\n\r\nIf the camp is a large one it is usually customary to send an advance\r\nparty several days ahead to erect the tents and get the camp in readiness\r\nfor the larger party. The successful management of a camp depends very\r\nmuch upon placing the tents in such a position as to give plenty of room\r\nand yet be compact. When tents are scattered the difficulty of control is\r\nincreased. The above diagram is a suggestion for the laying out of a camp\r\nwhich provides for room and control.\r\n\r\nPlan of Grounds\r\n\r\nThe following hints will help the advance party to layout the camp in a\r\nsystematic and scientific manner. To find the right angle of the camp\r\nsquare, drive a peg at A, another 3 feet distant at B; attach a 5-foot\r\ncord from the peg at B, and a 4 foot cord from the peg at A. The point at\r\nwhich the two cords meet at C, where another peg may be driven in, will be\r\nthe line at right angles to B-A.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Right Angle of Camp Square]\r\n\r\nMeasuring Device\r\n\r\nThe illustrations opposite show a device by which a camp, baseball\r\ngrounds, running track, tennis court or any distance may be quickly and\r\naccurately measured. The first thing to do is to get an inch board and cut\r\na round disc (a) about 12 inches in diameter. Cut two of them and tack\r\nthem together. The diagram "b" is easier to cut out and will serve the\r\npurpose just as well. When the two are temporarily tacked together, bore a\r\nhole through the centre for the axle. The eight spokes should be of light\r\nmaterial and not too pointed or they will sink in the ground and prevent\r\naccuracy. The spokes are tacked on one disc as shown in "c" and then the\r\nother disc is nailed on the outside.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Measuring Device]\r\n\r\nPaint the end of one spoke red, so that you can count it every time it\r\ncomes around. By having the points that touch the ground exactly 9 inches\r\napart, one revolution of the wheel will measure six feet. For an axle use\r\na small piece of broom handle, and for a handle use a long light pole. By\r\nvarying the length of the spokes you can make the wheel measure any\r\ndesired distance.\r\n\r\nWall Tent\r\n\r\nThe line of the camp having been laid out, the next thing is the erection\r\nof the tents. The best way of setting up a wall tent (either the 12 x 14\r\nor 14 x 16 size), the type used in most of the boys\' camps, is the method\r\nused by the army and described in Kephart\'s "Book of Camping and\r\nWoodcraft." Four boys or men proceed as follows: Nos. 1 and 2 procure\r\ncanvas, and Nos. 3 and 4 the poles.\r\n\r\nNos. 3 and 4 lay the ridge pole on the ground, in the direction that the\r\ntent is to stand; then lay the uprights at each end of ridge-pole and at\r\nright angles to it, on the side opposite that from which the wind blows.\r\nThen drop the tent pins and hammers at their respective ends of the tent;\r\nthen drive a pin at each end of the ridge to mark front and rear.\r\nMeanwhile Nos. 1 and 2 unroll the tent and spread it out over the\r\nridge-pole and on both sides of it.\r\n\r\nNos. 1 and 3 now go to the rear, and Nos. 2 and 4 to the front, and slip\r\nthe pins of the uprights through the ridge-pole and tent. If a fly is\r\nused, it is placed in position over the tent, and the loops of the long\r\nguys over the front and rear pole pins. No. 4 secures center (door) loops\r\nover center pin in front, and No. 1 in rear. Each goes to his corner, No.\r\n1 right rear, No. 2 right front, No. 3 left rear, No. 4 left front.\r\n\r\nAll draw bottom of tent taut and square, the front and rear at right\r\nangles to the ridge, and fasten it with pins through the corner loops,\r\nthen stepping outward two paces from the corner, and a pace to the front\r\n(Nos. 2 and 4) or rear (Nos. 1 and 3) each securely sets a long pin, over\r\nwhich is passed the extended corner guy rope. Care must be taken that the\r\ntent is properly squared and pinned to the ground at the door and four\r\ncorners before raising it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Shelter Tents, Seton Tepee, Tent Made Of A "Fly", Wall\r\nTent]\r\n\r\nNos. 1 and 3 now go to the rear, and Nos. 2 and 4 to the front pole, and\r\nraise the tent to a convenient height from the ground, when Nos. 2 and 3\r\nenter and seize their respective poles, and all together raise the tent\r\nuntil the upright poles are vertical. While Nos. 2 and 3 support the\r\npoles, Nos. 1 and 4 tighten the corner guys, beginning on the windward\r\nside. The tent being thus temporarily secured, all set the guy pins and\r\nfasten the guy ropes, Nos. 1 and 2 to the right, Nos. 3 and 4 left, and\r\nthen set the wall pins.\r\n\r\nTo prevent the upright poles from sinking in the ground under the pressure\r\nof the canvas, place a flat stone or piece of wood under the pole.\r\n\r\nGuying the Tent\r\n\r\nOne of the troubles with tents is their remarkable proclivity for\r\ntightening and slackening with the varying conditions of the weather. This\r\nmeans a constant loosening or tightening of the guy ropes, and the longer\r\nthe guy ropes the more they will shrink or stretch according as they are\r\nwet or dry. This may be overcome to some extent by using very heavy corner\r\nposts securely driven into the ground and spiking a pole across them, and\r\nvery short guy ropes fastening to this pole. (See page 47.) A shower, or\r\neven ordinary dew, will cause the canvas to shrink, therefore be sure to\r\nslacken the guys, or you may have a torn tent or broken ridge pole.\r\n\r\nTrenching\r\n\r\nDig a trench around the tent and do it before you have to. If you have\r\never gotten out in the middle of the night when the rain was coming down\r\nin torrents, to dig a ditch or trench, you will appreciate this bit of\r\nadvice.\r\n\r\nWarn the boys not to touch the roof of the tent on the inside when it is\r\nraining, for it will surely leak wherever it is touched.\r\n\r\nThere is a right and a wrong way of driving stakes into the ground. Study\r\nillustrations, p. 47.\r\n\r\nPeg Wisdom\r\n\r\nIn taking down the tent, don\'t pound loose the tent pins or pegs, but with\r\na looped  rope and a pull in the direction from which they are driven they\r\ncan easily be removed.\r\n\r\nConveniences\r\n\r\nAfter pitching your tent, put everything in order. Run a stout line,\r\neither of rope or rustless wire, between the two upright poles, about a\r\nfoot below the ridge pole. A very convenient thing to throw clothes over.\r\nIn some camps they have a shelf suspended from the ridge pole, divided\r\ninto compartments, one for each boy in the tent. Nails driven in the\r\nupright poles afford convenient pegs to hang things on. Be sure the nails\r\nare removed before taking down the tent or a rip in the canvas will be the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nA bundle of elder leaves in a tent will keep away flies. If ants show a\r\ndesire to creep into your tent, dust cayenne pepper into their holes and\r\nthey will no longer trouble you.\r\n\r\nWhen there is no wooden floor in the tent, strew small hemlock twigs. They\r\nmake a fine carpet and the odor is both pleasant and healthful.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the different styles of tents shown in the illustrations on\r\npage 43, the following description of how to make a ten-foot teepee is\r\ngiven by Charles R. Scott in his Vacation Diary:\r\n\r\nMaking a Teepee\r\n\r\nSew canvas together making oblong ABCD 20 by 10 feet; with E as centre and\r\nEA as a radius, draw half-circle AFD. From remaining canvas cut smoke\r\nflaps LKCM and ONBP. Sew piece of canvas at C and B making pocket for ends\r\nof smoke poles. Sew ML to HI and PO to GJ on one large piece of canvas.\r\nSew lash to E to tie teepee to pole. Sew 6 or 7-foot lash to K and N to\r\nset smoke flaps with. Make holes in pairs from L to D and O to A for\r\nlacing pins. Ten poles 12 feet long are needed. Make tripod of nine of\r\nthese and tie teepee at E to pole two feet from top and place over tripod.\r\n\r\nIn "Recreation," April, 1911, in an article on "Tent Making Made Easy," H.\r\nJ. Holden tells how to make ten different tents with but one piece of\r\ncanvas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Ten Foot Teepee]\r\n\r\nTent Wisdom\r\n\r\nThe best type of tent to use in a permanent camp is a wall tent, either 12\r\nx 14 or 14 x 16, which will accommodate from four to six fellows. An eight\r\nounce, mildew-proofed duck, with a ten or twelve ounce duck fly will give\r\nexcellent wear. Have a door at each end of the tent and the door ties made\r\nof cotton cord instead of tape. Double pieces of canvas should be sewed in\r\nall the corners and places where there is unusual strain. Manilla rope is\r\nbest for guys, and metal slides are preferable to wood. If the tents are\r\nmade to order, have a cotton cord about two feet long sewed in each seam\r\njust under the eaves, so that one end shall hang down inside the tent and\r\nthe other outside. The walls of the tent can then be rolled up and tied so\r\nthat the tent will be thoroughly aired. Make sure that the end of the\r\nridge pole and of the upright poles have iron bands to prevent splitting\r\nof the poles.\r\n\r\nBed on Ground\r\n\r\nFor a short-term camp, pine boughs make the best kind of a bed (see\r\nchapter on Tramps and Hikes for description of bed). Sometimes a rubber\r\nblanket is spread upon the ground and the boys roll themselves up in their\r\nblankets. An old camper gives the following suggestion to those who desire\r\nto sleep in this fashion:\r\n\r\nThe bed should be made in the afternoon while the sun is shining. To make\r\nthe bed, clear the ground of twigs and stones. The space should be about 6\r\nx 3 feet.\r\n\r\nA "Hip Hole"\r\n\r\nA shovelful of dirt is removed, making a shallow, transverse trench, about\r\nmidway of the bed. This trench is the "hip hole" and the making of it\r\nproperly is what renders the bed comfortable. In making the bed the\r\nfollowing order should be observed:\r\n\r\n(1) spread the rubber blanket;\r\n\r\n(2) the blanket spread so that one-half only covers the prepared couch;\r\n\r\n(3) then spread the woolen blankets so that the "hip hole" is in the right\r\nplace;\r\n\r\n(4) add the pillow;\r\n\r\n(5) fold the blankets over you and pin them with big safety pins across\r\nthe bottom and along the side.\r\n\r\nTo Keep Warm\r\n\r\nStewart Edward White in "Camp and Trail" tells how to keep warm when\r\nsleeping on the ground: "Lie flat on your back. Spread the blanket over\r\nyou. Now raise your legs rigid from the hip, the blanket, of course,\r\ndraping over them. In two swift motions tuck first one edge under your\r\nlegs from right to left, then the second edge under from left to right,\r\nand over the first edge. Lower your legs, wrap up your shoulders and go to\r\nsleep. If you roll over, one edge will unwind but the other will tighten."\r\n\r\nA bed tick[1] 6-1/2 feet long and 2-1/2 feet wide, to be filled with\r\ngrass, leaves, straw or any available stuff makes a comfortable bed.\r\n\r\n[Transcribers Footnote 1:  Cloth case for a mattress or pillow or a light\r\nmattress without springs.]\r\n\r\nTo Make a Bed\r\n\r\nA comfortable bed used at Camp Durrell, is made by driving four posts in\r\nthe ground and nailing a frame work of saplings on these posts. Rope is\r\nthen interwoven from side to side in somewhat the fashion of the old-time\r\ncord bed. Pine boughs are then placed "shingle" fashion in the cording,\r\nmaking a very comfortable bed.\r\n\r\nDouble-Deck Bunks\r\n\r\nMany of the long-term camps, however, have cots or bunks with canvas\r\nbottoms. This is the best way to sleep for boys who are going to be in\r\ncamp the entire summer. The following type of double-deck bunk is in use\r\nat Camps Adirondack, Becket, Wawayanda and Dudley. The illustrations give\r\na clear idea of its construction. Use wood as free from knots as possible.\r\nSpruce seems to be the best kind as it is both light in weight and very\r\ndurable. The top section upon which the canvas beds are tacked is bolted\r\nto the uprights which makes a bunk easily taken apart. Three of these\r\nuprights, one at each end and one in the middle, will make a bed section\r\naccommodating four boys, two on the "first floor" and two on the "second\r\nfloor." In this manner eight boys may be comfortably housed in a 12 x 14\r\nor 14 x 16 foot tent, with room for baggage in the center, as shown in the\r\nillustration on page 37.\r\n\r\nBlankets\r\n\r\nAlways remember that to keep warm while sleeping in a cot or bunk, you\r\nmust have as much thickness of blanket under you as above you. Usually\r\nboys will pile blankets on top of them and have only one blanket under\r\nthem and then wonder why they are cold.\r\n\r\nPillows\r\n\r\nA pillow may be made out of a bag of muslin or dark denim and stuffed with\r\na sweater or extra clothing. Much better--take a small pillow with you\r\nwith removable and washable "case" made of dark green or brown denim.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bunk Diagram]\r\n\r\nKitchen Ware\r\n\r\nIn purchasing kitchen ware, a mistake is frequently made by getting a\r\ncheap kind of ware unfitted for the hard usage of camp life. The kind\r\nmanufactured for hotels and restaurants and of sufficient capacity, is\r\nmore expensive, but will outwear two outfits of the cheaper type and is\r\nreally more economical in the long run. In the buying do not omit that\r\nmost adaptable and convenient of all cooking utensils for camp--a wash\r\nboiler. Get one that is copper-lined and made of the heaviest tin.\r\n\r\nTable Ware\r\n\r\nCampers prefer the white enamel ware on account of its appearance and\r\nwear. If the imported kind is purchased it will last for at least three\r\nlong-term seasons. Avoid tin and the cheap gray enamel ware. Each boy\r\nshould be provided with a large plate of the deep soup pattern, cereal\r\nbowl not too large, a saucer for sauce and dessert, a cup, knife, fork,\r\ntable spoon and tea spoon. In a small camp the boy usually brings his own\r\n"eating utensils." When the table is set with white oil cloth, white\r\nenamelled dishes, both serving and individual, with decorations of ferns,\r\nwild flowers or blossoms, the food always seems to taste better and the\r\nmeal proceeds with that keen enjoyment, which is not only conducive to\r\ngood digestion but promotive of good fellowship. A dirty table and dishes\r\nand rough-house table manners are a disgrace to a camp even as small as\r\nsix boys. Cleanliness, courtesy and cheerful conversation contribute to\r\nthe making of character while at meals.\r\n\r\nTable Tops\r\n\r\nTable tops should be made of matched boards and battened. Screw the\r\nbattens[1] to the boards. The tables should be thirty-six inches in width.\r\nThe length must be determined by the number of persons to be seated. The\r\nseating of boys in tent groups is considered the best plan.\r\n\r\n[Transcriber\'s Footnote 1: Narrow strip of wood for flooring.]\r\n\r\nA "Horse" Idea\r\n\r\nA wooden horse made after the following sketch will support the table top\r\nand seats. The seat may be a plank about twelve inches wide and one and\r\none-eighth inches thick.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wooden Horse Table and Seat Support]\r\n\r\nBuildings\r\n\r\nPermanent buildings are largely planned according to the ideas of the\r\ndirector or organization operating the camp and this, therefore, is a\r\nmatter which cannot be fully treated in a book of this character.\r\nConvenience, harmony with natural surroundings, and adaptability are the\r\nthree things which govern the planning and erection of permanent camp\r\nbuildings. "Wilderness Homes," by Oliver Kemp, contains many suggestions\r\nfor camps of this character. In "Recreation" for April, 1911, is an\r\nexcellent article by William D. Brinckle on "Log Cabins."\r\n\r\nSurveying\r\n\r\nThe following practical suggestions on surveying in a boys\' camp have been\r\nespecially prepared by H. M. Allen. Surveying is an important subject for\r\nstudy and practice, as it is both interesting and useful and may serve as\r\na stepping-stone in the later education of the boy.\r\n\r\nThe surveying may be roughly divided into two parts, simple and advanced.\r\nThe simple work includes that which can be carried on with a few cheap\r\ninstruments easily secured or made by the boys. The advanced work requires\r\nbetter instruments and is adapted to high school boys. Only the simple\r\nwork will be described.\r\n\r\nHome-made\r\n\r\nThe instruments needed in simple surveying are, compass, measuring tape,\r\ndraughtsman\'s scale, protractor, drawing materials and a small home-made\r\ntransit. The leader should, if possible, become familiar with some good\r\ntextbook on surveying, such as Wentworth\'s Plane Trigonometry and\r\nSurveying. He should also get some civil engineer to give him a little\r\ninstruction in the rudiments. It is well also to get some practice before\r\ngoing to camp. Any vacant lot or gymnasium floor will be suitable. If the\r\nleader is near a small lake that will be especially desirable.\r\n\r\nThe transit is easily made. A flat board should be selected, about twelve\r\ninches in diameter, which will not warp. Upon this a circle is marked\r\nabout ten inches in diameter. For this purpose use a pair of drawing\r\ncompasses. Then with a protractor lay off the degrees of the circle. A\r\nsmall brass protractor can be bought for 15 cents, a good one, large size,\r\ncosts 80 cents. A good plan is to mark the circle on bristol board [1]\r\nwhich can be tacked in the board. Then a pointed piece of wood ten inches\r\nlong should be fastened with a nail in the center of the circle. At the\r\nends of the pointer pins should be placed vertically so that they are in\r\nline with the pivot nail. This will form a sight for measuring the angles.\r\nThe board is then mounted upon a pointed stick or tripod. You will need a\r\nhatchet and a half dozen sharpened sticks for markers and a boy for rod\r\nman. You are now ready for the survey.\r\n\r\n[Transcribers Footnote 1:  Smooth, heavy pasteboard.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1. Top View of Transit, Protractor, Sighting Pins,\r\nBoard for Circle, Support]\r\n\r\nCamp Survey\r\n\r\nTo make a map of the location of the camp, the first thing is to locate a\r\nbase line on a level piece of ground. At the two ends A and B stakes are\r\nplaced and the length carefully measured with the tape. Then from one end\r\nof the line stretch a string about ten feet long, toward the other stake.\r\nUnder this string place the compass. In this way the direction of the line\r\nmay be learned.\r\n\r\nIn figure 1, the base line runs about 10 degrees west of north. Drive a\r\nstake where the tent is to be located. This place will be called C. Then\r\nplace the transit at A and measure the angle formed by the imaginary lines\r\nAC and AB. In the example the angle is about 45 degrees. Then place the\r\ntransit at B and measure the angle there, formed by the lines AB and BC.\r\nThen the angle at C should be measured and the sum of the angles thus\r\nmeasured will be 180 degrees, if the work is correct.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2, Fig. 3, Fig. 4]\r\n\r\nNow make a drawing of the survey. Draw on paper a line corresponding to\r\nthe line AB, making a certain scale, say 100 feet to the inch. If the real\r\nline is 200 feet long, the line on the paper will be 2 inches. With the\r\nprotractor the angles at B and A may be drawn or plotted. This will give\r\nthe location of the point C. With the scale determine on the plan the\r\nlength of the other sides of the triangle ABC. The actual distances should\r\nnext be measured with the tape to test the accuracy of the survey.\r\n\r\nNext place a stake along the side of the lake at a point D. Then in a\r\nsimilar manner measure the triangle with the transit. With the protractor\r\nthe lines AD and BD can be plotted on the plan. With the scale the length\r\nof the lines AD and BD can be estimated from the map. The rest of the lake\r\nis surveyed in the same manner. It is only necessary to take other points\r\non the lake and survey the resulting triangles. It is a good idea to use\r\nfour-foot stakes with flags placed so as to be easy to sight to them.\r\n\r\nFinally a tracing may be made with carbon paper giving only the shore line\r\nand leaving out the lines of the triangles and the map is finished. The\r\nboys in one camp surveyed a lake a mile long with home-made instruments\r\nwith excellent results.\r\n\r\nBoys should be taught how to use the compass and a map in tracing their\r\nway through an unknown country. Also to travel by the stars or by the moss\r\non the trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V--PERSONAL CHECK LIST OR INVENTORY\r\n\r\nCHECK LIST\r\nMARKING\r\nLOST AND FOUND\r\nMEMORY\r\nHOW TO PACK\r\nSHIPPING\r\nLABELS\r\nNEATNESS\r\nGENERAL HINTS\r\n\r\nExperience only can determine what should be taken to camp. Usually the\r\nfirst camping trip decides what to take on the second trip, and also\r\nreveals how few things, providing they are right things, one really needs\r\nto be comfortable in camp. A boy\'s mother, who is generally the official\r\ntrunk packer of the family, makes a mistake in stowing away in the trunk a\r\nlot of things not serviceable or suitable for camping. Cotton goods,\r\nexcept towels, handkerchiefs, and hose, are of no use. Gray woolen shirts,\r\ngray, brown, or green sweaters (a boon to campers--avoid white, red, or\r\nstriped colors), khaki suit, outing flannel pajamas (tan color preferred)\r\nare in the class of real camp necessities so far as clothing is concerned.\r\nThe hat should be drab or khaki color, of campaign style, something that\r\nwill shed water and sun. The hat used by the Boy Scouts of America is\r\nadmirably adapted for campers.\r\n\r\nThe outfit may be divided into four classes: things necessary, things\r\ndesirable, things convenient, and luxuries. Boys who go camping for two\r\nweeks or less should take articles in the following list marked (1); those\r\nwho go for four weeks or less should take articles marked (2) in addition\r\nto those marked (1); and those who go for what may be called the season,\r\nsix or more weeks, should take those marked (3), in addition to all of (1)\r\nand (2).\r\n\r\nNecessary\r\n\r\nWoolen sweater (coat style) (1)\r\nNote book or diary (1)\r\nTwine and rope (2)\r\nTwo flannel shirts (gray) (1)\r\nLead pencil (1)\r\nChange of underwear (1)\r\nPens and ink (2)\r\nTwo pairs stockings (1)\r\nStamps, stamped envelopes (1)\r\nJersey (2)\r\nOuting flannel pajamas (1)\r\nPaper, postals and envelopes(2)\r\nRunning pants (1)\r\nHandkerchiefs (1)\r\nNeedles and thread (1)\r\nTwo pairs woolen blankets (1)\r\nMatches in metal box (1)\r\nPoncho (1)\r\nFolding drinking cup (1)\r\nTurkish towels (1)\r\nStrong pocket knife on chain(1)\r\nExtra pair heavy shoes (2)\r\nToilet soap (in aluminum or\r\ncelluloid box) (1)\r\nEcho whistle (2)\r\nFishing tackle (2)\r\nComb and brush (1)\r\nCamera (2)\r\nTooth brush and tooth paste(1)\r\nSmall-sized Bible (1)\r\nMoney (1)\r\nPins and safety pins (safeties one-inch and four-inch) (1)\r\nGood disposition (1)\r\nLeggings-tan, army style (1)\r\n\r\nDesirable\r\n\r\nExtra suit of clothes (2)\r\nRubber-soled shoes (sneakers) (1)\r\nSoft laundered shirt (2)\r\nBathing suit or tights (2)\r\nSmall compass (2)\r\nSmall mirror (1)\r\nBaseball, bats, gloves (2)\r\nWhisk broom (2)\r\nTennis racquets and balls (3)\r\nDish towels (2)\r\nPing Pong racquets,  balls (3)\r\nCheap watch (1)\r\nRubber boots or overshoes (2)\r\nMap of vicinity (2)\r\nClothes pins (2)\r\nMusical instruments (2)\r\nFlash lamp (2)\r\nScissors (2)\r\nRepair outfit (2)\r\n\r\nConvenient\r\n\r\nGames (3)\r\nCan opener (2)\r\nBooks (3)\r\nSmall hand washboard (3)\r\nSmall pillow (2)\r\nThick strong gloves (3)\r\nMosquito netting (2)\r\nHeavy woolen stockings (3)\r\nCandles (3)\r\nElk hide moccasins (3)\r\n\r\nLuxuries\r\n\r\nBath robe (3)\r\nBlacking and brush (3)\r\nShaving outfit (3)\r\nLaundry bag (2)\r\nFace rag (3)\r\n\r\nIt is understood that cooking utensils; tools, tents, cots and the general\r\ncamp equipment is supplied by the camp management. The above list is for\r\nthe individual campers.\r\n\r\nMark Everything\r\n\r\nMark everything with your initials, or, if in a large camp, your camp\r\nnumber. This may be done with indelible ink upon white tape, and the tape\r\nsewed upon the garments, or you may order through the large department\r\nstores your full name embroidered on tape in sufficient quantity to sew\r\nupon your belongings. Marking your "goods and chattels" helps identify\r\nownership, for things somehow get fearfully mixed up in a boys\' camp.\r\n\r\nA clever scheme for locating lost articles was adopted by one large camp.\r\nA "Lost and Found" shop was opened. Articles found were brought to the\r\nshop. Hours for identification and reclaiming were announced, the owner\r\npaying two cents for each article claimed. This method had the effect of\r\nmaking the boys more systematic and less careless in throwing things\r\naround, or leaving them upon the ground after a ball game or play. After a\r\ncertain length of time, an auction was held of all unclaimed articles. The\r\nmoney received was put into books for the camp library.\r\n\r\nWrite it Down\r\n\r\nMake your "check list" during the winter. Have an old box handy in which\r\nto put things you think you will want to take to camp. Boys usually talk\r\nover the experiences of the last camp until about January 1st, then they\r\nbegin to talk and plan about the next camp. As you think of things jot\r\nthem down in a little memorandum book marked "Camp Ideas." Leaders will\r\nfind this plan especially helpful. In making up the list, put down each\r\narticle on a separate line. Don\'t jumble things together. Leave nothing to\r\nmemory which, alas, too frequently is a splendid "forgetter." Write it\r\ndown on paper. Examine your list very carefully, and strike out everything\r\nyou can do without. Simplicity coupled with comfort should be the guide in\r\nmaking up the list or inventory. Tack the list on the inside of your trunk\r\nor camp box. Often the little trifles prove the most valuable things on a\r\ncamping trip. For instance, a supply of giant safety pins is invaluable\r\nfor pinning blankets together in sleeping-bag fashion. Ever roll out of\r\nyour blankets or toss them off on a cool night? If so, you know the value\r\nof a giant safety pin.\r\n\r\nWhat to pack the outfit in and how to pack it is a problem which each must\r\nsolve for himself. A cracker box, with hinged cover, padlock, and rope\r\nhandles, is good for a short-time camping trip. It should be of the\r\nfollowing dimensions: 30 x 18 x 15 inches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Camp Box]\r\n\r\nA good strong steamer trunk is about the best thing. It is convenient,\r\neasy to handle, and takes up very little space.\r\n\r\nThe boys who are mechanically inclined, will want to have the fun of\r\nmaking a camp box. The illustration is a suggestion successfully worked\r\nout by a number of boys. The dimensions may be determined by the maker.\r\nDon\'t make it too big, or it will be a burden and also occupy too much\r\nroom in the tent. It stands upright and serves as a dresser. Boys who\r\nspend a summer in camp should have either a steamer trunk or this dresser.\r\n\r\nIf the trunk or box is too small to carry blankets, a good plan is to roll\r\nblankets, bedding and such articles in a roll or canvas, the ends and\r\nsides of which are doubled inward, so as to prevent articles from dropping\r\nout or getting wet. Strap with a good shawl or strong rope. (See\r\nillustration.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Blanket Roll.]\r\n\r\nA dunnage[1], duffle, or carry-all bag is sometimes used for packing, but\r\nthere is a possibility of a "mess" as well as a loss of your good\r\ndisposition and patience in trying to locate some desired article.\r\n\r\nCarry your poncho to be used in case of rain en route.\r\n\r\n[Transcriber\'s Footnote 1:  Personal baggage.]\r\n\r\nShipping\r\n\r\nHave your expressman deliver your baggage at the station at least one hour\r\nbefore the train starts. If the baggage is delayed, much annoyance and\r\nloss of temper is the result. If the camp is a large one, some one should\r\nbe designated to look after the baggage arrangements. After checking the\r\nbaggage, this person should receive checks and attend to claiming baggage\r\nat destination.\r\n\r\nMany of the large camps provide mucilaged labels or "stickers" to paste on\r\nthe end of the trunk or box making identification easy at railroad baggage\r\nroom. Initials and camp number should be painted on outside of trunk or\r\nbox.\r\n\r\nNeatness\r\n\r\n"A place for everything and everything in place" should be the real key to\r\nfind things in your trunk. Neatness is good discipline for the mind, and\r\nshould characterize every real camper. The trunks of some boys in camp\r\nlook as if a cyclone had struck them. "Full, pressed down, and running\r\nover." Every old thing in any old way is both slovenly and unhygienic.\r\n\r\nAbout once a week everything should be taken from the trunk or box, and\r\nexposed to the sun. Let the sun also get into the trunk or box. Then\r\nrepack neatly. This will prevent mould and dampness, and be the means of\r\ndiscovering lost articles. Finally be sure to go over with care your\r\n"check list" or inventory the day before camp breaks. This will prevent\r\nrushing around excitedly at the eleventh hour, hunting lost articles.\r\n\r\nGENERAL HINTS\r\n\r\nGray and khaki are the most inconspicuous colors for camping.\r\n\r\nShirts should be provided with breast pockets.\r\n\r\nEach lock should have a duplicate key to be given to the tent leader, or\r\nin a large camp, to the camp banker.\r\n\r\nHave an old laundry bag in which to put soiled clothes. "Wash day" is a\r\npopular day in many camps. No camper need be dirty when there is abundance\r\nof water.\r\n\r\nThere is a luxuriance in a piece of soap and a clean towel that only\r\nexperienced campers can understand and appreciate.\r\n\r\nWet towels, swimming suits or tights should not be placed in the trunk or\r\nbox, but hung upon a rope, or non-rust wire outside of the tent.\r\n\r\nThe poncho is the camper\'s friend. It makes a good rubber blanket, a wrap,\r\na cushion, a bag, a sail or a tent.\r\n\r\nBe sure to take enough bed clothes. You will need them on cold nights.\r\n\r\nStamps wiped over the hair of your head will not stick together--the oil\r\nof the hair does the trick. Take a self-filler fountain pen--no glass\r\nfiller to break.\r\n\r\nA small Williams or Colgate shaving stick box, with screw or hinged cover,\r\nmakes a good match box. A better one is a water-tight hard rubber box,\r\nwith screw top. If dropped into a lake or stream it will float, whereas a\r\nmetal box will sink.\r\n\r\nSome one has said that "Good temper is as necessary for camping as water\r\nis for swimming." Be sure it is on your "check list."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Personal Labels]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI--ORGANIZATION, ADMINISTRATION AND DISCIPLINE\r\n\r\nA RECOGNIZED LAW\r\nCOOPERATIVE SELF-GOVERNMENT\r\nCOUNCIL MEETINGS\r\nDEPARTMENT ADMINISTRATION\r\nRULES\r\nDISCIPLINE BY WHISTLE\r\nDISCIPLINE BY CONSCIENCE\r\nSELF IMPOSED DISCIPLINE\r\nSEVEN THINGS WHICH GOD HATES\r\nLIARS AND SNEAKS\r\nA "MEDITATION LOG" AND OTHER METHODS\r\nPRIVATE TALKS\r\nPERFECT FREEDOM\r\n\r\nThe heavens themselves, the planets and this centre\r\nObserve degree, priority and place,\r\nInsisture, course, proportion, season, form,\r\nOffice and custom, in all lines of order.\r\n-Troilus and Cressida. Act 1, Scene 3.\r\n\r\nOrder\r\n\r\nIt matters very little if the camp be a large or small one, all will agree\r\nthat system and organization must prevail if the camp is to be a "place of\r\nknown delight and proved desire." Order is said to be Heaven\'s first law,\r\nand a boys\' camp should not be operated contrary to this recognized law.\r\nWhat is everybody\'s business usually becomes nobody\'s business. Much soup\r\nhas been spoiled by the stirring of too many cooks.  A boys\' camp becomes\r\na place of discord when everybody takes a hand in "running it." There must\r\nbe one whose word is absolute and final, and who is recognized as the\r\nleader or director of the camp; at the same time the campers should have a\r\nvoice in the government and share in planning and participating in its\r\nactivities. (See chapter on Leadership.)\r\n\r\nThe following charting of organization will explain the "degree, priority\r\nand place" of those who are to be responsible for the administration and\r\nwelfare of the camp.\r\n\r\nCooperative Self-Government\r\n\r\nThis form of organization recognizes maturity, experience, ability,\r\ncooperation, justice and altruistic service. Self-government wholly by the\r\nboys is unwise. There must always be a paternal guidance of hot, impulsive\r\nand indiscriminate youth. Boys desire adult leadership and where a wise\r\ncombination is formed of man and boy working together, there will be found\r\nthe highest type of efficient, wholesome, happy and purposeful camp life.\r\n\r\nCouncil Meetings\r\n\r\nFrequent council meetings should be held. When the senior council,\r\ncomposed of the leaders and director, meet for planning and to discuss the\r\nwork, it should be understood that whatever is said or discussed at the\r\nmeeting, must not be talked over in the presence of the boys, particularly\r\nmatters of discipline, awarding of honors and camp policy. Joint meetings\r\nof the junior and senior councils should be held weekly. Each "tent" is\r\nrepresented on the junior council by electing one of their tent-mates, who\r\nshall present the views of his constituents at council meetings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Camp Organization Chart]\r\n\r\nDepartments\r\n\r\nThe director should have the power of appointing the chairmen or heads of\r\ndepartments, and the chairmen the privilege of selecting associates from\r\nthe two councils. The policy of each department must be ratified by a\r\njoint meeting of the councils before it becomes operative. Prevent\r\nbickering over minor parliamentary details. Keep in mind first, last and\r\nalways, the highest welfare of the camp. Let the "voice of the people" be\r\nheard, yet see that the legislation introduced is in the interest of the\r\nhighest good of the campers. The chart suggests the work of the various\r\ndepartments.\r\n\r\nRULES\r\n\r\nIn all well-organized and purposeful camps for boys, three rules are\r\nconsidered absolutely essential for the safety and welfare of the campers.\r\nThese rules are:\r\n\r\n1. No fire-arms, air-rifles or explosives of any kind allowed.\r\n\r\n2. No one of the party shall enter the water for swimming or bathing,\r\nexcept during the designated period.\r\n\r\n3. No tobacco used in any form.\r\n\r\nEvery boy going to camp agrees, in signing his application, to observe\r\nwhatever rules are decided upon as best for the welfare of all. Boys\r\nshould be trusted and expected to do as the majority think best. There\r\nshould be a happy understanding and mutual confidence existing which\r\nshould make a long list of rules unnecessary. When the boys arrive in\r\ncamp, the director should outline and explain the purpose and policy of\r\nthe camp in kind, but unmistakable terms.\r\n\r\nA camp of a dozen boys and their school teacher, in the White Mountains,\r\nwas operated for three delightful weeks, upon the following "agreement,"\r\nwhich all the boys and their leader signed.\r\n\r\nWe, the members of Camp Bejoyful, do hereby subscribe cheerfully to the\r\nfollowing rules and regulations and will be governed by them while we are\r\nmembers of this camp.\r\n\r\nWe further agree to pay any penalty the other members of the camp may\r\nthink fit to impose upon us for breaking these rules or resolutions.\r\n\r\nWe will not lose our tempers.\r\n\r\nWe will not use any language we would not use in the presence of ladies.\r\n\r\nWe will not tell stories we would not tell or want told to our sisters.\r\n\r\nWe will perform cheerfully any duties our Camp Master asks us to perform.\r\n\r\nWe will at all times respect the rights and feelings of others.\r\n\r\nWe will remember that the command to "Remember the Sabbath day and keep it\r\nholy," is obligatory at all times and in all places.\r\n\r\nThe motto of this camp shall be "Noblesse oblige."\r\n\r\nThe Whistle\r\n\r\nUnless the camp is conducted under the auspices of the Boys\' Brigade or\r\nsome military organization, where boys prefer the military discipline, it\r\nis unwise to introduce it in a camp for boys. The type of discipline to be\r\nused will depend upon the type of leader. Some camps are controlled by the\r\nuse of a whistle. When the attention of the boys is desired, the leader\r\nblows a shrill blast of the whistle and the boys immediately respond by\r\nabsolute silence and await the announcement or whatever the leader or\r\ndirector desires to say to them. Never blow the whistle unless necessary.\r\nSecure first the attention of the boys if you want their interest. Camp\r\nboys become accustomed to continuous blowing of the whistle in the same\r\nmanner that city boys become used to the noise of the street-car gong.\r\nBlow your whistle and wait. Cause for a second blast should be considered\r\nserious.\r\n\r\nConscience\r\n\r\n"In a camp where through the thoughtlessness of a boy a misdemeanor had\r\nbeen committed, the leader explained at the camp fire how mean the action\r\nwas and said that he did not believe there was a boy in camp who, if he\r\nhad realized its contemptible nature, would for one moment have thought of\r\ndoing such a thing. He concluded his remarks by saying, \'If there is any\r\nboy here who knows who did this thing, I earnestly request that he will\r\nkeep it to himself and not breathe the name of the offender to anyone in\r\ncamp.\' Especially did he request that on no account should the offender\'s\r\nname be told to him. There were a few rather red faces about the camp\r\nfire, but the name of the offender was never known and no similar\r\nmisdemeanor occurred while the camp was open.\r\n\r\nSelf-Imposed Discipline\r\n\r\n"In another camp two boys had thoughtlessly violated the understanding\r\nregarding swimming and they spent an hour on the hillside with the leader\r\ndiscussing the situation. After the leader had explained to them his\r\nresponsibility to the parents of each boy in camp and how insecure parents\r\nwould feel if they thought their boys were not being properly taken care\r\nof, he asked them: \'Now, if you were in my place, what would you do with\r\ntwo such fellows?\' And they both replied that they thought the two boys\r\nshould be sent home as an example to the rest of the camp. The leader\r\nagreed with them and the two boys, who had pronounced their own sentence,\r\nleft the next morning for home. That leader has today no better friends\r\namong boys than those two particular fellows." [1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: E. M. Robinson, Association Boys, June, 1902. ]\r\n\r\nSeven Things Which God Hates\r\n\r\nSolomon in his book of Proverbs says, "These six things does the Lord\r\nhate: yea, seven are an abomination unto him. A proud look, a lying\r\ntongue, and hands that shed innocent blood, a heart that deviseth wicked\r\nimaginations, feet that be swift in running to mischief, a false witness\r\nthat speaketh lies, and he that soweth discord among brethren." (Proverbs;\r\n16:19.)\r\n\r\nLiars and Sneaks\r\n\r\nPunish the liar heavily. Help the boy to see that to make a mistake and\r\nown up to it, is regarded in a much more favorable light than to sneak and\r\nlie out of it. Have him understand that the lie is the worst part of the\r\noffence. It is awful to have the reputation of being a liar, for even when\r\na boy does tell the truth nobody believes him because of his past\r\nreputation. Never indulge suspicion. Above all discountenance sneaking;\r\nnothing is more harmful than to maintain a feeble discipline through the\r\nmedium of tale-bearing.\r\n\r\nNever keep a boy in camp who is out of tune with the camp life or its\r\nstandards, and whose presence only serves to militate against the real\r\npurpose of the camp. "Grouchitis" is a catching disease.\r\n\r\nMeditation Log\r\n\r\nThe methods of punishment are as varied as the colors of the rainbow. In\r\none camp, a "Meditation Log," upon which the boy sits and thinks, and\r\nthinks, and thinks, and--. No doubt he is a sadder and wiser boy for his\r\nperiod of meditation. A "wood pile" where boys saw from one to five or\r\nmore sticks of cord wood into stove lengths, is an economic mode of\r\npunishment, for it not only provides wood for the kitchen stove, but\r\nhardens the boys\' muscle as well as helps him to remember his mistakes and\r\nto avoid repetition. Walking around the campus for a certain length of\r\ntime carrying an oar over the shoulder, is another method. Curtailing a\r\nboy\'s privileges, such as swimming, boating, taking away his dessert, are\r\nother methods in vogue in boys\' camps. When a boy swears, if he is a\r\n"scout," the other "scouts" pour a cup of cold water down the offender\'s\r\nsleeve or back, for each offence. Some boys have been cured of swearing by\r\nhaving their mouths washed out with "Welcome Soap," publicly, along the\r\nshore of the lake or stream, with camp-mates as silent spectators. Make\r\nthe "punishment fit the crime," but always the kind of punishment which\r\nthe boy will acknowledge is deserved and just. Never punish in anger.\r\n\r\nPrivate Talks\r\n\r\nA "heart-to-heart" talk with the boy during a walk in the woods, or in\r\nsome quiet place of the camp, will do more good to get him to see and\r\nrealize his need of adjustment to camp life and enlist his willingness to\r\ntry again and to "do his best" than any form of physical punishment.\r\n\r\nWhen it becomes necessary to send a boy home, always telegraph or write\r\nhis parents, telling them on what train or boat they may expect him and\r\nthe reason for sending him home.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Raising the Flag--Camp Kineo.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII--THE DAY\'S PROGRAM\r\n\r\nA MORNING PRAYER\r\nREQUISITES OF A CAMPER\r\n7.00,       "REVEILLE"\r\n7.15,        THE DIP\r\n7.30,        BREAKFAST\r\n8.30,        CAMP DUTIES\r\n9.30 TO 11,  EDUCATIONAL RECREATION\r\n11,          "BLANKETS IN"\r\n11.30,       SWIMMING TIME\r\n12,          NOON INSPECTION\r\n12.30,       DINNER\r\n12.45 TO 2,  "SIESTA"\r\n2 TO 4.30,   SPORTS\r\n4.30,        PREPARATION FOR THE NIGHT\r\n5,           GENERAL INSPECTION\r\n5.45,        "COLORS"\r\n6,           SUPPER\r\n6.45,        MEDITATION AND STUDY\r\n7.15,        CAMPUS GAMES\r\n8,           CAMP FIRE AND ENTERTAINMENT\r\n8.45,       "TATTOO" AND HYMN\r\n9,          "TAPS"  AND "GOOD NIGHT"\r\n\r\nA Morning Prayer\r\n\r\nThe day returns and brings in the petty round of irritating concerns and\r\nduties. Help us to play the man, help us to perform them with laughter and\r\nkind faces. Let cheerfulness abound with industry. Give us to go blithely\r\non our business all the day. Bring us to our resting beds weary and\r\ncontent and undishonored, and grant us in the end the gift of sleep.\r\n--Robert Louis Stevenson.\r\n\r\nRequisites\r\n\r\nAll the major habits of life are formed during the teen period of life. If\r\ncamping teaches a boy anything it teaches him the habit of being\r\nsystematic. The day\'s program should be built upon a platform calculated\r\nnot only to keep the camp running smoothly, but to develop within the boy\r\nand man those qualities requisite for a good camper, viz., truth,\r\nsincerity, self-control, courage, energy, skill, mental capacity, justice,\r\npatriotism, stamina, efficiency, executive power, consideration,\r\nkindliness, cheerfulness, self-reliance, good temper, good manners, tact,\r\npromptness, obedience, helpfulness, and cooperation. Camping has as good\r\nan effect on a boy\'s character as it has upon his health. It teaches him\r\nto be self-reliant, to look after his own wants, and not to be abnormally\r\nself-centered. It is marvellous how much more tidy and considerate a boy\r\nbecomes after he has had a season in camp, looking after himself and his\r\nown belongings, as well as sharing in keeping his tent neat and clean, and\r\nhaving his part in the day\'s work. From "reveille" at 7 A.M. to "taps" at\r\n9 P.M. the day\'s program should be definitely planned. In order to make\r\nthis chapter of practical value the different periods of the day and its\r\nactivities will be described very fully and enough suggestions given to\r\nmake the day purposeful, educational, recreational and attractive in\r\neither a large or small camp.\r\n\r\nSeven o\'clock is usually the hour of beginning the day, although some\r\ncamps make the rising hour six-thirty o\'clock. The first morning in camp\r\nboys want to get up around four o\'clock, thinking it about three hours\r\nlater, on account of the sun streaming into their tent. After the first\r\nmorning boys who wake early should be expected to keep silent and remain\r\nin their tent until "reveille" sounds. Consideration should be shown\r\ntoward those who desire to sleep.\r\n\r\n7.00\r\n\r\nWhen the bugle sounds "reveille" everybody turns out in pajamas or\r\nswimming tights and indulges in a brisk ten-minute setting-up exercise.\r\nThis should be made snappy, giving particular attention to correcting\r\nstooping shoulders and breathing. Boys should not be excused from this\r\nexercise unless ill. At the end of the exercise the flag is raised and the\r\ncampers salute the stars and stripes as they are flung to the morning\r\nbreeze. A small cannon is fired in some camps when the flag is raised. The\r\nhonor of raising the flag may be given to the boys of the tent having won\r\nthe honor tent pennant of the preceding day or to boys specially assigned.\r\nThe spirit of patriotism is fostered by respect to the flag.\r\n\r\n7.15\r\n\r\nFlag-raising is followed by a dip in the lake. It should be understood\r\nthat this is to be a dip or plunge and not a swim. Five minutes is\r\nsufficient time to be in the water. Place some responsible person in\r\ncharge of the dip. A safe rule is never to permit boys in the water unless\r\nsupervised. The boys should take soap, towels and tooth brushes with them\r\nwhen they go for the dip. A good morning scrub of the teeth with a brush\r\nsaves many hours of pain. Boys are woefully negligent (because ignorant)\r\nof the care of their teeth. Saturday is "scrub" day in many of the large\r\ncamps when all are required to take a "soap scrub." Marvellous how the\r\n"tan" disappears after this scrubbing period!\r\n\r\n7.30\r\n\r\nBy this time every fellow is hungry enough to devour whatever food is set\r\nbefore him, whether he is fond of it or not, and there is an alacrity of\r\nresponse to the Mess Call of the bugle which only a camper understands and\r\nappreciates. When the campers are seated there is either silent or audible\r\ngrace before the meal is eaten. Take plenty of time for the eating of the\r\nmeal. Forty-five minutes is not too long. Encourage wholesome conversation\r\nand good natural pleasantry, but discountenance "rough house" and\r\nungentlemanliness. The announcements for the day are usually given at the\r\nbreakfast table followed by the reading of a chapter from the Bible and a\r\nshort prayer.\r\n\r\n8.30\r\n\r\nA boy should be taught that all labor is noble, that "no one can rise that\r\nslights his work" and the "grand business in life is not to see what lies\r\ndimly at a distance, but to do what lies clearly at hand." With this kind\r\nof a spirit, blankets are taken out of the tent to be aired and the sides\r\nof the tent tied up, the camp is cleaned and put in a sanitary condition,\r\nthe tents are put in order, and kitchen work, if part of the boys\' duties,\r\nis attended to. All work should be finished by 9.30. No matter whether the\r\nboy pays twenty dollars a week or three dollars a week for the outing,\r\nlabor of some sort should be a part of his daily life while at camp, for\r\nwhen one gets to love work, his life becomes a happy one. The world\r\ndespises a shirker but honors a worker.\r\n\r\nThe work of the day is sometimes done by tent groups or by boys grouped in\r\nalphabetical order, each group being under a leader whose part is assigned\r\ndaily by the Camp Director (see chapter on Organization). In the writer\'s\r\ncamp, work is considered a great privilege. For instance, if three bushels\r\nof peas must be picked from the camp garden for dinner, a call is made for\r\nvolunteers. From forty to fifty hands will go up and after careful\r\nchoosing, six boys are selected to do this coveted work, much to the\r\ndisappointment of the others. It is all in the way work is presented to\r\nthe boys, whether they will look upon it as a privilege or an irksome\r\ntask.\r\n\r\n9.30 to 11.00\r\n\r\nIf tutoring is a part of the camp\'s plan, the morning will be found a\r\ndesirable time for tutor and boy to spend an hour together. Manual\r\ntraining, instruction in woodcraft, field and track athletics, boating,\r\nlife-saving drills, rehearsal for minstrel shows or entertainments,\r\nphotography, tennis, baseball, are some of the many activities to be\r\nengaged in during this period. One day a week, each box or trunk should be\r\naired, and its contents gone over carefully. A sort of "clean up" day.\r\n\r\n11.00\r\n\r\nAbout this time the Life Saving Crew will be getting ready for their drill\r\nand patrolling of the swim. The other campers will be taking in their\r\nblankets and after shaking them well and folding, will place them on their\r\nbeds for the inspection, which usually comes at noon. At 11.20 boys who\r\ncannot swim should be given instruction by those who can swim. If this is\r\ndone before the regular swim there is less danger and greater progress is\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n11.30\r\n\r\nThis seems to be the popular hour for swimming in nearly all the camps. It\r\nfollows the ball game, the tennis match, the camp work, and usually the\r\ntemperature of air and water is just right for a swim. Allow no swimmer to\r\ngo beyond the line of patrol boats. Have some one on shore who is keen to\r\nobserve any boy who may be in need of assistance.\r\n\r\nTwenty minutes is sufficient length of time to be in fresh water. When the\r\nboys come out of the water, have a towel drill, teaching the boy how to\r\nuse the towel so that his back may be dried as well as every other part of\r\nhis body. This rubbing down induces circulation of the blood and gives\r\nthat finish to a swim which makes the boy feel like a new being. It is\r\nunwise to permit boys to lie around undressed after a swim, for\r\nphysiological as well as moral reasons. Swimming tights should be wrung\r\nout dry, either by hand or by a wringer kept near the swimming place, and\r\nhung out on a rope or rustless wire, stretched back of the tent. Do not\r\npermit wet clothes to be hung in the tent, on the canvas or tent ropes.\r\n\r\n12.00\r\n\r\nBeds or bunks should be made up for inspection. Three men or boys may be\r\nappointed as inspectors. Considerable interest and pride is taken by the\r\nboys in having their canvas home look neat. This training in neatness,\r\norder and cleanliness is invaluable. (See chapter on Awards.) The\r\ninspection should not take over twenty minutes. While this is going on\r\nthose who have kitchen or table duty will be busily engaged getting tables\r\nin readiness for dinner.\r\n\r\n12.30\r\n\r\nMess call for dinner. This meal should be the heartiest meal of the day,\r\nand plenty of time given to the eating of the food. Mail is usually given\r\nout at this meal in camps where there is but one delivery a day.\r\n\r\n1.15, "Siesta."\r\n\r\n"Siesta," or rest hour, follows dinner. In the early days of boys\' camps\r\nthis suggestion would have been laughed at, but today it is looked upon as\r\nhighly hygienic and considered one of the best things of camp and strongly\r\nto be commended. The boy is advised to lie down flat on his back, in his\r\ntent or under the shade of a friendly tree, and be quiet. He may talk if\r\nhe wishes, but usually some one reads aloud to his fellows. This gives the\r\nfood a chance to digest, and the whole body a nerve and muscle rest before\r\nthe active work of the afternoon.\r\n\r\n2.00 to 4.30\r\n\r\nThese hours will be spent in various ways. Usually it is the time for\r\nathletic sports, baseball games, quoit[1] tournaments, tennis tournaments,\r\nexcursions afield, boat regatta, archery, water sports, scouting games and\r\nother activities in which most of the campers can engage. The big outdoor\r\nevents should occupy this time of the day.\r\n\r\n[Transcriber\'s Footnote 1: Flat rings of iron or rope are pitched at a\r\nstake with points for encircling it. A ring used in this game.]\r\n\r\n4.30\r\n\r\nWhere daily inspection is a part of the camp plan the boys will begin\r\ngetting everything in readiness for that important event. A general bustle\r\nof activity will be in evidence and every boy on the qui vive[2] to have\r\nhis tent win the coveted honor pennant, usually given for the neatest\r\ntent,\r\n\r\n[Transcriber\'s Footnote 2: Sentinel\'s challenge. On the alert; vigilant.]\r\n\r\n5.00\r\n\r\nInspection is conducted during the absence of the boys. While the\r\ninspectors are making the round of tents, the boys should assemble either\r\nin the permanent building of the camp or under some big tree, to listen to\r\na practical talk by the camp physician, a demonstration in first aid work,\r\nthe reading of a story, or to something equally educational in character.\r\nThis is a valuable hour when occupied in this manner. (See chapter on\r\ninspection, awards, etc.)\r\n\r\n5.45\r\n\r\nRather than depend upon "sunset" as the time to lower the flag, it is much\r\nbetter to set an hour for "colors." Promptly at this hour the bugler blows\r\n"colors." No matter where a camper may be he should stand erect, uncover\r\nand remain attentive until after the playing of the "Star Spangled Banner"\r\nand firing of the cannon. The flag is lowered very slowly during the\r\nplaying of the "Star Spangled Banner" and camp should be a place of silent\r\npatriotism. Those who have witnessed this ceremony in a boys\' camp will\r\nnever forget its impressiveness. The flag should never be permitted to\r\ntouch the ground, and should be carefully folded and in readiness for\r\nhoisting the next morning.\r\n\r\n6.00\r\n\r\nSupper hour cannot come too promptly for active boys. The announcement of\r\nthe day\'s inspection should be made at the meal and the honor pennant or\r\nflag presented to the successful tent, and accepted by one of the boys.\r\nThis occasion is usually a time of rejoicing, also a time of\r\nresolve-making on the part of tent groups to "do better tomorrow." The\r\nrecord of each tent is read by one of the inspectors, and at the end of\r\nthe week the tent having the best record gets a special supper or\r\n"seconds" on ice cream day.\r\n\r\n6.45\r\n\r\nAbout this time, with the going down of the sun, nature seems to quiet\r\ndown, and it is the psychological time for serious thought. Many camps\r\ndevote twenty minutes to Bible study (for suggested lessons, see chapter\r\non Religion and Moral Life). Tent groups under their leader study\r\nthoughtfully the meaning of life and the great lessons taught by God\r\nthrough nature. Night after night the boys consciously or unconsciously\r\nacquire through this study the requisites of a good camper mentioned in\r\nthe first part of this chapter.\r\n\r\n7.15\r\n\r\nCampus games, boating, preparation for the bonfire, etc., will occupy the\r\ntime until dark. Every boy should be engaged in some recreative play,\r\nworking off whatever surplus energy he may have at hand so that when the\r\ntime for "turning in" comes, he will be physically tired and ready for\r\nbed.\r\n\r\n8.00\r\n\r\nThe evening program varies. Some nights there will be a minstrel show,\r\nother nights a camp fire, or mock trial, an illustrated talk, or "village\r\nschool entertainment," or a play, or a musical evening or "vo-de-ville."\r\nLeave about two nights a week open. The boys prefer to have occasional\r\nopen evenings when they are free to loaf around, and go to bed early. Plan\r\nthe evening "stunts" very carefully.\r\n\r\n8.45\r\n\r\nThe bugler blows "tattoo"[1] which means "all in tents." After the boys\r\nhave undressed and are ready for bed, the leader reads a chapter from the\r\nBible, and in many camps the boys lead in volunteer prayer, remembering\r\nespecially the folks at home.\r\n\r\n[Transcriber\'s Footnote 1: Signal on a drum or bugle to summon\r\nsoldiers to their quarters at night. Continuous, even drumming or\r\nrapping.]\r\n\r\nFrom a hill near camp, or from a boat on the lake come the notes of a\r\nfamiliar hymn such as "Abide With Me," "Lead, Kindly Light," "The Day is\r\nPast and Over," "Sun of My Soul," or "Nearer, My God to Thee," played by\r\nthe bugler. Every boy listens and the ear records a suggestion which helps\r\nto make the night\'s sleep pure and restful. Try it. Taps played slowly,\r\nfollows the hymn. As the last notes are being echoed upon the still night\r\nair the lights are being extinguished in the tents, so that when the final\r\nprolonged note ends the camp is in darkness and quiet, and all have\r\nentered into a nine-hour period of restoration of body and mind. Who\r\nknows, but God himself, how many of the boys, and even leaders, while\r\nwrapped warmly in their blankets have silently breathed out that old, old\r\nprayer so full of faith, which has been handed down from generation to\r\ngeneration:\r\n\r\n  Now I lay me down to sleep\r\n  I pray Thee Lord my soul to keep.\r\n\r\nA prayer echoed by the camp director, for now is the only time of the\r\nday\'s program when he begins to breathe freely, and is partially able to\r\nlay aside his mantle of responsibility. A cough, a sigh, and even the\r\nmoaning of the wind disturbs this ever vigilant leader and he thinks of\r\nhis charges, until finally, weariness conquers and sleep comes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WELL-ORDERED DAY\r\n\r\nHow shall the day be ordered? To the sage\r\nThe young man spoke. And this was his reply:\r\n\r\nA morning prayer.\r\nA moment with thy God who sends thee dawn\r\nUp from the east; to thank heaven for the care\r\nThat kept thee through the night; to give thy soul,\r\nWith faith serene, to his complete control;\r\nTo ask his guidance still along the way.\r\n  So starts the day.\r\n\r\nA busy day.\r\nDo with a will the task that lies before.\r\nSo much there is for every man to do,\r\nAnd soon the night when man can work no more.\r\nAnd none but he to life\'s behest is true\r\nWho works with zeal and pauses only when\r\nHe stretches forth his hand to help the men\r\nWho fail or fall beside him on the way.\r\n  So runs the day.\r\n\r\nA merry evening.\r\nWhen toil is done, then banished be the care\r\nThat frets the soul. With loved ones by the hearth\r\nThe evening hour belongs to joy and mirth;\r\nTo lighter things that make life fresh and fair.\r\nFor honest work has earned its hour of play.\r\n  So ends the day.\r\n--John Clair Minot in the "Independent"\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nAssociation Boys\' Camps--Edgar M.

Like the figure of Jesus, she stands with\r\nbended head and hands folded upon her breast.--Emerson.\r\n\r\nCamp life should help boys to grow not only physically and mentally, but\r\nmorally. Religion is the basis of morality. The highest instinct in man is\r\nthe religious. Man made the city with all its artificiality, but, as some\r\none has said, "God made the country." Everything that the city boy comes\r\nin contact with is man-made. "Even the ground is covered with buildings\r\nand paving blocks; the trees are set in rows like telegraph poles; the\r\nsunlight is diluted with smoke from the factory chimneys, the moon and\r\nstars are blotted out by the glare of the electric light; and even the\r\nso-called lake in the park is a scooped-out basin filled by pumps. Little\r\nwonder that a boy who grows up under these conditions has little reverence\r\nfor a God whose handiwork he has not seen."[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Walter M. Wood in Association Boys, June. 1907.]\r\n\r\nNature\'s Teachings\r\n\r\nWhen a boy\'s soul is open to the influence of nature he feels the presence\r\nof the divine in the forest. There is an uplift, an inspiration, a joy\r\nthat he never experiences in the city. He does not know how to express\r\nhimself, but somehow he feels the spiritual atmosphere pervading the woods\r\nwhich his soul breathes in as really as his nostrils do the pure air, and\r\nhe is ready to Go forth, under the open sky and list to Nature\'s\r\nteachings.\r\n-Bryant.\r\n\r\nFor as Martin Luther said, "God writes the Gospel not in the Bible alone,\r\nbut in trees and flowers and clouds and stars."\r\n\r\nSunday\r\n\r\nSunday in a boys\' camp should be observed by the holding of a service in\r\nthe morning, with song, scripture reading, prayer and a short talk. The\r\nafternoon is usually occupied by letter writing, Bible study, or reading,\r\nthe day closing with a vesper service in the evening just as the sun is\r\nsetting. Boisterousness should not be encouraged. Unnatural restraint,\r\nhowever, is contrary to the spirit of the day. The day should be different\r\nfrom other days. Many camp boys date their first real awakening to the\r\nbest and highest things in life from a Sunday spent in camp.\r\n\r\nEvery real camper has experienced a Sunday similar to this one described\r\nby Howard Henderson. "A quiet Sunday in the deep woods is a golden day to\r\nbe remembered for many a year. All nature combines to assist the camper in\r\ndirecting his thoughts to the great Author of all the beauty that he\r\nbeholds. \'The heavens declare the glory of God; and the firmament sheweth\r\nhis handiwork.\' The trees under which one reclines rear their heads\r\nheavenward, pointing their spire-like minarets far up toward the\r\nblue-vaulted roof. It inspires the very soul to worship in these unbuilt\r\ncathedrals with wilderness of aisle and pillars, which for elegance and\r\nbeauty have never been equalled by the architects of any age. And the\r\nmusic of the trees combined with the notes of the bird songsters, give a\r\njoy which is unknown in listening to a city choir."\r\n\r\nBible Study\r\n\r\nThe Bible becomes a new book to boys when studied under such an\r\nenvironment. As one boy wrote home to his father after a Sunday spent in a\r\ncamp where Sunday was observed in this manner, "Dad, it is so different\r\nhere, from a Sunday at home; I understood the talk and the Bible study was\r\ngreat; it was a bully day!"\r\n\r\nThe following Bible course was worked out by the author and has been used\r\nin scores of boys\' camps. These lessons were taught to groups of boys at\r\neventide when nature seemed to quiet down and the boys were most\r\nresponsive to good, sensible suggestion. The camp was divided into tent\r\ngroups, each group being taught by their leader or an exchange leader, one\r\ngroup occupying a big rock, another the "Crow\'s Nest," or "Tree House,"\r\nanother getting together under a big tree, another in their tent. No\r\nleader was permitted to take more than twenty minutes for the lesson. It\r\nis unwise to take twenty minutes for what could be said in ten minutes.\r\nThe boys all had a chance to take part in the discussion. Each lesson was\r\nopened and closed with prayer, many of the boys participating in volunteer\r\nprayer. In teaching a lesson don\'t spend too much time in description\r\nunless you have the rare gift of being able to make your scene live before\r\nyour hearers. Talk plainly and to the point. Naturalness should\r\ncharacterize each lesson. Boys hate cant[1] and apologies and lack of\r\ndefiniteness. Your best illustrations will be drawn from the life of the\r\ncamp and from nature.\r\n\r\n[Transcriber\'s Footnote 1: Monotonous talk filled with platitudes.\r\nHypocritically pious language.]\r\n\r\nIn some camps these lessons were taught in the morning directly after\r\nbreakfast, while the boys were seated at the tables.\r\n\r\nThere are "Sermons in stones, and good in every thing," therefore the\r\npurpose of these lessons should be to help boys hear these sermons and\r\nlearn nature\'s lessons of purity, strength and character.\r\n\r\nA COURSE IN BIBLE STUDY\r\n\r\nLESSON 1.

Even Pagans pray, but they pray through fear.\r\n\r\nMore things are wrought through prayer than this world dreams of.\r\n--Tennyson.\r\nPray to Christ as friend to friend. The Lord\'s Prayer.\r\n\r\nHe prayeth well who loveth well\r\nBoth man and bird and beast.\r\nHe prayeth best who loveth best\r\nAll things both great and small,\r\nFor the dear God who loveth us\r\nHe made and loveth all.\r\n--Coleridge\'s "Ancient Mariner."\r\n\r\nStrength received through prayer.

When a boy\r\nbecomes a Christian he should bring to others the same blessing.\r\n\r\nPatience is essential in fishing--same in winning boys to Christ. Every\r\nfisherman expects to catch fish. To lead others to Christ is the noblest\r\nwork in the world. Dan. 12: 3.\r\n\r\nTent Devotions\r\n\r\nIn some camps a bit of Scripture is read each night in the tent just\r\nbefore retiring. The following readings having been prepared by W. H.\r\nWones, C. C. Robinson, Arthur Wilson and Charles R. Scott for use at Camp\r\nWawayanda. Just before taps, if you have a good cornetist, have him go a\r\nshort distance from the camp and play a well known hymn, like "Abide With\r\nMe," "Nearer, My God, to Thee," "Lead, Kindly Light," then play "taps."\r\nThe effect is wonderful, and prevents all inclination toward noise or\r\n"rough house."\r\n\r\nJULY\r\n\r\nTOPIC: VACATION\r\n\r\n1.

Matthew 23:10.\r\n\r\nNovel Bonfire\r\n\r\nThe author experienced something very unusual one Sunday afternoon in a\r\ncamp where he was invited to speak. The talk was on "Trees or Growth," one\r\nof the studies of the course described. During the talk a number of things\r\nwere referred to that enter into the growth of a tree which either mar or\r\nhinder it from becoming a symmetrical, beautiful tree and a similar\r\ncomparison was made regarding a boy\'s growth. The question was asked of\r\nthe boys, "What are some of the things which interfere with a boy\'s growth\r\nphysically, mentally and morally?" A number of things, such as smoking,\r\nswearing, impurity, etc., were given, and finally one of the small boys\r\npiped up "reading dime novels." His answer was received with howls of\r\nderision, especially from the older boys.  "Hold on," I said, "let\'s\r\ndiscuss the matter; if dime novels are good for a boy\'s growth mentally,\r\nwe want to know about it, but if they are detrimental to this particular\r\nkind of desired growth, of course, we want to cut it out." The discussion\r\nbrought out the fact that a number of the boys had smuggled a lot of this\r\nkind of literature into camp and were just loafing through their time in\r\nthe woods, gloating over the wonderful and daring escapades of Wild West\r\nheroes. The boys finally decided that their mental growth was retarded by\r\nsuch reading. Then came the question, "What are you going to do about it?"\r\n"We don\'t usually have a bonfire on Sunday," I said. "I am inclined,\r\nhowever, to ask your leader for a special dispensation and we will have\r\none.\r\n\r\nYou are to furnish the fuel, your leader the kerosene oil and I will\r\nprovide the match. The fuel is to consist of all the dime novels in the\r\ncamp." "Whew!" "I know it will take grit to do this, but it is a test of\r\nyour sincerity and determination to progress along right lines." "We\'re\r\ngame?" yelled the boys, "and we mean business."\r\n\r\nThe start was made for the place where the bonfires were usually held. By\r\nthe time I reached the spot, the boys were coming from their tents with\r\nbundles of novels. Every boy was requested to tear each novel in half and\r\nthrow it upon the heap. When everything was ready, the boys uncovered and\r\nin the silence that came upon the group, the match was struck and the\r\nflames began to leap upward, until finally, all that remained was the\r\nsmall piles of ashes. For the majority of the boys it meant the burning up\r\nof the dross and the beginning of better and nobler thinking. I shall\r\nalways remember this novel bonfire. This is what I mean by making Bible\r\nstudy and camp talks effective.\r\n\r\nReading\r\n\r\nSunday afternoon is the time for reading good, wholesome stories. Take the\r\nboys out into the woods where they can squat under a big tree, or if the\r\nday is warm seek the cool shelter of the tent and while the boys are lying\r\ndown read a short story or several chapters of a story like "Dr.\r\nGrenfell\'s Parish," by Norman Duncan, "Just Boys," by Mary Buell Wood,\r\n"Some Boys I Know," "Chapel Talks," or "The Story of Good Will Farm," by\r\nGeorge W. Hinckley. If the group is made up of older boys who like to\r\ndiscuss life problems, read a chapter or two from Robert Speer\'s excellent\r\nbooks, "A Young Man\'s Questions" and "Young Men Who Overcame." Make sure\r\nthat whatever you read has the uplift note. The real purpose of the\r\nafternoon\'s reading should be that of instilling in the boys\' minds some\r\nof the cardinal virtues of Christian character.\r\n\r\nDon\'t moralize; let the story do its own moralizing. Boys are hero\r\nworshippers. If the hero or the heroic appeal of the story is of a sane\r\ntype and not abnormal there will be created naturally within the boy a\r\ndesire to emulate the good deeds of the hero in the everyday life of the\r\ncamp, which is much better than the parrot-like vocalization unfortunately\r\nmany times encouraged by well-meaning men.\r\n\r\nChapel\r\n\r\nA pile of stones made to serve as an altar or pulpit, a chapel having the\r\nbranches of a friendly pine as its roof and under which are built a\r\nreading desk and seats of white birch, a cathedral with towering columns\r\nof pine and cushions of pine needles, a rocky shore along the ocean--all\r\nare places where boys have heard the appeal for right living and responded\r\nwith an earnest decision that marked an advance step in their moral and\r\nreligious growth.\r\n\r\nMake much of the music at these outdoor services on Sunday. A choir of men\r\nand boys responding in the distance to the hymns of the camp boys, in\r\nantiphonal manner, a cornetist playing a hymn in the distance, make an\r\nimpression never to be forgotten.\r\n\r\nThe great test of camp life is not the fun the boy had, or his gain in\r\nweight, height or lung capacity, or the friendships formed, or his\r\nincreased knowledge in woodcraft, but his advancement in character-making\r\nand gain in spiritual vigor.\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nBOOKS HELPFUL IN THE PREPARATION OF BIBLE STUDY LESSONS:\r\n\r\nLessons from Life (Animal and Human)--Thomas Whittaker.

As long as there is plenty of fun and plenty to eat, he\r\nthinks life is worth living, and he is not so far from the truth, for it\r\nis only when the fun of living dies within us, and our digestive apparatus\r\nrefuses to do its function that we "become of all men most miserable." A\r\nboy will put up with all sorts of inconvenience but rebels at once at poor\r\nfood and bad cooking. The good nature, congenial atmosphere, and\r\ncontentedness of camp life is largely due to good cooking. Economize in\r\nevery other way, but think twice before cheap cooks are employed or a\r\ncheap grade of food purchased.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Where They Eat to Live]\r\n\r\nA good cook will economize, he knows what to do with left-overs and how to\r\nprepare menus of variety. The quantity of swill soon reveals the worth of\r\nthe cook. In a large camp a hundred dollars may easily find its way into\r\nthe garbage can because of cheap cooks and poor food. A growing boy\r\ndemands relatively more of the tissue-building kind of food than a grown\r\nperson, because the body is being built up. When the full stature is\r\nreached the tissue-building part of the food is only required to take the\r\nplace of that worn out each day. Professor Atwater has told us that the\r\nboy of fifteen or sixteen requires ninety per cent of the food ration of\r\nthe adult man engaged in moderate muscular work. Boys at twelve require\r\nseventy per cent.\r\n\r\nVegetables, fruits, cereals, bread, nuts and meats furnish the essentials.\r\nSugar and fat have only part of them. Coffee and tea have no food values\r\nexcept for the milk and sugar added. They tend to check certain normal\r\nsecretion in the body and should not be used during growth.\r\n\r\nFood Charts\r\n\r\nThe United States Department of Agriculture publishes a series of fifteen\r\nfood charts of exceptional value. Leaders and cooks will find them helpful\r\nin providing and planning the food for the boys. Boys will be interested\r\nin the information given and the attractive form of presentation. The set\r\ncosts $1.00. Send to Superintendent of Documents, Washington, D. C. The\r\nfollowing table is a condensation of the facts given on the charts, and\r\nwill help in planning menus:\r\n\r\nPrepared by C. F.

Potatoes and grains furnish\r\nstarches. The starchy foods are heat and force producers. Eggs, meats,\r\nnuts, milk, dried beans, peas and lentils furnish nitrogen, and are flesh\r\nand muscle producers. Butter, oil, lard, and fatty meats supply fats.\r\nSugar, molasses, honey, fruit, etc., furnish sugar.\r\n\r\nStarchy foods should be cooked at a high temperature and either boiled or\r\nbaked; nitrogenous and fatty foods at lower temperature, prolonging the\r\ntime. Meats are much better broiled, roasted, or stewed than fried.\r\nVegetables should be steamed or baked so that the juices may not be\r\nwasted. Veal and pork (except ham and bacon) should have no place in the\r\nmenu of a boys\' summer camp. Both require from four to five hours and\r\nfifteen minutes to digest. Study carefully the above tables and then plan\r\nyour meals intelligently.\r\n\r\nTable of Approximate Weights and Measures\r\nThree teaspoonfuls = one tablespoon.\r\nFour tablespoonfuls = one wine glass.\r\nTwo wine glasses = one gill.\r\nTwo gills = one tumbler or cup.\r\nTwo cupfuls = one pint.\r\nOne quart sifted flour = one pound.\r\nOne quart granulated sugar = one pound, nine ounces.\r\nOne pint closely packed butter = one pound.\r\nThree cupfuls sugar = one pound.\r\nFive cupfuls sifted flour = one pound.\r\nOne tablespoonful salt = one ounce.\r\nSeven tablespoonfuls granulated sugar = one half pint.\r\n                                        Twelve tablespoonfuls\r\nflour = one pint.\r\nThree coffee cupfuls = one quart.\r\nTen eggs = one pound.\r\n\r\nBuying Food\r\n\r\nThe purchase of food is an important item of expense in operating a boys\'\r\ncamp, large or small. If the camp is a large one, one hundred or more\r\nboys, and you have a good-sized refrigerator and storehouse, always\r\npurchase in bulk form from a wholesale firm. Canned goods, such as peas,\r\ntomatoes, corn, and apples, buy in gallon cans in case lots and save cost\r\nof extra tin and labels. Cocoa may be purchased in five-pound cans.\r\nCondensed milk (unsweetened) in 20-ounce cans. Flour and sugar by the\r\nbarrel. Beans by the  bushel. Butter by the firkin[1]. For instance, a\r\ngood heavy 200-pound hind quarter of beef will furnish a roast beef\r\ndinner, a steak breakfast, a meat stew supper, a meat hash breakfast, and\r\na good thick soup full of nourishment from the bones. The suet may be\r\nrendered into lard. There will be no waste, and you get the very best of\r\nmeat. Buy lamb whole and fowl cleaned, and eggs by the crate. Keep an\r\naccurate inventory, also the cost of foods. It will be found interesting\r\nto make a resume of food at the end of each season, listing quantities,\r\ncosts, and amounts used each day and ascertain the actual cost per day for\r\neach boy.\r\n\r\n[Transcriber\'s Footnote 1: About 1/4 of a barrel or 9 gallons (34\r\nliters).]\r\n\r\nThe following "Grocery List" is for a large camp, but it will serve also\r\nto form the basis of providing for small camps:\r\n\r\nCocoa\r\nCoffee\r\nSugar (granulated)\r\nBeans, yellow\r\nBeans, red kidney\r\nTapioca\r\nRice\r\nOatmeal (in bulk)\r\nCornmeal\r\nToasted Corn Flakes\r\nCream of Wheat\r\nShredded Wheat\r\nSalt (table)\r\nSalt (rock)\r\nPepper, black\r\nGinger\r\nCloves\r\nSoda\r\nCinnamon\r\nBaking Powder\r\nCream of Tartar\r\nMagic yeast\r\nRaisins (seeded)\r\nCurrants\r\nFlour\r\nGraham flour\r\nCorn starch\r\nGelatin\r\nFigs\r\nPrunes\r\nEvaporated fruits\r\nCodfish cakes\r\nMacaroni\r\nCrackers\r\nGinger Snaps\r\nPilot Biscuits\r\nExtracts:\r\n  Vanilla,\r\n  Lemon\r\nKitchen Boquet (for gravy)\r\nChocolate cake\r\nLemons\r\nOlive Oil\r\nVinegar\r\nLard\r\nButter\r\nEggs\r\nOnions\r\nPotatoes\r\nSapolio [soap]\r\nGold Dust\r\nLaundry soap\r\nMustard (dry)\r\nMustard (prepared in mugs);\r\nChow Chow\r\nPickles\r\nPiccalilli;\r\nChili Sauce\r\nBacon\r\nHam\r\nDried beef\r\nSalt pork\r\nCheese\r\nMatches\r\nCandles\r\nKerosene oil\r\nLantern wicks\r\nChloride of Lime.\r\n\r\nCANNED GOODS\r\n\r\nCorn; Sliced peaches; Tomatoes; Shredded pineapple;\r\nPeas; Strawberries; Lima beans; Clams (for chowder);\r\nBeets; Condensed milk (unsweetened); Apples; Salmon;\r\nPlums;\r\n\r\nThe Steward\r\n\r\nA reliable person should be in charge of the food supplies. In some camps\r\nhe is called the Steward. He will see that the supply is sufficient,\r\narrange the menus in consultation with the Chef, keep his storeroom neat\r\nand scrupulously clean. As a matter of record and for the purpose of\r\nascertaining cost of feeding the boys, a number of camps keep a daily\r\nrecord like the illustrated form.\r\n\r\nThe Cook\r\n\r\nThe cook is the keynote of happiness or unhappiness. Get a good cook,\r\nprofessionally and morally, one who understands that he is not in camp for\r\na vacation. A capable cook will take care of fifty boys without any\r\nassistance, except what help the boys may render in the preparation of\r\nvegetables. For years two cooks have looked after the meals of 175 to 200\r\nboys in the camps conducted each season by the writer. The wages of the\r\nhead cook or chef range from two to three dollars and fifty cents a day.\r\nSome camps secure cooks from the hotels and restaurants, others from the\r\nlumber camps. No matter where he is secured, be sure that he is clean, in\r\nperson, in habits, and in speech. Do not permit boys to loaf  about the\r\nkitchen. In the planning of menus, food value and variety must be\r\nconsidered.

Every camp should,\r\nif possible, have its own ice-cream freezer, as ice-creams, sherbets, and\r\nwater ices are not only healthy but inexpensive. An occasional delicacy is\r\ndesirable. Canned shredded pineapple, strawberries and sliced peaches make\r\nexcellent sherbets and ice cream. In one camp chicken and ice cream are\r\nserved every Sunday dinner.\r\n\r\nA Sample Week of Menus\r\n\r\nMONDAY\r\n\r\nBREAKFAST\r\nOatmeal\r\nFried potatoes\r\nCocoa\r\nCream of tartar\r\nbiscuits.\r\n\r\nDINNER\r\nIrish stew\r\nBoiled potatoes\r\nGreen corn on cob\r\nApple tapioca\r\nBread and butter.\r\n\r\nSUPPER\r\nFried eggs\r\nPrunes\r\nSweet cake\r\nBread and butter\r\nCocoa.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUESDAY\r\n\r\nBREAKFAST\r\nToasted Cornflakes\r\nFish cakes\r\nCorn bread\r\nCocoa.\r\n\r\nDINNER\r\nBeef steak\r\nMashed potatoes\r\nPeas\r\nCorn starch\r\npudding\r\nBread and butter.\r\n\r\nSUPPER\r\nVegetable soup\r\nStewed figs\r\nGingerbread\r\nBread and butter.\r\n\r\n\r\nWEDNESDAY\r\n\r\nBREAKFAST\r\nCream of Wheat\r\nMeat hash\r\nCocoa\r\nBread and butter.\r\n\r\nDINNER\r\nRoast lamb\r\nTomato sauce\r\nBoiled potatoes\r\nLemon sherbet\r\nBread and butter.\r\n\r\nSUPPER\r\nCreamed fish\r\nApple sauce\r\nSweet cake\r\nBread and butter.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHURSDAY\r\n\r\nBREAKFAST\r\nShredded Wheat\r\nBaked potatoes\r\nCreamed codfish\r\nBread and butter\r\nCocoa.\r\n\r\nDINNER\r\nBoiled beef\r\nMashed potatoes\r\nCorn starch\r\nPudding with\r\nStrawberry sauce.\r\n\r\nSUPPER\r\nCreamed dried beef\r\nApple sauce\r\nGingerbread\r\nBread and Butter.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRIDAY\r\n\r\nBREAKFAST\r\nOatmeal\r\nCodfish cakes\r\nBread and butter\r\nCocoa.\r\n\r\nDINNER\r\nFried weak fish\r\nStewed tomatoes\r\nBoiled potatoes\r\nVanilla ice cream.\r\n\r\nSUPPER\r\nVegetable soup\r\nBread and butter\r\nSweet cake.\r\n\r\n\r\nSATURDAY\r\n\r\nBREAKFAST\r\nPuffed Rice\r\nFried eggs\r\nBread and butter\r\nCocoa.\r\n\r\nDINNER\r\nEscalloped salmon\r\nRice\r\nBoiled Tomatoes\r\nCucumbers\r\nBread and butter.\r\n\r\nSUPPER\r\nBoston baked beans\r\nTomato catsup\r\nSweetbread.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUNDAY\r\n\r\nBREAKFAST\r\nCream of Wheat\r\nBananas\r\nFried mush and maple syrup\r\nCoffee.\r\n\r\nDINNER\r\nRoast chicken\r\nCreamed onions\r\nMashed potatoes\r\nPineapple sherbet\r\nBread and butter.\r\n\r\nSUPPER\r\nCold beef\r\nApple sauce\r\nSweet cake\r\nBread and butter.\r\n\r\n\r\nServing\r\n\r\nEach table is provided with meat platter, vegetable dishes, bread plate,\r\nbutter dish, sugar bowl, milk pitcher, water pitcher, salt and pepper\r\nshakers, etc. The only need of a waiter is to bring the food to the tables\r\nand replenish the dishes. Each boy takes his turn at waiting. If there are\r\nseven boys in a tent, a boy serves one day in seven. He usually sits at\r\nthe right side of the leader and eats his meal with the others.  This does\r\naway with a second or "waiter" table. By this system you avoid the\r\ntendency to smartness and roughness. Each leader is careful to see that\r\nfood is not wasted at his table, that decency and order is preserved, and\r\nwholesome conversation and pleasantries indulged in during the meal, as an\r\naid to good digestion.\r\n\r\nDishwashing\r\n\r\nSome camps pay for all work done and give boys more freedom, but\r\nexperience has clearly proven that the successful camp is the one where\r\nboys all have responsibility and definite duties to perform. Dishwashing\r\nis never attractive. It may be made less irksome by carefully\r\nsystematizing the work. There are several ways. One way is that of having\r\neach boy wash his own dishes, working a tent at a time. A number of tubs\r\nof hot, soapy water are provided for washing, and several extra tubs\r\nfilled with very hot water for rinsing. At a signal from the Camp Director\r\nor person in charge, each table of boys by rotation passes from the dining\r\nroom with the dishes to these tubs and each boy proceeds to do his own\r\ndishwashing and rinsing and drying. Another way is to provide two\r\ngood-sized dish-pans for each table, and assign two boys to do the\r\ndish-washing for the day. The dishes are washed at the tables and stowed\r\naway in a closet, each table having its own closet. Another way is to\r\npurchase a good dish-washing machine, like that made by the Fearless\r\nDishwashing Co., Rochester, N. Y. (Cost, $100), and install it in the\r\nkitchen. This plan is in operation at Camp Dudley and Camp Hayo-Went-Ha.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Camp Hayo-Went-Ha dishwashing]\r\n\r\nCleanliness must be insisted upon. Never leave anything unwashed until it\r\nis used again. The eating from dirty and greasy plates, forks, knives, and\r\nspoons will result in disease. No matter what system you use, do not let\r\ndown on dirty dishes.\r\n\r\nA FEW HINTS\r\n\r\nSoup\r\n\r\n"Soup makes the soldier," said Napoleon I. Bones should never be thrown\r\naway, but cracked and placed in stock pot, covered with water and let\r\nsimmer. This makes "stock" which is the foundation of all soup.\r\n\r\nAll green vegetables should be washed well in cold water and put in\r\nboiling salted water, and boiled slowly until tender. All white and\r\nunderground vegetables should be cooked in boiling unsalted water, the\r\nsalt being added at the last moment.\r\n\r\nPotatoes take from twenty to thirty minutes to boil. In boiling and\r\nroasting allow about a quarter of an hour for every pound of meat. The\r\nfire should be medium hot. Boiled fish should be cooked ten minutes to\r\neach pound.\r\n\r\nWater\r\n\r\nWater is the only true beverage. Forming as it does three-quarters of the\r\nweight of the human body, it is of next importance to the air we breathe.\r\nMilk is a food and not a beverage.\r\n\r\nOnions\r\n\r\nPeel or slice onions in water and you will not shed tears.\r\n\r\nEgg Test\r\n\r\nTo test the freshness of an egg, drop into cold water. If the egg sinks\r\nquickly it is fresh, if it stands on end it is doubtful, and quite bad if\r\nit floats. The shell of a fresh egg looks dull; a stale one is glossy.\r\n\r\nMending Pots\r\n\r\nA pot may be mended by making a paste of flour, salt and fine wood ashes.\r\nPlaster it on where the leak is and let it dry before using.\r\n\r\nTable Etiquette\r\n\r\nA mother complained that her boy, after being in camp for two weeks,\r\nreturned home speaking a new language, particularly at the dining table.\r\nIf he wanted milk, he called for "cow," butter was "goat," biscuits were\r\n"sinkers," meat was "corpse," and there were several other terms and\r\nphrases peculiar to camp life. He had to learn all over the ways of\r\ndecency and reasonable table refinement. There is no plausible reason why\r\nthis should be so in a boys\' camp. Grabbing of food, yelling for food,\r\nupsetting of liquids, and table "rough-house" will be largely prevented by\r\nthe system of seating and of serving. The most satisfactory way is to seat\r\nby tent groups. Have as many tables as you have tents. Let each tent\r\nleader preside at the head of his table, and serve the food in family\r\nstyle. The leader serves the food, and sees that the boys observe the same\r\ndelightful table life in camp as at home.\r\n\r\nGrace at Meals\r\n\r\nGrace should be said before each meal, either silently or audibly. In the\r\nmorning the hymn on the following page is sung by the boys at Camp Becket,\r\nfollowed with bowed heads in silent prayer:\r\n\r\nMORNING PRAYER HYMN FOR BOYS\' CAMPS\r\n\r\nTo be sung at morning meal\r\nWords and Music by H. W. Gibbon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Music]\r\n\r\nMorning\r\nGracious Giver of all good,\r\n  Thee we thank for rest and food.\r\nGrant that all we do or say\r\n  In Thy service be this day.\r\n\r\nNoon\r\nFather for this noonday meal\r\n  We would speak the praise we feel,\r\nHealth and strength we have from Thee,\r\n  Help us, Lord, to faithful be.\r\n\r\nNight\r\nTireless guardian of our way,\r\n  Thou hast kept us well this day.\r\nWhile we thank Thee, we request\r\n  Care continued, pardon, rest.\r\n-Camp Wawayanda.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Forest scene]\r\n\r\nGo abroad upon the paths of Nature,\r\nAnd when all its voices whisper, and its silent things\r\nAre breathing the deep beauty of the world--\r\nKneel at its ample altar.-Bryant.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X--THE CAMP FIRE\r\n\r\nHOW TO BUILD A CAMP FIRE\r\nPREVENT SPREAD OF FIRE\r\nFOREST FIRE LAWS\r\nHOW TO LIGHT A FIRE\r\nSTORY TELLING\r\nMARSHMALLOW TOASTS AND CORN ROASTS\r\nA STORY, "HOW MEN FOUND THE GREAT SPIRIT"\r\n\r\nThere is an impalpable, invisible, softly stepping delight in the camp\r\nfire which escapes analysis. Enumerate all its charms, and still there is\r\nsomething missing in your catalogue.\r\n--W. C. Gray in "Camp Fire Musings."\r\n\r\n"I cannot conceive of a camp that does not have a big fire! Our city\r\nhouses do not have it, not even a fireplace. The fireplace is one of the\r\ngreatest schools the imagination has ever had or ever can have. It is\r\nmoral, and it always gives a tremendous stimulus to the imagination, and\r\nthat is why stories and fire go together. You cannot tell a good story\r\nunless you tell it before a fire. You cannot have a complete fire unless\r\nyou have a good story-teller along." [1] Anyone who has witnessed a real\r\ncamp fire and participated in its fun, as well as seriousness, will never\r\nforget it. The huge fire shooting up its tongue of flame into the darkness\r\nof the night, the perfect shower of golden rain, the company of happy\r\nboys, and great, dark background of piney woods, the weird light over all,\r\nthe singing, the yells, the stories, the fun, then the serious word at the\r\nclose, is a happy experience long to be remembered.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Dr. G. Stanley Hall, "Camp Conference Report," p. 40.]\r\n\r\nTo Build a Fire\r\n\r\nThere are ways and ways of building camp fires. An old Indian saying runs,\r\n"White man heap fool, make um big fire--can\'t git near! Injun make um\r\nlittle fire--git close! Uh! good!" Make it a service privilege for a tent\r\nof boys to gather wood and build the fire. This should be done during the\r\nafternoon. Two things are essential in the building of a fire--kindling\r\nand air. A fire must be built systematically. First, get dry, small dead\r\nbranches, twigs, fir branches and other inflammable material. Place these\r\nupon the ground. Be sure that air can draw under the pile and up through\r\nit. Next place some heavier branches in tripod form over the kindling,\r\nthen good-sized sticks, and so on until you have built the camp fire the\r\nrequired size. In many camps it is considered an honor to light the fire.\r\n\r\nKerosene oil may be poured upon the kindling, or old newspapers used in\r\nlighting the fire.\r\n\r\nCaution\r\n\r\nAn interesting account of "How to Build a Fire by Rubbing Sticks," by\r\nErnest Thompson-Seton, will be found in "Boy Scouts of America," page 84.\r\n\r\nBe sure to use every precaution to prevent the spreading of fire. This may\r\nbe done by building a circle of stone around the fire, or by digging up\r\nthe earth, or by wetting a space around the fire. Always have buckets of\r\nwater near at hand.\r\n\r\nThings to remember:\r\n\r\n  First, It is criminal to leave a burning fire;\r\n\r\n  Second, Always put out the fire with water or earth.\r\n\r\nState Laws\r\n\r\nBe sure to get a copy of the law of your State regarding Forest Fires, and\r\nif a permit is necessary, secure it before building a fire.\r\n\r\nTo Light a Match\r\n\r\nKephart, in his book on "Camping and Woodcraft" (page 88), says, "When\r\nthere is nothing dry to strike it on, jerk the head of the match forward\r\nthrough the teeth. Face the wind. Cup your hands, backs toward wind.\r\nRemove right hand just long enough to strike match on something very close\r\nby, then instantly resume former position. Flame of match will run up the\r\nstick instead of blowing away from it."\r\n\r\nStory-Telling\r\n\r\nThe camp fire is a golden opportunity for the telling of stories--good\r\nstories told well. Indian legends, war stories, ghost stories, detective\r\nstories, stories of heroism, the history of fire, a talk about the stars.\r\nDon\'t drag out the telling of a story. Talk it in boy language. Avoid\r\ntechnical terms. Make the story live.\r\n\r\nCollege songs always appeal to boys. Let some leader start up a song in a\r\nnatural way, and soon you will have a chorus of unexpected melody and\r\nharmony. As the fire dies down, let the songs be of a more quiet type,\r\nlike "My Old Kentucky Home," and ballads of similar nature.\r\n\r\nRoast Delight\r\n\r\nWhen the embers are glowing is the time for toasting marshmallows. Get a\r\nlong stick sharpened to a point, fasten a marshmallow on the end, hold it\r\nover the embers, not in the blaze, until the marshmallow expands. Oh, the\r\ndeliciousness of it! Ever tasted one? Before roasting corn on the cob, tie\r\nthe end of each husk firmly with string.  Soak in water for about an hour.\r\nThen put into the hot embers. The water prevents the corn from burning and\r\nthe firmly tied husks enable the corn to be steamed and the real corn\r\nflavor is retained. In about twenty minutes the corn may be taken from the\r\nfire and eaten. Have a bowl of melted butter and salt on hand. Also a\r\npastry brush to spread the melted butter upon the corn. Try it.\r\n\r\nA Good Story\r\n\r\nFor an example of a good story to be told around the camp fire, this\r\nIndian tale by Professor H. M. Burr, of the Springfield Training School,\r\nis given:\r\n\r\nHOW MEN FOUND THE GREAT SPIRIT\r\n\r\n"In the olden time, when woods covered all the earth except the deserts\r\nand the river bottoms, and men lived on the fruits and berries they found\r\nand the wild animals which they could shoot or snare; when they dressed in\r\nskins and lived in caves, there was little time for thought. But as men\r\ngrew stronger and more cunning and learned how to live together, they had\r\nmore time to think and more mind to think with.\r\n\r\n"Men had learned many things. They had learned that cold weather followed\r\nhot, and spring followed winter, and that the sun got up in the morning\r\nand went to bed at night. They saw that the great water was kindly when\r\nthe sun shone, but when the sun hid its face and the wind blew upon it, it\r\ngrew black and angry and upset their canoes. They found that knocking\r\nflints together or rubbing dry sticks would light the dry moss and that\r\nthe flames, which would bring back summer in the midst of winter and day\r\nin the midst of night, were hungry and must be fed, and when they escaped\r\ndevoured the woods and only the water could stop them.\r\n\r\n"These and many other things men learned, but no one knew why it all was\r\nor how it came to be. Men began to wonder--and that was the beginning of\r\nthe path which led to the Great Spirit.\r\n\r\n"In the ages when men began to wonder there was born a boy whose name was\r\n\'Wo,\' which meant in the language of his time \'Whence.\' As he lay in his\r\nmother\'s arms, she loved him and wondered, \'His body is of my body, but\r\nfrom whence comes the life--the spirit which is like mine and yet not like\r\nit?\' And his father, seeing the wonder in the mother\'s eyes, said: \'Whence\r\ncame he from?\' And there was no one to answer, and so they called him\r\n\'Wo,\' to remind them that they knew not from whence he came.\r\n\r\n"As Wo grew up, he was stronger and swifter of foot than any of his tribe.\r\nHe became a mighty hunter. He knew the ways of all the wild things, and\r\ncould read the signs of the season. As he grew older they made him a chief\r\nand listened while he spoke at the council board, but Wo was not\r\nsatisfied. His name was a question, and questioning filled his mind.\r\n\r\n"From whence did he come? Whither was he going? Why did the sun rise and\r\nset? Why did life burst into leaf and flower with the coming of the\r\nspring? Why did the child become a man and the man grow old and die?\r\n\r\n"The mystery grew upon him as he pondered. In the morning he stood on a\r\nmountain top and, stretching out his hands, cried: \'Whence?\' At night he\r\ncried to the moon: \'Whither?\' He listened to the soughing of the trees and\r\nthe song of the brook and tried to learn their language. He peered eagerly\r\ninto the eyes of little children, and tried to read the mystery of life.\r\nHe listened at the still lips of the dead, waiting for them to tell him\r\nwhither they had gone.\r\n\r\n"He went about among his fellows silent and absorbed, always looking for\r\nthe unseen and listening for the unspoken. He sat so long silent at the\r\ncouncil board that the elders questioned him. To their questioning he\r\nreplied, like one awakening from a dream:\r\n\r\n"\'Our fathers since the beginning have trailed the beasts of the woods.\r\nThere is none so cunning as the fox, but we can trail him to his lair.\r\nThough we are weaker than the great bear and buffalo, yet by our wisdom we\r\novercome them. The deer is more swift of foot, but by craft we overtake\r\nhim. We cannot fly like a bird, but we snare the winged one with a hair.\r\nWe have made ourselves many cunning inventions by which the beasts, the\r\ntrees, the wind, the water, and the fire become our servants.\r\n\r\n"\'Then we speak great swelling words: How great and wise we are! There is\r\nnone like us in the air, in the wood, or in the water!\r\n\r\n"\'But the words are false. Our pride is like that of a partridge drumming\r\non his log in the wood before the fox leaps upon him. Our sight is like\r\nthat of the mole burrowing under the ground. Our wisdom is like a drop of\r\ndew upon the grass. Our ignorance is like the great water which no eye can\r\nmeasure.\r\n\r\n"\'Our life is like a bird coming out of the dark, fluttering for a\r\nheart-beat in the tepee and then going forth into the dark again. No one\r\ncan tell us whence it comes or whither it goes. I have asked the wise men,\r\nand they cannot answer; I have listened to the voice of the trees and wind\r\nand water, but I do not know their tongue; I have questioned the sun and\r\nthe moon and the stars, but they are silent.\r\n\r\n"\'But to-day, in the silence before the darkness gives place to light, I\r\nseemed to hear a still small voice within my breast, saying to me: "Wo,\r\nthe questioner, rise up like the stag from his lair; away, alone, to the\r\nmountain of the sun. There thou shalt find that which thou seekest."\r\n\r\n"\'I go, but if I fall by the trail another will take it up. If I find the\r\nanswer I will return.\'\r\n\r\n"Waiting for none, Wo left the council of his tribe and went his way\r\ntoward the mountain of the sun. For six days he made his way through the\r\ntrackless woods, guided by the sun by day and the stars by night. On the\r\nseventh he came to the great mountain--the mountain of the sun--on whose\r\ntop, according to the tradition of his tribe, the sun rested each night.\r\nAll day long he climbed, saying to himself: \'I will sleep to-night in the\r\ntepee of the sun and he will tell me whence I come and whither I go.\'\r\n\r\n"But as he climbed the sun seemed to climb higher and higher. As he neared\r\nthe top a cold cloud settled like a night bird on the mountain. Chilled\r\nand faint with hunger and fatigue, Wo struggled on. Just at sunset he\r\nreached the top of the mountain, but it was not the mountain of the sun,\r\nfor many days\' journey to the west the sun was sinking in the Great Water.\r\n\r\n"A bitter cry broke from Wo\'s parched lips. His long trail was useless.\r\nThere was no answer to his questions. The sun journeyed farther and faster\r\nthan men dreamed, and of wood and waste and water there was no end.\r\nOvercome with misery and weakness, he fell upon a bed of moss with his\r\nback toward the sunset and the unknown.\r\n\r\n"And Wo slept, although it was unlike any sleep he had ever known before,\r\nand as he slept he dreamed. He was alone upon the mountain waiting for the\r\nanswer. A cloud covered the mountain, but all was silent. A mighty wind\r\nrent the cloud and rushed roaring through the crags, but there was no\r\nvoice in the wind. Thunder pealed, lightning flashed, but he whom Wo\r\nsought was not there.\r\n\r\n"In the hush that followed the storm Wo heard a voice low and quiet, but\r\nin it all the sounds of earth and sky seemed to mingle--the song of the\r\nbird, the whispering of the trees, and the murmuring of the brook.\r\n\r\n"\'Wo, I am He whom thou seekest; I am the Great Spirit; I am the\r\nAll-Father. Ever since I made man of the dust of the earth and so child of\r\nthe earth and brother to all living, and breathed into his nostrils the\r\nbreath of life, thus making him My son, I have waited for a seeker who\r\nshould find Me. In the fullness of time thou hast come, Wo, the\r\nquestioner, to the Answerer.\r\n\r\n"\'Thy body is of the earth and to earth returns; thy spirit is Mine; it is\r\ngiven thee for a space to make according to thy will; then it returns to\r\nMe better or worse for thy making.\r\n\r\n"\'Thou hast found Me because thy heart was pure and thy search for Me\r\ntireless. Go back to thy tribe and be to them the voice of the Great\r\nSpirit. From henceforth I will speak to thee and the seekers that come\r\nafter thee, in a thousand voices and appear in a thousand shapes. I will\r\nspeak in the voices of the wood and streams and of those you love. I will\r\nappear to you in the sun by day and the stars by night. When thy people\r\nand Mine are in need and wish for the will of the Great Spirit, then shall\r\nMy spirit brood over thine and the words that thou shalt speak shall be My\r\nwords.\'\r\n\r\n"And Wo awoke, facing the east and the rising sun. His body was warmed by\r\nits rays. A great gladness filled his soul. He had sought and found, and\r\nprayer came to him like the song to the bird:\r\n\r\n"\'O Great Spirit, Father of my spirit, the sun is Thy messenger, but Thou\r\nart brighter than the sun. Drive Thou the darkness before me. Be Thou the\r\nlight of my spirit.\'\r\n\r\n"As Wo went down the mountain and took the journey back to the home of his\r\npeople his face shone, and the light never seemed to leave it, so that men\r\ncalled him \'He of the shining face.\'\r\n\r\n"When Wo came back to his tribe, all who saw his face knew that he had\r\nfound the answer, and they gathered again about the council fire to hear.\r\nAs Wo stood up and looked into the eager faces in the circle of the fire,\r\nhe remembered that the Great Spirit had given him no message, and for a\r\nmoment he was dumb. Then the words of the Great Spirit came to him again:\r\n\'When thy people and Mine shall need to know My will, My spirit shall\r\nbrood over thine and the words that thou shalt speak shall be My words.\'\r\nLooking into the eager faces of longing and questioning, his spirit moved\r\nwithin him and he spoke:\r\n\r\n"\'I went, I sought, I found the Great Spirit, who dwells in the earth as\r\nyour spirits dwell in your bodies. It is from Him the spirit comes. We are\r\nHis children. He cares for us more than a mother for the child at her\r\nbreast, or the father for the son that is his pride. His love is like the\r\nair we breathe: it is about us; it is within us.\r\n\r\n"\'The sun is the sign of His brightness, the sky of His greatness, and\r\nmother-love and father-love, and the love of man and woman are the signs\r\nof His love. We are but children; we cannot enter into the council of the\r\nGreat Chief until we have been proved, but this is His will, that we love\r\none another as He loves us; that we bury forever the hatchet of hate; that\r\nno man shall take what is not his own and the strong shall help the weak.\'\r\n\r\n"The chiefs did not wholly understand the words of Wo, but they took a\r\nhatchet and buried it by the fire, saying: \'Thus bury we hate between man\r\nand his brother,\' and they took an acorn and put it in the earth, saying:\r\n\'Thus plant we the love of the strong for the weak.\' And it became the\r\ncustom of the tribe that the great council in the spring should bury the\r\nhatchet and plant the acorn.\r\n\r\n"Every morning the tribe gathered to greet the rising sun, and, with right\r\nhands raised and left hands upon their hearts, prayed: \'Great Spirit, hear\r\nus; guide us today; make our wills Thy will, our ways Thy way.\'\r\n\r\n"And the tribe grew stronger and greater and wiser than all the other\r\ntribes--but that is another story."\r\n--Association Seminar, December, 1910.\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nCamp-Fire Musings-William C.

Several things should be remembered when one goes on a hike.\r\nFirst, avoid long distances. A foot-weary, muscle-tired, and temper-tried,\r\nhungry group of boys surely is not desirable. There are a lot of false\r\nnotions about courage, and bravery, and grit, that read well in print but\r\nfail miserably in practice, and long hikes for boys is one of the most\r\nglaring of these notions. Second, have a leader who will set a good, easy\r\npace, say about three miles an hour, prevent the boys from excessive water\r\ndrinking, and assign the duties of pitching camp, etc. Third, observe\r\nthese two rules given by an old woodsman: (1) Never walk over anything you\r\ncan walk around; (2) Never step on anything that you can step over. Every\r\ntime you step on anything you lift the weight of your body. Why lift extra\r\nweight when tramping? Fourth, carry with you only the things absolutely\r\nneeded, and roll in blanket and poncho, army style.\r\n\r\nMap Reading\r\n\r\nBefore starting on a hike, study carefully the road maps. The best maps\r\nare those of the United States Geological Survey, made on a scale of two\r\ninches to the mile, and costing five cents each. The map is published in\r\natlas sheets, each sheet representing a small quadrangular district. Send\r\nto the Superintendent of Documents, at Washington, D. C., for a list.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Universal Map Measure]\r\n\r\nA mountaineer in Tennessee said: "We measure miles with a coonskin, and\r\nthrow in the tail for good measure." A better way is to purchase the\r\nUniversal Map Measure, costing $1.50 (imported  and sold by Dame, Stoddard\r\nCo., 374 Washington Street, Boston, Mass.), which accurately measures the\r\ndistance upon the Government Survey Maps.\r\n\r\nShoe Wisdom\r\n\r\nFor tramping the boy needs the right kind of a shoe, or the trip will be a\r\nmiserable failure. A light-soled or light-built shoe is not suited for\r\nmountain work, or even for an ordinary hike. The feet will blister and\r\nbecome "road-weary." They must be neither too big nor too small nor too\r\nheavy, and be amply broad to give the toes plenty of room. The shoe should\r\nbe water-tight. A medium weight, high-topped lace shoe is about right.\r\nBathing the feet at the springs and streams along the road will be\r\nrefreshing, if not indulged in too frequently. (See chapter on "Health and\r\nHygiene" for care of the feet and proper way of walking.)\r\n\r\nIt is well to carry a spare shirt hanging down the back with the sleeves\r\ntied round the neck. Change when the shirt you are wearing becomes too wet\r\nwith perspiration.\r\n\r\nThe Pack\r\n\r\nThe most practical and inexpensive pack is the one manufactured for the\r\nBoy Scouts of America. Price, sixty cents. It is about 14 by 20 inches\r\nsquare, and 6 inches thick, made of water-proof canvas, with shoulder\r\nstraps, and will easily hold everything needed for a tramping trip.\r\n\r\nA few simple remedies for bruises, cuts, etc., should be taken along by\r\nthe leader (see chapter on "Simple Remedies"). You may not need them, and\r\nsome may poke fun at them, but as the old lady said: "You can\'t always\r\nsometimes tell." Amount and kind of provisions must be determined by the\r\nlocality and habitation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hiking Pack]\r\n\r\nThe "Lean-to"\r\n\r\nReach the place where you are going to spend the night in plenty of time\r\nto build your "lean-to," and make your bed for the night. Select your\r\ncamping spot, with reference to water, wood, drainage, and material for\r\nyour "lean-to." Choose a dry, level place, the ground just sloping enough\r\nto insure the water running away from your "lean-to" in case of rain. In\r\nbuilding your "lean-to," look for a couple of good trees standing from\r\neight to ten feet apart with branches from six to eight feet above the\r\nground. By studying the illustration below, you will be able to build a\r\nvery serviceable shack, affording protection from the dews and rain. While\r\ntwo or more boys are building the shack, another should be gathering\r\nfirewood, and preparing the meal, while another should be cutting and\r\nbringing in as many soft, thick tips of hemlock or balsam boughs as\r\npossible, for the roof of the shack and the beds. How to thatch the\r\n"lean-to" is shown in this illustration.\r\n\r\nIf the camp site is to be used for several days, two "lean-tos" may be\r\nbuilt facing each other, about six feet apart. This will make a very\r\ncomfortable camp, as a small fire can be built between the two, thus\r\ngiving warmth and light.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Frame of Lean To]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Method of Thatching.]\r\n\r\nThe Bed\r\n\r\nOn the floor of your "lean-to" lay a thick layer of the "fans" or branches\r\nof balsam fir or hemlock, with the convex side up, and the butts of the\r\nstems toward the foot of the bed. Now thatch this over with more "fans" by\r\nthrusting the butt ends through the first layer at a slight angle toward\r\nthe head of the bed, so that the soft tips will curve toward the foot of\r\nthe bed, and be sure to make the head of your bed away from the opening of\r\nthe "lean-to" and the foot toward the opening. Over this bed spread your\r\nrubber blanket with rubber side down, your sleeping blanket on top, and\r\nyou will be surprised how soft, springy, and fragrant a bed you have, upon\r\nwhich to rest your "weary frame," and sing with the poet:\r\n\r\nThen the pine boughs croon me a lullaby,\r\n  And trickle the white moonbeams\r\nTo my face on the balsam where I lie\r\n  While the owl hoots at my dreams.\r\n-J. George Frederick.\r\n\r\nWhat God puts in the blood is eliminated slowly and we are all impregnated\r\nwith a love for the natural life which is irresistible. That was a great\r\nsaying of the boy who was taken from the city for the first time on an\r\nall-night outing. Snugly tucked up in his blankets he heard the wind\r\nsinging in the pines overhead. As the boy looked up, he asked, "Wasn\'t God\r\nblowing His breath down at us?"--Dr. Lilburn.\r\n\r\nHot Stones\r\n\r\nIf the night bids fair to be cold, place a number of stones about six or\r\neight inches in diameter next the fire, so they will get hot. These can\r\nthen be placed at the feet, back, etc., as needed, and will be found good\r\n"bed warmers." When a stone loses its heat it is replaced near the fire\r\nand a hot one is taken. If too hot, wrap the stone in a shirt or sweater\r\nor wait for it to cool off.\r\n\r\nNight Watchers\r\n\r\nBoys desire adventure. This desire may be gratified by the establishment\r\nof night watchers, in relays of two boys every two hours. Their\r\nimaginations will be stirred by the resistless attraction of the camp-fire\r\nand the sound of the creatures that creep at night.\r\n\r\nObservation\r\n\r\nMany boys have excellent eyes but see not, and good ears but hear not, all\r\nbecause they have not been trained to observe or to be quick to hear. A\r\ngood method of teaching observation while on a hike or tramp is to have\r\neach boy jot down in a small notebook or diary of the trip the different\r\nkinds of trees, birds, animals, tracks; nature of roads, fences; peculiar\r\nrock formation, smells of plants, etc., and thus be able to tell what he\r\nsaw or heard to the boys upon his return to the permanent camp or to his\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nCameras\r\n\r\nOne of the party should take a Brownie No. 2 or small folding kodak.\r\nPhotos of the trip are always a great pleasure and a memory reviver. A\r\npractical and convenient method of carrying small folding cameras is\r\ndescribed in "Forest and Stream."  A strap with a buckle having been\r\nattached to an ordinary leather belt is run through the loops at the back\r\nof the camera-case. The camera may be pushed around the belt to the point\r\nwhere it will be least in the way.\r\n\r\nLamps\r\n\r\nA very convenient lamp to use on a hike is the Baldwin Camp Lamp, made by\r\nJohn Simmons Co., 13 Franklin Street, New York City. (Price, $1.00.) It\r\nweighs only five ounces when fully charged with carbide, and is but 4-3/4\r\ninches high. It projects a strong light 150 feet through the woods. A\r\nstiff wind will not blow it out. It can be worn comfortably in your hat or\r\nbelt.\r\n\r\nThe "Rocky Mountain Searchlight," made of a discarded tomato can, a\r\ncandle, and a bit of wire for a handle, is a camp product that will be\r\nfound to be very useful in an emergency.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rocky Mountain Lantern]\r\n\r\nThe can is carried lengthwise, with the wire handle run through a hole in\r\nthe closed end on through the entire length of the can and out the open\r\nend. Do not wrap the handle wire around the can. It will slip off. Two\r\ncuts, crossing each other, make the candle opening, with the cut edges\r\nbent inward. The candle is pushed upward as it burns down, the flame being\r\nkept in the middle of the can. The cut edges prevent it from falling out\r\nuntil the last hold is melted away. The "Searchlight" gives good service\r\nwhen hung in the tent or on a nearby tree, but is especially valuable in\r\nlighting up a rough path on a rainy, windy night.\r\n\r\nCamp Hanger\r\n\r\nThe camp hanger shown in the illustration can be hung from the ridgepole\r\nof the tent, and is particularly useful when from two to four persons\r\noccupy the tent. It can be raised and lowered at will by attaching the\r\nhanger to a pulley arrangement. The hanger may be made of wood in any\r\nlength. Ordinary coat hooks are fastened to the side with screws. A common\r\nscrew-eye is used for the line at the top. A snap hook attached to the\r\nrope facilitates its removal at will.\r\n\r\nA boy of ingenuity can make a number of convenient things. A good drinking\r\ncup may be made from a piece of birch bark cut in parallelogram shape, and\r\ntwisted into pyramid form, and fastened with a split stick. (See\r\nillustrations on opposite page.) A flat piece of bark may serve as a\r\nplate. A pot lifter may be made from a green stick about 18 inches long,\r\nallowing a few inches of a stout branch to remain. By reversing the same\r\nkind of stick and driving a small nail near the other end or cutting a\r\nnotch, it may be used to suspend kettles over a fire. A novel candlestick\r\nis made by opening the blade of a knife and jabbing it into a tree, and\r\nupon the other upturned blade putting a candle. A green stick having a\r\nsplit end which will hold a piece of bread or meat makes an excellent\r\nbroiler. Don\'t pierce the bread or meat. Driving a good-sized green stake\r\ninto the ground at an angle of 45 degrees and cutting a notch in which may\r\nbe suspended a kettle over the fire, will provide a way of boiling water\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\nFor suggestions in building a camp-fire and cooking on hikes, see chapter\r\non "Cooking on Hikes." The bibliography for the whole subject of Hikes,\r\nincluding cooking, is on page 153.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Birch bark cup, Camp fire tongs, Camp Broiler, Bark Plate,\r\nA Novel Candlestick, Pot Lifter, Pot Hook, To Boil Water Quickly.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Extemporaneous Dining]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII--COOKING ON HIKES\r\n\r\nBUILDING A COOKING FIRE\r\nFIRE BY SUN GLASS\r\nGRIDDLE CAKES\r\nBROILED BACON\r\nCREAMED SALMON\r\nSALMON ON TOAST\r\nBAKED POTATOES\r\nBAKED FISH\r\nFROGS\' LEGS\r\nEGGS\r\nCOFFEE\r\nCOCOA\r\nSAMPLE MENU\r\nRATION LIST\r\nDISH WASHING\r\n\r\nThe Fireplace\r\n\r\nTake two or three stones to build a fireplace; a stick first shaved and\r\nthen whittled into shavings; a lighted match, a little blaze, some bark,\r\ndry twigs and a few small sticks added; then with the griddle placed over\r\nthe fire, you are ready to cook the most appetizing griddle cakes. After\r\nthe cakes are cooked, fry strips of bacon upon the griddle; in the surplus\r\nfat fry slices of bread, then some thinly sliced raw potatoes done to a\r\ndelicious brown and you have a breakfast capable of making the mouth of a\r\ncamper water.\r\n\r\nAnother way of building a fire: Place two green logs side by side, closer\r\ntogether at one end than the other. Build fire between. On the logs over\r\nthe fire you can rest frying pan, kettle, etc. To start fire have some\r\nlight, dry wood split up fine. When sticks begin to blaze add a few more\r\nof larger size and continue until you have a good fire.\r\n\r\nSun Glass\r\n\r\nWhen the sun shines a fire may be started by means of a small pocket sun\r\nor magnifying glass. Fine scrapings from dry wood or "punk tinder" will\r\neasily ignite by the focusing of the sun dial upon it, and by fanning the\r\nfire and by adding additional fuel, the fire-builder will soon have a\r\ngreat blaze.\r\n\r\nCOOKING RECEIPTS\r\n\r\nGriddle Cakes\r\n\r\nBeat together one egg, tablespoonful of sugar, cup of new milk, or\r\ncondensed milk diluted one-half. Mix in enough self-raising flour to make\r\na thick cream batter. Grease the griddle with rind or slices of bacon for\r\neach batch of cakes.\r\n\r\nBroiled Bacon\r\n\r\nSlice bacon thin. Remove the rind which makes the slices curl up. Or, gash\r\nthe rind with a sharp knife if the boys like "cracklings." Fry on griddle\r\nor put on the sharp end of a stick and hold over the hot coals, or, better\r\nyet, remove the griddle and put a clean flat rock in its place. When the\r\nrock is hot lay the slices of bacon on it and broil. Keep turning the\r\nbacon so as to brown it on both sides. Cut into dice.\r\n\r\nCreamed Salmon\r\n\r\nHeat about a pint of salmon in one-half pint milk, season with salt and\r\npepper and a half teaspoonful of butter.\r\n\r\nSalmon on Toast\r\n\r\nDrop slices of stale bread into smoking-hot lard. They will brown at once.\r\nDrain them. Heat a pint of salmon, picked into flakes, season with salt\r\nand pepper and put into it a tablespoonful of butter. Stir in one egg,\r\nbeaten light, with three tablespoonfuls evaporated milk not thinned. Pour\r\nmixture on the fried bread.\r\n\r\nPotatoes\r\n\r\nWash potatoes and dry well; bury them deep in a good bed of live coals,\r\ncover them with hot coals until well done. They will take about forty\r\nminutes to bake. When you can pass a sharpened hardwood sliver through\r\nthem, they are done, and should be raked out at once. Run the sliver\r\nthrough them from end to end, and let the steam escape and use\r\nimmediately, as a roast potato quickly becomes soggy and bitter.\r\n\r\nBaked Fish\r\n\r\nDig a hole one foot and a half deep. Build a fire in it, heaping up dry\r\nsticks until there is an abundance of fuel. After an hour, take out the\r\ncoals, clear the hole of ashes, lay green corn husks on the hot bottom of\r\nthe hole. Soak brown paper in water and wrap around the fish. Lay it in\r\nthe hole, cover with green corn husks, covered in turn with half an inch\r\nof earth. Build a fire over it and keep burning for an hour. Then remove\r\nand you have something delicious and worth the time taken to prepare.\r\n\r\nFried Fish\r\n\r\nClean fish well. Small fish should be fried whole, with the backbone\r\nsevered to prevent curling up; large fish should be cut into pieces, and\r\nribs cut loose from backbone so as to lie flat in pan. Rub the pieces in\r\ncorn meal or powdered bread crumbs, thinly and evenly (that browns them).\r\nFry in plenty of very hot fat to a golden brown, sprinkling lightly with\r\npepper and salt just as the color turns. If fish has not been wiped dry,\r\nit will absorb too much grease. If the frying fat is not very hot when\r\nfish are put in they will be soggy with it.\r\n\r\nFrogs\' Legs\r\n\r\nAfter skinning frogs, soak them an hour in cold water, to which vinegar\r\nhas been added, or put them for two minutes into scalding water that has\r\nvinegar in it. Drain, wipe dry, and cook. To fry: Roll in flour seasoned\r\nwith salt and pepper, and fry, not too rapidly, preferably in butter or\r\noil. Water cress is a good relish with them. To grill: Prepare three\r\ntablespoonfuls melted butter, one-half teaspoonful salt, and a pinch or\r\ntwo of pepper, into which dip the frog legs, then roll in fresh bread\r\ncrumbs and broil for three minutes on each side.\r\n\r\nEGGS\r\n\r\nBoiled\r\n\r\nRaise water to boiling point. Place eggs in carefully. Boil steadily for\r\nthree minutes if you prefer them soft. If you want them hard-boiled, put\r\nthem in cold water, bring to a boil, and keep it up for twenty minutes.\r\nThe yolk will then be mealy and wholesome.\r\n\r\nFried\r\n\r\nMelt some butter or fat in frying pan, when it hisses drop in eggs\r\ncarefully. Fry them three minutes.\r\n\r\nScrambled\r\n\r\nFirst stir the eggs up with a little condensed cream and a pinch of salt\r\nand after putting some butter in the frying pan, stir the eggs in it,\r\nbeing careful not to cook them too long.\r\n\r\nPoached\r\n\r\nFirst put in the frying pan sufficient diluted condensed milk which has\r\nbeen thinned with enough water to float the eggs when the milk is hot;\r\ndrop in the carefully opened eggs and let them simmer three or four\r\nminutes. Serve the eggs on slices of buttered toast, pouring on enough of\r\nthe milk to moisten the toast.\r\n\r\nCoffee\r\n\r\nFor every cup of water allow a tablespoonful of ground coffee, and one\r\nextra for the pot. Heat water to boiling point first, add coffee, boil\r\nfive minutes, settle with one-fourth cup cold water and serve. Some prefer\r\nto put the coffee in a small muslin bag, tied loose, and boil for five\r\nminutes longer.\r\n\r\nCocoa\r\n\r\nAllow a teaspoonful of cocoa for every cup of boiling water. Mix the\r\npowdered cocoa with hot water or hot milk to a creamy paste. Add equal\r\nparts of boiling water and boiled milk, and sugar to taste. Boil two or\r\nthree minutes.\r\n\r\nSAMPLE MENU FOR AN OVER-NIGHT AND A DAY HIKE OR TRAMP\r\n\r\nBreakfast\r\n\r\nGriddle cakes with Karo Syrup or brown sugar and butter;\r\nFried bacon and potatoes;\r\nBread, coffee, preserves.\r\n\r\nDinner\r\n\r\nCreamed salmon on toast; Baked potatoes; Bread; Pickles; Fruit.\r\n\r\nSupper\r\n\r\nFried eggs; Creamed or chipped beef; Cheese; Bread; Cocoa\r\n\r\nThese recipes have been tried out. Biscuit and bread-making have been\r\npurposely omitted. Take bread and crackers with you from the camp.\r\n"Amateur" biscuits are not conducive to good digestion or happiness. Pack\r\nbutter in small jar. Cocoa, sugar and coffee in small cans or heavy paper,\r\nalso salt and pepper. Wrap bread in a moist cloth to prevent drying up.\r\nBacon and dried or chipped beef in wax paper. Pickles can be purchased put\r\nup in small bottles. Use the empty bottle as a candlestick.\r\n\r\nRation List for six boys, three meals\r\n\r\n2 lbs. bacon (sliced thin),\r\n1 lb. butter,\r\n1 doz. eggs,\r\n1/2 lb. cocoa,\r\n1/2 lb. coffee,\r\n1 lb. sugar,\r\n3 cans salmon,\r\n24 potatoes,\r\n2 cans condensed milk,\r\n1 small package self-raising flour,\r\nSalt and pepper.\r\n\r\nUtensils\r\n\r\nSmall griddle or tin "pie plate" (5 cents each),\r\nSmall stew pan,\r\nSmall coffee pot,\r\nSmall cake turner,\r\nLarge spoon,\r\nTeaspoons,\r\nKnives and forks,\r\nPlates and cups,\r\nMatches and candles.\r\n\r\nDish Washing\r\n\r\nFirst fill the frying pan with water, place over fire and let it boil.\r\nPour out water and you will find that it has practically cleaned itself.\r\nClean the griddle with sand and water. Greasy knives and forks may be\r\ncleaned by jabbing a couple of times into the ground. After all grease is\r\ngotten rid of, wash in hot water and dry with cloth. Don\'t use the cloth\r\nfirst and get it greasy.\r\n\r\nBe sure to purchase Horace Kephart\'s excellent book on "Camp Cookery,"\r\n$1.00, Outing Publishing Co., or Association Press.

An examination blank like that shown on\r\nthe next page is used in many of the large camps. When the boy arrives in\r\ncamp the physician or physical director examines the boy. Take his height,\r\nweight, lung capacity, condition of heart, lungs, condition of muscles,\r\nwhether hard, medium or soft, and state of digestion. For this purpose you\r\nwill need a wet spirometer, measuring rod, stethoscope and platform\r\nscales. A second blank with carbon duplicate, is kept of every boy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wisconsin Boys\' Camp Physical Examination Record]\r\n\r\nGive dates of first examination on arrival and final examination before\r\ndeparture from camp. The original is given to the boy to take home and the\r\ncarbon copy is retained by the camp, filed in alphabetical order. Most\r\nremarkable gains have been made by boys, particularly in lung capacity,\r\nheight, and hardening of muscles. The active life of the camp is not\r\nconducive as a rule to great gain in weight.\r\n\r\nEach tent leader should be given the important facts of the examinations\r\nof the boys in his tent, so that there may be intelligent cooperation\r\nbetween the physician, or physical director, the tent leader, and the boy\r\nin securing health efficiency.\r\n\r\nAVERAGE PHYSICAL TYPES FOR BOYS OF 5 TO 16 YEARS\r\n(Compiled from the measurements of 5,476 school children.)\r\n\r\n ---Lengths (Inches)---\r\nAge Weight Height Height  Span of  Breadth  Breadth   Breadth\r\n                  Sitting   Arms    Head     Chest     Waist\r\n16  116.38  64.45  33.55   66.25    5.95     9.85      9.15\r\n15  103.29  62.25  32.15   63.15    5.90     9.30      8.65\r\n14   87.41  59.45  30.70   60.00    5.85     8.95      8.25\r\n13   78.32  57.10  29.60   57.50    5.80     8.70      7.95\r\n12   72.55  55.25  28.95   55.30    5.80     8.50      7.70\r\n11   64.89  53.10  28.20   53.40    5.75     8.25      7.45\r\n10   61.28  51.55  27.60   51.20    5.75     8.00      7.20\r\n 9   55.15  49.55  26.80   49.10    5.70     7.80      7.10\r\n 8   50.90  47.75  26.00   47.00    5.65     7.65      6.95\r\n 7   46.85  45.55  25.20   45.00    5.65     7.45      6.75\r\n 6   42.62  43.55  24.20   42.60    5.60     7.25      6.55\r\n 5   39.29  41.60  23.30   40.35    5.60     7.15      6.50\r\n\r\n     Girth                       Strength\r\nAge  Chest  Girth of    Chest    Lung     Right    Left     Vitality\r\n     Depth  Head      Expansion  Capacity Forearm  Forearm  Coefficient\r\n                                 (cu in)  Strength Strength\r\n16   6.60   21.55       3.45      191.40  73.28    65.22    35.58\r\n15   6.30   21.45       3.30      161.00  63.47    54.30    26.09\r\n14   5.95   21.30       3.35      140.12  55.81    50.70    21.97\r\n13   5.65   21.10       3.25      123.58  49.69    45.07    18.28\r\n12   5.60   21.00       3.05      111.33  43.29    40.56    15.55\r\n11   5.45   20.85       2.90      100.74  39.09    36.30    13.33\r\n10   5.25   20.60       2.75       90.02  32.42    30.94    10.84\r\n 9   5.20   20.65       2.55       81.03  28.91    25.90     9.34\r\n 8   5.10   20.55       2.35       70.43  23.38    20.96     7.34\r\n 7   5.10   20.45       1.80       60.48  20.19    18.78     5.05\r\n 6   5.05   20.25       1.65       50.89  15.36    12.53     4.02\r\n 5   4.90   20.15       1.35       40.60  10.76    10.38     2.61\r\n Copyright by Wm. W. Hastings, Ph.D.\r\n\r\nHospital Tent\r\n\r\nIf a boy is ill (minor aches and pains which are frequently only growing\r\npains, excepted), isolate him from the camp, so that he may have quiet and\r\nreceive careful attention.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hospital Tent at Camp Couchiching]\r\n\r\nA tent, with fly and board floor, known as the "Hospital Tent" or "Red\r\nCross Tent," should be a part of the camp equipment. There may be no\r\noccasion for its use, but it should be ready for any emergency. The\r\nphysician may have his office in this tent. Boys should not be "coddled;"\r\nat the same time it must not be forgotten that good, sympathetic attention\r\nand nursing are two-thirds responsible for speedy recovery from most ills.\r\n\r\nEquipment\r\n\r\nA spring cot, mattress, pillow, blankets, a good medicine cabinet, alcohol\r\nstove for boiling water, cooking food, and sterilizing instruments; pans,\r\nwhite enameled slop jar, pitcher, cup, pail; a table, a folding camp\r\nreclining chair (Gold Medal Camp Furniture Company), and a combination\r\ncamp cot and litter (Gold Medal Brand) will make up the equipment of the\r\ntent.\r\n\r\nThe information and suggestions given in this chapter are the accumulation\r\nof many years\' experience in boys\' camps. The technical information is\r\nvouched for by competent physicians who have examined the manuscript.[1]\r\n\r\n[Transcriber\'s Footnote 1: This chapter was written in 1911. Many\r\nobservations and suggestions are obsolete, if not dangerous or illegal.]\r\n\r\nPulse Rate\r\n\r\nEvery man in charge of a boys\' camp should have a knowledge of certain\r\nphysiological facts, so as to be able to make a fair diagnosis of pain and\r\ndisease. The pulse, taken at the wrist, is a fair index of the condition\r\nof the body. In taking the pulse-beat, do so with the fingers, and not\r\nwith the thumb, as the beating of the artery in the thumb may confuse.\r\nPulse rate is modified with age, rest, exercise, position, excitements,\r\nand elevation. High elevation produces a more rapid pulse. The normal rate\r\nof boys in their teens is about 80 to 84 beats per minute. An increase not\r\naccounted for by one of the above reasons usually means fever, a rise of 6\r\nbeats in pulse usually being equivalent to a rise of 1 degree. Often more\r\nimportant than the rate, however, is the quality of the pulse. Roughly,\r\nthe feebler the pulse, the more serious the condition of the individual.\r\nIrregularity in the rate may be a serious sign, and when it is noticed a\r\ndoctor should be immediately called. Failure to find the artery should not\r\nnecessarily cause uneasiness, as by trying on himself, the director may\r\nsee that the taking of the pulse is often a difficult undertaking.\r\n\r\nThe Tongue\r\n\r\nThe tongue is a very misleading guide to the patient\'s condition, and no\r\ndefinite rule about its appearance can be laid down. Other signs, such as\r\ntemperature, general conditions, localization of pain, etc., are more\r\naccurate, and to the total result of such observations the appearance of\r\nthe tongue adds little.\r\n\r\nThermometer\r\n\r\nThe normal temperature of the human body by mouth is about 98.4 degrees.\r\nVariations between 98 degrees and 99 degrees are not necessarily\r\nsignificant of disease. A reliable clinical thermometer should be used.\r\nTemperature is generally taken in the mouth. Insert the bulb of the\r\nthermometer well under the boy\'s tongue. Tell him  to close his lips, not\r\nhis teeth, and to breathe through his nose. Leave it in the mouth about\r\nthree or four minutes. Remove, and, after noting temperature, rinse it in\r\ncold water, dry it with a clean, towel, and shake the mercury down to 95\r\ndegrees. It will then be ready for use next time. Never return a\r\nthermometer to its case unwashed.\r\n\r\nPain\r\n\r\nPain is an indication that there is something wrong with the body that\r\nshould receive attention. Some boys are more sensitive to pain than\r\nothers, particularly boys of a highly strung, delicate, nervous nature.\r\nMost people, however, think too much of their pains. Most pains to which\r\nboys fall heir are due to trouble in the stomach or intestines, or to\r\nfevers. Many pains that boys feel mean very little. They are often due to\r\na sore or strained muscle or nerve. A hot application or massage will\r\noften bring relief.\r\n\r\nSharply localized pain, except as the result of external injury, is not\r\ncommon among healthy boys, and, if found, particularly in the well-known\r\nappendix area, and if accompanied by other disquieting signs (temperature,\r\npulse, etc.), should receive medical attention.\r\n\r\nIn a general way, any abdominal pain that does not yield in 24 hours to\r\nrest in bed with application of external heat, should call for the advice\r\nof a physician. Any severe attack of vomiting or diarrhea, accompanied by\r\ntemperature, and not immediately traceable to some indiscretion in diet,\r\nis cause for study, and if improvement does not soon show itself, a\r\nphysician should be called.\r\n\r\nPains in the extremities, particularly joints, if not clearly showing\r\nsigns of improvement in two or three days, should also be the object of a\r\nphysician\'s visit, as a fracture near a joint, if not correctly treated\r\nearly, may result in permanent deformity.\r\n\r\nThe camp physician, or director, if he himself assumes the medical\r\nresponsibilities, should enforce the rule that all boys who do not have a\r\ndaily movement of the bowels see him, and he should always be ready to\r\nreceive such cases and give them the necessary treatment.\r\n\r\nThe drawings by Albert G. Wegener illustrate in a general way what the\r\ntrouble is when one feels a distinct, persistent pain.\r\n\r\nAmong healthy boys, in camp, thoracic pains, other than those due to\r\nmuscular strain, are uncommon, but when severe, especially if accompanied\r\nby a rise of temperature (over 99.5 degrees) and not readily succumbing to\r\nrest in bed, should be investigated by a physician.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sites of Pain.]\r\n\r\nPAIN\r\n\r\nThe accompanying diagrams indicate what ailment may be looked for if there\r\nis a persistent pain.

Care in sanitation minimizes the likelihood of such a\r\ndisease springing up in the camp. Other infections, such as mumps,\r\nconjunctivitis, etc., should be carefully isolated, and all precautions\r\ntaken to prevent their spread.\r\n\r\nA fairly common event may be toward evening to find a boy with a headache\r\nand a temperature perhaps of 102 degrees. This will probably be all right\r\nin the morning after a night\'s rest and perhaps the administration also of\r\na cathartic.\r\n\r\nThe Dentist\r\n\r\nThe importance of a visit to the dentist before coming to camp cannot be\r\nover-estimated. Every one knows the torture of a toothache, and realizes\r\nhow unbearable it must be for a boy away from home and among other boys,\r\nsympathetic, of course, but busy having a good time, and with only a few\r\npatent gums to relieve the misery, and the dentist perhaps not available\r\nfor two days. Parents cannot have this point too forcibly thrust upon\r\nthem, as by even a single visit to a competent dentist all the sufferings\r\nof toothache may usually be prevented.\r\n\r\nSurgical Supplies\r\n\r\nThe following list of surgical supplies will be found necessary. The\r\nquantity must be determined by the size of the camp, and the price by the\r\nfirm from whom purchased.\r\n\r\nSurgical Supplies\r\n\r\nOne-half dozen assorted gauze bandages, sizes one to three\r\ninches, 10 cents each.\r\nTwo yards sterilized plain gauze in carton, 20 cents a yard.\r\nOne roll three-inch adhesive plaster, $1.00.\r\nOne paper medium size safety pins, 10 cents.\r\nOne paper medium size common pins, 5 cents.\r\nFour ounces sterilized absorbent cotton in cartons, 20 cents.\r\nOne-half dozen assorted egg-eyed surgeon\'s needles, straight to\r\nfull curve, 50 cents.\r\nOne card braided silk ligature, assorted in one card (white), about\r\n30 cents.\r\nOne hundred ordinary corrosive sublimate tablets, 25 cents.\r\nSmall surgical instrument set, comprising (F.

The camp leader should have a knowledge of the ordinary ailments of\r\ngrowing boys and simple remedies for relief. No camp of fifty or more boys\r\nshould be without a physician or some upper class medical student of high\r\nmoral character. Don\'t run risks. When in doubt, call in a physician. The\r\ntreatment of local disorders described is largely from nature\'s medicine\r\nchest, and simple in application.\r\n\r\nBites and Stings\r\n\r\nPut on salt and water, or make a paste of soda and water, or rub the wound\r\nwith aromatic ammonia, camphor, or tar soap. Common salt is excellent.\r\n\r\nBleeding Nose\r\n\r\nDo not blow the nose. Hold a wet handkerchief at the back of the neck and\r\nwash the face in hot water, or place a wad of paper under the upper lip,\r\nor crowd some fine gauze or cotton into the nostrils and make a plug.\r\n\r\nTo Check Bleeding\r\n\r\nRaise the injured part as high as you can above the heart, press very\r\nfirmly with sterile pad under thumb or fingers on or into the wound. Blood\r\nfrom a vein will be dark red or purplish and will flow in a steady stream.\r\nPress upon the vein below the wound. Put on a clean pad and bind it upon\r\nthe wound firmly enough to stop bleeding. Blood from an artery will be\r\nbright red and will probably spurt in jets. Press very hard above the\r\nwound. Tie a strong bandage (handkerchief, belt, suspenders, rope, strip\r\nof clothing) around the wounded member, and between the wound and the\r\nheart. Under it and directly over the artery place a smooth pebble, piece\r\nof stick, or other hard lump. Then thrust a stout stick under the bandage\r\nand twist until the wound stops bleeding. A tourniquet should not remain\r\nover twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nBlisters\r\n\r\nWash blistered feet in hot water and then in alcohol or in cold water with\r\na little baking powder or soda added. Wipe them dry and then rub them with\r\na tallow candle or some fat.\r\n\r\nBruises\r\n\r\nApply compresses of hot or cold water to keep down swelling and\r\ndiscoloration. Also apply witch hazel.\r\n\r\nBurns\r\n\r\nUse vaseline, baking soda, bread, the white of an egg, flour and water,\r\nbutter, grease, or fat; or mix flour and soda with fat, or soap with sugar\r\nand make into a paste, or put a teaspoonful of baking powder into a pint\r\nof warm water and pour it on a piece of gauze and put this on the burn or\r\nscald, covering it with cotton and a bandage. Never let a burn be exposed\r\nto the air, but cover it at once if the pain is intense.\r\n\r\nChills\r\n\r\nMix a good dash of pepper with a little ginger in sweetened hot water and\r\ndrink it. Get into bed at once. Cover with blankets and put hot water\r\nbottle at feet.\r\n\r\nChoking\r\n\r\nForce yourself to swallow pieces of dry bread or drink some water. Let\r\nsome one slap the back.\r\n\r\nColds\r\n\r\nPour boiling water over two heads of elder blossoms, brew for twenty\r\nminutes, and drink a small cup hot on going to bed. Or drink hot lemonade\r\nor hot ginger tea. In any case, keep warm and out of a draft.\r\n\r\nConstipation\r\n\r\nUse cathartic pills, or castor oil.  Eat plenty of prunes or fruit. Drink\r\nplenty of water.\r\n\r\nCuts\r\n\r\nAlways clean thoroughly all open wounds to prevent infection, and\r\naccelerate healing. Carbolic, left on a wound for any time at all may\r\nresult in carbolic poisoning or in gangrene. Use pure alcohol (not wood or\r\ndenatured, as both are poisonous), or a teaspoonful of sulphur-naphthol to\r\na basin of water, or 1:1000 corrosive sublimate solution (wad with\r\nflexible collodion). Do not use vaseline  or any other substance on a\r\nfreshly abrased surface. After a scab has formed, vaseline may be applied\r\nto keep this scab soft. Never close a wound with court plaster[1]. The\r\nonly legitimate uses for sticking or adhesive plaster are to hold\r\ndressings in place where bandaging is difficult, or in case of a cut to\r\nkeep edges closed without sewing the skin.\r\n\r\n[Transcriber\'s Footnote 1: Cloth coated with adhesive substance to cover\r\ncuts or scratches on the skin.]\r\n\r\nEarache\r\n\r\nTake the heart of an onion, heat it in an oven, and put it in the ear when\r\nhot, but not so hot as to burn the ear. This not only relieves the\r\nearache, but helps to send the sufferer to sleep. Hold hot water bag to\r\near.\r\n\r\nInflamed Eye\r\n\r\nWring a towel in water hot as the hands will bear; lay on the eyes and\r\nchange frequently. Bathe with saturated solution of boric acid crystals.\r\n\r\nGreat relief is felt by opening the eyes in tepid or very warm boracic\r\nsolution. Even if it is strong enough to smart, no harm will result.\r\n\r\nIf inflammation is caused by a foreign substance, rub the other eye, in\r\norder to make both eyes water. If the speck can be seen, it can generally\r\nbe taken out by twisting a small piece of gauze or cloth around a\r\ntoothpick and drawing it over the speck, or by twisting up a piece of\r\npaper like a lamp lighter and, after wetting the tip of it, wiping it\r\nagainst the speck. If it is under the upper lid, pull the lid away from\r\nthe eyeball, and push the under lid up underneath the upper one. In this\r\nway the eyelashes of the lower lid will generally clean the inside of the\r\nupper one. An eye-tweezers for removing a piece of grit from the eye is\r\nmade by folding a piece of paper in two. With a sharp knife cut it to a\r\npoint at an angle of 30 degrees and slightly moisten the point in clean\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nFeet\r\n\r\nIt is a good thing to dry-soap your feet and the inside of your socks\r\nbefore putting them on for a hike or tramp. This is an old army trick. If\r\nyour feet perspire freely, powder them with boric acid powder, starch, and\r\noxide of zinc in equal parts. Wash the feet every day, best on turning in\r\nat night.\r\n\r\nTo prevent the nail growing into the toe, take a bit of broken glass and\r\nscrape down the top of the nail until it is quite thin, and in time the\r\ncorners begin to grow out, and no longer hurt the toe. Toenails should be\r\ncut square and not encouraged to grow in by side trimming. A good plan is\r\nto make a "V" shape notch on the middle of the top of each toenail, which\r\nwill close up naturally, and, in so doing, draw the sides up and inward.\r\n\r\nHeadache\r\n\r\nHeadache comes from indigestion or from the sun. A boy will overeat and\r\nthen play under the hot sun--result, headache. Have the boy lie down and\r\nsleep, if possible, using cloths dipped in cold water to drive the blood\r\naway from the head. A remedy recommended by the great John Wesley is to\r\nlay very thin slices of lemon rind on either temple.\r\n\r\nHiccough\r\n\r\nTake a deep breath and hold it as long as possible, or make yourself\r\nsneeze.\r\n\r\nIvy Poisoning\r\n\r\nMix some baking powder with water, or rub on wood ashes. Wash with\r\nalcohol. Be careful not to spread by scratching.\r\n\r\nRusty Nail\r\n\r\nBetter call a physician. Puncture with nails and such things, especially\r\nif rusty, should be squeezed and washed with sulphur-naphthol or hot water\r\npoured into the hole. If too small, this may be slightly enlarged.\r\nCauterize with carbolic acid, then with pure alcohol. Keep the wound open\r\nfor a few days. Run no risk with a rusty nail wound. Attend to it\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nSprains\r\n\r\nBathe a sprain in as hot water as you can bear, to which has been added a\r\nsmall quantity of vinegar and salt. Slight sprains (as of finger) may be\r\npainted with iodine.\r\n\r\nSunstroke\r\n\r\nThe first symptom is a headache followed by a heavy feeling in the pit of\r\nthe stomach, dimmed eyesight, difficulty in breathing, and a fever. If\r\ninsensibility follows, lay the person on his back in a cool, shady place,\r\nwith his head slightly raised. Loosen his clothing, keep his head cold\r\nwith wet cloths, and pour cold water on his face and chest, until the\r\ntemperature of his body is lowered and the face becomes pale.\r\n\r\nSunburn\r\n\r\nGet used to sun gradually. Use powdered boric acid or ointment. Cocoa\r\nbutter is also a good preventive.\r\n\r\nSore Throat\r\n\r\nGargle the throat with warm water and some salt added, and then bind a\r\nwoolen sock around it. Keep the sock on until the soreness is gone. Put\r\nteaspoonful of chlorate of potash in a cup of water and gargle. Diluted\r\nalkalol [sic] is also good for a gargle, or tincture of iron diluted. Fat\r\nbacon or pork may be tied around the neck with a dry sock. Swab the\r\nthroat.\r\n\r\nStomachache\r\n\r\nCaused by undigested food in the intestines. Put the boy on a diet, also\r\ngive him plenty of warm water to drink, or a cup of hot ginger tea.\r\n\r\nToothache\r\n\r\nHeat will always help to soothe the sufferer. A seeded raisin, toasted\r\nbefore the fire, makes a useful poultice for an aching tooth, pressed into\r\nthe hollow. A bag of hot salt, pressed on the face, relieves pain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Drill in First Aid]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV--FIRST AID TO THE INJURED\r\n\r\nFirst aid should teach every boy how to render temporary assistance by\r\nimprovised means for the relief of the injured one, and the methods by\r\nwhich he can be removed to a place of safety. With this in view, the\r\ninformation given in this chapter incorporates what every camper should\r\nknow. Before going to camp, boys should be taught the use of the\r\nTriangular Bandage. This bandage is used by the United States Government,\r\nand is well suited for an emergency bandage. It can be easily made from a\r\nhandkerchief or a piece of linen. The American Red Cross First Aid Outfit\r\ncontains a triangular bandage, with methods of application printed\r\nthereon. The gauze or roller bandage is more difficult to handle. This,\r\nhowever, is the bandage to control bleeding, etc. Any reliable book on\r\nFirst Aid gives information as to its manipulation.\r\n\r\nDislocation\r\n\r\nA dislocation of the finger or toe can generally be reduced by pulling\r\nstrongly and at the same time pressing where the dislocation is. If the\r\nhip, shoulder, or elbow is dislocated, do not meddle with the joint, but\r\nmake the boy as comfortable as possible by surrounding the joint with\r\nflannel cloths wrung out in hot water; support with soft pads, and send\r\nfor a doctor at once. If the spine is dislocated, lay the boy on his back.\r\nNever put him on his side or face, it may be fatal. If he is cold, apply\r\nhot blankets to his body, hot water bottle or hot salt bag to the seat of\r\npain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Triangular Bandage; Method of Folding Triangular Bandage\r\nfor Use; Bandage should always be secured by means of a reef knot.]\r\n\r\nBroken Bones\r\n\r\nDo not try to reduce the fracture if a physician can be secured, for\r\nunskilled handling will do more harm than good. The thing to do is to make\r\nthe boy comfortable by placing him in a comfortable position with the\r\ninjured part resting on a pad, keeping him perfectly quiet. If there is an\r\nopen wound, cover it with cheesecloth or gauze which has been dipped in\r\nboiling water, to which baking soda has been added. Then wrap absorbent\r\ncotton around it. If the boy has a fever, put wet cloths on his head,\r\nswinging them in the air to cool for changing.\r\n\r\nTHE FOLLOWING PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS ARE GIVEN IN "CAMP KITS AND CAMP\r\nLIFE," BY CHARLES STEDMAN HANKS.\r\n\r\nNose\r\n\r\nIf the nose is broken, plug with gauze to stop bleeding.\r\n\r\nJaw\r\n\r\nIf the jaw is broken, push the bone gently into place, and if there is an\r\nopen wound, cover it  with gauze or cotton, made antiseptically, and then\r\nput a bandage around the jaw.\r\n\r\nCollar Bone\r\n\r\nIf the collar bone is broken, it will be known by the pain in the shoulder\r\nand the shoulder dropping. Holding the elbow up will relieve the weight\r\nfrom the collar bone. Lay the boy on his back. Put a cotton wad in his\r\narmpit and bandage the arm to the side of the body and put the arm in a\r\nsling.\r\n\r\nShoulder Blade\r\n\r\nIf the shoulder blade is broken, put the forearm across the chest with the\r\nfingers on the shoulder and then bandage the arm to the body.\r\n\r\nRib\r\n\r\nIf a rib is broken it will pain the patient when he takes a long breath.\r\nPut him on his back, resting a little on the uninjured side, so that he\r\nwill breathe easily. If it is necessary to move him, bandage strips of\r\nadhesive plaster around the body, beginning at the lowest rib and working\r\nupward, having each strip lap over the one below it. If you have no\r\nadhesive plaster, use a wide strip of cotton cloth. After you have put his\r\ncoat on, pin it as tightly as you can in the back.\r\n\r\nLeg Above Knee\r\n\r\nIf the leg is broken above the knee, lay shoulders slightly back, with the\r\nhead and shoulders slightly raised. Draw the leg out straight, and, after\r\npadding it with cotton or towels, cut a small sapling long enough to reach\r\nfrom the foot to the armpit, and fasten it at the ankle, knee, and waist.\r\nIf it is necessary to move the boy, bind both legs firmly together.\r\n\r\nLeg Below Knee\r\n\r\nIf the leg is broken below the knee, lay the boy on his back and put a\r\npillow or a bag stuffed with grass lengthwise under it. Then put a board\r\nor a hewed sapling on the under side of the pillow to stiffen it, and\r\nbandage the pillow and the board or sapling firmly to the leg. If the boy\r\nhas to be moved, bind both legs together.\r\n\r\nKnee Pan\r\n\r\nIf the knee pan is broken, put the boy on his back and straighten out the\r\nleg on a padded splint which reaches from the heel to the hip, putting\r\nsome cotton or a folded towel under the knee and the heel. Then bandage\r\nthe splint on at the ankle, at the upper part of the leg, and above and\r\nbelow the knee pan.\r\n\r\nFoot\r\n\r\nIf the foot is broken, make a splint of two pieces of wood held together\r\nat right angles, and, after padding the foot with cotton, bind the splint\r\nto the side of the foot and the leg.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Large arm sling as a support for the forearm.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Large arm sling as a support for the elbow.]\r\n\r\n\r\nUpper Arm\r\n\r\nIf the upper arm is broken, make three splints, one long enough to reach\r\nfrom the shoulder to the elbow to go on the outside of the arm, one to go\r\non the inner side of the arm, and one on the back of the arm. Pad the arm\r\nfrom the armpit to the elbow with cotton, towels, or newspapers wrapped in\r\ncloth, and, after bandaging on the splints, put the forearm in a sling and\r\nbind the arm to the body.\r\n\r\nForearm\r\n\r\nIf the forearm is broken, make a cotton pad long enough to reach from the\r\nfingers well up to the forearm, and rest the palm of the hand on it. Put a\r\nsimilar pad on the back of the hand, and, after bandaging in a splint, put\r\nthe arm in a sling.\r\n\r\nHand\r\n\r\nIf the hand is broken, put a cotton pad on the palm and over it a thin\r\nsplint long enough to reach from the tips of the fingers to the forearm.\r\nAfter binding the splint in place, put the arm in a sling with the hand\r\nhigher than the elbow.\r\n\r\nFinger\r\n\r\nIf a finger is broken, make a splint of cardboard or a thin piece of wood\r\nlong enough to reach from the tip of the finger to the wrist. Cover the\r\nfinger with gauze or cotton, and, after binding on the splint, support the\r\nhand in a sling.\r\n\r\nFainting\r\n\r\nFainting comes from too little blood in the head. Lay the boy on his back\r\nwith feet higher than his head. Loosen tight clothing and let him have\r\nplenty of fresh air. Sprinkle his face with cold water and rub his arms\r\nwith it. For an attack of dizziness, bend the head down firmly between the\r\nknees. If his face is flushed, raise the head.\r\n\r\nStunned\r\n\r\nLay the boy on his back with head somewhat raised. Apply heat, such as\r\nbottles of hot water, hot plates or stones wrapped in towels to the\r\nextremities and over the stomach, but keep the head cool with wet cloths.\r\nDo not give any stimulant; it would drive blood to the brain.\r\n\r\nStretcher\r\n\r\nA stretcher may be improvised in one of the following ways: (a) A shutter,\r\ndoor, or gate covered well with straw, hay, clothing, or burlap bagging.\r\n\r\n(b) A piece of carpet, blanket, sacking, tarlatan, spread out, and two\r\nstout poles rolled up in the sides. Put clothes for a pillow.\r\n\r\n(c) A coat with the two sleeves turned inside out; pass two poles through\r\nthe sleeves, button the coat over them. (See illustration.) Patient sits\r\non coat and rests against the back of the first bearer.\r\n\r\n(d) Two poles passed through a couple of bags, through holes at bottom\r\ncorners of each.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Coat Stretcher]\r\n\r\nCarry a patient by walking out of step, and take short paces, about 18\r\ninches apart. Usually carry the patient feet first, but in going up hill\r\nthe position is reversed, and the patient is carried head first.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Life Saving Patrol]\r\n\r\nThe following illustrations explain the process of carrying a patient\r\nwithout a stretcher:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Three and four handed carry.]\r\n\r\nPREVENTION FROM DROWNING\r\n\r\nLearn to Swim\r\n\r\nEvery summer records its hundreds of drowning accidents, many of which\r\nmight have been prevented if methods of rescue had been generally taught.\r\nNo boy should be permitted to enter a boat, particularly a canoe, until he\r\nhas learned to swim. The movement to teach swimming to every boy and young\r\nman in North America who does not know how to swim is both commendable and\r\npractical. The text-book used largely is "At Home in the Water," by George\r\nH. Corsan, issued by the publishers of this book.\r\n\r\nButton Awards\r\n\r\nSummer camps provide a special opportunity for giving such instruction. To\r\neach individual who is actually taught to swim in camp a silver-oxidized\r\nbutton is given by the Association\'s International Committee, 124 East\r\n28th St., New York, provided the test is made under the supervision of a\r\ncommittee of three men. Those who teach others to swim receive a gold\r\noxidized leader\'s button. Write to the Physical Department at the above\r\naddress for information.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Award Button]\r\n\r\nU. S. V. Life Saving Corps\r\n\r\nAn Auxiliary Division of the U. S. Volunteer Life Saving Corps should be\r\nestablished to patrol the water during swimming periods. Any camper may\r\nqualify for membership by taking the following examinations: the boy to\r\nreceive not less than 6 points in 10 point subjects, and not less than 3\r\npoints on 5 point subjects, with a total of 75 points. Those receiving\r\nless than 75 points may become members of auxiliary crews.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Award Button]\r\n\r\nHOW TO QUALIFY.\r\n 1 Swimming not less than 100 yards and 25 yards on back. 10 points\r\n 2 Diving, plunging, floating, fetching. 10 points\r\n 3 Rescue drill on land and water.  10 points\r\n 4 Release drill on land and in water. 10 points\r\n 5 Resuscitation.  10 points\r\n 6 Names of parts of a row boat. 5 points\r\n 7 Rowing and boat handling. 10 points\r\n 8 Use of life saving appliances.  10 points\r\n 9 First aid work and remedies.  10 points\r\n10 Written examination on work in water. 5 points\r\n11 Written examination on work in boats. 5 points\r\n12 Written examination on work on land. 5 points\r\n\r\nOrganization\r\n\r\nTo organize at camps, officials will proceed by conducting the\r\nabove-mentioned examinations. Should there be five or more successful\r\ncompetitors, crews can be organized as follows, the regular form of\r\nenrollment being employed and no enlistments required:\r\n\r\nFive men constitute a crew entitling one of the five to the rank of acting\r\nthird lieutenant.\r\n\r\nTen men constitute two crews with acting second and third lieutenants.\r\n\r\nFifteen men constitute three crews with acting first, second, and third\r\nlieutenants.\r\n\r\nTwenty men constitute four crews (or a division) with acting captain,\r\nfirst, second, and third lieutenants, lieutenant surgeon, quartermaster,\r\nboatswain, and one coxswain for each crew or three coxswains.\r\n\r\nAuxiliary members over eighteen years of age may become active members\r\nafter leaving camps and receive active membership commissions, provided\r\nthey affiliate with some active permanent crew in their home district.\r\n\r\nAuxiliary members holding our certificates shall be entitled to auxiliary\r\nmembership buttons, but active members only are entitled to wear the\r\nofficial badge of membership of the corps.\r\n\r\nSummer camps will be equipped, at the discretion of headquarters, on the\r\nfollowing conditions:\r\n\r\nThat they shall pay all express on supplies to and from camps.\r\n\r\nThat they shall report at the end of each season the exact condition of\r\nthe supplies and make provision for the safekeeping of same for future\r\nseasons, or return same.\r\n\r\nMedicine chests must be returned.\r\n\r\nInstructors will be sent to the various camps, at the discretion of\r\nheadquarters, whenever possible. All expenses, traveling, board, etc., but\r\nnot services, must be covered by the camps.\r\n\r\nExamination questions will be found in our book, "Instruction on Subjects\r\nfor Examination for Membership." If desired, camp officials can make\r\nexaminations more rigid than outlined by us.\r\n\r\nExamination papers furnished on request.\r\n\r\nThe above information was furnished by K. F. Mehrtens, Assistant\r\nSecretary, United States Volunteer Life Saving Corps, 63-65 Park Row, New\r\nYork City.\r\n\r\nTraining Course\r\n\r\nEfficient life saving comes from thorough experience and training, not\r\nfrom a theory. These subjects for instruction may be taught preparatory to\r\nthe summer camp, as well as during the camping season.\r\n\r\nSwimming to include straight-away, swimming with clothes on, floating,\r\ndiving, fetching: strokes--perfect breast stroke, side stroke, overhead\r\nstroke, crawl stroke.\r\n\r\nRescue Methods to include rescuing a supposedly drowning person. Use of\r\nlife saving apparatus.\r\n\r\nMethods of Release to include grasping by the wrist, clutch around the\r\nneck and grasp around the body.\r\n\r\nResuscitation of the apparently drowned, including the Sylvester method\r\ndescribed on page 194, and the simple "first aid" rules.\r\n\r\nBoat Handling to include rowing a boat, taking a person into a boat from\r\nthe water, clinging to a boat without capsizing it, etc.\r\n\r\nKnot Tying to include all kinds of knots and their value in connection\r\nwith life-saving work, and the use of them on life-saving appliances.\r\n\r\nWig-wagging to include the committing to memory of the U. S. Naval Wig-Wag\r\nSignal Code. The following is used at Camp Wawayanda, New Jersey Boys.\r\n\r\nWIG-WAG CODE\r\n\r\nSignalling by wig-wag is carried on by waving a flag in certain ways,\r\nrepresented by the figures 1, 2 and 3, and thus letters are made and words\r\nspelled.\r\n\r\nTwo wig-wag flags are used, one a square white flag with a red square in\r\nthe center, and the other a square red flag with white square in the\r\ncenter.\r\n\r\nOnly one flag is used in signalling, and that one is selected which can\r\nbest be seen against the boy\'s background.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Interval;    Signal 1;    Signal 2;    Signal 3]\r\n\r\nU.

The motion represented by the Figure 1 is made by waving the flag down\r\nto the right; 2, by waving it down to the left; and 3, by waving it down\r\nin front of the sender. (Page 188)\r\n\r\n3. Each motion should embrace an arc of ninety degrees, starting from and\r\nreturning to the vertical without a pause.\r\n\r\n4. When two or more motions are required to make a letter, there should be\r\nno pause between the motions.\r\n\r\n5. At the end of each letter there should be a slight pause at the\r\nvertical.\r\n\r\n6. At the end of each word, one front motion (3) should be made; at the\r\nend of a sentence, two fronts (33); and at the end of a message, three\r\nfronts (333).\r\n\r\n7. To call a boat, signal the initial letter of her name until answered.\r\nTo answer a call, signal A.A. 3 (I understand).\r\n\r\n8. If the sender makes an error he should immediately signal E.E. 3 (I\r\nhave made an error), and resume the message, beginning with the last word\r\nsent correctly.\r\n\r\n9.

It requires a little\r\ncourage and enough strength of mind not to lose your head.\r\n\r\nCramps\r\n\r\nMany boy swimmers make the mistake of going into the water too soon after\r\neating. The stomach and digestive organs are busy preparing the food for\r\nthe blood and body. Suddenly they are called upon to care for the work of\r\nthe swimmer. The change is too quick for the organs, the process of\r\ndigestion stops. Congestion is apt to follow, and then the paralyzing\r\ncramps.\r\n\r\nIndian Method\r\n\r\nThe Indians have a method of protecting themselves from cramps. Coming to\r\na bathing pool, an Indian swimmer, after stripping off and before entering\r\nthe water, vigorously rubs the pit of his stomach with the dry palms of\r\nhis hands. This rubbing probably takes a minute; then he dashes cold water\r\nall over his stomach and continues the rubbing for another minute, and\r\nafter that he is ready for his plunge. If the water in which you are going\r\nto swim is cold, try this Indian method of getting ready before plunging\r\ninto the water.\r\n\r\nRule\r\n\r\nThe rule for entering the water, in most camps, is as follows: "No one of\r\nthe party shall enter the water for swimming or bathing except at time and\r\nplace designated." Laxity in the observance of this rule will result\r\ndisastrously.\r\n\r\nRESCUE FROM DROWNING\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1]\r\n\r\nRescue\r\n\r\nTo rescue a drowning person from the water, always try to pull him out\r\nwith an oar, a rope, a coat (holding the end of one sleeve and throwing\r\nhim the other), or some other convenient object. If you are obliged to\r\njump in after him, approach him with great caution, throw your left arm\r\naround his neck with his back to your side (Figure 1), in which position\r\nhe can\'t grapple you, and swim with your legs and right arm. If he should\r\nsucceed in grasping you, take a long breath, sink with him, place your\r\nfeet or knees against his body, and push yourself free.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2]\r\n\r\nAlthough life may seem extinct, make every effort at resuscitation.\r\nVarious procedures are advocated. The Sylvester method is one of the best.\r\n\r\nHold the boy for it few seconds as in Figure 2, to get rid of water which\r\nmay have been taken in. Do this several times. Tear off clothing. Rub\r\nbriskly the legs and arms toward the body. Draw the tongue forward every\r\nthree seconds for a minute. If these methods fail to restore breathing,\r\nthen perform artificial respiration, first sending for a physician.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Respiration]\r\n\r\nLay the boy on his back with a folded coat or sweater under his shoulders,\r\nand grasp his wrists or his arms straight up over his head as in Figure 3.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3. RESPIRATION]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4. EXPIRATION]\r\n\r\nPull steadily and firmly in that position while you count 1, 2, 3. This\r\ncauses air to enter the lungs. Then quickly bring his arms down on his\r\nchest and press them firmly on his ribs (Figure 4) while you again count\r\n1, 2, 3. This forces the air out of the lungs. Then quickly carry his arms\r\nover his head and down again, and repeat the same routine fast enough to\r\nmake him breathe from twelve to sixteen times a minute. The tendency is to\r\nwork too fast. If the work is done properly the air can be heard\r\ndistinctly as it passes in and out of the air passages. Sometimes the\r\ntongue drops back in the throat, stopping it up so no air can enter. If\r\nyou suspect this, have an assistant grasp the tongue with a handkerchief\r\nand keep it pulled forward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5. Expiration.]\r\n\r\nCuts used by courtesy of Health-Education League.\r\n\r\nDon\'t Give Up\r\n\r\nIt will make it much easier if you have another person push on the ribs\r\nfor you when you relax the arms, as shown in Figure 5. Have him place the\r\nhands as shown in the figure with the thumbs toward the medium line in\r\nfront, the fingers farther away, the palms just below the breasts; this\r\nwill make the boy\'s nipples come just midway between the ends of the\r\nthumbs and the middle joint of the forefinger. Press firmly downward and\r\ninward toward the backbone.\r\n\r\nContinue these motions about fifteen times per minute. Keep this up until\r\nthe boy begins to breathe, himself. When done properly, the work is hard\r\nfor the operator, and he should be relieved by some one else as soon as he\r\ngets tired.\r\n\r\nWarmth and Quiet\r\n\r\nAs soon as the boy begins to breathe himself--but not before--his limbs\r\nshould be well rubbed toward the heart. This will  help to restore the\r\ncirculation. He should afterward be put to bed, well covered with warm\r\nblankets, hot stones being placed at his feet, and warm drinks\r\nadministered. Fresh air and quiet will do the rest.\r\n\r\nBooks\r\n\r\n"Boys\' Drill Regulation," published by the National First Aid Association\r\nof America, and "Boys\' Life Brigade Manual of Drill," published by the\r\nBoys\' Life Brigade, London, England, are two small books containing a\r\nnumber of practical drills which may be used in training the boys in camp\r\nfor emergency work.\r\n\r\nInstruction\r\n\r\nEvery camp for boys, no matter how small or how large, should plan for\r\ninstruction  in First Aid. This may be done by the camp physician, the\r\ndirector, the physical director, or some physician invited to spend\r\nseveral days in the camp.\r\n\r\nDrills\r\n\r\nThe illustration on page 174 shows how one hundred boys were trained in\r\nCamp Couchiching. The "litter" drill was especially attractive to the boys\r\nof Camp Becket. The boys were sent out in the woods in brigades of five\r\neach, one of whom was the leader. Only a small hatchet was taken by each\r\nsquad. One of the boys was supposed to have broken his leg. An improvised\r\n"litter," or, stretcher, was made of saplings or boughs, strapped together\r\nwith handkerchiefs and belts, so that in ten minutes after they left the\r\ncamp the first squad returned with the boy on the litter and in a fairly\r\ncomfortable condition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Litter Drill]\r\n\r\nHealth Talks\r\n\r\nA course of health talks given in popular form by those who are well\r\nversed upon the subject, cannot help but be instructive and productive of\r\na greater ambition on the part of the boy to take good care of his body.\r\nThe following list of subjects is suggestive:\r\n\r\nThe Human Body and How to Keep It in Health\r\n1 The Skeleton.\r\n2 The Muscular System.\r\n3 The Vascular System.\r\n4 The Nervous System.\r\n5 The Digestive System.\r\n6 The Lungs, Skin and Kidneys.\r\n\r\nPersonal Hygiene\r\n1  The Eye, its use and abuse.\r\n2  How to care for the Teeth.\r\n3  Breathing and pure air.\r\n4  Microbes and keeping clean.\r\n7  The health of the Skin.\r\n8  Some facts about the Nose.\r\n9  Our Lungs.\r\n10 Eating.\r\n11 Alcohol.\r\n12 Tobacco and the Human Body.\r\n13 The Use and Care of Finger Nails.\r\n14 Cause of Colds.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe American Red Cross Society, 715 Union Trust Bldg., Washington, D.

The causes of most skin\r\ndiseases are largely traceable to diet. Chew the food slowly. Don\'t "bolt"\r\nfood. Your stomach is not like that of a dog. Food must be thoroughly\r\nmasticated and moistened with saliva. Hasty chewing and swallowing of food\r\nmakes masses which tend to sour and become poison. This often accounts for\r\nthe belching of gas, sense of burning and pain, and other forms of\r\ndistress after eating. Drink before or after meals. Don\'t overeat.\r\nConversation aids digestion. Eating between meals is detrimental to good\r\ndigestion. Regular meal hours should prevail. After dinner is the best\r\ntime to eat candy or sweets.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Camp Tooth Brush]\r\n\r\nThe Teeth\r\n\r\nIf the tooth brush gets lost make one out of a dry stick, about six inches\r\nlong, which can be frayed out at the ends like the illustration. A clean\r\nmouth is as important as a clean body. The teeth should be cleaned twice a\r\nday, morning and evening. Insist upon the bringing of a tooth brush to\r\ncamp. Impress upon the boys that time spent upon teeth cleansing will\r\nprevent hours of agony upon a dentist chair. Cleansing the teeth of sticky\r\ndeposits by running fine threads between them, in addition to the use of a\r\nbrush and a simple powder, prevents deposits from becoming the starting\r\npoint of decay.\r\n\r\nThe Hands\r\n\r\nCare of hands and nails is much neglected in camp, Nails should be\r\nproperly trimmed and the "mourning" removed from underneath the nails. The\r\nhabit of biting the finger nails is dangerous. Finger nails should be cut\r\nonce a week with sharp scissors or "clip." If the nails be neglected and a\r\nscratch received from the infected fingers the system may be inoculated\r\nwith disease. The cleansing of the hands after using the lavatory needs\r\nspecial emphasis, for in no place do more germs collect and spread. Boys\r\nshould not be permitted to use each other\'s towels, combs, brushes, or\r\nsoap. A towel may carry germs from one boy to another.\r\n\r\nThe Eyes\r\n\r\nNever strain the eyes. When reading, always let the light come over the\r\nshoulder and upon the page, the eyes being in the shadow. Do not read with\r\nthe sunlight streaming across the page. When writing have the light come\r\nfrom the left side. Do not rub the eyes with the hands. Headaches and\r\nnervousness are due largely to defective vision. "Work, play, rest and\r\nsleep, muscular exercise, wise feeding, and regular removal of the\r\nwaste--these and all other hygienic habits help to keep the eyes sound and\r\nstrong."--Sedgewick.\r\n\r\nThe Ear\r\n\r\nIt is dangerous to put a pointed pencil or anything sharpened into the\r\near. "Boxing" the ear, shouting in the ear, exploding a paper bag, may\r\nsplit the drum and cause deafness. The best way to remove excess wax from\r\nthe ear is to use a soft, damp cloth over the end of the finger. Ear-wax\r\nis a protection against insects getting in from the outside.\r\n\r\nThe Nose\r\n\r\nKeep the nose free from obstructions, and avoid the use of dirty\r\nhandkerchiefs. Always breathe through the nose and not through the mouth.\r\nBoys who observe this rule will not get thirsty while on a hike or get out\r\nof breath so easily. They don\'t breathe in all sorts of microbes or seeds\r\nof disease, and they don\'t snore at night.\r\n\r\nThe Hair\r\n\r\nIn washing the hair avoid using soap more than once a week, as it removes\r\nthe natural oil of the hair. Frequent combing and brushing adds to the\r\nlustre, and the head gets a beneficial form of massage. Wear no hat at\r\ncamp, except to protect from sun rays or rain.\r\n\r\nThe Feet\r\n\r\nFootwear is a matter of importance. Shoes should never be worn too tight.\r\nThey not only hinder free movements, but also hinder the blood\r\ncirculation, and cause coldness and numbness of the extremities. Sore\r\nfeet, because of ill-fitting shoes, are a detriment to happy camp life.\r\nHave good, well-fitting, roomy shoes, and fairly stout ones. Keep the feet\r\ndry. If they are allowed to get wet, the skin is softened and very soon\r\ngets blistered and rubbed raw.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 1.      Figure 2.]\r\n\r\nFigure 1 shows a perfectly shaped foot. This is the natural shape, and if\r\nthe boy is allowed to go barefooted or wear sandals, his foot will assume\r\nthis shape. Figure 2 shows the distorted shape brought about by cramped\r\nshoes. The best thing to wear is thick moccasins of moose hide.\r\n\r\nInternal Organs\r\n\r\nConstipation is a frequent camp complaint, and is usually the result of\r\nchange in diet and drinking water. The habit of having a daily movement of\r\nthe bowels is of great importance to a boy\'s health. The retention of\r\nthese waste products within the body for a longer period tends to produce\r\npoisonous impurities of the blood, a muddy-looking skin, headaches, piles,\r\nand many other evils. Eat plenty of fruit, prunes, and graham bread. Drink\r\nplenty of water. Take plenty of exercise.\r\n\r\nBathing\r\n\r\nOne bath a day in fresh water is all that is necessary. Boys go into the\r\nwater too often and remain too long. This accounts for the rundown\r\nappearance of some boys. The body gives off heat every minute it is in\r\ncool water, and also when exposed wet to the breezes, and heat is life.\r\nAll boys should be encouraged to take a dip before breakfast with a rapid\r\nrubdown. Then a good swim in the warm part of the day. Usually about 11:30\r\nA.M. is a good time for the swim. If a swim is taken after supper, be\r\ncareful to dress warm afterward.\r\n\r\nSleep\r\n\r\nNormal boys need nine or ten hours sleep. Sleep is a time for physical\r\ngrowth. Have the tent open back and front at night to insure plenty of\r\nfresh air. There must be a complete change of clothing on retiring.\r\nFlannel clothing should be worn at night. Sleep alone. Nine o\'clock or\r\nnine-thirty, at latest, should find every boy in bed.\r\n\r\nClothing\r\n\r\nWear clean clothing, particularly underwear. Frequently a rash appearing\r\non the body is a result of wearing dirty-shirts. The wearing of belts\r\ntends to constrict the abdomen, thus hindering the natural action of the\r\nintestines, which is essential to good digestion. Hernia (ruptures) may\r\nresult from wearing tightly drawn belts. To dress the body too warm\r\nlessens the power to resist cold when there happens to be a change in the\r\natmosphere. Put on extra clothing at sundown, without waiting to begin to\r\nfeel cold. During eating of meals it is well to have the legs and arms\r\ncovered when it is at all cool. The cooling of large surfaces of the body\r\nwhile eating, even if it is not noticed, retards digestion, and taxes the\r\nvitality. Many a boy gets a cold by neglecting to take this precaution.\r\n\r\nGENERAL HINTS\r\n\r\nTwo flannel shirts are better than two overcoats.\r\n\r\nDon\'t wring out flannels or woolens. Wash in cold water, very soapy, and\r\nthen hang them up dripping wet, and they will not shrink.\r\n\r\nIf you keep your head from getting hot, and keep your feet dry, there will\r\nbe little danger of sickness.\r\n\r\nIf your head gets too hot, put green leaves inside your hat.\r\n\r\nIf your throat is parched and you can get no water, put a pebble in your\r\nmouth. This will start the saliva and quench the thirst.\r\n\r\nHEALTH MAXIMS AND QUOTATIONS\r\n\r\n"Keep thyself pure."\r\n\r\n"Health is wealth."\r\n\r\n"A sound mind in a sound body."\r\n\r\n"Fresh air and sunshine are necessary to good health."\r\n\r\n"Cleanliness is the best guard against disease."\r\n\r\n"A clean mouth is as important as a clean body."\r\n\r\n"Virtue never dwelt long with filth."\r\n\r\n"Temperance, exercise, and repose\r\nSlam the door on the doctor\'s nose."\r\n--Longfellow.\r\n\r\n"Cleanliness is next to Godliness."\r\n"Health and cheerfulness naturally beget each other."\r\n--Addison.\r\n\r\n"Nor love, nor honor, wealth nor power,\r\nCan give the heart a cheerful hour,\r\nWhen health is lost. Be truly wise.\r\nWith health, all taste of pleasure flies."\r\n--Gay.\r\n\r\n"Health is a second blessing that we mortals are capable of:\r\na blessing that money cannot buy."\r\n--Walton.\r\n\r\n"There are three wicks, you know, to the lamp of a man\'s life: brain,\r\nblood, and breath. Press the brain a little, its light goes out, followed\r\nby both the others. Stop the heart a minute, and out go all three of the\r\nwicks. Choke the air out of the lungs, and presently the fluid ceases to\r\nsupply the other centres of flame, and all is soon stagnation, cold, and\r\ndarkness."\r\n--O. W.

Play is necessary for the growing boy and play that\r\nengages many participants has the most value. America today is suffering\r\nfrom highly specialized, semi-professional athletics and games. "When\r\nathletics degenerate into a mere spectacle, then is the stability of the\r\nnation weakened. Greece led the world, while the youth of that great\r\ncountry deemed it an honor to struggle for the laurel leaf, and gymnasiums\r\nwere everywhere and universally used and the people saw little good in an\r\neducation that neglected the body. It is a significant fact that the\r\ndegeneracy of Greece was synchronous with the degrading of athletics into\r\nmere professional contests. What had been the athletics of the people\r\nbecame a spectacle for the people." [1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Emmett D. Angell in "Play," p. 19.]\r\n\r\nBaseball League\r\n\r\nDo not allow the athletics and games of the camp to become a mere\r\nspectacle for the campers. Something should be planned for every boy and\r\nevery boy encouraged to participate in the program. Nothing has yet taken\r\nthe place of the good old American game of baseball. Divide the camp boys\r\ninto teams. Have a league playing a series of games. The teams may be\r\nnamed after the different colleges or prominent cities or as one camp\r\nnamed the league, the "Food League" after popular camp dishes, such as:\r\n"Prunes," "Beans," "Soup," "Hash," "Mush," "Chipped Beef." It is needless\r\nto state that the boys in the league not only had a lot of fun, but the\r\ncamp paper contained very amusing accounts of the games played.\r\n\r\nArrange a schedule of games and keep accurate records of all games played\r\neither in the "Camp Log" or camp paper. A dinner given to the winning team\r\nadds to the excitement of the league\'s existence. Do not neglect the\r\nyounger boys; have two "Midget" teams engage in a series for best two out\r\nof three games. Occasionally a game between the leaders and older boys is\r\nthe exciting game of the season, especially if the leaders are defeated.\r\n\r\nThe same rule of participation should govern the athletics of the camp.\r\nInter-tent games help to develop group loyalty, cooperation, fair play,\r\nand courtesy to opponents so desirable.\r\n\r\nGroups\r\n\r\nIn some camps the boys are divided into two groups, those under five feet\r\nin height and those over five feet. Events are planned for these two\r\ngroups. The system of grouping suggested by the School Athletic League, is\r\nthat of grouping the boys according to physiological rather than\r\nchronological age, as follows:\r\n  Pre-pubescent boys under 90 pounds.\r\n  Pubescent boys or juniors, 90 to 110 pounds.\r\n  Post-pubescent or intermediates, 110 to 130 pounds.\r\n  Seniors, above 130 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe boys are weighed in competing costume. This system is looked upon as\r\nbeing fair and practical.\r\n\r\nWhat to Avoid\r\n\r\nThe following should be avoided--Marathon runs, sustained effort in and\r\nunder water and competitive long-distance running. The longest sprint race\r\nshould be, for boys, 50 yards, for juniors, 75 yards. No adolescent who is\r\nnot past the pubescent stage should run sprint races longer than 100\r\nyards. Cross-country running is beneficial when taken at a slow pace and\r\nwithout competition. Every boy should be examined for heart weakness\r\nbefore entering the strenuous games.\r\n\r\nThe above is the opinion of physical directors from twenty-one different\r\nStates and may be considered authoritative. This same opinion prevails\r\namong most of the experienced camp leaders and workers among boys.\r\n\r\nEvents\r\n\r\nThe athletics usually planned for camp are: 50 yard dash for boys; 75-yard\r\ndash for juniors; 100 yard dash for seniors; running high jump; running\r\nbroad jump; pole vault; 8 and 12-pound shot-put; baseball throw and relay\r\nrace.\r\n\r\nAwards\r\n\r\nRibbon awards presented to the winners at a special meeting of the campers\r\naid considerably in fostering the true spirit of clean athletics and\r\nwholesome sport and are appreciated by the winners as souvenirs of the\r\ngood-natured contest.\r\n\r\nCamps possessing a stereopticon[1] should secure the set of slides and\r\nlecture accompanying from the Moral Education League of Baltimore, Md.,\r\nentitled "The True Sportsman." Rental terms are five dollars a week and\r\nexpressage.\r\n\r\n[Transcribers Footnote 1: stereopticon: A magic lantern, with two\r\nprojectors arranged to produce dissolving views.]\r\n\r\nA perpetual cup for all-round proficiency, upon which is engraved the name\r\nof each year\'s winner, is a good way of recording the annual athletic\r\nmeet.\r\n\r\nA shield with the names of the winners of the season\'s events painted or\r\nburned upon it and hung up in the camp lodge helps to retain the interest\r\nof the winner in the camp after he has become a "grown-up" or alumnus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Take-off; Cross-section of Take-off;  Jumping Standards;]\r\n\r\nApparatus\r\n\r\nBoys who like to make things may be put to work making various pieces of\r\nathletic apparatus. A Take-Off may be made of a plank or board, 8 inches\r\nwide and 36 inches long, sunk flush with the earth. The outer edge of this\r\nplank is considered the scratch line. Remove the earth to a depth of three\r\ninches and width of twelve inches.\r\n\r\nTo make a pair of jumping standards, first saw out the bottom blocks, each\r\nbeing 10 x 10 inches and 2 inches thick. In the center of each block\r\nchisel out a hole 2 x 2 inches and about 1 inch in depth. Into these holes\r\nfit the ends of the upright pieces, which should be 5 feet long and 2\r\ninches square. Before securing the upright pieces, bore holes an inch\r\napart, into which may be inserted a piece of heavy wire or large wire nail\r\nto hold up the cross piece or jumping stick. Be sure to space the holes\r\nalike on both uprights, so the crosspiece will set level when the standard\r\nis in use. Four 5-inch braces are fastened in at the lower part of the\r\nupright. Study the diagram and you will succeed in making a pretty good\r\npair of standards.\r\n\r\nCampus Games\r\n\r\nAfter supper is usually a period in the camp life rather difficult of\r\noccupation. "Campus Games" appeal to most boys. These games are designed\r\nespecially for the after-supper hour, although they may be played at any\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nCircle Jumping\r\n\r\nStand the boys in a circle with all hands clasped. One of the crowd lies\r\ndown in the center with a rope as long as one-half the diameter of the\r\ncircle. To the end of the rope is tied a small weight like a sand bag. He\r\nwhirls the weight around with the full length of rope revolving with\r\nincreasing rapidity. As it approaches the players, they hop up and let it\r\npass under their feet. The one whose foot is touched is out of the game\r\nand the boy who keeps out of the way of the rope the longest is the\r\nwinner.\r\n\r\nWolf\r\n\r\nHere is a Japanese game full of fun and action. Place a dozen or more boys\r\nin line, and have each fellow place his hands firmly on the shoulders of\r\nthe boy in front of him. Choose one of the fellows for the "Wolf." The\r\nfirst boy at the head of the line is called the "Head" of the Serpent, and\r\nthe last fellow is the "Tail." The "Wolf" stands near the head of the\r\nSerpent until a signal is given. Then he tries to catch the "Tail" without\r\ntouching any other part of the snake. The boys who form the body of the\r\nSerpent protect the "Tail" by wreathing about in all sorts of twists to\r\nprevent the "Wolf" from catching the "Tail." This must be done without\r\nbreaking the line. When the "Tail" is caught, the "Wolf" becomes the\r\n"Head," and the "Tail" becomes the "Wolf." The last boy in line is the\r\n"Tail." The game can be continued until every boy has been the "Wolf."\r\n\r\nRover, All Come Over\r\n\r\nA line is marked dividing the campus. All the boys gather on one side. One\r\nboy in the center endeavors to have them step over the line by calling\r\nout, "Rover, Rover, all come over!" At the word "over" everybody is\r\nexpected to run and cross the line, while the center man endeavors to\r\ncatch one. The one caught must help him catch the others. If any one runs\r\nover before the center man calls "over," he has to go to the aid of the\r\ncatcher. When all are caught the game begins again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: German Nine Pins--Camp Becket]\r\n\r\nIndian and White Man\r\n\r\nThe game of "Indian and White Man" is interesting. A circle is drawn on\r\nthe campus. It is supposed that the white people are travelling over the\r\nprairie, and at night time they prepare to camp. The circle represents\r\ntheir camp. The Whites lie down to sleep and sentries are posted. The\r\nIndians discover the camp and endeavor to capture the Whites. Then comes\r\nthe battle royal. Every Indian captured in the white man\'s circle counts\r\none, and every white man captured by the Indians outside the circle counts\r\none for their side. The game continues until all of either side are\r\ncaptured. The players are divided into two groups. The Indians are\r\nconcealed in the bushes or some place unseen by the Whites and they make\r\nthe attack.\r\n\r\nSuch games as "Three Deep," "Bull in the Ring," "Tag Game," "Leap Frog,"\r\nwill be found to interest the boys during the after-supper period.\r\n\r\nThe following are campus games requiring apparatus:\r\n\r\nGerman Bowling\r\n\r\nPlant in the ground two posts, leaving at least 15 feet above ground.\r\nSpike a 10-foot piece across the top (see page 218). An ordinary ball used\r\nin bowling is used by plugging shut the holes and inserting a screw eye in\r\none of the plugged holes. Tie tightly to this screw eye a strong piece of\r\nrope. A good-sized screw eye is fastened in the cross piece of the frame,\r\nand to this tie the ball. Nine bowling pins are used. The score is the\r\nsame as bowling. The pins are knocked off by the return of the ball, as\r\nshown in the diagram.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: German Bowling]\r\n\r\nTether Ball\r\n\r\nThe upright pole should be standing ten feet out of the ground and firmly\r\nimbedded in the earth so as not to vibrate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tether Ball]\r\n\r\nThe pole should be 7-1/2 inches in circumference at the ground and\r\ntapering toward the upper end. Paint a black or white 2-inch band around\r\nthe pole 6 feet above the ground. Draw a circle about the pole on the\r\nground having a 3-foot radius. A 20-foot line must bisect the circle. Use\r\na tennis ball having a netted or tightly fitting linen cover. The ball is\r\nfastened to a string with a ring and suspended from the top of the pole by\r\na piece of heavy braided fish line. The cord should allow the ball to hang\r\n7-1/2 feet. Tennis racquets are used. The two players stand at point\r\nmarked with an X in the diagram. In the toss-up for courts the loser is\r\nthe server. The ball may be struck in any manner with the racquet, the\r\nendeavor being to wind the string upon the pole above the painted band.\r\n\r\nVolley Ball\r\n\r\nStretch a tennis net across the campus and mark a court fifty feet long,\r\nto be divided equally by the net. The play consists in keeping in motion\r\nthe ball over the net from one side to the other, until one fails to\r\nreturn it, which counts as an out. The ball used is similar to a football,\r\nonly smaller. The game consists of twenty-one points.\r\n\r\nMany of the camps have tennis courts and hold tournaments. This game is so\r\nuniversal and familiar that no description will be made.\r\n\r\nAQUATIC SPORTS AND WATER GAMES\r\n\r\nAquatic sports may be arranged so that active interest will be taken by\r\nall the boys, or they may be simply an exhibition of the swimming\r\nabilities of several boys. The former is decidedly preferable. Events\r\nshould be arranged for the small as well as the large boys.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Human Frog at Camp Kineo]\r\n\r\n ATHLETICS AND WATER SPORTS 221\r\n\r\nThe program of events should include a short dash, swimming under water,\r\ndiving for form, fancy swimming and special stunts, ribbon awards or\r\ninexpensive cups to be given the winners. The Life Saving Corps will have\r\nan opportunity to give an exhibition of their skill and alertness, as well\r\nas patrol the swimming beach. Good reliable fellows should be appointed to\r\nwatch each swimmer when in the water. Run no chances at any time that boys\r\nare in the water. The following water games have been suggested by A. B.\r\nWegener.\r\n\r\n1. Three-legged swimming.\r\n2. Tug of War.\r\n3. Bobbing for Corks.\r\n4. Plunging through hoops for height or distance.\r\n5. Diving for objects.\r\n6. Egg Race; holding the egg in a spoon either in the mouth or  hand.\r\n7. Tag games.\r\n8. Potato race; using corks instead of potatoes.\r\n9. Candle race; candles are lighted and must be kept lighted.\r\n10. Various land games may be adapted for water use, such as ball\r\npassing (using a water polo ball), relay race, etc.\r\n\r\nWater Basket Ball\r\n\r\nTwo peach baskets, or rope baskets, or two iron rings are hung upon\r\npoles five feet above the water and forty feet apart. The game is\r\nplayed similarly to basket ball, except that the players are allowed\r\nto advance with the ball. Tackling and ducking are fouls and penalized\r\nby allowing a free throw for goal from a point fifteen feet away.\r\nThere is no out of bounds, and a basket may be thrown from any place\r\nin the water. A field goal counts two points, and a goal from a foul\r\none point.\r\n\r\nWater Baseball\r\n\r\nThe outfit required is a tennis ball, a broom stick and four rafts--\r\none large and three small. The batsman and catcher stand on the big\r\nraft. On a small raft, ten yards away, stands  the pitcher and the\r\nother two rafts are placed at easy swimming distance for bases. In\r\nstriking, everything counts--bunt, swat or foul tip. The moment bat\r\nand ball come in contact the batsman starts for first base. There are\r\nfive men on a side. Lots of fun. Avoid remaining in fresh water too\r\nlong as it has a tendency to weaken vitality.\r\n\r\nOld Clothes Race\r\n\r\nThe contestants are dressed in a full suit of old clothes. At the word\r\n"go" they dive into the water and swim to a float placed at a certain\r\ndistance away, undress and return. This is a very funny race.\r\n\r\nTilting\r\n\r\nTwo boats manned by four boys each. One boy is the spearman and is\r\narmed with a light pole about eight or ten feet long, having a soft\r\npad of rags, or better yet, of water-proof canvas duck to keep it from\r\ngetting wet and soggy. If a flat-bottom boat is used, the spearman\r\nstands on one of the end seats. A quarter-deck or raised platform\r\nshould be built on an ordinary boat or canoe. The battle is fought in\r\nrounds and by points. If you put your opponent back into the boat with\r\none foot it counts you 5; two feet, 10. If he loses his spear you\r\ncount 5 (except when he is put overboard). If you put him down on one\r\nknee on the "fighting deck," you count 5; two knees, 10. If you put\r\nhim overboard it counts 25. One hundred points is a round. A battle is\r\nfor one or more rounds as agreed upon. It is forbidden to strike below\r\nthe belt. The umpire may dock for fouls.\r\n\r\nCanoe Tag\r\n\r\nAny number of canoes or boats may engage in this water game. A rubber\r\nfootball is used. The game is to tag the other canoe or boat by\r\nthrowing this into it. The rules are as in ordinary cross tag.\r\n\r\nWhale Hunt\r\n\r\nThe "whale" is made of a big log of wood with a rough-shaped head and\r\ntail to represent a whale. Two boats are used, each manned by the boys\r\nof one tent--the leader acting as captain, a boy as bowman or\r\nharpooner, the others as oarsmen. Each boat belongs to a different\r\nharbor, the two harbors being some distance apart. The umpire takes\r\nthe "whale" and lets it loose about half-way between the two harbors\r\nand on a signal the two boats race out to see who can get to the\r\n"whale" first. The harpooner who first arrives within range of the\r\n"whale" drives his harpoon into it and the boat promptly turns around\r\nand tows the "whale" to its harbor. The second boat pursues and when\r\nit overtakes the other, also harpoons the "whale," turns around and\r\nendeavors to tow the "whale" to its harbor. In this way the two boats\r\nhave a tug-of-war and eventually the better boat tows the "whale" and\r\npossibly the opposing boat into its harbor.\r\n\r\n\r\nShoot-the-Chute\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Diagram For "Chute"]\r\n\r\nA "Shoot-the-Chute" is great fun and one should be built in every\r\npermanent camp and "Swimming Hole." The one described is by A. D. Murray\r\nand has stood the test of several years in a number of camps.\r\n\r\nThe plan drawn is for a chute 40 feet long, 3 feet wide and 18 feet high.\r\nThese dimensions can be changed in length and height, but not in width.\r\nThe chute is built of 7/8-inch matched pine boards, to the same width as\r\nsheet zinc, usually 3 feet; the boards being firmly cleated together on\r\nthe under side by 2 x 6-inch cleats 5 feet apart, throughout the length of\r\nthe chute. Boards should be screwed to the cleats from the face of the\r\nchute with 1-1/2-inch screws, the heads being counter sunk. The several\r\nlengths of zinc are soldered into one piece, the joints being on the under\r\nside (as shingles on a roof) fastened to the boards with 8-oz. tacks; set\r\nin from the edge about 1 inch and about 6 inches apart. The side strips of\r\nmaple (soft wood will not do on account of the danger of splintering) 2\r\ninches wide and 3 inches high, rounded slightly on upper edge, are placed\r\ndirectly over the edge of the zinc and covering the tacks. Screw the\r\nstrips firmly to the chute with 2-inch screws from the under side. These\r\nought to be placed not more than 2 feet apart. Probably each will have two\r\nor more strips in making a piece of sufficient length. If so, care should\r\nbe taken to have the pieces joined on a bevel with a slant from outer edge\r\ntoward bottom of chute so as to leave no edge. The utmost care should be\r\nused to have a perfectly smooth surface on the inside of the chute. A pump\r\nor bucket is needed at the top of the chute to wet the surface before the\r\nswimmer starts his slide. The supports A, B, C, should be firmly braced\r\nwith 2 x 4-inch timber, D, and lower end of chute should extend over the\r\npier at least 1 foot and not nearer the surface of the water than 3 feet\r\nperpendicularly, allowing the swimmer to enter the water as in a dive. The\r\nchute can be fastened to the supporting braces through timbers E, F, into\r\nmaple side strips with a good heavy log screw. A platform 3 feet wide and\r\n4 feet long near the top of chute, and set just waist deep from the top of\r\nchute will make starting easy.\r\n\r\nArchery\r\n\r\nRichard the Lion-hearted, of England, said the five essential points of\r\narchery--standing, nocking[1], drawing, holding, and loosing--"honestly\r\nrepresented all the principles of life."\r\n\r\nArchery develops the muscles in all-round fashion, particularly those of\r\nthe shoulder, arm and wrist.\r\n\r\n[Transcriber\'s Footnote 1: A nock is the groove at either end of a bow for\r\nholding the bowstring or the notch in the end of an arrow that fits on the\r\nbowstring.]\r\n\r\nThe Target\r\n\r\nA target can be made of a burlap sack, or oil cloth, about five feet\r\nsquare. Stuff this with hay or straw. It may be flattened by a few\r\nquilting stitches put right through with a long packing needle. On this\r\nthe target is painted. In scoring, the centre is 9, the next circle 7, the\r\nnext 5, the next 3 and the last circle 1. The shortest match range for the\r\ntarget is forty yards.\r\n\r\nThe Bow\r\n\r\nThe bow may be made from any of the following woods--mulberry, sassafras,\r\nsouthern cedar, black locust, black walnut, apple, slippery elm or\r\nhickory. In making a bow, select wood with straight grain. The length of\r\nthe bow should be about the height of the boy using it, or if the boy is\r\nbetween ten and fifteen years of age, his bow should not be less than four\r\nfeet in length and not more than five feet. When buying a bow get one of\r\nlancewood backed with hickory.\r\n\r\nMaking A Bow\r\n\r\nThe making of the bow and arrow is described by A. Neeley Hall, as\r\nfollows: "Cut your piece of wood five feet long, and, after placing it in\r\na bench vise to hold it in position, shape it down with a drawknife or\r\nplane until it is one inch wide by one-half inch thick at the handle, and\r\nthree quarters inch wide by one-quarter inch thick at the ends. The bow\r\ncan be made round or flat on the face toward the archer. Cut a notch in\r\nthe bow two inches from each end, as shown in the illustration, from which\r\nto attach the bow-string. A cord with as little elasticity as possible\r\nshould be used for this. A good string can be purchased for twenty-five\r\ncents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Notch for Bowstrings; Length of Bow 5 feet. Wire nail with\r\nhead cut off (arrow head) Old Canvas Stuffed (target); Loop (in\r\nbowstring); slip knot.]\r\n\r\nWith a home-made bow-string, a loop should be made in one end and bound\r\nwith thread, as shown in illustration, p. 227. Slip the loop over the\r\nupper notch, bend the bow until the center of the string is about five\r\ninches away from the handle, and attach the loose end to the lower notch\r\nby means of a slip-knot similar to that shown in the drawing. The bow\r\nshould then be sandpapered until smooth, and thoroughly oiled with linseed\r\noil. Glue a piece of velvet about three inches wide around the center for\r\na handle."\r\n\r\nMaking Arrows\r\n\r\nArrows are divided into three parts: the head, sometimes called the pile,\r\nthe shaft and the feathers. The shaft is generally made of hickory, ash,\r\nelm or pine, and its length is dependent upon that of the bow. For a\r\nfive-foot bow, make the length two feet and the width and thickness about\r\none-half inch. For target practice a wire nail driven into the end of the\r\npile, as shown on page 227, with the head of the nail filed off and\r\npointed, makes an excellent head. Feathering is the next operation. Turkey\r\nand goose feathers are generally used. Strip off the broader side of the\r\nvane of three feathers and glue them to the shaft one inch and a quarter\r\nfrom the notch, spacing them equally from each other. One feather should\r\nbe placed at right angles to the notch. This is known as the cock feather\r\nand should always point away from the bow when the arrow is shot.\r\n\r\nArchery\r\n\r\nThe rules for the five essential points are these:\r\n\r\nStanding: In taking position to draw the bow, the heels must be seven to\r\neight inches apart, feet firm on the ground, yet easy and springy, not\r\nrigid.\r\n\r\nNocking: This is manipulating the bow string. Hold the string with two\r\nfingers and the arrow between the first and second fingers. Grip firmly,\r\nbut not so as to give awkwardness to any finger.\r\n\r\nDrawing: In drawing stand with the left shoulder toward the target,\r\nturning the head only from the neck and looking over the left shoulder.\r\nThen raise the bow with the left hand, keeping the upper end inclined one\r\nor two degrees from the body. With the right hand draw the arrow to\r\nchin-level and below the ear.\r\n\r\nHolding: Steady the aim a moment and keep the point of aim directly in\r\nview, looking along the whole length of the arrow.\r\n\r\nLoosing: In letting the arrow go, do not jerk, but loose smoothly, and be\r\ncertain your bow arm does not move when loosing. To get a clean, sharp\r\nloose is more than half way to hitting the target.\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nIndoor and Outdoor Game.(188)--A. M. Chesley.

He\r\nhas a passionate love of the open air and of the fields and woods; he is\r\nnever really happy indoors. Nature has planted this outdoor instinct in\r\nthe boy\'s heart for the good of the race." Day and night teach him their\r\nlessons. The boy will absorb much that is interesting and also much that\r\nwill be of real value in giving him a broader outlook upon life. Camping\r\ngives abundant opportunity for the study of nature.\r\n\r\nNature study is not a fad of modern times. Nearly three hundred and fifty\r\nyears before Christ, Alexander the Great placed at the disposal of his\r\ntutor, Aristotle, the services of one thousand men throughout Asia and\r\nGreece with instructions to collect and report details concerning the\r\nlife, conditions and habits of fishes, birds, beasts and insects. To this\r\nmagnificent equipment of assistants, Alexander added fifteen thousand\r\ndollars in gold for books and laboratory supplies.\r\n\r\nProf. L. H. Bailey says, "The modern idea of Nature Study is, to put the\r\nboy in a sympathetic attitude toward nature for the purpose of increasing\r\nthe joy of living. Nature study is not science. It is not knowledge. It is\r\nspirit. It is concerned with the boy\'s outlook on the world.... This\r\nNature spirit is growing, and there are many ways of knowing the fields\r\nand woods. A new literature has been born. It is the literature of the\r\nout-of-doors."\r\n\r\nCollectors\r\n\r\nBoys are natural born collectors. They are interrogation points, full of\r\ncuriosity, like the "man from Missouri," they want to know. The wise\r\nleader will say, "Let us find out some thing about this tree, or plant, or\r\nbird, or whatever it may be, and together we will be learners." The\r\ntextbook method will not work in a boys\' camp. "Go find me a flower" is\r\nthe true method, and let us see what it is. Nature study books and\r\nleaflets should be used merely as guides, not as texts.\r\n\r\nArousing Interest\r\n\r\nArouse interest by encouraging the boys to make collections of leaves,\r\nflowers, etc., found in the vicinity of the camp. Leaves and flowers may\r\nbe pressed in a home-made press and mounted upon heavy paper or cardboard.\r\nThe following suggestions are given by Dan Beard and quoted by permission\r\nof Charles Scribner\'s Sons from his Book, "The Field and Forest Handy\r\nBook."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Vreeland Press]\r\n\r\nHerbarium\r\n\r\n"The illustration shows how the press is made. In using the press, first\r\nplace the plants or leaves, enclosed in their wrappers and dryers of\r\nnewspapers, on the bottom board, put the top board over them, bring the\r\nhinged lever down and bind the whole together with a stout strap put\r\naround the end of the lever and the handle of the bottom board. As this\r\nstrap is drawn tight the lever bends, and so keeps a constant pressure on\r\nthe plants and leaves even when they shrink in drying. Dryers should be\r\nchanged at least every day. Mount specimens on separate herbarium sheets\r\nof standard size (1-1/2 X 16-1/2). Each specimen should be mounted with\r\nname (common and botanical), where found, date and any other facts of\r\ninterest. This label is usually pasted in the lower right hand corner of\r\nthe herbarium sheet."\r\n\r\nEquipment\r\n\r\nIf the camp has a permanent building, these specimens make a most\r\nattractive decoration as well as help to recall the happy days of "the\r\nhunt." The material equipment for nature study should consist of a good\r\nloose leaf note-book, something that will stand the out-door wear. Get\r\nquadrille ruled sheets. They will simplify sketching in the matter of\r\nproportion and scale. A pocket magnifying glass will serve for\r\nidentification of the specimens. An inexpensive combination tweezer and\r\nmagnifying glass is made by Asher Kleinman, 250 Eighth Avenue, New York\r\n(50 cents). Best of all is a high-power microscope, especially where the\r\ncamp has a permanent building with suitable room, having a good light and\r\ntable facilities. A camera will help in securing permanent records of\r\ntrees, ferns, flowers, birds, freaks of nature and scenes other than the\r\nusual camp groups. A few reliable books on nature study are needed to\r\ncomplete the outfit.\r\n\r\nHunting\r\n\r\nA "bird hunt" was a popular sport in one of my camps. We started off early\r\none morning, a group of boys, each "loaded" with a big lunchbox crammed\r\nwith good things, a note-book, a book on bird-life, and a "gun." The "gun"\r\nwe used was a powerful pair of field glasses. On the way we counted the\r\nnumber of bird-homes we saw. Just as we were thinking about stopping and\r\nhaving breakfast we heard a most ecstatic song. Creeping close to the\r\nplace where the sound came from, we discovered the songster to be a\r\nsong-sparrow. Focussing our "gun" upon the bird we made note of its\r\ncoloring and marking, making sure that if we heard or saw another we would\r\nrecognize it at once. While we were eating our breakfast, there was a dash\r\nof white, yellow, and grayish-brown, a whirring sound and, as the bird\r\nlighted upon the low bushes nearby, a clear, piercing whistle came from\r\nits throat. Our "gun" revealed to us a meadow lark. By this time the boys\r\nwere as much excited over the bird hunt as over a game of ball.\r\n\r\nWalks Afield\r\n\r\nA "flower walk," observing the wild flowers; a "fern walk," discerning the\r\ndelicate tracery of the fern in its cool haunts; a "tree walk", noting the\r\ndifferent trees--all are natural ways of interesting boys in nature study.\r\n\r\nNight Sounds\r\n\r\nG. B. Affleck in the April, 1910, number of Physical Training tells his\r\nexperience in studying nature with several groups of boys.\r\n\r\n"The night sounds surrounding a camp in northern Minnesota were a puzzle\r\nto boys and to the counsellor of the tent at the end of the row. This\r\nproblem continued unsolved for more than a week, despite all attempts both\r\nby day and night. Finally, one moist, warm night, Ned, after stealthily\r\napproaching the sound, satisfied himself of its location in a certain tree\r\nand in the morning was rewarded by the discovery of the \'toad\' camped on a\r\nbranch near the source whence the sound had issued. Replacing the frog so\r\nthat the coarse tubercles of its back corresponded to the bark, Ned\r\nenjoyed a merited reward at the expense of his tent mates who, though\r\noften \'hot,\' required some minutes to find the hidden treasure. Then came\r\nthe wonder of the stick toes and fingers, the feeding with flies, and the\r\nresult was--a new pet for the tent. In the next letters written to the\r\nfolks this find was the central theme. How much better this discovery and\r\nthe examination of the peculiar colors and structures, also the\r\nconclusions, based upon observed structure, as to the life and habits of\r\nthe tree frog than would have been a scientifically learned discussion of\r\nthe family Hylidae!\r\n\r\n"In a camp of fifty boys the writer remembers three who had special\r\ndelight in collecting pebbles, and they made several all-day trips to\r\ndistant brooks and beaches in the search for new specimens. Another group\r\nbecame so fascinated with the study of the food of fish that they begged\r\nthe \'privilege\' of cleaning the catch of each returning party. Proud was\r\nthat lad who incidentally located the heart of a pickerel, and because of\r\nhis school knowledge of physiology he could not be convinced that the fish\r\nbreathed without lungs till he had spent many hours in the vain endeavor\r\nto locate said organs. Then he knew that his former idea had been\r\ninadequate.\r\n\r\nFishology\r\n\r\n"Fortunately, nature is so interrelated in her various phases that an\r\nattempt at exploration in one direction soon opens other fields, until\r\nwith the growth of experience there comes a corresponding expansion of\r\ninterest. Thus the lads, searching for pebbles, were perforce attracted by\r\nthe plant and insect life of the brook, and the one delving into the\r\nmystery of breathing oxygen without lungs developed a new interest in the\r\nphysics of fluids, while those who located the tree frog enlarged their\r\nsphere by the knowledge that their pet rejected some of the \'bugs\' offered\r\nit.\r\n\r\n"The leader, commencing thus with the limited or special interest of each\r\ngroup, may evolve in his own mind the plan which most naturally will lead\r\nthe boys not only into a wider field of concrete facts, but also into the\r\nhabit of seeing relationships, of drawing conclusions and of raising\r\nquestions for further investigation.\r\n\r\n"A group of boys interested in a study of fish may well be organized for\r\nan all-day trip to the root of the rapids or the bay of springs; others\r\nwith geological preferences may spend a night on the top of the distant\r\nhill which offers outcroppings of interest; the embryo botanists cannot do\r\nbetter than to take a bog trot for the rare orchid, anomalous pitcher\r\nplant, or glistening sun dew; lovers of the deep shade may paddle to the\r\ninlet of the creek and there enjoy a side trip on the fragrant carpet of\r\nhemlock and pine needles; thus it will be found that by anticipating the\r\nprobable findings in which the particular group is interested the leader\r\ngives a point and purpose, adding not only to the enjoyment of the outing,\r\nbut imparting, in addition, some satisfactory knowledge of the vicinity."\r\n\r\nLongfellow said that a "strong evidence of goodly character was the\r\nthoughtfulness one displayed in caring for a tree." One of the best things\r\nat Camp Becket was a series of out-door talks on nature given by Silas H.\r\nBerry. Seated on a huge rock, he told the boys about the shaping and\r\nclothing of the earth, foundation stones, mountains and hills, lakes,\r\nponds, and rivers, the beginning of vegetable life, the variation and\r\nplace of the freak, the forest and its place in the world\'s progress, the\r\nalternation of the forest crop, man and his neighbors. Another afternoon\r\nthe boys went into the woods and while they squatted on Nature\'s mattress\r\nof fragrant pine needles (see illustration, page 230), he told about\r\nleaves and their work, cells and their place, roots and their arrangement,\r\ntendrils and their mechanism, flowers and their devices, seeds and their\r\ntravels. The third talk was upon the evolution of plant life, law and\r\nlogic of creation, perpetuation of life in the lower forms, edible and\r\npoisonous mushrooms, and the perpetuation of life in the higher forms. The\r\nboys had a different conception of life thereafter and they possessed that\r\nnature-love which always tends toward naturalness and simplicity of\r\nliving. They could sing with feeling.\r\n\r\nI love thy rocks and rills,\r\nThy woods and templed hills.\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nHow Nature Study Should be Taught--Edward F.

S. Department of Agriculture Weather Bureau publishes a\r\n"Classification of clouds," in colors which may be had for the asking. If\r\nyou are near one of the weather signal stations daily bulletins will be\r\nsent to camp upon request, also the weather map.\r\n\r\nA set of flag signals run up each day will create interest. The flags are\r\neasily made, or may be purchased.\r\n\r\nKeep a daily record of temperature. A boy in charge of the "Weather\r\nBureau" will find it to be full of interest, as well as to offer an\r\nopportunity to render the camp a real service. He will make a weather\r\nvane, post a daily bulletin board, keep a record of temperature, measure\r\nvelocity of wind and rainfall.\r\n\r\nIf you have lost your bearings and it is a cloudy day, put the point of\r\nyour knife blade on your thumb nail, and turn the blade around until the\r\nfull shadow of the blade is on the nail. This will tell you where the sun\r\nis, and decide in which direction the camp is.\r\n\r\nPoints of Compass\r\n\r\nFace the sun in the morning, spread out your arms straight from body.\r\nBefore you is the east; behind you is the west; to your right hand is the\r\nsouth; to the left hand is the north.\r\n\r\nA Home-made Weather Prophet\r\n\r\nFor a home-made barometer you need a clean, clear glass bottle. Take one\r\ndrachm[1] each of camphor gum, saltpetre and ammonia salts, and dissolve\r\nthem in thirteen drachms of pure alcohol. Shake till dissolved. Then pour\r\nin bottle and cork tightly. Hang the bottle of mixture against the wall\r\nfacing north, and it will prove a perfect weather prophet. When the liquid\r\nis clear it promises fair weather. When it is muddy or cloudy it is a sign\r\nof rain. When little white flakes settle in the bottom it means that the\r\nweather is growing colder, and the thicker the deposit the colder it\r\nbecomes. Fine, starry flakes foretell a storm, and large flakes are signs\r\nof snow. When the liquid seems full of little, threadlike forms that\r\ngradually rise to the top, it means wind and sudden storm.\r\n\r\n[Transcriber\'s Footnote 1: Dram, drachma; drachm;  U.S. Customary System\r\nequal to 1/16 of an ounce or 27.34 grains (1.77 grams).

It is when the blooms have seeded and are in the fluffy,\r\nfeathery condition that its weather prophet facilities come to the fore.\r\nIn fine weather the ball extends to the full, but when rain approaches, it\r\nshuts like an umbrella. If the weather is inclined to be showery it keeps\r\nshut all the time, only opening when the danger from the wet is past.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary clover and all its varieties, including the trefoil and the\r\nshamrock, are barometers. When rain is coming, the leaves shut together\r\nlike the shells of an oyster and do not open again until fine weather is\r\nassured. For a day or two before rain comes their stems swell to an\r\nappreciable extent and stiffen so that the leaves are borne more upright\r\nthan usual. This stem swelling when rain is expected is a feature of many\r\ntowering grasses.\r\n\r\nThe fingers of which the leaves of the horse chestnut are made up keep\r\nflat and fanlike so long as fine weather is likely to continue. With the\r\ncoming of rain, however, they droop, as if to offer less resistance to the\r\nweather. The scarlet pimpernel, nicknamed the "poor man\'s weather glass,"\r\nor wind cope, opens its flowers only to fine weather. As soon as rain is\r\nin the air it shuts up and remains closed until the shower or storm is\r\nover.\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY.\r\n\r\nTalk About the Weather--Charles Barnard.

There is\r\nnothing that is so fascinating to a boy in camp as listening to the patter\r\nof the rain drops upon the roof of his canvas house, especially at night,\r\nif he is snug and warm in his blankets and the tent is waterproof. A rainy\r\nday is the kind of a day when the chess and checker enthusiasts get\r\ntogether. Games are rescued from the bottom of the trunk or box. Ponchos\r\nand rubber boots are now in popular favor. Thunder and lightning but add\r\nto the boys\' enjoyment. What indescribable excitement there is in the\r\nshivers and shudders caused by an extra flash of lightning or a double\r\nfortissimo roll of thunder! There is also the delight, of playing in the\r\npuddles of water and wearing a bathing suit and enjoying a real shower\r\nbath.\r\n\r\nTo some boys it is repair day, rips are sewed up, buttons sewed on\r\nclothing, and for the initiated, the darning of socks. In camps with\r\npermanent buildings a big log fire roars in the fireplace, the boys sprawl\r\non the floor with their faces toward the fire, and while the rain plays a\r\ntattoo[1] upon the roof some one reads aloud an interesting story, such as\r\n"Treasure Island," "The Shadowless Man," "The Bishop\'s Shadow," or the\r\nchapters on "The Beneficent Rain" and "When the Dew Falls," from Jean M.\r\nThompson\'s book, "Water Wonders." It all depends upon one\'s viewpoint\r\nwhether rainy days are delightful or disagreeable.\r\n\r\n[Transcriber\'s Footnote 1: Signal on a drum or bugle to summon soldiers to\r\ntheir quarters at night. Continuous, even drumming or rapping.]\r\n\r\nSurplus Energy\r\n\r\nBoys are barometers. Restlessness is usually a sign of an approaching\r\nstorm. The wise leader senses the situation and begins preparing his\r\nplans. If the rain is from the east and comes drizzling down, better plan\r\na several day program, for after the excitement of the first few hours\'\r\nrain, the boys begin to loll around, lie on the cots, or hang around the\r\nkitchen and develop a disease  known as "Grouchitis." During the first\r\nstages of the disease the boys are inactive and accumulate an over-supply\r\nof energy, which must find an outlet. Here is where the leader plays an\r\nimportant part in handling the case; he provides an outlet for the\r\nexpenditure of this surplus energy by planning games demanding use of\r\nmuscle and the expenditure of energy and noise. The big mess tent, or\r\ndining hall, is cleared and romping games are organized.\r\n\r\nThe games suggested are adapted for rainy days and selected from a\r\ncatalogue of several hundred games.\r\n\r\nRAINY DAY GAMES\r\n\r\nFew sports are better calculated than a potato joust to amuse boys on\r\nrainy days. It has all the joys of a combat, and yet, try as he will,\r\nthere is no possibility for any boy to become rough.\r\n\r\nPotato Joust\r\n\r\nIn the potato joust each warrior is armed with a fork, on the end of which\r\nis a potato. The combatants take their position in the center of the\r\nplayroom, facing each other. They should be separated by not less than\r\nthree feet. Each must lift a leg from the floor (see illustration, next\r\npage). The fighters may use their own discretion as to which leg shall be\r\nlifted from the floor and may hold it up with either hand they prefer. A\r\nsmall cushion placed under the knee will add materially to the comfort of\r\nthe contestants.\r\n\r\nThe battle is decided by one of the warriors knocking the potato from his\r\nopponent\'s fork. Toppling over three times is also counted as defeat. If\r\none of the knights is obliged to let go of his foot in order to keep his\r\nbalance it is counted as a fall. Every time the battle is interrupted in\r\nthis way, either of the contestants is at liberty to change the foot he is\r\nresting upon. If one of the warriors falls against the other and upsets\r\nhim, it is counted against the one who is responsible for the tumble.\r\n\r\nYou are not likely to realize on your first introduction to a potato joust\r\nthe amount of skill and practice required to really become expert in\r\nhandling the fork. A slight turn of the wrist, a quick push and the\r\npractised knight will defeat the novice so deftly, so easily that you are\r\namazed.\r\n\r\nMove your fork as little as possible; long sweeping strokes are more\r\nlikely to throw off your own potato than to interfere with that of your\r\nopponent.\r\n\r\nThe most dangerous stroke is one from underneath; always maneuver to keep\r\nyour potato below that of your antagonist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Handkerchief Tussle; Potato Joust]\r\n\r\nHandkerchief Tussle\r\n\r\nStudy the illustration and see if you can discover a way for the boys to\r\nget apart. To make it really exciting, a number of couples should be set\r\ngoing at once, and a "second" on ice cream offered to the pair who get\r\napart first. To separate, the boys have only to push the center of one of\r\nthe handkerchiefs under the loop made by the other handkerchief when it\r\nwas tied about the wrist, and then carry the loop over the hand.\r\n\r\nRough-house is the expression used by the boy of today when he is\r\ndescribing a general scuffle, and he always smacks his lips over the word.\r\nBut rough-house has its disadvantages, as many sprains and bruises can\r\ntestify, and if the same amount of fun may be had from less trying\r\namusement, an amusement, say, which is quite as energetic and quite as\r\nexciting, the boy of today will certainly adopt it in preference to\r\nrough-house.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Terrier Fight]\r\n\r\nTerrier Figh\r\n\r\nA terrier fight is exciting, and it is funny--it is also energetic--and\r\nvictory depends quite as much upon the skill of the fighter as upon his\r\nstrength. Furthermore a terrier fight is not brutal. No boy will hurt\r\nhimself while engaged in this sport. Two boys are placed facing each other\r\nin the center of the room, hands clasped beneath the knees and a stick\r\njust under the elbows, as shown. Each contestant endeavors to push the\r\nother over; but as it requires considerable attention to keep the balance\r\nat all when in this position, the attack is no easy matter.\r\n\r\nTo give way suddenly is a maneuver almost sure to upset your adversary,\r\nbut unfortunately it is very apt to upset you at the same time and only\r\nafter considerable practice will you be able to overcome a man in this\r\nway. The pivot, a sudden swing to the right or left is safer, though not\r\nquite as effective. Always remember that the best terrier fighter\r\ninvariably makes his opponent throw himself. Give way at some unexpected\r\npoint, and unless he is a skilful man, he is sure to go over. Never try a\r\nhard push except in the last extremity when everything else has failed.\r\n\r\nA terrier fight consists of three one-minute rounds, with thirty seconds\'\r\nrest between each round. The one scoring the largest number of falls\r\nduring the time set is accounted the winner.\r\n\r\nCircle Ball\r\n\r\nA large circle of players throw a lawn tennis ball at one in the center.\r\nThe object of the player in the center is to remain "in" as long as\r\npossible without being hit. If he catches the ball in his hands it does\r\nnot count as a hit. Whoever hits him with the ball takes his place. The\r\nplayer who remains "in" longest wins.\r\n\r\nLeg Wrestle\r\n\r\nLie down on the back, side by side, by twos, the feet of each boy of a two\r\nbeing beside the other boy\'s head. At the word  "Go!" each brings the leg\r\nnearest his opponent at right angles with his body and then lowers it.\r\nThis may be done twice or three times, but the last time the leg is raised\r\nhe should catch his opponent\'s and endeavor to roll him over, which is a\r\ndefeat.\r\n\r\nHand Wrestling\r\n\r\nTake hold of each other\'s right or left hand and spread the feet so as to\r\nget a good base. At the word "Go!" each one endeavors to force his\r\nopponent to lose his balance, so as to move one of his feet. This\r\nconstitutes a throw.  The opponent\'s arm is forced quickly down or\r\nbackward and then drawn out to the side directly away from him, thus\r\nmaking him lose his balance. The one moving his foot or touching his hand\r\nor any part of his body to the floor, so as to get a better base, is\r\nthrown. The throw must be made with the hand. It is thus not rulable to\r\npush with the head, shoulder or elbow.\r\n\r\nRooster Fight\r\n\r\nThe combatants are arranged facing each other in two front, open ranks.\r\nThe first two "opposites" at either or both ends, or if the floor is large\r\nenough all the opposites, may combat at the same time. The boys should\r\nfold their arms forward, and hop toward each other on one leg. The butting\r\nis done with the shoulder and upper arm, and never with the elbow, and the\r\narm must remain folded throughout the combat. When the two adversaries\r\nmeet, each attempts to push the other over, or make him touch to the floor\r\nthe foot that is raised. When all have fought, the winners arrange\r\nthemselves in two opposing ranks and renew the combat. This is done, until\r\nbut one remains, and he is declared the victor.\r\n\r\nShoe and Sweater Race\r\n\r\nThe sweaters are placed at the opposite ends of the room. The boys start\r\nwith their shoes (or sneakers) on (laces out). A line is drawn in the\r\nmiddle of the room; here the contestants sit down and pull off their shoes\r\n(or sneakers), run to the sweaters and put them on. On the return trip\r\nthey put their shoes on and finish with both shoes and sweaters on.\r\n\r\nPeanut Relay Race\r\n\r\nBoys are lined up in two columns, as in ordinary relay races. For each\r\ncolumn two chairs are placed a convenient distance apart, facing one\r\nanother, with a knife and a bowl half full of peanuts on one, and an empty\r\nbowl on the other. At the proper word of command the first boy on each\r\nside takes the knife, picks up a peanut with it, and carries the peanut on\r\nthe knife to the farther bowl; upon his return the second boy does the\r\nsame and so on. The second boy cannot leave until the first has deposited\r\nhis peanut in the empty bowl, and has returned with the knife. Peanuts\r\ndropped must be picked up with the knife. Fingers must not be used either\r\nin putting the peanut on the knife or holding it there. The side, every\r\nmember of which first makes the round, wins.\r\n\r\nA FEW INTERESTING TESTS\r\n\r\nYou can\'t stand for five minutes without moving, if you are blindfolded.\r\n\r\nYou can\'t stand at the side of a room with both of your feet touching the\r\nwainscoting lengthwise.\r\n\r\nYou can\'t get out of a chair without bending your body forward or putting\r\nyour feet under it, that is, if you are sitting squarely on the chair and\r\nnot on the edge of it.\r\n\r\nYou can\'t crush an egg when placed lengthwise between your hands, that is,\r\nif the egg is sound and has the ordinary shell of a hen\'s egg.\r\n\r\nYou can\'t break a match if the match is laid across the nail of the middle\r\nfinger of either hand and pressed upon by the first and third fingers of\r\nthat hand, despite its seeming so easy at first sight.\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nSocial Activities for Men and Boys--A.

The boy\r\nwho has returned from a camp, having learned some definite thing, whether\r\nit be different from the school curriculum or supplementary to his school\r\nwork, has accomplished something and his outing has been of use to him.\r\nAll play and no work makes Jack a dull boy, as well as "all work and no\r\nplay." Recreative and constructive education forms a combination which\r\nappeals strongly to a boy. He would call it, "doing things," and in the\r\ndoing would have fun galore.\r\n\r\nIn addition to nature study, woodcraft, first-aid instruction and similar\r\ntypes of educational activities in vogue in boy\'s camps, there are many\r\nother forms of educational activities which boys can engage in during the\r\ncamping season.\r\n\r\nWhittlers\' Club\r\n\r\nA "Whittlers\' Club," organized to meet one hour several mornings a week,\r\nproved attractive to a group of boys in one camp. Under the leadership of\r\na man who understood "Sloyd" [1] work the boys were taught how to handle a\r\nknife, and it is surprising how few boys really know how to handle this\r\nuseful article found in every boy\'s pocket. They were also taught to know\r\nthe different kinds of wood, bark, grain, and method of cutting and sawing\r\nwood for building and furniture purposes, etc. A popular model was a paper\r\nknife made of wild cherry. The bark was permitted to remain on the handle,\r\nwhile the other end was whittled evenly and smoothly for cutting leaves of\r\nbooks or magazines. With the aid of a pyrography set the name of the camp\r\nand that of the owner of the knife was burned on the handle.\r\n\r\n[Transcriber\'s Footnote 1: Manual training developed in Sweden, using\r\nwoodworking tools.]\r\n\r\nPyrography\r\n\r\nCarved paddles, war clubs, hiking sticks, etc., were used to display the\r\nartistic ability of the boys who brought to camp pyrography sets. The camp\r\nname, date of hikes, miles travelled, and other interesting information\r\nwas burned on these souvenirs. Shields containing the athletic records and\r\nnames of honor boys were made and hung upon the walls of the permanent\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\nBoat Building\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Boat Building at Camp Durrell]\r\n\r\nIn one large camp an experienced boatman was engaged, and under his\r\ndirection three large dories were built by the boys. Plans were carefully\r\nworked out, lumber purchased, and details of boat construction explicitly\r\nexplained. It took three weeks to build the boats, but no boats of the\r\nfleet were used and appreciated as much by the boys as these which\r\nrepresented so much of their own labor and time. (See illustration.)\r\nWorking plans and "knocked down" material for building boats may be\r\npurchased from a number of firms. Building a boat during the winter by\r\nboys who are contemplating going camping, aids to the anticipation of the\r\ndelightful summer time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "Pyramus and Thisbe," Players Scene from Midsummer Night\'s\r\nDream; Camp Becket]\r\n\r\nPlays\r\n\r\n"The Player\'s Scene," from "Midsummer Night\'s Dream," has been given\r\nseveral times outdoors with great success in the camps conducted by the\r\nwriter. The boys were coached by a graduate of a School of Oratory,\r\ncostumes were made by the boys out of all sorts of material, make-up was\r\nbought from a theatrical supply house and the scenery supplied by nature.\r\nFootlights were lanterns set in front of reflectors made from old tomato\r\ncans. The path leading to the natural amphitheatre was lighted by Japanese\r\nlanterns and the guests were seated on the ground. In the words of Hamlet,\r\n"The Play\'s the Thing," and boys and visitors are always enthusiastic over\r\nthe presentation, while the players get a new conception of Shakespeare\'s\r\nplays and writings. "Hiawatha" was given with equal enthusiasm and\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nLantern Talks\r\n\r\nSince the invention of the inexpensive Reflectoscope, illustrated talks in\r\ncamp are now possible. Travel talks, using postal cards from different\r\nparts of the world, postals telling the "Story of the Flag," "State Seals\r\nand their Mottoes," etc., are now published in series, and will be found\r\nto be very interesting and instructive. A number of the large camps have\r\nstereopticons. Lantern slides with accompanying lecture may be rented at\r\nreasonable rates, such as "The True Sportsman," and "Personal and National\r\nThrift," sent out by the Moral Education League, Baltimore, Md., for the\r\nEast. Any first-class firm dealing in lantern slides can furnish a number\r\nof valuable lectures with slides. A sheet hung between two trees on a dark\r\nnight makes an excellent screen on which to show pictures.\r\n\r\nLibrary\r\n\r\nEvery camp should have a library or at least a small collection of good\r\nbooks. In most cases arrangements can be made with a near-by library or\r\nwith the State Library for the loan of books for a certain period of time.\r\nCamps having permanent buildings should "grow" a library. The excellent\r\nlibrary of 1,200 books in the camp of the writer was given by the boys\r\n(see illustration).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Book Identification]\r\n\r\nGummed book labels were sent to each boy with the suggestion that he paste\r\nthem in books which he could bring to camp to present to the library. Some\r\nboys would bring as many as ten books from the home library, all good,\r\nreadable books. The books are catalogued and a loan system established,\r\nunder the "Department of Education," and the following rules govern the\r\nlibrary and use of books:\r\n\r\n1. Library open for one-half hour after dinner daily except on Sunday,\r\nwhen it will be open for one-half hour after breakfast.\r\n\r\n2. Books can be kept out three days. If kept overtime a charge of two (2)\r\ncents per day is made. Books may be renewed if returned on day due,\r\notherwise the usual charge will be made.\r\n\r\n3. From 9 o\'clock A. M. to 12 o\'clock M., and from 2 o\'clock P. M., books\r\nmay be taken away to read in the room, but must not be taken outside the\r\nbuilding under any condition. Violation of this rule will deprive the\r\nviolator of the use of the books for three days.\r\n\r\n4. Please bring small change to pay fines.\r\n\r\nTutoring\r\n\r\nThe following announcement is sent by the writer to parents and boys\r\nconcerning tutoring in camp:\r\n\r\nSPECIAL ANNOUNCEMENT OF TUTORING.\r\n\r\nProvides Opportunity For\r\n\r\n(1) Those who, on account of illness or other unavoidable circumstances,\r\nhave fallen behind their grade and wish to catch up by summer study.\r\n\r\n(2) Those who, on account of poor work or failure in examination, cannot\r\nbe promoted unless they do special work during the vacation time.\r\n\r\n(3) Those who have not fully mastered a given subject and desire to review\r\nand strengthen themselves in the subject.\r\n\r\n(4) Those who wish to use their summer in order to earn an extra\r\npromotion.\r\n\r\nInstruction\r\n\r\nMany of our camp leaders are college men and have the requisite\r\nscholarship to conduct the academic feature of the camp. The instruction\r\nis very largely individual and is given in the morning and does not\r\ninterfere with the recreation life. The combination of study and\r\nrecreation makes tutoring attractive and stimulating.\r\n\r\nSubjects\r\n\r\nAny subject in the grammar or high school curriculum.\r\n\r\nTime\r\n\r\nTwo or three periods per week will be given to each subject.\r\n\r\nCost\r\n\r\nOne dollar per week will be charged for each subject.\r\n\r\nAn accurate record is kept of every boy being tutored, on a card (see\r\nillustration), and a duplicate sent to his parent at the close of the\r\nseason.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Report Cards]\r\n\r\nPhotography\r\n\r\nTo stimulate interest in photography, a contest is held during the latter\r\npart of the camping season for a cup, to be awarded to the boy securing\r\nthe best collection of photographs of camp life. The award is determined\r\nupon: first, selection of subjects, and, second, execution of detail.\r\nRibbon awards are given for the best individual photograph in these three\r\nclasses: (a) portraits, (b) groups, (c) landscapes. The regulations\r\ngoverning the contest are:\r\n\r\n1. Exposure, developing, and printing must be the work of the exhibitor.\r\n\r\n2. Mounted or unmounted photographs may be submitted.\r\n\r\n3. All photographs must be handed in before 12 o\'clock noon (date\r\ninserted).\r\n\r\nFor camps having good dark rooms, the following rules may be suggestive:\r\n\r\n1. Key to the dark room must be returned to the office immediately after\r\nusing room and locking same.\r\n\r\n2. If films are drying, inform the office of same, so that the next user\r\nmay be notified and care taken not to disturb the films.\r\n\r\n3. Room must be kept clean:\r\n(a) Do not wipe shelves with the hand towels.\r\n(b) Hang hand towels on nail provided.\r\n(c) Leave buckets and trays in clean condition.\r\n(d) Put paper, empty tubes, etc., in box provided for same and not\r\nupon the floor.\r\n\r\n4. Use only the buckets provided, and not those used for kitchen or camp\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\n5. Use only your own property and that provided by the camp, and never\r\ntouch the property or films or plates of others.\r\n\r\nCamp Paper\r\n\r\nEvery large camp has its official organ or camp paper. An editorial board\r\nis appointed, and the doings of the camp recorded in a permanent manner\r\nthrough the weekly issue or reading of the paper. Various names are given\r\nthe paper, such as "The Camp Log," "Dudley Doings,"  "Seen and Heard,"\r\n"Wawayanda Whirlwind," "The Maskwa," "The Wyanoka Log," "Kinoe Kamper."\r\nSome of these papers are printed and others are mimeographed and sold to\r\nthe campers at five cents a copy. Most of them, however, are written in a\r\nbook and read at the camp fire.\r\n\r\nAgriculture\r\n\r\nWhere a camp is located so as to be near a farm, opportunity should be\r\ngiven city boys to study soil, rotation of crops, gardening, etc. In\r\ncooperation with the Department of Agriculture and under the leadership of\r\na student of an Agricultural College, an experiment in raising vegetables\r\nmay be tried in long-term camps. A plot of ground may be plowed and\r\nharrowed, and sub-divided into as many plots as there are tents, each tent\r\nto be given a plot and each boy in the tent his "own row to hoe," the boy\r\nto make his own choice of seed, keep a diary of temperature, sunshine,\r\nrainfall, when the first blade appeared; make an elementary analysis of\r\nsoil, use of fertilizer and other interesting data. Prepare for an exhibit\r\nof vegetables. Whatever the boys raise may be cooked and eaten at their\r\ntable. Free agricultural bulletins will be sent upon application to the\r\nUnited States Department of Agriculture, Washington, D. C. Farmers\'\r\nBulletin 385 tells about Boys\' Agricultural Clubs.\r\n\r\nForestry\r\n\r\nThe subject of forestry is akin to camping. Much valuable instruction may\r\nbe given boys regarding the forests of the locality in which the camp is\r\nlocated, kind of land, character and use of woods, how\r\nutilized--conservatively or destructively--for saw timber, or other\r\npurposes, protection of forests, forest fires, etc. Send to United States\r\nDepartment of Agriculture, Washington, D. C., for Forest Service Circular\r\n130, "Forestry in the Public Schools;" Farmers\' Bulletin 173, "A Primer of\r\nForestry," Part I; Farmers\' Bulletin 358, "A Primer of Forestry," Part II.\r\n\r\nScoutcraft\r\n\r\nThe Handbook of the Boy Scouts of America is full of information regarding\r\nknot tying, signalling, tracking, use of compass, direction and time\r\ncalculator, etc., which every boy should know. Scoutcraft would furnish\r\nrecreational education for scores of boys.\r\n\r\nRecord Books\r\n\r\nBoys like to carry home some permanent record of personal achievements\r\nwhile at camp, autographs of fellow campers, etc. A rather unique record\r\nis used by the boys at Camp Wawayanda. The illustration shows the card\r\nwhich was used. "A Vacation Diary," in the form of vest pocket memorandum\r\nbook, bound in linen, is published by Charles R. Scott, State Y. M. C. A.\r\nCommittee, Newark, N. J. Price, 10 cents.\r\n\r\nKites\r\n\r\nScientific kite flying is one of the best things a boy can indulge in.\r\nHiye-Sho-To, a Japanese, gives this interesting information about kites.\r\n"To all Japanese the kite is symbolic of worthy, soaring ambitions, such\r\nas the work upward to success in school, or in trade, and so on. When a\r\nchild is born, little kites are sent up by modest households to announce\r\nthe arrival. Kites are also flown to celebrate birthdays. To lose a kite\r\nis considered an omen of ill-luck."\r\n\r\n"For the control of a box kite, I prefer the lightest steel wire to a\r\ncord. This wire is about the thickness of an ordinary pin, with a tensile\r\nstrength at the point of breaking of quite three hundred pounds. In\r\nhandling a kite with such a wire-ground connection, a boy should always\r\nhave rough gloves on his hands, that the wire may not cut them.\r\n\r\n"Having a kite of this kind, or even two and three, so that on a single\r\nwire he can keep sending them higher and higher into the atmosphere, a boy\r\ncan begin what we were wont to call in Yeddo our \'kite education.\' First,\r\nhe can make himself his own weather prophet. Self-registering thermometers\r\nare no longer very expensive. He can wire one of these to his kite, and,\r\nby knowing the length of wire he has in hand and the amount he pays out\r\nwhile the kite is up, ascertain just what the air temperature is 200 feet,\r\n500 feet, 1,000 feet, 3,000 feet above him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Box Kites]\r\n\r\n"There are wind gauges of cheap construction, moisture gauges which will\r\nnote the coming of rain, small cameras that will automatically take\r\npictures while the kite is in the air, that may be attached to these\r\nkites, and from the work of which valuable information may be obtained."\r\n\r\nThe following instruction for making a box kite was given in "The American\r\nBoy," April, 1909.\r\n\r\n"Any boy can make a box kite. The material used may be any tough, light\r\nwood, such as spruce, cypress, bass-wood, or cedar. Cut four pieces 42\r\ninches in length, and sixteen pieces 18 inches in length. The cuts show\r\nclearly how they are to be put together. Use glue and small brads at every\r\npoint. The bridle cord is fastened 6 inches from each end of the box. This\r\nis best done before the cloth is put on the kite. Light cheese cloth may\r\nbe used, and should be secured with glue and small brads at the last lap.\r\nWhen the cloth is in place paint it with thin varnish or glue to fill up\r\nthe meshes and stretch it.\r\n\r\n"The reason why box kites made by boys have a tendency to lie down flat on\r\nthe ground is that they are not proportioned correctly. The proportions\r\ngiven here are correct. The painting, decorating, and tinting are matters\r\nof personal taste and skill."\r\n\r\nThe principle of kite flying is simple. Air is a fluid like water, but on\r\naccount of the many changes of temperature, to which it is subjected, it\r\nconstantly changes its density and is found to consist of layers or\r\nstrata. These layers are not all flat and parallel, but take every variety\r\nof shape as the clouds do. In flying a kite you simply pull it up one of\r\nthose layers just as you would pull a sled or wagon up a hill. Always run\r\nfacing the wind.\r\n\r\nAeroplanes\r\n\r\nAeroplane season is now a calendar event in the boy\'s life. Many boys are\r\nengaged in building these fascinating little ships of the air. "The Boy\'s\r\nBook of Model Aeroplanes," by Francis A. Collins, Century Co. ($1.20 net),\r\ngives complete directions how to build these marvellous new toys. Form a\r\nclub and conduct an "Aviation" meet during the season. Spon and\r\nChamberlain, 123 North Liberty Street, New York City, sell a complete\r\nfull-sized set of drawings for building three model aeroplanes. Price, 50\r\ncents.\r\n\r\nParachutes\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Parachute Idea]\r\n\r\nThe parachute, in its various forms, has always been a favorite with boys.\r\nThe idea is to make an umbrella-shaped contraption out of tissue paper and\r\na stick, so that when it descends from any considerable height it will\r\nopen out and float slowly to the ground. This part is easy enough. The\r\ntrouble has always been to get it up in the air high enough to repay one\r\nfor his efforts in making it. The idea that a common sling shot had\r\npropelling power sufficient for this purpose led to experiments which\r\nproved that the idea was a happy one. The combination of sling shot and\r\nparachute makes a very fascinating outdoor amusement device. Every time\r\nyou shoot it into the air you try to make it go higher than last time.\r\n\r\nTo make the parachute, get a tough stick about two feet long and whittle\r\nit to a shape similar to Fig. 2. The bottom must be heavy enough to fall\r\nfirst so that the parachute will fall in the right direction to be opened\r\nout. You can weight the end by tying a piece of lead or a spool on it. Cut\r\nyour tissue paper to a shape shown in Fig. 2 and place a thread through\r\nevery scallop. If the paper tears right through, a good plan is to\r\nreinforce the edges of the circle by pasting a strip of tough paper or\r\nmuslin all around. A parachute made of silk or any fine mesh cloth will be\r\nmuch more lasting, but not quite so buoyant.\r\n\r\nThe sling shot is made with a rubber band, some string, and a forked\r\nstick. The greater its propelling power, the more successful will the toy\r\nbe.\r\n\r\nBox Furniture\r\n\r\nInstead of using for firewood the boxes in which groceries, etc., are\r\nshipped to camp, have the boys make useful camp furniture from them. Get\r\nthe book, "Box Furniture," by Louise Brigham: The Century Co.; price,\r\n$1.50. It tells what to do with boxes, and how to make all sorts of\r\nconvenient furniture.\r\n\r\nCamp Clock\r\n\r\nMark the ground around the camp flag pole with white stones or stones\r\nwhitewashed, like a sun dial. The sun\'s rays will cast the shadow of the\r\npole so that the time of day may be accurately ascertained. (See\r\nillustration.) In the handbook of the Boy Scouts of America is the\r\nfollowing description for making a Sun dial or Hunter\'s Clock: "To make a\r\nsun dial prepare a smooth board about 15 inches across, with a circle\r\ndivided into 24 equal parts, and a temporarily hinged pointer, whose upper\r\nedge is in the middle of the dial. Place on some dead level solid post or\r\nstump in the open. At night fix the dial so that the 12-o\'clock line\r\npoints exactly to North, as determined by the North or Pole Star. Then,\r\nusing two temporary sighting sticks of exactly the same height (so as to\r\npermit sighting clear above the edge of the board), set the pointer\r\nexactly pointing to the Pole Star, that is, the same angle as the latitude\r\nof the place, and fix it there immovably. Then remove the two sighting\r\nsticks."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Camp Clock]\r\n\r\n\r\nSUN DIAL OR HUNTER\'S CLOCK\r\nSome Quotations to Burn or Paint on the Sun Dial.\r\n\r\n"My face marks the sunny hours,\r\nWhat can you say of yours."\r\n\r\n"Grow old along with me,\r\nThe best is yet to be."\r\n\r\nTranslation of motto on Cathedral Sun dial, St. Augustine.\r\n"The hours pass and we are held accountable."\r\n\r\nThe illustration shows how to locate the North or Pole Star.\r\n\r\nF. O. Van Ness gives the following directions for making a pair of\r\nmoccasins:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sioux Moccasin]\r\n\r\nFig. 1. Place foot on leather or canvas and draw outline of foot. Turn\r\nsame and make pattern for other foot.\r\n\r\nFig. 2. Distance GB equals length of foot plus one inch; distance AC\r\nequals width across instep plus one-half inch; cut DF halfway between B\r\nand G; cut EG halfway between A and C. Cut piece reverse of this for other\r\nmoccasin. Place B of Fig. 2 to B of Fig. 1, and sew overhand with wax cord\r\nthe edges from B to A and B to C, bringing A and C of Fig. 2 together at A\r\nof Fig. 1. Sew AG to CG.\r\n\r\nFig. 3 is the tongue and DF of Fig. 3 is sewed to DF of Fig. 2. Cut pairs\r\nof half-inch slits a, b, c, d in Fig. 2, and run lace through.\r\n\r\nHammock-Making\r\n\r\nFor the afternoon "siesta" make a "rough-and-ready" hammock, by taking\r\napart a flour barrel or sugar barrel, and in the end of each stave bore a\r\nthree-quarter inch hole with a heated poker, or bit and auger. Then lace\r\nthin rope (clothes line is good) through the holes. This can be\r\naccomplished easily by noting method of lacing in figure "A." The\r\nstay-blocks "B" should be 12 inches long. Figure "C" shows hammock ready\r\nfor use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rough and Ready Hammock]\r\n\r\nA Toboggan\r\n\r\nGet a cheese box. Knock in the end very carefully, so as not to split it,\r\npull out all the nails and lay it flat, and you have a piece of very thin\r\nboard about 4-1/2 feet long and 11 inches wide. Next take a piece of inch\r\nplank of same width as the cheese box, and three feet in length, and to\r\nthis fasten the unrolled cheese box by using small lath nails, letting one\r\nend curl up over the plank. To the edge of this protruding piece of cheese\r\nbox tack a narrow strip of wood. Tie a heavy cord to its ends, run the\r\ncord through the two hooks screwed into the planks and draw down the end\r\nuntil it is curved just right. The illustration shows how it is made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Home Made Toboggan.]\r\n\r\nHandy Funnel\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Handy Funnel]\r\n\r\nA funnel may be made by taking an ordinary envelope and cutting off the\r\npart shown in dotted lines as in the illustration. Then clip a little off\r\nthe point, open out, and you have an excellent funnel.\r\n\r\nOnion Ink\r\n\r\nDip a pen in an onion and press until the juice comes; then, with plenty\r\nof juice on the pen, write your message. To read it warm it over the fire,\r\nwhen the writing will stand out clearly.\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nLIST OF BOOKS ON HANDCRAFT AND CONSTRUCTION:\r\n\r\nField and Forest Handy Book--D. C. Beard.

To give every\r\nboy an opportunity to do his best to measure up to the camp standard, is\r\nthe thing desired in the awarding of emblems. Non-competitive tests are\r\nbeing recognized as the best lever of uplift and the most effective spur\r\nin arousing the latent ability of boys. The desire to down the other\r\nfellow is the reason for much of the prevailing demoralization of\r\nathletics and competitive games. Prizes should not be confused with\r\n"honors." An honor emblem should be representative of the best gift the\r\ncamp can bestow and the recipient should be made to feel its worth. The\r\nemblem cannot be bought, it must be won.\r\n\r\nDudley Plan\r\n\r\nCamp Dudley has the distinction of introducing the honor system in boys\'\r\ncamps. Boys pass tests which include rowing, swimming, athletics, mountain\r\nclimbing, nature study, carpenter work, manual labor, participation in\r\nentertainments, "unknown" point (unknown to the camp, given secretly to\r\nthe boy) and securing the approval of the leaders, in order to win the "C\r\nD." After winning this emblem, the boys try to win the camp pennant, the\r\ntests for which are graded higher.\r\n\r\nCamp Eagle\r\n\r\n"The Order of the Adirondack Camp Eagle" is established at Camp Adirondack\r\nfor boys who qualify in the following tests: "Obedience is required to the\r\nfew camp rules; promptness is required at the regular bugle\r\ncalls--reveille, assembly for exercise, mess call, and tattoo and\r\ntaps--and erect posture is required at meals. In addition to this there is\r\na \'general personal\' standard  (embracing neatness at meals and courtesy,\r\netc.). Boys coming up to the standard are initiated into the order and\r\nreceive the emblem--the bronze eagle button. Boys who reach an especially\r\nhigh standard receive the silver eagle. Boys reaching this higher degree\r\nmay compete for the golden eagle, the highest camp honor. To obtain this\r\nit is necessary for a boy to swim a hundred yards, do the high dive (about\r\n12 feet), be able to row well and paddle a canoe skillfully, recognize and\r\nname twenty-five trees, and pass a practical examination in other nature\r\nwork and in practical camping and woodcraft, and answer questions in\r\nphysical training and care of the body along lines covered in camp-fire\r\ntalks."\r\n\r\n HONOR EMBLEMS AND AWARDS 281\r\n\r\n"The Order of the Phantom Square" was organized at the Wisconsin State\r\nBoys\' Camp for boys who succeed in qualifying in the tests named below:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Order of the Phantom Square.]\r\n[Illustration: Phantom Square; Honor Emblem]\r\n\r\nBronze, Silver and Gold Pins are awarded as follows:\r\nBronze--60 points, 15 in each division.\r\nSilver--80 points, 20 in each division.\r\nGold .--100 points, 25 in each division.\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL. 30 POINTS POSSIBLE\r\n\r\nEvent                     A (16-17)   B (14-15)   C (12-13)        Points\r\n*1.

Tests marked thus (+) are judged by all tent leaders for boys in\r\ntheir tents.\r\n\r\nAfter a candidate has won the requisite number of points for the first\r\ndegree, a unanimous vote of all leaders in council assembled, is\r\nnecessary, after which, a solemn ceremony of initiation is conducted.\r\n\r\nThe Honor Emblem is given to all who win a total of at least thirty points\r\ncovering all the tests.\r\n\r\nFlag of Honor\r\n\r\nCamp Couchiching spirit is developed through the "Flag of Honor," which is\r\nawarded each day to the tent scoring the highest number of points, as\r\nfollows: Every boy up and in line at 3 minutes after 7, scores 5 points\r\nfor his tent; the morning dip, 5 points; tent inspection, 100 points for\r\nperfect; winning in athletic and aquatic meet, 25 points; second, 20;\r\nthird, 15; fourth, 10; and fifth, 5. On a winning baseball team, 5 points\r\nand amateur stunt, 10 points.\r\n\r\nGreen Rag Society\r\n\r\nCamp Eberhart has the following elaborate plan: The camp emblem itself\r\nrepresents the first degree and the camper must be in camp for one full\r\nweek before he can wear it. The emblem is a brown triangle with a large E\r\nplaced upon it with a green background. A green bar is added for each year\r\nspent in camp.  The second, third and fourth degrees are indicated by a\r\nsmall green star, to be placed at the points of the triangle, beginning at\r\nthe lowest point, then the upper left, then the upper right. The second\r\ndegree will be awarded by the first star, the third degree by the second\r\nstar, also entitling the winner to membership in the "Brown Rag" Society.\r\nThe fourth degree will be awarded by the third star and the winner be\r\nentitled to membership in the "Green Rag" Society.\r\n\r\nMembership in the "Green Rag" Society is the highest honor the camp can\r\nbestow. The following are the requirements for the higher degrees.\r\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS FOR THE SECOND DEGREE.\r\n1. To catch a one-pound fish from Corey Lake.\r\n2. To catch a one-pound fish from any other lake while at camp.\r\n3. To row a boat (passing the rowing test).\r\n4. To be able to swim 50 yards.\r\n5. To be able to walk one mile in 11 minutes.\r\n6.

Leaders will be appointed to take charge of the different\r\ntests, to whom the boys will report when they qualify in the tests and\r\nreceive their points. The final decision in the giving of the honor emblem\r\nis made at a full meeting of the Camp Council.\r\n\r\nThe honor emblem consists of a white "swastika" [1] cross with garnet felt\r\nD for Durrell and B for Becket. Boys who fail to secure the emblem in one\r\nseason are credited with points which hold good the next season. The Honor\r\nPennant is awarded only to those who render special service to the camp.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Honor Camp Leader]\r\n\r\nThe camp emblem is a garnet solid triangle with the initial of the camp in\r\nwhite felt upon it. A white bar placed above the triangle represents the\r\nattendance, one bar is given for each year. The Senior leader\'s emblem is\r\na white felt disc with a garnet felt triangle, and the Junior leader\'s\r\nemblem, a garnet felt disc with a white felt triangle.\r\n\r\n[Transcriber\'s Footnote 1: The swastika is an ancient religious symbol, a\r\nGreek cross with the ends of the arms bent at right angles. It was adopted\r\nby the Nazi party under Adolf Hitler in 1935. This book was written 22\r\nyears earlier.]\r\n\r\nCampers will find enough suggestions in these outlines to develop systems\r\nof their own which will help in the all-round development of the boy.\r\n\r\nCamp Kineo Cup\r\n\r\nSome camps prefer the awarding of what may be called "proficiency cups."\r\nAt Camp Kineo a silver cup is awarded to the boy in each division who is\r\nthe best all-round fellow, considering manly qualities, loyalty to camp,\r\ndeportment, behavior under all conditions, skill in athletics, aquatics,\r\ntennis, baseball, and all other sports, self-control, temperament,\r\npopularity with boys and good standing with councilors. The judges are the\r\nDirector and Camp Council, whose decision counts for 60 per cent toward\r\nthe final award, the boys not competing deciding the other 40 per cent\r\ntoward the final award.\r\n\r\nHall of Fame\r\n\r\nAt Camp Wildmere there is a "Hall of Fame." Votes are taken for the most\r\nrespected leader and the most respected boy, the most popular leader and\r\nboy; the boy who has done the most for the camp and the boys; the most\r\ncourteous boy, neatest boy, best-built boy, brightest boy, favorite in\r\ngames; neatest in tent; best all-round camper; boy who talks least about\r\nhimself; the one with the best table manners; the quietest boy, most\r\ngenerous boy, handsomest boy, best-natured boy and the camp humorist.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Striking the Colors]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII--PACKING UP\r\n\r\nTHE LAST NIGHT\r\nPACKING UP\r\nINSTRUCTIONS TO LEADERS\r\nTHE LAST WORD\r\n\r\nFarewell, wild hearth where many logs have burned;\r\n Among your stones the fireweed may grow.\r\nThe brant[1] are flown, the maple-leaves have turned,\r\n The goldenrod is brown--and we must go.\r\n-Arthur Guiterman.\r\n\r\n[Transcriber\'s Footnote 1: brant: Dark wild goose of the Arctic having\r\na black neck and head.]\r\n\r\nThe Last Night\r\n\r\nThe last night in a boys\' camp should be the best of all the nights. It is\r\nusually a night of reminiscence. Around the camp fire or log fire in the\r\n"Lodge," all the campers gather and rehearse the good times of the days\r\nthat have passed all too quickly--those days of close intimacy of tent\r\nlife, where boys of different tastes, temperaments and dispositions were\r\nthrown together, where life\'s great lessons of give and take were learned\r\nand where character was put to the test! Friendships have been formed\r\nwhich will last through life. The same group of fellows will never come\r\ntogether again. The director, perhaps as no other person, realizes the\r\nimportance of making this night one of permanent impression, and his\r\n"good-by" talk to the fellows will reiterate the "why" of camping and\r\nemphasize the taking home of the spirit of good which has prevailed and\r\nthe making it count for the best things in home, school, factory and\r\nchurch life of those boys who enjoyed the benefits of the camp.\r\n\r\nAll the favorite songs of the camp are sung, the leaders make "speeches,"\r\nand the boys have an opportunity of telling what camp life has done for\r\nthem. As the fire dies down the bugler off in the distance plays "God Be\r\nWith You Till We Meet Again"; silence--and then "taps."\r\n\r\nPacking Up\r\n\r\nThere is just as much need of system and care in breaking camp and packing\r\nup, as in opening camp. Chas. R. Scott at Camp Wawayanda issues to each\r\nleader the following letter of instructions, which may be of help to those\r\nin charge of large camps.\r\n\r\nLETTER OF INSTRUCTION TO LEADERS\r\n\r\nDEAR FRIEND--Will you kindly help me break camp by carrying out the\r\nfollowing instructions:\r\n\r\n1. Have all your boys return all books to the librarian not later than\r\nThursday morning, and tools to the shop by the same time.\r\n\r\n2. Encourage your helpers to loosen the side walls of tent early Friday\r\nmorning, if clear, and fasten guy ropes so that canvas will dry if damp.\r\n\r\n3. Take out all the pegs which fasten the side walls, clean off dirt and\r\nplace in boxes at boat house.\r\n\r\n4. Take down the board in your tent, take out all nails; straighten them\r\nand place in proper boxes in shop. Then take board to the boat house.\r\nLeave the rope over the ridge pole untied.\r\n\r\n5. Take out all nails and screws in the upright poles of your tent and\r\nbunks, and place in boxes in shop.\r\n\r\n6. Empty the oil and clean lantern and return to the boat house. Take\r\nbunks to the lodge and let us know the condition of each.\r\n\r\n7. See that all paper and old things in and around the tent are picked up\r\nand placed on the fire for that purpose.\r\n\r\n8. After Bible study we will take down all tents. We should like you to\r\ndelegate one fellow to each upright pole, one to each of the four corner\r\nguy ropes, and then follow instructions as the bugle blows.\r\n\r\n9. Take all rope on the trees to headquarters.\r\n\r\n10. Kindly answer the following questions regarding your tent:\r\n    a. Are all the poles properly marked with tent number?\r\n    b. Does tent leak? If so, where?\r\n    c. Is the ridge pole in good condition?\r\n    d. Does front and rear of tent close securely?\r\n    e.  Does it need new fasteners for tying up?\r\n\r\nAnything else you have noticed during the time you have been in the tent;\r\nplease make a memorandum of same on back of this sheet.\r\n\r\n11. Return camp keys, if you have them, to headquarters before leaving.\r\n\r\nWe would be pleased to have you write on the back of this sheet any\r\nsuggestions you have for the improvement of camp for next season. Thanking\r\nyou personally for your help and trusting to have your cooperation and\r\nthat of your boys until the close of camp, I remain, Sincerely yours,\r\n\r\nLast Words\r\n\r\nThe day before camp breaks, each boy should pack his trunk or box neatly,\r\nleaving at the top the things needed to make the homeward journey, with\r\nroom for his blankets. If the packing is left until the last day,\r\nconfusion will result and temper be sorely tried.\r\n\r\nPermanent buildings should be securely safeguarded against the severity of\r\nthe winter and the breaking in of thieves. All kitchen utensils should be\r\nthoroughly cleaned and dried. If they are put away moist rust will eat\r\nholes. Give the stove a good coat of old grease and cover with burlap or\r\nold canvas. Hang the tents in bags where the squirrels and rats cannot get\r\nat them. When camp is closed it should be in such condition that it would\r\nrequire but a few hours to reopen and make ready for the next outing.\r\n\r\n\r\nIndex.\r\n\r\nAdvance Party.\r\nAeroplanes.\r\nAgriculture.\r\nAquatic Sports.\r\nArchery.\r\nAthletic Events and Awards.\r\nAthletic Grouping.\r\n\r\nBacon.\r\nBandages.\r\nBank.\r\nBarometer, Homemade.\r\nBarometers, Plant.\r\nBaseball League.\r\nBaseball, Water.\r\nBasket Ball, Water.\r\nBeds.\r\nBible Study.\r\nBites and Stings.\r\nBlanket Roll.\r\nBleeding.\r\nBoats and Boat Building.\r\nBooks, Rainy Day.\r\nBow and Arrows.\r\nBox Furniture.\r\nBox Trunk.\r\nBroken Bone.\r\nBruises and Burns.\r\nBuildings.\r\n\r\nCamp, Plan of.\r\nCleaning.\r\nLocation of.\r\nCamp Fire.\r\nCamping, Arguments for.\r\nCanoe Tag.\r\nChapel.\r\nCharacter Building.\r\nCheck List.\r\nChills.\r\nChoking.\r\nCircle Jumping.\r\nClothing.\r\nClouds.\r\nCocoa.\r\nCoffee.\r\nColds.\r\nCommissary Blank.\r\nCooks.\r\nCouncil.\r\nCramps.\r\nCups, Drinking.\r\nCuts.\r\n\r\nDepartments.\r\nDigestion, Time of.\r\nDirector.\r\nDirt.\r\nDiscipline.\r\nDish Washing.\r\nDislocation.\r\nDrains.\r\nDramas, Outdoor.\r\nDrowning, Rescue from.\r\n\r\nEggs.\r\nEgg Test.\r\nEarache.\r\nEvening Program.\r\nEyes.\r\nFainting.\r\nFee.\r\n\r\nField Glasses.\r\nFireplace.\r\nFirst Aid.\r\nFish (Receipts).\r\nFish, Study of.\r\nFlag Raising and Striking.\r\nFood Charts.\r\nFood, How to Buy.\r\nForestry.\r\nFrog\'s Legs.\r\nFunnel.\r\n\r\nGames and Stunts, Indoor.\r\nGames, Outdoor.\r\nGames, Their Purpose.\r\nGarbage.\r\nGerman Bowling.\r\nGrace at Meals.\r\nGreen Rag Society.\r\nGriddle Cakes.\r\nGrocery List.\r\n\r\nHall of Fame.\r\nHammocks.\r\nHands.\r\nHand Wrestling.\r\nHandy Devices.\r\nHanger.\r\nHeadache.\r\nHealth Board.\r\nHealth Charts.\r\nHealth Maxims.\r\nHealth Talks.\r\nHerbarium.\r\nHiccough.\r\nHonor Awards.\r\nHonor Cup.\r\nHonor Flag.\r\nHonor Plan.\r\nHospital Tent.\r\n"How Men Found the Great Spirit".\r\n\r\nIndian and White Man.\r\nInk, Onion.\r\nInspection.\r\nInternal Organs.\r\n\r\nJumping Standards.\r\n\r\nKites.\r\n\r\nLamps.\r\nLantern Talks.\r\n\r\nLeaders or Counsellor.\r\n Blanks for.\r\n Letter to.\r\n Opportunities of.\r\n Pay of.\r\n Suggestions to.\r\n\r\nLean-to.\r\nLibrary.\r\nLife Saving.\r\n\r\nMap Reading.\r\nMatches, Lighting.\r\nMeasuring Device.\r\nMedical Stores.\r\nMending Pots.\r\nMenu (for hike).\r\nMenus.\r\nMoccasins.\r\nMoral.\r\nMorning Hymn.\r\nMottoes.\r\nMusic.\r\n\r\nNature Study.\r\nNature Study Equipment.\r\nNature Study Walks.\r\nNature Talks.\r\nNose.\r\nNovel Bonfire.\r\n\r\nOld Clothes Race.\r\nOrder of Day.\r\nOrganization Chart.\r\n\r\nPacking Up.\r\nPacks.\r\nPain and Pain Chart.\r\nPaper (Camp Journal).\r\nParachute.\r\nPeanut Relay Race.\r\nPhantom Square.\r\nPhotography.\r\nPhysical Record Blanks.\r\nPhysical Types, Average.\r\nPoison Ivy.\r\nPotatoes.\r\nPulse.\r\nPyrography.\r\n\r\nRation List.\r\nRecords.\r\nReligious Life.\r\nResuscitation.\r\nRoast Corn.\r\nRooster Fight.\r\nRough-house.\r\nRover, All Come over.\r\nRusty Nail.\r\n\r\nScoutcraft.\r\nScout Law.\r\nSelf Government.\r\nServing.\r\nShipping.\r\nShoes.\r\nShoot the Chutes.\r\nSleep.\r\nSore Throat.\r\nSoup.\r\nStories.\r\nStory, A Good Example of.\r\nStretcher.\r\nStunned.\r\nSteward.\r\nStomachache.\r\nSun Dial and Camp Clock.\r\nSun Glass.\r\nSunday.\r\nSunday Talks.\r\nSunstroke.\r\nSurgical Supplies.\r\nSurveying.\r\nSwamps.\r\nSwimming and Bathing.\r\n\r\nTable and Kitchen Ware.\r\nTable Etiquette.\r\nTables and Seats.\r\nTake-off.\r\nTalks, to Individuals.\r\nTo groups, evening.\r\nTo groups, Sunday.\r\nTaps.\r\nTattoo.\r\nTeeth.\r\nTents, Arrangement of.\r\nTents and Teepees.\r\nTether Ball.\r\nThatching.\r\nThermometer, Clinical.\r\nTilting.\r\nToboggans.\r\nToilets.\r\nTongue.\r\nTutoring.\r\nTramper\'s Advice.\r\nTyphoid.\r\n\r\nVolley Ball.\r\n\r\nVreeland Press.\r\n\r\nWaste Barrels.\r\nWater Supply.\r\nWeather Bureau.\r\nWeather Forecast.\r\nWeather Signals, U.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
