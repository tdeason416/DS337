H. VAIL.\r\nM\'G. REV 5TH EC.\r\nEP 310\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\nThe plan of the revision of McGUFFEY\'S FIFTH READER is the same as that\r\npursued in the other books of the REVISED SERIES. The book has been\r\nconsiderably enlarged, but the new pieces have been added or substituted\r\nonly after the most careful consideration, and where the advantages to be\r\nderived were assured.\r\n\r\nIt has been the object to obtain as wide a range of leading authors as\r\npossible, to present the best specimens of style, to insure interest in\r\nthe subjects, to impart valuable information, and to exert a decided and\r\nhealthful moral influence. Thus the essential characteristics of\r\nMcGUFFEY\'S READERS have been carefully kept intact.\r\n\r\nThe preliminary exercises have been retained, and are amply sufficient for\r\ndrill in articulation, inflection, etc. The additional exercises on these\r\nsubjects, formerly inserted between the lessons, have been omitted to make\r\nroom for other valuable features of the REVISED SERIES.\r\n\r\nA full understanding of the text is necessary in order to read it\r\nproperly. As all the books of reference required for this purpose are not\r\nwithin the reach of the majority of pupils, full explanatory notes have\r\nbeen given, which, it is believed, will add greatly not only to the\r\ninterest of the reading lessons, but also to their usefulness from an\r\ninstructive point of view.\r\n\r\nThe definitions of the more difficult words have been given, as formerly;\r\nand the pronunciation has been indicated by diacritical marks, in\r\nconformity with the preceding books of the REVISED SERIES.\r\n\r\nParticular attention is invited to the notices of authors. Comparatively\r\nfew pupils have the opportunity of making a separate study of English and\r\nAmerican literature, and the carefully prepared notices in the REVISED\r\nSERIES are designed, therefore, to supply as much information in regard to\r\nthe leading authors as is possible in the necessarily limited space\r\nassigned. The publishers have desired to illustrate McGUFFEY\'S READERS in\r\na manner worthy of the text and of the high favor in which they are held\r\nthroughout the United States. The most celebrated designers and engravers\r\nof the country have been employed for this purpose.\r\n\r\nIt has been the privilege of the publishers to submit the REVISIED SERIES\r\nto numerous eminent educators in all parts of the country. To the careful\r\nreviews and criticisms of these gentlemen is due, in a large measure, the\r\npresent form of McGUFFEY\'S READERS. The value of these criticisms, coming\r\nfrom practical sources of the highest authority, can not well be\r\noverestimated, and the publishers take this occasion to express their\r\nthanks and their indebtedness to all who have thus kindly assisted them in\r\nthis work.\r\n\r\nEspecial acknowledgment is due to Messrs. Houghton, Osgood\r\n& Co. for their permission to make liberal selections from their\r\ncopyright editions of many of the foremost American authors\r\nwhose works they publish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY MATTER.\r\n\r\n       SUBJECT.\r\n I.

PRELIMINARY REMARKS.\r\n\r\nThe great object to be accomplished in reading, as a rhetorical exercise,\r\nis to convey to the hearer, fully and clearly, the ideas and feelings of\r\nthe writer.\r\n\r\nIn order to do this, it is necessary that a selection should be carefully\r\nstudied by the pupil before he attempts to read it. In accordance with\r\nthis view, a preliminary rule of importance is the following:\r\n\r\nRULE 1.--Before attempting to read a lesson, the learner should make\r\nhimself fully acquainted with the subject as treated of in that lesson,\r\nand endeavor to make the thought and feeling and sentiments of the writer\r\nhis own.\r\n\r\nREMARK.--When he has thus identified himself with the author, he has the\r\nsubstance of all rules in his own mind. It is by going to nature that we\r\nfind rules. The child or the savage orator never mistakes in inflection or\r\nemphasis or modulation. The best speakers and readers are those who follow\r\nthe impulse of nature, or most closely imitate it as observed in others.\r\n\r\nII. ARTICULATION.\r\n\r\nArticulation is the utterance of the elementary sounds of a language, and\r\nof their combinations.\r\n\r\nAn Elementary Sound is a simple, distinct sound made by the organs of\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\nThe Elementary Sounds of the English language are divided into Vocals,\r\nSubvocals, and Aspirates.\r\n\r\nELEMENTARY SOUNDS.--VOCALS.\r\n\r\nVocals are sounds which consist of pure tone only. A diphthong is a union\r\nof two vocals, commencing with one and ending with the other.\r\n\r\nDIRECTION.--Put the lips, teeth, tongue, and palate in their proper\r\nposition; pronounce the word in the chart forcibly, and with the falling\r\ninflection, several times in succession; then drop the subvocal or\r\naspirate sounds which precede or follow the vocal, and repeat the vocals\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nTable of Vocals.\r\n\r\n            Long Vocals.\r\nVocal   as in      Vocal   as in\r\n-----   -----      -----   -----\r\na       hate         e     err\r\na       hare         i     pine\r\na       far          o     no\r\na       pass         u     tube\r\na       fall         u     burn\r\ne       eve         oo     cool\r\n\r\n            Short Vocals\r\nVocal   as in      Vocal   as in\r\n-----   -----      -----   -----\r\na       mat          o     hot\r\ne       met          u     us\r\ni       it          oo     book\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDiphthongs.\r\nVocal     as in\r\n------   --------\r\noi, oy   oil, boy\r\nou, ow   out,now\r\n\r\nREMARK 1.--In this table, the short sounds, except u, are nearly or quite\r\nthe same in quality as certain of the long sounds. The difference consists\r\nchiefly in quantity.\r\n\r\nREMARK 2. The vocals are often represented by other letters or\r\ncombinations of letters than those used in the table; for instance, a is\r\nrepresented by ai in hail, ea in steak, etc.\r\n\r\nREMARK 3.--As a general rule, the long vocals and the diphthongs should be\r\narticulated with a full, clear utterance; but the short vocals have a\r\nsharp, distinct, and almost explosive utterance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBVOCALS AND ASPIRATES.\r\n\r\nSubvocals are those sounds in which the vocalized breath is more or less\r\nobstructed.\r\n\r\nAspirates consist of breath only, modified by the vocal organs.\r\n\r\nWords ending with subvocal sounds should be selected for practice on the\r\nsubvocals; words beginning or ending with aspirate sounds may be used for\r\npractice on the aspirates. Pronounce these words forcibly and distinctly\r\nseveral times in succession; then drop the other sounds, and repeat the\r\nsubvocals and aspirates alone.

In\r\narticulating the aspirates, the vocal organs are put in the position\r\nrequired in the articulation of the corresponding subvocals; but the\r\nbreath is expelled with some force without the utterance of any vocal\r\nsound. The pupil should first verify this by experiment, and then practice\r\non these cognates.\r\n\r\nThe following subvocals and aspirates have no cognates.\r\n\r\n SUBVOCALS.\r\n\r\nSubvocal   as in      Subvocal   as in\r\n--------   -----      --------   -----\r\nl          mill         r        rule\r\nm          rim          r        car\r\nn          run          w        win\r\nng         sing         y        yet\r\n\r\nASPIRATES\r\n\r\nAspirate   as in\r\n--------   -----\r\nh          hat\r\nwh         when\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBSTITUTES.\r\n\r\nSubstitutes are characters used to represent sounds ordinarily represented\r\nby other characters.\r\n\r\nTABLE OF SUBSTITUTES.\r\n\r\nSubstitute   for     as in        Substitute   for     as in\r\n----------   ---     -----        ----------   ---     -----\r\na             o      what            y          i      hymn\r\ne             a      there           c          s      cite\r\ne             a      freight         c          k      cap\r\ni             e      police          ch         sh     machine\r\ni             e      sir             ch         k      chaos\r\no             u      son             g          j      cage\r\no             oo     to              n          ng     rink\r\no             oo     would           s          z      rose\r\no             a      corn            s          ah     sure\r\no             u      work            x          gz     examine\r\nu             oo     pull            gh         f      laugh\r\nu             oo     rude            ph         f      sylph\r\ny             i      my              qu         k      pique\r\nqu            kw     quick\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAULTS TO BE REMEDIED.\r\n\r\nDIRECTION.--Give to each sound, to each syllable, and to each word its\r\nfull, distinct, and appropriate utterance.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of avoiding the more common errors under this head,\r\nobserve the following rules:\r\n\r\nRULE II.--Avoid the omission of unaccented vowels.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\nIncorrect      Correct            Incorrect      Correct\r\n---------      -----------        ----------     ---------\r\nSep\'rate       sep-a-rate         Ev\'dent        ev-i-dent\r\nmet-ric\'l      met-ric-al         mem\'ry         mem-o-ry\r\n\'pear          ap-pear            \'pin-ion       o-pin-ion\r\ncom-p\'tent     com-pe-tent        pr\'pose        pro-pose\r\npr\'cede        pre-cede           gran\'lar       gran-u-lar\r\n\'spe-cial      es-pe-cial         par-tic\'lar    par-tic-u-lar\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRULE III.--Avoid sounding incorrectly the unaccented vowels.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\nIncorrect       Correct            Incorrect       Correct\r\n----------      -----------        ------------    ------------\r\nSep-er-ate      sep-a-rate         Mem-er-ry       mem-o-ry\r\nmet-ric-ul      met-ric-al         up-pin-ion      o-pin-ion\r\nup-pear         ap-pear            prup-ose        pro-pose\r\ncom-per-tent    com-pe-tent        gran-ny-lar     gran-u-lar\r\ndum-mand        de-mand            par-tic-e-lar   par-tic-u-lar\r\nob-stur-nate    ob-sti-nate        ev-er-dent      ev-i-dent\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARK I.--In correcting errors of this kind in words of more than one\r\nsyllable, it is very important to avoid a fault which is the natural\r\nconsequence of an effort to articulate correctly. Thus, in endeavoring to\r\nsound correctly the a in met\'ric-al, the pupil is very apt to say\r\nmet-ric-al\'. accenting the last syllable instead of the first.\r\n\r\nREMARK 2.--The teacher should bear it in mind that in correcting a fault\r\nthere is always danger of erring in the opposite extreme. Properly\r\nspeaking, there is no danger of learning to articulate too distinctly, but\r\nthere is danger of making the obscure sounds too prominent, and of reading\r\nin a slow, measured, and unnatural manner.\r\n\r\nRULE IV.--Utter distinctly the terminating subvocals and aspirates.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\nIncorrect     Correct      Incorrect     Correct\r\n---------     -------      ---------     -------\r\nAn\'           and          Mos\'          mosque\r\nban\'          band         near-es\'      near-est\r\nmoun\'         mound        wep\'          wept\r\nmor-nin\'      morn-ing     ob-jec\'       ob-ject\r\ndes\'          desk         sub-jec       sub-ject\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARK 1.--This omission is still more likely to occur when several\r\nconsonants come together.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\nIncorrect     Correct          Incorrect      Correct\r\n---------     --------         ---------      ----------\r\nThrus\'        thrusts          Harms\'         harm\'st\r\nbeace         beasts           wrongs\'        wrong\'st\r\nthinks\'       thinkst          twinkles\'      twinkl\'dst\r\nweps\'         weptst           black\'ns       black\'n\'dst\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARK 2.--In all cases of this kind these sounds are omitted, in the\r\nfirst instance, merely because they are difficult, and require care and\r\nattention for their utterance, although after a while it becomes a habit.\r\nThe only remedy is to devote that care and attention which may be\r\nnecessary. There is no other difficulty, unless there should be a defect\r\nin the organs of speech, which is not often the case.\r\n\r\nRULE V.--A void blending syllables which belong to different words.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\nINCORRECT.

INFLECTIONS.\r\n\r\nInflections are slides of the voice upward or downward. Of these, there\r\nare two: the rising inflection and the falling inflection.\r\n\r\nThe Rising Inflection is that in which the voice slides upward, and is\r\nmarked thus (\'); as,\r\n\r\n   Did you walk\'? Did you walk.\r\n\r\nThe Falling Inflection is that in which the voice slides downward, and is\r\nmarked thus (\'); as,\r\n\r\n  I did not walk\'. I did not walk.\r\n\r\nBoth inflections are exhibited in the following question:\r\n\r\n  Did you walk\' or ride\'? walk or ride.\r\n\r\nIn the following examples, the first member has the rising and the second\r\nmember the falling inflection:\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.[1]\r\n\r\n  Is he sick\', or is he well\'?\r\n  Did you say valor\', or value\'?\r\n  Did you say statute\', or statue\'?\r\n  Did he act properly\', or improperly\'?\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: These questions and similar ones, with their answers, should\r\nbe repeatedly pronounced with their proper  inflection, until the\r\ndistinction between the rising and falling inflection is well understood\r\nand easily made by the learner. He will be assisted in this by\r\nemphasizing strongly the word which receives the inflection, thus. Did\r\nyou RIDE\' or did you WALK\'?]\r\n\r\nIn the following examples, the inflections are used in a contrary order,\r\nthe first member terminating with the falling and the second with the\r\nrising inflection:\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\n  He is well\', not sick\'.\r\n  I said value\', not valor\'.\r\n  I said statue\', not statute\'.\r\n  He acted properly\', not improperly\'.\r\n\r\n\r\nFALLING INFLECTIONS.\r\n\r\nRule VI.--The falling inflection is generally proper wherever the sense is\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\n  Truth is more wonderful than fiction\'.\r\n  Men generally die as they live\'.\r\n  By industry we obtain wealth\'.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARK.--Parts of a sentence often make complete sense in themselves, and\r\nin this case, unless qualified or restrained by the succeeding clause, or\r\nunless the contrary is indicated by some other principle, the falling\r\ninflection takes place according to the rule.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES\r\n\r\n  Truth is wonderful\', even more so than fiction\'.\r\n\r\n  Men generally die as they live\' and by their actions we must judge of\r\n  their character\'.\r\n\r\n\r\nException.--When a sentence concludes with a negative clause, or with a\r\ncontrast or comparison (called also antithesis), the first member of which\r\nrequires the falling inflection, it must close with the rising inflection.\r\n(See Rule XI, and paragraph 2, Note.)\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\nNo one desires to be thought a fool\'.\r\n\r\nI come to bury\' Caesar, not to praise\' him.\r\n\r\nHe lives in England\' not in France\'.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARK.--In bearing testimony to the general character of a man we say:\r\n\r\n  He is too honorable\' to be guilty of a vile\' act.\r\n\r\nBut if he is accused of some act of baseness, a contrast is at once\r\ninstituted between his character and the specified act, and we change the\r\ninflections, and say:\r\n\r\n  He is too honorable\' to be guilty of such\' an act.\r\n\r\nA man may say in general terms:\r\n\r\n  I am too busy\' for projects\'.\r\n\r\nBut if he is urged to embark in some particular enterprise, he will\r\nchange the inflections, and say:\r\n\r\n  I am too busy\' for projects\'.\r\n\r\nIn such cases, as the falling inflection is required in the former part by\r\nthe principle of contrast and emphasis (as will hereafter be more fully\r\nexplained), the sentence necessarily closes with the rising inflection.\r\nSometimes, also, emphasis alone seems to require the rising inflection on\r\nthe concluding word. See exception to Rule VII.\r\n\r\n(5.-2.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRONG EMPHASIS.\r\n\r\nRULE VII.--Language which demands strong emphasis generally requires the\r\nfalling inflection.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n1. Command or urgent entreaty; as,\r\n\r\n  Begone\',\r\n  Run\' to your houses, fall\' upon your knees,\r\n  Pray\' to the Gods to intermit the plagues.\r\n\r\n  0, save\' me, Hubert\' save\' me I My eyes are out\r\n  Even with the fierce looks of these bloody men.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Exclamation, especially when indicating strong emotion; as,\r\n\r\n  0, ye Gods\'! ye Gods\'! must I endure all this?\r\n\r\n  Hark\'! Hark\'! the horrid sound\r\n  Hath raised up his head.\r\n\r\n\r\nFor interrogatory exclamation, see Rule X, Remark.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSERIES OF WORDS OR MEMBERS.\r\n\r\n3. A series of words or members, whether in the beginning or middle of a\r\nsentence, if it does not conclude the sentence, is called a commencing\r\nseries, and usually requires the rising inflection when not emphatic.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES OF COMMENCING SERIES.\r\n\r\n  Wine\', beauty\', music\', pomp\', are poor expedients to heave off the load\r\n  of an hour from the heir of eternity\'.\r\n\r\n  I conjure you by that which you profess,\r\n  (Howe\'er you came to know it,) answer me;\r\n  Though you untie the winds and let them fight\r\n  Against the churches\'; though the yeasty waves\r\n  Confound and swallow navigation\' up;\r\n  Though bladed corn be lodged, and trees blown down\';\r\n  Though castles topple on their warders\' heads\';\r\n  Though palaces and pyramids do slope\r\n  Their heads to their foundations\'; though the treasures\r\n  Of nature\'s germens tumble altogether\',\r\n  Even till destruction sicken\'; answer me\r\n  To what I ask\' you.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. A series of words or members which concludes a sentence is called a\r\nconcluding series, and each member usually has the falling inflection.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLE OF CONCLUDING SERIES.\r\n\r\nThey, through faith, subdued kingdoms\', wrought righteousness\' obtained\r\npromises\', stopped the mouths of lions\', quenched the violence of fire\',\r\nescaped the edge of the sword\', out of weakness were made strong\', waxed\r\nvaliant in fight\', turned to flight the armies of the aliens\'.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARK.--When the emphasis on these words or members is not marked, they\r\ntake the rising inflection, according to Rule IX.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\n  They are the offspring of restlessness\', vanity\', and idleness\'.\r\n  Love\', hope\', and joy\' took possession of his breast.\r\n\r\n5. When words which naturally take the rising inflection become emphatic\r\nby repetition or any other cause, they often take the falling inflection.\r\n\r\nException to the Rule.--While the tendency of emphasis is decidedly to the\r\nuse of the falling inflection, sometimes a word to which the falling\r\ninflection naturally belongs changes this, when it is emphatic, for the\r\nrising inflection.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\n  Three thousand ducats\': \'t is a good round sum\'.\r\n  It is useless to point out the beauties of nature to one who is blind\'.\r\n\r\nHere sum and blind, according to Rule VI, would take the falling\r\ninflection, but as they are emphatic, and the object of emphasis is to\r\ndraw attention to the word emphasized, this is here accomplished in part\r\nby giving an unusual inflection. Some speakers would give these words the\r\ncircumflex, but it would he the rising circumflex, so that the sound would\r\nstill terminate with the rising inflection.\r\n\r\nRULE VIII.--Questions which can not be answered by yes or no, together\r\nwith their answers, generally require the falling inflection.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\nWhere has he gone\'?    Ans. To New York\'.\r\nWhat has he done\'?     Ans. Nothing\'.\r\nWho did this\'?         Ans. I know not\'.\r\nWhen did he go\'?       Ans. Yesterday\'.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARK.--It these questions are repeated, the inflection is changed\r\naccording to the principle stated under the Exception to Rule VII.\r\n\r\n\r\nRISING INFLECTION.\r\n\r\nRULE IX.--Where a pause is rendered proper by the meaning, and the sense\r\nis incomplete, the rising inflection is generally required.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\nTo endure slander and abuse with meekness\' requires no ordinary degree of\r\nself-command\',\r\n\r\nNight coming on\', both armies retired from the field of battle\'.\r\n\r\nAs a dog returneth to his vomit\', so a fool returneth to his folly\'.\r\n\r\nREMARK.--The person or object addressed, in ordinary conversation, comes\r\nunder this head.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\nFathers\'! we once again are met in council.\r\n\r\nMy lords\'! and gentlemen\'! we have arrived at an awful crisis.\r\n\r\nAge\'! thou art shamed.\r\n\r\nRome\'! thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!\r\n\r\n\r\nException.--Where a word which, according to this rule, requires the\r\nrising inflection, becomes emphatic, it generally has the falling\r\ninflec-tion; as, when a child addresses his father, he first says,\r\nFather\'! but if he repeats it emphatically, he changes the inflection, and\r\nsays, Father\'! Father\'! The falling inflection is also used in formal\r\naddress; as, Fellow--citizens\', Mr. President\', etc.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\nWhen we aim at a high standard, if we do not attain\' it, we shall secure a\r\nhigh degree of excellence.\r\n\r\nThose who mingle with the vicious, if they do not become depraved\', will\r\nlose all delicacy of feeling.\r\n\r\nRULE X.--Questions which may be answered by yes or no, generally require\r\nthe rising, and their answers the falling inflection.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\nHas he arrived\'? Yes\'.\r\nWill he return\'? No\'.\r\nDoes the law condemn him\'? It does not\'.\r\n\r\nException.--If these questions are repeated emphatically, they take the\r\nfalling inflection, according to Rule VII.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\nHas he arrived\'?\r\nWill he return\'?\r\nDoes the law condemn him\'?\r\n\r\nREMARK.--When a word or sentence is repeated as a kind of interrogatory\r\nexclamation, the rising inflection is used according to the principles of\r\nthis rule.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\nYou ask, who would venture\' in such a cause! Who would venture\'? Rather\r\nsay, who would not\' venture all things for such an object!\r\n\r\nHe is called the friend\' of virtue. The friend\'! ay! the enthusiastic\r\nlover\' the devoted protector\' rather.\r\n\r\nSo, also, when one receives unexpected information he exclaims, Ah\'!\r\nindeed\'!\r\n\r\nREMARK.--In the above examples the words "venture," "friend," "ah," etc.,\r\nmay be considered as interrogatory exclamations, because if the sense were\r\ncarried out it would be in the form of question; as, "Do you ask who would\r\nventure\'?" "Do you say that he is the friend\' of virtue?" "Is it\r\npossible\'?" and thus they would receive the rising inflection according to\r\nthis rule.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRISING AND FALLING INFLECTIONS.\r\n\r\nRULE XI.--The different members of a sentence expressing comparison, or\r\ncontrast, or negation and affirmation, or where the parts are united by or\r\nused disjunctively, require different inflections; generally the rising\r\ninflection in the first member, and the falling inflection in the second\r\nmember. This order is, however, sometimes inverted.\r\n\r\n1. Comparison and contrast. This is also called antithesis.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\nIn all things approving ourselves as the ministers of God; by honor\', and\r\ndishonor\'; by evil\' report, and good\' report; as deceivers\', and yet\r\ntrue\'; as unknown\', and yet well\' known; as dying\', and behold we live\';\r\nas chastened\', and not killed\'; as sorrowful\', yet always rejoicing\'; as\r\npoor\', yet making many rich\'; as having nothing\', yet possessing all\'\r\nthings.\r\n\r\nEurope was one great battlefield, where the weak struggled for freedom\',\r\nand the strong for dominion\'. The king was without power\', and the nobles\r\nwithout principle\', They were tyrants at home\', and robbers abroad\'.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Negation and affirmation.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\n  He desired not to injure\' his friend, but to protect\' him.\r\n  We desire not your money\', but yourselves\'.\r\n  I did not say a better\' soldier, but, an elder\'.\r\n\r\nIf the affirmative clause comes first, the order of the inflections is\r\ninverted.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\n  He desired to protect\' his friend, not to injure\' him.\r\n  We desire yourselves\', not your money\'.\r\n  I said an elder\' soldier, not a better\'.\r\n\r\nThe affirmative clause is sometimes understood.\r\n\r\n  We desire not your money\'.\r\n  I did not say a better\' soldier.\r\n  The region beyond the grave is not a solitary\' land.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn most negative sentences standing alone, the corresponding affirmative\r\nis understood; hence the following.\r\n\r\nREMARK.--Negative sentences, whether alone or connected with an\r\naffirmative clause, generally end with the rising inflection.\r\n\r\n\r\nIf such sentences are repeated emphatically, they take the falling\r\ninflection according to Rule VI.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\n  We do not\' desire your money.\r\n  I did not\' say a. better soldier.\r\n\r\n3. Or used disjunctively.\r\n\r\n  Did he behave properly\', or improperly\'?\r\n\r\n  Are they living/, or dead\'?\r\n\r\n  Is he rich\', or poor\'?\r\n\r\n  Does God, having made his creatures, take no further\' care of them, or\r\n  does he preserve and guide them\'?\r\n\r\nREMARK.--Where or is used conjunctively, this rule does not apply; as,\r\nWill the law of kindness\' or of justice\' justify such conduct\'?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCIRCUMFLEX.\r\n\r\nThe circumflex is a union of the rising and falling inflections. Properly\r\nspeaking, there are two of these, the one called the rising circumflex, in\r\nwhich the voice slides down and then up; and the other, the falling\r\ncircumflex, in which the voice slides upward and then downward on the same\r\nvowel. They may both be denoted by the same mark, thus, (^). The\r\ncircumflex is used chiefly to indicate the emphasis of irony, of contrast,\r\nor of hypothesis.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\n1. Queen. Hamlet, you have your father much offended.\r\n   Hamlet. Madam, you have my father much offended.\r\n\r\n2. They offer us their protec\'tion. Yes\', such protection as vultures give\r\n   to lambs, covering and devouring them.\r\n\r\n3. I knew when seven justices could not make up a quarrel; but when the\r\nparties met themselves, one of them thought but of an if; as, If you said\r\nso, then I said so; O ho! did you say so! So they shook hands and were\r\nsworn brothers.\r\n\r\nREMARKS.--In the first example, the emphasis is that of contrast. The\r\nqueen had poisoned her husband, of which she incorrectly supposed her son\r\nignorant, and she blames him for treating his father-in-law with\r\ndisrespect. In his reply, Hamlet contrasts her deep crime with his own\r\nslight offense, and the circumflex upon "you" becomes proper.\r\n\r\nIn the second example the emphasis is ironical. The Spaniards pretended\r\nthat they would protect the Peruvians if they would submit to them,\r\nwhereas it was evident that they merely desired to plunder and destroy\r\nthem. Thus their protection is ironically called "such protection as\r\nvultures give to lambs," etc.\r\n\r\nIn the third example, the word "so" is used hypothetically; that is, it\r\nimplies a condition or supposition. It will be observed that the rising\r\ncircumflex is used in the first "so," and the falling, in the second,\r\nbecause the first "so" must end with the rising inflection and the second\r\nwith the falling inflection, according to previous rules.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMONOTONE.\r\n\r\nWhen no word in a sentence receives an inflection, it is said to be read\r\nin a monotone; that is, in nearly the same tone throughout. This\r\nuniformity of tone is occa-sionally adopted, and is fitted to express\r\nsolemnity or sublimity of idea, and sometimes intensity of feeling. It is\r\nused, also, when the whole sentence or phrase is emphatic. In books of\r\nelocution, when it is marked at all, it is generally marked thus (---), as\r\nin the lines following.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\nHence! loathed melancholy!\r\nWhere brooding darkness spreads her jealous wings,\r\nAnd the night raven sings;\r\nThere, under ebon shades and low-browed rocks,\r\nAs ragged as thy locks,\r\nIn deep Cimmerian darkness ever dwell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. ACCENT.\r\n\r\nIn every word which contains more than one syllable, one of the syllables\r\nis pronounced with a somewhat greater stress of voice than the others.\r\nThis syllable is said to be accented. The accented syllable is\r\ndistinguished by this mark (\'), the same which is used in inflections.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\n      Love\'ly,      re-turn\',      re-mem\'ber,\r\n      Con\'stant,    re-main\',      a-sun\'der,\r\n      Mem\'ber,      a-bide\',       a-ban\'don,\r\n      Win\'dow,      a-tone\',       rec-ol-lect\',\r\n      Ban\'ner,      a-lone\',       re-em-bark\',\r\n\r\nREMARK.--In most cases custom is the only guide for placing the accent on\r\none syllable rather than another. Sometimes, however, the same word is\r\ndifferently accented in order to mark its different meanings.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\nCon\'jure, to practice enchantments.     Con-jure\', to entreat.\r\nGal\'lant, brave.                        Gal-lant\', a gay fellow.\r\nAu\'gust, a month.                       Au-gust\', grand.\r\n\r\nREMARK.--A number of words used sometimes as one part of speech, and\r\nsometimes as another, vary their accents irregularly.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\nPres\'ent, noun.     Pres\'ent, adjective.       Pre-sent\', verb.\r\nCom\'pact, noun.     Com-pact\', adjective.      Com-pact\', verb.\r\n\r\nIn words of more than two syllables there is often a second accent given,\r\nbut more slight than the principal one, and this is called the secondary\r\naccent; as, car\'a-van\'\', rep\'\'ar-tee\', where the principal accent is\r\nmarked (\') and the secondary (\'\'); so, also, this accent is obvious in\r\nnav\'\'-i-ga\'tion, com\'\'pre-hen\'sion, plau\'\'si-bil\'i-ty, etc. The whole\r\nsubject, however, properly belongs to dictionaries and spelling books.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. EMPHASIS.\r\n\r\nA word is said to be emphasized when it is uttered with a greater stress\r\nof voice than the other words with which it is connected.\r\n\r\nREMARK 1.--The object of emphasis is to attract particular attention to\r\nthe word upon which it is placed, indicating that the idea to be conveyed\r\ndepends very much upon that word. This object, as just stated, is\r\ngenerally accomplished by increasing the force of utterance, but\r\nsometimes, also, by a change in the inflection, by the use of the\r\nmonotone, by pause, or by uttering the words in a very low key. Emphatic\r\nwords are often denoted by italics, and a still stronger emphasis by SMALL\r\nCAPITALS or CAPITALS, according to the degree of emphasis desired.\r\n\r\nREMARK 2.--Emphasis constitutes the most important feature in reading and\r\nspeaking, and, properly applied, gives life and character to language.\r\nAccent, inflection, and indeed everything yields to emphasis.\r\n\r\nREMARK 3.--In the following examples it will be seen that accent is\r\ngoverned by it.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\n  What is done cannot be undone.\r\n  There is a difference between giving and forgiving.\r\n  He that descended is the same that ascended.\r\n\r\nSome appear to make very little difference between decency and indecency,\r\nmorality and immorality, religion and irreligion.\r\n\r\nREMARK 4.--There is no better illustration of the nature and importance of\r\nemphasis than the following examples. It will he observed that the meaning\r\nand proper answer of the question vary with each change of the emphasis.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\nQUESTIONS.                               ANSWERS.\r\n---------                                --------\r\nDid you walk into the city yesterday?    No, my brother went.\r\n\r\nDid you walk into the city yesterday?    No, I rode.\r\n\r\nDid you walk into the city yesterday?    No, I went into the country.\r\n\r\nDid you walk into the city yesterday?    No, I went the day before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nABSOLUTE EMPHASIS.\r\n\r\nSometimes a word is emphasized simply to indicate the importance of the\r\nidea. This is called absolute emphasis.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\n  To arms! they come! the Greek! the Greek!\r\n  Woe unto you, PHARISEES! HYPOCRITES!\r\n  Days, months, years, and ages shall circle away.\r\n\r\nREMARK.--In instances like the last, it is sometimes called the emphasis\r\nof specification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRELATIVE EMPHASIS.\r\n\r\nWords are often emphasized in order to exhibit the idea they express as\r\ncompared or contrasted with some other idea. This is called relative\r\nemphasis.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\nA friend can not be known in prosperity; an enemy can not be hidden in\r\nadversity.\r\n\r\nIt is much better to be injured than to injure.\r\n\r\nREMARK.--In many instances one part only of the antithesis is expressed,\r\nthe corresponding idea being understood; as,\r\n\r\n            A friendly eye would never see such faults.\r\n\r\nHere the unfriendly eye is understood.\r\n\r\nKing Henry exclaims, while vainly endeavoring to compose\r\nhimself to rest,\r\n\r\n  "How many thousand of my poorest subjects\r\n  Are at this hour asleep!"\r\n\r\nHere the emphatic words thousand, subjects, and asleep are contrasted in\r\nidea with their opposites, and if the contrasted ideas were expressed it\r\nmight be in this way:\r\n\r\n  While I alone, their sovereign, am doomed to wakefulness.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEMPHATIC PHRASE.\r\n\r\nSometimes several words in succession are emphasized, forming what is\r\ncalled an emphatic phrase.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\nShall I, the conqueror of Spain and Gaul, and not only of the Alpine\r\nnations but of the Alps themselves--shall I compare myself with this\r\nHALF--YEAR--CAPTAIN?\r\n\r\nShall we try argument? Sir, we have been trying that for the LAST TEN\r\nYEARS.\r\n\r\n  And if thou said\'st I am not peer\r\n  To any lord in Scotland here,\r\n  Lowland or Highland, far or near,\r\n  Lord Angus-THOU-HAST-LIED!\r\n\r\nEMPHATIC PAUSE.\r\n\r\nThe emphatic expression of a sentence often requires a pause where the\r\ngrammatical construction authorizes none. This is sometimes called the\r\nrhetorical pause. Such pauses occur chiefly before or after an emphatic\r\nword or phrase, and sometimes both before and after it.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\nRise--fellow-men! our country--yet remains!\r\nBy that dread name we wave the sword on high,\r\nAnd swear for her--to live--with her--to die.\r\n\r\nBut most--by numbers judge the poet\'s song:\r\nAnd smooth or rough, with them is--right or wrong.\r\n\r\nHe said; then full before their sight\r\nProduced the beast, and lo!--\'t was white.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. MODULATION.\r\n\r\nModulation includes the variations of the voice. These may be classed\r\nunder the heads of Pitch, Compass, Quantity, and Quality.\r\n\r\nPITCH AND COMPASS.\r\n\r\nIf anyone will notice closely a sentence as uttered in private\r\nconversation, he will observe that very few successive words are\r\npronounced in exactly the same key or with the same force. At the same\r\ntime, however, there is a certain PITCH or key, which seems, on the whole,\r\nto prevail.\r\n\r\nThis keynote, or governing note, as it may be called, is that upon which\r\nthe voice most frequently dwells, to which it usually returns when\r\nwearied, and upon which a sentence generally commences, and very\r\nfrequently ends, while, at the same time, there is a considerable play of\r\nthe voice above and below it.\r\n\r\nThis key may be high or low. It varies in different individuals, and at\r\ndifferent times in the same individual, being governed by the nature of\r\nthe subject and the emotions of the speaker. It is worthy of notice,\r\nhowever, that most speakers pitch their voices on a key too high.\r\n\r\nThe range of the voice above and below this note is called its COMPASS.\r\nWhen the speaker is animated, this range is great; but upon abstract\r\nsubjects, or with a dull speaker, it is small. If, in reading or speaking,\r\ntoo high a note be chosen, the lungs will soon become wearied; if too low\r\na pitch be selected, there is danger of indistinctness of utterance; and\r\nin either case there is less room for compass or variety of tone than if\r\none be taken between the two extremes.\r\n\r\nTo secure the proper pitch and the greatest compass observe the following\r\nrule:\r\n\r\nRULE XII.--The reader or speaker should choose that pitch in which he can\r\nfeel himself most at ease, and above and below which he may have most room\r\nfor variation.\r\n\r\nREMARK 1.--Having chosen the proper keynote, he should beware of confining\r\nhimself to it. This constitutes monotony, one of the greatest faults in\r\nelocution. One very important instrument for giving expression and life to\r\nthought is thus lost, and the hearer soon becomes wearied and disgusted.\r\n\r\nREMARK 2.--There is another fault of nearly equal magnitude, and of very\r\nfrequent occurrence. This consists in varying the pitch and force without\r\nreference to the sense. A sentence is commenced with vehemence and in a\r\nhigh key, and the voice gradually sinks until, the breath being spent, it\r\ndies away in a whisper.\r\n\r\nNOTE--The power of changing the key at will is difficult to acquire, but\r\nof great importance.\r\n\r\nREMARK 3.--The habit of singsong, so common in reading poetry, as it is a\r\nvariation of pitch without reference to the sense, is a species of the\r\nfault above mentioned.\r\n\r\nREMARK 4.--If the reader or speaker is guided by the sense, and if he\r\ngives that emphasis, inflection, and expression required by the meaning,\r\nthese faults speedily disappear.\r\n\r\nREMARK 5.--To improve the voice in these respects, practice is necessary.\r\nCommence, for example, with the lowest pitch the voice can comfortably\r\nsound, and repeat whole paragraphs and pages upon that key with gentle\r\nforce. Then repeat the paragraph with increased force, taking care not to\r\nraise the pitch. Then rise one note higher, and practice on that, then\r\nanother, and so on, until the highest pitch of the voice is reached.\r\nReverse the process, and repeat as before until the lowest pitch is\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--In these and all similar exercises, be very careful not to\r\nconfound pitch and force.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nQUANTITY AND QUALITY.\r\n\r\nThe tones of the voice should vary also in quantity, or time required to\r\nutter a sound or a syllable, and in quality, or expression, according to\r\nthe nature of the subject.\r\n\r\nREMARK.--We notice a difference between the soft, insinuating tones of\r\npersuasion; the full, strong voice of command and decision; the harsh,\r\nirregular, and sometimes grating explosion of the sounds of passion; the\r\nplaintive notes of sorrow and pity; and the equable and unimpassioned flow\r\nof words in argumentative style.\r\n\r\nThe following direction, therefore, is worthy of attention:\r\n\r\nThe tones of the voice should always correspond both in quantity and\r\nquality with the nature of the subject.\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\nPassion and Grief\r\n\r\n   "Come back! come back!" he cried, in grief.\r\n   "Across this stormy water,\r\n   And I\'ll forgive your Highland chief,\r\n      My daughter! O, my daughter!"\r\n\r\n\r\nPlaintive\r\n  I have lived long enough: my way of life\r\n  Is fallen into the sear, the yellow leaf:\r\n  And that which should accompany old age,\r\n  As honor, love, obedience, troops of friends,\r\n  I must not look to have.\r\n\r\n\r\nCalm\r\n   A very great portion of this globe is covered  with water, which is\r\n   called sea, and is very distinct from rivers and lakes.\r\n\r\n\r\nFierce Anger\r\n\r\n  Burned Marmion\'s swarthy cheek like fire,\r\n  And shook his very frame for ire,\r\n        And--"This to me?" he said;\r\n     "And \'t were not for thy hoary beard,\r\n  Such hand as Marmion\'s had not spared\r\n     To cleave the Douglas\' head!\r\n\r\n\r\nLoud and Explosive\r\n\r\n     "Even in thy pitch of pride,\r\n  Here, in thy hold, thy vassals near,\r\n      I tell thee thou \'rt defied!\r\n  And if thou said\'st I am not peer\r\n  To any lord in Scotland here,\r\n  Lowland or Highland, far or near,\r\n  Lord Angus, thou hast lied \'"\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARK 1.--In our attempt to imitate nature it is important to avoid\r\naffectation, for to this fault even perfect monotony is preferable.\r\n\r\nREMARK 2.--The strength of the voice may be increased by practicing with\r\ndifferent degrees of loudness, from a whisper to full rotundity, taking\r\ncare to keep the voice on the same key. The same note in music may be\r\nsounded loud or soft. So also a sentence may be pronounced on the same\r\npitch with different degrees of loudness. Having practiced with different\r\ndegrees of loudness on one key, make the same experiment on another, and\r\nthen on another, and so on. This will also give the learner practice in\r\ncompass,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. POETIC PAUSES.\r\n\r\nIn poetry we have, in addition to other pauses, poetic pauses. The object\r\nof these is simply to promote the melody.\r\n\r\nAt the end of each line a slight pause is proper, whatever be the\r\ngrammatical construction or the sense. The purpose of this pause is to\r\nmake prominent the melody of the measure, and in rhyme to allow the ear to\r\nappreciate the harmony of the similar sounds.\r\n\r\nThere is, also, another important pause, somewhere near the middle of each\r\nline, which is called the caesura or caesural pause. In the following\r\nlines it is marked thus (||):\r\n\r\nEXAMPLES.\r\n\r\n  There are hours long departed || which memory brings,\r\n    Like blossoms of Eden || to twine round the heart,\r\n  And as time rushes by || on the might of his wings,\r\n    They may darken awhile || but they never depart.\r\n\r\nREMARK.--The caesural pause should never be so placed as to injure the\r\nsense. The following lines, if melody alone were consulted, would be read\r\nthus:\r\n\r\n  With fruitless la || bor Clara bound,\r\n  And strove to stanch || the gushing wound;\r\n  The Monk with un || availing cares,\r\n  Exhausted all || the church\'s prayers.\r\n\r\nThis manner of reading, however, would very much interfere with the proper\r\nexpression of the idea. This is to be corrected by making the caesural\r\npause yield to the sense. The above lines should be read thus:\r\n\r\n  With fruitless labor || Clara bound,\r\n  And strove || to stanch the gushing wound;\r\n  The Monk || with unavailing cares,\r\n  Exhausted || all the church\'s prayers,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISES.\r\n\r\nI. DEATH OF FRANKLIN.\r\n(To be read in a solemn tone.)\r\n\r\nFranklin is dead. The genius who freed America\', and poured a\r\ncopious stream of knowledge throughout Europe\', is returned unto the bosom\r\nof the Divinity\'. The sage to whom two worlds\' lay claim, the man for whom\r\nscience\' and politics\' are disputing, indisputably enjoyed au elevated\r\nrank in human nature.\r\n\r\nThe cabinets of princes have been long in the habit of notifying the death\r\nof those who were great\', only in their funeral orations\'. Long hath the\r\netiquette of courts\', proclaimed the mourning of hypocrisy\'. Nations\'\r\nshould wear mourning for none but their benefactors\'. The representatives\'\r\nof nations should recommend to public homage\' only those who have been the\r\nheroes of humanity\'.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. BONAPARTE.\r\n\r\nHe knew no motive\' but interst\'; acknowledged no criterion\' but success\';\r\nhe worshiped no God\' but ambition\'; and with an eastern devotion\', he\r\nknelt at the shrine of his idolatry\'. Subsidiary to this, there was no\r\ncreed\' that he did not profess\'; there was no opinion\' that he did not\r\npromulgate\': in the hope of a dynasty\', he upheld the crescent\'; for the\r\nsake of a divorce\', he bowed before the cross\'; the orphan of St. Louis\',\r\nhe became the adopted child of the republic\'; and, with a parricidal\r\ningrati-tude\', on the ruins both of the throne and the tribune, he reared\r\nthe throne of his despotism\'.\r\n\r\nAt his touch crowns\' crumbled\'; beggars\' reigned\'; systems\' van-ished\';\r\nthe wildest theories\' took the color of his whim\'; and all that was\r\nvenerable\' and all that was novel\', changed places with the rapidity of a\r\ndrama\'. Nature had no obstacle\' that he did not surmount\'; space, no\r\nopposition\' he did not spurn\'; and whether amid Alpine rocks\',--Arabian\r\nsands\',--or Polar snows\',---he seemed proof\' against peril\', and empowered\r\nwith ubiquity\'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. HAMLET ON SEEING THE SKULL OF YORICK.\r\n\r\nAlas, poor Yorick\'! I knew him\', Horatio\'; a fellow of infinite jest\', of\r\nmost excellent fancy\'. He hath borne me on his back\' a thousand times\';\r\nand now\', how abhorred my imagination is\'! My gorge rises\' at it. Here\r\nhung those lips that I have kissed\', I know not how oft\', Where be your\r\ngibes\' now? your gambols\'? your songs\'? your flashes of merriment\', that\r\nwere wont to set the table on a roar\'? Not one\', now, to mock your own\r\ngrinning\'? quite chopfallen\'? Now get you to my lady\'s chamber\' and tell\r\nher\', let her paint an inch thick\' to this favor\' she must come\'; make her\r\nlaugh at that\'.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. DESCRIPTION OF A BATTLE.\r\n\r\nYet still Lord Marmion\'s falcon flew\'\r\nWith wavering flight\', while fiercer grew\r\n  Around, the battle yell.\r\nThe border slogan rent the sky\',\r\nA Home\'! a Gordon\'! was the cry\';\r\n  Loud\' were the clanging blows\';\r\nAdvanced\',--forced back\',--now low\',--now high\',\r\n  The pennon sunk\'--and rose\';\r\nAs bends the bark\'s mast in the gale\',\r\nWhen rent are rigging\', shrouds\', and sail\',\r\n  It wavered \'mid the foes\'.\r\nThe war, that for a space did fail\',\r\nNow trebly thundering swelled the gale\',\r\n  And Stanley\'! was the cry;\r\nA light on Marmion\'s visage spread\',\r\n  And fired his glazing eye\':--\r\nWith dying\' hand\', above his head\',\r\nHe shook the fragment of his blade\',\r\n  And shouted\',--"Victory\'!\r\nCharge\', Chester\', charge\'! On\' Stanley\', on\'!"--\r\n  Were the last words of Marmion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. LORD ULLIN\'S DAUGHTER.\r\n\r\nFor the inflections and emphasis in this selection, let the pupil be\r\nguided by his own judgment.\r\n\r\nA chieftain to the Highlands bound,\r\n  Cries, "Boatman, do not tarry!\r\nAnd I\'ll give thee a silver pound,\r\n  To row us o\'er the ferry."\r\n\r\n"Now, who be ye would cross Loch-Gyle\r\n  This dark and stormy water?"\r\n"Oh! I\'m the chief of Ulva\'s isle,\r\n  And this, Lord Ullin\'s daughter.\r\n\r\n"And fast before her father\'s men\r\n  Three days we\'ve fled together,\r\nFor should he find us in the glen,\r\n  My blood would stain the heather.\r\n\r\n"His horsemen hard behind us ride;\r\n  Should they our steps discover,\r\nThen who will cheer my bonny bride,\r\n  When they have slain her lover?"\r\n\r\nOut spoke the hardy Highland wight\r\n  "I\'ll go, my chief--I\'m ready:\r\nIt is not for your silver bright,\r\n  But for your winsome lady:\r\n\r\n"And, by my word! the bonny bird\r\n  In danger shall not tarry;\r\nSo, though the waves are raging white,\r\n  I\'ll row you o\'er the ferry."\r\n\r\nBy this, the storm grew loud apace,\r\n  The water wraith was shrieking;\r\nAnd, in the scowl of heaven, each face\r\n  Grew dark as they were speaking.\r\n\r\nBut still, as wilder grew the wind,\r\n  And as the night grew drearer,\r\nAdown the glen rode armed men,\r\n  Their trampling sounded nearer.\r\n\r\n"Oh I haste thee, haste!" the lady cries\r\n  "Though tempest round us gather,\r\nI\'ll meet the raging of the skies,\r\n  But not an angry father."\r\n\r\nThe boat has left the stormy land,\r\n  A stormy sea before her;\r\nWhen, oh I too strong for human hand,\r\n  The tempest gathered o\'er her.\r\n\r\nAnd still they rowed, amid the roar\r\n  Of waters fast prevailing;\r\nLord Ullin reached that fatal shore,\r\n  His wrath was changed to wailing.\r\n\r\nFor sore dismay through storm and shade\r\n  His child he did discover;\r\nOne lovely hand she stretched for aid,\r\n  And one was round her lover.\r\n\r\n"Come back! come back!" he cried, in grief,\r\n  "Across this stormy water;\r\nAnd I\'ll forgive your Highland chief,\r\n  My daughter! O, my daughter!"\r\n\r\n\'T was vain: the loud waves lashed the shore,\r\n  Return or aid preventing;\r\nThe waters wild went o\'er his child,\r\n  And he was left lamenting.\r\n\r\n                             --Thomas Campbell\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALPHABETICAL LIST OF AUTHORS.\r\n\r\n    Name.

It is told of Frederick the Great, King of Prussia, that, as he was\r\nseated one day in his private room, a written petition was brought to him\r\nwith the request that it should be immediately read.  The King had just\r\nreturned from hunting, and the glare of the sun, or some other cause, had\r\nso dazzled his eyes that he found it difficult to make out a single word\r\nof the writing.\r\n\r\n2. His private secretary happened to be absent; and the soldier who\r\nbrought the petition could not read. There was a page, or favorite boy\r\nservant, waiting in the hall, and upon him the King called. The page was a\r\nson of one of the noblemen of the court, but proved to be a very poor\r\nreader.\r\n\r\n3. In the first place, he did not articulate distinctly. He huddled his\r\nwords together in the utterance, as if they were syllables of one long\r\nword, which he must get through with as speedily as possible. His\r\npronunciation was bad, and he did not modulate his voice so as to bring\r\nout the meaning of what he read. Every sentence was uttered with a dismal\r\nmonotony of voice, as if it did not differ in any respect from that which\r\npreceded it.\r\n\r\n4. "Stop!" said the King, impatiently. "Is it an auctioneer\'s list of\r\ngoods to be sold that you are hurrying over? Send your companion to me."\r\nAnother page who stood at the door now entered, and to him the King gave\r\nthe petition. The second page began by hemming and clearing his throat in\r\nsuch an affected manner that the King jokingly asked him whether he had\r\nnot slept in the public garden, with the gate open, the night before.\r\n\r\n5. The second page had a good share of self-conceit, however, and so was\r\nnot greatly confused by the King\'s jest. He determined that he would avoid\r\nthe mistake which his comrade had made. So he commenced reading the\r\npetition slowly and with great formality, emphasizing every word, and\r\nprolonging the articulation of every syllable. But his manner was so\r\ntedious that the King cried out, "Stop! are you reciting a lesson in the\r\nelementary sounds? Out of the room! But no: stay! Send me that little girl\r\nwho is sitting there by the fountain."\r\n\r\n6. The girl thus pointed out by the King was a daughter of one of the\r\nlaborers employed by the royal gardener; and she had come to help her\r\nfather weed the flower beds. It chanced that, like many of the poor people\r\nin Prussia, she had received a good education. She was somewhat alarmed\r\nwhen she found herself in the King\'s presence, but took courage when the\r\nKing told her that he only wanted her to read for him, as his eyes were\r\nweak.\r\n\r\n7. Now, Ernestine (for this was the name of the little girl) was fond of\r\nreading aloud, and often many of the neighbors would assemble at her\r\nfather\'s house to hear her; those who could not read themselves would come\r\nto her, also, with their letters from distant friends or children, and she\r\nthus formed the habit of reading various sorts of handwriting promptly and\r\nwell.\r\n\r\n8. The King gave her the petition, and she rapidly glanced through the\r\nopening lines to get some idea of what it was about. As she read, her eyes\r\nbegan to glisten, and her breast to heave. "What is the matter?" asked the\r\nKing; "don\'t you know how to read?" "Oh, yes! sire," she replied,\r\naddressing him with the title usually applied to him: "I will now read it,\r\nif you please."\r\n\r\n9. The two pages wore about to leave the room. "Remain," said the King.\r\nThe little girl began to read the petition. It was from a poor widow,\r\nwhose only son had been drafted to serve in the army, although his health\r\nwas delicate and his pursuits had been such as to unfit him for military\r\nlife. His father had been killed in battle, and the son had a strong\r\ndesire to become a portrait painter.\r\n\r\n10. The writer told her story in a simple, concise manner, that carried to\r\nthe heart a belief of its truth; and Ernestine read it with so much\r\nfeeling, and with an articulation so just, in tones so pure and distinct,\r\nthat when she had finished, the King, into whose eyes the tears had\r\nstarted, exclaimed, "Oh! now I understand what it is all about; but I\r\nmight never have known, certainly I never should have felt, its meaning\r\nhad I trusted to these young gentlemen, whom I now dismiss from my service\r\nfor one year, advising them to occupy their time in learning to read."\r\n\r\n11. "As for you, my young lady," continued the King, "I know you will ask\r\nno better reward for your trouble than the pleasure of carrying to this\r\npoor widow my order for her son\'s immediate discharge. Let me see whether\r\nyou can write as well as you can read. Take this pen, and write as I\r\ndictate." He then dictated an order, which Ernestine wrote, and he signed.\r\nCalling one of his guards, he bade him go with the girl and see that the\r\norder was obeyed.\r\n\r\n12. How much happiness was Ernestine the means of bestowing through her\r\ngood elocution, united to the happy circumstance that brought it to the\r\nknowledge of the King! First, there were her poor neighbors, to whom she\r\ncould give instruction and entertainment. Then, there was the poor widow\r\nwho sent the petition, and who not only regained her son, but received\r\nthrough Ernestine an order for him to paint the King\'s likeness; so that\r\nthe poor boy soon rose to great distinction, and had more orders than he\r\ncould attend to. Words could not express his gratitude, and that of his\r\nmother, to the little girl.\r\n\r\n13. And Ernestine had, moreover, the satisfaction of aiding her father to\r\nrise in the world, so that he became the King\'s chief gardener. The King\r\ndid not forget her, but had her well educated at his own expense. As for\r\nthe two pages, she was indirectly the means of doing them good, also; for,\r\nashamed of their bad reading, they commenced studying in earnest, till\r\nthey overcame the faults that had offended the King. Both finally rose to\r\ndistinction, one as a lawyer, and the other as a statesman; and they owed\r\ntheir advancement in life chiefly to their good elocution.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Pe-ti\'tion, a formal request. 3. Ar-tic\'u-late, to utter\r\nthe elementary sounds. Mod\'u-late, to vary or inflect. Mo-not\'o-ny, lack\r\nof variety. 4. Af-fect\'ed, unnatural and silly. 9.

He was\r\ndistinguished for his military exploits, for his wise and just government,\r\nand for his literary attainments. He wrote many able works in the French\r\nlanguage. Many pleasant anecdotes are told of this king, of which the one\r\ngiven in the lesson is a fair sample.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE BLUEBELL.\r\n\r\n1.  There is a story I have heard--\r\n    A poet learned it of a bird,\r\n    And kept its music every word--\r\n\r\n2.  A story of a dim ravine,\r\n    O\'er which the towering tree tops lean,\r\n    With one blue rift of sky between;\r\n\r\n3.  And there, two thousand years ago,\r\n    A little flower as white as snow\r\n    Swayed in the silence to and fro.\r\n\r\n4.  Day after day, with longing eye,\r\n    The floweret watched the narrow sky,\r\n    And fleecy clouds that floated by.\r\n\r\n5.  And through the darkness, night by night,\r\n    One gleaming star would climb the height,\r\n    And cheer the lonely floweret\'s sight.\r\n\r\n6.  Thus, watching the blue heavens afar,\r\n    And the rising of its favorite star,\r\n    A slow change came--but not to mar;\r\n\r\n7.  For softly o\'er its petals white\r\n    There crept a blueness, like the light\r\n    Of skies upon a summer night;\r\n\r\n8.  And in its chalice, I am told,\r\n    The bonny bell was formed to hold\r\n    A tiny star that gleamed like gold.\r\n\r\n9.  Now, little people, sweet and true,\r\n    I find a lesson here for you\r\n    Writ in the floweret\'s hell of blue:\r\n\r\n10. The patient child whose watchful eye\r\n    Strives after all things pure and high,\r\n    Shall take their image by and by.\r\n\r\n\r\n DEFINITIONS.--2. Rift, a narrow opening, a cleft. 3. Swayed, swung. 5.\r\n Height (pro. hite), an elevated place. 7. Pet\'als, the colored leaves of\r\n a flower. 8. Chal\'ice, a cup or bowl. Bon\'ny, beautiful.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. THE GENTLE HAND.\r\n\r\nTimothy S. Arthur (b. 1809, d. 1885) was born near Newburgh, N.Y., but\r\npassed most of his life at Baltimore and Philadelphia. His opportunities\r\nfor good schooling were quite limited, and he may be considered a\r\nself-educated man. He was the author of more than a hundred volumes,\r\nprincipally novels of a domestic and moral tone, and of many shorter\r\ntales--magazine articles, etc. "Ten Nights in a Barroom," and "Three Years\r\nin a Mantrap," are among his best known works.\r\n\r\n1. When and where it matters not now to relate--but once upon a time, as I\r\nwas passing through a thinly peopled district of country, night came down\r\nupon me almost unawares. Being on foot, I could not hope to gain the\r\nvillage toward which my steps were directed, until a late hour; and I\r\ntherefore preferred seeking shelter and a night\'s lodging at the first\r\nhumble dwelling that presented itself.\r\n\r\n2. Dusky twilight was giving place to deeper shadows, when I found myself\r\nin the vicinity of a dwelling, from the small uncurtained windows of which\r\nthe light shone with a pleasant promise of good cheer and comfort. The\r\nhouse stood within an inclosure, and a short distance from the road along\r\nwhich I was moving with wearied feet.\r\n\r\n3. Turning aside, and passing through the ill-hung gate, I approached the\r\ndwelling. Slowly the gate swung on its wooden hinges, and the rattle of\r\nits latch, in closing, did not disturb the air until I had nearly reached\r\nthe porch in front of the house, in which a slender girl, who had noticed\r\nmy entrance, stood awaiting my arrival.\r\n\r\n4. A deep, quick bark answered, almost like an echo, the sound of the\r\nshutting gate, and, sudden as an apparition, the form of an immense dog\r\nloomed in the doorway. At the instant when he was about to spring, a light\r\nhand was laid upon his shaggy neck, and a low word spoken.\r\n\r\n5. "Go in, Tiger," said the girl, not in a voice of authority, yet in her\r\ngentle tones was the consciousness that she would be obeyed; and, as she\r\nspoke, she lightly bore upon the animal with her hand, and he turned away\r\nand disappeared within the dwelling.\r\n\r\n6. "Who\'s that?" A rough voice asked the question; and now a heavy-looking\r\nman took the dog\'s place in the door.\r\n\r\n7. "How far is it to G--?" I asked, not deeming it best to say, in the\r\nbeginning, that I sought a resting place for the night.\r\n\r\n8. "To G--!" growled the man, but not so harshly as at first. "It\'s good\r\nsix miles from here."\r\n\r\n9. "A long distance; and I\'m a stranger and on foot," said I. "If you can\r\nmake room for me until morning, I will be very thankful."\r\n\r\n10. I saw the girl\'s hand move quickly up his arm, until it rested on his\r\nshoulder, and now she leaned to him still closer.\r\n\r\n11. "Come in. We\'ll try what can be done for you." There was a change in\r\nthe man\'s voice that made me wonder. I entered a large room, in which\r\nblazed a brisk fire. Before the fire sat two stout lads, who turned upon\r\nme their heavy eyes, with no very welcome greeting. A middle-aged woman\r\nwas standing at a table, and two children were amusing themselves with a\r\nkitten on the floor.\r\n\r\n12. "A stranger, mother," said the man who had given me so rude a greeting\r\nat the door; "and he wants us to let him stay all night."\r\n\r\n13. The woman looked at me doubtingly for a few moments, and then replied\r\ncoldly, "We don\'t keep a public house."\r\n\r\n14. "I\'m aware of that, ma\'am," said I; "but night has overtaken me, and\r\nit\'s a long way yet to G--."\r\n\r\n15. "Too far for a tired man to go on foot," said the master of the house,\r\nkindly, "so it\'s no use talking about it, mother; we must give him a bed."\r\n\r\n\r\n16. So unobtrusively that I scarce noticed the movement, the girl had\r\ndrawn to her mother\'s side. What she said to her I did not hear, for the\r\nbrief words were uttered in a low voice; but I noticed, as she spoke, one\r\nsmall, fair hand rested on the woman\'s hand.\r\n\r\n17. Was there magic in that touch? The woman\'s repulsive aspect changed\r\ninto one of kindly welcome, and she said, "Yes, it\'s a long way to G--. I\r\nguess we can find a place for him."\r\n\r\n18. Many times more during that evening, did I observe the magic power of\r\nthat hand and voice--the one gentle yet potent as the other. On the next\r\nmorning, breakfast being over, I was preparing to take my departure when\r\nmy host informed me that if I would wait for half an hour he would give me\r\na ride in his wagon to G--, as business required him to go there. I was\r\nvery well pleased to accept of the invitation.\r\n\r\n19. In due time, the farmer\'s wagon was driven into the road before the\r\nhouse, and I was invited to get in. I noticed the horse as a rough-looking\r\nCanadian pony, with a certain air of stubborn endurance. As the farmer\r\ntook his seat by my side, the family came to the door to see us off.\r\n\r\n20. "Dick!" said the farmer in a peremptory voice, giving the rein a quick\r\njerk as he spoke. But Dick moved not a step. "Dick! you vagabond! get up."\r\nAnd the farmer\'s whip cracked sharply by the pony\'s ear.\r\n\r\n21. It availed not, however, this second appeal. Dick stood firmly\r\ndisobedient. Next the whip was brought down upon him with an impatient\r\nhand; but the pony only reared up a little. Fast and sharp the strokes\r\nwere next dealt to the number of half a dozen. The man might as well have\r\nbeaten the wagon, for all his end was gained.\r\n\r\n22. A stout lad now came out into the road, and, catching Dick by the\r\nbridle, jerked him forward, using, at the same time, the customary\r\nlanguage on such occasions, but Dick met this new ally with increased\r\nstubbornness, planting his fore feet more firmly and at a sharper angle\r\nwith the ground.\r\n\r\n23. The impatient boy now struck the pony on the side of the head with his\r\nclinched hand, and jerked cruelly at his bridle. It availed nothing,\r\nhowever; Dick was not to be wrought upon by any such arguments.\r\n\r\n24. "Don\'t do so, John!" I turned my head as the maiden\'s sweet voice\r\nreached my ear. She was passing through the gate into the road, and in the\r\nnext moment had taken hold of the lad and drawn him away from the animal.\r\nNo strength was exerted in this; she took hold of his arm, and he obeyed\r\nher wish as readily as if he had no thought beyond her gratification.\r\n\r\n25. And now that soft hand was laid gently on the pony\'s neck, and a\r\nsingle low word spoken. How instantly were the tense muscles relaxed--how\r\nquickly the stubborn air vanished!\r\n\r\n26. "Poor Dick!" said the maiden, as she stroked his neck lightly, or\r\nsoftly patted it with a childlike hand. "Now, go along, you provoking\r\nfellow!" she added, in a half-chiding, yet affectionate voice, as she drew\r\nup the bridle.\r\n\r\n27. The pony turned toward her, and rubbed his head against her arm for an\r\ninstant or two; then, pricking up his ears, he started off at a light,\r\ncheerful trot, and went on his way as freely as if no silly crotchet had\r\never entered his stubborn brain.\r\n\r\n28. "What a wonderful power that hand possesses!" said I, speaking to my\r\ncompanion, as we rode away.\r\n\r\n29. He looked at me for a moment, as if my remark had occasioned surprise.\r\nThen a light came into his countenance, and he said briefly, "She\'s good!\r\nEverybody and everything loves her."\r\n\r\n30. Was that, indeed, the secret of her power? Was the quality of her soul\r\nperceived in the impression of her hand, even by brute beasts! The\r\nfather\'s explanation was doubtless the true one. Yet have I ever since\r\nwondered, and still do wonder, at the potency which lay in that maiden\'s\r\nmagic touch. I have seen something of the same power, showing itself in\r\nthe loving and the good, but never to the extent as instanced in her,\r\nwhom, for want of a better name, I must still call "Gentle Hand."\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--2.

Eastman (b. 1816, d.1861) was born in Maine, but removed at an\r\nearly age to Vermont, where he was connected with the press at Burlington,\r\nWoodstock, and Montpelier. He published a volume of poems in 1848, written\r\nin a happy lyric and ballad style, and faithfully portraying rural life in\r\nNew England.\r\n\r\n1. The farmer sat in his easy-chair\r\n     Smoking his pipe of clay,\r\n   While his hale old wife with busy care,\r\n     Was clearing the dinner away;\r\n   A sweet little girl with fine blue eyes,\r\n   On her grandfather\'s knee, was catching flies.\r\n\r\n2. The old man laid his hand on her head,\r\n     With a tear on his wrinkled face,\r\n   He thought how often her mother, dead,\r\n     Had sat in the selfsame place;\r\n   As the tear stole down from his half-shut eye,\r\n   "Don\'t smoke!" said the child, "how it makes you cry!"\r\n\r\n3. The house dog lay stretched out on the floor,\r\n     Where the shade, afternoons, used to steal;\r\n   The busy old wife by the open door\r\n     Was turning the spinning wheel,\r\n   And the old brass clock on the manteltree\r\n   Had plodded along to almost three.\r\n\r\n4. Still the farmer sat in his easy-chair,\r\n     While close to his heaving breast\r\n   The moistened brow and the cheek so fair\r\n     Of his sweet grandchild were pressed;\r\n   His head bent down, all her soft hair lay;\r\n   Fast asleep were they both on that summer day.\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Hale, healthy. 3. Man\'tel-tree, shelf over a fireplace.\r\nPlod\'ded, went slowly. 4. Heaving, rising and falling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. A BOY ON A FARM.\r\n\r\nCharles Dudley Warner (b. 1829,--) was born at Plainfield, Mass. In 1851\r\nhe graduated at Hamilton College, and in 1856 was admitted to the bar at\r\nPhiladelphia, but moved to Chicago to practice his profession. There he\r\nremained until 1860, when he became connected with the press at Hartford,\r\nConn., and has ever since devoted himself to literature. "My Summer in a\r\nGarden," "Saunterings," and "Backlog Studies" are his best known works.\r\nThe following extract is from "Being a Boy."\r\n\r\n1. Say what you will about the general usefulness of boys, it is my\r\nimpression that a farm without a boy would very soon come to grief. What\r\nthe boy does is the life of the farm. He is the factotum, always in\r\ndemand, always expected to do the thousand indispensable things that\r\nnobody else will do. Upon him fall all the odds and ends, the most\r\ndifficult things.\r\n\r\n2. After everybody else is through, he has to finish up. His work is like\r\na woman\'s,--perpetually waiting on others. Everybody knows how much easier\r\nit is to eat a good dinner than it is to wash the dishes afterwards.\r\nConsider what a boy on a farm is required to do,--things that must be\r\ndone, or life would actually stop.\r\n\r\n3. It is understood, in the first place, that he is to do all the errands,\r\nto go to the store, to the post office, and to carry all sorts of\r\nmessages. If he had as many legs as a centiped, they would tire before\r\nnight. His two short limbs seem to him entirely inadequate to the task. He\r\nwould like to have as many legs as a wheel has spokes, and rotate about in\r\nthe same way.\r\n\r\n4. This he sometimes tries to do; and the people who have seen him\r\n"turning cart wheels" along the side of the road, have supposed that he\r\nwas amusing himself and idling his time; he was only trying to invent a\r\nnew mode of locomotion, so that he could economize his legs, and do his\r\nerrands with greater dispatch.\r\n\r\n5. He practices standing on his head, in order to accustom himself to any\r\nposition. Leapfrog is one of his methods of getting over the ground\r\nquickly. He would willingly go an errand any distance if he could leapfrog\r\nit with a few other boys.\r\n\r\n6. He has a natural genius for combining pleasure with business. This is\r\nthe reason why, when he is sent to the spring for a pitcher of water, he\r\nis absent so long; for he stops to poke the frog that sits on the stone,\r\nor, if there is a penstock, to put his hand over the spout, and squirt the\r\nwater a little while.\r\n\r\n7. He is the one who spreads the grass when the men have cut it; he mows\r\nit away in the barn; he rides the horse, to cultivate the corn, up and\r\ndown the hot, weary rows; he picks up the potatoes when they are dug; he\r\ndrives the cows night and morning; he brings wood and water, and splits\r\nkindling; he gets up the horse, and puts out the horse; whether he is in\r\nthe house or out of it, there is always something for him to do.\r\n\r\n8. Just before the school in winter he shovels paths; in summer he turns\r\nthe grindstone. He knows where there are lots of wintergreens and sweet\r\nflags, but instead of going for them, he is to stay indoors and pare\r\napples, and stone raisins, and pound something in a mortar. And yet, with\r\nhis mind full of schemes of what he would like to do, and his hands full\r\nof occupations, he is an idle boy, who has nothing to busy himself with\r\nbut school and chores!\r\n\r\n9. He would gladly do all the work if somebody else would do the chores,\r\nhe thinks; and yet I doubt if any boy ever amounted to anything in the\r\nworld, or was of much use as a man, who did not enjoy the advantages of a\r\nliberal education in the way of chores.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Fac-to\'tum, a person employed to do all kinds of work.\r\nIn-dis-pen\'sa-ble, absolutely necessary. 2. Per-pet\'u-al-ly, continually.\r\n3. Cen\'ti-ped, an insect with a great number of feet. 4. E-con\'o-mize, to\r\nsave. Dis-patch\', diligence, haste. 6. Pen\'-stock, a wooden tube for\r\nconducting water. 8. Chores, the light work of the household either within\r\nor without doors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. THE SINGING LESSON.\r\n\r\nJean Ingelow (b. 1830, d.1897) was born at Boston, Lincolnshire, England.\r\nHer fame as a poetess was at once established upon the publication of her\r\n"Poems" in 1863; since which time several other volumes have appeared. The\r\nmost generally admired of her poems are "Songs of Seven" and "The High\r\nTide on the Coast of Lincolnshire," She has also written several\r\nsuccessful novels, of which, "Off the Skelligs" is the most popular.\r\n"Stories Told to a Child," "The Cumberers," "Poor Mat," "Studies for\r\nStories," and "Mopsa, the Fairy" are also well known. Miss Ingelow resided\r\nin London, England, and spent much of her time in deeds of charity.\r\n\r\n1. A nightingale made a mistake;\r\n     She sang a few notes out of tune:\r\n   Her heart was ready to break,\r\n     And she hid away from the moon.\r\n   She wrung her claws, poor thing,\r\n     But was far too proud to weep;\r\n   She tucked her head under her wing,\r\n     And pretended to be asleep.\r\n\r\n2. A lark, arm in arm with a thrush,\r\n     Came sauntering up to the place;\r\n   The nightingale felt herself blush,\r\n     Though feathers hid her face;\r\n   She knew they had heard her song,\r\n     She felt them snicker and sneer;\r\n   She thought that life was too long,\r\n     And wished she could skip a year.\r\n\r\n3. "O nightingale!" cooed a dove;\r\n     "O nightingale! what\'s the use?\r\n   You bird of beauty and love,\r\n     Why behave like a goose?\r\n   Don\'t sulk away from our sight,\r\n     Like a common, contemptible fowl;\r\n   You bird of joy and delight,\r\n     Why behave like an owl?\r\n\r\n4. "Only think of all you have done;\r\n     Only think of all you can do;\r\n   A false note is really fun\r\n     From such a bird as you!\r\n   Lift up your proud little crest,\r\n     Open your musical beak;\r\n   Other birds have to do their best,\r\n     You need only to speak!"\r\n\r\n6. The nightingale shyly took\r\n     Her head from under her wing,\r\n   And, giving the dove a look,\r\n     Straightway began to sing.\r\n   There was never a bird could pass;\r\n     The night was divinely calm;\r\n   And the people stood on the grass\r\n     To hear that wonderful psalm.\r\n\r\n6. The nightingale did not care,\r\n     She only sang to the skies;\r\n   Her song ascended there,\r\n     And there she fixed her eyes.\r\n   The people that stood below\r\n     She knew but little about;\r\n   And this tale has a moral, I know,\r\n     If you\'ll try and find it out.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--2. Saun\'ter-ing, wandering idly, strolling. Snick\'er, to\r\nlaugh in a half-suppressed manner. 4. Crest, a tuft growing on an animal\'s\r\nhead. 5. Di-vine\'ly, in a supreme degree. 6. Mor\'al, the practical lesson\r\nwhich anything is fitted to teach.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--The nightingale is a small bird, about six inches in length, with a\r\ncoat of dark-brown feathers above and of grayish, white beneath. Its voice\r\nis astonishingly strong and sweet, and, when wild, it usually sings\r\nthroughout the evening and night from April to the middle of summer. The\r\nbird is common in Europe, but is not found in America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. DO NOT MEDDLE.\r\n\r\n1. About twenty years ago there lived a singular gentleman in the Old Hall\r\namong the elm trees. He was about three-score years of age, very rich, and\r\nsomewhat odd in many of his habits, but for generosity and benevolence he\r\nhad no equal.\r\n\r\n2. No poor cottager stood in need of comforts, which he was not ready to\r\nsupply; no sick man or woman languished for want of his assistance; and\r\nnot even a beggar, unless a known impostor, went empty-handed from the\r\nHall. Like the village pastor described in Goldsmith\'s poem of "The\r\nDeserted Village,"\r\n\r\n  "His house was known to all the vagrant train;\r\n  He chid their wand\'rings, but relieved their pain;\r\n  The long-remembered beggar was his guest,\r\n  Whose beard descending swept his aged breast."\r\n\r\n3. Now it happened that the old gentleman wanted a boy to wait upon him at\r\ntable, and to attend him in different ways, for he was very fond of young\r\npeople. But much as he liked the society of the young, he had a great\r\naversion to that curiosity in which many young people are apt to indulge.\r\nHe used to say, "The boy who will peep into a drawer will be tempted to\r\ntake something out of it; and he who will steal a penny in his youth will\r\nsteal a pound in his manhood."\r\n\r\n4. No sooner was it known that the old gentleman was in want of a boy than\r\ntwenty applications were made for the situation; but he determined not to\r\nengage anyone until he had in some way ascertained that he did not possess\r\na curious, prying disposition.\r\n\r\n5. On Monday morning seven lads, dressed in their Sunday clothes, with\r\nbright and happy faces, made their appearance at the Hall, each of them\r\ndesiring to obtain the situation. Now the old gentleman, being of a\r\nsingular disposition had prepared a room in such a way that he might\r\neasily know if any of the young people who applied were given to meddle\r\nunnecessarily with things around them, or to peep into cupboards and\r\ndrawers. He took care that the lads who were then at Elm Tree Hall should\r\nbe shown into this room one after another.\r\n\r\n6. And first, Charles Brown was sent into the room, and told that he would\r\nhave to wait a little. So Charles sat down on a chair near the door. For\r\nsome time he was very quiet, and looked about him; but there seemed to be\r\nso many curious things in the room that at last he got up to peep at\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n7. On the table was placed a dish cover, and Charles wanted sadly to know\r\nwhat was under it, but he felt afraid of lifting it up. Bad habits are\r\nstrong things; and, as Charles was of a curious disposition, he could not\r\nwithstand the temptation of taking one peep. So he lifted up the cover.\r\n\r\n8. This turned out to be a sad affair; for under the dish cover was a heap\r\nof very light feathers; part of the feathers, drawn up by a current of\r\nair, flew about the room, and Charles, in his fright, putting the cover\r\ndown hastily, puffed the rest of them off the table.\r\n\r\n9. What was to be done? Charles began to pick up the feathers one by one;\r\nbut the old gentleman, who was in an adjoining room, hearing a scuffle,\r\nand guessing the cause of it, entered the room, to the consternation of\r\nCharles Brown, who was very soon dismissed as a boy who had not principle\r\nenough to resist even a slight temptation.\r\n\r\n10. When the room was once more arranged, Henry Wilkins was placed there\r\nuntil such time as he should be sent for. No sooner was he left to himself\r\nthan his attention was attracted by a plate of fine, ripe cherries. Now\r\nHenry was uncommonly fond of cherries, and he thought it would be\r\nimpossible to miss one cherry among so many. He looked and longed, and\r\nlonged and looked, for some time, and just as he had got off his seat to\r\ntake one, he heard, as he thought, a foot coming to the door; but no, it\r\nwas a false alarm.\r\n\r\n11. Taking fresh courage, he went cautiously and took a very fine cherry,\r\nfor he was determined to take but one, and put it into his mouth. It was\r\nexcellent; and then he persuaded himself that he ran no risk in taking\r\nanother; this he did, and hastily popped it into his mouth.\r\n\r\n12. Now, the old gentleman had placed a few artificial cherries at the top\r\nof the others, filled with Cayenne pepper; one of these Henry had\r\nunfortunately taken, and it made his month smart and burn most\r\nintolerably. The old gentleman heard him coughing, and knew very well what\r\nwas the matter. The boy that would take what did not belong to him, if no\r\nmore than a cherry, was not the boy for him. Henry Wilkins was sent about\r\nhis business without delay, with his mouth almost as hot as if he had put\r\na burning coal in to it.\r\n\r\n13. Rufus Wilson was next introduced into the room and left to himself;\r\nbut he had not been there ten minutes before he began to move from one\r\nplace to another. He was of a bold, resolute temper, but not overburdened\r\nwith principle; for if he could have opened every cupboard, closet, and\r\ndrawer in the house, without being found out, he would have done it\r\ndirectly.\r\n\r\n14. Having looked around the room, he noticed a drawer to the table, and\r\nmade up his mind to peep therein. But no sooner did he lay hold of the\r\ndrawer knob than he set a large bell ringing, which was concealed under\r\nthe table. The old gentleman immediately answered the summons, and entered\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\n15. Rufus was so startled by the sudden ringing of the bell, that all his\r\nimpudence could not support him. He looked as though anyone might knock\r\nhim down with a feather. The old gentleman asked him if he had rung the\r\nbell because he wanted anything. Rufus was much confused and stammered,\r\nand tried to excuse himself, but all to no purpose, for it did not prevent\r\nhim from being ordered off the premises.\r\n\r\n16. George Jones was then shown into the room by an old steward; and being\r\nof a cautious disposition, he touched nothing, but only looked at the\r\nthings about him. At last he saw that a closet door was a little open,\r\nand, thinking it would be impossible for anyone to know that he had opened\r\nit a little more, he very cautiously opened it an inch farther, looking\r\ndown at the bottom of the door, that it might not catch against anything\r\nand make a noise.\r\n\r\n17. Now had he looked at the top, instead of the bottom, it\r\nmight have been better for him; for to the top of the door was\r\nfastened a plug, which filled up the hole of a small barrel of shot.\r\nHe ventured to open the door another inch, and then another, till,\r\nthe plug being pulled out of the barrel, the leaden shot began to\r\npour out at a strange rate. At the bottom of the closet was placed a\r\ntin pan, and the shot falling upon this pan made such a clatter that\r\nGeorge was frightened half out of his senses.\r\n\r\n18. The old gentleman soon came into the room to inquire what was the\r\nmatter, and there he found George nearly as pale as a sheet. George was\r\nsoon dismissed.\r\n\r\n19. It now came the turn of Albert Jenkins to be put into the room. The\r\nother boys had been sent to their homes by different ways, and no one knew\r\nwhat the experience of the other had been in the room of trial.\r\n\r\n20. On the table stood a small round box, with a screw top to it, and\r\nAlbert, thinking it contained something curious, could not be easy without\r\nunscrewing the top; but no sooner did he do this than out bounced an\r\nartificial snake, full a yard long, and fell upon his arm. He started\r\nback, and uttered a scream which brought the old gentleman to his elbow.\r\nThere stood Albert, with the bottom of the box in one hand, the top in the\r\nother, and the snake on the floor.\r\n\r\n21. "Come, come," said the old gentleman, "one snake is quite enough to\r\nhave in the house at a time; therefore, the sooner you are gone the\r\nbetter." With that he dismissed him, without waiting a moment for his\r\nreply.\r\n\r\n22. William Smith next entered the room, and being left alone soon began\r\nto amuse himself in looking at the curiosities around him. William was not\r\nonly curious and prying, but dishonest, too, and observing that the key\r\nwas left in the drawer of a bookcase, he stepped on tiptoe in that\r\ndirection. The key had a wire fastened to it, which communicated with an\r\nelectrical machine, and William received such a shock as he was not likely\r\nto forget. No sooner did he sufficiently recover himself to walk, than he\r\nwas told to leave the house, and let other people lock and unlock their\r\nown drawers.\r\n\r\n23. The other boy was Harry Gordon, and though he was left in the room\r\nfull twenty minutes, he never during that time stirred from his chair.\r\nHarry had eyes in his head as well as the others, but he had more\r\nintegrity in his heart; neither the dish cover, the cherries, the drawer\r\nknob, the closet door, the round box, nor the key tempted him to rise from\r\nhis feet; and the consequence was that, in half an hour after, he was\r\nengaged in the service of the old gentleman at Elm Tree Hall. He followed\r\nhis good old master to his grave, and received a large legacy for his\r\nupright conduct in his service.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--2. Lan\'guished, suffered, sank away. Im-pos\'. tor, a\r\ndeceiver. 3. A-ver\'sion, dislike. In-dulge\', to give way to. Pound, a\r\nBritish denomination of money equal in value to about $4.86. 4.\r\nAp-pli-ca\'tion, the act of making a request. 9. Con--ster-na\'tion,\r\nexcessive terror, dismay. Prin\'ci-ple, a right rule of conduct. 12.\r\nAr-ti-fi\'cial (pro. ar-ti-fish\'al), made by art, not real.\r\nIn-tol\'er-a-bly, in a manner not to be borne. 14. Sum\'mons, a call to\r\nappear. 19.

WORK.\r\n\r\nEliza Cook (b. 1817, d. 1889) was born at London. In 1837 she commenced\r\ncontributing to periodicals. In 1840 the first collection of her poems was\r\nmade. In 1849 she became editor of "Eliza Cook\'s Journal."\r\n\r\n1. Work, work, my boy, be not afraid;\r\n     Look labor boldly in the face;\r\n   Take up the hammer or the spade,\r\n     And blush not for your humble place.\r\n\r\n2. There\'s glory in the shuttle\'s song;\r\n     There\'s triumph in the anvil\'s stroke;\r\n   There\'s merit in the brave and strong\r\n     Who dig the mine or fell the oak.\r\n\r\n3. The wind disturbs the sleeping lake,\r\n     And bids it ripple pure and fresh;\r\n   It moves the green boughs till they make\r\n     Grand music in their leafy mesh.\r\n\r\n4. And so the active breath of life\r\n     Should stir our dull and sluggard wills;\r\n   For are we not created rife\r\n     With health, that stagnant torpor kills?\r\n\r\n5. I doubt if he who lolls his head\r\n     Where idleness and plenty meet,\r\n   Enjoys his pillow or his bread\r\n     As those who earn the meals they eat.\r\n\r\n6. And man is never half so blest\r\n     As when the busy day is spent\r\n   So as to make his evening rest\r\n     A holiday of glad content.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--3. Mesh, network. 4. Rife, abounding. Stag\'nant, inactive.\r\n2. Tor\'por, laziness, stupidity. 5. Lolls, reclines, leans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. THE MANIAC.\r\n\r\n1. A gentleman who had traveled in Europe, relates that he one day visited\r\nthe hospital of Berlin, where he saw a man whose exterior was very\r\nstriking. His figure, tall and commanding, was bending with age, but more\r\nwith sorrow; the few scattered hairs which remained on his temples were\r\nwhite almost as the driven snow, and the deepest melancholy was depicted\r\nin his countenance.\r\n\r\n2. On inquiring who he was and what brought him there, he started, as, if\r\nfrom sleep, and, after looking around him, began with slow and measured\r\nsteps to stride the hall, repeating in a low but audible voice, "Once one\r\nis two; once one is two."\r\n\r\n3. Now and then he would stop, and remain with his arms folded on his\r\nbreast as if in contemplation, for some minutes; then again resuming his\r\nwalk, he continued to repeat, "Once one is two; once one is two." His\r\nstory, as our traveler understood it, is as follows:\r\n\r\n4. Conrad Lange, collector of the revenues of the city of Berlin, had long\r\nbeen known as a man whom nothing could divert from the paths of honesty.\r\nScrupulously exact in an his dealings, and assiduous in the discharge of\r\nall his duties, he had acquired the good will and esteem of all who knew\r\nhim, and the confidence of the minister of finance, whose duty it is to\r\ninspect the accounts of all officers connected with the revenue.\r\n\r\n5. On casting up his accounts at the close of a particular year, he found\r\na deficit of ten thousand ducats. Alarmed at this discovery, he went to\r\nthe minister, presented his accounts, and informed him that he did not\r\nknow how it had arisen, and that he had been robbed by some person bent on\r\nhis ruin.\r\n\r\n6. The minister received his accounts, but thinking it a duty to secure a\r\nperson who might probably be a defaulter he caused him to be arrested, and\r\nput his accounts into the hands of one of his secretaries for inspection,\r\nwho returned them the day after with the information that the deficiency\r\narose from a miscalculation; that in multiplying, Mr. Lange had said, once\r\none is two, instead of once one is one.\r\n\r\n7. The poor man was immediately released from confinement, his accounts\r\nreturned, and the mistake pointed out. During his imprisonment, which\r\nlasted two days, he had neither eaten, drunk, nor taken any repose; and\r\nwhen he appeared, his countenance was as pale as death. On receiving his\r\naccounts, he was a long time silent; then suddenly awaking, as if from a\r\ntrance, he repeated, "Once one is two."\r\n\r\n8. He appeared to be entirely insensible of his situation; would neither\r\neat nor drink, unless solicited; and took notice of nothing that passed\r\naround him. While repeating his accustomed phrase, if anyone corrected him\r\nby saying, "Once one is one," his attention was arrested for a moment, and\r\nhe said, "Ah, right, once one is one;" and then resuming his walk, he\r\ncontinued to repeat, "Once one is two." He died shortly after the traveler\r\nleft Berlin.\r\n\r\n9. This affecting story, whether true or untrue, obviously abounds with\r\nlessons of instruction. Alas! how easily is the human mind thrown off its\r\nbalance; especially when it is stayed on this world only, and has no\r\nexperimental knowledge of the meaning of the injunction of Scripture, to\r\ncast all our cares upon Him who careth for us, and who heareth even the\r\nyoung ravens when they cry.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Ex-te\'ri-or, outward appearance. De-pict\'ed, painted,\r\nrepresented. 3. Con-tem-pla\'tion, continued attention of the mind to one\r\nsubject. 4. Rev\'e-nues, the annual income from taxes, public rents, etc.\r\nScru\'pu-lous-ly, carefully. As-sid\'u-ous, constant in attention.\r\nFi-nance\', the income of a ruler or a state. Def\'i-cit, lack, want.\r\nDuc\'at, a gold coin worth about $2.00. 6. De-fault\'er, one who fails to\r\naccount for public money intrusted to his care. 9. Ob\'vi-ous-ly, plainly.\r\nIn-junc\'tion, a command.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX. ROBIN REDBREAST.\r\n\r\nWilliam Allingham (b. 1828, d. 1889) was born at Ballyshannon, Ireland.\r\nHis father was a banker, and gave him a good education in Irish schools.\r\nHe showed his literary tastes at an early date, contributing to\r\nperiodicals, etc. In 1850 he published his first volume of poems; in 1854\r\nhis "Day and Night Songs" appeared, and in 1864 a poem in twelve chapters\r\nentitled "Lawrence Bloomfield in Ireland," His reputation was established\r\nchiefly through his shorter lyrics, or ballad poetry. In 1864 he received\r\na literary pension.\r\n\r\n1. Good-by, good-by to Summer!\r\n     For Summer\'s nearly done;\r\n   The garden smiling faintly,\r\n     Cool breezes in the sun;\r\n   Our thrushes now are silent,\r\n     Our swallows flown away,--\r\n   But Robin\'s here in coat of brown,\r\n     And scarlet brestknot gay.\r\n   Robin, Robin Redbreast,\r\n     O Robin dear!\r\n   Robin sings so sweetly\r\n     In the falling of the year.\r\n\r\n2. Bright yellow, red, and orange,\r\n     The leaves come down in hosts;\r\n   The trees are Indian princes,\r\n     But soon they\'ll turn to ghosts;\r\n   The leathery pears and apples\r\n     Hang russet on the bough;\r\n   It\'s autumn, autumn, autumn late,\r\n     \'T will soon be winter now.\r\n   Robin, Robin Redbreast,\r\n     O Robin dear!\r\n   And what will this poor Robin do?\r\n     For pinching days are near.\r\n\r\n3. The fireside for the cricket,\r\n     The wheat stack for the mouse,\r\n   When trembling night winds whistle\r\n     And moan all round the house.\r\n   The frosty ways like iron,\r\n     The branches plumed with snow,--\r\n   Alas! in winter dead and dark,\r\n     Where can poor Robin go?\r\n   Robin, Robin Redbreast,\r\n     O Robin dear!\r\n   And a crumb of bread for Robin,\r\n     His little heart to cheer.\r\n\r\nNote.--The Old World Robin here referred to is quite different in\r\nappearance and habits from the American Robin. It is only about half the\r\nsize of the latter. Its prevailing color above is olive green, while the\r\nforehead, cheeks, throat, and breast are a light yellowish red. It does\r\nnot migrate, but is found at all seasons throughout temperate Europe, Asia\r\nMinor, and northern Africa.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI. THE FISH I DID N\'T CATCH.\r\n\r\nJohn Greenleaf Whittier was born near Haverhill, Mass., in 1807, and died\r\nat Hampton Falls, N.H., in 1892. His boyhood was passed on a farm, and he\r\nnever received a classical education. In 1829 he edited a newspaper in\r\nBoston. In the following year he removed to Hartford, Conn., to assume a\r\nsimilar position. In 1836 he edited an antislavery paper in Philadelphia.\r\nIn 1840 he removed to Amesbury, Mass. Mr. Whittier\'s parents were Friends,\r\nand he always held to the same faith. He wrote extensively both in prose\r\nand verse. As a poet, he ranked among those most highly esteemed and\r\nhonored by his countrymen. "Snow Bound" is one of the longest and best of\r\nhis poems.\r\n\r\n1. Our bachelor uncle who lived with us was a quiet, genial man, much\r\ngiven to hunting and fishing; and it was one of the pleasures of our young\r\nlife to accompany him on his expeditions to Great Hill, Brandy-brow Woods,\r\nthe Pond, and, best of all, to the Country Brook. We were quite willing to\r\nwork hard in the cornfield or the haying lot to finish the necessary day\'s\r\nlabor in season for an afternoon stroll through the woods and along the\r\nbrookside.\r\n\r\n2. I remember my first fishing excursion as if it were but yesterday. I\r\nhave been happy many times in my life, but never more intensely so than\r\nwhen I received that first fishing pole from my uncle\'s hand, and trudged\r\noff with him through the woods and meadows. It was a still, sweet day of\r\nearly summer; the long afternoon shadows of the trees lay cool across our\r\npath; the leaves seemed greener, the flowers brighter, the birds merrier,\r\nthan ever before.\r\n\r\n3. My uncle, who knew by long experience where were the best haunts of\r\npickerel, considerately placed me at the most favorable point. I threw out\r\nmy line as I had so often seen others, and waited anxiously for a bite,\r\nmoving the bait in rapid jerks on the surface of the water in imitation of\r\nthe leap of a frog. Nothing came of it. "Try again," said my uncle.\r\nSuddenly the bait sank out of sight. "Now for it," thought I; "here is a\r\nfish at last."\r\n\r\n4. I made a strong pull, and brought up a tangle of weeds. Again and again\r\nI cast out my line with aching arms, and drew it back empty. I looked at\r\nmy uncle appealingly. "Try once more," he said; "we fishermen must have\r\npatience."\r\n\r\n5. Suddenly something tugged at my line, and swept off with it into deep\r\nwater. Jerking it up, I saw a fine pickerel wriggling in the sun. "Uncle!"\r\nI cried, looking back in uncontrollable excitement, "I\'ve got a fish!"\r\n"Not yet," said my uncle. As he spoke there was a plash in the water; I\r\ncaught the arrowy gleam of a scared fish shooting into the middle of the\r\nstream, my hook hung empty from the line. I had lost my prize.\r\n\r\n6. We are apt to speak of the sorrows of childhood as trifles in\r\ncomparison with those of grown-up people; but we may depend upon it the\r\nyoung folks don\'t agree with us. Our griefs, modified and restrained by\r\nreason, experience and self-respect, keep the proprieties, and, if\r\npossible, avoid a scene; but the sorrow of childhood, unreasoning and\r\nall-absorbing, is a complete abandonment to the passion. The doll\'s nose\r\nis broken, and the world breaks up with it; the marble rolls out of sight,\r\nand the solid globe rolls off with the marble.\r\n\r\n7. So, overcome with my great and bitter disappointment, I sat down on the\r\nnearest hassock, and for a time refused to be comforted, even by my\r\nuncle\'s assurance that there were more fish in the brook. He refitted my\r\nbait, and, putting the pole again in my hands, told me to try my luck once\r\nmore.\r\n\r\n8. "But remember, boy," he said, with his shrewd smile, "never brag of\r\ncatching a fish until he is on dry ground. I\'ve seen older folks doing\r\nthat in more ways than one, and so making fools of themselves. It\'s no use\r\nto boast of anything until it\'s done, nor then, either, for it speaks for\r\nitself."\r\n\r\n9. How often since I have been reminded of the fish that I did not catch.\r\nWhen I hear people boasting of a work as yet undone, and trying to\r\nanticipate the credit which belongs only to actual achievement, I call to\r\nmind that scene by the brookside, and the wise caution of my uncle in that\r\nparticular instance takes the form of a proverb of universal application:\r\n"NEVER BRAG OF YOUR FISH BEFORE YOU CATCH HIM."\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1.

IT SNOWS.\r\n\r\nSarah Josepha Hale (b. 1788?, d.1879) was born in Newport, N.H. Her maiden\r\nname was Buell. In 1814 she married David Hale, an eminent lawyer, who\r\ndied in 1822. Left with five children to support, she turned her attention\r\nto literature. In 1828 she became editor of the "Ladies\' Magazine." In\r\n1837 this periodical was united with "Godey\'s Lady\'s Book," of which Mrs.\r\nHale was literary editor for more than forty years.\r\n\r\n1. "It snows!" cries the Schoolboy, "Hurrah!" and his shout\r\n     Is ringing through parlor and hall,\r\n   While swift as the wing of a swallow, he\'s out,\r\n     And his playmates have answered his call;\r\n   It makes the heart leap but to witness their joy;\r\n     Proud wealth has no pleasures, I trow,\r\n   Like the rapture that throbs in the pulse of the boy\r\n     As he gathers his treasures of snow;\r\n   Then lay not the trappings of gold on thine heirs,\r\n     While health and the riches of nature are theirs.\r\n\r\n2. "It snows!" sighs the Imbecile, "Ah!" and his breath\r\n     Comes heavy, as clogged with a weight;\r\n   While, from the pale aspect of nature in death,\r\n     He turns to the blaze of his grate;\r\n   And nearer and nearer, his soft-cushioned chair\r\n     Is wheeled toward the life-giving flame;\r\n   He dreads a chill puff of the snow-burdened air,\r\n     Lest it wither his delicate frame;\r\n   Oh! small is the pleasure existence can give,\r\n     When the fear we shall die only proves that we live!\r\n\r\n3. "It snows!" cries the Traveler, "Ho!" and the word\r\n     Has quickened his steed\'s lagging pace;\r\n   The wind rushes by, but its howl is unheard,\r\n     Unfelt the sharp drift in his face;\r\n   For bright through the tempest his own home appeared,\r\n     Ay, though leagues intervened, he can see:\r\n   There\'s the clear, glowing hearth, and the table prepared,\r\n     And his wife with her babes at her knee;\r\n   Blest thought! how it lightens the grief-laden hour,\r\n     That those we love dearest are safe from its power!\r\n\r\n4. "It snows!" cries the Belle, "Dear, how lucky!" and turns\r\n     From her mirror to watch the flakes fall,\r\n   Like the first rose of summer, her dimpled cheek burns!\r\n     While musing on sleigh ride and ball:\r\n   There are visions of conquests, of splendor, and mirth,\r\n     Floating over each drear winter\'s day;\r\n   But the tintings of Hope, on this storm-beaten earth,\r\n     Will melt like the snowflakes away.\r\n   Turn, then thee to Heaven, fair maiden, for bliss;\r\n     That world has a pure fount ne\'er opened in this.\r\n\r\n5. "It snows!" cries the Widow, "O God!" and her sighs\r\n     Have stifled the voice of her prayer;\r\n   Its burden ye\'ll read in her tear-swollen eyes,\r\n     On her cheek sunk with fasting and care.\r\n   \'T is night, and her fatherless ask her for bread,\r\n     But "He gives the young ravens their food,"\r\n   And she trusts till her dark hearth adds horror to dread.,\r\n     And she lays on her last chip of wood.\r\n   Poor sufferer! that sorrow thy God only knows;\r\n     \'T is a most bitter lot to be poor when it snows.\r\n\r\n\r\n DEFINITIONS.--1.

In the city of Bath, not many years since, lived a barber who made a\r\npractice of following his ordinary occupation on the Lord\'s day. As he was\r\non the way to his morning\'s employment, he happened to look into some\r\nplace of worship just as the minister was giving out his text--"Remember\r\nthe Sabbath day, to keep it holy." He listened long enough to be convinced\r\nthat he was constantly breaking the laws of God and man by shaving and\r\ndressing his customers on the Lord\'s day. He became uneasy, and went with\r\na heavy heart to his Sabbath task.\r\n\r\n2. At length he took courage, and opened his mind to his minister, who\r\nadvised him to give up Sabbath work, and worship God. He replied that\r\nbeggary would be the consequence. He had a flourishing trade, but it would\r\nalmost all be lost. At length, after many a sleepless night spent in\r\nweeping and praying, he was determined to cast all his care upon God, as\r\nthe more he reflected, the more his duty became apparent.\r\n\r\n3. He discontinued his Sabbath work, went constantly and early to the\r\npublic services of religion, and soon enjoyed that satisfaction of mind\r\nwhich is one of the rewards of doing our duty, and that peace which the\r\nworld can neither give nor take away. The consequences he foresaw actually\r\nfollowed. His genteel customers left him, and he was nicknamed "Puritan"\r\nor "Methodist." He was obliged to give up his fashionable shop, and, in\r\nthe course of years, became so reduced as to take a cellar under the old\r\nmarket house and shave the poorer people.\r\n\r\n4. One Saturday evening, between light and dark, a stranger from one of\r\nthe coaches, asking for a barber, was directed by the hostler to the\r\ncellar opposite. Coming in hastily, he requested to be shaved quickly,\r\nwhile they changed horses, as he did not like to violate the Sabbath. This\r\nwas touching the barber on a tender chord. He burst into tears; asked the\r\nstranger to lend him a half-penny to buy a candle, as it was not light\r\nenough to shave him with safety. He did so, revolving in his mind the\r\nextreme poverty to which the poor man must be reduced.\r\n\r\n5. When shaved, he said, "There must be something extraordinary in your\r\nhistory, which I have not now time to hear. Here is half a crown for you.\r\nWhen I return, I will call and investigate your case. What is your name?"\r\n"William Reed," said the astonished barber. "William Reed?" echoed the\r\nstranger: "William Reed? by your dialect you are from the West." "Yes,\r\nsir, from Kingston, near Taunton." "William Reed from Kingston, near\r\nTaunton? What was your father\'s name?" "Thomas." "Had he any brother?"\r\n"Yes, sir, one, after whom I was named; but he went to the Indies, and, as\r\nwe never heard from him, we supposed him to be dead."\r\n\r\n6. "Come along, follow me," said the stranger, "I am going to see a person\r\nwho says his name is William Reed, of Kingston, near Taunton. Come and\r\nconfront him. If you prove to be indeed he who you say you are, I have\r\nglorious news for you. Your uncle is dead, and has left an immense\r\nfortune, which I will put you in possession of when all legal doubts are\r\nremoved."\r\n\r\n7. They went by the coach; saw the pretended William Reed, and proved him\r\nto be an impostor. The stranger, who was a pious attorney, was soon\r\nlegally satisfied of the barber\'s identity, and told him that he had\r\nadvertised him in vain. Providence had now thrown him in his way in a most\r\nextraordinary manner, and he had great pleasure in transferring a great\r\nmany thousand pounds to a worthy man, the rightful heir of the property.\r\nThus was man\'s extremity God\'s opportunity. Had the poor barber possessed\r\none half-penny, or even had credit for a candle, he might have remained\r\nunknown for years; but he trusted God, who never said, "Seek ye my face,"\r\nin vain.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--2.

THE SANDS O\' DEE.\r\n\r\nCharles Kingsley (b.1819, d.1875) was born at Holne, Devonshire, England.\r\nHe took his bachelor\'s degree at Cambridge in 1842, and soon after entered\r\nthe Church. His writings are quite voluminous, including sermons,\r\nlectures, novels, fairy tales, and poems, published in book form, besides\r\nnumerous miscellaneous sermons and magazine articles. He was an earnest\r\nworker for bettering the condition of the working classes, and this object\r\nwas the basis of most of his writings. As a lyric poet he has gained a\r\nhigh place. The "Saint\'s Tragedy" and "Andromeda" are the most pretentious\r\nof his poems, and "Alton Locke" and "Hypatia" are his best known novels.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. "O Mary, go and call the cattle home,\r\n       And call the cattle home,\r\n       And call the cattle home,\r\n     Across the sands o\' Dee!"\r\n   The western wind was wild and dank with foam,\r\n     And all alone went she.\r\n\r\n2. The creeping tide came up along the sand,\r\n       And o\'er and o\'er the sand,\r\n       And round and round the sand,\r\n     As far as eye could see;\r\n   The blinding mist came down and hid the land--\r\n     And never home came she.\r\n\r\n3. Oh, is it weed, or fish, or floating hair?--\r\n       A tress o\' golden hair,\r\n       O\' drowned maiden\'s hair,\r\n     Above the nets at sea.\r\n   Was never salmon yet that shone so fair\r\n     Among the stakes on Dee.\r\n\r\n4. They rowed her in across the rolling foam,\r\n       The cruel, crawling foam,\r\n       The cruel, hungry foam,\r\n     To her grave beside the sea;\r\n   But still the boatmen hear her call the cattle home,\r\n     Across the sands O\' Dee.\r\n\r\nNotes.--The Sands O\' Dee.\r\n        The Dee is a river of Scotland, noted for its salmon fisheries.\r\n        O\' is a contraction for of, commonly used by the Scotch.\r\n\r\nRKMARK.--The first three lines of each stanza deserve special attention in\r\nreading. The final words are nearly or quite the same, but the expression\r\nof each line should vary. The piece should be read in a low key and with a\r\npure, musical tone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV. SELECT PARAGRAPHS.\r\n\r\n1. O give thanks unto the Lord; call upon his name; make known his deeds\r\namong the people. Sing unto him; sing psalms unto him; talk ye of all his\r\nwondrous works. Glory ye in his holy name; let the heart of them rejoice\r\nthat seek the Lord. Remember his marvelous works that he hath done; his\r\nwonders, and the judgments of his mouth.\r\n\r\n2. O Lord, our Lord, how excellent is thy name in all the earth! who hast\r\nset thy glory above the heavens. When I consider thy heavens, the work of\r\nthy fingers; the moon and the stars which thou hast ordained; what is man,\r\nthat thou art mindful of him? and the son of man, that thou visitest him?\r\nFor thou hast made him a little lower than the angels, and hast crowned\r\nhim with glory and honor. Thou madest him to have dominion over the work\r\nof thy hands; thou hast put all things under his feet. O Lord, our Lord,\r\nhow excellent is thy name in all the earth!\r\n\r\n3. I will say of the Lord, He is my refuge and my fortress, my God; in him\r\nwill I trust. Because he hath set his love upon me, therefore will I\r\ndeliver him: I will set him on high, because he hath known my name. He\r\nshall call upon me, and I will answer him; I will be with him in trouble;\r\nI will deliver him, and honor him. With long life will I satisfy him, and\r\nshow him my salvation.\r\n\r\n4. O come, let us sing unto the Lord, let us heartily rejoice in the\r\nstrength of our salvation. Let us come before his presence with\r\nthanksgiving, and show ourselves glad in him with psalms. For the Lord is\r\na great God, and a great King above all gods. O worship the Lord in the\r\nbeauty of holiness; let the whole earth stand in awe of him. For he\r\ncometh, for he cometh, to judge the earth; and with righteousness to judge\r\nthe world, and the people with his truth.\r\n\r\n5. Oh that men would praise the Lord\' for his goodness, and for his\r\nwonderful works to the children of men! They that go down to the sea in\r\nships, that do business in great waters; these see the works of the Lord,\r\nand  his wonders in the deep. For he commandeth, and raiseth the stormy\r\nwind, which lifteth up the waves thereof. They mount up to the heaven;\r\nthey go down again to the depths; their soul is melted because of trouble;\r\nthey reel to and fro, and stagger like a drunken man, and are at their\r\nwit\'s end. Then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble, and he bringeth\r\nthem out of their distresses. He maketh the storm a calm, so that the\r\nwaves thereof are still. Then are they glad because they be quiet; so he\r\nbringeth them unto their desired haven. Oh that men would praise the Lord\r\nfor his goodness, and for his wonderful works to the children of men!\r\n\r\n6. The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in\r\ngreen pastures; he leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my\r\nsoul; he leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for his name\'s sake.\r\nYea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear\r\nno evil; for thou art with me: thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.\r\nThou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies; thou\r\nanointest my head with oil; my cup runneth over. Surely, goodness and\r\nmercy shall follow me all the days of my life; and I1 will dwell in the\r\nhouse of the Lord forever.\r\n                                                              --Bible.\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1.

THE CORN SONG.\r\n\r\n1. Heap high the farmer\'s wintry hoard!\r\n     Heap high the golden corn!\r\n   No richer gift has Autumn poured\r\n     From out her lavish horn!\r\n\r\n2. Let other lands, exulting, glean\r\n     The apple from the pine,\r\n   The orange from its glossy green,\r\n     The cluster from the vine;\r\n\r\n3. We better love the hardy gift\r\n     Our rugged vales bestow,\r\n   To cheer us, when the storm shall drift\r\n     Our harvest fields with snow.\r\n\r\n4. Through vales of grass and meads of flowers\r\n     Our plows their furrows made,\r\n   While on the hills the sun and showers\r\n     Of changeful April played.\r\n\r\n5. We dropped the seed o\'er hill and plain,\r\n     Beneath the sun of May,\r\n   And frightened from our sprouting grain\r\n     The robber crows away.\r\n\r\n6. All through the long, bright days of June,\r\n     Its leaves grew green and fair,\r\n   And waved in hot midsummer\'s noon\r\n     Its soft and yellow hair.\r\n\r\n7. And now, with Autumn\'s moonlit eves,\r\n     Its harvest time has come;\r\n   We pluck away the frosted leaves\r\n     And bear the treasure home.\r\n\r\n8. There, richer than the fabled gift\r\n     Apollo showered of old,\r\n   Fair hands the broken grain shall sift,\r\n     And knead its meal of gold.\r\n\r\n9. Let vapid idlers loll in silk,\r\n     Around their costly board;\r\n   Give us the bowl of samp and milk,\r\n     By homespun beauty poured!\r\n\r\n10. Where\'er the wide old kitchen hearth\r\n      Sends up its smoky curls,\r\n    Who will not thank the kindly earth\r\n      And bless our farmer girls!\r\n\r\n11. Then shame on all the proud and vain,\r\n      Whose folly laughs to scorn\r\n    The blessing of our hardy grain,\r\n      Our wealth of golden corn!\r\n\r\n12. Let earth withhold her goodly root;\r\n      Let mildew blight the rye,\r\n    Give to the worm the orchard\'s fruit,\r\n      The wheat field to the fly:\r\n\r\n13. But let the good old crop adorn\r\n      The hills our fathers trod;\r\n    Still let us, for his golden corn,\r\n      Send up our thanks to God!\r\n                                      From Whittier\'s "Songs of Labor."\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1.

THE VENOMOUS WORM.\r\n\r\nJohn Russell (b. 1793, d. 1863) graduated at Middlebury College, Vt., in\r\n1818. He was at one time editor of the "Backwoodsman," published at\r\nGrafton, Ill., and later of the "Louisville Advocate." He was the author\r\nof many tales of western adventure and of numerous essays, sketches, etc.\r\nHis language is clear, chaste, and classical; his style concise, vigorous,\r\nand sometimes highly ornate.\r\n\r\n1. Who has not heard of the rattlesnake or copperhead? An unexpected sight\r\nof either of these reptiles will make even the lords of creation recoil;\r\nbut there is a species of worm, found in various parts of this country,\r\nwhich conveys a poison of a nature so deadly that, compared with it, even\r\nthe venom of the rattlesnake is harmless. To guard our readers against\r\nthis foe of human kind is the object of this lesson.\r\n\r\n2. This worm varies much in size. It is frequently an inch in diameter,\r\nbut, as it is rarely seen except when coiled, its length can hardly be\r\nconjectured. It is of a dull lead color, and generally lives near a spring\r\nor small stream of water, and bites the unfortunate people who are in the\r\nhabit of going there to drink. The brute creation it never molests. They\r\navoid it with the same instinct that teaches the animals of India to shun\r\nthe deadly cobra.\r\n\r\n3. Several of these reptiles have long infested our settlements, to the\r\nmisery and destruction of many of our fellow citizens. I have, therefore,\r\nhad frequent opportunities of being the melancholy spectator of the\r\neffects produced by the subtile poison which this worm infuses.\r\n\r\n4. The symptoms of its bite are terrible. The eyes of the patient become\r\nred and fiery, his tongue swells to an immoderate size, and obstructs his\r\nutterance; and delirium of the most horrid character quickly follows.\r\nSometimes, in his madness, he attempts the destruction of his nearest\r\nfriends.\r\n\r\n5. If the sufferer has a family, his weeping wife and helpless infants are\r\nnot unfrequently the objects of his frantic fury. In a word, he exhibits,\r\nto the life, all the detestable passions that rankle in the bosom of a\r\nsavage; and such is the spell in which his senses are locked, that no\r\nsooner has the unhappy patient recovered from the paroxysm of insanity\r\noccasioned by the bite, than he seeks out the destroyer for the sole\r\npurpose of being bitten again.\r\n\r\n6. I have seen a good old father, his locks as white as snow, his step\r\nslow and trembling, beg in vain of his only son to quit the lurking place\r\nof the worm. My heart bled when he turned away; for I knew the fond hope\r\nthat his son would be the "staff of his declining years," had supported\r\nhim through many a sorrow.\r\n\r\n7. Youths of America, would you know the name of this reptile? It is\r\ncalled the WORM OF THE STILL.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Rep\'tiles, animals that crawl, as snakes, liz-ards, etc.\r\nRe-coil\', to start back, to shrink from. 2. Co\'bra, a highly venomous\r\nreptile inhabiting the East Indies. In-fest\'ed, troubled, annoyed. 3.\r\nSub\'tile, acute, piercing. In-fus\'es, intro-duces. 4. Ob-structs\',\r\nhinders. De-lir\'i-um, a wandering of the mind. 5. Ran\'kle, to rage.\r\nPar\'ox-ysm, a fit, a convulsion. 7. Worm, a spiral metallic pipe used in\r\ndistilling liquors. Still, a vessel used in distilling or making liquors.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII. THE FESTAL BOARD.\r\n\r\n1. Come to the festal board tonight,\r\n     For bright-eyed beauty will be there,\r\n   Her coral lips in nectar steeped,\r\n     And garlanded her hair.\r\n\r\n2. Come to the festal board to-night,\r\n     For there the joyous laugh of youth\r\n   Will ring those silvery peals, which speak\r\n     Of bosom pure and stainless truth.\r\n\r\n3. Come to the festal board to-night,\r\n     For friendship, there, with stronger chain,\r\n   Devoted hearts already bound\r\n     For good or ill, will bind again.\r\n                      I went.\r\n\r\n4. Nature and art their stores outpoured;\r\n     Joy beamed in every kindling glance;\r\n   Love, friendship, youth, and beauty smiled;\r\n     What could that evening\'s bliss enhance?\r\n                      We parted.\r\n\r\n5. And years have flown; but where are now\r\n     The guests who round that table met?\r\n   Rises their sun as gloriously\r\n     As on the banquet\'s eve it set?\r\n\r\n6. How holds the chain which friendship wove?\r\n     It broke; and soon the hearts it bound\r\n   Were widely sundered; and for peace,\r\n     Envy and strife and blood were found.\r\n\r\n7. The merriest laugh which then was heard\r\n     Has changed its tones to maniac screams,\r\n   As half-quenched memory kindles up\r\n     Glimmerings of guilt in feverish dreams.\r\n\r\n8. And where is she whose diamond eyes\r\n     Golconda\'s purest gems outshone?\r\n   Whose roseate lips of Eden breathed?\r\n     Say, where is she, the beauteous one?\r\n\r\n9. Beneath yon willow\'s drooping shade,\r\n     With eyes now dim, and lips all pale,\r\n   She sleeps in peace. Read on her urn,\r\n   "A broken heart." This tells her tale.\r\n\r\n10. And where is he, that tower of strength,\r\n      Whose fate with hers for life was joined?\r\n    How beats his heart, once honor\'s throne?\r\n      How high has soared his daring mind?\r\n\r\n11. Go to the dungeon\'s gloom to-night;\r\n      His wasted form, his aching head,\r\n    And all that now remains of him,\r\n      Lies, shuddering, on a felon\'s bed.\r\n\r\n12. Ask you of all these woes the cause?\r\n      The festal board, the enticing bowl,\r\n    More often came, and reason fled,\r\n      And maddened passions spurned control.\r\n\r\n13. Learn wisdom, then. The frequent feast\r\n      Avoid; for there, with stealthy tread\r\n    Temptation walks, to lure you on,\r\n      Till death, at last, the banquet spread.\r\n\r\n14. And shun, oh shun, the enchanted cup!\r\n      Though now its draught like joy appears,\r\n    Ere long it will be fanned by sighs,\r\n      And sadly mixed with blood and tears.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Fes\'tal, mirthful, joyous. Gar\'land-ed, adorned with\r\nwreaths of flowers. 3. De-vot\'ed, solemnly set apart. 4. En-hance\',\r\nincrease. 6. Sun\'dered, separated. 7.

HOW TO TELL BAD NEWS.\r\n\r\nMr. H. and the Steward.\r\n\r\nMr. H. Ha! Steward, how are you, my old boy? How do things go on at home?\r\n\r\nSteward. Bad enough, your honor; the magpie\'s dead.\r\n\r\nH. Poor Mag! So he\'s gone. How came he to die?\r\n\r\nS. Overeat himself, sir.\r\n\r\nH. Did he? A greedy dog; why, what did he get he liked so well?\r\n\r\nS. Horseflesh, sir; he died of eating horseflesh,\r\n\r\nH. How came he to get so much horseflesh?\r\n\r\nS. All your father\'s horses, sir.\r\n\r\nH. What! are they dead, too?\r\n\r\nS. Ay, sir; they died of overwork.\r\n\r\nH. And why were they overworked, pray?\r\n\r\nS. To carry water, sir.\r\n\r\nH. To carry water! and what were they carrying water for?\r\n\r\nS. Sure, sir, to put out the fire.\r\n\r\nH. Fire! what fire?\r\n\r\nS. O, sir, your father\'s house is burned to the ground.\r\n\r\nH. My father\'s house burned down! and how came it set on fire?\r\n\r\nS. I think, sir, it must have been the torches.\r\n\r\nH. Torches! what torches?\r\n\r\nS. At your mother\'s funeral.\r\n\r\nH. My mother dead!\r\n\r\nS. Ah, poor lady! she never looked up, after it.\r\n\r\nH. After what?\r\n\r\nS. The loss of your father.\r\n\r\nH. My father gone, too?\r\n\r\nS. Yes, poor gentleman! he took to his bed as soon as he heard of it.\r\n\r\nH. Heard of what?\r\n\r\nS. The bad news, sir, and please your honor.\r\n\r\nH. What! more miseries! more bad news!\r\n\r\nS. Yes, sir; your bank has failed, and your credit is lost, and you are\r\nnot worth a shilling in the world. I made bold, sir, to wait on you about\r\nit, for I thought you would like to hear the news.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX. THE BATTLE OF BLENHEIM.\r\n\r\nRobert Southey (b. 1774, d. 1843) was born in Bristol, England. He entered\r\nBalliol College, Oxford, in 1793. In 1804 he established himself\r\npermanently at Greta Hall, near Keswick, Cumberland, in the "Lake\r\nCountry," where he enjoyed the friendship and society of Wordsworth and\r\nColeridge, other poets of the "Lake School." He was appointed poet\r\nlaureate in 1813, and received a pension of 300 Pounds a year from the\r\ngovernment in 1835. Mr. Southey was a voluminous writer in both prose and\r\nverse. As a poet, he can not be placed in the first rank, although some of\r\nhis minor poems are very happy in thought and expression. Among his most\r\nnoted poetical works are "Joan of Arc," "Thalaba the Destroyer," "Madoc,"\r\n"Roderick," and the "Curse of Kehama,"\r\n\r\n1. It was a summer evening,\r\n     Old Kaspar\'s work was done,\r\n   And he, before his cottage door,\r\n     Was sitting in the sun;\r\n   And by him sported on the green,\r\n   His little grandchild Wilhelmine.\r\n\r\n2. She saw her brother Peterkin\r\n     Roll something large and round,\r\n   Which he beside the rivulet,\r\n     In playing there, had found;\r\n   He came to ask what he had found,\r\n   That was so large, and smooth, and round.\r\n\r\n3. Old Kaspar took it from the boy,\r\n     Who stood expectant by;\r\n   And then the old man shook his head,\r\n     And, with a natural sigh,\r\n   " \'T is some poor fellow\'s skull," said he,\r\n   "Who fell in the great victory.\r\n\r\n4. "I find them in the garden,\r\n     For there\'s many hereabout;\r\n   And often when I go to plow,\r\n     The plowshare turns them out;\r\n   For many thousand men," said he,\r\n   "Were slain in that great victory."\r\n\r\n5. "Now tell us what \'t was all about,"\r\n     Young Peterkin he cries;\r\n   While little Wilhelmine looks up\r\n     With wonder-waiting eyes;\r\n   "Now tell us all about the war,\r\n   And what they killed each other for."\r\n\r\n6. "It was the English," Kaspar cried,\r\n     "Who put the French to rout,\r\n   But what they killed each other for,\r\n     I could not well make out;\r\n   But everybody said," quoth he,\r\n   "That \'t was a famous victory:\r\n\r\n7, "My father lived at Blenheim then,\r\n     Yon little stream, hard by;\r\n   They burnt his dwelling to the ground,\r\n     And he was forced to fly;\r\n   So, with his wife and child he fled,\r\n   Nor had he where to rest his head.\r\n\r\n8. "With fire and sword, the country round\r\n     Was wasted, far and wide;\r\n   And many a nursing mother then,\r\n     And newborn baby died;\r\n   But things like that, you know, must be\r\n   At every famous victory.\r\n\r\n9. "They say it was a shocking sight\r\n     After the field was won;\r\n   For many thousand bodies here\r\n     Lay rotting in the sun:\r\n   But things like that, you know, must be\r\n   After a famous victory.\r\n\r\n10. "Great praise the Duke of Marlboro\' won,\r\n      And our young prince, Eugene."\r\n    "Why, \'t was a very wicked thing!"\r\n      Said little Wilhelmine.\r\n    "Nay, nay, my little girl!" quoth he,\r\n    "It was a famous victory.\r\n\r\n11. "And everybody praised the Duke\r\n      Who this great fight did win."\r\n    "But what good came of it at last?"\r\n      Quoth little Peterkin.\r\n    "Why, that I can not tell," said he,\r\n    "But \'t was a glorious victory."\r\n\r\nNOTES.--The Battle of Blenheim, in the "War of the Spanish Succession,"\r\nwas fought August 13, 1704, near Blenheim, in Bavaria, between the French\r\nand Bavarians, on one Ride, and an allied army under the great English\r\ngeneral, the Duke of Marlborough, and Eugene, Prince of Savoy, on the\r\nother. The latter won a decisive victory: 10,000 of the defeated army were\r\nkilled and wounded, and 13,000 were taken prisoners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI. "I PITY THEM."\r\n\r\n1. A poor man once undertook to emigrate from Castine, Me., to Illinois.\r\nWhen he was attempting to cross a river in New York, his horse broke\r\nthrough the rotten timbers of the bridge, and was drowned. He had but this\r\none animal to convey all his property and his family to his new home.\r\n\r\n2. His wife and children were almost miraculously saved from sharing the\r\nfate of the horse; but the loss of this poor animal was enough. By its aid\r\nthe family, it may be said, had lived and moved; now they were left\r\nhelpless in a land of strangers, without the ability to go on or return,\r\nwithout money or a single friend to whom to appeal. The case was a hard\r\none.\r\n\r\n3. There were a great many who "passed by on the other side." Some even\r\nlaughed at the predicament in which the man was placed; but by degrees a\r\ngroup of people began to collect, all of whom pitied him.\r\n\r\n4. Some pitied him a great deal, and some did not pity him very much,\r\nbecause, they said, he might have known better than to try to cross an\r\nunsafe bridge, and should have made his horse swim the river. Pity,\r\nhowever, seemed rather to predominate. Some pitied the man, and some the\r\nhorse; all pitied the poor, sick mother and her six helpless children.\r\n\r\n5. Among this pitying party was a rough son of the West, who knew what it\r\nwas to migrate some hundreds of miles over new roads to locate a destitute\r\nfamily on a prairie. Seeing the man\'s forlorn situation, and looking\r\naround on the bystanders, he said, "All of you seem to pity these poor\r\npeople very much, but I would beg leave to ask each of you how much."\r\n\r\n6. "There, stranger," continued he, holding up a ten dollar bill, "there\r\nis the amount of my pity; and if others will do as I do, you may soon get\r\nanother pony. God bless you." It is needless to state the effect that this\r\nactive charity produced. In a short time the happy emigrant arrived at his\r\ndestination, and he is now a thriving farmer, and a neighbor to him who\r\nwas his "friend in need, and a friend indeed."\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Em\'i-grate, to remove from one country or state to\r\nanother for the purpose of residence, to migrate. 2. Mi-rac\'u-lous-ly, as\r\nif by miracle, wonderfully. A-bil\'i-ty, power, capability. 3.\r\nPre-dic\'a-ment, condition, plight. 4. Pre-dom\'i-nate, to prevail, to rule.\r\n5. Lo\'cate, to place. Des\'ti-tute, needy, poor. 6. Des-ti-na\'tion, end of\r\na journey. Thriv\'ing, prosperous through industry, economy, and good\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXII. AN ELEGY ON MADAM BLAIZE.\r\n\r\nOliver Goldsmith (b. 1728, d. 1774) was born at Pallas, or Pallasmore, in\r\nthe parish of Forney, Ireland. He received his education at several\r\nschools, at Trinity College, Dublin, at Edinburgh, and at Leyden. He spent\r\nsome time in wandering over continental Europe, often in poverty and want.\r\nIn 1756 he became a resident of London, where he made the acquaintance of\r\nseveral celebrated men, among whom were Dr. Johnson and Sir Joshua\r\nReynolds. His writings are noted for their purity, grace, and fluency. His\r\nfame as a poet is secured by "The Traveler," and "The Deserted Village;"\r\nas a dramatist, by "She Stoops to Conquer;" and as a novelist, by "The\r\nVicar of Wakefield." His reckless extravagance always kept him in\r\nfinancial difficulty, and he died heavily in debt. His monument is in\r\nWestminster Abbey.\r\n\r\n1. Good people all, with one accord,\r\n     Lament for Madam Blaize,\r\n   Who never wanted a good word--\r\n     From those who spoke her praise.\r\n\r\n2. The needy seldom passed her door,\r\n     And always found her kind;\r\n   She freely lent to all the poor--\r\n     Who left a pledge behind.\r\n\r\n3. She strove the neighborhood to please,\r\n     With manner wondrous winning:\r\n   She never followed wicked ways--\r\n     Unless when she was sinning.\r\n\r\n4. At church, in silks and satin new,\r\n     With hoop of monstrous size,\r\n   She never slumbered in her pew--\r\n     But when she shut her eyes.\r\n\r\n5. Her love was sought, I do aver,\r\n     By twenty beaux and more;\r\n   The king himself has followed her\r\n     When she has walked before.\r\n\r\n6. But now, her wealth and finery fled,\r\n     Her hangers-on cut short all,\r\n   Her doctors found, when she was dead--\r\n     Her last disorder mortal.\r\n\r\n7. Let us lament, in sorrow sore;\r\n     For Kent Street well may say,\r\n   That, had she lived a twelvemonth more--\r\n     She had not died to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Ac-cord\', agreement of opinion, consent. 2. Pledge,\r\npersonal property delivered to another as a security for a debt. 6.\r\nHang\'ers-on, followers. Mor\'tal, destructive to life.\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII. KING CHARLES II AND WILLIAM PENN.\r\n\r\nKing Charles. Well, friend William! I have sold you a noble province in\r\nNorth America; but still, I suppose you have no thoughts of going thither\r\nyourself?\r\n\r\nPenn. Yes, I have, I assure thee, friend Charles; and I am just come to\r\nbid thee farewell.\r\n\r\nK.C. What! venture yourself among the savages of North America! Why, man,\r\nwhat security have you that you will not be in their war kettle in two\r\nhours after setting foot on their shores?\r\n\r\nP. The best security in the world.\r\n\r\nK.C. I doubt that, friend William; I have no idea of any security against\r\nthose cannibals but in a regiment of good soldiers, with their muskets and\r\nbayonets. And mind, I tell you beforehand, that, with all my good will for\r\nyou and your family, to whom I am under obligations, I will not send a\r\nsingle soldier with you.\r\n\r\nP. I want none of thy soldiers, Charles: I depend on something better than\r\nthy soldiers.\r\n\r\nK.C. Ah! what may that be?\r\n\r\nP. Why, I depend upon themselves; on the working of their own hearts; on\r\ntheir notions of justice; on their moral sense.\r\n\r\nK.C. A fine thing, this same moral sense, no doubt; but I fear you will\r\nnot find much of it among the Indians of North America.\r\n\r\nP. And why not among them as well as others?\r\n\r\nK.C. Because if they had possessed any, they would not have treated my\r\nsubjects so barbarously as they have done.\r\n\r\nP. That is no proof of the contrary, friend Charles. Thy subjects\r\nwere the aggressors. When thy subjects first went to North\r\nAmerica, they found these poor people the fondest and kindest\r\ncreatures in the world. Every day they would watch for them to\r\ncome ashore, and hasten to meet them, and feast them on the best\r\nfish, and venison, and corn, which were all they had. In return for\r\nthis hospitality of the savages, as we call them, thy subjects,\r\ntermed Christians, seized on their country and rich hunting\r\ngrounds for farms for themselves. Now, is it to be wondered at,\r\nthat these much-injured people should have been driven to\r\ndesperation by such injustice; and that, burning with revenge, they\r\nshould have committed some excesses?\r\n\r\nK C. Well, then, I hope you will not complain when they come to treat you\r\nin the same manner.\r\n\r\nP. I am not afraid of it.\r\n\r\nK.C. Ah! how will you avoid it? You mean to get their hunting grounds,\r\ntoo, I suppose?\r\n\r\nP. Yes, but not by driving these poor people away from them.\r\n\r\nK.C. No, indeed? How then will you get their lands?\r\n\r\nP. I mean to buy their lands of them.\r\n\r\nK.C. Buy their lands of them? Why, man, you have already bought them of\r\nme!\r\n\r\nP. Yes, I know I have, and at a dear rate, too; but I did it only to get\r\nthy good will, not that I thought thou hadst any right to their lands.\r\n\r\nK.C. How, man? no right to their lands?\r\n\r\nP. No, friend Charles, no right; no right at all: what right hast thou to\r\ntheir lands?\r\n\r\nK.C. Why, the right of discovery, to be sure; the right which the Pope and\r\nall Christian kings have agreed to give one another.\r\n\r\nP. The right of discovery? A strange kind of right, indeed. Now suppose,\r\nfriend Charles, that some canoe load of these Indians, crossing the sea,\r\nand discovering this island of Great Britain, were to claim it as their\r\nown, and set it up for sale over thy head, what wouldst thou think of it?\r\n\r\nK.C. Why--why--why--I must confess, I should think it a piece of great\r\nimpudence in them.\r\n\r\nP. Well, then, how canst thou, a Christian, and a Christian prince, too,\r\ndo that which thou so utterly condemnest in these people whom thou callest\r\nsavages? And suppose, again, that these Indians, on thy refusal to give up\r\nthy island of Great Britain, were to make war on thee, and, having weapons\r\nmore destructive than thine, were to destroy many of thy subjects, and\r\ndrive the rest away--wouldst thou not think it horribly cruel?\r\n\r\nK. C. I must say, friend William, that I should; how can I say otherwise?\r\n\r\nP. Well, then, how can I, who call myself a Christian, do what I should\r\nabhor even in the heathen? No. I will not do it. But I will buy the right\r\nof the proper owners, even of the Indians themselves. By doing this, I\r\nshall imitate God himself in his justice and mercy, and thereby insure his\r\nblessing on my colony, if I should ever live to plant one in North\r\nAmerica.\r\n                                                          --Mason L. Weems.\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--Can\'ni-bals, human beings that eat human flesh. Reg\'i-ment,\r\na body of troops, consisting usually of ten companies. Ag-gress\'ors, those\r\nwho first commence hostilities. Ven\'i-son (pro. ven\'i-zn, or ven\'zn), the\r\nflesh of deer. Ex-cess\'es, misdeeds, evil acts. Con-demn\'est (pro.\r\nkon-dem\'est), censure, blame.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--Charles II. was king of England from A.D. 1660 to\r\n1685. William Penn (b. 1644, d. 1718) was a noted Englishman\r\nwho belonged to the sect of Friends. He came to America in 1682,\r\nand founded the province which is now the state of Pennsylvania.\r\nHe purchased the lands from the Indians, who were so impressed\r\nwith the justice and good will of Penn and his associates, that the\r\nQuaker dress often served as a sure protection when other settlers\r\nwere trembling for their lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV. WHAT I LIVE FOR.\r\n\r\n1. I live for those who love me,\r\n     Whose hearts are kind and true;\r\n   For the heaven that smiles above me,\r\n     And awaits my spirit, too;\r\n   For all human ties that bind me,\r\n   For the task my God assigned me,\r\n   For the bright hopes left behind me,\r\n     And the good that I can do.\r\n\r\n2. I live to learn their story,\r\n     Who suffered for my sake;\r\n   To emulate their glory,\r\n     And follow in their wake;\r\n   Bards, patriots, martyrs, sages,\r\n   The noble of all ages,\r\n   Whose deeds crown History\'s pages,\r\n     And Time\'s great volume make.\r\n\r\n3. I live to hail that season,\r\n     By gifted minds foretold,\r\n   When man shall live by reason,\r\n     And not alone by gold;\r\n   When man to man united,\r\n   And every wrong thing righted,\r\n   The whole world shall be lighted\r\n     As Eden was of old.\r\n\r\n4. I live for those who love me,\r\n     For those who know me true;\r\n   For the heaven that smiles above me,\r\n     And awaits my spirit, too;\r\n   For the cause that needs assistance,\r\n   For the wrongs that need resistance,\r\n   For the future in the distance,\r\n     And the good that I can do.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--l. As-signed\' (pro. as-sind\'), allotted, marked out. 2.\r\nEm\'-u-late, to strive to equal or excel, to rival. Wake, the track left by\r\na vessel in the water, hence, figuratively, in the train of.

THE RIGHTEOUS NEVER FORSAKEN.\r\n\r\n1. It was Saturday night, and the widow of the Pine Cottage sat by her\r\nblazing fagots, with her five tattered children at her side, endeavoring\r\nby listening to the artlessness of their prattle to dissipate the heavy\r\ngloom that pressed upon her mind. For a year, her own feeble hand had\r\nprovided for her helpless family, for she had no supporter: she thought of\r\nno friend in all the wide, unfriendly world around.\r\n\r\n2. But that mysterious Providence, the wisdom of whose ways is above human\r\ncomprehension, had visited her with wasting sickness, and her little means\r\nhad become exhausted. It was now, too, midwinter, and the snow lay heavy\r\nand deep through all the surrounding forests, while storms still seemed\r\ngathering in the heavens, and the driving wind roared amid the neighboring\r\npines, and rocked her puny mansion.\r\n\r\n3. The last herring smoked upon the coals before her; it was the only\r\narticle of food she possessed, and no wonder her forlorn, desolate state\r\nbrought up in her lone bosom all the anxieties of a mother when she looked\r\nupon her children: and no wonder, forlorn as she was, if she suffered the\r\nheart swellings of despair to rise, even though she knew that He, whose\r\npromise is to the widow and to the orphan, can not forget his word.\r\n\r\n4. Providence had many years before taken from her her eldest son, who\r\nwent from his forest home to try his fortune on the high seas, since which\r\nshe had heard no tidings of him; and in her latter time had, by the hand\r\nof death, deprived her of the companion and staff of her earthly\r\npilgrimage, in the person of her husband. Yet to this hour she had\r\nupborne; she had not only been able to provide for her little flock, but\r\nhad never lost an opportunity of ministering to the wants of the miserable\r\nand destitute.\r\n\r\n5. The indolent may well bear with poverty while the ability to gain\r\nsustenance remains. The individual who has but his own wants to supply may\r\nsuffer with fortitude the winter of want; his affections are not wounded,\r\nhis heart is not wrung. The most desolate in populous cities may hope, for\r\ncharity has not quite closed her hand and heart, and shut her eyes on\r\nmisery.\r\n\r\n6. But the industrious mother of helpless and depending children, far from\r\nthe reach of human charity, has none of these to console her. And such a\r\none was the widow of the Pine Cottage; but as she bent over the fire, and\r\ntook up the last scanty remnant of food to spread before her children, her\r\nspirits seemed to brighten up, as by some sudden and mysterious impulse,\r\nand Cowper\'s beautiful lines came uncalled across her mind:\r\n\r\n     "Judge not the Lord by feeble sense.\r\n       But trust him for his grace;\r\n     Behind a frowning Providence\r\n       He hides a smiling face."\r\n\r\n7. The smoked herring was scarcely laid upon the table, when a gentle rap\r\nat the door, and the loud barking of a dog, attracted the attention of the\r\nfamily. The children flew to open it, and a weary traveler, in tattered\r\ngarments and in apparently indifferent health; entered, and begged a\r\nlodging and a mouthful of food. Said he: "It is now twenty-four hour\'s\r\nsince I tasted bread." The widow\'s heart bled anew, as under a fresh\r\ncomplication of distresses; for her sympathies lingered not around her\r\nfireside. She hesitated not even now; rest, and a share of all she had,\r\nshe proffered to the stranger. "\'We shall not be forsaken," said she, "or\r\nsuffer deeper for an act of charity."\r\n\r\n8. The traveler drew near the board, but when he saw the scanty fare, he\r\nraised his eyes toward heaven with astonishment: "And is this all your\r\nstore?" said he; "and a share of this do you offer to one you know not?\r\nthen never saw I charity before! But, madam," said he, continuing, "do you\r\nnot wrong your children by giving a part of your last mouthful to a\r\nstranger?"\r\n\r\n9. "Ah," said the poor widow--and the tear-drops gushed into her eyes as\r\nshe said it--"I have a boy, a darling son, somewhere on the face of the\r\nwide world, unless Heaven has taken him away, and I only act toward you as\r\nI would that others should act toward him. God, who sent manna from\r\nheaven, can provide for us as he did for Israel; and how should I this\r\nnight offend him, if my son should be a wanderer, destitute as you, and he\r\nshould have provided for him a home, even poor as this, were I to turn you\r\nunrelieved away!"\r\n\r\n10. The widow ended, and the stranger, springing from his seat, clasped\r\nher in his arms. "God indeed has provided your son a home, and has given\r\nhim wealth to reward the goodness of his benefactress: my mother! oh, my\r\nmother!" It was her long lost son, returned to her bosom from the Indies.\r\nHe had chosen that disguise that he might the more completely surprise his\r\nfamily; and never was surprise more perfect, or followed by a sweeter cup\r\nof joy.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Fag\'ots. bundles of sticks used for fuel. Prat\'tle,\r\ntrifling talk. Dis\'si-pate, to scatter. 2. Pu\'ny, small and weak. 4.\r\nPil\'grim-age, a journey. 5.

ABOU BEN ADHEM.\r\n\r\nJames Henry Leigh Hunt (b. 1784, d. 1859) was the son of a West Indian,\r\nwho married an American lady, and practiced law in Philadelphia until the\r\nRevolution; being a Tory, he then returned to England, where Leigh Hunt\r\nwas born. The latter wrote many verses while yet a boy, and in 1801 his\r\nfather published a collection of them, entitled "Juvenilia." For many\r\nyears he was connected with various newspapers, and, while editor of the\r\n"Examiner," was imprisoned for two years for writing disrespectfully of\r\nthe prince regent. While in prison he was visited frequently by the poets\r\nByron, Moore, Lamb, Shelley, and Keats; and there wrote "The Feast of the\r\nPoets," "The Descent of Liberty, a Mask," and "The Story of Rimini," which\r\nimmediately gave him a reputation as a poet. His writings include various\r\ntranslations, dramas, novels, collections of essays, and poems.\r\n\r\n1. ABOU BEN ADHEM (may his tribe increase!)\r\n   Awoke one night from a deep dream of peace,\r\n   And saw within the moonlight in his room,\r\n   Making it rich and like a lily in bloom,\r\n   An angel writing in a book of gold.\r\n\r\n2. Exceeding peace had made Ben Adhem bold;\r\n   And to the presence in the room he said,\r\n   "What writest thou?" The vision raised its head,\r\n   And, with a look made of all sweet accord,\r\n   Answered, "The names of those who love the Lord."\r\n\r\n3. "And is mine one?" said Abou. "Nay, not so,"\r\n   Replied the angel. Abou spoke more low,\r\n   But cheerly still; and said, "I pray thee, then,\r\n   Write me as one that loves his fellow-men."\r\n\r\n4. The angel wrote, and vanished. The next night\r\n   It came again, with a great wakening light,\r\n   And showed the names whom love of God had blessed;\r\n   And, lo! Ben Adhem\'s name led all the rest.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--The above selection is written in imitation of an\r\noriental fable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII. LUCY FORESTER.\r\n\r\nJohn Wilson (b. 1785, d. 1854), better known as "Christopher North," was a\r\ncelebrated author, poet, and critic, born at Paisley, Scotland, and\r\neducated at the University of Glasgow and at Oxford. In 1808 he moved to\r\nWestmoreland, England, where he formed one of the "Lake School" of poets.\r\nWhile at Oxford he gained a prize for a poem on "Painting, Poetry, and\r\nArchitecture." In 1820 he became Professor of Moral Philosophy in the\r\nUniversity of Edinburgh, which position he retained until 1851. He gained\r\nhis greatest reputation as the chief author of "Noctes Ambrosianae,"\r\nessays contributed to Blackwood\'s Magazine between 1822 and 1825. Among\r\nhis poems may be mentioned "The Isle of Palms" and the "City of the\r\nPlague," This selection is adapted from "The Foresters," a tale of\r\nScottish life.\r\n\r\n1. Lucy was only six years old, but bold as a fairy; she had gone by\r\nherself a thousand times about the braes, and often upon errands to houses\r\ntwo or three miles distant. What had her parents to fear? The footpaths\r\nwere all firm, and led to no places of danger, nor are infants themselves\r\nincautious when alone in then pastimes. Lucy went singing into the low\r\nwoods, and singing she reappeared on the open hillside. With her small\r\nwhite hand on the rail, she glided along the wooden bridge, or tripped\r\nfrom stone to stone across the shallow streamlet.\r\n\r\n2. The creature would be away for hours, and no fear be felt on her\r\naccount by anyone at home; whether she had gone, with her basket on her\r\narm, to borrow some articles of household use from a neighbor, or, merely\r\nfor her own solitary delight, had wandered off to the braes to play among\r\nthe flowers, coming back laden with wreaths and garlands.\r\n\r\n3. The happy child had been invited to pass a whole day, from morning to\r\nnight, at Ladyside (a farmhouse about two miles off) with her playmates\r\nthe Maynes; and she left home about an hour after sunrise.\r\n\r\n4. During her absence, the house was silent but happy, and, the evening\r\nbeing now far advanced, Lucy was expected home every minute, and Michael,\r\nAgnes, and Isabel, her father, mother, and aunt, went to meet her on the\r\nway. They walked on and on, wondering a little, but in no degree alarmed\r\ntill they reached Ladyside, and heard the cheerful din of the children\r\nwithin, still rioting at the close of the holiday. Jacob Mayne came to the\r\ndoor, but, on their kindly asking why Lucy had not been sent home before\r\ndaylight was over, he looked painfully surprised, and said that she had\r\nnot been at Ladyside.\r\n\r\n5. Within two hours, a hundred persons were traversing the hills in all\r\ndirections, even at a distance which it seemed most unlikely that poor\r\nLucy could have reached. The shepherds and their dogs, all the night\r\nthrough, searched every nook, every stony and rocky place, every piece of\r\ntaller heather, every crevice that could conceal anything alive or dead:\r\nbut no Lucy was there.\r\n\r\n6. Her mother, who for a while seemed inspired with supernatural strength,\r\nhad joined in the search, and with a quaking heart looked into every\r\nbrake, or stopped and listened to every shout and halloo reverberating\r\namong the hills, intent to seize upon some tone of recognition or\r\ndiscovery. But the moon sank; and then the stars, whose increased\r\nbrightness had for a short time supplied her place, all faded away; and\r\nthen came the gray dawn of the morning, and then the clear brightness of\r\nthe day,--and still Michael and Agnes were childless.\r\n\r\n7. "She has sunk into some mossy or miry place," said Michael, to a man\r\nnear him, into whose face he could not look, "a cruel, cruel death to one\r\nlike her! The earth on which my child walked has closed over her, and we\r\nshall never see her more!"\r\n\r\n8. At last, a man who had left the search, and gone in a direction toward\r\nthe highroad, came running with something in his arms toward the place\r\nwhere Michael and others were standing beside Agnes, who lay, apparently\r\nexhausted almost to dying, on the sward. He approached hesitatingly; and\r\nMichael saw that he carried Lucy\'s bonnet, clothes, and plaid.\r\n\r\n9. It was impossible not to see some spots of blood upon the frill that\r\nthe child had worn around her neck. "Murdered! murdered!" was the one word\r\nwhispered or ejaculated all around; but Agnes heard it not; for, worn out\r\nby that long night of hope and despair, she had fallen asleep, and was,\r\nperhaps, seeking her lost Lucy in her dreams.\r\n\r\n10. Isabel took the clothes, and, narrowly inspecting them with eye and\r\nhand, said, with a fervent voice that was heard even in Michael\'s despair,\r\n"No, Lucy is yet among the living. There are no marks of violence on the\r\ngarments of the innocent; no murderer\'s hand has been here. These blood\r\nspots have been put here to deceive. Besides, would not the murderer have\r\ncarried off these things? For what else would he have murdered her? But,\r\noh! foolish despair! What speak I of? For, wicked as the world is--ay!\r\ndesperately wicked--there is not, on all the surface of the wide earth, a\r\nhand that would murder our child! Is it not plain as the sun in the\r\nheaven, that Lucy has been stolen by some wretched gypsy beggar?"\r\n\r\n11. The crowd quietly dispersed, and horse and foot began to scour the\r\ncountry. Some took the highroads, others all the bypaths, and many the\r\ntrackless hills. Now that they were in some measure relieved from the\r\nhorrible belief that the child was dead, the worst other calamity seemed\r\nnothing, for hope brought her back to their arms.\r\n\r\n12. Agnes had been able to walk home to Bracken-Braes, and Michael and\r\nIsabel sat by her bedside. All her strength was gone, and she lay at the\r\nmercy of the rustle of a leaf, or a shadow across the window. Thus hour\r\nafter hour passed, till it was again twilight. "I hear footsteps coming up\r\nthe brae," said Agnes, who had for some time appeared to be slumbering;\r\nand in a few moments the voice of Jacob Mayne was heard at the outer\r\ndoor.\r\n\r\n13. Jacob wore a solemn expression of countenance, and he seemed, from his\r\nlooks, to bring no comfort. Michael stood up between him and his wife, and\r\nlooked into his heart. Something there seemed to be in his face that was\r\nnot miserable. "If he has heard nothing of my child," thought Michael,\r\n"this man must care little for his own fireside." "Oh, speak, speak," said\r\nAgnes; "yet why need you speak? All this has been but a vain belief, and\r\nLucy is in heaven."\r\n\r\n14. "Something like a trace of her has been discovered; a woman, with a\r\nchild that did not look like a child of hers, was last night at\r\nClovenford, and left it at the dawning." "Do you hear that, my beloved\r\nAgnes?" said Isabel; "she will have tramped away with Lucy up into Ettrick\r\nor Yarrow; but hundreds of eyes will have been upon her; for these are\r\nquiet but not solitary glens; and the hunt will be over long before she\r\nhas crossed down upon Hawick. I knew that country in my young days, What\r\nsay you, Mr. Mayne? There is the light of hope in your face." "There is no\r\nreason to doubt, ma\'am, that it was Lucy. Everybody is sure of it. If it\r\nwas my own Rachel, I should have no fear as to seeing her this blessed\r\nnight."\r\n\r\n15. Jacob Mayne now took a chair, and sat down, with even a smile upon his\r\ncountenance. "I may tell you now, that Watty Oliver knows it was your\r\nchild, for he saw her limping along after the gypsy at Galla-Brigg; but,\r\nhaving no suspicion, he did not take a second look at her,--but one look\r\nis sufficient, and he swears it was bonny Lucy Forester."\r\n\r\n16. Aunt Isabel, by this time, had bread and cheese and a bottle of her\r\nown elder-flower wine on the table. "You have been a long and hard\r\njourney, wherever you have been, Mr. Mayne; take some refreshment;" and\r\nMichael asked a blessing.\r\n\r\n17. Jacob saw that he might now venture to reveal the whole truth. "No,\r\nno, Mrs. Irving, I am over happy to eat or to drink. You are all prepared\r\nfor the blessing that awaits you. Your child is not far off; and I myself,\r\nfor it is I myself that found her, will bring her by the hand, and restore\r\nher to her parents."\r\n\r\n18. Agnes had raised herself up in her bed at these words, but she sank\r\ngently back on her pillow; aunt Isabel was rooted to her chair; and\r\nMichael, as he rose up, felt as if the ground were sinking under his feet.\r\nThere was a dead silence all around the house for a short space, and then\r\nthe sound of many voices, which again by degrees subsided. The eyes of all\r\nthen looked, and yet feared to look, toward the door.\r\n\r\n19. Jacob Mayne was not so good as his word, for he did not\r\nbring Lucy by the hand to restore her to her parents; but dressed\r\nagain in her own bonnet and gown, and her own plaid, in rushed\r\ntheir own child, by herself, with tears and sobs of joy, and her\r\nfather laid her within her mother\'s bosom.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Brae, shelving ground, a declivity or slope of a hill.\r\nPas\'times, sports, plays, 4. Ri\'ot-ing, romping. 5.

THE REAPER AND THE FLOWERS.\r\n\r\nHenry Wadsworth Longfellow (b. 1807, d. 1882), the son of Hon. Stephen\r\nLongfellow, an eminent lawyer, was born in Portland, Maine. He graduated\r\nat Bowdoin College in 1825. After spending four years in Europe, he was\r\nProfessor of Modern Languages and Literature at Bowdoin till 1835, when he\r\nwas appointed to the chair of Modern Languages and Belles-lettres in\r\nHarvard University. He resigned his professorship in 1854, after which\r\ntime he resided in Cambridge, Mass. Longfellow wrote many original works\r\nboth in verse and prose, and made several translations, the most famous of\r\nwhich is that of the works of Dante. His poetry is always chaste and\r\nelegant, showing traces of careful scholarship in every line. The numerous\r\nand varied editions of his poems are evidences of their popularity.\r\n\r\n1. There is a Reaper whose name is Death,\r\n     And, with his sickle keen,\r\n   He reaps the bearded grain at a breath,\r\n     And the flowers that grow between.\r\n\r\n2. "Shall I have naught that is fair?" saith he;\r\n     "Have naught but the bearded grain?\r\n   Though the breath of these flowers is sweet to me,\r\n     I will give them all back again."\r\n\r\n3. He gazed at the flowers with tearful eyes,\r\n     He kissed their drooping leaves;\r\n   It was for the Lord of Paradise\r\n     He bound them in his sheaves.\r\n\r\n4. "My Lord has need of these flowerets gay,"\r\n     The Reaper said, and smiled;\r\n   "Dear tokens of the earth are they,\r\n     Where he was once a child.\r\n\r\n5. "They shall all bloom in the fields of light,\r\n     Transplanted by my care,\r\n   And saints, upon their garments white,\r\n     These sacred blossoms wear."\r\n\r\n6. And the mother gave in tears and pain\r\n     The flowers she most did love;\r\n   She knew she should find them all again\r\n     In the fields of light above.\r\n\r\n7. O, not in cruelty, not in wrath,\r\n     The Reaper came that day,\r\n   \'T was an angel visited the green earth,\r\n     And took the flowers away.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--3. Sheaves, bundles of grain. 4. To\'ken (pro. to\'kn), a\r\nsouvenir, that which is to recall some person, thing, or event. 6.\r\nTrans-plant\'ed, removed and planted in another place.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX. THE TOWN PUMP.\r\n\r\nNathaniel Hawthorne (b.1804, d.1864) was born in Salem, Mass. He graduated\r\nat Bowdoin College in 1825. His earliest literary productions, written for\r\nperiodicals, were published in two volumes--the first in 1837, the second\r\nin 1842--under the title of "Twice-Told Tales," "Mosses from an Old\r\nManse," another series of tales and sketches, was published in 1845. From\r\n1846 to 1850 he was surveyor of the port of Salem. In 1852 he was\r\nappointed United States consul for Liverpool. After holding this office\r\nfour years, he traveled for some time on the continent. His most popular\r\nworks are "The Scarlet Letter," a work showing a deep knowledge of human\r\nnature, "The House of the Seven Gables," "The Blithedale Romance." and\r\n"The Marble Faun," an Italian romance, which is regarded by many as the\r\nbest of his works. Being of a modest and retiring disposition, Mr.\r\nHawthorne avoided publicity. Most of his works are highly imaginative. As\r\na prose writer he has no superior among American authors. He died at\r\nPlymouth, N. H., while on a visit to the White Mountains for his health.\r\n\r\n[SCENE.--The corner of two principal streets. The Town Pump\r\ntalking through its nose.]\r\n\r\n1. Noon, by the north clock! Noon, by the east! High noon, too, by those\r\nhot sunbeams which fall, scarcely aslope, upon my head, and almost make\r\nthe water bubble and smoke in the trough under my nose. Truly, we public\r\ncharacters have a tough time of it! And among all the town officers,\r\nchosen at the yearly meeting, where is he that sustains, for a single\r\nyear, the burden of such manifold duties as are imposed, in perpetuity,\r\nupon the Town Pump?\r\n\r\n2. The title of town treasurer is rightfully mine, as guardian of the best\r\ntreasure the town has. The overseers of the poor ought to make me their\r\nchairman, since I provide bountifully for the pauper, without expense to\r\nhim that pays taxes. I am at the head of the fire department, and one of\r\nthe physicians of the board of health. As a keeper or the peace, all water\r\ndrinkers confess me equal to the constable. I perform some of the duties\r\nof the town clerk, by promulgating public notices, when they are pasted on\r\nmy front.\r\n\r\n3. To speak within bounds, I am chief person of the municipality, and\r\nexhibit, moreover, an admirable pattern to my brother officers by the\r\ncool, steady, upright, downright, and impartial discharge of my business,\r\nand the constancy with which I stand to my post. Summer or winter, nobody\r\nseeks me in vain; for all day long I am seen at the busiest corner, just\r\nabove the market, stretching out my arms to rich and poor alike; and at\r\nnight I hold a lantern over my head, to show where I am, and to keep\r\npeople out of the gutters.\r\n\r\n4. At this sultry noontide, I am cupbearer to the parched populace, for\r\nwhose benefit an iron goblet is chained to my waist Like a dramseller on\r\nthe public square, on a muster day, I cry aloud to all and sundry, in my\r\nplainest accents, and at the very tiptop of my voice. "Here it is,\r\ngentlemen! Here is the good liquor! Walk up, walk up, gentlemen, walk up,\r\nwalk up! Here is the superior stuff! Here is the unadulterated ale of\r\nfather Adam! better than Cognac, Hollands, Jamaica, strong beer, or wine\r\nof any price; here it is, by the hogshead or the single glass, and not a\r\ncent to pay. Walk up, gentlemen, walk up and help yourselves!"\r\n\r\n5. It were a pity if all this outcry should draw no customers. Here they\r\ncome. A hot day, gentlemen. Quaff and away again, so as to keep yourselves\r\nin a nice, cool sweat. You, my friend, will need another cupful to wash\r\nthe dust out of your throat, if it be as thick there as it is on your\r\ncowhide shoes. I see that you have trudged half a score of miles to-day,\r\nand, like a wise man, have passed by the taverns, and stopped at the\r\nrunning brooks and well curbs. Otherwise, betwixt heat without and fire\r\nwithin, you would have been burnt to a cinder, or melted down to nothing\r\nat all--in the fashion of a jellyfish.\r\n\r\n6. Drink, and make room for that other fellow, who seeks my aid to quench\r\nthe fiery fever of last night\'s potations, which he drained from no cup of\r\nmine. Welcome, most rubicund sir! You and I have been strangers hitherto;\r\nnor, to confess the truth, will my nose be anxious for a closer intimacy,\r\ntill the fumes of your breath be a little less potent.\r\n\r\n7. Mercy on you, man! The water absolutely hisses down your red-hot\r\ngullet, and is converted quite into steam in the miniature Tophet, which\r\nyou mistake for a stomach. Fill again, and tell me, on the word of an\r\nhonest toper, did you ever, in cellar, tavern, or any other kind of\r\ndramshop, spend the price of your children\'s food for a swig half so\r\ndelicious? Now, for the first time these ten years, you know the flavor of\r\ncold water. Good-by; and whenever you are thirsty, recollect that I keep a\r\nconstant supply at the old stand.\r\n\r\n8. Who next? Oh, my little friend, you are just let loose from school, and\r\ncome hither to scrub your blooming face, and drown the memory of certain\r\ntaps of the ferule, and other schoolboy troubles, in a draught from the\r\nTown Pump. Take it, pure as the current of your young life; take it, and\r\nmay your heart and tongue never be scorched with a fiercer thirst than\r\nnow.\r\n\r\n9. There, my dear child, put down the cup, and yield your place to this\r\nelderly gentleman, who treads so tenderly over the paving stones that I\r\nsuspect he is afraid of breaking them. What! he limps by without so much\r\nas thanking me, as if my hospitable offers were meant only for people who\r\nhave no wine cellars.\r\n\r\n10. Well, well, sir, no harm done, I hope! Go, draw the cork, tip the\r\ndecanter; but when your great toe shall set you a-roaring, it will be no\r\naffair of mine. If gentlemen love the pleasant titillation of the gout, it\r\nis all one to the Town Pump. This thirsty dog, with his red tongue lolling\r\nout, does not scorn my hospitality, but stands on his hind legs, and laps\r\neagerly out of the trough. See how lightly he capers away again! Jowler,\r\ndid your worship ever have the gout?\r\n\r\n11. Your pardon, good people! I must interrupt my stream of eloquence, and\r\nspout forth a stream of water to replenish the trough for this teamster\r\nand his two yoke of oxen, who have come all the way from Staunton, or\r\nsomewhere along that way. No part of my business gives me more pleasure\r\nthan the watering of cattle. Look! how rapidly they lower the watermark on\r\nthe sides of the trough, till their capacious stomachs are moistened with\r\na gallon or two apiece, and they can afford time to breathe, with sighs of\r\ncalm enjoyment! Now they roll their quiet eyes around the brim of their\r\nmonstrous drinking vessel. An ox is your true toper.\r\n\r\n12. I hold myself the grand reformer of the age. From my spout, and such\r\nspouts as mine, must flow the stream that shall cleanse our earth of a\r\nvast portion of its crime and anguish, which have gushed from the fiery\r\nfountains of the still. In this mighty enterprise, the cow shall be my\r\ngreat confederate. Milk and water!\r\n\r\n13. Ahem! Dry work this speechifying, especially to all unpracticed\r\norators. I never conceived till now what toil the temperance lecturers\r\nundergo for my sake. Do, some kind Christian, pump a stroke or two, just\r\nto wet my whistle. Thank you, sir. But to proceed.\r\n\r\n14. The Town Pump and the Cow! Such is the glorious partnership that shall\r\nfinally monopolize the whole business of quenching thirst. Blessed\r\nconsummation! Then Poverty shall pass away from the land, finding no hovel\r\nso wretched where her squalid form may shelter itself. Then Disease, for\r\nlack of other victims, shall gnaw his own heart and die. Then Sin, if she\r\ndo not die, shall lose half her strength.\r\n\r\n15. Then there will be no war of households. The husband and the wife,\r\ndrinking deep of peaceful joy, a calm bliss of temperate affections, shall\r\npass hand in hand through life, and lie down, not reluctantly, at its\r\nprotracted close. To them the past will be no turmoil of mad dreams, nor\r\nthe future an eternity of such moments as follow the delirium of a\r\ndrunkard. Their dead faces shall express what their spirits were, and are\r\nto be, by a lingering smile of memory and hope.\r\n\r\n16. Drink, then, and be refreshed! The water is as pure and cold as when\r\nit slaked the thirst of the red hunter, and flowed beneath the aged bough,\r\nthough now this gem of the wilderness is treasured under these hot stones,\r\nwhere no shadow falls, but from the brick buildings. But, still is this\r\nfountain the source of health, peace, and happiness, and I behold, with\r\ncertainty and joy, the approach of the period when the virtues of cold\r\nwater, too little valued since our father\'s days, will be fully\r\nappreciated and recognized by all.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1.

GOOD NIGHT.\r\n\r\nSamuel Griswold Goodrich (b. 1793, d. 1860) was born in Ridgefield, Conn.\r\nMr. Goodrich is best known as "Peter Parley," under which assumed name he\r\ncommenced the publication of a series of Juvenile works about 1827. He\r\nedited "Parley\'s Magazine" from 1841 to 1854. He was appointed United\r\nStates consul for Paris in 1848, and held that office four years. He was a\r\nvoluminous writer, and his works are interesting and popular. His\r\n"Recollections of a Lifetime" was published in 1857, and "Peter Parley\'s\r\nOwn Story" the year after his death.\r\n\r\n1. The sun has sunk behind the hills,\r\n     The shadows o\'er the landscape creep;\r\n   A drowsy sound the woodland fills,\r\n     As nature folds her arms to sleep:\r\n                  Good night--good night.\r\n\r\n2. The chattering jay has ceased his din,\r\n     The noisy robin sings no more;\r\n   The crow, his mountain haunt within,\r\n     Dreams \'mid the forest\'s surly roar:\r\n                  Good night--good night.\r\n\r\n3. The sunlit cloud floats dim and pale;\r\n     The dew is falling soft and still,\r\n   The mist hangs trembling o\'er the vale,\r\n     And silence broods o\'er yonder mill:\r\n                  Good night--good night.\r\n\r\n4. The rose, so ruddy in the light,\r\n     Bends on its stem all rayless now;\r\n   And by its side a lily white,\r\n     A sister shadow, seems to bow:\r\n                  Good night--good night.\r\n\r\n5. The bat may wheel on silent wing,\r\n     The fox his guilty vigils keep,\r\n   The boding owl his dirges sing;\r\n     But love and innocence will sleep:\r\n                  Good night--good night.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXI. AN OLD-FASHIONED GIRL.\r\n\r\nLouisa May Alcott (b. 1833, d. 1888) was born at Germantown, Pa., of New\r\nEngland parentage. Her parents afterwards returned to New England, and\r\nmost of her life was spent in Concord, Mass. During the Civil War she went\r\nto Washington and nursed the wounded and sick until her own health gave\r\nway. As a child she used to write stories for the amusement of her\r\nplaymates, and in 1857 published her first book, "Flower Fables." Her\r\nfirst novel, "Moods," appeared in 1865. "Little Women," published in 1868,\r\nis a picture of her own home life. "An Old Fashioned Girl," from which\r\nthis extract is adapted, was published in 1870, and is one of her most\r\npopular books.\r\n\r\n1. Polly hoped the "dreadful boy" (Tom) would not be present; but he was,\r\nand stared at her all dinner time in a most trying manner.\r\n\r\n2. Mr. Shaw, a busy-looking gentleman, said, "How do you do, my dear? Hope\r\nyou\'ll enjoy yourself;" and then appeared to forget her entirely. Mrs.\r\nShaw, a pale, nervous woman, greeted her little guest kindly, and took\r\ncare that she wanted for nothing.\r\n\r\n3. Madam Shaw, a quiet old lady, with an imposing cap, exclaimed, on\r\nseeing Polly, "Bless my heart! the image of her mother--a sweet woman--how\r\nis she, dear?" and kept peering at the newcomer over her glasses till,\r\nbetween Madam and Tom, poor Polly lost her appetite.\r\n\r\n4. Her cousin Fanny chatted like a magpie, and little Maud fidgeted, till\r\nTom proposed to put her under the big dish cover, which produced such an\r\nexplosion that the young lady was borne screaming away by the\r\nmuch-enduring nurse.\r\n\r\n5. It was, altogether, an uncomfortable dinner, and Polly was very glad\r\nwhen it was over. They all went about their own affairs; and, after doing\r\nthe honors of the house, Fan was called to the dressmaker, leaving Polly\r\nto amuse herself in the great drawing-room.\r\n\r\n6. Polly was glad to be alone for a few minutes; and, having examined all\r\nthe pretty things about her, began to walk up and down over the soft,\r\nflowery carpet, humming to herself, as the daylight faded, and only the\r\nruddy glow of the fire filled the room.\r\n\r\n7. Presently Madam came slowly in, and sat down in her armchair, saying,\r\n"That\'s a fine old tune; sing it to me, my dear. I have n\'t heard it this\r\nmany a day."\r\n\r\n8. Polly did n\'t like to sing before strangers, for she had no teaching\r\nbut such as her busy mother could give her; but she had been taught the\r\nutmost respect for old people, and, having no reason for refusing, she\r\ndirectly went to the piano and did as she was bid.\r\n\r\n9. "That\'s the sort of music it\'s a pleasure to hear. Sing some more,\r\ndear," said Madam, in her gentle way, when she had done.\r\n\r\n10. Pleased with this praise, Polly sang away in a fresh little voice that\r\nwent straight to the listener\'s heart and nestled there. The sweet old\r\ntunes that one is never tired of were all Polly\'s store. The more she\r\nsung, the better she did it; and when she wound up with "A Health to King\r\nCharlie," the room quite rung with the stirring music made by the big\r\npiano and the little maid.\r\n\r\n11. "That\'s a jolly tune! Sing it again, please," cried Tom\'s voice; and\r\nthere was Tom\'s red head bobbing up over the high back of the chair where\r\nhe had hidden himself.\r\n\r\n12. It gave Polly quite a turn, for she thought no one was hearing her but\r\nthe old lady dozing by the fire. "I can\'t sing any more; I\'m tired," she\r\nsaid, and walked away to Madam in the other room. The red head vanished\r\nlike a meteor, for Polly\'s tone had been decidedly cool.\r\n\r\n13. The old lady put out her hand, and, drawing Polly to her knee, looked\r\ninto her face with such kind eyes that Polly forgot the impressive cap,\r\nand smiled at her confidently; for she saw that her simple music had\r\npleased her listener, and she felt glad to know it.\r\n\r\n14. "You mus\'n\'t mind my staring, dear," said Madam, softly pinching her\r\nrosy cheek, "I haven\'t seen a little girl for so long, it does my old eyes\r\ngood to look at you." Polly thought that a very odd speech, and could n\'t\r\nhelp saying, "Are n\'t Fan and Maud little girls, too?"\r\n\r\n15. "Oh, dear, no! not what I call little girls. Fan has been a young lady\r\nthis two years, and Maud is a spoiled baby. Your mother\'s a very sensible\r\nwoman, my child."\r\n\r\n16. "What a queer old lady!" thought Polly; but she said "Yes\'m,"\r\nrespectfully, and looked at the fire. "You don\'t understand what I mean,\r\ndo you?" asked Madam, still holding her by the chin. "No\'m; not quite."\r\n\r\n17. "Well, dear, I\'ll tell you. In my day, children of fourteen and\r\nfifteen did n\'t dress in the height of the fashion; go to parties as\r\nnearly like those of grown people as it\'s possible to make them; lead\r\nidle, giddy, unhealthy lives, and get blase\' at twenty. We were little\r\nfolks till eighteen or so; worked and studied, dressed and played, like\r\nchildren; honored our parents; and our days were much longer in the land\r\nthan now, it seems to me."\r\n\r\n18. The old lady appeared to forget Polly, at the end of her speech; for\r\nshe sat patting the plump little hand that lay in her own, and looking up\r\nat a faded picture of an old gentleman with a ruffled shirt and a queue.\r\n"Was he your father, Madam?"\r\n\r\n19. "Yes, my dear; my honored father. I did up his frills to the day of\r\nhis death; and the first money I ever earned, was five dollars which he\r\noffered as a prize to whichever of his six girls would lay the handsomest\r\ndarn in his silk stockings."\r\n\r\n20. "How proud you must have been!" cried Polly, leaning on the old lady\'s\r\nknee with an interested face.\r\n\r\n21. "Yes; and we all learned to make bread, and cook, and wore little\r\nchintz gowns, and were as gay and hearty as kittens. All lived to be\r\ngrandmothers; and I\'m the last--seventy next birthday, my dear, and not\r\nworn out yet; though daughter Shaw is an invalid at forty."\r\n\r\n22. "That\'s the way I was brought up, and that\'s why Fan calls me\r\nold-fashioned, I suppose. Tell more about your papa, please; I like it,"\r\nsaid Polly.\r\n\r\n23. "Say, \'father.\' We never called him papa; and if one of my brothers\r\nhad addressed him as \'governor,\' as boys now do, I really think he\'d have\r\nhim cut off with a shilling."\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--3. Im-pos\'ing, having the power of exciting attention and\r\nfeeling, impressive. 4. Mag\'pie, a noisy, mischievous bird, common in\r\nEurope and America. 12. Van\'ished, disappeared.

Such beautiful, beautiful hands!\r\n     They\'re neither white nor small;\r\n   And you, I know, would scarcely think\r\n     That they are fair at all.\r\n   I\'ve looked on hands whose form and hue\r\n     A sculptor\'s dream might be;\r\n   Yet are those aged, wrinkled hands\r\n     More beautiful to me.\r\n\r\n2. Such beautiful, beautiful hands!\r\n     Though heart were weary and sad,\r\n   Those patient hands kept toiling on,\r\n     That the children might be glad.\r\n   I always weep, as, looking back\r\n     To childhood\'s distant day,\r\n   I think how those hands rested not\r\n     When mine were at their play.\r\n\r\n3. Such beautiful, beautiful hands!\r\n     They\'re growing feeble now,\r\n   For time and pain have left their mark\r\n     On hands and heart and brow.\r\n   Alas! alas! the nearing time,\r\n     And the sad, sad day to me,\r\n   When \'neath the daisies, out of sight,\r\n     These hands will folded be.\r\n\r\n4. But oh! beyond this shadow land,\r\n     Where all is bright and fair,\r\n   I know full well these dear old hands\r\n     Will palms of victory bear;\r\n   Where crystal streams through endless years\r\n     Flow over golden sands,\r\n   And where the old grow young again,\r\n     I\'ll clasp my mother\'s hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIII. THE DISCONTENTED PENDULUM.\r\n\r\nJane Taylor (b. 1783, d. 1824) was born in London. Her mother was a writer\r\nof some note. In connection with her sister Ann, Jane Taylor wrote several\r\njuvenile works of more than ordinary excellence. Among them were "Hymns\r\nfor Infant Minds" and "Original Poems." Besides these, she wrote "Display,\r\na Tale," "Essays in Rhyme," and "Contributions of QQ." Her writings are\r\ngraceful, and often contain a useful moral.\r\n\r\n1. An old dock that had stood for fifty years in a farmer\'s kitchen,\r\nwithout giving its owner any cause of complaint, early one summer\'s\r\nmorning, before the family was stirring, suddenly stopped. Upon this, the\r\ndial plate (if we may credit the fable) changed countenance with alarm;\r\nthe hands made a vain effort to continue their course; the wheels remained\r\nmotionless with surprise; the weights hung speechless; and each member\r\nfelt disposed to lay the blame on the others. At length the dial\r\ninstituted a formal inquiry as to the cause of the stagnation, when hands,\r\nwheels, weights, with one voice, protested their innocence.\r\n\r\n2. But now a faint tick was heard below from the pendulum, who spoke thus:\r\n"I confess myself to be the sole cause of the present stoppage; and I am\r\nwilling, for the general satisfaction, to assign my reasons. The truth is,\r\nthat I am tired of ticking." Upon hearing this, the old clock became so\r\nenraged that it was upon the very point of striking. "Lazy wire!"\r\nexclaimed the dial plate, holding up its bands.\r\n\r\n3. "Very good!" replied the pendulum; "it is vastly easy for you, Mistress\r\nDial, who have always, as everybody knows, set yourself up above me,--it\r\nis vastly easy for you, I say, to accuse other people of laziness! you who\r\nhave had nothing to do all your life but to stare people in the face, and\r\nto amuse yourself with watching all that goes on in the kitchen. Think, I\r\nbeseech you, how you would like to be shut up for life in this dark\r\ncloset, and to wag backward and forward year after year, as I do."\r\n\r\n4. "As to that," said the dial, "is there not a window in your house on\r\npurpose for you to look through?" "For all that," resumed the pendulum,\r\n"it is very dark here; and, although there is a window, I dare not stop\r\neven for an instant to look out at it. Besides, I am really tired of my\r\nway of life; and, if you wish, I\'ll tell you how I took this disgust at my\r\nemployment. I happened, this morning, to be calculating how many times I\r\nshould have to tick in the course of only the next twenty-four hours;\r\nperhaps some one of you above there can give me the exact sum."\r\n\r\n5. The minute hand, being quick at figures, presently replied, "Eighty-six\r\nthousand four hundred times." "Exactly so," replied the pendulum. "Well, I\r\nappeal to you all, if the very thought of this was not enough to fatigue\r\nanyone; and when I began to multiply the strokes of one day by those of\r\nmonths and years, really it was no wonder if I felt discouraged at the\r\nprospect. So, after a great deal of reasoning and hesitation, thinks I to\r\nmyself, I\'ll stop."\r\n\r\n6. The dial could scarcely keep its countenance during this harangue; but,\r\nresuming its gravity, thus replied: "Dear Mr. Pendulum, I am really\r\nastonished that such a useful, industrious person as yourself should have\r\nbeen seized by this sudden weariness. It is true, you have done a great\r\ndeal of work in your time; so have we all, and are likely to do; which,\r\nalthough it may fatigue us to think of, the question is, whether it will\r\nfatigue us to do. Would you now do me the favor to give about half a dozen\r\nstrokes to illustrate my argument?"\r\n\r\n7. The pendulum complied, and ticked six times at its usual pace. "Now,"\r\nresumed the dial, "may I be allowed to inquire if that exertion is at all\r\nfatiguing or disagreeable to you?" "Not in the least," replied the\r\npendulum; "it is not of six strokes that I complain, nor of sixty, but of\r\nmillions."\r\n\r\n8. "Very good," replied the dial; "but recollect that, although\r\nyou may think of a million of strokes in an instant, you are\r\nrequired to execute but one; and that, however often you may\r\nhereafter have to swing, a moment will always be given you to\r\nswing in." "That consideration staggers me, I confess," said the\r\npendulum. "Then I hope," resumed the dial plate, "that we shall all\r\nreturn to our duty immediately; for the maids will be in bed if we\r\nstand idling thus."\r\n\r\n9. Upon this, the weights, who had never been accused of light conduct,\r\nused all their influence in urging him to proceed; when, as if with one\r\nconsent, the wheels began to turn, the hands began to move, the pendulum\r\nbegan to swing, and, to its credit, ticked as loud as ever; while a red\r\nbeam of the rising sun, that streamed through a hole in the kitchen,\r\nshining full upon the dial plate, it brightened up as if nothing had been\r\nthe matter.\r\n\r\n10. When the farmer came down to breakfast that morning, upon looking at\r\nthe clock, he declared that his watch had gained half an hour in the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1. In\'sti-tut-ed, commenced, began. Pro-test\'ed, solemnly\r\ndeclared. 4. Cal\'cu-lat-ing, reckoning, computing. 5. Pros\'pect,\r\nanticipation, that to which one looks forward. 6. Ha-rangue\' (pro.\r\nha-rang\'), speech. Il-lus\'trate, to make clear, to exemplify. 7.\r\nEx-er\'tion (pro. egz-er\'shun), effort. 8. Ex\'e-eute, to complete, to\r\nfinish. Con-sid-er-a\'tion, reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIV. THE DEATH OF THE FLOWERS.\r\n\r\nWilliam Cullen Bryant (b. 1794, d. 1878) was born in Cummington, Mass. He\r\nentered Williams College at the age of sixteen, but was honorably\r\ndismissed at the end of two years. At the age of twenty-one he was\r\nadmitted to the bar, and practiced his profession successfully for nine\r\nyears. In 1826 he removed to New York, and became connected with the\r\n"Evening Post"--a connection which continued to the time of his death. His\r\nresidence for more than thirty of the last years of his life was at\r\nRoslyn, Long Island. He visited Europe several times; and in 1849 he\r\ncontinued his travels into Egypt and Syria, In all his poems, Mr. Bryant\r\nexhibits a remarkable love for, and a careful study of, nature. His\r\nlanguage, both in prose and verse, is always chaste, correct, and elegant.\r\n"Thanatopsis," perhaps the best known of all his poems, was written when\r\nhe was but nineteen. His excellent translations of the "Iliad" and the\r\n"Odyssey" of Homer and some of his best poems, were written after he had\r\npassed the age of seventy. He retained his powers and his activity till\r\nthe close of his life.\r\n\r\n1. The melancholy days are come,\r\n     The saddest of the year,\r\n   Of wailing winds, and naked woods,\r\n     And meadows brown and sear.\r\n   Heaped in the hollows of the grove\r\n     The autumn leaves lie dead;\r\n   They rustle to the eddying gust,\r\n     And to the rabbit\'s tread.\r\n   The robin and the wren are flown,\r\n     And from the shrubs the jay,\r\n   And from the wood top calls the crow\r\n     Through all the gloomy day.\r\n\r\n2. Where are the flowers, the fair young flowers,\r\n     That lately sprang and stood\r\n   In brighter light and softer airs,\r\n     A beauteous sisterhood?\r\n   Alas! they all are in their graves;\r\n     The gentle race of flowers\r\n   Are lying in their lowly beds\r\n     With the fair and good of ours.\r\n   The rain is falling where they lie;\r\n     But the cold November rain\r\n   Calls not from out the gloomy earth\r\n     The lovely ones again.\r\n\r\n3. The windflower and the violet,\r\n     They perished long ago,\r\n   And the brier rose and the orchis died\r\n     Amid the summer\'s glow;\r\n   But on the hill, the golden-rod,\r\n     And the aster in the wood,\r\n   And the yellow sunflower by the brook,\r\n     In autumn beauty stood,\r\n   Till fell the frost from the clear, cold heaven,\r\n     As falls the plague on men,\r\n   And the brightness of their smile was gone\r\n     From upland, glade, and glen,\r\n\r\n4. And now, when comes the calm, mild day,\r\n     As still such days will come,\r\n   To call the squirrel and the bee\r\n     From out their winter home;\r\n   When the sound of dropping nuts is heard,\r\n     Though all the trees are still,\r\n   And twinkle in the smoky light\r\n     The waters of the rill,\r\n   The south wind searches for the flowers\r\n     Whose fragrance late he bore,\r\n   And sighs to find them in the wood\r\n     And by the stream no more.\r\n\r\n5. And then I think of one, who in\r\n     Her youthful beauty died,\r\n   The fair, meek blossom that grew up\r\n     And faded by my side.\r\n   In the cold, moist earth we laid her,\r\n     When the forest cast the leaf,\r\n   And we wept that one so lovely\r\n     Should have a life so brief;\r\n   Yet not unmeet it was that one,\r\n     Like that young friend of ours,\r\n   So gentle and so beautiful,\r\n     Should perish with the flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Wail\'ing, lamenting, mourning. Sear, dry, withered. 3.\r\nGlade, an open place in the forest. Glen, a valley, a dale. 4. Un-meet\',\r\nimproper, unfitting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXV. THE THUNDERSTORM.\r\n\r\nWashington Irving (b. 1783, d. 1859). This distinguished author, whose\r\nworks have enriched American literature, was born in the city of New York.\r\nHe had an ordinary school education, and began his literary career at the\r\nage of nineteen, by writing for a paper published by his brother. His\r\nfirst book, "Salmagundi," was published in 1807. Two years later he\r\npublished "Knickerbocker\'s History of New York." In 1815 he sailed for\r\nEurope, and remained abroad seventeen years, during which time he wrote\r\nseveral of his works. From 1842 to 1846 he was minister to Spain. The last\r\nyears of his life were passed at "Sunnyside," near Tarrytown, N.Y. He was\r\nnever married. "The Life of Washington," his last work, was completed in\r\nthe same year in which he died. Mr. Irving\'s works are characterized by\r\nhumor, chaste sentiment, and elegance and correctness of expression. The\r\nfollowing selection is from "Dolph" in "Bracehridge Hall."\r\n\r\n1. In the second day of the voyage, they came to the Highlands. It was the\r\nlatter part of a calm, sultry day, that they floated gently with the tide\r\nbetween these stern mountains. There was that perfect quiet which prevails\r\nover nature in the languor of summer heat. The turning of a plank, or the\r\naccidental falling of an oar, on deck, was echoed from the mountain side\r\nand reverberated along the shores; and, if by chance the captain gave a\r\nshout of command, there were airy tongues that mocked it from every cliff.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Dolph gazed about him, in mute delight and wonder, at these scenes of\r\nnature\'s magnificence. To the left, the Dunderberg reared its woody\r\nprecipices, height over height, forest over forest, away into the deep\r\nsummer sky. To the right, strutted forth the bold promontory of Antony\'s\r\nNose, with a solitary eagle wheeling about it; while beyond, mountain\r\nsucceeded to mountain, until they seemed to lock their arms together and\r\nconfine this mighty rive in their embraces.\r\n\r\n3. In the midst of this admiration, Dolph remarked a pile of bright, snowy\r\nclouds peering above the western heights. It was succeeded by another, and\r\nanother, each seemingly pushing onward its predecessor, and towering, with\r\ndazzling brilliancy, in the deep blue atmosphere; and now muttering peals\r\nof thunder were faintly heard rolling behind the mountains. The river,\r\nhitherto still and glassy, reflecting pictures of the sky and land, now\r\nshowed a dark ripple at a distance, as the wind came creeping up it. The\r\nfishhawks wheeled and screamed, and sought their nests on the high, dry\r\ntrees; the crows flew clamorously to the crevices of the rocks; and all\r\nnature seemed conscious of the approaching thunder gust.\r\n\r\n4. The clouds now rolled in volumes over the mountain tops; their summits\r\nstill bright and snowy, but the lower parts of an inky blackness. The rain\r\nbegan to patter down in broad and scattered drops; the wind freshened, and\r\ncurled up the waves; at length, it seemed as if the bellying clouds were\r\ntorn open by the mountain tops, and complete torrents of rain came\r\nrattling down. The lightning leaped from cloud to cloud, and streamed\r\nquivering against the rocks, splitting and rending the stoutest forest\r\ntrees. The thunder burst in tremendous explosions; the peals were echoed\r\nfrom mountain to mountain; they crashed upon Dunderberg, and then rolled\r\nup the long defile of the Highlands, each headland making a new echo,\r\nuntil old Bull Hill seemed to bellow back the storm.\r\n\r\n5. For a time the scudding rack and mist and the sheeted rain almost hid\r\nthe landscape from the sight. There was a fearful gloom, illumined still\r\nmore fearfully by the streams of lightning which glittered among the\r\nraindrops. Never had Dolph beheld such an absolute warring of the\r\nelements; it seemed as if the storm was tearing and rending its way\r\nthrough the mountain defile, and had brought all the artillery of heaven\r\ninto action.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Lan\'guor (pro. lang\'gwer), exhaustion of strength,\r\ndullness. 3. Re-marked\', noticed, observed. Pred-e-ces\'-sor, the one going\r\nimmediately before. Clam\'or-ous-ly, with a loud noise. 4. Bel\'ly-ing,\r\nswelling out. De-file\', a long, narrow pass. 5. Rack, thin, flying, broken\r\nclouds. El\'e-ments, a term usually including fire, water, earth, and air.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--1. The Highlands are a mountainous region in New York, bordering\r\nthe Hudson River above Peekskill.\r\n\r\n2. The Dunderberg and Antony\'s Nose are names of two peaks of the\r\nHighlands.\r\n\r\n4. Bull Hill, also called Mt. Taurus, is 15 miles farther north.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVI. APRIL DAY.\r\n\r\nCaroline Anne Southey (b. 1786, d.1854), the second wife of Southey the\r\npoet, and better known as Caroline Bowles, was born near Lymington,\r\nHampshire, England. Her first work, "Ellen Fitzarthur," a poem, was\r\npublished in 1820; and for more than twenty years her writings were\r\npublished anonymously. In 1839 she was married to Mr. Southey, and\r\nsurvived him over ten years. Her poetry is graceful in expression, and\r\nfull of tenderness, though somewhat melancholy. The following extract\r\nfirst appeared in 1822 in a collection entitled, "The Widow\'s Tale, and\r\nother Poems."\r\n\r\n1. All day the low-hung clouds have dropped\r\n     Their garnered fullness down;\r\n   All day that soft, gray mist hath wrapped\r\n     Hill, valley, grove, and town.\r\n\r\n2. There has not been a sound to-day\r\n     To break the calm of nature;\r\n   Nor motion, I might almost say,\r\n     Of life or living creature;\r\n\r\n3. Of waving bough, or warbling bird,\r\n     Or cattle faintly lowing;\r\n   I could have half believed I heard\r\n     The leaves and blossoms growing.\r\n\r\n4. I stood to hear--I love it well--\r\n     The rain\'s continuous sound;\r\n   Small drops, but thick and fast they fell,\r\n     Down straight into the ground.\r\n\r\n5. For leafy thickness is not yet\r\n     Earth\'s naked breast to screen,\r\n   Though every dripping branch is set\r\n     With shoots of tender green.\r\n\r\n6. Sure, since I looked, at early morn,\r\n     Those honeysuckle buds\r\n   Have swelled to double growth; that thorn\r\n     Hath put forth larger studs.\r\n\r\n7. That lilac\'s cleaving cones have burst,\r\n     The milk-white flowers revealing;\r\n   Even now upon my senses first\r\n     Methinks their sweets are stealing.\r\n\r\n8. The very earth, the steamy air,\r\n     Is all with fragrance rife!\r\n   And grace and beauty everywhere\r\n     Are flushing into life.\r\n\r\n9. Down, down they come, those fruitful stores,\r\n     Those earth-rejoicing drops!\r\n   A momentary deluge pours,\r\n     Then thins, decreases, stops.\r\n\r\n10. And ere the dimples on the stream\r\n      Have circled out of sight,\r\n    Lo! from the west a parting gleam\r\n      Breaks forth of amber light.\r\n\r\n* * * * * * *\r\n\r\n11. But yet behold--abrupt and loud,\r\n      Comes down the glittering rain;\r\n    The farewell of a passing cloud,\r\n      The fringes of its train.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Gar\'nered, laid up, treasured. 6. Studs, knobs, buds. 7.\r\nCleav\'ing, dividing. 10. Dim\'ples, small depressions. Am\'ber, the color of\r\namber, yellow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVII. THE TEA ROSE.\r\n\r\n1. There it stood, in its little green vase, on a light ebony stand in the\r\nwindow of the drawing-room. The rich satin curtains, with their costly\r\nfringes, swept down on either side of it, and around it glittered every\r\nrare and fanciful trifle which wealth can offer to luxury, and yet that\r\nsimple rose was the fairest of them all. So pure it looked, its white\r\nleaves just touched with that delicious, creamy tint peculiar to its kind:\r\nits cup so full, so perfect its head bending, as if it were sinking and\r\nmelting away in its own richness.--Oh! when did ever man make anything to\r\nequal the living, perfect flower!\r\n\r\n2. But the sunlight that streamed through the window    revealed something\r\nfairer than the rose--a young lady reclining on an ottoman, who was thus\r\naddressed by her livelier cousin: "I say, cousin, I have been thinking\r\nwhat you are to do with your pet rose when you go to New York; as, to our\r\nconsternation, you are determined to do. You know it would be a sad pity\r\nto leave it with such a scatter-brain as I am. I love flowers,\r\nindeed,--that is, I like a regular bouquet, cut off and tied up, to carry\r\nto a party; but as to all this tending and fussing which is needful to\r\nkeep them growing, I have no gifts in that line."\r\n\r\n3. "Make yourself easy as to that, Kate," said Florence, with a\r\nsmile; "I have no intention of calling upon your talent; I have an\r\nasylum in view for my favorite."\r\n\r\n4. "Oh, then you know just what I was going to say. Mrs. Marshall, I\r\npresume, has been speaking to you; she was here yesterday, and I was quite\r\npathetic upon the subject; telling her the loss your favorite would\r\nsustain, and so forth; and she said how delighted she would be to have it\r\nin her greenhouse; it is in such a fine state now, so full of buds. I told\r\nher I knew you would like to give it to her; you are so fond of Mrs.\r\nMarshall, you know."\r\n\r\n5. "Now, Kate, I am sorry, but I have otherwise engaged."\r\n\r\n"Whom can it be to? you have so few intimates here."\r\n\r\n"Oh, it is only one of my odd fancies."\r\n\r\n"But do tell me, Florence."\r\n\r\n"Well, cousin, you know the little pale girl to whom we give sewing?"\r\n\r\n6. "What! little Mary Stephens? How absurd, Florence! This is just another\r\nof your motherly, old-maidish ways; dressing dolls for poor children,\r\nmaking bonnets, and knitting socks for all the little dirty babies in the\r\nneighborhood. I do believe you have made more calls in those two vile,\r\nill-smelling alleys behind our house than ever you have in Chestnut\r\nStreet, though you know everybody is half dying to see you; and now, to\r\ncrown all, you must give this choice little bijou to a seamstress girl,\r\nwhen one of your most intimate friends, in your own class, would value it\r\nso highly. What in the world can people in their circumstances want with\r\nflowers?"\r\n\r\n7. "Just the same as I do," replied Florence, calmly. "Have you not\r\nnoticed that the little girl never comes without looking wistfully at the\r\nopening buds? And don\'t you remember, the other morning she asked me so\r\nprettily if I would let her mother come and see it, she was so fond of\r\nflowers?"\r\n\r\n8. "But, Florence, only think of this rare flower standing on a table with\r\nham, eggs, cheese, and flour, and stifled in that close little room, where\r\nMrs. Stephens and her daughter manage to wash, iron, and cook."\r\n\r\n9. "Well, Kate, and if I were obliged to live in one coarse room, and\r\nwash, and iron, and cook, as you say; if I had to spend every moment of my\r\ntime in toil, with no prospect from my window but a brick wall and a dirty\r\nlane, such a flower as this would be untold enjoyment to me."\r\n\r\n10. "Pshaw, Florence; all sentiment! Poor people have no time to be\r\nsentimental. Besides, I don\'t believe it will grow with them; it is a\r\ngreenhouse flower, and used to delicate living."\r\n\r\n11. "Oh, as to that, a flower never inquires whether its owner is rich or\r\npoor; and poor Mrs. Stephens, whatever else she has not, has sunshine of\r\nas good quality as this that streams through our window. The beautiful\r\nthings that God makes are his gifts to all alike. You will see that my\r\nfair rose will be as well and cheerful in Mrs. Stephens\'s room as in\r\nours."\r\n\r\n12. "Well, after all, how odd! When one gives to poor people, one wants to\r\ngive them something useful--a bushel of potatoes, a ham, and such things."\r\n\r\n13. "Why, certainly, potatoes and ham must be supplied; but, having\r\nministered to the first and most craving wants, why not add any other\r\nlittle pleasures or gratifications we may have it in our power to bestow?\r\nI know there are many of the poor who have fine feeling and a keen sense\r\nof the beautiful, which rusts out and dies because they are too hard\r\npressed to procure it any gratification. Poor Mrs. Stephens, for example;\r\nI know she would enjoy birds, and flowers, and music as much as I do. I\r\nhave seen her eye light up as she looked upon these things in our drawing.\r\nroom, and yet not one beautiful thing can she command. From necessity, her\r\nroom, her clothing,--all she has, must be coarse and plain. You should\r\nhave seen the almost rapture she and Mary felt when I offered them my\r\nrose."\r\n\r\n14. "Dear me! all this may be true, but I never thought of it before. I\r\nnever thought that these hard-working people had any ideas of taste!"\r\n\r\n15. "Then why do you see the geranium or rose so carefully nursed in the\r\nold cracked teapot in the poorest room, or the morning-glory planted in a\r\nbox and twined about the window? Do not these show that the human heart\r\nyearns for the beautiful in all ranks of life? You remember, Kate, how our\r\nwasherwoman sat up a whole night, after a hard day\'s work, to make her\r\nfirst baby a pretty dress to be baptized in." "Yes, and I remember how I\r\nlaughed at you for making such a tasteful little cap for it."\r\n\r\n16. "True, Kate, but I think the look of perfect delight with which the\r\npoor woman regarded her baby in its new dress and cap was something quite\r\nworth creating; I do believe she could not have felt more grateful if 1\r\nhad sent her a barrel of flour."\r\n\r\n17. "Well, I never thought before of giving anything to the poor but what\r\nthey really needed, and I have always been willing to do that when I could\r\nwithout going far out of my way."\r\n\r\n18. "Ah! cousin, if our heavenly Father gave to us after this mode, we\r\nshould have only coarse, shapeless piles of provisions lying about the\r\nworld, instead of all this beautiful variety of trees, and fruits, and\r\nflowers,"\r\n\r\n19. "Well, well, cousin, I suppose you are right, but have mercy on my\r\npoor head; it is too small to hold so many new ideas all at once, so go on\r\nyour own way;" and the little lady began practicing a waltzing step before\r\nthe glass with great satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--2. Ot\'to-man, a stuffed seat without a back. 3. A-sy\'lum, a\r\nplace of refuge and protection. 4. Pa-thet\'ic, moving to pity or grief. 6.\r\nBi-jou\' (pro. be-zhoo\'), a jewel.

THE CATARACT OF LODORE.\r\n\r\n1. "How does the water\r\n   Come down at Lodore?"\r\n   My little boy asked me\r\n     Thus once on a time;\r\n   And, moreover, he tasked me\r\n     To tell him in rhyme.\r\n\r\n2. Anon at the word,\r\n   There first came one daughter,\r\n   And then came another,\r\n     To second and third\r\n   The request of their brother,\r\n   And to hear how the water\r\n     Comes down at Lodore,\r\n     With its rush and its roar,\r\n       As many a time\r\n    They had seen it before.\r\n\r\n3. So I told them in rhyme,\r\n   For of rhymes I had store,\r\n     And \'t was in my vocation\r\n     For their recreation\r\n   That so I should sing;\r\n   Because I was Laureate\r\n   To them and the King.\r\n\r\n4. From its sources which well\r\n   In the tarn on the fell;\r\n   From its fountains\r\n   In the mountains,\r\nIts rills and its gills;\r\n  Through moss and through brake,\r\n    It runs and it creeps\r\n    For a while, till it sleeps\r\n  In its own little lake.\r\n\r\n5. And thence at departing,\r\n   Awakening and starting,\r\n   It runs through the reeds,\r\n   And away it proceeds,\r\n   Through meadow and glade,\r\n   In sun and in shade,\r\n   And through the wood shelter,\r\n     Among crags in its flurry,\r\n   Helter-skelter,\r\n     Hurry-skurry.\r\n\r\n6. Here it comes sparkling,\r\n   And there it lies darkling;\r\n   Now smoking and frothing\r\n   Its tumult and wrath in,\r\n   Till, in this rapid race\r\n     On which it is bent,\r\n   It reaches the place\r\n     Of its steep descent.\r\n\r\n7. The cataract strong\r\n   Then plunges along,\r\n   Striking and raging\r\n   As if a war waging\r\nIts caverns and rocks among;\r\n\r\n8. Rising and leaping,\r\n   Sinking and creeping,\r\n   Swelling and sweeping,\r\n   Showering and springing,\r\n   Flying and flinging,\r\n   Writhing and ringing,\r\n   Eddying and whisking,\r\n   Spouting and frisking,\r\n   Turning and twisting,\r\n   Around and around\r\n   With endless rebound;\r\n   Smiting and fighting,\r\n   A sight to delight in;\r\n   Confounding, astounding,\r\nDizzying, and deafening the ear with its sound\r\n\r\n9. Collecting, projecting,\r\n  Receding and speeding,\r\n  And shocking and rocking,\r\n  And darting and parting,\r\n  And threading and spreading,\r\n  And whizzing and hissing,\r\n  And dripping and skipping,\r\n  And hitting and splitting,\r\n  And shining and twining,\r\n  And rattling and battling,\r\n  And shaking and quaking,\r\n  And pouring and roaring,\r\n  And waving and raving,\r\n  And tossing and crossing,\r\n  And guggling and struggling,\r\n  And heaving and cleaving,\r\n  And moaning and groaning,\r\n  And glittering and frittering,\r\n  And gathering and feathering,\r\n  And whitening and brightening,\r\n  And quivering and shivering,\r\n  And hurrying and skurrying,\r\n  And thundering and floundering;\r\n\r\n10. Dividing and gliding and sliding,\r\n    And falling and brawling and sprawling,\r\n    And driving and riving and striving,\r\n    And sprinkling and twinkling and wrinkling;\r\n\r\n11. And thumping and plumping and bumping and jumping,\r\n    And dashing and flashing and splashing and clashing;\r\n    And so never ending, but always descending,\r\n    Sounds and motions forever and ever are blending,\r\n      All at once and all o\'er, with a mighty uproar,\r\n      And this way the water comes down at Lodore.\r\n                                      --Abridged from Southey.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--4. Tarn, a small lake among the mountains. Fell (provincial\r\nEnglish), a stony hill. Gills (provincial English), brooks. 10. Brawl\'ing,\r\nroaring. Riv\'ing, splitting.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--1. Lodore is a cascade on the banks of Lake Derwentwater, in\r\nCumberland, England, near where Southey lived.\r\n\r\n3. Laureate. The term probably arose from a custom in the English\r\nuniversities of presenting a laurel wreath to graduates in rhetoric and\r\nversification. In England the poet laureate\'s office is filled by\r\nappointment of the lord chamberlain. The salary is quite small, and the\r\noffice is valued chiefly as one of honor.\r\n\r\nThis lesson is peculiarly adapted for practice on the difficult sound\r\n"ing".\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIX. THE BOBOLINK.\r\n\r\n1. The happiest bird of our spring, however, and one that rivals the\r\nEuropean lark in my estimation, is the boblincoln, or bobolink as he is\r\ncommonly called. He arrives at that choice portion of our year which, in\r\nthis latitude, answers to the description of the month of May so often\r\ngiven by the poets. With us it begins about the middle of May, and lasts\r\nuntil nearly the middle of June. Earlier than this, winter is apt to\r\nreturn on its traces, and to blight the opening beauties of the year; and\r\nlater than this, begin the parching, and panting, and dissolving heats of\r\nsummer. But in this genial interval, Nature is in all her freshness and\r\nfragrance: "the rains are over and gone, the flowers appear upon the\r\nearth, the time of the singing of birds is come, and the voice of the\r\nturtle is heard in the land."\r\n\r\n2. The trees are now in their fullest foliage and brightest verdure; the\r\nwoods are gay with the clustered flowers of the laurel; the air is\r\nperfumed with the sweetbrier and the wild rose; the meadows are enameled\r\nwith clover blossoms; while the young apple, peach, and the plum begin to\r\nswell, and the cherry to glow among the green leaves.\r\n\r\n3. This is the chosen season of revelry of the bobolink. He comes amid the\r\npomp and fragrance of the season; his life seems all sensibility and\r\nenjoyment, all song and sunshine. He is to be found in the soft bosoms of\r\nthe freshest and sweetest meadows, and is most in song when the clover is\r\nin blossom. He perches on the topmost twig of a tree, or on some long,\r\nflaunting weed, and, as he rises and sinks with the breeze, pours forth a\r\nsuccession of rich, tinkling notes, crowding one upon another, like the\r\noutpouring melody of the skylark, and possessing the same rapturous\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n4. Sometimes he pitches from the summit of a tree, begins his song as soon\r\nas he gets upon the wing, and flutters tremulously down to the earth, as\r\nif overcome with ecstasy at his own music. Sometimes he is in pursuit of\r\nhis mate; always in full song, as if he would win her by his melody; and\r\nalways with the same appearance of intoxication and delight. Of all the\r\nbirds of our groves and meadows, the bobolink was the envy of my boyhood.\r\nHe crossed my path in the sweetest weather, and the sweetest season of the\r\nyear, when all nature called to the fields, and the rural feeling throbbed\r\nin every bosom; but when I, luckless urchin! was doomed to be mewed up,\r\nduring the live-long day, in a schoolroom.\r\n\r\n5. It seemed as if the little varlet mocked at me as he flew by in full\r\nsong, and sought to taunt me with his happier lot. Oh, how I envied him!\r\nNo lessons, no task, no school; nothing but holiday, frolic, green fields,\r\nand fine weather. Had I been then more versed in poetry, I might have\r\naddressed him in the words of Logan to the cuckoo:\r\n\r\n    "Sweet bird, thy bower is ever green,\r\n      Thy sky is ever clear;\r\n    Thou hast no sorrow in thy song,\r\n      No winter in thy year.\r\n\r\n    "Oh. could I fly, I\'d fly with thee!\r\n      We\'d make, with joyful wing,\r\n    Our annual visit o\'er the globe,\r\n      Companions of the spring."\r\n\r\n6. Further observation and experience have given me a different idea of\r\nthis feathered voluptuary, which I will venture to impart for the benefit\r\nof my young readers, who may regard him with the same unqualified envy and\r\nadmiration which I once indulged. I have shown him only as I saw him at\r\nfirst, in what I may call the poetical part of his career, when he, in a\r\nmanner, devoted himself to elegant pursuits and enjoyments, and was a bird\r\nof music, and song, and taste, and sensibility, and refinement. While this\r\nlasted he was sacred from injury; the very schoolboy would not fling a\r\nstone at him, and the merest rustic would pause to listen to his strain.\r\n\r\n7. But mark the difference. As the year advances, as the clover blossoms\r\ndisappear, and the spring fades into summer, he gradually gives up his\r\nelegant tastes and habits, doffs his poetical suit of black, assumes a\r\nrusset, dusty garb, and sinks to the gross enjoyment of common vulgar\r\nbirds. His notes no longer vibrate on the ear; he is stuffing himself with\r\nthe seeds of the tall weeds on which he lately swung and chanted so\r\nmelodiously. He has become a bon vivant, a gourmand: with him now there is\r\nnothing like the "joys of the table." In a little while he grows tired of\r\nplain, homely fare, and is off on a gastronomic tour in quest of foreign\r\nluxuries.\r\n\r\n8. We next hear of him, with myriads of his kind, banqueting among the\r\nreeds of the Delaware, and grown corpulent with good feeding. He has\r\nchanged his name in traveling. Boblincoln no more, he is the reedbird now,\r\nthe much-sought-for tidbit of Pennsylvanian epicures, the rival in unlucky\r\nfame of the ortolan! Wherever he goes, pop! pop! pop! every rusty firelock\r\nin the country is blazing away. He sees his companions falling by\r\nthousands around him. Does he take warning and reform? Alas! not he. Again\r\nhe wings his flight. The rice swamps of the south invite him. He gorges\r\nhimself among them almost to bursting; he can scarcely fly for corpulency.\r\nHe has once more changed his name, and is now the famous ricebird of the\r\nCarolinas. Last stage of his career: behold him spitted with dozens of his\r\ncorpulent companions, and served up, a vaunted dish, on some southern\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n9. Such is the story of the bobolink; once spiritual, musical,\r\nadmired, the joy of the meadows, and the favorite bird of spring; finally,\r\na gross little sensualist, who expiates his sensuality in the larder. His\r\nstory contains a moral worthy the attention of all little birds and little\r\nboys; warning them to keep to those refined and intellectual pursuits\r\nwhich raised him to so high a pitch of popularity during the early part of\r\nhis career, but to eschew all tendency to that gross and dissipated\r\nindulgence which brought this mistaken little bird to an untimely end.\r\n\r\n                                        --From Irving\'s "Birds of Spring."\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--En-am\'eled, coated with a smooth, glossy surface. 3.\r\nSen-si-bil\'i-ty, feeling. 4. Mewed, shut up. 5. Var\'let, a rascal. Versed,\r\nfamiliar, practiced. 6. Vo-lup\'tu-a-ry, one who makes his bodily enjoyment\r\nhis chief object. 7.

The ortolan is a\r\nsmall bird, abundant in southern Europe, Cyprus, and Japan. It is fattened\r\nfor the table, and is considered a great delicacy.\r\n\r\n\r\nXL. ROBERT OF LINCOLN.\r\n\r\n1. Merrily swinging on brier and weed,\r\n     Near to the nest of his little dame,\r\n   Over the mountain side or mead,\r\n     Robert of Lincoln is telling his name:\r\n       "Bobolink, bobolink,\r\n       Spink, spank, spink.\r\n   Snug and safe is that nest of ours.\r\n   Hidden among the summer flowers.\r\n              Chee, chee, chee."\r\n\r\n2. Robert of Lincoln is gaily dressed,\r\n     Wearing a bright black wedding coat:\r\n   White are his shoulders, and white his crest,\r\n     Hear him call in his merry note:\r\n       "Bobolink, bobolink,\r\n       Spink, spank, spink,\r\n   Look what a nice new coat is mine;\r\n   Sure, there was never a bird so fine.\r\n              Chee, chee, chee."\r\n\r\n3. Robert of Lincoln\'s Quaker wife,\r\n     Pretty and quiet, with plain brown wings,\r\n   Passing at home a patient life,\r\n     Broods in the grass while her husband sings:\r\n       "Bobolink, bobolink,\r\n       Spink, spank, spink,\r\n   Brood, kind creature; you need not fear\r\n   Thieves and robbers while I am here.\r\n              Chee, chee, chee."\r\n\r\n4. Modest and shy as a nun is she,\r\n     One weak chirp is her only note;\r\n   Braggart and prince of braggarts is he,\r\n     Pouring boasts from his little throat:\r\n       "Bobolink, Bobolink,\r\n       Spink, spank, spink,\r\n   Never was I afraid of man,\r\n   Catch me, cowardly knaves, if you can.\r\n              Chee, chee, chee."\r\n\r\n5. Six white eggs on a bed of hay,\r\n     Flecked with purple, a pretty sight!\r\n   There as the mother sits all day,\r\n     Robert is singing with all his might:\r\n      "Bobolink, bobolink,\r\n      Spink, spank, spink,\r\n   Nice good wife that never goes out,\r\n   Keeping house while I frolic about.\r\n              Chee, chee, chee."\r\n\r\n6. Soon as the little ones chip the shell,\r\n     Six wide mouths are open for food;\r\n   Robert of Lincoln bestirs him well,\r\n     Gathering seeds for the hungry brood..\r\n       "Bobolink, bobolink,\r\n       Spink, spank, spink,\r\n   This new life is likely to be\r\n   Hard for a gay young fellow like me.\r\n              Chee, chee, chee."\r\n\r\n7. Robert of Lincoln at length is made\r\n     Sober with work, and silent with care;\r\n   Off is his holiday garment laid,\r\n     Half forgotten that merry air:\r\n       "Bobolink, bobolink,\r\n       Spink, spank, spink,\r\n   Nobody knows but my mate and I\r\n   Where our nest and our nestlings lie.\r\n              Chee, chee, chee."\r\n\r\n8. Summer wanes; the children are grown;\r\n     Fun and frolic no more he knows;\r\n   Robert of Lincoln\'s a humdrum crone;\r\n     Off he flies, and we sing as he goes:\r\n       "Bobolink, bobolink,\r\n       Spink, spank, spink,\r\n   When you can pipe that merry old strain,\r\n   Robert of Lincoln, come back again.\r\n              Chee, chee, chee."\r\n\r\n                                            --William Cullen Bryan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLI. REBELLION IN MASSACHUSETTS STATE PRISON.\r\n\r\n1. A more impressive exhibition of moral courage, opposed to the wildest\r\nferocity under the most appalling circumstances, was never seen than that\r\nwhich was witnessed by the officers of our state prison; in the rebellion\r\nwhich occurred some years since.\r\n\r\n2. Three convicts had been sentenced, under the rules of the prison, to be\r\nwhipped in the yard, and, by some effort of one of the other prisoners, a\r\ndoor had been opened at midday communicating with the great dining hall\r\nand, through the warden\'s lodge, with the street.\r\n\r\n3. The dining hall was long, dark, and damp, from its situation near the\r\nsurface of the ground; and in this all the prisoners assembled, with clubs\r\nand such other tools as they could seize in passing through the workshops.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Knives, hammers, and chisels, with every variety of such weapons, were\r\nin the hands of the ferocious spirits, who are drawn away from their\r\nencroachments on society, forming a congregation of strength, vileness,\r\nand talent that can hardly be equaled on earth, even among the famed\r\nbrigands of Italy.\r\n\r\n5. Men of all ages and characters, guilty of every variety of infamous\r\ncrime, dressed in the motley and peculiar garb of the institution, and\r\ndisplaying the wild and demoniac appearance that always pertains to\r\nimprisoned wretches, were gathered together for the single purpose of\r\npreventing the punishment which was to be inflicted on the morrow upon\r\ntheir comrades.\r\n\r\n6. The warden, the surgeon, and some other officers of the prison were\r\nthere at the time, and were alarmed at the consequences likely to ensue\r\nfrom the conflict necessary to restore order. They huddled together, and\r\ncould scarcely be said to consult, as the stoutest among them lost all\r\npresence of mind in overwhelming fear. The news rapidly spread through the\r\ntown, and a subordinate officer, of the most mild and kind disposition,\r\nhurried to the scene, and came calm and collected into the midst of the\r\nofficers. The most equable-tempered and the mildest man in the government\r\nwas in this hour of peril the firmest.\r\n\r\n7. He instantly dispatched a request to Major Wainright, commander of the\r\nmarines stationed at the Navy Yard, for assistance, and declared his\r\npurpose to enter into the hall and try the force of firm demeanor and\r\npersuasion upon the enraged multitude.\r\n\r\n8. All his brethren exclaimed against an attempt so full of hazard, but in\r\nvain. They offered him arms, a sword and pistols, but he refused them, and\r\nsaid that he had no fear, and, in case of danger, arms would do him no\r\nservice; and alone, with only a little rattan, which was his usual walking\r\nstick, he advanced into the hall to hold parley with the selected,\r\ncongregated, and enraged villains of the whole commonwealth.\r\n\r\n9. He demanded their purpose in thus coming together with arms, in\r\nviolation of the prison laws. They replied that they were determined to\r\nobtain the remission of the punishment of their three comrades. He said it\r\nwas impossible; the rules of the prison must be obeyed, and they must\r\nsubmit.\r\n\r\n10. At the hint of submission they drew a little nearer together, prepared\r\ntheir weapons for service, and, as they were dimly seen in the further end\r\nof the hall by those who observed from the gratings that opened up to the\r\nday, a more appalling sight can not be conceived, nor one of more moral\r\ngrandeur, than that of the single man standing within their grasp, and\r\nexposed to be torn limb from limb instantly if a word or look should add\r\nto the already intense excitement.\r\n\r\n11. That excitement, too, was of a most dangerous kind. It broke not forth\r\nin noise and imprecations, but was seen only in the dark looks and the\r\nstrained nerves that showed a deep determination. The officer\r\nexpostulated. He reminded them of the hopelessness of escape; that the\r\ntown was alarmed, and that the government of the prison would submit to\r\nnothing but unconditional surrender. He said that all those who would go\r\nquietly away should be forgiven for this offense; but that if every\r\nprisoner were killed in the contest, power enough would be obtained to\r\nenforce the regulations of the prison.\r\n\r\n12. They replied that they expected that some would be killed,--that\r\ndeath would be better than such imprisonment; and, with that look and tone\r\nwhich bespeak an indomitable purpose, they declared that not a man should\r\nleave the hall alive till the flogging was remitted. At this period of the\r\ndiscussion their evil passions seemed to be more inflamed, and one or two\r\noffered to destroy the officer, who still stood firmer and with a more\r\ntemperate pulse than did his friends, who saw from above, but could not\r\navert, the danger that threatened him.\r\n\r\n13. Just at this moment, and in about fifteen minutes from the\r\ncommencement of the tumult, the officer saw the feet of the marines, on\r\nwhose presence alone he relied for succor, filing by the small upper\r\nlights. Without any apparent anxiety, he had repeatedly turned his\r\nattention to their approach; and now he knew that it was his only time to\r\nescape, before the conflict became, as was expected, one of the most dark\r\nand dreadful in the world.\r\n\r\n14. He stepped slowly backward, still urging them to depart before the\r\nofficers were driven to use the last resort of firearms. When within three\r\nor four feet of the door, it was opened, and closed instantly again as he\r\nsprang through, and was thus unexpectedly restored to his friends.\r\n\r\n15. Major Wainright was requested to order his men to fire down upon the\r\nconvicts through the little windows, first with powder and then with ball,\r\ntill they were willing to retreat; but he took a wiser as well as a bolder\r\ncourse, relying upon the effect which firm determination would have upon\r\nmen so critically situated. He ordered the door to be again opened, and\r\nmarched in at the head of twenty or thirty men, who filed through the\r\npassage, and formed at the end of the hall opposite to the crowd of\r\ncriminals huddled together at the other.\r\n\r\n16. He stated that he was empowered to quell the rebellion, that he wished\r\nto avoid shedding blood, but that he would not quit that hall alive till\r\nevery convict had returned to his duty. They seemed balancing the strength\r\nof the two parties, and replied that some of them were ready to die, and\r\nonly waited for an attack to see which was the more powerful; swearing\r\nthat they would fight to the last, unless the punishment was remitted, for\r\nthey would not submit to any such punishment in the prison. Major\r\nWainright ordered his marines to load their pieces, and, that they might\r\nnot be suspected of trifling, each man was made to hold up to view the\r\nbullet which he afterward put in his gun.\r\n\r\n17. This only caused a growl of determination, and no one blenched or\r\nseemed disposed to shrink from the foremost exposure. They knew that their\r\nnumber would enable them to bear down and destroy the handful of marines\r\nafter the first discharge, and before their pieces could be reloaded.\r\nAgain they were ordered to retire; but they answered with more ferocity\r\nthan ever. The marines were ordered to take their aim so as to be sure and\r\nkill as many as possible. Their guns were presented, but not a prisoner\r\nstirred, except to grasp more firmly his weapon.\r\n\r\n18. Still desirous to avoid such a tremendous slaughter as must have\r\nfollowed the discharge of a single gun, Major Wainright advanced a step or\r\ntwo, and spoke even more firmly than before, urging them to depart. Again,\r\nand while looking directly into the muzzles of the guns which they had\r\nseen loaded with ball, they declared their intention "to fight it out."\r\nThis intrepid officer then took out his watch, and told his men to hold\r\ntheir pieces aimed at the convicts, but not to fire till they had orders;\r\nthen, turning to the prisoners, he said: "You must leave this hall; I give\r\nyou three minutes to decide; if at the end of that time a man remains, he\r\nshall be shot dead."\r\n\r\n19. No situation of greater interest than this can be conceived. At one\r\nend of the hall, a fearful multitude of the most desperate and powerful\r\nmen in existence, waiting for the assault; at the other, a little band of\r\ndisciplined men, waiting with arms presented, and ready, upon the least\r\nmotion or sign, to begin the carnage; and their tall and imposing\r\ncommander, holding up his watch to count the lapse of three minutes, given\r\nas the reprieve to the lives of hundreds. No poet or painter can conceive\r\na spectacle of more dark and terrible sublimity; no human heart can\r\nconceive a situation of more appalling suspense.\r\n\r\n20. For two minutes not a person nor a muscle moved; not a sound was heard\r\nin the unwonted stillness of the prison, except the labored breathings of\r\nthe infuriated wretches, as they began to pant between fear and revenge:\r\nat the expiration of two minutes, during which they had faced the\r\nministers of death with unblenching eyes, two or three of those in the\r\nrear, and nearest the further entrance, went slowly out; a few more\r\nfollowed the example, dropping out quietly and deliberately: and before\r\nhalf of the last minute was gone, every man was struck by the panic, and\r\ncrowded for an exit, and the hall was cleared, as if by magic.\r\n\r\n21. Thus the steady firmness of moral force and the strong effect of\r\ndetermination, acting deliberately, awed the most savage men, and\r\nsuppressed a scene of carnage, which would have instantly followed the\r\nleast precipitancy or exertion of physical force.\r\n                                                     --J.

FAITHLESS NELLY GRAY.\r\n\r\nThomas Hood (b. 1798, d. 1845) was the son of a London bookseller. After\r\nleaving school he undertook to learn the art of an engraver, but soon\r\nturned his attention to literature. In 1821 he became sub-editor of the\r\n"London Magazine." Hood is best known as a humorist; but some of his poems\r\nare full of the tenderest pathos; and a gentle, humane spirit pervades\r\neven his lighter productions. He was poor, and during the last years of\r\nhis life suffered much from ill health. Some of his most humorous pieces\r\nwere written on a sick bed.\r\n\r\n1. Ben Battle was a soldier bold,\r\n     And used to war\'s alarms;\r\n   But a cannon ball took off his legs,\r\n     So he laid down his arms!\r\n\r\n2. Now, as they bore him off the field,\r\n     Said he, "Let others shoot,\r\n   For here I leave my second leg,\r\n     And the Forty-second Foot!"\r\n\r\n3. The army surgeons made him limbs;\r\n     Said he, "They\'re only pegs:\r\n   But there\'s as wooden members quite,\r\n     As represent my legs!"\r\n\r\n4. Now Ben, he loved a pretty maid,\r\n     Her Name was Nelly Gray;\r\n   So he went to pay her his devoirs,\r\n     When he\'d devoured his pay.\r\n\r\n5. But when he called on Nelly Gray,\r\n     She made him quite a scoff;\r\n   And when she saw his wooden legs,\r\n     Began to take them off!\r\n\r\n6. "O Nelly Gray! O Nelly Gray!\r\n     Is this your love so warm\'?\r\n   The love that loves a scarlet coat\r\n     Should be more uniform!"\r\n\r\n7. Said she, "I loved a soldier once,\r\n     For he was blithe and brave;\r\n   But I will never have a man\r\n     With both legs in the grave!\r\n\r\n8. "Before you had these timber toes,\r\n     Your love I did allow,\r\n   But then, you know, you stand upon\r\n     Another footing now!"\r\n\r\n9. "O false and fickle Nelly Gray!\r\n     I know why you refuse:\r\n   Though I\'ve no feet--some other man\r\n     Is standing in my shoes!\r\n\r\n10. "I wish I ne\'er had seen your face;\r\n      But, now, a long farewell!\r\n    For you will be my death;--alas!\r\n      You will not be my NELL!"\r\n\r\n11. Now when he went from Nelly Gray,\r\n      His heart so heavy got,\r\n    And life was such a burden grown,\r\n      It made him take a knot!\r\n\r\n12. So round his melancholy neck,\r\n      A rope he did entwine,\r\n    And for the second time in life.\r\n      Enlisted in the Line!\r\n\r\n13. One end he tied around a beam,\r\n      And then removed his pegs,\r\n    And, as his legs were off, of course\r\n      He soon was off his legs.\r\n\r\n14. And there he hung till he was dead\r\n      As any nail in town:\r\n    For, though distress had cut him up,\r\n      It could not cut him down!\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--4. De-voirs\' (French, pro, de-vwor\'), respects: compliments.\r\n5. Scoff, an object of ridicule. 6, U\'ni-form (adj.), consistent, (noun)\r\nmilitary dress. 7.

Members. Persons elected to Parliament in Great Britain are called\r\n"Members," and are said to represent those who elect them.\r\n\r\n12. The Line is another name for the regular infantry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIII. THE GENEROUS RUSSIAN PEASANT.\r\n\r\n1. Let Vergil sing the praises of Augustus, genius celebrate merit, and\r\nflattery extol the talents of the great. "The short and simple annals of\r\nthe poor" engross my pen; and while I record the history of Flor Silin\'s\r\nvirtues, though I speak of a poor peasant, I shall describe a noble man. I\r\nask no eloquence to assist me in the task; modest worth rejects the aid of\r\nornament to set it off.\r\n\r\n2. It is impossible, even at this distant period, to reflect without\r\nhorror on the miseries of that year known in Lower Volga by the name of\r\nthe "Famine Year." I remember the summer, whose scorching heats had dried\r\nup all the fields, and the drought had no relief but from the tears of the\r\nruined farmer.\r\n\r\n3. I remember the cold, comfortless autumn, and the despairing rustics,\r\ncrowding round their empty barns, with folded arms and sorrowful\r\ncountenances, pondering on their misery, instead of rejoicing, as usual,\r\nat the golden harvest. I remember the winter which succeeded, and I\r\nreflect with agony on the miseries it brought with it. Whole families left\r\ntheir homes to become beggars on the highway.\r\n\r\n4. At night the canopy of heaven served them as their only shelter from\r\nthe piercing winds and bitter frost. To describe these scenes would be to\r\nharm the feelings of my readers; therefore, to my tale. In those days I\r\nlived on an estate not far from Simbirsk; and, though but a child, I have\r\nnot forgotten the impression made on my mind by the general calamity.\r\n\r\n5. In a village adjoining lived Flor Silin, a poor, laboring peasant,--a\r\nman remarkable for his assiduity and the skill and judgment with which he\r\ncultivated his lands. He was blessed with abundant crops; and his means\r\nbeing larger than his wants, his granaries, even at this time, were full\r\nof corn. The dry year coming on had beggared all the village except\r\nhimself. Here was an opportunity to grow rich. Mark how Flor Silin acted.\r\nHaving called the poorest of his neighbors about him, he addressed them in\r\nthe following manner:\r\n\r\n6. "My friends, you want corn for your subsistence. God has blessed me\r\nwith abundance. Assist in thrashing out a quantity, and each of you take\r\nwhat he wants for his family." The peasants were amazed at this unexampled\r\ngenerosity; for sordid propensities exist in the village as well as in the\r\npopulous city.\r\n\r\n7. The fame of Flor Silin\'s benevolence having reached other villages, the\r\nfamished inhabitants presented themselves before him, and begged for corn.\r\nThis good creature received them as brothers; and, while his store\r\nremained, afforded all relief. At length, his wife, seeing no end to the\r\ngenerosity of his noble spirit, reminded him how necessary it would be to\r\nthink of their own wants, and hold his lavish hand before it was too late.\r\n"It is written in the Scripture," said he, "Give, and it shall be given\r\nunto you.\'"\r\n\r\n8. The following year Providence listened to the prayers of the poor, and\r\nthe harvest was abundant. The peasants who had been saved from starving by\r\nFlor Silin now gathered around him.\r\n\r\n9. "Behold," said they, "the corn you lent us. You saved our wives and\r\nchildren. We should have been famished but for you; may God reward you; he\r\nonly can; all we have to give is our corn and grateful thanks." "I want no\r\ncorn at present, my good neighbors," said he; "my harvest has exceeded all\r\nmy expectations; for the rest, thank heaven: I have been but an humble\r\ninstrument."\r\n\r\n10. They urged him in vain. "No," said he, "I shall not accept your corn.\r\nIf you have superfluities, share them among your poor neighbors, who,\r\nbeing unable to sow their fields last autumn, are still in want; let us\r\nassist them, my dear friends; the Almighty will bless us for it." "Yes,"\r\nreplied the grateful peasants, "our poor neighbors shall have this corn.\r\nThey shall know it is to you that they owe this timely succor, and join to\r\nteach their children the debt of gratitude due to your benevolent heart."\r\nSilin raised his tearful eyes to heaven. An angel might have envied him\r\nhis feelings.\r\n                                                       --Nikolai Karamzin.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Ex-tol\', to elevate by praise.

Lower Volga is a district in eastern Russia, bordering on the Caspian\r\nSea, and takes its name from the river Volga.\r\n\r\n4. Simbirsk is a town of eastern Russia, on the Volga.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIV. FORTY YEARS AGO.\r\n\r\n1. I\'ve wandered to the village, Tom,\r\n      I\'ve sat beneath the tree,\r\n   Upon the schoolhouse playground,\r\n     That sheltered you and me;\r\n   But none were left to greet me, Tom,\r\n     And few were left to know,\r\n   Who played with me upon the green,\r\n     Just forty years ago.\r\n\r\n2. The grass was just as green, Tom,\r\n     Barefooted boys at play\r\n   Were sporting, just as we did then,\r\n     With spirits just as gay.\r\n   But the master sleeps upon the hill,\r\n     Which, coated o\'er with snow,\r\n   Afforded us a sliding place,\r\n     Some forty years ago.\r\n\r\n3. The old schoolhouse is altered some;\r\n     The benches are replaced\r\n   By new ones very like the same\r\n     Our jackknives had defaced.\r\n   But the same old bricks are in the wall,\r\n     The bell swings to and fro;\r\n   Its music\'s just the same, dear Tom,\r\n     \'T was forty years ago.\r\n\r\n4. The spring that bubbled \'neath the hill,\r\n     Close by the spreading beech,\r\n   Is very low; \'t was once so high\r\n     That we could almost reach;\r\n   And kneeling down to take a drink,\r\n     Dear Tom, I started so,\r\n   To think how very much I\'ve changed\r\n     Since forty years ago.\r\n\r\n5. Near by that spring, upon an elm,\r\n     You know, I cut your name,\r\n   Your sweetheart\'s just beneath it, Tom;\r\n     And you did mine the same.\r\n   Some heartless wretch has peeled the bark;\r\n     \'T was dying sure, but slow,\r\n   Just as that one whose name you cut\r\n     Died forty years ago.\r\n\r\n6. My lids have long been dry, Tom,\r\n     But tears came in my eyes:\r\n   I thought of her I loved so well,\r\n     Those early broken ties.\r\n   I visited the old churchyard,\r\n     And took some flowers to strew\r\n   Upon the graves of those we loved\r\n     Just forty years ago.\r\n\r\n7. Some are in the churchyard laid,\r\n     Some sleep beneath the sea;\r\n   And none are left of our old class\r\n     Excepting you and me.\r\n   And when our time shall come, Tom,\r\n     And we are called to go,\r\n   I hope we\'ll meet with those we loved\r\n     Some forty years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLV. MRS. CAUDLE\'S LECTURE.\r\n\r\nDouglas Jerrold (b. 1803, d. 1857) was born in London. A midshipman\'s\r\nappointment was obtained for him, but he quit the naval service in a few\r\nyears. He was then apprenticed to a printer. By improving his leisure\r\nhours he made himself master of several languages, and formed the habit of\r\nexpressing his thoughts in writing An essay on the opera of Der Freischutz\r\nwas his first published literary production. Before he was twenty-one\r\nyears of age, he wrote "Black-eyed Susan," one of the most popular dramas\r\nof modern times. Several other popular plays followed this. He was a\r\nregular contributor to the London "Punch," from the second number, and\r\nedited, at different times, several papers and magazines. As a humorist,\r\nhe occupies the first rank. The most noted of his works are his plays, and\r\n"Mrs Caudle\'s Curtain Lectures," "Saint Giles and Saint James," "Bubbles\r\nof a Day," and "Chronicles of Clovernook."\r\n\r\n1. Well, Mr. Caudle, I hope you\'re in a little better temper than you were\r\nthis morning. There, you need n\'t begin to whistle: people don\'t come to\r\nbed to whistle. But it\'s like you; I can\'t speak that you don\'t try to\r\ninsult me. Once, I used to say you were the best creature living: now, you\r\nget quite a fiend. Do let you rest? No, I won\'t let you rest. It\'s the\r\nonly time I have to talk to you, and you shall hear me. I\'m put upon all\r\nday long: it\'s very hard if I can\'t speak a word at night; besides, it is\r\nn\'t often I open my mouth, goodness knows!\r\n\r\n2. Because once in your lifetime your shirt wanted a button, you must\r\nalmost swear the roof off the house. You did n\'t swear? Ha, Mr. Caudle!\r\nyou don\'t know what you do when you\'re in a passion. You were not in a\r\npassion, wer\'n\'t you? Well, then, I don\'t know what a passion is; and I\r\nthink I ought by this time. I\'ve lived long enough with you, Mr. Caudle,\r\nto know that.\r\n\r\n3. It\'s a pity you hav\'n\'t something worse to complain of than a button\r\noff your shirt. If you\'d some wives, you would, I know. I\'m sure I\'m never\r\nwithout a needle and thread in my hand; what with you and the children,\r\nI\'m made a perfect slave of. And what\'s my thanks? Why, if once in your\r\nlife a button\'s off your shirt--what do you cry "oh" at? I say once, Mr.\r\nCaudle; or twice, or three times, at most. I\'m sure, Caudle, no man\'s\r\nbuttons in the world are better looked after than yours. I only wish I\'d\r\nkept the shirts you had when you were first married! I should like to know\r\nwhere were your buttons then?\r\n\r\n4. Yes, it is worth talking of! But that\'s how you always try to put me\r\ndown. You fly into a rage, and then if I only try to speak, you won\'t hear\r\nme. That\'s how you men always will have all the talk to yourselves: a poor\r\nwoman is n\'t allowed to get a word in. A nice notion you have of a wife,\r\nto suppose she\'s nothing to think of but her husband\'s buttons. A pretty\r\nnotion, indeed, you have of marriage. Ha! if poor women only knew what\r\nthey had to go through!--what with buttons, and one thing and\r\nanother,--they\'d never tie themselves up,--no, not to the best man in the\r\nworld, I\'m sure. What would they do, Mr. Caudle?--Why, do much better\r\nwithout you, I\'m certain.\r\n\r\n5. And it\'s my belief, after all, that the button was n\'t off the shirt;\r\nit\'s my belief that you pulled it off that you might have something to\r\ntalk about. Oh, you\'re aggravating enough, when you like, for anything!\r\nAll I know is, it\'s very odd that the button should be off the shirt; for\r\nI\'m sure no woman\'s a greater slave to her husband\'s buttons than I am. I\r\nonly say it\'s very odd.\r\n\r\n6. However, there\'s one comfort; it can\'t last long. I\'m worn to death\r\nwith your temper, and sha\'n\'t trouble you a great while. Ha! you may\r\nlaugh! And I dare say you would laugh! I\'ve no doubt of it! That\'s your\r\nlove; that\'s your feeling! I know that I\'m sinking every day, though I say\r\nnothing about it. And when I\'m gone we shall see how your second wife will\r\nlook after your buttons! You\'ll find out the difference then. Yes, Caudle,\r\nyou\'ll think of me then; for then, I hope, you\'ll never have a blessed\r\nbutton to your back.\r\n\r\n7. No, I\'m not a vindictive woman, Mr. Caudle: nobody ever called me that\r\nbut you. What do you say? Nobody ever knew so much of me? That\'s nothing\r\nat all to do with it. Ha! I would n\'t have your aggravating temper,\r\nCaudle, for mines of gold. It\'s a good thing I\'m not as worrying as you\r\nare, or a nice house there\'d be between us. I only wish you\'d had a wife\r\nthat would have talked to you! Then you\'d have known the difference. But\r\nyou impose upon me because, like a poor fool, I say nothing. I should be\r\nashamed of myself, Caudle.\r\n\r\n8. And a pretty example you set as a father! You\'ll make your boys as bad\r\nas yourself. Talking as you did all breakfast time about your buttons! and\r\nof a Sunday morning, too! And you call yourself a Christian! I should like\r\nto know what your boys will say of you when they grow up! And all about a\r\npaltry button off one of your wristbands! A decent man would n\'t have\r\nmentioned it. Why don\'t I hold my tongue? Because I won\'t hold my tongue.\r\nI\'m to have my peace of mind destroyed--I \'m to be worried into my grave\r\nfor a miserable shirt button, and I\'m to hold my tongue! Oh!  but that\'s\r\njust like you men!\r\n\r\n9. But I know what I\'ll do for the future. Every button you have may drop\r\noff, and I won\'t so much as put a thread to \'em. And I should like to know\r\nwhat you\'ll do then! Oh, you must get somebody else to sew \'em, must you?\r\nThat\'s a pretty threat for a husband to hold out to his wife! And to such\r\na wife as I\'ve been, too: such a slave to your buttons, as I may say.\r\nSomebody else to sew \'em\'! No, Caudle, no; not while I\'m alive! When I\'m\r\ndead--and, with what I have to bear, there\'s no knowing how soon that may\r\nbe--when I \'m dead, I say--oh! what a brute you must be to snore so!\r\n\r\n10. You\'re not snoring? Ha! that\'s what you always say; but that\'s nothing\r\nto do with it. You must get somebody else to sew \'em, must you? Ha! I\r\nshould n\'t wonder. Oh, no! I should be surprised at nothing now! Nothing\r\nat all! It\'s what people have always told me it would come to; and now the\r\nbuttons have opened my eyes! But the whole world shall know of your\r\ncruelty, Mr. Caudle. After the wife I\'ve been to you. Caudle, you\'ve a\r\nheart like a hearthstone, you have!\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--5. Ag\'gra-vat-ing, provoking, irritating. 6. Sink\'ing,\r\nfailing in strength. 7. Vin-dic\'tive, revengeful. 8. Pal\'try, mean,\r\ncontemptible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVI. THE VILLAGE BLACKSMITH.\r\n\r\n1. Under a spreading chestnut tree\r\n     The village smithy stands;\r\n   The smith, a mighty man is he,\r\n     With large and sinewy hands;\r\n   And the muscles of his brawny arms\r\n     Are strong as iron bands.\r\n\r\n2. His hair is crisp, and black, and long,\r\n     His face is like the tan;\r\n   His brow is wet with honest sweat,\r\n     He earns whate\'er he can,\r\n   And looks the whole world in the face,\r\n     For he owes not any man.\r\n\r\n3. Week in, week out, from morn till night,\r\n     You can hear his bellows blow;\r\n   You can hear him swing his heavy sledge,\r\n     With measured beat and slow,\r\n   Like a sexton ringing the village bell,\r\n     When the evening sun is low.\r\n\r\n4. And children coming home from school\r\n     Look in at the open door;\r\n   They love to see the flaming forge,\r\n     And hear the bellows roar,\r\n   And catch the burning sparks that fly\r\n     Like chaff from a threshing floor.\r\n\r\n5. He goes on Sunday to the church,\r\n     And sits among his boys;\r\n   He hears the parson pray and preach,\r\n     He hears his daughter\'s voice\r\n   Singing in the village choir,\r\n     And it makes his heart rejoice.\r\n\r\n6. It sounds to him like her mother\'s voice\r\n     Singing in Paradise!\r\n   He needs must think of her once more,\r\n     How in the grave she lies;\r\n   And with his hard, rough hand he wipes\r\n     A tear out of his eyes.\r\n\r\n7. Toiling, rejoicing, sorrowing,\r\n     Onward through life he goes;\r\n   Each morning sees some task begin,\r\n     Each evening sees its close;\r\n   Something attempted, something done,\r\n     Has earned a night\'s repose.\r\n\r\n8. Thanks, thanks to thee, my worthy friend,\r\n     For the lesson thou hast taught!\r\n   Thus at the flaming forge of life\r\n     Our fortunes must be wrought;\r\n   Thus on its sounding anvil shaped\r\n     Each burning deed and thought!\r\n                                      --Longfellow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVII. THE RELIEF OF LUCKNOW.\r\n\r\n[From a letter to the "London Times," by a lady, the wife of an officer at\r\nLucknow.]\r\n\r\n1. On every side death stared us in the face; no human skill could avert\r\nit any longer. We saw the moment approach when we must bid farewell to\r\nearth, yet without feeling that unutterable horror which must have been\r\nexperienced by the unhappy victims at Cawnpore. We were resolved rather to\r\ndie than to yield, and were fully persuaded that in twenty-four hours all\r\nwould be over. The engineer had said so, and all knew the worst. We women\r\nstrove to encourage each other, and to perform the light duties which had\r\nbeen assigned to us, such as conveying orders to the batteries, and\r\nsupplying the men with provisions, especially cups of coffee, which we\r\nprepared day and night.\r\n\r\n2. I had gone out to try to make myself useful, in company with Jessie\r\nBrown, the wife of a corporal in my husband\'s regiment. Poor Jessie had\r\nbeen in a state of restless excitement all through the siege, and had\r\nfallen away visibly within the last few days. A constant fever consumed\r\nher, and her mind wandered occasionally, especially that day, when the\r\nrecollections of home seemed powerfully present to her. At last, overcome\r\nwith fatigue, she lay down on the ground, wrapped up in her plaid. I sat\r\nbeside her, promising to awaken her when, as she said, her "father should\r\nreturn from the plowing."\r\n\r\n3. She fell at length into a profound slumber, motionless and apparently\r\nbreathless, her head resting in my lap. I myself could no longer resist\r\nthe inclination to sleep, in spite of the continual roar of the cannon.\r\nSuddenly I was aroused by a wild, unearthly scream close to my ear; my\r\ncompanion stood upright beside me, her arms raised, and her head bent\r\nforward in the attitude of listening.\r\n\r\n4. A look of intense delight broke over her countenance; she grasped my\r\nhand, drew me toward her, and exclaimed: "Dinna ye hear it? dinna ye hear\r\nit? Ay. I\'m no dreaming: it\'s the slogan o\' the Highlanders! We\'re saved!\r\nwe\'re saved!" Then flinging herself on her knees, she thanked God with\r\npassionate fervor. I felt utterly bewildered; my English ears heard only\r\nthe roar of artillery, and I thought my poor Jessie was still raving; but\r\nshe darted to the batteries, and I heard her cry incessantly to the men,\r\n"Courage! courage! Hark to the slogan--to the Macgregor, the grandest of\r\nthem a\'! Here\'s help at last!"\r\n\r\n5. To describe the effect of these words upon the soldiers would be\r\nimpossible. For a moment they ceased firing, and every soul listened with\r\nintense anxiety. Gradually, however, there arose a murmur of bitter\r\ndisappointment, and the wailing of the women, who had flocked to the spot,\r\nburst out anew as the colonel shook his head. Our dull Lowland ears heard\r\nonly the battle of the musketry. A few moments more of this deathlike\r\nsuspense, of this agonizing hope, and Jessie, who had again sunk on the\r\nground, sprang to her feet, and cried in a voice so clear and piercing\r\nthat it was heard along the whole line, "Will ye no believe it noo? The\r\nslogan has ceased, indeed, but the Campbells are comin\'! D\' ye hear? d\' ye\r\nhear?"\r\n\r\n6. At that moment all seemed indeed to hear the voice of God in the\r\ndistance, when the pibroch of the Highlanders brought us tidings of\r\ndeliverance; for now there was no longer any doubt of the fact. That\r\nshrill, penetrating, ceaseless sound, which rose above all other sounds,\r\ncould come neither from the advance of the enemy nor from the work of the\r\nsappers. No, it was indeed the blast of the Scottish bagpipes, now shrill\r\nand harsh, as threatening vengeance on the foe, then in softer tones,\r\nseeming to promise succor to their friends in need.\r\n\r\n7. Never, surely, was there such a scene as that which followed. Not a\r\nheart in the residency of Lucknow but bowed itself before God. All, by one\r\nsimultaneous impulse, fell upon their knees, and nothing was heard but\r\nbursting sobs and the murmured voice of prayer. Then all arose, and there\r\nrang out from a thousand lips a great shout of joy, which resounded far\r\nand wide, and lent new vigor to that blessed pibroch.\r\n\r\n8. To our cheer of "God save the Queen," they replied by the well-known\r\nstrain that moves every Scot to tears, "Should auld acquaintance be\r\nforgot." After that, nothing else made any impression on me. I scarcely\r\nremember what followed. Jessie was presented to the general on his\r\nentrance into the fort, and at the officers\' banquet her health was drunk\r\nby all present, while the pipers marched around the table playing once\r\nmore the familiar air of "Auld Lang Syne."\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1. A-vert\', to turn aside. En-gi-neer\', an officer in the\r\narmy, who designs and constructs defensive and offensive works. 2. Siege,\r\nthe setting of an army around a fortified place to compel its surrender.\r\n3. Pro-found\', deep. 4. Slo\'gan, the war cry or gather-ing word of a\r\nHighland clan in Scotland. Fer\'vor, intensity of feel-ing. 6. Pi\'broch, a\r\nwild, irregular species of music belonging to the Highlands of Scotland;\r\nit is performed on a bagpipe. Sap\'pers, men employed in making an approach\r\nto a fortified place by digging. 7. Res\'i-den-cy, the official dwelling of\r\na government officer in India. Si-mul-ta\'ne-ous, happening at the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--Lucknow, a city in the British possession of India. In 1857 there\r\nwas a mutiny of the native troops, and the British garrison of 1700 men\r\nwas besieged by 10,000 mutineers. After twelve weeks\' siege, fresh British\r\ntroops forced an entrance, and the town was held until relieved three\r\nweeks later by the arrival of Sir Colin Campbell, as above described.\r\n\r\n1. Cawnpore, also a city of India, near Lucknow, which was besieged during\r\nthe mutiny. After surrendering, the English, two thirds of whom were women\r\nand children, were treacherously massacred.\r\n\r\n4. The inhabitants of the northern part of Scotland are called\r\nHighlanders; those of the southern part, Lowlanders. The dialect of the\r\nformer is very peculiar, as shown in the language of Jessie Brown; as,\r\ndinna for did not, a\' for all, no for not, noo for now, auld for old.\r\nMacgregor and Campbell are names of Highland clans or families.\r\n\r\nWhittier\'s poem, "The Pipes at Lucknow," and Robert T. S. Lowell\'s "The\r\nRelief of Lucknow," are descriptive of this same incident.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVIII. THE SNOWSTORM.\r\n\r\nJames Thomson (b. 1700, d.1748) was born at Ednam, in the shire of\r\nRoxburgh, Scotland. He was educated at the University of Edinburgh, and\r\nafterwards studied for the ministry, but in a short time changed his plans\r\nand devoted himself to literature. His early poems are quite\r\ninsignificant, but "The Seasons," from which the following selection is\r\ntaken; and the "Castle of Indolence," are masterpieces of English poetry.\r\n\r\n1. Through the hushed air the whitening shower descends,\r\n   At first thin wavering; till at last the flakes\r\n   Fall broad and wide and fast, dimming the day,\r\n   With a continual flow. The cherished fields\r\n   Put on their winter robe of purest white.\r\n   \'T is brightness all: save where the new snow melts\r\n   Along the mazy current.\r\n\r\n2.                           Low the woods\r\n   Bow their hoar head; and ere the languid sun\r\n   Faint from the west emits its evening ray,\r\n   Earth\'s universal face, deep-hid and chill,\r\n   Is one wild dazzling waste, that buries wide\r\n   The works of man.\r\n\r\n3.                           Drooping, the laborer ox\r\n   Stands covered o\'er with snow, and then demands\r\n   The fruit of all his toil. The fowls of heaven,\r\n   Tamed by the cruel season, crowd around\r\n   The winnowing store, and claim the little boon\r\n   Which Providence assigns them.\r\n\r\n4.                           One alone,\r\n   The Redbreast, sacred to the household gods,\r\n   Wisely regardful of the embroiling sky,\r\n   In joyless fields and thorny thickets leaves\r\n   His shivering mates, and pays to trusted man\r\n   His annual visit.\r\n\r\n5.                           Half-afraid, he first\r\n   Against the window beats; then, brisk, alights\r\n   On the warm hearth; then, hopping o\'er the floor,\r\n   Eyes all the smiling family askance,\r\n   And pecks, and starts, and wonders where he is;\r\n   Till, more familiar grown, the table crumbs\r\n   Attract his slender feet.\r\n\r\n6.                           The foodless wilds\r\n   Pour forth their brown inhabitants. The hare,\r\n   Though timorous of heart, and hard beset\r\n   By death in various forms, dark snares and dogs,\r\n   And more unpitying men, the garden seeks,\r\n   Urged on by fearless want. The bleating kind.\r\n   Eye the bleak heaven, and next the glistening earth,\r\n   With looks of dumb despair; then, sad dispersed,\r\n   Dig for the withered herb through heaps of snow\r\n\r\n7. Now, shepherds, to your helpless charge be kind,\r\n   Baffle the raging year, and fill their pens\r\n   With food at will; lodge them below the storm,\r\n   And watch them strict; for from the bellowing east,\r\n   In this dire season, oft the whirlwind\'s wing\r\n   Sweeps up the burden of whole wintry plains\r\n   In one wide waft, and o\'er the hapless flocks,\r\n   Hid in the hollow of two neighboring hills,\r\n   The billowy tempest \'whelms; till, upward urged,\r\n   The valley to a shining mountain swells,\r\n   Tipped with a wreath high-curling in the sky\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Ma\'zy, winding. 2. Hoar, white or grayish white. E-mits\',\r\nsends forth, throws out, 3. Win\'now-ing, separat-ing chaff from grain by\r\nmeans of wind. Boon, a gift. 4. Em--broil\'ing, throwing into disorder or\r\ncontention. 5, A-skance\', side-ways. 6. Wilds, woods, forests. Be-set\',\r\nhemmed in on all sides so that escape is difficult. 7. Dire, dreadful,\r\nterrible. Waft, a current of wind. Whelms\', covers completely.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.--4. Household gods. An allusion to the belief of the ancient Romans\r\nin the Penates--certain gods who were supposed to protect the household\r\nand all connected with it. The idea here expressed is, that the Redbreast\r\nwas secure from harm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIX. BEHIND TIME.\r\n\r\n1. A railroad train was rushing along at almost lightning speed. A curve\r\nwas just ahead, beyond which was a station where two trains usually met.\r\nThe conductor was late,--so late that the period during which the up train\r\nwas to wait had nearly elapsed; but he hoped yet to pass the curve safely.\r\nSuddenly a locomotive dashed into sight right ahead. In an instant there\r\nwas a collision. A shriek, a shock, and fifty souls were in eternity; and\r\nall because an engineer had been behind time.\r\n\r\n2. A great battle was going on. Column after column had been precipitated\r\nfor eight hours on the enemy posted along the ridge of a hill. The summer\r\nsun was sinking in the west; reenforcements for the obstinate defenders\r\nwere already in sight; it was necessary to carry the position with one\r\nfinal charge, or everything would be lost.\r\n\r\n3. A powerful corps had been summoned from across the country, and if it\r\ncame up in season all would yet be well. The great conqueror, confident in\r\nits arrival, formed his reserve into an attacking column, and ordered them\r\nto charge the enemy. The whole world knows the result. Grouchy failed to\r\nappear; the imperial guard was beaten back; and Waterloo was lost.\r\nNapoleon died a prisoner at St. Helena because one of his marshals was\r\nbehind time.\r\n\r\n4. A leading firm in commercial circles had long struggled against\r\nbankruptcy. As it had large sums of money in California, it expected\r\nremittances by a certain day, and if they arrived, its credit, its honor,\r\nand its future prosperity would be preserved. But week after week elapsed\r\nwithout bringing the gold. At last came the fatal day on which the firm\r\nhad bills maturing to large amounts. The steamer was telegraphed at\r\ndaybreak; but it was found, on inquiry, that she brought no funds, and the\r\nhouse failed. The next arrival brought nearly half a million to the\r\ninsolvents, but it was too late; they were ruined because their agent, in\r\nremitting, had been behind time.\r\n\r\n5. A condemned man was led, out for execution. He had taken human life,\r\nbut under circumstances of the greatest provocation, and public sympathy\r\nwas active in his behalf. Thousands had signed petitions for a reprieve; a\r\nfavorable answer had been expected the night before, and though it had not\r\ncome, even the sheriff felt confident that it would yet arrive. Thus the\r\nmorning passed without the appearance of the messenger.\r\n\r\n6. The last moment was up. The prisoner took his place, the cap was drawn\r\nover his eyes, the bolt was drawn, and a lifeless body swung revolving in\r\nthe wind. Just at that moment a horseman came into sight, galloping down\r\nhill, his steed covered with foam. He carried a packet in his right hand,\r\nwhich he waved frantically to the crowd. He was the express rider with the\r\nreprieve; but he came too late. A comparatively innocent man had died an\r\nignominious death because a watch had been five minutes too late, making\r\nits bearer arrive behind time.\r\n\r\n7. It is continually so in life. The best laid plans, the most important\r\naffairs, the fortunes of individuals, the weal of nations, honor,\r\nhappiness, life itself, are daily sacrificed, because somebody is "behind\r\ntime." There are men who always fail in whatever they undertake, simply\r\nbecause they are "behind time." There are others who put off reformation\r\nyear after year, till death seizes them, and they perish unrepentant,\r\nbecause forever "behind time."\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Col-li\'sion, the act of striking together violently. 2.\r\nPre-cip\'i-tat-ed, urged on violently. Re-en-force\'ments, additional\r\ntroops. 3. Corps (pro. kor), a body of troops. Re-serve\', a select body of\r\ntroops held back in case of special need for their services. 4.\r\nBank\'rupt-cy. inability to pay all debts, insolvency. Re-mit\'tanc-es,\r\nmouey, drafts, etc., sent from a distance. Ma-tur\'ing, approaching the\r\ntime fixed for payment. 5. Prov-o-ca\'tion, that which causes anger. 6.\r\nIg-no-min\'i-ous, infamous. 7. Weal, prosperity, happiness.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--3. Emmanuel Grouchy was one of Napoleon\'s marshals at the battle\r\nof Waterloo, fought in 1815 between the French under Napoleon, and the\r\nEnglish, Dutch, and German troops under Wellington.\r\n\r\nNapoleon Bonaparte (b. 1769, d. 1821) was born on the island of Corsica.\r\nAt school he was "studious, well-behaved, and distinguished in\r\nmathematical studies." In 1785 he was commissioned as a sublieutenant in\r\nthe army. From this obscure position he raised himself to the head of the\r\narmy, and in 1804 was elected emperor of the French. He is almost\r\nuniversally acknowledged to have been the greatest general the world has\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nL. THE OLD SAMPLER.\r\n\r\n1. Out of the way, in a corner\r\n     Of our dear old attic room,\r\n   Where bunches of herbs from the hillside\r\n     Shake ever a faint perfume,\r\n   An oaken chest is standing,\r\n     With hasp and padlock and key,\r\n   Strong as the hands that made it\r\n     On the other side of the sea.\r\n\r\n2. When the winter days are dreary,\r\n     And we\'re out of heart with life,\r\n   Of its crowding cares aweary,\r\n     And sick of its restless strife,\r\n   We take a lesson in patience\r\n     From the attic corner dim,\r\n   Where the chest still holds its treasures,\r\n     A warder faithful and grim.\r\n\r\n3. Robes of an antique fashion,\r\n     Linen and lace and silk,\r\n   That time has tinted with saffron,\r\n     Though once they were white as milk;\r\n   Wonderful baby garments,\r\n     \'Boidered with loving care\r\n   By fingers that felt the pleasure,\r\n     As they wrought the ruffles fair;\r\n\r\n4. A sword, with the red rust on it,\r\n     That flashed in the battle tide,\r\n   When from Lexington to Yorktown\r\n     Sorely men\'s souls were tried;\r\n   A plumed chapeau and a buckle,\r\n     And many a relic fine,\r\n   And, an by itself, the sampler,\r\n     Framed in with berry and vine.\r\n\r\n5. Faded the square of canvas,\r\n     And dim is the silken thread,\r\n   But I think of white hands dimpled,\r\n     And a childish, sunny head;\r\n   For here in cross and in tent stitch,\r\n     In a wreath of berry and vine,\r\n   She worked it a hundred years ago,\r\n     "Elizabeth, Aged Nine."\r\n\r\n6. In and out in the sunshine,\r\n     The little needle flashed,\r\n   And in and out on the rainy day,\r\n     When the merry drops down plashed,\r\n   As close she sat by her mother,\r\n     The little Puritan maid,\r\n   And did her piece in the sampler,\r\n     While the other children played.\r\n\r\n7. You are safe in the beautiful heaven,\r\n     "Elizabeth, aged nine;"\r\n   But before you went you had troubles\r\n     Sharper than any of mine.\r\n   Oh, the gold hair turned with sorrow\r\n     White as the drifted snow.\r\n   And your tears dropped here where I\'m standing,\r\n     On this very plumed chapeau.\r\n\r\n8. When you put it away, its wearer\r\n     Would need it nevermore,\r\n   By a sword thrust learning the secrets\r\n     God keeps on yonder shore;\r\n   And you wore your grief like glory,\r\n     You would not yield supine,\r\n   Who wrought in your patient childhood,\r\n     "Elizabeth, Aged Nine."\r\n\r\n9. Out of the way, in a corner,\r\n     With hasp and padlock and key,\r\n   Stands the oaken chest of my fathers\r\n     That came from over the sea;\r\n   And the hillside herbs above it\r\n     Shake odors fragrant and fine,\r\n   And here on its lid is a garland\r\n     To "Elizabeth, aged nine."\r\n\r\n10. For love is of the immortal,\r\n      And patience is sublime,\r\n    And trouble a thing of every day,\r\n      And touching every time;\r\n    And childhood sweet and sunny,\r\n      And womanly truth and grace,\r\n    Ever call light life\'s darkness\r\n      And bless earth\'s lowliest place.\r\n                                      --Mrs. M. E. Sangster.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--2. Ward\'er, a keeper, a guard. 3. An-tique\', old, ancient.\r\nSaf\'fron, a deep yellow. 4. Cha-peau\', a hat. 8. Su-pine\', listless. 10.\r\nIm-mort\'al, undying.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--6. Puritan. The Puritans were a religious sect who fled from\r\npersecution in England, and afterwards settled the most of New England.\r\n\r\nA sampler is a needlework pattern; a species of fancywork formerly much in\r\nvogue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLI. THE GOODNESS OF GOD.\r\n\r\n1. Bless the Lord, O my soul! O Lord, my God, thou art very great; thou\r\nart clothed with honor and majesty: who coverest thyself with light as\r\nwith a garment; who stretchest out the heavens like a curtain; who layeth\r\nthe beams of his chambers in the waters; who maketh the clouds his\r\nchariot; who walketh upon the wings of the wind; who maketh his angels\r\nspirits, his ministers a flaming fire; who laid the foundations of the\r\nearth, that it should not be removed forever.\r\n\r\n2. Thou coveredst it with the deep as with a garment: the waters stood\r\nabove the mountains. At thy rebuke they fled; at the voice of thy thunder\r\nthey hasted away. They go up by the mountains; they go down by the valleys\r\nunto the place which thou hast founded for them. Thou hast set a bound\r\nwhich they may not pass over; that they turn not again to cover the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. He sendeth the springs into the valleys, which run among the hills.\r\nThey give drink to every beast of the field; the wild asses quench their\r\nthirst. By them shall the fowls of the heaven have their habitation, which\r\nsing among the branches. He watereth the hills from his chambers; the\r\nearth is satisfied with the fruit of thy works.\r\n\r\n4. He caused the grass to grow for the cattle, and herb for the service of\r\nman, that he may bring forth food out of the earth; and wine that maketh\r\nglad the heart of man, and oil to make his face to shine, and bread which\r\nstrengtheneth man\'s heart.\r\n\r\n5. The trees of the Lord are full of sap; the cedars of Lebanon, which he\r\nhath planted, where the birds make their nests: as for the stork, the fir\r\ntrees are her house. The high hills are a refuge for the wild goats, and\r\nthe rocks for the conies.\r\n\r\n6. He appointed the moon for seasons; the sun knoweth his going down. Thou\r\nmakest darkness, and it is night, wherein all the beasts of the forest do\r\ncreep forth. The young lions roar after their prey, and seek their meat\r\nfrom God. The sun ariseth, they gather themselves together, and lay them\r\ndown in their dens. Man goeth forth unto his work, and to his labor until\r\nthe evening.\r\n\r\n7. O Lord, how manifold are thy works! in wisdom hast thou made them all:\r\nthe earth is full of thy riches. So is this great and wide sea, wherein\r\nare things creeping innumerable, both small and great beasts. There go the\r\nships: there is that leviathan, whom thou hast made to play therein. These\r\nwait all upon thee, that thou mayest give them their meat in due season.\r\n\r\n8. That thou givest them they gather; thou openest thine hand, they are\r\nfilled with good. Thou hidest thy face, they are troubled; thou takest\r\naway their breath, they die, and return to their dust. Thou sendest forth\r\nthy Spirit, they are created; and thou renewest the face of the earth.\r\n\r\n9. The glory of the Lord shall endure forever: the Lord shall rejoice in\r\nhis works. He looketh on the earth, and it trembleth: he toucheth the\r\nhills, and they smoke.\r\n\r\n10. O that men would praise the Lord for his goodness, and for his\r\nwonderful works to the children of men! And let them sacrifice the\r\nsacrifices of thanksgiving, and declare his works with rejoicing.\r\n\r\n11. O give thanks unto the Lord; call upon his name; make known his deeds\r\namong the people. Sing unto him, sing psalms unto him: talk ye of all his\r\nwondrous\' works. Glory ye in his holy name: let the heart of them rejoice\r\nthat seek the Lord. Seek the Lord, and his strength; seek his face\r\nevermore.\r\n\r\n12. Remember his marvelous works that he hath done; his wonders, and the\r\njudgments of his mouth. He is the Lord our God; his judgments are in all\r\nthe earth. I will sing unto the Lord as long as I live: I will sing praise\r\nto my God while I have my being.\r\n                                                 --Extracts from the Bible.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--2. Found\'ed, built, established. 3. Hab-i-ta\' tion, place of\r\nabode. 5. Ref \'uge, shelter, protection. Co\'ny, a kind of rabbit. 6.\r\nAp-point\'ed, ordained.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--5. Cedars of Lebanon. A species of cedar, of great magnificence,\r\nformerly abundant in Mt. Lebanon and the Taurus Range in Asia Minor, but\r\nnow almost entirely destroyed. The wood is durable and fragrant, and was\r\nused in the construction of costly buildings, such as the palace of David\r\nand Solomon\'s Temple.\r\n\r\n7. Leviathan. This name is applied in the Old Testament to some huge water\r\nanimal. In some cases it appears to mean the crocodile, but in others the\r\nwhale or a large sea serpent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLII. MY MOTHER.\r\n\r\n1. Often into folly straying,\r\n     O, my mother! how I\'ve grieved her!\r\n   Oft I\'ve heard her for me praying,\r\n     Till the gushing tears relieved her;\r\n   And she gently rose and smiled,\r\n   Whispering, "God will keep my child."\r\n\r\n2. She was youthful then, and sprightly,\r\n     Fondly on my father leaning,\r\n   Sweet she spoke, her eyes shone brightly,\r\n     And her words were full of meaning;\r\n   Now, an autumn leaf decayed;\r\n   I, perhaps, have made it fade.\r\n\r\n3. But, whatever ills betide thee,\r\n     Mother, in them all I share;\r\n   In thy sickness watch beside thee,\r\n     And beside thee kneel in prayer.\r\n   Best of mothers! on my breast\r\n   Lean thy head, and sink to rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIII. THE HOUR OF PRAYER.\r\n\r\nFelicia Dorothea Hemans (b. 1794, d. 1835) was born in Liverpool, England.\r\nHer maiden name was Browne. Her childhood was spent in Wales. Her first\r\nvolume of poems was published in 1808; her second in 1812. In 1812 she was\r\nmarried to Captain Hemans, but he left her about six years after their\r\nmarriage, and they never again lived together. She went, with her five\r\nsons, to reside with her mother, then living near St. Asaph, in North\r\nWales. Mrs. Hemans then resumed her literary pursuits, and wrote much and\r\nwell. Her poetry is smooth and graceful, and she excels in description.\r\nMany of her poems are exceedingly beautiful.\r\n\r\n1. Child, amid the flowers at play,\r\n   While the red light fades away;\r\n   Mother, with thine earnest eye,\r\n   Ever following silently;\r\n   Father, by the breeze at eve\r\n   Called thy harvest work to leave;\r\n   Pray! Ere yet the dark hours be,\r\n   Lift the heart, and bend the knee.\r\n\r\n2. Traveler, in the stranger\'s land,\r\n   Far from thine own household band;\r\n   Mourner, haunted by the tone\r\n   Of a voice from this world gone;\r\n   Captive, in whose narrow cell\r\n   Sunshine hath not leave to dwell;\r\n   Sailor, on the darkening sea;\r\n   Lift the heart and bend the knee.\r\n\r\n3. Warrior, that from battle won,\r\n   Breathest now at set of sun;\r\n   Woman, o\'er the lowly slain\r\n   Weeping on his burial plain;\r\n   Ye that triumph, ye that sigh,\r\n   Kindred by one holy tie,\r\n   Heaven\'s first star alike ye see;\r\n   Lift the heart, and bend the knee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIV. THE WILL.\r\n\r\nCharacters.--SWIPES, a brewer; CURRIE, a saddler; FRANK MILLINGTON; and\r\nSQUIRE DRAWL.\r\n\r\nSwipes. A sober occasion, this, brother Currie. Who would have thought the\r\nold lady was so near her end?\r\n\r\nCurrie. Ah! we must all die, brother Swipes; and those who live the\r\nlongest outlive the most.\r\n\r\nSwipes. True, true; but, since we must die and leave our earthly\r\npossessions, it is well that the law takes such good care of us. Had the\r\nold lady her senses when she departed?\r\n\r\nCur. Perfectly, perfectly. Squire Drawl told me she read every word of the\r\nwill aloud, and never signed her name better.\r\n\r\nSwipes. Had you any hint from the Squire what disposition she made of her\r\nproperty?\r\n\r\nCur. Not a whisper; the Squire is as close as an underground tomb; but one\r\nof the witnesses hinted to me that she had cut off her graceless nephew,\r\nFrank, without a shilling.\r\n\r\nSwipes. Has she, good soul, has she? You know I come in,\r\nthen, in right of my wife.\r\n\r\nCur. And I in my own right; and this is no doubt the reason why we have\r\nbeen called to hear the reading of the will. Squire Drawl knows how things\r\nshould be done, though he is as air-tight as one of your beer barrels. But\r\nhere comes the young reprobate. He must be present, as a matter of course,\r\nyou know. [Enter FRANK MILLINGTON.] Your servant, young gentleman. So your\r\nbenefactress has left you at last.\r\n\r\nSwipes. It is a painful thing to part with old and good friends, Mr.\r\nMillington.\r\n\r\nFrank. It is so, sir; but I could bear her loss better had I not so often\r\nbeen ungrateful for her kindness. She was my only friend, and I knew not\r\nher value.\r\n\r\nCur. It is too late to repent, Master Millington. You will now have a\r\nchance to earn your own bread.\r\n\r\nSwipes. Ay, ay, or the sweat of your brow, as better people are obliged\r\nto. You would make a fine brewer\'s boy, if you were not too old.\r\n\r\nCur. Ay, or a saddler\'s lackey, if held with a tight rein.\r\n\r\nFrank. Gentlemen, your remarks imply that my aunt has treated me as I\r\ndeserved. I am above your insults, and only hope you will bear your\r\nfortune as modestly as I shall mine submissively. I shall retire. [Going:\r\nHe meets SQUIRE DRAWL.]\r\n\r\nSquire. Stop, stop, young man. We must have your presence. Good morning,\r\ngentlemen; you are early on the ground.\r\n\r\nCur. I hope the Squire is well to-day.\r\n\r\nSquire. Pretty comfortable, for an invalid.\r\n\r\nSwipes. I trust the damp air has not affected your lungs again.\r\n\r\nSquire. No, I believe not. But, since the heirs at law are all convened, I\r\nshall now proceed to open the last will and testament of your deceased\r\nrelative, according to law.\r\n\r\nSwipes. [While the SQUIRE is breaking the seal,] It is a trying thing to\r\nleave all one\'s possessions, Squire; in this manner.\r\n\r\nCur. It really makes me feel melancholy when I look around and see\r\neverything but the venerable owner of these goods. Well did the Preacher\r\nsay, "All is vanity."\r\n\r\nSquire. Please to be seated, gentlemen. [He puts on his spectacles and\r\nbegins to read slowly.] "Imprirmis; whereas, my nephew, Francis\r\nMillington, by his disobedience and ungrateful conduct, has shown himself\r\nunworthy of my bounty, and incapable of managing my large estate, I do\r\nhereby give and bequeath all my houses, farms, stocks, bonds, moneys, and\r\nproperty, both personal and real, to my dear cousins, Samuel Swipes, of\r\nMalt Street, brewer, and Christopher Currie, of Fly Court, saddler." [The\r\nSQUIRE here takes off his spectacles, and begins to wipe them very\r\nleisurely.]\r\n\r\nSwipes. Generous creature! kind soul! I always loved her!\r\n\r\nCur. She was good, she was kind;--and, brother Swipes, when we divide, I\r\nthink I\'ll take the mansion house.\r\n\r\nSwipes. Not so fast, if you please, Mr. Currie. My wife has long had her\r\neye upon that, and must have it.\r\n\r\nCur. There will be two words to that bargain, Mr. Swipes. And, besides, I\r\nought to have the first choice. Did I not lend her a new chaise every time\r\nshe wished to ride? And who knows what influence--\r\n\r\nSwipes. Am I not named first in her will? and did I not furnish her with\r\nmy best small beer for more than six months? And who knows--\r\n\r\nFrank. Gentlemen, I must leave you. [Going.] Squire. [Putting on his\r\nspectacles very deliberately.] Pray, gentlemen, keep your seats, I have\r\nnot done yet. Let me see; where was I? Ay, "All my property, both personal\r\nand real, to my dear cousins, Samuel Swipes, of Malt Street, brewer,"--\r\n\r\nSwipes. Yes!\r\n\r\nSquire. "And Christopher Currie, of Fly Court, saddler,"\r\n\r\nCur. Yes!\r\n\r\nSquire. "To have and to hold, IN TRUST, for the sole and exclusive benefit\r\nof my nephew, Francis Millington, until he shall have attained the age of\r\ntwenty-one years, by which time I hope he will have so far reformed his\r\nevil habits, as that he may safely be intrusted with the large fortune\r\nwhich I hereby bequeath to him."\r\n\r\nSwipes. What is all this? You don\'t mean that we are humbugged? In trust!\r\nHow does that appear? Where is it?\r\n\r\nSquire. There; in two words of as good old English as I ever penned.\r\n\r\nCur. Pretty well, too, Mr. Squire, if we must be sent for to be made a\r\nlaughingstock of. She shall pay for every ride she has had out of my\r\nchaise, I promise you.\r\n\r\nSwipes. And for every drop of my beer. Fine times, if two sober,\r\nhard-working citizens are to be brought here to be made the sport of a\r\ngraceless profligate. But we will manage his property for him, Mr. Currie;\r\nwe will make him feel that trustees are not to be trifled with.\r\n\r\nCur. That we will.\r\n\r\nSquire. Not so fast, gentlemen; for the instrument is dated three years\r\nago; and the young gentleman must be already of age, and able to take care\r\nof himself. Is it not so, Francis?\r\n\r\nFrank. It is, your worship. Squire. Then, gentlemen, having attended to\r\nthe breaking of the seal, according to law, you are released from any\r\nfurther trouble about the business.\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--Dis-po-si\'tion, disposal. Grace\'less, depraved, corrupt.\r\nRep\'ro-bate, one morally lost. Lack\'ey, an attending servant, a footman.\r\nDe-ceased\', dead. Con-vened\', met together, assembled. Im-pri\'mis (Latin),\r\nin the first place. Chaise (pro. shaz), a kind of two-wheeled carriage.\r\nRe-formed\', returned to a good state. Prof\'li-gate, a person openly and\r\nshamelessly vicious. In\'stru-ment (a term in law), a writing expressive of\r\nsome act, con-tract, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--Terms having the same, or nearly the same, meaning, as, "will and\r\ntestament," "give and bequeath," "to have and to hold," "sole and\r\nexclusive," are commonly joined in this way in legal documents.\r\n\r\nPersonal property usually consists of things temporary and movable, while\r\nreal property includes things fixed and immovable such as lands and\r\ntenements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLV. THE NOSE AND THE EYES.\r\n\r\nWilliam Cowper (b. 1731, d. 1800) was the son of an English clergyman, and\r\nwas born in Great Berkhamstead, Hertfordshire, England. He was sent to\r\nWestminster School when he was ten years of age, and he remained there, a\r\ndiligent student, eight years. He then studied law, and was admitted to\r\nthe bar, but he never practiced his profession. He was appointed to a\r\nclerkship in the House of Lords when he was about thirty years old, but he\r\nnever entered upon the discharge of his duties. He became insane, and was\r\nsent to a private asylum. After his recovery, he found a home in the\r\nfamily of the Rev. Mr. Unwin. On the death of this gentleman, he resided\r\nwith the widow till her death--most of the time at Olney. His first\r\nwriting\'s were published in 1782. "The Task," some hymns, a number of\r\nminor poems, and his translations or Homer, composed his published works.\r\nHis insanity returned at times, and darkened a pure and gentle life at its\r\nclose.\r\n\r\n1. Between Nose and Eyes a strange contest arose;\r\n     The spectacles set them, unhappily, wrong;\r\n   The point in dispute was, as all the world knows,\r\n     To which the said spectacles ought to belong.\r\n\r\n2. So Tongue was the lawyer, and argued the cause,\r\n     With a great deal of skill and a wig full of learning,\r\n   While chief baron Ear sat to balance the laws,\r\n     So famed for his talent in nicely discerning.\r\n\r\n3. "In behalf of the Nose, it will quickly appear,\r\n     And your lordship," he said, "will undoubtedly find,\r\n   That the Nose has the spectacles always to wear,\r\n     Which amounts to possession, time out of mind."\r\n\r\n4. Then, holding the spectacles up to the court,\r\n     "Your lordship observes, they are made with a straddle\r\n   As wide as the ridge of the Nose is; in short,\r\n     Designed to sit close to it, just like a saddle.\r\n\r\n5. "Again, would your lordship a moment suppose\r\n     (\'T is a case that has happened, and may happen again)\r\n   That the visage or countenance had not a Nose,\r\n     Pray, who would or who could wear spectacles then?\r\n\r\n6. "On the whole it appears, and my argument shows,\r\n     With a reasoning the court will never condemn,\r\n   That the spectacles plainly were made for the Nose,\r\n     And the Nose was as plainly intended for them."\r\n\r\n7. Then shifting his side (as a lawyer knows how),\r\n     He pleaded again in behalf of the Eyes:\r\n   But what were his arguments, few people know,\r\n     For the court did not think them equally wise.\r\n\r\n8. So his lordship decreed, with a grave, solemn tone,\r\n     Decisive and clear, without one if or but,\r\n   That whenever the Nose put his spectacles on,\r\n     By daylight or candlelight,--Eyes should be shut.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--2. Ar\'gued, discussed, treated by reasoning. Dis-cern\'ing\r\n(pro. diz-zern\'ing), marking as different, distinguishing, 3. Be-half\',\r\nsupport, defense. 8. De-creed\', determined judicially by authority,\r\nordered,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLVI. AN ICEBERG.\r\n\r\nLouis Legrand Noble (b. 1813, d. 1882) was horn in Otsetgo County, New\r\nYork. When twelve years of age, he removed with his family to the wilds of\r\nMichigan, but after the death of his father he returned to New York to\r\nstudy for the ministry, which he entered in 1840. About this time he\r\npublished his first productions, two Indian romances in the form of poems,\r\nentitled "Pewatem" and "Nimahmin." Mr. Noble lived for a time in North\r\nCarolina, and later at Catskill on the Hudson, where he became a warm\r\nfriend of the artist Cole. After the latter\'s death he wrote a memorial of\r\nhim. Other works of this author are "The Hours, and other Poems," and\r\n"After Icebergs with a Painter," from which this selection is taken.\r\n\r\n1. We have just passed a fragment of some one of the surrounding icebergs\r\nthat had amused us. It bore the resemblance of a huge polar bear, reposing\r\nupon the base of an inverted cone, with a twist of a seashell, and\r\nwhirling slowly round and round. The ever-attending green water, with its\r\naerial clearness, enabled us to see its spiral folds and horns as they\r\nhung suspended in the deep.\r\n\r\n2. The bear, a ten-foot mass in tolerable proportion, seemed to be\r\nregularly beset by a pack of hungry little swells. First, one would take\r\nhim on the haunch, then whip back into the sea over his tail and between\r\nhis legs. Presently a bolder swell would rise and pitch into his back with\r\na ferocity that threatened instant destruction. It only washed his satin\r\nfleece the whiter.\r\n\r\n3. While Bruin was turning to look the daring assailant in the face, the\r\nrogue had pitched himself back into his cave. No sooner that, than a very\r\nbulldog of a billow would attack him in the face. The serenity with which\r\nthe impertinent assault was borne was complete. It was but a puff of\r\nsilvery dust, powdering his mane with fresher brightness. Nothing would be\r\nleft of bull but a little froth of all the foam displayed in the fierce\r\nonset. He too would turn and scud into his hiding place.\r\n\r\n4. Persistent little waves! After a dash, singly, all around, upon the\r\ncommon enemy, as if by some silent agreement underwater, they would all\r\nrush on at once, with their loudest roar and shaggiest foam, and overwhelm\r\npoor bear so completely that nothing less might be expected than to behold\r\nhim broken in four quarters, and floating helplessly asunder. Mistaken\r\nspectators! Although, by his momentary rolling and plunging, he was\r\nevidently aroused, yet neither Bruin nor his burrow was at all the worse\r\nfor all the wear and washing.\r\n\r\n5. The deep fluting, the wrinkled folds, and cavities, over and through\r\nwhich the green and silvery water rushed back into the sea, rivaled the\r\nmost exquisite sculpture. And nature not only gives her marbles, with the\r\nfinest lines, the most perfect lights and shades, she colors them also.\r\nShe is no monochromist, but polychroic, imparting such touches of dove\r\ntints, emerald, and azure as she bestows upon her gems and skies.\r\n\r\n6. We are bearing up under the big berg as closely as we dare. To our\r\ndelight, what we have been wishing and watching for is actually taking\r\nplace: loud explosions, with heavy falls of ice, followed by the\r\ncataract-like roar, and the high, thin seas, wheeling away beautifully\r\ncrested with sparkling foam. If it is possible, imagine the effect upon\r\nthe beholder: this precipice of ice, with tremendous cracking, is falling\r\ntoward us with a majestic and awful motion.\r\n\r\n7. Down sinks the long water line into the black deep; down go the\r\nporcelain crags and galleries of glassy sculpture--a speechless and awful\r\nbaptism. Now it pauses, and returns: up rise sculptures and crags\r\nstreaming with the shining white brine; up comes the great encircling\r\nline, followed by things new and strange--crags, niches, balconies, and\r\ncaves; up, up, it rises, higher and higher still, crossing the very breast\r\nof the grand ice, and all bathed with rivulets of gleaming foam. Over goes\r\nthe summit, ridge, pinnacles, and all, standing off obliquely in the\r\nopposite air. Now it pauses in its upward roll: back it comes again,\r\ncracking, cracking, cracking, "groaning out harsh thunder" as it comes,\r\nand threatening to burst, like a mighty bomb, into millions of glittering\r\nfragments. The spectacle is terrific and magnificent. Emotion is\r\nirrepressible, and peals of wild hurrah burst forth from all.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Cone, a solid body having a circular base, from which it\r\ntapers gradually to a point. 2. Swells, waves. 3. Se-ren\'i-ty, quietness,\r\ncalmness. 5. Ex\'qui-site, exceedingly nice, giving rare satisfaction.\r\nSculp\'ture, carved work. Mon\'o-chro-mist, one who paints in a single\r\ncolor. Pol-y-chro\'ic, given to the use of many colors. 7. Pin\'na-cles,\r\nhigh, spirelike points. Ob-lique\'ly, slantingly. Ir-re-press\'i-ble, not to\r\nbe restrained.\r\n\r\n\r\nNotes--Only about one eighth of an iceberg appears above the surface of\r\nthe water. When one side of it grows heavier than another, through unequal\r\nmelting and the action of the waves, the whole mass rolls over in the\r\nwater in the manner so well described in this lesson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLVII. ABOUT QUAIL.\r\n\r\nWilliam Post Hawes (b. 1803, d.1842) was born in New York City. and was a\r\ngraduate of Columbia College. He was a lawyer by profession. His writings\r\nconsist mainly of essays, contributed to various newspapers and magazines,\r\nand show great descriptive power. He was a frequent contributor to the\r\n"Spirit of the Times," under the title of "Cypress, Jr.," on various\r\nsporting topics. After his death a collection of his writings was\r\npublished in two volumes, entitled, "Sporting Scenes" and "Sundry\r\nSketches."\r\n\r\n1. The quail is peculiarly a domestic bird, and is attached to his\r\nbirthplace and the home of his forefathers. The various members of the\r\naquatic families educate their children in the cool summer of the far\r\nnorth, and bathe their warm bosoms in July in the iced waters of Hudson\r\nBay; but when Boreas scatters the rushes where they had builded their\r\nbedchambers, they desert their fatherland, and fly to disport in the sunny\r\nwaters of the south.\r\n\r\n2. The songsters of the woodland, when their customary crops of insects\r\nand berries are cut off in the fall, gather themselves to renew their\r\nloves and get married in more genial climes. Presently, the groves so\r\nvocal, and the sky so full, shall be silent and barren. The "melancholy\r\ndays" will soon be here; only thou, dear Bob White, wilt remain.\r\n\r\n3. The quail is the bird for me. He is no rover, no emigrant. He stays at\r\nhome, and is identified with the soil. Where the farmer works, he lives,\r\nand loves, and whistles. In budding springtime, and in scorching\r\nsummer--in bounteous autumn, and in barren winter, his voice is heard from\r\nthe same bushy hedge fence, and from his customary cedars. Cupidity and\r\ncruelty may drive him to the woods, and to seek more quiet seats; but be\r\nmerciful and kind to him, and he will visit your barnyard, and sing for\r\nyou upon the boughs of the apple tree by your gateway.\r\n\r\n4. When warm May first wooes the young flowers to open and receive her\r\nbreath, then begin the cares and responsibilitie of wedded life. Away fly\r\nthe happy pair to seek some grassy tussock, where, safe from the eye of\r\nthe hawk and the nose of the fox, they may rear their expectant brood in\r\npeace.\r\n\r\n5. Oats harvest arrives, and the fields are waving with yellow grain. Now\r\nbe wary, O kind-hearted cradler, and tread not into those pure white eggs\r\nready to burst with life! Soon there is a peeping sound heard, and lo! a\r\nproud mother walketh magnificently in the midst of her children,\r\nscratching and picking, and teaching them how to swallow. Happy she, if\r\nshe may be permitted to bring them up to maturity, and uncompelled to\r\nrenew her joys in another nest.\r\n\r\n6. The assiduities of a mother have a beauty and a sacredness about them\r\nthat command respect and reverence in all animal nature, human or\r\ninhuman--what a lie does that word carry--except, perhaps, in monsters,\r\ninsects, and fish. I never yet heard of the parental tenderness of a\r\ntrout, eating up his little baby, nor of the filial gratitude of a spider,\r\nnipping the life out of his gray-headed father, and usurping his web.\r\n\r\n7. But if you would see the purest, the sincerest, the most affecting\r\npiety of a parent\'s love, startle a young family of quails, and watch the\r\nconduct of the mother. She will not leave you. No, not she. But she will\r\nfall at your feet, uttering a noise which none but a distressed mother can\r\nmake, and she will run, and flutter, and seem to try to be caught, and\r\ncheat your outstretched hand, and affect to be wing-broken and wounded,\r\nand yet have just strength to tumble along, until she has drawn you,\r\nfatigued, a safe distance from her threatened children and the young hopes\r\nof her heart; and then will she mount, whirring with glad strength, and\r\naway through the maze of trees you have not seen before, like a close-shot\r\nbullet, fly to her skulking infants,\r\n\r\n8. Listen now. Do you hear those three half-plaintive notes, quickly and\r\nclearly poured out? She is calling the boys and girls together. She sings\r\nnot now "Bob White!" nor "Ah! Bob White!" That is her husband\'s love call,\r\nor his trumpet blast of defiance. But she calls sweetly and softly for her\r\nlost children. Hear them "Peep! peep! peep!" at the welcome voice of their\r\nmother\'s love! They are coming together. Soon the whole family will meet\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n9. It is a foul sin to disturb them; but retread your devious way, and let\r\nher hear your coming footsteps, breaking down the briers, as you renew the\r\ndanger. She is quiet. Not a word is passed between the fearful fugitives.\r\nNow, if you have the heart to do it, lie low, keep still, and imitate the\r\ncall of the hen quail. O mother! mother! how your heart would die if you\r\ncould witness the deception! The little ones raise up their trembling\r\nheads, and catch comfort and imagined safety from the sound. "Peep! peep!"\r\nThey come to you, straining their little eyes, and, clustering together\r\nand answering, seem to say, "Where is she? Mother! mother! we are here!"\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1. A-quat\'ic, frequenting the water. 2. Vo\'cal, having a\r\nvoice. 3. I-den\'ti-fied, united. Cu-pid\'i-ty, eager desire to possess\r\nsomething. 4. Tus\'sock, a tuft of grass or twigs. 5. Cra\'dler, one who\r\nuses a cradle, which is an instrument attached to a scythe in cutting\r\ngrain. 6. U-surp\'ing, seizing and holding in possession by force. 7.\r\nAf-fect\', to pretend. 9. De\'vi-ous, winding.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.--l. Boreas is the name which the ancient Greeks gave to\r\nthe north wind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLVIII. THE BLUE AND THE GRAY.\r\n\r\n1. By the flow of the inland river,\r\n     Whence the fleets of iron have fled,\r\n   Where the blades of the grave grass quiver,\r\n     Asleep are the ranks of the dead;--\r\n       Under the sod and the dew,\r\n         Waiting the judgment day;\r\n       Under the one, the Blue;\r\n         Under the other, the Gray.\r\n\r\n2. These, in the robings of glory,\r\n     Those, in the gloom of defeat,\r\n   All, with the battle blood gory,\r\n     In the dusk of eternity meet;--\r\n       Under the sod and the dew,\r\n         Waiting the judgment day;\r\n       Under the laurel, the Blue;\r\n         Under the willow, the Gray.\r\n\r\n3. From the silence of sorrowful hours,\r\n     The desolate mourners go,\r\n   Lovingly laden with flowers,\r\n     Alike for the friend and the foe;--\r\n       Under the sod and the dew,\r\n         Waiting the judgment day;\r\n       Under the roses, the Blue;\r\n         Under the lilies, the Gray.\r\n\r\n4. So, with an equal splendor,\r\n     The morning sun rays fall,\r\n   With a touch, impartially tender,\r\n     On the blossoms blooming for all;--\r\n       Under the sod and the dew,\r\n         Waiting the judgment day;\r\n       Broidered with gold, the Blue;\r\n         Mellowed with gold, the Gray.\r\n\r\n5. So, when the summer calleth,\r\n     On forest and field of grain,\r\n   With an equal murmur falleth\r\n     The cooling drip of the rain;--\r\n       Under the sod and the dew,\r\n         Waiting the judgment day;\r\n       Wet with the rain, the Blue;\r\n         Wet with the rain, the Gray.\r\n\r\n6. Sadly, but not with upbraiding,\r\n     The generous deed was done:\r\n   In the storm of the years that are fading,\r\n     No braver battle was won;--\r\n       Under the sod and the dew,\r\n         Waiting the judgment day;\r\n       Under the blossoms, the Blue;\r\n         Under the garlands, the Gray.\r\n\r\n7. No more shall the war cry sever,\r\n     Or the winding rivers be red;\r\n   They banish our anger forever,\r\n     When they laurel the graves of our dead;--\r\n       Under the sod and the dew,\r\n         Waiting the judgment day;\r\n       Love and tears, for the Blue;\r\n         Tears and love, for the Gray.\r\n                                          --F. M. Finch.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--The above touching little poem first appeared in the "Atlantic\r\nMonthly" in September, 1867. It commemorates the noble action on the part\r\nof the women at Columbus, Miss., who in decorating the graves strewed\r\nflowers impartially on those of the Confederate and of the Federal\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIX. THE MACHINIST\'S RETURN.\r\n\r\n[Adapted from a letter written by a correspondent of the Washington\r\n"Capital."]\r\n\r\n1. On our way from Springfield to Boston, a stout, black-whiskered man\r\nsat immediately in front of me, in the drawing-room car, whose maneuvers\r\nwere a source of constant amusement. He would get up every five minutes,\r\nhurry away to the narrow passage leading to the door of the car, and\r\ncommence laughing in the most violent manner, continuing that healthful\r\nexercise until he observed that some one was watching him, when he would\r\nreturn to his seat.\r\n\r\n2. As we neared Boston these demonstrations increased in frequency and\r\nviolence, but the stranger kept his seat and chuckled to himself. He\r\nshifted the position of his two portmanteaus, or placed them on the seat\r\nas if he was getting ready to leave. As we were at least twenty-five miles\r\nfrom Boston, such early preparations seemed extremely ridiculous. He\r\nbecame so excited at last that he could not keep his secret. Some one must\r\nbe made a confidant; and as I happened to be the nearest to him, he\r\nselected me.\r\n\r\n3. Turning around suddenly, and rocking himself to and fro in his chair,\r\nhe said, "I have been away from home three years. Have been in Europe. My\r\nfolks don\'t expect me for three months yet, but I got through and started.\r\nI telegraphed them at the last station--they\'ve got the dispatch by this\r\ntime." As he said this he rubbed his hands, and changed the portmanteau on\r\nhis left to the right, and then the one on the right to the left.\r\n\r\n4. "Have you a wife?" said I. "Yes, and three children," was the answer.\r\nHe then got up and folded his overcoat anew, and hung it over the back of\r\nthe seat. "You are somewhat nervous just now, are you not?" said I.\r\n\r\n5. "Well, I should think so," he replied. "I have n\'t slept soundly for a\r\nweek. Do you know," he went on, speaking in a low tone, "I am almost\r\ncertain this train will run off the track and break my neck before I get\r\nto Boston. I have had too much good luck lately for one man. It can\'t\r\nlast. It rains so hard, sometimes, that you think it\'s never going to\r\nstop; then it shines so bright you think it\'s always going to shine; and\r\njust as you are settle in either belief, you are knocked over by a change,\r\nto show you that you know nothing about it."\r\n\r\n6. "Well, according to your philosophy," I said, "you will continue to\r\nhave sunshine because you are expecting a storm." "Perhaps so," he\r\nreplied; "but it is curious that the only thing which makes me think I\r\nshall get through safe is, I fear that I shall not."\r\n\r\n7. "I am a machinist," he continued; "I made a discovery; nobody believed\r\nin it; I spent all my money in trying to bring it out; I mortgaged my\r\nhome--everything went. Everybody laughed at me--everybody but my wife. She\r\nsaid she would work her fingers off before I should give it up. I went to\r\nEngland. At first I met with no encouragement whatever, and came very near\r\njumping off London Bridge. I went into a workshop to earn money enough to\r\ncome home with: there I met the man I wanted. To make a long story short,\r\nI\'ve brought home 50,000 Pounds with me, and here I am."\r\n\r\n8. "Good!" I exclaimed. "Yes," said he, "and the best of it is, she knows\r\nnothing about it. She has been disappointed so often that I concluded I\r\nwould not write to her about my unexpected good luck. When I got my money,\r\nthough, I started for home at once."\r\n\r\n9. "And now, I suppose, you will make her happy?" "Happy!" he replied;\r\n"why, you don\'t know anything about it! She\'s worked night and day since I\r\nhave been in England, trying to support herself and the children decently.\r\nThey paid her thirteen cents apiece for making shirts, and that\'s the way\r\nshe has lived half the time. She\'ll come down to the depot to meet me in a\r\ngingham dress and a shawl a hundred years old, and she\'ll think she\'s\r\ndressed up! Perhaps she won\'t have any fine dresses in a week or so, eh?\'"\r\n10. The stranger then strode down the passageway again, and getting in a\r\ncorner where he seemed to suppose that he was out of sight, went through\r\nthe strangest pantomime,--laughing putting his mouth into the drollest\r\nshapes, and swinging himself back and forth in the limited space.\r\n\r\n11. As the train was going into the depot, I placed myself on the platform\r\nof the car in front of the one in which I had been riding, and opposite\r\nthe stranger, who, with a portmanteau in each hand, was standing on the\r\nlowest step, ready to jump to the ground. I looked from his face to the\r\nfaces of the people before us, but saw no sign of recognition. Suddenly he\r\ncried, "There they are!"\r\n\r\n12. Then he laughed outright, but in a hysterical way, as he looked over\r\nthe crowd in front of him. I followed his eye and saw, some distance back,\r\nas if crowded out by the well-dressed and elbowing throng, a little woman\r\nin a faded dress and a well-worn hat, with a face almost painful in its\r\nintense but hopeful expression, glancing rapidly from window to window as\r\nthe coaches passed by.\r\n\r\n13. She had not seen the stranger, but a moment after she caught his eye.\r\nIn another instant he had jumped to the platform with his two\r\nportmanteaus, and, pushing his way through the crowd, he rushed towards\r\nthe place where she was standing. I think I never saw a face assume so\r\nmany different expressions in so short a time as did that of the little\r\nwoman while her husband was on his way to meet her.\r\n\r\n14. She was not pretty,--on the contrary, she was very plain-looking; but\r\nsomehow I felt a big lump rise in my throat as I watched her. She was\r\ntrying to laugh, but, God bless her, how completely she failed in the\r\nattempt! Her mouth got into the position to laugh, but it never moved\r\nafter that, save to draw down at the corners and quiver, while her eyes\r\nblinked so fast that I suspect she only caught occasional glimpses of the\r\nbroad-shouldered fellow who elbowed his way so rapidly toward her.\r\n\r\n15. As he drew close, and dropped the portmanteaus, she turned to one\r\nside, and covered her face with her hands; and thus she was when the\r\nstrong man gathered her up in his arms as if she were a child, and held\r\nher sobbing to his breast.\r\n\r\n16. There were enough staring at them, heaven knows; so I turned my eyes\r\naway a moment, and then I saw two boys in threadbare roundabouts standing\r\nnear, wiping their eyes on their sleeves, and bursting into tears anew at\r\nevery fresh demonstration on the part of their mother. When I looked at\r\nthe stranger again he had his hat drawn over his eyes; but his wife was\r\nlooking up at him, and it seemed as if the pent-up tears of those weary\r\nmonths of waiting were streaming through her eyelids.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1.

His father, a Moravian preacher, sent him to a Moravian school\r\nat Fulneck, Yorkshire, England, to be educated. In 1794 he started "The\r\nSheffield Iris," a weekly paper, which he edited, with marked ability,\r\ntill 1825. He was fined and imprisoned twice for publishing articles\r\ndecided to be seditious. His principal poetical works are "The World\r\nbefore the Flood," "Greenland," "The West Indies," "The Wanderer in\r\nSwitzerland," "The Pelican Island," and "Original Hymns, for Public,\r\nPrivate, and Social Devotion." Mr. Montgomery\'s style is generally too\r\ndiffuse; but its smoothness and the evident sincerity of his emotions have\r\nmade many of his hymns and minor poems very popular. A pension of 300\r\nPounds a year was granted to him in 1833.\r\n\r\n1. "Make way for Liberty!" he cried;\r\n   Made way for Liberty, and died!\r\n\r\n2. In arms the Austrian phalanx stood,\r\n   A living wall, a human wood!\r\n   A wall, where every conscious stone\r\n   Seemed to its kindred thousands grown;\r\n   A rampart all assaults to bear,\r\n   Till time to dust their frames should wear\r\n   A wood like that enchanted grove,\r\n   In which, with fiends, Rinaldo strove,\r\n   Where every silent tree possessed\r\n   A spirit prisoned in its breast,\r\n   Which the first stroke of coming strife\r\n   Would startle into hideous life:\r\n   So dense, so still, the Austrians stood,\r\n   A living wall, a human wood!\r\n\r\n3. Impregnable their front appears,\r\n   All horrent with projected spears,\r\n   Whose polished points before them shine,\r\n   From flank to flank, one brilliant line,\r\n   Bright as the breakers\' splendors run\r\n   Along the billows to the sun.\r\n\r\n4. Opposed to these, a hovering band,\r\n   Contending for their native laud;\r\n   Peasants, whose new-found strength had broke\r\n   From manly necks the ignoble yoke,\r\n   And forged their fetters into swords,\r\n   On equal terms to fight their lords;\r\n   And what insurgent rage had gained,\r\n   In many a mortal fray maintained:\r\n   Marshaled once more at Freedom\'s call,\r\n   They came to conquer or to fall,\r\n   Where he who conquered, he who fell.\r\n   Was deemed a dead or living Tell!\r\n\r\n5. And now the work of life and death\r\n   Hung on the passing of a breath;\r\n   The fire of conflict burned within;\r\n   The battle trembled to begin;\r\n   Yet, while the Austrians held their ground,\r\n   Point for attack was nowhere found;\r\n   Where\'er the impatient Switzers gazed,\r\n   The unbroken line of lances blazed;\r\n   That line \'t were suicide to meet,\r\n   And perish at their tyrants\' feet;\r\n   How could they rest within their graves,\r\n   And leave their homes the home of slaves?\r\n   Would they not feel their children tread\r\n   With clanking chains above their head?\r\n\r\n6. It must not be: this day, this hour,\r\n   Annihilates the oppressor\'s power\r\n   All Switzerland is in the field,\r\n   She will not fly, she can not yield;\r\n   Few were the numbers she could boast,\r\n   But every freeman was a host,\r\n   And felt as though himself were he\r\n   On whose sole arm hung victory.\r\n\r\n7. It did depend on one, indeed:\r\n   Behold him! Arnold Winkelried!\r\n   There sounds not to the trump of fame\r\n   The echo of a nobler name.\r\n   Unmarked he stood amid the throng,\r\n   In rumination deep and long,\r\n   Till you might see with sudden grace,\r\n   The very thought come o\'er his face;\r\n   And by the motion of his form:\r\n   Anticipate the bursting storm;\r\n   And by the uplifting of his brow,\r\n   Tell where the bolt would strike, and how.\r\n   But \'t was no sooner thought than done;\r\n   The field was in a moment won.\r\n\r\n8. "Make way for Liberty!" he cried:\r\n   Then ran, with arms extended wide,\r\n   As if his dearest friend to clasp;\r\n   Ten spears he swept within his grasp:\r\n   "Make way for Liberty!" he cried,\r\n   Their keen points met from side to side;\r\n   He bowed among them like a tree,\r\n   And thus made way for Liberty.\r\n\r\n9. Swift to the breach his comrades fly;\r\n   "Make way for Liberty!" they cry,\r\n   And through the Austrian phalanx dart,\r\n   As rushed the spears through Arnold\'s heart;\r\n   While instantaneous as his fall,\r\n   Rout, ruin, panic, scattered all.\r\n   An earthquake could not overthrow\r\n   A city with a surer blow.\r\n\r\n10. Thus Switzerland again was free,\r\n    Thus Death made way for Liberty!\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--2. Pha\'lanx, a body of troops formed in close array.\r\nCon\'scious, sensible, knowing. Kin\'dred, those of like nature, relatives.\r\nRam\'part, that which defends from assault, a bulwark. 3. Im-preg\'na-ble,\r\nthat can not be moved or shaken. Hor\'rent, standing out like bristles. 4.\r\nIn-sur\'gent, rising in opposition to authority. 13. An-ni\'hi-lates,\r\ndestroys. 7. Ru-mi-na\'tion, the act of musing, meditation. 9. Breach, a\r\ngap or opening made by breaking.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--The incident related in this poem is one of actual occurrence, and\r\ntook place at the battle of Sempach, fought in 1386 A.D., between only\r\n1,300 Swiss and a large army of Austrians. The latter had obtained\r\npossession of a narrow pass in the mountains, from which it seemed\r\nimpossible to dislodge them until Arnold von Winkelried made a breach in\r\ntheir line, as narrated.\r\n\r\nRinaldo is a knight in Tasso\'s "Jerusalem Delivered" (Canto XVIII, 17-40),\r\nwho enters an enchanted wood, and, by cutting down a tree in spite of the\r\nnymphs and phantoms that endeavor in every way to stop him, breaks the\r\nspell; the Christian army are thus enabled to enter the grove and obtain\r\ntimber for their engines of war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXI. THE ENGLISH SKYLARK.\r\n\r\nElihu Burritt (b. 1810, d. 1879). "the learned blacksmith," was born in\r\nNew Britain, Conn. His father was a shoemaker. Having received only a\r\nlimited amount of instruction at the district school, he was apprenticed\r\nto a blacksmith about 1827. During his apprenticeship he labored hard at\r\nself-instruction. He worked at his trade many years, from ten to twelve\r\nhours each day, but managed, in the meantime to acquire a knowledge of\r\nmany ancient and modern languages. He made translations from several of\r\nthese, which were published in the "American Eclectic Review." In 1844 he\r\ncommenced the publication of "The Christian Citizen." His leading literary\r\nworks are "Sparks from the Anvil," "A Voice from the Forge," "Peace\r\nPapers," and "Walks to John o\' Groat\'s House." From the last of these the\r\nfollowing selection is abridged.\r\n\r\n1. Take it in all, no bird in either hemisphere equals the English lark in\r\nheart or voice, for both unite to make it the sweetest, the happiest, the\r\nwelcomest singer that was ever winged, like the high angels of God\'s love.\r\nIt is the living ecstasy of joy when it mounts up into its "glorious\r\nprivacy of light."\r\n\r\n2. On the earth it is timid, silent, and bashful, as if not at home, and\r\nnot sure of its right to be there at all. It is rather homely withal,\r\nhaving nothing in feather, feature, or form to attract notice. It is\r\nseemingly made to be heard, not seen, reversing the old axiom addressed to\r\nchildren when getting noisy.\r\n\r\n3. Its mission is music, and it floods a thousand acres of the blue sky\r\nwith it several times a day. Out of that palpitating speck of living joy\r\nthere wells forth a sea of twittering ecstasy upon the morning and evening\r\nair. It does not ascend by gyrations, like the eagle and birds of prey. It\r\nmounts up like a human aspiration.\r\n\r\n4. It seems to spread its wings and to be lifted straight upwards out of\r\nsight by the afflatus of its own happy heart. To pour out this in\r\nundulating rivulets of rhapsody is apparently the only motive of its\r\nascension. This it is that has made it so loved of all generations.\r\n\r\n5. It is the singing angel of man\'s nearest heaven, whose vital breath is\r\nmusic. Its sweet warbling is only the metrical palpitation of its life of\r\njoy. It goes up over the rooftrees of the rural hamlet on the wings of its\r\nsong, as if to train the human soul to trial flights heavenward.\r\n\r\n6. Never did the Creator put a voice of such volume into so small a living\r\nthing. It is a marvel--almost a miracle. In a still hour you can hear it\r\nat nearly a mile\'s distance. When its form is lost in the hazy lace work\r\nof the sun\'s rays above, it pours down upon you all the thrilling\r\nsemitones of its song as distinctly as if it were warbling to you in your\r\nwindow.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Ec\'sta-sy, overmastering joy, rapture. 2. Ax\'i-om, a\r\nself-evident truth. 3. Pal\'pi-tat-ing, throbbing, fluttering. Wells,\r\npours, flows. Gy-ra\'tions, circular or spiral motions. 4. Af--fla\'tus,\r\nbreath, inspiration. Un\'du-la-ting, rising and falling like waves.\r\nRhap\'so-dy, that which is uttered in a disconnected way under strong\r\nexcitement. Gen-er-a\'tion, the mass of beings at one period. 5.\r\nMet\'ric-al, arranged in measures, as poetry and music. Roof \'tree, the\r\nbeam in the angle of a roof, hence the roof itself. Ham\'let, a little\r\ncluster of houses.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXII. HOW SLEEP THE BRAVE.\r\n\r\nWilliam Collins (b. 1721, d. 1759) was born at Chichester, England. He was\r\neducated at Winchester and Oxford. About 1745, he went to London as a\r\nliterary adventurer, and there won the esteem of Dr. Johnson. His "Odes"\r\nwere published in 1746, but were not popular. He was subsequently relieved\r\nfrom pecuniary embarrassment by a legacy of 2,000 Pounds from a maternal\r\nuncle; but he soon became partially insane, and was for some time confined\r\nin an asylum for lunatics. He afterwards retired to Chichester, where he\r\nwas cared for by his sister until his death.\r\n\r\n1. How sleep the brave who sink to rest\r\n   By all their country\'s wishes blessed!\r\n   When Spring, with dewy fingers cold,\r\n   Returns to deck their hallowed mold,\r\n   She there shall dress a sweeter sod\r\n   Than Fancy\'s feet have ever trod.\r\n\r\n2. By fairy hands their knell is rung;\r\n   By forms unseen their dirge is sung;\r\n   There honor comes a pilgrim gray,\r\n   To bless the turf that wraps their clay;\r\n   And Freedom shall awhile repair\r\n   To dwell a weeping hermit there!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXIII. THE RAINBOW.\r\n\r\nJohn Keble (b. 1792. d. 1866) was born near Fairfax, Gloucestershire,\r\nEngland. He graduated at Oxford with remarkably high honors, and\r\nafterwards was appointed to the professorship of poetry in that\r\nuniversity. Since his death, Keble College, at Oxford, has been erected to\r\nhis memory. In 1835, he became vicar of Hursley and rector of Otterbourne,\r\nand held these livings until his death. His most famous work is "The\r\nChristian Year," a collection of sacred poems.\r\n\r\n1. A fragment of a rainbow bright\r\n     Through the moist air I see,\r\n   All dark and damp on yonder height,\r\n     All bright and clear to me.\r\n\r\n2. An hour ago the storm was here,\r\n     The gleam was far behind;\r\n   So will our joys and grief appear,\r\n     When earth has ceased to blind.\r\n\r\n3. Grief will be joy if on its edge\r\n     Fall soft that holiest ray,\r\n   Joy will be grief if no faint pledge\r\n     Be there of heavenly day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXIV. SUPPOSED SPEECH OF JOHN ADAMS.\r\n\r\nDaniel Webster (b. 1782, d. 1852) was born in Salisbury, N.H. He spent a\r\nfew months of his boyhood at Phillips Academy, Exeter, but fitted for\r\ncollege under Rev. Samuel Wood, of Boscawen, N.H. He graduated from\r\nDartmouth College in 1801. He taught school several terms, during and\r\nafter his college course. In 1805, he was admitted to the bar in Boston,\r\nand practiced law in New Hampshire for the succeeding eleven years. In\r\n1812, he was elected to the United States House of Representatives. In\r\n1816, he removed to Boston, and in 1827 was elected to the United States\r\nSenate, which position he held for twelve years. In 1841, he was appointed\r\nSecretary of State. He returned to the Senate in 1845. In 1850, he was\r\nreappointed Secretary of State and continued in office until his death. He\r\ndied at his residence, in Marshfield, Mass. Mr. Webster\'s fame rests\r\nchiefly on his state papers and speeches. As a speaker he was dignified\r\nand stately, using clear, pure English. During all his life he took great\r\ninterest in agriculture, and was very fond of outdoor sports.\r\n\r\n1. Sink or swim, live or die, survive or perish, I give my hand and my\r\nheart to this vote. It is true, indeed, that, in the beginning, we aimed\r\nnot at independence. But\r\n\r\n   "There\'s a divinity that shapes our ends."\r\n\r\nThe injustice of England has driven us to arms; and blinded to her own\r\ninterest, she has obstinately persisted, till independence is now within\r\nour grasp. We have but to reach forth to it, and it is ours. Why then\r\nshould we defer the declaration? Is any man so weak as now to hope for a\r\nreconciliation with England, which shall leave either safety to the\r\ncountry and its liberties, or security to his own life and his own honor!\r\nAre not you, sir, who sit in that chair, is not he, our venerable\r\ncolleague, near you, are you not both already the proscribed and\r\npredestined objects of punishment and of vengeance? Cut off from all hope\r\nof royal clemency, what are you, what can you be, while the power of\r\nEngland remains, but outlaws?\r\n\r\n2. If we postpone independence, do we mean to carry on, or to give up, the\r\nwar? Do we mean to submit, and consent that we shall be ground to powder,\r\nand our country and its rights trodden down in the dust? I know we do not\r\nmean to submit. We NEVER shall submit! Do we intend to violate that most\r\nsolemn obligation ever entered into by men, that plighting, before God, of\r\nour sacred honor to Washington, when, putting him forth to incur the\r\ndangers of war, as well as the political hazards of the times, we promised\r\nto adhere to him in every extremity with our fortunes and our lives? I\r\nknow there is not a man here, who would not rather see a general\r\nconflagration sweep over the land, or an earthquake sink it, than one jot\r\nor tittle of that plighted faith fall to the ground. For myself, having\r\ntwelve months ago, in this place, moved you that George Washington be\r\nappointed commander of the forces raised, or to be raised, for the defense\r\nof American liberty; may my right hand forget her cunning, and my tongue\r\ncleave to the roof of my mouth, if I hesitate or waver in the support I\r\ngive him.\r\n\r\n3. The war, then, must go on. We must fight it through. And if the war\r\nmust go on, why put off the Declaration of Independence? That measure will\r\nstrengthen us. It will give us character abroad. Nations will then treat\r\nwith us, which they never can do while we acknowledge ourselves subjects\r\nin arms against our sovereign. Nay, I maintain that England herself will\r\nsooner treat for peace with us on the footing of independence, than\r\nconsent, by repealing her acts, to acknowledge that her whole conduct\r\ntoward us has been a course of injustice and oppression. Her pride will be\r\nless wounded by submitting to that course of things, which now\r\npredestinates our independence, than by yielding the points in controversy\r\nto her rebellious subjects. The former, she would regard as the result of\r\nfortune; the latter, she would feel as her own deep disgrace. Why, then,\r\ndo we not change this from a civil to a national war? And since we must\r\nfight it through, why not put ourselves in a state to enjoy all the\r\nbenefits of victory, if we gain the victory.\r\n\r\n4. If we fail, it can be no worse for us. But we shall not fail. The cause\r\nwill raise up armies; the cause will create navies. The people--the\r\npeople, if we are true to them, will carry us, and will carry themselves,\r\ngloriously through this struggle. I care not how fickle other people have\r\nbeen found. I know the people of these colonies; and I know that\r\nresistance to British aggression is deep and settled in their hearts, and\r\ncan not be eradicated. Sir, the Declaration of Independence will inspire\r\nthe people with increased courage. Instead of a long and bloody war for\r\nthe restoration of privileges, for redress of grievances, for chartered\r\nimmunities, held under a British king, set before them the glorious object\r\nof entire independence, and it will breathe into them anew the spirit of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n5. Read this declaration at the head of the army; every sword will be\r\ndrawn, and the solemn vow uttered to maintain it, or perish on the bed of\r\nhonor. Publish it from the pulpit; religion will approve it, and the love\r\nof religious liberty will cling around it, resolved to stand with it or\r\nfall with it. Send it to the public halls; proclaim it there; let them see\r\nit who saw their brothers and their sons fall on the field of Bunker Hill\r\nand in the streets of Lexington and Concord, and the very walls will cry\r\nout in its support.\r\n\r\n6. Sir, I know the uncertainty of human affairs, but I see--I see clearly\r\nthrough this day\'s business. You and I, indeed, may rue it. We may not\r\nlive to see the time this declaration shall be made good. We may die; die\r\ncolonists; die slaves; die, it may be, ignominiously and on the scaffold.\r\nBe it so: be it so. If it be the pleasure of Heaven that my country shall\r\nrequire the poor offering of my life, the victim shall be ready at the\r\nappointed hour of sacrifice, come when that hour may. But while I do live,\r\nlet me have a country, or at least the hope of a country, and that a FREE\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\n7. But whatever may be our fate, be assured--be assured that this\r\nDeclaration will stand. It may cost treasure, and it may cost blood; but\r\nit will stand, and it will richly compensate for both. Through the thick\r\ngloom of the present I see the brightness of the future as the sun in\r\nheaven. We shall make this a glorious, an immortal day. When we are in our\r\ngraves, our children will honor it. They will celebrate it with\r\nthanksgiving, with festivity, with bonfires, and illuminations. On its\r\nannual return they will shed tears,--copious, gushing tears; not of\r\nsubjection and slavery, not of agony and distress, but of exultation, of\r\ngratitude, and of joy.\r\n\r\n8. Sir, before God I believe the hour is come. My judgment approves the\r\nmeasure, and my whole heart is in it. All that I have, and all that I am,\r\nand all that I hope in this life, I am now ready here to stake upon it;\r\nand I leave off as I began, that, live or die, survive or perish, I am for\r\nthe Declaration. It is my living sentiment, and, by the blessing of God,\r\nit shall by my dying sentiment; independence now, and INDEPENDENCE\r\nFOREVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1.

He then supposes Mr. Adams to have replied in the language\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n1. The quotation is from "Hamlet," Act V, Scene 2.\r\n\r\nYou, sir, who sit in that chair. This was addressed to John Hancock,\r\npresident of the Continental Congress. Our venerable colleague refers to\r\nSamuel Adams. After the battles of Concord and Lexington, Governor Gage\r\noffered pardon to all the rebels who would lay down their arms, excepting\r\nSamuel Adams and John Hancock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXV. THE RISING.\r\n\r\nThomas Buchanan Read (b. 1822, d. 1872) was born in Chester County,\r\nPennsylvania. In 1839 he entered a sculptor\'s studio in Cincinnati, where\r\nhe gained reputation as a portrait painter. He afterwards went to New\r\nYork, Boston, and Philadelphia, and, in 1850, to Italy. He divided his\r\ntime between Cincinnati, Philadelphia, and Rome, in the latter years of\r\nhis life. Some or his poems are marked by vigor and strength, while others\r\nare distinguished by smoothness and delicacy. The following selection is\r\nabridged from "The Wagoner of the Alleghanies."\r\n\r\n1. Out of the North the wild news came,\r\n   Far flashing on its wings of flame,\r\n   Swift as the boreal light which flies\r\n   At midnight through the startled skies.\r\n\r\n2. And there was tumult in the air,\r\n     The fife\'s shrill note, the drum\'s loud beat,\r\n   And through the wide land everywhere\r\n     The answering tread of hurrying feet,\r\n   While the first oath of Freedom\'s gun\r\n   Came on the blast from Lexington.\r\n   And Concord, roused, no longer tame,\r\n   Forgot her old baptismal name,\r\n   Made bare her patriot arm of power,\r\n   And swelled the discord of the hour.\r\n\r\n3. The yeoman and the yoeman\'s son,\r\n     With knitted brows and sturdy dint,\r\n   Renewed the polish of each gun,\r\n     Recoiled the lock, reset the flint;\r\n   And oft the maid and matron there,\r\n   While kneeling in the firelight glare,\r\n   Long poured, with half-suspended breath,\r\n   The lead into the molds of death.\r\n\r\n4. The hands by Heaven made silken soft\r\n     To soothe the brow of love or pain,\r\n   Alas! are dulled and soiled too oft\r\n     By some unhallowed earthly stain;\r\n   But under the celestial bound\r\n   No nobler picture can be found\r\n   Than woman, brave in word and deed,\r\n   Thus serving in her nation\'s need:\r\n   Her love is with her country now,\r\n   Her hand is on its aching brow.\r\n\r\n5. Within its shade of elm and oak\r\n     The church of Berkley Manor stood:\r\n   There Sunday found the rural folk,\r\n     And some esteemed of gentle blood,\r\n   In vain their feet with loitering tread\r\n     Passed \'mid the graves where rank is naught:\r\n     All could not read the lesson taught\r\n   In that republic of the dead.\r\n\r\n6. The pastor rose: the prayer was strong;\r\n   The psalm was warrior David\'s song;\r\n   The text, a few short words of might,--\r\n   "The Lord of hosts shall arm the right!"\r\n\r\n7. He spoke of wrongs too long endured,\r\n   Of sacred rights to be secured;\r\n   Then from his patriot tongue of flame\r\n   The startling words for Freedom came.\r\n   The stirring sentences he spake\r\n   Compelled the heart to glow or quake,\r\n   And, rising on his theme\'s broad wing,\r\n     And grasping in his nervous hand\r\n     The imaginary battle brand,\r\n   In face of death he dared to fling\r\n   Defiance to a tyrant king.\r\n\r\n8. Even as he spoke, his frame, renewed\r\n   In eloquence of attitude,\r\n   Rose, as it seemed, a shoulder higher;\r\n   Then swept his kindling glance of fire\r\n   From startled pew to breathless choir;\r\n   When suddenly his mantle wide\r\n   His hands impatient flung aside,\r\n   And, lo! he met their wondering eyes\r\n   Complete in all a warrior\'s guise.\r\n\r\n9. A moment there was awful pause,--\r\n     When Berkley cried, "Cease, traitor! cease!\r\n     God\'s temple is the house of peace!"\r\n   The other shouted, "Nay, not so,\r\n   When God is with our righteous cause:\r\n     His holiest places then are ours,\r\n     His temples are our forts and towers\r\n   That frown upon the tyrant foe:\r\n   In this the dawn of Freedom\'s day\r\n   There is a time to fight and pray!"\r\n\r\n10. And now before the open door--\r\n      The warrior priest had ordered so--\r\n    The enlisting trumpet\'s sudden soar\r\n      Rang through the chapel, o\'er and o\'er,\r\n    Its long reverberating blow,\r\n    So loud and clear, it seemed the ear\r\n    Of dusty death must wake and hear.\r\n    And there the startling drum and fife\r\n    Fired the living with fiercer life;\r\n    While overhead with wild increase,\r\n    Forgetting its ancient toll of peace,\r\n      The great bell swung as ne\'er before:\r\n    It seemed as it would never cease;\r\n    And every word its ardor flung\r\n    From off its jubilant iron tongue\r\n      Was, "WAR! WAR! WAR!"\r\n\r\n11. "Who dares"--this was the patriot\'s cry,\r\n      As striding from the desk he came--\r\n      "Come out with me, in Freedom\'s name,\r\n    For her to live, for her to die?"\r\n    A hundred hands flung up reply,\r\n    A hundred voices answered "I!"\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--l. Bo\'re-al, northern. 3. Yeo\'man, a freeholder, a man\r\nfreeborn. Dint, stroke. 5. Man\'or, a tract of land occupied by tenants.\r\nGen\'tle (pro. jen\'tl), well born, of good family.  7.

The reference is to the meaning of the\r\nword "concord,"--harmony, union.\r\n\r\n4. Celestial bound; i.e., the sky, heaven.\r\n\r\n6. The pastor. This was John Peter Gabriel Muhlenberg, who was at this\r\ntime a minister at Woodstock, in Virginia. He was a leading spirit among\r\nthose opposed to Great Britain, and in 1775 he was elected colonel of a\r\nVirginia regiment. The above poem describes his farewell sermon. At its\r\nclose he threw off his ministerial gown, and appeared in full regimental\r\ndress. Almost every man in the congregation enlisted under him at the\r\nchurch door. Muhlenberg became a well-known general in the Revolution, and\r\nafter the war served his country in Congress and in various official\r\npositions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXVI. CONTROL YOUR TEMPER.\r\n\r\nJohn Todd, D.D. (b. 1800, d. 1873), was born in Rutland, Vt. In 1842 he\r\nwas settled as a pastor of a Congregational Church, in Pittsfield, Mass,\r\nIn 1834, he published "Lectures to Children"; in 1835, "The Student\'s\r\nManual," a valuable and popular work, which has been translated into\r\nseveral European languages; in 1836, "The Sabbath-School Teacher"; and in\r\n1841, "The Lost Sister of Wyoming." He was one of the founders of the\r\nMount Holyoke Female Seminary.\r\n\r\n1. No one has a temper naturally so good, that it does not need attention\r\nand cultivation, and no one has a temper so bad, but that, by proper\r\nculture, it may become pleasant. One of the best disciplined tempers ever\r\nseen, was that of a gentleman who was naturally quick, irritable, rash,\r\nand violent; but, by having the care of the sick, and especially of\r\nderanged people, he so completely mastered himself that he was never known\r\nto be thrown off his guard.\r\n\r\n2. The difference in the happiness which is received or bestowed by the\r\nman who governs his temper, and that by the man who does not, is immense.\r\nThere is no misery so constant, so distressing, and so intolerable to\r\nothers, as that of having a disposition which is your master, and which is\r\ncontinually fretting itself. There are corners enough, at every turn in\r\nlife, against which we may run, and at which we may break out in\r\nimpatience, if we choose.\r\n\r\n3. Look at Roger Sherman, who rose from a humble occupation to a seat in\r\nthe first Congress of the United States, and whose judgment was received\r\nwith great deference by that body of distinguished men. He made himself\r\nmaster of his temper, and cultivated it as a great business in life. There\r\nare one or two instances which show this part of his character in a light\r\nthat is beautiful.\r\n\r\n4. One day, after having received his highest honors, he was sitting and\r\nreading in his parlor. A roguish student, in a room close by, held a\r\nlooking-glass in such a position as to pour the reflected rays of the sun\r\ndirectly in Mr. Sherman\'s face. He moved his chair, and the thing was\r\nrepeated. A third time the chair was moved, but the looking-glass still\r\nreflected the sun in his eyes. He laid aside his book, went to the window,\r\nand many witnesses of the impudence expected to hear the ungentlemanly\r\nstudent severely reprimanded. He raised the window gently, and then--shut\r\nthe window blind!\r\n\r\n5. I can not forbear adducing another instance of the power he had\r\nacquired over himself. He was naturally possessed of strong passions; but\r\nover these he at length obtained an extraordinary control. He became\r\nhabitually calm, sedate, and self-possessed. Mr. Sherman was one of those\r\nmen who are not ashamed to maintain the forms of religion in their\r\nfamilies. One morning he called them all together, as usual, to lead them\r\nin prayer to God; the "old family Bible" was brought out, and laid on the\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n6. Mr. Sherman took his seat, and placed beside him one of his children, a\r\nchild of his old age; the rest of the family were seated around the room;\r\nseveral of these were now grown up. Besides these, some of the tutors of\r\nthe college were boarders in the family, and were present at the time\r\nalluded to. His aged and superannuated mother occupied a corner of the\r\nroom, opposite the place where the distinguished judge sat.\r\n\r\n7. At length, he opened the Bible, and began to read. The child who was\r\nseated beside him made some little disturbance, upon which Mr. Sherman\r\npaused and told it to be still. Again he proceeded; but again he paused to\r\nreprimand the little offender, whose playful disposition would scarcely\r\npermit it to be still. And this time he gently tapped its ear. The blow,\r\nif blow it might be called, caught the attention of his aged mother, who\r\nnow, with some effort, rose from the seat, and tottered across the room.\r\nAt length she reached the chair of Mr. Sherman, and, in a moment, most\r\nunexpectedly to him, she gave him a blow on the ear with all the force she\r\ncould summon. "There," said she, "you strike your child, and I will strike\r\nmine."\r\n\r\n8. For a moment, the blood was seen mounting to the face of Mr. Sherman;\r\nbut it was only for a moment, when all was calm and mild as usual. He\r\npaused; he raised his spectacles; he cast his eye upon his mother; again\r\nit fell upon the book from which he had been reading. Not a word escaped\r\nhim; but again he calmly pursued the service, and soon after sought in\r\nprayer an ability to set an example before his household which would be\r\nworthy of their imitation. Such a victory was worth more than the proudest\r\none ever achieved on the field of battle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Con-trol\', subdue, restrain, govern. Cul\'ture,\r\ncultivation, improvement by effort. Dis\'ci-plined, brought under control,\r\ntrained.  2. In-tol\'er-a-ble, not capable of being borne. 3. Def \'er-ence,\r\nregard, respect. 4.

A-chieved\',\r\ngained.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.--Roger Sherman (b. 1721, d. 1793) was born at Newton Massachusetts,\r\nand until twenty-two years of age was a shoemaker. He then removed to\r\nNew Milford, Connecticut, and was soon afterward appointed surveyor of\r\nlands for the county. In 1754, he was admitted to the bar. At various\r\ntimes he was elected a judge; sent to the Legislature, to the Colonial\r\nAssembly, and to the United States Congress; made a member of the\r\ngovernor\'s council of safety; and, in 1776, a member of the committee\r\nappointed to draft the Declaration of Independence, of which he was one of\r\nthe signers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXVII. WILLIAM TELL.\r\n\r\nJames Sheridan Knowles (b. 1784, d. 1862), a dramatist and actor, was born\r\nin Cork, Ireland. In 1792 his father removed to London with his family. At\r\nthe age of fourteen, Sheridan wrote an opera called "The Chevalier de\r\nGrillon." In 1798 he removed to Dublin, and soon after began his career as\r\nan actor and author. In 1835 he visited America. In 1839 an annual pension\r\nof 200 Pounds was granted him by the British government. Several years\r\nbefore his death he left the stage and became a Baptist minister. The best\r\nknown of his plays are "Caius Gracchus," "Virginius," "Leo, the Gypsy,"\r\n"The Hunchback," and "William Tell," from the last of which the following\r\ntwo lessons are abridged.\r\n\r\nSCENE 1.--A Chamber in the Castle. Enter Gesler, Officers, and Sarnem,\r\nwith Tell in chains and guarded.\r\n\r\nSar. Down, slave! Behold the governor.\r\n     Down! down! and beg for mercy.\r\n\r\nGes. (Seated.) Does he hear?\r\n\r\nSar. He does, but braves thy power.\r\n\r\nOfficer. Why don\'t you smite him for that look?\r\n\r\nGes. Can I believe\r\n     My eyes? He smiles! Nay, grasps\r\n     His chains as he would make a weapon of them\r\n     To lay the smiter dead. (To Tell.)\r\n     Why speakest thou not?\r\n\r\nTell. For wonder.\r\n\r\nGes. Wonder?\r\n\r\nTell. Yes, that thou shouldst seem a man.\r\n\r\nGes. What should I seem?\r\n\r\nTell. A monster.\r\n\r\nGes. Ha! Beware! Think on thy chains.\r\n\r\nTell. Though they were doubled, and did weigh me down\r\n      Prostrate to the earth, methinks I could rise up\r\n      Erect, with nothing but the honest pride\r\n      Of telling thee, usurper, to thy teeth,\r\n      Thou art a monster! Think upon my chains?\r\n      How came they on me?\r\n\r\nGes. Darest thou question me?\r\n\r\nTell. Darest thou not answer?\r\n\r\nGes. Do I hear?\r\n\r\nTell. Thou dost.\r\n\r\nGes. Beware my vengeance!\r\n\r\nTell. Can it more than kill?\r\n\r\nGes. Enough; it can do that.\r\n\r\nTell. No; not enough:\r\n      It can not take away the grace of life;\r\n      Its comeliness of look that virtue gives;\r\n      Its port erect with consciousness of truth;\r\n      Its rich attire of honorable deeds;\r\n      Its fair report that\'s rife on good men\'s tongues;\r\n      It can not lay its hands on these, no more\r\n      Than it can pluck the brightness from the sun,\r\n      Or with polluted finger tarnish it.\r\n\r\nGes. But it can make thee writhe.\r\n\r\nTell. It may.\r\n\r\nGes. And groan.\r\n\r\nTell. It may; and I may cry\r\n      Go on, though it should make me groan again.\r\n\r\nGes. Whence comest thou?\r\n\r\nTell. From the mountains. Wouldst thou learn\r\n      What news from thence?\r\n\r\nGes. Canst tell me any?\r\n\r\nTell. Ay: they watch no more the avalanche.\r\n\r\nGes. Why so?\r\n\r\nTell. Because they look for thee. The hurricane\r\n      Comes unawares upon them; from its bed\r\n      The torrent breaks, and finds them in its track.\r\n\r\nGes. What do they then?\r\n\r\nTell. Thank heaven it is not thou!\r\n      Thou hast perverted nature in them.\r\n      There\'s not a blessing heaven vouchsafes them, but\r\n      The thought of thee--doth wither to a curse.\r\n\r\nGes. That\'s right! I\'d have them like their hills,\r\n     That never smile, though wanton summer tempt\r\n     Them e\'er so much.\r\n\r\nTell. But they do sometimes smile.\r\n\r\nGes. Ay! when is that?\r\n\r\nTell. When they do talk of vengeance.\r\n\r\nGes. Vengeance? Dare they talk of that?\r\n\r\nTell. Ay, and expect it too.\r\n\r\nGes. From whence?\r\n\r\nTell. From heaven!\r\n\r\nGes. From heaven?\r\n\r\nTell. And their true hands\r\n      Are lifted up to it on every hill\r\n      For justice on thee.\r\n\r\nGes. Where\'s thy abode?\r\n\r\nTell. I told thee, on the mountains.\r\n\r\nGes. Art married?\r\n\r\nTell. Yes.\r\n\r\nGes. And hast a family?\r\n\r\nTell. A son.\r\n\r\nGes. A son? Sarnem!\r\n\r\nSar. My lord, the boy--(Gesler signs to Sarnem to keep\r\n        silence, and, whispering, sends him off.)\r\n\r\nTell. The boy? What boy?\r\n      Is \'t mine? and have they netted my young fledgeling?\r\n      Now heaven support me, if they have! He\'ll own me,\r\n      And share his father\'s ruin! But a look\r\n      Would put him on his guard--yet how to give it!\r\n      Now heart, thy nerve; forget thou \'rt flesh, be rock.\r\n      They come, they come!\r\n      That step--that step--that little step, so light\r\n      Upon the ground, how heavy does it fall\r\n      Upon my heart! I feel my child! (Enter Sarnem\r\n         with Albert, whose eyes are riveted on Tell\'s bow,\r\n         which Sarnem carries.)\r\n      \'T is he! We can but perish.\r\n\r\nAlb. (Aside.) Yes; I was right. It is my father\'s bow!\r\n     For there\'s my father! I\'ll not own him though!\r\n\r\nSar. See!\r\n\r\nAlb. What?\r\n\r\nSar. Look there!\r\n\r\nAlb. I do, what would you have me see?\r\n\r\nSar. Thy father.\r\n\r\nAlb. Who? That--that my father?\r\n\r\nTell. My boy! my boy! my own brave boy!\r\n      He\'s safe! (Aside.)\r\n\r\nSar. (Aside to Gesler.) They\'re like each other.\r\n\r\nGes. Yet I see no sign\r\n     Of recognition to betray the link\r\n     Unites a father and his child.\r\n\r\nSar. My lord,\r\n     I am sure it is his father. Look at them.\r\n     That boy did spring from him; or never cast\r\n     Came from the mold it fitted! It may be\r\n     A preconcerted thing \'gainst such a chance.\r\n     That they survey each other coldly thus.\r\n\r\nGes. We shall try. Lead forth the caitiff.\r\n\r\nSar. To a dungeon?\r\n\r\nGes. No; into the court.\r\n\r\nSar. The court, my lord?\r\n\r\nGes. And send\r\n     To tell the headsman to make ready. Quick!\r\n     The slave shall die! You marked the boy?\r\n\r\nSar. I did. He started; \'t is his father.\r\n\r\nGes. We shall see. Away with him!\r\n\r\nTell. Stop! Stop!\r\n\r\nGes. What would you?\r\n\r\nTell. Time,--\r\n      A little time to call my thoughts together!\r\n\r\nGes. Thou shalt not have a minute.\r\n\r\nTell. Some one, then, to speak with.\r\n\r\nGes. Hence with him!\r\n\r\nTell. A moment! Stop!\r\n      Let me speak to the boy.\r\n\r\nGes. Is he thy son?\r\n\r\nTell. And if\r\n      He were, art thou so lost to nature, as\r\n      To send me forth to die before his face?\r\n\r\nGes. Well! speak with him.\r\n     Now, Sarnem, mark them well.\r\n\r\nTell. Thou dost not know me, boy; and well for thee\r\n      Thou dost not. I\'m the father of a son\r\n      About thy age. Thou,\r\n      I see, wast horn, like him, upon the hills:\r\n      If thou shouldst \'scape thy present thraldom, he\r\n      May chance to cross thee; if he should, I pray thee\r\n      Relate to him what has been passing here,\r\n      And say I laid my hand upon thy head,\r\n      And said to thee, if he were here, as thou art,\r\n      Thus would I bless him. Mayst thou live, my boy,\r\n      To see thy country free, or die for her,\r\n      As I do! (Albert weeps.)\r\n\r\nSar. Mark! he weeps.\r\n\r\nTell. Were he my son,\r\n      He would not shed a tear! He would remember\r\n      The cliff where he was bred, and learned to scan\r\n      A thousand fathoms\' depth of nether air;\r\n      Where he was trained to hear the thunder talk,\r\n      And meet the lightning, eye to eye; where last\r\n      We spoke together, when I told him death\r\n      Bestowed the brightest gem that graces life,\r\n      Embraced for virtue\'s sake. He shed a tear!\r\n      Now were he by, I\'d talk to him, and his cheek\r\n      Should never blanch, nor moisture dim his eye--\r\n      I\'d talk to him--\r\n\r\nSar.  He falters!\r\n\r\nTell. \'T is too much!\r\n      And yet it must be done! I\'d talk to him--\r\n\r\nGes. Of what?\r\n\r\nTell. The mother, tyrant, thou dost make\r\n      A widow of! I\'d talk to him of her.\r\n      I\'d bid him tell her, next to liberty,\r\n      Her name was the last word my lips pronounced.\r\n      And I would charge him never to forget\r\n      To love and cherish her, as he would have\r\n      His father\'s dying blessing rest upon him!\r\n\r\nSar. You see, as he doth prompt, the other acts.\r\n\r\nTell. So well he bears it, he doth vanquish me.\r\n      My boy! my boy! Oh, for the hills, the hills,\r\n      To see him bound along their tops again,\r\n      With liberty.\r\n\r\nSar. Was there not an the father in that look?\r\n\r\nGes. Yet \'t is \'gainst nature.\r\n\r\nSar. Not if he believes\r\n     To own the son would be to make him share\r\n     The father\'s death.\r\n\r\nGes. I did not think of that! \'T is well\r\n     The boy is not thy son. I\'ve destined him\r\n     To die along with thee.\r\n\r\nTell. To die? For what?\r\n\r\nGes. For having braved my power, as thou hast. Lead\r\n     them forth.\r\nTell. He\'s but a child.\r\n\r\nGes. Away with them!\r\n\r\nTell. Perhaps an only child.\r\n\r\nGes. No matter.\r\n\r\nTell. He may have a mother.\r\n\r\nGes. So the viper hath;\r\n     And yet, who spares it for the mother\'s sake?\r\n\r\nTell. I talk to stone! I talk to it as though\r\n      \'T were flesh; and know \'t is none. I\'ll talk to it\r\n      No more. Come, my boy;\r\n      I taught thee how to live, I\'ll show thee how to die.\r\n\r\nGes. He is thy child?\r\n\r\nTell. He is my child. (Weeps.)\r\n\r\nGes. I\'ve wrung a tear from him! Thy name?\r\n\r\nTell. My name?\r\n      It matters not to keep it from thee now;\r\n      My name is Tell.\r\n\r\nGes. Tell? William Tell?\r\n\r\nTell. The same.\r\n\r\nGes. What! he, so famed \'bove all his countrymen,\r\n     For guiding o\'er the stormy lake the boat?\r\n     And such a master of his bow, \'t is said\r\n     His arrows never miss! Indeed! I\'ll take\r\n     Exquisite vengeance! Mark! I\'ll spare thy life;\r\n     Thy boy\'s too; both of you are free; on one\r\n     Condition.\r\n\r\nTell. Name it.\r\n\r\nGes. I would see you make\r\n     A trial of your skill with that same bow\r\n     You shoot so well with.\r\n\r\nTell. Name the trial you\r\n      Would have me make.\r\n\r\nGes. You look upon your boy\r\n     As though instinctively you guessed it.\r\n\r\nTell. Look upon my boy? What mean you? Look upon\r\n      My boy as though I guessed it? Guessed the trial\r\n      You\'d have me make? Guessed it\r\n      Instinctively? You do not mean--no--no,\r\n      You would not have me make a trial of\r\n      My skill upon my child! Impossible!\r\n      I do not guess your meaning.\r\n\r\nGes. I would see\r\n     Thee hit an apple at the distance of\r\n     A hundred paces.\r\n\r\nTell. Is my boy to hold it?\r\n\r\nGes. No.\r\n\r\nTell. No? I\'ll send the arrow through the core!\r\n\r\nGes. It is to rest upon his head.\r\n\r\nTell. Great heaven, you hear him!\r\n\r\nGes. Thou dost hear the choice I give:\r\n     Such trial of the skill thou art master of,\r\n     Or death to both of you, not otherwise\r\n     To be escaped.\r\n\r\nTell. O, monster!\r\n\r\nGes. Wilt thou do it?\r\n\r\nAlb. He will! he will!\r\n\r\nTell. Ferocious monster! Make\r\n      A father murder his own child!\r\n\r\nGes. Take off his chains if he consent.\r\n\r\nTell. With his own hand!\r\n\r\nGes. Does he consent?\r\n\r\nAlb. He does. (Gesler signs to his officers, who proceed to take\r\n     off Tell\'s chains; Tell unconscious what they do.)\r\n\r\nTell. With his own hand!\r\n      Murder his child with his own hand? This hand?\r\n      The hand I\'ve led him, when an infant, by?\r\n      \'T is beyond horror! \'T is most horrible!\r\n      Amazement! (His chains fall off.) What\'s that you\'ve\r\n           done to me?\r\n      Villains! put on my chains again. My hands\r\n      Are free from blood, and have no gust for it,\r\n      That they should drink my child\'s! Here! here! I\'ll\r\n      Not murder my boy for Gesler.\r\n\r\nAlb. Father! Father!\r\n     You will not hit me, father!\r\n\r\nTell. Hit thee? Send\r\n      The arrow through thy brain? Or, missing that,\r\n      Shoot out an eye? Or, if thine eye escape,\r\n      Mangle the cheek I\'ve seen thy mother\'s lips\r\n      Cover with kisses? Hit thee? Hit a hair\r\n      Of thee, and cleave thy mother\'s heart?\r\n\r\nGes. Dost thou consent?\r\n\r\nTell. Give me my bow and quiver.\r\n\r\nGes. For what?\r\n\r\nTell. To shoot my boy!\r\n\r\nAlb. No, father, no!\r\n     To save me! You\'ll be sure to hit the apple.\r\n     Will you not save me, father?\r\n\r\nTell. Lead me forth;\r\n      I\'ll make the trial!\r\n\r\nAlb. Thank you!\r\n\r\nTell. Thank me? Do\r\n      You know for what? I will not make the trial.\r\n      To take him to his mother in my arms!\r\n      And lay him down a corse before her!\r\n\r\nGes. Then he dies this moment, and you certainly\r\n     Do murder him whose life you have a chance\r\n     To save, and will not use it.\r\n\r\nTell. Well, I\'ll do it; I\'ll make the trial.\r\n\r\nAlb. Father!\r\n\r\nTell. Speak not to me:\r\n      Let me not hear thy voice: thou must be dumb,\r\n      And so should all things be. Earth should be dumb;\r\n      And heaven--unless its thunders muttered at\r\n      The deed, and sent a bolt to stop! Give me\r\n      My bow and quiver!\r\n\r\nGes. When all\'s ready.\r\n\r\nTell. Ready!--\r\n      I must be calm with such a mark to hit!\r\n      Don\'t touch me, child!--Don\'t speak to me!--Lead on!\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--Come\'li-ness, that which is becoming or graceful.

Gesler, also a purely mythical personage,\r\nis one of the Austrian bailiffs. The legend relates that Gesler had his\r\ncap placed on a pole in the market place, and all the Swiss were required\r\nto salute it in passing in recognition of his authority. Tell refusing to\r\ndo this was arrested, and condemned to death. This and the following\r\nlesson narrate how the sentence was changed, and the result.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXVIII. WILLIAM TELL. (Concluded.)\r\n\r\nSCENE 2.--Enter slowly, people in evident distress--Officers, Sarnem,\r\nGesler, Tell, Albert, and soldiers--one bearing Tell\'s bow and\r\nquiver--another with a basket of apples.\r\n\r\nGes. That is your ground. Now shall they measure thence\r\n     A hundred paces. Take the distance.\r\n\r\nTell. Is the line a true one?\r\n\r\nGes. True or not, what is \'t to thee?\r\n\r\nTell. What is \'t to me? A little thing.\r\n      A very little thing; a yard or two\r\n      Is nothing here or there--were it a wolf\r\n      I shot at! Never mind.\r\n\r\nGes. Be thankful, slave,\r\n     Our grace accords thee life on any terms.\r\n\r\nTell. I will be thankful, Gesler! Villain, stop!\r\n      You measure to the sun.\r\n\r\nGes. And what of that?\r\n     What matter whether to or from the sun?\r\n\r\nTell. I\'d have it at my back. The sun should shine\r\n      Upon the mark, and not on him that shoots.\r\n      I can not see to shoot against the sun:\r\n      I will not shoot against the sun!\r\n\r\nGes. Give him his way! Thou hast cause to bless my mercy.\r\n\r\nTell. I shall remember it. I\'d like to see\r\n      The apple I\'m to shoot at.\r\n\r\nGes. Stay! show me the basket! there!\r\n\r\nTell. You\'ve picked the smallest one.\r\n\r\nGes. I know I have.\r\n\r\nTell. Oh, do you? But you see\r\n      The color of it is dark: I\'d have it light,\r\n      To see it better.\r\n\r\nGes. Take it as it is;\r\n     Thy skill will be the greater if thou hitt\'st it.\r\n     Tell. True! true! I did not think of that; I wonder\r\n     I did not think of that. Give me some chance\r\n     To save my boy!--\r\n     I will not murder him,\r\n     If I can help it--for the honor of\r\n     The form thou wearest, if all the heart is gone.\r\n           (Throws away the apple with all his force.)\r\n\r\nGes. Well: choose thyself.\r\n\r\nTell. Have I a friend among the lookers-on?\r\n\r\nVerner. (Rushing forward.) Here, Tell.\r\n\r\nTell. I thank thee, Verner!\r\n      He is a friend runs out into a storm\r\n      To shake a hand with us. I must be brief.\r\n      When once the bow is bent, we can not take\r\n      The shot too soon. Verner, whatever be\r\n      The issue of this hour, the common cause\r\n      Must not stand still. Let not to-morrow\'s sun\r\n      Set on the tyrant\'s banner! Verner! Verner!\r\n      The boy! the boy! Thinkest thou he hath the courage\r\n      To stand it?\r\n\r\nVer. Yes.\r\n\r\nTell. Does he tremble?\r\n\r\nVer. No.\r\n\r\nTell. Art sure?\r\n\r\nVer. I am.\r\n\r\nTell. How looks he?\r\n\r\nVer. Clear and smilingly.\r\n     If you doubt it, look yourself.\r\n\r\nTell. No, no, my friend:\r\n      To hear it is enough.\r\n\r\nVer. He bears himself so much above his years--\r\n\r\nTell. I know! I know!\r\n\r\nVer. With constancy so modest--\r\n\r\nTell. I was sure he would--\r\n\r\nVer. And looks with such relying love\r\n     And reverence upon you--\r\n\r\nTell. Man! Man! Man!\r\n      No more! Already I\'m too much the father\r\n      To act the man! Verner, no more, my friend!\r\n      I would be flint--flint--flint. Don\'t make me feel\r\n      I\'m not--do not mind me! Take the boy\r\n      And set him, Verner, with his back to me.\r\n      Set him upon his knees, and place this apple\r\n      Upon his head, so that the stem may front me.\r\n      Thus, Verner; charge him to keep steady; tell him\r\n      I\'ll hit the apple! Verner, do all this\r\n      More briefly than I tell it thee.\r\n\r\nVer. Come, Albert! (Leading him out.)\r\n\r\nAlb. May I not speak with him before I go?\r\n\r\nVer. No.\r\n\r\nAlb. I would only kiss his hand.\r\n\r\nVer. You must not.\r\n\r\nAlb. I must; I can not go from him without.\r\n\r\nVer. It is his will you should.\r\n\r\nAlb. His will, is it?\r\n     I am content, then; come.\r\n\r\nTell. My boy! (Holding out his arms to him.)\r\n\r\nAlb. My father! (Rushing into Tell\'s arms.)\r\n\r\nTell. If thou canst bear it, should not I? Go now,\r\n      My son; and keep in mind that I can shoot;\r\n      Go, boy; be thou but steady, I will hit\r\n      The apple. Go! God bless thee; go. My bow!\r\n      (The bow is handed to him.)\r\n      Thou wilt not fail thy master, wilt thou? Thou\r\n      Hast never failed him yet, old servant. No,\r\n      I\'m sure of thee. I know thy honesty,\r\n      Thou art stanch, stanch. Let me see my quiver.\r\n\r\nGes. Give him a single arrow.\r\n\r\nTell. Do you shoot?\r\n\r\nSoldier. I do.\r\n\r\nTell. Is it so you pick an arrow, friend?\r\n      The point, you see, is bent; the feather, jagged.\r\n      That\'s all the use \'t is fit for. (Breaks it.)\r\n\r\nGes. Let him have another.\r\n\r\nTell. Why, \'t is better than the first,\r\n      But yet not good enough for such an aim\r\n      As I\'m to take. \'T is heavy in the shaft;\r\n      I\'ll not shoot with it! (Throws it away.) Let\r\n      me see my quiver.\r\n      Bring it! \'T is not one arrow in a dozen\r\n      I\'d take to shoot with at a dove, much less\r\n      A dove like that.\r\n\r\nGes. It matters not.\r\n     Show him the quiver.\r\n\r\nTell. See if the boy is ready.\r\n      (Tell here hides an arrow under his vest.)\r\n\r\nVer. He is.\r\n\r\nTell. I \'m ready too! Keep silent, for\r\n      Heaven\'s sake, and do not stir; and let me have\r\n      Your prayers, your prayers, and be my witnesses\r\n      That if his life\'s in peril from my hand,\r\n      \'Tis only for the chance of saving it. (To the people.)\r\n\r\nGes. Go on.\r\n\r\nTell. I will.\r\n      O friends, for mercy\'s sake keep motionless\r\n      and silent. (Tell shoots. A shout of exultation\r\n      bursts from the crowd. Tell\'s head drops on his\r\n      bosom; he with difficulty supports himself on his bow.)\r\n\r\nVer. (Rushing in with Albert.) The boy is safe, no\r\n     hair of him is touched.\r\n\r\nAlb. Father, I\'m safe. Your Albert\'s safe, dear father.\r\n     Speak to me! Speak to me!\r\n\r\nVer. He can not, boy!\r\n\r\nAlb. You grant him life?\r\n\r\nGes. I do.\r\n\r\nAlb. And we are free?\r\n\r\nGes. You are. (Crossing angrily behind.)\r\n\r\nAlb. Open his vest,\r\n     And give him air. (Albert opens his father\'s vest,\r\n     and the arrow drops. Tell starts, fixes his eyes\r\n     on Albert and clasps him to his breast.)\r\n\r\nTell. My boy! My boy!\r\n\r\nGes. For what\r\n     Hid you that arrow in your breast? Speak, slave!\r\n\r\nTell. To kill thee, tyrant, had I slain my boy!\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--Ac-cords\', grants, concede. Is\'sue (pro. ish\'u), event,\r\nconsequence. Stanch, sound, strong.  Jag\'ged, notched, uneven. Shaft, the\r\nstem of an arrow upon which the feather and head are inserted. Quiv\'er, a\r\ncase for arrows.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.--The legend further relates that on the discovery of the concealed\r\narrow Tell was again put in chains. Gesler then embarked for another\r\nplace, taking Tell with him. A storm overtook them, and Tell was released\r\nto steer the boat. In passing a certain point of land now known as "Tell\'s\r\nRock" or "Leap," Tell leaped ashore and escaped: then going to a point\r\nwhere he knew the boat must land, he lay concealed until it arrived, when\r\nhe shot Gesler through the heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXIX. THE CRAZY ENGINEER.\r\n\r\n1. My train left Dantzic in the morning generally about eight o\'clock; but\r\nonce a week we had to wait for the arrival of the steamer from Stockholm.\r\nIt was the morning of the steamer\'s arrival that I came down from the\r\nhotel, and found that my engineer had been so seriously injured that he\r\ncould not perform his work. I went immediately to the engine house to\r\nprocure another engineer, for I supposed there were three or four in\r\nreserve there, but I was disappointed.\r\n\r\n2. I heard the puffing of the steamer, and the passengers would be on hand\r\nin fifteen minutes. I ran to the guards and asked them if they knew where\r\nthere was an engineer, but they did not. I then went to the firemen and\r\nasked them if anyone of them felt competent to run the engine to Bromberg.\r\nNo one dared to attempt it. The distance was nearly one hundred miles.\r\nWhat was to be done?\r\n\r\n3. The steamer stopped at the wharf, and those who were going on by rail\r\ncame flocking to the station. They had eaten breakfast on board the boat,\r\nand were all ready for a fresh start. The train was in readiness in the\r\nlong station house, and the engine was steaming and puffing away\r\nimpatiently in the distant firing house.\r\n\r\n4. It was past nine o\'clock. "Come, why don\'t we start?" growled an old,\r\nfat Swede, who had been watching me narrowly for the last fifteen minutes.\r\nAnd upon this there was a general chorus of anxious inquiry, which soon\r\nsettled to downright murmuring. At this juncture some one touched me on\r\nthe elbow. I turned, and saw a stranger by my side. I thought that he was\r\ngoing to remonstrate with me for my backwardness. In fact, I began to have\r\nstrong temptations to pull off my uniform, for every anxious eye was fixed\r\nupon the glaring badges which marked me as the chief officer of the train.\r\n\r\n5. However, this stranger was a middle-aged man, tall and stout, with a\r\nface of great energy and intelligence. His eye was black and\r\nbrilliant,--so brilliant that I could not gaze steadily into it, though I\r\ntried; and his lips, which were very thin, seemed more like polished\r\nmarble than human flesh. His dress was black throughout, and not only set\r\nwith exact nicety, but was scrupulously clean and neat.\r\n\r\n6. "You want an engineer, I understand," he said in a low, cautious tone,\r\nat the same time gazing quietly about him, as though he wanted no one to\r\nhear what he said. "I do," I replied. "My train is all ready, and we have\r\nno engineer within twenty miles of this place." "Well, sir, I am going to\r\nBromberg; I must go, and I will run the engine for you." "Ha!" I uttered,\r\n"are you an engineer?" "I am, sir--one of the oldest in the country--and\r\nam now on my way to make arrangements for a great improvement I have\r\ninvented for the application of steam to a locomotive. My name is Martin\r\nKroller. If you wish, I will run as far as Bromberg; and I will show you\r\nrunning that is running."\r\n\r\n7. Was I not fortunate? I determined to accept the man\'s offer at once,\r\nand so I told him. He received my answer with a nod and a smile. I went\r\nwith him to the house, where we found the engine in charge of the fireman,\r\nand all ready for a start. Kroller got upon the platform, and I followed\r\nhim. I had never seen a man betray such a peculiar aptness amid machinery\r\nas he did. He let on the steam in an instant, but yet with care and\r\njudgment, and he backed up to the baggage carriage with the most exact\r\nnicety.\r\n\r\n8. I had seen enough to assure me that he was thoroughly acquainted with\r\nthe business, and I felt composed once more. I gave my engine up to the\r\nnew man, and then hastened away to the office. Word was passed for all the\r\npassengers to take their seats, and soon afterward I waved my hand to the\r\nengineer. There was a puff, a groaning of the heavy axletrees, a trembling\r\nof the building, and the train was in motion. I leaped upon the platform\r\nof the guard carriage, and in a few minutes more the station house was far\r\nbehind us.\r\n\r\n9. In less than an hour we reached Dirschau, where we took up the\r\npassengers, that had come on the Konigsberg railway. Here I went forward\r\nand asked Kroller how he liked the engine. He replied that he liked it\r\nvery much. "But," he added, with a strange sparkling of the eye, "wait\r\nuntil I get my improvement, and then you will see traveling. Why, I could\r\nrun an engine of my construction to the moon in four and twenty hours?"\r\n\r\n10. I smiled at what I thought his enthusiasm, and then went back to my\r\nstation. As soon as the Konigsberg passengers were all on board, and their\r\nbaggage carriage attached, we started on again. Soon after, I went into\r\nthe guard carriage and sat down. An early train from Konigsberg had been\r\nthrough two hours before, and was awaiting us at Little Oscue, where we\r\ntook on board the Western mail.\r\n\r\n11. "How we go," uttered one of the guards, some fifteen minutes after we\r\nhad left Dirschau. "The new engineer is trying the speed," I replied, not\r\nyet having any fear. But ere long I began to apprehend he was running a\r\nlittle too fast. The carriages began to sway to and fro, and I could hear\r\nexclamations of fright from the passengers. "Good heavens!" cried one of\r\nthe guards, coming in at that moment, "what is that fellow doing? Look,\r\nsir, and see how we are going."\r\n\r\n12. I looked at the window, and found that we were dashing along at a\r\nspeed never before traveled on that road. Posts, fences, rocks, and trees\r\nflew by in one undistinguished mass, and the carriages now swayed\r\nfearfully. I started to my feet, and met a passenger on the platform. He\r\nwas one of the chief owners of our road, and was just on his way to\r\nBerlin. He was pale and excited.\r\n\r\n13. "Sir," he gasped, "is Martin Kroller on the engine?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," I told him.\r\n\r\n"What! didn\'t you know him?"\r\n\r\n"Know?" I repeated, somewhat puzzled; "what do you mean? He told me his\r\nname was Kroller, and that he was an engineer. We had no one to run the\r\nengine, and--"\r\n\r\n"You took him!" interrupted the man. "Good heavens, sir, he is as crazy as\r\na man can be! He turned his brain over a new plan for applying steam\r\npower. I saw him at the station, but did not fully recognize him, as I was\r\nin a hurry. Just now one of your passengers told me that your engineers\r\nwere all gone this morning, and that you found one that was a stranger to\r\nyou. Then I knew the man whom I had seen was Martin Kroller. He had\r\nescaped from the hospital at Stettin. You must get him off somehow."\r\n\r\n14. The whole fearful truth was now open to me. The speed of the train was\r\nincreasing every moment, and I knew that a few more miles per hour would\r\nlaunch us all into destruction. I called to the guard and then made my way\r\nforward as quickly as possible. I reached the back platform of the tender,\r\nand there stood Kroller upon the engine board, his hat and coat off, his\r\nlong black hair floating wildly in the wind, his shirt unbuttoned at the\r\nfront, his sleeves rolled up, with a pistol in his teeth, and thus glaring\r\nupon the fireman, who lay motionless upon the fuel. The furnace was\r\nstuffed till the very latch of the door was red-hot, and the whole engine\r\nwas quivering and swaying as though it would shiver to pieces.\r\n\r\n15. "Kroller! Kroller\'!" I cried, at the top of my voice. The crazy\r\nengineer started, and caught the pistol in his hand. Oh, how those great\r\nblack eyes glared, and how ghastly and frightful the face looked!\r\n\r\n"Ha! ha! ha!" he yelled demoniacally, glaring upon me like a roused lion.\r\n\r\n"They said that I could not make it! But see! see! See my new power! See\r\nmy new engine! I made it, and they are jealous of me! I made it, and when\r\nit was done, they stole it from me. But I have found it! For years I have\r\nbeen wandering in search of my great engine, and they said it was not\r\nmade. But I have found it! I knew it this morning when I saw it at\r\nDantzic, and I was determined to have it. And I\'ve got it! Ho! ho! ho!\r\nwe\'re on the way to the moon, I say! We\'ll be in the moon in four and\r\ntwenty hours. Down, down, villain! If you move, I\'ll shoot you."\r\n\r\nThis was spoken to the poor fireman, who at that moment attempted to rise,\r\nand the frightened man sank back again.\r\n\r\n16. "Here\'s Little Oscue just before us," cried out one of the guard. But\r\neven as he spoke, the buildings were at hand. A sickening sensation\r\nsettled upon my heart, for I supposed that we were now gone. The houses\r\nflew by like lightning. I knew if the officers here had turned the switch\r\nas usual, we should be hurled into eternity in one fearful crash. I saw a\r\nflash,--it was another engine,--I closed my eyes; but still we thundered\r\non! The officers had seen our speed, and knowing that we would not be able\r\nto stop, in that distance, they had changed the switch, so that we went\r\nforward.\r\n\r\n17. But there was sure death ahead, if we did not stop. Only fifteen miles\r\nfrom us was the town of Schwetz, on the Vistula; and at the rate we were\r\ngoing we should be there in a few minutes, for each minute carried us over\r\na mile. The shrieks of the passengers now rose above the crash of the\r\nrails, and more terrific than all else arose the demoniac yells of the mad\r\nengineer.\r\n\r\n"Merciful heavens!" gasped the guardsman, "there\'s not a moment to lose;\r\nSchwetz is close. But hold," he added; "let\'s shoot him."\r\n\r\n18. At that moment a tall, stout German student came over the platform\r\nwhere we stood, and saw that the mad-man had his heavy pistol aimed at us.\r\nHe grasped a huge stick of wood, and, with a steadiness of nerve which I\r\ncould not have commanded, he hurled it with such force and precision that\r\nhe knocked the pistol from the maniac\'s hand. I saw the movement, and on\r\nthe instant that the pistol fell, I sprang forward, and the German\r\nfollowed me. I grasped the man by the arm; but I should have been nothing\r\nin his mad power, had I been alone. He would have hurled me from the\r\nplatform, had not the student at that moment struck him upon the head with\r\na stick of wood, which he caught as he came over the tender.\r\n\r\n19. Kroller settled down like a dead man, and on the next instant I shut\r\noff the steam and opened the valve. As the free steam shrieked and howled\r\nin its escape, the speed began to decrease, and in a few minutes more the\r\ndanger was passed. As I settled back, entirely overcome by the wild\r\nemotions that had raged within me, we began to turn the river; and before\r\nI was fairly recovered, the fireman had stopped the train in the station\r\nhouse at Schwetz.\r\n\r\n20. Martin Kroller, still insensible, was taken from the platform; and, as\r\nwe carried him to the guard room, one of the guard recognized him, and\r\ntold us that he had been there about two weeks before.\r\n\r\n"He came," said the guard, "and swore that an engine which stood near by\r\nwas his. He said it was one he had made to go to the moon in, and that it\r\nhad been stolen from him. We sent for more help to arrest him, and he\r\nfled."\r\n\r\n"Well," I replied, with a shudder, "I wish he had approached me in the\r\nsame way; but he was more cautious at Dantzic."\r\n\r\nAt Schwartz we found an engineer to run the engine to Bromberg; and having\r\ntaken out the western mail for the next northern mail to carry along, we\r\nsaw that Kroller would be properly attended to, and then started on.\r\n\r\n21. The rest of the trip we ran in safety, though I could see the\r\npassengers were not wholly at ease, and would not be until they were\r\nentirely clear of the railway. Martin Kroller remained insensible from the\r\neffects of the blow nearly two weeks; and when he recovered from that, he\r\nwas sound again; his insanity was all gone. I saw him about three weeks\r\nafterward, but he had no recollection of me. He remembered nothing of the\r\npast year, not even his mad freak on my engine. But I remembered it, and I\r\nremember it still; and the people need never fear that I shall be imposed\r\nupon again by a crazy engineer.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--2. Com\'pe-tent, fit, qualified. 4.

River, in Prussia, from Dantzic to Bromberg.\r\nThe cities mentioned are all in Prussia, excepting Stockholm, which is the\r\ncapital of Sweden.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXX. THE HERITAGE.\r\n\r\nJames Russell Lowell (b. 1819, d.1891) was born in Cambridge, Mass., and\r\nwas graduated from Harvard College. He entered the profession of law; but,\r\nin 1843, turned aside to publish "The Pioneer, a Literary and Critical\r\nMagazine." In 1855 he was appointed professor of Belles-lettres in Harvard\r\nCollege. From 1877 to 1885 he was U.S. Minister, first to Spain,\r\nafterwards to Great Britain. Lowell\'s powers as a writer were very\r\nversatile, and his poems range from the most dreamy and imaginative to the\r\nmost trenchant and witty. Among his most noted poetical works are "The\r\nBiglow Papers," "A Fable for Critics," "The Vision of Sir Launfal," "The\r\nCathedral," and "The Legend of Brittany;" while "Conversations on some of\r\nthe Old Poets," "Among my Books," and "My Study Windows," place him in the\r\nfront rank as an essayist.\r\n\r\n1. The rich man\'s son inherits lands,\r\n     And piles of brick, and stone, and gold,\r\n   And he inherits soft white hands,\r\n     And tender flesh that fears the cold,\r\n     Nor dares to wear a garment old;\r\n   A heritage, it seems to me,\r\n   One scarce would wish to hold in fee.\r\n\r\n2. The rich man\'s son inherits cares;\r\n     The bank may break, the factory burn,\r\n   A breath may burst his bubble shares,\r\n     And soft white hands could hardly earn\r\n     A living that would serve his turn;\r\n   A heritage, it seems to me,\r\n   One scarce would wish to hold in fee.\r\n\r\n3. The rich man\'s son inherits wants,\r\n     His stomach craves for dainty fare;\r\n   With sated heart, he hears the pants\r\n     Of toiling hinds with brown arms bare!\r\n     And wearies in his easy-chair;\r\n   A heritage, it seems to me,\r\n   One scarce would wish to hold in fee.\r\n\r\n4. What doth the poor man\'s son inherit?\r\n     Stout muscles and a sinewy heart,\r\n   A hardy frame, a hardier spirit;\r\n     King of two hands, he does his part\r\n     In every useful toil and art;\r\n   A heritage, it seems to me,\r\n   A king might wish to hold in fee.\r\n\r\n5. What doth the poor man\'s son inherit?\r\n     Wishes o\'erjoyed with humble things,\r\n   A rank adjudged by toil-won merit,\r\n     Content that from employment springs,\r\n     A heart that in his labor sings;\r\n   A heritage, it seems to me,\r\n   A king might wish to hold in fee.\r\n\r\n6. What doth the poor man\'s son inherit?\r\n     A patience learned of being poor,\r\n   Courage, if sorrow come, to bear it,\r\n     A fellow-feeling that is sure\r\n     To make the outcast bless his door;\r\n   A heritage, it seems to me,\r\n   A king might wish to hold in fee.\r\n\r\n7. O rich man\'s son! there is a toil\r\n     That with all others level stands:\r\n   Large charity doth never soil,\r\n     But only whiten soft, white hands,--\r\n     This is the best crop from thy lands;\r\n   A heritage, it seems to me,\r\n   Worth being rich to hold in fee.\r\n\r\n8. O poor man\'s son! scorn not thy state;\r\n     There is worse weariness than thine\r\n   In merely being rich and great:\r\n     Toil only gives the soul to shine,\r\n     And makes rest fragrant and benign;\r\n   A heritage, it seems to me,\r\n   Worth being poor to hold in fee.\r\n\r\n9. Both, heirs to some six feet of sod,\r\n     Are equal in the earth at last;\r\n   Both, children of the same dear God,\r\n     Prove title to your heirship vast\r\n     By record of a well-filled past;\r\n   A heritage, it seems to me,\r\n   Well worth a life to hold in fee.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Her\'it-age, that which is inherited, or taken by descent,\r\nfrom an ancestor. 3. Sat\'ed, surfeited, glutted. Hinds, peasants,\r\ncountrymen. 5. Ad-judged\', decided, determined. 8. Be-nign\' (pro.\r\nbe-nin\'), having healthful qualities, wholesome.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--1. To hold in fee, means to have as an inheritance. 9. Prove\r\ntitle. That is, to prove the right of ownership.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXI. NO EXCELLENCE WITHOUT LABOR.\r\n\r\nWilliam Wirt (b. 1772, d. 1834) was born in Bladensburg, Md. He was\r\nadmitted to the bar in 1799, and afterwards practiced law, with eminent\r\nsuccess, at Richmond and Norfolk, Va. He was one of the counsel for the\r\nprosecution in the trial of Aaron Burr for treason. From 1817 to 1829 he\r\nwas attorney-general for the United States. In 1803 he published the\r\n"Letters of a British Spy," a work which attracted much attention, and in\r\n1817 a "Life of Patrick Henry."\r\n\r\n1. The education, moral and intellectual, of every individual, must be\r\nchiefly his own work. Rely upon it that the ancients were right; both in\r\nmorals and intellect we give the final shape to our characters, and thus\r\nbecome, emphatically, the architects of our own fortune. How else could it\r\nhappen that young men, who have had precisely the same opportunities,\r\nshould be continually presenting us with such different results, and\r\nrushing to such opposite destinies?\r\n\r\n2. Difference of talent will not solve it, because that difference is very\r\noften in favor of the disappointed candidate. You will see issuing from\r\nthe walls of the same college, nay, sometimes from the bosom of the same\r\nfamily, two young men, of whom one will be admitted to be a genius of high\r\norder, the other scarcely above the point of mediocrity; yet you will see\r\nthe genius sinking and perishing in poverty, obscurity, and wretchedness;\r\nwhile, on the other hand, you will observe the mediocre plodding his slow\r\nbut sure way up the hill of life, gaining steadfast footing at every step,\r\nand mounting, at length, to eminence and distinction, an ornament to his\r\nfamily, a blessing to his country.\r\n\r\n3. Now, whose work is this? Manifestly their own. They are the\r\narchitects of their respective fortunes. The best seminary of\r\nlearning that can open its portals to you can do no more than to\r\nafford you the opportunity of instruction; but it must depend, at\r\nlast, on yourselves, whether you will be instructed or not, or to\r\nwhat point you will push your instruction.\r\n\r\n4. And of this be assured, I speak from observation a certain truth: THERE\r\nIS NO EXCELLENCE WITHOUT GREAT LABOR. It is the fiat of fate, from which\r\nno power of genius can absolve you.\r\n\r\n5. Genius, unexerted, is like the poor moth that flutters around a candle\r\ntill it scorches itself to death. If genius be desirable at all, it is\r\nonly of that great and magnanimous kind, which, like the condor of South\r\nAmerica, pitches from the summit of Chimborazo, above the clouds, and\r\nsustains itself at pleasure in that empyreal region with an energy rather\r\ninvigorated than weakened by the effort.\r\n\r\n6. It is this capacity for high and long-continued exertion, this vigorous\r\npower of profound and searching investigation, this careering and\r\nwide-spreading comprehension of mind, and these long reaches of thought,\r\nthat\r\n\r\n   "Pluck bright honor from the pale-faced moon,\r\n   Or dive into the bottom of the deep,\r\n   And pluck up drowned honor by the locks;"\r\n\r\nthis is the prowess, and these the hardy achievements, which are to enroll\r\nyour names among the great men of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Mor\'al, relating to duty or obligation. Ar\'-chi-tects,\r\nbuilders, makers. Des\'ti-ny, ultimate fate, appointed condition. 2.\r\nCan\'di-date, one who seeks after some honor or office.

Oh! the old, old clock of the household stock,\r\n     Was the brightest thing, and neatest;\r\n   Its hands, though old, had a touch of gold,\r\n     And its chimes rang still the sweetest;\r\n   \'T was a monitor, too, though its words were few,\r\n     Yet they lived, though nations altered;\r\n   And its voice, still strong, warned old and young,\r\n     When the voice of friendship faltered:\r\n   "Tick! tick!" it said, "quick, quick, to bed:\r\n     For ten I\'ve given warning;\r\n   Up! up! and go, or else you know,\r\n     You\'ll never rise soon in the morning!"\r\n\r\n2. A friendly voice was that old, old clock,\r\n     As it stood in the corner smiling,\r\n   And blessed the time with merry chime,\r\n     The wintry hours beguiling;\r\n   But a cross old voice was that tiresome clock,\r\n     As it called at daybreak boldly;\r\n   When the dawn looked gray o\'er the misty way,\r\n     And the early air looked coldly:\r\n   "Tick! tick!" it said, "quick out of bed:\r\n     For five I\'ve given warning;\r\n   You\'ll never have health, you\'ll never have wealth,\r\n     Unless you\'re up soon in the morning!"\r\n\r\n3. Still hourly the sound goes round and round,\r\n     With a tone that ceases never:\r\n   While tears are shed for bright days fled,\r\n     And the old friends lost forever!\r\n   Its heart beats on, though hearts are gone\r\n     That beat like ours, though stronger;\r\n   Its hands still move, though hands we love\r\n     Are clasped on earth no longer!\r\n   "Tick! tick!" it said, "to the churchyard bed,\r\n     The grave hath given warning;\r\n   Up! up! and rise, and look at the skies,\r\n     And prepare for a heavenly morning!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXIII. THE EXAMINATION\r\n\r\nDaniel Pierce Thompson (b. 1193, d. 1868) was born at Charlestown, Mass.,\r\nbut soon removed with his father to Vermont, where he lived until twenty\r\nyears of age, on a farm. His means of schooling were most limited, but he\r\nwas very ambitious and seized every opportunity. By his own efforts he\r\nearned enough money to carry him through Middlebury College, where he\r\ngraduated in 1820. He then went to Virginia as private tutor, and while\r\nthere was entered at the bar. He shortly returned to Vermont, and opened a\r\nlaw office in Montpelier. In time he was elected a judge, and later\r\nsecretary of state. From his college days Mr. Thompson was a writer for\r\nthe various magazines. Among his novels may be mentioned "Locke Amsden,\r\nthe Schoolmaster," "May Martin, or the Money Diggers," "The Green Mountain\r\nBoys," and "The Rangers, or the Tory\'s Daughter."\r\n\r\n1. "Have you any questions to ask me in the other branches, sir?" asked\r\nLocke.\r\n\r\n"Not many," replied Bunker. "There is reading, writing, grammar, etc.,\r\nwhich I know nothing about; and as to them, I must, of course, take you by\r\nguess, which will not be much of a guess, after all, if I find you have\r\nthought well on all other matters. Do you understand philosophy?"\r\n\r\n2. "To what branch of philosophy do you allude, sir?"\r\n\r\n"To the only branch there is."\r\n\r\n"But you are aware that philosophy is divided into different kinds; as,\r\nnatural, moral, and intellectual."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense! philosophy is philosophy, and means the study of the reasons\r\nand causes of the things which we see, whether it be applied to a crazy\r\nman\'s dreams, or the roasting of potatoes. Have you attended to it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, to a considerable extent, sir."\r\n\r\n3. "I will put a question or two, then, if you please. What is the reason\r\nof the fact, for it is a fact, that the damp breath of a person blown on a\r\ngood knife and on a bad one, will soonest disappear from the well-tempered\r\nblade?"\r\n\r\n"It may be owing to the difference in the polish of the two blades,\r\nperhaps." replied Locke.\r\n\r\n4. "Ah! that is an answer that don\'t go deeper than the surface," rejoined\r\nBunker, humorously. "As good a thinker as you evidently are, you have not\r\nthought on this subject, I suspect. It took me a week, in all, I presume,\r\nof hard thinking, and making experiments at a blacksmith\'s shop, to\r\ndiscover the reason of this. It is not the polish; for take two blades of\r\nequal polish, and the breath will disappear from one as much quicker than\r\nit does from the other, as the blade is better. It is because the material\r\nof the blade is more compact or less porous in one case than in the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. "In the first place, I ascertained that the steel was, made more\r\ncompact by being hammered and tempered, and that the better it was\r\ntempered the more compact it would become; the size of the pores being\r\nmade, of course, less in the same proportion. Well, then, I saw the reason\r\nI was in search of, at once. For we know a wet sponge is longer in drying\r\nthan a wet piece of green wood, because the pores of the first are bigger.\r\nA seasoned or shrunk piece of wood dries quicker than a green one, for the\r\nsame reason.\r\n\r\n6. "Or you might bore a piece of wood with large gimlet holes, and another\r\nwith small ones, fill them both with water, and let them stand till the\r\nwater evaporated, and the difference of time it would take to do this\r\nwould make the case still more plain. So with the blades: the vapor\r\nlingers longest on the worst wrought and tempered one, because the pores,\r\nbeing larger, take in more of the wet particles, and require more time in\r\ndrying."\r\n\r\n7. "Your theory is at least a very ingenious one," observed Locke, "and I\r\nam reminded by it of another of the natural phenomena, of the true\r\nexplanation of which I have not been able to satisfy myself. It is this:\r\nwhat makes the earth freeze harder and deeper under a trodden path than\r\nthe untrodden earth around it? All that I have asked, say it is because\r\nthe trodden earth is more compact. But is that reason a sufficient one?"\r\n\r\n8. "No," said Bunker, "but I will tell you what the reason is, for I\r\nthought that out long ago. You know that, in the freezing months, much of\r\nthe warmth we get is given out by the earth, from which, at intervals, if\r\nnot constantly, to some extent, ascend the warm vapors to mingle with and\r\nmoderate the cold atmosphere above.\r\n\r\n9. "Now these ascending streams of warm air would be almost wholly\r\nobstructed by the compactness of a trodden path, and they would naturally\r\ndivide at some distance below it, and pass up through the loose earth on\r\neach side, leaving the ground along the line of the path, to a great depth\r\nbeneath it, a cold, dead mass, through which the frost would continue to\r\npenetrate, unchecked by the internal heat, which, in its unobstructed\r\nascent on each side, would be continually checking or overcoming the frost\r\nin its action on the earth around.\r\n\r\n10. "That, sir, is the true philosophy of the case, you may depend upon\r\nit. But we will now drop the discussion of these matters; for I am\r\nabundantly satisfied that you have not only knowledge enough, but that you\r\ncan think for yourself. And now, sir, all I wish to know further about you\r\nis, whether you can teach others to think, which is half the battle with a\r\nteacher. But as I have had an eye on this point, while attending to the\r\nothers, probably one experiment, which I will ask you to make on one of\r\nthe boys here, will be all I shall want."\r\n\r\n"Proceed, sir," said the other.\r\n\r\n11. "Ay, sir," rejoined Bunker, turning to the open fireplace, in which\r\nthe burning wood was sending up a column of smoke, "there, you see that\r\nsmoke rising, don\'t you? Well, you and I know the, reason why smoke goes\r\nupward, but my youngest boy does not, I think. Now take your own way, and\r\nsee if you can make him understand it."\r\n\r\n12. Locke, after a moment\'s reflection, and a glance round the room for\r\nsomething to serve for apparatus, took from a shelf, where he had espied a\r\nnumber of articles, the smallest of a set of cast-iron cart boxes, as are\r\nusually termed the round hollow tubes in which the axletree of a carriage\r\nturns. Then selecting a tin cup that would just take in the box, and\r\nturning into the cup as much water as he judged, with the box, would fill\r\nit, he presented them separately to the boy, and said,\r\n\r\n"There, my lad, tell me which of these is the heavier."\r\n\r\n13. "Why, the cart box, to be sure," replied the boy, taking the cup,\r\nhalf-filled with water, in one hand, and the hollow iron in the other.\r\n\r\n"Then you think this iron is heavier than as much water as would fill the\r\nplace of it, do you?" resumed Locke.\r\n\r\n"Why, yes, as heavy again, and more too--I know it is," promptly said the\r\nboy.\r\n\r\n14. "Well, sir, now mark what I do," proceeded the former, dropping into\r\nthe cup the iron box, through the hollow of which the water instantly rose\r\nto the brim of the vessel.\r\n\r\n"There, you saw that water rise to the top of the cup, did you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I did."\r\n\r\n"Very well, what caused it to do so?"\r\n\r\n15. "Why, I know well enough, if I could only think: why, it is because\r\nthe iron is the heavier, and as it comes all around the water so it can\'t\r\nget away sideways, it is forced up."\r\n\r\n"That is right; and now I want you to tell what makes that smoke rise up\r\nthe chimney."\r\n\r\n16. "Why,--I guess," replied the boy, hesitating, "I guess,--I guess I\r\ndon\'t know."\r\n\r\n"Did you ever get up in a chair to look on some high shelf, so that your\r\nhead was brought near the ceiling of a heated room, in winter? and did you\r\nnotice any difference between the air up there and the air near the\r\nfloor?"\r\n\r\n17. "Yes, I remember I have, and found the air up there as warm as\r\nmustard; and when I got down, and bent my head near the floor to pick up\r\nsomething, I found it as cold as could be."\r\n\r\n"That is ever the case; but I wish you to tell me how the cold air always\r\nhappens to settle down to the lower part of the room, while the warm air,\r\nsomehow, at the same time, gets above."\r\n\r\n18. "Why, why, heavy things settle down, and the cold air--yes, yes,\r\nthat\'s it, I am sure--the cold air is heavier, and so settles down, and\r\ncrowds up the warm air."\r\n\r\n"Very good. You then understand that cold air is heavier than the heated\r\nair, as that iron is heavier than the water; so now we will go back to the\r\nmain question--what makes the smoke go upwards?"\r\n\r\n19. "Oh! I see now as plain as day; the cold air settles down all round,\r\nlike the iron box, and drives up the hot air as fast as the fire heats it,\r\nin the middle, like the water; and so the hot air carries the smoke along\r\nup with it, just as feathers and things in a whirlwind. Well! I have found\r\nout what makes smoke go up--is n\'t it curious?"\r\n\r\n20. "Done like a philosopher!" cried Bunker. "The thing is settled. I will\r\ngrant that you are a teacher among a thousand. You can not only think\r\nyourself, but can teach others to think; so you may call the position\r\nyours as quick as you please."\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--2.

He\r\ngraduated at Madison University, of which his father was president. In\r\n1845 he published "Attractions of Language." For many years he was\r\nliterary editor of the "Chicago Journal." Mr. Taylor wrote considerably\r\nfor the magazines, was the author of many well-known favorite pieces both\r\nin prose and verse, and achieved success as a lecturer.\r\n\r\n1. Oh, a wonderful stream is the river of Time,\r\n     As it runs through the realm of tears,\r\n   With a faultless rhythm and a musical rhyme,\r\n   And a boundless sweep and a surge sublime,\r\n     As it blends with the ocean of Years.\r\n\r\n2. How the winters are drifting, like flakes of snow,\r\n     And the summers, like buds between;\r\n   And the year in the sheaf--so they come and they go,\r\n   On the river\'s breast, with its ebb and flow,\r\n     As it glides in the shadow and sheen.\r\n\r\n3. There\'s a magical isle up the river of Time,\r\n     Where the softest of airs are playing;\r\n   There\'s a cloudless sky and a tropical clime,\r\n   And a song as sweet as a vesper chime,\r\n     And the Junes with the roses are staying.\r\n\r\n4. And the name of that isle is the Long Ago,\r\n     And we bury our treasures there;\r\n   There are brows of beauty and bosoms of snow--\r\n   There are heaps of dust--but we love them so!--\r\n     There are trinkets and tresses of hair;\r\n\r\n5. There are fragments of song that nobody sings,\r\n     And a part of an infant\'s prayer,\r\n   There\'s a lute unswept, and a harp without strings;\r\n   There are broken vows and pieces of rings,\r\n     And the garments that she used to wear.\r\n\r\n6. There are hands that are waved, when the fairy shore\r\n     By the mirage is lifted in air;\r\n   And we sometimes hear, through the turbulent roar,\r\n   Sweet voices we heard in the days gone before,\r\n     When the wind down the river is fair.\r\n\r\n7. Oh, remembered for aye be the blessed Isle,\r\n     All the day of our life till night--\r\n   When the evening comes with its beautiful smile,\r\n   And our eyes are closing to slumber awhile,\r\n     May that "Greenwood." of Soul be in sight\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Realm, region, country. Rhythm, the harmonious flow of\r\nvocal sounds. Rhyme, a word answering in sound to another word. Surge, a\r\ngreat, rolling swell of water. 3.

A lute unswept, that is, unplayed.\r\n\r\n7. Greenwood is a notes and very beautiful cemetery at the southern\r\nextremity of Brooklyn, N.Y. The expression means, then, the resting place\r\nof the soul.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXV. THE BOSTON MASSACRE.\r\n\r\nGeorge Bancroft (b. 1800, d. 1891) was born at Worcester, Mass. He was an\r\nambitious student, and graduated at Harvard College before he was eighteen\r\nyears of age. He then traveled in Europe, spending some time at the German\r\nuniversities. On his return, in 1822, he was appointed tutor in Greek at\r\nHarvard. His writings at this time were a small volume of original poems,\r\nsome translations from Schiller and Goethe, and a few striking essays. Mr.\r\nBancroft has held numerous high political offices. In 1838 he was\r\nappointed collector of the port at Boston; in 1845 he was made secretary\r\nof the Navy; in 1849 he was sent as United States Minister to Great\r\nBritain; and in 1867 he was sent in the same capacity to Prussia. The work\r\nwhich has given Mr. Bancroft his great literary reputation is his "History\r\nof the United States, from the Discovery of the American Continent." The\r\nfirst volume appeared in 1834. Philosophical in reasoning, interesting,\r\nterse in style, and founded on careful research, under the most favorable\r\nadvantages, the work stands alone in its sphere.\r\n\r\n1. The evening of the fifth came on. The young moon was shining brightly\r\nin a cloudless winter sky, and its light was increased by a new-fallen\r\nsnow. Parties of soldiers were driving about the streets, making a parade\r\nof valor, challenging resistance, and striking the inhabitants\r\nindiscriminately with sticks or sheathed cutlasses.\r\n\r\n2. A band, which poured out from Murray\'s barracks, in Brattle Street,\r\narmed with clubs, cutlasses, and bayonets, provoked resistance, and a fray\r\nensued. Ensign Maul, at the gate of the barrack yard, cried to the\r\nsoldiers: "Turn out, and I will stand by you; kill them; stick them; knock\r\nthem down; run your bayonets through them." One soldier after another\r\nleveled a firelock, and threatened to "make a lane" through the crowd.\r\n\r\n3. Just before nine, as an officer crossed King Street, now State Street,\r\na barber\'s lad cried after him: "There goes a mean fellow who hath not\r\npaid my father for dressing his hair;" on which, the sentinel stationed at\r\nthe westerly end of the customhouse, on the corner of King Street and\r\nExchange Lane, left his post, and with his musket gave the boy a stroke on\r\nthe head, that made him stagger and cry for pain.\r\n\r\n4. The street soon became clear, and nobody troubled the sentry, when a\r\nparty of soldiers issued violently from the main guard, their arms\r\nglittering in the moonlight, and passed on, hallooing: "Where are they?\r\nwhere are they? Let them come."\r\n\r\n5. Presently twelve or fifteen more, uttering the same cries, rushed from\r\nthe south into King Street, and so by the way of Cornhill towards Murray\'s\r\nbarracks. "Pray, soldiers, spare my life," cried a boy of twelve, whom\r\nthey met. "No, no, I\'ll kill you all," answered one of them, and knocked\r\nhim down with his cutlass. They abused and insulted several persons at\r\ntheir doors and others in the street; "running about like madmen in a\r\nfury," crying, "Fire!" which seemed their watchword, and, "Where are\r\nthey? Knock them down." Their outrageous behavior occasioned the ringing\r\nof the bell at the head of King Street.\r\n\r\n6. The citizens, whom the alarm set in motion, came out with canes and\r\nclubs; and, partly by the interference of well-disposed officers, partly\r\nby the courage of Crispus Attucks, a mulatto, and some others, the fray at\r\nthe barracks was soon over. Of the citizens, the prudent shouted, "Home!\r\nhome!" others, it is said, cried out, "Huzza for the main guard! there is\r\nthe nest;" but the main guard was not molested the whole evening.\r\n\r\n7. A body of soldiers came up Royal Exchange Lane, crying, "Where are the\r\ncowards?" and, brandishing their arms, passed through King Street. From\r\nten to twenty boys came after them, asking, "Where are they? where are\r\nthey?" "There is the soldier who knocked me down," said the barber\'s boy;\r\nand they began pushing one another towards the sentinel. He loaded and\r\nprimed his musket. "The lobster is going to fire," cried a boy. Waving his\r\npiece about, the sentinel pulled the trigger.\r\n\r\n8. "If you fire you must die for it," said Henry Knox, who was passing by.\r\n"I don\'t care," replied the sentry, "if they touch me, I\'ll fire." "Fire!"\r\nshouted the boys, for they were persuaded he could not do it without leave\r\nfrom a civil officer; and a young fellow spoke out, "We will knock him\r\ndown for snapping," while they whistled through their fingers and huzzaed.\r\n"Stand off !" said the sentry, and shouted aloud, "Turn out, main guard!"\r\n"They are killing the sentinel," reported a servant from the customhouse,\r\nrunning to the main guard. "Turn out! why don\'t you turn cut?" cried\r\nPreston, who was captain of the day, to the guard.\r\n\r\n9. A party of six, two of whom, Kilroi and Montgomery, had been worsted at\r\nthe ropewalk, formed, with a corporal in front and Preston following. With\r\nbayonets fixed, they "rushed through the people" upon the trot, cursing\r\nthem, and pushing them as they went along. They found about ten persons\r\nround the sentry, while about fifty or sixty came down with them. "For\r\nGod\'s sake," said Knox! holding Preston by the coat, "take your men back\r\nagain; if they fire, your life must answer for the consequences." "I know\r\nwhat I am about," said he hastily, and much agitated.\r\n\r\n10. None pressed on them or provoked them till they began loading, when a\r\nparty of about twelve in number, with sticks in their hands, moved from\r\nthe middle of the street where they had been standing, gave three cheers,\r\nand passed along the front of the soldiers, whose muskets some of them\r\nstruck as they went by. "You are cowardly rascals," they said, "for\r\nbringing arms against naked men." "Lay aside your guns, and we are ready\r\nfor you." "Are the soldiers loaded?" inquired Palmes of Preston. "Yes," he\r\nanswered, "with powder and ball." "Are they going to fire upon the\r\ninhabitants?" asked Theodore Bliss. "They can not, without my orders,"\r\nreplied Preston; while "the town-born" called out, "Come on, you rascals,\r\nyou bloody backs, you lobster scoundrels, fire, if you dare. We know you\r\ndare not."\r\n\r\n11. Just then, Montgomery received a blow from a stick which had hit his\r\nMusket; and the word "fire!" being given by Preston, he stepped a little\r\nto one side, and shot Attucks, who at the time was quietly leaning on a\r\nlong stick. "Don\'t fire!" said Langford, the watchman, to Kilroi, looking\r\nhim full in the face; but yet he did so, and Samuel Gray, who was standing\r\nnext Langford, fell lifeless. The rest fired slowly and in succession on\r\nthe people, who were dispersing. Three persons were killed, among them\r\nAttucks, the mulatto; eight were wounded, two of them mortally. Of all the\r\neleven, not more than one had any share in the disturbance.\r\n\r\n12. So infuriated were the soldiers that, when the men returned to take up\r\nthe dead, they prepared to fire again, but were checked by Preston, while\r\nthe Twenty-ninth Regiment appeared under arms in King Street. "This is our\r\ntime," cried the soldiers of the Fourteenth; and dogs were never seen more\r\ngreedy for their prey.\r\n\r\n13. The bells rung in all the churches; the town drums beat. "To arms! to\r\narms!" was the cry. "Our hearts," said Warren, "beat to arms, almost\r\nresolved by one stroke to avenge the death of our slaughtered brethren;"\r\nbut they stood self-possessed, demanding justice according to the law.\r\n"Did you not know that you should not have fired without the order of a\r\ncivil magistrate?" asked Hutchinson, on meeting Preston. "I did it,"\r\nanswered Preston, "to save my men."\r\n\r\n14. The people would not be pacified or retire till the regiment was\r\nconfined to the guardroom and the barracks; and Hutchinson himself gave\r\nassurances that instant inquiries should be made by the county\r\nmagistrates. One hundred persons remained to keep watch on the\r\nexamination, which lasted till three hours after midnight. A warrant was\r\nissued against Preston, who surrendered himself to the sheriff; and the\r\nsoldiers of his party were delivered up and committed to prison.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1. In-dis-crim\'i-nate-ly, without distinction. 2. En-sued\',\r\nfollowed, resulted from. En\'sign (pro. en\'sin). an officer of low rank.\r\nFire\'lock, an old-style musket, with flintlock. 7.

War\'rant, a writ authorizing\r\nan officer to seize an offender.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--This massacre took place Monday, March 5, 1770.\r\n\r\n5. Cornhill is the name of a street in Boston.\r\n\r\n7. Lobster was the epithet applied to a British soldier by the Americans\r\non account of his red coat.\r\n\r\n8. Henry Knox (b. 1750, d. 1806) was then a bookseller in Boston. He\r\nafterwards became one of the American generals.\r\n\r\n8. Ropewalk. The active trouble resulting in the massacre arose from a\r\nsoldier\'s being thrashed the Friday before at Gray\'s ropewalk, where he\r\nhad challenged one of the workmen to fight; other soldiers joined in the\r\naffray from time to time, but were always worsted.\r\n\r\n13. Warren. This was Joseph Warren (b. 1741, d. 1775), the American\r\npatriot, killed shortly after at Bunker Hill.\r\n\r\nThomas Hutchinson was at this time lieutenant governor of Massachusetts.\r\nAlthough born in Boston, he sided with the British government in the\r\ntroubles before the Revolution, and sailed for England in 1774.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXVI. DEATH OF THE BEAUTIFUL.\r\n\r\n\r\nEliza Lee Fallen (b. 1787, d. 1859) was born in Boston, Mass. Her maiden\r\nname was Cabott. In 1828, she married Charles Follen, Professor of the\r\nGerman language and its literature in Harvard University. Her principal\r\nworks are "Sketches of Married Life," "The Skeptic," "Twilight Stories,"\r\nand "Little Songs." For several years Mrs. Follen was editor of the\r\n"Children\'s Friend."\r\n\r\n1. The young, the lovely, pass away,\r\n     Ne\'er to be seen again;\r\n   Earth\'s fairest flowers too soon decay,\r\n     Its blasted trees remain.\r\n\r\n2. Full oft, we see the brightest thing\r\n     That lifts its head on high,\r\n   Smile in the light, then droop its wing,\r\n     And fade away and die.\r\n\r\n3. And kindly is the lesson given;\r\n     Then dry the falling tear:\r\n   They came to raise our hearts to Heaven;\r\n     They go to call us there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXVII. SNOW FALLING.\r\n\r\nJohn James Piatt (b. 1835,--) was born in Dearborn County, Ind., and is\r\nof French descent. He began to write verses at the age of fourteen, and\r\nhas been connected editorially with several papers. Several editions of\r\nhis poems have been issued from time to time, each edition usually\r\ncontaining some additional poems. Of these volumes we may mention: "Poems\r\nin Sunshine and Firelight," "Western Windows," "The Lost Farm," and "Poems\r\nof House and Home."\r\n\r\n1. The wonderful snow is falling\r\n     Over river and woodland and wold;\r\n   The trees bear spectral blossom\r\n     In the moonshine blurr\'d and cold.\r\n\r\n2.

Wold, a plain or open country, a country without wood\r\nwhether hilly or not. Spec\'tral, ghostly. 2. Ban\'ished, condemned to\r\nexile, driven away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXVIII. SQUEERS\'S METHOD.\r\n\r\nCharles Dickens (b. 1812, d. 1870). This celebrated novelist was born in\r\nPortsmouth, England. He began his active life as a lawyer\'s apprentice, in\r\nLondon; but soon became a reporter, and followed this occupation from 1831\r\nto 1836. His first book was entitled "Sketches of London Society, by Boz."\r\nIn 1837 he published the "Pickwick Papers," a work which established his\r\nreputation as a writer. His other works followed with great rapidity, and\r\nhis last, "Edwin Drood," was unfinished when he died. He visited America\r\nin 1842 and in 1867. He is buried in Westminster Abbey. Mr. Dickens\r\nexcelled in humor and pathos, and was particularly successful in\r\ndelineating the joys and griefs of childhood. His writings have a tendency\r\nto prompt to deeds of kindness and benevolence. The following extract is\r\ntaken from "Nicholas Nickleby," one of the best of his novels.\r\n\r\n1. "Come," said Squeers, "let\'s go to the schoolroom; and lend me a hand\r\nwith my school coat, will you?"\r\n\r\nNicholas assisted his master to put on an old fustian shooting jacket,\r\nwhich he took down from a peg in the passage; and Squeers, arming himself\r\nwith his cane, led the way across a yard to a door in the rear of the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\n"There," said the schoolmaster, as they stepped in together; "this is our\r\nshop, Nickleby."\r\n\r\n2. It was such a crowded scene, and there were so many objects to attract\r\nattention, that at first Nicholas stared about him, really without seeing\r\nanything at all. By degrees, however, the place resolved itself into a\r\nbare and dirty room with a couple of windows, whereof a tenth part might\r\nbe of glass, the remainder being stopped up with old copy books and paper.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. There were a couple of long, old, rickety desks, cut and notched, and\r\ninked and damaged in every possible way; two or three forms, a detached\r\ndesk for Squeers, and another for his assistant. The ceiling was supported\r\nlike that of a barn, by crossbeams and rafters, and the walls were so\r\nstained and discolored that it was impossible to tell whether they had\r\never been touched by paint or whitewash.\r\n\r\n4. Pale and haggard faces, lank and bony figures, children with the\r\ncountenances of old men, deformities with irons upon their limbs, boys of\r\nstunted growth, and others whose long, meager legs would hardly bear their\r\nstooping bodies, all crowded on the view together. There were little faces\r\nwhich should have been handsome, darkened with the scowl of sullen, dogged\r\nsuffering; there was childhood with the light of its eye quenched, its\r\nbeauty gone, and its helplessness alone remaining.\r\n\r\n5. And yet this scene, painful as it was, had its grotesque features,\r\nwhich, in a less interested observer than Nicholas, might have provoked a\r\nsmile. Mrs. Squeers stood at one of the desks, presiding over an immense\r\nbasin of brimstone and treacle, of which delicious compound she\r\nadministered a large installment to each boy in succession, using for the\r\npurpose a common wooden spoon, which might have been originally\r\nmanufactured for some gigantic top, and which widened every young\r\ngentleman\'s mouth considerably, they being all obliged, under heavy\r\ncorporeal penalties, to take in the whole bowl at a gasp.\r\n\r\n6. "Now," said Squeers, giving the desk a great rap with his cane, which\r\nmade half the little boys nearly jump out of their boots, "is that\r\nphysicking over?"\r\n\r\n"Just over," said Mrs. Squeers, choking the last boy in her hurry, and\r\ntapping the crown of his head with the wooden spoon to restore him. "Here,\r\nyou Smike: take away now. Look sharp!"\r\n\r\n7. Smike shuffled out with the basin, and Mrs. Squeers hurried out after\r\nhim into a species of washhouse, where there was a small fire, and a large\r\nkettle, together with a number of little wooden bowls which were arranged\r\nupon a board. Into these bowls Mrs. Squeers, assisted by the hungry\r\nservant, poured a brown composition which looked like diluted pincushions\r\nwithout the covers, and was called porridge. A minute wedge of brown bread\r\nwas inserted in each bowl, and when they had eaten their porridge by means\r\nof the bread, the boys ate the bread itself, and had finished their\r\nbreakfast, whereupon Mr. Squeers went away to his own.\r\n\r\n8. After some half-hour\'s delay Mr. Squeers reappeared, and the boys took\r\ntheir places and their books, of which latter commodity the average might\r\nbe about one to eight learners. A few minutes having elapsed, during which\r\nMr. Squeers looked very profound, as if he had a perfect apprehension of\r\nwhat was inside all the books, and could say every word of their contents\r\nby heart, if he only chose to take the trouble, that gentleman called up\r\nthe first class.\r\n\r\n9. Obedient to this summons there ranged themselves in front of the\r\nschoolmaster\'s desk, half a dozen scarecrows, out at knees and elbows, one\r\nof whom placed a torn and filthy book beneath his learned eye.\r\n\r\n"This is the first class in English spelling and philosophy, Nickleby,"\r\nsaid Squeers, beckoning Nicholas to stand beside him. "We\'ll get up a\r\nLatin one, and hand that over to you. Now, then, where\'s the first boy?"\r\n\r\n10. "Please, sir, he\'s cleaning the back parlor window," said the\r\ntemporary head of the philosophical class.\r\n\r\n"So he is, to be sure," rejoined Squeers. "We go upon the practical mode\r\nof teaching, Nickleby; the regular education system. C-l-e-a-n, clean,\r\nverb active, to make bright, to scour. W-i-n, win, d-e-r, der, winder, a\r\ncasement. When the boy knows this out of book, he goes and does it. It\'s\r\njust the same principle as the use of the globes. Where\'s the second boy?"\r\n\r\n\r\n11. "Please, sir, he is weeding the garden," replied a small voice.\r\n\r\n"To be sure," said Squeers, by no means disconcerted, "so he is. B-o-t,\r\nbot, t-i-n, tin, n-e-y, ney, bottinney, noun substantive, a knowledge of\r\nplants. When he has learned that bottinney means a knowledge of plants,\r\nhe goes and knows \'em. That\'s our system, Nickleby: what do you think of\r\nit?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s a very useful one, at any rate," answered Nicholas, significantly.\r\n\r\n12. "I believe you," rejoined Squeers, not remarking the emphasis of his\r\nusher. "Third boy, what\'s a horse?"\r\n\r\n"A beast, sir," replied the boy.\r\n\r\n"So it is," said Squeers. "Ain\'t it, Nickleby?"\r\n\r\n"I believe there is no doubt of that, sir," answered Nicholas.\r\n\r\n"Of course there is n\'t," said Squeers. "A horse is a quadruped, and\r\nquadruped\'s Latin for beast, as everybody that\'s gone through the grammar\r\nknows, or else where\'s the use of having grammars at all?"\r\n\r\n"Where, indeed!" said Nicholas, abstractedly.\r\n\r\n13. "As you\'re perfect in that," resumed Squeers, turning to the boy, "go\r\nand look after my horse, and rub him down well, or I\'ll rub you down. The\r\nrest of the class go and draw water up till somebody tells you to leave\r\noff, for it\'s washing day to-morrow, and they want the coppers filled."\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Fus\'tian, a kind of cotton stuff, including corduroy,\r\nvelveteen, etc. 2. Re-solved\', made clear, disentangled. 4.\r\nDe-form\'i-ties, misshapen persons. Stunt\'ed, checked in growth. Mea\'ger,\r\nthin, lean. 5. Gro-tesque\' (pro. gro-tesk\'), fanciful, absurd.\r\nAd-min\'is-tered, gave, dispensed. In-stall\'ment (literally, part of a\r\ndebt), part, portion. Cor-po\'re-al, bodily. 6. Phys\'ick-ing, doctoring,\r\ntreating with medicine. 7. Di-lut\'ed, weakened by the addition of water.\r\n8. Com-mod\'i-ty, article, wares.

Sig-nif \'i-cant-ly, with\r\nmeaning. 12. Ab-stract\'-ed-ly, in an absent-minded way.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--1. Mr. Squeers is represented as an ignorant, brutal teacher, many\r\nof whom were to be found in Yorkshire, England, at the time of this story.\r\n\r\n\r\nNicholas Nickleby is a well-educated, refined young man, who has just\r\nobtained the position of assistant teacher, not knowing Squeers\'s true\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\n6. Smike is a poor scholar, disowned by his parents, and made almost\r\nidiotic by harsh treatment.\r\n\r\nThe novel from which this story is abridged, aided greatly in a\r\nmuch-needed reform in the Yorkshire schools; and the character of Squeers\r\nwas so true to life, that numerous suits were threatened against Mr.\r\nDickens by those who thought themselves caricatured.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXIX. THE GIFT OF EMPTY HANDS.\r\n\r\nMrs. S. M. B. Piatt (b, 1835,--) was born near Lexington, Ky. While still\r\na young girl she began to write poetry, which was well received. In 1861\r\nshe was married to the poet John James Piatt. Mrs. Piatt\'s poetry is\r\nmarked by tender pathos, thoughtfulness, and musical flow of rhythm. The\r\nfollowing selection is from "That New World."\r\n\r\n1. They were two princes doomed to death;\r\n   Each loved his beauty and his breath:\r\n   "Leave us our life and we will bring\r\n   Fair gifts unto our lord, the king."\r\n\r\n2. They went together.

We left the buffalo camp about eight o\'clock, and had a toilsome and\r\nharassing march of two hours, over ridges of hills covered with a ragged\r\nforest of scrub oaks, and broken by deep gullies.\r\n\r\n2. About ten o\'clock in the morning we came to where this line of rugged\r\nhills swept down into a valley, through which flowed the north fork of Red\r\nRiver. A beautiful meadow, about half a mile wide, enameled with yellow,\r\nautumnal flowers, stretched for two or three miles along the foot of the\r\nhills, bordered on the opposite side by the river, whose banks were\r\nfringed with cottonwood trees, the bright foliage of which refreshed and\r\ndelighted the eye, after being wearied by the contemplation of monotonous\r\nwastes of brown forest.\r\n\r\n3. The meadow was finely diversified by groves and clumps of trees, so\r\nhappily dispersed that they seemed as if set out by the hand of art. As we\r\ncast our eyes over this fresh and delightful valley, we beheld a troop of\r\nwild horses quietly grazing on a green lawn, about a mile distant, to our\r\nright, while to our left, at nearly the same distance, were several\r\nbuffaloes; some feeding, others reposing, and ruminating among the high,\r\nrich herbage, under the shade of a clump of cottonwood trees. The whole\r\nhad the appearance of a broad, beautiful tract of pasture land, on the\r\nhighly ornamented estate of some gentleman farmer, with his cattle grazing\r\nabout the lawns and meadows.\r\n\r\n4. A council of war was now held, and it was determined to profit by the\r\npresent favorable opportunity, and try our hand at the grand hunting\r\nmaneuver which is called "ringing the wild horse." This requires a large\r\nparty of horsemen, well mounted. They extend themselves in each direction,\r\nat a certain distance apart, and gradually form a ring of two or three\r\nmiles in circumference, so as to surround the game. This must be done with\r\nextreme care, for the wild horse is the most readily alarmed inhabitant of\r\nthe prairie, and can scent a hunter a great distance, if to windward.\r\n\r\n5. The ring being formed, two or three ride toward the horses, which start\r\noff in an opposite direction. Whenever they approach the bounds of the\r\nring, however, a huntsman presents himself, and turns them from their\r\ncourse. In this way they are checked, and driven back at every point, and\r\nkept galloping round and round this magic circle, until, being completely\r\ntired down, it is easy for hunters to ride up beside them and throw the\r\nlariat over their heads. The prime horses of the most speed, courage, and\r\nbottom, however, are apt to break through and escape, so that, in general,\r\nit is the second-rate horses that are taken.\r\n\r\n6. Preparations were now made for a hunt of this kind. The pack horses\r\nwere now taken into the woods and firmly tied to trees, lest in a rush of\r\nthe wild horses they should break away. Twenty-five men were then sent\r\nunder the command of a lieutenant to steal along the edge of the valley\r\nwithin the strip of wood that skirted the hills. They were to station\r\nthemselves about fifty yards apart, within the edge of the woods, and not\r\nadvance or show themselves until the horses dashed in that direction.\r\nTwenty-five men were sent across the valley to steal in like manner along\r\nthe river bank that bordered the opposite side, and to station themselves\r\namong the trees.\r\n\r\n7. A third party of about the same number was to form a line, stretching\r\nacross the lower part of the valley, so as to connect the two wings.\r\nBeatte and our other half-breed, Antoine, together with the ever-officious\r\nTonish, were to make a circuit through the woods so as to get to the upper\r\npart of the valley, in the rear of the horses, and drive them forward into\r\nthe kind of sack that we had formed, while the two wings should join\r\nbehind them and make a complete circle.\r\n\r\n8. The flanking parties were quietly extending themselves out of sight, on\r\neach side of the valley, and the residue were stretching themselves like\r\nthe links of a chain across it, when the wild horses gave signs that they\r\nscented an enemy; snuffing the air, snorting, and looking about. At length\r\nthey pranced off slowly toward the river, and disappeared behind a green\r\nbank.\r\n\r\n9. Here, had the regulations of the chase been observed, they would have\r\nbeen quietly checked and turned back by the advance of a hunter from among\r\nthe trees. Unluckily, however, we had our wildfire, Jack-o\'-lantern little\r\nFrenchman to deal with. Instead of keeping quietly up the right side of\r\nthe valley, to get above the horses, the moment he saw them move toward\r\nthe river he broke out of the covert of woods and dashed furiously across\r\nthe plain in pursuit of them. This put an end to all system. The\r\nhalf-breeds, and half a score of rangers, joined in the chase.\r\n\r\n10. A way they all went over the green bank. In a moment or two the wild\r\nhorses reappeared, and came thundering down the valley, with Frenchman,\r\nhalf-breeds, and rangers galloping and bellowing behind them. It was in\r\nvain that the line drawn across the valley attempted to check and turn\r\nback the fugitives; they were too hotly pressed by their pursuers: in\r\ntheir panic they dashed through the line, and clattered down the plain.\r\n\r\n11. The whole troop joined in the headlong chase, some of the rangers\r\nwithout hats or caps, their hair flying about their ears, and others with\r\nhandkerchiefs tied round their heads. The buffaloes, which had been calmly\r\nruminating among the herbage, heaved up their huge forms, gazed for a\r\nmoment at the tempest that came scouring down the meadow, then turned and\r\ntook to heavy, rolling flight. They were soon overtaken; the promiscuous\r\nthrong were pressed together by the contracting sides of the valley, and\r\naway they went, pellmell, hurry-skurry, wild buffalo, wild horse, wild\r\nhuntsman, with clang and clatter, and whoop and halloo, that made the\r\nforests ring.\r\n\r\n12. At length the buffaloes turned into a green brake, on the river bank,\r\nwhile the horses dashed up a narrow defile of the hills, with their\r\npursuers close to their heels. Beatte passed several of them, having fixed\r\nhis eye upon a fine Pawnee horse that had his ears slit and saddle marks\r\nupon his back. He pressed him gallantly, but lost him in the woods.\r\n\r\n13. Among the wild horses was a fine black mare, which in scrambling up\r\nthe defile tripped and fell. A young ranger sprang from his horse and\r\nseized her by the mane and muzzle. Another ranger dismounted and came to\r\nhis assistance. The mare struggled fiercely, kicking and biting, and\r\nstriking with her fore feet, but a noose was slipped over her head, and\r\nher struggles were in vain.\r\n\r\n14. It was some time, however, before she gave over rearing and plunging,\r\nand lashing out with her feet on every side. The two rangers then led her\r\nalong the valley, by two strong lariats, which enabled them to keep at a\r\nsufficient distance on each side to be out of the reach of her hoofs, and\r\nwhenever she struck out in one direction she was jerked in the other. In\r\nthis way her spirit was gradually subdued.\r\n\r\n15. As to Tonish, who had marred the whole scene by his precipitancy, he\r\nhad been more successful than he deserved, having managed to catch a\r\nbeautiful cream-colored colt about seven months old, that had not strength\r\nto keep up with its companions. The mercurial little Frenchman was beside\r\nhimself with exultation. It was amusing to see him with his prize. The\r\ncolt would rear and kick, and struggle to get free, when Tonish would take\r\nhim about the neck, wrestle with him, jump on his back, and cut as many\r\nantics as a monkey with a kitten.\r\n\r\n16. Nothing surprised me more, however, than to witness how soon these\r\npoor animals, thus taken from the unbounded freedom of the prairie,\r\nyielded to the dominion of man. In the course of two or three days the\r\nmare and colt went with the led horses and became quite docile.\r\n                                                     --Washington Irving.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1.

SOWING AND REAPING.\r\n\r\nAdelaide Anne Procter (b. 1825, d. 1864) was the daughter of Bryan Waller\r\nProcter (better known as "Barry Cornwall "), a celebrated English poet,\r\nliving in London. Miss Procter\'s first volume, "Legends and Lyrics,"\r\nappeared in 1858, and met with great success; it was republished in this\r\ncountry. A second series, under the same name, was published in 1860; and\r\nin 1862 both series were republished with additional poems, and an\r\nintroduction by Charles Dickens. In 1861 Miss Procter edited "Victoria\r\nRegia," a collection of poetical pieces, to which she contributed; and in\r\n1862 "A Chaplet of Verses," composed of her own poems, was published.\r\nBesides these volumes, she contributed largely to various magazines and\r\nperiodicals.\r\n\r\n1.

TAKING COMFORT.\r\n\r\n1. For the last few days, the fine weather has led me away from books and\r\npapers, and the close air of dwellings, into the open fields, and under\r\nthe soft, warm sunshine, and the softer light of a full moon. The\r\nloveliest season of the whole year--that transient but delightful interval\r\nbetween the storms of the "wild equinox, with all their wet," and the\r\ndark, short, dismal days which precede the rigor of winter--is now with\r\nus. The sun rises through a soft and hazy atmosphere; the light mist\r\nclouds melt gradually before him; and his noontide light rests warm and\r\nclear on still woods, tranquil waters, and grasses green with the late\r\nautumnal rains.\r\n\r\n2. One fine morning, not long ago, I strolled down the Merrimac, on the\r\nTewksbury shore. I know of no walk in the vicinity of Lowell so inviting\r\nas that along the margin of the river, for nearly a mile from the village\r\nof Belvidere. The path winds, green and flower-skirted, among beeches and\r\noaks, through whose boughs you catch glimpses of waters sparkling and\r\ndashing below. Rocks, huge and picturesque, jut out into the stream,\r\naffording beautiful views of the river and the distant city.\r\n\r\n3. Half fatigued with my walk, I threw myself down upon a rocky slope of\r\nthe bank, where the panorama of earth, sky, and water lay clear and\r\ndistinct about me. Far above, silent and dim as a picture, was the city,\r\nwith its huge mill masonry, confused chimney tops, and church spires; near\r\nit rose the height of Belvidere, with its deserted burial place and\r\nneglected gravestones sharply defined on its bleak, bare summit against\r\nthe sky; before me the river went dashing down its rugged channel, sending\r\nup its everlasting murmur; above me the birch tree hung its tassels; and\r\nthe last wild flowers of autumn profusely fringed the rocky rim of the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n4. Right opposite, the Dracut woods stretched upwards from the shore,\r\nbeautiful with the hues of frost, glowing with tints richer and deeper\r\nthan those which Claude or Poussin mingled, as if the rainbows of a summer\r\nshower had fallen among them. At a little distance to the right, a group\r\nof cattle stood mid-leg deep in the river; and a troop of children,\r\nbright-eyed and mirthful, were casting pebbles at them from a projecting\r\nshelf of rock. Over all a warm but softened sunshine melted down from a\r\nslumberous autumnal sky.\r\n\r\n5. My reverie was disagreeably broken. A low, grunting sound, half\r\nbestial, half human, attracted my attention. I was not alone. Close beside\r\nme, half hidden by a tuft of bushes, lay a human being, stretched out at\r\nfull length, with his face literally rooted into the gravel. A little boy,\r\nfive or six years of age, clean and healthful, with his fair brown locks\r\nand blue eyes, stood on the bank above, gazing down upon him with an\r\nexpression of childhood\'s simple and unaffected pity.\r\n\r\n6. "What ails you?" asked the boy at length. "What makes you lie there?"\r\n\r\nThe prostrate groveler struggled halfway up, exhibiting the bloated and\r\nfilthy countenance of a drunkard. He made two or three efforts to get upon\r\nhis feet, lost his balance, and tumbled forward upon his face.\r\n\r\n"What are you doing there?" inquired the boy.\r\n\r\n"I\'m taking comfort," he muttered, with his mouth in the dirt.\r\n\r\n7. Taking his comfort! There he lay,--squalid and loathsome under the\r\nbright heaven,--an imbruted man. The holy harmonies of Nature, the sounds\r\nof gushing waters, the rustle of the leaves above him, the wild flowers,\r\nthe frost bloom of the woods,--what were they to him? Insensible, deaf,\r\nand blind, in the stupor of a living death, he lay there, literally\r\nrealizing that most bitterly significant eastern malediction, "May you eat\r\ndirt."\r\n                                                              --Whittier.\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--l.

"CORPORAL GREEN!" the orderly cried;\r\n     "Here!" was the answer, loud and clear,\r\n     From the lips of a soldier standing near;\r\n   And "here!" was the word the next replied.\r\n   "Cyrus Drew!" and a silence fell;\r\n     This time no answer followed the call;\r\n     Only his rear man saw him fall,\r\n   Killed or wounded he could not tell.\r\n\r\n2. There they stood in the fading light,\r\n     These men of battle, with grave, dark looks,\r\n     As plain to be read as open books,\r\n   While slowly gathered the shades of night.\r\n   The fern on the slope was splashed with blood,\r\n     And down in the corn, where the poppies grew,\r\n     Were redder stains than the poppies knew;\r\n   And crimson-dyed was the river\'s flood.\r\n\r\n3. For the foe had crossed from the other side\r\n     That day, in the face of a murderous fire\r\n     That swept them down in its terrible ire;\r\n   And their lifeblood went to color the tide.\r\n   "Herbert Cline!" At the call there came\r\n     Two stalwart soldiers into the line,\r\n     Bearing between them Herbert Cline,\r\n   Wounded and bleeding, to answer his name.\r\n\r\n4. "Ezra Kerr!" and a voice said "here!"\r\n     "Hiram Kerr!" but no man replied:\r\n   They were brothers, these two; the sad wind sighed,\r\n   And a shudder crept through the cornfield near.\r\n   "Ephraim Deane!"--then a soldier spoke:\r\n     "Deane carried our regiment\'s colors," he said,\r\n     "When our ensign was shot; I left him dead,\r\n   Just after the enemy wavered and broke.\r\n\r\n5. "Close to the roadside his body lies;\r\n     I paused a moment and gave him to drink;\r\n     He murmured his mother\'s name, I think;\r\n   And death came with it and closed his eyes."\r\n   \'T was a victory--yes; but it cost us dear;\r\n     For that company\'s roll, when called at night,\r\n     Of a hundred men who went into the fight,\r\n   Numbered but twenty that answered "here!"\r\n                                                  --Shepherd.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXIV. TURTLE SOUP.\r\n\r\nCharles Frederick Briggs (b. 1804, d. 1877) was born on the island of\r\nNantucket. When quite young, however, he became a resident of New York\r\nCity. In 1845, in conjunction with Edgar A. Poe, he began the publication\r\nof the "Broadway Journal;" he was also connected with the "New York\r\nTimes," and the "Evening Mirror;" also as editor from 1853 to 1856 with\r\n"Putnam\'s Magazine." Mr. Briggs wrote a few novels, some poetry, and\r\nnumerous little humorous tales and sketches. The following selection is\r\nfrom "Working a Passage; or, Life on a Liner," one of his best stories.\r\n\r\n1. Among the luxuries which the captain had provided for himself and\r\npassengers was a fine green turtle, which was not likely to suffer from\r\nexposure to salt water, so it was reserved until all the pigs, and sheep,\r\nand poultry had been eaten. A few days before we arrived, it was\r\ndetermined to kill the turtle and have a feast the next day.\r\n\r\n2. Our cabin gentlemen had been long enough deprived of fresh meats to\r\nmake them cast lickerish glances towards their hard-skinned friend, and\r\nthere was a great smacking of lips the day before he was killed. As I\r\nwalked aft occasionally, I heard them congratulating themselves on their\r\nprospective turtle soup and forcemeat balls; and one of them, to heighten\r\nthe luxury of the feast, ate nothing but a dry biscuit for the twenty-four\r\nhours preceding, that he might be prepared to devour his full share of the\r\nunctuous compound.\r\n\r\n3. It was to be a gala day with them; and though it was not champagne day,\r\nthat falling on Saturday and this on Friday, they agreed to have champagne\r\na day in advance, that nothing should be wanting to give a finish to their\r\nturtle. It happened to be a rougher day than usual when the turtle was\r\ncooked, but they had become too well used to the motion of the ship to\r\nmind that.\r\n\r\n4. It happened to be my turn at the wheel the hour before dinner, and I\r\nhad the tantalizing misery of hearing them laughing and talking about\r\ntheir turtle, while I was hungry from want of dry bread and salt meat. I\r\nhad resolutely kept my thoughts from the cabin during all the passage but\r\nonce, and now I found my ideas clustering round a tureen of turtle in\r\nspite of all my philosophy.\r\n\r\n5. Confound them, if they had gone out of my hearing with their exulting\r\nsmacks, I should not have envied their soup, but their hungry glee so\r\nexcited my imagination that I could see nothing through the glazing of the\r\nbinnacle but a white plate with a slice of lemon on the rim, a loaf of\r\ndelicate bread, a silver spoon, a napkin, two or three wine glasses of\r\ndifferent hues and shapes, and a water goblet clustering round it, and a\r\nstream of black, thick, and fragrant turtle pouring into the plate.\r\n\r\n6. By and by it was four bells: they dined at three. And all the\r\ngentlemen, with the captain at their head, darted below into the cabin,\r\nwhere their mirth increased when they caught sight of the soup plates.\r\n"Hurry with the soup, steward," roared the captain. "Coming, sir," replied\r\nthe steward. In a few moments the cook opened the door of his galley, and\r\nout came the delicious steam of the turtle.\r\n\r\n7. Then came the steward with a large covered tureen in his hand, towards\r\nthe cabin gangway. I forgot the ship for a moment in looking at this\r\nprecious cargo, the wheel slipped from my hands, the ship broached to with\r\na sudden jerk; the steward had got only one foot upon the stairs, when\r\nthis unexpected motion threw him off his balance, and down he went by the\r\nrun, the tureen slipped from his hands, and part of its contents flew into\r\nthe lee scuppers, and the balance followed him in his fall.\r\n\r\n8. I laughed outright. I enjoyed the turtle a thousand times more than I\r\nshould have done if I had eaten the whole of it. But I was forced to\r\nrestrain my mirth, for the next moment the steward ran upon deck, followed\r\nby the captain, in a furious rage, threatening if he caught him to throw\r\nhim overboard. Not a spoonful of the soup had been left in the coppers,\r\nfor the steward had taken it all away at once to keep it warm. In about an\r\nhour afterwards the passengers came upon deck, looking more sober than I\r\nhad seen them since we left Liverpool. They had dined upon cold ham.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINTIONS.--1.

Some years ago a warehouseman in Manchester, England, published a\r\nscurrilous pamphlet, in which he endeavored to hold up the house of Grant\r\nBrothers to ridicule. William Grant remarked upon the occurrence that the\r\nman would live to repent of what he had done; and this was conveyed by\r\nsome talebearer to the libeler, who said, "Oh, I suppose he thinks I shall\r\nsome time or other be in his debt; but I will take good care of that." It\r\nhappens, however, that a man in business can not always choose who shall\r\nbe his creditors. The pamphleteer became a bankrupt, and the brothers held\r\nan acceptance of his which had been indorsed to them by the drawer, who\r\nhad also become a bankrupt.\r\n\r\n2. The wantonly libeled men had thus become creditors of the libeler! They\r\nnow had it in their power to make him repent of his audacity. He could not\r\nobtain his certificate without their signature, and without it he could\r\nnot enter into business again. He had obtained the number of signatures\r\nrequired by the bankrupt law except one. It seemed folly to hope that the\r\nfirm of "the brothers" would supply the deficiency. What! they who had\r\ncruelly been made the laughingstock of the public, forget the wrong and\r\nfavor the wrongdoer? He despaired. But the claims of a wife and children\r\nforced him at last to make the application. Humbled by misery, he\r\npresented himself at the countinghouse of the wronged.\r\n\r\n3. Mr. William Grant was there alone, and his first words to the\r\ndelinquent were, "Shut the door, sir!" sternly uttered. The door was shut,\r\nand the libeler stood trembling before the libeled. He  told his tale and\r\nproduced his certificate, which was instantly clutched by the injured\r\nmerchant. "You wrote a pamphlet against us once!" exclaimed Mr. Grant. The\r\nsuppliant expected to see his parchment thrown into the fire. But this was\r\nnot its destination. Mr. Grant took a pen, and writing something upon the\r\ndocument, handed it back to the bankrupt. He, poor wretch, expected to see\r\n"rogue, scoundrel, libeler," inscribed; but there was, in fair round\r\ncharacters, the signature of the firm.\r\n\r\n4. "We make it a rule," said Mr. Grant, "never to refuse signing the\r\ncertificate of an honest tradesman, and we have never heard that you were\r\nanything else." The tears started into the poor man\'s eyes. "Ah," said Mr.\r\nGrant, "my saying was true! I said you would live to repent writing that\r\npamphlet. I did not mean it as a threat. I only meant that some day you\r\nwould know us better, and be sorry you had tried to injure us. I see you\r\nrepent of it now." "I do, I do!" said the grateful man; "I bitterly repent\r\nit." "Well, well, my dear fellow, you know us now. How do you get on? What\r\nare you going to do?" The poor man stated he had friends who could assist\r\nhim when his certificate was obtained. "But how are you off in the\r\nmeantime?"\r\n\r\n5. And the answer was, that, having given up every farthing to his\r\ncreditors, he had been compelled to stint his family of even common\r\nnecessaries, that he might be enabled to pay the cost of his certificate.\r\n"My dear fellow, this will not do; your family must not suffer. Be kind\r\nenough to take this ten-pound note to your wife from me. There, there, my\r\ndear fellow! Nay, do not cry; it will all be well with you yet. Keep up\r\nyour spirits, set to work like a man, and you will raise your head among\r\nus yet." The overpowered man endeavored in vain to express his thanks; the\r\nswelling in his throat forbade words. He put his handkerchief to his face\r\nand went out of the door, crying like a child.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Ware\'house-man (English usage), one who keeps a wholesale\r\nstore for woolen goods.

Paper of this kind frequently\r\npasses from hand to hand, so that there are several indorsers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXVI. THE SOLDIER OF THE RHINE.\r\n\r\nCaroline Elizabeth Sarah Norton (b. 1808, d. 1877) was the grand-daughter\r\nof Richard Brinsley Sheridan. She wrote verses and plays at a very early\r\nage. "The Sorrows of Rosalie," published in 1829, was written before she\r\nwas seventeen years old. In 1827 she was married to the Hon. George\r\nChapple Norton. The marriage was an unhappy one, and they were divorced in\r\n1836. Her principal works are "The Undying One," "The Dream, and Other\r\nPoems," "The Child of the Islands," "Stuart of Dunleith, a Romance," and\r\n"English Laws for English Women of the 19th Century." She contributed\r\nextensively to the magazines and other periodicals.\r\n\r\n1.\r\nA soldier of the Legion lay dying in Algiers,\r\nThere was lack of woman\'s nursing, there was dearth of woman\'s tears;\r\nBut a comrade stood beside him, while his lifeblood ebbed away,\r\nAnd bent, with pitying glances, to hear what he might say.\r\nThe dying soldier faltered, as he took that comrade\'s hand,\r\nAnd he said: "I nevermore shall see my own, my native land;\r\nTake a message and a token to some distant friends of mine,\r\nFor I was born at Bingen,--at Bingen on the Rhine.\r\n\r\n2.\r\n"Tell my brothers and companions, when they meet and crowd around\r\nTo hear my mournful story in the pleasant vineyard ground,\r\nThat we fought the battle bravely, and when the day was done,\r\nFull many a corse lay ghastly pale beneath the setting sun;\r\nAnd, \'mid the dead and dying, were some grown old in wars,--\r\nThe death wound on their gallant breasts, the last of many scars;\r\nBut some were young, and suddenly beheld life\'s morn decline,--\r\nAnd one had come from Bingen,--fair Bingen on the Rhine.\r\n\r\n3.\r\n"Tell my mother that her other sons shall comfort her old age,\r\nFor I was aye a truant bird, that thought his home a cage.\r\nFor my father was a soldier, and, even when a child,\r\nMy heart leaped forth to hear him tell of struggles fierce and wild;\r\nAnd when he died, and left us to divide his scanty hoard,\r\nI let them take whate\'er they would, but kept my father\'s sword;\r\nAnd with boyish love I hung it where the bright light used to shine,\r\nOn the cottage wall at Bingen,--calm Bingen on the Rhine.\r\n\r\n4.\r\n"Tell my sister not to weep for me, and sob with drooping head,\r\nWhen the troops come marching home again, with glad and gallant tread,\r\nBut to look upon them proudly, with a calm and steadfast eye,\r\nFor her brother was a soldier, too, and not afraid to die;\r\nAnd if a comrade seek her love, I ask her in my name\r\nTo listen to him kindly, without regret or shame,\r\nAnd to hang the old sword in its place (my father\'s sword and mine),\r\nFor the honor of old Bingen,--dear Bingen on the Rhine.\r\n\r\n5.\r\n"There\'s another,--not a sister; in the happy days gone by,\r\nYou\'d have known her by the merriment that sparkled in her eye;\r\nToo innocent for coquetry,--too fond for idle scorning,--\r\nO friend! I fear the lightest heart makes sometimes heaviest mourning!\r\nTell her the last night of my life--(for, ere the moon be risen,\r\nMy body will be out of pain, my soul be out of prison),\r\nI dreamed I stood with her, and saw the yellow sunlight shine\r\nOn the vine-clad hills of Bingen,--fair Bingen on the Rhine.\r\n\r\n6.\r\n"I saw the blue Rhine sweep along: I heard, or seemed to hear,\r\nThe German songs we used to sing, in chorus sweet and clear;\r\nAnd down the pleasant river, and up the slanting hill,\r\nThe echoing chorus sounded, through the evening calm and still;\r\nAnd her glad blue eyes were on me, as we passed, with friendly talk,\r\nDown many a path beloved of yore, and well-remembered walk;\r\nAnd her little hand lay lightly, confidingly in mine,--\r\nBut we\'ll meet no more at Bingen,--loved Bingen all the Rhine."\r\n\r\n7.\r\nHis trembling voice grew faint and hoarse; his grasp was childish weak,\r\nHis eyes put on a dying look,--he sighed and ceased to speak.\r\nHis comrade bent to lift him, but the spark of life had fled,--\r\nThe soldier of the Legion in a foreign land was dead!\r\nAnd the soft moon rose up slowly, and calmly she looked down\r\nOn the red sand of the battlefield, with bloody corses strewn;\r\nYes, calmly on that dreadful scene, her pale light seemed to shine,\r\nAs it shone on distant Bingen,--fair Bingen on the Rhine.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Le\'gion (pro. le\'jun), division of an army. Dearth (pro.\r\nderth), scarcity. Ebbed, flowed out. 2. Corse, a dead body. 4. Stead\'fast,\r\nfirm, resolute. 5. Co-quet\'ry, trifling in love. 6. Cho\'rus, music in\r\nwhich all join. Yore, old times.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.--l. Bingen is pronounced Bing\'en, not Bin\'gen, nor Bin\'jen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXVII. THE WINGED WORSHIPERS.\r\n\r\nCharles Sprague (b. 1791, d. 1875) was born in Boston, Mass. He engaged in\r\nmercantile business when quite young, leaving school for that purpose. In\r\n1825, he was elected cashier of the Globe Bank of Boston, which position\r\nhe held until 1864. Mr. Sprague has not been a prolific writer; but his\r\npoems, though few in number, are deservedly classed among the best\r\nproductions of American poets. His chief poem is entitled "Curiosity."\r\n\r\n1.   Gay, guiltless pair,\r\n   What seek ye from the fields of heaven?\r\n     Ye have no need of prayer,\r\n   Ye have no sins to be forgiven.\r\n\r\n272    ECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n\r\n2.   Why perch ye here,\r\n   Where mortals to their Maker bend?\r\n     Can your pure spirits fear\r\n   The God ye never could offend?\r\n\r\n3.   Ye never knew\r\n   The crimes for which we come to weep;\r\n     Penance is not for you,\r\n   Blessed wanderers of the upper deep.\r\n\r\n4.   To you \'t is given\r\n   To wake sweet Nature\'s untaught lays;\r\n     Beneath the arch of heaven\r\n   To chirp away a life of praise.\r\n\r\n5.   Then spread each wing,\r\n   Far, far above, o\'er lakes and lands,\r\n     And join the choirs that sing\r\n   In yon blue dome not reared with hands.\r\n\r\n6.   Or, if ye stay\r\n   To note the consecrated hour,\r\n     Teach me the airy way,\r\n   And let me try your envied power.\r\n\r\n7.   Above the crowd,\r\n   On upward wings could I but fly,\r\n     I\'d bathe in yon bright cloud,\r\n   And seek the stars that gem the sky.\r\n\r\n8.   \'T were Heaven indeed,\r\n   Through fields of trackless light to soar,\r\n     On Nature\'s charms to feed,\r\n   And Nature\'s own great God adore.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--2. Perch, to light or settle on anything. 3. Pen\'-ance,\r\nsuffering for sin. 4. Lays, songs. 5. Choir (pro. kwir), a collection of\r\nsingers. Dome, an arched structure above a roof; hence, figuratively, the\r\nheavens. 6. Con\'se-crat-ed, set apart for the service of God. 8.\r\nTrack\'less, having no path.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.--This little poem was addressed to two swallows that flew into\r\nchurch during service.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXVIII. THE PEEVISH WIFE.\r\n\r\nMaria Edgeworth (b. 1767, d. 1849) was born near Reading. Berkshire,\r\nEngland. In 1782 her father removed with his family to Edgeworthtown,\r\nIreland, to reside on his estate. She lived here during the remainder of\r\nher life, with the exception of occasional short visits to England,\r\nScotland, and France. She was educated principally by her father, and they\r\nwere colaborers in literary productions, among which were "Essays on\r\nPractical Education," and the "Parent\'s Assistant." Her novels and tales\r\nwere written without assistance, and her fame as a writer rests on them.\r\nThe best known of these are "Castle Rackrent," "Moral Tales," "Tales of\r\nFashionable Life," "Frank," "The Modern Griselda," and "Helen." Miss\r\nEdgeworth excels in the truthful delineation of character, and her works\r\nare full of practical good sense and genuine humor.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bollingbroke. I wish I knew what was the matter with me this morning.\r\nWhy do you keep the newspaper all to yourself, my dear?\r\n\r\nMr. Bolingbroke. Here it is for you, my dear; I have finished it. Mrs. B.\r\nI humbly thank you for giving it to me when you have done with it. I hate\r\nstale news. Is there anything in the paper? for I can not be at the\r\ntrouble of hunting it.\r\n\r\nMr. B. Yes, my dear; there are the marriages of two of our friends.\r\n\r\nMrs.B. Who? Who?\r\n\r\nMr. B. Your friend, the widow Nettleby, to her cousin John Nettleby.\r\n\r\nMrs. B. Mrs. Nettleby? Dear! But why did you tell me?\r\n\r\nMr. B. Because you asked me, my dear.\r\n\r\nMrs. B. Oh, but it is a hundred times pleasanter to read the paragraph\r\none\'s self. One loses all the pleasure of the surprise by being told.\r\nWell, whose was the other marriage?\r\n\r\nMr. B. Oh, my dear, I will not tell you; I will leave you the pleasure of\r\nthe surprise.\r\n\r\nMrs. B. But you see I can not find it. How provoking you are, my dear! Do\r\npray tell me.\r\n\r\nMr. B. Our friend Mr. Granby.\r\n\r\nMrs. B. Mr. Granby? Dear! Why did you not make me guess? I should have\r\nguessed him directly. But why do you call him our friend? I am sure he is\r\nno friend of mine, nor ever was. I took an aversion to him, as you\r\nremember, the very first day I saw him. I am sure he is no friend of mine.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. B. I am sorry for it, my dear; but I hope you will go and see Mrs.\r\nGranby.\r\n\r\nMrs. B. Not I, indeed, my dear. Who was she?\r\n\r\nMr. B. Miss Cooke.\r\n\r\nMrs. B. Cooke? But, there are so many Cookes. Can\'t you distinguish her\r\nany way? Has she no Christian name?\r\n\r\nMr. B. Emma, I think. Yes, Emma.\r\n\r\nMrs. B. Emma Cooke? No; it can not be my friend Emma Cooke; for I am sure\r\nshe was cut out for an old maid.\r\n\r\nMr. B. This lady seems to me to be cut out for a good wife.\r\n\r\nMrs. B. Maybe so. I am sure I\'ll never go to see her. Pray, my dear, how\r\ncame you to see so much of her?\r\n\r\nMr. B. I have seen very little of her, my dear. I only saw her two or\r\nthree times before she was married.\r\n\r\nMrs. B. Then, my dear, how could you decide that she was cut out for a\r\ngood wife? I am sure you could not judge of her by seeing her only two or\r\nthree times, and before she was married.\r\n\r\nMr. B. Indeed, my love, that is a very just observation.\r\n\r\nMrs. B. I understand that compliment perfectly, and thank you for it, my\r\ndear. I must own I can bear anything better than irony.\r\n\r\nMr. B. Irony? my dear, I was perfectly in earnest.\r\n\r\nMrs. B. Yes, yes; in earnest; so I perceive; I may naturally be dull of\r\napprehension, but my feelings are quick enough; I comprehend too well.\r\nYes, it is impossible to judge of a woman before marriage, or to guess\r\nwhat sort of a wife she will make. I presume you speak from experience;\r\nyou have been disappointed yourself, and repent your choice.\r\n\r\nMr. B. My dear, what did I say that was like this? Upon my word, I meant\r\nno such thing. I really was not thinking of you in the least.\r\n\r\nMrs. B. No, you never think of me now. I can easily believe that you were\r\nnot thinking of me in the least.\r\n\r\nMr. B. But I said that only to prove to you that I could not be thinking\r\nill of you, my dear.\r\n\r\nMrs. B. But I would rather that you thought ill of me than that you should\r\nnot think of me at all.\r\n\r\nMr. B. Well, my dear, I will even think ill of you if that will please\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nMrs. B. Do you laugh at me? When it comes to this I am wretched indeed.\r\nNever man laughed at the woman he loved. As long as you had the slightest\r\nremains of love for me you could not make me an object of derision;\r\nridicule and love are incompatible, absolutely incompatible. Well, I have\r\ndone my best, my very best, to make you happy, but in vain. I see I am not\r\ncut out to be a good wife. Happy, happy Mrs. Granby!\r\n\r\nMr. B. Happy, I hope sincerely, that she will be with my friend; but my\r\nhappiness must depend on you, my love; so, for my sake, if not for your\r\nown, be composed, and do not torment yourself with such fancies.\r\n\r\nMrs. B. I do wonder whether this Mrs. Granby is really that Miss Emma\r\nCooke. I\'ll go and see her directly; see her I must.\r\n\r\nMr. B. I am heartily glad of it, my dear; for I am sure a visit to his\r\nwife will give my friend Granby real pleasure.\r\n\r\nMrs. B. I promise you, my dear, I do not go to give him pleasure, or you\r\neither, but to satisfy my own curiosity.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--I\'ron-y, language intended to convey a meaning contrary to\r\nits literal signification. De-ri\'sion, the act of laughing at in contempt.\r\nIn-com-pat\'i-ble, that can not exist together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXIX. THE RAINY DAY.\r\n\r\n1. The day is cold, and dark, and dreary;\r\n   It rains, and the wind is never weary;\r\n   The vine still clings to the moldering wall,\r\n   But at every gust the dead leaves fall.\r\n     And the day is dark and dreary.\r\n\r\n2. My life is cold, and dark, and dreary;\r\n   It rains, and the wind is never weary;\r\n   My thoughts still cling to the moldering Past,\r\n   But the hopes of youth fall thick in the blast,\r\n     And the days are dark and dreary.\r\n\r\n3. Be still, sad heart! and cease repining;\r\n   Behind the clouds is the sun still shining;\r\n   Thy fate is the common fate of all,\r\n   Into each life some rain must fall,\r\n     Some days must be dark and dreary.\r\n                                         --Longfellow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXC. BREAK, BREAK, BREAK.\r\n\r\nAlfred Tennyson (b. 1809, d. 1892) was born in Somersby, Lincolnshire,\r\nEngland. He graduated at Trinity College, Cambridge. His first volume of\r\npoems was published in 1830, but it made little impression and was\r\nseverely criticised. On the publication of his third series in 1842, his\r\npoetic genius began to receive general recognition. Mr. Tennyson was made\r\npoet laureate in 1850, and was regarded as the foremost living poet of\r\nEngland. For several years his residence was on the Isle of Wight. In\r\n1884, he was raised to the peerage.\r\n\r\n1. Break, break, break,\r\n     On thy cold gray stones, O sea!\r\n   And I would that my tongue could utter\r\n     The thoughts that arise in me.\r\n\r\n2. Oh, well for the fisherman\'s boy,\r\n     That he shouts with his sister at play!\r\n   Oh, well for the sailor lad,\r\n     That he sings in his boat on the bay!\r\n\r\n3. And the stately ships go on\r\n     To their haven under the hill;\r\n   But oh for the touch of a vanished hand,\r\n     And the sound of a voice that is still!\r\n\r\n4. Break, break, break,\r\n     At the foot of thy crags, O sea!\r\n   But the tender grace of a day that is dead\r\n     Will never come back to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCI. TRANSPORTATION AND PLANTING OF SEEDS.\r\n\r\nHenry David Thoreau (b. 1817, d. 1862). This eccentric American author and\r\nnaturalist was born at Concord, Mass. He graduated at Harvard University\r\nin 1837. He was a good English and classical scholar, and was well\r\nacquainted with the literature of the East. His father was a maker of lead\r\npencils, and he followed the business for a time, but afterwards supported\r\nhimself mainly by teaching, lecturing, land surveying, and carpentering.\r\nIn 1845 he built himself a small wooden house near Concord, on the shore\r\nof Walden Pond, where he lived about two years. He was intimate with\r\nHawthorne, Emerson, and other literary celebrities. His principal works\r\nare "Walden, or Life in the Woods," "A Week on Concord and Merrimac\r\nRivers," "Excursions," "Maine Woods," "Cape Cod," "A Yankee in Canada,"\r\nand "Letters to Various Persons." In descriptive power Mr. Thoreau has\r\nfew, if any, superiors.\r\n\r\n1. In all the pines a very thin membrane, in appearance much like an\r\ninsect\'s wing, grows over and around the seed, and independent of it,\r\nwhile the latter is being developed within its base. In other words, a\r\nbeautiful thin sack is woven around the seed, with a handle to it such as\r\nthe wind can take hold of, and it is then committed to the wind, expressly\r\nthat it may transport the seed and extend the range of the species; and\r\nthis it does as effectually as when seeds are sent by mail, in a different\r\nkind of sack, from the patent office.\r\n\r\n2. There is, then, no necessity for supposing that the pines have sprung\r\nup from nothing, and I am aware that I am not at all peculiar in asserting\r\nthat they come from seeds, though the mode of their propagation by Nature\r\nhas been but little attended to. They are very extensively raised from the\r\nseed in Europe, and are beginning to be here.\r\n\r\n3. When you cut down an oak wood, a pine wood will not at once spring up\r\nthere unless there are, or have been quite recently, seed-bearing pines\r\nnear enough for the seeds to be blown from them. But, adjacent to a forest\r\nof pines, if you prevent other crops from growing there, you will surely\r\nhave an extension of your pine forest, provided the soil is suitable.\r\n\r\n4. As I walk amid hickories, even in August, I hear the sound of green\r\npignuts falling from time to time, cut off by the chickaree over my head.\r\nIn the fall I notice on the ground, either within or in the neighborhood\r\nof oak woods, on all sides of the town, stout oak twigs three or four\r\ninches long, bearing half a dozen empty acorn cups, which twigs have been\r\ngnawed off by squirrels, on both sides of the nuts, in order to make them\r\nmore portable. The jays scream and the red squirrels scold while you are\r\nclubbing and shaking the chestnut trees, for they are there on the same\r\nerrand, and two of a trade never agree.\r\n\r\n5. I frequently see a red or a gray squirrel cast down a green chestnut\r\nburr, as I am going through the woods, and I used to think, sometimes,\r\nthat they were cast at me. In fact, they are so busy about it, in the\r\nmidst of the chestnut season, that you can not stand long in the woods\r\nwithout hearing one fall.\r\n\r\n6. A sportsman told me that he had, the day before--that was in the middle\r\nof October--seen a green chestnut burr dropped on our great river meadow,\r\nfifty rods from the nearest wood, and much farther from the nearest\r\nchestnut tree, and he could not tell how it came there. Occasionally, when\r\nchestnutting in midwinter, I find thirty or forty nuts in a pile, left in\r\nits gallery just under the leaves, by the common wood mouse.\r\n\r\n7. But especially, in the winter, the extent to which this transportation\r\nand planting of nuts is carried on, is made apparent by the snow. In\r\nalmost every wood you will see where the red or gray squirrels have pawed\r\ndown through the snow in a hundred places, sometimes two feet deep, and\r\nalmost always directly to a nut or a pine cone, as directly as if they had\r\nstarted from it and bored upward,--which you and I could not have done. It\r\nwould be difficult for us to find one before the snow falls. Commonly, no\r\ndoubt, they had deposited them there in the fall. You wonder if they\r\nremember the localities or discover them by the scent.\r\n\r\n8. The red squirrel commonly has its winter abode in the earth under a\r\nthicket of evergreens, frequently under a small clump of evergreens in the\r\nmidst of a deciduous wood. If there are any nut trees, which still retain\r\ntheir nuts, standing at a distance without the wood, their paths often\r\nlead directly to and from them. We, therefore, need not suppose an oak\r\nstanding here and there in the wood in order to seed it, but if a few\r\nstand within twenty or thirty rods of it, it is sufficient.\r\n\r\n9. I think that I may venture to say that every white-pine cone that falls\r\nto the earth naturally in this town, before opening and losing its seeds,\r\nand almost every pitch-pine one that falls at all, is cut off by a\r\nsquirrel; and they begin to pluck them long before they are ripe, so that\r\nwhen the crop of white-pine cones is a small one, as it commonly is, they\r\ncut off thus almost everyone of these before it fairly ripens.\r\n\r\n10. I think, moreover, that their design, if I may so speak, in cutting\r\nthem off green, is partly to prevent their opening and losing their seeds,\r\nfor these are the ones for which they dig through the snow, and the only\r\nwhite-pine cones which contain anything then. I have counted in one heap\r\nthe cores of two hundred and thirty-nine pitch-pine cones which had been\r\ncut off and stripped by the red squirrel the previous winter.\r\n\r\n11. The nuts thus left on the surface, or buried just beneath it, are\r\nplaced in the most favorable circumstances for germinating. I have\r\nsometimes wondered how those which merely fell on the surface of the earth\r\ngot planted; but, by the end of December, I find the chestnut of the same\r\nyear partially mixed with the mold, as it were, under the decaying and\r\nmoldy leaves, where there is all the moisture and manure they want, for\r\nthe nuts fall fast. In a plentiful year a large proportion of the nuts are\r\nthus covered loosely an inch deep, and are, of course, somewhat concealed\r\nfrom squirrels.\r\n\r\n12. One winter, when the crop had been abundant, I got, with the aid of a\r\nrake, many quarts of these nuts as late as the tenth of January; and\r\nthough some bought at the store the same day were more than half of them\r\nmoldy, I did not find a single moldy one among those which I picked from\r\nunder the wet and moldy leaves, where they had been snowed on once or\r\ntwice. Nature knew how to pack them best. They were still plump and\r\ntender. Apparently they do not heat there, though wet. In the spring they\r\nare all sprouting.\r\n\r\n13. Occasionally, when threading the woods in the fall, you will hear a\r\nsound as if some one had broken a twig, and, looking up, see a jay pecking\r\nat an acorn, or you will see a flock of them at once about it, in the top\r\nof an oak, and hear them break it off. They then fly to a suitable limb,\r\nand placing the acorn under one foot, hammer away at it busily, making a\r\nsound like a woodpecker\'s tapping, looking round from time to time to see\r\nif any foe is approaching, and soon reach the meat, and nibble at it,\r\nholding up their heads to swallow while they hold the remainder very\r\nfirmly with their claws. Nevertheless, it often drops to the ground before\r\nthe bird has done with it.\r\n\r\n14. I can confirm what William Barton wrote to Wilson, the ornithologist,\r\nthat "The jay is one of the most useful agents in the economy of nature\r\nfor disseminating forest trees and other nuciferous and hard-seeded\r\nvegetables on which they feed. In performing this necessary duty they drop\r\nabundance of seed in their flight over fields, hedges, and by fences,\r\nwhere they alight to deposit them in the post holes, etc. It is remarkable\r\nwhat numbers of young trees rise up in fields and pastures after a wet\r\nwinter and spring. These birds alone are capable in a few years\' time to\r\nreplant all the cleared lands."\r\n\r\n15. I have noticed that squirrels also frequently drop nuts in open land,\r\nwhich will still further account for the oaks and walnuts which spring up\r\nin pastures; for, depend on it, every new tree comes from a seed. When I\r\nexamine the little oaks, one or two years old, in such places, I\r\ninvariably find the empty acorn from which they sprung.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1.

Much of her early life was passed on White Island, one\r\nof a group of small islands, called the Isles of Shoals, about ten miles\r\nfrom the shore, where she lived in the lighthouse cottage. In 1867-68, she\r\npublished, in the "Atlantic Monthly," a number of papers on these islands,\r\nwhich were afterwards bound in a separate volume. Mrs. Thaxter was a\r\ncontributor to several periodicals, and in strength and beauty of style\r\nhas few equals among American writers. The following selection is from a\r\nvolume of her poems entitled "Drift Weed."\r\n\r\n1. I stood on the height in the stillness\r\n     And the planet\'s outline scanned,\r\n   And half was drawn with the line of sea\r\n     And half with the far blue land.\r\n\r\n2. With wings that caught the sunshine\r\n     In the crystal deeps of the sky,\r\n   Like shapes of dreams, the gleaming gulls\r\n     Went slowly floating by.\r\n\r\n3. Below me the boats in the harbor\r\n     Lay still, with their white sails furled;\r\n   Sighing away into silence,\r\n     The breeze died off the world.\r\n\r\n4. On the weather-worn, ancient ledges\r\n     Peaceful the calm light slept;\r\n   And the chilly shadows, lengthening,\r\n     Slow to the eastward crept.\r\n\r\n5. The snow still lay in the hollows,\r\n     And where the salt waves met\r\n   The iron rock, all ghastly white\r\n     The thick ice glimmered yet.\r\n\r\n6. But the smile of the sun was kinder,\r\n     The touch of the air was sweet;\r\n   The pulse of the cruel ocean seemed\r\n     Like a human heart to beat.\r\n\r\n7. Frost-locked, storm-beaten, and lonely,\r\n     In the midst of the wintry main,\r\n   Our bleak rock yet the tidings heard:\r\n     "There shall be spring again!"\r\n\r\n8. Worth all the waiting and watching,\r\n     The woe that the winter wrought,\r\n   Was the passion of gratitude that shook\r\n     My soul at the blissful thought!\r\n\r\n9. Soft rain and flowers and sunshine,\r\n     Sweet winds and brooding skies,\r\n   Quick-flitting birds to fill the air\r\n     With clear delicious cries;\r\n\r\n10. And the warm sea\'s mellow murmur\r\n      Resounding day and night;\r\n    A thousand shapes and tints and tones\r\n      Of manifold delight,\r\n\r\n11. Nearer and ever nearer\r\n      Drawing with every day!\r\n    But a little longer to wait and watch\r\n      \'Neath skies so cold and gray;\r\n\r\n12. And hushed is the roar of the bitter north\r\n      Before the might of the spring,\r\n    And up the frozen slope of the world\r\n      Climbs summer, triumphing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCIII. RELIGION THE ONLY BASIS OF SOCIETY.\r\n\r\nWilliam Ellery Channing (b. 1780, d. 1842), an eminent divine and orator,\r\nwas born at Newport, R.I. He graduated from Harvard with the highest\r\nhonors in 1798, and, in 1803, he was made pastor of the Federal Street\r\nChurch, Boston, with which he maintained his connection until his death.\r\nTowards the close of his life, being much enfeebled, he withdrew almost\r\nentirely from his pastoral duties, and devoted himself to literature. Dr.\r\nChanning\'s writings are published in six volumes, and are mainly devoted\r\nto theology.\r\n\r\n1. Religion is a social concern; for it operates powerfully on society,\r\ncontributing in various ways to its stability and prosperity. Religion is\r\nnot merely a private affair; the community is deeply interested in its\r\ndiffusion; for it is the best support of the virtues and principles, on\r\nwhich the social order rests. Pure and undefiled religion is to do good;\r\nand it follows, very plainly, that if God be the Author and Friend of\r\nsociety, then, the recognition of him must enforce all social duty, and\r\nenlightened piety must give its whole strength to public order.\r\n\r\n2. Few men suspect, perhaps no man comprehends, the extent of the support\r\ngiven by religion to every virtue. No man, perhaps, is aware how much our\r\nmoral and social sentiments are fed from this fountain; how powerless\r\nconscience would become without the belief of a God; how palsied would be\r\nhuman benevolence, were there not the sense of a higher benevolence to\r\nquicken and sustain it; how suddenly the whole social fabric would quake,\r\nand with what a fearful crash it would sink into hopeless ruin, were the\r\nideas of a Supreme Being, of accountableness and of a future life to be\r\nutterly erased from every mind.\r\n\r\n3. And, let men thoroughly believe that they are the work and sport of\r\nchance; that no superior intelligence concerns itself with human affairs;\r\nthat all their improvements perish forever at death; that the weak have no\r\nguardian, and the injured no avenger; that there is no recompense for\r\nsacrifices to uprightness and the public good; that an oath is unheard in\r\nheaven; that secret crimes have no witness but the perpetrator; that human\r\nexistence has no purpose, and human virtue no unfailing friend; that this\r\nbrief life is everything to us, and death is total, everlasting\r\nextinction; once let them thoroughly abandon religion, and who can\r\nconceive or describe the extent of the desolation which would follow?\r\n\r\n4. We hope, perhaps, that human laws and natural sympathy would hold\r\nsociety together. As reasonably might we believe that were the sun\r\nquenched in the heavens, our torches would illuminate, and our fires\r\nquicken and fertilize the creation. What is there in human nature to\r\nawaken respect and tenderness, if man is the unprotected insect of a day?\r\nAnd what is he more, if atheism be true?\r\n\r\n5. Erase all thought and fear of God from a community, and selfishness and\r\nsensuality would absorb the whole man. Appetite, knowing no restraint, and\r\nsuffering, having no solace or hope, would trample in scorn on the\r\nrestraints of human laws. Virtue, duty, principle, would be mocked and\r\nspurned as unmeaning sounds. A sordid self-interest would supplant every\r\nfeeling; and man would become, in fact, what the theory in atheism\r\ndeclares him to be,--a companion for brutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Com-mu\'ni-ty, society at large, the public. Dif-fu\'sion,\r\nextension, spread. En-light\'ened, elevated by knowledge and religion. 2.\r\nFab\'ric, any system composed of connected parts. Erased\', blotted out. 3.\r\nPer\'pe-tra-tor, one who commits a crime. Ex-tinc\'tion, a putting an end\r\nto. 4. Fer\'ti-lize, to make fruitful. A\'the-ism, disbelief in God.\r\nSen-su-al\'i-ty, indulgence in animal pleasure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCIV. ROCK ME TO SLEEP.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Akers Allen (b. 1832,--) was born at Strong, Maine, and passed\r\nher childhood amidst the picturesque scenery of that neighborhood. She\r\nlost her mother when very young, but inherited her grace and delicacy of\r\nthought. Shortly after her mother\'s death, her father removed to\r\nFarmington, Maine, a town noted for its literary people. Mrs. Allen\'s\r\nearly pieces appeared over the pseudonym of "Florence Percy." Her first\r\nverses appeared when she was twelve years old; and her first volume,\r\nentitled "Forest Buds from the Woods of Maine," was Published in 1856. For\r\nsome years she was assistant editor of the "Portland Transcript." The\r\nfollowing selection was claimed by five different persons, who attempted\r\nto steal the honor of its composition.\r\n\r\n1. Backward, turn backward, O Time, in your flight,\r\n   Make me a child again, just for to-night!\r\n   Mother, come back from the echoless shore,\r\n   Take me again to your heart as of yore;\r\n   Kiss from my forehead the furrows of care,\r\n   Smooth the few silver threads out of my hair;\r\n   Over my slumbers your loving watch keep;--\r\n   Rock me to sleep, mother,--rock me to sleep!\r\n\r\n2. Backward, flow backward, O tide of the years!\r\n   I am so weary of toil and of tears;\r\n   Toil without recompense, tears all in vain;\r\n   Take them, and give me my childhood again!\r\n   I have grown weary of dust and decay,--\r\n   Weary of flinging my soul wealth away;\r\n   Weary of sowing for others to reap;--\r\n   Rock me to sleep, mother,--rock me to sleep!\r\n\r\n3. Tired of the hollow, the base, the untrue,\r\n   Mother, O mother, my heart calls for you!\r\n   Many a summer the grass has grown green,\r\n   Blossomed and faded, our faces between:\r\n   Yet with strong yearning and passionate pain,\r\n   Long I to-night for your presence again.\r\n   Come from the silence so long and so deep;--\r\n   Rock me to sleep, mother,--rock me to sleep!\r\n\r\n4. Over my heart in the days that are flown,\r\n   No love like mother love ever has shone;\r\n   No other worship abides and endures,\r\n   Faithful, unselfish, and patient like yours:\r\n   None like a mother can charm away pain\r\n   From the sick soul, and the world-weary brain.\r\n   Slumber\'s soft calms o\'er my heavy lids creep;--\r\n   Rock me to sleep, mother,--rock me to sleep!\r\n\r\n5. Come, let your brown hair, just lighted with gold,\r\n   Fall on your shoulders again, as of old;\r\n   Let it drop over my forehead to-night,\r\n   Shading my faint eyes away from the light;\r\n   For with its sunny-edged shadows once more,\r\n   Haply will throng the sweet visions of yore;\r\n   Lovingly, softly, its bright billows sweep;--\r\n   Rock me to sleep, mother,--rock me to sleep!\r\n\r\n6. Mother, dear mother, the years have been long\r\n   Since I last listened your lullaby song;\r\n   Sing, then, and unto my soul it shall seem\r\n   Womanhood\'s years have been only a dream!\r\n   Clasped to your heart in a loving embrace,\r\n   With your light lashes just sweeping my face,\r\n   Never hereafter to wake or to weep:--\r\n   Rock me to sleep, mother,--rock me to sleep!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCV. MAN AND THE INFERIOR ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n1. The chief difference between man and the other animals consists in\r\nthis, that the former has reason, whereas the latter have only instinct;\r\nbut, in order to understand what we mean by the terms reason and instinct,\r\nit will be necessary to mention three things in which the difference very\r\ndistinctly appears.\r\n\r\n2. Let us first, to bring the parties as nearly on a level as possible,\r\nconsider man in a savage state, wholly occupied, like the beasts of the\r\nfield, in providing for the wants of his animal nature; and here the first\r\ndistinction that appears between them is the use of implements. When the\r\nsavage provides himself with a hut or a wigwam for shelter, or that he may\r\nstore up his provisions, he does no more than is done by the rabbit, the\r\nbeaver, the bee, and birds of every species.\r\n\r\n3. But the man can not make any progress in this work without tools; he\r\nmust provide himself with an ax even before he can cut down a tree for its\r\ntimber; whereas these animals form their burrows, their cells, or their\r\nnests, with no other tools than those with which nature has provided them.\r\nIn cultivating the ground, also, man can do nothing without a spade or a\r\nplow; nor can he reap what he has sown till he has shaped an implement\r\nwith which to cut clown his harvest. But the inferior animals provide for\r\nthemselves and their young without any of these things.\r\n\r\n4. Now for the second distinction. Man, in all his operations, makes\r\nmistakes; animals make none. Did you ever hear of such a thing as a bird\r\nsitting on a twig lamenting over her half-finished nest and puzzling her\r\nlittle head to know how to complete it? Or did you ever see the cells of a\r\nbeehive in clumsy, irregular shapes, or observe anything like a discussion\r\nin the little community, as if there were a difference of opinion among\r\nthe architects?\r\n\r\n5. The lower animals are even better physicians than we are; for when they\r\nare ill, they will, many of them, seek out some particular herb, which\r\nthey do not, use as food, and which possesses a medicinal quality exactly\r\nsuited to the complaint; whereas, the whole college of physicians will\r\ndispute for a century about the virtues of a single drug.\r\n\r\n6. Man undertakes nothing in which he is not more or less puzzled; and\r\nmust try numberless experiments before he can bring his undertakings to\r\nanything like perfection; even the simplest operations of domestic life\r\nare not well performed without some experience; and the term of man\'s life\r\nis half wasted before he has done with his mistakes and begins to profit\r\nby his lessons.\r\n\r\n7. The third distinction is that animals make no improvements; while the\r\nknowledge, and skill, and the success of man are perpetually on the\r\nincrease. Animals, in all their operations, follow the first impulse of\r\nnature or that instinct which God has implanted in them. In all they do\r\nundertake, therefore, their works are more perfect and regular than those\r\nof man.\r\n\r\n8. But man, having been endowed with the faculty of thinking or reasoning\r\nabout what he does, is enabled by patience and industry to correct the\r\nmistakes into which he at first falls, and to go on constantly improving.\r\nA bird\'s nest is, indeed, a perfect structure; yet the nest of a swallow\r\nof the nineteenth century is not at all more commodious or elegant than\r\nthose that were built amid the rafters of Noah\'s ark. But if we compare\r\nthe wigwam of the savage with the temples and palaces of ancient Greece\r\nand Rome, we then shall see to what man\'s mistakes, rectified and improved\r\nupon, conduct him.\r\n\r\n9.  "When the vast sun shall veil his golden light\r\n    Deep in the gloom of everlasting night;\r\n    When wild, destructive flames shall wrap the skies,\r\n    When ruin triumphs, and when nature dies;\r\n    Man shall alone the wreck of worlds survive;\r\n    \'Mid falling spheres, immortal man shall live."\r\n                                                         --Jane Taylor.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--2. Dis-tinc\'tion, a point of difference. Im\'ple-ments,\r\nutensils, tools. Wigwam, an Indian hut. 3. Bur\'rows, holes in the earth\r\nwhere animals lodge. 4. Dis-cus\'sion, the act of arguing a point, debate.\r\n5. Me-dic\'i-nal, healing. 8. En-dowed\', furnished with any gift, quality,\r\netc. Fac\'ul-ty, ability to act or perform. Rec\'ti-fied, corrected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCVI. THE BLIND MEN AND THE ELEPHANT.\r\n\r\nJohn Godfrey Saxe (b. 1816, d.1887), an American humorist, lawyer, and\r\njournalist, was born at Highgate, Vt. He graduated at Middlebury College\r\nin 1839; was admitted to the bar in 1843; and practiced law until 1850,\r\nwhen he became editor of the "Burlington Sentinel." In 1851, he was\r\nelected State\'s attorney. "Progress, a Satire, and Other Poems," his first\r\nvolume, was published in 1849, and several other volumes of great merit\r\nattest his originality. For genial humor and good-natured satire, Saxe\'s\r\nwritings rank among the best of their kind, and are very popular.\r\n\r\n1. It was six men of Indostan,\r\n     To learning much inclined,\r\n   Who went to see the elephant,\r\n     (Though all of them were blind,)\r\n   That each by observation\r\n     Might satisfy his mind.\r\n\r\n2. The first approached the elephant,\r\n     And, happening to fall\r\n   Against his broad and sturdy side,\r\n     At once began to bawl:\r\n   "God bless me! but the elephant\r\n     Is very like a wall!"\r\n\r\n3. The second, feeling of the tusk,\r\n     Cried: "Ha! what have we here,\r\n   So very round, and smooth, and sharp?\r\n     To me \'t is very clear,\r\n   This wonder of an elephant\r\n     Is very like a spear!"\r\n\r\n4. The third approached the animal,\r\n     And, happening to take\r\n   The squirming trunk within his hands,\r\n     Thus boldly up he spake:\r\n   "I see," quoth he, "the elephant\r\n     Is very like a snake!"\r\n\r\n5. The fourth reached out his eager hand,\r\n     And fell about the knee:\r\n   "What most this wondrous beast is like,\r\n     Is very plain," quoth he;\r\n   " \'T is clear enough the elephant\r\n     Is very like a tree!"\r\n\r\n6. The fifth, who chanced to touch the ear,\r\n     Said: "E\'en the blindest man\r\n   Can tell what this resembles most:\r\n     Deny the fact who can,\r\n   This marvel of an elephant\r\n     Is very like a fan!"\r\n\r\n7. The sixth no sooner had begun\r\n     About the beast to grope,\r\n   Than, seizing on the swinging tail\r\n     That fell within his scope,\r\n   "I see," quoth he, "the elephant\r\n     Is very like a rope!"\r\n\r\n8. And so these men of Indostan\r\n     Disputed loud and long,\r\n   Each in his own opinion\r\n     Exceeding stiff and strong,\r\n   Though each was partly in the right,\r\n     And all were in the wrong!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCVII. A HOME SCENE.\r\n\r\nDonald Grant Mitchell (b. 1822,--). This popular American writer was born\r\nin Norwich, Conn. He graduated at Yale in 1841. In 1844 he went to\r\nEngland, and, after traveling through that country on foot, spent some\r\ntime on the continent. His first volume, "Fresh Gleanings, or a New Sheaf\r\nfrom the Old Fields of Continental Europe, by Ik Marvel," was published in\r\n1847, soon after his return home. He revisited Europe in 1848. On his\r\nreturn, he published "The Battle Summer." Mr. Mitchell has contributed to\r\nthe "Knickerbocker Magazine," the "Atlantic Monthly," and several\r\nagricultural journals. His most popular works are "The Reveries of a\r\nBachelor," 1850, and "Dream Life," 1851. Besides these, he has written "My\r\nFarm of Edgewood," "Wet Days at Edgewood," "Doctor Johns," a novel "Rural\r\nStudies," and other works. He is a charming writer. In 1853 he was\r\nappointed United States consul at Venice. In 1855 he settled on a farm\r\nnear New Haven, Conn., where he now resides. The following selection is\r\nfrom "Dream Life."\r\n\r\n1. Little does the boy know, as the tide of years drifts by, floating him\r\nout insensibly from the harbor of his home, upon the great sea of\r\nlife,--what joys, what opportunities, what affections, are slipping from\r\nhim into the shades of that inexorable Past, where no man can go, save on\r\nthe wings of his dreams.\r\n\r\n2. Little does he think, as he leans upon the lap of his mother, with his\r\neye turned to her, in some earnest pleading for a fancied pleasure of the\r\nhour, or in some important story of his griefs, that such sharing of his\r\nsorrows, and such sympathy with his wishes, he will find nowhere again.\r\n\r\n3. Little does he imagine that the fond sister Nelly, ever thoughtful of\r\nhis pleasures, ever smiling away his griefs, will soon be beyond the reach\r\nof either; and that the waves of the years which come rocking so gently\r\nunder him will soon toss her far away, upon the great swell of life.\r\n\r\n4. But now, you are there. The fire light glimmers upon the walls of your\r\ncherished home. The big chair of your father is drawn to its wonted corner\r\nby the chimney side; his head, just touched with gray, lies back upon its\r\noaken top. Opposite sits your mother: her figure is thin, her look\r\ncheerful, yet subdued;--her arm perhaps resting on your shoulder, as she\r\ntalks to you in tones of tender admonition, of the days that are to come.\r\n\r\n5. The cat is purring on the hearth; the clock that ticked so plainly when\r\nCharlie died is ticking on the mantel still. The great table in the middle\r\nof the room, with its books and work, waits only for the lighting of the\r\nevening lamp, to see a return to its stores of embroidery and of story.\r\n\r\n6. Upon a little stand under the mirror, which catches now and then a\r\nflicker of the fire light, and makes it play, as if in wanton, upon the\r\nceiling, lies that big book, reverenced of your New England parents--the\r\nFamily Bible. It is a ponderous, square volume, with heavy silver clasps,\r\nthat you have often pressed open for a look at its quaint, old pictures,\r\nfor a study of those prettily bordered pages, which lie between the\r\nTestaments, and which hold the Family Record.\r\n\r\n7. There are the Births;--your father\'s and your mother\'s; it seems as if\r\nthey were born a long time ago; and even your own date of birth appears an\r\nalmost incredible distance back. Then there are the Marriages;--only one\r\nas yet; and your mother\'s name looks oddly to you: it is hard to think of\r\nher as anyone else than your doting parent.\r\n\r\n8. Last of all come the Deaths;--only one. Poor Charlie! How it looks!--"\r\nDied, 12 September, 18--, Charles Henry, aged four years." You know just\r\nhow it looks. You have turned to it often; there you seem to be joined to\r\nhim, though only by the turning of a leaf.\r\n\r\n9. And over your thoughts, as you look at that page of the Record, there\r\nsometimes wanders a vague, shadowy fear, which will come,--that your own\r\nname may soon be there. You try to drop the notion, as if it were not\r\nfairly your own; you affect to slight it, as you would slight a boy who\r\npresumed on your acquaintance, but whom you have no desire to know.\r\n\r\n10. Yet your mother--how strange it is!--has no fears of such dark\r\nfancies. Even now, as you stand beside her, and as the twilight deepens in\r\nthe room, her low, silvery voice is stealing upon your ear, telling you\r\nthat she can not be long with you;--that the time is coming, when you must\r\nbe guided by your own judgment, and struggle with the world unaided by the\r\nfriends of your boyhood.\r\n\r\n11. There is a little pride, and a great deal more of anxiety, in your\r\nthoughts now, as you look steadfastly into the home blaze, while those\r\ndelicate fingers, so tender of your happiness, play with the locks upon\r\nyour brow. To struggle with the world,--that is a proud thing; to struggle\r\nalone,--there lies the doubt! Then crowds in swift upon the calm of\r\nboyhood the first anxious thought of youth.\r\n\r\n12. The hands of the old clock upon the mantel that ticked off the hours\r\nwhen Charlie sighed and when Charlie died, draw on toward midnight. The\r\nshadows that the fireflame makes grow dimmer and dimmer. And thus it is,\r\nthat Home,--boy home, passes away forever,--like the swaying of a\r\npendulum,--like the fading of a shadow on the floor.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--l. In-ex\'or-a-ble, not to be changed. 4. Wont\'ed,\r\naccustomed. Ad-mo-ni\'tion (pro. ad-mo\'nish\'un), counseling against fault\r\nor error. 13. Pon\'der-ous, very heavy. Quaint (pro. kwant), odd and\r\nantique. 7. In-cred\'i-ble, impossible to be believed. Dot\'-ing, loving to\r\nexcess. 9. Vague (pro. vag), indefinite. Pre-sumed\', pushed upon or\r\nintruded in an impudent manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCVIII. THE LIGHT OF OTHER DAYS.\r\n\r\nThomas Moore (b. 1779. d. 1852) was born in Dublin, Ireland, and he was\r\neducated at Trinity College in that city. In 1799, he entered the Middle\r\nTemple, London, as a student of law. Soon after the publication of his\r\nfirst poetical productions, he was sent to Bermuda in an official\r\ncapacity. He subsequently visited the United States. Moore\'s most famous\r\nworks are: "Lalla Rookh," an Oriental romance, 1817; "The Loves of the\r\nAngels," 1823; and "Irish Melodies," 1834; a "Life of Lord Byron," and\r\n"The Epicurean, an Eastern Tale." "Moore\'s excellencies," says Dr. Angus,\r\n"consist in the gracefulness of his thoughts, the wit and fancy of his\r\nallusions and imagery, and the music and refinement of his versification."\r\n\r\n1. Oft in the stilly night\r\n     Ere slumber\'s chain has bound me,\r\n   Fond memory brings the light\r\n     Of other days around me:\r\n       The smiles, the tears\r\n       Of boyhood\'s years,\r\n     The words of love then spoken;\r\n       The eyes that shone,\r\n       Now dimmed and gone,\r\n     The cheerful hearts now broken!\r\n   Thus in the stilly night\r\n     Ere slumber\'s chain has bound me,\r\n   Sad memory brings the light\r\n     Of other days around me.\r\n\r\n2. When I remember all\r\n     The friends so linked together\r\n   I\'ve seen around me fall\r\n     Like leaves in wintry weather,\r\n       I feel like one\r\n       Who treads alone\r\n     Some banquet hall deserted,\r\n       Whose lights are fled\r\n       Whose garlands dead,\r\n     And all but he departed.\r\n   Thus in the stilly night\r\n     Ere slumber\'s chain has bound me,\r\n   Sad memory brings the light\r\n     Of other days around me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXCIX. A CHASE IN THE ENGLISH CHANNEL.\r\n\r\nJames Fenimore Cooper (b. 1789, d. 1851). This celebrated American\r\nnovelist was born in Burlington, N.J. His father removed to the state of\r\nNew York about 1790, and founded Cooperstown, on Otsego Lake. He studied\r\nthree years at Yale, and then entered the navy as a common sailor. He\r\nbecame a midshipman in 1806, and was afterwards promoted to the rank of\r\nlieutenant; but he left the service in 1811. His first novel,\r\n"Precaution," was published in 1819; his best work, "The Spy," a tale of\r\nthe Revolutionary War, in 1821. The success of "The Spy" was almost\r\nunprecedented, and its author at once took rank among the most popular\r\nwriters of the day. "The Pilot" and "The Red Rover" are considered his\r\nbest sea novels. "The Pioneers," "The Last of the Mohicans," "The\r\nPrairie," "The Pathfinder," and "The Deerslayer" are among the best of his\r\ntales of frontier life. The best of his novels have been translated into\r\nnearly all of the European languages, and into some of those of Asia. "The\r\ncreations of his genius," says Bryant, "shall survive through centuries to\r\ncome, and only perish with our language." The following selection is from\r\n"The Pilot."\r\n\r\n1. The ship which the American frigate had now to oppose, was a vessel of\r\nnear her own size and equipage; and when Griffith looked at her again, he\r\nperceived that she had made her preparations to assert her equality in\r\nmanful fight.\r\n\r\n2. Her sails had been gradually reduced to the usual quantity, and, by\r\ncertain movements on her decks, the lieutenant and his constant attendant,\r\nthe Pilot, well understood that she only wanted to lessen the distance a\r\nfew hundred yards to begin the action.\r\n\r\n"Now spread everything," whispered the stranger.\r\n\r\n3. Griffith applied the trumpet to his mouth, and shouted, in a voice that\r\nwas carried even to his enemy, "Let fall--out with your booms--sheet\r\nhome--hoist away of everything!"\r\n\r\n4. The inspiring cry was answered by a universal bustle. Fifty men flew\r\nout on the dizzy heights of the different spars, while broad sheets of\r\ncanvas rose as suddenly along the masts, as if some mighty bird were\r\nspreading its wings. The Englishman instantly perceived his mistake, and\r\nhe answered the artifice by a roar of artillery. Griffith watched the\r\neffects of the broadside with an absorbing interest as the shot whistled\r\nabove his head; but when he perceived his masts untouched, and the few\r\nunimportant ropes, only, that were cut, he replied to the uproar with a\r\nburst of pleasure.\r\n\r\n5. A few men were, however, seen clinging with wild frenzy to the cordage,\r\ndropping from rope to rope, like wounded birds fluttering through a tree,\r\nuntil they fell heavily into the ocean, the sullen ship sweeping by them\r\nin a cold indifference. At the next instant, the spars and masts of their\r\nenemy exhibited a display of men similar to their own, when Griffith again\r\nplaced the trumpet to his mouth, and shouted aloud, "Give it to them;\r\ndrive them from their yards, boys; scatter them with your grape; unreeve\r\ntheir rigging!"\r\n\r\n6. The crew of the American wanted but little encouragement to enter on\r\nthis experiment with hearty good will, and the close of his cheering words\r\nwas uttered amid the deafening roar of his own cannon. The Pilot had,\r\nhowever, mistaken the skill and readiness of their foe; for,\r\nnotwithstanding the disadvantageous circumstances under which the\r\nEnglishman increased his sail, the duty was steadily and dexterously\r\nperformed.\r\n\r\n7. The two ships were now running rapidly on parallel lines, hurling at\r\neach other their instruments of destruction with furious industry, and\r\nwith severe and certain loss to both, though with no manifest advantage in\r\nfavor of either. Both Griffith and the Pilot witnessed, with deep concern,\r\nthis unexpected defeat of their hopes; for they could not conceal from\r\nthemselves that each moment lessened their velocity through the water, as\r\nthe shot of the enemy stripped the canvas from the yards, or dashed aside\r\nthe lighter spars in their terrible progress.\r\n\r\n8. "We find our equal here," said Griffith to the stranger. "The ninety is\r\nheaving up again like a mountain; and if we continue to shorten sail at\r\nthis rate, she will soon be down upon us!"\r\n\r\n"You say true, sir," returned the Pilot, musing, "the man shows judgment\r\nas well as spirit; but--"\r\n\r\n9. He was interrupted by Merry, who rushed from the forward part of the\r\nvessel, his whole face betokening the eagerness of his spirit and the\r\nimportance of his intelligence.--\r\n\r\n"The breakers!" he cried, when nigh enough to be heard amid the din; "we\r\nare running dead on a ripple, and the sea is white not two hundred yards\r\nahead."\r\n\r\n10. The Pilot jumped on a gun, and, bending to catch a glimpse through the\r\nsmoke, he shouted, in those clear, piercing tones, that could be even\r\nheard among the roaring of the cannon,--\r\n\r\n"Port, port your helm! we are on the Devil\'s Grip! Pass up the trumpet,\r\nsir; port your helm, fellow; give it to them, boys--give it to the proud\r\nEnglish dogs!"\r\n\r\n11. Griffith unhesitatingly relinquished the symbol of his rank, fastening\r\nhis own firm look on the calm but quick eye of the Pilot, and gathering\r\nassurance from the high confidence he read in the countenance of the\r\nstranger. The seamen were too busy with their cannon and the rigging to\r\nregard the new danger; and the frigate entered one of the dangerous passes\r\nof the shoals, in the heat of a severely contested battle.\r\n\r\n12. The wondering looks of a few of the older sailors glanced at the\r\nsheets of foam that flew by them, in doubt whether the wild gambols of the\r\nwaves were occasioned by the shot of the enemy, when suddenly the noise of\r\ncannon was succeeded by the sullen wash of the disturbed element, and\r\npresently the vessel glided out of her smoky shroud, and was boldly\r\nsteering in the center of the narrow passages.\r\n\r\n13. For ten breathless minutes longer the Pilot continued to hold an\r\nuninterrupted sway, during which the vessel ran swiftly by ripples and\r\nbreakers, by streaks of foam and darker passages of deep water, when he\r\nthrew down his trumpet and exclaimed--\r\n\r\n"What threatened to be our destruction has proved our salvation.--Keep\r\nyonder hill crowned with wood one point open from the church tower at its\r\nbase, and steer east and by north; you will run through these shoals on\r\nthat course in an hour, and by so doing you will gain five leagues of your\r\nenemy, who will have to double their trail."\r\n\r\n14. Every officer in the ship, after the breathless suspense of\r\nuncertainty had passed, rushed to those places where a view might be taken\r\nof their enemies. The ninety was still steering boldly onward, and had\r\nalready approached the two-and-thirty, which lay a helpless wreck, rolling\r\non the unruly seas that were rudely tossing her on their wanton billows.\r\nThe frigate last engaged was running along the edge of the ripple, with\r\nher torn sails flying loosely in the air, her ragged spars tottering in\r\nthe breeze, and everything above her hull exhibiting the confusion of a\r\nsudden and unlooked-for check to her progress.\r\n\r\n15. The exulting taunts and mirthful congratulations of the seamen, as\r\nthey gazed at the English ships, were, however, soon forgotten in the\r\nattention that was required to their own vessel. The drums beat the\r\nretreat, the guns were lashed, the wounded again removed, and every\r\nindividual able to keep the deck was required to lend his assistance in\r\nrepairing the damages to the frigate, and securing her masts.\r\n\r\n16. The promised hour carried the ship safely through all the dangers,\r\nwhich were much lessened by daylight; and by the time the sun had begun to\r\nfall over the land, Griffith, who had not quitted the deck during the day,\r\nbeheld his vessel once more cleared of the confusion of the chase and\r\nbattle, and ready to meet another foe.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Frig\'ate, a war vessel, usually carrying from\r\ntwenty-eight to forty-four guns, arranged in two tiers on each side.\r\nEq\'ui-page (pro. ek\'wi-paj), furniture, fitting out. 4.

The Pilot, who appears in this story, under disguise, is John\r\nPaul Jones, a celebrated American naval officer during the Revolution. He\r\nwas born in Scotland, in 1747, and was apprenticed when only twelve years\r\nold as a sailor. He was familiar with the waters about the British\r\nIslands, and during part of the war he hovered about their coasts in a\r\ndaring way, capturing many vessels, often against heavy odds, and causing\r\ngreat terror to the enemy.\r\n\r\n8.

BURIAL OF SIR JOHN MOORE.\r\n\r\nCharles Wolfe (b. 1791, d. 1823), an Irish poet and clergyman, was born in\r\nDublin. He was educated in several schools, and graduated at the\r\nuniversity of his native city. He was ordained in 1817, and soon became\r\nnoted for his zeal and energy as a clergyman. His literary productions\r\nwere collected and published in 1825. "The Burial of Sir John Moore," one\r\nof the finest poems of its kind in the English language, was written in\r\n1817, and first appeared in the "Newry Telegraph," a newspaper, with the\r\nauthor\'s initials, but without his knowledge. Byron said of this ballad\r\nthat he would rather be the author of it than of any one ever written.\r\n\r\n1. Not a drum was heard, not a funeral note,\r\n     As his corse to the rampart we hurried;\r\n   Not a soldier discharged his farewell shot\r\n     O\'er the grave where our hero we buried.\r\n\r\n2. We buried him darkly, at dead of night,\r\n     The sods with our bayonets turning,\r\n   By the struggling moonbeam\'s misty light,\r\n     And the lantern dimly burning.\r\n\r\n3. No useless coffin inclosed his breast,\r\n     Not in sheet nor in shroud we wound him;\r\n   But he lay like a warrior taking his rest,\r\n     With his martial cloak around him.\r\n\r\n4. Few and short were the prayers we said,\r\n     And we spoke not a word of sorrow;\r\n   But we steadfastly gazed on the face of the dead\r\n     And we bitterly thought of the morrow.\r\n\r\n5. We thought, as we hollowed his narrow bed,\r\n     And smoothed down his lonely pillow,\r\n   That the foe and the stranger would tread o\'er his head,\r\n     And we far away on the billow!\r\n\r\n6. Lightly they\'ll talk of the spirit that\'s gone\r\n     And o\'er his cold ashes upbraid him;\r\n   But little he\'ll reck, if they\'ll let him sleep on\r\n     In a grave where a Briton has laid him.\r\n\r\n7. But half of our heavy task was done,\r\n     When the clock struck the hour for retiring\r\n   And we heard the distant random gun\r\n     That the foe was sullenly firing.\r\n\r\n8. Slowly and sadly we laid him down,\r\n     From the field of his fame, fresh and gory;\r\n   We carved not a line, we raised not a stone,\r\n     But we left him alone with his glory!\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--3. Mar\'tial (pro. mar\'shal), military. 6. Up-braid\', to\r\ncharge with something wrong or disgraceful, to reproach. Reck, to take\r\nheed, to care. 7. Ran\'dom, without fixed aim or purpose, left to chance.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.--Sir John Moore (b. 1761, d. 1809) was a celebrated British general.\r\nHe was appointed commander of the British forces in Spain, in the war\r\nagainst Napoleon, and fell at the battle of Corunna, by a cannon shot.\r\nMarshal Soult, the opposing French commander, caused a monument to be\r\nerected to his memory. The British government has also raised a monument\r\nto him in St. Paul\'s Cathedral, while his native city, Glasgow, honors him\r\nwith a bronze statue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCI. LITTLE VICTORIES.\r\n\r\n1. "O Mother, now that I have lost my limb, I can never be a soldier or a\r\nsailor; I can never go round the world!" And Hugh burst into tears, now\r\nmore really afflicted than he had ever been yet. His mother sat on the bed\r\nbeside him, and wiped away his tears as they flowed, while he told her, as\r\nwell as his sobs would let him, how long and how much he had reckoned on\r\ngoing round the world, and how little he cared for anything else in\r\nfuture; and now this was the very thing he should never be able to do!\r\n\r\n2. He had practiced climbing ever since he could remember, and now this\r\nwas of no use; he had practiced marching, and now he should never march\r\nagain. When he had finished his complaint, there was a pause, and his\r\nmother said,\r\n\r\n"Hugh, you have heard of Huber?"\r\n\r\n"The man who found out so lunch about bees?" said Hugh. "Bees and ants.\r\nWhen Huber had discovered more than had ever been known about these, and\r\nwhen he was sure that he could learn still more, and was more and more\r\nanxious to peep into their tiny homes and curious ways, he became blind."\r\n\r\n3. Hugh sighed, and his mother went on.\r\n\r\n"Did you ever hear of Beethoven? He was one of the greatest musical\r\ncomposers that ever lived. His great, his sole delight was in music. It\r\nwas the passion of his life. When all his time and all his mind were given\r\nto music, he suddenly became deaf, perfectly deaf; so that he never more\r\nheard one single note from the loudest orchestra. While crowds were moved\r\nand delighted with his compositions, it was all silence to him." Hugh said\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n4. "Now do you think," asked his mother--and Hugh saw that a mild and\r\ngentle smile beamed from her countenance--"do you think that these people\r\nwere without a Heavenly Parent?"\r\n\r\n"O no! but were they patient?" asked Hugh.\r\n\r\n"Yes, in their different ways and degrees. Would you suppose that they\r\nwere hardly treated? Or would you not rather suppose that their Father\r\ngave them something better to do than they had planned for themselves?"\r\n\r\n5. "He must know best, of course; but it does seem very hard that that\r\nvery thing should happen to them. Huber would not have so much minded\r\nbeing deaf, perhaps; or that musical man, being blind.\r\n\r\n"No doubt their hearts often swelled within them at their disappointments;\r\nbut I fully believe that they very soon found God\'s will to be wiser than\r\ntheir wishes. They found, if they bore their trial well, that there was\r\nwork for their hearts to do far nobler than any the head could do through\r\nthe eye or the ear. And they soon felt a new and delicious pleasure which\r\nnone but the bitterly disappointed can feel."\r\n\r\n"What is that?"\r\n\r\n6. "The pleasure of rousing the soul to bear pain, and of agreeing with\r\nGod silently, when nobody knows what is in the breast. There is no\r\npleasure like that of exercising one\'s soul in bearing pain, and of\r\nfinding one\'s heart glow with the hope that one is pleasing God."\r\n\r\n"Shall I feel that pleasure?"\r\n\r\n"Often and often, I have no doubt; every time you can willingly give up\r\nyour wish to be a soldier or a sailor, or anything else you have set your\r\nmind upon, you will feel that pleasure. But I do not expect it of you yet.\r\nI dare say it was long a bitter thing to Beethoven to see hundreds of\r\npeople in raptures with his music, when he could not hear a note of it."\r\n\r\n7. "But did he ever smile again?" asked Hugh.\r\n\r\n"If he did, he was happier than all the fine music in the world could have\r\nmade him," replied his mother.\r\n\r\n"I wonder, oh, I wonder, if I shall ever feel so!"\r\n\r\n"We will pray to God that you may. Shall we ask him now?" Hugh clasped his\r\nhands. His mother kneeled beside the bed, and, in a very few words, prayed\r\nthat Hugh might be able to bear his misfortune well, and that his friends\r\nmight give him such help and comfort as God should approve.\r\n\r\n8. Hugh found himself subject to very painful feelings sometimes, such as\r\nno one quite understood, and such as he feared no one was able to pity as\r\nthey deserved. On one occasion, when he had been quite merry for a while,\r\nand his mother and his sister Agnes were chatting, they thought they heard\r\na sob from the sofa. They spoke to Hugh, and found that he was indeed\r\ncrying bitterly.\r\n\r\n"What is it, my dear?" said his mother. "Agnes, have we said anything that\r\ncould hurt his feelings?"\r\n\r\n"No, no," sobbed Hugh. "I will tell you, presently."\r\n\r\n9. And, presently, he told them that he was so busy listening to what they\r\nsaid that he forgot everything else, when he felt as if something had\r\ngotten between two of his toes; unconsciously he put down his hand as if\r\nhis foot were there! Nothing could be plainer than the feeling in his\r\ntoes; and then, when he put out his hand, and found nothing, it was so\r\nterrible, it startled him so! It was a comfort to find that his mother\r\nknew about this. She came, and kneeled by his sofa, and told him that many\r\npersons who had lost a limb considered this the most painful thing they\r\nhad to bear for some time; but that, though the feeling would return\r\noccasionally through life, it would cease to be painful.\r\n\r\n10. Hugh was very much dejected, and when he thought of the months and\r\nyears to the end of his life, and that he should never run and play, and\r\nnever be like other people, he almost wished that he were dead.\r\n\r\nAgnes thought that he must be miserable indeed if he could venture to say\r\nthis to his mother. She glanced at her mother\'s face, but there was no\r\ndispleasure there. On the contrary, she said this feeling was very\r\nnatural. She had felt it herself under smaller misfortunes than Hugh\'s;\r\nbut she had found, though the prospect appeared all strewn with troubles,\r\nthat they came singly, and were not so hard to bear, after all.\r\n\r\n11. She told Hugh that when she was a little girl she was very lazy, fond\r\nof her bed, and not at all fond of dressing or washing.\r\n\r\n"\'Why, mother! you?" exclaimed Hugh.\r\n\r\n"Yes; that was the sort of little girl I was. Well, I was in despair, one\r\nday, at the thought that I should have to wash, and clean my teeth, and\r\nbrush my hair, and put on every article of dress, every morning, as long\r\nas I lived."\r\n\r\n"Did you tell anybody?" asked Hugh.\r\n\r\n12. "No, I was ashamed to do that; but I remember I cried. You see how it\r\nturns out. When we have become accustomed to anything, we do it without\r\never thinking of the trouble, and, as the old fable tells us, the clock\r\nthat has to tick so many millions of times, has exactly the same number of\r\nseconds to do it in. So will you find that you can move about on each\r\nseparate occasion, as you wish, and practice will enable you to do it\r\nwithout any trouble or thought."\r\n\r\n"But this is not all, nor half what I mean," said Hugh.\r\n\r\n13. "No, my dear, nor half what you will have to bear. You resolved to\r\nbear it all patiently, I remember. But what is it you dread the most?"\r\n\r\n"Oh! all manner of things. I can never do like other people."\r\n\r\n"Some things," replied his mother. "You can never play cricket, as every\r\nCrofton boy would like to do. You can never dance at your sister\'s\r\nChristmas parties."\r\n\r\n14. "O mamma!" cried Agnes, with tears in her eyes, and with the thought\r\nin her mind that it was cruel to talk so.\r\n\r\n"Go on! Go on!" cried Hugh, brightening. "You know what I feel, mother;\r\nand you don\'t keep telling me, as others do, and even sister Agnes,\r\nsometimes, that it will not signify much, and that I shall not care, and\r\nall that; making out that it is no misfortune, hardly, when I know what it\r\nis, and they don\'t. Now, then, go on, mother! What else?"\r\n\r\n15. "There will be little checks and mortifications continually, when you\r\nsee little boys leaping over this, and climbing that, and playing at the\r\nother, while you must stand out, and can only look on. And some people\r\nwill pity you in a way you will not like: and some may even laugh at you."\r\n\r\n"O mamma!" exclaimed Agnes.\r\n\r\n"Well, and what else?" said Hugh.\r\n\r\n16. "Sooner or later you will have to follow some way of life determined\r\nby this accident instead of one that you would have liked better."\r\n\r\n"Well, what else?"\r\n\r\n"I must ask you, now. I can think of nothing more; and I hope there is not\r\nmuch else; for, indeed, I think here is quite enough for a boy, or anyone\r\nelse, to bear."\r\n\r\n"I will bear it though; you will see."\r\n\r\n17. "You will find great helps. These misfortunes of themselves strengthen\r\none\'s mind. They have some advantages too. You will be a better scholar\r\nfor your lameness, I have no doubt. You will read more books, and have a\r\nmind richer in thoughts. You will be more beloved by us all, and you\r\nyourself will love God more for having given you something to bear for his\r\nsake. God himself will help you to bear your trials. You will conquer your\r\ntroubles one by one, and by a succession of LITTLE VICTORIES will at last\r\ncompletely triumph over all."\r\n                                                      --Harriet Martineau.\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1.

THE CHARACTER OF A HAPPY LIFE.\r\n\r\nSir Henry Wotton (b. 1568, d. 1639) was born at Bocton Hall, Kent,\r\nEngland. He was educated at Winchester and Oxford. About 1598 he was taken\r\ninto the service of the Earl of Essex, as one of his secretaries. On the\r\nEarl\'s committal to the Tower for treason, Wotton fled to France; but he\r\nreturned to England immediately after the death of Elizabeth, and received\r\nthe honor of knighthood. He was King James\'s favorite diplomatist, and, in\r\n1623, was appointed provost of Eton College. Wotton wrote a number of\r\nprose works; but his literary reputation rests mainly on some short poems,\r\nwhich are distinguished by a dignity of thought and expression rarely\r\nexcelled.\r\n\r\n1. How happy is he born and taught,\r\n     That serveth not another\'s will;\r\n   Whose armor is his honest thought,\r\n     And simple truth his utmost skill!\r\n\r\n2. Whose passions not his masters are,\r\n     Whose soul is still prepared for death,\r\n   Untied unto the worldly care\r\n     Of public fame, or private breath;\r\n\r\n3. Who envies none that chance doth raise,\r\n     Or vice; who never understood\r\n   How deepest wounds are given by praise;\r\n     Nor rules of state, but rules of good:\r\n\r\n4. Who hath his life from rumors freed,\r\n     Whose conscience is his strong retreat;\r\n   Whose state can neither flatterers feed,\r\n     Nor ruin make oppressors great;\r\n\r\n5. Who God doth late and early pray,\r\n     More of his grace than gifts to lend;\r\n   And entertains the harmless day\r\n     With a religious book or friend.\r\n\r\n6. This man is freed from servile bands,\r\n     Of hope to rise, or fear to fall;\r\n   Lord of himself, though not of lands;\r\n     And having nothing, yet hath all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCIII. THE ART OF DISCOURAGEMENT.\r\n\r\nArthur Helps (b. 1813, d. 1875) graduated at Cambridge, England, in 1835.\r\nHis best known works are: "Friends in Council, a Series of Readings and\r\nDiscourses," "Companions of my Solitude," and "Realmah," a tale of the\r\n"lake dwellers" in southern Europe. He has also written a "History of the\r\nSpanish Conquests in America," two historical dramas, and several other\r\nworks. Mr. Helps was a true thinker, and his writings are deservedly\r\npopular with thoughtful readers. In 1859 he was appointed secretary of the\r\nprivy council.\r\n\r\n1. Regarding, one day, in company with a humorous friend, a noble vessel\r\nof a somewhat novel construction sailing slowly out of port, he observed,\r\n"What a quantity of cold water somebody must have had down his back." In\r\nmy innocence, I supposed that he alluded to the wet work of the artisans\r\nwho had been building the vessel; but when I came to know him better, I\r\nfound that this was the form of comment he always indulged in when\r\ncontemplating any new and great work, and that his "somebody" was the\r\ndesigner of the vessel.\r\n\r\n2. My friend had carefully studied the art of discouragement, and there\r\nwas a class of men whom he designated simply as "cold-water pourers." It\r\nwas most amusing to hear him describe the lengthened sufferings of the man\r\nwho first designed a wheel; of him who first built a boat; of the\r\nadventurous personage who first proposed the daring enterprise of using\r\nbuttons, instead of fish bones, to fasten the scanty raiment of some\r\nsavage tribe.\r\n\r\n3. Warming with his theme, he would become quite eloquent in describing\r\nthe long career of discouragement which  these rash men had brought upon\r\nthemselves, and which he said, to his knowledge, must have shortened their\r\nlives. He invented imaginary dialogues between the unfortunate inventor,\r\nsay of the wheel, and his particular friend, some eminent cold-water\r\npourer. For, as he said, every man has some such friend, who fascinates\r\nhim by fear, and to whom he confides his enterprises in order to hear the\r\nworst that can be said of them.\r\n\r\n4. The sayings of the chilling friend, probably, as he observed, ran\r\nthus:--"We seem to have gone on very well for thousands of years without\r\nthis rolling thing. Your father carried burdens on his back. The king is\r\ncontent to be borne on men\'s shoulders. The high priest is not too proud\r\nto do the same. Indeed, I question whether it is not irreligious to\r\nattempt to shift from men\'s shoulders their natural burdens.\r\n\r\n5. "Then, as to its succeeding,--for my part, I see no chance of that. How\r\ncan it go up hill? How often you have failed before in other fanciful\r\nthings of the same nature! Besides, you are losing your time; and the yams\r\nabout your hut are only half planted. You will be a beggar; and it is my\r\nduty, as a friend, to tell you so plainly.\r\n\r\n6. "There was Nang-chung: what became of him? We had found fire for ages,\r\nin a proper way, taking a proper time about it, by rubbing two sticks\r\ntogether. He must needs strike out fire at once, with iron and flint; and\r\ndid he die in his bed? Our sacred lords saw the impiety of that\r\nproceeding, and very justly impaled the man who imitated heavenly powers.\r\nAnd, even if you could succeed with this new and absurd rolling thing, the\r\nstate would be ruined. What would become of those who carry burdens on\r\ntheir backs? Put aside the vain fancies of a childish mind, and finish the\r\nplanting of your yams."\r\n\r\n7. It is really very curious to observe how, even in modern times, the\r\narts of discouragement prevail. There are men whose sole pretense to\r\nwisdom consists in administering discouragement. They are never at a loss.\r\nThey are equally ready to prophesy, with wonderful ingenuity, all possible\r\nvarieties of misfortune to any enterprise that may be proposed; and when\r\nthe thing is produced, and has met with some success, to find a flaw in\r\nit.\r\n\r\n8. I once saw a work of art produced in the presence of an eminent\r\ncold-water pourer. He did not deny that it was beautiful; but he instantly\r\nfastened upon a small crack in it that nobody had observed; and upon that\r\ncrack he would dilate whenever the work was discussed in his presence.\r\nIndeed, he did not see the work, but only the crack in it. That\r\nflaw,--that little flaw,--was all in all to him.\r\n\r\n9. The cold-water pourers are not all of one form of mind. Some are led to\r\nindulge in this recreation from genuine timidity. They really do fear that\r\nall new attempts will fail. Others are simply envious and ill-natured.\r\nThen, again, there is a sense of power and wisdom in prophesying evil.\r\nMoreover, it is the safest thing to prophesy, for hardly anything at first\r\nsucceeds exactly in the way that it was intended to succeed.\r\n\r\n10. Again, there is the lack of imagination which gives rise to the\r\nutterance of so much discouragement. For an ordinary man, it must have\r\nbeen a great mental strain to grasp the ideas of the first projectors of\r\nsteam and gas, electric telegraphs, and pain-deadening chloroform. The\r\ninventor is always, in the eyes of his fellow-men, somewhat of a madman;\r\nand often they do their best to make him so.\r\n\r\n11. Again, there is the want of sympathy; and that is, perhaps, the ruling\r\ncause in most men\'s minds who have given themselves up to discourage. They\r\nare not tender enough, or sympathetic enough, to appreciate all the pain\r\nthey are giving, when, in a dull plodding way, they lay out argument after\r\nargument to show that the project which the poor inventor has set his\r\nheart upon, and upon which, perhaps, he has staked his fortune, will not\r\nsucceed.\r\n\r\n12. But what inventors suffer, is only a small part of what mankind in\r\ngeneral endure from thoughtless and unkind discouragement. Those\r\nhigh-souled men belong to the suffering class, and must suffer; but it is\r\nin daily life that the wear and tear of discouragement tells so much.\r\nPropose a small party of pleasure to an apt discourager, and see what he\r\nwill make of it. It soon becomes sicklied over with doubt and despondency;\r\nand, at last, the only hope of the proposer is, that his proposal, when\r\nrealized, will not be an ignominious failure. All hope of pleasure, at\r\nleast for the proposer, has long been out of the question.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--2. Des\'ig-nat-ed, called by a distinctive title, named. 5.\r\nYam, the root of a climbing plant, found in the tropics, which is used for\r\nfood. 6. Im-paled\', put to death by being fixed on an upright, sharp\r\nstake. 8. Di-late\', to speak largely, to dwell in narration. 10. Rise\r\n(pro. ris, not riz), source, origin. Pro-jec\'tor, one who forms a scheme\r\nor design.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCIV. THE MARINER\'S DREAM.\r\n\r\nWilliam Dimond (b. 1780, d. 1837) was a dramatist and poet, living at\r\nBath, England, where he was born and received his education. He afterwards\r\nstudied for the bar in London. His literary productions are for the most\r\npart dramas, but he has also written a number of poems, among them the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n1. In slumbers of midnight the sailor boy lay;\r\n     His hammock swung loose at the sport of the wind;\r\n   But watch-worn and weary, his cares flew away,\r\n     And visions of happiness danced o\'er his mind.\r\n\r\n2. He dreamed of his home, of his dear native bowers,\r\n     And pleasures that waited on life\'s merry morn;\r\n   While Memory each scene gayly covered with flowers,\r\n     And restored every rose, but secreted the thorn.\r\n\r\n3. Then Fancy her magical pinions spread wide,\r\n     And bade the young dreamer in ecstasy rise;\r\n   Now, far, far behind him the green waters glide,\r\n     And the cot of his forefathers blesses his eyes.\r\n\r\n4. The jessamine clambers in flowers o\'er the thatch,\r\n     And the swallow chirps sweet from her nest in the wall;\r\n   All trembling with transport, he raises the latch,\r\n     And the voices of loved ones reply to his call.\r\n\r\n5. A father bends o\'er him with looks of delight;\r\n     His cheek is impearled with a mother\'s warm tear;\r\n   And the lips of the boy in a love kiss unite\r\n     With the lips of the maid whom his bosom holds dear.\r\n\r\n6. The heart of the sleeper beats high in his breast;\r\n     Joy quickens his pulses,--all his hardships seem o\'er;\r\n   And a murmur of happiness steals through his rest,--\r\n     "O God! thou hast blest me,--I ask for no more."\r\n\r\n7. Ah! whence is that flame which now bursts on his eye?\r\n     Ah! what is that sound that now \'larums his ear?\r\n   \'T is the lightning\'s red glare painting hell on the sky!\r\n     \'T is the crashing of thunders, the groan of the sphere!\r\n\r\n8. He springs from his hammock,--he flies to the deck;\r\n     Amazement confronts him with images dire;\r\n   Wild winds and mad waves drive the vessel a wreck;\r\n     The masts fly in splinters; the shrouds are on fire.\r\n\r\n9. Like mountains the billows tremendously swell;\r\n     In vain the lost wretch calls on Mercy to save;\r\n   Unseen hands of spirits are ringing his knell,\r\n     And the death angel flaps his broad wings o\'er the wave!\r\n\r\n10. O sailor boy, woe to thy dream of delight!\r\n      In darkness dissolves the gay frostwork of bliss!\r\n    Where now is the picture that Fancy touched bright,--\r\n      Thy parents\' fond pressure, and love\'s honeyed kiss?\r\n\r\n11. O sailor boy! sailor boy! never again\r\n      Shall home, love, or kindred, thy wishes repay;\r\n    Unblessed and unhonored, down deep in the main,\r\n      Full many a fathom, thy frame shall decay.\r\n\r\n12. No tomb shall e\'er plead to remembrance for thee,\r\n      Or redeem form or fame from the merciless surge;\r\n    But the white foam of waves shall thy winding sheet be,\r\n      And winds in the midnight of winter thy dirge.\r\n\r\n13. On a bed of green sea flowers thy limbs shall be laid,--\r\n      Around thy white bones the red coral shall grow;\r\n    Of thy fair yellow locks threads of amber be made,\r\n      And every part suit to thy mansion below.\r\n\r\n14. Days, months, years, and ages shall circle away,\r\n      And still the vast waters above thee shall roll;\r\n    Earth loses thy pattern forever and aye;\r\n      O sailor boy! sailor boy! peace to thy soul!\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Ham\'mock, a hanging or swinging bed, usu-ally made of\r\nnetting or hempen cloth. 4. Trans\'port, ecstasy, rapture. 5. Im-pearled\'\r\n(pro. im-perled\'), decorated with pearls, or with things resembling\r\npearls. 7. \'Lar\'ums (an abbreviation of alarums, for alarms), affrights,\r\nterrifies. 12. Dirge, funeral music.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--13. Coral is the solid part of a minute sea animal, corresponding\r\nto the bones in other animals. It grows in many fantastic shapes, and is\r\nof various colors.\r\n\r\nAmber is a yellow resin, and is the fossilized gum of buried trees. It is\r\nmined in several localities in Europe and America; it is also found along\r\nthe seacoast, washed up by the waves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCV. THE PASSENGER PIGEON.\r\n\r\nJohn James Audubon (b. 1780, d. 1851). This celebrated American\r\nornithologist was born in Louisiana. When quite young he was passionately\r\nfond of birds, and took delight in studying their habits. In 1797 his\r\nfather, an admiral in the French navy, sent him to Paris to be educated.\r\nOn his return to America, he settled on a farm in eastern Pennsylvania,\r\nbut afterward removed to Henderson, Ky., where he resided several years,\r\nsupporting his family by trade, but devoting most of his time to the\r\npursuit of his favorite study. In 1826 he went to England, and commenced\r\nthe publication of the "Birds of America," which consists of ten\r\nvolumes--five of engravings of birds, natural size, and five of\r\nletterpress. Cuvier declares this work to be "the most magnificent\r\nmonument that art has ever erected to ornithology." In 1830 Audubon\r\nreturned to America, and soon afterwards made excursions into nearly every\r\nsection of the United States and Canada. A popular edition of his great\r\nwork was published, in seven volumes, in 1844, and "The Quadrupeds of\r\nAmerica," in six volumes,--three of plates and three of letterpress, in\r\n1846-50. He removed to the vicinity of New York about 1840, and resided\r\nthere until his death.\r\n\r\n1. The multitudes of wild pigeons in our woods are astonishing. Indeed,\r\nafter having viewed them so often, and under so many circumstances, I even\r\nnow feel inclined to pause and assure myself that what I am going to\r\nrelate is a fact. Yet I have seen it all, and that, too, in the company of\r\npersons who, like myself, were struck with amazement.\r\n\r\n2. In the autumn of 1813 I left my house at Henderson, on the banks of the\r\nOhio, on my way to Louisville. In passing over the Barrens, a few miles\r\nbeyond Hardinsburgh, I observed the pigeons flying, from northeast to\r\nsouthwest, in greater numbers than I thought I had ever seen them before,\r\nand feeling an inclination to count the flocks that might pass within the\r\nreach of my eye in one hour, I dismounted, seated myself on an eminence,\r\nand began to mark with my pencil, making a dot for every flock that\r\npassed.\r\n\r\n3. In a short time, finding the task which I had undertaken impracticable,\r\nas the birds poured in in countless multitudes, I rose, and, counting the\r\ndots then put down, found that one hundred and sixty-three had been made\r\nin twenty-one minutes. I traveled on, and still met more the farther I\r\nproceeded. The air was literally filled with pigeons; the light of noonday\r\nwas obscured as by an eclipse; and the continued buzz of wings had a\r\ntendency to lull my senses to repose.\r\n\r\n4. Whilst waiting for dinner at Young\'s inn, at the confluence of Salt\r\nRiver with the Ohio, I saw, at my leisure, immense legions still going by,\r\nwith a front reaching far beyond the Ohio on the west, and the beech wood\r\nforests directly on the east of me. Not a single bird alighted, for not a\r\nnut or acorn was that year to be seen in the neighborhood. They\r\nconsequently flew so high that different trials to reach them with a\r\ncapital rifle proved ineffectual; nor did the reports disturb them in the\r\nleast.\r\n\r\n5. I can not describe to you the extreme beauty of their aerial evolutions\r\nwhen a hawk chanced to press upon the rear of a flock. At once, like a\r\ntorrent, and with a noise like thunder, they rushed into a compact mass,\r\npressing upon each other towards the center. In these almost solid masses,\r\nthey darted forward in undulating and angular lines, descended and swept\r\nclose over the earth with inconceivable velocity, mounted perpendicularly\r\nso as to resemble a vast column, and, when high, were seen wheeling and\r\ntwisting within their continued lines, which then resembled the coils of a\r\ngigantic serpent.\r\n\r\n6. As soon as the pigeons discover a sufficiency of food to entice them to\r\nalight, they fly round in circles, reviewing the country below. During\r\ntheir evolutions, on such occasions, the dense mass which they form\r\nexhibits a beautiful appearance, as it changes its direction, now\r\ndisplaying a glistening sheet of azure, when the backs of the birds come\r\nsimultaneously into view, and anon suddenly presenting a mass of rich,\r\ndeep purple.\r\n\r\n7. They then pass lower, over the woods, and for a moment are lost among\r\nthe foliage, but again emerge, and are seen gliding aloft. They now\r\nalight; but the next moment, as if suddenly alarmed, they take to wing,\r\nproducing by the flappings of their wings a noise like the roar of distant\r\nthunder, and sweep through the forests to see if danger is near. Hunger,\r\nhowever, soon brings them to the ground.\r\n\r\n8. When alighted, they are seen industriously throwing up the withered\r\nleaves in quest of the fallen mast. The rear ranks are continually rising,\r\npassing over the main body, and alighting in front, in such rapid\r\nsuccession, that the whole flock seems still on wing. The quantity of\r\nground thus swept is astonishing; and so completely has it been cleared\r\nthat the gleaner who might follow in their rear would find his labor\r\ncompletely lost.\r\n\r\n9. On such occasions, when the woods are filled with these pigeons, they\r\nare killed in immense numbers, although no apparent diminution ensues.\r\nAbout the middle of the day, after their repast is finished, they settle\r\non the trees to enjoy rest and digest their food. As the sun begins to\r\nsink beneath the horizon; they depart en masse for the roosting place,\r\nwhich not unfrequently is hundreds of miles distant, as has been\r\nascertained by persons who have kept an account of their arrivals and\r\ndepartures.\r\n\r\n10. Let us now inspect their place of nightly rendezvous. One of these\r\ncurious roosting places, on the banks of the Green River, in Kentucky, I\r\nrepeatedly visited. It was, as is always the case, in a portion of the\r\nforest where the trees were of great magnitude, and where there was little\r\nunderwood. I rode through it upwards of forty miles, and, crossing it in\r\ndifferent parts, found its average breadth to be rather more than three\r\nmiles. My first view of it was about a fortnight subsequent to the period\r\nwhen they had made choice of it, and I arrived there nearly two hours\r\nbefore sunset.\r\n\r\n11. Many trees, two feet in diameter, I observed, were broken off at no\r\ngreat distance from the ground; and the branches of many of the largest\r\nand tallest had given way, as if the forest had been swept by a tornado.\r\nEverything proved to me that the number of birds resorting to this part of\r\nthe forest must be immense beyond conception.\r\n\r\n12. As the period of their arrival approached, their foes anxiously\r\nprepared to receive them. Some were furnished with iron pots containing\r\nsulphur, others with torches of pine knots, many with poles, and the rest\r\nwith guns. The sun was lost to our view, yet not a pigeon had arrived.\r\nEverything was ready, and all eyes were gazing on the clear sky, which\r\nappeared in glimpses amidst the tall trees. Suddenly there burst forth the\r\ngeneral cry of, "Here they come!"\r\n\r\n13. The noise which they made, though yet distant, reminded me of a hard\r\ngale at sea passing through the rigging of a close-reefed vessel. As the\r\nbirds arrived and passed over me, I felt a current of air that surprised\r\nme. Thousands were soon knocked down by the pole men. The birds continued\r\nto pour in. The fires were lighted, and a magnificent as well as wonderful\r\nand almost terrifying sight presented itself.\r\n\r\n14. The pigeons, arriving by thousands, alighted everywhere, one above\r\nanother, until solid masses, as large as hogsheads, were formed on the\r\nbranches all round. Here and there the perches gave way under the weight\r\nwith a crash, and falling to the ground destroyed hundreds of the birds\r\nbeneath, forcing down the dense groups with which every stick was loaded.\r\nIt was a scene of uproar and confusion. I found it quite useless to speak\r\nor even to shout to those persons who were nearest to me. Even the reports\r\nof the guns were seldom heard, and I was made aware of the firing only by\r\nseeing the shooters reloading.\r\n\r\n15. The uproar continued the whole night; and as I was anxious to know to\r\nwhat distance the sound reached, I sent off a man, accustomed to\r\nperambulate the forest, who, returning two hours afterwards, informed me\r\nhe had heard it distinctly when three miles distant from the spot. Towards\r\nthe approach of day, the noise in some measure subsided; long before\r\nobjects were distinguishable, the pigeons began to move off in a direction\r\nquite different from that in which they had arrived the evening before,\r\nand at sunrise all that were able to fly had disappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--5. A-e\'ri-al, belonging or pertaining to the air. 6. A-non\',\r\nin a short time, soon. 8. Mast, the fruit of oak and beech or other forest\r\ntrees. 10. Ren\'dez-vous  (pro. ren\'de-voo), an appointed or customary\r\nplace of meeting. Sub\'se-quent, following in time. 15. Per-am\'bu-late, to\r\nwalk through.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--The wild pigeon, in common with almost every variety of game, is\r\nbecoming more scarce throughout the country each year; and Audubon\'s\r\naccount, but for the position he holds, would in time, no doubt, be\r\nconsidered ridiculous.\r\n\r\n9. En masse (pro. aN mas), a French phrase meaning in a body.\r\n\r\n[Transcriber\'s note: The last Passenger Pigeon died at the Cincinnati Zoo\r\non September 1, 1914. Population estimates  ranged up to 5 billion,\r\ncomprising 40% of the total number of birds in North America in the 19th\r\ncentury.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCVI. THE COUNTRY LIFE.\r\n\r\nRichard Henry Stoddard (b. 1825,--) was born at Hingham, Mass., but\r\nremoved to New York City while quite young. His first volume of poems,\r\n"Foot-prints," appeared in 1849, and has been followed by many others. Of\r\nthese may be mentioned "Songs of Summer," "Town and Country," "The King\'s\r\nBell," "Abraham Lincoln" (an ode), and the "Book of the East," from the\r\nlast of which the following selection is abridged. Mr. Stoddard\'s verses\r\nare full of genuine feeling, and some of them show great poetic power.\r\n\r\n1. Not what we would, but what we must,\r\n     Makes up the sum of living:\r\n   Heaven is both more and less than just,\r\n     In taking and in giving.\r\n   Swords cleave to hands that sought the plow,\r\n   And laurels miss the soldier\'s brow.\r\n\r\n2. Me, whom the city holds, whose feet\r\n     Have worn its stony highways,\r\n   Familiar with its loneliest street,--\r\n     Its ways were never my ways.\r\n   My cradle was beside the sea,\r\n   And there, I hope, my grave will be.\r\n\r\n3. Old homestead! in that old gray town\r\n     Thy vane is seaward blowing;\r\n   Thy slip of garden stretches down\r\n     To where the tide is flowing;\r\n   Below they lie, their sails all furled,\r\n   The ships that go about the world.\r\n\r\n4. Dearer that little country house,\r\n     Inland with pines beside it;\r\n   Some peach trees, with unfruitful boughs,\r\n     A well, with weeds to hide it:\r\n   No flowers, or only such as rise\r\n   Self-sown--poor things!--which all despise.\r\n\r\n5. Dear country home! can I forget\r\n     The least of thy sweet trifles?\r\n   The window vines that clamber yet,\r\n     Whose blooms the bee still rifles?\r\n   The roadside blackberries, growing ripe,\r\n   And in the woods the Indian pipe?\r\n\r\n6. Happy the man who tills his field,\r\n     Content with rustic labor;\r\n   Earth does to him her fullness yield,\r\n     Hap what may to his neighbor.\r\n   Well days, sound nights--oh, can there be\r\n   A life more rational and free?\r\n\r\nNOTE.--5. The Indian pipe is a little, white plant, bearing a white,\r\nbell-shaped flower.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCVII. THE VIRGINIANS.\r\n\r\nWilliam Makepeace Thackeray (b. 1811, d. 1863). This popular English\r\nhumorist, essayist, and novelist was born in Calcutta. He was educated at\r\nthe Charterhouse school in London, and at Cambridge, but he did not\r\ncomplete a collegiate course of study. He began his literary career as a\r\ncontributor to "Fraser\'s Magazine," under the assumed name of Michael\r\nAngelo Titmarsh, and afterwards contributed to the column of "Punch." The\r\nfirst novel published under Thackeray\'s own name was "Vanity Fair," which\r\nis regarded by many as his greatest work. He afterwards wrote a large\r\nnumber of novels, tales, and poems, most of which were illustrated by\r\nsketches drawn by himself. His course of "Lectures on the English\r\nHumorists" was delivered in London in 1851, and the following year in\r\nseveral cities in the United States. He revisited the United States in\r\n1856, and delivered a course of lectures on "The Four Georges," which he\r\nrepeated in Great Britain soon after his return home. In 1860 he became\r\nthe editor of "The Cornhill Magazine," the most successful serial ever\r\npublished in England.\r\n\r\n1. Mr. Esmond called his American house Castlewood, from the patrimonial\r\nhome in the old country. The whole usages of Virginia, indeed, were fondly\r\nmodeled after the English customs. It was a loyal colony. The Virginians\r\nboasted that King Charles the Second had been king in Virginia before he\r\nhad been king in England. English king and English church were alike\r\nfaithfully honored there.\r\n\r\n2. The resident gentry were allied to good English families. They held\r\ntheir heads above the Dutch traders of New York, and the money-getting\r\nRoundheads of Pennsylvania and New England. Never were people less\r\nrepublican than those of the great province which was soon to be foremost\r\nin the memorable revolt against the British Crown.\r\n\r\n3. The gentry of Virginia dwelt on their great lands after a fashion\r\nalmost patriarchal. For its rough cultivation, each estate had a multitude\r\nof hands--of purchased and assigned servants--who were subject to the\r\ncommand of the master. The land yielded their food, live stock, and game.\r\n\r\n4. The great rivers swarmed with fish for the taking. From their banks the\r\npassage home was clear. Their ships took the tobacco off their private\r\nwharves on the banks of the Potomac or the James River, and carried it to\r\nLondon or Bristol,--bringing back English goods and articles of home\r\nmanufacture in return for the only produce which the Virginian gentry\r\nchose to cultivate.\r\n\r\n5. Their hospitality was boundless. No stranger was ever sent away from\r\ntheir gates. The gentry received one another, and traveled to each other\'s\r\nhouses, in a state almost feudal. The question of slavery was not born at\r\nthe time of which we write. To be the proprietor of black servants shocked\r\nthe feelings of no Virginia gentleman; nor, in truth, was the despotism\r\nexercised over the negro race generally a savage one. The food was plenty:\r\nthe poor black people lazy and not unhappy. You might have preached negro\r\nemancipation to Madam Esmond of Castlewood as you might have told her to\r\nlet the horses run loose out of the stables; she had no doubt but that the\r\nwhip and the corn bag were good for both.\r\n\r\n6. Her father may have thought otherwise, being of a skeptical turn on\r\nvery many points, but his doubts did not break forth in active denial, and\r\nhe was rather disaffected than rebellious, At one period, this gentleman\r\nhad taken a part in active life at home, and possibly might have been\r\neager to share its rewards; but in latter days he did not seem to care for\r\nthem. A something had occurred in his life, which had cast a tinge of\r\nmelancholy over all his existence.\r\n\r\n7. He was not unhappy,--to those about him most kind,--most affectionate,\r\nobsequious even to the women of his family, whom he scarce ever\r\ncontradicted; but there had been some bankruptcy of his heart, which his\r\nspirit never recovered. He submitted to life, rather than enjoyed it, and\r\nnever was in better spirits than in his last hours when he was going to\r\nlay it down.\r\n\r\n8. When the boys\' grandfather died, their mother, in great state,\r\nproclaimed her eldest son George her successor and heir of the estate; and\r\nHarry, George\'s younger brother by half an hour, was always enjoined to\r\nrespect his senior. All the household was equally instructed to pay him\r\nhonor; the negroes, of whom there was a large and happy family, and the\r\nassigned servants from Europe, whose lot was made as bearable as it might\r\nbe under the government of the lady of Castlewood.\r\n\r\n9. In the whole family there scarcely was a rebel save Mrs. Esmond\'s\r\nfaithful friend and companion, Madam Mountain, and Harry\'s foster mother,\r\na faithful negro woman, who never could be made to understand why her\r\nchild should not be first, who was handsomer, and stronger, and cleverer\r\nthan his brother, as she vowed; though, in truth, there was scarcely any\r\ndifference in the beauty, strength, or stature of the twins.\r\n\r\n10. In disposition, they were in many points exceedingly unlike; but in\r\nfeature they resembled each other so closely, that, but for the color of\r\ntheir hair, it had been difficult to distinguish them. In their beds, and\r\nwhen their heads were covered with those vast, ribboned nightcaps, which\r\nour great and little ancestors wore, it was scarcely possible for any but\r\na nurse or a mother to tell the one from the other child.\r\n\r\n11. Howbeit, alike in form, we have said that they differed in temper. The\r\nelder was peaceful, studious, and silent; the younger was warlike and\r\nnoisy. He was quick at learning when he began, but very slow at beginning.\r\nNo threats of the ferule would provoke Harry to learn in an idle fit, or\r\nwould prevent George from helping his brother in his lesson. Harry was of\r\na strong military turn, drilled the little negroes on the estate, and\r\ncaned them like a corporal, having many good boxing matches with them, and\r\nnever bearing malice if he was worsted;--whereas George was sparing of\r\nblows, and gentle with all about him.\r\n\r\n12. As the custom in all families was, each of the boys had a special\r\nlittle servant assigned him: and it was a known fact that George, finding\r\nhis little wretch of a blackamoor asleep on his master\'s bed, sat down\r\nbeside it, and brushed the flies off the child with a feather fan, to the\r\nhorror of old Gumbo, the child\'s father, who found his young master so\r\nengaged, and to the indignation of Madam Esmond, who ordered the young\r\nnegro off to the proper officer for a whipping. In vain George implored\r\nand entreated--burst into passionate tears, and besought a remission of\r\nthe sentence. His mother was inflexible regarding the young rebel\'s\r\npunishment, and the little negro went off beseeching his young master not\r\nto cry.\r\n\r\n13. On account of a certain apish drollery and humor which exhibited\r\nitself in the lad, and a liking for some of the old man\'s pursuits, the\r\nfirst of the twins was the grandfather\'s favorite and companion, and would\r\nlaugh and talk out all his infantine heart to the old gentleman, to whom\r\nthe younger had seldom a word to say.\r\n\r\n14. George was a demure, studious boy, and his senses seemed to brighten\r\nup in the library, where his brother was so gloomy. He knew the books\r\nbefore he could well-nigh carry them, and read in them long before he\r\ncould understand them. Harry, on the other hand, was all alive in the\r\nstables or in the wood, eager for all parties of hunting and fishing, and\r\npromised to be a good sportsman from a very early age.\r\n\r\n15. At length the time came when Mr. Esmond was to have done with the\r\naffairs of this life, and he laid them down as if glad to be rid of their\r\nburden. All who read and heard that discourse, wondered where Parson\r\nBroadbent of James Town found the eloquence and the Latin which adorned\r\nit. Perhaps Mr. Dempster knew, the boys\' Scotch tutor, who corrected the\r\nproofs of the oration, which was printed, by the desire of his Excellency\r\nand many persons of honor, at Mr. Franklin\'s press in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n16. No such sumptuous funeral had ever bean seen in the country as that\r\nwhich Madam Esmond Warrington ordained for her father, who would have been\r\nthe first to smile at that pompous grief.\r\n\r\n17. The little lads of Castlewood, almost smothered in black trains and\r\nhatbands, headed the procession and were followed by my Lord Fairfax, from\r\nGreenway Court, by his Excellency the Governor of Virginia (with his\r\ncoach), by the Randolphs, the Careys, the Harrisons, the Washingtons, and\r\nmany others; for the whole country esteemed the departed gentleman, whose\r\ngoodness, whose high talents, whose benevolence and unobtrusive urbanity,\r\nhad earned for him the just respect of his neighbors. 18. When informed of\r\nthe event, the family of Colonel Esmond\'s stepson, the Lord Castlewood of\r\nHampshire in England, asked to be at the charges of the marble slab which\r\nrecorded the names and virtues of his lordship\'s mother and her husband;\r\nand after due time of preparation, the monument was set up, exhibiting the\r\narms and coronet of the Esmonds, supported by a little, chubby group of\r\nweeping cherubs, and reciting an epitaph which for once did not tell any\r\nfalsehoods.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINTIONS.--1. Pat-ri-mo\'ni-al, inherited from ancestors. 6.\r\nDis-af-fect\'ed, discouraged. 7. Ob-se\'qui-ous, compliant to excess. 12.\r\nBlack\'a-moor, a negro. 17. Ur-ban\'i-ty, civility or courtesy of manners,\r\nrefinement. 18. Ep\'i-taph (pro. ep\'i-taf), an inscription on a monument,\r\nin honor or in memory of the dead.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--2. Roundhead was the epithet applied to the Puritans by the\r\nCavaliers in the time of Charles I. It arose from the practice among the\r\nPuritans of cropping their hair peculiarly.\r\n\r\n3. Patriarchal. 5. Feudal. The Jewish patriarch, in olden times, and the\r\nhead of a noble family in Europe, during the Middle Ages, when the "Feudal\r\nSystem," as it is called, existed, both held almost despotic sway, the one\r\nover his great number of descendants and relations, and the other over a\r\nvast body of   subjects or retainers. Both patriarch and feudal lord were\r\nless restricted than the modern king, and the feudal lord, especially,\r\nlived in a state of great magnificence.\r\n\r\n15. Proofs. When matter is to be printed, a rough impression of it is\r\ntaken as soon as the type is set up, and sent to the editor or some other\r\nauthority for correction. These first sheets are called proofs.\r\n\r\n"His Excellency" was the title applied to the governor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCVIII. MINOT\'S LEDGE.\r\n\r\nFitz-James O\'Brien (b. 1828, d. 1862) was of Irish birth, and came to\r\nAmerica in 1852. He has contributed a number of tales and poems to various\r\nperiodicals, but his writings have never been collected in book form. Mr.\r\nO\'Brien belonged to the New York Seventh Regiment, and died at Baltimore\r\nof a wound received in a cavalry skirmish.\r\n\r\n1. Like spectral hounds across the sky,\r\n     The white clouds scud before the storm;\r\n   And naked in the howling night\r\n     The red-eyed lighthouse lifts its form.\r\n   The waves with slippery fingers clutch\r\n     The massive tower, and climb and fall,\r\n   And, muttering, growl with baffled rage\r\n     Their curses on the sturdy wall.\r\n\r\n2. Up in the lonely tower he sits,\r\n     The keeper of the crimson light:\r\n   Silent and awe-struck does he hear\r\n     The imprecations of the night.\r\n   The white spray beats against the panes\r\n     Like some wet ghost that down the air\r\n   Is hunted by a troop of fiends,\r\n     And seeks a shelter anywhere.\r\n\r\n3. He prays aloud, the lonely man,\r\n     For every soul that night at sea,\r\n   But more than all for that brave boy\r\n     Who used to gayly climb his knee,--\r\n   Young Charlie, with his chestnut hair,\r\n     And hazel eyes, and laughing lip.\r\n   "May Heaven look down," the old man cries.\r\n     "Upon my son, and on his ship!"\r\n\r\n4. While thus with pious heart he prays,\r\n     Far in the distance sounds a boom:\r\n   He pauses; and again there rings\r\n     That sullen thunder through the room.\r\n   A ship upon the shoals to-night!\r\n     She cannot hold for one half hour;\r\n   But clear the ropes and grappling hooks,\r\n     And trust in the Almighty Power!\r\n\r\n5. On the drenched gallery he stands,\r\n     Striving to pierce the solid night:\r\n   Across the sea the red eye throws\r\n     A steady crimson wake of light;\r\n   And, where it falls upon the waves,\r\n     He sees a human head float by,\r\n   With long drenched curls of chestnut hair,\r\n     And wild but fearless hazel eye.\r\n\r\n6. Out with the hooks! One mighty fling!\r\n     Adown the wind the long rope curls.\r\n   Oh! will it catch? Ah, dread suspense!\r\n     While the wild ocean wilder whirls.\r\n   A steady pull; it tightens now:\r\n     Oh! his old heart will burst with joy,\r\n   As on the slippery rocks he pulls\r\n     The breathing body of his boy.\r\n\r\n7. Still sweep the specters through the sky;\r\n     Still scud the clouds before the storm;\r\n   Still naked in the howling night\r\n     The red-eyed lighthouse lifts its form.\r\n   Without, the world is wild with rage;\r\n     Unkenneled demons are abroad;\r\n   But with the father and the son\r\n     Within, there is the peace of God.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--Minot\'s Ledge (also called the "Cohasset Rocks") is a dangerous\r\nreef in Boston Harbor, eight miles southwest of Boston Light. It has a\r\nfixed light of its own, sixty-six feet high.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCIX. HAMLET.\r\n\r\nWilliam Shakespeare (b. 1564, d. 1616), by many regarded as the greatest\r\npoet the world has ever produced, was born at Stratford-upon-Avon,\r\nEngland. He was married, when very young, to a woman eight years his\r\nsenior, went to London, was joint proprietor of Blackfriar\'s Theater in\r\n1589, wrote poems and plays, was an actor, accumulated some property, and\r\nretired to Stratford three or four years before his death. He was buried\r\nin Stratford church, where a monument has been erected to his memory. This\r\nis all that is known of him with any degree of certainty.\r\n\r\nShakespeare\'s works consist chiefly of plays and sonnets. They show a\r\nwonderful knowledge of human nature, expressed in language remarkable for\r\nits point and beauty.\r\n\r\n(ACT I, SCENE II. HAMLET alone in a room, of the castle.\r\nEnter HORATIO, MARCELLUS, and BERNARDO.)\r\n\r\nHor. Hail, to your lordship!\r\n\r\nHam.                         I am glad to see you well:\r\n     Horatio,--or I do forgot myself.\r\n\r\nHor. The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.\r\n\r\nHam. Sir, my good friend; I\'ll change that name with you:\r\n     And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio?--\r\n     Macellus?\r\n\r\nMar.             My good lord--\r\n\r\nHam. I am very glad to see you. [To Ber.] Good even, sir.\r\n     But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?\r\n\r\nHor. A truant disposition, good my lord.\r\n\r\nHam. I would not hear your enemy say so,\r\n     Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,\r\n     To make it truster of your own report\r\n     Against yourself: I knew you are no truant.\r\n     But what is your affair in Elsinore?\r\n     We\'ll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.\r\n\r\nHor. My lord, I came to see your father\'s funeral.\r\n\r\nHam. I pray thee, do not mock me, follow-student;\r\n     I think it was to see my mother\'s wedding.\r\n\r\nHor. Indeed, my lord, it followed hard upon.\r\n\r\nHam. Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats\r\n     Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.\r\n     Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven\r\n     Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!\r\n     My father!--methinks I see my father.\r\n\r\nHor. Where, my lord?\r\n\r\nHam.    In my mind\'s eye, Horatio.\r\n\r\nHor. I saw him once; he was a goodly king.\r\n\r\nHam. He was a man, take him for all in all,\r\n     I shall not look upon his like again.\r\n\r\nHor. My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.\r\n\r\nHam. Saw? who?\r\n\r\nHor. My lord, the king your father.\r\n\r\nHam.    The king my father!\r\n\r\nHor. Season your admiration for a while\r\n     With an attent ear, till I may deliver,\r\n     Upon the witness of these gentlemen,\r\n     This marvel to you.\r\n\r\nHam.    For God\'s love, let me hear.\r\n\r\nHor. Two nights together had these gentlemen,\r\n     Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,\r\n     In the dead vast and middle of the night,\r\n     Been thus encounter\'d. A figure like your father,\r\n     Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pie.\r\n     Appears before them, and with solemn march\r\n     Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk\'d\r\n     By their oppress\'d and fear-surprised eyes,\r\n     Within his trucheon\'s length; whilst they, distill\'d\r\n     Almost to jelly with the act of fear,\r\n     Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me\r\n     In dreadful secrecy impart they did;\r\n     And I with them the third night kept the watch:\r\n     Where, as they had deliver\'d, both in time,\r\n     Form of the thing, each word made true and good,\r\n     The apparition comes: I knew your father;\r\n     These hands are not more like.\r\n\r\nHam.                    But where was this?\r\n\r\nMar. My lord, upon the platform where we watch\'d.\r\n\r\nHam. Did you speak to it?\r\n\r\nHor.                    My lord, I did;\r\n     But answer made it none: yet once methought\r\n     It lifted up its head and did address\r\n     Itself to motion, like as it would speak;\r\n     But even then the morning cock crew loud,\r\n     And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,\r\n     And vanish\'d from our sight.\r\n\r\nHam.                    \'T is very strange.\r\n\r\nHor. As I do live, my honor\'d lord, \'t is true;\r\n     And we did think it writ down in our duty\r\n     To let you know of it.\r\n\r\nHam. Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me,\r\n     Hold you the watch to-night?\r\n\r\nMar. Ber.                We do, my lord.\r\n\r\nHam. Arm\'d, say you?\r\n\r\nMar.  Ber. Arm\'d, my lord.\r\n\r\nHam. From top to toe?\r\n\r\nMar. Ber.               My lord, from head to foot.\r\n\r\nHam. Then saw you not his face?\r\n\r\nHor. Oh, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.\r\n\r\nHam. What, look\'d he frowningly?\r\n\r\nHor. A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.\r\n\r\nHam. Pale or red?\r\n\r\nHor. Nay, very pale.\r\n\r\nHam.                    And fix\'d his eyes upon you?\r\n\r\nHor. Most constantly.\r\n\r\nHam.                    I would I had been there.\r\n\r\nHor. It would have much amazed you.\r\n\r\nHam. Very like, very like. Stay\'d it long?\r\n\r\nHor. While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.\r\n\r\nMar. Ber.  Longer, longer.\r\n\r\nHor. Not when I saw\'t.\r\n\r\nHam.                    His beard was grizzled,--no?\r\n\r\nHor. It was, as I have seen it in his life,\r\n     A sable silver\'d.\r\n\r\nHam.                    I will watch to-night;\r\n     Perchance \'t will walk again.\r\n\r\nHor.                    I warrant it will.\r\n\r\nHam. If it assume my noble father\'s person,\r\n     I\'ll speak to it, though hell itself should gape\r\n     And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,\r\n     If you have hitherto conceal\'d this sight,\r\n     Let it be tenable in your silence still;\r\n     And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,\r\n     Give it an understanding, but no tongue:\r\n     I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:\r\n     Upon the platform, \'twixt eleven and twelve,\r\n     I\'ll visit you.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--Tru\'ant, wandering from business, loitering. Trust\'er, a\r\nbeliever.

DISSERTATION ON ROAST PIG.\r\n\r\nCharles Lamb (b. 1775, d. 1834) was born in London. He was educated at\r\nChrist\'s Hospital, where he was a schoolfellow and intimate friend of\r\nColeridge. In 1792 he became a clerk in the India House, London, and in\r\n1825 he retired from his clerkship on a pension of 441 Pounds. Lamb never\r\nmarried, but devoted his life to the care of his sister Mary, who was at\r\ntimes insane. He wrote "Tales founded on the Plays of Shakespeare," and\r\nseveral other works of rare merit; but his literary fame rests principally\r\non the inimitable "Essays of Elia" (published originally in the "London\r\nMagazine"), from one of which the following selection is adapted.\r\n\r\n1. Mankind, says a Chinese manuscript, which my friend M. was obliging\r\nenough to read and explain to me, for the first seventy thousand ages ate\r\ntheir meat raw, clawing or biting it from the living animal, just as they\r\ndo in Abyssinia to this day.\r\n\r\n2. This period is not obscurely hinted at by their great Confucius in the\r\nsecond chapter of his "Mundane Mutations," where he designates a kind of\r\ngolden age by the term Cho-fang, literally the Cooks\' Holiday. The\r\nmanuscript goes on to say that the art of roasting, or rather broiling\r\n(which I take to be the elder brother), was accidentally discovered in the\r\nmanner following:\r\n\r\n3. The swineherd, Ho-ti, having gone out into the woods one morning, as\r\nhis manner was, to collect mast for his hogs, left his cottage in the care\r\nof his eldest son, Bo-bo, a great lubberly boy, who, being fond of playing\r\nwith fire, as younkers of his age commonly are, let some sparks escape\r\ninto a bundle of straw, which, kindling quickly, spread the conflagration\r\nover every part of their poor mansion till it was reduced to ashes.\r\n\r\n4. Together with the cottage,--a sorry, antediluvian makeshift of a\r\nbuilding, you may think it,--what was of much more importance, a fine\r\nlitter of newborn pigs, no less than nine in number, perished. China pigs\r\nhave been esteemed a luxury all over the East from the remotest periods we\r\nread of.\r\n\r\n5. Bo-bo was in the utmost consternation, as you may think, not so much\r\nfor the sake of the tenement, which his father and he could easily build\r\nup again with a few dry branches, and the labor of an hour or two, at any\r\ntime, as for the loss of the pigs. While he was thinking what he should\r\nsay to his father, and wringing his hands over the smoking remnants of one\r\nof those untimely sufferers, an odor assailed his nostrils unlike any\r\nscent which he had before experienced.\r\n\r\n6. What, could it proceed from? Not from the burnt cottage,--he had smelt\r\nthat smell before,--indeed, this was by no means the first accident of the\r\nkind which had occurred through the negligence of this unlucky young\r\nfirebrand. Much less did it resemble that of any known herb, weed, or\r\nflower. A premonitory moistening at the same time overflowed his nether\r\nlip. He knew not what to think.\r\n\r\n7. He next stooped down to feel the pig, if there were any signs of life\r\nin it. He burnt his fingers, and to cool them he applied them in his booby\r\nfashion to his mouth. Some of the crumbs of the scorched skin had come\r\naway with his fingers, and for the first time in his life (in the world\'s\r\nlife, indeed, for before him no man had known it) he tasted--crackling!\r\nAgain he felt and fumbled at the pig. It did not burn him so much now;\r\nstill he licked his fingers from a sort of habit.\r\n\r\n8. The truth at length broke into his slow understanding that it was the\r\npig that smelt so, and the pig that tasted so delicious; and surrendering\r\nhimself up to the newborn pleasure, he fell to tearing up whole handfuls\r\nof the scorched skin with the flesh next it, and was cramming it down his\r\nthroat in his beastly fashion, when his sire entered amid the smoking\r\nrafters, armed with a retributory cudgel, and, finding how affairs stood,\r\nbegan to rain blows upon the young rogue\'s shoulders as thick as\r\nhailstones, which Bo-bo heeded not any more than if they had been flies.\r\n\r\n9. His father might lay on, but he could not beat him from his pig till he\r\nhad fairly made an end of it, when, becoming a little more sensible of his\r\nsituation, something like the following dialogue eusued:\r\n\r\n"You graceless whelp, what have you got there devouring? Is it not enough\r\nthat you have burnt me down three houses with your dog\'s tricks, and be\r\nhanged to you! but you must be eating fire, and I know not what? What have\r\nyou got there, I say?"\r\n\r\n"O father, the pig, the pig! do come and taste how nice the burnt pig\r\neats!"\r\n\r\n10. The ears of Ho-ti tingled with horror. He cursed his son, and he\r\ncursed himself that he should ever have a son that should eat burnt pig.\r\n\r\nBo-bo, whose scent was wonderfully sharpened since morning, soon raked out\r\nanother pig, and, fairly rending it asunder, thrust the lesser half by\r\nmain force into the fists of Ho-ti, still shouting out, "Eat, eat, eat the\r\nburnt pig, father! only taste! Oh!" with such like barbarous ejaculations,\r\ncramming all the while as if he would choke.\r\n\r\n11. Ho-ti trembled in every joint while he grasped the abominable thing,\r\nwavering whether he should not put his son to death for an unnatural young\r\nmonster, when the crackling scorching his fingers, as it had done his\r\nson\'s, and applying the same remedy to them, he in his turn tasted some of\r\nits flavor, which, make what sour mouths he would for a pretense, proved\r\nnot altogether displeasing to him. In conclusion (for the manuscript here\r\nis a little tedious), both father and son fairly sat down to the mess, and\r\nnever left off till they had dispatched all that remained of the litter.\r\n\r\n12. Bo-bo was strictly enjoined not to let the secret escape, for the\r\nneighbors would certainly have stoned them for a couple of abominable\r\nwretches, who could think of improving upon the good meat which God had\r\nsent them. Nevertheless strange stories got about. It was observed that\r\nHo-ti\'s cottage was burnt down now more frequently than ever. Nothing but\r\nfires from this time forward. Some would break out in broad day, others in\r\nthe night-time; and Ho-ti himself, which was the more remarkable, instead\r\nof chastising his son, seemed to grow more indulgent to him than ever.\r\n\r\n13. At length they were watched, the terrible mystery discovered, and\r\nfather and son summoned to take their trial at Pekin, then an\r\ninconsiderable assize town. Evidence was given, the obnoxious food itself\r\nproduced in court, and verdict about to be pronounced, when the foreman of\r\nthe jury begged that some of the burnt pig, of which the culprits stood\r\naccused, might be handed into the box.\r\n\r\n14. He handled it, and they all handled it; and burning their fingers, as\r\nBo-bo and his father had done before them, and nature prompting to each of\r\nthem the same remedy, against the face of all the facts, and the clearest\r\ncharge which the judge had ever given,--to the surprise of the whole\r\ncourt, townsfolk, strangers, reporters, and all present,--without leaving\r\nthe box, or any manner of consultation whatever, they brought in a\r\nsimultaneous verdict of "Not Guilty."\r\n\r\n15. The judge, who was a shrewd fellow, winked at the manifest iniquity of\r\nthe decision; and when the court was dismissed, went privily, and bought\r\nup all the pigs that could be had for love or money. In a few days his\r\nlordship\'s townhouse was observed to be on fire.\r\n\r\n16. The thing took wing, and now there was nothing to be seen but fire in\r\nevery direction. Fuel and pigs grew enormously dear all over the district.\r\nThe insurance offices one and all shut up shop. People built slighter and\r\nslighter every day, until it was feared that the very science of\r\narchitecture would in no long time be lost to the world.\r\n\r\n17. Thus this custom of firing houses continued till in process of time,\r\nsays my manuscript, a sage arose, like our Locke, who made a discovery\r\nthat the flesh of swine, or indeed of any other animal, might be cooked\r\n(burnt, as they called it) without the necessity of consuming a whole\r\nhouse to dress it.\r\n\r\n18. Then first began the rude form of a gridiron. Roasting by the string\r\nor spit came in a century or two later; I forget in whose dynasty. By such\r\nslow degrees, concludes the manuscript, do the most useful, and seemingly\r\nthe most obvious, arts make their way among mankind.\r\n\r\n19. Without placing too implicit faith in the account above given, it must\r\nbe agreed that if a worthy pretext for so dangerous an experiment as\r\nsetting houses on fire (especially in these days) could be assigned in\r\nfavor of any culinary object that pretext and excuse might be found in\r\nRoast Pig.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--3.

A PEN PICTURE.\r\n\r\nWilliam Black (b. 1841,---) is one of the leading modern novelist of\r\nEngland. The scenes of his stories are for the most part laid in Scotland,\r\nand he excels in the delineation of Scotch character. But his most\r\nremarkable power is seen in those vivid, poetical descriptions of scenery,\r\nof which the following selection, adapted from "The Princess of Thule," is\r\na good example. Mr. Black\'s most noted works, in addition to the one\r\nnamed, are: "A Daughter of Heth," "The Strange Adventures of a Phaeton,"\r\n"Kilmeny," and "McLeod of Dare."\r\n\r\n1. Lavender had already transformed Sheila into a heroine during the half\r\nhour of their stroll from the beach and around the house; and as they sat\r\nat dinner on this still, brilliant evening in summer, he clothed her in\r\nthe garments of romance.\r\n\r\n2. Her father, with his great, gray beard and heavy brow, became the King\r\nof Thule, living in this solitary house overlooking the sea, and having\r\nmemories of a dear sweetheart. His daughter, the Princess, had the glamour\r\nof a thousand legends dwelling in her beautiful eyes; and when she walked\r\nby the shores of the Atlantic, that were now getting yellow under the\r\nsunset, what strange and unutterable thoughts must appear in the wonder of\r\nher face!\r\n\r\n3. After dinner they went outside and sat down on a bench in the garden.\r\nIt was a cool and pleasant evening. The sun had gone down in red fire\r\nbehind the Atlantic, and there was still left a rich glow of crimson in\r\nthe west, while overhead, in the pale yellow of the sky, some filmy clouds\r\nof rose color lay motionless. How calm was the sea out there, and the\r\nwhiter stretch of water coming into Loch Roag! The cool air of the\r\ntwilight was scented with sweetbrier. The wash of the ripples along the\r\ncoast could be heard in the stillness.\r\n\r\n4. The girl put her hand on her father\'s head, and reminded him that she\r\nhad had her big greyhound, Bras, imprisoned all the afternoon, and that\r\nshe had to go down to Borvabost with a message for some people who were\r\nleaving by the boat in the morning.\r\n\r\n"But you can not go away down to Borvabost by yourself, Sheila," said\r\nIngram. "It will be dark before you return."\r\n\r\n"It will not be darker than this all the night through," said the girl.\r\n\r\n5. "But I hope you will let us go with you," said Lavender, rather\r\nanxiously; and she assented with a gracious smile, and went to fetch the\r\ngreat deerhound that was her constant companion. And lo! he found himself\r\nwalking with a Princess in this wonderland, through the magic twilight\r\nthat prevails in northern latitudes. Mackenzie and Ingram had gone to the\r\nfront. The large deerhound, after regarding him attentively, had gone to\r\nits mistress\'s side, and remained closely there.\r\n\r\n6. Even Sheila, when they had reached the loftiest part of their route,\r\nand could see beneath them the island and the water surrounding it, was\r\nstruck by the exceeding beauty of the twilight; and as for her companion,\r\nhe remembered it many a time thereafter, as if it were a dream of the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. Before them lay the Atlantic--a pale line of blue, still, silent, and\r\nremote. Overhead the sky was of a clear, thin gold, with heavy masses of\r\nviolet cloud stretched across from north to south, and thickening as they\r\ngot near the horizon. Down at their feet, near the shore, a dusky line of\r\nhuts and houses was scarcely visible; and over these lay a pale blue film\r\nof peat smoke that did not move in the still air.\r\n\r\n8. Then they saw the bay into which the White Water runs, and they could\r\ntrace the yellow glimmer of the river stretching into the island through a\r\nlevel valley of bog and morass. Far away towards the east lay the bulk of\r\nthe island,--dark green undulations of moorland and pasture; and there, in\r\nthe darkness, the gable of one white house had caught the clear light of\r\nthe sky, and was gleaming westward like a star.\r\n\r\n9. But all this was as nothing to the glory that began to shine in the\r\nsoutheast, where the sky was of a pale violet over the peaks of\r\nMealasabhal and Suainabhal. There, into the beautiful dome, rose the\r\ngolden crescent of the moon, warm in color, as though it still retained\r\nthe last rays of the sunset. A line of quivering gold fell across Loch\r\nRoag, and touched the black hull and spars of the boat in which Sheila had\r\nbeen sailing in the morning.\r\n\r\n10. That bay down there, with its white sands and massive rocks, its still\r\nexpanse of water, and its background of mountain peaks palely covered by\r\nthe yellow moonlight, seemed really a home for a magic princess who was\r\nshut off from all the world. But here, in front of them, was another sort\r\nof sea, and another sort of life,--a small fishing village hidden under a\r\ncloud of pale peat smoke, and fronting the great waters of the Atlantic\r\nitself, which lay under a gloom of violet clouds.\r\n\r\n11. On the way home it was again Lavender\'s good fortune to walk with\r\nSheila across the moorland path they had traversed some little time\r\nbefore. And now the moon was still higher in the heavens, and the yellow\r\nlane of light that crossed the violet waters of Loch Roag quivered in a\r\ndeeper gold. The night air was scented with the Dutch clover growing down\r\nby the shore. They could hear the curlew whistling and the plover calling\r\namid that monotonous plash of the waves that murmured all around the\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\n12. When they returned to the house, the darker waters of the Atlantic and\r\nthe purple clouds of the west were shut out from sight; and before them\r\nthere was only the liquid plain of Loch Roag, with its pathway of yellow\r\nfire, and far away on the other side the shoulders and peaks of the\r\nsouthern mountains, that had grown gray and clear and sharp in the\r\nbeautiful twilight. And this was Sheila\'s home.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--2. Gla\'mour (pro. gla\'moor), witchery, or a charm on the\r\neyes, making them see things differently from what they really are. 3.\r\nLoch (pro. lok), a lake, a bay or arm of the sea. 7.

Ingram is an old friend and\r\nfrequent visitor, while Lavender, a friend of Ingram\'s, is on his first\r\nvisit to the island.\r\n\r\n2. Thule (pro.

Brooks (b. 1813, d. 1833)[1] was born at Salem, Mass., and was\r\nthe valedictorian of his class at Harvard College, where he graduated in\r\n1832. He shortly afterwards entered the ministry, and had charge of a\r\ncongregation at Newport, R.I. He was a great student of German literature,\r\nand began his own literary career by a translations of Schiller\'s "William\r\nTell." This was followed by numerous translations from the German, mainly\r\npoetry, which have been published from time to time, in several volumes.\r\nOf these translations, Goethe\'s "Faust," Richter\'s "Titan" and "Hesperus,"\r\nand a humorous poem by Dr. Karl Arnold Kortum, "The Life, Opinions,\r\nActions, and Fate of Hieronimus Jobs, the Candidate," deserve especial\r\nmention. Mr. Brooks also published a number of original poems, addresses,\r\netc.\r\n\r\n[Transcriber\'s Note 1: The correct dates are June, 20 1813 to\r\nJune 14, 1883.]\r\n\r\n1.

A cry from the floods to the fountains;\r\n     And the torrents repeat the glad song\r\n   As they leap from the breast of the mountains,--\r\n   "O spirit! be free and be strong."\r\n\r\n3. The pine forests thrill with emotion\r\n     Of praise, as the spirit sweeps by:\r\n   With a voice like the murmur of ocean\r\n     To the soul of the listener they cry.\r\n\r\n4. Oh! sing, human heart, like the fountains,\r\n     With joy reverential and free,\r\n   Contented and calm as the mountains,\r\n     And deep as the woods and the sea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXIII. A PICTURE OF HUMAN LIFE.\r\n\r\nSamuel Johnson (b. 1709, d. 1784). This remarkable man was born in\r\nLichfield, Staffordshire, England. He was the son of a bookseller and\r\nstationer. He entered Pembroke College, Oxford, in 1728; but his poverty\r\ncompelled him to leave at the end of three years. Soon after his marriage,\r\nin 1736, he opened a private school, but obtained only three pupils, one\r\nof whom was David Garrick, afterwards a celebrated actor. In 1737, he\r\nremoved to London, where he resided most of the rest of his life. The most\r\nnoted of his numerous literary works are his "Dictionary," the first one\r\nof the English language worthy of mention, "The Vanity of Human Wishes," a\r\npoem, "The Rambler," "Rasselas," "The Lives of the English Poets," and his\r\nedition of Shakespeare. An annual pension of 300 pounds was granted him in\r\n1762.\r\n\r\nIn person, Johnson was heavy and awkward; in manner, boorish and\r\noverbearing; but his learning and his great powers caused his company to\r\nbe sought by many eminent men.\r\n\r\n1. Obidah, the son of Abnesina, left the caravansary early in the morning,\r\nand pursued his journey through the plains of Hindostan. He was fresh and\r\nvigorous with rest; he was animated with hope; he was incited by desire;\r\nhe walked swiftly forward over the valleys, and saw the hills gradually\r\nrising before him.\r\n\r\n2. As he passed along, his ears were delighted with the morning song of\r\nthe bird of paradise; he was fanned by the last flutters of the sinking\r\nbreeze, and sprinkled with dew by groves of spices; he sometimes\r\ncontemplated towering height of the oak, monarch of the hills; and\r\nsometimes caught the gentle fragrance of the primrose, eldest daughter of\r\nthe spring; all his senses were gratified, and all care was banished from\r\nhis heart.\r\n\r\n3. Thus he went on, till the sun approached his meridian, and the\r\nincreasing heat preyed upon his strength; he then looked round about him\r\nfor some more commodious path. He saw, on his right hand, a grove that\r\nseemed to wave its shades as a sign of invitation; he entered it, and\r\nfound the coolness and verdure irresistibly pleasant. He did not, however,\r\nforget whither he was traveling, but found a narrow way, bordered with\r\nflowers, which appeared to have the same direction with the main road, and\r\nwas pleased, that, by this happy experiment, he had found means to unite\r\npleasure with business, and to gain the rewards of diligence without\r\nsuffering its fatigues.\r\n\r\n4. He, therefore, still continued to walk for a time, without the least\r\nremission of his ardor, except that he was sometimes tempted to stop by\r\nthe music of the birds, which the heat had assembled in the shade, and\r\nsometimes amused himself with picking the flowers that covered the banks\r\non each side, or the fruits that hung upon the branches. At last, the\r\ngreen path began to decline from its first tendency, and to wind among the\r\nhills and thickets, cooled with fountains, and murmuring with waterfalls.\r\n\r\n5. Here Obidah paused for a time, and began to consider whether it was\r\nlonger safe to forsake the known and common track; but, remembering that\r\nthe heat was now in its greatest violence, and that the plain was dusty\r\nand uneven, he resolved to pursue the new path, which he supposed only to\r\nmake a few meanders, in compliance with the garieties of the ground, and\r\nto end at last in the common road.\r\n\r\n6. Having thus calmed his solicitude, he renewed his pace, though he\r\nsuspected he was not gaining ground. This uneasiness of his mind inclined\r\nhim to lay hold on every new object, and give way to every sensation that\r\nmight soothe or divert him. He listened to every echo, he mounted every\r\nhill for a fresh prospect, he turned aside to every cascade, and pleased\r\nhimself with tracing the course of a gentle river that rolled among the\r\ntrees, and watered a large region, with innumerable circumvolutions.\r\n\r\n7. In these amusements, the hours passed away uncounted; his deviations\r\nhad perplexed his memory, and he knew not toward what point to travel. He\r\nstood pensive and confused, afraid to go forward lest he should go wrong,\r\nyet conscious that the time of loitering was now past. While he was thus\r\ntortured with uncertainty, the sky was overspread with clouds, the day\r\nvanished from before him, and a sudden tempest gathered round his head.\r\n\r\n8. He was now roused by his danger to a quick and painful remembrance of\r\nhis folly; he now saw how happiness is lost when ease is consulted; he\r\nlamented the unmanly impatience that prompted him to seek shelter in the\r\ngrove, and despised the petty curiosity that led him on from trifle to\r\ntrifle. While he was thus reflecting, the air grew blacker and a clap of\r\nthunder broke his meditation.\r\n\r\n9. He now resolved to do what remained yet in his power; to tread back the\r\nground which he had passed, and try to find some issue where the wood\r\nmight open into the plain. He prostrated himself upon the ground, and\r\ncommended his life to the Lord of nature. He rose with confidence and\r\ntranquillity, and pressed on with his saber in his hand; for the beasts of\r\nthe desert were in motion, and on every hand were heard the mingled howls\r\nof rage, and fear, and ravage, and expiration; all the horrors of darkness\r\nand solitude surrounded him; the winds roared in the woods, and the\r\ntorrents tumbled from the hills.\r\n\r\n10. Thus, forlorn and distressed, he wandered through the wild without\r\nknowing whither he was going or whether he was every moment drawing nearer\r\nto safety or to destruction. At length, not fear but labor began to\r\novercome him; his breath grew short, and his knees trembled, and he was on\r\nthe point of lying down, in resignation to his fate, when he beheld,\r\nthrough the brambles, the glimmer of a taper. He advanced toward the\r\nlight, and finding that it proceeded from the cottage of a hermit, he\r\ncalled humbly at the door, and obtained admission. The old man set before\r\nhim such provisions as he had collected for himself, on which Obidah fed\r\nwith eagerness and gratitude.\r\n\r\n11. When the repast was over, "Tell me," said the hermit, "by what chance\r\nthou hast been brought hither; I have been now twenty years an inhabitant\r\nof this wilderness, in which I never saw a man before." Obidah then\r\nrelated the occurrences of his journey, without any concealment or\r\npalliation.\r\n\r\n12. "Son," said the hermit, "let the errors and follies, the dangers and\r\nescapes, of this day, sink deep into your heart. Remember, my son, that\r\nhuman life is the journey of a day. We rise in the morning of youth, full\r\nof vigor, and full of expectation; we set forward with spirit and hope,\r\nwith gayety and with diligence, and travel on awhile in the straight road\r\nof piety toward the mansions of rest. In a short time we remit our fervor,\r\nand endeavor to find some mitigation of our duty, and some more easy means\r\nof obtaining the same end.\r\n\r\n13. "We then relax our vigor, and resolve no longer to be terrified with\r\ncrimes at a distance, but rely upon our own constancy, and venture to\r\napproach what we resolve never to touch. We thus enter the bowers of ease,\r\nand repose in the shades of security. Here the heart softens, and\r\nvigilance subsides; we are then willing to inquire whether another advance\r\ncan not be made, and whether we may not at least turn our eyes upon the\r\ngardens of pleasure. We approach them with scruple and hesitation; we\r\nenter them, but enter timorous and trembling, and always hope to pass\r\nthrough them without losing the road of virtue, which we for a while keep\r\nin our sight, and to which we propose to return.\r\n\r\n14. "But temptation succeeds temptation, and one compliance prepares us\r\nfor another; we, in time, lose the happiness of innocence, and solace our\r\ndisquiet with sensual gratifications. By degrees we let fall the\r\nremembrance of our original intention, and quit the only adequate object\r\nof rational desire. We entangle ourselves in business, immerge ourselves\r\nin luxury, and rove through the labyrinths of inconstancy till the\r\ndarkness of old age begins to invade us, and disease and anxiety obstruct\r\nour way. We then look back upon our lives with horror, with sorrow, and\r\nwith repentance; and wish, but too often vainly wish, that we had not\r\nforsaken the paths of virtue.\r\n\r\n15. "Happy are they, my son, who shall learn, from thy example, not to\r\ndespair, but shall remember that though the day is past, and their\r\nstrength is wasted, there yet remains one effort to be made; that\r\nreformation is never hopeless, nor sincere endeavors ever unassisted; that\r\nthe wanderer may at length return after all his errors; and that he who\r\nimplores strength and courage from above, shall find danger and difficulty\r\ngive way before him. Go now, my son, to thy repose: commit thyself to the\r\ncare of Omnipotence; and when the morning calls again to toil, begin anew\r\nthy journey and thy life."\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Car-a-van sa-ry, a kind of inn in the East, where\r\ncaravans (or large companies of traders) rest at night. 5. Me-an\'ders,\r\nwindings, turnings. 6. Cir-cum-vo-lu\'tions, windings or flowings around.\r\n7. De-vi-a\'tions, wanderins from one\'s course. 9. Ex-pi-ra\'tion, death.\r\n11. Pal-li-a\'tion, concealment of the most blamable circumstances of an\r\noffence. 12. Mit-i-ga\'tion, abatement, the act of rendering less severe.\r\n14. Ad\'e-quate, fully sufficient. Lab\'y-rinth, a place full of winding\r\npassages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXIV. A SUMMER LONGING.\r\n\r\nGeorge Arnold (b. 1834, d. 1865) was born in New York, but removed with\r\nhis parents to Illinois while yet an infant. There he passed his boyhood,\r\nbeing educated at home by his parents. In 1849 the family again removed to\r\nStrawberry Farms, Monmouth County, N.J. When eighteen years old he began\r\nto study painting, but soon gave up the art and devoted himself to\r\nliterature. He became a journalist of New York City, and his productions\r\ninclude almost every variety of writings found in the literary magazines.\r\nAfter his death, two volumes of his poems, "Drift: a Seashore Idyl," and\r\n"Poems, Grave and Gay," were edited by Mr. William Winter.\r\n\r\n1. I must away to the wooded hills and vales,\r\n     Where broad, slow streams flow cool and silently\r\n   And idle barges flap their listless sails.\r\n   For me the summer sunset glows and pales,\r\n     And green fields wait for me.\r\n\r\n2. I long for shadowy founts, where the birds\r\n     Twitter and chirp at noon from every tree;\r\n   I long for blossomed leaves and lowing herds;\r\n   And Nature\'s voices say in mystic words,\r\n     "The green fields wait for thee."\r\n\r\n3. I dream of uplands, where the primrose shines\r\n     And waves her yellow lamps above the lea;\r\n   Of tangled copses, swung with trailing vines;\r\n   Of open vistas, skirted with tall pines,\r\n     Where green fields wait for me.\r\n\r\n4. I think of long, sweet afternoons, when I\r\n     May lie and listen to the distant sea,\r\n   Or hear the breezes in the reeds that sigh,\r\n   Or insect voices chirping shrill and dry,\r\n     In fields that wait for me.\r\n\r\n5. These dreams of summer come to bid me find\r\n     The forest\'s shade, the wild bird\'s melody,\r\n   While summer\'s rosy wreaths for me are twined,\r\n   While summer\'s fragrance lingers on the wind,\r\n     And green fields wait for me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXV. FATE.\r\n\r\nFrancis Bret Harte (b. 1839,--) was born in Albany, N.Y. When seventeen\r\nyears old he went to California, where he engaged in various employments.\r\nHe was a teacher, was employed in government offices, worked in the gold\r\nmines, and learned to be a compositor in a printing office. In 1868 he\r\nstarted the "Overland Monthly," and his original and characteristic poems\r\nand sketches soon made it a popular magazine. Mr. Harte has been a\r\ncontributor to some of the leading periodicals of the country, but\r\nprincipally to the "Atlantic Monthly."\r\n\r\n1. "The sky is clouded, the rocks are bare;\r\n   The spray of the tempest is white in air;\r\n   The winds are out with the waves at play,\r\n   And I shall not tempt the sea to-day.\r\n\r\n2. "The trail is narrow, the wood is dim,\r\n   The panther clings to the arching limb;\r\n   And the lion\'s whelps are abroad at play,\r\n   And I shall not join in the chase to-day."\r\n\r\n3. But the ship sailed safely over the sea,\r\n   And the hunters came from the chase in glee;\r\n   And the town that was builded upon a rock\r\n   Was swallowed up in the earthquake shock.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCXVI. THE BIBLE THE BEST OF CLASSICS.\r\n\r\nThomas S. Grimke (b. 1786, d. 1834). This eminent lawyer and\r\nscholar was born in Charleston, S.C. He graduated at Yale College\r\nin 1807. He gained considerable reputation as a politician, but is\r\nbest known as an advocate of peace, Sunday schools, and the\r\nBible. He was a man of deep feeling, earnest purpose, and pure\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n1. There is a classic the best the world has ever seen, the noblest that\r\nhas ever honored and dignified the language of mortals. If we look into\r\nits antiquity, we discover a title to our veneration unrivaled in the\r\nhistory of literature. If we have respect to its evidences, they are found\r\nin the testimony of miracle and prophecy; in the ministry of man, of\r\nnature, and of angels, yea, even of "God, manifest in the flesh," of "God\r\nblessed forever."\r\n\r\n2. If we consider its authenticity, no other pages have survived the lapse\r\nof time that can be compared with it. If we examine its authority, for it\r\nspeaks as never man spake, we discover that it came from heaven in vision\r\nand prophecy under the sanction of Him who is Creator of all things, and\r\nthe Giver of every good and perfect gift.\r\n\r\n3. If we reflect on its truths, they are lovely and spotless, sublime and\r\nholy as God himself, unchangeable as his nature, durable as his righteous\r\ndominion, and versatile as the moral condition of mankind. If we regard\r\nthe value of its treasures, we must estimate them, not like the relics of\r\nclassic antiquity, by the perishable glory and beauty, virtue and\r\nhappiness, of this world, but by the enduring perfection and supreme\r\nfelicity of an eternal kingdom.\r\n\r\n4. If we inquire who are the men that have recorded its truths, vindicated\r\nits rights, and illustrated the excellence of its scheme, from the depth\r\nof ages and from the living world, from the populous continent and the\r\nisles of the sea, comes forth the answer: "The patriarch and the prophet,\r\nthe evangelist and the martyr."\r\n\r\n5. If we look abroad through the world of men, the victims of folly or\r\nvice, the prey of cruelty, of injustice, and inquire what are its\r\nbenefits, even in this temporal state, the great and the humble, the rich\r\nand the poor, the powerful and the weak, the learned and the ignorant\r\nreply, as with one voice, that humility and resignation, purity, order,\r\nand peace, faith, hope, and charity are its blessings upon earth.\r\n\r\n6. And if, raising our eyes from time to eternity; from the world of\r\nmortals to the world of just men made perfect; from the visible creation,\r\nmarvelous, beautiful, and glorious as it is, to the invisible creation of\r\nangels and seraphs; from the footstool of God to the throne of God\r\nhimself, we ask, what are the blessings that flow from this single volume,\r\nlet the question be answered by the pen of the evangelist, the harp of the\r\nprophet, and the records of the book of life.\r\n\r\n7. Such is the best of classics the world has ever admired; such, the\r\nnoblest that man has ever adopted as a guide.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Clas\'sic, a work of acknowledged excellence and\r\nauthority. 2. Au-then-tic\'i-ty, of established authority for truth and\r\ncorrectness.

Morris (b. 1802, d. 1864) was born in Philadelphia. In 1823 he\r\nbecame one of the editors of the "New York Mirror," a weekly literary\r\npaper, In 1846 Mr. Morris and N. P. Willis founded "The Home Journal." He\r\nwas associate editor of this popular journal until a short time before his\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n1. This book is all that\'s left me now,--\r\n     Tears will unbidden start,--\r\n   With faltering lip and throbbing brow\r\n     I press it to my heart.\r\n   For many generations past\r\n     Here is our family tree;\r\n   My mother\'s hands this Bible clasped,\r\n     She, dying, gave it me.\r\n\r\n2. Ah! well do I remember those\r\n     Whose names these records bear;\r\n   Who round the hearthstone used to close,\r\n     After the evening prayer,\r\n   And speak of what these pages said\r\n     In tones my heart would thrill!\r\n   Though they are with the silent dead,\r\n     Here are they living still!\r\n\r\n3. My father read this holy hook\r\n     To brothers, sisters, dear;\r\n   How calm was my poor mother\'s look,\r\n     Who loved God\'s word to hear!\r\n   Her angel face,--I see it yet!\r\n     What thronging memories come!\r\n   Again that little group is met\r\n     Within the walls of home!\r\n\r\n4. Thou truest friend man ever knew,\r\n     Thy constancy I\'ve tried;\r\n   When all were false, I found thee true,\r\n     My counselor and guide.\r\n   The mines of earth no treasures give\r\n     That could this volume buy;\r\n   In teaching me the way to live,\r\n     It taught me how to die.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of McGuffey\'s Fifth Eclectic Reader\r\nby William Holmes McGuffey\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MCGUFFEY\'S FIFTH ECLECTIC READER ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 15040.txt or 15040.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.net/1/5/0/4/15040/\r\n\r\nProduced by Don Kostuch\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
