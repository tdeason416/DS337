It is more difficult, however, to\r\nbe simple in a topic which, even in its illustrations, demands of the\r\nreader more or less facility in the exploration of his own mind. I am\r\npersuaded that the attempt to make the matter of psychology more\r\nelementary than is here done, would only result in making it untrue\r\nand so in defeating its own object.\r\n\r\nIn preparing the book I have secured the right and welcomed the\r\nopportunity to include certain more popular passages from earlier\r\nbooks and articles. It is necessary to say this, for some people are\r\nloath to see a man repeat himself. When one has once said a thing,\r\nhowever, about as well as he can say it, there is no good reason that\r\nhe should be forced into the pretence of saying something different\r\nsimply to avoid using the same form of words a second time. The\r\nquestion, of course, is as to whether he should not then resign\r\nhimself to keeping still, and letting others do the further speaking.\r\nThere is much to be said for such a course. But if one have the right\r\nto print more severe and difficult things, and think he really has\r\nsomething to say which would instruct the larger audience, it would\r\nseem only fair to allow him to speak in the simpler way also, even\r\nthough all that he says may not have the merit of escaping the charge\r\nof infringing his own copyrights!\r\n\r\nI am indebted to the proprietors of the following magazines for the\r\nuse of such passages: The Popular Science Monthly, The Century\r\nMagazine, The Inland Educator; and with them I also wish to thank The\r\nMacmillan Company and the owners of Appletons\' Universal Cyclop\xc3\xa6dia.\r\n\r\nAs to the scope and contents of the Story, I have aimed to include\r\nenough statement of methods and results in each of the great\r\ndepartments of psychological research to give the reader an\r\nintelligent idea of what is being done, and to whet his appetite for\r\nmore detailed information. In the choice of materials I have relied\r\nfrankly on my own experience and in debatable matters given my own\r\nopinions. This gives greater reality to the several topics, besides\r\nmaking it possible, by this general statement, at once to acknowledge\r\nit, and also to avoid discussion and citation of authorities in the\r\ntext. At the same time, in the exposition of general principles I have\r\nendeavoured to keep well within the accepted truth and terminology of\r\npsychology.\r\n\r\nIt will be remarked that in several passages the evolution theory is\r\nadopted in its application to the mind. While this great theory can\r\nnot be discussed in these pages, yet I may say that, in my opinion,\r\nthe evidence in favour of it is about the same, and about as strong,\r\nas in biology, where it is now made a presupposition of scientific\r\nexplanation. So far from being unwelcome, I find it in psychology no\r\nless than in biology a great gain, both from the point of view of\r\nscientific knowledge and from that of philosophical theory. Every\r\ngreat law that is added to our store adds also to our conviction that\r\nthe universe is run through with Mind. Even so-called Chance, which\r\nused to be the "bogie" behind Natural Selection, has now been found to\r\nillustrate--in the law of Probabilities--the absence of Chance. As\r\nProfessor Pearson has said: "We recognise that our conception of\r\nChance is now utterly different from that of yore.... What we are to\r\nunderstand by a chance distribution is one in accordance with law, and\r\none the nature of which can, for all practical purposes, be closely\r\npredicted." If the universe be pregnant with purpose, as we all wish\r\nto believe, why should not this purpose work itself out by an\r\nevolution process under law?--and if under law, why not the law of\r\nProbabilities? We who have our lives insured provide for our children\r\nthrough our knowledge and use of this law; and our plans for their\r\nwelfare, in most of the affairs of life, are based upon the\r\nrecognition of it. Who will deny to the Great Purpose a similar\r\nresource in producing the universe and in providing for us all?\r\n\r\nI add in a concluding section on Literature some references to various\r\nbooks in English, classified under the headings of the chapters of the\r\ntext. These works will further enlighten the reader, and, if he\r\npersevere, possibly make a psychologist of him.\r\n\r\nJ.

It aims to find out all about\r\nthe mind--the whole story--just as the other sciences aim to find out\r\nall about the subjects of which they treat--astronomy, of the stars;\r\ngeology, of the earth; physiology, of the body. And when we wish to\r\ntrace out the story of the mind, as psychology has done it, we find\r\nthat there are certain general truths with which we should first\r\nacquaint ourselves; truths which the science has been a very long time\r\nfinding out, but which we can now realize without a great deal of\r\nexplanation. These general truths, we may say, are preliminary to the\r\nstory itself; they deal rather with the need of defining, first of\r\nall, the subject or topic of which the story is to be told.\r\n\r\n1. The first such truth is that the mind is not the possession of man\r\nalone. Other creatures have minds. Psychology no longer confines\r\nitself, as it formerly did, to the human soul, denying to the animals\r\na place in this highest of all the sciences. It finds itself unable to\r\nrequire any test or evidence of the presence of mind which the animals\r\ndo not meet, nor does it find any place at which the story of the mind\r\ncan begin higher up than the very beginnings of life. For as soon as\r\nwe ask, "How much mind is necessary to start with?" we have to answer,\r\n"Any mind at all"; and all the animals are possessed of some of the\r\nactions which we associate with mind. Of course, the ascertainment of\r\nthe truth of this belongs--as the ascertainment of all the truths of\r\nnature belongs--to scientific investigation itself. It is the\r\nscientific man\'s rule not to assume anything except as he finds facts\r\nto support the assumption. So we find a great department of psychology\r\ndevoted to just this question--i.e., of tracing mind in the animals\r\nand in the child, and noting the stages of what is called its\r\n"evolution" in the ascending scale of animal life, and its\r\n"development" in the rapid growth which every child goes through in\r\nthe nursery. This gives us two chapters of the story of the mind.\r\nTogether they are called "Genetic Psychology," having two divisions,\r\n"Animal or Comparative Psychology" and "Child Psychology."\r\n\r\n2. Another general truth to note at the outset is this: that we are\r\nable to get real knowledge about the mind. This may seem at first\r\nsight a useless question to raise, seeing that our minds are, in the\r\nthought of many, about the only things we are really sure of. But that\r\nsort of sureness is not what science seeks. Every science requires\r\nsome means of investigation, some method of procedure, which is more\r\nexact than the mere say-so of common sense; and which can be used over\r\nand again by different investigators and under different conditions.\r\nThis gives a high degree of verification and control to the results\r\nonce obtained. The chemist has his acids, and reagents, and blowpipes,\r\netc.; they constitute his instruments, and by using them, under\r\ncertain constant rules, he keeps to a consistent method. So with the\r\nphysiologist; he has his microscope, his staining fluids, his means of\r\nstimulating the tissues of the body, etc. The physicist also makes\r\nmuch of his lenses, and membranes, and electrical batteries, and X-ray\r\napparatus. In like manner it is necessary that the psychologist should\r\nhave a recognised way of investigating the mind, which he can lay\r\nbefore anybody saying: "There, you see my results, you can get them\r\nfor yourself by the same method that I used."\r\n\r\nIn fulfilling this requirement the psychologist resorts to two methods\r\nof procedure. He is able to investigate the mind in two ways, which\r\nare of such general application that anybody of sufficient training to\r\nmake scientific observations at all can repeat them and so confirm the\r\nresults. One of these is what is called Introspection. It consists in\r\ntaking note of one\'s own mind, as all sorts of changes are produced in\r\nit, such as emotions, memories, associations of events now gone, etc.,\r\nand describing everything that takes place. Other persons can repeat\r\nthe observations with their own minds, and see that what the first\r\nreports is true. This results in a body of knowledge which is put\r\ntogether and called "Introspective Psychology," and one chapter of the\r\nstory should be devoted to that.\r\n\r\nThen the other way we have is that of experimenting on some one else\'s\r\nmind. We can act on our friends and neighbours in various ways, making\r\nthem feel, think, accept, refuse this and that, and then observe how\r\nthey act. The differences in their action will show the differences in\r\nthe feelings, etc., which we have produced. In pursuing this method\r\nthe psychologist takes a person--called the "subject" or the\r\n"re-agent"--into his laboratory, asks him to be willing to follow\r\ncertain directions carefully, such as holding an electric handle,\r\nblowing into a tube, pushing a button, etc., when he feels, sees, or\r\nhears certain things; this done with sufficient care, the results are\r\nfound recorded in certain ways which the psychologist has arranged\r\nbeforehand. This second way of proceeding gives results which are\r\ngathered under the two headings "Experimental" and "Physiological\r\nPsychology." They should also have chapters in our story.\r\n\r\n3. There is besides another truth which the psychologist nowadays\r\nfinds very fruitful for his knowledge of the mind; this is the fact\r\nthat minds vary much in different individuals, or classes of\r\nindividuals. First, there is the pronounced difference between healthy\r\nminds and diseased minds. The differences are so great that we have to\r\npursue practically different methods of treating the diseased, not\r\nonly as a class apart from the well minds--putting such diseased\r\npersons into institutions--but also as differing from one another.\r\nJust as the different forms of bodily disease teach us a great deal\r\nabout the body--its degree of strength, its forms of organization and\r\nfunction, its limitations, its heredity, the inter-connection of its\r\nparts, etc.--so mental diseases teach us much about the normal mind.\r\nThis gives another sphere of information which constitutes "Abnormal\r\nPsychology" or "Mental Pathology."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE I.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE II.]\r\n\r\nThere are also very striking variations between individuals even\r\nwithin normal life; well people are very different from one another.\r\nAll that is commonly meant by character or temperament as\r\ndistinguishing one person from another is evidence of these\r\ndifferences. But really to know all about mind we should see what its\r\nvariations are, and endeavour to find out why the variations exist.\r\nThis gives, then, another topic, "Individual or Variational\r\nPsychology." This subject should also have notice in the story.\r\n\r\n4. Allied with this the demand is made upon the psychologist that he\r\nshow to the teacher how to train the mind; how to secure its\r\ndevelopment in the individual most healthfully and productively, and\r\nwith it all in a way to allow the variations of endowment which\r\nindividuals show each to bear its ripest fruit. This is "Educational\r\nor Pedagogical Psychology."\r\n\r\n5. Besides all these great undertakings of the psychologist, there is\r\nanother department of fact which he must some time find very fruitful,\r\nalthough as yet he has not been able to investigate it thoroughly: he\r\nshould ask about the place of the mind in the world at large. If we\r\nseek to know what the mind has done in the world, what a wealth of\r\nstory comes to us from the very beginnings of history! Mind has done\r\nall that has been done: it has built human institutions, indited\r\nliterature, made science, discovered the laws of Nature, used the\r\nforces of the material world, embodied itself in all the monuments\r\nwhich stand to testify to the presence of man. What could tell us more\r\nof what mind is than this record of what mind has done? The\r\nethnologists are patiently tracing the records left by early man in\r\nhis utensils, weapons, clothing, religious rites, architectural\r\nremains, etc., and the anthropologists are seeking to distinguish the\r\ngeneral and essential from the accidental and temporary in all the\r\nhistory of culture and civilization. They are making progress very\r\nslowly, and it is only here and there that principles are being\r\ndiscovered which reveal to the psychologist the necessary modes of\r\naction and development of the mind. All this comes under the head of\r\n"Race Psychology."\r\n\r\n6. Finally, another department, the newest of all, investigates the\r\naction of minds when they are thrown together in crowds. The animals\r\nherd, the insects swarm, most creatures live in companies; they are\r\ngregarious, and man no less is social in his nature. So there is a\r\npsychology of herds, crowds, mobs, etc., all put under the heading of\r\n"Social Psychology." It asks the question, What new phases of the mind\r\ndo we find when individuals unite in common action?--or, on the other\r\nhand, when they are artificially separated?\r\n\r\nWe now have with all this a fairly complete idea of what The Story of\r\nthe Mind should include, when it is all told. Many men are spending\r\ntheir lives each at one or two of these great questions. But it is\r\nonly as the results are all brought together in a consistent view of\r\nthat wonderful thing, the mind, that we may hope to find out all that\r\nit is. We must think of it as a growing, developing thing, showing its\r\nstages of evolution in the ascending animal scale, and also in the\r\nunfolding of the child; as revealing its nature in every change of our\r\ndaily lives which we experience and tell to one another or find\r\nourselves unable to tell; as allowing itself to be discovered in the\r\nlaboratory, and as willing to leave the marks of its activity on the\r\nscientist\'s blackened drum and the dial of the chronoscope; as subject\r\nto the limitations of health and disease, needing to be handled with\r\nall the resources of the asylum, the reformatory, the jail, as well as\r\nwith the delicacy needed to rear the sensitive girl or to win the love\r\nof the bashful maid; as manifesting itself in the development of\r\nhumanity from the first rude contrivances for the use of fire, the\r\nfirst organizations for defence, and the first inscriptions of picture\r\nwriting, up to the modern inventions in electricity, the complex\r\nconstitutions of government, and the classic productions of literary\r\nart; and as revealing its possibilities finally in the brutal acts of\r\nthe mob, the crimes of a lynching party, and the deeds of collective\r\nrighteousness performed by our humane and religious societies.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible, of course, within the limits of this little\r\nvolume, to give even the main results in so many great chapters of\r\nthis ambitious and growing science. I shall not attempt that; but the\r\nrather select from the various departments certain outstanding results\r\nand principles. From these as elevations the reader may see the\r\nmountains on the horizon, so to speak, which at his leisure, and with\r\nbetter guides, he may explore. The choice of materials from so rich a\r\nstore has depended also, as the preface states, on the writer\'s\r\nindividual judgment, and it is quite probable that no one will find\r\nthe matters altogether wisely chosen. All the great departments now\r\nthus briefly described, however, are represented in the following\r\nchapters.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nWHAT OUR MINDS HAVE IN COMMON--INTROSPECTIVE PSYCHOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the sources now indicated from which the psychologist may draw,\r\nthat of so-called Introspective Psychology--the actual reports of what\r\nwe find going on in our minds from time to time--is the most\r\nimportant. This is true for two great reasons, which make Psychology\r\ndifferent from all the other sciences. The first claim which the\r\nintrospective method has upon us arises from the fact that it is only\r\nby it that we can examine the mind directly, and get its events in\r\ntheir purity. Each of us knows himself better than he knows any one\r\nelse. So this department, in which we deal each with his own\r\nconsciousness at first hand, is more reliable, if free from error,\r\nthan any of those spheres in which we examine other persons, so long\r\nas we are dealing with the psychology of the individual. The second\r\nreason that this method of procedure is most important is found in the\r\nfact that all the other departments of psychology--and with them all\r\nthe other sciences--have to use introspection, after all, to make sure\r\nof the results which they get by other methods. For example, the\r\nnatural scientist, the botanist, let us say, and the physical\r\nscientist, the electrician, say, can not observe the plants or the\r\nelectric sparks without really using his introspection upon what is\r\nbefore him. The light from the plant has to go into his brain and\r\nleave a certain effect in his mind, and then he has to use\r\nintrospection to report what he sees. The astronomer who has bad eyes\r\ncan not observe the stars well or discover the facts about them,\r\nbecause his introspection in reporting what he sees proceeds on the\r\nimperfect and distorted images coming in from his defective eyesight.\r\nSo a man given to exaggeration, who is not able to report truthfully\r\nwhat he remembers, can not be a good botanist, since this defect in\r\nintrospection will render his observation of the plants unreliable.\r\n\r\nIn practice the introspective method has been most important, and the\r\ndevelopment of psychology has been up to very recently mainly due to\r\nits use. As a consequence, there are many general principles of mental\r\naction and many laws of mental growth already discovered which should\r\nin the first instance engage our attention. They constitute the main\r\nframework of the building; and we should master them well before we go\r\non to find the various applications which they have in the other\r\ndepartments of the subject.\r\n\r\nThe greater results of "Introspective" or, as it is very often called,\r\n"General" psychology may be summed up in a few leading principles,\r\nwhich sound more or less abstract and difficult, but which will have\r\nmany concrete illustrations in the subsequent chapters. The facts of\r\nexperience, the actual events which we find taking place in our minds,\r\nfall naturally into certain great divisions. These are very easily\r\ndistinguished from one another. The first distinction is covered by\r\nthe popularly recognised difference between "thought and conduct," or\r\n"knowledge and life." On the one hand, the mind is looked at as\r\nreceiving, taking in, learning; and on the other hand, as acting,\r\nwilling, doing this or that. Another great distinction contrasts a\r\nthird mental condition, "feeling," with both of the other two. We say\r\na man has knowledge, but little feeling, head but no heart; or that he\r\nknows and feels the right but does not live up to it.\r\n\r\nI. On the side of Reception we may first point out the avenues through\r\nwhich our experiences come to us: these are the senses--a great\r\nnumber, not simply the five special senses of which we were taught in\r\nour childhood. Besides Sight, Hearing, Taste, Smell, and Touch, we now\r\nknow of certain others very definitely. There are Muscle sensations\r\ncoming from the moving of our limbs, Organic sensations from the inner\r\nvital organs, Heat and Cold sensations which are no doubt distinct\r\nfrom each other, Pain sensations probably having their own physical\r\napparatus, sensations from the Joints, sensations of Pressure, of\r\nEquilibrium of the body, and a host of peculiar sensational conditions\r\nwhich, for all we know, may be separate and distinct, or may arise\r\nfrom combinations of some of the others. Such, for example, are the\r\nsensations which are felt when a current of electricity is sent\r\nthrough the arm.\r\n\r\nAll these give the mind its material to work upon; and it gets no\r\nmaterial in the first instance from any other source. All the things\r\nwe know, all our opinions, knowledges, beliefs, are absolutely\r\ndependent at the start upon this supply of material from our senses;\r\nalthough, as we shall see, the mind gets a long way from its first\r\nsubjection to this avalanche of sensations which come constantly\r\npouring in upon it from the external world. Yet this is the essential\r\nand capital function of Sensation: to supply the material on which the\r\nmind does the work in its subsequent thought and action.\r\n\r\nNext comes the process by which the mind holds its material for future\r\nuse, the process of Memory; and with it the process by which it\r\ncombines its material together in various useful forms, making up\r\nthings and persons out of the material which has been received and\r\nremembered--called Association of Ideas, Thinking, Reasoning, etc. All\r\nthese processes used to be considered as separate "faculties" of the\r\nsoul and as showing the mind doing different things. But that view is\r\nnow completely given up. Psychology now treats the activity of the\r\nmind in a much more simple way. It says: Mind does only one thing; in\r\nall these so-called faculties we have the mind doing this one thing\r\nonly on the different materials which come and go in it. This one\r\nthing is the combining, or holding together, of the elements which\r\nfirst come to it as sensations, so that it can act on a group of them\r\nas if they were only one and represented only one external thing. Let\r\nme illustrate this single and peculiar sort of process as it goes on\r\nin the mind.\r\n\r\nWe may ask how the child apprehends an orange out there on the table\r\nbefore him. It can not be said that the orange goes into the child\'s\r\nmind by any one of its senses. By sight he gets only the colour and\r\nshape of the orange, by smell he gets only its odour, by taste its\r\nsweetness, and by touch its smoothness, rotundity, etc. Furthermore,\r\nby none of these senses does he find out the individuality of the\r\norange, or distinguish it from other things which involve the same or\r\nsimilar sensations--say an apple. It is easy to see that after each of\r\nthe senses has sent in its report something more is necessary: the\r\ncombining of them all together in the same place and at the same\r\ntime, the bringing up of an appropriate name, and with that a sort of\r\nrelating or distinguishing of this group of sensations from those of\r\nthe apple. Only then can we say that the knowledge, "here is an\r\norange," has been reached. Now this is the _one typical way the mind\r\nhas of acting_, this combining of all the items or groups of items\r\ninto ever larger and more fruitful combinations. This is called\r\nApperception. The mind, we say, "apperceives" the orange when it is\r\nable to treat all the separate sensations together as standing for one\r\nthing. And the various circumstances under which the mind does this\r\ngive the occasions for the different names which the earlier\r\npsychology used for marking off different "faculties."\r\n\r\nThese names are still convenient, however, and it may serve to make\r\nthe subject clear, as well as to inform the reader of the meaning of\r\nthese terms, to show how they all refer to this one kind of mental\r\naction.\r\n\r\nThe case of the orange illustrates what is usually called Perception.\r\nIt is the case in which the result is the knowledge of an actual\r\nobject in the outside world. When the same process goes on after the\r\nactual object has been removed it is Memory. When it goes on again in\r\na way which is not controlled by reference to such an outside\r\nobject--usually it is a little fantastic, as in dreams or fancy, but\r\noften it is useful as being so well done as to anticipate what is\r\nreally true in the outside world--then it is Imagination. If it is\r\nactually untrue, but still believed in, we call it Illusion or\r\nHallucination. When it uses mere symbols, such as words, gestures,\r\nwriting, etc., to stand for whole groups of things, it is Thinking or\r\nReasoning. So we may say that what the mind arrives at through this\r\nits one great way of acting, no matter which of these forms it takes\r\non, except in the cases in which it is not true in its results to the\r\nrealities, is Knowledge.\r\n\r\nThus we see that the terms and faculties of the older psychology can\r\nbe arranged under this doctrine of Apperception without the necessity\r\nof thinking of the mind as doing more than the one thing. It simply\r\ngroups and combines its material in different ways and in ever higher\r\ndegrees of complexity.\r\n\r\nApperception, then, is the one principle of mental activity on the\r\nside of its reception and treatment of the materials of experience.\r\n\r\nThere is another term very current in psychology by which this same\r\nprocess is sometimes indicated: the phrase Association of Ideas. This\r\ndesignates the fact that when two things have been perceived or\r\nthought of together, they tend to come up together in the mind in the\r\nfuture; and when a thing has been perceived which resembles another,\r\nor is contrasted with it, they tend to recall each other in the same\r\nway. It is plain, however, that this phrase is applied to the single\r\nthoughts, sensations, or other mental materials, in their relations or\r\nconnections among themselves. They are said to be "associated" with\r\none another. This way of speaking of the mental materials, instead of\r\nspeaking of the mind\'s activity, is convenient; and it is quite right\r\nto do so, since it is no contradiction to say that the thoughts, etc.,\r\nwhich the mind "apperceives" remain "associated" together. From this\r\nexplanation it is evident that the Association of Ideas also comes\r\nunder the mental process of Apperception of which we have been\r\nspeaking.\r\n\r\nThere is, however, another tendency of the mind in the treatment of\r\nits material, a tendency which shows us in actual operation the\r\nactivity with which we have now become familiar. When we come to look\r\nat any particular case of apperception or association we find that the\r\nprocess must go on from the platform which the mind\'s attainments have\r\nalready reached. The passing of the mental states has been likened to\r\na stream which flows on from moment to moment with no breaks. It is so\r\ncontinuous that we can never say: "I will start afresh, forget the\r\npast, and be uninfluenced by my history." However we may wish this, we\r\ncan never do it; for the oncoming current of the stream is just what\r\nwe speak of as ourselves, and we can not avoid bringing the memories,\r\nimaginations, expectations, disappointments, etc., up to the present.\r\nSo the effect which any new event or experience, happening for the\r\nfirst time, is to have upon us depends upon the way it fits into the\r\ncurrent of these onflowing influences. The man I see for the first\r\ntime may be so neutral to me that I pass him unregarded. But let him\r\nreturn after I have once remarked him, or let him resemble a man whom\r\nI know, or let him give me some reason to observe, fear, revere, think\r\nof him in any way, then he is a positive factor in my stream. He has\r\nbeen taken up into the flow of my mental life, and he henceforth\r\ncontributes something to it.\r\n\r\nFor example, a little child, after learning to draw a man\'s face, with\r\ntwo eyes, the nose and mouth, and one ear on each side, will\r\nafterward, when told to draw a profile, still put in two eyes and\r\naffix an ear to each side. The drift of mental habit tells on the new\r\nresult and he can not escape it.\r\n\r\nHe will still put in the two eyes and two ears when he has before him\r\na copy showing only one ear and neither eye.\r\n\r\nIn all such cases the new is said to be Assimilated to the old. The\r\ncustomary figure for man in the child\'s memory assimilates the\r\nmaterials of the new copy set before him.\r\n\r\nNow this tendency is universal. The mind must assimilate its new\r\nmaterial as much as possible, thus making the old stand for the new.\r\nOtherwise there would be no containing the fragmentary details which\r\nwe should have to remember and handle. Furthermore, it is through this\r\ntendency that we go on to form the great classes of objects--such as\r\nman, animal, virtue--into which numbers of similar details are put,\r\nand which we call General Notions or Concepts.\r\n\r\nWe may understand by Assimilation, therefore, the general tendency of\r\nnew experiences to be treated by us in the ways which similar material\r\nhas been treated before, with the result that the mind proceeds from\r\nthe particular case to the general class.\r\n\r\nSumming up our outcome so far, we find that general psychology has\r\nreached three great principles in its investigation of knowledge.\r\nFirst, we have the combining tendency of the mind, the grouping\r\ntogether and relating of mental states and of things, called\r\n_Apperception_. Then, second, there are the particular relations\r\nestablished among the various states, etc., which are combined; these\r\nare called _Associations_ of Ideas. And, third, there is the tendency\r\nof the mind to use its old experiences and habits as general patterns\r\nor nets for the sorting out and distributing of all the new details of\r\ndaily life; this is called _Assimilation_.\r\n\r\nII. Let us now turn to the second great aspect of the mind, as general\r\nor introspective psychology considers it, the aspect which presents\r\nitself in Action or conduct. The fact that we act is of course as\r\nimportant as the fact that we think or the fact that we feel; and the\r\ndistinction which separates thought and action should not be made too\r\nsharp.\r\n\r\nYet there is a distinction. To understand action we must again go to\r\nintrospection. This comes out as soon as we ask how we reach our\r\nknowledge of the actions of others. Of course, we say at once that we\r\nsee them. And that is true; we do see them, while as to their thoughts\r\nwe only infer them from what we see of their action. But, on the other\r\nhand, we may ask: How do we come to infer this or that thought from\r\nthis or that action of another? The only reply is: Because when we act\r\nin the same way this is the way we feel. So we get back in any case to\r\nour own consciousness and must ask how is this action related to this\r\nthought in our own mind.\r\n\r\nTo this question psychology has now a general answer: Our action is\r\nalways the result of our thought, of the elements of knowledge which\r\nare at the time present in the mind. Of course, there are actions\r\nwhich we do from purely nervous reasons. These are the Instincts,\r\nwhich come up again when we consider the animals. But these we may\r\nneglect so long as we are investigating actions which we consider our\r\nown. Apart from the Instincts, the principle holds that behind every\r\naction which our conduct shows there must be something thought of,\r\nsome sensation or knowledge then in mind, some feeling swelling within\r\nour breast, which prompts to the action.\r\n\r\nThis general principle is Motor Suggestion. It simply means that we\r\nare unable to have any thought or feeling whatever, whether it comes\r\nfrom the senses, from memory, from the words, conduct, or command of\r\nothers, which does not have a direct influence upon our conduct. We\r\nare quite unable to avoid the influence of our own thoughts upon our\r\nconduct, and often the most trivial occurrences of our daily lives act\r\nas suggestions to deeds of very great importance to ourselves and\r\nothers. For example, the influence of the newspaper reports of crime\r\nstimulate other individuals to perform the same crimes by this\r\nprinciple of suggestion; for the fact is that the reading of the\r\nreport causes us to entertain the thoughts, and these thoughts tend to\r\narouse in us their corresponding trains of suggested action.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting and striking sphere of operation of the principle\r\nof Suggestion (of other sorts as well as motor) is what is commonly\r\nknown simply as Hypnotism. To that, as well as to further\r\nillustrations of Suggestion, we will return later on.\r\n\r\nWe are able, however, to see a little more in detail how the law of\r\nMotor Suggestion works by asking what sort of action is prompted in\r\neach case of thought or feeling, at the different levels of the mind\'s\r\nactivity which have been distinguished above as all illustrating\r\nApperception--e.g., the stages known as Perception, Imagination,\r\nReasoning, etc.\r\n\r\nWe act, of course, on our perceptions constantly; most of our routine\r\nlife is made up of such action on the perceptions of objects which lie\r\nabout us. The positions of things in the house, in the streets, in the\r\noffice, in the store, are so well known that we carry out a series of\r\nactions with reference to these objects without much supervision from\r\nour consciousness. Here the law of Motor Suggestion works along under\r\nthe guidance of Perception, Memory, and the Association of Ideas. Then\r\nwe find also, in much of our action, an element due to the exercise of\r\nthe Imagination. We fill in the gaps in the world of perception by\r\nimagining appropriate connections; and we then act as if we knew that\r\nthese imaginations were realities. This is especially true in our\r\nintercourse with our fellow-men. We never really know what they will\r\ndo from time to time. Their action is still future and uncertain; but\r\nfrom our familiarity with their character, we surmise or imagine what\r\nthey expect or think, and we then act so as to make our conduct fit\r\ninto theirs. Here is suggestion of a personal kind which depends upon\r\nour ability, in a sense, to reconstruct the character of others,\r\nleading us out into appropriate action. This is the sphere of the most\r\nimportant affairs of our lives. It appears especially so when we\r\nconsider its connection with the next great sort of action from\r\nsuggestion.\r\n\r\nThis next and highest sphere is action from the general or abstract\r\nthoughts which we have been able to work up by the apperceiving\r\nactivity of the mind. In this sphere we have a special name for those\r\nthoughts which influence us directly and lead us to action: we call\r\nsuch thoughts Motives. We also have a special name for the sort of\r\naction which is prompted by clearly-thought-out motives: Will. But in\r\nspite of this emphasis given to certain actions of ours as springing\r\nfrom what is called Will, we must be careful to see that Will is not a\r\nnew faculty, or capacity, added to mind, and which is different from\r\nthe ways of action which the mind had before the Will arose. Will is\r\nonly a name for the action upon suggestions of conduct which are so\r\nclear in our minds that we are able to deliberate upon them, acting\r\nonly after some reflection, and so having a sense that the action\r\nsprings from our own choice. The real reasons for action, however, are\r\nthoughts, in this case, just as in the earlier cases they were. In\r\nthis case we call them Motives; but we are dependent upon these\r\nMotives, these Suggestions; we can not act without Motives, nor can we\r\nfail to act on those Motives which we have; just as, in the earlier\r\ncases, we could not act without some sort of Perceptions or\r\nImaginations or Memories, and we could not fail to act on the\r\nPerceptions or other mental states which we had. Voluntary action or\r\nWill is therefore only a complex and very highly conscious case of the\r\ngeneral law of Motor Suggestion; it is the form which suggested action\r\ntakes on when Apperception is at its highest level.\r\n\r\nThe converse of Suggestion is also true--that we can not perform an\r\naction without having in the mind at the time the appropriate thought,\r\nor image, or memory to suggest the action. This dependence of action\r\nupon the thought which the mind has at the time is conclusively shown\r\nin certain patients having partial paralysis. These patients find that\r\nwhen the eyes are bandaged they can not use their limbs, and it is\r\nsimply because they can not realize without seeing the limb how it\r\nwould feel to move it; but open the eyes and let them see the\r\nlimb--then they move it freely. A patient can not speak when the\r\ncortex of the brain is injured in the particular spot which is used in\r\nremembering how the words feel or sound when articulated. Many such\r\ncases lead to the general position that for each of our intentional\r\nactions we must have some way of thinking about the action, of\r\nremembering how it feels, looks, etc.; we must have something in mind\r\n_equivalent_ to the experience of the movement. This is called the\r\nprinciple of Kin\xc3\xa6sthetic Equivalents, an expression which loses its\r\nformidable sound when we remember that "kin\xc3\xa6sthetic" means having the\r\nfeeling of movement; so the principle expresses the truth that we must\r\nin every case have some thought or mental picture in mind which is\r\nequivalent to the feeling of the movement we desire to make; if not,\r\nwe can not succeed in making it.\r\n\r\nWhat we mean by the "freedom" of the will is not ability to do\r\nanything without thinking, but ability to think all the alternatives\r\ntogether and to act on this larger thought. Free action is the fullest\r\nexpression of thought and of the Self which thinks it.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to observe the child getting his Equivalents day by\r\nday. He can not perform a new movement simply by wishing to do so; he\r\nhas no Equivalents in his mind to proceed upon. But as he learns the\r\naction, gradually striking the proper movements one by one--oftenest\r\nby imitation, as we will see later on--he stores the necessary\r\nEquivalents up in his memory, and afterward only needs to think how\r\nthe movements feel or look, or how words sound, to be able to make\r\nthe movements or speak the words forthwith.\r\n\r\nIII. Introspection finds another great class of conditions in\r\nexperience, again on the receptive side--conditions which convert the\r\nmind from the mere theatre of indifferent changes into the vitally\r\ninterested, warmly intimate thing which our mental life is to each of\r\nus. This is the sphere of Feeling. We may see without more ado that\r\nwhile we are receiving sensations and thoughts and suggestions, and\r\nacting upon them in the variety of ways already pointed out, we\r\nourselves are not indifferent spectators of this play, this\r\ncome-and-go of processes. We are directly implicated; indeed, the very\r\nsense of a self, an ego, a me-and-mine, in each consciousness, arises\r\nfrom the fact that all this come-and-go is a personal growth. The mind\r\nis not a mere machine doing what the laws of its action prescribe. We\r\nfind that nothing happens which does not affect the mind itself for\r\nbetter or for worse, for richer or for poorer, for pleasure or for\r\npain; and there spring up a series of attitudes of the mind itself,\r\naccording as it is experiencing or expecting to experience what to it\r\nis good or bad. This is, then, the great meaning of Feeling; it is the\r\nsense in the mind that it is itself in some way influenced for good or\r\nfor ill by what goes on within it. It stands midway between thought\r\nand action. We feel with reference to what we think, and we act\r\nbecause we feel. All action is guided by feeling.\r\n\r\nFeeling shows two well-marked characters: first, the Excitement of\r\ntaking a positive attitude; and, second, the Pleasure or Pain that\r\ngoes with it.\r\n\r\nHere, again, it may suffice to distinguish the stages which arise as\r\nwe go from the higher to the lower, from the life of Sensation and\r\nPerception up to that of Thought. This was our method in both of the\r\nother phases of the mental life--Knowledge and Action. Doing this,\r\ntherefore, in the case of Feeling also, we find different terms\r\napplied to the different phases of feeling. In the lowest sort of\r\nmental life, as we may suppose the helpless newborn child to have it,\r\nand as we also think it exists in certain low forms of animal life,\r\nfeeling is not much more than Pleasures and Pains depending largely\r\nupon the physical conditions under which life proceeds. It is likely\r\nthat there are both Pleasures and Pains which are actually sensations\r\nwith special nerve apparatus of their own; and there are also states\r\nof the Comfortable and the Uncomfortable, or of pleasant and\r\nunpleasant feeling, due to the way the mind is immediately affected.\r\nThese are conditions of Excitement added to the Sensations of Pleasure\r\nand Pain.\r\n\r\nComing up to the life of Memory and Imagination, we find many great\r\nclasses of Emotions testifying to the attitudes which the mind takes\r\ntoward its experiences. They are remarkably rich and varied, these\r\nemotions. Hope gives place to its opposite despair, joy to sorrow, and\r\nregret succeeds expectation. No one can enumerate the actual phases of\r\nthe emotional life. The differences which are most pronounced--as\r\nbetween hope and fear, joy and sorrow, anger and love--have special\r\nnames, and their stimulating causes are so constant that they have\r\nalso certain fixed ways of showing themselves in the body, the\r\nso-called emotional Expressions. It is by these that we see and\r\nsympathize with the emotional states of other persons. The most that\r\nwe have room here to say is that there is a constant ebb and flow, and\r\nthat we rarely attain a state of relative freedom from the influence\r\nof emotion.\r\n\r\nThe fixed bodily Expressions of emotion are largely hereditary and\r\ncommon to man and the animals. It is highly probable that they first\r\narose as attitudes useful in the animal\'s environments for defence,\r\nflight, seizure, embrace, etc., and have descended to man as\r\nsurvivals, so becoming indications of states of the mind.\r\n\r\nThe final and highest manifestation of the life of feeling is what we\r\ncall Sentiment. Sentiment is aroused in response to certain so-called\r\nideal states of thought. The trend of mental growth toward constantly\r\ngreater adequacy in its knowledge leads it to anticipate conditions\r\nwhen its attainments will be made complete. There are certain sorts of\r\nreality whose completeness, thus imagined, arouses in us emotional\r\nstates of the greatest power and value. The thought of God gives rise\r\nto the Religious sentiment, that of the good to the Ethical or Moral\r\nsentiment, that of the beautiful to the Esthetic sentiment. These\r\nsentiments represent the most refined and noble fruitage of the life\r\nof feeling, as the thoughts which they accompany refer to the most\r\nelevated and ideal objects. And it is equally true that the conduct\r\nwhich is performed under the inspiration of Sentiment is the noblest\r\nand most useful in which man can engage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nTHE MIND OF THE ANIMAL--COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has already been pointed out that the animal has a very important\r\nshare of the endowment which we call mind. Only recently has he been\r\ngetting his due. He was formerly looked upon, under the teachings of a\r\ndualistic philosophy and of a jealous humanity, as a soulless machine,\r\na mere automaton which was moved by the starting of certain springs to\r\nrun on until the machine ran down. There are two reasons that this\r\nview has been given up, each possibly important enough to have\r\naccomplished the revolution and to have given rise to Animal\r\nPsychology.\r\n\r\nFirst, there is the rise of the evolution theory, which teaches that\r\nthere is no absolute break between man and the higher animals in the\r\nmatter of mental endowment, and that what difference there is must\r\nitself be the result of the laws of mental growth; and the second\r\nreason is that the more adequate the science of the human mind has\r\nbecome the more evident has it also become that man himself is more of\r\na machine than had been supposed. Man grows by certain laws; his\r\nprogress is conditioned by the environment, both physical and social,\r\nin which he lives; his mind is a part of the natural system of things.\r\nSo with the animal. The animal fulfils, as far as he can, the same\r\nsort of function; he has his environment, both physical and social; he\r\nworks under the same laws of growth which man also obeys; his mind\r\nexhibits substantially the same phenomena which the human mind\r\nexhibits in its early stages in the child. All this means that the\r\nanimal has as good right to recognition, as a mind-bearing creature,\r\nso to speak, as the child; and if we exclude him we should also\r\nexclude the child. Further, this also means--what is more important\r\nfor the science of psychology--that the development of the mind in its\r\nearly stages and in certain of its directions of progress is revealed\r\nmost adequately in the animals.\r\n\r\n_Animal Instinct._--Turning to the animals, the first thing to strike\r\nus is the remarkable series of so-called animal Instincts. Everybody\r\nknows what animal instincts are like; it is only necessary to go to a\r\nzo\xc3\xb6logical garden to see them in operation on a large scale. Take the\r\nhouse cat and follow her through the life of a single day, observing\r\nher actions. She washes her face and makes her toilet in the morning\r\nby instinct. She has her peculiar instinctive ways of catching the\r\nmouse for breakfast. She whets her appetite by holding back her meal\r\npossibly for an hour, in the meantime playing most cruelly with the\r\npitiful mouse, letting it run and catching it again, and doing this\r\nover and over. If she has children she attends to their training in\r\nthe details of cat etiquette and custom with the utmost care, all by\r\ninstinct; and the kittens instinctively respond to her attentions. She\r\nconducts herself during the day with remarkable cleanliness of life,\r\nmaking arrangements which civilized man follows with admiration. She\r\nshows just the right abhorrence of water for a creature that is not\r\nable to swim. She knows just what enemies to fly from and when to turn\r\nand fight, using with inborn dexterity her formidable claws. She\r\nprefers nocturnal excursions and sociabilities, having eyes which\r\nmake it safe to be venturesome in the dark. She has certain vocal\r\nexpressions of her emotions, which man in vain attempts to eradicate\r\nwith all the agencies of domestication. She has special arts to\r\nattract her mate, and he in turn is able to charm her with songs which\r\ncharm nobody else. And so on, almost _ad infinitum_.\r\n\r\nObserve the dog, the birds of different species, the monkeys, the\r\nhares, and you find wonderful differences of habit, each adapting the\r\nanimal differently, but with equal effectiveness, to the life which he\r\nin particular is called upon to lead. The ants and bees are\r\nnotoriously expert in the matter of instinct. They have colonies in\r\nwhich some of the latest principles of social organization seem to\r\nfind analogues: slavery, sexual regulations, division of labour,\r\ncentralization of resources, government distribution of food, capital\r\npunishment, etc.\r\n\r\nAll this--not to stop upon details which the books on animal life give\r\nin great abundance--has furnished grounds for speculation for\r\ncenturies, and it is only in the last generation that the outlines of\r\na theory of instinct have been filled in with substantial knowledge. A\r\nrapid sketch of this theory may be drawn in the following pages.\r\n\r\n1. In instinct in general there is a basis of inherited nervous\r\ntendency toward the performance of just the sort of action which the\r\ninstinct exhibits. This nervous tendency shows itself independently of\r\nlearning by the individual in a great many cases, as in the instinct\r\nof sucking by young animals, pecking for food by young fowls, the\r\nmigrating actions of adult mammals and birds, the courting movements\r\nof many varieties of animal species. In all this we have what is\r\ncalled the "perfect" instinct. To be perfect, an instinct must be\r\ncarried out successfully by the animal when his organism is ready,\r\nwithout any instruction, any model to imitate, any experience to go\r\nupon. The "perfect" instincts are entirely congenital or inborn; the\r\nnervous apparatus only needs to reach the proper stage of maturity or\r\ngrowth, and forthwith the instinctive action is performed as soon as\r\nthe external conditions of life are such as to make its performance\r\nappropriate and useful.\r\n\r\n2. On the other hand, many instincts--indeed, probably the greater\r\nnumber--are not perfect, but "imperfect." Imperfect instincts are\r\nthose which do not fully equip the animal with the function in\r\nquestion, but only take him part way to the goal. He has a spontaneous\r\ntendency to do certain things, such as building a nest, singing, etc.;\r\nbut he is not able to do these things adequately or perfectly if left\r\nto himself from birth. This sort of endowment with imperfect instincts\r\nhas been the field of some of the most interesting research in animal\r\npsychology, and has led to a new view of the relation of instinct to\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\n3. It has been found that young animals, birds, etc., depend upon the\r\nexample and instruction of adults for the first performance of many\r\nactions that seem to be instinctive. This dependence may exist even in\r\ncases in which there is yet a congenital tendency to perform the\r\naction. Many birds, for example, have a general instinct to build a\r\nnest; but in many cases, if put in artificial circumstances, they\r\nbuild imperfect nests. Birds also have an instinct to make vocal\r\ncalls; but if kept from birth out of hearing of the peculiar notes of\r\ntheir species, they come to make cries of a different sort, or learn\r\nto make the notes of some other species with which they are thrown.\r\n\r\n4. The principal agency for the learning of the animals, and for the\r\nsupplementing of their instincts, is Imitation. The sight of certain\r\nmovements on the part of the adult animals, or the hearing of their\r\ncries, calls, notes, etc., leads the young to fall into an imitation\r\nof these movements or vocal performances. The endowment which such a\r\nyoung animal has in the direction of making movements and cries\r\nsimilar to those of his species aids him, of course, in imitating\r\nthese in preference to others. So the endowment and the tendency to\r\nimitate directly aid each other in all such functions, and hurry the\r\nlittle creature on in his acquisition of the habits of his species. We\r\nfind young animals clinging even in their imitations pretty closely to\r\ntheir own proper fathers and mothers, who are thus enabled to bring\r\nthem up _comme il faut_.\r\n\r\n5. There is every reason to think, moreover, that the tendency to\r\nimitate is itself instinctive. Young animals, notably the monkey and\r\nthe child, fall spontaneously to imitating when they reach a certain\r\nage. Imitation shows itself to be instinctive in the case of the\r\nmocking bird, the parrot, etc. Furthermore, the mechanism of this\r\nfunction of imitation is now very well known. The principle of\r\npsychology recognised above under the phrase Kin\xc3\xa6sthetic Equivalents,\r\nteaches us that the idea of a movement, coming into the mind through\r\nsight or some other sense, stirs up the proper apparatus to bring\r\nabout the same movement in the observer. This we see in the common\r\ntendency of an audience to repeat the gestures of a speaker, and in\r\nmany similar cases. When this principle is extended to include all\r\nsorts of experiences besides those of movement, we have what is\r\ngenerally called Imitation. Moreover, every time that by action the\r\nchild imitates, he perceives his own imitation, and this again acts as\r\na "copy" or model for another repetition of the act, and so on. This\r\nmethod of keeping himself going gives the young animal or child\r\nconstant practice, and renders him more and more efficient in the acts\r\nnecessary to his life.\r\n\r\n6. It is evident what great profit accrues from this arrangement\r\nwhereby a general instinct like imitation takes the place of a number\r\nof special instincts, or supplements them. It gives a measure of\r\nplasticity to the creature. He can now respond suitably to changes in\r\nthe environment in which he lives. The special instincts, on the\r\ncontrary, are for the most part so fixed that the animal must act just\r\nas they require him to in this or that circumstance; but as soon as\r\nhis instinct takes on the form of imitation, the resulting action\r\ntends to conform itself to the model actions of the other creatures\r\nwhich set "copies" before him.\r\n\r\nThese more or less new results due to recent research in the province\r\nof Instinct have had direct bearing upon theories of the origin of\r\ninstinct and of its place in animal life.\r\n\r\n_Theories of Instinct._--Apart from the older view which saw in animal\r\ninstinct simply a matter of original created endowment, whereby each\r\nanimal was made once for all "after his kind," and according to which\r\nthere is no further reason that the instincts are what they are than\r\nthat they were made so; apart from this "special creation" view, two\r\ndifferent ideas have had currency, both based upon the theory of\r\nevolution. Each of these views assumes that the instincts have been\r\ndeveloped from more simple animal actions by a gradual process; but\r\nthey differ as to the elements originally entering into the actions\r\nwhich afterward became instinctive.\r\n\r\n1. First, there is what is called the Reflex Theory. This holds that\r\ninstincts are reflex actions, like the closing of the eye when an\r\nobject threatens to enter it, only much more complex. They are due to\r\nthe compounding and adding together of simple reflexes, in greater and\r\ngreater number, and with increasing efficiency. This theory attempts\r\nto account for instinct entirely in terms of nervous action. It goes\r\nwith that view of evolution which holds that the nervous system has\r\nhad its growth from generation to generation by the continued reflex\r\nadjustments of the organism to its environment, whereby more and more\r\ndelicate adaptations to the external world were secured. In this way,\r\nsay the advocates of this theory, we may account for the fact that the\r\nanimal has no adequate knowledge of what he is doing when he performs\r\nan act instinctively; he has no end or aim in his mind; he simply\r\nfeels his nervous system doing what it is fitted to do by its organic\r\nadaptations to the stimulations of air, and earth, and sea, whatever\r\nthese may be.\r\n\r\nBut it may be asked: Why do succeeding generations improve each on its\r\nparents, so that there is a gradual tendency to perfect the instinct?\r\n\r\nThe answer to this question brings up another great law of\r\nbiology--the principle of Variations. This principle states the common\r\nfact that in every case of a family of offspring the individual young\r\nvary slightly in all directions from their parents. Admitting this, we\r\nwill find in each group of families some young individuals which are\r\nbetter than their parents; these will have the advantage over others\r\nand will be the ones to grow up and have the children of the next\r\ngeneration again, and so on. So by constant Variation and Natural\r\nSelection--that is, the "Survival of the Fittest" in competition with\r\nthe rest--there will be constant improvement in the Instinct.\r\n\r\n2. The other theory, the rival one, holds that there are some\r\ninstincts which show so plainly the marks of Reason that some degree\r\nof intelligent adjustment to the environment must be allowed to the\r\nanimal in the acquiring of these functions. For example, we are told\r\nthat some of the muscular movements involved in the instincts--such,\r\nfor example, as the bird\'s nest-building--are so complex and so finely\r\nadjusted to an end, that it is straining belief to suppose that they\r\ncould have arisen gradually by reflex adaptation alone. There is also\r\na further difficulty with the reflex theory which has seemed\r\ninsurmountable to many of the ablest psychologists of animal life; the\r\ndifficulty, namely, that many of the instincts require the action of a\r\ngreat many muscles at the same time, so acting in "correlation" with\r\nor support of one another that it is impossible to suppose that the\r\ninstinct has been acquired gradually. For in the very nature of these\r\ncases we can not suppose the instinct to have ever been imperfect,\r\nseeing that the partial instinct which would have preceded the perfect\r\nperformance for some generations would have been not only of no use to\r\nthe creature, but in many cases positively injurious. For instance,\r\nwhat use to an animal to be able partly to make the movements of\r\nswimming, or to the birds to build an inadequate nest? Such instincts\r\nwould not be usable at all. So we are told by the second theory that\r\nthe animals must have had intelligence to do these things when they\r\nfirst acquired them. Yet, as is everywhere admitted, after the\r\ninstinct has been acquired by the species it is then carried out\r\nwithout knowledge and intelligent design, being handed down from\r\ngeneration to generation by heredity.\r\n\r\nThis seems reasonable, for we do find that actions which were at first\r\nintelligent may be performed so frequently that we come to do them\r\nwithout thinking of them; to do them from habit. So the animals, we\r\nare told, have come to do theirs reflexly, although at first they\r\nrequired intelligence. From this point of view--that although\r\nintelligence was at first required, yet the actions have become\r\ninstinctive and lacking in intelligent direction in later\r\ngenerations--this is called the theory of Lapsed Intelligence.\r\n\r\nThis theory has much to commend it. It certainly meets the objection\r\nto the reflex theory which was stated just above--the objection that\r\nsome of the instincts could not have arisen by gradual reflex\r\nadaptations. It also accounts for the extremely intelligent appearance\r\nwhich many instincts have.\r\n\r\nBut this view in turn is liable to a criticism which has grown in\r\nforce with the progress of biological knowledge in recent years. This\r\ncriticism is based on the fact that the theory of lapsed intelligence\r\ndemands that the actions which the animals of one generation have\r\nacquired by their intelligence should be handed down through heredity\r\nto the next generation, and so on. It is evident that unless this be\r\ntrue it does no good to the species for one generation to do things\r\nintelligently, seeing that if the effects on the nervous system are\r\nnot transmitted to their children, then the next and later generations\r\nwill have to start exactly where their fathers did, and the actions in\r\nquestion will never become ingrained in the nervous system at all.\r\n\r\nNow, the force of this criticism is overwhelming to those who\r\nbelieve--as the great majority of biologists now do[1]--that none of\r\nthe modifications or so-called "characters" acquired by the parents,\r\nnone of the effects of use or disuse of their limbs, none of the\r\ntendencies or habits of action, in short, none of the changes wrought\r\nin body or mind of the parents during their lifetime, are inherited by\r\ntheir children. The only sorts of modification which show themselves\r\nin subsequent generations are the deep-seated effects of disease,\r\npoison, starvation, and other causes which concern the system as a\r\nwhole, but which show no tendency to reproduce by heredity any of the\r\nspecial actions or functions which the fathers and mothers may have\r\nlearned and practised. If this difficulty could be met, the theory\r\nthat intelligence has been at work in the origination of the complex\r\ninstincts would be altogether the preferable one of the two; but if\r\nnot, then the "lapsed intelligence" view must be thrown overboard.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The matter is still under discussion, however, and I do\r\nnot mean in any way to deny the authority of those who still accept\r\nthe "inheritance of acquired characters."]\r\n\r\nRecent discussion of evolution has brought out a point of view under\r\nthe name of Organic Selection which has a very fruitful application to\r\nthis controversy over the origin of instincts. This point of view is\r\none which in a measure reconciles the two theories. It claims that it\r\nis possible for the intelligent adaptations, or any sort of\r\n"accommodations," made by the individuals of one generation, to set\r\nthe direction of subsequent evolution, even though there be no direct\r\ninheritance of acquired characters from father to son. It proceeds in\r\nthe case of instinct somewhat thus:\r\n\r\nSuppose we say, with the first theory given above, that the organism\r\nhas certain reflexes which show some degree of adaptation to the\r\nenvironment; then suppose we admit the point, urged by the advocates\r\nof the lapsed intelligence theory, that the gradual improvement of\r\nthese reflexes by variations in the endowment of successive\r\ngenerations would not suffice for the origin of instinct, seeing that\r\npartial instincts would not be useful; and, further, suppose we agree\r\nthat many of the complex instincts really involved intelligent\r\nadaptation in their acquisition. These points carefully understood,\r\nthen one new and further principle will enable us to complete a theory\r\nwhich will avoid the objections to both the others. This principle is\r\nnothing else than what we have seen already--namely, that the\r\nintelligence supplements the partial instincts in each generation and\r\nmakes them useful in the respects in which they are inadequate, and so\r\nkeeps the young alive in successive generations as long as the\r\ninstinct is imperfect. This gives the species time gradually to\r\nsupplement its instinctive endowment, in the course of many\r\ngenerations each of which uses its intelligence in the same way: time\r\nto accumulate, by the occurrence of variations among the offspring,\r\nthe changes in the nervous system which the perfect instinct requires.\r\nThus as time goes on the dependence of each generation upon the aid of\r\nintelligence is less and less, until the nervous system becomes\r\ncapable of performing the function quite alone. The result then will\r\nbe the same as if the acquisitions made by each generation had been\r\ninherited, while in reality they have not. All that this theory\r\nrequires in addition to what is admitted by both the historical views\r\nis that the species be kept alive long enough by the aid of its\r\nintelligence, which supplements imperfect instincts, to give it time\r\nto produce sufficient variations in the right direction. The instinct\r\nthen achieves its independence, and intelligent supervision of it is\r\nno longer necessary (see Fig. 1).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1,--Origin of instinct by Organic Selection: _A\r\nn_, perfect instinct. 1, 2 ... _n_, successive generations. Solid\r\nlines, nervous equipment in the direction of the instinct. Dotted\r\nlines, intelligence supplementing the nervous equipment. The\r\nintelligence is relied upon to keep the species alive until by\r\ncongenital variations the nervous equipment becomes "perfect."]\r\n\r\nThis theory is directly confirmed by the facts, already spoken of,\r\nwhich show that many instincts are imperfect, but are pieced out and\r\nmade effective by the intelligent imitations and acquisitions of the\r\nyoung creatures. The little chick, for example, does not know the\r\nvalue of water when he sees it, as essential as water is to his life;\r\nbut he depends upon imitation of his mother\'s drinking, or upon the\r\nmere accident of wetting his bill, to stimulate his partial instinct\r\nof drinking in the peculiar fashion characteristic of fowls, by\r\nthrowing back the head. So in other functions which are peculiar to a\r\nspecies and upon which their very lives depend, we find the delicate\r\nadjustment between intelligent adaptation by conscious action and the\r\npartially formed instincts which the creatures possess.\r\n\r\nIn the theory of Organic Selection, therefore, we seem to have a\r\npositive solution of the question of the origin of instinct. It is\r\ncapable of a similar application in other cases where evolution has\r\ntaken certain definite directions, seemingly guided by intelligence.\r\nIt shows us that mind has had a positive place in the evolution of\r\norganic nature.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_Animal Intelligence._--Coming to consider what further equipment the\r\nanimals have, we light upon the fact just spoken of when we found it\r\nnecessary to appeal in some measure to the animal\'s Intelligence to\r\nsupplement his instincts. What is meant by Intelligence?\r\n\r\nThis word may be used in the broad sense of denoting all use of\r\nconsciousness, or mind, considered as a thing in some way additional\r\nto the reflexes of the nervous system. In the life of the animal, as\r\nin that of man, wherever we find the individual doing anything with\r\nreference to a mental picture, using knowledge or experience in any\r\nform, then he is said to be acting intelligently.\r\n\r\nThe simplest form of intelligent action in the animal world and that\r\nfrom which most of the higher forms have arisen is illustrated in the\r\nfollowing example: a chick will peck at a strange worm, and, finding\r\nit unpalatable, will then in the future refuse to peck at worms of\r\nthat sort. This refusal to do a second time what has once had a\r\ndisagreeable result is intelligent. We now say that the chick "knows"\r\nthat the worm is not good to eat. The instinctive action of pecking at\r\nall worms is replaced by a refusal to peck at certain worms. Again,\r\ntaking the reverse case, we find that the chick which did not respond\r\nto the sight of drinking water instinctively, but had to see the\r\nmother drink first, acted intelligently, or through a state of\r\nconsciousness, when it imitated the old hen, and afterward drank of\r\nits own accord. It now "knows" that water is the thing to drink.\r\n\r\nThe further question which comes upon us here concerns the animal\'s\r\nacquisition of the action appropriate to carry out his knowledge. How\r\ndoes he learn the muscular combinations which supplement or replace\r\nthe earlier instinctive ways of acting?\r\n\r\nThis question appears very clearly when we ask about the child\'s\r\nacquisition of new acts of skill. We find him constantly learning,\r\nmodifying his habits, refining his ways of doing things, becoming\r\npossessed of quite new and complex functions, such as speech,\r\nhandwriting, etc. All these are intelligent activities; they are\r\nlearned very gradually and with much effort and pains. It is one of\r\nthe most important and interesting questions of all psychology to ask\r\nhow he manages to bring the nervous and muscular systems under greater\r\nand greater control by his mind. How can he modify and gradually\r\nimprove his "reactions"--as we call his responses to the things and\r\nsituations about him--so as to act more and more intelligently?\r\n\r\nThe answer seems to be that he proceeds by what has been called\r\nExperimenting. He does not simply do things because he has\r\nintelligence,--simply that is, because he sees how to do them without\r\nfirst learning how; that is the older and probably quite erroneous\r\nview of intelligence. The mind can not move the body simply by its\r\nfiat. No man can do that. Man, like the little animal, has to try\r\nthings and keep on trying things, in order to find out the way they\r\nwork and what their possibilities are. And each animal, man, beast, or\r\nbird has to do it for himself. Apart from the instinctive actions\r\nwhich the child does without knowing their value at all, and apart\r\nfrom the equally instinctive imitative way of doing them without\r\naiming at learning more by the imitations, he proceeds in all cases to\r\nmake experiments. Generally his experiments work through acts of\r\nimitation. He imitates what he sees some other creature do; or he\r\nimitates his own instinctive actions by setting up before him in his\r\nmind the memories of the earlier performance; or, yet again, after he\r\nhas struck a fortunate combination, he repeats that imitatively. Thus,\r\nby the principle already spoken of, he stores up a great mass of\r\nKin\xc3\xa6sthetic Equivalents, which linger in memory, and enable him to\r\nact appropriately when the proper circumstances come in his way. He\r\nalso gets what we have called Associations established between the\r\nacts and the pleasure or pain which they give, and so avoids the\r\npainful and repeats the pleasurable ones.\r\n\r\nThe most fruitful field of this sort of imitative learning is in\r\nconnection with the "try-try-again" struggles of the young, especially\r\nchildren. This is called Persistent Imitation. The child sees before\r\nhim some action to imitate--some complex act of manipulation with the\r\nhand, let us say. He tries to perform it in an experimental way, using\r\nthe muscles of the hand and arm. With this he strains himself all\r\nover, twisting his tongue, bending his body, and grimacing from head\r\nto foot, so to speak. Thus he gets a certain way toward the correct\r\nresult, but very crudely and inexactly. Then he tries again,\r\nproceeding now on the knowledge which the first effort gave him; and\r\nhis trial is less uncouth because he now suppresses some of the\r\nhindering grimacing movements and retains the ones which he sees to be\r\nmost nearly correct. Again he tries, and again, persistently but\r\ngradually reducing the blundering movements to the pattern of the\r\ncopy, and so learning to perform the act of skill.\r\n\r\nThe massive and diffused movements which he makes by wriggling and\r\nfussing are also of direct use to him. They increase remarkably the\r\nchances that among them all there will be some movements which will\r\nhit the mark, and so contribute to his stock of correct Equivalents.\r\nDogs and monkeys learn to unlock doors, let down fence rails, and\r\nperform relatively complex actions by experimenting; persistently\r\nwith many varied movements until the successful ones are finally\r\nstruck.\r\n\r\nThis is the type of all those acts of experimenting by which new\r\ncomplex movements are acquired. In children it proceeds largely\r\nwithout interference from others; the child persists of himself. He\r\nhas greater ability than the animals to see the meaning of the\r\ncompleted act and to really desire to acquire it. With the animals the\r\nacquisitions do not extend very far, on account of their limitation in\r\nintelligent endowment; but in the training of the domestic animals and\r\nin the education of show-animals the trainer aids them and urges them\r\non by making use of the associations of pleasure and pain spoken of\r\nabove. He supplements the animal\'s feelings of pain and pleasure with\r\nthe whip and with rewards of food, etc., so that each step of the\r\nanimal\'s success or failure has acute associations with pain or\r\npleasure. Thus the animal gradually gets a number of associations\r\nformed, avoids the actions with which pain is associated, repeats\r\nthose which call up memories of pleasure all the way through an\r\nextended performance in regular steps; and in the result the\r\nperformance so closely counterfeits the operations of high\r\nintelligence--such as counting, drawing cards, etc.--that the audience\r\nis excited to admiration.\r\n\r\nThis first glimpse of the animal\'s limitations when compared with man\r\nmay suggest the general question, how far the brutes go in their\r\nintelligent endowment. The proper treatment of this much-debated point\r\nrequires certain further explanations.\r\n\r\nIn the child we find a tendency to act in certain ways toward all\r\nobjects, events, etc., which are in any respect alike. After learning\r\nto use the hands, for example, for a certain act, the same hand\r\nmovements are afterward used for other similar acts which the child\r\nfinds it well to perform. He thus tends, as psychologists say, to\r\n"generalize," that is, to take up certain general attitudes which will\r\nanswer for a great many details of experience. On the side of the\r\nreception of his items of knowledge this was called Assimilation, as\r\nwill be remembered. This saves him enormous trouble and risk; for as\r\nsoon as an object or situation presents itself before him with certain\r\ngeneral aspects, he can at once take up the attitude appropriate to\r\nthese general aspects without waiting to learn the particular features\r\nof the new. The ability to do this shows itself in two rather\r\ndifferent ways which seem respectively to characterize man on the one\r\nhand and the lower animals on the other.\r\n\r\nWith the animals this tendency to generalize, to treat objects in\r\nclasses rather than as individuals, takes the form of a sort of\r\ncomposition or direct union of brain pathways. Different experiences\r\nare had, and then because they are alike they tend to issue in the\r\nsame channels of action. The animal is tied down strictly to his\r\nexperience; he does not anticipate to any extent what is going to\r\nhappen. He does not use one experience as a symbol and apply it\r\nbeforehand to other things and events. He is in a sense passive;\r\nstimulations rain down upon him, and force him into certain attitudes\r\nand ways of action. As far as his knowledge is "general" it is called\r\na Recept. A dog has a Recept of the whip; so far as whips are not too\r\ndifferent from one another, the dog will act in the same way toward\r\nall of them. In man, on the other hand, the development of mind has\r\ngone a decided step further. The child very quickly begins to use\r\nsymbols, words being the symbols of first importance to him. He does\r\nnot have, like the brute, to wait for successive experiences of like\r\nobjects to impress themselves upon him; but he goes out toward the\r\nnew, expecting it to be like the old, and so acting as to anticipate\r\nit. He thus falls naturally into general ways of acting which it is\r\nthe function of experience to refine and distinguish. He seems to have\r\nmore of the higher sort of what was called above Apperception, as\r\nopposed to the more concrete and accidental Associations of Ideas. He\r\ngets Concepts, as opposed to the Recepts of the animals. With this\r\ngoes the development of speech, which some psychologists consider the\r\nsource of all the man\'s superiority over the animals. Words become\r\nsymbols of a highly abstract sort for certain classes of experiences;\r\nand, moreover, through speech a means of social communication is\r\nafforded by which the development of the individual is enormously\r\nadvanced.\r\n\r\nIt is probable, in fact, that this difference--that between the\r\nGeneralization which uses symbols, and mere Association--is the root\r\nof all the differences that follow later on, and give man the\r\nmagnificent advantage over the animals which he has. From it is\r\ndeveloped the faculty of thinking, reasoning, etc., in which man\r\nstands practically alone. On the brain side, it requires special\r\ndevelopments both through the preparation of certain brain centres\r\ngiven over to the speech function, and also through the greater\r\norganization of the gray matter of the cerebral cortex, to which we\r\nrevert again in a later chapter. Indeed, looked at from the side of\r\nthe development of the brain, we see that there is no break between\r\nman and the animals in the laws of organization, but that the\r\ndifference is one of evolution.\r\n\r\nLater on in the life of the child we find another contrast connected\r\nwith the difference of social life and organization as between the\r\nanimals and man. The animals probably do not have a highly organized\r\nsense of Self as man does; and the reason doubtless is that such a\r\nSelf-consciousness is the outcome of life and experience in the very\r\ncomplex social relations in which the human child is brought up, and\r\nwhich he alone is fitted by his inherited gifts to sustain.\r\n\r\n_The Play of Animals._--Another of the most interesting questions of\r\nanimal life is that which concerns their plays. Most animals are given\r\nto play. Indeed that they indulge in a remarkable variety of sports is\r\nwell known even to the novice in the study of their habits. Beginning\r\nwhen very young, they gambol, tussle, leap, and run together, chase\r\none another, play with inanimate objects, as the kitten with the ball,\r\njoin in the games of children and adults, as the dog which plays hide\r\nand seek with his little master, and all with a knowingness and zest\r\nwhich makes them the best of companions. The volumes devoted to the\r\nsubject give full accounts of these plays of animals, and we need not\r\nrepeat them; the psychologist is interested, however, mainly in the\r\ngeneral function of play in the life of the individual animal and\r\nchild, and in the psychological states and motives which it reveals.\r\nPlay, whether in animals or in man, shows certain general\r\ncharacteristics which we may briefly consider.\r\n\r\n1. The plays of animals are very largely instinctive, being indulged\r\nin for the most part without instruction. The kitten leaps impulsively\r\nto the game. Little dogs romp untaught, and fall, as do other animals\r\nalso, when they are strong enough, into all the playful attitudes\r\nwhich mark their kind. This is seen strikingly among adult animals in\r\nwhat are called the courtship plays. The birds, for example, indulge\r\nin elaborate and beautiful evolutions of a playful sort at the mating\r\nseason.\r\n\r\n2. It follows from their instinctive character that animal plays are\r\npeculiar to the species which perform them. We find series of sports\r\npeculiar to dogs, others to cats, and so on through all the species of\r\nthe zo\xc3\xb6logical garden, whether the creatures be wild or tame. Each\r\nshows its species as clearly by its sportive habits as by its shape,\r\ncry, or any other of what are called its "specific" habits. This is\r\nimportant not only to the zo\xc3\xb6logist, as indicating differences of\r\nevolution and scale of attainment, environment, etc., but also to the\r\npsychologist, as indicating differences of what we may call animal\r\ntemperament. Animals show not only the individual differences which\r\nhuman beings do, one liking this game and another that, one being\r\nleader in the sport and another the follower, but also the greater\r\ndifferences which characterize races. The Spaniards love the bull\r\nfight; other nations consider it repulsive, and take their fun in less\r\nbrutal forms, although, perchance, they tolerate Rugby football! So\r\nthe animals vary in their tastes, some playing incessantly at\r\nfighting, and so zealously as to injure one another, while others\r\nlike the milder romp, and the game with flying leaves, rolling stones,\r\nor the incoming waves on the shore.\r\n\r\n3. Psychologically, the most interesting characteristic of animal, as\r\nof human, play is what is called the "make-believe" state of mind\r\nwhich enters into it. If we consider our own sports we find that, in\r\nthe midst of the game, we are in a condition of divided consciousness.\r\nWe indulge in the scheme of play, whatever it be, as if it were a real\r\nsituation, at the same time preserving our sense that it is not real.\r\nThat is, we distinguish through it all the actual realities, but make\r\nthe convention with our companions that for the time we will act\r\ntogether as if the playful situation were real. With it there is a\r\nsense that it is a matter of voluntary indulgence that can stop at\r\nanytime; that the whole temporary illusion to which we submit is\r\nstrictly our own doing, a job which we have "put up" on ourselves.\r\nThat is what is meant by make-believe.\r\n\r\nNow it is clear that the animals have this sense of make-believe in\r\ntheir games both with other animals and with man. The dog plays at\r\nbiting the hand of his master, and actually takes the member between\r\nhis teeth and mumbles it; but all the while he stops short of painful\r\npressure, and goes through a series of characteristic attitudes which\r\nshow that he distinguishes very clearly between this play biting and\r\nthe real. If perchance the master shows signs of being hurt, the dog\r\nfalls into attitudes of sorrow, and apologizes fulsomely. So also when\r\nthe animals play together, a vigorous squeal from a companion who is\r\n"under" generally brings him his release.\r\n\r\nThe principal interest of this make-believe consciousness is that it\r\nis considered by many to be an essential ingredient of \xc3\x86sthetic\r\nfeeling. A work of art is said to have its effect through its tendency\r\nto arouse in us a make-believe acceptance of the scene or motive\r\npresented, while it nevertheless remains contrasted with the realities\r\nof our lives. If this be true, the interesting question arises how far\r\nthe animals also have the germs of \xc3\x86sthetic feeling in their\r\nmake-believe situations. Does the female pea-fowl consider the male\r\nbird, with all his display of colour and movement, a beautiful object?\r\nAnd does the animal companion say: How beautiful! when his friend in\r\nthe sport makes a fine feint, and comes up serene with the knowing\r\nlook, which the human on-looker can not fail to understand?\r\n\r\nIn some cases, at any rate, we should have to reply to this question\r\naffirmatively, if we considered make-believe the essential thing in\r\n\xc3\xa6sthetic enjoyment.\r\n\r\n_Theories of Animal Play._--The question of the meaning and value of\r\nplay to the animals has had very enlightening discussion of late.\r\nThere are two principal theories now advocated.\r\n\r\nI. The older theory considered play simply the discharge of surplus\r\nnerve force in the animal\'s organism. He was supposed to play when he\r\nfelt fresh and vigorous. The horse is "skittish" and playful in the\r\nmorning, not so much so at night. The dogs lie down and rest when they\r\nare tired, having used up their surplus energies. This is called the\r\nSurplus-Energy Theory of play.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty with this theory is that it is not adequate to explain\r\nany of the characteristics of play which have been given above. Why\r\nshould play be instinctive in its forms, showing certain complex and\r\ningrained channels of expression, if it were merely the discharge of\r\nsurplus force? We are more lively in the morning, but that does not\r\nexplain our liking and indulging in certain sorts of complex games at\r\nall hours. Moreover, animals and children will continue to play when\r\ngreatly fatigued. A dog, for example, which seems absolutely "used\r\nup," can not resist the renewed solicitations of his friends to\r\ncontinue the chase. Furthermore, why is it that plays are\r\ncharacteristic of species, different kinds of animals having plays\r\nquite peculiar to themselves? It is difficult to see how this could\r\nhave come about unless there had been some deeper-going reason in\r\naccordance with which each species has learned the particular forms of\r\nsport in which it indulges.\r\n\r\nThe advocates of this theory attempt to meet these objections by\r\nsaying that the imitative instinct accounts for the particular\r\ndirections in which the discharges of energy occur. A kitten\'s plays\r\nare like those of the cat tribe because the kitten is accustomed to\r\nimitate cats; when it falls to playing it is with cats, and so it\r\nsheds its superfluous energies in the customary imitative channels. In\r\nthis way it grows to learn the games of its own species. There is a\r\ngood deal in this point; most games are imitative in so far as they\r\nare learned at all. But it does not save the theory; for many animal\r\nplays are not learned by the individual at all, as we have seen above;\r\non the contrary, they are instinctive. In these cases the animal does\r\nnot wait to learn the games of his tribe by imitation, but\r\nstarts-right-in on his own account. Besides this there are many forms\r\nof animal play which are not imitative at all. In these the animals\r\nco-operate, but do not take the same parts. The young perform actions\r\nin the game which the mother does not.\r\n\r\nAll this goes to support another and most serious objection to this\r\ntheory--in the mind of all those who believe in the doctrine of\r\nevolution. The Surplus-Energy Theory considers the play-impulse, which\r\nis one of the most widespread characters of animal life, as merely an\r\naccidental thing or by-product--a mere using-up of surplus energies.\r\nIt is not in any way important to the animals. This makes it\r\nimpossible to say that play has come to be the very complex thing that\r\nit really is by the laws of evolution; for survival by natural\r\nselection always supposes that the attribute or character which\r\nsurvives is important enough to keep the animal alive in the struggle\r\nfor existence; otherwise it would not be continued for successive\r\ngenerations, and gradually perfected on account of its utility.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, therefore, we find the Surplus-Energy Theory of play\r\nquite inadequate.\r\n\r\nII. Another theory therefore becomes necessary if we are to meet these\r\ndifficulties. Such a theory has recently been developed. It holds that\r\nthe plays of the animals are of the greatest utility to them in this\r\nway: they exercise the young animals in the very activities--though in\r\na playful way--in which they must seriously engage later on in life. A\r\nsurvey of the plays of animals with a view to comparing them in each\r\ncase with the adult activities of the same species, confirms this\r\ntheory in a remarkably large number of cases. It shows the young\r\nanticipating, in their play, the struggles, enjoyments, co-operations,\r\ndefeats, emergencies, etc., of their after lives, and by learning to\r\ncope with all these situations, so preparing themselves for the\r\nserious onset of adult responsibilities. On this theory each play\r\nbecomes a beautiful case of adaptation to nature. The kitten plays\r\nwith the ball as the old cat handles the mouse; the little dogs\r\nwrestle together, and so learn to fight with teeth and claws; the deer\r\nrun from one another, and so test their speed and learn to escape\r\ntheir enemies. If we watch young animals at play we see that not a\r\nmuscle or nerve escapes this preliminary training and exercise; and\r\nthe instinctive tendencies which control the play direct the\r\nactivities into just the performances which the animal\'s later\r\nlife-habits are going on to require.\r\n\r\nOn this view play becomes of the utmost utility. It is not a\r\nby-product, but an essential part of the animal\'s equipment. Just as\r\nthe infancy period has been lengthened in the higher animals in order\r\nto give the young time to learn all that they require to meet the\r\nharsh conditions of life, so during this infancy period they have in\r\nthe play-instinct a means of the first importance for making good use\r\nof their time. It is beautiful to see the adults playing with their\r\nyoung, adapting their strength to the little ones, repeating the same\r\nexercises without ceasing, drilling them with infinite pains to\r\ngreater hardihood, endurance, and skill.\r\n\r\nOn this theory it is also easy to see why it is that the plays are\r\ndifferent for the different species. The actual life conditions are\r\ndifferent, and the habits of the species are correspondingly\r\ndifferent. So it is only another argument for the truth of this theory\r\nthat we find just those games natural to the young which train them\r\nin the habits natural to the old.\r\n\r\nThis view is now being very generally adopted. Many fine illustrations\r\nmight be cited. A simple case may be seen in so small a thing as the\r\nhabit of leaping in play; the difference, for example, between the\r\nmountain goat and the common fawn. The former, when playing on level\r\nground makes a very ludicrous exhibition by jumping in little\r\nup-and-down leaps by which he makes no progress. In contrast with this\r\nthe fawn, whose adult life is normally in the plains, takes a long\r\ngraceful spring. The difference becomes clear from the point of view\r\nof this theory, when we remember that the goat is to live among the\r\nrocks, where the only useful jump is just the up-and-down sort which\r\nthe little fellow is now practising; while the deer, in his life upon\r\nthe plains, will always need the running jump.\r\n\r\nFinally, on this theory, play becomes a thing for evolution to\r\ncultivate for its utility in the progress of animal life, and for that\r\nreason we may suppose it has been perfected in the remarkable variety\r\nand beauty of form which it shows.\r\n\r\nOn the psychological side, we find a corresponding state of things.\r\nThe mind in the young animal or child gets the main education of early\r\nlife through its play situations. Games have an extraordinary\r\npedagogical influence. The more so because they are the natural and\r\ninstinctive way of getting an education in practical things. This\r\nagain is of supreme utility to the individuals.\r\n\r\nBoth for body and mind we find that play illustrates the principle of\r\nOrganic Selection explained above. It makes the young animal flexible,\r\nplastic, and adaptable; it supplements all his other instincts and\r\nimperfect functions; it gives him a new chance to live, and so\r\ndetermines the course of evolution in the direction which the playful\r\nanimal represents. The quasi-social and gregarious habits of animals\r\nprobably owe much of their strength to the play-impulse, both through\r\nthe training of individual animals and through the fixing of these\r\ntendencies as instincts in various animal species in the way just\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nIn another place below I analyze a child\'s game and draw some\r\ninferences from it. Here it may suffice to say that in their games the\r\nyoung animals acquire the flexibility of mind and muscle upon which\r\nmuch of the social co-operation, as well as the individual\r\neffectiveness, of their later life depends. With children, it is not\r\nthe only agency, of course, though its importance is not less. We have\r\nto carry the children further by other means; but the other means\r\nshould never interfere with this natural schooling. They should aim\r\nthe rather by supplementing it wisely to direct its operation and to\r\nextend its sphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nTHE MIND OF THE CHILD--CHILD PSYCHOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting chapters of modern psychology is that\r\nwhich deals with the child. This is also one of the topics of general\r\nconcern, since our common humanity reacts with greater geniality upon\r\nthe little ones, in whom we instinctively see innocence and\r\nsimplicity. The popular interest in children has been, however--as\r\nuncharitable as it may seem to say it--of very little service to the\r\nscientific investigation of childhood. Even to-day, when a greater\r\nbody of valuable results are being secured, the main danger to the\r\nproper study of the child\'s mind comes from the over-enthusiasm and\r\nuninstructed assurance of some of its friends. Especially is this the\r\ncase in America, where "child study" has become a fad to be pursued by\r\nparents and teachers who know little about the principles of\r\nscientific method, and where influential educators have enlisted\r\nso-called "observers" in taking indiscriminate notes on the doings of\r\nchildren with no definite problem in view, and with no criticism of\r\ntheir procedure. It is in place, therefore, to say clearly, at the\r\noutset, that this chapter does not mean to stimulate parents or\r\nunpsychological readers to report observations; and further to say\r\nalso that in the mind of the writer the publications made lately of\r\nlarge numbers of replies to "syllabi" are for the most part worthless,\r\nbecause they heap together observations obtained by persons of every\r\ndegree of competence and incompetence.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the requisites here, as in every other sphere of\r\nexact observation, are clear enough. The student of the child\'s mind\r\nshould have a thorough knowledge of the principles of general\r\npsychology, in order to know what is characteristic of the child when\r\nhe sees it, and what is exceptional; and he should also have enough\r\noriginality in his ideas and interpretations to catch the valuable in\r\nthe child\'s doings, distinguishing it from the commonplace, and to\r\nplan situations and even experiments which will give him some control\r\nupon those actions of the child which seem to be worth it. The need\r\nof these qualities is seen in the history of the problems of the\r\nchild\'s growth which have been taken up even by the most competent\r\npsychologists. The results show a gradual attainment of control over\r\nthe problem in hand, each observer criticising the method and results\r\nof his predecessor until certain rules of observation and experiment\r\nhave been evolved which allow of the repetition and repeated\r\nobservation of the events of the child\'s life.\r\n\r\nAs illustrating the sort of problems in which there has been this\r\ncareful and critical work, I may instance these: the child\'s reflex\r\nmovements, the beginnings and growth of sensation, such as colour, the\r\nrise of discrimination and preference, the origin of right and\r\nleft-handedness, the rise, mechanism, and meaning of imitation, the\r\nacquisition of speech and handwriting, the growth of the child\'s sense\r\nof personality and of his social consciousness, and the laws of\r\nphysical growth, as bearing upon mental development. In all these\r\ncases, however, there is again a greater and a less exactness. The\r\ntopics with the reports of results which I am going on to give may be\r\ntaken, however, as typical, and as showing the direction of complete\r\nknowledge rather than as having in any one case approached it.\r\n\r\nBefore we take up particular questions, however, a word may be allowed\r\nupon the general bearings of the study of the child\'s mind. I do this\r\nthe more willingly, since it is still true, in spite of the hopeful\r\noutlook for positive results, that it is mainly the willingness of\r\npsychology to recognise the problems and work at them that makes the\r\ntopic important at present. To investigate the child by scientific\r\nmethods is really to bring into psychology a procedure which has\r\nrevolutionized the natural sciences; and it is destined to\r\nrevolutionize the moral sciences by making them also in a great\r\nmeasure natural sciences. The new and important question about the\r\nmind which is thus recognised is this: _How did it grow?_ What light\r\nupon its activity and nature can we get from a positive knowledge of\r\nits early stages and processes of growth? This at once introduces\r\nother questions: How is the growth of the child related to that of the\r\nanimals?--how, through heredity and social influences, to the growth\r\nof the race and of the family and society in which he is brought up?\r\nAll this can be comprehended only in the light of the doctrine of\r\nevolution, which has rejuvenated the sciences of life; and we are now\r\nbeginning to see a rejuvenation of the sciences of mind from the same\r\npoint of view. This is what is meant when we hear it said that\r\npsychology is becoming "genetic."\r\n\r\nThe advantages to be derived from the study of young children from\r\nthis point of view may be briefly indicated.\r\n\r\n1. In the first place, the facts of the infant consciousness are very\r\nsimple; that is, they are the child\'s sensations or memories simply,\r\nnot his own observations of them. In the adult mind the disturbing\r\ninfluence of self-observation is a matter of notorious moment. It is\r\nimpossible for me to report exactly what I feel, for the observation\r\nof it by my attention alters its character. My volition also is a\r\ncomplex thing, involving my personal pride and self-consciousness. But\r\nthe child\'s emotion is as spontaneous as a spring. The effects of it\r\nin the mental life come out in action, pure and uninfluenced by\r\ncalculation and duplicity and adult reserve. There is around every one\r\nof us adults a web of convention and prejudice of our own making. Not\r\nonly do we reflect the social formalities of our environment, and thus\r\nlose the distinguishing spontaneities of childhood, but each of us\r\nbuilds up his own little world of seclusion and formality with\r\nhimself. We are subject, as Bacon said, not only to "idols of the\r\nforum," but also to "idols of the den."\r\n\r\nThe child, on the contrary, has not learned his own importance, his\r\npedigree, his beauty, his social place, his religion; he has not\r\nobserved himself through all these and countless other lenses of time,\r\nplace, and circumstance. He has not yet turned himself into an idol nor\r\nthe world into a temple; and we can study him apart from the complex\r\naccretions which are the later deposits of his self-consciousness.\r\n\r\n2. The study of children is often the only means of testing the truth\r\nof our analyses. If we decide that a certain mental state is due to a\r\nunion of simpler elements, then we may appeal to the proper period of\r\nchild life to see the union taking place. The range of growth is so\r\nenormous from the infant to the adult, and the beginnings of the\r\nchild\'s mental life are so low in the scale, in the matter of mental\r\nendowment, that there is hardly a question of analysis now under\r\ndebate in psychology which may not be tested by this method.\r\n\r\nAt this point it is that child psychology is more valuable than the\r\nstudy of the mind of animals. The latter never become men, while\r\nchildren do. The animals represent in some few respects a branch of\r\nthe tree of growth in advance of man, while being in many other\r\nrespects very far behind him. In studying animals we are always\r\nhaunted by the fear that the analogy from him to man may not hold;\r\nthat some element essential to the development of the human mind may\r\nnot be in the animal at all. Even in such a question as the\r\nlocalization of the functions of the brain described later on, where\r\nthe analogy is one of comparative anatomy and only secondarily of\r\npsychology, the monkey presents analogies with man which dogs do not.\r\nBut in the study of children we may be always sure that a normal child\r\nhas in him the promise of a normal man.\r\n\r\n3. Again, in the study of the child\'s mind we have the added advantage\r\nof a corresponding simplicity on the bodily side; we are able to take\r\naccount of the physiological processes at a time when they are\r\nrelatively simple--that is, before the nervous system has grown to\r\nmaturity. For example, psychology used to hold that we have a "speech\r\nfaculty," an inborn mental endowment which is incapable of further\r\nanalysis; but support for the position is wanting when we turn to the\r\nbrain of the infant. Not only do we fail to find the series of centres\r\nnow known to be the "speech zone," but even those of them which we do\r\nfind have not yet taken up this function, either alone or together. In\r\nother words, the primary object of each of the various centres\r\ninvolved is not speech, but some other and simpler function; and\r\nspeech arises by development from a union of these separate functions.\r\n\r\n4. In observing young children, a more direct application of\r\nexperiment is possible. By "experiment" here I mean both experiment\r\non the senses and also experiment directly on consciousness by\r\nsuggestion, social influence, etc. In experimenting on adults, great\r\ndifficulties arise through the fact that reactions--such as performing\r\na voluntary movement when a signal is heard, etc.--are complicated by\r\ndeliberation, habit, custom, choice, etc. The subject hears a sound,\r\nidentifies it, and presses a button--_if he choose_ and agree to do\r\nso. What goes on in this interval between the advent of the incoming\r\nnerve process and the discharge of the outgoing nerve process?\r\nSomething, at any rate, which represents a brain process of great\r\ncomplexity. Now, anything that fixes or simplifies the brain process,\r\nin so far gives greater certainty to the results. For this reason\r\nexperiments on reflex actions are valuable and decisive where similar\r\nexperiments on voluntary actions are uncertain and of doubtful value.\r\nNow the child\'s mind is relatively simple, and so offers a field for\r\nmore fruitful experiment; this is seen in the reactions of the infant\r\nto strong stimuli, such as bright colours, etc., as related further\r\non.\r\n\r\nWith this inadequate review of the advantages of infant psychology, it\r\nis well also to point out the dangers of the abuse of it. Such dangers\r\nare real. The very simplicity which seems to characterize the life of\r\nthe child is often extremely misleading, and this because the\r\nsimplicity in question is sometimes ambiguous. Two actions of the\r\nchild may appear equally simple; but one may be an adaptive action,\r\nlearned with great pains and really very complex, while the other may\r\nbe inadaptive and really simple. Children differ under the law of\r\nheredity very remarkably, even in the simplest manifestations of their\r\nconscious lives. It is never safe to say without qualification: "This\r\nchild did, consequently all children must." The most we can usually\r\nsay in observing single children is: "This child did, consequently\r\nanother child may."\r\n\r\nSpeaking more positively, the following remarks may be useful to those\r\nwho have a mind to observe children:\r\n\r\n1. In the first place, we can fix no absolute time in the history of\r\nthe child at which a certain mental process takes its rise. The\r\nobservations, now quite extensively recorded, and sometimes quoted as\r\nshowing that the first year, or the second year, etc., brings such and\r\nsuch developments, tend, on the contrary, to show that such divisions\r\ndo not hold in any strict sense. Like any other organic growth, the\r\nnervous system may develop faster under more favourable conditions, or\r\nmore slowly under less favourable; and the growth of the mind is\r\nlargely dependent upon the growth of the brain. Only in broad outline\r\nand within very wide limits can such periods be marked off at all.\r\n\r\n2. The possibility of the occurrence of a mental state at a particular\r\ntime must be distinguished from its necessity. The occurrence of a\r\nsingle clearly observed fact is decisive only against the theory\r\naccording to which its occurrence under the given conditions may not\r\noccur. For example, the very early adaptive movements of the infant in\r\nreceiving its food can not be due to intelligence and will; but the\r\ncase is still open as to the question what is the reason of their\r\npresence--i.e., how much nervous development is present, how much\r\nexperience is necessary, etc. It is well to emphasize the fact that\r\none case may be decisive in overthrowing a theory, but the conditions\r\nare seldom simple enough to make one case decisive in establishing a\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\n3. It follows, however, from the principle of growth itself that the\r\norder of development of the main mental functions is constant, and\r\nnormally free from great variations; consequently, the most fruitful\r\nobservations of children are those which show that such an act was\r\npresent _before another_. The complexity becomes finally so remarkable\r\nthat there seems to be no before or after at all in mental things; but\r\nif the child\'s growth shows a stage in which any process is clearly\r\nabsent, we have at once light upon the laws of growth. For instance:\r\nif a single case is conclusively established of a child\'s drawing an\r\ninference before it begins to use words or significant vocal sounds,\r\nthe one case is as good as a thousand to show that thought may develop\r\nin some degree independently of spoken language.\r\n\r\n4. While the most direct results are acquired by systematic\r\nexperiments with a given point in view, still general observations\r\ncarefully recorded by competent persons, are important for the\r\ninterpretation which a great many such records may afford in the end.\r\nIn the multitude of experiences here, as everywhere, there is\r\nstrength. Such observations should cover everything about the\r\nchild--his movements, cries, impulses, sleep, dreams, personal\r\npreferences, muscular efforts, attempts at expression, games,\r\nfavourites, etc.--and should be recorded in a regular daybook at the\r\ntime of occurrence. What is important and what is not, is, as I have\r\nsaid, something to be learned; and it is extremely desirable that any\r\none contemplating such observations should acquaint himself beforehand\r\nwith the principles of general psychology and physiology, and should\r\nseek also the practical advice of a trained observer.\r\n\r\nAs yet many of the observations which we have in this field were made\r\nby the average mother, who knows less about the human body than she\r\ndoes about the moon or the wild flowers, or by the average father, who\r\nsees his child for an hour a day, when the boy is dressed up, and who\r\nhas never slept in the same room with him--let alone the same bed!--in\r\nhis life; by people who have never heard the distinction between\r\nreflex and voluntary action, or that between nervous adaptation and\r\nconscious choice. The difference between the average mother and the\r\ngood psychologist is this: she has no theories, he has; he has no\r\ninterests, she has. She may bring up a family of a dozen and not be\r\nable to make a single trustworthy observation; he maybe able, from one\r\nsound of one yearling, to confirm theories of the neurologist and\r\neducator, which are momentous for the future training and welfare of\r\nthe child.\r\n\r\nAs for experimenting with children, only the psychologist should\r\nundertake it. The connections between the body and the mind are so\r\nclose in infancy, the mere animal can do so much to ape reason, and\r\nthe child is so helpless under the leading of instinct, impulse, and\r\nexternal necessity, that the task is excessively difficult--to say\r\nnothing of the extreme delicacy and tenderness of the budding tendrils\r\nof the mind. But others do experiment! Every time we send a child out\r\nof the home to the school, we subject him to experiment of the most\r\nserious and alarming kind. He goes into the hands of a teacher who is\r\noften not only not wise unto the child\'s salvation, but who is,\r\nperchance, a machine for administering a single experiment to an\r\ninfinite variety of children. It is perfectly certain that a great\r\nmany of our children are irretrievably damaged or hindered in their\r\nmental and moral development in the school; but we can not be at all\r\nsure that they would fare any better if they were taught at home! The\r\nchildren are experimented with so much and so unwisely, in any case,\r\nthat possibly a little intentional experiment, guided by real insight\r\nand psychological information, would do them good.\r\n\r\n_Methods of experimenting with Children._--In endeavouring to bring\r\nsuch questions as the degree of memory, recognition, association,\r\netc., present in an infant, to a practical test, considerable\r\nembarrassment has always been experienced in understanding the child\'s\r\nvocal and other responses. Of course, the only way a child\'s mind can\r\nbe studied is through its expressions, facial, lingual, vocal,\r\nmuscular; and the first question--i.e., What did the infant do? must\r\nbe followed by a second--i.e., What did his doing that mean? The\r\nsecond question is, as I have said, the harder question, and the one\r\nwhich requires more knowledge and insight. It is evident, on the\r\nsurface, that the further away we get in the child\'s life from simple\r\ninherited or reflex responses, the more complicated do the processes\r\nbecome, and the greater becomes the difficulty of analyzing them, and\r\narriving at a true picture of the real mental condition which lies\r\nback of them.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate this confusion, I may cite one of the few problems which\r\npsychologists have attempted to solve by experiments on children: the\r\ndetermination of the order of rise of the child\'s perceptions of the\r\ndifferent colours. The first series of experiments consisted in\r\nshowing the child various colours and requiring him to name them, the\r\nresults being expressed in percentages of correct answers to the whole\r\nnumber. Now this experiment involves no less than four different\r\nquestions, and the results give absolutely no clew to their\r\nseparation. It involves:\r\n\r\n1. The child\'s distinguishing different colours displayed\r\nsimultaneously before it, together with the complete development of\r\nthe eyes for colour sensation. 2. The child\'s ability to recognise or\r\nidentify a colour after having seen it once. 3. An association between\r\nthe child\'s colour seeing and word hearing and speaking memories, by\r\nwhich the proper name for the colours is brought up in his mind. 4.\r\nEqually ready facility in the pronunciation of the various names of\r\nthe colours which he recognises; and there is the further\r\nembarrassment, that any such process which involves association of\r\nideas, is as varied as the lives of children. The single fact that\r\nspeech is acquired long after objects and some colours are\r\ndistinguished, shows that results reached by this method have very\r\nlittle value as far as the problem of the first perception of colours\r\nis concerned.\r\n\r\nThat the fourth element pointed out above is a real source of\r\nconfusion is shown by the fact that children recognise many words\r\nwhich they can not readily pronounce. When this was realized, a\r\nsecond phase in the development of the problem arose. A colour was\r\nnamed, and then the child was required to pick out that colour. This\r\ngave results different from those reached by the first method, blue\r\nand red leading the list in correct answers by the first method, while\r\nby this second method yellow led, and blue came near the end of the\r\nlist.\r\n\r\nThe further objection that colours might be distinguished before the\r\nword names are learned, or that colour words might be interchanged or\r\nconfused by the child, gave rise to what we may call the third stage\r\nin the statement of the problem. The method of "recognition" took the\r\nplace of the method of "naming." This consisted in showing to a child\r\na coloured disk, without naming it, and then asking him to pick out\r\nthe same colour from a number of coloured disks.\r\n\r\nThis reduces the question to the second of the four I have named\r\nabove. It is the usual method of testing for colour blindness, in\r\nwhich, from defects of vision, certain colours can not be perceived at\r\nall. It answers very well for colour blindness; for what we really\r\nwant to learn in the case of a sailor or a signal-man is whether he\r\ncan recognise a given signal when it is repeated; that is, does he\r\nknow green or red to be the same as his former experience of green or\r\nred? But it is evident that there is still a more fundamental question\r\nin the matter--the real question of colour perception. It is quite\r\npossible that a child might not recognise an isolated colour when he\r\ncould really very well distinguish the colours lying side by side. The\r\nlast question, then, is this: When does the child get the different\r\ncolour _Sensations_ (not recognitions), and in what order?\r\n\r\nTo solve this question it would seem that experiments should be made\r\nupon younger children. The results described above were all secured\r\nafter the children had made considerable progress in learning to\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\nTo meet this requirement another method may be used which can be\r\napplied to children less than a year old. The colours are shown, and\r\nthe child led to grasp after them. This method is of such a character\r\nas to yield a series of experiments whose results are in terms of the\r\nmost fundamental movements of the infant; it can be easily and\r\npleasantly conducted; and it is of wide application. The child\'s hand\r\nmovements are nearly ideal in this respect. The hand reflects the\r\nchild\'s first feelings, and becomes the most mobile organ of his\r\nvolition, except his organs of speech. We find spontaneous arm and\r\nhand movements, reflex movements, reaching-out movements, grasping\r\nmovements, imitative movements, manipulating movements, and voluntary\r\nefforts--all these, in order, reflecting the development of the mind.\r\n\r\nTo illustrate this method, I may cite certain results reached by\r\nmyself on the questions of colour and distance perception, and\r\nright-handedness in the child.\r\n\r\n_Distance and Colour Perception._--I undertook at the beginning of my\r\nchild H.\'s ninth month to experiment with her with a view to arriving\r\nat the exact state of her colour perception, and also to investigate\r\nher sense of distance. The arrangements consisted in this instance in\r\ngiving the infant a comfortable sitting posture, kept constant by a\r\nband passing around her chest and fastened securely to the back of her\r\nchair. Her arms were left bare and quite free in their movements.\r\nPieces of paper of different colours were exposed before her, at\r\nvarying distances, front, right, and left. This was regulated by a\r\nframework, consisting of a horizontal rod graded in inches, projecting\r\nfrom the back of the chair at a level with her shoulder and parallel\r\nwith her arm when extended straight forward, and carrying on it\r\nanother rod, also graded in inches, at right angles to the first. This\r\nsecond rod was thus a horizontal line directly in front of the child,\r\nparallel with a line connecting her shoulders, and so equally distant\r\nfor both hands. This second rod was made to slide upon the first, so\r\nas to be adjusted at any desired distance from the child. On this\r\nsecond rod the colours, etc., were placed in succession, the object\r\nbeing to excite the child to reach for them. So far from being\r\ndistasteful to the infant, I found that, with pleasant suggestions\r\nthrown about the experiments, the whole procedure gave her much\r\ngratification, and the affair became one of her pleasant daily\r\noccupations. After each sitting she was given a reward of some kind. I\r\ngive the results, both for colour and distance, of 217 experiments. Of\r\nthese 111 were with five colours and 106 with ordinary newspaper\r\n(chosen as a relatively neutral object, which would have no colour\r\nvalue and no association, to the infant).\r\n\r\n_Colour._--The colours range themselves in the order of\r\nattractiveness--blue, red, white, green, and brown. Disregarding\r\nwhite, the difference between blue and red is very slight, compared\r\nwith that between any other two. This confirms the results of the\r\nsecond method described above. Brown, to my child--as tested in this\r\nway--seemed to be about as neutral as could well be. A similar\r\ndistaste for brown has been noticed by others. White, on the other\r\nhand, was more attractive than green. I am sorry that my list did not\r\ninclude yellow. The newspaper was, at reaching distance (9 to 10\r\ninches) and a little more (up to 14 inches), as attractive as the\r\naverage of the colours, and even as much so as the red; but this is\r\nprobably due to the fact that the newspaper experiments came after a\r\ngood deal of practice in reaching after colours, and a more exact\r\nassociation between the stimulus and its distance. At 15 inches and\r\nover, the newspaper was refused in 93 per cent of the cases, while\r\nblue was refused at that distance in only 75 per cent, and red in 83\r\nper cent.\r\n\r\n_Distance._--In regard to the question of distance, the child\r\npersistently refused to reach for anything put 16 inches or more away\r\nfrom her. At 15 inches she refused 91 per cent of all the cases, 90\r\nper cent of the colour cases, and, as I have said, 93 per cent of the\r\nnewspaper cases. At nearer distances we find the remarkable uniformity\r\nwith which the safe-distance association works at this early age. At\r\n14 inches only 14 per cent of all the cases were refused, and at 13\r\ninches only about 7 per cent. There was a larger percentage of\r\nrefusals at 11 and 12 inches than at 13 and 14 inches, a result due to\r\nthe influence of the brown, which was refused consistently when more\r\nthan 10 inches away. The fact that there were no refusals to reach for\r\nanything exposed within reaching distance (10 inches)--other\r\nattractive objects being kept away--shows two things; (1) the very\r\nfine estimation visually of the distance represented by the\r\narm-length; and (2) the great uniformity at this age of the phenomenon\r\nof Motor Suggestion upon which this method of child study is based,\r\nand which is referred to again below. In respect to the first point,\r\nit will be remembered that the child does not begin to reach for\r\nanything that it sees until about the fourth or sixth week; so it is\r\nevident at what a remarkably fast rate those obscure factors of size,\r\nperspective, light and shade, etc., which signify distance to the eye,\r\nbecome associated with arm movements of reaching. This method, applied\r\nwith proper precautions, obviates many of the difficulties of the\r\nothers. There are certain requirements of proper procedure, however,\r\nwhich should never be neglected by any one who experiments with young\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the child is peculiarly susceptible to the appeals\r\nof change, novelty, chance, or happy suggestion; and often the failure\r\nto respond to a stimulus is due to distraction or to discomfort rather\r\nthan to lack of intrinsic interest. Again, fatigue is a matter of\r\nconsiderable importance. In respect to fatigue, I should say that the\r\nfirst signs of restlessness, or arbitrary loss of interest, in a\r\nseries of stimulations, is sufficient warning, and all attempts at\r\nfurther experimenting should cease. Often the child is in a state of\r\nindisposition, of trifling nervous irritability, etc.; this should be\r\ndetected beforehand, and then nothing should be undertaken. No series\r\nlonger than three trials should be attempted without changing the\r\nchild\'s position, resting its attention with a song, or a game, etc.,\r\nand thus leading it fresh to its task again. Furthermore, no single\r\nstimulus, as a colour, should be twice repeated without a change to\r\nsome other, since the child\'s eagerness or alertness is somewhat\r\nsatisfied by the first effort, and a new thing is necessary to bring\r\nhim out to full exercise again. After each effort or two the child\r\nshould be given the object reached for to hold or play with for a\r\nmoment; otherwise he grows to apprehend that the whole affair is a\r\ncase of "Tantalus." In all these matters very much depends upon the\r\nknowledge and care of the experimenter, and his ability to keep the\r\nchild in a normal condition of pleasurable muscular exercise\r\nthroughout.\r\n\r\nIn performing colour experiments, several requirements would appear to\r\nbe necessary for exact results. Should not the colours chosen be equal\r\nin purity, intensity, lustre, illumination, etc.? In reference to\r\nthese differences, I think only that degree of care need be exercised\r\nwhich good comparative judgment provides. Colours of about equal\r\nobjective intensity, of no gloss, of relatively evident spectral\r\npurity, under constant illumination--this is all that is required. The\r\nvariations due to the grosser factors I have mentioned--such as\r\ncondition of attention, physical unrest, disturbing noises, sights,\r\netc.--are of greater influence than any of these more recondite\r\nvariations in the stimulus. Intensity and lustre, however, are\r\ncertainly important. It is possible, by carefully choosing a room of\r\npretty constant daylight illumination, and setting the experiments at\r\nthe same hour each day, to secure a regular degree of brightness if\r\nthe colours themselves are equally bright; and lustre may be ruled out\r\nby using coloured wools or blotting-papers. The papers used in the\r\nexperiments given above were coloured blotting-papers. The omission of\r\nyellow is due to the absence, in the neighbourhood, of a satisfactory\r\nyellow paper.\r\n\r\nThe method now described may be further illustrated by the following\r\nexperiments on the use of the hands by the young child.\r\n\r\n_The Origin of Right-handedness._--The question, "Why are we right or\r\nleft-handed?" has exercised the speculative ingenuity of many men. It\r\nhas come to the front anew in recent years, in view of the advances made\r\nin the general physiology of the nervous system; and certainly we are\r\nnow in a better position to set the problem intelligently and to hope\r\nfor its solution. Hitherto the actual conditions of the rise of\r\n"dextrality" in young children--as the general fact of uneven-handedness\r\nmay be called--have not been closely observed. It was to gain light,\r\ntherefore, upon the facts themselves that the experiments described in\r\nthe following pages were carried out.\r\n\r\nMy child H. was placed in a comfortable sitting posture, the arms left\r\nbare and free in their movement, and allowed to reach for objects placed\r\nbefore her in positions exactly determined and recorded by the simple\r\narrangement of sliding rods already described. The experiments took\r\nplace at the same hour daily, for a period extending from her fourth to\r\nher tenth month. These experiments were planned with very great care and\r\nwith especial view to the testing of several hypotheses which, although\r\nsuperficial to those who have studied physiology, yet constantly recur\r\nin publications on this subject. Among these theories certain may be\r\nmentioned with regard to which my experiments were conclusive. It has\r\nfrequently been held that a child\'s right-handedness arises from the\r\nnurse\'s or mother\'s constant method of carrying it, the child\'s hand\r\nwhich is left free being more exercised, and so becoming stronger. This\r\ntheory is ambiguous as regards both mother and child. The mother, if\r\nright-handed, would carry the child on the left arm, in order to work\r\nwith the right arm. This I find an invariable tendency with myself and\r\nwith nurses and mothers whom I have observed. But this would leave the\r\nchild\'s left arm free, and so a right-handed mother would be found with\r\na left-handed child! Again, if the mother or nurse be left-handed, the\r\nchild would tend to be right-handed. Or if, as is the case in civilized\r\ncountries, nurses largely replace the mothers, it would be necessary\r\nthat most of the nurses be left-handed in order to make most of the\r\nchildren right-handed. Now, none of these deductions are true. Further,\r\nthe child, as a matter of fact, holds on with both hands, however it is\r\nitself held.\r\n\r\nAnother theory maintains that the development of right-handedness is\r\ndue to differences in weight of the two lateral halves of the body;\r\nthis tends to bring more strain on one side than the other, and to\r\ngive more exercise, and so more development, to that side. This\r\nevidently assumes that children are not right or left-handed before\r\nthey learn to stand. This my results given below show to be false.\r\nAgain, we are told that infants get right-handed by being placed on\r\none side too much for sleep; this can be shown to have little force\r\nalso when the precaution is taken to place the child alternately on\r\nits right and left sides for its sleeping periods.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the child H., certain precautions were carefully\r\nenforced. She was never carried about in arms at all, never walked\r\nwith when crying or sleepless; she was frequently turned over in her\r\nsleep; she was not allowed to balance herself on her feet until a\r\nlater period than that covered by the experiments. Thus the conditions\r\nof the rise of the right-handed era were made as simple and uniform as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThe experiments included, besides reaching for colours, a great many\r\nof reaching for other objects, at longer and shorter distances, and in\r\nunsymmetrical directions. I give some details of the results of the\r\nexperiments in which simple objects were used, extending over a period\r\nof four months, from the fifth to the ninth in her life. The number of\r\nexperiments at each sitting varied from ten to forty, the position of\r\nthe child being reversed as to light from windows, position of\r\nobservation, etc., after half of each series.\r\n\r\nNo trace of preference for either hand was discernible during this\r\nperiod; indeed, the neutrality was as complete as if it had been\r\narranged beforehand, or had followed the throwing of dice.\r\n\r\nI then conceived the idea that possibly a severer distance test might\r\naffect the result and show a marked preferential response by one hand\r\nover the other. I accordingly continued to use a neutral stimulus, but\r\nplaced it from twelve to fifteen inches away from the child. This\r\nresulted in very hard straining on her part, with all the signs of\r\nphysical effort (explosive breathing sounds resulting from the setting\r\nof the larynx, rush of blood to the head, seen in the flushing of the\r\nface, etc.). The number of experiments in each series was\r\nintentionally made very small, from one to twelve, in order to avoid\r\nfatigue.\r\n\r\nThe results were now very interesting. During the month ending June\r\n15th the child showed no decided preference for either hand in\r\nreaching straight before her within the easy reaching distance of ten\r\ninches, but a slight balance in favour of the left hand; yet she was\r\nright-handed to a marked degree during the same period as regards\r\nmovements which required effort or strain, such as grasping for\r\nobjects twelve to fifteen inches distant. For the greater distances,\r\nthe left hand was used in only five cases as against seventy-four\r\ncases of the use of the right hand; and further, all these five cases\r\nwere twelve-inch distances, the left hand being used absolutely not at\r\nall in the forty-five cases at longer distances.\r\n\r\nIn order to test this further, I varied the point of exposure of the\r\nstimulus to the right or left, aiming thus to attract the hand on one\r\nside or the other, and so to determine whether the growth of such a\r\npreference was limited to experiences of convenience in reaching to\r\nadjacent local objects, etc.\r\n\r\nThe deviation to the left in front of the body only called out the\r\nright hand to greater exertion, while the left hand fell into still\r\ngreater disuse. This seems to show that "dextrality" is not derived\r\nfrom the experience of the individual in using either hand\r\npredominantly for reaching, grasping, holding, etc., within the\r\neasiest range of that hand. The right hand intruded regularly upon the\r\ndomain of the left.\r\n\r\nProceeding upon the clew thus obtained, a clew which seems to suggest\r\nthat the hand preference is influenced by the stimulus to the eye, I\r\nintroduced hand observations into a series of experiments already\r\nmentioned above on the same child\'s perception of the different\r\ncolours; thinking that the colour stimulus which represented the\r\nstrongest inducement to the child to reach might have the same effect\r\nin determining the use of the right hand as the increased distance in\r\nthe experiments already described. This inference is proved to be\r\ncorrect by the results.\r\n\r\nIt should be added that in all cases in which both hands were used\r\ntogether, each hand was called out with evident independence of the\r\nother, both about the same time, and both carried energetically to the\r\ngoal. In many other cases in which either right or left hand is given\r\nin the results, the other hand also moved, but in a subordinate and\r\naimless way. There was a very marked difference between the use of\r\nboth hands in some cases, and of one hand followed by, or accompanied\r\nby, the other in other cases. It was very rare that the second hand\r\ndid not thus follow or accompany the first; and this was extremely\r\nmarked in the violent reaching for which the right hand was mainly\r\nused. This movement was almost invariably accompanied by an objectless\r\nand fruitless symmetrical movement of the other hand.\r\n\r\nThe results of the entire series of experiments on the use of the\r\nhands may be stated as follows, mainly in the words in which they were\r\nsummarily reported some time ago:\r\n\r\n1. I found no continued preference for either hand as long as there\r\nwere no violent muscular exertions made (based on 2,187 systematic\r\nexperiments in cases of free movement of hands near the body--i. e.,\r\nright hand, 577 cases; left hand, 568 cases--a difference of 9 cases;\r\nboth hands, 1,042 cases; the difference of 9 cases being too slight to\r\nhave any meaning); the period covered being from the child\'s sixth to\r\nher tenth month inclusive.\r\n\r\n2. Under the same conditions, the tendency to use both hands together\r\nwas about double the tendency to use either (seen from the number of\r\ncases of the use of both hands in the figures given above).\r\n\r\n3. A distinct preference for the right hand in violent efforts in\r\nreaching became noticeable in the seventh and eighth months.\r\nExperiments during the eighth month on this cue gave, in 80 cases,\r\nright hand, 74 cases; left hand, 5 cases; both hands, 1 case. This was\r\ntrue in two very distinct classes of cases: first, reaching for\r\nobjects, neutral as regards colour (newspaper, etc.), at more than the\r\nreaching distance; and, second, reaching for bright colours at any\r\ndistance. Under the stimulus of bright colours, from 86 cases, 84 were\r\nright-hand cases and 2 left-hand. Right-handedness had accordingly\r\ndeveloped under pressure of muscular effort in the sixth and seventh\r\nmonths, and showed itself also under the influence of a strong colour\r\nstimulus to the eye.\r\n\r\n4. Up to this time the child had not learned to stand or to creep;\r\nhence the development of one hand more than the other is not due to\r\ndifferences in weight between the two longitudinal halves of the body.\r\nAs she had not learned to speak or to utter articulate sounds with\r\nmuch distinctness, we may say also that right or left-handedness may\r\ndevelop while the speech centres are not yet functioning. Further, the\r\nright hand is carried over after objects on the left side, showing\r\nthat habit in reaching does not determine its use.\r\n\r\n_Theoretical_.--Some interesting points arise in connection with the\r\ninterpretation of these facts. If it be true that the order of rise of\r\nmental and physiological functions is constant, then for this question\r\nthe results obtained in the case of one child, if accurate, would hold\r\nfor others apart from any absolute time determination. We should\r\nexpect, therefore, that these results would be confirmed by\r\nexperiments on other children, and this is the only way their\r\ncorrectness can be tested.\r\n\r\nIf, when tested, they should be found correct, they would be\r\nsufficient answer to several of the theories of right-handedness\r\nheretofore urged, as has been already remarked. The rise of the\r\nphenomenon must be sought, therefore, in more deep-going facts of\r\nphysiology than such theories supply. Furthermore, if we go lower in\r\nthe animal scale than man, analogies for the kinds of experience which\r\nare urged as reasons for right-handedness are not present; animals do\r\nnot carry their young, nor pat them to sleep, nor do animals shake\r\nhands!\r\n\r\nA full discussion would lead us to the conclusion that dextrality is\r\ndue to a difference in development in the two hemispheres of the\r\nbrain, that these differences are hereditary, and that they show\r\nthemselves toward the end of the first year.\r\n\r\nIt is a singular circumstance that right-handedness and speech are\r\ncontrolled by the same hemisphere of the brain and from contiguous\r\nareas. It would explain this--and at the same time it seems probable\r\nfrom other considerations--if we found that right-handedness was first\r\nused for expression before speech; and that speech has arisen from\r\nthe setting aside, for further development, of the area in the brain\r\nfirst used for right-handedness. Musical expression has its seat in or\r\nnear the same lobe of the brain.\r\n\r\n_The Child\'s Mental Development in General_.--The actual development\r\nof the child, as observations from many sources indicate it, may be\r\nsketched very briefly in its main outlines. It is probable that the\r\nearliest consciousness is simply a mass of touch and muscular\r\nsensations experienced in part before birth. Shortly after birth the\r\nchild begins to connect his impressions with one another and to show\r\nMemory. But both memory and Association are very weak, and depend upon\r\nintense stimulations, such as bright lights, loud noises, etc. The\r\nthings which most effect him at these early stages are those which\r\nbring him into conditions of sharp physical pain or give him acute\r\npleasure. Yet it is a remarkable fact that at birth the pain reflex is\r\nwanting. His whole life up to about the fourth month turns upon his\r\norganic and vegetative needs. At three months the young child will\r\nforget his mother or nurse after a very few days. Attention begins to\r\narise about the end of the first quarter year, appearing first in\r\nresponse to bright lights and loud sounds, and being for a\r\nconsiderable time purely reflex, drawn here and there by the\r\nsuccessive impressions which the environment makes. With lights and\r\nsounds, however, movements also attract the infant\'s attention very\r\nearly; and the passage from reflex attention to a sort of vague\r\ninterest seems to arise first in connection with the movements of the\r\npersons about him. This interest goes on to develop very rapidly in\r\nthe second half year, in connection more particularly with the\r\nmovements which are associated with the child\'s own comfort and\r\ndiscomfort. The association of muscular sensations with those of touch\r\nand sight serves to give him his first clear indications of the\r\npositions of his own members and of other objects. His discrimination\r\nof what belongs to his own body is probably aided by so-called "double\r\ntouch"--the fact that when he touches his own body, as in touching his\r\nfoot with the hand, he has two sensations, one in the foot and the\r\nother in the hand. This is not the case when he touches other objects,\r\nand he soon learns the distinction, getting the outlines of his own\r\nbody marked out in a vague way. The learning of the localities on his\r\nbody which he can not see, however, lags far behind. The movements of\r\nhis limbs in active exploration, accompanied by sight, enables him to\r\nbuild up his knowledge of the world about him. Learning this he soon\r\nfalls to "experimenting" with the things of space. Thus he begins to\r\nfind out how things fit together, and what their uses are.\r\n\r\nOn the side of his movements we find him going through a series of\r\nremarkable adaptations to his environment. At the beginning his\r\nmovements are largely random discharges, or reflexes of an instinctive\r\ncharacter, such as sucking. Yet in the first month he shows the\r\nbeginning of adaptation to the suggestions of his daily life, the\r\nfirst manifestations of acquired Habit. He learns when and how long he\r\nis expected to sleep, when and how much to eat; he very soon finds out\r\nthe peculiar touch and vocal tones of this person or that, and acts\r\nupon these distinctions. He gets to know the meaning of his food\r\nbottle, to understand the routine movements of persons about the\r\nroom, and the results of violations of their order. His hat, wraps,\r\ncarriage, become in the first half year signals to him of the outdoor\r\nexcursion. He no longer bobs his head about when held erect, and\r\nbegins to control his natural processes. The remarkable thing about\r\nall these adaptations is that they occur before the infant can in any\r\nsense be said to have a Will; for, as has been said, the fibres of the\r\nbrain necessary to voluntary action--in the cortex of the\r\nhemispheres--are not yet formed.\r\n\r\nThe realization of this extraordinary adaptiveness of the very young\r\nchild should save parents many an anxious day and sleepless night.\r\nThere is practically nothing more easy than to impress upon the child\r\nwhatever habits of daily--and nightly!--routine one wishes to give\r\nhim, if he be taken early enough. The only requirements are knowledge\r\nof what is good for him, and then _inviolable regularity_ in\r\neverything that concerns him. Under this treatment he will become as\r\n"obstinate" in being "good" as the opposite so-called indulgent or\r\ncapricious treatment always make him in being "bad." There is no\r\nreason whatever that he should be walked with or held, that he should\r\nbe taken up when he cries, that he should be trotted when he awakes,\r\nor that he should have a light by night. Things like this are simply\r\nbad habits for which the parents have themselves to thank. The child\r\nadapts himself to his treatment, and it is his treatment that his\r\nhabits reflect.\r\n\r\nDuring the second half-year--sooner or later in particular cases--the\r\nchild is ready to begin to imitate. Imitation is henceforth, for the\r\nfollowing few years, the most characteristic thing about his action.\r\nHe first imitates movements, later sounds, especially vocal sounds.\r\nHis imitations themselves also show progress, being at first what is\r\ncalled "simple imitation" (repeating a distinction already spoken of\r\nin the chapter on animals), as when the child lies in bed in the\r\nmorning and repeats the same sound over and over again. He hears his\r\nown voice and imitates it. In this sort of imitation he simply allows\r\nhis instinct to reproduce what he hears without control or\r\ninterference from him. He does not improve, but goes on making the\r\nsame sounds with the same mistakes again and again. But a little later\r\nhe begins what is called "persistent imitation"--the "try-try-again,"\r\nalready spoken of--which is a very different thing. Persistent\r\nimitation shows unmistakably the presence of will. The child is not\r\nsatisfied with simple imitation or mere repetition, whether it be good\r\nor bad in its results. He now sees his errors and aims consciously to\r\nimprove. Note the child\'s struggles to speak a word right by imitation\r\nof the pronunciation of others. And he succeeds. He gradually gets his\r\nmuscles under control by persistence in his try-try-again.\r\n\r\nThen he goes further--about the beginning of his second year, usually.\r\nHe gets the idea that imitation is the way to learn, and turns all his\r\neffort into imitations experimentally carried out. He is now ready to\r\nlearn most of the great processes of his later culture. Speech,\r\nwriting, this special accomplishment and that, are all learned by\r\nexperimental imitation.\r\n\r\nThe example of the child\'s trying to draw or write has already been\r\ncited. He looks at the copy before him; sets all his muscles of hand\r\nand arm into massive contraction; turns and twists his tongue, bends\r\nhis body, winds his legs together, holds his breath, and in every way\r\nconcentrates his energies upon the copying of the model. In all this\r\nhe is experimenting.\r\n\r\nHe produces a wealth of movements, from which, very gradually, as he\r\ntries and tries again, the proper ones are selected out. These he\r\npractises, and lets the superfluous ones fall away, until he secures\r\nthe requisite control over hand and arm. Or suppose a child\r\nendeavouring, in the crudest fashion, to put a rubber on the end of a\r\npencil, after seeing some one else do it--just the sort of thing a\r\nyear-old child loves to imitate. What a chaos of ineffective\r\nmovements! But with repeated effort he gets nearer and nearer to it,\r\nand finally succeeds.\r\n\r\nOn the side of action, two general principles have been formulated in\r\nchild psychology, both illustrated in the cases and experiments now\r\ngiven: The one, Motor Suggestion, is, as we saw, a principle of\r\ngeneral psychology. Its importance to the child is that by it he forms\r\nHabits, useful responses to his environment, and so saves himself many\r\nsad blunders. The other principle is that of Imitation; by it the\r\nchild learns new things directly in the teeth of his habits. By\r\nexercising in an excessive way what he has already learned through his\r\nexperimental imitations, he is continually modifying his habits and\r\nmaking new adaptations. These two principles dominate the active life\r\nof the adult man as well.\r\n\r\n_Personality Suggestion._--A further set of facts may be cited to\r\nillustrate the working of Suggestion, now in the sphere of the\r\nreceptive life. They are important as showing the child\'s progress in\r\nlearning the great features of personality.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable tendencies of the very young child in its\r\nresponses to its environment is the tendency to recognise differences\r\nof personality. It responds to what have been called Suggestions of\r\nPersonality. As early as the second month it distinguishes its\r\nmother\'s or nurse\'s touch in the dark. It learns characteristic\r\nmethods of holding, taking up, patting, kissing, etc., and adapts\r\nitself, by a marvellous accuracy of protestation or acquiescence, to\r\nthese personal variations. Its associations of personality come to be\r\nof such importance that for a long time its happiness or misery\r\ndepends upon the presence of certain kinds of "personality\r\nsuggestion." It is quite a different thing from the child\'s behavior\r\ntoward things which are not persons. Things come to be, with some few\r\nexceptions which are involved in the direct gratification of appetite,\r\nmore and more unimportant; things may be subordinated to regular\r\ntreatment or reaction. But persons become constantly more important,\r\nas uncertain and dominating agents of pleasure and pain. The sight of\r\nmovement by persons, with its effects on the infant, seems to be the\r\nmost important factor in this peculiar influence; later the voice\r\ncomes to stand for a person\'s presence, and at last the face and its\r\nexpressions equal the person in all his attributes.\r\n\r\nI think this distinction between persons and things, between agencies\r\nand objects, is the child\'s very first step toward a sense of\r\npersonality. The sense of uncertainty or lack of confidence grows\r\nstronger and stronger in his dealings with persons--an uncertainty\r\naroused by the moods, emotions, changes of expression, and shades of\r\ntreatment of the persons around it. A person stands for a group of\r\nquite unstable experiences. This period we may, for brevity of\r\nexpression, assuming it to be first in order of development, call the\r\n"projective" stage in the growth of the child\'s personal\r\nconsciousness.\r\n\r\nIt is from this beginning that the child goes on to become fully\r\nconscious of what persons are. And when we observe his actions more\r\nclosely we find no less than four steps in his growth, which, on\r\naccount of the importance of the topic, may be stated in some little\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\n1. The first thing of significance to him, as has been said, is\r\n_movement_. The first attempts of the infant at anything like steady\r\nattention are directed to moving things--a swaying curtain, a moving\r\nlight, a stroking touch, etc. And further than this, the moving things\r\nsoon become more than objects of curiosity; these things are just the\r\nthings that affect him with pleasure or pain. It is movement that\r\nbrings him his bottle, movement that regulates the stages of his bath,\r\nmovement that dresses him comfortably, movement that sings to him and\r\nrocks him to sleep. In that complex of sensations, the nurse, the\r\nfeature of importance to him, of immediate satisfaction or redemption\r\nfrom pain, is this--movements come to succour him. Change in his\r\nbodily feeling is the vital requirement of his life, for by it the\r\nrhythm of his vegetative existence is secured; and these things are\r\naccompanied and secured always in the moving presence of the one he\r\nsees and feels about him. This, I take it, is the earliest reflection\r\nin his consciousness of the world of personalities about him. At this\r\nstage his "personality suggestion" is a _pain-movement-pleasure_\r\nstate of mind; to this he reacts with a smile, and a crow, and a kick.\r\nUndoubtedly this association gets some of its value from the other\r\nsimilar one in which the movements are the infant\'s own. It is by\r\nmovements that he gets rid of pains and secures pleasures.\r\n\r\nMany facts tend to bear out this position. My child cried in the dark\r\nwhen I handled her, although I imitated the nurse\'s movements as\r\nclosely as possible. She tolerated a strange presence so long as it\r\nremained quietly in its place; but let it move, and especially let it\r\nusurp any of the pieces of movement-business of the nurse or mother,\r\nand her protests were emphatic. The movements tended to bring the\r\nstrange elements of a new face into the vital association,\r\npain-movement-pleasure, and so to disturb its familiar course; this\r\nconstituted it a strange "personality."\r\n\r\nIt is astonishing, also, what new accidental elements may become parts\r\nof this association. Part of a movement, a gesture, a peculiar habit\r\nof the nurse, may become sufficient to give assurance of the welcome\r\npresence and the pleasures which the presence brings. Two notes of my\r\nsong in the night stood for my presence to H., and no song from any\r\none else could replace it. A lighted match stopped the crying of E.\r\nfor food in her fourteenth week, although it was but a signal for a\r\nprocess of food preparation lasting several minutes; and a simple\r\nlight never stopped her crying under any other circumstances.\r\n\r\n2. With this first start in the sense of personality we find also the\r\nbeginning of the recognition of different personalities. It is\r\nevident that the sense of another\'s presence thus felt in the infant\'s\r\nconsciousness rests, as all associations rest, upon regularity or\r\nrepetition; his sense of expectancy is aroused whenever the chain of\r\nevents is started. This is soon embodied largely in two indications:\r\nthe face and the voice. But it is easy to see that this is a very\r\nmeagre sense of personality; a moving machine which brought pain and\r\nalleviated suffering might serve as well. So the child begins to\r\nlearn, in addition, the fact that persons are in a measure individual\r\nin their treatment of him; that their individuality has elements of\r\nuncertainty or _irregularity_ about it. This growing sense is very\r\nclear to one who watches an infant in its second half year. Sometimes\r\nits mother gives it a biscuit, but sometimes she does not. Sometimes\r\nthe father smiles and tosses the child; sometimes he does not. Even\r\nthe indulgence of the grandmother has its times and seasons. The child\r\nlooks for signs of these varying moods and methods of treatment; for\r\nhis pains of disappointment arise directly on the basis of that former\r\nsense of regular personal presence upon which his expectancy goes\r\nforth.\r\n\r\nThis new element of the child\'s sense of persons becomes, at one\r\nperiod of its development, quite the controlling element. His action\r\nin the presence of the persons of the household becomes hesitating and\r\nwatchful. Especially does he watch the face, for any expressive\r\nindications of what treatment is to be expected; for facial expression\r\nis now the most regular as well as the most delicate indication.\r\nSpecial observations on H.\'s responses to changes in facial expression\r\nup to the age of twenty months showed most subtle sensibility to\r\nthese differences; and normal children all do. Animals are also very\r\nexpert at this.\r\n\r\nAll through the child\'s second year, and longer, his sense of the\r\npersons around him is in this stage. The incessant "why?" with which\r\nhe greets any action affecting him, or any information given him, is\r\nwitness to the simple puzzle of the apparent capriciousness of\r\npersons. Of course he can not understand "why"; so the simple fact to\r\nhim is that mamma will or won\'t, he knows not beforehand which. He is\r\nunable to anticipate the treatment in detail, and he has not of course\r\nlearned any principles of interpretation of the conduct of father or\r\nmother lying back of the details.\r\n\r\nBut in all this period there is germinating in his consciousness--and this\r\nvery uncertainty is an important element of it--the seed of a far-reaching\r\nthought. His sense of persons--moving, pleasure-or-pain-giving, uncertain\r\nbut self-directing persons--is now to become a sense of agency, of power,\r\nwhich is yet not the power of the regular-moving door on its hinges or the\r\nrhythmic swinging of the pendulum of the clock. The sense of _personal\r\nagency_ is now forming, and it again is potent for still further\r\ndevelopment of the social consciousness. It is just here, I think, that\r\nimitation becomes so important in the child\'s life. This is imitation\'s\r\nopportunity. The infant watches to see how others act, because his own\r\nweal and woe depends upon this "how"; and inasmuch as he knows not what to\r\nanticipate, his mind is open to every suggestion of movement. So he falls\r\nto imitating. His attention dwells upon details, and by the principle of\r\nadaptation which imitation expresses, it acts out these details for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting detail, that at this stage the child begins to\r\ngrow capricious himself; to feel that he can do whatever he likes.\r\nSuggestion begins to lose the regularity of its working, for it meets\r\nthe child\'s growing sense of his own agency. The youthful hero becomes\r\n"contrary." At this period it is that obedience begins to grow hard,\r\nand its meaning begins to dawn upon the child as the great reality.\r\nFor it means the subjection of his own agency, his own liberty to be\r\ncapricious, to the agency and liberty of some one else.\r\n\r\n3. With all this, the child\'s distinction between and among the\r\npersons who constantly come into contact with him grows on apace, in\r\nspite of the element of irregularity of the general fact of\r\npersonality. As he learned before the difference between one presence\r\nand another, so now he learns the difference between one _character_\r\nand another. Every character is more or less regular in its\r\nirregularity. It has its tastes and modes of action, its temperament\r\nand type of command. This the child learns late in the second year and\r\nthereafter. He behaves differently when the father is in the room. He\r\nis quick to obey one person, slow to obey another. He cries aloud,\r\npulls his companions, and behaves reprehensibly generally, when no\r\nadult is present who has authority or will to punish him. This stage\r\nin his "knowledge of man" leads to very marked differences of conduct\r\non his part.\r\n\r\n4. He now goes on to acquire real _self-consciousness_ and _social\r\nfeeling_. This stage is so important that we may give to it a separate\r\nheading below.\r\n\r\nIt may not be amiss to sum up what has been said about\r\nPersonality-Suggestion. It is a general term for the information which\r\nthe child gets about persons. It develops through three or four\r\nroughly distinguished stages, all of which illustrate what is called\r\nthe "projective" sense of personality.[2] There is, 1. A bare\r\ndistinction _of persons from things_ on the ground of peculiar\r\npain-movement-pleasure experiences. 2. A sense of the irregularity or\r\ncapriciousness of the behaviour of these persons, which suggests\r\n_personal agency_. 3. A distinction, vaguely felt perhaps, but\r\nwonderfully reflected in the child\'s actions, between the modes of\r\nbehaviour or _personal characters_ of different persons. 4. After his\r\nsense of his own agency arises by the process of imitation, he gets\r\nwhat is really _self-consciousness_ and _social feeling_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: It is very remarkable that in the child\'s bashfulness we\r\nfind a native nervous response to the presence of persons. And it is\r\ncurious to note that, besides the general gregariousness which many\r\nanimals have, they show in many instances special responses of the\r\npresence of creatures of their own kind or of other kinds. Dogs seem\r\nto recognise dogs by _smell_. So with cats, which also respond\r\ninstinctively with strong repulsion to the smell of dogs. Horses seem\r\nto be guided by _sight_. Fowls are notoriously blind to shapes of\r\nfowls, but depend on hearing the cries of their kind or their young.]\r\n\r\n_Self-consciousness._--So far as we have now gone the child has only a\r\nvery dim distinction between himself as a person and the other persons\r\nwho move about him. The persons are "projective" to him, mere bodies\r\nor external objects of a peculiar sort classed together because they\r\nshow common marks. Yet in the sense of agency, he has already begun,\r\nas we saw, to find in himself a mental nucleus, or centre. This comes\r\nabout from his tendency to fall into the imitation of the acts of\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nNow as he proceeds with these imitations of others, he finds himself\r\ngradually understanding the others, by coming, through doing the same\r\nactions with them, to discover what they are feeling, what their\r\nmotives are, what the laws of their behaviour. For example, he sees\r\nhis father handle a pin, then suddenly make a face as he pricks\r\nhimself, and throws the pin away. All this is simply a puzzle to the\r\nchild; his father\'s conduct is capricious, "projective." But the\r\nchild\'s curiosity in the matter takes the form of imitation; he takes\r\nup the pin himself and goes through the same manipulation of it that\r\nhis father did. Thus he gets himself pricked, and with it has the\r\nimpulse to throw the pin away. By imitating his father he has now\r\ndiscovered what was inside the father\'s mind, the pain and the motive\r\nof the action.\r\n\r\nThis way of proceeding in reference to the actions of others, of which\r\nmany examples might be given, has a twofold significance in the\r\ndevelopment of the child; and because of this twofold significance it\r\nis one of the most important facts of psychology. Upon it rest, in the\r\nopinion of the present writer, correct views of ethics and social\r\nphilosophy.\r\n\r\n1. By such imitation the child learns to associate his own sense of\r\nphysical power, together with his own private pleasures and pains,\r\nwith the personal actions which were before observed, it is true, in\r\nother persons but not understood. The act of the father has now become\r\nhis own. So one by one the various attributes which he has found to be\r\ncharacteristic of the persons of his social circle, become his, in\r\nhis own thought. He is now _for himself_ an agent who has the marks of\r\na Person or a Self. He now understands _from_ _the inside_ all the\r\nvarious personal suggestions. What he saw persons do is now no longer\r\n"projective"--simply there, outside, in the environment; it has become\r\nwhat we call "subjective." The details are grouped and held together\r\nby the sense of agency working itself out in his imitative struggles.\r\n\r\nThis is what we mean by Self-consciousness. It is not an inborn thing\r\nwith the child. He gradually acquires it. And it is not a sense of a\r\ndistinct and separate self, first known and then compared with other\r\npersons. On the contrary, it is gradually built up in the child\'s mind\r\nfrom the same material exactly as that of which he makes up his\r\nthought of other persons. The deeds he can do he first sees others\r\ndoing; only then can he imitate them and find out that he also is a\r\nbeing who can perform them.\r\n\r\nSo it goes all through our lives. Our sense of Self is constantly\r\nchanging, constantly being enriched. We have not the same thought of\r\nself two days in succession. To-day I think of myself as something to\r\nbe proud of, to-morrow as something to be ashamed of. To-day I learn\r\nsomething from you, and the thought that it is common to you and to me\r\nis the basis of my sympathy with you. To-morrow I learn to commit the\r\nunworthy act which Mr. A. commits, and the thought that he and I are\r\nso far the same is the basis of the common disapproval which I feel of\r\nhim and me.\r\n\r\n2. The second result of this imitative learning about personality is\r\nof equal importance. When the child has taken up an action by\r\nimitation and made it subjective, finding out that personality has an\r\ninside, something more than the mere physical body, then he reads this\r\nfact back into the other persons also. He says to himself: "He too, my\r\nlittle brother, must have _in him_ a sense of agency similar to this\r\nof mine. He acts imitatively, too; he has pleasures and pains; he\r\nshows sympathy for me, just as I do for him. So do all the persons\r\nwith whom I have become so far acquainted. They are, then, \'subjects\'\r\nas I am--something richer than the mere \'projects\' which I had\r\nsupposed." So other persons become essentially like himself; and not\r\nonly like himself, but identical with himself so far as the particular\r\nmarks are concerned which he has learned from them. For it will be\r\nremembered that all these marks were at first actually taken up by\r\nimitation from these very persons. The child is now giving back to his\r\nparents, teachers, etc., only the material which he himself took from\r\nthem. He has enriched it, to be sure; with it he now reads into the\r\nother persons the great fact of subjective agency; but still whatever\r\nhe thinks of them has come by way of his thought of himself, and that\r\nin turn was made up from them.\r\n\r\nThis view of the other person as being the same in the main as the\r\nself who thinks of the other person, is what psychologists mean when\r\nthey speak of the "ejective" self. It is the self of some one else as\r\nI think of it; in other words, it is myself "ejected" out by me and\r\nlodged in him.\r\n\r\n_The Social and Ethical Sense._--From this we see what the Social\r\nSense is. It is the feeling which arises in the child or man of the\r\nreal identity, through its imitative origin, of all possible thoughts\r\nof self, whether yourself, myself, or some one else\'s self. The bond\r\nbetween you and me is not an artificial one; it is as natural as is\r\nthe recognition of personal individuality. And it is doing violence to\r\nthis fundamental fact to say, as social science so often assumes, that\r\nthe individual naturally separates himself or his interests from the\r\nself or the interests of others. He is, on the contrary, bound up with\r\nothers from the start by the very laws of his growth. His social\r\naction and feeling are natural to him. The child can not be selfish\r\nonly nor generous only; he may seem to be this or that, in this\r\ncircumstance or that, but he is really social all the time.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, his sense of right and wrong, his Ethical Sense, grows up\r\nupon this sense of the social bond. This I can not stop to explain\r\nfurther. But it is only when social relationships are recognised as\r\nessential in the child\'s growth that we can understand the mutual\r\nobligations and duties which the moral life imposes upon us all.\r\n\r\n_How to Observe Children, with Especial Reference to Observations of\r\nImitation._--There are one or two considerations of such practical\r\nimportance to all those who wish to observe children that I venture to\r\nthrow them together--only saying, by way of introduction, that nothing\r\nless than the child\'s personality is at stake in the method and matter\r\nof its imitations. The Self is really the form in which the personal\r\ninfluences surrounding the child take on their new individuality.\r\n\r\n1. No observations are of much importance which are not accompanied by\r\na detailed statement of the personal influences which have affected\r\nthe child. This is the more important since the child sees few\r\npersons, and sees them constantly. It is not only likely--it is\r\ninevitable--that he _make up his personality_, under limitations of\r\nheredity, by imitation, out of the "copy" set in the actions, temper,\r\nemotions, of the persons who build around him the social enclosure of\r\nhis childhood. It is only necessary to watch a two-year-old closely to\r\nsee what members of the family are giving him his personal "copy"--to\r\nfind out whether he sees his mother constantly and his father seldom;\r\nwhether he plays much with other children, and what in some degree\r\ntheir dispositions are; whether he is growing to be a person of\r\nsubjection, equality, or tyranny; whether he is assimilating the\r\nelements of some low unorganized social personality from his foreign\r\nnurse. The boy or girl is a social "monad," to use Leibnitz\'s figure\r\nin a new context, a little world, which reflects the whole system of\r\ninfluences coming to stir his sensibility. And just in so far as his\r\nsensibilities are stirred, he imitates, and forms habits of imitating;\r\nand habits?--they are character!\r\n\r\n2. A point akin to the first is this: the observation of each child\r\nshould describe with great accuracy the child\'s relations to other\r\nchildren. Has he brothers or sisters? how many of each, and of what\r\nage? Does he sleep in the same bed or room with them? Do they play\r\nmuch with one another alone? The reason is very evident. An only child\r\nhas only adult "copy." He can not interpret his father\'s actions, or\r\nhis mother\'s, oftentimes. He imitates very blindly. He lacks the more\r\nchildish example of a brother or sister near himself in age. And this\r\ndifference is of very great importance to his development. He lacks\r\nthe stimulus, for example, of games in which personification is a\r\ndirect tutor to selfhood, as I shall remark further on. And while he\r\nbecomes precocious in some lines of instruction, he fails in variety\r\nof imagination, in richness of fancy, at the same time that his\r\nimaging processes are more wild and uncontrolled. The dramatic, in his\r\nsense of social situations, is largely hidden. It is a very great\r\nmistake to isolate children, especially to separate off one or two\r\nchildren. One alone is perhaps the worse, but two alone are subject to\r\nthe other element of social danger which I may mention next.\r\n\r\n3. Observers should report with especial care all cases of unusually\r\nclose relationship between children in youth, such as childish\r\nfavoritism, "platonic friendships," "chumming," in school or home,\r\netc. We have in these facts--and there is a very great variety of\r\nthem--an exaggeration of the social or imitative tendency, a narrowing\r\ndown of the personal sensibility to a peculiar line of well-formed\r\ninfluences. It has never been studied by writers either on the genesis\r\nof social emotion or on the practice of education. To be sure,\r\nteachers have been alive to the pros and cons of allowing children and\r\nstudents to room together; but that has been with view to the\r\npossibility of direct immoral or unwholesome contagion. This danger is\r\ncertainly real; but we, as psychological observers, and above all as\r\nteachers and leaders of our children, must go deeper than that.\r\nConsider, for example, the possible influence of a school chum and\r\nroommate upon a girl in her teens; for this is only an evident case of\r\nwhat all isolated children are subject to. A sensitive nature, a girl\r\nwhose very life is a branch of a social tree, is placed in a new\r\nenvironment, to engraft upon the members of her mutilated self--her\r\nvery personality; it is nothing less than that--utterly new channels\r\nof supply. The only safety possible, the only way to conserve the\r\nlessons of her past, apart from the veriest chance, and to add to the\r\nstructure of her present character, lies in securing for her the\r\ngreatest possible variety of social influences. Instead of this, she\r\nis allowed to meet, eat, walk, talk, lie down at night, and rise in\r\nthe morning, with one other person, a "copy" set before her, as\r\nimmature in all likelihood as herself, or, if not so, yet a single\r\npersonality, put there to wrap around her growing self the confining\r\ncords of unassimilated and foreign habit. Above all things, fathers,\r\nmothers, teachers, elders, give the children room! They need all that\r\nthey can get, and their personalities will grow to fill it. Give them\r\nplenty of companions, fill their lives with variety; variety is the\r\nsoul of originality, and its only source of supply. The ethical life\r\nitself, the boy\'s, the girl\'s, conscience, is born in the stress of\r\nthe conflicts of suggestion, born right out of his imitative\r\nhesitations; and just this is the analogy which he must assimilate and\r\ndepend upon in his own conflicts for self-control and social\r\ncontinence. So impressively true is this from the human point of view\r\nthat, in my opinion--formed, it is true, from the very few data\r\naccessible on such points, still a positive opinion--friendships of a\r\nclose exclusive kind should be discouraged or broken up, except when\r\nunder the immediate eye of the wise parent or guardian; and even when\r\nallowed, these relationships should, in all cases, be used to entrain\r\nthe sympathetic and moral sentiments into a wider field of social\r\nexercise.\r\n\r\nOne of the merits of the great English schools and of the free schools\r\nof America is that in them the boys acquire, from necessity, the\r\nindependence of sturdy character, and the self-restraint which is\r\nself-imposed. The youth brought up to mind a tutor often fails of the\r\nbest discipline.\r\n\r\n4. The remainder of this section may be devoted to the further\r\nemphasis of the need of close observation of children\'s games,\r\nespecially those which may be best described as "society games." All\r\nthose who have given even casual observation to the doings of the\r\nnursery have been impressed with the extraordinary facility of the\r\nchild\'s mind, from the second year onward, in imagining and plotting\r\nsocial and dramatic situations. It has not been so evident, however,\r\nto these casual observers, nor to many really more skilled, that they\r\nwere observing in these fancy plays the putting together anew of\r\nfragments, or larger pieces, of the adult\'s mental history. Here, in\r\nthese games, we see the actual use which our children make of the\r\npersonal "copy" material which they get from you and me. If a man\r\nstudy these games patiently in his own children, and analyze them out,\r\nhe gradually sees emerge from within the inner consciousness a picture\r\nof the boy\'s own father, whom he aspires to be like, and whose actions\r\nhe seeks to generalize and apply. The picture is poor, for the child\r\ntakes only what he is sensible to. And it does seem often, as Sighele\r\npathetically notices on a large social scale, and as the Westminster\r\ndivines have urged without due sense of the pathetic and home-coming\r\npoint of it, that he takes more of the bad in us for reproduction than\r\nof the good! But, be this as it may, what we give him is all he gets.\r\nHeredity does not stop with birth; it is then only beginning. And the\r\npity of it is that this element of heredity, this reproduction of the\r\nfathers in the children, which might be used to redeem the new-forming\r\npersonality from the heritage of past commonness or impurity, is\r\nsimply left to take its course for the further establishing and\r\nconfirmation of it. Was there ever a group of school children who did\r\nnot leave the real school to make a play school, setting up a box for\r\none of their number to sit on and "take off" the teacher? Was there\r\never a child who did not play "church," and force the improvised\r\n"papa" into the pulpit? Were there ever children who did not "buy"\r\nthings from fancied stalls in every corner of the nursery, after they\r\nhad once seen an elder drive a trade in the market? The point is this:\r\nthe child\'s personality grows; growth is always by action; he clothes\r\nupon himself the scenes of the parent\'s life and acts them out; so he\r\ngrows in what he is, what he understands, and what he is able to\r\nperform.\r\n\r\nIn order to be of more direct service to observers of games of this\r\ncharacter, let me give a short account of an observation of the kind\r\nmade some time ago--one of the simplest of many actual situations\r\nwhich my two little girls, Helen and Elizabeth, have acted out\r\ntogether. It is a very commonplace case, a game the elements of which\r\nare evident in their origin; but I choose this rather than one more\r\ncomplex, since observers are usually not psychologists, and they find\r\nthe elementary the more instructive.\r\n\r\nOn May 2 I was sitting on the porch alone with the children--the two\r\nmentioned above, aged respectively four and a half and two and a half\r\nyears. Helen, the elder, told Elizabeth that she was her little baby;\r\nthat is, Helen became "mamma," and Elizabeth the "baby." The younger\r\nresponded by calling her sister "mamma," and the play began.\r\n\r\n"You have been asleep, baby. Now it is time to get up," said mamma.\r\nBaby rose from the floor--first falling down in order to rise!--was\r\nseized upon by "mamma," taken to the railing to an imaginary\r\nwashstand, and her face washed by rubbing. Her articles of clothing\r\nwere then named in imagination, and put on, one by one, in the most\r\ndetailed and interesting fashion. During all this "mamma" kept up a\r\nstream of baby talk to her infant: "Now your stockings, my darling;\r\nnow your skirt, sweetness--O! no--not yet--your shoes first," etc.,\r\netc. Baby acceded to all the details with more than the docility which\r\nreal infants usually show. When this was done--"Now we must go tell\r\npapa good-morning, dearie," said mamma. "Yes, mamma," came the reply;\r\nand hand in hand they started to find papa. I, the spectator,\r\ncarefully read my newspaper, thinking, however, that the reality of\r\npapa, seeing that he was so much in evidence, would break in upon the\r\nimagined situation. But not so. Mamma led her baby directly past me to\r\nthe end of the piazza, to a column in the corner. "There\'s papa," said\r\nmamma; "now tell him good-morning."--"Good-morning, papa; I am very\r\nwell," said baby, bowing low to the column. "That\'s good," said mamma,\r\nin a _gruff, low voice_, which caused in the real papa a thrill of\r\namused self-consciousness most difficult to contain. "Now you must\r\nhave your breakfast," said mamma. The seat of a chair was made a\r\nbreakfast table, the baby\'s feigned bib put on, and her porridge\r\ncarefully administered, with all the manner of the nurse who usually\r\ndirects their breakfast. "Now" (after the meal, which suddenly became\r\ndinner instead of breakfast), "you must take your nap," said mamma.\r\n"No, mamma; I don\'t want to," said baby. "But you must."--"No; you be\r\nbaby, and take the nap."--"But all the other children have gone to\r\nsleep, dearest, _and the doctor says you must_," said mamma. This\r\nconvinced baby, and she lay down on the floor. "But I haven\'t\r\nundressed you." So then came all the detail of undressing; and mamma\r\ncarefully covered her up on the floor with a light shawl, saying:\r\n"Spring is coming now; that\'ll be enough. Now shut your eyes, and go\r\nto sleep."--"But you haven\'t kissed me, mamma," said the little one.\r\n"Oh, of course, my darling!"--so a long siege of kissing! Then baby\r\nclosed her eyes very tight, while mamma went on tiptoe away to the end\r\nof the porch. "Don\'t go away, mamma," said baby. "No; mamma wouldn\'t\r\nleave her darling," came the reply.\r\n\r\nSo this went on. The nap over, a walk was proposed, hats put on, etc.,\r\nthe mamma exercising great care and solicitude for her baby. One\r\nfurther incident to show this: when the baby\'s hat was put on--the\r\nreal hat--mamma tied the strings rather tight. "Oh! you hurt, mamma,"\r\nsaid baby. "No; mamma wouldn\'t draw the strings too tight. Let mamma\r\nkiss it. There, is that better, my darling?"--all comically true to a\r\ncertain sweet maternal tenderness which I had no difficulty in\r\ntracing.\r\n\r\nNow in such a case what is to be reported, of course, is the facts.\r\nYet knowledge of more than the facts is necessary, as I have said\r\nabove, in order to get the full psychological lesson. We need just the\r\ninformation which concerns the rest of the family and the social\r\ninfluences of the children\'s lives. I recognised at once every phrase\r\nwhich the children used in this play, where they got it, what it meant\r\nin its original context, and how far its meaning had been modified in\r\nthis process, called in a figure "social heredity." But as that story\r\nis reported to strangers who have no knowledge of the children\'s\r\nsocial antecedents, how much beyond the mere facts of imitation and\r\npersonification do they get from it? And how much the more is this\r\ntrue when we examine those complex games of the nursery which show the\r\nbrilliant fancy for situation and drama of the wide-awake\r\nfour-year-old?\r\n\r\nYet we psychologists are free to interpret; and how rich the lessons\r\neven from such a simple scene as this! As for Helen, what could be a\r\nmore direct lesson--a lived-out exercise--in sympathy, in altruistic\r\nself-denial, in the healthy elevation of her sense of self to the\r\ndignity of kindly offices, in the sense of responsibility and agency,\r\nin the stimulus to original effort and the designing of means to\r\nends--and all of it with the best sense of the objectivity which is\r\nquite lost in wretched self-consciousness in us adults, when we\r\npersonate other characters? What could further all this highest mental\r\ngrowth better than the game by which the lessons of her mother\'s daily\r\nlife are read into the child\'s little self? Then, in the case of\r\nElizabeth also, certain things appear. She obeys without command or\r\nsanction, she takes in from her sister the elements of personal\r\nsuggestion in their simpler childish forms. Certainly such scenes,\r\nrepeated every day with such variation of detail, must give something\r\nof the sense of variety and social equality which real life afterward\r\nconfirms and proceeds upon; and lessons of the opposite character are\r\nlearned by the same process.\r\n\r\nAll this exercise of fancy must strengthen the imaginative faculty\r\nalso. The prolonged situations, maintained sometimes whole days, or\r\npossibly weeks, give strength to the imagination and train the\r\nattention. I think, also, that the sense of essential reality, and its\r\ndistinction from the unreal, the merely imagined, is helped by this\r\nsort of symbolic representation. Play has its dangers also--very\r\nserious ones. The adults sometimes set bad examples. The game gives\r\npractise in cunning no less than in forbearance. Possibly the best\r\nservice of observation just now is to gather the facts with a view to\r\nthe proper recognition and avoidance of the dangers.\r\n\r\nFinally, I may be allowed a word to interested parents. You can be of\r\nno use whatever to psychologists--to say nothing of the actual damage\r\nyou may be to the children--unless you _know your babies through and\r\nthrough_. Especially the fathers! They are willing to study everything\r\nelse. They know every corner of the house familiarly, and what is done\r\nin it, except the nursery. A man labours for his children ten hours a\r\nday, gets his life insured for their support after his death, and yet\r\nhe lets their mental growth, the formation of their characters, the\r\nevolution of their personality, go on by absorption--if no worse--from\r\ncommon, vulgar, imported and changing, often immoral attendants! Plato\r\nsaid the state should train the children; and added that the wisest\r\nman should rule the state. This is to say that the wisest man should\r\ntend his children! Hugo gives us, in Jean Valjean and Cosette, a\r\npicture of the true paternal relationship. We hear a certain group of\r\nstudies called the _humanities_, and it is right. But the best school\r\nin the humanities for every man is in his own house.\r\n\r\nWith this goes, finally, the highest lesson of sport, drama,\r\nmake-believe, even when we trace it up into the art-impulse--the\r\nlesson of _personal freedom_. The child himself sets the limitations\r\nof the game, makes the rules, and subjects himself to them, and then\r\nin time pierces the bubble for himself, saying, "I will play no more."\r\nAll this is the germ of self-regulation, of the control of the\r\nimpulses, of the voluntary adoption of the ideal, which becomes in\r\nlater life--if so be that he cling to it--the pearl of great price.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE CONNECTION OF BODY WITH MIND--PHYSIOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGY--MENTAL\r\nDISEASES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the foregoing pages we have had intimations of some of the\r\nimportant questions which arise about the connection of mind with\r\nbody. The avenues of the senses are the normal approaches to the mind\r\nthrough the body; and, taking advantage of this, experiments are made\r\nupon the senses. This gives rise to Experimental Psychology, to which\r\nthe chapter after this is devoted. Besides this, however, we find the\r\ngeneral fact that a normal body must in all cases be present with a\r\nnormal mind, and this makes it possible to arrange so to manipulate\r\nthe body that changes may be produced in the mind in other ways than\r\nthrough the regular channels of sense. For example, we influence the\r\nmind when we drink too much tea or coffee, not to mention the greater\r\nchanges of the same kind which are produced in the mind of the drinker\r\nof too much alcohol or other poisonous substances. All the methodical\r\nmeans of procedure by which the psychologist produces effects of this\r\nkind by changing the condition or functions of the body within itself\r\nbelong to Physiological Psychology. So he modifies the respiration,\r\nchanges the heart beat, stimulates or slows the circulation of the\r\nblood, paralyzes the muscles, etc. The ways of procedure may be\r\nclassified under a few heads, each called a method.\r\n\r\n1. _Method of Extirpation._--This means simply the cutting away of a\r\npart of the body, so that any effect which the loss of the part makes\r\nupon the mind may be noted. It is used especially upon the brain.\r\nPieces of the brain, great or small--indeed, practically the whole\r\nbrain mass--may be removed in many animals without destroying life.\r\nEither of the cerebral hemispheres entire, together with large\r\nportions of the other, may be taken from the human brain without much\r\neffect upon the vital processes, considered as a whole; the actual\r\nresults being the loss of certain mental functions, such as sight,\r\nhearing, power of movement of particular limbs, etc., according to the\r\nlocation of the part which is removed. Many of the facts given below\r\nunder the heading of Localization were discovered in this way, the\r\nguiding principle being that if the loss of a function follows the\r\nremoval of a certain piece of the brain, then that portion of the\r\nbrain is directly concerned in the healthy performance of that\r\nfunction.\r\n\r\n2. _Method of Artificial Stimulation._--As the term indicates, this\r\nmethod proceeds by finding some sort of agent by which the\r\nphysiological processes may be started artificially; that is, without\r\nthe usual normal starting of these processes. For example, the\r\nphysician who stimulates the heart by giving digitalis pursues this\r\nmethod. For psychological purposes this method has also been fruitful\r\nin studying the brain, and electricity is the agent customarily used.\r\nThe brain is laid bare by removing part of the skull of the animal,\r\nand the two electrodes of a battery are placed upon a particular point\r\nof the brain whose function it is wished to determine. The current\r\npasses out along the nerves which are normally set in action from this\r\nparticular region, and movements of the muscles follow in certain\r\ndefinite parts and directions. This is an indication of the normal\r\nfunction of the part of the brain which is stimulated.\r\n\r\nBesides this method of procedure a new one, also by brain stimulation,\r\nhas recently been employed. It consists in stimulating a spot of the\r\nbrain as before, but instead of observing the character of the\r\nmovement which follows, the observer places galvanometers in\r\nconnection with various members of the body and observes in which of\r\nthe galvanometers the current comes out of the animal\'s body (the\r\ngalvanometer being a very delicate instrument for indicating the\r\npresence of an electric current). In this way it is determined along\r\nwhat pathways and to what organs the ordinary vital stimulation passes\r\nfrom the brain, provided it be granted that the electric current takes\r\nthe same course.\r\n\r\n3. _Method of Intoxication, called the "Toxic Method._"--The remarks\r\nabove may suffice for a description of this method. The results of the\r\nadministration of toxic or poisonous agents upon the mind are so\r\ngeneral and serious in their character, as readers of De Quincy know,\r\nthat very little precise knowledge has been acquired by their use.\r\n\r\n4. _Method of Degeneration._--This consists in observing the progress\r\nof natural or artificially produced disease or damage to the tissues,\r\nmainly the nervous tissues, with a view to discovering the directions\r\nof pathways and the locations of connected functions. The degeneration\r\nor decay following disease or injury follows the path of normal\r\nphysiological action, and so discloses it to the observer. This method\r\nis of importance to psychology as affording a means of locating and\r\nfollowing up the course of a brain injury which accompanies this or\r\nthat mental disease or defect.\r\n\r\n_Results_--_Localization of Brain Functions._--The more detailed\r\nresults of this sort of study, when considered on the side of the\r\nnervous organism, may be thrown together under the general head of\r\nLocalization. The greatest result of all is just the discovery that\r\nthere is such a thing as localization in the nervous system of the\r\ndifferent mental functions of sensation and movement. We find\r\nparticular parts of the nervous organism contributing each its share,\r\nin a more or less independent way, to the whole flow of the mental\r\nlife; and in cases of injury or removal of this part or that, there\r\nis a corresponding impairment of the mind.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, it is found that the nervous system has a certain\r\nup-and-down arrangement from the segments of the spinal cord up to the\r\ngray matter of the rind or "cortex" of the large masses or hemispheres\r\nin the skull, to which the word brain is popularly applied. This\r\nup-and-down arrangement shows three so-called "levels" of function.\r\nBeginning with the spinal cord, we find the simplest processes, and\r\nthey grow more complex as we go up toward the brain.\r\n\r\nThe lowest, or "third level," includes all the functions which the\r\nspinal cord, and its upper termination, called the "medulla," are able\r\nto perform alone--that is, without involving necessarily the activity\r\nof the nervous centres and brain areas which lie above them. Such\r\n"third-level" functions are those of the life-sustaining processes\r\ngenerally: breathing, heart-beat, vasomotor action (securing the\r\ncirculation of the blood), etc. These are all called Automatic\r\nprocesses. They go regularly on from day to day, being constantly\r\nstimulated by the normal changes in the physiological system itself,\r\nand having no need of interference from the mind of the individual.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the automatic functions, there is a second great class\r\nof processes which are also managed from the third level; that is, by\r\nthe discharge of nervous energy from particular parts of the spinal\r\ncord. These are the so-called Reflex functions. They include all those\r\nresponses which the nervous system makes to stimulations from the\r\noutside, in which the mind has no alternative or control. They happen\r\nwhether or no. For example, when an object comes near the eye the lid\r\nflies to reflexly. If a tap be made upon the knee while one sits with\r\nthe legs crossed the foot flies up reflexly. Various reflexes may be\r\nbrought out in a sleeper by slight stimulations to this or that region\r\nof his body. Furthermore, each of the senses has its own set of reflex\r\nadjustments to the stimulations which come to it. The eye accommodates\r\nitself in the most delicate way to the intensity of the light, the\r\ndistance of the object, the degree of elevation, and the angular\r\ndisplacement of what one looks at. The taking of food into the mouth\r\nsets up all sorts of reflex movements which do not cease until the\r\nfood is safely lodged in the stomach, and so on through a series of\r\nphysiological adaptations which are simply marvellous in their variety\r\nand extent. These processes belong to the third level; and it may\r\nsurprise the uninitiated to know that not only is the mind quite "out\r\nof it" so far as these functions are concerned, but that the brain\r\nproper is "out of it" also. Most of these reflexes not only go on when\r\nthe brain is removed from the skull, but it is an interesting detail\r\nthat they are generally exaggerated under these conditions. This shows\r\nthat while the third or lowest level does its own work, it is yet in a\r\nsense under the weight--what physiologists call the inhibiting\r\naction--of the higher brain masses. It is not allowed to magnify its\r\npart too much, nor to work out of its proper time and measure. The\r\nnervous apparatus involved in these "third-level" functions may be\r\ncalled the "reflex circuit" (see Fig. 2), the path being from the\r\nsense organ up to the centre by a "sensory" nerve, and then out by a\r\n"motor" nerve to the muscle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--_s c mt_ = reflex circuit; _s c sp mp c mt_ =\r\nvoluntary circuit.]\r\n\r\nGoing upward in the nervous system, we next find a certain group of\r\nbodies within the gross mass of the brain, certain centres lying\r\nbetween the hemispheres above and the medulla and spinal cord below,\r\nand in direct connection by nervous tracts with both of these. The\r\ntechnical names of the more important of these organs are these: the\r\n"corpora striata," or striped bodies, of which there are two, the\r\n"optic thalami," also two in number, and the "cerebellum" or little\r\nbrain, situated behind. These make up what is called the "second\r\nlevel" in the system. They seem to be especially concerned with the\r\nlife of sensation. When the centres lying above them, the hemispheres,\r\nare removed, the animal is still able to see, hear, etc., and still\r\nable to carry out his well-knit habits of action in response to what\r\nhe sees and hears. But that is about all. A bird treated thus, for\r\nexample, these second-level centres being still intact while the\r\nhemispheres are removed, retains his normal appearance, being quite\r\nable to stand upon his feet, to fly, walk, etc. His reflexes are also\r\nunimpaired and his inner physiological processes; but it soon becomes\r\nnoticeable that his mental operations are limited very largely to\r\nsensations. He sees his food as usual, but does not remember its use,\r\nand makes no attempt to eat it. He sees other birds, but does not\r\nrespond to their advances. He seems to have forgotten all his\r\neducation, to have lost all the meanings of things, to have\r\npractically no intelligence. A dog in this condition no longer fears\r\nthe whip, no longer responds to his name, no longer steals food. On\r\nthe side of his conduct we find that all the actions which he had\r\nlearned by training now disappear; the trick dog loses all his tricks.\r\nWhat was called Apperception in the earlier chapter seems to have been\r\ntaken away with the hemispheres.\r\n\r\nComing to the "first level," the highest of all, both in anatomical\r\nposition and in the character of the functions over which it presides,\r\nwe see at once what extraordinary importance it has. It comprises the\r\ncortex of the hemispheres, which taken together are called the\r\ncerebrum. It consists of the parts which we supposed cut out of the\r\npigeon and dog just mentioned; and when we remember what these animals\r\nlose by its removal, we see what the normal animal or man owes to the\r\nintegrity of this organ. It is above all the organ of mind. If we had\r\nto say that the mind as such is located anywhere, we should say in the\r\ngray matter of the cortex of the hemispheres of the brain. For\r\nalthough, as we saw, animals without this organ can still see and hear\r\nand feel, yet we also saw that they could do little else and could\r\nlearn to do nothing more. All the higher operations of mind come back\r\nonly when we think of the animal as having normal brain hemispheres.\r\n\r\nFurther, we find this organ in some degree duplicating the function of\r\nthe second-level centres, for fibres go out from these intermediate\r\nmasses to certain areas of the hemispheres, which reproduce locally\r\nthe senses of hearing, sight, etc. By these fibres the functions of\r\nthe senses are "projected" out to the surface of the brain, and the\r\nterm "projection fibres" is applied to the nerves which make these\r\nconnections. The hemispheres are not content even with the most\r\nimportant of all functions--the strictly intelligent--but they are\r\njealous, so to speak, of the simple sensations which the central brain\r\nmasses are capable of awaking. And in the very highest animals,\r\nprobably only monkeys and man, we find that the hemispheres have gone\r\nso far with their jealousy as to usurp the function of sensation. This\r\nis seen in the singular fact that with a monkey or man the removal of\r\nthe cortical centres makes the animal permanently blind or deaf, as\r\nthe case may be, while in the lower animals such removal does not have\r\nthis result, so long as the "second-level" organs are unimpaired. The\r\nbrain paths of the functions of the second and first levels taken\r\ntogether constitute the so-called "voluntary circuit" (see Fig. 2).\r\n\r\nIn addition to this general demarcation of functions as higher and\r\nlower--first, second, and third level--in their anatomical seat, many\r\ninteresting discoveries have been made in the localization of the\r\nsimpler functions in the cortex itself. The accompanying figures\r\n(Figs. 3 and 4) will show the principle centres which have been\r\ndetermined; and it is not necessary to dwell upon additional details\r\nwhich are still under discussion. The areas marked out are in general\r\nthe same on both hemispheres, and that is to say that most of the\r\ncentres are duplicated. The speech centres, however, are on one side\r\nonly. And in certain cases the nervous fibres which connect the cortex\r\nwith the body-organs cross below the brain to the opposite side of the\r\nbody. This is always true in cases of muscular movement; the movements\r\nof the right side of the body are controlled by the left hemisphere,\r\nand _vice versa_. The stimulations coming in from the body to the\r\nbrain generally travel on the same side, although in certain cases\r\nparallel impulses are also sent over to the other hemisphere as well.\r\nFor example, the very important optic nerve, which is necessary to\r\nvision, comes from each eye separately in a large bunch of fibres, and\r\ndivides at the base of the brain, so that each eye sends impulses\r\ndirectly to the visual centres of both hemispheres.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Outer surface of left hemisphere of the brain\r\n(modified from Exner): _a_, fissure of Rolando; _b_, fissure of\r\nSylvius.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--Inner (mesial) surface of the right hemisphere\r\nof the brain (modified from Sch\xc3\xa4fer and Horsley). In both figures the\r\nshaded area is the motor zone.]\r\n\r\nOf all the special questions which have arisen about the localization\r\nof functions in the nervous system, that of the function of certain\r\nareas known as "motor centres" has been eagerly discussed. The region\r\non both sides of the fissure of Rolando in Fig. 3 contains a number of\r\nareas which give, when stimulated with electricity, very definite and\r\nregular movements of certain muscles on the opposite side of the body.\r\nBy careful exploration of these areas the principal muscular\r\ncombinations--those for facial movements, neck movements, movements of\r\nthe arm, trunk, legs, tail, etc.--have been very precisely\r\nascertained. It was concluded from these facts that these areas were\r\nrespectively the centres for the discharge of the nervous impulses\r\nrunning in each case to the muscles which were moved. The evidence\r\nrecently forthcoming, however, is leading investigators to think that\r\nthere is no cortical centre for the "motor" or outgoing processes\r\nproperly so called, and that these Rolandic areas, although called\r\n"motor," are really centres for the incoming reports of the movements\r\nof the respective muscles after the movements take place, and also for\r\nthe preservation of the memories of movement which the mind must have\r\nbefore a particular movement can be brought about (the mental images\r\nof movement which we called on an earlier page Kin\xc3\xa6sthetic\r\nEquivalents). These centres being aroused in the thought of the\r\nmovement desired, which is the necessary mental preparation for the\r\nmovement, they in turn stimulate the real motor centres which lie\r\nbelow the cortex at the second level. This is in the present writer\'s\r\njudgment the preferable interpretation of the evidence which we now\r\nhave.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--The speech zone (after Collins).]\r\n\r\n_The Speech Zone._--Many interesting facts of the relation of body and\r\nmind have come to light in connection with the speech functions.\r\nSpeech is complex, both on the psychological and also on the\r\nphysiological side, and easily deranged in ways that take on such\r\nremarkable variety that they are a source of very fruitful indications\r\nto the inquirer. It is now proved that speech is not a faculty, a\r\nsingle definite capacity which a man either has or has not. It is\r\nrather a complex thing resulting from the combined action of many\r\nbrain centres, and, on the mental side, of many so-called faculties,\r\nor functions. In order to speak a man normally requires what is called\r\na "zone" in his brain, occupying a large portion of the outside\r\nlateral region (see Fig. 5). It extends, as in the figure, from the\r\nRolandic region (_K_), where the kin\xc3\xa6sthetic lip-and-tongue memories\r\nof words are aroused, backward into the temporal region (_A_), where\r\nthe auditory memories of words spring up; then upward to the angular\r\ngyrus in the rear or occipital region (_V_), where in turn the visual\r\npictures of the written or printed words rise to perform their part in\r\nthe performance; and with all this combination there is associated the\r\ncentre for the movements of the hand and arm employed in writing, an\r\narea higher up in the Rolandic region (above _K_). In the same general\r\nzone we also find the music function located, the musical sounds being\r\nreceived in the auditory centre very near the area for words heard\r\n(_A_) while the centre for musical expression is also in the Rolandic\r\nregion. Furthermore, as may be surmised, the reading of musical\r\nnotation requires the visual centre, just as does the reading of\r\nwords. In addition to this, we find the curious fact that the location\r\nof the whole speech zone is in one hemisphere only. Its location on\r\nthe left or the right, in particular cases, is also an indication as\r\nto whether the person is right-or left-handed; this means that the\r\nprocess which makes the individual either right or left-handed is\r\nprobably located in the speech zone, or near it. A large majority of\r\npersons have the speech zone in the left hemisphere, and are\r\nright-handed; it will be seen that the figure (5) shows the left\r\nhemisphere of the brain, and with it the right hand holding the pen.\r\n\r\n_Defects of Speech--Aphasia._--The sorts of injury which may befall a\r\nlarge zone of the brain are so many that well-nigh endless forms of\r\nspeech defect occur. All impairment of speech is called Aphasia, and\r\nit is called Motor Aphasia when the apparatus is damaged on the side\r\nof movement.\r\n\r\nIf the fibres coming out from the speech zone be impaired, so that the\r\nimpulses can not go to the muscles of articulation and breathing, we\r\nhave Subcortical Motor Aphasia. Its peculiarity is that the person\r\nknows perfectly what he wants to say, but yet can not speak the words.\r\nHe is able to read silently, can understand the speech of others, and\r\ncan remember music; but, with his inability to speak, he is generally\r\nalso unable to write or to perform on a musical instrument (yet this\r\nlast is not always the case). Then we find new variations if his\r\n"lesion"--as all kinds of local nervous defects are called--is in the\r\nbrain centre in the Rolandic region, where arise the memories of the\r\nmovements required. In this latter case the aphasic patient can\r\nreadily imitate speech so long as he hears it, can imitate writing so\r\nlong as it lies before him, but can not do any independent speaking or\r\nwriting for himself. With this there goes another fact which\r\ncharacterizes this form of aphasia, and which is called Cortical, as\r\nopposed to the Subcortical Motor Aphasia described above, that the\r\nperson may not be able even to think of the words which are\r\nappropriate to express his meaning. This is the case when those\r\npersons who depend upon the memories of the movements of lip and\r\ntongue in their normal speech are injured as described.\r\n\r\nBesides the two forms of Motor Aphasia now spoken of, there are\r\ncertain other speech defects which are called Sensory Aphasia. When a\r\nlesion occurs in one of the areas of the brain in the speech zone in\r\nwhich the requisite memories of words seen or heard have their\r\nseat--as when a ball player is struck over the sight centre in the\r\nback of the head--special forms of sensory aphasia show themselves.\r\nThe ball player will, in this case, have Visual Aphasia, being unable\r\nto speak in proportion as he is accustomed in his speaking to depend\r\nupon the images of written or printed words. He is quite unable to\r\nread or write from a copy which he sees; but he may be able,\r\nnevertheless, to write from dictation, and also to repeat words which\r\nare spoken to him. This is because in these latter performances he\r\nuses his auditory centre, and not the visual. There are, indeed, some\r\npersons who are so independent of vision that the loss of the visual\r\ncentre does not much impair their normal speech.\r\n\r\nWhen, again, an injury comes to the auditory centre in the temporal\r\nregion, we find the converse of the case just described; the defect is\r\nthen called Auditory Aphasia. The patient can not now speak or write\r\nwords which he hears, and can not speak spontaneously in proportion as\r\nhe is accustomed to depend upon his memories of the word sounds. But\r\nin most cases he can still both speak and write printed or written\r\nwords which he sees before him.\r\n\r\nThese cases may serve to give the reader an idea of the remarkable\r\ndelicacy and complexity of the function of speech. It becomes more\r\nevident when, instead of cases of gross lesion, which destroy a whole\r\ncentre, or cut the connections between centres, we have disease of the\r\nbrain which merely destroys a few cells in the gray matter here or\r\nthere. We then find partial loss of speech, such as is seen in\r\npatients who lack only certain classes of words; perhaps the verbs, or\r\nthe conjunctions, or proper names, etc.; or in the patients who\r\nspeak, but yet do not say what they mean; or, again, in persons who\r\nhave two verbal series going on at once, one of which they can not\r\ncontrol, and which they often attribute to an enemy inside them, in\r\ncontrol of the vocal organs, or to a persecutor outside whose abuse\r\nthey can not avoid hearing. In cases of violent sick headache we often\r\nmiscall objects without detecting it ourselves, and in delirium the\r\nspeech mechanism works from violent organic discharges altogether\r\nwithout control. The senile old man talks nonsense--so-called\r\ngibberish--thinking he is discoursing properly.\r\n\r\nIn the main cases of Aphasia of distinct sensory and motor types\r\npsychological analysis is now so adequate and the anatomical\r\nlocalization so far advanced that the physicians have sufficient basis\r\nfor their diagnosis, and make inferences looking toward treatment.\r\nMany cases of tumour, of clot on the brain, of local pressure from the\r\nskull, and of h\xc3\xa6morrhage or stopping up of the blood vessels in a\r\nlimited area, have been cured through the indications given by the\r\nparticular forms and degrees of aphasia shown by the patients. The\r\nskull is opened at the place indicated by the defect of speech, the\r\nlesion found where the diagnosis suggested, and the cause removed.\r\n\r\nThis account of Localization will suggest to the reader the truth that\r\nthere is no science of Phrenology. No progress has been made in\r\nlocalizing the intelligence; and the view is now very general that the\r\nwhole brain, with all its interchange of impulses from part to part,\r\nis involved in thinking. As for locating particular emotions and\r\nqualities of temperament, it is quite absurd. Furthermore, the\r\nirregularities of the skull do not indicate local brain differences.\r\nIt is thought that the relative weight of the brain may be an\r\nindication of intellectual endowment, especially when the brain weight\r\nis compared with the weight of the rest of the body, and that culture\r\nin particular lines increases the surface of the cortex by deepening\r\nand multiplying the convolutions. But these statements can not be\r\napplied off-hand to individuals, as the practise of phrenology would\r\nrequire.\r\n\r\n_Defects of Memory--Amnesia._--The cases given just above, where the\r\nfailure of speech was seen to be due to the loss of certain memories\r\nof words, illustrate also a series of mental defects, which are\r\nclassed together as Amnesias. Any failure in memory, except the normal\r\nlapses which we call forgetfulness, is included under this term. Just\r\nas the loss of word memories occasions inability to speak, so that of\r\nother sorts of memories occasions other functional disturbances. A\r\npatient may forget objects, and so not know how to use his penknife or\r\nto put on his shoes. He may forget events, and so give false witness\r\nas to the past.\r\n\r\nOne may forget himself also, and so have, in some degree, a different\r\ncharacter, as is seen, in an exaggerated way, in persons who have\r\nso-called Dual Personality. These patients suddenly fall into a\r\nsecondary state, in which they forget all the events of their ordinary\r\nlives, but remember all the events of the earlier periods of the\r\nsecondary personality. This state may be described as "general"\r\namnesia, in contrast to the "partial" amnesia of the other cases\r\ngiven, in which only particular classes of memories are impaired.\r\n\r\nThe impairment of memory with advancing years also illustrates both\r\n"general" and "partial" Amnesia. The old man loses his memory of\r\nnames, then of other words, then of events, and so gradually becomes\r\nincapable of much retention of any sort.\r\n\r\n_Defects of Will--Aboulia._--A few words may suffice to characterize\r\nthe great class of mental defects which arise on the side of action.\r\nAll inability to perform intentional acts is called Aboulia, or lack\r\nof Will. Certain defects of speech mentioned above illustrate this:\r\ncases in which the patient knows what he wishes to say and yet can not\r\nsay it. This is the type of all the "partial" Aboulias. There may be\r\nno lack in determination and effort, yet the action may be impossible.\r\nBut, in contrast with this, there is a more grave defect called\r\n"general" Aboulia. Here we find a weakening of resolution, of\r\ndetermination, associated with some lack of self-control showing\r\nitself frequently by a certain hesitation or indecision. The patient\r\nsays: "I can not make up my mind," "I can not decide." In exaggerated\r\ncases it becomes a form of mania called "insanity of doubt." The\r\npatient stands before a door for an hour hesitating as to whether he\r\ncan open it or not, or carries to its extreme the experience we all\r\nsometimes have of finding it necessary to return again and again to\r\nmake sure that we have locked the door or shut the draught of the\r\nfurnace.\r\n\r\nWith these illustrations our notice of mental defects may terminate.\r\nThe more complex troubles, the various insanities, manias, phobias,\r\netc., can not be briefly described. Moreover, they are still wrapped\r\nin the profoundest obscurity. To the psychologist, however, there are\r\ncertain guiding principles through the maze of facts, and I may state\r\nthem in conclusion.\r\n\r\nFirst, all mental troubles involve diseases of the brain and can be\r\ncured only as the brain is cured. It does not follow, of course, that\r\nin certain cases treatment by mental agencies, such as suggestion,\r\narousing of expectation, faith, etc., may not be more helpful here,\r\nwhen wisely employed, than in troubles which do not involve the mind;\r\nbut yet the end to be attained is a physical as well as a mental cure,\r\nand the means in the present state of knowledge, at any rate, are\r\nmainly physical means. The psychologist knows practically nothing\r\nabout the laws which govern the influence of mind on body. The\r\nprinciple of Suggestion is so obscure in its concrete working that the\r\nmost practised and best-informed operators find it impossible to\r\ncontrol its use or to predict its results. To give countenance, in\r\nthis state of things, to any pretended system or practice of mind\r\ncure, Christian science, spiritual healing, etc., which leads to the\r\nneglect of ordinary medical treatment, is to discredit the legitimate\r\npractice of medicine and to let loose an enemy dangerous to the public\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nMoreover, such things produce a form of hysterical subjectivism which\r\ndestroys sound judgment, and dissolves the sense of reality which it\r\nhas taken modern science many generations to build up. Science has all\r\nalong had to combat such wresting of its more obscure and unexplained\r\nfacts into alliance with the ends of practical quackery, fraud, and\r\nsuperstition; and psychologists need just now to be especially alive\r\nto their duty of combating the forms of this alliance which arise when\r\nthe newer results of psychology are so used, whether it be to\r\nsupplement the inadequate evidence of "thought-transference," to\r\nsupport the claims of spiritualism, or to justify in the name of\r\n"personal liberty" the substitution of a "healer" for the trained\r\nphysician. The parent who allows his child to die under the care of a\r\n"Christian Science healer" is as much a criminal from neglect as the\r\none who, going but a step further in precisely the same direction,\r\nbrings his child to starvation on a diet of faith. In France and\r\nRussia experimenting in hypnotism on well persons has been restricted\r\nby law to licensed experts; what, compared with that, shall we say to\r\nthis wholly amateurish experimenting with the diseased? Let the\r\n"healer" heal all he can, but let him not experiment to the extremity\r\nof life and death with the credulity and superstition of the people\r\nwho think one "doctor" is as good as another.\r\n\r\nSecond, many experts agree that diseases of the mind, whatever their\r\nbrain seat may be, all involve impairment of the Attention. This, at\r\nany rate, is a general mark of a deranged or defective mind. The idiot\r\nlacks power of attention. The maniac lacks control of his attention.\r\nThe deluded lacks grasp and flexibility of attention. The crank can\r\nonly attend to one thing. The old man is feeble in the attention,\r\nhaving lost his hold. So it goes. The attention is the instrument of\r\nthe one sort of normal mental activity called Apperception, and so\r\nimpairment of the attention shows itself at once in some particular\r\nform of defect.\r\n\r\nThird, it is interesting to know that in progressive mental failure\r\nthe loss of the powers of the mind takes place in an order which is\r\nthe reverse of that of their original acquisition. The most complex\r\nfunctions, which are acquired last, are the first to show impairment.\r\nIn cases of general degeneration, softening of the brain, etc., the\r\nintelligence and moral nature are first affected, then memory,\r\nassociation, and acquired actions of all sorts, while there remain,\r\nlatest of all, actions of the imitative kind, most of the deep-set\r\nhabits, and the instinctive, reflex, and automatic functions, This\r\nlast condition is seen in the wretched victim of dementia and in the\r\ncongenital idiot. The latter has, in addition to his life processes\r\nand instincts, little more than the capacity for parrot-like\r\nimitation. By this he acquires the very few items of his education.\r\n\r\nThe recovery of the patient shows the same stages again, but in the\r\nreversed direction; he pursues the order of the original acquisition,\r\na process which physicians call Re-evolution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nHOW WE EXPERIMENT ON THE MIND--EXPERIMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn recent years the growth of the method of experimenting with bodies\r\nin laboratories in the different sciences has served to raise the\r\nquestion whether the mind may not be experimented with also. This\r\nquestion has been solved in so far that psychologists produce\r\nartificial changes in the stimulations to the senses and in the\r\narrangements of the objects and conditions existing about a person,\r\nand so secure changes also in his mental states. What we have seen of\r\nPhysiological Psychology illustrates this general way of proceeding,\r\nfor in such studies, changes in the physiological processes, as in\r\nbreathing, etc., are considered as causing changes in the mind. In\r\nExperimental Psychology, however, as distinguished from Physiological\r\nPsychology, we agree to take only those influences which are outside\r\nthe body, such as light, sound, temperature, etc., keeping the subject\r\nas normal as possible in all respects.\r\n\r\nA great many laboratories have now been established in connection with\r\nthe universities in Germany, France, and the United States. They\r\ndiffer very much from one another, but their common purpose is so to\r\nexperiment upon the mind, through changes in the stimulations to which\r\nthe individual is subjected, that tests may be made of his sensations,\r\nhis ability to remember, the exactness and kind of movements, etc.\r\n\r\nThe working of these laboratories and the sort of research carried out\r\nin them may be illustrated best, perhaps, by a description of some of\r\nthe results, apparatus, methods, etc., employed in my own laboratory\r\nduring the past year. The end in view will, I trust, be considered\r\nsufficient justification for the degree of personal reference which\r\nthis occasions; since greater concreteness and reality attach to\r\ndefinite descriptions such as this. The other laboratories, as those\r\nat Harvard and Columbia Universities, take up similar problems by\r\nsimilar methods. I shall therefore go on to describe some recent work\r\nin the Princeton laboratory.\r\n\r\nOf the problems taken up in the laboratory, certain ones may be\r\nselected for somewhat detailed explanation, since they are from widely\r\ndifferent spheres and illustrate different methods of procedure.\r\n\r\nI. _Experiments on the Temperature Sense._--For a score of years it\r\nhas been suspected that we have a distinct sense, with a nerve\r\napparatus of its own, for the feeling of different temperatures on the\r\nskin. Certain investigators found that this was probably true; it is\r\nproved by the fact that certain drugs alter the sensibility of the\r\nskin to hot and cold stimulations.\r\n\r\nAnother advance was made when it was found that sensations of either\r\nhot or cold may be had from regions which are insensible at the same\r\ntime to the other sort of stimulation, cold or hot. Certain minute\r\npoints were discovered which report cold when touched with a cold\r\npoint, but give no feeling from a hot object; while other points would\r\nrespond only with a sensation from heat, never giving cold. It was\r\nconcluded that we have two temperature senses, one for hot and the\r\nother for cold.\r\n\r\nTaking the problem at this point, Mr. C.[3] wished to define more\r\nclosely the relation of the two sorts of sensation to each other, and\r\nthought he could do so by a method by which he might repeat the\r\nstimulation of a series of exact spots, very minute points on the\r\nskin, over and over again, thus securing a number of records of the\r\nresults for both hot and cold over a given area. He chose an area of\r\nskin on the forearm, shaved it carefully, and proceeded to explore it\r\nwith the smallest points of metals which could be drawn along the skin\r\nwithout pricking or tearing. These points were attached to metallic\r\ncylinders, and around the cylinders rubber bands were placed; the\r\ncylinders were then thrust in hot or cold water kept at certain\r\nregular temperatures, and lifted by the rubber bands. They were placed\r\npoint down, with equal pressure, upon the points of the skin in the\r\narea chosen. In this way, points which responded only to hot, and also\r\nthose responding only to cold, were found, marked with delicate ink\r\nmarks in each case, until the whole area was explored and marked in\r\ndifferent colours. This had often been done before. It remained to\r\ndevise a way of keeping these records, so that the markings might all\r\nbe removed from the skin, and new explorations made over the same\r\nsurface. This was necessary in order to see whether the results\r\nsecured were always the same. The theory that there were certain\r\nnervous endings in the skin corresponding to the little points\r\nrequired that each spot should be in exactly the same place whenever\r\nthe experiment was repeated.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Mr. J. F. Crawford, graduate student.]\r\n\r\nMr. C. made a number of so-called "transparent transfer frames." They\r\nare rectangular pieces of cardboard, with windows cut in them. The\r\nwindows are covered with thin architect\'s paper, which is very\r\ntransparent. This frame is put over the forearm in such a way that the\r\npaper in the window comes over the markings made on the arm. The\r\nmarkings show through very clearly, and the points are copied on the\r\npaper. Then certain boundary marks at the corners are made, both on\r\nthe paper and on the arm, at exactly the same places, the frame is\r\nremoved, and all the markings on the arm are erased except the\r\nboundary points. The result is that at any time the frames can be put\r\nover the arm again by matching the boundary points, and then the\r\noriginal temperature spots on the skin will be shown by the markings\r\non the paper window.\r\n\r\nProceeding to repeat the exploration of the same area in this way, Mr.\r\nC makes records of many groupings of points for both hot and cold\r\nsensations on the same area; he then puts the frames one upon another,\r\nholds them up before a window so that they have a bright background,\r\nand is thus able to see at a glance how nearly the results of the\r\ndifferent sittings correspond.\r\n\r\nHis results, put very briefly, fail to confirm the theory that the\r\nsense of temperature has an apparatus of fixed spots for heat and\r\nother fixed spots for cold. For when he puts the different markings\r\nfor heat together he finds that the spots are not the same, but that\r\nthose of one frame fall between those of another, and if several are\r\nput together the points fill up a greater or smaller area. The same\r\nfor the cold spots; they fill a continuous area. He finds, however, as\r\nother investigators have found, that the heat areas are generally in\r\nlarge measure separate from the cold areas, only to a certain extent\r\noverlapping here and there, and also that there are regions of the\r\nskin where we have very little sense of either sort of temperature.\r\n\r\nThe general results will show, therefore, if they should be confirmed\r\nby other investigators, that our temperature sense is located in what\r\nmight be called somewhat large blotches on the skin, and not in minute\r\nspots; while the evidence still remains good, however, to show that we\r\nhave two senses for temperature, one for cold and the other for hot.\r\n\r\nII. _Reaction-Time Experiments._--Work in so-called "reaction times"\r\nconstitutes one of the most important and well-developed chapters in\r\nexperimental psychology. In brief, the experiment involved is this:\r\nTo find how long it takes a person to receive a sense impression of\r\nany kind--for example, to hear a sound-signal--and to move his hand or\r\nother member in response to the impression. A simple arrangement is as\r\nfollows: Sit the subject comfortably, tap a bell in such a way that\r\nthe tapping also makes an electric current and starts a clock, and\r\ninstruct the subject to press a button with his finger as soon as\r\npossible after he hears the bell. The pressing of the button by him\r\nbreaks the current and stops the clock. The dial of the clock\r\nindicates the actual time which has elapsed between the bell (signal)\r\nand his response with his finger (reaction). The clock used for exact\r\nwork is likely to be the Hipp chronoscope, which gives on its dials\r\nindications of time intervals in thousandths of a second. For the sake\r\nof keeping the conditions constant and preventing disturbance, the\r\nwires are made long, so that the clock and the experimenter may be in\r\none room, while the bell, the punch key, and the subject are in\r\nanother, with the door closed. This method of getting reaction times\r\nhas been in use for a number of years, especially by the astronomers\r\nwho need to know, in making their observations, how much time is taken\r\nby the observer in recording a transit or other observation. It is\r\npart of the astronomer\'s "personal equation."\r\n\r\nProceeding with this "simple-reaction" experiment as a basis, the\r\npsychologists have varied the instructions to the subject so as to\r\nsecure from him the different times which he takes for more\r\ncomplicated mental processes, such as distinguishing between two or\r\nmore impressions, counting, multiplying, dividing, etc., before\r\nreacting; or they have him wait for an associated idea to come up\r\nbefore giving his response, with many other variations. By comparing\r\nthese different times among themselves, interesting results are\r\nreached concerning the mental processes involved and also about the\r\ndifferences of different individuals in the simpler operations of\r\ntheir daily lives. The following research carried out by Mr. B.[4]\r\nserves to illustrate both of these assertions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: The writer.]\r\n\r\nMr. B. wished to inquire further into a fact found out by several\r\npersons by this method: the fact that there is an important difference\r\nin the length of a person\'s reaction time according to the direction\r\nof his attention during the experiment. If, for example, Mr. X. be\r\ntested, it is possible that he may prefer to attend strictly to the\r\nsignal, letting his finger push the key without direct care and\r\nsupervision. If this be true, and we then interfere with his way of\r\nproceeding, by telling him that he must attend to his finger, and\r\nallow the signal to take care of itself, we find that he has great\r\ndifficulty in doing so, grows embarrassed, and his reaction time\r\nbecomes very irregular and much longer. Yet another person, say Y, may\r\nshow just the opposite state of things; he finds it easier to pay\r\nattention to his hand, and when he does so he gets shorter and also\r\nmore regular times than when he attends to the signal-sound.\r\n\r\nIt occurred to Mr. B. that the striking differences given by different\r\npersons in this matter of the most favourable direction of the\r\nattention might be connected with the facts brought out by the\r\nphysiological psychologists in connection with speech; namely, that\r\none person is a "visual," in speaking, using mainly sight images of\r\nwords, while another is a "motor," using mainly muscular images, and\r\nyet another an "auditive," using mainly sound images. If the\r\ndifferences are so marked in the matter of speech, it seemed likely\r\nthat they might also extend to other functions, and the so-called\r\n"type" of a person in his speech might show itself in the relative\r\nlengths of his reaction times according as he attended to one class of\r\nimages or another.\r\n\r\nCalling this the "type theory" of reaction times, and setting about\r\ntesting four different persons in the laboratory, the problem was\r\ndivided into two parts; first, to direct all the individuals selected\r\nto find out, by examining their mental preferences in speaking,\r\nreading, writing, dreaming, etc., the class of images which they\r\nordinarily depended most upon; and then to see by a series of\r\nexperiments whether their reaction times to these particular classes\r\nof images were shorter than to others, and especially whether the\r\ntimes were shorter when attention was given to these images than when\r\nit was given to the muscles used in the reactions. The meaning of this\r\nwould be that if the reaction should be shorter to these images than\r\nto the corresponding muscle images, or to the other classes of images,\r\nthen the reaction time of an individual would show his mental type and\r\nbe of use in testing it. This would be a very important matter if it\r\nshould hold, seeing that many questions both in medicine and in\r\neducation, which involve the ascertaining of the mental character of\r\nthe individual person, would profit by such an exact method.\r\n\r\nThe results on all the subjects confirmed the supposition. For\r\nexample, one of them, Mr. C., found from an independent examination of\r\nhimself, most carefully made, that he depended very largely upon his\r\nhearing in all the functions mentioned. When he thought of words, he\r\nremembered how they sounded; when he dreamed, his dreams were full of\r\nconversation and other sounds. When he wrote, he thought continually\r\nof the way the words and sentences would sound if spoken. Without\r\nknowing of this, many series of reaction experiments were made on him;\r\nthe result showed a remarkable difference between the lengths of his\r\nreactions, according as he directed his attention to the sound or to\r\nhis hand; a difference showing his time to be one half shorter when he\r\npaid attention to the sound. The same was seen when he reacted to\r\nlights; the attention went preferably to the light, not to the hand;\r\nbut the difference was less than in the case of sounds. So it was an\r\nunmistakable fact in his case that the results of the reaction\r\nexperiments agreed with his independent decision as to his mental\r\ntype.\r\n\r\nIn none of the cases did this correspondence fail, although all were\r\nnot so pronounced in their type preferences as was Mr. C.\r\n\r\nThe second part of the research had in view the question whether\r\nreaction times taken upon speech would show the same thing; that is,\r\nwhether in Mr. C.\'s case, for example, it would be found that his\r\nreaction made by speaking, as soon as he heard the signal or saw the\r\nlight, would be shorter when he paid attention to the signal than when\r\nhe gave attention to his mouth and lips. For this purpose a mouth key\r\nwas used which made it possible for the subject simply by emitting a\r\npuff of breath from the lips, to break an electric current and thus\r\nstop the chronoscope as soon as possible after hearing the signal.\r\nThe mouth key is figured herewith (Fig. 6).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--Mouth-key (Isometric drawing) The metallic\r\ntongue E swings over the mercury H, making or breaking the circuit A H\r\nE D B or C E H A. The tongue is moved by a puff of air through the\r\nfunnel F. (Devised by Prof. W. Libbey.)]\r\n\r\nThis experiment was also carried out on all the subjects, none of them\r\nhaving any knowledge of the end in view, and the experimenters also\r\nnot having, as yet, worked out the results of the earlier research. In\r\nall the cases, again, the results showed that, for speech, the same\r\nthing held as for the hand--namely, that the shortest reaction times\r\nwere secured when the subject paid attention to the class of images\r\nfor which he had a general preference. In Mr. C.\'s case, for example,\r\nit was found that the time it took him to speak was much shorter when\r\nhe paid strict attention to the expected sound than when he attended\r\nto his vocal organs. So for the other cases. If the individual\'s\r\ngeneral preference is for muscular images, we find that the quickest\r\ntime is made when attention is given to the mouth and lips. Such is\r\nthe case with Mr. B.\r\n\r\nThe general results go to show, therefore--and four cases showing no\r\nexception, added to the indications found by other writers, make a\r\ngeneral conclusion very probable--that in the differences in reaction\r\ntimes, as secured by giving the attention this way or that, we have\r\ngeneral indications of the individual\'s temperament, or at least of\r\nhis mental preferences as set by his education. These indications\r\nagree with those found in the cases of aphasia known as "motor,"\r\n"visual," "auditory," etc., already mentioned. The early examination\r\nof children by this method would probably be of great service in\r\ndetermining proper courses of treatment, subjects of study, modes of\r\ndiscipline, tendencies to fatigue and embarrassment, and the direction\r\nof best progress in education.\r\n\r\nThis research may be taken to illustrate the use of the reaction-time\r\nmethod in investigating such complex processes as attention,\r\ntemperament, etc. The department which includes the various time\r\nmeasurements in psychology is now called Mental Chronometry, the older\r\nterm, Psychometry, being less used on account of its ambiguity.\r\n\r\nIII. _An Optical Illusion._--In the sphere of vision many very\r\ninteresting facts are constantly coming to light. Sight is the most\r\ncomplex of the senses, the most easily deranged, and, withal, the most\r\nnecessary to our normal existence. The report of the following\r\nexperimental study will have the greater utility, since, apart from\r\nany intrinsic novelty or importance the results may prove to have, it\r\nshows some of the general bearings of the facts of vision in relation\r\nto \xc3\x86sthetics, to the theory of Illusions, and to the function of\r\nJudgment.\r\n\r\nIllusion of the senses is due either to purely physiological causes or\r\nto the operation of the principle of Assimilation, which has already\r\nbeen remarked upon. In the latter case it illustrates the fact that at\r\nany time there is a general disposition of the mind to look upon a\r\nthing under certain forms, patterns, etc., to which it has grown\r\naccustomed; and to do this it is led sometimes to distort what it sees\r\nor hears unconsciously to itself. So it falls into errors of judgment\r\nthrough the trap which is set by its own manner of working. Nowhere is\r\nthe matter better illustrated than in the sphere of vision. The number\r\nof illusions of vision is remarkable. We are constantly taking shapes\r\nand forms for something slightly different from what, by measurement,\r\nwe actually find them to be. And psychologists are attempting--with\r\nrather poor success so far--to find some general principles of the\r\nmechanism of vision which will account for the great variety of its\r\nillusions.\r\n\r\nAmong these principles one is known as Contrast. It is hardly a\r\nprinciple as yet. It is rather a word used to cover all illusions\r\nwhich spring up when surfaces of different sizes and shapes, looked at\r\ntogether or successively, are misjudged with reference to one another.\r\nWishing to investigate this in a simple way, the following experiment\r\nwas planned and carried out by Mr. B.\r\n\r\nHe wished to find out whether, if two detached surfaces of different\r\nsizes be gazed at together, the linear distances of the field of\r\nvision (the whole scene visible at once) would be at all misjudged. To\r\ntest this, he put in the window (W)[5] of the dark room a filling of\r\nwhite cardboard in which two square holes had been cut (S S\'). The\r\nsides of the squares were of certain very unequal lengths. Then a slit\r\nwas made between the middle points of the sides of the squares next to\r\neach other, so that there was a narrow path or trough joining the\r\nsquares between their adjacent sides. Inside the dark room he arranged\r\na bright light so that it would illuminate this trough, but not be\r\nseen by a person seated some distance in front of the window in the\r\nnext room. A needle (D) was hung on a pivot behind the cardboard, so\r\nthat its point could move along the bright trough in either direction;\r\nand on the needle was put the armature (A) of an electro-magnet which,\r\nwhen a current passed, would be drawn instantly to the magnet (E), and\r\nso stop the needle exactly at the point which it had then reached. A\r\nclock motor (Cm) was arranged in such a way as to carry the needle\r\nback and forth regularly over the slit; and the electro-magnet was\r\nconnected by wires with a punch key (K) on a table beside the subject\r\nin the next room. All being now ready, the subject, Mr. S., is told to\r\nwatch the needle which appears as a bead of light travelling along the\r\nslit, and stop it when it comes to the middle point of the line, by\r\npressing the electric key. The experimenter, who stands behind the\r\nwindow in the dark room, reads on a scale (mm.) marked in millimetres\r\nthe exact point at which the needle stops, releases the needle by\r\nbreaking the current, thus allowing it to return slowly over the line\r\nagain. This gives the subject another opportunity to stop it at what\r\nhe judges to be the exact middle of the line, and so on. The\r\naccompanying figure (Fig. 7) shows the entire arrangement.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: This and the following letters in parentheses refer to\r\nFig. 7]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7]\r\n\r\nA great many experiments performed in this way, with the squares set\r\nboth vertically and horizontally, and with several persons, brought a\r\nstriking and very uniform result. The point selected by the subject as\r\nthe middle is regularly too far toward the smaller square. Not a\r\nlittle, indeed, but a very appreciable amount. The amount of the\r\ndisplacement, or, roughly speaking, of the illusion, increases as the\r\nlarger square is made larger and the smaller one smaller; or, put in a\r\nsentence, the amount varies directly with the ratio of the smaller to\r\nthe larger square side.\r\n\r\nFinding such an unmistakable illusion by this method, Mr. B. thought\r\nthat if it could be tested by an appeal to people generally, it would\r\nbe of great gain. It occurred to him that the way to do this would be\r\nto reverse the conditions of the experiment in the following way: He\r\nprepared the figures given in Plate I, in which the two squares are\r\nmade of suitable relative size, a line is drawn between them, and a\r\npoint on the line is plainly marked. This he had printed in a weekly\r\njournal, and asked the readers of the journal to get their friends,\r\nafter merely looking at the figure (i. e., without knowing the result\r\nto be expected), to say--as the reader may now do before reading\r\nfurther--whether the point on the line (Plate I) is in the middle or\r\nnot; and if not, in which direction from the true middle it lies. The\r\nresults from hundreds of persons of all manner of occupations, ages,\r\nand of both sexes, agree in saying that the point lies too far toward\r\nthe larger square. In reality it is in the exact middle. This is just\r\nthe opposite of the result of the experiments in the laboratory, where\r\nthe conditions were the reverse, i. e., to find the middle as it\r\nappears to the eye. Here, therefore, we have a complete confirmation\r\nof the illusion; and it is now fully established that in all cases in\r\nwhich the conditions of this experiment are realized we make a\r\nconstant mistake in estimating distances by the eye.[6]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: In redrawing the figure on a larger sheet (which is\r\nrecommended), the connecting line may be omitted, only the mid-point\r\nbeing marked. Some get a better effect with two circles, the\r\nintervening distance being divided midway by a dot, as in Plate II.]\r\n\r\nFor instance, if a town committee wish to erect a statue to their\r\nlocal hero in the public square, and if on two opposite sides of the\r\nsquare there are buildings of very different heights, the statue\r\nshould not be put in the exact middle of the square, if it is to give\r\nthe best effect from a distance. It should be placed a little toward\r\nthe smaller building. A colleague of the writer found, when this was\r\nfirst made public, that the pictures in his house had actually been\r\nhung in such a way as to allow for this illusion. Whenever a picture\r\nwas to be put up between two others of considerable difference of\r\nsize, or between a door (large) and a window (small), it had actually\r\nbeen hung a little nearer to the smaller--toward the small picture or\r\ntoward the window--and not in the true middle.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that interesting applications of this illusion may be\r\ndiscovered in \xc3\xa6sthetics. For wherever in drawing or painting it is\r\nwished to indicate to the observer that a point is midway between two\r\nlines of different lengths, we should find that the artist, in order\r\nto produce this effect most adequately, deviates a little from the\r\ntrue middle. So in architecture, the effect of a contrast of masses\r\noften depends upon the sense of bilateral balance, symmetry, or\r\nequality, in which this visual error would naturally come into play.\r\nIndeed, it is only necessary to recall to mind that one of the\r\nprincipal laws of \xc3\xa6sthetic effect in the matter of right line\r\nproportion is the relation of "one to one," as it is called, or equal\r\ndivision, to see the wide sphere of application of this illusion. In\r\nall such cases the mistake of judgment would have to be allowed for if\r\nmasses of unequal size lie at the ends of the line which is to be\r\ndivided.\r\n\r\nIV. _The Accuracy of Memory._--Another investigation may be cited to\r\nillustrate quite a different department. It aimed to find out\r\nsomething about the rate at which memory fades with the lapse of time.\r\nMessrs. W., S., and B.[7] began by formulating the different ways in\r\nwhich tests may be made on individuals to see how accurate their\r\nmemories are after different periods of time. They found that three\r\ndifferent tests might be employed, and called them "methods" of\r\ninvestigating memory. These are, first, the method of Reproduction.\r\nThe individual is asked to reproduce, as in an oral or written\r\nexamination, what he remembers of something told him a certain time\r\nbefore. This is the ordinary method of the schools and colleges, of\r\ncivil-service examinations, etc. Second, the method of Identification,\r\nwhich calls upon the person to identify a thing, sentence, report,\r\netc., a second or third time, as being the same in all respects as\r\nthat which he experienced the first time it appeared. Third, the\r\nmethod of Selection, in which we show to the person a number of\r\nthings, sentences, reports, descriptions of objects, etc., and require\r\nhim to select from them the ones which are exactly the same as those\r\nhe has had before. These methods will be better understood from the\r\naccount now to be given of the way they were carried out on a large\r\nnumber of students.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Prof. H. C. Warren, Mr. W. J. Shaw, and the writer.]\r\n\r\nThe first experiments were made by Messrs. S. and B. in the University\r\nof Toronto on a class of students numbering nearly three hundred, of\r\nwhom about one third were women. The instructors showed to the class\r\ncertain squares of cardboard of suitable size, and asked them to do\r\nthe following three things on different days: First, to reproduce from\r\nmemory, with pencil on paper, squares of the same size as those shown,\r\nafter intervals of one, ten, twenty, and forty minutes (this gives\r\nresults by the method of Reproduction); second, to say whether a new\r\nset of squares, which were shown to them after the same intervals,\r\nwere the same in size as those which they had originally seen,\r\nsmaller, or larger (illustrating the method of Identification); third,\r\nthey were shown a number of squares of slightly different sizes, again\r\nat the same intervals, and asked to select from them the ones which\r\nthey found to be the same size as those originally seen (method of\r\nSelection).\r\n\r\nThe results from all these experiments were combined with those of\r\nanother series, secured from a large class of Princeton students; and\r\nthe figure (Fig. 8) shows by curves something of the result. The\r\nfigure is given in order that the reader may understand by its\r\nexplanation the "graphic method" of plotting statistical results,\r\nwhich, with various complications, is now employed in psychology as\r\nwell as in the other positive sciences.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--Memory curves: I. Method of Selection. II.\r\nMethod of Identification.]\r\n\r\nBriefly described in words, it was found that the three methods agreed\r\n(the curves are parallel)[8] in showing that during the first ten\r\nminutes there was a great falling off in the accuracy of memory (slant\r\nin the curves from 0 to 10); that then, between ten and twenty\r\nminutes, memory remained relatively faithful (the curves are nearly\r\nlevel from 10 to 20), and that a rapid falling off in accuracy\r\noccurred after twenty minutes (shown by the slant in the lines from 20\r\nto 40).\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: This figure shows curves for two of the methods only,\r\nSelection and Identification.]\r\n\r\nFurther, the different positions of the curves show certain things\r\nwhen properly understood. The curve secured by the method of\r\nReproduction (not given in the figure) shows results which are least\r\naccurate, because most variable. The reason of this is that in drawing\r\nthe squares to reproduce the one remembered, the student is\r\ninfluenced by the size of the paper he uses, by the varying accuracy\r\nof his control over his hand and arm (the results vary, for example,\r\naccording as he uses his right or left hand), and by all sorts of\r\nassociations with square objects which may at the time be in his mind.\r\nIn short, this method gives his memory of the square a chance to be\r\nfully assimilated to his current mental state during the interval, and\r\nthere is no corrective outside of him to keep him true.\r\n\r\nThat this difficulty is a real one no one who has examined students\r\nwill be disposed to deny. When we ask them to reproduce what the\r\ntext-book or the professor\'s lectures have taught, we also ask them to\r\nexpress themselves accurately. Now the science of correct expression\r\nis a thing in which the average student has had no training. With his\r\ndifficulty in remembering is connected his difficulty of expression;\r\nand with it all goes a certain embarrassment, due to responsibility,\r\npersonal fear, and dread of disgrace. So the results finally obtained\r\nby this method are really very complex.\r\n\r\nOne of the curves, that given by the method of Selection (I), also\r\nshows memory to be interfered with by a certain influence. We saw in\r\nconnection with the experiments reported above that, even in the most\r\nelementary arrangements of squares in the visual fields, an element of\r\ncontrast comes in to interfere with our judgment of size. This we find\r\nconfirmed in these experiments when the method of Selection is used.\r\nBy this method we show a number of squares side by side, asking the\r\nindividual to select the one he saw before. All the squares, being\r\nshown at once, come into contrast with one another on the background;\r\nand so his judgment of the size of the one he remembers is distorted.\r\nThis, again, is a real influence in our mental lives, leading to\r\nactual illusion. An unscrupulous lawyer may gradually modify the story\r\nwhich his client or a witness tells by constantly adding to what is\r\nreally remembered, other details so expertly contrasted with the\r\nfacts, or so neatly interposed among them, that the witness gradually\r\nincorporates them in his memory and so testifies more nearly as the\r\nlawyer desires. In our daily lives another element of contrast is also\r\nvery strong--that due to social opinion. We constantly modify our\r\nmemories to agree more closely with the truths of social belief,\r\nparing down unconsciously the difference between our own and others\'\r\nreports of things. If several witnesses of an event be allowed to\r\ncompare notes from time to time, they will gradually come to tell more\r\nnearly the same story.\r\n\r\nThe other curve (II) in the figure, that secured by the method of\r\nIdentification, seemed to the investigators to be the most accurate.\r\nIt is not subject to the errors due to expression and to contrast, and\r\nit has the advantage of allowing the subject the right to recognise\r\nthe square. It is shown to him again, with no information that it is\r\nthe same, and he decides whether from his remembrance of the earlier\r\none, it is the same or not. The only objection to this method is that\r\nit requires a great many experiments in order to get an average\r\nresult. To be reliable, an average must be secured, seeing that, for\r\none or two or a few trials, the student may guess right without\r\nremembering the original square at all. By taking a large number of\r\npersons, such as the three hundred students, this objection may be\r\novercome. Comparing the averages, for example, of the results given\r\nby the men and women respectively, we found practically no difference\r\nbetween them.\r\n\r\nThis last point may serve to introduce a distinction which is\r\nimportant in all work in experimental psychology, and one which is\r\nrecognised also in many other sciences--the distinction between\r\nresults obtained respectively from one individual and from many. Very\r\noften the only way to learn truth about a single individual is to\r\ninvestigate a number together. In all large classes of things,\r\nespecially living things, there are great individual differences, and\r\nin any particular case this personal variation may be so large that it\r\nobscures the real nature of the normal. For example, three large sons\r\nmay be born to two small parents; and from this case alone it might be\r\ninferred that all small parents have large sons. Or three girls might\r\nhave better memories than three boys in the same family or school, and\r\nfrom this it might be argued that girls are better endowed in this\r\ndirection than boys. In all such cases the proper thing to do is to\r\nget a large number of cases and combine them; then the preponderance\r\nwhich the first cases examined may have shown, in one direction or the\r\nother, is corrected. This gives rise to what is called the statistical\r\nmethod; it is used in many practical matters, such as life insurance,\r\nbut its application to the facts of life, mind, variation, evolution,\r\netc., is only begun. Its neglect in psychology is one of the crying\r\ndefects of much recent work. Its use in complicated problems involves\r\na mathematical training which people generally do not possess; and its\r\nmisuse through lack of exactness of observation or ignorance of the\r\nrequirements is worse than its neglect.\r\n\r\nAnother result came out in connection with these experiments on\r\nmemory, which, apart from its practical interest, may serve to show an\r\nadditional resource of experimental psychology. In making up the\r\nresults of a series of experiments it is very important to observe the\r\nway in which the different cases differ from one another. Some cases\r\nmay be so nearly alike that the most extreme of them are not far from\r\nthe average of them all; as we find, for example, if we measure a\r\nthousand No. 10 shot. But now suppose we mix in with the No. 10 some\r\nNo. 6 and some No. 14, and then take the average size; we may now get\r\njust the same average, and we can tell that this pile is different\r\nfrom the other only by observing the individual measurements of the\r\nsingle shot and setting down the relative frequency of each particular\r\nsize. Or, again, we may get a different average size in one of two\r\nways: either by taking another lot of uniform No. 14 shot, let us say,\r\nor by mixing with the No. 10 a few very large bullets. Which is\r\nactually the case would be shown only by the examination of the\r\nindividual cases. This is usually done by comparing each case with the\r\naverage of the whole lot, and taking the average of the differences\r\nthus secured--a quantity called the "mean variation."\r\n\r\nIn the case of the experiments with the squares, the errors in the\r\njudgments of the students were found to lie always in one direction.\r\nThe answers all tended to show that they took, for the one originally\r\nshown, a square which was really too large. Casting about for the\r\nreason of this, it was considered necessary to explain it by the\r\nsupposition that the square remembered had in the interval become\r\nenlarged in memory. The image was larger when called up after ten or\r\ntwenty minutes than it was before. This might be due to a purely\r\nmental process; or possibly to a sort of spreading-out of the brain\r\nprocess in the visual centre, giving the result that whenever, by the\r\nrevival of the brain process, the mental image is brought back again\r\nto mind, this spreading out shows itself by an enlargement of the\r\nmemory image. However it may be explained, the indications of it were\r\nunmistakable--unless, of course, some other reason can be given for\r\nthe uniform direction of the errors; and it is further seen in other\r\nexperiments carried out by Messrs. W. and B. and by Dr. K.[9] at a\r\nlater date.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Dr. F. Kennedy, demonstrator, now professor in the\r\nUniversity of Colorado (results not yet published).]\r\n\r\nIf this tendency to the enlargement of our memories with the lapse of\r\ntime should be found to be a general law of memory, it would have\r\ninteresting bearings. It would suggest, for instance, an explanation\r\nof the familiar fact that the scenes of the past seem to us, when we\r\nreturn to them, altogether too small. Our childhood home, the old\r\nflower garden, the height of house and trees, and even that of our\r\nhero uncle, all seem to the returning traveller of adult life\r\nridiculously small. That we expect them to be larger may result from\r\nthe fact that the memory images have undergone change in the direction\r\nof enlargement.\r\n\r\nV. _Suggestion._--Space permits only the mention of another research,\r\nwhich, however, should not be altogether omitted, since it illustrates\r\nyet other problems and the principles of their solution. This is an\r\ninvestigation by Messrs. T. and H.,[10] which shows the remarkable\r\ninfluence of mental suggestions upon certain bodily processes which\r\nhave always been considered purely physiological. These investigators\r\nset out to repeat certain experiments of others which showed that if\r\ntwo points, say those of a pair of compasses, be somewhat separated\r\nand put upon the skin, two sensations of contact come from the points.\r\nBut if while the experiment is being performed the points be brought\r\nconstantly nearer to each other, a time arrives when the two are felt\r\nas only one, although they may be still some distance apart. The\r\nphysiologists argued from this that there were minute nerve endings in\r\nthe skin at least so far apart as the least distance at which the\r\npoints were felt as two; and that when the points were so close\r\ntogether that they only touched one of these nerve endings, only one\r\nsensation was produced. Mr. T. had already found, working in Germany,\r\nthat, with practice, the skin gradually became more and more able to\r\ndiscriminate the two points--that is, to feel the two at smaller\r\ndistances; and, further, that the exercise of the skin in this way on\r\none side of the body not only made that locality more sensitive to\r\nminute differences, but had the same effect, singularly, on the\r\ncorresponding place on the other side of the body. This, our\r\nexperimenters inferred, could only be due to the continued suggestion\r\nin the mind of the subject that he should feel two points, the result\r\nbeing an actual heightening of the sensibility of the skin. When he\r\nthought that he was becoming more sensitive on one side--and really\r\nwas--this sense or belief of his took effect in some way in both\r\nhemispheres of his brain, and so both sides of the body were alike\r\naffected.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: G. A. Tawney, now professor in Beloit College, and C. W.\r\nHodge, now professor in Lafayette College.]\r\n\r\nThis led to other experiments in Princeton in which suggestions were\r\nactually made to the subjects that they were to become more or less\r\nsensitive to distance and direction between the points on the skin,\r\nwith the striking result that these suggestions actually took effect\r\nall over the body. This was so accurately determined that from the\r\nresults of the experiments with the compasses on the skin in this case\r\nor that, pretty accurate inferences could be made as to what mental\r\nsuggestions the subject was getting at the time. There was no chance\r\nfor deception in the results, for the experiments were so controlled\r\nthat the subject did not know until afterward of the correspondences\r\nactually reached between his states of mind and the variations in\r\nsensibility of the skin.\r\n\r\nThis slight report of the work done in one laboratory in about two\r\nsessions, involving a considerable variety of topics, may give an\r\nidea, so far as it goes, of the sort of work which experimental\r\npsychology is setting itself to do. It will be seen that there is as\r\nyet no well-knit body of results on which new experiments may proceed,\r\nand no developed set of experimental arrangements, such as other\r\npositive sciences show. The procedure is, in many important matters,\r\nstill a matter of the individual worker\'s judgment and ability. Even\r\nfor the demonstrations attempted for undergraduate students, good and\r\ncheap apparatus is still lacking. For these reasons it is premature as\r\nyet to expect that this branch of the science will cut much of a\r\nfigure in education. There can be no doubt, however, that it is making\r\nmany interesting contributions to our knowledge of the mind, and that\r\nwhen it is more adequately organized and developed in its methods and\r\napparatus, It will become the basis of discipline of a certain kind\r\nlying between that of physical science and that of the humanities,\r\nsince it will have features in common with the biological and natural\r\nsciences. Its results may be expected also to lead to better results\r\nthan we now have in the theory and practice of education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nSUGGESTION IN CHILDREN AND ADULTS--HYPNOTISM.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn an earlier place certain illustrations of Suggestion have been\r\ngiven. By Suggestion we mean the fact that all sorts of hints from\r\nwithout disturb and modify the beliefs and actions of the individual.\r\nCertain cases from my own observation may be given which will make the\r\nmatter clear.\r\n\r\n_Physiological Suggestion._--Observation of an infant for the first\r\nmonth or six weeks after birth leads to the conviction that his life\r\nis mainly physiological. When the actions which are purely reflex,\r\ntogether with certain random impulsive movements, are noted, we seem\r\nto exhaust the case.\r\n\r\nYet even at this remarkably early stage H. was found to be in some\r\ndegree receptive to certain Suggestions conveyed by repeated\r\nstimulation under uniform conditions. In the first place, the\r\nsuggestions of sleep began to tell upon her before the end of the\r\nfirst month. Her nurse put her to sleep by laying her face down and\r\npatting gently upon the end of her spine. This position soon became\r\nitself not only suggestive to the child of sleep, but sometimes\r\nnecessary to sleep, even when she was laid across the nurse\'s lap in\r\nwhat seemed to be an uncomfortable position.\r\n\r\nThis case illustrates what may be called Physiological Suggestion. It\r\nshows the law of physiological habit as it borders on the conscious.\r\n\r\nThe same sort of phenomena appear also in adult life. Positions given\r\nto the limbs of a sleeper lead to movements ordinarily associated with\r\nthese positions. The sleeper defends himself, withdraws himself from\r\ncold, etc. Children learn gradually to react upon conditions of\r\nposition, lack of support, etc., of the body, with those actions\r\nnecessary to keep from falling, which adults have so perfectly. All\r\nsecondary automatic reactions may be classed here; the sensations\r\ncoming from one action, as in walking, being suggestions to the next\r\nmovement, unconsciously acted upon. The consciousness at any stage in\r\nthe chain of movements, if present at all, must be similar to the\r\nbaby\'s in the case above--a mere internal glimmering. The most we can\r\nsay of such physiological suggestion is, that there is probably some\r\nconsciousness, and that the ordinary reflexes seem to be abbreviated\r\nand improved.\r\n\r\n_Subconscious Adult Suggestion._--There are certain phenomena of a\r\nrather striking kind coming under this head whose classification is so\r\nevident that we may enumerate them without discussion of the general\r\nprinciples which they involve.\r\n\r\n_Tune Suggestion._--It has been pointed out recently that dream states\r\nare largely indebted for their visual elements--what we see in our\r\ndreams--to accidental lines, patches, etc., in the field of vision\r\nwhen the eyes are shut, due to the distended blood vessels of the\r\ncornea and lids, to changes in the external illumination, to the\r\npresence of dust particles of different configuration, etc. The other\r\nsenses also undoubtedly contribute to the texture of our dreams by\r\nequally subconscious suggestions. There is no doubt, further, that our\r\nwaking life is constantly influenced by such trivial stimulations.\r\n\r\nI have tested in detail, for example, the conditions of the rise of\r\nso-called "internal tunes"--we speak of "tunes in our head" or "in our\r\nears"--and find certain suggestive influences which in most cases\r\ncause these tunes to rise and take their course. Often, when a tune\r\nsprings up "in my head," the same tune has been lately sung or\r\nwhistled in my hearing, though quite unnoticed at the time. Often the\r\ntunes are those heard in church the previous day or earlier. Such a\r\ntune I am entirely unable to recall voluntarily; yet when it comes\r\ninto the mind\'s ear, so to speak, I readily recognise it as belonging\r\nto an earlier day\'s experience. Other cases show various accidental\r\nsuggestions, such as the tune Mozart suggested by the composer\'s name,\r\nthe tune Gentle Annie suggested by the name Annie, etc. In all these\r\ncases it is only after the tune has taken possession of consciousness\r\nand after much seeking that the suggesting influence is discovered.\r\n\r\nCloser analysis reveals certain additional facts: The "time" of such\r\ninternal tunes is usually dictated by some rhythmical subconscious\r\noccurrence. After hearty meals it is always the time of the heart\r\nbeat, unless there be "in the air" some more impressive stimulus; as,\r\nfor example, when on shipboard, the beat is with me invariably that of\r\nthe engine throbs. When walking it is the rhythm of the footfall. On\r\none occasion a knock of four beats on the door started the\r\nMarseillaise in my ear; following up this clew, I found that at any\r\ntime different divisions of musical time being struck on the table at\r\nwill by another person, tunes would spring up and run on, getting\r\ntheir cue from the measures suggested. Further, when a tune dies away,\r\nits last notes often suggest, some time after, another having a\r\nsimilar movement--just as we pass from one tune to another in a\r\n"medley." It may also be noted that in my case the tune memories are\r\nauditive: they run in my head when I have no words for them and have\r\nnever sung them--an experience which is consistent with the fact that\r\nthese "internal tunes" arise in childhood before the faculty of\r\nspeech. They also have distinct pitch. For example, I once found a\r\ntune "in my head" which was perfectly familiar, but for which I could\r\nfind no words. Tested on the piano, the pitch was F-sharp and the time\r\nwas my heart beat. Finally, after much effort, I got the unworthy\r\nwords "Wait till the clouds roll by" by humming the tune over\r\nrepeatedly. The pitch is determined probably by the accidental\r\ncondition of the auditory centre in the brain or by the pitch of the\r\nexternal sound which serves as stimulus to the tune.\r\n\r\n_Normal Auto-Suggestion._--A further class of Suggestions, which fall\r\nunder the general phrase Auto-suggestion, or Self-suggestion of a\r\nnormal type, may be illustrated. In experimenting upon the possibility\r\nof suggesting sleep to another I have found certain strong reactive\r\ninfluences upon my own mental condition. Such an effort, which\r\ninvolves the picturing of another as asleep, is a strong\r\nAuto-suggestion of sleep, taking effect in my own case in about five\r\nminutes if the conditions be kept constant. The more clearly the\r\npatient\'s sleep is pictured the stronger becomes the subjective\r\nfeeling of drowsiness. After about ten minutes the ability to give\r\nstrong concentration seems to disintegrate, attention is renewed only\r\nby fits and starts and in the presence of great, mental inertia, and\r\nthe oncoming of sleep is almost overpowering. An unfailing cure for\r\ninsomnia, speaking for myself, is the persistent effort to put some\r\none else asleep by hard thinking of the end in view, with a continued\r\ngentle movement, such as stroking the other with the hand.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is impossible to bring on a state of drowsiness\r\nby imagining myself asleep. The first effort at this, indeed, is\r\npromising, for it leads to a state of restfulness and ease akin to the\r\nmental composure which is the usual preliminary to sleep; but it goes\r\nno further. It is succeeded by a state of steady wakefulness, which\r\neffort of attention or effort not to attend only intensifies. If the\r\nvictim of insomnia could only forget that he is thus afflicted, could\r\nforget himself altogether, his case would be more hopeful. The\r\ncontrast between this condition and that already described shows that\r\nit is the Self-idea, with the emotions it awakens,[11] which prevents\r\nthe suggestion from realizing itself and probably accounts for many\r\ncases of insomnia.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: A friend informs me that when he pictures himself dead\r\nhe can not help feeling gratified that he makes so handsome a\r\ncorpse.]\r\n\r\n_Sense Exaltation._--Recent discussions of Hypnotism have shown the\r\nremarkable "exaltation" which the senses may attain in somnambulism,\r\ntogether with a corresponding refinement in the interpretative\r\nfaculty. This is described more fully below. Events, etc., quite\r\nsubconscious, usually become suggestions of direct influence upon the\r\nsubject. Unintended gestures, habitual with the experimenter, may\r\nsuffice to hypnotize his accustomed subject. The possibility of such\r\ntraining of the senses in the normal state has not had sufficient\r\nemphasis. The young child\'s subtle discriminations of facial and other\r\npersonal indications are remarkable. The prolonged experience of\r\nputting H. to sleep--extending over a period of more than six months,\r\nduring which I slept beside her bed--served to make me alive to a\r\ncertain class of suggestions otherwise quite beyond notice. It is well\r\nknown that mothers are awake to the needs of their infants when they\r\nare asleep to everything else.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, we may note the intense auto-suggestion of sleep\r\nalready pointed out, under the stimulus of repeated nursery rhymes or\r\nother regular devices regularly resorted to in putting the child\r\nasleep. Second, surprising progressive exaltation of the hearing and\r\ninterpretation of sounds coming from her in a dark room. At the end of\r\nfour or five months, her movements in bed awoke me or not according as\r\nshe herself was awake or not. Frequently after awaking I was\r\ndistinctly aware of what movements of hers had awaked me.[12] A\r\nmovement of her head by which it was held up from the pillow was\r\nreadily distinguished from the restless movements of her sleep. It was\r\nnot so much, therefore, exaltation of hearing as exaltation of the\r\nfunction of the recognition of sounds heard and of their\r\ndiscrimination.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: This fact is analogous to our common experience of being\r\nawaked by a loud noise and then hearing it after we awake; yet the\r\nexplanation is not the same.]\r\n\r\nAgain, the same phenomenon to an equally marked degree attended the\r\nsound of her breathing. It is well enough known that the smallest\r\nfunctional bodily changes induce changes in both the rapidity and the\r\nquality of the respiration. In sleep the muscles of inhalation and\r\nexhalation are relaxed, inhalation becomes long and deep, exhalation\r\nshort and exhaustive, and the rhythmic intervals of respiration much\r\nlengthened. Now degrees of relative wakefulness are indicated with\r\nsurprising delicacy by the slight respiration sounds given forth by\r\nthe sleeper. Professional nurses learn to interpret these indications\r\nwith great skill. This exaltation of hearing became very pronounced in\r\nmy operations with the child. After some experience the peculiar\r\nbreathing of advancing or actual wakefulness in her was sufficient to\r\nwake me. And when awake myself the change in the infant\'s respiration\r\nsounds to those indicative of oncoming sleep was sufficient to suggest\r\nor bring on sleep in myself. In the dark, also, the general character\r\nof her breathing sounds was interpreted with great accuracy in terms\r\nof her varied needs, her comfort or discomfort, etc. The same kind of\r\nsuggestion from the respiration sounds now troubles me whenever one of\r\nthe children is sleeping within hearing distance.[13]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: This is an unpleasant result which is confirmed by\r\nprofessional infants\' nurses. They complain of loss of sleep when off\r\nduty. Mrs. James Murray, an infants\' nurse in Toronto, informs me\r\nthat she finds it impossible to sleep when she has no infant in\r\nhearing distance, and for that reason she never asks for a vacation.\r\nHer normal sleep has evidently come to depend upon continuous\r\nsoporific suggestions from a child. In another point, also, her\r\nexperience confirms my observations, viz., the child\'s movements,\r\npreliminary to waking, awake her, when no other movements of the child\r\ndo so--the consequence being that she is ready for the infant when it\r\ngets fully awake and cries out.]\r\n\r\nThe reactions in movement upon these suggestions are very marked and\r\nappropriate, in customary or habitual lines, although the stimulations\r\nare quite subconscious. The clearest illustrations in this body of my\r\nexperiences were afforded by my responses in crude songs to the\r\ninfant\'s waking movements and breathing sounds. I have often waked\r\nmyself by myself singing one of two nursery rhymes, which by endless\r\nrepetition night after night had become so habitual as to follow in an\r\nautomatic way upon the stimulus from the child. It is certainly\r\nastonishing that among the things which one may get to do\r\nautomatically, we should find singing; but writers on the subject have\r\nclaimed that the function of musical or semi-musical expression may be\r\nreflex.\r\n\r\nThe principle of subconscious suggestion, of which these simple facts\r\nare less important illustrations, has very interesting applications in\r\nthe higher reaches of social, moral, and educational theory.\r\n\r\n_Inhibitory Suggestion._--An interesting class of phenomena which\r\nfigure perhaps at all the levels of nervous action now described, may\r\nbe known as Inhibitory Suggestions. The phrase, in its broadest use,\r\nrefers to all cases in which the suggesting stimulus tends to\r\nsuppress, check, or inhibit movement. We find this in certain cases\r\njust as strongly marked as the positive movement--bringing kind of\r\nsuggestion. The facts may be put under certain heads which follow.\r\n\r\n_Pain Suggestion._--Of course, the fact that pain inhibits movement\r\noccurs at once to the reader. So far as this is general, and is a\r\nnative inherited thing, it is organic, and so falls under the head of\r\nPhysiological Suggestion of a negative sort. The child shows\r\ncontracting movements, crying movements, starting and jumping\r\nmovements, shortly after birth, and so plainly that we need not\r\nhesitate to say that these pain responses belong purely to his nervous\r\nsystem; and that, in general, they are inhibitory and contrary to\r\nthose other native reactions which indicate pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe influence of pain extends everywhere through mental development,\r\nhowever. Its general effect is to dampen down or suppress the function\r\nwhich brings the pain; and in this its action is just the contrary to\r\nthat of pleasure, which furthers the pleasurable function.\r\n\r\n_Control Suggestion._--This covers all cases which show any kind of\r\nrestraint set upon the movements of the body short of that which comes\r\nfrom voluntary intention. The infant brings the movements of his legs,\r\narms, head, etc., gradually into some sort of order and system. It is\r\naccomplished by a system of organic checks and counter-checks, by\r\nwhich associations are formed between muscular sensations on the one\r\nhand and certain other sensations, as of sight, touch, hearing, etc.,\r\non the other hand. The latter serve as suggestions to the performance\r\nof these movements, and these alone. The infant learns to balance his\r\nhead and trunk, to direct his hands, to grasp with thumb opposite the\r\nfour fingers--all largely by such control suggestions, aided, of\r\ncourse, by his native reflexes.\r\n\r\n_Contrary Suggestion._--By this is meant a tendency of a very striking\r\nkind observable in many children, no less than in many adults, to do\r\nthe contrary when any course is suggested. The very word "contrary" is\r\nused in popular talk to describe an individual who shows this type of\r\nconduct. Such a child or man is rebellious whenever rebellion is\r\npossible; he seems to kick constitutionally against the pricks.\r\n\r\nThe fact of "contrariness" in older children--especially boys--is so\r\nfamiliar to all who have observed school children with any care that I\r\nneed not cite further details. And men and women often become so\r\nenslaved to suggestions of the contrary that they seem only to wait\r\nfor indications of the wishes of others in order to oppose and thwart\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nContrary suggestions are to be explained as exaggerated instances of\r\ncontrol. It is easy to see that the checks and counter-checks already\r\nspoken of as constituting the method of control of muscular movement\r\nmay themselves become so habitual and intense as to dominate the\r\nreactions which they should only regulate. The associations between\r\nthe muscular series and the visual series, let us say, which controls\r\nit, comes to work backward, so that the drift of the organic processes\r\nis toward certain contrary reverse movements.\r\n\r\nIn the higher reaches of conduct and life we find interesting cases of\r\nvery refined contrary suggestion. In the man of ascetic temperament,\r\nthe duty of self-denial takes the form of a regular contrary\r\nsuggestion in opposition to every invitation to self-indulgence,\r\nhowever innocent. The over-scrupulous mind, like the over-precise, is\r\na prey to the eternal remonstrances from the contrary which intrude\r\ntheir advice into all his decisions. In matters of thought and belief\r\nalso cases are common of stubborn opposition to evidence, and\r\npersistence in opinion, which are in no way due to the cogency of the\r\ncontrary arguments or to real force of conviction.\r\n\r\n_Hypnotic Suggestion._--The facts upon which the current theories of\r\nhypnotism are based may be summed up under a few headings, and the\r\nrecital of them will serve to bring this class of phenomena into the\r\ngeneral lines of classification drawn out in this chapter.\r\n\r\n_The Facts._--When by any cause the attention is held fixed upon an\r\nobject, say a bright button, for a sufficient time without\r\ndistraction, the subject begins to lose consciousness in a peculiar\r\nway. Generalizing this simple experiment, we may say that any method\r\nor device which serves to secure undivided and prolonged attention to\r\nany sort of Suggestion--be it object, idea, anything that is clear and\r\nstriking--brings on what is called Hypnosis to a person normally\r\nconstituted.\r\n\r\nThe Paris school of interpreters find three stages of progress in the\r\nhypnotic sleep: First, Catalepsy, characterized by rigid fixity of the\r\nmuscles in any position in which the limbs may be put by the\r\nexperimenter, with great Suggestibility on the side of consciousness,\r\nand An\xc3\xa6sthesia (lack of sensation) in certain areas of the skin and in\r\ncertain of the special senses; second, Lethargy, in which\r\nconsciousness seems to disappear entirely; the subject not being\r\nsensitive to any stimulations by eye, ear, skin, etc., and the body\r\nbeing flabby and pliable as in natural sleep; third, Somnambulism, so\r\ncalled from its analogies to the ordinary sleep-walking condition to\r\nwhich many persons are subject. This last covers the phenomena of\r\nordinary mesmeric exhibitions at which travelling mesmerists "control"\r\npersons before audiences and make them obey their commands. While\r\nother scientists properly deny that these three stages are really\r\ndistinct, they may yet be taken as representing extreme instances of\r\nthe phenomena, and serve as points of departure for further\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nOn the mental side the general characteristics of hypnotic\r\nSomnambulism are as follows:\r\n\r\n1. _The impairment of memory_ in a peculiar way. In the hypnotic\r\ncondition all affairs of the ordinary life are forgotten; on the other\r\nhand, after waking the events of the hypnotic condition are forgotten.\r\nFurther, in any subsequent period of Hypnosis the events of the former\r\nsimilar periods are remembered. So a person who is frequently\r\nhypnotized has two continuous memories: one for the events of his\r\nnormal life, exercised only when he is normal; and one for the events\r\nof his hypnotic periods, exercised only when he is hypnotized.\r\n\r\n2. _Suggestibility_ to a remarkable degree. By this is meant the\r\ntendency of the subject to have in reality any mental condition which\r\nis suggested to him. He is subject to Suggestions both on the side of\r\nhis sensations and ideas and also on the side of his actions. He will\r\nsee, hear, remember, believe, refuse to see, hear, etc., anything,\r\nwith some doubtful exceptions, which may be suggested to him by word\r\nor deed, or even by the slightest and perhaps unconscious indications\r\nof those about him. On the side of conduct his suggestibility is\r\nequally remarkable. Not only will he act in harmony with the illusions\r\nof sight, etc., into which he is led, but he will carry out, like an\r\nautomaton, the actions suggested to him. Further, pain and pleasure,\r\nwith their organic accompaniments may be produced by Suggestion. The\r\nskin may be actually scarred with a lead pencil if the patient be told\r\nthat it is red-hot iron. The suggested pain brings about vasomotor and\r\nother bodily changes that prove, as similar tests in the other cases\r\nprove, that simulation is impossible and the phenomena are real. These\r\ntruths and those given below are no longer based on the mere reports\r\nof the "mesmerists," but are the recognised property of legitimate\r\npsychology.\r\n\r\nAgain, such suggestions may be for a future time, and be performed\r\nonly when a suggested interval has elapsed; they are then called\r\nDeferred or Post-hypnotic Suggestions. Post-hypnotic Suggestions are\r\nthose which include the command not to perform them until a certain\r\ntime after the subject has returned to his normal condition; such\r\nsuggestions--if of reasonably trifling character--are actually carried\r\nout afterward in the normal state, although the person is conscious of\r\nno reason why he should act in such a way, having no remembrance\r\nwhatever that he has received the suggestion when hypnotized. Such\r\npost-hypnotic performances may be deferred by suggestion for many\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\n3. So-called _Exaltation_ of the mental faculties, especially of the\r\nsenses: increased acuteness of vision, hearing, touch, memory, and the\r\nmental functions generally. By reason of this great "exaltation,"\r\nhypnotized patients may get suggestions from the experimenters which\r\nare not intended, and discover their intentions when every effort is\r\nmade to conceal them. Often emotional changes in expression are\r\ndiscerned by them; and if it be admitted that their power of logical\r\nand imaginative insight is correspondingly exalted, there is hardly a\r\nlimit to the patient\'s ability to read, simply from physical\r\nindications, the mental states of those who experiment with him.\r\n\r\n4. So-called _Rapport_. This term covers all the facts known, before\r\nthe subject was scientifically investigated, by such expressions as\r\n"personal magnetism," "will power over the subject", etc. It is true\r\nthat one particular operator alone may be able to hypnotize a\r\nparticular patient; and in this case the patient is, when hypnotized,\r\nopen to suggestions from that person only. He is deaf and blind to\r\neverything enjoined by anyone else. It is easy to see from what has\r\nalready been said that this does not involve any occult nerve\r\ninfluence or mental power. A sensitive patient anybody can hypnotize,\r\nprovided only that the patient have the idea or conviction that the\r\nexperimenter possesses such power. Now, let a patient get the idea\r\nthat only one man can hypnotize him, and that is the beginning of the\r\nhypnotic suggestion itself. It is a part of the suggestion that a\r\ncertain personal _Rapport_ is necessary; so the patient must have this\r\n_Rapport_. This is shown by the fact that when such a patient is\r\nhypnotized, the operator _en rapport_ with him can transfer the\r\nso-called control to any one else simply by suggesting to the patient\r\nthat this third party can also hypnotize him. _Rapport_, therefore,\r\nand all the amazing claims of charlatans to powers of charming,\r\nstealing another\'s personality, controlling his will at a\r\ndistance--all such claims are explained, so far as they have anything\r\nto rest upon, by suggestion under conditions of mental hyper\xc3\xa6sthesia\r\nor exaltation.\r\n\r\nI may now add certain practical remarks on the subject.\r\n\r\nIn general, any method which fixes the attention upon a single stimulus\r\nlong enough is probably sufficient to produce Hypnosis; but the result is\r\nquick and profound in proportion as the patient has the idea that it is\r\ngoing to succeed, i. e., gets the suggestion of sleep. It may be said,\r\ntherefore, that the elaborate performances, such as passes, rubbings,\r\nmysterious incantations, etc., often resorted to, have no physiological\r\neffect whatever, and only serve to work in the way of suggestion upon the\r\nmind of the subject. In view of this it is probable that any person in\r\nnormal health can be hypnotized, provided he is not too sceptical of the\r\noperator\'s knowledge and power; and, on the contrary, any one can\r\nhypnotize another, provided he do not arouse too great scepticism, and is\r\nnot himself wavering and clumsy. It is probable, however, that\r\nsusceptibility varies greatly in degree, and that race exerts an important\r\ninfluence. Thus in Europe the French seem to be most susceptible, and the\r\nEnglish and Scandinavians least so. The impression that weak-minded\r\npersons are most available is quite mistaken. On the contrary, patients in\r\nthe insane asylums, idiots, etc., are the most refractory. This is to be\r\nexpected, from the fact that in these cases power of strong, steady\r\nattention is wanting. The only class of pathological cases which seem\r\npeculiarly open to the hypnotic influence is that of the\r\nhystero-epileptics, whose tendencies are toward extreme suggestibility.\r\nFurther, one may hypnotize himself--what we have called above\r\nAuto-suggestion--especially after having been put into the trance more\r\nthan once by others. When let alone after being hypnotized, the patient\r\nusually passes into a normal sleep and wakes naturally.\r\n\r\nIt is further evident that frequent hypnotization is very damaging if\r\ndone by the same operator, since then the patient contracts a habit of\r\nresponding to the same class of suggestions; and this may influence\r\nhis normal life. A further danger arises from the possibility that all\r\nsuggestions have not been removed from the patient\'s mind before his\r\nawaking. Competent scientific observers always make it a point to do\r\nthis. It is possible also that damaging effects result directly to a\r\nman from frequent hypnotizing; and this is in some degree probable,\r\nsimply from the fact that, while it lasts, the state is abnormal.\r\nConsequently, all general exhibitions in public, as well as all\r\nindividual hypnotizing by amateurs, should be prohibited by law, and\r\nthe whole practical application as well as observation of Hypnosis\r\nshould be left in the hands of physicians or experts who have proved\r\ntheir fitness by an examination and secured a certificate of licence.\r\nIn Russia a decree (summer, 1893) permits physicians to practise\r\nhypnotism for purposes of cure under official certificates. In France\r\npublic exhibitions are forbidden.\r\n\r\nSo-called Criminal Suggestions may be made, with more or less effect,\r\nin the hypnotic state. Cases have been tried in the French courts, in\r\nwhich evidence for and against such influence of a third person over\r\nthe criminal has been admitted. The reality of the phenomenon,\r\nhowever, is in dispute. The Paris school claim that criminal acts may\r\nbe suggested to the hypnotized subject, which are just as certain to\r\nbe performed by him as any other acts. Such a subject will discharge a\r\nblank-loaded pistol at one, when told to do so, or stab him with a\r\npaper dagger. While admitting the facts, the Nancy theorists claim\r\nthat the subject knows the performance to be a farce; gets suggestions\r\nof the unreality of it from the experimenters, and so acquiesces. This\r\nis probably true, as is seen in frequent cases in which patients have\r\nrefused, in hypnotic sleep, to perform suggested acts which shocked\r\ntheir modesty, veracity, etc. This goes to show that the Nancy school\r\nare right in saying that while in Hypnosis suggestibility is\r\nexaggerated to an enormous degree, still it has limits in the more\r\nwell-knit habits, moral sentiments, social opinions, etc., of the\r\nsubject. And it further shows that Hypnosis is probably, as they\r\nclaim, a temporary disturbance, rather than a pathological condition\r\nof mind or body.\r\n\r\nThere have been many remarkable and sensational cases of cure of\r\ndisease by hypnotic suggestion, reported especially in France. That\r\nhysteria in many of its manifestations has been relieved is certainly\r\ntrue; but that any organic, structural disease has ever been cured by\r\nhypnotism is unproved. It is not regarded by medical authorities as an\r\nagent of much therapeutic value, and is rarely employed; but it is\r\ndoubtful, in view of the natural prejudice caused by the pretensions\r\nof charlatans, whether its merits have been fairly tested. On the\r\nEuropean Continent it has been successfully applied in a great variety\r\nof cases; and Bernheim has shown that minor nervous troubles,\r\ninsomnia, migraines, drunkenness, lighter cases of rheumatism, sexual\r\nand digestive disorders, together with a host of smaller temporary\r\ncauses of pain--corns, cricks in back and side, etc.--may be cured or\r\nvery materially alleviated by suggestions conveyed in the hypnotic\r\nstate. In many cases such cures are permanently effected with aid from\r\nno other remedies. In a number of great city hospitals patients of\r\nrecognised classes are at once hypnotized, and suggestions of cure\r\nmade. Li\xc3\xa9beault, the founder of the Nancy school, has the credit of\r\nhaving first made use of hypnosis as a remedial agent. It is also\r\nbecoming more and more recognised as a method of controlling\r\nrefractory and violent patients in asylums and reformatory\r\ninstitutions. It must be added, however, that psychological theory\r\nrather than medical practice is seriously concerning itself with this\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\n_Theory._--Two rival theories are held as to the general character of\r\nHypnosis. The Paris school already referred to, led by the late Dr.\r\nCharcot, hold that it is a pathological condition which is most\r\nreadily induced in patients already mentally diseased or having\r\nneuropathic tendencies. They claim that the three stages described\r\nabove are a discovery of great importance. The so-called Nancy school,\r\non the other hand, led by Bernheim, deny the pathological character of\r\nHypnosis altogether, claiming that the hypnotic condition is nothing\r\nmore than a special form of ordinary sleep brought on artificially by\r\nsuggestion. Hypnotic suggestion, say they, is only an exaggeration of\r\nan influence to which all persons are normally subject. All the\r\nvariations, stages, curious phenomena, etc., of the Paris school, they\r\nclaim, can be explained by this "suggestion" hypothesis. The Nancy\r\nschool must be considered completely victorious apart from some facts\r\nwhich no theory has yet explained.\r\n\r\nHypnotism shows an intimacy of interaction between mind and body to\r\nwhich current psychology is only beginning to do justice; and it is\r\nthis aspect of the whole matter which should be emphasized in this\r\nconnection. The hypnotic condition of consciousness may be taken to\r\nrepresent the working of Suggestion most remarkably.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nTHE TRAINING OF THE MIND--EDUCATIONAL PSYCHOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nA great deal has been said and written about the physical and mental\r\ndifferences shown by the young; and one of the most oft-repeated of\r\nall the charges which we hear brought against the current methods of\r\nteaching is that all children are treated alike. The point is carried\r\nso far that a teacher is judged from the way he has or has not of\r\ngetting at the children under him as individuals. All this is a move\r\nin the right direction; and yet the subject is still so vague that\r\nmany of the very critics who declaim against the similar treatment\r\nwhich diverse pupils get at school have no clear idea of what is\r\nneeded; they merely make demands that the treatment shall suit the\r\nchild. How each child is to be suited, and the inquiry still back of\r\nthat, what peculiarity it is in this child or that which is to be\r\n"suited"--these things are left to settle themselves.\r\n\r\nIt is my aim in this chapter to indicate some of the variations which\r\nare shown by different children; and on the basis of such facts to\r\nendeavour to arrive at a more definite idea of what variations of\r\ntreatment are called for in the several classes into which the\r\nchildren are divided. I shall confine myself at first to those\r\ndifferences which are more hereditary and constitutional.\r\n\r\n_First Period--Early Childhood._--The first and most comprehensive\r\ndistinction is that based on the division of the life of man into the\r\ntwo great spheres of reception and action. The "sensory" and the\r\n"motor" are becoming the most common descriptive terms of current\r\npsychology. We hear all the while of sensory processes, sensory\r\ncontents, sensory centres, sensory attention, etc.; and, on the other\r\nhand, of motor processes, motor centres, motor ataxy, motor attention,\r\nmotor consciousness, etc. And in the higher reaches of mental\r\nfunction, the same antithesis comes out in the contrast of sensory and\r\nmotor aphasia, alexia, sensory and motor types of memory and\r\nimagination, etc. Indeed the tendency is now strong to think that when\r\nwe have assigned a given function of consciousness to one or other\r\nside of the nervous apparatus, making it either sensory or motor, then\r\nour duty to it is done. Be that as it may, there is no doubt that the\r\ndistinction is throwing great light on the questions of mind which\r\ninvolve also the correlative questions of the nervous system. This is\r\ntrue of all questions of educational psychology.\r\n\r\nThis first distinction between children--as having general\r\napplication--is that which I may cover by saying that some are more\r\nactive, or motile, while others are more passive, or receptive. This\r\nis a common enough distinction; but possibly a word or two on its\r\nmeaning in the constitution of the child may give it more actual\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nThe "active" person to the psychologist is one who is very responsive\r\nto what we have called Suggestions. Suggestions may be described in\r\nmost general terms as any and all the influences from outside, from\r\nthe environment, both physical and personal, which get a lodgment in\r\nconsciousness and lead to action. A child who is "suggestible" to a\r\nhigh degree shows it in what we call "motility." The suggestions which\r\ntake hold of him translate themselves very directly into action. He\r\ntends to act promptly, quickly, unreflectively, assimilating the newer\r\nelements of the suggestions of the environment to the ways of\r\nbehaviour fixed by his earlier habits. Generally such a person, child\r\nor adult, is said to "jump" at conclusions; he is anxious to know in\r\norder to act; he acts in some way on all events or suggestions, even\r\nwhen no course of action is explicitly suggested, and even when one\r\nattempts to keep him from acting.\r\n\r\nPsychologically such a person is dominated by habit. And this means\r\nthat his nervous system sets, either by its hereditary tendencies or\r\nby the undue predominance of certain elements in his education,\r\nquickly in the direction of motor discharge. The great channels of\r\nreadiest out-pouring from the brain into the muscles have become fixed\r\nand pervious; it is hard for the processes once started in the sense\r\ncentres, such as those of sight, hearing, etc., to hold in their\r\nenergies. They tend to unstable equilibrium in the direction of\r\ncertain motor combinations, which in their turn represent certain\r\nclasses of acts. This is habit; and the person of the extreme motor\r\ntype is always a creature of habit.\r\n\r\nNow what is the line of treatment that such a child should have? The\r\nnecessity for getting an answer to this question is evident from what\r\nwas said above--i. e., that the very rise of the condition itself is\r\ndue, apart from heredity, oftener than not to the fact that he has not\r\nhad proper treatment from his teachers.\r\n\r\nThe main point for a teacher to have in mind in dealing with such a\r\nboy or girl--the impulsive, active one, always responsive, but almost\r\nalways in error in what he says and does--is that here is a case of\r\nhabit. Habit is good; indeed, if we should go a little further we\r\nshould see that all education is the forming of habits; but here, in\r\nthis case, what we have is not habits, but habit. This child shows a\r\ntendency to habit _as such_: to habits of any and every kind. The\r\nfirst care of the teacher in order to the control of the formation of\r\nhabits is in some way to bring about a little inertia of habit, so to\r\nspeak--a short period of organic hesitation, during which the reasons\r\npro and con for each habit may be brought into the consciousness of\r\nthe child.\r\n\r\nThe means by which this tendency to crude, inconsiderate action on the\r\npart of the child is to be controlled and regulated is one of the most\r\ntypical questions for the intelligent teacher. Its answer must be\r\ndifferent for children of different ages. The one thing to do, in\r\ngeneral, however, from the psychologist\'s point of view, is in some\r\nway to bring about greater complications in the motor processes which\r\nthe child uses most habitually, and with this complication to get\r\ngreater inhibition along the undesirable lines of his activity.\r\nInhibition is the damming up of the processes for a period, causing\r\nsome kind of a "setback" of the energies of movement into the sensory\r\ncentres, or the redistribution of this energy in more varied and less\r\nhabitual discharges. With older children a rational method is to\r\nanalyze for them the mistakes they have made, showing the penalties\r\nthey have brought upon themselves by hasty action. This requires great\r\nwatchfulness. In class work, the teacher may profitably point out the\r\nbetter results reached by the pupil who "stops to think." This will\r\nbring to the reform of the hasty scholar the added motive of\r\nsemi-public comparison with the more deliberate members of the class.\r\nSuch procedure is quite unobjectionable if made a recognised part of\r\nthe class method; yet care should be taken that no scholar suffer\r\nmortification from such comparisons. The matter may be "evened up" by\r\ndwelling also on the merit of promptness which the scholar in question\r\nwill almost always be found to show.\r\n\r\nFor younger pupils as well as older more indirect methods of treatment\r\nare more effective. The teacher should study the scholar to find the\r\ngeneral trend of his habits. Then oversight should be exercised over\r\nboth his tasks and his sports with certain objects in view. His\r\nhabitual actions should be made as complicated as his ability can cope\r\nwith; this in order to educate his habits and keep them from working\r\nback into mere mechanism. If he shows his fondness for drawing by\r\nmarking his desk, see that he has drawing materials at hand and some\r\nintelligent tasks in this line to do; not as tasks, but for himself.\r\nEncourage him to make progress always, not simply to repeat himself.\r\nIf he has awkward habits of movement with his hands and feet, try to\r\nget him interested in games that exercise these members in regular and\r\nskilful ways.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, in his intellectual tasks such a pupil should be trained,\r\nas far as may be, on the more abstract subjects, which do not give\r\nimmediate openings for action. Mathematics is the best possible\r\ndiscipline for him. Grammar also is good; it serves at once to\r\ninterest him, if it is well taught, in certain abstract relationships,\r\nand also to send out his motor energies in the exercise of speech,\r\nwhich is the function which always needs exercise, and which is always\r\nunder the observation of the teacher. Grammar, in fact, is one of the\r\nvery best of primary-school subjects, because instruction in it issues\r\nat once in the very motor functions which embody the relationships\r\nwhich the teacher seeks to impress. The teacher has in his ear, so to\r\nspeak, the evidence as to whether his instruction is understood or\r\nnot. This gives him a valuable opportunity to keep his instruction\r\nwell ahead of its motor expression--thus leading the pupil to think\r\nrather than to act without thinking--and at the same time to point out\r\nthe errors of performance which follow from haste in passing from\r\nthought to action.\r\n\r\nThese indirect methods of reaching the impulsive pupil should never be\r\ncast aside for the direct effort to "control" such a scholar. The very\r\nworst thing that can be done to such a boy or girl is to command him\r\nor her to sit still or not to act; and a still worse thing--to make a\r\ncomparative again on the head of the superlative--is to affix to the\r\ncommand painful penalties. This is a direct violation of the principle\r\nof Suggestion. Such a command only tends to empty the pupil\'s mind of\r\nother objects of thought and interest, and so to keep his attention\r\nupon his own movements. This, then, amounts to a continual suggestion\r\nto him to do just what you want to keep him from doing. On the\r\ncontrary, unless you give him suggestions and interests which lead his\r\nthought away from his acts, it is impossible not to aggravate his bad\r\ntendencies by your very efforts. This is the way, as I intimated\r\nabove, that many teachers create or confirm bad habits in their\r\npupils, and so render any amount of well-intended positive instruction\r\nabortive. It seems well established that a suggestion of the\r\nnegative--that is, not to do a thing--has no negative force; but, on\r\nthe contrary, in the early period, it amounts only to a stronger\r\nsuggestion in the positive sense, since it adds emphasis, to the thing\r\nwhich is forbidden. The "not" in a prohibition is no addition to the\r\npictured course to which it is attached, and the physiological fact\r\nthat the attention tends to set up action upon that which is attended\r\nto comes in to put a premium on disobedience. Indeed, the philosophy\r\nof all punishment rests in this consideration, i. e., that unless the\r\npenalty tends to fill the mind with some object other than the act\r\npunished, it does more harm than good. The punishment must be actual\r\nand its nature diverting; never a threat which terminates there, nor a\r\npenalty which fixes the thought of the offence more strongly in mind.\r\nThis is to say, that the permanent inhibition of a movement at this\r\nperiod is best secured by establishing some different movement.\r\n\r\nThe further consideration of the cases of great motility would lead to\r\nthe examination of the kinds of memory and imagination and their\r\ntreatment; to that we return below. We may now take up the instances\r\nof the sensory type considered with equal generality.\r\n\r\nThe sensory children are in the main those which seem more passive,\r\nmore troubled with physical inertia, more contemplative when a little\r\nolder, less apt in learning to act out new movements, less quick at\r\ntaking a hint, etc.\r\n\r\nThese children are generally further distinguished as being--and here\r\nthe antithesis to the motor ones is very marked--much less\r\nsuggestible. They seem duller when young. Boys often get credit for\r\ndulness compared with girls on this account. Even as early as the\r\nsecond year can this distinction among children be readily observed in\r\nmany instances. The motor child will show sorrow by loud crying and\r\nvigorous action, while the sensory child will grieve in quiet, and\r\ncontinue to grieve when the other has forgotten the disagreeable\r\noccurrence altogether. The motor one it is that asks a great many\r\nquestions and seems to learn little from the answers; while the\r\nsensory one learns simply from hearing the questions of the other and\r\nthe answers given to them. The motor child, again, gets himself hurt a\r\ngreat many times in the same way, without developing enough\r\nself-control to restrain himself from the same mistake again and\r\nagain; the sensory child tends to be timid in the presence of the\r\nunknown and uncertain, to learn from one or a few experiences, and to\r\nhold back until he gets satisfactory assurances that danger is absent.\r\nThe former tends to be more restless in sitting, standing, etc., more\r\ndemonstrative in affection, more impulsive in action, more forgiving\r\nin disposition.\r\n\r\nAs to the treatment of the sensory child, it is a problem of even\r\ngreater difficulty and danger than that of his motor brother. The very\r\nnature of the distinction makes it evident that while the motor\r\nindividual "gives himself away," so to speak, by constantly acting out\r\nhis impressions, and so revealing his progress and his errors, with\r\nthe other it is not so. All knowledge that we are ever able to get of\r\nthe mental condition of another individual is through his movements,\r\nexpressive, in a technical sense, or of other kinds, such as his\r\nactions, attitudes, lines of conduct, etc. We have no way to read\r\nthought directly. So just in so far as the sensory individual is less\r\nactive, to that degree he is less expressive, less self-revealing. To\r\nthe teacher, therefore, he is more of an enigma. It is harder to tell\r\nin his case what instruction he has appreciated and made his own; and\r\nwhat, on the other hand, has been too hard for him; what wise, and\r\nwhat unwise. Where the child of movement speaks out his impulsive\r\ninterpretations, this one sinks into himself and gives no answer. So\r\nwe are deprived of the best way of interpreting him--that afforded by\r\nhis own interpretation of himself.\r\n\r\nA general policy of caution is therefore strongly to be recommended.\r\nLet the teacher wait in every case for some positive indication of the\r\nchild\'s real state of mind. Even the directions given the child may\r\nnot have been understood, or the quick word of admonition may have\r\nwounded him, or a duty which is so elementary as to be a commonplace\r\nin the mental life of the motor child may yet be so vaguely\r\napprehended that to insist upon its direct performance may cost the\r\nteacher all his influence with the pupil of this type. It is better to\r\nwait even at the apparent risk of losing valuable days than to proceed\r\na single step upon a mistaken estimate of the child\'s measure of\r\nassimilation. And, further, the effect of wrong treatment upon this\r\nboy or girl is very different from that of a similar mistake in the\r\nother case. He becomes more silent, retired, even secretive, when once\r\nan unsympathetic relationship is suggested between him and his elder.\r\n\r\nThen more positively--his instruction should be well differentiated.\r\nHe should in every possible case be given inducements to express\r\nhimself. Let him recite a great deal. Give him simple verses to\r\nrepeat. Keep him talking all you can. Show him his mistakes with the\r\nutmost deliberation and kindliness of manner; and induce him to repeat\r\nhis performances in your hearing after the correction has been\r\nsuggested. Cultivate the imitative tendency in him; it is the handmaid\r\nto the formation of facile habits of action. In arranging the\r\nchildren\'s games, see that he gets the very active parts, even though\r\nhe be backward and hesitating about assuming them. Make him as far as\r\npossible a leader, in order to cultivate his sense of responsibility\r\nfor the doing of things, and to lead to the expression of his\r\nunderstanding of arrangements, etc. In it all, the essential thing is\r\nto bring him out in some kind of expression; both for the sake of the\r\nimproved balance it gives himself, and as an indication to the\r\nobservant teacher of his progress and of the next step to be taken in\r\nhis development.\r\n\r\nIt is for the sensory child, I think, that the kindergarten has its\r\ngreat utility. It gives him facility in movement and expression, and\r\nalso some degree of personal and social confidence. But for the same\r\nreasons the kindergarten over-stimulates the motor scholars at the\r\ncorresponding age. There should really be two kindergarten\r\nmethods--one based on the idea of deliberation, the other on that of\r\nexpression.\r\n\r\nThe task of the educator here, it is evident, is to help nature\r\ncorrect a tendency to one-sided development; just as the task is this\r\nalso in the former case; but here the variation is on the side of\r\nidiosyncrasy ultimately, and of genius immediately. For genius, I\r\nthink, is the more often developed from the contemplative mind, with\r\nthe relatively dammed-up brain, of this child, than from the\r\nsmooth-working machine of the motor one. But just for this reason, if\r\nthe damming-up be liberated, not in the channels of healthy\r\nassimilation, and duly correlated growth, but in the forced discharges\r\nof violent emotion, followed by conditions of melancholy and by\r\ncertain unsocial tendencies, then the promise of genius ripens into\r\neccentricity, and the blame is possibly ours.\r\n\r\nIt seems true--although great caution is necessary in drawing\r\ninferences--that here a certain distinction may be found to hold also\r\nbetween the sexes. It is possible that the apparent precocious\r\nalertness of girls in their school years, and earlier, may be simply a\r\npredominance among them of the motor individuals. This is borne out by\r\nthe examination of the kinds of performance in which they seem to be\r\nmore forward than boys. It resolves itself, so far as my observation\r\ngoes, into greater quickness of response and greater agility in\r\nperformance; not greater constructiveness, nor greater power of\r\nconcentrated attention. The boys seem to need more instruction because\r\nthey do not learn as much for themselves by acting upon what they\r\nalready know. In later years, the distinction gets levelled off by the\r\ncommon agencies of education, and by the setting of tasks requiring\r\nmore thought than the mere spontaneities of either type avail to\r\nfurnish. Yet all the way through, I think there is something in the\r\nordinary belief that woman is relatively more impulsive and more prone\r\nto the less reflective forms of action.\r\n\r\nWhat has now been said may be sufficient to give some concrete force\r\nto the common opinion that education should take account of the\r\nindividual character at this earliest stage. The general distinction\r\nbetween sensory and motor has, however, a higher application in the\r\nmatter of memory and imagination at later stages of growth, to which\r\nwe may now turn.\r\n\r\n_Second Period._--The research is of course more difficult as the\r\npupil grows older, since the influences of heredity tend to become\r\nblurred by the more constant elements of the child\'s home, school, and\r\ngeneral social environment. The child whom I described just above as\r\nsensory in his type is constantly open to influences from the\r\nstimulating behaviour of his motor companion, as well as from the\r\ndirect measures which parent and teacher take to overcome his\r\ntoo-decided tendencies and to prevent one-sided development. So, too,\r\nthe motor child tends to find correctives in his environment.\r\n\r\nThe analogy, however, between the more organic and hereditary\r\ndifferences in individuals, and the intellectual and moral variations\r\nwhich they tend to develop with advance in school age, is very\r\nmarked; and we find a similar series of distinctions in the later\r\nperiod. The reason that there is a correspondence between the\r\nvariations given in heredity and those due in the main to the\r\neducative influences of the single child\'s social environment is in\r\nitself very suggestive, but space does not permit its exposition here.\r\n\r\nThe fact is this: the child tends, under the influence of his home,\r\nschool, social surroundings, etc., to develop a marked character\r\neither in the sensory or in the motor direction, in his memory,\r\nimagination, and general type of mind.\r\n\r\nTaking up the "motor" child first, as before, we find that his\r\npsychological growth tends to confirm him in his hereditary type. In\r\nall his social dealing with other children he is more or less\r\ndomineering and self-assertive; or at least his conduct leads one to\r\nform that opinion of him. He seems to be constantly impelled to act so\r\nas to show himself off. He "performs" before people, shows less\r\nmodesty than may be thought desirable in one of his tender years,\r\nimpresses the forms of his own activity upon the other children, who\r\ncome to stand about him with minds constrained to follow him. He is an\r\nobject lesson in both the advantages and the risks of an aggressive\r\nlife policy. He has a suggestion to make in every emergency, a line of\r\nconduct for each of his company, all marked out or supplied on the\r\nspur of the moment by his own quick sense of appropriate action; and\r\nfor him, as for no one else, to hesitate is to be lost.\r\n\r\nNow what this general policy or method of growth means to his\r\nconsciousness is becoming more and more clear in the light of the\r\ntheory of mental types. The reason a person is motor is that his mind\r\ntends always to be filled up most easily with memories or revived\r\nimages of the twitchings, tensions, contractions, expansions, of the\r\nactivities of the muscular system. He is a motor because the means of\r\nhis thought generally, the mental coins which pass current in his\r\nthought exchange, are muscular sensations or the traces which such\r\nsensations have left in his memory. The very means by which he thinks\r\nof a situation, an event, a duty, is not the way it looked, or the way\r\nit sounded, or the way it smelt, tasted, or felt to the touch--in any\r\nof the experiences to which these senses are involved--but the means,\r\nthe representatives, the instruments of his thought, are the feelings\r\nof the way he has acted. He has a tendency--and he comes to have it\r\nmore and more--to get a muscular representation of everything; and his\r\ngauge of the value of this or that is this muscular measure of it, in\r\nterms of the action which it is calculated to draw out.\r\n\r\nIt is then this preference for one particular kind of mental imagery,\r\nand that the motor, or muscular kind, which gives this type of child\r\nhis peculiarity in this more psychological period. When we pass from\r\nthe mere outward and organic description of his peculiarities,\r\nattempted above in the case of very young children, and aim to\r\nascertain the mental peculiarity which accompanies it and carries on\r\nthe type through the individual\'s maturer years, we see our way to its\r\nmeaning. The fact is that a peculiar kind of mental imagery tends to\r\nswell up in consciousness and monopolize the theatre of thought. This\r\nis only another way of saying that the attention is more or less\r\neducated in the direction represented by this sort of imagery. Every\r\ntime a movement is thought of, in preference to a sound or a sight\r\nwhich is also available, the habit of giving the attention to the\r\nmuscular equivalents of things becomes more firmly fixed. This\r\ncontinues until the motor habit of attention becomes the only easy and\r\nnormal way of attending; and then the person is fixed in his type for\r\none, many, or all of his activities of thinking and action.\r\n\r\nSo now it is no longer difficult to see, I trust, why it is that the\r\nchild or youth of this sort has the characteristics which he has. It\r\nis a familiar principle that attention to the thought of a movement\r\ntends to start that very movement. I defy any of my readers to think\r\nhard and long of winking the left eye and not have an almost\r\nirresistible impulse to wink that eye. There is no better way to make\r\nit difficult for a child to sit still than to tell him to sit still;\r\nfor your words fill up his attention, as I had occasion to say above,\r\nwith the thought of movements, and these thoughts bring on the\r\nmovements, despite the best intentions of the child in the way of\r\nobedience. Watch an audience of little children--and children of an\r\nolder growth will also do--when an excited speaker harangues them with\r\nmany gestures, and see the comical reproduction of the gestures by the\r\nchildren\'s hands. They picture the movements, the attention is fixed\r\non them, and appropriate actions follow.\r\n\r\nIt is only the generalizing of these phenomena that we find realized\r\nin the boy or girl of the motor type. Such a child is constantly\r\nthinking of things by their movement equivalents. Muscular sensations\r\nthrong up in consciousness at every possible signal and by every train\r\nof association; so it is not at all surprising that all informations,\r\ninstructions, warnings, reproofs, suggestions, pass right through such\r\na child\'s consciousness and express themselves by the channels of\r\nmovement. Hence the impulsive, restless, domineering, unmeditative\r\ncharacter of the child. We may now endeavour to describe a little more\r\nclosely his higher mental traits.\r\n\r\n1. In the first place the motor mind tends to _very quick\r\ngeneralization_. Every teacher knows the boys in school who anticipate\r\ntheir conclusions, on the basis of a single illustration. They reach\r\nthe general notion which is most broad in extent, in application, but\r\nmost shallow in intent, in richness, in real explaining or descriptive\r\nmeaning. For example, such a boy will hear the story of Napoleon,\r\nproceed to define heroism in terms of military success, and then go\r\nout and try the Napoleon act upon his playfellows. This tendency to\r\ngeneralize is the mental counterpart of the tendency to act seen in\r\nhis conduct. The reason he generalizes is that the brain energies are\r\nnot held back in the channels of perception, but pour themselves right\r\nout toward the motor equivalents of former perceptions which were in\r\nany way similar; then the present perceptions are lost in the old ones\r\ntoward which attention is held by habit, and action follows. To the\r\nchild all heroes are Napoleons because Napoleon was the first hero,\r\nand the channels of action inspired by him suffice now for the\r\nappropriate conduct.\r\n\r\n2. Such a scholar is very _poor at noting and remembering\r\ndistinctions_. This follows naturally from the hasty generalizations\r\nwhich he makes. Having once identified a new fact as the same as an\r\nold one, and having so reached a defective sense of the general\r\nclass, it is then more and more hard for him to retrace his steps and\r\nsort out the experiences more carefully. Even when he discovers his\r\nmistake, his old impulse to act seizes him again, and he rushes to\r\nsome new generalization wherewith to replace the old, again falling\r\ninto error by his stumbling haste to act. The teacher is oftener\r\nperhaps brought to the verge of impatience by scholars of this class\r\nthan by any others.\r\n\r\n3. Following, again, from these characteristics, there is a third\r\nremark to be made about the youth of this type; and it bears upon a\r\npeculiarity which it is very hard for the teacher to estimate and\r\ncontrol. These motor boys and girls have what I may characterize as\r\n_fluidity of the attention_. By this is meant a peculiar quality of\r\nmind which all experienced teachers are in some degree familiar with,\r\nand which they find baffling and unmanageable.\r\n\r\nBy "fluidity" of the attention I mean the state of hurry, rush,\r\ninadequate inspection, quick transition, all-too-ready-assimilation,\r\nhear-but-not-heed, in-one-ear-and-out-the-other habit of mind. The\r\nbest way to get an adequate sense of the state is to recall the pupil\r\nwho has it to the most marked degree, and picture his mode of dealing\r\nwith your instructions. Such a pupil hears your words, says "yes,"\r\neven acts appropriately so far as your immediate instructions go; but\r\nwhen he comes to the same situation again, he is as virginly innocent\r\nof your lesson as if his teacher had never been born. Psychologically,\r\nthe state differs from preoccupation, which characterizes quite a\r\ndifferent type of mind. The motor boy is not preoccupied. Far from\r\nthat, he is quite ready to attend to you. But when he attends, it is\r\nwith a momentary concentration--with a rush like the flow of a\r\nmountain stream past the point of the bank on which you sit. His\r\nattention is flowing, always in transition, leaping from "it to that,"\r\nwith superb agility and restlessness. But the exercise it gains from\r\nits movements is its only reward. Its acquisitions are slender in the\r\nextreme. It illustrates, on the mental plane, the truth of the\r\n"rolling stone." It corresponds, as a mental character, to the\r\nmuscular restlessness which the same type of child shows in the\r\nearlier period previously spoken of.\r\n\r\nThe psychological explanation of this "fluid attention" is more or\r\nless plain, but I can not take space to expound it. Suffice it to say\r\nthat the attention is itself, probably, in its brain seat, a matter of\r\nthe motor centres; its physical seat both "gives and takes" in\r\nco-operation with the processes which shed energy out into the\r\nmuscles. So it follows that, in the ready muscular revivals,\r\ndischarges, transitions, which we have seen to be prominent in the\r\nmotor temperament the attention is carried along, and its "fluidity"\r\nis only an incident to the fluidity of the motor symbols of which this\r\nsort of a mind continually makes use.\r\n\r\nComing a little closer to the pedagogical problems which this type of\r\npupil raises before us, we find, in the first place, that it is\r\nexcessively difficult for this scholar to give continuous or adequate\r\nattention to anything of any complexity. The movements of attention\r\nare so easy, the outlets of energy, to use the physical figure, so\r\nlarge and well used, that the minor relationships of the thing are\r\npassed over. The variations of the object from its class are swept\r\naway in the onrush of his motor tendencies. He assumes the facts which\r\nhe does not understand, and goes right on to express himself in\r\naction on these assumptions. So while he seems to take in what is told\r\nhim, with an intuition that is surprisingly swift, and a personal\r\nadaptation no less surprising, the disappointment is only the more\r\nkeen when the instructor finds the next day that he has not penetrated\r\nat all into the inner current of this scholar\'s mental processes.\r\n\r\nAgain, as marked as this is in its early stages, the continuance of it\r\nleads to results which are nothing short of deplorable. When such a\r\nstudent has gone through a preparatory school without overcoming this\r\ntendency to "fluid attention" and comes to college, the instructors in\r\nthe higher institutions are practically helpless before him. We say of\r\nhim that "he has never learned to study," that he does not know "how\r\nto apply himself," that he has no "power of assimilation." All of\r\nwhich simply means that his channels of reaction are so formed already\r\nthat no instruction can get sufficient lodgment in him to bring about\r\nany modification of his "apperceptive systems." The embarrassment is\r\nthe more marked because such a youth, all through his education\r\nperiod, is willing, ready, evidently receptive, prompt, and punctual\r\nin all his tasks.\r\n\r\nNow what shall be done with such a student in his early school years?\r\nThis is a question for the secondary teacher especially, apart from\r\nthe more primary measures recommended above. It is in the years\r\nbetween eight and fifteen that this type of mind has its rapid\r\ndevelopment; before that the treatment is mainly preventive, and\r\nconsists largely in suggestions which aim to make the muscular\r\ndischarges more deliberate and the general tone less explosive. But\r\nwhen the boy or girl comes to school with the dawning capacity for\r\nindependent self-direction and personal application, then it is that\r\nthe problem of the motor scholar becomes critical. The "let-alone"\r\nmethod puts a premium upon the development of his tendencies and the\r\neventual playing out of his mental possibilities in mere motion.\r\nCertain positive ways of giving some indirect discipline to the mind\r\nof this type may be suggested.\r\n\r\nGive this student relatively difficult and complex tasks. There is no\r\nway to hinder his exuberant self-discharges except by measures which\r\nembarrass and baffle him. We can not "lead him into all truth"; we\r\nhave to drive him back from all error. The lessons of psychology are\r\nto the effect that the normal way to teach caution and deliberation is\r\nthe way of failure, repulse, and unfortunate, even painful,\r\nconsequences. Personal appeals to him do little good, since it is a\r\npart of his complaint that he is too ready to hear all appeals; and\r\nalso, since he is not aware of his own lack nor able to carry what he\r\nhears into effect. So keep him in company of scholars a little more\r\nadvanced than he is. Keep him out of the concert recitations, where\r\nhis tendency to haste would work both personal and social harm.\r\nRefrain from giving him assistance in his tasks until he has learned\r\nfrom them something of the real lesson of discouragement, and then\r\nhelp him only by degrees, and by showing him one step at a time, with\r\nconstant renewals of his own efforts. Shield him with the greatest\r\npains from distractions of all kinds, for even the things and events\r\nabout him may carry his attention off at the most critical moments.\r\nGive him usually the secondary parts in the games of the school,\r\nexcept when real planning, complex execution, and more or less\r\ngeneralship are required; then give him the leading parts: they\r\nexercise his activities in new ways not covered by habit, and if he do\r\nnot rise to their complexity, then the other party to the sport will,\r\nand his haste will have its own punishment, and so be a lesson to him.\r\n\r\nBesides these general checks and regulations, there remains the very\r\nimportant question as to what studies are most available for this type\r\nof mind. I have intimated already the general answer that ought to be\r\ngiven to this question. The aim of the studies of the motor student\r\nshould be discipline in the direction of correct generalization, and,\r\nas helpful to this, discipline in careful observation of concrete\r\nfacts. On the other hand, the studies which involve principles simply\r\nof a descriptive kind should have little place in his daily study.\r\nThey call out largely the more mechanical operations of memory, and\r\ntheir command can be secured for the most part by mere repetition of\r\ndetails all similar in character and of equal value. The measure of\r\nthe utility to him of the different studies of the schoolroom is found\r\nin the relative demand they make upon him to modify his hasty personal\r\nreactions, to suspend his thoughtless rush to general results, and\r\nback of it all, to hold the attention long enough upon the facts as\r\nthey arise to get some sense of the logical relationships which bind\r\nthem together. Studies which do not afford any logical relationships,\r\nand which tend, on the contrary, to foster the habit of learning by\r\nrepetition, only tend to fix the student in the quality of attention\r\nwhich I have called "fluidity."\r\n\r\nIn particular, therefore: give this student all the mathematics he\r\ncan absorb, and pass him from arithmetic into geometry, leaving his\r\nalgebra till later. Give him plenty of grammar, taught inductively.\r\nStart him early in the elements of physics and chemistry. And as\r\nopposed to this, keep him out of the classes of descriptive botany and\r\nzo\xc3\xb6logy. Rather let him join exploring parties for the study of\r\nplants, stones, and animals. A few pet animals are a valuable adjunct\r\nto any school museum. If there be an industrial school or machine shop\r\nnear at hand, try to get him interested in the way things are made,\r\nand encourage him to join in such employments. A false generalization\r\nin the wheels of a cart supplies its own corrective very quickly, or\r\nin the rigging and sails of a toy boat. Drawing from models is a fine\r\nexercise for such a youth, and drawing from life, as soon as he gets a\r\nlittle advanced in the control of his pencil. All this, it is easy to\r\nsee, trains his impulsive movements into some degree of subjection to\r\nthe deliberative processes.\r\n\r\nWith this general line of treatment in mind, the details of which the\r\nreader will work out in the light of the boy\'s type, space allows me\r\nonly two more points before I pass to the sensory scholar.\r\n\r\nFirst, in all the teaching of the type of mind now in question, pursue\r\na method which proceeds from the particular to the general. The\r\ndiscussion of pedagogical method with all its ins and outs needs to\r\ntake cognizance of the differences of students in their type. The\r\nmotor student should never, in normal cases, be given a general\r\nformula and told to work out particular instances; that is too much\r\nhis tendency already--to approach facts from the point of view of\r\ntheir resemblances. What he needs rather is a sense of the dignity of\r\nthe single fact, and of the necessity of giving it its separate place,\r\nbefore hastening on to lose it in the flow of a general statement. So\r\nwhether the teacher have in hand mathematics, grammar, or science, let\r\nhim disclose the principles only gradually, and always only so far as\r\nthey are justified by the observations which the boy has been led to\r\nmake for himself. For the reason that such a method is practically\r\nimpossible in the descriptive sciences, and some other branches, as\r\ntaught in the schoolbooks--botany, zo\xc3\xb6logy, and, worse than all,\r\nhistory and geography--we should restrict their part in the discipline\r\nstudies of such a youth. They require simple memory, without\r\nobservation, and put a premium on hasty and temporary acquisition.\r\n\r\nAs I have said, algebra should be subordinated to geometry. Algebra\r\nhas as its distinctive method the principle of substitution, whereby\r\nsymbols of equal and, for the most part, absolute generality are\r\nsubstituted for one another, and the results stand for one fact as\r\nwell as for another, in disregard of the worth of the particular in\r\nthe scheme of nature. For the same reason, deductive logic is not a\r\ngood discipline for these students; empirical psychology, or political\r\neconomy, is a better introduction to the moral sciences for them when\r\nthey reach the high school. This explains what was meant above in the\r\nremark as to the method of teaching grammar. As to language study\r\ngenerally, I think the value of it, at this period, and later, is\r\nextraordinarily overrated. The proportion of time given to language\r\nstudy in our secondary schools is nothing short of a public crime in\r\nits effect upon students of this type--and indeed of any type. This,\r\nhowever, is a matter to which we return below. The average student\r\ncomes to college with his sense of exploration, his inductive\r\ncapacity, stifled at its birth. He stands appalled when confronted\r\nwith the unassimilated details of any science which does not give him\r\na "key" in the shape of general formulas made up beforehand. Were it\r\nnot that his enlarging experience of life is all the while running\r\ncounter to the trend of his so-called education, he would probably\r\ngraduate ready for the social position in which authority takes the\r\nplace of evidence, and imitation is the method of life.\r\n\r\nSecond, the teacher should be on the lookout for a tendency which is\r\nvery characteristic of a student of this type, the tendency, i. e., to\r\nfall into elaborate guessing at results. Take a little child of about\r\nseven or eight years of age, especially one who has the marks of motor\r\nheredity, and observe the method of his acquisition of new words in\r\nreading. First he speaks the word which his habit dictates, and, that\r\nbeing wrong, he rolls his eyes away from the text and makes a guess of\r\nthe first word that comes into his mind; this he keeps up as long as\r\nthe teacher persists in asking him to try again. Here is the same\r\ntendency that carries him later on in his education to a general\r\nconclusion by a short cut. He has not learned to interpret the data of\r\na deliberate judgment, and his attention does not dwell on the\r\nnecessary details. So with him all through his training; he is always\r\nready with a guess. Here, again, the teacher can do him good only by\r\npatiently employing the inductive method. Lead him back to the\r\nsimplest elements of the problem in hand, and help him gradually to\r\nbuild up a result step by step.\r\n\r\nI think in this, as in most of the work with these scholars, the\r\nassociation with children of the opposite type is one of the best\r\ncorrectives, provided the companionship is not made altogether\r\none-sided by the motor boy\'s perpetual monopolizing of all the avenues\r\nof personal expression. When he fails in the class, the kind of social\r\nlesson which is valuable may be taught him by submitting the same\r\nquestion to a pupil of the plodding, deliberate kind, and waiting for\r\nthe latter to work it out. Of course, if the teacher have any\r\nsupervision over the playground, similar treatment can be employed\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nComing to consider the so-called "sensory" youth of the age between\r\neight, let us say, and sixteen--the age during which the training of\r\nthe secondary school presents its great problems--we find certain\r\ninteresting contrasts between this type and that already characterized\r\nas "motor." The study of this type of youth is the more pressing for\r\nreasons which I have already hinted in considering the same type in\r\nthe earlier childhood period. It is necessary, first, to endeavour to\r\nget a fairly adequate view of the psychological characteristics of\r\nthis sort of pupil.\r\n\r\nThe current psychological doctrine of mental "types" rests upon a\r\ngreat mass of facts, drawn in the first instance from the different\r\nkinds of mental trouble, especially those which involve derangements\r\nof speech--the different kinds of Aphasia. The broadest generalization\r\nwhich is reached from these facts is that which marks the distinction,\r\nof which I have already said so much, between the motor and the\r\nsensory types. But besides this general distinction there are many\r\nfiner ones; and in considering the persons of the sensory type, it is\r\nnecessary to inquire into these finer distinctions. Not only do men\r\nand children differ in the matter of the sort of mental material which\r\nthey find requisite, as to whether it is pictures of movements on the\r\none hand, or pictures from the special senses on the other hand; but\r\nthey differ also in the latter case with respect to which of the\r\nspecial senses it is, in this case or that, which gives the particular\r\nindividual his necessary cue, and his most perfect function. So we\r\nfind inside of the general group called "sensory" several relatively\r\ndistinct cases, all of which the teacher is likely to come across in\r\nvarying numbers in a class of pupils. Of these the "visual" and the\r\n"auditory" are most important.\r\n\r\nThere are certain aspects of the case which are so common to all the\r\ncases of sensory minds, whether they be visual, auditory, or other,\r\nthat I may set them out before proceeding further.\r\n\r\nFirst, in all these matters of type distinction, one of the essential\r\nthings to observe is the behaviour of the Attention. We have already\r\nseen that the attention is implicated to a remarkable degree--in what\r\nI called "fluid attention" above--in the motor scholar. The same\r\nimplication of the attention occurs in all the sensory cases, but\r\npresents very different aspects; and the common fact that the\r\nattention is directly involved affords us one of the best rules of\r\njudgment and distinction. We may say, generally, of the sensory\r\nchildren, that the attention is best, most facile, most\r\ninterest-carrying for some one preferred sense, leading for this sense\r\ninto preoccupation and ready distraction. This tendency manifests\r\nitself, as we saw above, in the motor persons also, taking effect in\r\naction, speed, vivacity, hasty generalization, etc.; but in the\r\nsensory one it takes on varying forms. This first aspect of our\r\ntypical distinction of minds we may call "the relation of the\r\n\'favoured function\' to the attention."\r\n\r\nThen, second, there is another and somewhat contrasted relation which\r\nalso assumes importance when we come to consider individual cases; and\r\nthat is the relation of the "favoured function"--say movement, vision,\r\nhearing, etc.--to Habit. It is a common enough observation, that habit\r\nrenders functions easy, and that habits are hard to break; indeed, all\r\ntreatment of habits is likely to degenerate into the commonplace. But,\r\nwhen looked at as related to the attention, certain truths emerge from\r\nthe consideration of habit.\r\n\r\nIn general, we may say that habit bears a twofold relation to\r\nattention: on the one hand, _facile attention shows the reign of\r\nhabit_. The solid acquisitions are those with which attention is at\r\nhome, and which are therefore more or less habitual. But, on the other\r\nhand, it is equally true that _attention is in inverse ratio to\r\nhabit_. We need to attend least to these functions which are most\r\nhabitual, and we have to attend most to those which are novel and only\r\nhalf acquired. We get new acquisitions mainly, indeed, by strained\r\nattention. So we have a contrast of possible interpretations in all\r\ncases of sharp and exclusive attention by the children: _does the\r\nattention represent a Habit in this particular action of the\r\nchild_?--or, _does it represent the breaking up of a habit, an act of\r\nAccommodation_? In each case these questions have to be intelligently\r\nconsidered. The motor person, usually, when uninstructed and not held\r\nback, uses his attention under the lead of habit. It is largely the\r\nteacher\'s business in his case, as we saw, to get him to hold,\r\nconserve, and direct his attention steadily to the novel and the\r\ncomplex. The sensory person, on the other hand, shows the attention\r\nobstructed by details, hindered by novelties, unable to pass smoothly\r\nover its acquisitions, and in general lacking the regular influence of\r\nhabit in leading him to summarize and utilize his mental store in\r\ngeneral ways.\r\n\r\nThe third general aspect of the topic is this: the person of the\r\nsensory type is more likely to be the one in whom positive derangement\r\noccurs in the higher levels, and in response to the more refined\r\nsocial and personal influences. This, for the reason that this type\r\nrepresents brain processes of greater inertia and complexity, with\r\ngreater liability to obstruction. They are slower, and proceed over\r\nlarger brain areas.\r\n\r\nWith these general remarks, then, on the wider aspects of the\r\ndistinction of types, we may now turn to one of the particular cases\r\nwhich occurs among sensory individuals. This is all that our space\r\nwill allow.\r\n\r\n_The Visual Type._--The so-called "visuals," or "eye-minded" people\r\namong us, are numerically the largest class of the sensory population.\r\nThey resort to visual imagery whenever possible, either because that\r\nis the prevailing tendency with them, or because, in the particular\r\nfunction in question in any special act, the visual material comes\r\nmost readily to mind. The details of fact regarding the "visuals" are\r\nvery interesting; but I shall not take space to dwell upon them. The\r\nsphere in which the facts regarding the pupil of this type are\r\nimportant to the teacher is that of language, taken with the group of\r\nproblems which arise about instruction in language. The question of\r\nhis symbolism, and its relations to mathematics, logic, etc., is\r\nimportant. And finally, the sphere of the pupil\'s _expression_ in all\r\nits forms. Then, from all his discoveries in these things, the teacher\r\nis called upon to make his method of teaching and his general\r\ntreatment suitable to this student.\r\n\r\nThe visual pupil usually shows himself to be so predominately in his\r\nspeech and language functions; he learns best and fastest from copies\r\nwhich he sees. He delights in illustrations put in terms of vision, as\r\nwhen actually drawn out on the blackboard for him to see. He\r\nunderstands what he reads better than what he hears; and he uses his\r\nvisual symbols as a sort of common coin into which to convert the\r\nimages which come to him through his other senses. In regard to the\r\nmovements of attention, we may say that this boy or girl illustrates\r\nboth the aspects of the attention-function which I pointed out above;\r\nhe attends best--that is, most effectively--to visual instruction\r\nprovided he exert himself; but on the other hand, it is just here that\r\nthe drift of habit tends to make him superficial. As attention to the\r\nvisual is the most easy for him, and as the details of his visual\r\nstock are most familiar, so he tends to pass too quickly over the new\r\nmatters which are presented to him, assimilating the details to the\r\nold schemes of his habit. It is most important to observe this\r\ndistinction, since it is analogous to the "fluid attention" of the\r\nmotor scholar; and some of the very important questions regarding\r\ncorrelation of studies, the training of attention, and the stimulation\r\nof interest depend upon its recognition. _Acquisition best just where\r\nit is most likely to go wrong_; that is the state of things. The\r\nvoluntary use of the visual function gives the best results; but the\r\nhabitual, involuntary, slipshod use of it gives bad results, and tends\r\nto the formation of injurious habits.\r\n\r\nFor example, I set a strongly visual boy a "copy" to draw. Seeing this\r\nvisual copy he will quickly recognise it, take it to be very easy,\r\ndash it off quickly, all under the lead of habit; but his result is\r\npoor, because his habit has taken the place of effort. Once get him to\r\nmake effort upon it, however, and his will be the best result of all\r\nthe scholars, perhaps, just because the task calls him out in the line\r\nof his favoured function. The same antithesis comes out in connection\r\nwith other varieties of sensory scholars.\r\n\r\nWe may say, therefore, in regard to two of the general aspects of\r\nmental types--the relation of the favoured function to attention, on\r\nthe one hand, and to habit, on the other--that they both find emphatic\r\nillustration in the pupil of the visual type. He is, more than any\r\nother sensory pupil, a special case. His mental processes set\r\ndecidedly toward vision. He is the more important, also, because he is\r\nso common. Statistics are lacking, but possibly half of the entire\r\nhuman family in civilized life are visual in their type for most of\r\nthe language functions. This is due, no doubt, to the emphasis that\r\ncivilization puts upon sight as the means of social acquisition\r\ngenerally, and to our predominantly visual methods of instruction.\r\n\r\nThe third fact mentioned is also illustrated by this type; the fact\r\nthat mental instruction and derangement may come easily, through the\r\nstress laid upon vision in the person\'s mental economy. I need not\r\nenlarge upon the different forms of special defect which come through\r\nimpairment of sight by central lesion or degeneration of the visual\r\ncenters and connections. Suffice it to say that they are very common,\r\nand very difficult of recovery. The visual person is often so\r\ncompletely a slave to his sight that when that fails either in itself\r\nor through weakness of attention he becomes a wreck off the shore of\r\nthe ocean of intellect. When we consider the large proportion just\r\nmentioned of pupils of this type, the care which should be exercised\r\nby the school authorities in the matter of favourable conditions of\r\nlight, avoidance of visual fatigue, proper distance-adjustments in all\r\nvisual application as regards focus, symmetry, size of objects,\r\ncopies, prints, etc., becomes at once sufficiently evident to the\r\nthoughtful teacher, as it should be still earlier to the parent. There\r\nshould be a medical examination, by a competent oculist, before the\r\nchild goes to school, and regular tests afterward. School examiners\r\nand boards should have qualifications for reporting on the hygienic\r\nconditions of the school as regards lighting. The bright glare of a\r\nneighbouring wall before a window toward which children with weak eyes\r\nface when at their desks may result not only in common defects of\r\nvision but also in resulting mental and moral damage; and the results\r\nare worse to those who depend mainly on vision for the food, drink,\r\nand exercise, so to speak, of their growing minds.\r\n\r\nAs to the methods of teaching these and also the other sensory pupils,\r\nthe indications already given must suffice. The statement of some of\r\nthese far-reaching problems of educational psychology, and of the\r\ndirections in which their answers are to be sought, exhausts the\r\npurpose of this chapter. In general it may be said that the\r\nrecommendations made for the treatment of sensory children at the\r\nearlier stage may be extended to later periods also, and that the\r\ntreatment should be, for the most part, in intelligent contrast to\r\nthat which the motor pupils receive.\r\n\r\n_Language Study._--From this general consideration of the child\'s\r\ntraining it becomes evident that the great subjects which are most\r\nuseful for discipline in the period of secondary education are the\r\nmathematical studies on the one hand, which exercise the faculty of\r\nabstraction, and the positive sciences, which train the power of\r\nobservation and require truth to detail. If we should pursue the\r\nsubject into the collegiate period, we should find mental and moral\r\nscience, literature, and history coming to their rights. If this be in\r\nthe main psychological, we see that language study, as such, should\r\nhave no great place in secondary education. The study of grammar, as\r\nhas been already said, is very useful in the early periods of\r\ndevelopment if taught vocally; it brings the child out in\r\nself-expression, and carries its own correctives, from the fact that\r\nits results are always open to social control. These are, in my mind,\r\nthe main functions of the study of language.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, is the justification for devoting ten or twelve years of\r\nthe youth\'s time to study of a dead language, as is commonly done in\r\nthe case of Latin? The utility of expression does not enter into it,\r\nand the discipline of truth to elegant literary copy can be even so\r\nwell attained from the study of our own tongue, which is lamentably\r\nneglected. In all this dreary language study, the youth\'s interest is\r\ndried up at its source. He is fed on formulas and rules; he has no\r\noutlet for invention or discovery; lists of exceptions to the rules\r\ndestroy the remnant of his curiosity and incentive; even reasoning\r\nfrom analogy is strictly forbidden him; he is shut up from Nature as\r\nin a room with no windows; the dictionary is his authority as absolute\r\nand final as it is flat and sterile. His very industry, being forced\r\nrather than spontaneous, makes him mentally, no less than physically,\r\nstoop-shouldered and near-sighted. It seems to be one of those\r\nmistakes of the past still so well lodged in tradition and class\r\nrivalry that soundness of culture is artificially identified with its\r\nmaintenance. Yet there is no reason that the spirit of classical\r\nculture and the durable elements of Greek and Roman life should not be\r\nas well acquired--nay, better--from the study of history, arch\xc3\xa6ology,\r\nand literature. For this language work is not study of literature. Not\r\none in one hundred of the students who are forced through the\r\nperiodical examinations in these languages ever gets any insight into\r\ntheir \xc3\xa6sthetic quality or any inspiration from their form.\r\n\r\nBut more than this. At least one positively vicious effect follows\r\nfrom language study with grammar and lexicon, no matter what the\r\nlanguage be. The habit of intellectual guessing grows with the need of\r\ncontinuous effort in putting together elements which go together for\r\nno particular reason. When a thing can not be reasoned out, it may\r\njust as well be guessed out. The guess is always easier than the\r\ndictionary, and, if successful, it answers just as well. Moreover, the\r\nteacher has no way of distinguishing the pupil\'s replies which are due\r\nto the guess from those due to honest work. I venture to say, from\r\npersonal experience, that no one who has been through the usual\r\nclassical course in college and before it has not more than once\r\nstaked his all upon the happy guess at the stubborn author\'s meaning.\r\nThis shallow device becomes a substitute for honest struggle. And it\r\nis more than shallow; to guess is dishonest. It is a servant to\r\nunworthy inertia; and worse, it is a cloak to mental unreadiness and\r\nto conscious moral cowardice. The guess is a bluff to fortune when the\r\nhonest gauntlet of ignorance should be thrown down to the issue.\r\n\r\nThe effects of this show themselves in a habit of mind tolerated in\r\npersons of a literary bent, which is a marked contrast to that\r\ndemanded and exemplified by science. I think that much of our literary\r\nimpressionism and sentimentalism reveal the guessing habit.\r\n\r\nYet why guess? Why be content with an impression? Why hint of a\r\n"certain this and a certain that" when the "certain," if it mean\r\nanything, commonly means the uncertain? Things worth writing about\r\nshould be formulated clearly enough to be understood. Why let the\r\npersonal reaction of the individual\'s feeling suffice? Our youth need\r\nto be told that the guess is immoral, that hypothesis is the servant\r\nof research, that the private impression instructs nobody, that\r\npresentiment is usually wrong, that science is the best antidote to\r\nthe fear of ghosts, and that the reply "I guess so" betrays itself,\r\nwhether it arise from bravado, from cowardice, or from literary\r\nfinesse! I think that the great need of our life is honesty, that the\r\nbulwark of honesty in education is exact knowledge with the scientific\r\nhabit of mind, and, furthermore, that the greatest hindrance to these\r\nthings is the training which does not, with all the sanctions at its\r\ncommand, distinguish the real, with its infallible tests, from the\r\nshadowy and vague, but which contents itself with the throw of the\r\nintellectual dice box. Any study which tends to make the difference\r\nbetween truth and error pass with the throwing of a die, and which\r\nleads the student to be content with a result he can not verify, has\r\nsomewhat the function in his education of the puzzle in our society\r\namusements or the game of sliced animals in the nursery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE INDIVIDUAL MIND AND SOCIETY--SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE series of questions which arise when we consider the individual as\r\na member of society fall together under the general theory of what has\r\nbeen called, in a figure, Social Heredity.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of this topic will show something of the normal relation\r\nof the individual\'s mind to the social environment; and the chapter\r\nfollowing will give some hints as to the nature and position of that\r\nexceptional man in whom we are commonly so much interested--the\r\nGenius.\r\n\r\nThe theory of social heredity has been worked up through the\r\ncontributions, from different points of view, of several authors.\r\nWhat, then, is social heredity?\r\n\r\nThis is a very easy question to answer, since the group of facts which\r\nthe phrase describes are extremely familiar--so much so that the\r\nreader may despair, from such a commonplace beginning, of getting any\r\nnovelty from it. The social heritage is, of course, all that a man or\r\nwoman gets from the accumulated wisdom of society. All that the ages\r\nhave handed down--the literature, the art, the habits of social\r\nconformity, the experience of social ills, the treatment of crime, the\r\nrelief of distress, the education of the young, the provision for the\r\nold--all, in fact, however described, that we men owe to the ancestors\r\nwhom we reverence, and to the parents whose presence with us perhaps\r\nwe cherish still. Their struggles, the orator has told us, have bought\r\nour freedom; we enter into the heritage of their thought and wisdom\r\nand heroism. All true; we do. We all breathe a social atmosphere; and\r\nour growth is by this breathing-in of the tradition and example of the\r\npast.\r\n\r\nNow, if this be the social heritage, we may go on to ask: Who are to\r\ninherit it? To this we may again add the further question: How does\r\nthe one who is born to such a heritage as this come into his\r\ninheritance? And with this yet again: How may he use his\r\ninheritance--to what end and under what limitations? These questions\r\ncome so readily into the mind that we naturally wish the discussion to\r\ncover them.\r\n\r\nGenerally, then, who is eligible for the social inheritance? This heir\r\nto society we are, all of us. Society does not make a will, it is\r\ntrue; nor does society die intestate. To say that it is we who inherit\r\nthe riches of the social past of the race, is to say that we are the\r\nchildren of the past in a sense which comes upon us with all the force\r\nthat bears in upon the natural heir when he finds his name in will or\r\nlaw. But there are exceptions. And before we seek the marks of the\r\nlegitimacy of our claim to be the heirs of the hundreds of years of\r\naccumulated thought and action, it may be well to advise ourselves as\r\nto the poor creatures who do not enter into the inheritance with us.\r\nThey are those who people our asylums, our reformatories, our jails\r\nand penitentiaries; those who prey upon the body of our social life by\r\ndemands for charitable support, or for the more radical treatment by\r\nisolation in institutions; indeed, some who are born to fail in this\r\ninheritance are with us no more, even though they were of our\r\ngeneration; they have paid the penalty which their effort to wrest the\r\ninheritance from us has cost, and the grave of the murderer, the\r\nburglar, the suicide, the red-handed rebel against the law of social\r\ninheritance, is now their resting place. Society then is, when taken\r\nin the widest sense, made up of two classes of people--the heirs who\r\npossess and the delinquents by birth or conduct who have forfeited the\r\ninheritance.\r\n\r\nWe may get a clear idea of the way a man attains his social heritage\r\nby dropping figure for the present and speaking in the terms of plain\r\nnatural science. Ever since Darwin propounded the law of Natural\r\nSelection the word Variation has been current in the sense explained\r\non an earlier page.\r\n\r\nThe student in natural science has come to look for variations as the\r\nnecessary preliminary to any new step of progress and adaptation in\r\nthe sphere of organic life. Nature, we now know, is fruitful to an\r\nextraordinary degree. She produces many specimens of everything. It is\r\na general fact of reproduction that the offspring of plant or animal\r\nis quite out of proportion in numbers to the parents that produce\r\nthem, and often also to the means of living which await them. One\r\nplant produces seeds which are carried far and near--to the ocean and\r\nto the desert rocks, no less than to the soil in which they may take\r\nroot and grow. Insects multiply at a rate which is simply\r\ninconceivable to our limited capacity for thinking in figures. Animals\r\nalso produce more abundantly, and man has children in numbers which\r\nallow him to bury half his offspring yearly and yet increase the adult\r\npopulation from year to year. This means, of course, that whatever the\r\ninheritance is, all do not inherit it; some must go without a portion\r\nwhenever the resources of nature, or the family, are in any degree\r\nlimited and when competition is sharp.\r\n\r\nNow Nature solves the problem among the animals in the simplest of\r\nways. All the young born in the same family are not exactly alike;\r\n"variations" occur. There are those that are better nourished, those\r\nthat have larger muscles, those that breathe deeper and run faster. So\r\nthe question who of these shall inherit the earth, the fields, the\r\nair, the water--this is left to itself. The best of all the variations\r\nlive, and the others die. Those that do live have thus, to all intents\r\nand purposes, been "selected" for the inheritance, just as really as\r\nif the parents of the species had left a will and had been able to\r\nenforce it. This is the principle of "Natural Selection."\r\n\r\nNow, this way of looking at problems which involve aggregates of\r\nindividuals and their distribution is becoming a habit of the age.\r\nWherever the application of the principles of probability do not\r\nexplain a statistical result--that is, wherever there seem to be\r\ninfluences which favour particular individuals at the expense of\r\nothers--men turn at once to the occurrence of Variations for the\r\njustification of this seeming partiality of Nature. And what it means\r\nis that Nature is partial to individuals _in making them_, in their\r\nnatural heredity, rather than after they are born.\r\n\r\nThe principle of heredity with variations is a safe assumption to make\r\nalso in regard to mankind; and we see at once that in order to come in\r\nfor a part in the social heritage of our fathers we must be born fit\r\nfor it. We must be born so endowed for the race of social life that we\r\nassimilate, from our birth up, the spirit of the society into which we\r\nare reared. The unfittest, socially, are suppressed. In this there is\r\na distinction between this sphere of survival and that of the animal\r\nworld. In it the fittest survive, the others are lost; but in society\r\nthe unfittest are lost, all the others survive. Social selection weeds\r\nout the unfit, the murderer, the most unsocial man, and says to him:\r\n"You must die"; natural selection seeks out the most fit and says:\r\n"You alone are to live." The difference is important, for it marks a\r\nprime series of distinctions, when the conceptions drawn from biology\r\nare applied to social phenomena; but for the understanding of\r\nvariations we need not now pursue it further. The contrast may be put,\r\nhowever, in a sentence: in organic evolution we have the natural\r\nselection of the fit; in social progress we have the social\r\nsuppression of the unfit.\r\n\r\nGiven social variations, therefore, differences among men, what\r\nbecomes of this man or that? We see at once that if society is to live\r\nthere must be limits set somewhere to the degree of variation which a\r\ngiven man may show from the standards of society. And we may find out\r\nsomething of these limits by looking at the evident, and marked\r\ndifferences which actually appear about us.\r\n\r\nFirst, there is the idiot. He is not available, from a social point of\r\nview, because he varies too much on the side of defect. He shows from\r\ninfancy that he is unable to enter into the social heritage because he\r\nis unable to learn to do social things. His intelligence does not grow\r\nwith his body. Society pities him if he be without natural protection,\r\nand puts him away in an institution. So of the insane, the pronounced\r\nlunatic; he varies too much to sustain in any way the wide system of\r\nsocial relationships which society requires of each individual. Either\r\nhe is unable to take care of himself, or he attempts the life of some\r\none else, or he is the harmless, unsocial thing that wanders among us\r\nlike an animal or stands in his place like a plant. He is not a factor\r\nin social life; he has not come into the inheritance.\r\n\r\nThen there is the extraordinary class of people whom we may describe\r\nby a stronger term than those already employed. We find not only the\r\nunsocial, the negatively unfit, those whom society puts away with pity\r\nin its heart; there are also the antisocial, the class whom we usually\r\ndesignate as criminals. These persons, like the others, are\r\nvariations; but they seem to be variations in quite another way. They\r\ndo not represent lack on the intellectual side always or alone, but on\r\nthe moral side, on the social side, as such. The least we can say of\r\nthe criminals is that they tend, by heredity or by evil example, to\r\nviolate the rules which society has seen fit to lay down for the\r\ngeneral security of men living together in the enjoyment of the social\r\nheritage. So far, then, they are factors of disintegration, of\r\ndestruction; enemies of the social progress which proceeds from\r\ngeneration to generation by just this process of social inheritance.\r\nSo society says to the criminal also: "You must perish." We kill off\r\nthe worst, imprison the bad for life, attempt to reform the rest.\r\nThey, too, then, are excluded from the heritage of the past.\r\n\r\nSo our lines of eligibility get more and more narrowly drawn. The\r\ninstances of exclusion now cited serve to give us some insight into\r\nthe real qualities of the man who lives a social part, and the way he\r\ncomes to live it.\r\n\r\nPassing on to take up the second of the informal topics suggested, we\r\nhave to find the best description that we can of the social man--the\r\none who is fitted for the social life. This question concerns the\r\nprocess by which any one of us comes into the wealth of relationships\r\nwhich the social life represents. For to say that a man does this is\r\nin itself to say that he is the man society is looking for. Indeed,\r\nthis is the only way to describe the man--to actually find him.\r\nSociety is essentially a growing, shifting thing. It changes from age\r\nto age, from country to country. The Greeks had their social\r\nconditions, and the Romans theirs. Even the criminal lines are drawn\r\ndifferently, somewhat, here and there; and in a low stage of\r\ncivilization a man may pass for normal who, in our time, would be\r\ndescribed as weak in mind. This makes it necessary that the standards\r\nof judgment of a given society should be determined by an actual\r\nexamination of the society, and forbids us to say that the limits of\r\nvariation which society in general will tolerate must be this or that.\r\n\r\nWe may say, then, that the man who is fit for social life _must be\r\nborn to learn_. The need of learning is his essential need. It comes\r\nupon him from his birth. Speech is the first great social function\r\nwhich he must learn, and with it all the varieties of verbal\r\naccomplishment--reading and writing. This brings to the front the\r\ngreat method of all his learning--imitation. In order to be social he\r\nmust be imitative, imitative, imitative. He must realize for himself\r\nby action the forms, conventions, requirements, co-operations of his\r\nsocial group. All is learning; and learning not by himself and at\r\nrandom, but under the leading of the social conditions which surround\r\nhim. Plasticity is his safety and the means of his progress. So he\r\ngrows into the social organization, takes his place as a Socius in the\r\nwork of the world, and lays deep the sense of values, upon the basis\r\nof which his own contributions--if he be destined to make\r\ncontributions--to the wealth of the world are to be wrought out. This\r\ngreat fact that he is open to the play of the personal influences\r\nwhich are about him is just the "suggestibleness" which we have\r\nalready described in an earlier chapter; and the influences themselves\r\nare "suggestions"--social suggestions. These influences differ in\r\ndifferent communities, as we so often remark. The Turk learns to live\r\nin a very different system of relations of "give and take" from ours,\r\nand ours differ as much from those of the Chinese. All that is\r\ncharacteristic of the race or tribe or group or family--all this sinks\r\ninto the child and youth by his simple presence there in it, with the\r\ncapacity to learn by imitation. He is suggestible, and here are the\r\nsuggestions; he is made to inherit and he inherits. So it makes no\r\ndifference what his tribe or kindred be; let him be a learner by\r\nimitation, and he becomes in turn possessor and teacher.\r\n\r\nThe case becomes more interesting still when we give the matter\r\nanother turn, and say that in this learning all the members of society\r\nagree; _all must be born to learn the same things_. They enter, if so\r\nbe that they do, into the same social inheritance. This again seems\r\nlike a very commonplace remark; but certain things flow from it. Each\r\nmember of society gives and gets the same set of social suggestions;\r\nthe differences being the degree of progress each has made, and the\r\ndegree of variation which each one gives to what he has before\r\nreceived. This last difference is treated below where we consider the\r\ngenius.\r\n\r\nThere grows up, in all this give and take, in all the interchange of\r\nsuggestions among you, me, and the other, an obscure sense of a\r\ncertain social understanding about ourselves generally--a _Zeitgeist_,\r\nan atmosphere, a taste, or, in minor matters, a style. It is a very\r\npeculiar thing, this social spirit. The best way to understand that\r\nyou have it, and something of what it is, is to get into a circle in\r\nwhich it is different. The common phrase "fish out of water" is often\r\nheard in reference to it. But that does not serve for science. The\r\nnext best thing that I can do in the way of rendering it is to appeal\r\nto another word which has a popular sense, the word Judgment. Let us\r\nsay that there exists in every society a general system of values,\r\nfound in social usages, conventions, institutions, and formulas, and\r\nthat our judgments of social life are founded on our habitual\r\nrecognition of these values, and of the arrangement of them which has\r\nbecome more or less fixed in our society. For example, to be cordial\r\nto a disagreeable neighbour shows good social judgment in a small\r\nmatter; not to quarrel with the homoeopathic enthusiast who meets\r\nyou in the street and wishes to doctor your rheumatism out of a\r\nsymptom book--that is good judgment. In short, the man gets to show\r\nmore and more, as he grows up from childhood, a certain good judgment;\r\nand his good judgment is also the good judgment of his social set,\r\ncommunity, or nation. The psychologist might prefer to say that a man\r\n"feels" this; perhaps it would be better for psychological readers to\r\nsay simply that he has a "sense" of it; but the popular use of the\r\nword "judgment" fits so accurately into the line of distinction we are\r\nnow making that we may adhere to it. So we reach the general position\r\nthat the eligible candidate for social life must have good judgment as\r\nrepresented by the common standards of judgment of his people.\r\n\r\nIt may be doubted, however, by some of my readers whether this sense\r\nof social values called judgment is the outcome of suggestions\r\noperating throughout the term of one\'s social education. This is an\r\nessential point, and I must just assume it. It follows from what we\r\nsaid in an earlier chapter to be the way of the child\'s learning by\r\nimitation. It will appear true, I trust, to any one who may take the\r\npains to observe the child\'s tentative endeavours to act up to social\r\nusages in the family and school. One may then actually see the growth\r\nof the sort of judgment which I am describing. Psychologists are\r\ncoming to see that even the child\'s sense of his own personal self is\r\na gradual attainment, achieved step by step through his imitative\r\nresponses to his personal environment. His thought of himself is an\r\ninterpretation of his thought of others, and his thought of another\r\nis doe to further accommodation of his active processes to changes in\r\nhis thought of a possible self. Around this fundamental movement in\r\nhis personal growth all the values of his life have their play. So I\r\nsay that his sense of truth in the social relationships of his\r\nenvironment is the outcome of his very gradual learning of his\r\npersonal place in these relationships.\r\n\r\nWe reach the conclusion, therefore, from this part of our study, that\r\nthe socially unfit person is the person of poor judgment. He may have\r\nlearned a great deal; he may in the main reproduce the activities\r\nrequired by his social tradition; but with it all he is to a degree\r\nout of joint with the general system of estimated values by which\r\nsociety is held together. This may be shown to be true even of the\r\npronounced types of unsocial individuals of whom we had occasion to\r\nspeak at the outset. The criminal is, socially considered, a man of\r\npoor judgment. He may be more than this, it is true. He may have a bad\r\nstrain of heredity, what the theologians call "original sin"; he then\r\nis an "habitual criminal" in the current distinction of criminal\r\ntypes; and his own sense of his failure to accept the teachings of\r\nsociety may be quite absent, since crime is so normal to him. But the\r\nfact remains that in his judgment he is mistaken; his normal is not\r\nsociety\'s normal. He has failed to be educated in the judgments of his\r\nfellows, however besides and however more deeply he may have failed.\r\nOr, again, the criminal may commit crime simply because he is carried\r\naway in an eddy of good companionship, which represents a temporary\r\ncurrent of social life; or his nervous energies may be overtaxed\r\ntemporarily or drained of their strength, so that his education in\r\nsocial judgment is forgotten: he is then the "occasional" criminal. It\r\nis true of the man of this type also that while he remains a criminal\r\nhe has lost his balance, has yielded to temptation, has gratified\r\nprivate impulse at the expense of social sanity; all this shows the\r\nlack of that sustaining force of moral consciousness which represents\r\nthe level of social rightness in his time and place. Then, as to the\r\nidiot, the imbecile, the insane, they, too, have no good judgment, for\r\nthe very adequate but pitiful reason that they have no judgment at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is the doctrine of Social Heredity; it illustrates the\r\nside of conformity, of personal acquiescence on the part of the\r\nindividual in the rules of social life. Another equally important\r\nside, that of the personal initiative and influence of the individual\r\nmind in society, remains to be spoken of in the next chapter. Social\r\nHeredity emphasizes _Imitation_; the Genius, to whom we now turn,\r\nillustrates _Invention_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE GENIUS AND HIS ENVIRONMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe facts concerning the genius seem to indicate that he is a being\r\nsomewhat exceptional and apart. Common mortals stand about him with\r\nexpressions of awe. The literature of him is embodied in the alcoves\r\nof our libraries most accessible to the public, and even the\r\nwayfaring man, to whom life is a weary round, and his conquests over\r\nnature and his fellows only the division of honours on a field that\r\nusually witnesses drawn battles or bloody defeats, loves to stimulate\r\nhis courage by hearing of the lives of those who put nature and\r\nsociety so utterly to rout. He hears of men who swayed the destinies\r\nof Europe, who taught society by outraging her conventions, whose\r\nmorality even was reached sometimes by scorn of the peccadilloes which\r\ncondemn the ordinary man. Every man has in him in some degree the hero\r\nworshipper, and gets inflamed somewhat by reading Carlyle\'s Frederick\r\nthe Great.\r\n\r\nOf course, this popular sense can not be wholly wrong. The genius does\r\naccomplish the world movements. Napoleon did set the destiny of\r\nEurope, and Frederick did reveal, in a sense, a new phase of moral\r\nconduct. The truth of these things is just what makes the enthusiasm\r\nof the common man so healthy and stimulating. It is not the least that\r\nthe genius accomplishes that he thus elevates the traditions of man\r\nand inspires the literature that the people read. He sows the seeds of\r\neffort in the fertile soil of the newborn of his own kind, while he\r\nleads those who do not have the same gifts to rear and tend the\r\ngrowing plant in their own social gardens. This is true; and a\r\nphilosophy of society should not overlook either of the facts--the\r\nactual deeds of the great man with his peculiar influence upon his own\r\ntime, and his lasting place in the more inspiring social tradition\r\nwhich is embodied in literature and art.\r\n\r\nYet the psychologist has to present just the opposite aspect of these\r\napparent exceptions to the Canons of our ordinary social life. He has\r\nto oppose the extreme claim made by the writers who attempt to lift\r\nthe genius quite out of the normal social movement. For it only needs\r\na moment\'s consideration to see that if the genius has no reasonable\r\nplace in the movement of social progress in the world, then there can\r\nbe no possible doctrine or philosophy of such progress. To the hero\r\nworshipper his hero comes in simply to "knock out," so to speak, all\r\nthe regular movement of the society which is so fortunate, or so\r\nunfortunate, as to have given him birth; and by his initiative the\r\naspirations, beliefs, struggles of the community or state get a push\r\nin a new direction--a tangent to the former movement or a reversal of\r\nit. If this be true, and it be farther true that no genius who is\r\nlikely to appear can be discounted by any human device before his\r\nabrupt appearance upon the stage of action, then the history of facts\r\nmust take the place of the science or philosophy of them, and the\r\nchronicler become the only historian with a right to be.\r\n\r\nFor of what value can we hold the contribution which the genius makes\r\nto thought if this contribution runs so across the acquisitions of the\r\nearlier time and the contributions of earlier genius that no line of\r\ncommon truth can be discovered between him and them? Then each society\r\nwould have its own explanation of itself, and that only so long as it\r\nproduced no new genius. It may be, of course, that society is so\r\nconstituted--or, rather, so lacking in constitution--that simple\r\nvariations in brain physiology are the sufficient reason for its\r\ncataclysms; but a great many efforts will be made to prove the\r\ncontrary before this highest of all spheres of human activity is\r\ndeclared to have no meaning--no thread which runs from age to age and\r\nlinks mankind, the genius and the man who plods, in a common and\r\nsignificant development.\r\n\r\nIn undertaking this task we must try to judge the genius with\r\nreference to the sane social man, the normal Socius. What he is we\r\nhave seen. He is a person _who learns to judge by the judgments of\r\nsociety_. What, then, shall we say of the genius from this point of\r\nview? Can the hero worshipper be right in saying that the genius\r\nteaches society to judge; or shall we say that the genius, like other\r\nmen, must learn to judge by the judgments of society?\r\n\r\nThe most fruitful point of view is, no doubt, that which considers the\r\ngenius a variation. And unless we do this it is evidently impossible\r\nto get any theory which will bring him into a general scheme. But how\r\ngreat a variation? And in what direction?--these are the questions.\r\nThe great variations found in the criminal by heredity, the insane,\r\nthe idiotic, etc., we have found excluded from society; so we may well\r\nask why the genius is not excluded also. If our determination of the\r\nlimits within which society decides who is to be excluded is correct,\r\nthen the genius must come within these limits. He can not escape them\r\nand live socially.\r\n\r\n_The Intelligence of the Genius._--The directions in which the genius\r\nactually varies from the average man are evident as a matter of fact.\r\nHe is, first of all, a man of great power of thought, of great\r\n"constructive imagination," as the psychologists say. So let us\r\nbelieve, first, that a genius is a man who has occasionally greater\r\nthoughts than other men have. Is this a reason for excluding him from\r\nsociety? Certainly not; for by great thoughts we mean true thoughts,\r\nthoughts which will work, thoughts which will bring in a new area in\r\nthe discovery of principles, or of their application. This is just\r\nwhat all development depends upon, this attainment of novelty, which\r\nis consistent with older knowledge and supplementary to it. But\r\nsuppose a man have thoughts which are not true, which do not fit the\r\ntopic of their application, which contradict established knowledges,\r\nor which result in bizarre and fanciful combinations of them; to that\r\nman we deny the name genius; he is a crank, an agitator, an anarchist,\r\nor what not. The test, then, which we bring to bear upon the\r\nintellectual variations which men show is that of truth, practical\r\nworkability--in short, to sum it up, "fitness." Any thought, to live\r\nand germinate, must be a fit thought. And the community\'s sense of the\r\nfitness of the thought is their rule of judgment.\r\n\r\nNow, the way the community got this sense--that is the great result we\r\nhave reached above. Their sense of fitness is just what I called above\r\ntheir judgment. So far, at least, as it relates to matters of social\r\nimport, it is of social origin. It reflects the outcome of all social\r\nheredity, tradition, education. The sense of social truth is their\r\ncriterion of social thoughts, and unless the social reformer\'s thought\r\nbe in some way fit to go into the setting thus made by earlier social\r\ndevelopment, he is not a genius but a crank.\r\n\r\nI may best show the meaning of the claim that society makes upon the\r\ngenius by asking in how far in actual life he manages to escape this\r\naccount of himself to society. The facts are very plain, and this is\r\nthe class of facts which some writers urge, as supplying an adequate\r\nrule for the application of the principles of their social philosophy.\r\nThe simple fact is, say they, that without the consent of society the\r\nthoughts of your hero, whether he be genius or fool, are practically\r\nvalueless. The fulness of time must come; and the genius before his\r\ntime, if judged by his works, can not be a genius at all. His thought\r\nmay be great, so great that, centuries after, society may attain to it\r\nas its richest outcome and its profoundest intuition; but before, that\r\ntime, it is as bizarre as a madman\'s fancies and as useless. What\r\nwould be thought, we might be asked by writers of this school, of a\r\nrat which developed upon its side the hand of a man, with all its\r\nmechanism of bone, muscle, tactile sensibility, and power of delicate\r\nmanipulation, if the remainder of the creature were true to the\r\npattern of a rat? Would not the rest of the rat tribe be justified in\r\nleaving this anomaly behind to starve in the hole where his singular\r\nappendage held him fast? Is such a rat any the less a monster because\r\nman finds use for his hands.\r\n\r\nTo a certain extent this argument is forcible and true. If social\r\nutility be our rule of definition, then certainly the premature genius\r\nis no genius. And this rule of definition may be put in another way\r\nwhich renders it still more plausible. The variations which occur in\r\nintellectual endowment, in a community, vary about a mean; there is,\r\ntheoretically, an average man. The differences among men which can be\r\ntaken account of in any philosophy of life must be in some way\r\nreferable to this mean. The variation which does not find its niche at\r\nall in the social environment, but which strikes all the social\r\nfellows with disapproval, getting no sympathy whatever, is thereby\r\nexposed to the charge of being the "sport" of Nature and the fruit of\r\nchance. The lack of hearing which awaits such a man sets him in a form\r\nof isolation, and stamps him not only as a social crank, but also as a\r\ncosmic tramp.\r\n\r\nPut in its positive and usual form, this view simply claims that man\r\nis always the outcome of the social movement. The reception he gets is\r\na measure of the degree in which he adequately represents this\r\nmovement. Certain variations are possible--men who are forward in the\r\nlegitimate progress of society--and these men are the true and only\r\ngeniuses. Other variations, which seem to discount the future too\r\nmuch, are "sports"; for the only permanent discounting of the future\r\nis that which is projected from the elevation of the past.\r\n\r\nThe great defect of this view is found in its definitions. We exclaim\r\nat once: who made the past the measure of the future? and who made\r\nsocial approval the measure of truth? What is there to eclipse the\r\nvision of the poet, the inventor, the seer, that he should not see\r\nover the heads of his generation, and raise his voice for that which,\r\nto all men else, lies behind the veil? The social philosophy of this\r\nschool can not answer these questions, I think; nor can it meet the\r\nappeal we all make to history when we cite the names of Aristotle,\r\nPascal, and Newton, or of any of the men who single-handed and alone\r\nhave set guide-posts to history, and given to the world large portions\r\nof its heritage of truth. What can set limit to the possible\r\nvariations of fruitful intellectual power? Rare such variations--that\r\nis their law: the greater the variation, the more rare! But so is\r\ngenius; the greater, the more rare. As to the rat with the human hand,\r\nhe would not be left to starve and decay in his hole; he would be put\r\nin alcohol when he died, and kept in a museum! And the lesson which he\r\nwould teach to the wise biologist would be that here in this rat\r\nNature had shown her genius by discounting in advance the slow\r\nprocesses of evolution!\r\n\r\nIt is, indeed, the force of such considerations as these which have\r\nled to many justifications of the positions that the genius is quite\r\nout of connection with the social movement of his time. The genius\r\nbrings his variations to society whether society will or no; and as to\r\nharmony between them, that is a matter of outcome rather than of\r\nexpectation or theory. We are told the genius comes as a\r\nbrain-variation; and between the physical heredity which produces him\r\nand the social heredity which sets the tradition of his time there is\r\nno connection.\r\n\r\nBut this is not tenable, as we have reason to think, from the\r\ninteraction which actually takes place between physical and social\r\nheredity. To be sure, the heredity of the individual is a\r\nphysiological matter, in the sense that the son must inherit from his\r\nparents and their ancestors alone. But granted that two certain\r\nparents are his parents, we may ask how these two certain parents came\r\nto be his parents. How did his father come to marry his mother, and\r\nthe reverse? This is distinctly a social question; and to its solution\r\nall the currents of social influence and suggestion contribute. Who is\r\nfree from social considerations in selecting his wife? Does the\r\ncoachman have an equal chance to get the heiress, or the blacksmith\r\nthe clergyman\'s daughter? Do we find inroads made in Newport society\r\nby the ranchman and the dry-goods clerk? And are not the inroads which\r\nwe do find, the inroads made by the counts and the marquises, due to\r\ninfluences which are quite social and psychological? Again, on the\r\nother hand, what leads the count and the marquis, to lay their titles\r\nat Newport doors, while the ranchman and the dry-goods clerk keep\r\naway, but the ability of both these types of suitors to estimate their\r\nchances just on social and psychological grounds? Novelists have rung\r\nthe changes on this intrusion of social influences into the course of\r\nphysical heredity. Bourget\'s Cosmopolis is a picture of the influence\r\nof social race characteristics on natural heredity, with the reaction\r\nof natural heredity again upon the new social conditions.\r\n\r\nA speech of a character of Balzac\'s is to the point, as illustrating a\r\ncertain appreciation of these social considerations which we all to a\r\ndegree entertain. The Duchesse de Carigliano says to Madame de\r\nSommervieux: "I know the world too well, my dear, to abandon myself to\r\nthe discretion of a too superior man. You should know that one may\r\nallow them to court one, but marry them--that is a mistake! Never--no,\r\nno. It is like wanting to find pleasure in inspecting the machinery of\r\nthe opera instead of sitting in a box to enjoy its brilliant\r\nillusions." To be sure, we do not generally deliberate in this wise\r\nwhen we fall in love; but that is not necessary, since our social\r\nenvironment sets the style by the kind of intangible deliberation\r\nwhich I have called judgment and fitness. Suppose a large number of\r\nNorthern advocates of social equality should migrate to the Southern\r\nUnited States, and, true to their theory, intermarry with the blacks.\r\nWould it not then be true that a social theory had run athwart the\r\ncourse of physiological descent, leading to the production of a\r\nlegitimate mulatto society? A new race might spring from such a purely\r\npsychological or social initiation.\r\n\r\nWhile not agreeing, therefore, with the theory which makes the genius\r\nindependent of the social movement--least of all with the doctrine\r\nthat physical heredity is uninfluenced by social conditions--the hero\r\nworshipper is right, nevertheless, in saying that we can not set the\r\nlimitations of the genius on the side of variations toward high\r\nintellectual endowment. So if the general position be true that he is\r\na variation of some kind, we must look elsewhere for the direction of\r\nthose peculiar traits whose excess would be his condemnation. This we\r\ncan find only in connection with the other demand that we make of the\r\nordinary man--the demand that he be a man of good judgment. And to\r\nthis we may now turn.\r\n\r\n_The Judgment of the Genius._--We should bear in mind in approaching\r\nthis topic the result which follows from the reciprocal character of\r\nsocial relationships. No genius ever escapes the requirements laid\r\ndown for his learning, his social heredity. Mentally he is a social\r\noutcome, as well as are the fellows who sit in judgment on him. He\r\nmust judge his own thoughts therefore as they do. And his own proper\r\nestimate of things and thoughts, his relative sense of fitness, gets\r\napplication, by a direct law of his own mental processes, to himself\r\nand to his own creations. The limitations which, in the judgment of\r\nsociety, his variations must not overstep, are set by his own\r\njudgment also. If the man in question have thoughts which are\r\nsocially true, _he must himself know that they are true_. So we reach\r\na conclusion regarding the selection of the particular thoughts which\r\nthe genius may have: _he and society must agree in regard to the\r\nfitness of them_, although in particular cases this agreement ceases\r\nto be the emphatic thing. The essential thing comes to be the\r\nreflection of the social standard in the thinker\'s own judgment; _the\r\nthoughts thought must always be critically judged by the thinker\r\nhimself; and for the most part his judgment is at once also the social\r\njudgment_. This may be illustrated further.\r\n\r\nSuppose we take the man of striking thoughts and withal no sense of\r\nfitness--none of the judgment about them which society has. He will go\r\nthrough a mighty host of discoveries every hour. The very eccentricity\r\nof his imaginations will only appeal to him for the greater\r\nadmiration. He will bring his most chimerical schemes out and air them\r\nwith the same assurance with which the real inventor exhibits his. But\r\nsuch a man is not pronounced a genius. If his ravings about this and\r\nthat are harmless, we smile and let him talk; but if his lack of\r\njudgment extend to things of grave import, or be accompanied by equal\r\nillusions regarding himself and society in other relationships, then\r\nwe classify his case and put him into the proper ward for the insane.\r\nTwo of the commonest forms of such impairment of judgment are seen in\r\nthe victims of "fixed ideas" on the one hand, and the _exalt\xc3\xa9s_ on the\r\nother. These men have no true sense of values, no way of selecting the\r\nfit combinations of imagination from the unfit; and even though some\r\ntranscendently true and original thought were to flit through the\r\ndiseased mind of such a one, it would go as it came, and the world\r\nwould wait for a man with a sense of fitness to arise and rediscover\r\nit. The other class, the _exalt\xc3\xa9s_, are somewhat the reverse; the\r\nillusion of personal greatness is so strong that their thoughts seem\r\nto them infallible and their persons divine.\r\n\r\nMen of such perversions of judgment are common among us. We all know\r\nthe man who seems to be full of rich and varied thought, who holds us\r\nsometimes by the power of his conceptions or the beauty of his\r\ncreations, but in whose thought we yet find some incongruity, some\r\neminently unfit element, some grotesque application, some elevation or\r\ndepression from the level of commonplace truth, some ugly strain in\r\nthe \xc3\xa6sthetic impression. The man himself does not know it, and that is\r\nthe reason he includes it. His sense of fitness is dwarfed or\r\nparalyzed. We in the community come to regret that he is so\r\n"visionary," with all his talent; so we accommodate ourselves to his\r\nunfruitfulness, and at the best only expect an occasional hour\'s\r\nentertainment under the spell of his presence. This certainly is not\r\nthe man to produce a world movement.\r\n\r\nMost of the men we call "cranks" are of this type. They are\r\nessentially lacking in judgment, and the popular estimate of them is\r\nexactly right.\r\n\r\nIt is evident, therefore, from this last explanation, that there is a\r\nsecond direction of variation among men: _variation in their sense of\r\nthe truth and value of their own thoughts_, and with them of the\r\nthoughts of others. This is the great limitation which the man of\r\ngenius shares with men generally--a limitation in the amount of\r\nvariation which he may show in his social judgments, especially as\r\nthese variations affect the claim which he makes upon society for\r\nrecognition. It is evident that this must be an important factor in\r\nour estimate of the claims of the hero to our worship, especially\r\nsince it is the more obscure side of his temperament, and the side\r\ngenerally overlooked altogether. This let us call, in our further\r\nillustrations, the "social sanity" of the man of genius.\r\n\r\nThe first indication of the kind of social variation which oversteps\r\neven the degree of indulgence society is willing to accord to the\r\ngreat thinker is to be found in the effect which education has upon\r\ncharacter. The discipline of social development is, as we have seen,\r\nmainly conducive to the reduction of eccentricities, the levelling off\r\nof personal peculiarities. All who come into the social heritage learn\r\nthe same great series of lessons derived from the past, and all get\r\nthe sort of judgment required in social life from the common exercises\r\nof the home and school in the formative years of their education. So\r\nwe should expect that the greater singularities of disposition which\r\nrepresent insuperable difficulty in the process of social assimilation\r\nwould show themselves early. Here it is that the actual conflict\r\ncomes--the struggle between impulse and social restraint. Many a\r\ngenius owes the redemption of his intellectual gifts to legitimate\r\nsocial uses to the victory gained by a teacher and the discipline\r\nlearned through obedience. And thus it is also that many who give\r\npromise of great distinction in early life fail to achieve it. They\r\nrun off after a phantom, and society pronounces them mad. In their\r\ncase the personal factor has overcome the social factor; they have\r\nfailed in the lessons they should have learned, their own\r\nself-criticism is undisciplined, and they miss the mark.\r\n\r\nThese two extremes of variation, however, do not exhaust the case. One\r\nof them tends in a measure to the blurring of the light of genius, and\r\nthe other to the rejection of social restraint to a degree which makes\r\nthe potential genius over into a crank. The average man is the mean.\r\nPut the greatest reach of human attainment, and with it the greatest\r\ninfluence ever exercised by man, is yet more than either of these. It\r\nis not enough, the hero worshipper may still say, that the genius\r\nshould have sane and healthy judgment, as society reckons sanity. The\r\nfact still remains that even in his social judgments he may instruct\r\nsociety. He may stand alone and, by sheer might, left his fellow-men\r\nup to his point of vantage, to their eternal gain and to his eternal\r\npraise. Even let it be that he must have self-criticism, the sense of\r\nfitness you speak of, that very sense may transcend the vulgar\r\njudgment of his fellows. His judgment may be saner than theirs; and as\r\nhis intellectual creations are great and unique, so may his sense of\r\ntheir truth be full and unique. Wagner led the musical world by his\r\nsingle-minded devotion to the ideas of Wagner; and Darwin had to be\r\ntrue to his sense of truth and to the formulations of his thought,\r\nthough no man accorded him the right to instruct his generation either\r\nin the one or in the other. To be sure, this divine assurance of the\r\nman of genius may be counterfeited; the vulgar dreamer often has it.\r\nBut, nevertheless, when a genius has it, he is not a vulgar dreamer.\r\n\r\nThis is true, I think, and the explanation of it leads us to the last\r\nfruitful application of the doctrine of variations. Just as the\r\nintellectual endowment of men may vary within very wide limits, so may\r\nthe social qualifications of men. There are men who find it their meat\r\nto do society service. There are men so naturally born to take the\r\nlead in social reform, in executive matters, in organization, in\r\nplanning our social campaigns for us, that we turn to them as by\r\ninstinct. They have a kind of insight to which we can only bow. They\r\ngain the confidence of men, win the support of women, and excite the\r\nacclamations of children. These people are the social geniuses. They\r\nseem to anticipate the discipline of social education. They do not\r\nneed to learn the lessons of the social environment.\r\n\r\nNow, such persons undoubtedly represent a variation toward\r\nsuggestibility of the most delicate and singular kind. They surpass\r\nthe teachers from whom they learn. It is hard to say that they "learn\r\nto judge by the judgments of society." They so judge without seeming\r\nto learn, yet they differ from the man whose eccentricities forbid him\r\nto learn through the discipline of society. The two are opposite\r\nextremes of variation; that seems to me the only possible construction\r\nof them. It is the difference between the ice boat which travels\r\nfaster than the wind and the skater who braves the wind and battles\r\nup-current in it. The latter is soon beaten by the opposition; the\r\nformer outruns its ally. The crank, the eccentric, the enthusiast--all\r\nthese run counter to sane social judgment; but the genius leads\r\nsociety to his own point of view, and interprets the social movement\r\nso accurately, sympathetically, and with such profound insight that\r\nhis very singularity gives greater relief to his inspiration.\r\n\r\nNow let a man combine with this insight--this extraordinary sanity of\r\nsocial judgment--the power of great inventive and constructive\r\nthought, and then, at last, we have our genius, our hero, and one that\r\nwe well may worship! To great thought he adds balance; to originality,\r\njudgment. This is the man to start the world movements if we want a\r\nsingle man to start them. For as he thinks profoundly, so he\r\ndiscriminates his thoughts justly, and assigns them values. His\r\nfellows judge with him, or learn to judge after him, and they lend to\r\nhim the motive forces of success--enthusiasm, reward. He may wait for\r\nrecognition, he may suffer imprisonment, he may be muzzled for\r\nthinking his thoughts, he may die and with him the truth to which he\r\ngave but silent birth. But the world comes, by its slower progress, to\r\ntraverse the path in which he wished to lead it; and if so be that his\r\nthought was recorded, posterity revives it in regretful sentences on\r\nhis tomb.\r\n\r\nThe two things to be emphasized, therefore, on the rational side of\r\nthe phenomenally great man--I mean on the side of our means of\r\naccounting for him in reasonable terms--are these: first, his\r\nintellectual originality; and, second, the sanity of his judgment. And\r\nit is the variations in this second sort of endowment which give the\r\nground which various writers have for the one-sided views now current\r\nin popular literature.\r\n\r\nWe are told, on the one hand, that the genius is a "degenerate"; on\r\nanother hand, that he is to be classed with those of "insane" temper;\r\nand yet again, that his main characteristic is his readiness to\r\noutrage society by performing criminal acts. All these so-called\r\ntheories rely upon facts--so far as they have any facts to rest\r\nupon--which, if space permitted, we might readily estimate from our\r\npresent point of view. In so far as a really great man busies himself\r\nmainly with things that are objective, which are socially and morally\r\nneutral--such as electricity, natural history, mechanical theory, with\r\nthe applications of these--of course, the mental capacity which he\r\npossesses is the main thing, and his absorption in these things may\r\nlead to a warped sense of the more ideal and refined relationships\r\nwhich are had in view by the writer in quest for degeneracy. It will\r\nstill be admitted, however, by those who are conversant with the\r\nhistory of science, that the greatest scientific geniuses have been\r\nmen of profound quietness of life and normal social development. It is\r\nto the literary and artistic genius that the seeker after abnormality\r\nhas to turn; and in this field, again, the facts serve to show their\r\nown meaning.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule, these artistic prodigies do not represent the union\r\nof variations which we find in the greatest genius. Such men are often\r\ndistinctly lacking in power of sustained constructive thought. Their\r\ninsight is largely what is called intuitive. They have flashes of\r\nemotional experience which crystallize into single creations of art.\r\nThey depend upon "inspiration"--a word which is responsible for much\r\nof the overrating of such men, and for a good many of their illusions.\r\nNot that they do not perform great feats in the several spheres in\r\nwhich their several "inspirations" come; but with it all they often\r\npresent the sort of unbalance and fragmentary intellectual endowment\r\nwhich allies them, in particular instances, to the classes of persons\r\nwhom the theories we are noticing have in view. It is only to be\r\nexpected that the sharp jutting variation in the emotional and\r\n\xc3\xa6sthetic realm which the great artist often shows should carry with it\r\nirregularities in heredity in other respects. Moreover, the very habit\r\nof living by inspiration brings prominently into view any half-hidden\r\npeculiarities which he may have in the remark of his associates, and\r\nin the conduct of his own social duties. But mark you, I do not\r\ndiscredit the superb art of many examples of the artistic\r\n"degenerate," so-called; that would be to brand some of the highest\r\nministrations of genius, to us men, as random and illegitimate, and to\r\nconsider impure some of our most exalting and intoxicating sources of\r\ninspiration. But I do still say that wherein such men move us and\r\ninstruct us they are _in these spheres_ above all things sane with our\r\nown sanity, and wherein they are insane they do discredit to that\r\nhighest of all offices to which their better gifts make legitimate\r\nclaim--the instruction of mankind.\r\n\r\nAgain one of Balzac\'s characters hits the nail on the head. "My dear\r\nmother," says Augustine, in the Sign of the Cat and Racket, "you judge\r\nsuperior people too severely. If their ideas were the same as other\r\nfolks they would not be men of genius."\r\n\r\n"Very well," replies Madame Guillaume, "then let men of genius stop at\r\nhome and not get married. What! A man of genius is to make his wife\r\nmiserable? And because he is a genius it is all right! Genius! genius!\r\nIt is not so very clever to say black one minute and white the next,\r\nas he does, to interrupt other people, to dance such rigs at home,\r\nnever to let you know which foot you are to stand on, to compel his\r\nwife never to be amused unless my lord is in gay spirits, and to be\r\ndull when he is dull."\r\n\r\n"But his imaginations...."\r\n\r\n"What are such imaginations?" Madame Guillaume went on, interrupting\r\nher daughter again. "Fine ones are his, my word! What possesses a man,\r\nthat all on a sudden, without consulting a doctor, he takes it into\r\nhis head to eat nothing but vegetables? There, get along! if he were\r\nnot so grossly immoral, he would be fit to shut up in a lunatic\r\nasylum."\r\n\r\n"O mother, can you believe?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do believe. I met him in the Champs \xc3\x89lys\xc3\xa9es. He was on\r\nhorseback. Well, at one minute he was galloping as hard as he could\r\ntear, and then pulled up to a walk. I said to myself at that moment,\r\n\'There is a man devoid of judgment!\'"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe main consideration which this chapter aims to present, that of the\r\nresponsibility of all men, be they great or be they small, to the same\r\nstandards of social judgment, and to the same philosophical treatment,\r\nis illustrated in the very man to whose genius we owe the principle\r\nupon which my remarks are based--Charles Darwin; and it is singularly\r\nappropriate that we should also find the history of this very\r\nprinciple, that of variations with the correlative principle of\r\nnatural selection, furnishing a capital illustration of our\r\ninferences. Darwin was, with the single exception of Aristotle,\r\npossibly the man with the sanest judgment that the human mind has ever\r\nbrought to the investigation of nature. He represented, in an\r\nexceedingly adequate way, the progress of scientific method up to his\r\nday. He was disciplined in all the natural science of his\r\npredecessors. His judgment was an epitome of the scientific insight of\r\nthe ages which culminated then. The time was ripe for just such a\r\ngreat constructive thought as his--ripe, that is, so far as the\r\naccumulation of scientific data was concerned. His judgment differed\r\nthen from the judgment of his scientific contemporaries mainly in that\r\nit was sounder and safer than theirs. And with it Darwin was a great\r\nconstructive thinker. He had the intellectual strength which put the\r\njudgment of his time to the strain--everybody\'s but his own. This is\r\nseen in the fact that Darwin was not the first to speculate in the\r\nline of his great discovery, nor to reach formulas; but with the\r\nothers guessing took the place of induction. The formula was an\r\nuncriticised thought. The unwillingness of society to embrace the\r\nhypothesis was justified by the same lack of evidence which prevented\r\nthe thinkers themselves from giving it proof. And if no Darwin had\r\nappeared, the problem of evolution would have been left about where it\r\nhad been left by the speculations of the Greek mind. Darwin reached\r\nhis conclusion by what that other great scientific genius in England,\r\nNewton, described as the essential of discovery, "patient thought";\r\nand having reached it, he had no alternative but to judge it true and\r\npronounce it to the world.\r\n\r\nBut the principle of variations with natural selection had the\r\nreception which shows that good judgment may rise higher than the\r\nlevel of its own social origin. Even yet the principle of Darwin is\r\nbut a spreading ferment in many spheres of human thought in which it\r\nis destined to bring the same revolution that it has worked in the\r\nsciences of organic life. And it was not until other men, who had both\r\nauthority with the public and sufficient information to follow\r\nDarwin\'s thought, seconded his judgment, that his formula began to\r\nhave currency in scientific circles.\r\n\r\nNow we may ask: Does not any theory of man which loses sight of the\r\nsupreme sanity of Darwin, and with him of Aristotle, and Angelo, and\r\nLeonardo, and Newton, and Leibnitz, and Shakespeare, seem weak and paltry?\r\nDo not delicacy of sentiment, brilliancy of wit, fineness of rhythmical\r\nand \xc3\xa6sthetic sense, the beautiful contributions of the talented special\r\nperformer, sink into something like apologies--something even like\r\nprofanation of that name to conjure by, the name of genius? And all the\r\nmore if the profanation is made real by the moral irregularities or the\r\nsocial shortcomings which give some colour of justification to the\r\nappellation "degenerate"!\r\n\r\nBut, on the other hand, why run to the other extreme and make this\r\nmost supremely human of all men an anomaly, a prodigy, a bolt from the\r\nblue, an element of extreme disorder, born to further or to distract\r\nthe progress of humanity by a chance which no man can estimate? The\r\nresources of psychological theory are adequate, as I have endeavoured\r\nto show, to the construction of a doctrine of society which is based\r\nupon the individual, in all the possibilities of variation which his\r\nheredity may bring forth, and which yet does not hide nor veil those\r\nheights of human greatness on which the halo of genius is wont to\r\nrest. Let us add knowledge to our surprise in the presence of such a\r\nman, and respect to our knowledge, and worship, if you please, to our\r\nrespect, and with it all we then begin to see that because of him the\r\nworld is the better place for us to live and work in.\r\n\r\nWe find that, after all, we may be social psychologists and hero\r\nworshippers as well. And by being philosophers we have made our\r\nworship more an act of tribute to human nature. The heathen who bows\r\nin apprehension or awe before the image of an unknown god may be\r\nrendering all the worship he knows; but the soul that finds its\r\ndivinity by knowledge and love has communion of another kind. So the\r\nworship which many render to the unexplained, the fantastic, the\r\ncataclysmal--this is the awe that is born of ignorance. Given a\r\nphilosophy that brings the great into touch with the commonplace, that\r\ndelineates the forces which arise to their highest grandeur only in a\r\nman here and there, that enables us to contrast the best in us with\r\nthe poverty of him, and then we may do intelligent homage. To know\r\nthat the greatest men of earth are men who think as I do, but deeper,\r\nand see the real as I do, but clearer, who work to the goal that I do,\r\nbut faster, and serve humanity as I do, but better--that may be an\r\nincitement to my humility, but it is also an inspiration to my life.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITERATURE[14]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: Only books in English.

The examples and\r\napplications of the work are almost entirely derived from this\r\ncountry, so that it may be properly considered an American geology. We\r\ncan commend this work without qualification to all who desire an\r\nintelligent acquaintance with geological science, as fresh, lucid,\r\nfull, and authentic, the result of devoted study and of long\r\nexperience in teaching."--_Popular Science Monthly._\r\n\r\n_EVOLUTION AND ITS RELATION TO RELIGIOUS THOUGHT._ With numerous\r\nIllustrations. New and enlarged edition. 12mo. Cloth, $1.50.\r\n\r\n"The questions suggested by this title must weigh with more or less\r\npersistence on the mind of every intelligent and liberal thinker....\r\nThe man who can keep his science and his religion in two boxes, either\r\nof which may be opened separately is to be congratulated. Many of us\r\ncan not, and his peace of mind we can not attain. Therefore every\r\ncontribution toward a means of clearer vision is most welcome, above\r\nall when it comes from one who knows the ground on which he stands,\r\nand has conquered his right to be there.... Professor Le Conte is a\r\nman in whom reverence and imagination have not become desiccated by a\r\nscientific atmosphere, but flourish, in due subordination and control,\r\nto embellish and vivify his writings. Those who know them have come to\r\nexpect a peculiar alertness of mind and freshness of method in any new\r\nwork by this author, whether his conclusions be such as they are ready\r\nto receive or not."--_The Nation._\r\n\r\n_RELIGION AND SCIENCE._ A Series of Sunday Lectures on the Relation of\r\nNatural and Revealed Religion, or the Truths revealed in Nature and\r\nScripture. 12mo.

With a Preface by Prof. Dr. E. Mendel.\r\nTranslated from the second edition of the German work. Large 8vo,\r\nuniform with Nordau\'s "Degeneration." Cloth, $3.50.\r\n\r\nDr. Hirsch\'s acute and suggestive study of modern tendencies was begun\r\nbefore "Degeneration" was published, with the purpose of presenting\r\nentirely opposite deductions and conclusions. The appearance of Dr.\r\nNordau\'s famous book, with its criticisms upon Dr. Hirsch\'s position,\r\nenabled the latter to extend the scope of his work, which becomes a\r\nscientific answer to Dr. Nordau, although this was not his specific\r\npurpose originally. Dr. Nordau has startled the reading world by his\r\ncry of "Degeneration"; Dr. Hirsch opposes his conclusions by\r\ndemonstrating the difference between "Genius" and "Degeneration," and\r\nanalyzing the social, literary, and artistic manifestations of the day\r\ndispassionately and with a wealth of suggestive illustrations.\r\n\r\n"The first intelligent, rational, and scientific study of a great\r\nsubject.... In the development of his argument Dr. Hirsch frequently\r\nfinds it necessary to attack the positions assumed by Nordau and\r\nLombroso, his two leading adversaries.... Only calm and sober reason\r\nendure. Dr. Hirsch possesses that calmness and sobriety. His work will\r\nfind a permanent place among the authorities of science."--_New York\r\nHerald_.\r\n\r\n"Dr. Hirsch\'s researches are intended to bring the reader to the\r\nconviction that \'no psychological meaning can be attached to the word\r\ngenius.\'... While all men of genius have common traits, they are not\r\ntraits characteristic of genius; they are such as are possessed by\r\nother men, and more or less by all men.... Dr. Hirsch believes that\r\nmost of the great men, both of art and science, were misunderstood by\r\ntheir contemporaries, and were only appreciated after they were\r\ndead."--_Miss J. L. Gilder in the Sunday World._\r\n\r\n"\'Genius and Degeneration\' ought to be read by every man and woman who\r\nprofesses to keep in touch with modern thought. It is deeply\r\ninteresting and so full of information that by intellectual readers it\r\nwill be seized upon with avidity."--_Buffalo Commercial._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n"A SUBJECT GREAT AND FASCINATING."\r\n\r\nDegeneration.\r\n\r\nBy Professor MAX NORDAU. Translated from the second edition of the\r\nGerman work. 8vo. Cloth, $3.50.\r\n\r\n"A powerful, trenchant, savage attack on all the leading literary and\r\nartistic idols of the time by a man of great intellectual power,\r\nimmense range of knowledge, and the possessor of a lucid style rare\r\namong German writers, and becoming rarer everywhere, owing to the very\r\ninfluences which Nordau attacks with such unsparing energy, such eager\r\nhatred."--_London Chronicle_.\r\n\r\n"Let us say at once that the English-reading public should be grateful\r\nfor an English rendering of Max Nordau\'s polemic. It will provide\r\nsociety with a subject that may last as long as the present\r\ngovernment.... We read the pages without finding one dull, sometimes\r\nin reluctant agreement, sometimes with amused contempt, sometimes with\r\nangry indignation."--_London Saturday Review_.\r\n\r\n"Herr Nordau\'s book fills a void, not merely in the systems of\r\nLombroso, as he says, but in all existing systems of English and\r\nAmerican criticism with which we are acquainted. It is not literary\r\ncriticism pure and simple, though it is not lacking in literary\r\nqualities of a high order, but it is something which has long been\r\nneeded, for of literary criticism, so called, good, bad, and\r\nindifferent, there is always an abundance: but it is scientific\r\ncriticism--the penetration to and the interpretation of the spirit\r\nwithin the letter, the apprehension of motives as well as means and\r\nthe comprehension of temporal effects as well as final results, its\r\nexplanation, classification, and largely condemnation, for it is not a\r\nhealthy condition which he has studied, but its absence, its loss; it\r\nis degeneration.... He has written a great book, which every\r\nthoughtful lover of art and literature and every serious student of\r\nsociology and morality should read carefully and ponder slowly and\r\nwisely."--_Richard Henry Stoddard in the Mail and Express_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nD. APPLETON AND COMPANY\'S PUBLICATIONS\r\n\r\n_EVOLUTION OF MAN AND CHRISTIANITY._\r\n\r\nNew edition. By the Rev. HOWARD MACQUEARY. With a new Preface, in\r\nwhich the Author answers his Critics, and with some important\r\nAdditions. 12mo. Cloth, $1.75.\r\n\r\n"This is a revised and enlarged edition of a book published last year.\r\nThe author reviews criticisms upon the first edition, denies that he\r\nrejects the doctrine of the incarnation, admits his doubts of the\r\nphysical resurrection of Christ, and his belief in evolution. The\r\nvolume is to be marked as one of the most profound expressions of the\r\nmodern movement toward broader theological positions."--_Brooklyn\r\nTimes_.\r\n\r\n_HISTORY OF THE CONFLICT BETWEEN RELIGION AND SCIENCE._ By Dr. JOHN\r\nWILLIAM DRAPER. 12mo, Cloth, $1.75.\r\n\r\n"The keynote to this volume is found in the antagonism between the\r\nprogressive tendencies of the human mind and the pretensions of\r\necclesiastical authority, as developed in the history of modern\r\nscience. No previous writer has treated the subject from this point of\r\nview, and the present monograph will be found to possess no less\r\noriginality of conception than vigor of reasoning and wealth of\r\nerudition."--_New York Tribune_.\r\n\r\n_A CRITICAL HISTORY OF FREE THOUGHT IN REFERENCE TO THE CHRISTIAN\r\nRELIGION._ By Rev. Canon ADAM STOREY FARRAR, D. D., F. R. S., etc.\r\n12mo. Cloth, $1.50.\r\n\r\n"A conflict might naturally be anticipated between the reasoning\r\nfaculties of man and a religion which claims the right, on superhuman\r\nauthority, to impose limits on the field or manner of their exercise.\r\nIt is the chief of the movements of free thought which it is my\r\npurpose to describe, in their historic succession and their connection\r\nwith intellectual causes. We must ascertain the facts, discover the\r\ncauses, and read the moral."--_The Author._\r\n\r\n_CREATION OR EVOLUTION? A Philosophical Inquiry._ By GEORGE TICKNOR\r\nCURTIS, 12mo. Cloth, $2.00.\r\n\r\n"A treatise on the great question of Creation or Evolution by one who\r\nis neither a naturalist nor theologian, and who does not profess to\r\nbring to the discussion a special equipment in either of the sciences\r\nwhich the controversy arrays against each other, may seem strange at\r\nfirst sight; but Mr. Curtis will satisfy the reader, before many pages\r\nhave been turned, that he has a substantial contribution to make to\r\nthe debate, and that his book is one to be treated with respect. His\r\npart is to apply to the reasonings of the men of science the rigid\r\nscrutiny with which the lawyer is accustomed to test the value and\r\npertinency of testimony, and the legitimacy of inferences from\r\nestablished facts."--_New York Tribune_.\r\n\r\n\r\nD.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
