Our first collection of _Poems Teachers\r\nAsk For_ was the response to a demand for such a book, and this present\r\nvolume is the response to a demand for "more." In Book One it was\r\nimpracticable to use all of the many poems entitled to inclusion on the\r\nbasis of their being desired. We are constantly in receipt of requests\r\nthat certain selections be printed in NORMAL INSTRUCTOR-PRIMARY PLANS on\r\nthe page "Poems Our Readers Have Asked For." More than two hundred of\r\nthese were chosen for Book One, and more than two hundred others, as\r\nmuch desired as those in the earlier volume, are included in Book Two.\r\n\r\nBecause of copyright restrictions, we often have been unable to present,\r\nin magazine form, verse of large popular appeal. By special arrangement,\r\na number of such poems were included in Book One of _Poems Teachers Ask\r\nFor_, and many more are given in the pages that follow.

Guest._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe House with Nobody In It\r\n\r\n\r\nWhenever I walk to Suffern along the Erie track\r\nI go by a poor old farm-house with its shingles broken and black;\r\nI suppose I\'ve passed it a hundred times, but I always stop for a minute\r\nAnd look at the house, the tragic house, the house with nobody in it.\r\n\r\nI\'ve never seen a haunted house, but I hear there are such things;\r\nThat they hold the talk of spirits, their mirth and sorrowings.\r\nI know that house isn\'t haunted and I wish it were, I do,\r\nFor it wouldn\'t be so lonely if it had a ghost or two.\r\n\r\nThis house on the road to Suffern needs a dozen panes of glass,\r\nAnd somebody ought to weed the walk and take a scythe to the grass.\r\nIt needs new paint and shingles and vines should be trimmed and tied,\r\nBut what it needs most of all is some people living inside.\r\n\r\nIf I had a bit of money and all my debts were paid,\r\nI\'d put a gang of men to work with brush and saw and spade.\r\nI\'d buy that place and fix it up the way that it used to be,\r\nAnd I\'d find some people who wanted a home and give it to them free.\r\n\r\nNow a new home standing empty with staring window and door\r\nLooks idle perhaps and foolish, like a hat on its block in the store,\r\nBut there\'s nothing mournful about it, it cannot be sad and lone\r\nFor the lack of something within it that it has never known.\r\n\r\nBut a house that has done what a house should do, a house that has\r\n      sheltered life,\r\nThat has put its loving wooden arms around a man and his wife,\r\nA house that has echoed a baby\'s laugh and helped up his stumbling feet,\r\nIs the saddest sight, when it\'s left alone, that ever your eyes could meet.\r\n\r\nSo whenever I go to Suffern along the Erie track\r\nI never go by the empty house without stopping and looking back,\r\nYet it hurts me to look at the crumbling roof and the shutters fallen\r\n      apart,\r\nFor I can\'t help thinking the poor old house is a house with a broken\r\n      heart.\r\n\r\n    _Joyce Kilmer._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nColor in the Wheat\r\n\r\n\r\nLike liquid gold the wheat field lies,\r\n  A marvel of yellow and russet and green,\r\nThat ripples and runs, that floats and flies,\r\n  With the subtle shadows, the change, the sheen,\r\n    That play in the golden hair of a girl,--\r\n      A ripple of amber--a flare\r\n    Of light sweeping after--a curl\r\n    In the hollows like swirling feet\r\n      Of fairy waltzers, the colors run\r\n      To the western sun\r\n    Through the deeps of the ripening wheat.\r\n\r\nBroad as the fleckless, soaring sky,\r\n  Mysterious, fair as the moon-led sea,\r\nThe vast plain flames on the dazzled eye\r\n  Under the fierce sun\'s alchemy.\r\n    The slow hawk stoops\r\n      To his prey in the deeps;\r\n    The sunflower droops\r\n      To the lazy wave; the wind sleeps--\r\n    Then swirling in dazzling links and loops,\r\n      A riot of shadow and shine,\r\n      A glory of olive and amber and wine,\r\n    To the westering sun the colors run\r\n    Through the deeps of the ripening wheat.\r\n\r\nO glorious land! My western land,\r\n  Outspread beneath the setting sun!\r\nOnce more amid your swells, I stand,\r\n  And cross your sod-lands dry and dun.\r\nI hear the jocund calls of men\r\n  Who sweep amid the ripened grain\r\nWith swift, stern reapers; once again\r\n  The evening splendor floods the plain,\r\n    The crickets\' chime\r\n    Makes pauseless rhyme,\r\n    And toward the sun,\r\n    The colors run\r\n    Before the wind\'s feet\r\n    In the wheat!\r\n\r\n    _Hamlin Garland._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Broken Pinion\r\n\r\n\r\nI walked through the woodland meadows,\r\n  Where sweet the thrushes sing;\r\nAnd I found on a bed of mosses\r\n  A bird with a broken wing.\r\nI healed its wound, and each morning\r\n  It sang its old sweet strain,\r\nBut the bird with a broken pinion\r\n  Never soared as high again.\r\n\r\nI found a young life broken\r\n  By sin\'s seductive art;\r\nAnd touched with a Christlike pity,\r\n  I took him to my heart.\r\nHe lived with a noble purpose\r\n  And struggled not in vain;\r\nBut the life that sin had stricken\r\n  Never soared as high again.\r\n\r\nBut the bird with a broken pinion\r\n  Kept another from the snare;\r\nAnd the life that sin had stricken\r\n  Raised another from despair.\r\nEach loss has its compensation,\r\n  There is healing for every pain;\r\nBut the bird with a broken pinion\r\n  Never soars as high again.\r\n\r\n    _Hezekiah Butterworth._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJamie Douglas\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was in the days when Claverhouse\r\n  Was scouring moor and glen,\r\nTo change, with fire and bloody sword,\r\n  The faith of Scottish men.\r\n\r\nThey had made a covenant with the Lord\r\n  Firm in their faith to bide,\r\nNor break to Him their plighted word,\r\n  Whatever might betide.\r\n\r\nThe sun was well-nigh setting,\r\n  When o\'er the heather wild,\r\nAnd up the narrow mountain-path,\r\n  Alone there walked a child.\r\n\r\nHe was a bonny, blithesome lad,\r\n  Sturdy and strong of limb--\r\nA father\'s pride, a mother\'s love,\r\n  Were fast bound up in him.\r\n\r\nHis bright blue eyes glanced fearless round,\r\n  His step was firm and light;\r\nWhat was it underneath his plaid\r\n  His little hands grasped tight?\r\n\r\nIt was bannocks which, that very morn,\r\n  His mother made with care.\r\nFrom out her scanty store of meal;\r\n  And now, with many a prayer,\r\n\r\nHad sent by Jamie her ane boy,\r\n  A trusty lad and brave,\r\nTo good old Pastor Tammons Roy,\r\n  Now hid in yonder cave,\r\n\r\nAnd for whom the bloody Claverhouse\r\n  Had hunted long in vain,\r\nAnd swore they would not leave that glen\r\n  Till old Tam Roy was slain.\r\n\r\nSo Jamie Douglas went his way\r\n  With heart that knew no fear;\r\nHe turned the great curve in the rock,\r\n  Nor dreamed that death was near.\r\n\r\nAnd there were bloody Claverhouse men,\r\n  Who laughed aloud with glee,\r\nWhen trembling now within their power,\r\n  The frightened child they see.\r\n\r\nHe turns to flee, but all in vain,\r\n  They drag him back apace\r\nTo where their cruel leader stands,\r\n  And set them face to face.\r\n\r\nThe cakes concealed beneath his plaid\r\n  Soon tell the story plain--\r\n"It is old Tam Roy the cakes are for,"\r\n  Exclaimed the angry man.\r\n\r\n"Now guide me to his hiding place\r\n  And I will let you go."\r\nBut Jamie shook his yellow curls,\r\n  And stoutly answered--"No!"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll drop you down the mountain-side,\r\n  And there upon the stones\r\nThe old gaunt wolf and carrion crow\r\n  Shall battle for your bones."\r\n\r\nAnd in his brawny, strong right hand\r\n  He lifted up the child,\r\nAnd held him where the clefted rocks\r\n  Formed a chasm deep and wild\r\n\r\nSo deep it was, the trees below\r\n  Like stunted bushes seemed.\r\nPoor Jamie looked in frightened maze,\r\n  It seemed some horrid dream.\r\n\r\nHe looked up at the blue sky above\r\n  Then at the men near by;\r\nHad _they_ no little boys at home,\r\n  That they could let him die?\r\n\r\nBut no one spoke and no one stirred,\r\n  Or lifted hand to save\r\nFrom such a fearful, frightful death,\r\n  The little lad so brave.\r\n\r\n"It is woeful deep," he shuddering cried,\r\n  "But oh! I canna tell,\r\nSo drop me down then, if you will--\r\n  It is nae so deep as hell!"\r\n\r\nA childish scream, a faint, dull sound,\r\n  Oh! Jamie Douglas true,\r\nLong, long within that lonely cave\r\n  Shall Tam Roy wait for you.\r\n\r\nLong for your welcome coming\r\n  Waits the mother on the moor,\r\nAnd watches and calls, "Come, Jamie, lad,"\r\n  Through the half-open door.\r\n\r\nNo more adown the rocky path\r\n  You come with fearless tread,\r\nOr, on moor or mountain, take\r\n  The good man\'s daily bread.\r\n\r\nBut up in heaven the shining ones\r\n  A wondrous story tell,\r\nOf a child snatched up from a rocky gulf\r\n  That is nae so deep as hell.\r\n\r\nAnd there before the great white throne,\r\n  Forever blessed and glad,\r\nHis mother dear and old Tam Roy\r\n  Shall meet their bonny lad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ensign Bearer\r\n\r\n\r\nNever mind me, Uncle Jared, never mind my bleeding breast!\r\nThey are charging in the valley and you\'re needed with the rest.\r\nAll the day long from its dawning till you saw your kinsman fall,\r\nYou have answered fresh and fearless to our brave commander\'s call;\r\nAnd I would not rob my country of your gallant aid to-night,\r\nThough your presence and your pity stay my spirit in its flight.\r\n\r\nAll along that quivering column see the death steed trampling down\r\nMen whose deeds this day are worthy of a kingdom and a crown.\r\nPrithee hasten, Uncle Jared, what\'s the bullet in my breast\r\nTo that murderous storm of fire raining tortures on the rest?\r\nSee! the bayonets flash and falter--look! the foe begins to win;\r\nSee! oh, see our falling comrades! God! the ranks are closing in.\r\n\r\nHark! there\'s quickening in the distance and a thundering in the air,\r\nLike the roaring of a lion just emerging from his lair.\r\nThere\'s a cloud of something yonder fast unrolling like a scroll--\r\nQuick! oh, quick! if it be succor that can save the cause a soul!\r\nLook! a thousand thirsty bayonets are flashing down the vale,\r\nAnd a thousand thirsty riders dashing onward like a gale!\r\n\r\nRaise me higher, Uncle Jared, place the ensign in my hand!\r\nI am strong enough to float it while you cheer that flying band;\r\nLouder! louder! shout for Freedom with prolonged and vigorous breath--\r\nShout for Liberty and Union, and the victory over death!--\r\nSee! they catch the stirring numbers and they swell them to the breeze--\r\nCap and plume and starry banner waving proudly through the trees.\r\n\r\nMark our fainting comrades rally, see that drooping column rise!\r\nI can almost see the fire newly kindled in their eyes.\r\nFresh for conflict, nerved to conquer, see them charging on the foe--\r\nFace to face with deadly meaning--shot and shell and trusty blow.\r\nSee the thinned ranks wildly breaking--see them scatter to the sun--\r\nI can die, Uncle Jared, for the glorious day is won!\r\n\r\nBut there\'s something, something pressing with a numbness on my heart,\r\nAnd my lips with mortal dumbness fail the burden to impart.\r\nOh I tell you, Uncle Jared, there is something back of all\r\nThat a soldier cannot part with when he heeds his country\'s call!\r\nAsk the mother what, in dying, sends her yearning spirit back\r\nOver life\'s rough, broken marches, where she\'s pointed out the track.\r\n\r\nAsk the dear ones gathered nightly round the shining household hearth,\r\nWhat to them is dearer, better, than the brightest things of earth,\r\nAsk that dearer one whose loving, like a ceaseless vestal flame,\r\nSets my very soul a-glowing at the mention of her name;\r\nAsk her why the loved in dying feels her spirit linked with his\r\nIn a union death but strengthens, she will tell you what it is.\r\n\r\nAnd there\'s something, Uncle Jared, you may tell her if you will--\r\nThat the precious flag she gave me, I have kept unsullied still.\r\nAnd--this touch of pride forgive me--where death sought our gallant host--\r\nWhere our stricken lines were weakest, there it ever waved the most.\r\nBear it back and tell her fondly, brighter, purer, steadier far,\r\n\'Mid the crimson tide of battle, shone my life\'s fast setting star.\r\n\r\nBut forbear, dear Uncle Jared, when there\'s something more to tell,\r\nWhen her lips with rapid blanching bid you answer how I fell;\r\nTeach your tongue the trick of slighting, though \'tis faithful to the rest,\r\nLest it say her brother\'s bullet is the bullet in my breast;\r\nBut if it must be that she learn it despite your tenderest care,\r\n\'Twill soothe her bleeding heart to know my bayonet pricked the air.\r\n\r\nLife is ebbing, Uncle Jared, my enlistment endeth here;\r\nDeath, the Conqueror, has drafted--I can no more volunteer,--\r\nBut I hear the roll call yonder and I go with willing feet--\r\nThrough the shadows of the valley where victorious armies meet,\r\nRaise the ensign, Uncle Jared, let its dear folds o\'er me fall--\r\nStrength and Union for my country--and God\'s banner over all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Real Riches\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery coin of earthly treasure\r\n  We have lavished upon earth\r\nFor our simple worldly pleasure\r\n  May be reckoned something worth;\r\nFor the spending was not losing,\r\n  Tho\' the purchase were but small;\r\nIt has perished with the using.\r\n  We have had it,--that is all!\r\n\r\nAll the gold we leave behind us,\r\n  When we turn to dust again,\r\nTho\' our avarice may blind us,\r\n  We have gathered quite in vain;\r\nSince we neither can direct it,\r\n  By the winds of fortune tost,\r\nNor in other worlds expect it;\r\n  What we hoarded we have lost.\r\n\r\nBut each merciful oblation--\r\n  Seed of pity wisely sown,\r\nWhat we gave in self-negation,\r\n  We may safely call our own;\r\nFor the treasure freely given\r\n  Is the treasure that we hoard,\r\nSince the angels keep in heaven,\r\n  What is lent unto the Lord.\r\n\r\n    _John G. Saxe._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Polish Boy\r\n\r\n\r\nWhence come those shrieks so wild and shrill,\r\n  That cut, like blades of steel, the air,\r\nCausing the creeping blood to chill\r\n  With the sharp cadence of despair?\r\n\r\nAgain they come, as if a heart\r\n  Were cleft in twain by one quick blow,\r\nAnd every string had voice apart\r\n  To utter its peculiar woe.\r\n\r\nWhence came they? From yon temple, where\r\nAn altar, raised for private prayer,\r\nNow forms the warrior\'s marble bed\r\nWho Warsaw\'s gallant armies led.\r\n\r\nThe dim funereal tapers throw\r\nA holy luster o\'er his brow,\r\nAnd burnish with their rays of light\r\nThe mass of curls that gather bright\r\nAbove the haughty brow and eye\r\nOf a young boy that\'s kneeling by.\r\n\r\nWhat hand is that, whose icy press\r\n  Clings to the dead with death\'s own grasp,\r\nBut meets no answering caress?\r\n  No thrilling fingers seek its clasp.\r\nIt is the hand of her whose cry\r\n  Rang wildly, late, upon the air,\r\nWhen the dead warrior met her eye\r\n  Outstretched upon the altar there.\r\n\r\nWith pallid lip and stony brow\r\nShe murmurs forth her anguish now.\r\nBut hark! the tramp of heavy feet\r\nIs heard along the bloody street;\r\nNearer and nearer yet they come,\r\nWith clanking arms and noiseless drum.\r\nNow whispered curses, low and deep,\r\nAround the holy temple creep;\r\nThe gate is burst; a ruffian band\r\nRush in, and savagely demand,\r\nWith brutal voice and oath profane,\r\nThe startled boy for exile\'s chain.\r\n\r\nThe mother sprang with gesture wild,\r\nAnd to her bosom clasped her child;\r\nThen, with pale cheek and flashing eye,\r\nShouted with fearful energy,\r\n"Back, ruffians, back! nor dare to tread\r\nToo near the body of my dead;\r\nNor touch the living boy; I stand\r\nBetween him and your lawless band.\r\nTake _me_, and bind these arms--these hands,--\r\nWith Russia\'s heaviest iron bands,\r\nAnd drag me to Siberia\'s wild\r\nTo perish, if \'twill save my child!"\r\n\r\n"Peace, woman, peace!" the leader cried,\r\nTearing the pale boy from her side,\r\nAnd in his ruffian grasp he bore\r\nHis victim to the temple door.\r\n"One moment!" shrieked the mother; "one!\r\nWill land or gold redeem my son?\r\nTake heritage, take name, take all,\r\nBut leave him free from Russian thrall!\r\nTake these!" and her white arms and hands\r\nShe stripped of rings and diamond bands,\r\nAnd tore from braids of long black hair\r\nThe gems that gleamed like starlight there;\r\nHer cross of blazing rubies, last,\r\nDown at the Russian\'s feet she cast.\r\nHe stooped to seize the glittering store;--\r\nUp springing from the marble floor,\r\nThe mother, with a cry of joy,\r\nSnatched to her leaping heart the boy.\r\nBut no! the Russian\'s iron grasp\r\nAgain undid the mother\'s clasp.\r\nForward she fell, with one long cry\r\nOf more than mortal agony.\r\n\r\nBut the brave child is roused at length,\r\n  And, breaking from the Russian\'s hold,\r\nHe stands, a giant in the strength\r\n  Of his young spirit, fierce and bold.\r\nProudly he towers; his flashing eye,\r\n  So blue, and yet so bright,\r\nSeems kindled from the eternal sky,\r\n  So brilliant is its light.\r\n\r\nHis curling lips and crimson cheeks\r\nForetell the thought before he speaks;\r\nWith a full voice of proud command\r\nHe turned upon the wondering band.\r\n\r\n"Ye hold me not! no! no, nor can;\r\nThis hour has made the boy a man.\r\nI knelt before my slaughtered sire,\r\nNor felt one throb of vengeful ire.\r\nI wept upon his marble brow,\r\nYes, wept! I was a child; but now\r\nMy noble mother, on her knee,\r\nHath done the work of years for me!"\r\n\r\nHe drew aside his broidered vest,\r\nAnd there, like slumbering serpent\'s crest,\r\nThe jeweled haft of poniard bright\r\nGlittered a moment on the sight.\r\n"Ha! start ye back? Fool! coward! knave!\r\nThink ye my noble father\'s glaive\r\nWould drink the life-blood of a slave?\r\nThe pearls that on the handle flame\r\nWould blush to rubies in their shame;\r\nThe blade would quiver in thy breast\r\nAshamed of such ignoble rest.\r\nNo! thus I rend the tyrant\'s chain,\r\nAnd fling him back a boy\'s disdain!"\r\n\r\nA moment, and the funeral light\r\nFlashed on the jeweled weapon bright;\r\nAnother, and his young heart\'s blood\r\nLeaped to the floor, a crimson flood.\r\nQuick to his mother\'s side he sprang,\r\nAnd on the air his clear voice rang:\r\n"Up, mother, up! I\'m free! I\'m free!\r\nThe choice was death or slavery.\r\nUp, mother, up! Look on thy son!\r\nHis freedom is forever won;\r\nAnd now he waits one holy kiss\r\nTo bear his father home in bliss;\r\nOne last embrace, one blessing,--one!\r\nTo prove thou knowest, approvest thy son.\r\nWhat! silent yet? Canst thou not feel\r\nMy warm blood o\'er thy heart congeal?\r\nSpeak, mother, speak! lift up thy head!\r\nWhat! silent still? Then art thou dead:\r\n--Great God, I thank thee! Mother, I\r\nRejoice with thee,--and thus--to die."\r\nOne long, deep breath, and his pale head\r\nLay on his mother\'s bosom,--dead.\r\n\r\n    _Ann S. Stephens._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Height of the Ridiculous\r\n\r\n\r\nI wrote some lines once on a time\r\n  In wondrous merry mood,\r\nAnd thought, as usual, men would say\r\n  They were exceeding good.\r\n\r\nThey were so queer, so very queer,\r\n  I laughed as I would die;\r\nAlbeit, in the general way,\r\n  A sober man am I.\r\n\r\nI called my servant, and he came;\r\n  How kind it was of him\r\nTo mind a slender man like me,\r\n  He of the mighty limb!\r\n\r\n"These to the printer," I exclaimed,\r\n  And, in my humorous way,\r\nI added (as a trifling jest),\r\n  "There\'ll be the devil to pay."\r\n\r\nHe took the paper, and I watched,\r\n  And saw him peep within;\r\nAt the first line he read, his face\r\n  Was all upon the grin.\r\n\r\nHe read the next; the grin grew broad,\r\n  And shot from ear to ear;\r\nHe read the third; a chuckling noise\r\n  I now began to hear.\r\n\r\nThe fourth; he broke into a roar;\r\n  The fifth; his waistband split;\r\nThe sixth; he burst five buttons off,\r\n  And tumbled in a fit.\r\n\r\nTen days and nights, with sleepless eye,\r\n  I watched that wretched man,\r\nAnd since, I never dare to write\r\n  As funny as I can.\r\n\r\n    _Oliver Wendell Holmes._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExcelsior\r\n\r\n\r\nThe shades of night were falling fast,\r\nAs through an Alpine village passed\r\nA youth, who bore, \'mid snow and ice,\r\nA banner with the strange device,\r\n      Excelsior!\r\n\r\nHis brow was sad his eye beneath\r\nFlashed like a falchion from its sheath,\r\nAnd like a silver clarion rung\r\nThe accents of that unknown tongue,\r\n      Excelsior!\r\n\r\nIn happy homes he saw the light\r\nOf household fires gleam warm and bright;\r\nAbove, the spectral glaciers shone,\r\nAnd from his lips escaped a groan,\r\n      Excelsior!\r\n\r\n"Try not the Pass!" the old man said;\r\n"Dark lowers the tempest overhead,\r\nThe roaring torrent is deep and wide!"\r\nAnd loud the clarion voice replied,\r\n      Excelsior!\r\n\r\n"O stay," the maiden said, "and rest\r\nThy weary head upon this breast!"\r\nA tear stood in his bright blue eye,\r\nBut still he answered, with a sigh,\r\n      Excelsior!\r\n\r\n"Beware the pine-tree\'s withered branch!\r\nBeware the awful avalanche!"\r\nThis was the peasant\'s last Good-night,\r\nA voice replied, far up the height,\r\n      Excelsior!\r\n\r\nAt break of day, as heavenward\r\nThe pious monks of Saint Bernard\r\nUttered the oft-repeated prayer,\r\nA voice cried through the startled air,\r\n      Excelsior!\r\n\r\nA traveller, by the faithful hound,\r\nHalf-buried in the snow was found,\r\nStill grasping in his hand of ice\r\nThat banner with the strange device,\r\n      Excelsior!\r\n\r\nThere in the twilight cold and gray,\r\nLifeless, but beautiful, he lay,\r\nAnd from the sky, serene and far,\r\nA voice fell, like a falling star,\r\n      Excelsior!\r\n\r\n    _Henry W.

McCarthy._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTrouble In the "Amen Corner"\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Twas a stylish congregation, that of Theophrastus Brown,\r\nAnd its organ was the finest and the biggest in the town,\r\nAnd the chorus--all the papers favorably commented on it,\r\nFor \'twas said each female member had a forty-dollar bonnet.\r\n\r\nNow in the "amen corner" of the church sat Brother Eyer,\r\nWho persisted every Sabbath-day in singing with the choir;\r\nHe was poor but genteel-looking, and his heart as snow was white,\r\nAnd his old face beamed with sweetness when he sang with all his might.\r\n\r\nHis voice was cracked and broken, age had touched his vocal chords,\r\nAnd nearly every Sunday he would mispronounce the words\r\nOf the hymns, and \'twas no wonder, he was old and nearly blind,\r\nAnd the choir rattling onward always left him far behind.\r\n\r\nThe chorus stormed and blustered, Brother Eyer sang too slow,\r\nAnd then he used the tunes in vogue a hundred years ago;\r\nAt last the storm-cloud burst, and the  church was told, in fine,\r\nThat the brother must stop singing, or the choir would resign.\r\n\r\nThen the pastor called together in the vestry-room one day\r\nSeven influential members who subscribe more than they pay,\r\nAnd having asked God\'s guidance in a printed pray\'r or two,\r\nThey put their heads together to determine what to do.\r\n\r\nThey debated, thought, suggested, till at last "dear Brother York,"\r\nWho last winter made a million on a sudden rise in pork,\r\nRose and moved that a committee wait at once on Brother Eyer,\r\nAnd proceed to rake him lively "for disturbin\' of the choir."\r\n\r\nSaid he: "In that \'ere organ I\'ve invested quite a pile,\r\nAnd we\'ll sell it if we cannot worship in the latest style;\r\nOur Philadelphy tenor tells me \'tis the hardest thing\r\nFer to make God understand him when the brother tries to sing.\r\n\r\n"We\'ve got the biggest organ, the best-dressed choir in town,\r\nWe pay the steepest sal\'ry to our pastor, Brother Brown;\r\nBut if we must humor ignorance because it\'s blind and old--\r\nIf the choir\'s to be pestered, I will seek another fold."\r\n\r\nOf course the motion carried, and one day a coach and four,\r\nWith the latest style of driver, rattled up to Eyer\'s door;\r\nAnd the sleek, well-dress\'d committee, Brothers Sharkey, York and Lamb,\r\nAs they crossed the humble portal took good care to miss the jamb.\r\n\r\nThey found the choir\'s great trouble sitting in his old arm chair,\r\nAnd the Summer\'s golden sunbeams lay upon his thin white hair;\r\nHe was singing "Rock of Ages" in a cracked voice and low\r\nBut the angels understood him, \'twas all he cared to know.\r\n\r\nSaid York: "We\'re here, dear brother, with the vestry\'s approbation\r\nTo discuss a little matter that affects the congregation";\r\n"And the choir, too," said Sharkey, giving Brother York a nudge,\r\n"And the choir, too!" he echoed with the graveness of a judge.\r\n\r\n"It was the understanding when we bargained for the chorus\r\nThat it was to relieve us, that is, do the singing for us;\r\nIf we rupture the agreement, it is very plain, dear brother,\r\nIt will leave our congregation and be gobbled by another.\r\n\r\n"We don\'t want any singing except that what we\'ve bought!\r\nThe latest tunes are all the rage; the old ones stand for naught;\r\nAnd so we have decided--are you list\'ning, Brother Eyer?--\r\nThat you\'ll have to stop your singin\' for it flurrytates the choir."\r\n\r\nThe old man slowly raised his head, a sign that he did hear,\r\nAnd on his cheek the trio caught the glitter of a tear;\r\nHis feeble hands pushed back the locks white as the silky snow,\r\nAs he answered the committee in a voice both sweet and low:\r\n\r\n"I\'ve sung the psalms of David nearly eighty years," said he;\r\n"They\'ve been my staff and comfort all along life\'s dreary way;\r\nI\'m sorry I disturb the choir, perhaps I\'m doing wrong;\r\nBut when my heart is filled with praise, I can\'t keep back a song.\r\n\r\n"I wonder if beyond the tide that\'s breaking at my feet,\r\nIn the far-off heav\'nly temple, where the Master I shall greet--\r\nYes, I wonder when I try to sing the songs of God up high\'r,\r\nIf the angel band will church me for disturbing heaven\'s choir."\r\n\r\nA silence filled the little room; the old man bowed his head;\r\nThe carriage rattled on again, but Brother Eyer was dead!\r\nYes, dead! his hand had raised the veil the future hangs before us,\r\nAnd the Master dear had called him to the everlasting chorus.\r\n\r\nThe choir missed him for a while, but he was soon forgot,\r\nA few church-goers watched the door; the old man entered not.\r\nFar away, his voice no longer cracked, he sang his heart\'s desires,\r\nWhere there are no church committees and no fashionable choirs!\r\n\r\n    _T.C. Harbaugh._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDuty\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sweetest lives are those to duty wed,\r\nWhose deeds, both great and small,\r\nAre close knit strands of an unbroken thread,\r\nWhose love ennobles all.\r\nThe world may sound no trumpet, ring no bells;\r\nThe book of life, the shining record tells.\r\nThy love shall chant its own beatitudes,\r\nAfter its own life-working. A child\'s kiss\r\nSet on thy singing lips shall make thee glad;\r\nA poor man served by thee shall make thee rich;\r\nA sick man helped by thee shall make thee strong;\r\nThou shalt be served thyself by every sense\r\nOf service thou renderest.\r\n\r\n    _Robert Browning._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Last Leaf\r\n\r\n\r\nI saw him once before,\r\nAs he passed by the door,\r\n    And again\r\nThe pavement stones resound,\r\nAs he totters o\'er the ground\r\n    With his cane.\r\n\r\nThey say that in his prime,\r\nEre the pruning-knife of Time\r\n    Cut him down,\r\nNot a better man was found\r\nBy the Crier on his round\r\n    Through the town.\r\n\r\nBut now he walks the streets,\r\nAnd he looks at all he meets\r\n    Sad and wan,\r\nAnd he shakes his feeble head,\r\nThat it seems as if he said\r\n    "They are gone."\r\n\r\nThe mossy marbles rest\r\nOn the lips that he has prest\r\n    In their bloom,\r\nAnd the names he loved to hear\r\nHave been carved for many a year\r\n    On the tomb.\r\n\r\nMy grandmamma has said,--\r\nPoor old lady, she is dead\r\n    Long ago,--\r\nThat he had a Roman nose,\r\nAnd his cheek was like a rose\r\n    In the snow.\r\n\r\nBut now his nose is thin,\r\nAnd it rests upon his chin.\r\n    Like a staff,\r\nAnd a crook is in his back,\r\nAnd a melancholy crack\r\n    In his laugh.\r\n\r\nI know it is a sin\r\nFor me to sit and grin\r\n    At him here;\r\nBut the old three-cornered hat,\r\nAnd the breeches, and all that,\r\n    Are so queer!\r\n\r\nAnd if I should live to be\r\nThe last leaf upon the tree\r\n    In the spring,\r\nLet them smile, as I do now,\r\nAt the old forsaken bough\r\n    Where I cling.\r\n\r\n    _Oliver Wendell Holmes._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOld Flag Forever\r\n\r\n\r\nShe\'s up there--Old Glory--where lightnings are sped;\r\nShe dazzles the nations with ripples of red;\r\nAnd she\'ll wave for us living, or droop o\'er us dead,--\r\nThe flag of our country forever!\r\n\r\nShe\'s up there--Old Glory--how bright the stars stream!\r\nAnd the stripes like red signals of liberty gleam!\r\nAnd we dare for her, living, or dream the last dream,\r\n\'Neath the flag of our country forever!\r\n\r\nShe\'s up there--Old Glory--no tyrant-dealt scars,\r\nNo blur on her brightness, no stain on her stars!\r\nThe brave blood of heroes hath crimsoned her bars.\r\nShe\'s the flag of our country forever!\r\n\r\n    _Frank L. Stanton._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Death of the Flowers\r\n\r\n\r\nThe melancholy days are come, the saddest of the year,\r\nOf wailing winds, and naked woods, and meadows brown and sear.\r\nHeaped in the hollows of the grove, the withered leaves lie dead;\r\nThey rustle to the eddying gust, and to the rabbit\'s tread.\r\nThe robin and the wren are flown, and from the shrub the jay,\r\nAnd from the wood-top calls the crow, through all the gloomy day.\r\n\r\nWhere are the flowers, the fair young flowers, that lately sprang and stood\r\nIn brighter light and softer airs, a beauteous sisterhood?\r\nAlas! they all are in their graves; the gentle race of flowers\r\nAre lying in their lowly beds, with the fair and good of ours.\r\nThe rain is falling where they lie; but the cold November rain\r\nCalls not from out the gloomy earth the lovely ones again.\r\n\r\nThe wind-flower and the violet, they perished long ago,\r\nAnd the brier-rose and the orchis died amid the summer glow;\r\nBut on the hill the golden-rod, and the aster in the wood,\r\nAnd the yellow sun-flower by the brook, in autumn beauty stood,\r\nTill fell the frost from the clear cold heaven, as falls the plague on men,\r\nAnd the brightness of their smile was gone from upland, glade and glen.\r\n\r\nAnd now, when comes the calm, mild day, as still such days will come,\r\nTo call the squirrel and the bee from out their winter home,\r\nWhen the sound of dropping nuts is heard, though all the trees are still,\r\nAnd twinkle in the smoky light the waters of the rill,\r\nThe south wind searches for the flowers, whose fragrance late he bore,\r\nAnd sighs to find them in the wood and by the stream no more.\r\n\r\nAnd then I think of one who in her youthful beauty died,\r\nThe fair, meek blossom that grew up and faded by my side,\r\nIn the cold, moist earth we laid her when the forest cast the leaf,\r\nAnd we wept that one so lovely should have a life so brief;\r\nYet not unmeet it was that one, like that young friend of ours,\r\nSo gentle and so beautiful, should perish with the flowers.\r\n\r\n    _W.C. Bryant._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Heritage\r\n\r\n\r\nThe rich man\'s son inherits lands,\r\n  And piles of brick, and stone, and gold,\r\nAnd he inherits soft white hands,\r\n  And tender flesh that fears the cold,\r\n  Nor dares to wear a garment old;\r\nA heritage, it seems to me,\r\nOne scarce would wish to hold in fee.\r\n\r\nThe rich man\'s son inherits cares;\r\n  The bank may break, the factory burn,\r\nA breath may burst his bubble shares,\r\n  And soft white hands could hardly earn\r\n  A living that would serve his turn;\r\nA heritage, it seems to me,\r\nOne scarce would wish to hold in fee.\r\n\r\nThe rich man\'s son inherits wants,\r\n  His stomach craves for dainty fare;\r\nWith sated heart, he hears the pants\r\n  Of toiling hinds with brown arms bare,\r\n  And wearies in his easy-chair;\r\nA heritage, it seems to me,\r\nOne scarce would wish to hold in fee.\r\n\r\nWhat doth the poor man\'s son inherit?\r\n  Stout muscles and a sinewy heart,\r\nA hardy frame, a hardier spirit;\r\n  King of two hands, he does his part\r\n  In every useful toil and art;\r\nA heritage, it seems to me,\r\nA king might wish to hold in fee.\r\n\r\nWhat doth the poor man\'s son inherit?\r\n  Wishes o\'erjoyed with humble things,\r\nA rank, adjudged by toil-won merit,\r\n  Content that from employment springs,\r\n  A heart that in his labor sings;\r\nA heritage, it seems to me,\r\nA king might wish to hold in fee.\r\n\r\nWhat doth the poor man\'s son inherit?\r\n  A patience learned of being poor,\r\nCourage, if sorrow come, to bear it,\r\n  A fellow-feeling that is sure\r\n  To make the outcast bless his door;\r\nA heritage, it seems to me,\r\nA king might wish to hold in fee.\r\n\r\nO rich man\'s son! there is a toil\r\n  That with all others level stands;\r\nLarge charity doth never soil,\r\nBut only whiten, soft white hands,--\r\n  This is the best crop from thy lands;\r\nA heritage it seems to me,\r\nWorth being rich to hold in fee.\r\n\r\nO poor man\'s son! scorn not thy state;\r\n  There is worse weariness than thine,\r\nIn merely being rich and great;\r\n  Toil only gives the soul to shine\r\n  And makes rest fragrant and benign;\r\nA heritage, it seems to me,\r\nWorth being poor to hold in fee.\r\n\r\nBoth heirs to some six feet of sod,\r\n  Are equal in the earth at last;\r\nBoth, children of the same dear God,\r\n  Prove title to your heirship vast\r\n  By record of a well-filled past;\r\nA heritage, it seems to me,\r\nWell worth a life to hold in fee.\r\n\r\n    _James Russell Lowell._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ballad of East and West\r\n\r\n\r\nOh, East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet,\r\nTill Earth and Sky stand presently at God\'s great Judgment Seat;\r\nBut there is neither East nor West, Border, nor Breed, nor Birth,\r\nWhen two strong men stand face to face, tho\' they come from the ends\r\n      of the earth!\r\n\r\nKamal is out with twenty men to raise the Border side,\r\nAnd he has lifted the Colonel\'s mare that is the Colonel\'s pride:\r\nHe has lifted her out of the stable-door between the dawn and the day,\r\nAnd turned the calkins upon her feet, and ridden her far away.\r\nThen up and spoke the Colonel\'s son that led a troop of the Guides:\r\n"Is there never a man of all my men can say where Kamal hides?"\r\nThen up and spoke Mahommed Khan, the son of the Ressaldar,\r\n"If ye know the track of the morning-mist, ye know where his pickets are.\r\nAt dust he harries the Abazai--at dawn he is into Bonair,\r\nBut he must go by Fort Bukloh to his own place to fare,\r\nSo if ye gallop to Fort Bukloh as fast as a bird can fly,\r\nBy the favor of God ye may cut him off ere he win to the Tongue of Jagai,\r\nBut if he be passed the Tongue of Jagai, right swiftly turn ye then,\r\nFor the length and the breadth of that grisly plain is sown with Kamal\'s\r\n      men.\r\nThere is rock to the left, and rock to the right, and low lean thorn\r\n      between,\r\nAnd ye may hear a breech-bolt snick where never a man is seen."\r\nThe Colonel\'s son has taken a horse, and a raw rough dun was he,\r\nWith the mouth of a bell and the heart of Hell, and the head of the\r\n      gallows-tree.\r\nThe Colonel\'s son to the Fort has won, they bid him stay to eat--\r\nWho rides at the tail of a Border thief, he sits not long at his meat.\r\nHe\'s up and away from Fort Bukloh as fast as he can fly,\r\nTill he was aware of his father\'s mare in the gut of the Tongue of Jagai,\r\nTill he was aware of his father\'s mare with Kamal upon her back,\r\nAnd when he could spy the white of her eye, he made the pistol crack.\r\nHe has fired once, he has fired twice, but the whistling ball went wide.\r\n"Ye shoot like a soldier," Kamal said. "Show now if ye can ride."\r\nIt\'s up and over the Tongue of Jagai, as blown dust-devils go,\r\nThe dun he fled like a stag of ten, but the mare like a barren doe.\r\nThe dun he leaned against the bit and slugged his head above,\r\nBut the red mare played with the snaffle-bars, as a maiden plays with a\r\n      glove.\r\nThere was rock to the left and rock to the right, and low lean thorn\r\n      between,\r\nAnd thrice he heard a breech-bolt snick tho\' never a man was seen.\r\nThey have ridden the low moon out of the sky, their hoofs drum up the dawn,\r\nThe dun he went like a wounded bull, but the mare like a new-roused fawn.\r\nThe dun he fell at a water-course--in a woful heap fell he,\r\nAnd Kamal has turned the red mare back, and pulled the rider free.\r\nHe has knocked the pistol out of his hand--small room was there to strive,\r\n"\'Twas only by favor of mine," quoth he, "ye rode so long alive:\r\nThere was not a rock of twenty mile, there was not a clump of tree,\r\nBut covered a man of my own men with his rifle cocked on his knee.\r\nIf I had raised my bridle-hand, as I have held it low,\r\nThe little jackals that flee so fast, were feasting all in a row:\r\nIf I had bowed my head on my breast, as I have held it high,\r\nThe kite that whistles above us now were gorged till she could not fly."\r\nLightly answered the Colonel\'s son: "Do good to bird and beast,\r\nBut count who come for the broken meats before thou makest a feast.\r\nIf there should follow a thousand swords to carry my bones away,\r\nBelike the price of a jackal\'s meal were more than a thief could pay.\r\nThey will feed their horse on the standing crop, their men on the garnered\r\n      grain,\r\nThe thatch of the byres will serve their fires when all the cattle are\r\n      slain.\r\nBut if thou thinkest the price be fair,--thy brethren wait to sup.\r\nThe hound is kin to the jackal-spawn, howl, dog, and call them up!\r\nAnd if thou thinkest the price be high, in steer and gear and stack,\r\nGive me my father\'s mare again, and I\'ll fight my own way back!"\r\nKamal has gripped him by the hand and set him upon his feet.\r\n"No talk shall be of dogs," said he, "when wolf and gray wolf meet.\r\nMay I eat dirt if thou hast hurt of me in deed or breath;\r\nWhat dam of lances brought thee forth to jest at the dawn with Death?"\r\nLightly answered the Colonel\'s son: "I hold by the blood of my clan:\r\nTake up the mare of my father\'s gift--by God, she has carried a man!"\r\nThe red mare ran to the Colonel\'s son, and nuzzled against his breast,\r\n"We be two strong men," said Kamal then, "but she loveth the younger best.\r\nSo she shall go with a lifter\'s dower, my turquoise-studded rein,\r\nMy broidered saddle and saddle-cloth, and silver stirrups twain."\r\nThe Colonel\'s son a pistol drew and held it muzzle-end,\r\n"Ye have taken the one from a foe," said he; "will ye take the mate from\r\n      a friend?"\r\n"A gift for a gift," said Kamal straight; "a limb for the risk of a limb.\r\nThy father has sent his son to me, I\'ll send my son to him!"\r\nWith that he whistled his only son, that dropped from a mountain-crest--\r\nHe trod the ling like a buck in spring, and he looked like a lance in rest.\r\n"Now here is thy master," Kamal said, "who leads a troop of the Guides,\r\nAnd thou must ride at his left side as shield on shoulder rides.\r\nTill Death or I cut loose the tie, at camp and board and bed,\r\nThy life is his--thy fate is to guard him with thy head.\r\nSo thou must eat the White Queen\'s meat, and all her foes are thine,\r\nAnd thou must harry thy father\'s hold for the peace of the Border-line,\r\nAnd thou must make a trooper tough and hack thy way to power--\r\nBelike they will raise thee to Ressaldar when I am hanged in Peshawur."\r\nThey have looked each other between the eyes, and there they found no\r\n      fault,\r\nThey have taken the Oath of the Brother-in-Blood on leavened bread and\r\n      salt:\r\nThey have taken the Oath of the Brother-in-Blood  on fire and fresh-cut\r\n      sod,\r\nOn the hilt and the haft of the Khyber knife, and the wondrous Names of\r\n      God.\r\nThe Colonel\'s son he rides the mare and Kamal\'s boy the dun,\r\nAnd two have come back to Fort Bukloh where there went forth but one.\r\nAnd when they drew to the Quarter-Guard, full twenty swords flew clear--\r\nThere was not a man but carried his feud with the blood of the mountaineer.\r\n"Ha\' done! ha\' done!" said the Colonel\'s son. "Put up the steel at your\r\n      sides!\r\nLast night ye had struck at a Border thief--to-night \'tis a man of the\r\n      Guides!"\r\n\r\nOh, East is East, and West is West, and never the two shall meet,\r\nTill Earth and Sky stand presently at God\'s great Judgment Seat;\r\nBut there is neither East nor West, Border, nor Breed, nor Birth,\r\nWhen two strong men stand face to face, tho\' they come from the ends\r\n      of the earth.\r\n\r\n    _Rudyard Kipling._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnabel Lee\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was many and many a year ago,\r\n  In a kingdom by the sea,\r\nThat a maiden there lived whom you may know\r\n  By the name of Annabel Lee;\r\nAnd this maiden she lived with no other thought\r\n  Than to love and be loved by me.\r\n\r\nI was a child, and she was a child,\r\n  In this kingdom by the sea,\r\nBut we loved with a love that was more than love,\r\n  I and my Annabel Lee;\r\nWith a love that the winged seraphs of heaven\r\n  Coveted her and me.\r\n\r\nAnd this was the reason that, long ago,\r\n  In this kingdom by the sea,\r\nA wind blew out of a cloud, chilling\r\n  My beautiful Annabel Lee;\r\nSo that her highborn kinsmen came\r\n  And bore her away from me,\r\nTo shut her up in a sepulchre\r\n  In this kingdom by the sea.\r\n\r\nThe angels, not half so happy in heaven,\r\n  Went envying her and me;\r\nYes! that was the reason (as all men know,\r\n  In this kingdom by the sea)\r\nThat the wind came out of the cloud by night,\r\n  Chilling and killing my Annabel Lee.\r\n\r\nBut our love it was stronger by far than the love\r\n  Of those who were older than we,\r\n  Of many far wiser than we;\r\nAnd neither the angels in heaven above,\r\n  Nor the demons down under the sea,\r\nCan ever dissever my soul from the soul\r\n  Of the beautiful Annabel Lee:\r\n\r\nFor the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams\r\n  Of the beautiful Annabel Lee;\r\nAnd the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes\r\n  Of the beautiful Annabel Lee:\r\nAnd so all the night-tide, I lie down by the side\r\nOf my darling--my darling--my life and my bride,\r\n  In her sepulchre there by the sea,\r\n  In her tomb by the sounding sea.\r\n\r\n    _Edgar Allan Poe._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApril Showers\r\n\r\n\r\nThere fell an April shower, one night:\r\n  Next morning, in the garden-bed,\r\nThe crocuses stood straight and gold:\r\n  "And they have come," the children said.\r\n\r\nThere fell an April shower, one night:\r\n  Next morning, thro\' the woodland spread\r\nThe Mayflowers, pink and sweet as youth:\r\n  "And they are come," the children said.\r\n\r\nThere fell an April shower, one night:\r\n  Next morning, sweetly, overhead,\r\nThe blue-birds sung, the blue-birds sung:\r\n  "And they have come," the children said.\r\n\r\n    _Mary E. Wilkins._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Voice of Spring\r\n\r\n\r\nI come, I come! ye have called me long;\r\nI come o\'er the mountains, with light and song;\r\nYe may trace my step o\'er the waking earth\r\nBy the winds which tell of the violet\'s birth,\r\nBy the primrose stars in the shadowy grass,\r\nBy the green leaves opening as I pass.\r\n\r\nI have breathed on the South, and the chestnut flowers\r\nBy thousands have burst from the forest bowers,\r\nAnd the ancient graves and the fallen fanes\r\nAre veiled with wreaths as Italian plains;\r\nBut it is not for me, in my hour of bloom,\r\nTo speak of the ruin or the tomb!\r\n\r\nI have looked o\'er the hills of the stormy North,\r\nAnd the larch has hung all his tassels forth;\r\nThe fisher is out on the sunny sea,\r\nAnd the reindeer bounds o\'er the pastures free,\r\nAnd the pine has a fringe of softer green,\r\nAnd the moss looks bright, where my step has been.\r\n\r\nI have sent through the wood-paths a glowing sigh,\r\nAnd called out each voice of the deep blue sky,\r\nFrom the night-bird\'s lay through the starry time,\r\nIn the groves of the soft Hesperian clime,\r\nTo the swan\'s wild note by the Iceland lakes,\r\nWhen the dark fir-branch into verdure breaks.\r\n\r\nFrom the streams and founts I have loosed the chain;\r\nThey are sweeping on to the silvery main,\r\nThey are flashing down from the mountain brows,\r\nThey are flinging spray o\'er the forest boughs,\r\nThey are bursting fresh from their sparry caves,\r\nAnd the earth resounds with the joy of waves.\r\n\r\n    _Felicia D. Hemans._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Boys\r\n\r\n\r\nHas there any old fellow got mixed with the boys?\r\nIf there has take him out, without making a noise.\r\nHang the Almanac\'s cheat and the Catalogue\'s spite!\r\nOld Time is a liar! We\'re twenty tonight!\r\n\r\nWe\'re twenty! We\'re twenty! Who says we are more?\r\nHe\'s tipsy--young jackanapes!--show him the door!\r\n"Gray temples at twenty?"--Yes! _white_ if we please;\r\nWhere the snowflakes fall thickest there\'s nothing can freeze!\r\n\r\nWas it snowing I spoke of? Excuse the mistake!\r\nLook close--you will see not a sign of a flake!\r\nWe want some new garlands for those we have shed,\r\nAnd these are white roses in place of the red.\r\n\r\nWe\'ve a trick, we young fellows, you may have been told.\r\nOf talking (in public) as if we were old;\r\nThat boy we call "Doctor," and this we call "Judge";\r\nIt\'s a neat little fiction--of course it\'s all fudge.\r\n\r\nThat fellow\'s the "Speaker"--the one on the right;\r\n"Mr. Mayor," my young one, how are you to-night?\r\nThat\'s our "Member of Congress," we say when we chaff;\r\nThere\'s the "Reverend" What\'s-his-name?--don\'t make me laugh.\r\n\r\nThat boy with the grave mathematical look\r\nMade believe he had written a wonderful book,\r\nAnd the ROYAL SOCIETY thought it was _true_!\r\nSo they chose him right in; a good joke it was, too!\r\n\r\nThere\'s a boy, we pretend, with a three-decker brain,\r\nThat could harness a team with a logical chain;\r\nWhen he spoke for our manhood in syllabled fire,\r\nWe called him "The Justice," but now he\'s "The Squire."\r\n\r\nAnd there\'s a nice youngster of excellent pith:\r\nFate tried to conceal him by naming him Smith;\r\nBut he shouted a song for the brave and the free--\r\nJust read on his medal, "My country," "of thee!"\r\n\r\nYou hear that boy laughing? You think he\'s all fun;\r\nBut the angels laugh, too, at the good he has done.\r\nThe children laugh loud as they troop to his call,\r\nAnd the poor man that knows him laughs loudest of all!\r\n\r\nYes, we\'re boys--always playing with tongue or with pen;\r\nAnd I sometimes have asked, Shall we ever be men?\r\nShall we always be youthful and laughing and gay,\r\nTill the last dear companion drops smiling away?\r\n\r\nThen here\'s to our boyhood, its gold and its gray!\r\nThe stars of its winter, the dews of its May!\r\nAnd when we have done with our life-lasting toys,\r\nDear Father, take care of Thy children, THE BOYS!\r\n\r\n    _Oliver Wendell Holmes._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rainy Day\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day is cold, and dark, and dreary;\r\nIt rains, and the wind is never weary;\r\nThe vine still clings to the mouldering wall,\r\nBut at every gust the dead leaves fall,\r\n  And the day is dark and dreary.\r\n\r\nMy life is cold, and dark, and dreary;\r\nIt rains, and the wind is never weary;\r\nMy thoughts still cling to the mouldering past,\r\nBut the hopes of youth fall thick in the blast,\r\n  And the days are dark and dreary.\r\n\r\nBe still, sad heart! and cease repining;\r\nBehind the clouds is the sun still shining;\r\nThy fate is the common fate of all,\r\nInto each life some rain must fall,\r\n  Some days must be dark and dreary.\r\n\r\n    _H.W. Longfellow._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLet Me Walk With the Men in the Road\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Tis only a half truth the poet has sung\r\n  Of the "house by the side of the way";\r\nOur Master had neither a house nor a home,\r\n  But He walked with the crowd day by day.\r\nAnd I think, when I read of the poet\'s desire,\r\n  That a house by the road would be good;\r\nBut service is found in its tenderest form\r\n  When we walk with the crowd in the road.\r\n\r\nSo I say, let me walk with the men in the road,\r\n  Let me seek out the burdens that crush,\r\nLet me speak a kind word of good cheer to the weak\r\n  Who are falling behind in the rush.\r\nThere are wounds to be healed, there are breaks we must mend,\r\n  There\'s a cup of cold water to give;\r\nAnd the man in the road by the side of his friend\r\n  Is the man who has learned to live.\r\n\r\nThen tell me no more of the house by the road.\r\n  There is only one place I can live--\r\nIt\'s there with the men who are toiling along,\r\n  Who are needing the cheer I can give.\r\nIt is pleasant to live in the house by the way\r\n  And be a friend, as the poet has said;\r\nBut the Master is bidding us, "Bear ye their load,\r\n  For your rest waiteth yonder ahead."\r\n\r\nI could not remain in the house by the road\r\n  And watch as the toilers go on,\r\nTheir faces beclouded with pain and with sin,\r\n  So burdened, their strength nearly gone.\r\nI\'ll go to their side, I\'ll speak in good cheer,\r\n  I\'ll help them to carry their load;\r\nAnd I\'ll smile at the man in the house by the way,\r\n  As I walk with the crowd in the road.\r\n\r\nOut there in the road that goes by the house,\r\n  Where the poet is singing his song,\r\nI\'ll walk and I\'ll work midst the heat of the day,\r\n  And I\'ll help falling brothers along--\r\nToo busy to live in the house by the way,\r\n  Too happy for such an abode.\r\nAnd my heart sings its praise to the Master of all,\r\n  Who is helping me serve in the road.\r\n\r\n    _Walter J. Gresham._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf We Understood\r\n\r\n\r\nCould we but draw back the curtains\r\nThat surround each other\'s lives,\r\nSee the naked heart and spirit,\r\nKnow what spur the action gives,\r\nOften we should find it better,\r\nPurer than we judged we should,\r\nWe should love each other better,\r\nIf we only understood.\r\n\r\nCould we judge all deeds by motives,\r\nSee the good and bad within,\r\nOften we should love the sinner\r\nAll the while we loathe the sin;\r\nCould we know the powers working\r\nTo o\'erthrow integrity,\r\nWe should judge each other\'s errors\r\nWith more patient charity.\r\n\r\nIf we knew the cares and trials,\r\nKnew the effort all in vain,\r\nAnd the bitter disappointment,\r\nUnderstood the loss and gain--\r\nWould the grim, eternal roughness\r\nSeem--I wonder--just the same?\r\nShould we help where now we hinder,\r\nShould we pity where we blame?\r\n\r\nAh! we judge each other harshly,\r\nKnowing not life\'s hidden force;\r\nKnowing not the fount of action\r\nIs less turbid at its source;\r\nSeeing not amid the evil\r\nAll the golden grains of good;\r\nOh! we\'d love each other better,\r\nIf we only understood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Laugh in Church\r\n\r\n\r\nShe sat on the sliding cushion,\r\n  The dear, wee woman of four;\r\nHer feet, in their shiny slippers,\r\n  Hung dangling over the floor.\r\nShe meant to be good; she had promised,\r\n  And so, with her big, brown eyes,\r\nShe stared at the meeting-house windows\r\n  And counted the crawling flies.\r\n\r\nShe looked far up at the preacher,\r\n  But she thought of the honey bees\r\nDroning away at the blossoms\r\n  That whitened the cherry trees.\r\nShe thought of a broken basket,\r\n  Where, curled in a dusky heap,\r\n_Three sleek, round puppies, with fringy ears\r\n  Lay snuggled and fast asleep._\r\n\r\nSuch soft warm bodies to cuddle,\r\n  Such queer little hearts to beat,\r\nSuch swift, round tongues to kiss,\r\n  Such sprawling, cushiony feet;\r\nShe could feel in her clasping fingers\r\n  The touch of a satiny skin\r\nAnd a cold wet nose exploring\r\n  The dimples under her chin.\r\n\r\nThen a sudden ripple of laughter\r\n  Ran over the parted lips\r\nSo quick that she could not catch it\r\n  With her rosy finger-tips.\r\nThe people whispered, "Bless the child,"\r\n  As each one waked from a nap,\r\nBut the dear, wee woman hid her face\r\n  For shame in her mother\'s lap.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"One, Two, Three!"\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was an old, old, old, old lady,\r\n  And a boy that was half past three;\r\nAnd the way that they played together\r\n  Was beautiful to see.\r\n\r\nShe couldn\'t go running and jumping,\r\n  And the boy, no more could he;\r\nFor he was a thin little fellow,\r\n  With a thin little twisted knee,\r\n\r\nThey sat in the yellow sunlight,\r\n  Out under the maple-tree;\r\nAnd the game that they played I\'ll tell you,\r\n  Just as it was told to me.\r\n\r\nIt was Hide-and-Go-Seek they were playing,\r\n  Though you\'d never have known it to be--\r\nWith an old, old, old, old lady,\r\n  And a boy with a twisted knee.\r\n\r\nThe boy would bend his face down\r\n  On his one little sound right knee,\r\nAnd he\'d guess where she was hiding,\r\n  In guesses One, Two, Three!\r\n\r\n"You are in the china-closet!"\r\n  He would cry, and laugh with glee--\r\nIt wasn\'t the china-closet;\r\n  But he still had Two and Three.\r\n\r\n"You are up in Papa\'s big bedroom,\r\n  In the chest with the queer old key!"\r\nAnd she said: "You are _warm_ and _warmer_;\r\n  But you\'re not quite right," said she.\r\n\r\n"It can\'t be the little cupboard\r\n  Where Mamma\'s things used to be--\r\nSo it must be the clothes-press, Gran\'ma!"\r\n  And he found her with his Three.\r\n\r\nThen she covered her face with her fingers,\r\n  That were wrinkled and white and wee,\r\nAnd she guessed where the boy was hiding,\r\n  With a One and a Two and a Three.\r\n\r\nAnd they never had stirred from their places,\r\n  Right under the maple-tree--\r\nThis old, old, old, old lady,\r\n  And the boy with the lame little knee--\r\nThis dear, dear, dear old lady,\r\n  And the boy who was half past three.\r\n\r\n    _Henry Cuyler Bunner._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUnawares\r\n\r\n\r\nThey said, "The Master is coming\r\n  To honor the town to-day,\r\nAnd none can tell at what house or home\r\n  The Master will choose to stay."\r\nAnd I thought while my heart beat wildly,\r\n  What if He should come to mine,\r\nHow would I strive to entertain\r\n  And honor the Guest Divine!\r\n\r\nAnd straight I turned to toiling\r\n  To make my house more neat;\r\nI swept, and polished, and garnished.\r\n  And decked it with blossoms sweet.\r\nI was troubled for fear the Master\r\n  Might come ere my work was done,\r\nAnd I hasted and worked the faster,\r\n  And watched the hurrying sun.\r\n\r\nBut right in the midst of my duties\r\n  A woman came to my door;\r\nShe had come to tell me her sorrows\r\n  And my comfort and aid to implore,\r\nAnd I said, "I cannot listen\r\n  Nor help you any, to-day;\r\nI have greater things to attend to."\r\n  And the pleader turned away.\r\n\r\nBut soon there came another--\r\n  A cripple, thin, pale and gray--\r\nAnd said, "Oh, let me stop and rest\r\n  A while in your house, I pray!\r\nI have traveled far since morning,\r\n  I am hungry, and faint, and weak;\r\nMy heart is full of misery,\r\n  And comfort and help I seek."\r\n\r\nAnd I cried, "I am grieved and sorry,\r\n  But I cannot help you to-day.\r\nI look for a great and noble Guest,"\r\n  And the cripple went away;\r\nAnd the day wore onward swiftly--\r\n  And my task was nearly done,\r\nAnd a prayer was ever in my heart\r\n  That the Master to me might come.\r\n\r\nAnd I thought I would spring to meet Him,\r\n  And serve him with utmost care,\r\nWhen a little child stood by me\r\n  With a face so sweet and fair--\r\nSweet, but with marks of teardrops--\r\n  And his clothes were tattered and old;\r\nA finger was bruised and bleeding,\r\n  And his little bare feet were cold.\r\n\r\nAnd I said, "I\'m sorry for you--\r\n  You are sorely in need of care;\r\nBut I cannot stop to give it,\r\n  You must hasten otherwhere."\r\nAnd at the words, a shadow\r\n  Swept o\'er his blue-veined brow,--\r\n"Someone will feed and clothe you, dear,\r\n  But I am too busy now."\r\n\r\nAt last the day was ended,\r\n  And my toil was over and done;\r\nMy house was swept and garnished--\r\n  And I watched in the dark--alone.\r\nWatched--but no footfall sounded,\r\n  No one paused at my gate;\r\nNo one entered my cottage door;\r\n  I could only pray--and wait.\r\n\r\nI waited till night had deepened,\r\n  And the Master had not come.\r\n"He has entered some other door," I said,\r\n  "And gladdened some other home!"\r\nMy labor had been for nothing,\r\n  And I bowed my head and I wept,\r\nMy heart was sore with longing--\r\n  Yet--in spite of it all--I slept.\r\n\r\nThen the Master stood before me,\r\n  And his face was grave and fair;\r\n"Three times to-day I came to your door,\r\n  And craved your pity and care;\r\nThree times you sent me onward,\r\n  Unhelped and uncomforted;\r\nAnd the blessing you might have had was lost,\r\n  And your chance to serve has fled."\r\n\r\n"O Lord, dear Lord, forgive me!\r\n  How could I know it was Thee?"\r\nMy very soul was shamed and bowed\r\n  In the depths of humility.\r\nAnd He said, "The sin is pardoned,\r\n  But the blessing is lost to thee;\r\nFor comforting not the least of Mine\r\n  You have failed to comfort Me."\r\n\r\n    _Emma A. Lent._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Land of Beginning Again\r\n\r\n\r\nI wish there were some wonderful place\r\nCalled the Land of Beginning Again,\r\nWhere all our mistakes and all our heartaches,\r\nAnd all our poor, selfish griefs\r\nCould be dropped, like a shabby old coat, at the door,\r\nAnd never put on again.\r\n\r\nI wish we could come on it all unaware,\r\nLike the hunter who finds a lost trail;\r\nAnd I wish that the one whom our blindness had done\r\nThe greatest injustice of all\r\nCould be at the gate like the old friend that waits\r\nFor the comrade he\'s gladdest to hail.\r\n\r\nWe would find the things we intended to do,\r\nBut forgot and remembered too late--\r\nLittle praises unspoken, little promises broken,\r\nAnd all of the thousand and one\r\nLittle duties neglected that might have perfected\r\nThe days of one less fortunate.\r\n\r\nIt wouldn\'t be possible not to be kind.\r\nIn the Land of Beginning Again;\r\nAnd the ones we misjudged and the ones whom we grudged\r\nTheir moments of victory here,\r\nWould find the grasp of our loving handclasp\r\nMore than penitent lips could explain.\r\n\r\nFor what had been hardest we\'d know had been best,\r\nAnd what had seemed loss would be gain,\r\nFor there isn\'t a sting that will not take wing\r\nWhen we\'ve faced it and laughed it away;\r\nAnd I think that the laughter is most what we\'re after,\r\nIn the Land of Beginning Again.\r\n\r\nSo I wish that there were some wonderful place\r\nCalled the Land of Beginning Again,\r\nWhere all our mistakes and all our heartaches,\r\nAnd all our poor, selfish griefs\r\nCould be dropped, like a ragged old coat, at the door,\r\nAnd never put on again.\r\n\r\n    _Louisa Fletcher Tarkington._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPoor Little Joe\r\n\r\n\r\nProp yer eyes wide open, Joey,\r\n  Fur I\'ve brought you sumpin\' great.\r\nApples?

Oh, life\'s bitter cost,\r\nSince the little useless fern was lost!\r\n\r\nUseless? Lost? There came a thoughtful man\r\n  Searching Nature\'s secrets far and deep;\r\n  From a fissure in a rocky steep\r\nHe withdrew a stone, o\'er which there ran\r\nFairy pencilings, a quaint design,\r\nLeafage, veining, fibers, clear and fine,\r\nAnd the fern\'s life lay in every line.\r\nSo, I think, God hides some souls away,\r\nSweetly to surprise us the Last Day.\r\n\r\n    _Mary L.

away,\r\nStreaking all the air with cobwebs\r\n  At the close of one hot day;\r\nAnd the last rays kissed the forehead\r\n  Of a man and maiden fair,\r\nHe with whiskers short and frowsy,\r\n  She with red and glistening hair,\r\nHe with shut jaws stern and silent;\r\nShe, with lips all cold and white,\r\nStruggled to keep back the murmur,\r\n  "Towser shall be tied to-night."\r\n\r\n"Papa," slowly spoke the daughter,\r\n  "I am almost seventeen,\r\nAnd I have a real lover,\r\n  Though he\'s rather young and green;\r\nBut he has a horse and buggy\r\n  And a cow and thirty hens,--\r\nBoys that start out poor, dear Papa,\r\n  Make the best of honest men,\r\nBut if Towser sees and bites him,\r\nFills his eyes with misty light,\r\nHe will never come again, Pa;\r\n  Towser must be tied to-night."\r\n\r\n"Daughter," firmly spoke the farmer,\r\n  (Every word pierced her young heart\r\nLike a carving knife through chicken\r\n  As it hunts the tender part)--\r\n"I\'ve a patch of early melons,\r\n  Two of them are ripe to-day;\r\nTowser must be loose to watch them\r\n  Or they\'ll all be stole away.\r\nI have hoed them late and early\r\n  In dim morn and evening light;\r\nNow they\'re grown I must not lose them;\r\n  Towser\'ll not be tied to-night."\r\n\r\nThen the old man ambled forward,\r\n  Opened wide the kennel-door,\r\nTowser bounded forth to meet him\r\n  As he oft had done before.\r\nAnd the farmer stooped and loosed him\r\n  From the dog-chain short and stout;\r\nTo himself he softly chuckled,\r\n  "Bessie\'s feller must look out."\r\nBut the maiden at the window\r\n  Saw the cruel teeth show white;\r\nIn an undertone she murmured,--\r\n  "Towser must be tied to-night."\r\n\r\nThen the maiden\'s brow grew thoughtful\r\n  And her breath came short and quick,\r\nTill she spied the family clothesline,\r\n  And she whispered, "That\'s the trick."\r\nFrom the kitchen door she glided\r\n  With a plate of meat and bread;\r\nTowser wagged his tail in greeting,\r\n  Knowing well he would be fed.\r\nIn his well-worn leather collar,\r\n  Tied she then the clothesline tight,\r\nAll the time her white lips saying:\r\n  "Towser shall be tied to-night,"\r\n\r\n"There, old doggie," spoke the maiden,\r\n  "You can watch the melon patch,\r\nBut the front gate\'s free and open,\r\n  When John Henry lifts the latch.\r\nFor the clothesline tight is fastened\r\n  To the harvest apple tree,\r\nYou can run and watch the melons,\r\n  But the front gate you can\'t see."\r\nThen her glad ears hear a buggy,\r\n  And her eyes grow big and bright,\r\nWhile her young heart says in gladness,\r\n  "Towser dog is tied to-night."\r\n\r\nUp the path the young man saunters\r\n  With his eye and cheek aglow;\r\nFor he loves the red-haired maiden\r\n  And he aims to tell her so.\r\nBessie\'s roguish little brother,\r\n  In a fit of boyish glee,\r\nHad untied the slender clothesline,\r\n  From the harvest apple tree.\r\nThen old Towser heard the footsteps,\r\n  Raised his bristles, fixed for fight,--\r\n"Bark away," the maiden whispers;\r\n  "Towser, you are tied to-night."\r\n\r\nThen old Towser bounded forward,\r\n  Passed the open kitchen door;\r\nBessie screamed and quickly followed,\r\n  But John Henry\'s gone before.\r\nDown the path he speeds most quickly,\r\n  For old Towser sets the pace;\r\nAnd the maiden close behind them\r\n  Shows them she is in the race.\r\nThen the clothesline, can she get it?\r\n  And her eyes grow big and bright;\r\nAnd she springs and grasps it firmly:\r\n  "Towser shall be tied

Were the world mine, I would give it, if I might,\r\nTo believe in old St. Nicholas, and be a child to-night.\r\n\r\nJust to hang my little stocking where it used to hang, and feel\r\nFor one moment all the old thoughts and the old hopes o\'er me steal.\r\nBut, oh! loved and loving faces, in the firelight\'s dancing glow,\r\nThere will never come another like that Christmas long ago!\r\n\r\nFor the old home is deserted, and the ashes long have lain\r\nIn the great, old-fashioned fireplace that will never shine again.\r\nFriendly hands that then clasped ours now are folded \'neath the snow;\r\nGone the dear ones who were with us on that Christmas long ago.\r\n\r\nLet the children have their Christmas--let them have it while they may;\r\nLife is short and childhood\'s fleeting, and there\'ll surely come a day\r\nWhen St. Nicholas will sadly pass on by the close-shut door,\r\nMissing all the merry faces that had greeted him of yore;\r\n\r\nWhen no childish step shall echo through the quiet, silent room;\r\nWhen no childish smile shall brighten, and no laughter lift the gloom;\r\nWhen the shadows that fall \'round us in the fire-light\'s fitful glow\r\nShall be ghosts of those who sat there in the Christmas long ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNearer Home\r\n\r\n\r\nOne sweetly solemn thought\r\n  Comes to me o\'er and o\'er,--\r\nI am nearer home to-day\r\n  Than I\'ve ever been before;--\r\n\r\nNearer my Father\'s house\r\n  Where the many mansions be,\r\nNearer the great white throne,\r\n  Nearer the jasper sea;--\r\n\r\nNearer the bound of life\r\n  Where we lay our burdens down;\r\nNearer leaving the cross,\r\n  Nearer gaining the crown.\r\n\r\nBut lying darkly between,\r\n  Winding down through the night,\r\nIs the dim and unknown stream\r\n  That leads at last to the light.\r\n\r\nCloser and closer my steps\r\n  Come to the dark abysm;\r\nCloser death to my lips\r\n  Presses the awful chrism.\r\n\r\nFather, perfect my trust;\r\n  Strengthen the might of my faith;\r\nLet me feel as I would when I stand\r\n  On the rock of the shore of death,--\r\n\r\nFeel as I would when my feet\r\n  Are slipping o\'er the brink;\r\nFor it may be I am nearer home,\r\n  Nearer now than I think.\r\n\r\n    _Phoebe Cary._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Minuet\r\n\r\n\r\nGrandma told me all about it,\r\nTold me so I could not doubt it,\r\nHow she danced, my grandma danced, long ago!\r\nHow she held her pretty head,\r\nHow her dainty skirts she spread,\r\nHow she turned her little toes,\r\nSmiling little human rose!\r\n\r\nGrandma\'s hair was bright and shining,\r\nDimpled cheeks, too! ah! how funny!\r\nBless me, now she wears a cap,\r\nMy grandma does, and takes a nap every single day;\r\nYet she danced the minuet long ago;\r\nNow she sits there rocking, rocking,\r\nAlways knitting grandpa\'s stocking--\r\nEvery girl was taught to knit long ago--\r\nBut her figure is so neat,\r\nAnd her ways so staid and sweet,\r\nI can almost see her now,\r\nBending to her partner\'s bow, long ago.\r\n\r\nGrandma says our modern jumping,\r\nRushing, whirling, dashing, bumping,\r\nWould have shocked the gentle people long ago.\r\nNo, they moved with stately grace,\r\nEverything in proper place,\r\nGliding slowly forward, then\r\nSlowly courtesying back again.\r\n\r\nModern ways are quite alarming, grandma says,\r\nBut boys were charming--\r\nGirls and boys I mean, of course--long ago,\r\nSweetly modest, bravely shy!\r\nWhat if all of us should try just to feel\r\nLike those who met in the stately minuet, long ago.\r\nWith the minuet in fashion,\r\nWho could fly into a passion?\r\nAll would wear the calm they wore long ago,\r\nAnd if in years to come, perchance,\r\nI tell my grandchild of our dance,\r\nI should really like to say,\r\nWe did it in some such way, long ago.\r\n\r\n    _Mary Mapes Dodge._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Vagabonds\r\n\r\n\r\nWe are two travellers, Roger and I.\r\n  Roger\'s my dog--Come here, you scamp!\r\nJump for the gentleman--mind your eye!\r\n  Over the table--look out for the lamp!--\r\nThe rogue is growing a little old;\r\n  Five years we\'ve tramped through wind and weather,\r\nAnd slept outdoors when nights were cold,\r\n  And ate, and drank--and starved together.\r\n\r\nWe\'ve learned what comfort is, I tell you:\r\n  A bed on the floor, a bit of rosin,\r\nA fire to thaw our thumbs (poor fellow,\r\n  The paw he holds up there has been frozen),\r\nPlenty of catgut for my fiddle,\r\n  (This outdoor business is bad for strings),\r\nThen a few nice buckwheats hot from the griddle,\r\n  And Roger and I set up for kings!\r\n\r\nNo, thank you, Sir, I never drink.\r\n  Roger and I are exceedingly moral.\r\nAren\'t we, Roger? see him wink.\r\n  Well, something hot then, we won\'t quarrel.\r\nHe\'s thirsty, too--see him nod his head?\r\n  What a pity, Sir, that dogs can\'t talk;\r\nHe understands every word that\'s said,\r\n  And he knows good milk from water and chalk.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, Sir, now I reflect,\r\n  I\'ve been so sadly given to grog,\r\nI wonder I\'ve not lost the respect\r\n  (Here\'s to you, Sir!) even of my dog.\r\nBut he sticks by through thick and thin;\r\n  And this old coat with its empty pockets\r\nAnd rags that smell of tobacco and gin,\r\n  He\'ll follow while he has eyes in his sockets.\r\n\r\nThere isn\'t another creature living\r\n  Would do it, and prove, through every disaster,\r\nSo fond, so faithful, and so forgiving,\r\n  To such a miserable, thankless master.\r\nNo, Sir! see him wag his tail and grin--\r\n  By George! it makes my old eyes water--\r\nThat is, there\'s something in this gin\r\n  That chokes a fellow, but no matter!\r\n\r\nWe\'ll have some music, if you\'re willing.\r\n  And Roger (hem! what a plague a cough is, Sir!)\r\nShall march a little.--Start, you villain!\r\n  Paws up! eyes front! salute your officer!\r\n\'Bout face! attention! take your rifle!\r\n  (Some dogs have arms, you see.) Now hold\r\nYour cap while the gentleman gives a trifle\r\n  To aid a poor old patriot soldier!\r\n\r\nMarch! Halt! Now show how the Rebel shakes,\r\n  When he stands up to hear his sentence;\r\nNow tell me how many drams it takes\r\n  To honor a jolly new acquaintance.\r\nFive yelps--that\'s five; he\'s mighty knowing;\r\n  The night\'s before us, fill the glasses;--\r\nQuick, Sir! I\'m ill, my brain is going!--\r\n  Some brandy,--thank you;--there,--it passes!\r\n\r\nWhy not reform? That\'s easily said;\r\n  But I\'ve gone through such wretched treatment,\r\nSometimes forgetting the taste of bread,\r\n  And scarce remembering what meat meant,\r\nThat my poor stomach\'s past reform;\r\n  And there are times when, mad with thinking,\r\nI\'d sell out heaven for something warm\r\n  To prop a horrible inward sinking.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to forget to think?\r\n  At your age, Sir, home, fortune, friends,\r\nA dear girl\'s love,--but I took to drink;--\r\n  The same old story; you know how it ends.\r\nIf you could have seen these classic features,--\r\n  You needn\'t laugh, Sir; I was not then\r\nSuch a burning libel on God\'s creatures;\r\n  I was one of your handsome men--\r\n\r\nIf you had seen her, so fair, so young,\r\n  Whose head was happy on this breast;\r\nIf you could have heard the songs I sung\r\n  When the wine went round, you wouldn\'t have guess\'d\r\nThat ever I, Sir, should be straying\r\n  From door to door, with fiddle and dog,\r\nRagged and penniless, and playing\r\n  To you to-night for a glass of grog.\r\n\r\nShe\'s married since,--a parson\'s wife,\r\n  \'Twas better for her that we should part;\r\nBetter the soberest, prosiest life\r\n  Than a blasted home and a broken heart.\r\nI have seen her--once; I was weak and spent\r\n  On the dusty road; a carriage stopped,\r\nBut little she dreamed as on she went,\r\n  Who kissed the coin that her fingers dropped.\r\n\r\nYou\'ve set me talking, Sir; I\'m sorry;\r\n  It makes me wild to think of the change!\r\nWhat do you care for a beggar\'s story?\r\n  Is it amusing? you find it strange?\r\nI had a mother so proud of me!\r\n  \'Twas well she died before--Do you know\r\nIf the happy spirits in heaven can see\r\n  The ruin and wretchedness here below?\r\n\r\nAnother glass, and strong, to deaden\r\n  This pain; then Roger and I will start.\r\nI wonder, has he such a lumpish, leaden,\r\n  Aching thing, in place of a heart?\r\nHe is sad sometimes, and would weep, if he could,\r\n  No doubt, remembering things that were,--\r\nA virtuous kennel, with plenty of food,\r\n  And himself a sober, respectable cur.\r\n\r\nI\'m better now; that glass was warming--\r\n  You rascal! limber your lazy feet!\r\nWe must be fiddling and performing\r\n  For supper and bed, or starve in the street.--\r\nNot a very gay life to lead, you think.\r\n  But soon we shall go where lodgings are free,\r\nAnd the sleepers need neither victuals nor drink;--\r\n  The sooner, the better for Roger and me.\r\n\r\n    _J.T. Trowbridge._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Isle of Long Ago\r\n\r\n\r\nOh, a wonderful stream is the river of Time,\r\n  As it runs through the realm of tears,\r\nWith a faultless rhythm and a musical rhyme,\r\nAnd a boundless sweep and a surge sublime,\r\n  As it blends with the ocean of Years.\r\n\r\nHow the winters are drifting, like flakes of snow,\r\n  And the summers, like buds between;\r\nAnd the year in the sheaf--so they come and they go,\r\nOn the river\'s breast, with its ebb and flow,\r\n  As it glides in the shadow and sheen.\r\n\r\nThere\'s a magical isle up the river of Time,\r\n  Where the softest of airs are playing;\r\nThere\'s a cloudless sky and a tropical clime,\r\nAnd a song as sweet as a vesper chime,\r\n  And the Junes with the roses are staying.\r\n\r\nAnd the name of that isle is the Long Ago,\r\n  And we bury our treasures there;\r\nThere are brows of beauty and bosoms of snow--\r\nThere are heaps of dust--but we love them so!--\r\n  There are trinkets and tresses of hair;\r\n\r\nThere are fragments of song that nobody sings,\r\n  And a part of an infant\'s prayer,\r\nThere\'s a lute unswept, and a harp without strings;\r\nThere are broken vows and pieces of rings,\r\n  And the garments that she used to wear.\r\n\r\nThere are hands that are waved, when the fairy shore\r\n  By the mirage is lifted in air;\r\nAnd we sometimes hear, through the turbulent roar,\r\nSweet voices we heard in the days gone before,\r\n  When the wind down the river is fair.\r\n\r\nOh, remembered for aye be the blessed Isle,\r\n  All the day of our life till night--\r\nWhen the evening comes with its beautiful smile.\r\nAnd our eyes are closing to slumber awhile,\r\n  May that "Greenwood" of Soul be in sight!\r\n\r\n    _Benjamin Franklin Taylor_.\r\n\r\nNOTE: The last line of this poem needs explanation. "Greenwood" is the\r\nname of a cemetery in Brooklyn, N.Y. "Greenwood of Soul" means the\r\nsoul\'s resting place, or heaven.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Dying Newsboy\r\n\r\n\r\nIn an attic bare and cheerless, Jim the newsboy dying lay\r\nOn a rough but clean straw pallet, at the fading of the day;\r\nScant the furniture about him but bright flowers were in the room,\r\nCrimson phloxes, waxen lilies, roses laden with perfume.\r\nOn a table by the bedside open at a well-worn page,\r\nWhere the mother had been reading lay a Bible stained by age,\r\nNow he could not hear the verses; he was flighty, and she wept\r\nWith her arms around her youngest, who close to her side had crept.\r\n\r\nBlacking boots and selling papers, in all weathers day by day,\r\nBrought upon poor Jim consumption, which was eating life away,\r\nAnd this cry came with his anguish for each breath a struggle cost,\r\n"\'Ere\'s the morning _Sun_ and _\'Erald_--latest news of steamship lost.\r\nPapers, mister? Morning papers?" Then the cry fell to a moan,\r\nWhich was changed a moment later to another frenzied tone:\r\n"Black yer boots, sir? Just a nickel! Shine \'em like an evening star.\r\nIt grows late, Jack! Night is coming. Evening papers, here they are!"\r\n\r\nSoon a mission teacher entered, and approached the humble bed;\r\nThen poor Jim\'s mind cleared an instant, with his cool hand on his head,\r\n"Teacher," cried he, "I remember what you said the other day,\r\nMa\'s been reading of the Saviour, and through Him I see my way.\r\nHe is with me! Jack, I charge you of our mother take good care\r\nWhen Jim\'s gone! Hark! boots or papers, which will I be over there?\r\nBlack yer boots, sir? Shine \'em right up! Papers! Read God\'s book instead,\r\nBetter\'n papers that to die on! Jack--" one gasp, and Jim was dead!\r\n\r\nFloating from that attic chamber came the teacher\'s voice in prayer,\r\nAnd it soothed the bitter sorrow of the mourners kneeling there,\r\nHe commended them to Heaven, while the tears rolled down his face,\r\nThanking God that Jim had listened to sweet words of peace and grace,\r\nEver \'mid the want and squalor of the wretched and the poor,\r\nKind hearts find a ready welcome, and an always open door;\r\nFor the sick are in strange places, mourning hearts are everywhere,\r\nAnd such need the voice of kindness, need sweet sympathy and prayer.\r\n\r\n    _Emily Thornton._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBreak, Break, Break\r\n\r\n\r\nBreak, break, break,\r\n  On thy cold gray stones, O sea!\r\nAnd I would that my tongue could utter\r\n  The thoughts that arise in me.\r\n\r\nO well for the fisherman\'s boy\r\n  That he shouts with his sister at play!\r\nO well for the sailor lad\r\n  That he sings in his boat on the bay!\r\n\r\nAnd the stately ships go on\r\n  To their haven under the hill;\r\nBut O for the touch of a vanished hand,\r\n  And the sound of a voice that is still!\r\n\r\nBreak, break, break,\r\n  At the foot of thy crags, O sea!\r\nBut the tender grace of a day that is dead\r\n  Will never come back to me.\r\n\r\n    _Alfred Tennyson._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDon\'t Kill the Birds\r\n\r\n\r\nDon\'t kill the birds, the pretty birds,\r\n  That sing about your door,\r\nSoon as the joyous spring has come,\r\n  And chilling storms are o\'er.\r\nThe little birds, how sweet they sing!\r\n  Oh! let them joyous live;\r\nAnd never seek to take the life\r\n  That you can never give.\r\n\r\nDon\'t kill the birds, the pretty birds,\r\n  That play among the trees;\r\n\'Twould make the earth a cheerless place,\r\n  Should we dispense with these.\r\nThe little birds, how fond they play!\r\n  Do not disturb their sport;\r\nBut let them warble forth their songs,\r\n  Till winter cuts them short.\r\n\r\nDon\'t kill the birds, the happy birds,\r\n  That bless the fields and grove;\r\nSo innocent to look upon,\r\n  They claim our warmest love.\r\nThe happy birds, the tuneful birds,\r\n  How pleasant \'tis to see!\r\nNo spot can be a cheerless place\r\n  Where\'er their presence be.\r\n\r\n    _D.C. Colesworthy._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBill\'s in the Legislature\r\n\r\n\r\nI\'ve got a letter, parson, from my son away out West,\r\nAn\' my old heart is heavy as an anvil in my breast,\r\nTo think the boy whose future I had once so nicely planned\r\nShould wander from the right and come to such a bitter end.\r\n\r\nI told him when he left us, only three short years ago,\r\nHe\'d find himself a-plowing in a mighty crooked row;\r\nHe\'d miss his father\'s counsel and his mother\'s prayers, too,\r\nBut he said the farm was hateful, an\' he guessed he\'d have to go.\r\n\r\nI know there\'s big temptations for a youngster in the West,\r\nBut I believed our Billy had the courage to resist;\r\nAn\' when he left I warned him of the ever waitin\' snares\r\nThat lie like hidden serpents in life\'s pathway everywheres.\r\n\r\nBut Bill, he promised faithful to be careful, an\' allowed\r\nThat he\'d build a reputation that\'d make us mighty proud.\r\nBut it seems as how my counsel sort o\' faded from his mind,\r\nAnd now he\'s got in trouble of the very worstest kind!\r\n\r\nHis letters came so seldom that I somehow sort o\' knowed\r\nThat Billy was a-trampin\' of a mighty rocky road;\r\nBut never once imagined he would bow my head in shame,\r\nAnd in the dust would woller his old daddy\'s honored name.\r\n\r\nHe writes from out in Denver, an\' the story\'s mighty short--\r\nI jess can\'t tell his mother!--It\'ll crush her poor old heart!\r\nAn\' so I reckoned, parson, you might break the news to her--\r\nBill\'s in the Legislature but he doesn\'t say what fur!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bridge Builder\r\n\r\n\r\nAn old man going a lone highway,\r\nCame, at the evening cold and gray,\r\nTo a chasm vast and deep and wide,\r\nThe old man crossed in the twilight dim,\r\nThe sullen stream had no fear for him;\r\nBut he turned when safe on the other side\r\nAnd built a bridge to span the tide.\r\n\r\n"Old man," said a fellow pilgrim near,\r\n"You are wasting your strength with building here;\r\nYour journey will end with the ending day,\r\nYon never again will pass this way;\r\nYou\'ve crossed the chasm, deep and wide,\r\nWhy build this bridge at evening tide?"\r\n\r\nThe builder lifted his old gray head;\r\n"Good friend, in the path I have come," he said,\r\n"There followed after me to-day\r\nA youth whose feet must pass this way.\r\nThis chasm that has been as naught to me\r\nTo that fair-haired youth may a pitfall be;\r\nHe, too, must cross in the twilight dim;\r\nGood friend, I am building this bridge for him!"\r\n\r\n    _Anonymous._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSong of Marion\'s Men\r\n\r\n\r\nOur band is few, but true and tried,\r\n  Our leader frank and bold;\r\nThe British soldier trembles\r\n  When Marion\'s name is told.\r\nOur fortress is the good green wood,\r\n  Our tent the cypress tree;\r\nWe know the forest round us\r\n  As seamen know the sea;\r\nWe know its walls of thorny vines,\r\n  Its glades of reedy grass,\r\nIts safe and silent islands\r\n  Within the dark morass.\r\n\r\nWoe to the English soldiery\r\n  That little dread us near!\r\nOn them shall light at midnight\r\n  A strange and sudden fear:\r\nWhen, waking to their tents on fire,\r\n  They grasp their arms in vain,\r\nAnd they who stand to face us\r\n  Are beat to earth again;\r\nAnd they who fly in terror deem\r\n  A mighty host behind,\r\nAnd hear the tramp of thousands\r\n  Upon the hollow wind.\r\n\r\nThen sweet the hour that brings release\r\n  From danger and from toil;\r\nWe talk the battle over\r\n  And share the battle\'s spoil.\r\nThe woodland rings with laugh and shout\r\n  As if a hunt were up,\r\nAnd woodland flowers are gathered\r\n  To crown the soldier\'s cup.\r\nWith merry songs we mock the wind\r\n  That in the pine-top grieves,\r\nAnd slumber long and sweetly\r\n  On beds of oaken leaves.\r\n\r\nWell knows the fair and friendly moon\r\n  The band that Marion leads--\r\nThe glitter of their rifles,\r\n  The scampering of their steeds.\r\n\'Tis life our fiery barbs to guide\r\n  Across the moonlight plains;\r\n\'Tis life to feel the night wind\r\n  That lifts their tossing manes.\r\nA moment in the British camp--\r\n  A moment--and away--\r\nBack to the pathless forest\r\n  Before the peep of day.\r\n\r\nGrave men there are by broad Santee,\r\n  Grave men with hoary hairs;\r\nTheir hearts are all with Marion,\r\n  For Marion are their prayers.\r\nAnd lovely ladies greet our band\r\n  With kindliest welcoming,\r\nWith smiles like those of summer,\r\n  And tears like those of spring.\r\nFor them we wear these trusty arms,\r\n  And lay them down no more\r\nTill we have driven the Briton\r\n  Forever from our shore.\r\n\r\n    _William Cullen Bryant._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Minstrel-Boy\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Minstrel-Boy to the war is gone,\r\n  In the ranks of death you\'ll find him;\r\nHis father\'s sword he has girded on,\r\n  And his wild harp slung behind him.--\r\n"Land of song!" said the warrior-bard,\r\n  "Though all the world betrays thee,\r\nOne sword, at least, thy rights shall guard,\r\n  One faithful harp shall praise thee!"\r\nThe Minstrel fell!--but the foeman\'s chain\r\n  Could not bring his proud soul under;\r\nThe harp he loved ne\'er spoke again,\r\n  For he tore its chords asunder;\r\nAnd said, "No chains shall sully thee,\r\n  Thou soul of love and bravery!\r\nThy songs were made for the pure and free,\r\n  They shall never sound in slavery!"\r\n\r\n    _Thomas Moore._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Homestead\r\n\r\n\r\nOur old brown homestead reared its walls,\r\n  From the wayside dust aloof,\r\nWhere the apple-boughs could almost cast\r\n  Their fruitage on its roof:\r\nAnd the cherry-tree so near it grew,\r\n  That when awake I\'ve lain,\r\nIn the lonesome nights, I\'ve heard the limbs,\r\n  As they creaked against the pane:\r\nAnd those orchard trees, O those orchard trees!\r\n  I\'ve seen my little brothers rocked\r\nIn their tops by the summer breeze.\r\n\r\nThe sweet-brier under the window-sill,\r\n  Which the early birds made glad,\r\nAnd the damask rose by the garden fence\r\n  Were all the flowers we had.\r\nI\'ve looked at many a flower since then,\r\n  Exotics rich and rare,\r\nThat to other eyes were lovelier,\r\n  But not to me so fair;\r\nO those roses bright, O those roses bright!\r\n  I have twined them with my sister\'s locks,\r\nThat are hid in the dust from sight!\r\n\r\nWe had a well, a deep old well,\r\n  Where the spring was never dry,\r\nAnd the cool drops down from the mossy stones\r\n  Were falling constantly:\r\nAnd there never was water half so sweet\r\n  As that in my little cup,\r\nDrawn up to the curb by the rude old sweep,\r\n  Which my father\'s hand set up;\r\nAnd that deep old well, O that deep old well!\r\n  I remember yet the splashing sound\r\nOf the bucket as it fell.\r\n\r\nOur homestead had an ample hearth,\r\n  Where at night we loved to meet;\r\nThere my mother\'s voice was always kind,\r\n  And her smile was always sweet;\r\nAnd there I\'ve sat on my father\'s knee,\r\n  And watched his thoughtful brow,\r\nWith my childish hand in his raven hair,--\r\n  That hair is silver now!\r\nBut that broad hearth\'s light, O that broad hearth\'s light!\r\n  And my father\'s look, and my mother\'s smile,--\r\nThey are in my heart to-night.\r\n\r\n    _Phoebe Gary._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Ballad of the Tempest\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were crowded in the cabin,\r\n  Not a soul would dare to sleep,--\r\nIt was midnight on the waters,\r\n  And a storm was on the deep.\r\n\r\n\'Tis a fearful thing in winter\r\n  To be shattered by the blast,\r\nAnd to hear the rattling trumpet\r\n  Thunder, "Cut away the mast!"\r\n\r\nSo we shuddered there in silence,--\r\n  For the stoutest held his breath,\r\nWhile the hungry sea was roaring\r\n  And the breakers talked with Death.\r\n\r\nAs thus we sat in darkness,\r\n  Each one busy with his prayers,\r\n"We are lost!" the captain shouted,\r\n  As he staggered down the stairs.\r\n\r\nBut his little daughter whispered,\r\n  As she took his icy hand,\r\n"Isn\'t God upon the ocean,\r\n  Just the same as on the land?"\r\n\r\nThen we kissed the little maiden,\r\n  And we spoke in better cheer,\r\nAnd we anchored safe in harbor,\r\n  When the morn was shining clear.\r\n\r\n    _James T.

The frost of age\r\nHas touched the once-brown hair,\r\nAnd left it white as are the chaliced lilies.\r\nChildren, whose rosy lips once claimed\r\nA father\'s blessing and a mother\'s love,\r\nHave grown to man\'s estate, save two\r\nWhom God called early home to wait\r\nFor them in heaven.\r\n\r\n  And then the old man thinks\r\nHow on a night like this, when faint\r\nAnd sweet as half-remembered dreams\r\nOld Whippoorwill Falls did murmur soft\r\nIts evening psalms, when fragrant lilies\r\nPointed up the way her Christ had gone,\r\nGod called the wife and mother home,\r\nAnd bade him wait.\r\n  Oh! why is it so hard for\r\nMan to wait? to sit with folded hands,\r\nApart, amid the busy throng,\r\nAnd hear the buzz and hum of toil around;\r\nTo see men reap and bind the golden sheaves\r\nOf earthly fruits, while he looks idly on,\r\nAnd knows he may not join,\r\nBut only wait till God has said, "Enough!"\r\n  And calls him home!\r\n\r\nAnd thus the old man dreams,\r\nAnd then awakes; awakes to hear\r\nThe sweet old song just dying\r\nOn the pulsing evening air:\r\n\r\n    "When other helpers fail,\r\n      And comforts flee,\r\n    Lord of the helpless,\r\n      Oh, abide with me!"\r\n\r\n    _Eliza M.

with change of hopes and fears\r\n  And in the selfsame place,\r\nTwo women, gray with middle years,\r\n  Stood wondering, face to face.\r\n\r\nWith wakened memories, as they met,\r\n  They queried what had been:\r\n"A poor man\'s wife am I, and yet,"\r\n  Said one, "I am a queen.\r\n\r\n"My realm a little homestead is,\r\n  Where, lacking crown and throne,\r\nI rule by loving services\r\n  And patient toil alone."\r\n\r\nThe other said: "The great world lies\r\n  Beyond me as it laid;\r\nO\'er love\'s and duty\'s boundaries\r\n  My feet have never strayed.\r\n\r\n"I see but common sights at home,\r\n  Its common sounds I hear,\r\nMy widowed mother\'s sick-bed room\r\n  Sufficeth for my sphere.\r\n\r\n"I read to her some pleasant page\r\n  Of travel far and wide,\r\nAnd in a dreamy pilgrimage\r\n  We wander side by side.\r\n\r\n"And when, at last, she falls asleep,\r\n  My book becomes to me\r\nA magic glass: my watch I keep,\r\n  But all the world I see.\r\n\r\n"A farm-wife queen your place you fill,\r\n  While fancy\'s privilege\r\nIs mine to walk the earth at will,\r\n  Thanks to the Wishing Bridge."\r\n\r\n"Nay, leave the legend for the truth,"\r\n  The other cried, "and say\r\nGod gives the wishes of our youth\r\n  But in His own best way!"\r\n\r\n    _John Greenleaf Whittier._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Things Divine\r\n\r\n\r\nThese are the things I hold divine:\r\nA trusting chi id\'s hand laid in mine,\r\nRich brown earth and wind-tossed trees,\r\nThe taste of grapes and the drone of bees,\r\nA rhythmic gallop, long June days,\r\nA rose-hedged lane and lovers\' lays,\r\nThe welcome smile on neighbors\' faces,\r\nCool, wide hills and open places,\r\nBreeze-blown fields of silver rye,\r\nThe wild, sweet note of the plover\'s cry,\r\nFresh spring showers and scent of box,\r\nThe soft, pale tint of the garden phlox,\r\nLilacs blooming, a drowsy noon,\r\nA flight of geese and an autumn moon,\r\nRolling meadows and storm-washed heights,\r\nA fountain murmur on summer nights,\r\nA dappled fawn in the forest hush,\r\nSimple words and the song of a thrush,\r\nRose-red dawns and a mate to share\r\nWith comrade soul my gypsy fare,\r\nA waiting fire when the twilight ends,\r\nA gallant heart and the voice of friends.\r\n\r\n    _Jean Brooks Burt._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMothers of Men\r\n\r\n\r\nThe bravest battle that ever was fought!\r\n  Shall I tell you where and when?\r\nOn the map of the world you will find it not,\r\n  \'Twas fought by the mothers of men.\r\n\r\nNay, not with cannon or battle shot,\r\n  With sword or nobler pen,\r\nNay, not with eloquent words or thought\r\n  From mouths of wonderful men;\r\n\r\nBut deep in the walled-up woman\'s heart--\r\n  Of woman that would not yield,\r\nBut bravely, silently, bore her part--\r\n  Lo, there is that battle field!\r\n\r\nNo marshaling troup, no bivouac song,\r\n  No banner to gleam or wave,\r\nBut oh! these battles, they last so long--\r\n  From babyhood to the grave.\r\n\r\nYet, faithful as a bridge of stars,\r\n  She fights in her walled-up town--\r\nFights on and on in the endless wars,\r\n  Then, silent, unseen, goes down.\r\n\r\nOh, ye with banner and battle shot,\r\n  And soldiers to shout and praise,\r\nI tell you the kingliest victories fought\r\n  Were fought in those silent ways.\r\n\r\nOh, spotless in a world of shame,\r\n  With splendid and silent scorn,\r\nGo back to God as white as you came--\r\n  The kingliest warrior born!\r\n\r\n    _Joaquin Miller._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEcho\r\n\r\n\r\n"I asked of Echo, t\'other day\r\n  (Whose words are often few and funny),\r\nWhat to a novice she could say\r\n  Of courtship, love and matrimony.\r\n  Quoth Echo plainly,--\'Matter-o\'-money!\'\r\n\r\n"Whom should I marry?

leaves of the sturdy oak trees\r\n  Are splendid with crimson and red.\r\nAnd the golden flags of the maple\r\n  Are fluttering overhead.\r\n\r\nThrough the tangle of faded grasses\r\n  There are trailing vines ablaze,\r\nAnd the glory of warmth and color\r\n  Gleams through the autumn haze.\r\n\r\nLike banners of marching armies\r\n  That farther and farther go;\r\nDown the winding roads and valleys\r\n  The boughs of the sumacs glow.\r\n\r\nSo open your eyes, little children,\r\n  And open your hearts as well,\r\nTill the charm of the bright October\r\n  Shall fold you in its

can do\r\n  To help mankind to live and grow.\r\nYour lineage matters not at all,\r\n  Nor counts one whit your gold or gear,\r\nWhat can you do to show the world\r\n  The reason for your being here?\r\n\r\nFor just what space you occupy\r\n  The world requires you pay the rent;\r\nIt does not shower its gifts galore,\r\n  Its benefits are only lent;\r\nAnd it has need of workers true,\r\n  Willing of hand, alert of brain;\r\nGo forth and prove what you can do,\r\n  Nor wait to count o\'er loss or gain.\r\n\r\nGive of your best to help and cheer,\r\n The more you give the more you grow;\r\nThis message evermore rings true,\r\n  In time you reap whate\'er you sow.\r\nNo failure you have need to fear,\r\n  Except to fail to do your best--\r\nWhat have you done, what can you do?\r\n  That is the question, that the test.\r\n\r\n    _Elizabeth Clarke Hardy._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSong of the Chattahoochee[*]\r\n\r\n\r\n  Out of the hills of Habersham,\r\n  Down the valleys of Hall,\r\nI hurry amain to reach the plain,\r\nRun the rapid and leap the fall,\r\nSplit at the rock and together again,\r\nAccept my bed, or narrow or wide,\r\nAnd flee from folly on every side\r\nWith a lover\'s pain to attain the plain\r\n  Far from the hills of Habersham,\r\n  Far from the valleys of Hall.\r\n\r\n  All down the hills of Habersham,\r\n  All through the valleys of Hall,\r\nThe rushes cried "Abide, abide,"\r\nThe wilful waterweeds held me thrall,\r\nThe laving laurel turned my tide,\r\nThe ferns and the fondling grass said "Stay,"\r\nThe dewberry dipped for to work delay,\r\nAnd the little reeds sighed "Abide, abide\r\n  Here in the hills of Habersham,\r\n  Here in the valleys of Hall."\r\n\r\n  High o\'er the hills of Habersham,\r\n  Veiling the valleys of Hall,\r\nThe hickory told me manifold\r\nFair tales of shade, the poplar tall\r\nWrought me her shadowy self to hold,\r\nThe chestnut, the oak, the walnut, the pine,\r\nO\'erleaning, with flickering meaning and sign,\r\nSaid, "Pass not, so cold, these manifold\r\n  Deep shades of the hills of Habersham,\r\n  These glades in the valleys of Hall."\r\n\r\n  And oft in the hills of Habersham,\r\n  And oft in the valleys of Hall,\r\nThe white quartz shone, and the smooth brookstone\r\nDid bar me of passage with friendly brawl,\r\nAnd many a luminous jewel lone\r\n--Crystals clear or a-cloud with mist,\r\nRuby, garnet, and amethyst--\r\nMade lures with the lights of streaming stone,\r\n  In the clefts of the hills of Habersham,\r\n  In the beds of the valleys of Hall.\r\n\r\n  But oh, not the hills of Habersham,\r\n  And oh, not the valleys of Hall\r\nAvail: I am fain for to water the plain.\r\nDownward the voices of Duty call--\r\nDownward, to toil and be mixed with the main.\r\nThe dry fields burn, and the mills are to turn,\r\nAnd a myriad flowers mortally yearn,\r\nAnd the lordly main from beyond the plain\r\n  Calls o\'er the hills of Habersham,\r\n  Calls through the valleys of Hall.\r\n\r\n    _Sidney Lanier._\r\n\r\n[Footnote *: Used by special permission of the publishers, Charles\r\nScribner\'s Sons.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCourting in Kentucky\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen Mary Ann

still\r\nThat all is well, and sure that He\r\nWho launched my bark will sail with me\r\nThrough storm and calm, and will not fail,\r\nWhatever breezes may prevail,\r\nTo land me, every peril past,\r\nWithin His Haven at the last.\r\nThen blow it east, or blow it west,\r\nThe wind that blows, that wind is best.\r\n\r\n    _Caroline H.

the gale pressed its lips to the\r\n      cracks;\r\nAnd the children\'s hot faces were streaming, the while they were freezing\r\n      their backs.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nNow Marco Bozzaris had fallen, and all of his suff\'rings were o\'er,\r\nAnd the class to their seats were retreating, when footsteps were heard\r\n      at the door;\r\nAnd five of the good district fathers marched into the room in a row,\r\nAnd stood themselves up by the fire, and shook off their white cloaks of\r\n      snow.\r\nAnd the spokesman, a grave squire of sixty, with countenance solemnly sad,\r\nSpoke thus, while the children all listened, with all of the ears that\r\n      they had:\r\n"We\'ve come here, school-master, in-tendin\' to cast an inquirin\' eye\r\n      \'round,\r\nConcernin\' complaints that\'s been entered, an\' fault that has lately been\r\n      found;\r\nTo pace off the width of your doin\'s, an\' witness what you\'ve been about,\r\nAn\' see if it\'s paying to keep you, or whether we\'d best turn ye out.\r\n\r\n"The first thing I\'m bid for to mention is, when the class gets up to read\r\nYou give \'em too tight of a reinin\', an\' touch \'em up more than they need;\r\nYou\'re nicer than wise in the matter of holdin\' the book in one han\',\r\nAn\' you turn a stray _g_ in their _doin\'s_, an\' tack an odd _d_\r\n      on their _an\'_;\r\nThere ain\'t no great good comes of speakin\' the words so polite, as I see,\r\nProvidin\' you know what the facts is, an\' tell \'em off jest as they be.\r\nAn\' then there\'s that readin\' in corncert, is censured from first unto\r\n      last;\r\nIt kicks up a heap of a racket, when folks is a-travelin\' past.\r\nWhatever is done as to readin\', providin\' things go to my say,\r\nShan\'t hang on no new-fangled hinges, but swing in the old-fashioned way."\r\nAnd the other four good district fathers gave quick the consent that was\r\n      due,\r\nAnd nodded obliquely, and muttered: "Them \'ere is my sentiments tew."\r\n"Then as to your spellin\': I\'ve heern tell, by the mas has looked into\r\n      this,\r\nThat you turn the _u_ out o\' your _labour_, an\' make the word shorter\r\n      than \'tis;\r\nAn\' clip the _k_ off yer _musick_, which makes my son Ephraim perplexed,\r\nAn\' when he spells out as he ought\'r, you pass the word on to the next.\r\nThey say there\'s some new-grafted books here that don\'t take them letters\r\n      along;\r\nBut if it is so, just depend on \'t, them new-grafted books is made wrong.\r\nYou might just as well say that Jackson didn\'t know all there was about\r\n      war,\r\nAs to say that old Spellin\'-book Webster didn\'t know what them letters was\r\n      for."\r\nAnd the other four good district fathers gave quick the consent that was\r\n      due,\r\nAnd scratched their heads slyly and softly, and said: "Them\'s my sentiments\r\n      tew."\r\n"Then, also, your \'rithmetic doin\'s, as they are reported to me,\r\nIs that you have left Tare an\' Tret out, an\' also the old Rule o\' Three;\r\nAn\' likewise brought in a new study, some high-steppin\' scholars to please,\r\nWith saw-bucks an\' crosses and pothooks, an\' _w\'s, x\'s, y\'s_ an\' _z\'s_.\r\nWe ain\'t got no time for such foolin\'; there ain\'t no great good to be\r\n      reached\r\nBy tiptoein\' childr\'n up higher than ever their fathers was teached."\r\nAnd the other four good district fathers gave quick the consent that was\r\n      due,\r\nAnd cocked one eye up to the ceiling, and said: "Them\'s my sentiments tew."\r\n"Another thing, I must here mention, comes into the question to-day,\r\nConcernin\' some things in the grammar you\'re teachin\' our gals for to say.\r\nMy gals is as steady as clockwork, and never give cause for much fear,\r\nBut they come home from school t\'other evenin\' a-talking such stuff as this\r\n      here:\r\n\'I love,\' an\' \'Thou lovest,\' an\' \'He loves,\' an\' \'We love,\' an\' \'You love,\'\r\n      an\' \'They--\'\r\nAn\' they answered my questions: \'It\'s grammar\'--\'twas all I could get \'em\r\n      to say.\r\nNow if, \'stead of doin\' your duty, you\'re carryin\' matters on so\r\nAs to make the gals say that they love you, it\'s just all that I want to\r\n      know."\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nNow Jim, the young heaven-built mechanic, in the dusk of the evening\r\n      before,\r\nHad well-nigh unjointed the stovepipe, to make it come down on the floor;\r\nAnd the squire bringing smartly his foot down, as a clincher to what he had\r\n      said,\r\nA joint of the pipe fell upon him, and larruped him square on the head.\r\nThe soot flew in clouds all about him, and blotted with black all the place\r\nAnd the squire and the other four fathers were peppered with black in the\r\n      face.\r\nThe school, ever sharp for amusement, laid down all their cumbersome books\r\nAnd, spite of the teacher\'s endeavors, laughed loud at their visitors\'\r\n      looks.\r\nAnd the squire, as he stalked to the doorway, swore oaths of a violet hue;\r\nAnd the four district fathers, who followed, seemed to say: "Them\'s my\r\n      sentiments tew."\r\n\r\n    _Will Carleton._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMother o\' Mine\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I were hanged on the highest hill,\r\n  Mother o\' mine!\r\n  Oh, mother o\' mine!\r\nI know whose love would follow me still;\r\n  Mother o\' mine!\r\n  Oh, mother o\' mine!\r\n\r\nIf I were drowned in the deepest sea,\r\n  Mother o\' mine!\r\n  Oh, mother o\' mine!\r\nI know whose tears would flow down to me,\r\n  Mother o\' mine!\r\n  Oh, mother o\' mine!\r\n\r\nIf I were damned o\' body and soul,\r\n  Mother o\' mine!\r\n  Oh, mother o\' mine!\r\nI know whose prayers would make me whole,\r\n  Mother o\' mine!\r\n  Oh, mother o\' mine!\r\n\r\n    _Rudyard Kipling._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEncouragement\r\n\r\n\r\nWho dat knockin\' at de do\'?\r\nWhy, Ike Johnson--yes, fu\' sho\'!\r\nCome in, Ike.

Dunbar._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Harp That Once Through Tara\'s Halls\r\n\r\n\r\nThe harp that once through Tara\'s halls\r\n  The soul of music shed,\r\nNow hangs as mute on Tara\'s walls\r\n  As if that soul were fled.\r\nSo sleeps the pride of former days,\r\n  So glory\'s thrill is o\'er,\r\nAnd hearts, that once beat high for praise,\r\nNow feel that pulse no more.\r\n\r\nNo more to chiefs and ladies bright\r\n  The harp of Tara swells:\r\nThe chord alone, that breaks at night,\r\n  Its tale of ruin tells.\r\nThus freedom now so seldom wakes,\r\n  The only throb she gives\r\nIs when some heart indignant breaks,\r\n  To show that still she lives.\r\n\r\n    _Thomas Moore._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAux Italiens\r\n\r\n\r\nAt Paris it was, at the opera there;--\r\n  And she looked like a queen in a book that night,\r\nWith the wreath of pearl in her raven hair,\r\n  And the brooch on her breast so bright.\r\n\r\nOf all the operas that Verdi wrote,\r\n  The best, to my taste, is the Trovatore;\r\nAnd Mario can soothe, with a tenor note,\r\n  The souls in purgatory.\r\n\r\nThe moon on the tower slept soft as snow;\r\n  And who was not thrilled in the strangest way,\r\nAs we heard him sing, while the gas burned low,\r\n  _Non ti scordar di me?_[A]\r\n\r\nThe emperor there, in his box of state,\r\n  Looked grave, as if he had just then seen\r\nThe red flag wave from the city gate,\r\n  Where his eagles in bronze had been.\r\n\r\nThe empress, too, had a tear in her eye,\r\n  You\'d have said that her fancy had gone back again,\r\nFor one moment, under the old blue sky,\r\n  To the old glad life in Spain.\r\n\r\nWell, there in our front-row box we sat\r\n  Together, my bride betrothed and I;\r\nMy gaze was fixed on my opera hat,\r\n  And hers on the stage hard by.\r\n\r\nAnd both were silent, and both were sad.\r\n  Like a queen she leaned on her full white arm,\r\nWith that regal, indolent air she had;\r\n  So confident of her charm!\r\n\r\nI have not a doubt she was thinking then\r\n  Of her former lord, good soul that he was!\r\nWho died the richest and roundest of men.\r\n  The Marquis of Carabas.\r\n\r\nI hope that, to get to the kingdom of heaven,\r\n  Through a needle\'s eye he had not to pass;\r\nI wish him well, for the jointure given\r\n  To my Lady of Carabas.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, I was thinking of my first love,\r\n  As I had not been thinking of aught for years,\r\nTill over my eyes there began to move\r\n  Something that felt like tears.\r\n\r\nI thought of the dress that she wore last time,\r\n  When we stood \'neath the cypress trees together,\r\nIn that lost land, in that soft clime,\r\n  In the crimson evening weather:\r\n\r\nOf that muslin dress (for the eve was hot);\r\n  And her warm white neck in its golden chain;\r\nAnd her full soft hair, just tied in a knot,\r\n  And falling loose again;\r\n\r\nAnd the jasmine flower in her fair young breast;\r\n  (Oh, the faint, sweet smell of that jasmine flower!)\r\nAnd the one bird singing alone to his nest;\r\n  And the one star over the tower.\r\n\r\nI thought of our little quarrels and strife,\r\n  And the letter that brought me back my ring;\r\nAnd it all seemed then, in the waste of life,\r\n  Such a very little thing!\r\n\r\nFor I thought of her grave below the hill,\r\n  Which the sentinel cypress tree stands over;\r\nAnd I thought, "Were she only living still,\r\n  How I could forgive her and love her!"\r\n\r\nAnd I swear, as I thought of her thus, in that hour,\r\n  And of how, after all, old things are best,\r\nThat I smelt the smell of that jasmine flower\r\n  Which she used to wear in her breast.\r\n\r\nIt smelt so faint, and it smelt so sweet,\r\n  It made me creep, and it made me cold;\r\nLike the scent that steals from the crumbling sheet\r\n  Where a mummy is half unrolled.\r\n\r\nAnd I turned and looked: she was sitting there,\r\n  In a dim box over the stage, and drest\r\nIn that muslin dress, with that full, soft hair,\r\n  And that jasmine in her breast!\r\n\r\nI was here, and she was there;\r\n  And the glittering horse-shoe curved between:--\r\nFrom my bride betrothed, with her raven hair,\r\n  And her sumptuous, scornful mien,\r\n\r\nTo my early love, with her eyes downcast,\r\n  And over her primrose face the shade,\r\n(In short, from the future back to the past,)\r\n  There was but a step to be made.\r\n\r\nTo my early love from my future bride\r\n  One moment I looked. Then I stole to the door,\r\nI traversed the passage; and down at her side\r\n  I was sitting, a moment more.\r\n\r\nMy thinking of her or the music\'s strain,\r\n  Or something which never will be exprest,\r\nHad brought her back from the grave again,\r\n  With the jasmine in her breast.\r\n\r\nShe is not dead, and she is not wed!\r\n  But she loves me now, and she loved me then!\r\nAnd the very first word that her sweet lips said,\r\n  My heart grew youthful again.\r\n\r\nThe marchioness there, of Carabas,\r\n  She is wealthy, and young, and handsome still;\r\nAnd but for her--well, we\'ll let that pass;\r\n  She may marry whomever she will.\r\n\r\nBut I will marry my own first love,\r\n  With her primrose face, for old things are best;\r\nAnd the flower in her bosom, I prize it above\r\n  The brooch in my lady\'s breast.\r\n\r\nThe world is filled with folly and sin,\r\n  And love must cling where it can, I say:\r\nFor beauty is easy enough to win;\r\n  But one isn\'t loved every day,\r\n\r\nAnd I think in the lives of most women and men,\r\n  There\'s a moment when all would go smooth and even,\r\nIf only the dead could find out when\r\n  To come back, and be forgiven.\r\n\r\nBut oh the smell of that jasmine flower!\r\n  And oh, that music! and oh, the way\r\nThat voice rang out from the donjon tower,\r\n  _Non ti scordar di me_,\r\n    _Non ti scordar di me!_\r\n\r\n    _Robert Bulwer Lytton._\r\n\r\n[Footnote A: A line in the opera "II Trovatore" meaning "Do not forget\r\nme."]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Prairies\r\n\r\n\r\nI love my prairies, they are mine\r\n  From zenith to horizon line,\r\nClipping a world of sky and sod\r\n  Like the bended arm and wrist of God.\r\n\r\nI love their grasses. The skies\r\n  Are larger, and my restless eyes\r\nFasten on more of earth and air\r\n  Than seashore furnishes anywhere.\r\n\r\nI love the hazel thickets; and the breeze,\r\n  The never resting prairie winds. The trees\r\nThat stand like spear points high\r\n  Against the dark blue sky\r\n\r\nAre wonderful to me. I love the gold\r\n  Of newly shaven stubble, rolled\r\nA royal carpet toward the sun, fit to be\r\n  The pathway of a deity.\r\n\r\nI love the life of pasture lands; the songs of birds\r\n  Are not more thrilling to me than the herd\'s\r\nMad bellowing or the shadow stride\r\n  Of mounted herdsmen at my side.\r\n\r\nI love my prairies, they are mine\r\n  From high sun to horizon line.\r\nThe mountains and the cold gray sea\r\n  Are not for me, are not for me.\r\n\r\n    _Hamlin Garland._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHome They Brought Her Warrior Dead\r\n\r\n(_From "The Princess"_)\r\n\r\n\r\nHome they brought her warrior dead:\r\n  She nor swoon\'d, nor utter\'d cry:\r\nAll her maidens, watching, said,\r\n  "She must weep or she will die."\r\nThen they praised him, soft and low,\r\n  Call\'d him worthy to be loved,\r\nTruest friend and noblest foe;\r\n  Yet she neither spoke nor moved.\r\nStole a maiden from her place,\r\n  Lightly to the warrior stept,\r\nTook the face-cloth from the face;\r\n  Yet she neither moved nor wept.\r\nRose a nurse of ninety years,\r\n  Set his child upon her knee--\r\nLike summer tempest came her tears--\r\n  "Sweet my child, I live for thee."\r\n\r\n    _Alfred, Lord Tennyson._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSeptember\r\n\r\n\r\n  Sweet is the voice that calls\r\n  From babbling waterfalls\r\nIn meadows where the downy seeds are flying;\r\n  And soft the breezes blow,\r\n  And eddying come and go\r\nIn faded gardens where the rose is dying.\r\n\r\n  Among the stubbled corn\r\n  The blithe quail pipes at morn,\r\nThe merry partridge drums in hidden places,\r\n  And glittering insects gleam\r\n  Above the reedy stream,\r\nWhere busy spiders spin their filmy laces.\r\n\r\n  At eve, cool shadows fall\r\n  Across the garden wall,\r\nAnd on the clustered grapes to purple turning;\r\n  And pearly vapors lie\r\n  Along the eastern sky,\r\nWhere the broad harvest-moon is redly burning.\r\n\r\n  Ah, soon on field and hill\r\n  The wind shall whistle chill,\r\nAnd patriarch swallows call their flocks together,\r\n  To fly from frost and snow,\r\n  And seek for lands where blow\r\nThe fairer blossoms of a balmier weather.\r\n\r\n  The cricket chirps all day,\r\n  "O fairest summer, stay!"\r\nThe squirrel eyes askance the chestnuts browning;\r\n  The wild fowl fly afar\r\n  Above the foamy bar,\r\nAnd hasten southward ere the skies are frowning.\r\n\r\n  Now comes a fragrant breeze\r\n  Through the dark cedar-trees\r\nAnd round about my temples fondly lingers,\r\n  In gentle playfulness,\r\n  Like to the soft caress\r\nBestowed in happier days by loving fingers.\r\n\r\n  Yet, though a sense of grief\r\n  Comes with the falling leaf,\r\nAnd memory makes the summer doubly pleasant,\r\n  In all my autumn dreams\r\n  A future summer gleams,\r\nPassing the fairest glories of the present!\r\n\r\n    _George Arnold._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Old Kitchen Floor\r\n\r\n\r\nFar back, in my musings, my thoughts have been cast\r\nTo the cot where the hours of my childhood were passed.\r\nI loved all its rooms from the pantry to hall,\r\nBut the blessed old kitchen was dearer than all.\r\nIts chairs and its tables no brighter could be\r\nAnd all its surroundings were sacred to me,\r\nFrom the nail in the ceiling to the latch on the door,\r\nAnd I loved every crack in that old kitchen floor.\r\n\r\nI remember the fireplace with mouth high and wide\r\nAnd the old-fashioned oven that stood by its side\r\nOut of which each Thanksgiving came puddings and pies\r\nAnd they fairly bewildered and dazzled our eyes.\r\nAnd then old St. Nicholas slyly and still\r\nCame down every Christmas our stockings to fill.\r\nBut the dearest of memories laid up in store\r\nIs my mother a-sweeping that old kitchen floor.\r\n\r\nTo-night those old musings come back at their will\r\nBut the wheel and its music forever are still.\r\nThe band is moth-eaten, the wheel laid away,\r\nAnd the fingers that turned it are mold\'ring in clay.\r\nThe hearthstone so sacred is just as \'twas then\r\nAnd the voices of children ring out there again.\r\nThe sun at the window looks in as of yore,\r\nBut it sees other feet on that old kitchen floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRustic Courtship\r\n\r\n\r\nThe night was dark when Sam set out\r\n  To court old Jones\'s daughter;\r\nHe kinder felt as if he must,\r\n  And kinder hadn\'t oughter.\r\nHis heart against his waistcoat throbbed,\r\n  His feelings had a tussle,\r\nWhich nearly conquered him despite\r\n  Six feet of bone and muscle.\r\n\r\nThe candle in the window shone\r\n  With a most doleful glimmer,\r\nAnd Sam he felt his courage ooze,\r\n  And through his fingers simmer.\r\nSays he: "Now, Sam, don\'t be a fool,\r\n  Take courage, shaking doubter,\r\nGo on, and pop the question right,\r\n  For you can\'t live without her."\r\n\r\nBut still, as he drew near the house,\r\n  His knees got in a tremble,\r\nThe beating of his heart ne\'er beat\r\n  His efforts to dissemble.\r\nSays he: "Now, Sam, don\'t be a goose,\r\n  And let the female wimmin\r\nKnock all your thoughts a-skelter so,\r\n  And set your heart a-swimmin\'."\r\n\r\nSo Sam, he kinder raised the latch,\r\n  His courage also raising,\r\nAnd in a moment he sat inside,\r\n  Cid Jones\'s crops a-praising.\r\nHe tried awhile to talk the farm\r\n  In words half dull, half witty,\r\nNot knowing that old Jones well knew\r\n  His only thought was--Kitty.\r\n\r\nAt last the old folks went to bed--\r\n  The Joneses were but human;\r\nOld Jones was something of a man,\r\n  And Mrs. Jones--a woman.\r\nAnd Kitty she the pitcher took,\r\n  And started for the cellar;\r\nIt wasn\'t often that she had\r\n  So promising a feller.\r\n\r\nAnd somehow when she came upstairs,\r\n  And Sam had drank his cider,\r\nThere seemed a difference in the chairs,\r\n  And Sam was close beside her;\r\nHis stalwart arm dropped round her waist,\r\n  Her head dropped on his shoulder,\r\nAnd Sam--well, he had changed his tune\r\nAnd grown a trifle bolder.\r\n\r\nBut this, if you live long enough,\r\n  You surely will discover,\r\nThere\'s nothing in this world of ours\r\n  Except the loved and lover.\r\nThe morning sky was growing gray\r\n  As Sam the farm was leaving,\r\nHis face was surely not the face\r\n  Of one half grieved, or grieving.\r\n\r\nAnd Kitty she walked smiling back,\r\n  With blushing face, and slowly;\r\nThere\'s something in the humblest love\r\n  That makes it pure and holy.\r\nAnd did he marry her, you ask?\r\n  She stands there with the ladle\r\nA-skimming of the morning\'s milk--\r\n  That\'s Sam who rocks the cradle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Red Jacket\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Tis a cold, bleak night! with angry roar\r\nThe north winds beat and clamor at the door;\r\nThe drifted snow lies heaped along the street,\r\nSwept by a blinding storm of hail and sleet;\r\nThe clouded heavens no guiding starlight lend\r\nBut o\'er the earth in gloom and darkness bend;\r\nGigantic shadows, by the night lamps thrown,\r\nDance their weird revels fitfully alone.\r\n\r\nIn lofty halls, where fortune takes its ease,\r\nSunk in the treasures of all lands and seas;\r\nIn happy homes, where warmth and comfort meet\r\nThe weary traveler with their smiles to greet;\r\nIn lowly dwellings, where the needy swarm\r\nRound starving embers, chilling limbs to warm,\r\nRises the prayer that makes the sad heart light--\r\n"Thank God for home, this bitter, bitter night!"\r\n\r\nBut hark! above the beating of the storm\r\nPeals on the startled ear the fire alarm.\r\nYon gloomy heaven\'s aflame with sudden light,\r\nAnd heart-beats quicken with a strange affright;\r\nFrom tranquil slumbers springs, at duty\'s call,\r\nThe ready friend no danger can appall;\r\nFierce for the conflict, sturdy, true, and brave,\r\nHe hurries forth to battle and to save.\r\n\r\nFrom yonder dwelling, fiercely shooting out,\r\nDevouring all they coil themselves about,\r\nThe flaming furies, mounting high and higher,\r\nWrap the frail structure in a cloak of fire.\r\nStrong arms are battling with the stubborn foe\r\nIn vain attempts their power to overthrow;\r\nWith mocking glee they revel with their prey,\r\nDefying human skill to check their way.\r\n\r\nAnd see! far up above the flame\'s hot breath,\r\nSomething that\'s human waits a horrid death;\r\nA little child, with waving golden hair,\r\nStands, like a phantom, \'mid the horrid glare,--\r\nHer pale, sweet face against the window pressed,\r\nWhile sobs of terror shake her tender breast.\r\nAnd from the crowd beneath, in accents wild,\r\nA mother screams, "O God! my child! my child!"\r\n\r\nUp goes a ladder. Through the startled throng\r\nA hardy fireman swiftly moves along;\r\nMounts sure and fast along the slender way,\r\nFearing no danger, dreading but delay.\r\nThe stifling smoke-clouds lower in his path,\r\nSharp tongues of flame assail him in their wrath;\r\nBut up, still up he goes! the goal is won!\r\nHis strong arm beats the sash, and he is gone!\r\n\r\nGone to his death. The wily flames surround\r\nAnd burn and beat his ladder to the ground,\r\nIn flaming columns move with quickened beat\r\nTo rear a massive wall \'gainst his retreat.\r\nCourageous heart, thy mission was so pure,\r\nSuffering humanity must thy loss deplore;\r\nHenceforth with martyred heroes thou shalt live,\r\nCrowned with all honors nobleness can give.\r\n\r\nNay, not so fast; subdue these gloomy fears;\r\nBehold! he quickly on the roof appears,\r\nBearing the tender child, his jacket warm\r\nFlung round her shrinking form to guard from harm,\r\nUp with your ladders! Quick! \'tis but a chance!\r\nBehold, how fast the roaring flames advance!\r\nQuick! quick! brave spirits, to his rescue fly;\r\nUp! up! by heavens, this hero must not die!\r\n\r\nSilence! he comes along the burning road,\r\nBearing, with tender care, his living load;\r\nAha! he totters! Heaven in mercy save\r\nThe good, true heart that can so nobly brave!\r\nHe\'s up again! and now he\'s coming fast--\r\nOne moment, and the fiery ordeal\'s passed--\r\nAnd now he\'s safe! Bold flames, ye fought in vain.\r\nA happy mother clasps her child again.\r\n\r\n    _George M. Baker._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJohn Maynard\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Twas on Lake Erie\'s broad expanse\r\n  One bright midsummer day,\r\nThe gallant steamer Ocean Queen\r\n  Swept proudly on her way.\r\nBright faces clustered on the deck,\r\n  Or, leaning o\'er the side,\r\nWatched carelessly the feathery foam\r\n  That flecked the rippling tide.\r\n\r\nAh, who beneath that cloudless sky,\r\n  That smiling bends serene,\r\nCould dream that danger, awful, vast,\r\n  Impended o\'er the scene;\r\nCould dream that ere an hour had sped\r\n  That frame of sturdy oak\r\nWould sink beneath the lake\'s blue waves,\r\n  Blackened with fire and smoke?\r\n\r\nA seaman sought the captain\'s side,\r\n  A moment whispered low;\r\nThe captain\'s swarthy face grew pale;\r\n  He hurried down below.\r\nAlas, too late! Though quick, and sharp,\r\n  And clear his orders came,\r\nNo human efforts could avail\r\n  To quench th\' insidious flame.\r\n\r\nThe bad news quickly reached the deck,\r\n  It sped from lip to lip,\r\nAnd ghastly faces everywhere\r\n  Looked from the doomed ship.\r\n"Is there no hope, no chance of life?"\r\n  A hundred lips implore;\r\n"But one," the captain made reply,\r\n  "To run the ship on shore."\r\n\r\nA sailor, whose heroic soul\r\n  That hour should yet reveal,\r\nBy name John Maynard, eastern-born,\r\n  Stood calmly at the wheel.\r\n"Head her southeast!" the captain shouts,\r\n  Above the smothered roar,\r\n"Head her southeast without delay!\r\n  Make for the nearest shore!"\r\n\r\nNo terror pales the helmsman\'s cheek,\r\n  Or clouds his dauntless eye,\r\nAs, in a sailor\'s measured tone,\r\n  His voice responds, "Ay! ay!"\r\nThree hundred souls, the steamer\'s freight,\r\n  Crowd forward wild with fear,\r\nWhile at the stern the dreaded flames\r\n  Above the deck appear.\r\n\r\nJohn Maynard watched the nearing flames,\r\n  But still with steady hand\r\nHe grasped the wheel, and steadfastly\r\n  He steered the ship to land.\r\n"John Maynard, can you still hold out?"\r\n  He heard the captain cry;\r\nA voice from out the stifling smoke\r\n  Faintly responds, "Ay! ay!"\r\n\r\nBut half a mile! a hundred hands\r\n  Stretch eagerly to shore.\r\nBut half a mile! That distance sped\r\n  Peril shall all be o\'er.\r\nBut half a mile! Yet stay, the flames\r\n  No longer slowly creep,\r\nBut gather round that helmsman bold,\r\n  With fierce, impetuous sweep.\r\n\r\n"John Maynard!" with an anxious voice\r\n  The captain cries once more,\r\n"Stand by the wheel five minutes yet,\r\n  And we shall reach the shore."\r\nThrough flame and smoke that dauntless heart\r\n  Responded firmly still,\r\nUnawed, though face to face with death,\r\n  "With God\'s good help I will!"\r\n\r\nThe flames approach with giant strides,\r\n  They scorch his hand and brow;\r\nOne arm, disabled, seeks his side,\r\n  Ah! he is conquered now.\r\nBut no, his teeth are firmly set,\r\n  He crushes down his pain,\r\nHis knee upon the stanchion pressed,\r\n  He guides the ship again.\r\n\r\nOne moment yet! one moment yet!\r\n  Brave heart, thy task is o\'er,\r\nThe pebbles grate beneath the keel,\r\n  The steamer touches shore.\r\nThree hundred grateful voices rise\r\n  In praise to God that He\r\nHath saved them from the fearful fire,\r\n  And from the engulfing sea.\r\n\r\nBut where is he, that helmsman bold?\r\n  The captain saw him reel,\r\nHis nerveless hands released their task,\r\n  He sank beside the wheel.\r\nThe wave received his lifeless corse,\r\n  Blackened with smoke and fire.\r\nGod rest him! Never hero had\r\n  A nobler funeral pyre!\r\n\r\n    _Horatio Alger, Jr._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPiller Fights\r\n\r\n\r\nPiller fights is fun, I tell you;\r\nThere isn\'t anything I\'d rather do\r\nThan get a big piller and hold it tight,\r\nStand up in bed and then just fight.\r\n\r\nUs boys allers have our piller fights\r\nAnd the best night of all is Pa\'s lodge night.\r\nSoon as ever he goes, we say "Good night,"\r\nThen go right upstairs for a piller fight.\r\n\r\nSometimes maybe Ma comes to the stairs\r\nAnd hollers up, "Boys, have you said your prayers?"\r\nAnd then George will holler "Yes, Mamma," for he always has;\r\nGood deal of preacher about George, Pa says.\r\n\r\nMa says "Pleasant dreams," and shuts the door;\r\nIf she\'s a-listenin\' both of us snore,\r\nBut as soon as ever she goes we light a light\r\nAnd pitch right into our piller fight.\r\n\r\nWe play that the bed is Bunker Hill\r\nAnd George is Americans, so he stands still.\r\nBut I am the British, so I must hit\r\nAs hard as ever I can to make him git.\r\nWe played Buena Vista one night--\r\nTell you, that was an awful hard fight!\r\n\r\nHeld up our pillers like they was a flag,\r\nAn\' hollered, "Little more grape-juice, Captain Bragg!"\r\nThat was the night that George hit the nail--\r\nYou just ought to have seen those feathers sail!\r\n\r\nI was covered as white as flour,\r\nMe and him picked them up for \'most an hour;\r\nNext day when our ma saw that there mess\r\nShe was pretty mad, you better guess;\r\n\r\nAnd she told our pa, and he just said,\r\n"Come right on out to this here shed."\r\nTell you, he whipped us till we were sore\r\nAnd made us both promise to do it no more.\r\n\r\nThat was a long time ago, and now lodge nights\r\nOr when Pa\'s away we have piller fights,\r\nBut in Buena Vista George is bound\r\nTo see there aren\'t any nails anywhere \'round.\r\n\r\nPiller fights is fun, I tell you;\r\nThere isn\'t anything I\'d rather do\r\nThan get a big piller and hold it tight,\r\nStand up in bed, and then just fight.\r\n\r\n    _D.A.

Job hed nothin\' to try\r\n    him!\r\nEf he\'d been married to \'Bijah Brown, folks wouldn\'t have dared come\r\n    nigh him.\r\nTrials, indeed! Now I\'ll tell you what--ef you want to be sick of your\r\n      life,\r\nJest come and change places with me a spell--for I\'m an inventor\'s wife.\r\nAnd such inventions! I\'m never sure, when I take up my coffee-pot,\r\nThat \'Bijah hain\'t been "improvin\'" it and it mayn\'t go off like a shot.\r\nWhy, didn\'t he make me a cradle once, that would keep itself a-rockin\';\r\nAnd didn\'t it pitch the baby out, and wasn\'t his head bruised shockin\'?\r\nAnd there was his "Patent Peeler," too--a wonderful thing, I\'ll say;\r\nBut it hed one fault-it never stopped till the apple was peeled away.\r\nAs for locks and clocks, and mowin\' machines and reapers, and all such\r\n    trash,\r\nWhy, \'Bijah\'s invented heaps of \'em but they don\'t bring in no cash.\r\nLaw! that don\'t worry him--not at all; he\'s the most aggravatin\'est man--\r\nHe\'ll set in his little workshop there, and whistle, and think, and plan,\r\nInventin\' a jew\'s-harp to go by steam, or a new-fangled powder-horn,\r\nWhile the children\'s goin\' barefoot to school and the weeds is chokin\'\r\n    our corn.\r\nWhen \'Bijah and me kep\' company, he warn\'t like this, you know;\r\nOur folks all thought he was dreadful smart--but that was years ago.\r\nHe was handsome as any pictur then, and he had such a glib, bright way--\r\nI never thought that a time would come when I\'d rue my weddin\' day;\r\nBut when I\'ve been forced to chop wood, and tend to the farm beside,\r\nAnd look at Bijah a-settin\' there, I\'ve jest dropped down and cried.\r\nWe lost the hull of our turnip crop while he was inventin\' a gun\r\nBut I counted it one of my marcies when it bu\'st before \'twas done.\r\nSo he turned it into a "burglar alarm." It ought to give thieves a fright--\r\n\'Twould scare an honest man out of his wits, ef he sot it off at night.\r\nSometimes I wonder if \'Bijah\'s crazy, he does sech cur\'ous things.\r\nHev I told you about his bedstead yit?--\'Twas full of wheels and springs;\r\nIt hed a key to wind it up, and a clock face at the head;\r\nAll you did was to turn them hands, and at any hour you said,\r\nThat bed got up and shook itself, and bounced you on the floor,\r\nAnd then shet up, jest like a box, so you couldn\'t sleep any more.\r\nWa\'al, \'Bijah he fixed it all complete, and he sot it at half-past five,\r\nBut he hadn\'t mor\'n got into it when--dear me! sakes alive!\r\nThem wheels began to whiz and whir! I heered a fearful snap!\r\nAnd there was that bedstead, with \'Bijah inside, shet up jest like a trap!\r\nI screamed, of course, but \'twan\'t no use, then I worked that hull long\r\n    night\r\nA-trying to open the pesky thing. At last I got in a fright;\r\nI couldn\'t hear his voice inside, and I thought he might be dyin\';\r\nSo I took a crow-bar and smashed it in.--There was \'Bijah peacefully\r\n    lyin\',\r\nInventin\' a way to git out agin. That was all very well to say,\r\nBut I don\'t b\'lieve he\'d have found it out if I\'d left him in all day.\r\nNow, sence I\'ve told you my story, do you wonder I\'m tired of life?\r\nOr think it strange I often wish I warn\'t an inventor\'s wife?\r\n\r\n    _Mrs. E.T.

Thou,\r\nWhom the rich heavens did so endow\r\nWith eyes of power and Jove\'s own brow,\r\nWith all the massive strength that fills\r\nThy home-horizon\'s granite hills,\r\nWith rarest gifts of heart and head\r\nFrom manliest stock inherited--\r\nNew England\'s stateliest type of man,\r\nIn port and speech Olympian;\r\nWhom no one met, at first, but took\r\nA second awed and wondering look\r\n(As turned, perchance, the eyes of Greece\r\nOn Phidias\' unveiled masterpiece);\r\nWhose words, in simplest home-spun clad,\r\nThe Saxon strength of Caedmon\'s had,\r\nWith power reserved at need to reach\r\nThe Roman forum\'s loftiest speech,\r\nSweet with persuasion, eloquent\r\nIn passion, cool in argument,\r\nOr, ponderous, falling on thy foes\r\nAs fell the Norse god\'s hammer blows.\r\nCrushing as if with Talus\' flail\r\nThrough Error\'s logic-woven mail,\r\nAnd failing only when they tried\r\nThe adamant of the righteous side,--\r\nThou, foiled in aim and hope, bereaved\r\nOf old friends, by the new deceived,\r\nToo soon for us, too soon for thee,\r\nBeside thy lonely Northern sea,\r\nWhere long and low the marsh-lands spread,\r\nLaid wearily down thy august head.\r\n\r\nThou shouldst have lived to feel below\r\nThy feet Disunion\'s fierce upthrow,--\r\nThe late-sprung mine that underlaid\r\nThy sad concessions vainly made.\r\nThou shouldst have seen from Sumter\'s wall\r\nThe star-flag of the Union fall,\r\nAnd armed Rebellion pressing on\r\nThe broken lines of Washington!\r\nNo stronger voice than thine had then\r\nCalled out the utmost might of men,\r\nTo make the Union\'s charter free\r\nAnd strengthen law by liberty.\r\nHow had that stern arbitrament\r\nTo thy gray age youth\'s vigor lent,\r\nShaming ambition\'s paltry prize\r\nBefore thy disillusioned eyes;\r\nBreaking the spell about thee wound\r\nLike the green withes that Samson bound;\r\nRedeeming, in one effort grand,\r\nThyself and thy imperiled land!\r\nAh cruel fate, that closed to thee,\r\nO sleeper by the Northern sea,\r\nThe gates of opportunity!\r\nGod fills the gaps of human need,\r\nEach crisis brings its word and deed.\r\nWise men and strong we did not lack;\r\nBut still, with memory turning back,\r\nIn the dark hours we thought of thee,\r\nAnd thy lone grave beside the sea.\r\n\r\nAbove that grave the east winds blow,\r\nAnd from the marsh-lands drifting slow\r\nThe sea-fog comes, with evermore\r\nThe wave-wash of a lonely shore,\r\nAnd sea-bird\'s melancholy cry,\r\nAs Nature fain would typify\r\nThe sadness of a closing scene,\r\nThe loss of that which should have been.\r\nBut, where thy native mountains bare\r\nTheir foreheads to diviner air,\r\nFit emblem of enduring fame,\r\nOne lofty summit keeps thy name.\r\nFor thee the cosmic forces did\r\nThe rearing of that pyramid,\r\nThe prescient ages shaping with\r\nFire, flood, and frost thy monolith.\r\nSunrise and sunset lay thereon\r\nWith hands of light their benison,\r\nThe stars of midnight pause to set\r\nTheir jewels in its coronet.\r\nAnd evermore that mountain mass\r\nSeems climbing from the shadowy pass\r\nTo light, as if to manifest\r\nThy nobler self, they life at best!\r\n\r\n    _John G. Whittier._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Flower of Liberty\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat flower is this that greets the morn,\r\nIts hues from Heaven so freshly born?\r\nWith burning star and flaming band\r\nIt kindles all the sunset land:\r\nO tell us what its name may be,--\r\nIs this the Flower of Liberty?\r\n    It is the banner of the free,\r\n    The starry Flower of Liberty!\r\n\r\nIn savage Nature\'s far abode\r\nIts tender seed our fathers sowed;\r\nThe storm-winds rocked its swelling bud,\r\nIts opening leaves were streaked with blood,\r\nTill lo! earth\'s tyrants shook to see\r\nThe full-blown Flower of Liberty!\r\n    Then hail the banner of the free,\r\n    The starry Flower of Liberty!\r\n\r\nBehold its streaming rays unite,\r\nOne mingling flood of braided light--\r\nThe red that fires the Southern rose,\r\nWith spotless white from Northern snows,\r\nAnd, spangled o\'er its azure, see\r\nThe sister Stars of Liberty!\r\n    Then hail the banner of the free,\r\n    The starry Flower of Liberty!\r\n\r\nThe blades of heroes fence it round,\r\nWhere\'er it springs is holy ground;\r\nFrom tower and dome its glories spread;\r\nIt waves where lonely sentries tread;\r\nIt makes the land as ocean free,\r\nAnd plants an empire on the sea!\r\n    Then hail the banner of the free,\r\n    The starry Flower of Liberty!\r\n\r\nThy sacred leaves, fair Freedom\'s flower,\r\nShall ever float on dome and tower,\r\nTo all their heavenly colors true,\r\nIn blackening frost or crimson dew,--\r\nAnd God love us as we love thee,\r\nThrice holy Flower of Liberty!\r\n    Then hail the banner of the free,\r\n    The starry Flower of Liberty!\r\n\r\n    _Oliver Wendell Holmes._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Lamb\r\n\r\n\r\n  Little lamb, who made thee?\r\n  Dost thou know who made thee,\r\nGave thee life, and made thee feed\r\nBy the stream and o\'er the mead?\r\nGave thee clothing of delight,--\r\nSoftest clothing, woolly, bright?\r\nGave thee such a tender voice,\r\nMaking all the vales rejoice?\r\n  Little lamb, who made thee?\r\n  Dost thou know who made thee?\r\n\r\n  Little lamb, I\'ll tell thee;\r\n  Little lamb, I\'ll tell thee;\r\nHe is called by thy name,\r\nFor he calls himself a lamb.\r\nHe is meek and He is mild;\r\nHe became a little child:\r\nI a child, and thou a lamb,\r\nWe are called by His name.\r\n  Little lamb, God bless thee!\r\n  Little lamb, God bless thee!\r\n\r\n    _William Blake._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Roll Call\r\n\r\n\r\n"Corporal Green!" the orderly cried;\r\n  "Here!" was the answer, loud and clear,\r\n  From the lips of the soldier standing near,\r\nAnd "Here" was the answer the next replied.\r\n\r\n"Cyrus Drew!"--then a silence fell--\r\n  This time no answer followed the call,\r\n  Only the rear man had seen him fall,\r\nKilled or wounded he could not tell.\r\n\r\nThere they stood in the failing light,\r\n  These men of battle, with grave dark looks,\r\n  As plain to be read as open books,\r\nWhile slowly gathered the shades of night.\r\n\r\nThe fern on the hillside was splashed with blood,\r\n  And down in the corn, where the poppies grew\r\n  Were redder stains than the poppies knew\r\nAnd crimson-dyed was the river\'s flood.\r\n\r\n"Herbert Kline!" At the call there came\r\n  Two stalwart soldiers into the line,\r\n  Bearing between them Herbert Kline,\r\nWounded and bleeding, to answer his name.\r\n\r\n"Ezra Kerr!"--and a voice said "Here!"\r\n  "Hiram Kerr!"--but no man replied.\r\n  They were brothers, these two; the sad winds sighed,\r\nAnd a shudder crept through the cornfield near.\r\n\r\n"Ephraim Deane!" then a soldier spoke;\r\n  "Deane carried our regiment\'s colors," he said;\r\n  "Where our ensign was shot, I left him dead,\r\nJust after the enemy wavered and broke.\r\n\r\n"Close by the roadside his body lies;\r\n  I paused a moment and gave him a drink,\r\n  He murmured his mother\'s name I think,\r\nAnd Death came with it and closed his eyes."\r\n\r\n\'Twas a victory; yes, but it cost us dear--\r\n  For that company\'s roll when called that night,\r\n  Of a hundred men who went into the fight,\r\nNumbered but twenty that answered "Here!"\r\n\r\n    _N.G. Shepherd._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Prayer for a Little Home\r\n\r\n\r\nGod send us a little home\r\nTo come back to when we roam--\r\nLow walls and fluted tiles,\r\nWide windows, a view for miles;\r\nRed firelight and deep chairs;\r\nSmall white beds upstairs;\r\nGreat talk in little nooks;\r\nDim colors, rows of books;\r\nOne picture on each wall;\r\nNot many things at all.\r\nGod send us a little ground--\r\nTall trees standing round,\r\nHomely flowers in brown sod,\r\nOverhead, Thy stars, O God!\r\nGod bless, when winds blow,\r\nOur home and all we know.\r\n\r\n    _London "Spectator."_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI Have Drank My Last Glass\r\n\r\n\r\nNo, comrades, I thank you--not any for me;\r\nMy last chain is riven--henceforward I\'m free!\r\nI will go to my home and my children to-night\r\nWith no fumes of liquor their spirits to blight;\r\nAnd, with tears in my eyes, I will beg my poor wife\r\nTo forgive me the wreck I have made of her life.\r\n_I have never refused you before?_ Let that pass,\r\n  For I\'ve drank my last glass, boys,\r\n  I have drank my last glass.\r\n\r\nJust look at me now, boys, in rags and disgrace,\r\nWith my bleared, haggard eyes, and my red, bloated face;\r\nMark my faltering step and my weak, palsied hand,\r\nAnd the mark on my brow that is worse than Cain\'s brand;\r\nSee my crownless old hat, and my elbows and knees,\r\nAlike, warmed by the sun, or chilled by the breeze.\r\nWhy, even the children will hoot as I pass;--\r\n  But I\'ve drank my last glass, boys,\r\n  I have drank my last glass.\r\n\r\nYou would hardly believe, boys, to look at me now\r\nThat a mother\'s soft hand was pressed on my brow--\r\nWhen she kissed me, and blessed me, her darling, her pride,\r\nEre she lay down to rest by my dead father\'s side;\r\nBut with love in her eyes, she looked up to the sky\r\nBidding me meet her there and whispered "Good-bye."\r\nAnd I\'ll do it, God helping! Your _smile_ I let pass,\r\n  For I\'ve drank my last glass, boys,\r\n  I have drank my last glass.\r\n\r\nAh! I reeled home last night, it was not very late,\r\nFor I\'d spent my last sixpence, and landlords won\'t wait\r\nOn a fellow who\'s left every cent in their till,\r\nAnd has pawned his last bed, their coffers to fill.\r\nOh, the torments I felt, and the pangs I endured!\r\nAnd I begged for one glass--just one would have cured,--\r\nBut they kicked me out doors! I let that, too, pass,\r\n  For I\'ve drank my last glass, boys,\r\n  I have drank my last glass.\r\n\r\nAt home, my pet Susie, with her rich golden hair,\r\nI saw through the window, just kneeling in prayer;\r\nFrom her pale, bony hands, her torn sleeves hung down,\r\nAnd her feet, cold and bare, shrank beneath her scant gown,\r\nAnd she prayed--prayed for _bread_, just a poor crust of bread,\r\nFor one crust, on her knees my pet darling plead!\r\nAnd I heard, with no penny to buy one, alas!\r\n  For I\'ve drank my last glass, boys,\r\n  I have drank my last glass.\r\n\r\nFor Susie, my darling, my wee six-year-old,\r\nThough fainting with hunger and shivering with cold,\r\nThere, on the bare floor, asked God to bless _me_!\r\nAnd she said, "Don\'t cry, mamma! He will; for you see,\r\nI _believe_ what I ask for!" Then sobered, I crept\r\nAway from the house; and that night, when I slept,\r\nNext my heart lay the PLEDGE! You smile! let it pass,\r\n  For I\'ve drank my last glass, boys\r\n  I have drank my last glass.\r\n\r\nMy darling child saved me! Her faith and her love\r\nAre akin to my dear sainted mother\'s above!\r\nI will make my words true, or I\'ll die in the race,\r\nAnd sober I\'ll go to my last resting place;\r\nAnd she shall kneel there, and, weeping, thank God\r\nNo _drunkard_ lies under the daisy-strewn sod!\r\nNot a drop more of poison my lips shall e\'er pass,\r\n  For I\'ve drank my last glass, boys,\r\n  I have drank my last glass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHighland Mary\r\n\r\n\r\nYe banks, and braes, and streams around\r\n  The castle o\' Montgomery,\r\nGreen be your woods, and fair your flowers,\r\n  Your waters never drumlie!\r\nThere simmer first unfauld her robes,\r\n  And there the langest tarry;\r\nFor there I took the last fareweel\r\n  O\' my sweet Highland Mary.\r\n\r\nHow sweetly bloom\'d the gay green birk,\r\n  How rich the hawthorn\'s blossom,\r\nAs, underneath their fragrant shade,\r\n  I clasp\'d her to my bosom!\r\nThe golden hours, on angel wings,\r\n  Flew o\'er me and my dearie;\r\nFor dear to me as light and life\r\n  Was my sweet Highland Mary!\r\n\r\nWi\' mony a vow, and lock\'d embrace,\r\n  Our parting was fu\' tender;\r\nAnd, pledging aft to meet again,\r\n  We tore oursels asunder;\r\nBut, oh, fell death\'s untimely frost,\r\n  That nipp\'d my flower sae early!\r\nNow green\'s the sod and cauld\'s the clay,\r\n  That wraps my Highland Mary!\r\n\r\nOh, pale, pale now, those rosy lips,\r\n  I aft ha\'e kiss\'d, sae fondly!\r\nAnd closed for aye the sparkling glance\r\n  That dwalt on me sae kindly!\r\nAnd mouldering now in silent dust,\r\n  That heart that lo\'ed me dearly;\r\nBut still within my bosom\'s core\r\n  Shall live my Highland Mary!\r\n\r\n    _Robert Burns._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Night with a Wolf\r\n\r\n\r\nLittle one, come to my knee!\r\n  Hark, how the rain is pouring\r\nOver the roof, in the pitch-black night,\r\n  And the wind in the woods a-roaring!\r\n\r\nHush, my darling, and listen,\r\n  Then pay for the story with kisses;\r\nFather was lost in the pitch-black night,\r\n  In just such a storm as this is!\r\n\r\nHigh up on the lonely mountains,\r\n  Where the wild men watched and waited\r\nWolves in the forest, and bears in the bush,\r\n  And I on my path belated.\r\n\r\nThe rain and the night together\r\n  Came down, and the wind came after,\r\nBending the props of the pine-tree roof,\r\n  And snapping many a rafter.\r\n\r\nI crept along in the darkness,\r\n  Stunned, and bruised, and blinded,--\r\nCrept to a fir with thick-set boughs,\r\n  And a sheltering rock behind it.\r\n\r\nThere, from the blowing and raining\r\n  Crouching, I sought to hide me:\r\nSomething rustled, two green eyes shone,\r\n  And a wolf lay down beside me.\r\n\r\nLittle one, be not frightened;\r\n  I and the wolf together,\r\nSide by side, through the long, long night\r\n  Hid from the awful weather.\r\n\r\nHis wet fur pressed against me;\r\n  Each of us warmed the other;\r\nEach of us felt, in the stormy dark,\r\n  That beast and man was brother.\r\n\r\nAnd when the falling forest\r\n  No longer crashed in warning,\r\nEach of us went from our hiding-place\r\n  Forth in the wild, wet morning.\r\n\r\nDarling, kiss me in payment!\r\n  Hark, how the wind is roaring;\r\nFather\'s house is a better place\r\n  When the stormy rain is pouring!\r\n\r\n    _Bayard Taylor._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe Was a Phantom of Delight\r\n\r\n\r\nShe was a Phantom of delight\r\nWhen first she gleamed upon my sight;\r\nA lovely Apparition sent\r\nTo be a moment\'s ornament;\r\nHer eyes as stars of Twilight fair;\r\nLike Twilight\'s, too, her dusky hair;\r\nBut all things else about her drawn\r\nFrom May-time and the cheerful Dawn;\r\nA dancing Shape, an Image gay,\r\nTo haunt, to startle, and way-lay.\r\n\r\nI saw her upon nearer view,\r\nA Spirit, yet a Woman too!\r\nHer household motions light and free,\r\nAnd steps of virgin-liberty;\r\nA countenance in which did meet\r\nSweet records, promises as sweet;\r\nA Creature not too bright or good\r\nFor human nature\'s daily food;\r\nFor transient sorrows, simple wiles,\r\nPraise, blame, love, kisses, tears and smiles.\r\n\r\nAnd now I see with eye serene\r\nThe very pulse of the machine;\r\nA Being breathing thoughtful breath,\r\nA Traveler between life and death;\r\nThe reason firm, the temperate will,\r\nEndurance, foresight, strength, and skill;\r\nA perfect Woman, nobly planned,\r\nTo warn, to comfort, and command;\r\nAnd yet a Spirit still, and bright\r\nWith something of angelic light.\r\n\r\n    _William Wordsworth._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Rhodora\r\n\r\n(_On Being Asked Whence Is The Flower_)\r\n\r\n\r\nIn May, when sea-winds pierced our solitudes,\r\nI found the fresh Rhodora in the woods,\r\nSpreading its leafless blooms in a damp nook,\r\nTo please the desert and the sluggish brook.\r\nThe purple petals, fallen in the pool,\r\nMade the black water with their beauty gay;\r\nHere might the red-bird come his plumes to cool,\r\nAnd court the flower that cheapens his array.\r\nRhodora! if the sages ask thee why\r\nThis charm is wasted on the earth and sky,\r\nTell them, dear, that if eyes were made for seeing,\r\nThen Beauty is its own excuse for being:\r\nWhy thou wert there, O rival of the rose!\r\nI never thought to ask, I never knew:\r\nBut, in my simple ignorance, suppose\r\nThe self-same Power that brought me there brought you.\r\n\r\n    _Ralph Waldo Emerson._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere Was a Boy\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a Boy; ye knew him well, ye cliffs\r\nAnd islands of Winander!--many a time,\r\nAt evening, when the earliest stars began\r\nTo move along the edges of the hills,\r\nRising or setting, would he stand alone,\r\nBeneath the trees, or by the glimmering lake;\r\nAnd there, with fingers interwoven, both hands\r\nPressed closely palm to palm and to his mouth\r\nUplifted, he, as through an instrument,\r\nBlew mimic hootings to the silent owls,\r\nThat they might answer him,--And they would shout\r\nAcross the watery vale, and shout again,\r\nResponsive to his call,--with quivering peals,\r\nAnd long halloos, and screams, and echoes loud\r\nRedoubled and redoubled; concourse wild\r\nOf jocund din! and, when there came a pause\r\nOf silence such as baffled his best skill,\r\nThen, sometimes, in that silence, while he hung\r\nListening, a gentle shock of mild surprise\r\nHas carried far into his heart the voice\r\nOf mountain-torrents; or the visible scene\r\nWould enter unawares into his mind\r\nWith all its solemn imagery, its rocks,\r\nIts woods, and that uncertain heaven received\r\nInto the bosom of the steady lake.\r\nThis boy was taken from his mates, and died\r\nIn childhood, ere he was full twelve years old.\r\nPre-eminent in beauty is the vale\r\nWhere he was born and bred: the church-yard hangs\r\nUpon a slope above the village-school;\r\nAnd through that church-yard when my way has led\r\nOn Summer-evenings, I believe, that there\r\nA long half-hour together I have stood\r\nMute--looking at the grave in which he lies!\r\n\r\n    _William Wordsworth._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Quangle Wangle\'s Hat\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the top of the Crumpetty Tree\r\n  The Quangle Wangle sat,\r\nBut his face you could not see,\r\n  On account of his Beaver Hat.\r\nFor his hat was a hundred and two feet wide,\r\nWith ribbons and bibbons on every side,\r\nAnd bells, and buttons, and loops, and lace,\r\nSo that nobody ever could see the face\r\n  Of the Quangle Wangle Quee.\r\n\r\nThe Quangle Wangle said\r\n  To himself on the Crumpetty Tree,\r\n"Jam, and jelly, and bread\r\n  Are the best of food for me!\r\nBut the longer I live on this Crumpetty Tree\r\nThe plainer than ever it seems to me\r\nThat very few people come this way\r\nAnd that life on the whole is far from gay!"\r\n  Said the Quangle Wangle Quee.\r\n\r\nBut there came to the Crumpetty Tree\r\n  Mr. and Mrs. Canary;\r\nAnd they said, "Did ever you see\r\n  Any spot so charmingly airy?\r\nMay we build a nest on your lovely Hat?\r\nMr. Quangle Wangle, grant us that!\r\nOh, please let us come and build a nest\r\nOf whatever material suits you best,\r\n  Mr. Quangle Wangle Quee!"\r\n\r\nAnd besides, to the Crumpetty Tree\r\n  Came the Stork, the Duck, and the Owl;\r\nThe Snail and the Bumblebee,\r\n  The Frog and the Fimble Fowl\r\n(The Fimble Fowl, with a corkscrew leg);\r\nAnd all of them said, "We humbly beg\r\nWe may build our homes on your lovely Hat,--\r\nMr. Quangle Wangle, grant us that!\r\n  Mr. Quangle Wangle Quee!"\r\n\r\nAnd the Golden Grouse came there,\r\n  And the Pobble who has no toes,\r\nAnd the small Olympian bear,\r\n  And the Dong with a luminous nose.\r\nAnd the Blue Baboon who played the flute,\r\nAnd the Orient Calf from the Land of Tute,\r\nAnd the Attery Squash, and the Bisky Bat,--\r\nAll came and built on the lovely Hat\r\n  Of the Quangle Wangle Quee.\r\n\r\nAnd the Quangle Wangle said\r\n  To himself on the Crumpetty Tree,\r\n"When all these creatures move\r\n  What a wonderful noise there\'ll be!"\r\nAnd at night by the light of the Mulberry Moon\r\nThey danced to the Flute of the Blue Baboon,\r\nOn the broad green leaves of the Crumpetty Tree,\r\nAnd all were as happy as happy could be,\r\nWith the Quangle Wangle Quee.\r\n\r\n    _Edward Lear._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Singing Leaves\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\n"What fairings will ye that I bring?"\r\n  Said the King to his daughters three;\r\n"For I to Vanity Fair am boun,\r\n  Now say what shall they be?"\r\n\r\nThen up and spake the eldest daughter,\r\n  That lady tall and grand:\r\n"Oh, bring me pearls and diamonds great,\r\n  And gold rings for my hand."\r\n\r\nThereafter spake the second daughter,\r\n  That was both white and red:\r\n"For me bring silks that will stand alone,\r\n  And a gold comb for my head."\r\n\r\nThen came the turn of the least daughter,\r\n  That was whiter than thistle-down,\r\nAnd among the gold of her blithesome hair\r\n  Dim shone the golden crown.\r\n\r\n"There came a bird this morning,\r\n  And sang \'neath my bower eaves,\r\nTill I dreamed, as his music made me,\r\n  \'Ask thou for the Singing Leaves.\'"\r\n\r\nThen the brow of the King swelled crimson\r\n  With a flush of angry scorn:\r\n"Well have ye spoken, my two eldest,\r\n  And chosen as ye were born,\r\n\r\n"But she, like a thing of peasant race,\r\n  That is happy binding the sheaves";\r\nThen he saw her dead mother in her face,\r\n  And said, "Thou shalt have thy leaves."\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nHe mounted and rode three days and nights\r\n  Till he came to Vanity Fair,\r\nAnd \'twas easy to buy the gems and the silk,\r\n  But no Singing Leaves were there.\r\n\r\nThen deep in the greenwood rode he,\r\n  And asked of every tree,\r\n"Oh, if you have, ever a Singing Leaf,\r\n  I pray you give it me!"\r\n\r\nBut the trees all kept their counsel,\r\n  And never a word said they,\r\nOnly there sighed from the pine-tops\r\n  A music of seas far away.\r\n\r\nOnly the pattering aspen\r\n  Made a sound of growing rain,\r\nThat fell ever faster and faster.\r\n  Then faltered to silence again.\r\n\r\n"Oh, where shall I find a little foot-page\r\n  That would win both hose and shoon,\r\nAnd will bring to me the Singing Leaves\r\n  If they grow under the moon?"\r\n\r\nThen lightly turned him Walter the page,\r\n  By the stirrup as he ran:\r\n"Now pledge you me the truesome word\r\n  Of a king and gentleman,\r\n\r\n"That you will give me the first, first thing\r\n  You meet at your castle-gate,\r\nAnd the Princess shall get the Singing Leaves,\r\n  Or mine be a traitor\'s fate."\r\n\r\nThe King\'s head dropt upon his breast\r\n  A moment, as it might be;\r\n\'Twill be my dog, he thought, and said,\r\n  "My faith I plight to thee."\r\n\r\nThen Walter took from next his heart\r\n  A packet small and thin,\r\n"Now give you this to the Princess Anne,\r\n  The Singing Leaves are therein."\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nAs the King rode in at his castle-gate,\r\n  A maiden to meet him ran,\r\nAnd "Welcome, father!" she laughed and cried\r\n  Together, the Princess Anne.\r\n\r\n"Lo, here the Singing Leaves," quoth he,\r\n  "And woe, but they cost me dear!"\r\nShe took the packet, and the smile\r\n  Deepened down beneath the tear.\r\n\r\nIt deepened down till it reached her heart,\r\n  And then gushed up again,\r\nAnd lighted her tears as the sudden sun\r\n  Transfigures the summer rain.\r\n\r\nAnd the first Leaf, when it was opened,\r\n

I have ventured,\r\nLike little wanton boys that swim on bladders,\r\nThis many summers in a sea of glory,\r\nBut far beyond my depth: my high-blown pride\r\nAt length broke under me, and now has left me\r\nWeary, and old with service, to the mercy\r\nOf a rude stream, that must for ever hide me.\r\nVain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye:\r\nI feel my heart new opened. O, how wretched\r\nIs that poor man that hangs on princes\' favours!\r\nThere is, betwixt that smile we would aspire to,\r\nThat sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin,\r\nMore pangs and fears than wars or women have;\r\nAnd when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,\r\nNever to hope again.\r\n\r\n    _William Shakespeare._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Newsboy\r\n\r\n\r\nWant any papers, Mister?\r\n  Wish you\'d buy \'em of me--\r\nTen year old, an\' a fam\'ly,\r\n  An\' bizness dull, you see.\r\nFact, Boss!

Brininstool._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich Shall It Be?\r\n\r\n\r\n"Which shall it be? which shall it be?"\r\nI looked at John,--John looked at me,\r\n(Dear, patient John, who loves me yet\r\nAs well as though my locks were jet.)\r\nAnd when I found that I must speak,\r\nMy voice seemed strangely low and weak;\r\n"Tell me again what Robert said";\r\nAnd then I listening bent my head.\r\n"This is his letter:\r\n                        \'I will give\r\nA house and land while you shall live,\r\nIf, in return, from out your seven,\r\nOne child to me for aye is given.\'"\r\n\r\nI looked at John\'s old garments worn,\r\nI thought of all that John had borne\r\nOf poverty, and work, and care,\r\nWhich I, though willing, could not share;\r\nOf seven hungry mouths to feed,\r\nOf seven little children\'s need,\r\nAnd then of this.\r\n                    "Come John," said I,\r\n"We\'ll choose among them as they lie\r\nAsleep"; so walking hand in hand,\r\nDear John and I surveyed our band.\r\n\r\nFirst to the cradle lightly stepped,\r\nWhere Lilian, the baby, slept;\r\nHer damp curls lay, like gold alight,\r\nA glory \'gainst the pillow white;\r\nSoftly her father stooped to lay\r\nHis rough hand down in loving way,\r\nWhen dream or whisper made her stir,\r\nAnd huskily he said, "Not _her_."\r\nWe stooped beside the trundle-bed,\r\nAnd one long ray of lamp-light shed\r\nAthwart the boyish faces there,\r\nIn sleep so pitiful and fair.\r\nI saw on Jamie\'s rough red cheek\r\nA tear undried; ere John could speak,\r\n"He\'s but a baby too," said I,\r\nAnd kissed him as we hurried by.\r\nPale, patient Robby\'s angel face\r\nStill in his sleep bore suffering\'s trace;\r\n"No, for a thousand crowns not him,"\r\nHe whispered, while our eyes were dim.\r\nPoor Dick! sad Dick! our wayward son,\r\nTurbulent, reckless, idle one,--\r\nCould _he_ be spared? "Nay, He who gave\r\nBids us befriend him to the grave;\r\nOnly a mother\'s heart can be\r\nPatient enough for such as he;\r\nAnd so," said John, "I would not dare\r\nTo send him from her bedside prayer."\r\nThen stole we softly up above,\r\nAnd knelt by Mary, child of love;\r\n"Perhaps for _her_ \'twould better be,"\r\nI said to John. Quite silently\r\nHe lifted up a curl, that lay\r\nAcross her cheek in wilful way,\r\nAnd shook his head; "Nay, love, not thee";\r\nThe while my heart beat audibly.\r\nOnly one more, our eldest lad,\r\nTrusty and truthful, good and glad,--\r\nSo like his father: "No, John, no;\r\nI cannot, will not, let him go!"\r\n\r\nAnd so we wrote, in courteous way,\r\nWe could not give one child away;\r\nAnd afterward toil lighter seemed,\r\nThinking of that of which we dreamed;\r\nHappy, in truth, that not one face\r\nWe missed from its accustomed place;\r\nThankful to work for all the seven,\r\nTrusting then to One in heaven.\r\n\r\n    _Ethel Lynn Beers._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Battle of Bunker\'s Hill\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a starry night in June, the air was soft and still,\r\nWhen the "minute-men" from Cambridge came, and gathered on the hill;\r\nBeneath us lay the sleeping town, around us frowned the fleet,\r\nBut the pulse of freemen, not of slaves, within our bosoms beat;\r\nAnd every heart rose high with hope, as fearlessly we said,\r\n"We will be numbered with the free, or numbered with the dead!"\r\n\r\n"Bring out the line to mark the trench, and stretch it on the sward!"\r\nThe trench is marked, the tools are brought, we utter not a word,\r\nBut stack our guns, then fall to work with mattock and with spade,\r\nA thousand men with sinewy arms, and not a sound is made;\r\nSo still were we, the stars beneath, that scarce a whisper fell;\r\nWe heard the red-coat\'s musket click, and heard him cry, "All\'s well!"\r\n\r\nSee how the morn, is breaking; the red is in the sky!\r\nThe mist is creeping from the stream that floats in silence by;\r\nThe "Lively\'s" hall looms through the fog, and they our works have spied,\r\nFor the ruddy flash and round-shot part in thunder from her side;\r\nAnd the "Falcon" and the "Cerberus" make every bosom thrill,\r\nWith gun and shell, and drum and bell, and boatswain\'s whistle shrill;\r\nBut deep and wider grows the trench, as spade and mattock ply,\r\nFor we have to cope with fearful odds, and the time is drawing nigh!\r\n\r\nUp with the pine-tree banner! Our gallant Prescott stands\r\nAmid the plunging shells and shot, and plants it with his hands;\r\nUp with the shout! for Putnam comes upon his reeking bay,\r\nWith bloody spur and foaming bit, in haste to join the fray.\r\nBut thou whose soul is glowing in the summer of thy years,\r\nUnvanquishable Warren, thou, the youngest of thy peers,\r\nWert born and bred, and shaped and made, to act a patriot\'s part,\r\nAnd dear to us thy presence is as heart\'s blood to the heart!\r\n\r\nHark! from the town a trumpet! The barges at the wharf\r\nAre crowded with the living freight; and now they\'re pushing off;\r\nWith clash and glitter, trump and drum, in all its bright array,\r\nBehold the splendid sacrifice move slowly o\'er the bay!\r\nAnd still and still the barges fill, and still across the deep,\r\nLike thunder clouds along the sky, the hostile transports sweep.\r\n\r\nAnd now they\'re forming at the Point; and now the lines advance:\r\nWe see beneath the sultry sun their polished bayonets glance;\r\nWe hear anear the throbbing drum, the bugle-challenge ring;\r\nQuick bursts and loud the flashing cloud, and rolls from wing to wing;\r\nBut on the height our bulwark stands, tremendous in its gloom,--\r\nAs sullen as a tropic sky, and silent as a tomb.\r\n\r\nAnd so we waited till we saw, at scarce ten rifles\' length,\r\nThe old vindictive Saxon spite, in all its stubborn strength;\r\nWhen sudden, flash on flash, around the jagged rampart burst\r\nFrom every gun the livid light upon the foe accursed.\r\nThen quailed a monarch\'s might before a free-born people\'s ire;\r\nThen drank the sward the veteran\'s life, where swept the yeoman\'s fire.\r\n\r\nThen, staggered by the shot, he saw their serried columns reel,\r\nAnd fall, as falls the bearded rye beneath the reaper\'s steel;\r\nAnd then arose a mighty shout that might have waked the dead,--\r\n"Hurrah! they run! the field is won! Hurrah! the foe is fled!"\r\nAnd every man hath dropped his gun to clutch a neighbor\'s hand,\r\nAs his heart kept praying all the while for home and native land.\r\n\r\nThrice on that day we stood the shock of thrice a thousand foes,\r\nAnd thrice that day within our lines the shout of victory rose;\r\nAnd though our swift fire slackened then, and, reddening in the skies,\r\nWe saw from Charlestown\'s roofs and walls the flamy columns rise,\r\nYet while we had a cartridge left, we still maintained the fight,\r\nNor gained the foe one foot of ground upon that blood-stained height.\r\n\r\nWhat though for us no laurels bloom, and o\'er the nameless brave\r\nNo sculptured trophy, scroll, nor hatch records a warrior grave!\r\nWhat though the day to us was lost!--upon that deathless page\r\nThe everlasting charter stands for every land and age!\r\n\r\nFor man hath broke his felon bonds, and cast them in the dust,\r\nAnd claimed his heritage divine, and justified the trust;\r\nWhile through his rifted prison-bars the hues of freedom pour,\r\nO\'er every nation, race and clime, on every sea and shore,\r\nSuch glories as the patriarch viewed, when, mid the darkest skies,\r\nHe saw above a ruined world the Bow of Promise rise.\r\n\r\n    _F.S.

"Ah, but, sister, I don\'t mind,\r\nGentle Jesus will not beat me; He\'s not cruel or unkind.\r\nBut I can\'t help thinking, Nelly, I should like to take away\r\nSomething, sister, that you gave me, I might look at every day.\r\n\r\n"In the summer you remember how the mission took us out\r\nTo a great green lovely meadow, where we played and ran about,\r\nAnd the van that took us halted by a sweet bright patch of land,\r\nWhere the fine red blossoms grew, dear, half as big as mother\'s hand.\r\n\r\n"Nell, I asked the good kind teacher what they called such flowers as\r\n      those,\r\nAnd he told me, I remember, that the pretty name was rose.\r\nI have never seen them since, dear--how I wish that I had one!\r\nJust to keep and think of you, Nell, when I\'m up beyond the sun."\r\n\r\nNot a word said little Nelly; but at night, when Billy slept,\r\nOn she flung her scanty garments and then down the stairs she crept.\r\nThrough the silent streets of London she ran nimbly as a fawn,\r\nRunning on and running ever till the night had changed to dawn.\r\n\r\nWhen the foggy sun had risen, and the mist had cleared away,\r\nAll around her, wrapped in snowdrift, there the open country lay.\r\nShe was tired, her limbs were frozen, and the roads had cut her feet,\r\nBut there came no flowery gardens her poor tearful eyes to greet.\r\n\r\nShe had traced the road by asking, she had learnt the way to go;\r\nShe had found the famous meadow--it was wrapped in cruel snow;\r\nNot a buttercup or daisy, not a single verdant blade\r\nShowed its head above its prison. Then she knelt her down and prayed;\r\n\r\nWith her eyes upcast to heaven, down she sank upon the ground,\r\nAnd she prayed to God to tell her where the roses might be found.\r\nThen the cold blast numbed her senses, and her sight grew strangely dim;\r\nAnd a sudden, awful tremor seemed to seize her every limb.\r\n\r\n"Oh, a rose!" she moaned, "good Jesus,--just a rose to take to Bill!"\r\nAnd as she prayed a chariot came thundering down the hill;\r\nAnd a lady sat there, toying with a red rose, rare and sweet;\r\nAs she passed she flung it from her, and it fell at Nelly\'s feet.\r\n\r\nJust a word her lord had spoken caused her ladyship to fret,\r\nAnd the rose had been his present, so she flung it in a pet;\r\nBut the poor, half-blinded Nelly thought it fallen from the skies,\r\nAnd she murmured, "Thank you, Jesus!" as she clasped the dainty prize.\r\n\r\nLo! that night from but the alley did a child\'s soul pass away,\r\nFrom dirt and sin and misery up to where God\'s children play.\r\nLo! that night a wild, fierce snowstorm burst in fury o\'er the land,\r\nAnd at morn they found Nell frozen, with the red rose in her hand.\r\n\r\nBilly\'s dead, and gone to glory--so is Billy\'s sister Nell;\r\nAm I bold to say this happened in the land where angels dwell,--\r\nThat the children met in heaven, after all their earthly woes,\r\nAnd that Nelly kissed her brother, and said, "Billy, here\'s your rose"?\r\n\r\n    _George R. Sims._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Old Actor\'s Story\r\n\r\n\r\nMine is a wild, strange story,--the strangest you ever heard;\r\nThere are many who won\'t believe it, but it\'s gospel, every word;\r\nIt\'s the biggest drama of any in a long, adventurous life;\r\nThe scene was a ship, and the actors--were myself and my new-wed wife.\r\n\r\nYou musn\'t mind if I ramble, and lose the thread now and then;\r\nI\'m old, you know, and I wander--it\'s a way with old women and men,\r\nFor their lives lie all behind them, and their thoughts go far away,\r\nAnd are tempted afield, like children lost on a summer day.\r\n\r\nThe years must be five-and-twenty that have passed since that awful night,\r\nBut I see it again this evening, I can never shut out the sight.\r\nWe were only a few weeks married, I and the wife, you know,\r\nWhen we had an offer for Melbourne, and made up our minds to go.\r\n\r\nWe\'d acted together in England, traveling up and down\r\nWith a strolling band of players, going from town to town;\r\nWe played the lovers together--we were leading lady and gent--\r\nAnd at last we played in earnest, and straight to the church we went.\r\n\r\nThe parson gave us his blessing, and I gave Nellie the ring,\r\nAnd swore that I\'d love and cherish, and endow her with everything.\r\nHow we smiled at that part of the service when I said "I thee endow"!\r\nBut as to the "love and cherish," I meant to keep that vow.\r\n\r\nWe were only a couple of strollers; we had coin when the show was good,\r\nWhen it wasn\'t we went without it, and we did the best we could.\r\nWe were happy, and loved each other, and laughed at the shifts we made,--\r\nWhere love makes plenty of sunshine, there poverty casts no shade.\r\n\r\nWell, at last we got to London, and did pretty well for a bit;\r\nThen the business dropped to nothing, and the manager took a flit,--\r\nStepped off one Sunday morning, forgetting the treasury call;\r\nBut our luck was in, and we managed right on our feet to fall.\r\n\r\nWe got an offer for Melbourne,--got it that very week.\r\nThose were the days when thousands went over to fortune seek,\r\nThe days of the great gold fever, and a manager thought the spot\r\nGood for a "spec," and took us as actors among his lot.\r\n\r\nWe hadn\'t a friend in England--we\'d only ourselves to please--\r\nAnd we jumped at the chance of trying our fortune across the seas.\r\nWe went on a sailing vessel, and the journey was long and rough;\r\nWe hadn\'t been out a fortnight before we had had enough.\r\n\r\nBut use is a second nature, and we\'d got not to mind a storm,\r\nWhen misery came upon us,--came in a hideous form.\r\nMy poor little wife fell ailing, grew worse, and at last so bad\r\nThat the doctor said she was dying,--I thought \'twould have sent me mad,--\r\n\r\nDying where leagues of billows seemed to shriek for their prey,\r\nAnd the nearest land was hundreds--aye, thousands--of miles away.\r\nShe raved one night in a fever, and the next lay still as death,\r\nSo still I\'d to bend and listen for the faintest sign of breath.\r\n\r\nShe seemed in a sleep, and sleeping, with a smile on her thin, wan face,--\r\nShe passed away one morning, while I prayed to the throne of grace.\r\nI knelt in the little cabin, and prayer after prayer I said,\r\nTill the surgeon came and told me it was useless--my wife was dead!\r\n\r\nDead! I wouldn\'t believe it. They forced me away that night,\r\nFor I raved in my wild despairing, the shock sent me mad outright.\r\nI was shut in the farthest cabin, and I beat my head on the side,\r\nAnd all day long in my madness, "They\'ve murdered her!" I cried.\r\n\r\nThey locked me away from my fellows,--put me in cruel chains,\r\nIt seems I had seized a weapon to beat out the surgeon\'s brains.\r\nI cried in my wild, mad fury, that he was a devil sent\r\nTo gloat o\'er the frenzied anguish with which my heart was rent.\r\n\r\nI spent that night with the irons heavy upon my wrists,\r\nAnd my wife lay dead quite near me. I beat with my fettered fists,\r\nBeat at my prison panels, and then--O God!--and then\r\nI heard the shrieks of women and the tramp of hurrying men.\r\n\r\nI heard the cry, "Ship afire!" caught up by a hundred throats,\r\nAnd over the roar the captain shouting to lower the boats;\r\nThen cry upon cry, and curses, and the crackle of burning wood,\r\nAnd the place grew hot as a furnace, I could feel it where I stood.\r\n\r\nI beat at the door and shouted, but never a sound came back,\r\nAnd the timbers above me started, till right through a yawning crack\r\nI could see the flames shoot upward, seizing on mast and sail,\r\nFanned in their burning fury by the breath of the howling gale.\r\n\r\nI dashed at the door in fury, shrieking, "I will not die!\r\nDie in this burning prison!"--but I caught no answering cry.\r\nThen, suddenly, right upon me, the flames crept up with a roar,\r\nAnd their fiery tongues shot forward, cracking my prison door.\r\n\r\nI was free--with the heavy iron door dragging me down to death;\r\nI fought my way to the cabin, choked with the burning breath\r\nOf the flames that danced around me like man-mocking fiends at play,\r\nAnd then--O God! I can see it, and shall to my dying day.\r\n\r\nThere lay my Nell as they\'d left her, dead in her berth that night;\r\nThe flames flung a smile on her features,--a horrible, lurid light.\r\nGod knows how I reached and touched her, but I found myself by her side;\r\nI thought she was living a moment, I forgot that my Nell had died.\r\n\r\nIn the shock of those awful seconds reason came back to my brain;\r\nI heard a sound as of breathing, and then a low cry of pain;\r\nOh, was there mercy in heaven? Was there a God in the skies?\r\nThe dead woman\'s lips were moving, the dead woman opened her eyes.\r\n\r\nI cursed like a madman raving--I cried to her, "Nell! my Nell!"\r\nThey had left us alone and helpless, alone in that burning hell;\r\nThey had left us alone to perish--forgotten me living--and she\r\nHad been left for the fire to bear her to heaven, instead of the sea.\r\n\r\nI clutched at her, roused her shrieking, the stupor was on her still;\r\nI seized her in spite of my fetters,--fear gave a giant\'s will.\r\nGod knows how I did it, but blindly I fought through the flames and the\r\n      wreck\r\nUp--up to the air, and brought her safe to the untouched deck.\r\n\r\nWe\'d a moment of life together,--a moment of life, the time\r\nFor one last word to each other,--\'twas a moment supreme, sublime.\r\nFrom the trance we\'d for death mistaken, the heat had brought her to life,\r\nAnd I was fettered and helpless, so we lay there, husband and wife!\r\n\r\nIt was but a moment, but ages seemed to have passed away,\r\nWhen a shout came over the water, and I looked, and lo, there lay,\r\nRight away from the vessel, a boat that was standing by;\r\nThey had seen our forms on the vessel, as the flames lit up the sky.\r\n\r\nI shouted a prayer to Heaven, then called to my wife, and she\r\nTore with new strength at my fetters--God helped her, and I was free;\r\nThen over the burning bulwarks we leaped for one chance of life.\r\nDid they save us? Well, here I am, sir, and yonder\'s my dear old wife.\r\n\r\nWe were out in the boat till daylight, when a great ship passing by\r\nTook us on board, and at Melbourne landed us by and by.\r\nWe\'ve played many parts in dramas since we went on that famous trip,\r\nBut ne\'er such a scene together as we had on the burning ship!\r\n\r\n    _George B. Sims._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Boy Who Didn\'t Pass\r\n\r\n\r\nA sad-faced little fellow sits alone in deep disgrace,\r\nThere\'s a lump arising in his throat, tears streaming down his face;\r\nHe wandered from his playmates, for he doesn\'t want to hear\r\nTheir shouts of merry laughter, since the world has lost its cheer;\r\nHe has sipped the cup of sorrow, he has drained the bitter glass,\r\nAnd his heart is fairly breaking; he\'s the boy who didn\'t pass.\r\n\r\nIn the apple tree the robin sings a cheery little song,\r\nBut he doesn\'t seem to hear it, showing plainly something\'s wrong;\r\nComes his faithful little spaniel for a romp and bit of play,\r\nBut the troubled little fellow sternly bids him go away.\r\nAll alone he sits in sorrow, with his hair a tangled mass,\r\nAnd his eyes are red with weeping; he\'s the boy who didn\'t pass.\r\n\r\nHow he hates himself for failing, he can hear his playmates jeer,\r\nFor they\'ve left him with the dullards--gone ahead a half a year,\r\nAnd he tried so hard to conquer, oh, he tried to do his best,\r\nBut now he knows, he\'s weaker, yes, and duller than the rest.\r\nHe\'s ashamed to tell his mother, for he thinks she\'ll hate him, too--\r\nThe little boy who didn\'t pass, who failed of getting through.\r\n\r\nOh, you who boast a laughing son, and speak of him as bright,\r\nAnd you who love a little girl who comes to you at night\r\nWith smiling eyes, with dancing feet, with honors from her school,\r\nTurn to that lonely little boy who thinks he is a fool,\r\nAnd take him kindly by the hand, the dullest in his class,\r\nHe is the one who most needs love, the boy who didn\'t pass.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Station-Master\'s Story\r\n\r\n\r\nYes, it\'s a quiet station, but it suits me well enough;\r\nI want a bit of the smooth now, for I\'ve had my share o\' rough.\r\nThis berth that the company gave me, they gave as the work was light;\r\nI was never fit for the signals after one awful night,\r\nI\'d been in the box from a younker, and I\'d never felt the strain\r\nOf the lives at my right hand\'s mercy in every passing train.\r\nOne day there was something happened, and it made my nerves go queer,\r\nAnd it\'s all through that as you find me the station-master here.\r\n\r\nI was on at the box down yonder--that\'s where we turn the mails,\r\nAnd specials, and fast expresses, on to the center rails;\r\nThe side\'s for the other traffic--the luggage and local slows.\r\nIt was rare hard work at Christmas, when double the traffic grows.\r\nI\'ve been in the box down yonder nigh sixteen hours a day,\r\nTill my eyes grew dim and heavy, and my thoughts went all astray;\r\nBut I\'ve worked the points half-sleeping--and once I slept outright,\r\nTill the roar of the Limited woke me, and I nearly died with fright.\r\n\r\nThen I thought of the lives in peril, and what might have been their fate\r\nHad I sprung to the points that evening a tenth of a tick too late;\r\nAnd a cold and ghastly shiver ran icily through my frame\r\nAs I fancied the public clamor, the trial, and bitter shame.\r\nI could see the bloody wreckage--I could see the mangled slain--\r\nAnd the picture was seared for ever, blood-red, on my heated brain.\r\nThat moment my nerve was shattered, for I couldn\'t shut out the thought\r\nOf the lives I held in my keeping, and the ruin that might be wrought.\r\n\r\nThat night in our little cottage, as I kissed our sleeping child,\r\nMy wife looked up from her sewing, and told me, as she smiled,\r\nThat Johnny had made his mind up--he\'d be a pointsman, too.\r\n"He says when he\'s big, like daddy, he\'ll work in the box with you."\r\nI frowned, for my heart was heavy, and my wife she saw the look;\r\nLord bless you! my little Alice could read me like a book.\r\nI\'d to tell her of what had happened, and I said that I must leave,\r\nFor a pointsman\'s arm ain\'t trusty when terror lurks in his sleeve.\r\n\r\nBut she cheered me up in a minute, and that night, ere we went to sleep,\r\nShe made me give her a promise, which I swore that I\'d always keep--\r\nIt was always to do my duty. "Do that, and then, come what will,\r\nYou\'ll have no worry." said Alice, "if things go well or ill.\r\nThere\'s something that always tells us the thing that we ought to do"--\r\nMy wife was a bit religious, and in with the chapel crew.\r\nBut I knew she was talking reason, and I said to myself, says I,\r\n"I won\'t give in like a coward, it\'s a scare that\'ll soon go by."\r\n\r\nNow, the very next day the missus had to go to the market town;\r\nShe\'d the Christmas things to see to, and she wanted to buy a gown.\r\nShe\'d be gone for a spell, for the Parley didn\'t come back till eight,\r\nAnd I knew, on a Christmas Eve, too, the trains would be extra late.\r\nSo she settled to leave me Johnny, and then she could turn the key--\r\nFor she\'d have some parcels to carry, and the boy would be safe with me.\r\nHe was five, was our little Johnny, and quiet, and nice, and good--\r\nHe was mad to go with daddy, and I\'d often promised he should.\r\n\r\nIt was noon when the missus started,--her train went by my box;\r\nShe could see, as she passed my window, her darling\'s curly locks,\r\nI lifted him up to mammy, and he kissed his little hand,\r\nThen sat, like a mouse, in the corner, and thought it was fairyland.\r\nBut somehow I fell a-thinking of a scene that would not fade,\r\nOf how I had slept on duty, until I grew afraid;\r\nFor the thought would weigh upon me, one day I might come to lie\r\nIn a felon\'s cell for the slaughter of those I had doomed to die.\r\n\r\nThe fit that had come upon me, like a hideous nightmare seemed,\r\nTill I rubbed my eyes and started like a sleeper who has dreamed.\r\nFor a time the box had vanished--I\'d worked like a mere machine--\r\nMy mind had been on the wander, and I\'d neither heard nor seen,\r\nWith a start I thought of Johnny, and I turned the boy to seek,\r\nThen I uttered a groan of anguish, for my lips refused to speak;\r\nThere had flashed such a scene of horror swift on my startled sight\r\nThat it curdled my blood in terror and sent my red lips white.\r\n\r\nIt was all in one awful moment--I saw that the boy was lost:\r\nHe had gone for a toy, I fancied, some child from a train had tossed;\r\nThe local was easing slowly to stop at the station here,\r\nAnd the limited mail was coming, and I had the line to clear.\r\nI could hear the roar of the engine, I could almost feel its breath,\r\nAnd right on the center metals stood my boy in the jaws of death;\r\nOn came the fierce fiend, tearing straight for the center line,\r\nAnd the hand that must wreck or save it, O merciful God, was mine!\r\n\r\n\'Twas a hundred lives or Johnny\'s. O Heaven! what could I do?--\r\nUp to God\'s ear that moment a wild, fierce question flew--\r\n"What shall I do, O Heaven?" and sudden and loud and clear\r\nOn the wind came the words, "Your duty," borne to my listening ear.\r\nThen I set my teeth, and my breathing was fierce and short and quick.\r\n"My boy!" I cried, but he heard not; and then I went blind and sick;\r\nThe hot black smoke of the engine came with a rush before,\r\nI turned the mail to the center, and by it flew with a roar.\r\n\r\nThen I sank on my knees in horror, and hid my ashen face--\r\nI had given my child to Heaven; his life was a hundred\'s grace.\r\nHad I held my hand a moment, I had hurled the flying mail\r\nTo shatter the creeping local that stood on the other rail!\r\nWhere is my boy, my darling? O God! let me hide my eyes.\r\nHow can I look--his father--on that which there mangled lies?\r\nThat voice!--O merciful Heaven!--\'tis the child\'s, and he calls my name!\r\nI hear, but I cannot see him, for my eyes are filled with flame.\r\n\r\nI knew no more that night, sir, for I fell, as I heard the boy;\r\nThe place reeled round, and I fainted,--swooned with the sudden joy.\r\nBut I heard on the Christmas morning, when I woke in my own warm bed\r\nWith Alice\'s arms around me, and a strange wild dream in my head,\r\nThat she\'d come by the early local, being anxious about the lad,\r\nAnd had seen him there on the metals, and the sight nigh drove her mad--\r\nShe had seen him just as the engine of the Limited closed my view,\r\nAnd she leapt on the line and saved him just as the mail dashed through.\r\n\r\nShe was back in the train in a second, and both were safe and sound;\r\nThe moment they stopped at the station she ran here, and I was found\r\nWith my eyes like a madman\'s glaring, and my face a ghastly white:\r\nI heard the boy, and I fainted, and I hadn\'t my wits that night.\r\nWho told me to do my duty? What voice was that on the wind?\r\nWas it fancy that brought it to me? or were there God\'s lips behind?\r\nIf I hadn\'t \'a\' done my duty--had I ventured to disobey--\r\nMy bonny boy and his mother might have died by my hand that day.\r\n\r\n    _George R. Sims._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHark, Hark! the Lark\r\n\r\n_(From "Cymbeline")_\r\n\r\n\r\nHark, hark! the lark at heaven\'s gate sings,\r\n  And Phoebus \'gins arise,\r\nHis steeds to water at those springs\r\n  On chaliced flowers that lies;\r\nAnd winking Mary-buds begin\r\n  To ope their golden eyes:\r\nWith every thing that pretty is,\r\n  My lady sweet, arise!\r\n    Arise, arise!\r\n\r\n    _William Shakespeare._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTommy\'s Prayer\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a dark and dismal alley where the sunshine never came,\r\nDwelt a little lad named Tommy, sickly, delicate, and lame;\r\nHe had never yet been healthy, but had lain since he was born\r\nDragging out his weak existence well nigh hopeless and forlorn.\r\n\r\nHe was six, was little Tommy, \'twas just five years ago\r\nSince his drunken mother dropped him, and the babe was crippled so.\r\nHe had never known the comfort of a mother\'s tender care,\r\nBut her cruel blows and curses made his pain still worse to bear.\r\n\r\nThere he lay within the cellar, from the morning till the night,\r\nStarved, neglected, cursed, ill-treated, nought to make his dull life\r\n      bright;\r\nNot a single friend to love him, not a loving thing to love--\r\nFor he knew not of a Saviour, or a heaven up above.\r\n\r\n\'Twas a quiet, summer evening, and the alley, too, was still;\r\nTommy\'s little heart was sinking, and he felt so lonely, till,\r\nFloating up the quiet alley, wafted inwards from the street,\r\nCame the sound of some one singing, sounding, oh! so clear and sweet.\r\n\r\nEagerly did Tommy listen as the singing came--\r\nOh! that he could see the singer! How he wished he wasn\'t lame.\r\nThen he called and shouted loudly, till the singer heard the sound,\r\nAnd on noting whence it issued, soon the little cripple found.\r\n\r\n\'Twas a maiden rough and rugged, hair unkempt, and naked feet,\r\nAll her garments torn and ragged, her appearance far from neat;\r\n"So yer called me," said the maiden, "wonder wot yer wants o\' me;\r\nMost folks call me Singing Jessie; wot may your name chance to be?"\r\n\r\n"My name\'s Tommy; I\'m a cripple, and I want to hear you sing,\r\nFor it makes me feel so happy--sing me something, anything,"\r\nJessie laughed, and answered smiling, "I can\'t stay here very long,\r\nBut I\'ll sing a hymn to please you, wot I calls the \'Glory Song.\'"\r\n\r\nThen she sang to him of heaven, pearly gates, and streets of gold,\r\nWhere the happy angel children are not starved or nipped with cold;\r\nBut where happiness and gladness never can decrease or end,\r\nAnd where kind and loving Jesus is their Sovereign and their Friend.\r\n\r\nOh! how Tommy\'s eyes did glisten as he drank in every word\r\nAs it fell from "Singing Jessie"--was it true, what he had heard?\r\nAnd so anxiously he asked her, "Is there really such a place?"\r\nAnd a tear began to trickle down his pallid little face.\r\n\r\n"Tommy, you\'re a little heathen; why, it\'s up beyond the sky,\r\nAnd if yer will love the Saviour, yer shall go there when yer die."\r\n"Then," said Tommy, "tell me, Jessie, how can I the Saviour love,\r\nWhen I\'m down in this \'ere cellar, and He\'s up in heaven above?"\r\n\r\nSo the little ragged maiden who had heard at Sunday School\r\nAll about the way to heaven, and the Christian\'s golden rule,\r\nTaught the little cripple Tommy how to love, and how to pray,\r\nThen she sang a "Song of Jesus," kissed his cheek and went away.\r\n\r\nTommy lay within the cellar which had grown so dark and cold,\r\nThinking all about the children in the streets of shining gold;\r\nAnd he heeded not the darkness of that damp and chilly room,\r\nFor the joy in Tommy\'s bosom could disperse the deepest gloom.\r\n\r\n"Oh! if I could only see it," thought the cripple, as he lay,\r\n"Jessie said that Jesus listens and I think I\'ll try and pray";\r\nSo he put his hands together, and he closed his little eyes,\r\nAnd in accents weak, yet earnest, sent this message to the skies:--\r\n\r\n"Gentle Jesus, please forgive me as I didn\'t know afore,\r\nThat yer cared for little cripples who is weak and very poor,\r\nAnd I never heard of heaven till that Jessie came to-day\r\nAnd told me all about it, so I wants to try and pray.\r\n\r\n"Yer can see me, can\'t yer, Jesus? Jessie told me that yer could,\r\nAnd I somehow must believe it, for it seems so prime and good;\r\nAnd she told me if I loved you, I should see yer when I die,\r\nIn the bright and happy heaven that is up beyond the sky.\r\n\r\n"Lord, I\'m only just a cripple, and I\'m no use here below,\r\nFor I heard my mother whisper, she\'d be glad if I could go;\r\nAnd I\'m cold and hungry sometimes; and I feel so lonely, too,\r\nCan\'t yer take me, gentle Jesus, up to heaven along o\' you?\r\n\r\n"Oh! I\'d be so good and patient, and I\'d never cry or fret,\r\nAnd your kindness to me, Jesus, I would surely not forget;\r\nI would love you all I know of, and would never make a noise--\r\nCan\'t you find me just a corner, where I\'ll watch the other boys?\r\n\r\n"Oh! I think yer\'ll do it, Jesus, something seems to tell me so,\r\nFor I feel so glad and happy, and I do so want to go,\r\nHow I long to see yer, Jesus, and the children all so bright!\r\nCome and fetch me, won\'t yer, Jesus? Come and fetch me home tonight!"\r\n\r\nTommy ceased his supplication, he had told his soul\'s desire,\r\nAnd he waited for the answer till his head began to tire;\r\nThen he turned towards his corner and lay huddled in a heap,\r\nClosed his little eyes so gently, and was quickly fast asleep.\r\n\r\nOh, I wish that every scoffer could have seen his little face\r\nAs he lay there in the corner, in that damp, and noisome place;\r\nFor his countenance was shining like an angel\'s, fair and bright,\r\nAnd it seemed to fill the cellar with a holy, heavenly light.\r\n\r\nHe had only heard of Jesus from a ragged singing girl,\r\nHe might well have wondered, pondered, till his brain began to whirl;\r\nBut he took it as she told it, and believed it then and there,\r\nSimply trusting in the Saviour, and his kind and tender care.\r\n\r\nIn the morning, when the mother came to wake her crippled boy,\r\nShe discovered that his features wore a look of sweetest joy,\r\nAnd she shook him somewhat roughly, but the cripple\'s face was cold--\r\nHe had gone to join the children in the streets of shining gold.\r\n\r\nTommy\'s prayer had soon been answered, and the Angel Death had come\r\nTo remove him from his cellar, to his bright and heavenly home\r\nWhere sweet comfort, joy, and gladness never can decrease or end,\r\nAnd where Jesus reigns eternally, his Sovereign and his Friend.\r\n\r\n    _John F. Nicholls._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Two Pictures\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a bright and lovely summer\'s morn,\r\nFair bloomed the flowers, the birds sang softly sweet,\r\nThe air was redolent with perfumed balm,\r\nAnd Nature scattered, with unsparing hand,\r\nHer loveliest graces over hill and dale.\r\nAn artist, weary of his narrow room\r\nWithin the city\'s pent and heated walls,\r\nHad wandered long amid the ripening fields,\r\nUntil, remembering his neglected themes,\r\nHe thought to turn his truant steps toward home.\r\nThese led him through a rustic, winding lane,\r\nLined with green hedge-rows spangled close with flowers,\r\nAnd overarched by trees of noblest growth.\r\nBut when at last he reached the farther end\r\nOf this sweet labyrinth, he there beheld\r\nA vision of such pure, pathetic grace,\r\nThat weariness and haste were both obscured,\r\nIt was a child--a young and lovely child\r\nWith eyes of heavenly hue, bright golden hair,\r\nAnd dimpled hands clasped in a morning prayer,\r\nKneeling beside its youthful mother\'s knee.\r\nUpon that baby brow of spotless snow,\r\nNo single trace of guilt, or pain, or woe,\r\nNo line of bitter grief or dark despair,\r\nOf envy, hatred, malice, worldly care,\r\nHad ever yet been written. With bated breath,\r\nAnd hand uplifted as in warning, swift,\r\nThe artist seized his pencil, and there traced\r\nIn soft and tender lines that image fair:\r\nThen, when \'twas finished, wrote beneath one word,\r\nA word of holiest import--Innocence.\r\n\r\nYears fled and brought with them a subtle change,\r\nScattering Time\'s snow upon the artist\'s brow,\r\nBut leaving there the laurel wreath of fame,\r\nWhile all men spake in words of praise his name;\r\nFor he had traced full many a noble work\r\nUpon the canvas that had touched men\'s souls,\r\nAnd drawn them from the baser things of earth,\r\nToward the light and purity of heaven.\r\nOne day, in tossing o\'er his folio\'s leaves,\r\nHe chanced upon the picture of the child,\r\nWhich he had sketched that bright morn long before,\r\nAnd then forgotten. Now, as he paused to gaze,\r\nA ray of inspiration seemed to dart\r\nStraight from those eyes to his. He took the sketch,\r\nPlaced it before his easel, and with care\r\nThat seemed but pleasure, painted a fair theme,\r\nTouching and still re-touching each bright lineament,\r\nUntil all seemed to glow with life divine--\r\n\'Twas innocence personified. But still\r\nThe artist could not pause. He needs must have\r\nA meet companion for his fairest theme;\r\nAnd so he sought the wretched haunts of sin,\r\nThrough miry courts of misery and guilt,\r\nSeeking a face which at the last was found.\r\nWithin a prison cell there crouched a man--\r\nNay, rather say a fiend--with countenance seamed\r\nAnd marred by all the horrid lines of sin;\r\nEach mark of degradation might be traced,\r\nAnd every scene of horror he had known,\r\nAnd every wicked deed that he had done,\r\nWere visibly written on his lineaments;\r\nEven the last, worst deed of all, that left him here,\r\nA parricide within a murderer\'s cell.\r\n\r\nHere then the artist found him; and with hand\r\nMade skillful by its oft-repeated toil,\r\nTransferred unto his canvas that vile face,\r\nAnd also wrote beneath it just one word,\r\nA word of darkest import--it was Vice.\r\nThen with some inspiration not his own,\r\nThinking, perchance, to touch that guilty heart,\r\nAnd wake it to repentance e\'er too late,\r\nThe artist told the tale of that bright morn,\r\nPlaced the two pictured faces side by side,\r\nAnd brought the wretch before them. With a shriek\r\nThat echoed through those vaulted corridors,\r\nLike to the cries that issue from the lips\r\nOf souls forever doomed to woe,\r\nProstrate upon the stony floor he fell,\r\nAnd hid his face and groaned aloud in anguish.\r\n"I was that child once--I, yes, even I--\r\nIn the gracious years forever fled,\r\nThat innocent and happy little child!\r\nThese very hands were raised to God in prayer,\r\nThat now are reddened with a mother\'s blood.\r\nGreat Heaven! can such things be? Almighty power,\r\nSend forth Thy dart and strike me where I lie!"\r\n\r\nHe rose, laid hold upon the artist\'s arm\r\nAnd grasped it with demoniac power,\r\nThe while he cried: "Go forth, I say, go forth\r\nAnd tell my history to the tempted youth.\r\nI looked upon the wine when it was red,\r\nI heeded not my mother\'s piteous prayers,\r\nI heeded not the warnings of my friends,\r\nBut tasted of the wine when it was red,\r\nUntil it left a demon in my heart\r\nThat led me onward, step by step, to this,\r\nThis horrible place from which my body goes\r\nUnto the gallows, and my soul to hell!"\r\nHe ceased as last. The artist turned and fled;\r\nBut even as he went, unto his ears\r\nWere borne the awful echoes of despair,\r\nWhich the lost wretch flung on the empty air,\r\nCursing the demon that had brought him there.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Two Kinds of People\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of people on earth to-day;\r\nJust two kinds of people, no more, I say.\r\n\r\nNot the sinner and saint, for it\'s well understood,\r\nThe good are half bad and the bad are half good.\r\n\r\nNot the rich and the poor, for to rate a man\'s wealth,\r\nYou must first know the state of his conscience and health.\r\n\r\nNot the humble and proud, for in life\'s little span,\r\nWho puts on vain airs is not counted a man.\r\n\r\nNot the happy and sad, for the swift flying years\r\nBring each man his laughter and each man his tears.\r\n\r\nNo; the two kinds of people on earth I mean,\r\nAre the people who lift and the people who lean.\r\n\r\nWherever you go, you will find the earth\'s masses\r\nAre always divided in just these two classes.\r\n\r\nAnd, oddly enough, you will find, too, I ween,\r\nThere\'s only one lifter to twenty who lean.\r\n\r\nIn which class are you? Are you easing the load\r\nOf overtaxed lifters, who toil down the road?\r\n\r\nOr are you a leaner, who lets others share\r\nYour portion of labor, and worry and care?\r\n\r\n    _Ella Wheeler Wilcox._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sin of Omission\r\n\r\n\r\nIt isn\'t the thing you do, dear,\r\n  It\'s the thing you leave undone\r\nThat gives you a bit of a heartache\r\n  At the setting of the sun.\r\nThe tender word forgotten;\r\n  The letter you did not write;\r\nThe flowers you did not send, dear,\r\n  Are your haunting ghosts at night.\r\n\r\nThe stone you might have lifted\r\n  Out of a brother\'s way;\r\nThe bit of hearthstone counsel\r\n  You were hurried too much to say;\r\nThe loving touch of the hand, dear,\r\n  The gentle, winning tone\r\nWhich you had no time nor thought for\r\n  With troubles enough of your own.\r\n\r\nThose little acts of kindness\r\n  So easily out of mind,\r\nThose chances to be angels\r\n  Which we poor mortals find--\r\nThey come in night and silence,\r\n  Each sad, reproachful wraith,\r\nWhen hope is faint and flagging\r\n  And a chill has fallen on faith.\r\n\r\nFor life is all too short, dear,\r\n  And sorrow is all too great,\r\nTo suffer our slow compassion\r\n  That tarries until too late;\r\nAnd it isn\'t the thing you do, dear,\r\n  It\'s the thing you leave undone\r\nWhich gives you a bit of a heartache\r\n  At the setting of the sun,\r\n\r\n    _Margaret E. Sangster._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Bible My Mother Gave Me\r\n\r\n\r\nGive me that grand old volume, the gift of a mother\'s love,\r\nTho\' the spirit that first taught me has winged its flight above.\r\nYet, with no legacy but this, she has left me wealth untold,\r\nYea, mightier than earth\'s riches, or the wealth of Ophir\'s gold.\r\n\r\nWhen a child, I\'ve kneeled beside her, in our dear old cottage home,\r\nAnd listened to her reading from that prized and cherished tome,\r\nAs with low and gentle cadence, and a meek and reverent mien,\r\nGod\'s word fell from her trembling lips, like a presence felt and seen.\r\n\r\nSolemn and sweet the counsels that spring from its open page,\r\nWritten with all the fervor and zeal of  the prophet age;\r\nFull of the inspiration of the holy bards who trod,\r\nCaring not for the scoffer\'s scorn, if they gained a soul to God.\r\n\r\nMen who in mind were godlike, and have left on its blazoned scroll\r\nFood for all coming ages in its manna of the soul;\r\nWho, through long days of anguish, and nights devoid of ease,\r\nStill wrote with the burning pen of faith its higher mysteries.\r\n\r\nI can list that good man yonder, in the gray church by the brook,\r\nTake up that marvelous tale of love, of the story and the Book,\r\nHow through the twilight glimmer, from the earliest dawn of time,\r\nIt was handed down as an heirloom, in almost every clime.\r\n\r\nHow through strong persecution and the struggle of evil days\r\nThe precious light of the truth ne\'er died, but was fanned to a beacon\r\n      blaze.\r\nHow in far-off lands, where the cypress bends o\'er the laurel bough,\r\nIt was hid like some precious treasure, and they bled for its truth, as\r\n      now.\r\n\r\nHe tells how there stood around it a phalanx none could break,\r\nThough steel and fire and lash swept on, and the cruel wave lapt the stake;\r\nHow dungeon doors and prison bars had never damped the flame,\r\nBut raised up converts to the creed whence Christian comfort came.\r\n\r\nThat housed in caves and caverns--how it stirs our Scottish blood!--\r\nThe Convenanters, sword in hand, poured forth the crimson flood;\r\nAnd eloquent grows the preacher, as the Sabbath sunshine falls,\r\nThro\' cobwebbed and checkered pane, a halo on the walls!\r\n\r\nThat still \'mid sore disaster, in the heat and strife of doubt,\r\nSome bear the Gospel oriflamme, and one by one march out,\r\nTill forth from heathen kingdoms, and isles beyond the sea,\r\nThe glorious tidings of the Book spread Christ\'s salvation free.\r\n\r\nSo I cling to my mother\'s Bible, in its torn and tattered boards,\r\nAs one of the greatest gems of art, and the king of all other hoards,\r\nAs in life the true consoler, and in death ere the Judgment call,\r\nThe guide that will lead to the shining shore, where the Father waits\r\n      for all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLincoln, the Man of the People\r\n\r\nThis poem was read by Edwin Markham at the dedication of the Lincoln\r\nMemorial at Washington, D.C., May 30, 1922. Before reading, he said: "No\r\noration, no poem, can rise to the high level of this historic hour.\r\nNevertheless, I venture to inscribe this revised version of my Lincoln\r\npoem to this stupendous Lincoln Memorial, to this far-shining monument\r\nof remembrance, erected in immortal marble to the honor of our deathless\r\nmartyr--the consecrated statesman, the ideal American, the ever-beloved\r\nfriend of humanity."\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the Norn Mother saw the Whirlwind Hour\r\nGreatening and darkening as it hurried on,\r\nShe left the Heaven of Heroes and came down\r\nTo make a man to meet the mortal need,\r\nShe took the tried clay of the common road--\r\nClay warm yet with the genial heat of Earth,\r\nDasht through it all a strain of prophecy;\r\nTempered the heap with thrill of human tears;\r\nThen mixt a laughter with the serious stuff.\r\nInto the shape she breathed a flame to light\r\nThat tender, tragic, ever-changing face;\r\nAnd laid on him a sense of the Mystic Powers,\r\nMoving--all husht--behind the mortal veil.\r\nHere was a man to hold against the world,\r\nA man to match the mountains and the sea.\r\n\r\nThe color of the ground was in him, the red earth;\r\nThe smack and tang of elemental things;\r\nThe rectitude and patience of the cliff;\r\nThe good-will of the rain that loves all leaves;\r\nThe friendly welcome of the wayside well;\r\nThe courage of the bird that dares the sea;\r\nThe gladness of the wind that shakes the corn;\r\nThe pity of the snow that hides all scars;\r\nThe secrecy of streams that make their way\r\nUnder the mountain to the rifted rock;\r\nThe tolerance and equity of light\r\nThat gives as freely to the shrinking flower\r\nAs to the great oak flaring to the wind--\r\nTo the grave\'s low hill as to the Matterhorn\r\nThat shoulders out the sky. Sprung from the West,\r\nHe drank the valorous youth of a new world.\r\nThe strength of virgin forests braced his mind,\r\nThe hush of spacious prairies stilled his soul.\r\nHis words were oaks in acorns; and his thoughts\r\nWere roots that firmly gript the granite truth.\r\n\r\nUp from log cabin to the Capitol,\r\nOne fire was on his spirit, one resolve--\r\nTo send the keen ax to the root of wrong,\r\nClearing a free way for the feet of God,\r\nThe eyes of conscience testing every stroke,\r\nTo make his deed the measure of a man.\r\nHe built the rail-pile as he built the State,\r\nPouring his splendid strength through every blow;\r\nThe grip that swung the ax in Illinois\r\nWas on the pen that set a people free.\r\n\r\nSo came the Captain with the mighty heart;\r\nAnd when the judgment thunders split the house,\r\nWrenching the rafters from their ancient rest,\r\nHe held the ridgepole up, and spikt again\r\nThe rafters of the Home. He held his place--\r\nHeld the long purpose like a growing tree--\r\nHeld on through blame and faltered not at praise.\r\nAnd when he fell in whirlwind, he went down\r\nAs when a lordly cedar, green with boughs,\r\nGoes down with a great shout upon the hills,\r\nAnd leaves a lonesome place against the sky.\r\n\r\n    _Edwin Markham._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Own\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I had known in the morning\r\n  How wearily all the day\r\n    The words unkind\r\n    Would trouble my mind\r\n  I said when you went away,\r\nI had been more careful, darling,\r\n  Nor given you needless pain;\r\n    But we vex "our own"\r\n    With look and tone\r\n  We may never take back again.\r\n\r\nFor though in the quiet evening\r\n  You may give me the kiss of peace,\r\n    Yet it might be\r\n    That never for me,\r\n  The pain of the heart should cease.\r\nHow many go forth in the morning,\r\n  That never come home at night!\r\n    And hearts have broken\r\n    For harsh words spoken\r\n  That sorrow can ne\'er set right.\r\n\r\nWe have careful thoughts for the stranger,\r\n  And smiles for the sometime guest,\r\n    But oft for "our own"\r\n    The bitter tone,\r\n  Though we love "our own" the best.\r\nAh, lips with the curve impatient!\r\n  Ah, brow with that look of scorn!\r\n    \'Twere a cruel fate,\r\n    Were the night too late\r\n  To undo the work of morn.\r\n\r\n    _Margaret E. Sangster._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Salvator Won\r\n\r\n\r\nThe gate was thrown open, I rode out alone,\r\nMore proud than a monarch, who sits on a throne.\r\nI am but a jockey, but shout upon shout\r\nWent up from the people who watched me ride out.\r\nAnd the cheers that rang forth from that warm-hearted crowd\r\nWere as earnest as those to which monarch e\'er bowed.\r\nMy heart thrilled with pleasure so keen it was pain,\r\nAs I patted my Salvator\'s soft, silken mane;\r\nAnd a sweet shiver shot from his hide to my hand\r\nAs we passed by the multitude down to the stand.\r\nThe great wave of cheering came billowing back\r\nAs the hoofs of brave Tenny ran swift down the track,\r\nAnd he stood there beside us, all bone and all muscle,\r\nOur noble opponent, well trained for the tussle\r\nThat waited us there on the smooth, shining course.\r\nMy Salvator, fair to the lovers of horse\r\nAs a beautiful woman is fair to man\'s sight--\r\nPure type of the thoroughbred, clean-limbed and bright--\r\nStood taking the plaudits as only his due\r\nAnd nothing at all unexpected or new.\r\n\r\nAnd then there before us as the bright flag is spread,\r\nThere\'s a roar from the grand stand, and Tenny\'s ahead;\r\nAt the sound of the voices that shouted, "A go!"\r\nHe sprang like an arrow shot straight from the bow.\r\nI tighten the reins on Prince Charlie\'s great son;\r\nHe is off like a rocket, the race is begun.\r\nHalf-way down the furlong their heads are together,\r\nScarce room \'twixt their noses to wedge in a feather;\r\nPast grand stand, and judges, in neck-to-neck strife,\r\nAh, Salvator, boy, \'tis the race of your life!\r\nI press my knees closer, I coax him, I urge,\r\nI feel him go out with a leap and a surge;\r\nI see him creep on, inch by inch, stride by stride,\r\nWhile backward, still backward, falls Tenny beside.\r\nWe are nearing the turn, the first quarter is passed--\r\n\'Twixt leader and chaser the daylight is cast;\r\nThe distance elongates; still Tenny sweeps on,\r\nAs graceful and free-limbed and swift as a fawn,\r\nHis awkwardness vanished, his muscles all strained--\r\nA noble opponent well born and well trained.\r\n\r\nI glanced o\'er my shoulder; ha! Tenny! the cost\r\nOf that one second\'s flagging will be--the race lost;\r\nOne second\'s yielding of courage and strength,\r\nAnd the daylight between us has doubled its length.\r\nThe first mile is covered, the race is mine--no!\r\nFor the blue blood of Tenny responds to a blow;\r\nHe shoots through the air like a ball from a gun,\r\nAnd the two lengths between us are shortened to one.\r\nMy heart is contracted, my throat feels a lump,\r\nFor Tenny\'s long neck is at Salvator\'s rump;\r\nAnd now with new courage grown bolder and bolder,\r\nI see him once more running shoulder to shoulder.\r\nWith knees, hands and body I press my grand steed;\r\nI urge him, I coax him, I pray him to heed!\r\nO Salvator! Salvator! List to my calls,\r\nFor the blow of my whip will hurt both if it falls.\r\nThere\'s a roar from the crowd like the ocean in storm,\r\nAs close to the saddle leaps Tenny\'s great form;\r\nOne mighty plunge, and with knee, limb and hand,\r\nI lift my horse first by a nose past the stand.\r\nWe are under the string now--the great race is done--\r\nAnd Salvator, Salvator, Salvator won!\r\n\r\nCheer, hoary-headed patriarchs; cheer loud, I say;\r\n\'Tis the race of a century witnessed to-day!\r\nThough ye live twice the space that\'s allotted to men\r\nYe never will see such a grand race again.\r\nLet the shouts of the populace roar like the surf,\r\nFor Salvator, Salvator, king of the turf,\r\nHe has rivaled the record of thirteen long years;\r\nHe has won the first place in the vast line of peers.\r\n\'Twas a neck-to-neck contest, a grand, honest race,\r\nAnd even his enemies grant him his place.\r\nDown into the dust let old records be hurled,\r\nAnd hang out 2:05 to the gaze of the world!\r\n\r\n    _Ella Wheeler Wilcox._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI Got to Go to School\r\n\r\n\r\nI\'d like to hunt the Injuns \'t roam the boundless plain!\r\nI\'d like to be a pirate an\' plow the ragin\' main!\r\nAn\' capture some big island, in lordly pomp to rule;\r\nBut I just can\'t be nothin\' cause I got to go to school.\r\n\r\n\'Most all great men, so I have read, has been the ones \'at got\r\nThe least amount o\' learnin\' by a flickerin\' pitch pine knot;\r\nAn\' many a darin\' boy like me grows up to be a fool,\r\nAn\' never \'mounts to nothin\' \'cause he\'s got to go to school.\r\n\r\nI\'d like to be a cowboy an\' rope the Texas steer!\r\nI\'d like to be a sleuth-houn\' or a bloody buccaneer!\r\nAn\' leave the foe to welter where their blood had made a pool;\r\nBut how can I git famous? \'cause I got to go to school.\r\n\r\nI don\'t see how my parents kin make the big mistake.\r\nO\' keepin\' down a boy like me \'at\'s got a name to make!\r\nIt ain\'t no wonder boys is bad, an\' balky as a mule;\r\nLife ain\'t worth livin\' if you\'ve got to waste your time in school.\r\n\r\nI\'d like to be regarded as "The Terror of the Plains"!\r\nI\'d like to hear my victims shriek an\' clank their prison chains!\r\nI\'d like to face the enemy with gaze serene an\' cool,\r\nAn\' wipe \'em off the earth, but pshaw!

"It\'s over, my lads! Good-bye"!\r\nHalf of the crew swam shoreward, half to the sheltered caves,\r\nBut father and sons were fighting death in the foam of the angry waves.\r\n\r\nUp at a lighthouse window two women beheld the storm,\r\nAnd saw in the boiling breakers a figure--a fighting form;\r\nIt might be a gray-haired father, then the women held their breath;\r\nIt might be a fair-haired brother, who was having a round with death;\r\nIt might be a lover, a husband, whose kisses were on the lips\r\nOf the women whose love is the life of men going down to the sea in ships.\r\nThey had seen the launch of the lifeboat, they had seen the worst, and\r\n      more,\r\nThen, kissing each other, these women went down from the lighthouse,\r\nstraight to shore.\r\n\r\nThere by the rocks on the breakers these sisters, hand in hand,\r\nBeheld once more that desperate man who struggled to reach the land,\r\n\'Twas only aid he wanted to help him across the wave,\r\nBut what are a couple of women with only a man to save?\r\nWhat are a couple of women? well, more than three craven men\r\nWho stood by the shore with chattering teeth, refusing to stir--and then\r\nOff went the women\'s shawls, sir; in a second they\'re torn and rent,\r\nThen knotting them into a rope of love, straight into the sea they went!\r\n\r\n"Come back!" cried the lighthouse-keeper. "For God\'s sake, girls, come\r\n      back!"\r\nAs they caught the waves on their foreheads, resisting the fierce attack.\r\n"Come back!" moaned the gray-haired mother, as she stood by the angry sea,\r\n"If the waves take you, my darlings, there\'s nobody left to me!"\r\n\r\n"Come back!" said the three strong soldiers, who still stood faint and\r\n      pale,\r\n"You will drown if you face the breakers! you will fall if you brave the\r\n      gale!"\r\n"_Come back_!" said the girls, "we will not! go tell it to all the town,\r\nWe\'ll lose our lives, God willing, before that man shall drown!"\r\n\r\n"Give one more knot to the shawls, Bess! give one strong clutch of your\r\n      hand!\r\nJust follow me, brave, to the shingle, and we\'ll bring him safe to land!\r\nWait for the next wave, darling! only a minute more,\r\nAnd I\'ll have him safe in my arms, dear, and we\'ll drag him to the shore."\r\nUp to the arms in the water, fighting it breast to breast,\r\nThey caught and saved a brother alive. God bless them! you know the rest--\r\nWell, many a heart beat stronger, and many a tear was shed,\r\nAnd many a glass was tossed right off to "The Women of Mumbles Head!"\r\n\r\n    _Clement Scott._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fireman\'s Story\r\n\r\n\r\n"\'A frightful face\'?

Helped by Bridget\'s willing hands,\r\nBustled Hannah, deftly mixing pies, for ready waiting pans.\r\nLittle Flossie flitted round them, and her curling, floating hair\r\nGlinted gold-like, gleamed and glistened, in the sparkling sunlit air;\r\nSlouched a figure o\'er the lawn; a man so wretched and forlore,\r\nTattered, grim, so like a beggar, ne\'er had trod that path before.\r\nHis shirt was torn, his hat was gone, bare and begrimed his knees,\r\nFace with blood and dirt disfigured, elbows peeped from out his sleeves.\r\nRat-tat-tat, upon the entrance, brought Aunt Hannah to the door;\r\nParched lips humbly plead for water, as she scanned his misery o\'er;\r\nWrathful came the dame\'s quick answer; made him cower, shame, and start\r\nOut of sight, despairing, saddened, hurt and angry to the heart.\r\n"_Drink_! You\'ve had enough, you rascal. Faugh! The smell now makes me\r\n      sick,\r\nMove, you thief! Leave now these grounds, sir, or our dogs will help you\r\n      quick."\r\nThen the man with dragging footsteps hopeless, wishing himself dead,\r\nCrept away from sight of plenty, starved in place of being fed,\r\nWandered farther from the mansion, till he reached a purling brook,\r\nBabbling, trilling broken music by a green and shady nook,\r\nHere sweet Flossie found him fainting; in her hands were food and drink;\r\nPale like death lay he before her, yet the child-heart did not shrink;\r\nThen the rags from off his forehead, she with dainty hands offstripped,\r\nIn the brooklet\'s rippling waters, her own lace-trimmed \'kerchief dipped;\r\nThen with sweet and holy pity, which, within her, did not daunt,\r\nBathed the blood and grime-stained visage of that sin-soiled son of want.\r\nWrung she then the linen cleanly, bandaged up the wound again\r\nEre the still eyes opened slowly; white lips murmuring, "Am I sane?"\r\n"Look, poor man, here\'s food and drink. Now thank our God before you\r\n      take."\r\nPaused he mute and undecided, while deep sobs his form did shake\r\nWith an avalanche of feeling, and great tears came rolling down\r\nO\'er a face unused to showing aught except a sullen frown;\r\nThat "our God" unsealed a fountain his whole life had never known,\r\nWhen that human angel near him spoke of her God as his own.\r\n"Is it \'cause my aunty grieved you?" Quickly did the wee one ask.\r\n"I\'ll tell you my little verse then, \'tis a holy Bible task,\r\nIt may help you to forgive her: \'Love your enemies and those\r\nWho despitefully may use you; love them whether friends or foes!\'"\r\n\r\nThen she glided from his vision, left him prostrate on the ground\r\nConning o\'er and o\'er that lesson--with a grace to him new found.\r\nSunlight filtering through green branches as they wind-wave dance and dip,\r\nFinds a prayer his mother taught him, trembling on his crime-stained lip.\r\nHist! a step, an angry mutter, and the owner of the place,\r\nGentle Flossie\'s haughty father, and the tramp stood face to face!\r\n"Thieving rascal! you\'ve my daughter\'s \'kerchief bound upon your brow;\r\nOff with it, and cast it down here. Come! be quick about it now."\r\nAs the man did not obey him, Flossie\'s father lashed his cheek\r\nWith a riding-whip he carried; struck him hard and cut him deep.\r\nQuick the tramp bore down upon him, felled him, o\'er him where he lay\r\nRaised a knife to seek his life-blood. Then there came a thought to stay\r\nAll his angry, murderous impulse, caused the knife to shuddering fall:\r\n"He\'s her father; love your en\'mies; \'tis \'our God\' reigns over all."\r\nAt midnight, lambent, lurid flames light up the sky with fiercest beams,\r\nWild cries, "Fire! fire!" ring through the air, and red like blood each\r\n      flame now seems;\r\nThey faster grow, they higher throw weird, direful arms which ever lean\r\nAbout the gray stone mansion old. Now roars the wind to aid the scene;\r\nThe flames yet higher, wilder play. A shudder runs through all around--\r\nDistinctly as in light of day, at topmost window from the ground\r\nSweet Flossie stands, her golden hair enhaloed now by firelit air.\r\nLoud rang the father\'s cry: "O God! my child! my child! Will no one dare\r\nFor her sweet sake the flaming stair?" Look, one steps forth with muffled\r\n      face,\r\nLeaps through the flames with fleetest feet, on trembling ladder runs a\r\n      race\r\nWith life and death--the window gains. Deep silence falls on all around,\r\nTill bursts aloud a sobbing wail. The ladder falls with crashing sound--\r\nA flaming, treacherous mass. O God! she was so young and he so brave!\r\nLook once again. See! see! on highest roof he stands--the fiery wave\r\nFierce rolling round--his arms enclasp the child--God help him yet to save!\r\n"For life or for eternal sleep,"\r\nHe cries, then makes a vaulting leap,\r\nA tree branch catches, with sure aim,\r\nAnd by the act proclaims his name;\r\nThe air was rent, the cheers rang loud,\r\nA rough voice cried from out the crowd,\r\n"Huzza, my boys, well we know him,\r\nNone dares that leap but Flying Jim!"\r\nA jail-bird--outlaw--thief, indeed,\r\nYet o\'er them all takes kingly lead.\r\n"Do now your worst," his gasping cry,\r\n"Do all your worst, I\'m doomed to die;\r\nI\'ve breathed the flames, \'twill not be long";\r\nThen hushed all murmurs through the throng.\r\nWith reverent hands they bore him where\r\nThe summer evening\'s cooling air\r\nCame softly sighing through the trees;\r\nThe child\'s proud father on his knees\r\nForgiveness sought of God and Jim,\r\nWhich dying lips accorded him.\r\nA mark of whip on white face stirred\r\nTo gleaming scarlet at his words.\r\n"Forgive them all who use you ill,\r\nShe taught me that and I fulfill;\r\nI would her hand might touch my face,\r\nThough she\'s so pure and I so base."\r\nLow Flossie bent and kissed the brow,\r\nWith smile of bliss transfigured now:\r\nDeath, the angel, sealed it there,\r\n\'Twas sent to God with "mother\'s prayer."\r\n\r\n    _Emma Dunning Banks._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBetty and the Bear\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a pioneer\'s cabin out West, so they say,\r\nA great big black grizzly trotted one day,\r\nAnd seated himself on the hearths and began\r\nTo lap the contents of a two gallon pan\r\nOf milk and potatoes,--an excellent meal,--\r\nAnd then looked, about to see what he could steal.\r\nThe lord of the mansion awoke from his sleep,\r\nAnd, hearing a racket, he ventured to peep\r\nJust out in the kitchen, to see what was there,\r\nAnd was scared to behold a great grizzly bear.\r\n\r\nSo he screamed in alarm to his slumbering frau,\r\n"Thar\'s a bar in the kitchen as big\'s a cow!"\r\n"A what?" "Why, a bar!" "Well murder him, then!"\r\n"Yes, Betty, I will, if you\'ll first venture in."\r\nSo Betty leaped up, and the poker she seized.\r\nWhile her man shut the door, and against it he squeezed,\r\nAs Betty then laid on the grizzly her blows.\r\nNow on his forehead, and now on his nose,\r\nHer man through the key-hole kept shouting within,\r\n"Well done, my brave Betty, now hit him agin,\r\nNow poke with the poker, and\' poke his eyes out."\r\nSo, with rapping and poking, poor Betty alone\r\nAt last laid Sir Bruin as dead as a stone.\r\n\r\nNow when the old man saw the bear was no more,\r\nHe ventured to poke his nose out of the door,\r\nAnd there was the grizzly stretched on the floor,\r\nThen off to the neighbors he hastened, to tell\r\nAll the wonderful things that that morning befell;\r\nAnd he published the marvellous story afar,\r\nHow "me and my Betty jist slaughtered a bar!\r\nO yes, come and see, all the neighbors they seed it,\r\nCome and see what we did, me and Betty, we did it."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Graves of a Household\r\n\r\n\r\nThey grew in beauty, side by side,\r\n  They filled one home with glee;---\r\nTheir graves are severed, far and wide,\r\n  By mount, and stream and sea.\r\n\r\nThe same fond mother bent at night\r\n  O\'er each fair sleeping brow;\r\nShe had each folded flower in sight--\r\n  Where are those dreamers now?\r\n\r\nOne, \'midst the forest of the West,\r\n  By a dark stream is laid--\r\nThe Indian knows his place of rest\r\n  Far in the cedar shade.\r\n\r\nThe sea, the blue lone sea, hath one--\r\n  He lies where pearls lie deep;\r\n_He_ was the loved of all, yet none\r\n  O\'er his low bed may weep.\r\n\r\nOne sleeps where southern vines are drest\r\n  Above the noble slain:\r\nHe wrapped his colors round his breast\r\n  On a blood-red field of Spain.\r\n\r\nAnd one--o\'er _her_ the myrtle showers\r\n  Its leaves, by soft winds fanned;\r\nShe faded \'midst Italian flowers--\r\n  The last of that bright band.\r\n\r\nAnd parted thus they rest, who play\'d\r\n  Beneath the same green tree;\r\nWhose voices mingled as they pray\'d\r\n  Around the parent knee.\r\n\r\nThey that with smiles lit up the hall,\r\n  And cheer\'d with song the hearth!--\r\nAlas!

Well, well, what\'s that?\r\n  Come up with a smiling face,\r\nIts nothing against you to fall down flat,\r\n  But to lie there--that\'s disgrace.\r\nThe harder you\'re thrown, why, the higher the bounce;\r\n  Be proud of your blackened eye!\r\nIt isn\'t the fact that you\'re licked that counts;\r\n  It\'s how did you fight--and why?\r\n\r\nAnd though you be done to the death, what then?\r\n  If you battled the best you could,\r\nIf you played your part in the world of men,\r\n  Why, the Critic will call it good.\r\nDeath comes with a crawl, or comes with a pounce,\r\n  And whether he\'s slow or spry,\r\nIt isn\'t the fact that you\'re dead that counts,\r\n  But only how did you die?\r\n\r\n    _Edmund Vance Cooke._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Children\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the lessons and tasks are all ended,\r\n  And the school for the day is dismissed,\r\nAnd the little ones gather around me,\r\n  To bid me good-night and be kissed,--\r\nOh, the little white arms that encircle\r\n  My neck in a tender embrace!\r\nOh, the smiles that are halos of Heaven,\r\n  Shedding sunshine and love on my face!\r\n\r\nAnd when they, are gone, I sit dreaming\r\n  Of my childhood, too lovely to last;\r\nOf love that my heart will remember\r\n  When it wakes to the pulse of the past;\r\nEre the world and its wickedness made me\r\n  A partner of sorrow and sin;\r\nWhen the glory of God was about me,\r\n  And the glory of gladness within.\r\n\r\nOh, my heart grows as weak as a woman\'s\r\n  And the fountains of feeling will flow,\r\nWhen I think of the paths, steep and stony\r\n  Where the feet of the dear ones must go.\r\nOf the mountains of sin hanging o\'er them,\r\n  Of the tempests of fate blowing wild--\r\nOh, there\'s nothing on earth half so holy\r\n  As the innocent heart of a child!\r\n\r\nThey are idols of hearts and of households,\r\n  They are angels of God in disguise.\r\nHis sunlight still sleeps in their tresses,\r\n  His glory still beams in their eyes:\r\nOh, those truants from earth and from heaven,\r\n  They have made me more manly and mild!\r\nAnd I know how Jesus could liken\r\n  The Kingdom of God to a child.\r\n\r\nSeek not a life for the dear ones\r\n  All radiant, as others have done.\r\nBut that life may have just enough shadow\r\n  To temper the glare of the sun;\r\nI would pray God to guard them from evil,\r\n  But my prayer would bound back to myself.\r\nAh! A seraph may pray for a sinner,\r\n  But the sinner must pray for himself.\r\n\r\nThe twig is so easily bended,\r\n  I have banished the rule of the rod;\r\nI have taught them the goodness of Knowledge,\r\n  They have taught me the goodness of God.\r\nMy heart is a dungeon of darkness,\r\n  Where I shut them from breaking a rule;\r\nMy frown is sufficient correction,\r\n  My love is the law of the school.\r\n\r\nI shall leave the old house in the autumn\r\n  To traverse the threshold no more,\r\nAh! how I shall sigh for the dear ones\r\n  That meet me each morn at the door.\r\nI shall miss the good-nights and the kisses,\r\n  And the gush of their innocent glee;\r\nThe group on the green and the flowers\r\n  That are brought every morning to me.\r\n\r\nI shall miss them at morn and at evening.\r\n  Their song in the school and the street,\r\nI shall miss the low hum of their voices\r\n  And the tramp of their delicate feet.\r\nWhen the lessons and tasks are all ended,\r\n  And death says the school is dismissed,\r\nMay the little ones gather around me\r\n  To bid me good-night and be kissed.\r\n\r\n    _Charles M.

breakers\' din;\r\nOut where the dark storm-clouds are lifting,\r\nOut where the blinding fog is drifting,\r\nOut where the treacherous sand is shifting,\r\n  My ship is coming in.\r\n\r\nO, I have watched till my eyes were aching,\r\n  Day after weary day;\r\nO, I have hoped till my heart was breaking\r\n  While the long nights ebbed away;\r\nCould I but know where the waves had tossed her,\r\nCould I but know what storms had crossed her,\r\nCould I but know where the winds had lost her,\r\n  Out in the twilight gray!\r\n\r\nBut though the storms her course have altered,\r\n  Surely the port she\'ll win,\r\nNever my faith in my ship has faltered,\r\n  I know she is coming in.\r\nFor through the restless ways of her roaming,\r\nThrough the mad rush of the wild waves foaming,\r\nThrough the white crest of the billows combing,\r\n  My ship is coming in.\r\n\r\nBeating the tides where the gulls are flying,\r\n  Swiftly she\'s coming in:\r\nShallows and deeps and rocks defying,\r\n  Bravely she\'s coming in.\r\nPrecious the love she will bring to bless me,\r\nSnowy the arms she will bring to caress me,\r\nIn the proud purple of kings she will dress me--\r\n  My ship that is coming in.\r\n\r\nWhite in the sunshine her sails will be gleaming,\r\n  See, where my ship comes in;\r\nAt masthead and peak her colors streaming,\r\n  Proudly she\'s sailing in;\r\nLove, hope and joy on her decks are cheering,\r\nMusic will welcome her glad appearing,\r\nAnd my heart will sing at her stately nearing,\r\n  When my ship comes in.\r\n\r\n    _Robert Jones Burdette._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSolitude\r\n\r\n\r\nLaugh, and the world laughs with you,\r\n  Weep, and you weep alone;\r\nFor the sad old earth must borrow its mirth,\r\n  But has trouble enough of its own.\r\n\r\nSing, and the hills will answer,\r\n  Sigh, it is lost on the air;\r\nThe echoes bound to a joyful sound,\r\n  But shirk from voicing care.\r\n\r\nRejoice and men will seek you;\r\n  Grieve, and they turn and go;\r\nThey want full measure of all your pleasure,\r\n  But they do not need your woe.\r\n\r\nBe glad, and your friends are many;\r\n  Be sad, and you lose them all,\r\nThere are none to decline your nectar\'d wine,\r\n  But alone you must drink life\'s gall.\r\n\r\nFeast, and your halls are crowded;\r\n  Fast, and the world goes by;\r\nSucceed and give, and it helps you live,\r\n  But no man can help you die.\r\n\r\nThere is room in the halls of pleasure\r\n  For a large and lordly train,\r\nBut one by one we must all file on\r\n  Through the narrow aisle of pain.\r\n\r\n    _Ella Wheeler Wilcox._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSin of the Coppenter Man\r\n\r\n\r\nThe coppenter man said a wicked word,\r\n  When he hitted his thumb one day,\r\nEn I know what

through each murmuring shroud.\r\nMy forehead was wet with the foam of the spray,\r\nMy heart sighed in secret for those far away;\r\nWhen slowly the morning advanced from the east,\r\nThe toil and the noise of the tempest had ceased;\r\nThe peal from a land I ne\'er saw, seemed to say,\r\n"Let the stranger forget every sorrow to-day!"\r\nYet the short-lived emotion was mingled with pain,\r\nI thought of those eyes I should ne\'er see again;\r\nI thought of the kiss, the last kiss which I gave,\r\nAnd a tear of regret fell unseen on the wave;\r\nI thought of the schemes fond affection had planned,\r\nOf the trees, of the towers, of my own native land.\r\nBut still the sweet sounds, as they swelled to the air,\r\nSeemed tidings of pleasure, though mournful to bear,\r\nAnd I never, till life and its shadows shall end,\r\nCan forget the sweet sound of the bells of Ostend!\r\n\r\n    _W.L.

Oh, say you did not!\r\nFor my poor heart will break if you knew he was there,\r\nAnd thought him too lowly your offerings to share.\r\nHe didn\'t die lowly--he poured his heart\'s blood\r\nIn rich crimson streams, from the top-crowning sod\r\nOf the breastworks which stood in front of the fight--\r\nAnd died shouting, \'Onward! for God and the right!\'\r\nO\'er all his dead comrades your bright garlands wave,\r\nBut you haven\'t put _one_ on _my_ papa\'s grave.\r\nIf mamma were here--but she lies by his side,\r\nHer wearied heart broke when our dear papa died!"\r\n\r\n"Battalion! file left! countermarch!" cried the chief,\r\n"This young orphaned maid hath full cause for her grief."\r\nThen up in his arms from the hot, dusty street,\r\nHe lifted the maiden, while in through the gate\r\nThe long line repasses, and many an eye\r\nPays fresh tribute of tears to the lone orphan\'s sigh.\r\n"This way, it is--here, sir, right under this tree;\r\nThey lie close together, with just room for me."\r\n"Halt! Cover with roses each lowly green mound;\r\nA love pure as this makes these graves hallowed ground."\r\n\r\n"Oh! thank you, kind sir!

What\'s this?" said he, in surprise,\r\nAs he pushed his specs up close to his eyes,\r\nAnd read the address in a child\'s rough plan.\r\n"Dear Saint Nicholas," so it began,\r\n"The other stocking you see on the wall\r\nI have hung up for a child named Clara Hall.\r\n\r\n"She\'s a poor little girl, but very good,\r\nSo I thought, perhaps, you kindly would\r\nFill up her stocking, too, to-night,\r\nAnd help to make her Christmas bright.\r\nIf you\'ve not enough for both stockings there,\r\nPlease put all in Clara\'s, I shall not care."\r\n\r\nSaint Nicholas brushed a tear from his eye,\r\nAnd, "God bless you, darling," he said with a sigh;\r\nThen softly he blew through the chimney high\r\nA note like a bird\'s, as it soars on high,\r\nWhen down came two of the funniest mortals\r\nThat ever were seen this side earth\'s portals.\r\n\r\n"Hurry up," said Saint Nick, "and nicely prepare\r\nAll a little girl wants where money is rare."\r\nThen, oh, what a scene there was in that room!\r\nAway went the elves, but down from the gloom\r\nOf the sooty old chimney came tumbling low\r\nA child\'s whole wardrobe, from head to toe.\r\n\r\nHow Santa Clans laughed, as he gathered them in,\r\nAnd fastened each one to the sock with a pin;\r\nRight to the toe he hung a blue dress,--\r\n"She\'ll think it came from the sky, I guess,"\r\nSaid Saint Nicholas, smoothing the folds of blue,\r\nAnd tying the hood to the stocking, too.\r\n\r\nWhen all the warm clothes were fastened on,\r\nAnd both little socks were filled and done,\r\nThen Santa Claus tucked a toy here and there,\r\nAnd hurried away to the frosty air,\r\nSaying, "God pity the poor, and bless the dear child\r\nWho pities them, too, on this night so wild."\r\n\r\nThe wind caught the words and bore them on high\r\nTill they died away in the midnight sky;\r\nWhile Saint Nicholas flew through the icy air,\r\nBringing "peace and good will" with him everywhere.\r\n\r\n    _Sara Keables Hunt._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI Have a Rendezvous with Death\r\n\r\n\r\n  I have a rendezvous with Death\r\nAt some disputed barricade,\r\nWhen Spring comes back with rustling shade\r\nAnd apple-blossoms fill the air--\r\nI have a rendezvous with Death\r\nWhen Spring brings back blue days and fair.\r\n\r\n  It may be he shall take my hand\r\nAnd lead me into his dark land\r\nAnd close my eyes and quench my breath--\r\nIt may be I shall pass him still.\r\nI have a rendezvous with Death\r\nOn some scarred slope of battered hill,\r\nWhen Spring comes round again this year\r\nAnd the first meadow-flowers appear.\r\n\r\n  God knows\'t were better to be deep\r\nPillowed in silk and scented down,\r\nWhere Love throbs out in blissful sleep,\r\nPulse nigh to pulse, and breath to breath--\r\nWhere hushed awakenings are dear....\r\nBut I\'ve a rendezvous with Death\r\nAt midnight in some flaming town,\r\nWhen Spring trips north again this year,\r\nAnd I to my pledged word am true,\r\nI shall not fail that rendezvous.\r\n\r\n    _Alan Seeger._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLet Us Be Kind\r\n\r\n  Let us be kind;\r\nThe way is long and lonely,\r\nAnd human hearts are asking for this blessing only--\r\n  That we be kind.\r\nWe cannot know the grief that men may borrow,\r\nWe cannot see the souls storm-swept by sorrow,\r\nBut love can shine upon the way to-day, to-morrow--\r\n  Let us be kind.\r\n\r\n  Let us be kind;\r\nThis is a wealth that has no measure,\r\nThis is of Heaven and earth the highest treasure--\r\n  Let us be kind.\r\nA tender word, a smile of love in meeting,\r\nA song of hope and victory to those retreating,\r\nA glimpse of God and brotherhood while life is fleeting--\r\n  Let us be kind.\r\n\r\n  Let us be kind;\r\nAround the world the tears of time are falling,\r\nAnd for the loved and lost these human hearts are calling--\r\n  Let us be kind.\r\nTo age and youth let gracious words be spoken;\r\nUpon the wheel of pain so many lives are broken,\r\nWe live in vain who give no tender token--\r\n  Let us be kind.\r\n\r\n  Let us be kind;\r\nThe sunset tints will soon be in the west,\r\nToo late the flowers are laid then on the quiet breast--\r\n  Let us be kind.\r\nAnd when the angel guides have sought and found us,\r\nTheir hands shall link the broken ties of earth that bound us,\r\nAnd Heaven and home shall brighten all around us--\r\n  Let us be kind.\r\n\r\n    _W.

It fell unceasing down,\r\nTill all the world began to drown;\r\nBut just before it began to pour,\r\nAn old, old man--his name was Noah--\r\nBuilt him an Ark, that he might save\r\nHis family from a wat\'ry grave;\r\nAnd in it also he designed\r\nTo shelter two of every kind\r\nOf beast. Well, dear, when it was done,\r\nAnd heavy clouds obscured the sun,\r\nThe Noah folks to it quickly ran,\r\nAnd then the animals began\r\nTo gravely march along in pairs;\r\nThe leopards, tigers, wolves and bears,\r\nThe deer, the hippopotamuses,\r\nThe rabbits, squirrels, elks, walruses,\r\nThe camels, goats, cats and donkeys,\r\nThe tall giraffes, the beavers, monkeys,\r\nThe rats, the big rhinoceroses,\r\nThe dromedaries and the horses,\r\nThe sheep, and mice and kangaroos,\r\nHyenas, elephants, koodoos,\r\nAnd hundreds more-\'twould take all day,\r\nMy dear, so many names to say--\r\nAnd at the very, very end\r\nOf the procession, by his friend\r\nAnd master, faithful dog was seen;\r\nThe livelong time he\'d helping been,\r\nTo drive the crowd of creatures in;\r\nAnd now, with loud, exultant bark,\r\nHe gaily sprang abroad the Ark.\r\nAlas! so crowded was the space\r\nHe could not in it find a place;\r\nSo, patiently, he turned about,\r\nStood half way in, half way out,\r\nAnd those extremely heavy showers\r\nDescended through nine hundred hours\r\nAnd more; and, darling, at the close,\r\n\'Most frozen was his honest nose;\r\nAnd never could it lose again\r\nThe dampness of that dreadful rain.\r\nAnd that is what, my Curls of Gold,\r\nMade all the doggies\' noses cold.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe African Chief\r\n\r\n\r\nChained in the market-place he stood,\r\n  A man of giant frame,\r\nAmid the gathering multitude\r\n  That shrunk to hear his name--\r\nAll stern of look and strong of limb,\r\n  His dark eye on the ground:--\r\nAnd silently they gazed on him,\r\n  As on a lion bound.\r\n\r\nVainly, but well, that chief had fought,\r\n  He was a captive now,\r\nYet pride, that fortune humbles not,\r\n  Was written on his brow.\r\nThe scars his dark broad bosom wore\r\n  Showed warrior true and brave;\r\nA prince among his tribe before,\r\n  He could not be a slave.\r\n\r\nThen to his conqueror he spake:\r\n  "My brother is a king;\r\nUndo this necklace from my neck,\r\n  And take this bracelet ring,\r\nAnd send me where my brother reigns,\r\n  And I will fill thy hands\r\nWith store of ivory from the plains,\r\n  And gold-dust from the sands."\r\n\r\n"Not for thy ivory nor thy gold\r\n  Will I unbind thy chain;\r\nThat bloody hand shall never hold\r\n  The battle-spear again.\r\nA price thy nation never gave\r\n  Shall yet be paid for thee;\r\nFor thou shalt be the Christian\'s slave,\r\n  In lands beyond the sea."\r\n\r\nThen wept the warrior chief and bade\r\n  To shred his locks away;\r\nAnd one by one, each heavy braid\r\n  Before the victor lay.\r\nThick were the platted locks, and long,\r\n  And deftly hidden there\r\nShone many a wedge of gold among\r\n  The dark and crisp\xc3\xa8d hair.\r\n\r\n"Look, feast thy greedy eye with gold\r\n  Long kept for sorest need:\r\nTake it--thou askest sums untold,\r\n  And say that I am freed.\r\nTake it--my wife, the long, long day\r\n  Weeps by the cocoa-tree,\r\nAnd my young children leave their play,\r\n  And ask in vain for me."\r\n\r\n"I take thy gold--but I have made\r\n  Thy fetters fast and strong,\r\nAnd ween that by the cocoa shade\r\n  Thy wife will wait thee long,"\r\nStrong was the agony that shook\r\n  The captive\'s frame to hear,\r\nAnd the proud meaning of his look\r\n  Was changed to mortal fear.\r\n\r\nHis heart was broken--crazed his brain;\r\n  At once his eye grew wild;\r\nHe struggled fiercely with his chain,\r\n  Whispered, and wept, and smiled;\r\nYet wore not long those fatal bands,\r\n  And once, at shut of day,\r\nThey drew him forth upon the sands,\r\n  The foul hyena\'s prey.\r\n\r\n    _William Cullen Bryant._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe Who Has Vision\r\n\r\n_Where there is no vision the people perish.--Prov. 29:17._\r\n\r\n\r\nHe who has the vision sees more than you or I;\r\nHe who lives the golden dream lives fourfold thereby;\r\nTime may scoff and worlds may laugh, hosts assail his thought,\r\nBut the visionary came ere the builders wrought;\r\nEre the tower bestrode the dome, ere the dome the arch,\r\nHe, the dreamer of the dream, saw the vision march!\r\n\r\nHe who has the vision hears more than you may hear,\r\nUnseen lips from unseen worlds are bent unto his ear;\r\nFrom the hills beyond the clouds messages are borne,\r\nDrifting on the dews of dream to his heart of morn;\r\nTime awaits and ages stay till he wakes and shows\r\nGlimpses of the larger life that his vision knows!\r\n\r\nHe who has the vision feels more than you may feel,\r\nJoy beyond the narrow joy in whose realm we reel--\r\nFor he knows the stars are glad, dawn and middleday,\r\nIn the jocund tide that sweeps dark and dusk away,\r\nHe who has the vision lives round and all complete,\r\nAnd through him alone we draw dews from combs of sweet.\r\n\r\n    _Folger McKinsey._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Children We Keep\r\n\r\n\r\nThe children kept coming one by one,\r\n  Till the boys were five and the girls were three.\r\nAnd the big brown house was alive with fun,\r\n  From the basement floor to the old roof-tree,\r\nLike garden flowers the little ones grew,\r\n  Nurtured and trained with tenderest care;\r\nWarmed by love\'s sunshine, bathed in dew,\r\n  They blossomed into beauty rare.\r\n\r\nBut one of the boys grew weary one day,\r\n  And leaning his head on his mother\'s breast,\r\nHe said, "I am tired and cannot play;\r\n  Let me sit awhile on your knee and rest."\r\nShe cradled him close to her fond embrace,\r\n  She hushed him to sleep with her sweetest song,\r\nAnd rapturous love still lightened his face\r\n  When his spirit had joined the heavenly throng.\r\n\r\nThen the eldest girl, with her thoughtful eyes,\r\n  Who stood where the "brook and the river meet,"\r\nStole softly away into Paradise\r\n  E\'er "the river" had reached her slender feet.\r\nWhile the father\'s eyes on the graves were bent,\r\n  The mother looked upward beyond the skies:\r\n"Our treasures," she whispered, "were only lent;\r\n  Our darlings were angels in earth\'s disguise."\r\n\r\nThe years flew by, and the children began\r\n  With longings to think of the world outside,\r\nAnd as each in turn became a man,\r\n  The boys proudly went from the father\'s side.\r\nThe girls were women so gentle and fair,\r\n  That lovers were speedy to woo and to win;\r\nAnd with orange-blooms in their braided hair,\r\n  Their old home they left, new homes to begin.\r\n\r\nSo, one by one the children have gone--\r\n  The boys were five, the girls were three;\r\nAnd the big brown house is gloomy and alone,\r\n  With but two old folks for its company.\r\nThey talk to each other about the past,\r\n  As they sit together at eventide,\r\nAnd say, "All the children we keep at last\r\n  Are the boy and girl who in childhood died."\r\n\r\n    _Mrs. E.V. Wilson._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Stranger on the Sill\r\n\r\n\r\nBetween broad fields of wheat and corn\r\nIs the lowly home where I was born;\r\nThe peach-tree leans against the wall,\r\nAnd the woodbine wanders over all;\r\nThere is the shaded doorway still,--\r\nBut a stranger\'s foot has crossed the sill.\r\n\r\nThere is the barn--and, as of yore,\r\nI can smell the hay from the open door,\r\nAnd see the busy swallows throng,\r\nAnd hear the pewee\'s mournful song;\r\nBut the stranger comes--oh! painful proof--\r\nHis sheaves are piled to the heated roof.\r\n\r\nThere is the orchard--the very trees\r\nWhere my childhood knew long hours of ease,\r\nAnd watched the shadowy moments run\r\nTill my life imbibed more shade than sun:\r\nThe swing from the bough still sweeps the air,--\r\nBut the stranger\'s children are swinging there.\r\n\r\nThere bubbles the shady spring below,\r\nWith its bulrush brook where the hazels grow;\r\n\'Twas there I found the calamus root,\r\nAnd watched the minnows poise and shoot,\r\nAnd heard the robin lave his wing:--\r\nBut the stranger\'s bucket is at the spring.\r\n\r\nOh, ye who daily cross the sill,\r\nStep lightly, for I love it still!\r\nAnd when you crowd the old barn eaves,\r\nThen think what countless harvest sheaves\r\nHave passed within\' that scented door\r\nTo gladden eyes that are no more.\r\n\r\nDeal kindly with these orchard trees;\r\nAnd when your children crowd your knees,\r\nTheir sweetest fruit they shall impart,\r\nAs if old memories stirred their heart:\r\nTo youthful sport still leave the swing,\r\nAnd in sweet reverence hold the spring.\r\n\r\n    _Thomas Buchanan Read._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Old Man In the Model Church\r\n\r\n\r\nWell, wife, I\'ve found the _model_ church! I worshiped there to-day!\r\nIt made me think of good old times before my hair was gray;\r\nThe meetin\'-house was fixed up more than they were years ago.\r\nBut then I felt, when I went in, it wasn\'t built for show.\r\n\r\nThe sexton didn\'t seat me away back by the door;\r\nHe knew that I was old and deaf, as well as old and poor;\r\nHe must have been a Christian, for he led me boldly through\r\nThe long aisle of that crowded church to find a pleasant pew.\r\n\r\nI wish you\'d heard that singin\'; it had the old-time ring;\r\nThe preacher said, with trumpet voice: "Let all the people sing!"\r\nThe tune was "Coronation," and the music upward rolled,\r\nTill I thought I heard the angels striking all their harps of gold.\r\n\r\nMy deafness seemed to melt away; my spirit caught the fire;\r\nI joined my feeble, trembling voice with that melodious choir,\r\nAnd sang as in my youthful days: "Let angels prostrate fall,\r\nBring forth the royal diadem, and crown Him Lord of all."\r\n\r\nI tell you, wife, it did me good to sing that hymn once more;\r\nI felt like some wrecked mariner who gets a glimpse of shore;\r\nI almost wanted to lay down this weatherbeaten form,\r\nAnd anchor in that blessed port forever from the storm.\r\n\r\n_The preachin\'_? Well, I can\'t just tell all that the preacher said;\r\nI know it wasn\'t written; I know it wasn\'t read;\r\nHe hadn\'t time to read it, for the lightnin\' of his eye\r\nWent flashin\' long from pew to pew, nor passed a sinner by.\r\n\r\nThe sermon wasn\'t flowery; \'twas simple Gospel truth;\r\nIt fitted poor old men like me; it fitted hopeful youth;\r\n\'Twas full of consolation, for weary hearts that bleed;\r\n\'Twas full of invitations, to Christ and not to creed.\r\n\r\nThe preacher made sin hideous in Gentiles and in Jews;\r\nHe shot the golden sentences down in the finest pews;\r\nAnd--though I can\'t see very well--I saw the falling tear\r\nThat told me hell was some ways off, and heaven very near.\r\n\r\nHow swift the golden moments fled within that holy place!\r\nHow brightly beamed the light of heaven from every happy face!\r\nAgain I longed for that sweet time when friend shall meet with friend--\r\n"When congregations ne\'er break up, and Sabbaths have no end."\r\n\r\nI hope to meet that minister--that congregation, too--\r\nIn that dear home beyond the stars that shine from heaven\'s blue;\r\nI doubt not I\'ll remember, beyond life\'s evenin\' gray,\r\nThe happy hour of worship in that model church today.\r\n\r\nDear wife, the fight will soon be fought; the vict\'ry soon be won;\r\nThe shinin\' goal is just ahead; the race is nearly run;\r\nO\'er the river we are nearin\', they are throngin\' to the shore,\r\nTo shout our safe arrival where the weary weep no more.\r\n\r\n    _John H.

W\'y, this is sacrilege!"\r\nThe tramp didn\' hear a word he said, but slouched \'ith stumblin\' feet,\r\nAn\' stalked an\' swaggered up the steps, an\' gained the organ seat.\r\n\r\nHe then went pawin\' thro\' the keys, an\' soon there rose a strain\r\nThet seemed to jest bulge out the heart, an\' \'lectrify the brain;\r\nAn\' then he slapped down on the thing \'ith hands an\' head an\' knees,\r\nHe slam-dashed his hull body down kerflop upon the keys.\r\n\r\nThe organ roared, the music flood went sweepin\' high an\' dry,\r\nIt swelled into the rafters, an\' bulged out into the sky;\r\nThe ol\' church shook and staggered, an\' seemed to reel an\' sway,\r\nAn\' the elder shouted "Glory!" an\' I yelled out "Hooray!!"\r\n\r\nAn\' then he tried a tender strain that melted in our ears,\r\nThet brought up blessed memories and drenched \'em down \'ith tears;\r\nAn\' we dreamed uv ol\' time kitchens, \'ith Tabby on the mat,\r\nUv home an\' luv an\' baby days, an\' Mother, an\' all that!\r\n\r\nAn\' then he struck a streak uv hope--a song from souls forgiven--\r\nThet burst from prison bars uv sin, an\' stormed the gates uv heaven;\r\nThe morning stars together sung--no soul wuz left alone--\r\nWe felt the universe wuz safe, an\' God was on His throne!\r\n\r\nAn\' then a wail of deep despair an\' darkness come again,\r\nAn\' long, black crape hung on the doors uv all the homes uv men;\r\nNo luv, no light, no joy, no hope, no songs of glad delight,\r\nAn\' then--the tramp, he swaggered down an\' reeled out into the night!\r\n\r\nBut we knew he\'d tol\' his story, tho\' he never spoke a word,\r\nAn\' it was the saddest story thet our ears had ever heard;\r\nHe had tol\' his own life history, an\' no eye was dry thet day,\r\nW\'en the elder rose an\' simply said: "My brethren, let up pray."\r\n\r\n    _Sam Walter Foss._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Finding of the Lyre\r\n\r\n\r\nThere lay upon the ocean\'s shore\r\nWhat once a tortoise served to cover;\r\nA year and more, with rush and roar,\r\nThe surf had rolled it over,\r\nHad played with it, and flung it by,\r\nAs wind and weather might decide it,\r\nThen tossed it high where sand-drifts dry\r\nCheap burial might provide it.\r\nIt rested there to bleach or tan,\r\nThe rains had soaked, the suns had burned it;\r\nWith many a ban the fisherman\r\nHad stumbled o\'er and spurned it;\r\nAnd there the fisher-girl would stay,\r\nConjecturing with her brother\r\nHow in their play the poor estray\r\nMight serve some use or other.\r\n\r\nSo there it lay, through wet and dry,\r\nAs empty as the last new sonnet,\r\nTill by and by came Mercury,\r\nAnd, having mused upon it,\r\n"Why, here," cried he, "the thing of things\r\nIn shape, material, and dimension!\r\nGive it but strings, and, lo, it sings,\r\nA wonderful invention!"\r\n\r\nSo said, so done; the chords he strained,\r\nAnd, as his fingers o\'er them hovered,\r\nThe shell disdained a soul had gained,\r\nThe lyre had been discovered.\r\nO empty world that round us lies,\r\nDead shell, of soul and thought forsaken,\r\nBrought we but eyes like Mercury\'s,\r\nIn thee what songs should waken!\r\n\r\n    _James Russel Lowell._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe High Tide (1571)\r\n\r\n(_Or "The Brides of Enderby"_)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe old mayor climbed the belfry tower,\r\n  The ringers rang by two, by three;\r\n"Pull, if ye never pulled before;\r\n  Good ringers, pull your best," quoth he.\r\n"Play uppe, play uppe O Boston bells!\r\nPlay all your changes, all your swells,\r\n  Play uppe \'The Brides of Enderby.\'"\r\n\r\nMen say it was a stolen tyde--\r\n  The Lord that sent it, He knows all;\r\nBut in myne ears doth still abide\r\n  The message that the bells let fall:\r\nAnd there was naught of strange, beside\r\nThe flight of mews ans peewits pied\r\n  By millions crouched on the old sea-wall.\r\n\r\nI sat and spun within the doore,\r\n  My thread break off, I raised myne eyes;\r\nThe level sun, like ruddy ore,\r\n  Lay sinking in the barren skies,\r\nAnd dark against day\'s golden death\r\nShe moved where Lindis wandereth,\r\nMy sonne\'s faire wife, Elizabeth.\r\n\r\n"Cusha!

you soon will learn\r\n  How fast \'twill multiply.\r\nSo when old age comes creeping on,\r\n  You\'ll have a goodly store\r\nOf wealth to furnish all your needs--\r\n  And maybe something more.\r\n\r\nThere\'s shorter cuts to fortune, John,\r\n  We see them every day;\r\nBut those who save their self-respect\r\n  Climb up the good old way.\r\n"All is not gold that glitters," John,\r\n  And makes the vulgar stare,\r\nAnd those we deem the richest, John,\r\n  Have oft the least to spare.\r\n\r\nDon\'t meddle with your neighbors, John,\r\n  Their sorrows or their cares;\r\nYou\'ll find enough to do, my boy,\r\n  To mind your own affairs.\r\nThe world is full of idle tongues--\r\n  You can afford to shirk!\r\nThere\'s lots of people ready, John,\r\n  To do such dirty work.\r\n\r\nAnd if amid the race for fame\r\n  You win a shining prize,\r\nThe humbler work of honest men\r\n  You never should despise;\r\nFor each one has his mission, John,\r\n  In life\'s unchanging plan--\r\nThough lowly be his station, John,\r\n  He is no less a man.\r\n\r\nBe good, be pure, be noble, John;\r\n  Be honest, brave, be true;\r\nAnd do to others as you would\r\n  That they should do to you;\r\nAnd put your trust in God, my boy,\r\n  Though fiery darts be hurled;\r\nThen you can smile at Satan\'s rage,\r\n  And face a frowning world.\r\n\r\nGood-by! May Heaven guard and bless\r\n  Your footsteps day by day;\r\nThe old house will be lonesome, John,\r\n  When you are gone away.\r\nThe cricket\'s song upon the hearth\r\n  Will have a sadder tone;\r\nThe old familiar spots will be\r\n  So lonely when you\'re gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBernardo Del Carpio\r\n\r\nKing Alphonso of Asturias had imprisoned the Count Saldana, about the\r\ntime of the birth of the Count\'s son Bernardo. In an effort to secure\r\nhis father\'s release, Bernardo, when old enough, took up arms. Finally\r\nthe King offered Bernardo possession of his father\'s person, in exchange\r\nfor the Castle of Carpio and all the King\'s subjects there imprisoned.\r\nThe cruel trick played by the King on Bernardo is here described.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe warrior bowed his crested head, and tamed his heart of fire,\r\nAnd sued the haughty king to free his long-imprisoned sire;\r\n"I bring thee here my fortress-keys, I bring my captive train,\r\nI pledge thee faith, my liege, my lord!--oh break my father\'s chain!"\r\n"Rise, rise! even now thy father comes, a ransomed man this day;\r\nMount thy good horse; and thou and I will meet him on his way."\r\n\r\nThen lightly rose that loyal son, and bounded on his steed,\r\nAnd urged, as if with lance in rest, the charger\'s foamy speed.\r\nAnd lo! from far, as on they pressed, there came a glittering band,\r\nWith one that midst them stately rode, as leader in the land:\r\n"Now haste, Bernardo, haste! for there, in very truth, is he,\r\nThe father whom thy faithful heart hath yearned so long to see."\r\n\r\nHis dark eye flashed, his proud breast heaved, his cheek\'s hue came and\r\n      went;\r\nHe reached that gray-haired chieftain\'s side, and there, dismounting, bent;\r\nA lowly knee to earth he bent, his father\'s hand he took--\r\nWhat was there in its touch that all his fiery spirit shook?\r\nThat hand was cold,--a frozen thing,--it dropped from his like lead!\r\nHe looked up to the face above,--the face was of the dead!\r\nA plume waved o\'er the noble brow,--the brow was fixed and white,\r\nHe met, at last, his father\'s eyes, but in them was no sight!\r\n\r\nUp from the ground he sprang and gazed, but who could paint that gaze?\r\nThey hushed their very hearts that saw its horror and amaze.\r\nThey might have chained him, as before that stony form he stood,\r\nFor the power was stricken from his arm, and from his lip the blood.\r\n"Father!" at length he murmured low, and wept like childhood then;\r\nTalk not of grief till thou hast seen the tears of warlike men!\r\n\r\nHe thought on all his glorious hopes, and all his young renown;\r\nHe flung the falchion from his side, and in the dust sat down.\r\nThen covering with his steel-gloved hands his darkly mournful brow:\r\n"No more, there is no more," he said, "to lift the sword for now;\r\nMy king is false, my hope betrayed, my father--oh, the worth,\r\nThe glory, and the loveliness, are passed away from earth!\r\nI thought to stand where banners waved, my sire, beside thee, yet!\r\nI would that there our kindred blood on Spain\'s free soil had met!\r\nThou wouldst have known my spirit then;--for thee my fields were won;\r\nAnd thou hast perished in thy chains, as though thou hadst no son!"\r\n\r\nThen, starting from the ground once more, he seized the monarch\'s rein,\r\nAmidst the pale and \'wildered looks of all the courtier train;\r\nAnd, with a fierce, o\'ermastering grasp, the rearing war-horse led,\r\nAnd sternly set them face to face, the king before the dead:\r\n"Came I not forth, upon thy pledge, my father\'s hand to kiss?\r\nBe still, and gaze thou on, false king! and tell me what is this?\r\nThe voice, the glance, the heart I sought--give answer, where are they?\r\nIf thou wouldst clear thy perjured soul, send life through this cold clay!\r\nInto these glassy eyes put light; be still! keep down thine ire;\r\nBid these white lips a blessing speak, this earth is not my sire.\r\nGive me back him for whom I strove, for whom my blood was shed!\r\nThou canst not?--and a king!--his dust be mountains on thy head."\r\n\r\nHe loosed the steed--his slack hand fell; upon the silent face\r\nHe cast one long, deep, troubled look, then turned from that sad place.\r\nHis hope was crushed, his after fate untold in martial strain;\r\nHis banner led the spears no more, amidst the hills of Spain.\r\n\r\n    _Felicia Hemans._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMizpah\r\n\r\n\r\nGo thou thy way, and I go mine,\r\n  Apart--but not afar.\r\nOnly a thin veil hangs between\r\n  The pathways where we are,\r\nAnd God keep watch \'tween thee and me\r\n  This is my prayer.\r\nHe looks thy way--He looketh mine\r\n  And keeps us near.\r\n\r\nI know not where thy road may lie\r\n  Nor which way mine will be,\r\nIf thine will lead through parching sands\r\n  And mine beside the sea.\r\nYet God keeps watch \'tween thee and me,\r\n  So never fear.\r\nHe holds thy hand--He claspeth mine\r\n  And keeps us near.\r\n\r\nShould wealth and fame perchance be thine\r\n  And my lot lowly be,\r\nOr you be sad and sorrowful\r\n  And glory be for me,\r\nYet God keep watch \'tween thee and me,\r\n  Both are his care.\r\nOne arm round me and one round thee\r\n  Will keep us near.\r\n\r\nI sigh sometimes to see thy face\r\n  But since this may not be\r\nI leave thee to the love of Him\r\n  Who cares for thee and me.\r\n"I\'ll keep ye both beneath My wings,"\r\n  This comforts--dear.\r\nOne wing o\'er thee--and one o\'er me,\r\n  So we are near.\r\n\r\nAnd though our paths be separate\r\n  And thy way be not mine--\r\nYet coming to the mercy seat\r\n  My soul shall meet with thine.\r\nAnd "God keep watch \'tween thee and me"\r\n  I\'ll whisper there.\r\nHe blesses me--He blesses thee\r\n  And we are near.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGod\r\n\r\n\r\nO Thou eternal One!

Glorious! Great!\r\nLight-giving, life-sustaining Potentate!\r\n\r\nThy chains the unmeasured universe surround--\r\nUpheld by Thee, by Thee inspired with breath!\r\nThou the beginning with the end hast bound,\r\nAnd beautifully mingled life and death!\r\nAs sparks mount upward from the fiery blaze,\r\nSo suns are born, so worlds spring forth from Thee;\r\nAnd as the spangles in the sunny rays\r\nShine round the silver snow, the pageantry\r\nOf heaven\'s bright army glitters in Thy praise.\r\n\r\nA million torches, lighted by Thy hand,\r\nWander unwearied through the blue abyss--\r\nThey own Thy power, accomplish Thy command,\r\nAll gay with life, all eloquent with bliss.\r\nWhat shall we call them? Piles of crystal light--\r\nA glorious company of golden streams--\r\nLamps of celestial ether burning bright--\r\nSuns lighting systems with their joyous beams?\r\nBut Thou to these art as the noon to night.\r\n\r\nYes! as a drop of water in the sea,\r\nAll this magnificence in Thee is lost:--\r\nWhat are ten thousand worlds compared to Thee?\r\nAnd what am I then?--Heaven\'s unnumbered host,\r\nThough multiplied by myriads, and arrayed\r\nIn all the glory of sublimest thought,\r\nIs but an atom in the balance, weighed\r\nAgainst Thy greatness--is a cipher brought\r\nAgainst infinity! What am I then? Naught!\r\n\r\nNaught! But the effluence of Thy light divine,\r\nPervading worlds, hath reached my bosom too;\r\nYes! in my spirit doth Thy spirit shine\r\nAs shines the sunbeam in a drop of dew.\r\nNaught! but I live, and on hope\'s pinions fly\r\nEager toward Thy presence; for in Thee\r\nI live, and breathe, and dwell; aspiring high,\r\nEven to the throne of Thy divinity.\r\nI am, O God! and surely Thou must be!\r\n\r\nThou art!--directing, guiding all--Thou art!\r\nDirect my understanding then to Thee;\r\nControl my spirit, guide my wandering heart;\r\nThough but an atom midst immensity,\r\nStill I am something, fashioned by Thy hand!\r\nI hold a middle rank \'twixt heaven and earth--\r\nOn the last verge of mortal being stand.\r\nClose to the realm where angels have their birth,\r\nJust on the boundaries of the spirit-land!\r\n\r\nThe chain of being is complete in me--\r\nIn me is matter\'s last gradation lost,\r\nAnd the next step is spirit--Deity!\r\nI can command the lightning, and am dust!\r\nA monarch and a slave--a worm, a god!\r\nWhence came I here, and how? so marvelously\r\nConstructed and conceived? unknown! this clod\r\nLives surely through some higher energy;\r\nFor from itself alone it could not be!\r\n\r\nCreator, yes! Thy wisdom and Thy word\r\nCreated me! Thou source of life and good!\r\nThou spirit of my spirit, and my Lord!\r\nThy light, Thy love, in their bright plenitude\r\nFilled me with an immortal soul, to spring\r\nOver the abyss of death; and bade it wear\r\nThe garments of eternal day, and wing\r\nIts heavenly flight beyond this little sphere,\r\nEven to its source--to Thee--its Author there.\r\n\r\nO thoughts ineffable! O visions blest!\r\nThough worthless our conceptions all of Thee,\r\nYet shall Thy shadowed image fill our breast.\r\nAnd waft its homage to Thy Deity.\r\nGod! thus alone my lowly thoughts can soar,\r\nThus seek thy presence--Being wise and good!\r\nMidst Thy vast works admire, obey, adore;\r\nAnd when the tongue is eloquent no more\r\nThe soul shall speak in tears of gratitude.\r\n\r\n    _Gabriel Somanovitch Derzhavin._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCasabianca\r\n\r\n\r\nThe boy stood on the burning deck,\r\n  Whence all but him had fled;\r\nThe flame that lit the battle\'s wreck\r\n  Shone round him o\'er the dead.\r\n\r\nYet beautiful and bright he stood,\r\n  As born to rule the storm;\r\nA creature of heroic blood,\r\n  A proud, though childlike form.\r\n\r\nThe flames roll\'d on--he would not go\r\n  Without his father\'s word;\r\nThat father, faint in death below,\r\n  His voice no longer heard.\r\n\r\nHe called aloud: "Say, father, say\r\n  If yet my task is done?"\r\nHe knew not that the chieftain lay\r\n  Unconscious of his son.\r\n\r\n"Speak, father!" once again he cried,\r\n  "If I may yet be gone!"\r\nAnd but the booming shots replied,\r\n  And fast the flames roll\'d on.\r\n\r\nUpon his brow he felt their breath,\r\n  And in his waving hair;\r\nAnd looked from that lone post of death\r\n  In still, yet brave despair.\r\n\r\nAnd shouted but once more aloud,\r\n  "My father! must I stay?"\r\nWhile o\'er him fast, through sail and shroud,\r\n  The wreathing fires made way.\r\n\r\nThey wrapt the ship in splendor wild,\r\n  They caught the flag on high,\r\nAnd streamed above the gallant child,\r\n  Like banners in the sky.\r\n\r\nThere came a burst of thunder sound--\r\n  The boy--oh! where was he?\r\nAsk of the winds that far around\r\n  With fragments strewed the sea!\r\n\r\nWith mast, and helm, and pennon fair,\r\n  That well had borne their part--\r\nBut the noblest thing that perished there\r\n  Was that young, faithful heart.\r\n\r\n    _Felicia Hemans._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMonterey\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were not many,--we who stood\r\n  Before the iron sleet that day;\r\nYet many a gallant spirit would\r\nGive half his years if he but could\r\n  Have been with us at Monterey.\r\n\r\nNow here, now there, the shot it hailed\r\n  In deadly drifts of fiery spray,\r\nYet not a single soldier quailed\r\nWhen wounded comrades round them wailed\r\n  Their dying shout at Monterey.\r\n\r\nAnd on, still on our column kept,\r\n  Through walls of flame, its withering way;\r\nWhere fell the dead, the living stept,\r\nStill charging on the guns which swept\r\n  The slippery streets of Monterey.\r\n\r\nThe foe himself recoiled aghast,\r\n  When, striking where he strongest lay,\r\nWe swooped his flanking batteries past,\r\nAnd braving full their murderous blast,\r\n  Stormed home the towers of Monterey.\r\n\r\nOur banners on those turrets wave,\r\n  And there our evening bugles play;\r\nWhere orange boughs above their grave\r\nKeep green the memory of the brave\r\n  Who fought and fell at Monterey.\r\n\r\nWe are not many, we who pressed\r\n  Beside the brave who fell that day;\r\nBut who of us has not confessed\r\nHe\'d rather share their warrior rest,\r\n  Than not have been at Monterey?\r\n\r\n    _Charles Fenno Hoffman._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Teacher\'s "If"\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you can take your dreams into the classroom,\r\n  And always make them part of each day\'s work--\r\nIf you can face the countless petty problems\r\n  Nor turn from them nor ever try to shirk--\r\nIf you can live so that the child you work with\r\n  Deep in his heart knows you to be a man--\r\nIf you can take "I can\'t" from out his language\r\n  And put in place a vigorous "I can"--\r\n\r\nIf you can take Love with you to the classroom,\r\n  And yet on Firmness never shut the door--\r\nIf you can teach a child the love of Nature\r\n  So that he helps himself to all her store--\r\nIf you can teach him life is what we make it,\r\n  That he himself can be his only bar--\r\nIf you can tell him something of the heavens,\r\n  Or something of the wonder of a star--\r\n\r\nIf you, with simple bits of truth and honor,\r\n  His better self occasionally reach--\r\nAnd yet not overdo nor have him dub you\r\n  As one who is inclined to ever preach--\r\nIf you impart to him a bit of liking\r\n  For all the wondrous things we find in print--\r\nYet have him understand that to be happy,\r\n  Play, exercise, fresh air he must not stint--\r\n\r\nIf you can give of all the best that\'s in you,\r\n  And in the giving always happy be--\r\nIf you can find the good that\'s hidden somewhere\r\n  Deep in the heart of every child you see--\r\nIf you can do these things and all the others\r\n  That teachers everywhere do every day--\r\nYou\'re in the work that you were surely meant for;\r\n  Take hold of it!

Gale._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Good Shepherd\r\n\r\n\r\nThere were ninety and nine\r\nOf a flock, sleek and fine\r\n  In a sheltering cote in the vale;\r\nBut a lamb was away,\r\nOn the mountain astray,\r\n  Unprotected within the safe pale.\r\n\r\nThen the sleet and the rain\r\nOn the mountain and plain,\r\n  And the wind fiercely blowing a gale,\r\nAnd the night\'s growing dark,\r\nAnd the wolf\'s hungry bark\r\n  Stir the soul of the shepherd so hale.\r\n\r\nAnd he says, "Hireling, go;\r\nFor a lamb\'s in the snow\r\n  And exposed to the wild hungry beast;\r\n\'Tis no time to keep seat,\r\nNor to rest weary feet,\r\n  Nor to sit at a bounteous feast."\r\n\r\nThen the hireling replied,\r\n"Here you have at your side\r\n  All your flock save this one little sheep.\r\nAre the ninety and nine,\r\nAll so safe and so fine,\r\n  Not enough for the shepherd to keep?"\r\n\r\nThen the shepherd replied,\r\n"Ah! this lamb from my side\r\n  Presses near, very near, to my heart.\r\nNot its value in pay\r\nMakes me urge in this way,\r\n  But the longings and achings of heart."\r\n\r\n"Let me wait till the day,\r\nO good shepherd, I pray;\r\n  For I shudder to go in the dark\r\nOn the mountain so high\r\nAnd its precipice nigh\r\n  \'Mong the wolves with their frightening bark."\r\n\r\nThen the shepherd said, "No;\r\nSurely some one must go\r\n  Who can rescue my lamb from the cold,\r\nFrom the wolf\'s hungry maw\r\nAnd the lion\'s fierce paw\r\n  And restore it again to the fold."\r\n\r\nThen the shepherd goes out\r\nWith his cloak girt about\r\n  And his rod and his staff in his hand.\r\nWhat cares he for the cold\r\nIf his sheep to the fold\r\n  He can bring from the dark mountain land?\r\n\r\nYou can hear his clear voice\r\nAs the mountains rejoice,\r\n  "Sheepy sheep, sheepy sheep, sheepy sheep!"\r\nUp the hillside so steep,\r\nInto caverns so deep,\r\n  "Sheepy sheep, sheepy sheep, sheepy sheep!"\r\n\r\nNow he hears its weak "baa,"\r\nAnd he answers it, "Ah!\r\n  Sheepy sheep, sheepy sheep, sheepy sheep!"\r\nThen its answering bleat\r\nHurries on his glad feet,\r\n  And his arms gather up his lost sheep.\r\n\r\nWet and cold on his breast\r\nThe lost lamb found its rest\r\n  As he bore it adown to the fold.\r\nAnd the ninety and nine\r\nBleat for joy down the line,\r\n  That it\'s safe from the wolf and the cold.\r\n\r\nThen he said to his friends,\r\n"Now let joy make amends\r\n  For the steeps and the deeps I have crossed--\r\nFor the pelting of sleet\r\nAnd my sore, weary feet,\r\n  For I\'ve found the dear lamb that was lost."\r\n\r\nLet the hirelings upbraid\r\nFor the nights that He stayed\r\n  On the mountains so rugged and high.\r\nSurely never a jeer\r\nFrom my lips shall one hear,\r\n  For--that poor lonely lambkin--was--I.\r\n\r\nWhile the eons shall roll\r\nO\'er my glad ransomed soul\r\n  I will praise the Good Shepherd above,\r\nFor a place on His breast,\r\nFor its comfort and rest,\r\n  For His wonderful, wonderful love.\r\n\r\n    _D. N. Howe._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Sermon in Rhyme\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you have a friend worth loving,\r\n  Love him. Yes, and let him know\r\nThat you love him ere life\'s evening\r\n  Tinge his brow with sunset glow;\r\nWhy should good words ne\'er be said\r\nOf a friend--till he is dead?\r\n\r\nIf you hear a song that thrills you,\r\n  Sung by any child of song,\r\nPraise it. Do not let the singer\r\n  Wait deserved praises long;\r\nWhy should one that thrills your heart\r\nLack that joy it may impart?\r\n\r\nIf you hear a prayer that moves you\r\n  By its humble pleading tone,\r\nJoin it. Do not let the seeker\r\n  Bow before his God alone;\r\nWhy should not your brother share\r\nThe strength of "two or three" in prayer?\r\n\r\nIf you see the hot tears falling\r\n  From a loving brother\'s eyes,\r\nShare them, and by sharing,\r\n  Own your kinship with the skies;\r\nWhy should anyone be glad,\r\nWhen his brother\'s heart is sad?\r\n\r\nIf a silver laugh goes rippling\r\n  Through the sunshine on his face,\r\nShare it. \'Tis the wise man\'s saying,\r\n  For both grief and joy a place;\r\nThere\'s health and goodness in the mirth\r\nIn which an honest laugh has birth.\r\n\r\nIf your work is made more easy\r\n  By a friendly helping hand,\r\nSay so. Speak out brave and truly,\r\n  Ere the darkness veil the land.\r\nShould a brother workman dear\r\nFalter for a word of cheer?\r\n\r\nScatter thus your seed of kindness,\r\n  All enriching as you go--\r\nLeave them, trust the Harvest-Giver;\r\n  He will make each seed to grow.\r\nSo, until its happy end,\r\nYour life shall never lack a friend.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fortunate Isles\r\n\r\n\r\nYou sail and you seek for the Fortunate Isles,\r\n  The old Greek Isles of the yellow bird\'s song?\r\nThen steer right on through the watery miles,\r\n  Straight on, straight on, and you can\'t go wrong.\r\nNay, not to the left, nay, not to the right;\r\nBut on, straight on, and the Isles are in sight,\r\nThe Fortunate Isles, where the yellow birds sing\r\nAnd life lies girt with a golden ring.\r\n\r\nThese Fortunate Isles, they are not far;\r\n  They lie within reach of the lowliest door;\r\nYou can see them gleam by the twilight star;\r\n  You can hear them sing by the moon\'s white shore,\r\nNay, never look back! Those leveled gravestones,\r\nThey were landing steps; they were steps unto thrones\r\nOf glory for souls that have sailed before\r\nAnd have set white feet on the fortunate shore.\r\n\r\nAnd what are the names of the Fortunate Isles?\r\n  Why, Duty and Love and a large content.\r\nLo! there are the isles of the watery miles\r\n  That God let down from the firmament;\r\nLo! Duty and Love, and a true man\'s trust;\r\nYour forehead to God and your feet in the dust;\r\nLo! Duty and Love, and a sweet babe\'s smiles,\r\nAnd there, O friend, are the Fortunate Isles.\r\n\r\n    _Joaquin Miller._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat the Choir Sang About the New Bonnet\r\n\r\n\r\nA foolish little maiden bought a foolish little bonnet,\r\nWith a ribbon, and a feather, and a bit of lace upon it;\r\nAnd that the other maidens of the little town might know it,\r\nShe thought she\'d go to meeting the next Sunday just to show it.\r\n\r\nBut though the little bonnet was scarce larger than a dime,\r\nThe getting of it settled proved to be a work of time;\r\nSo when \'twas fairly tied, all the bells had stopped their ringing,\r\nAnd when she came to meeting, sure enough the folks were singing.\r\n\r\nSo this foolish little maiden stood and waited at the door;\r\nAnd she shook her ruffles out behind and smoothed them down before.\r\n"Hallelujah! hallelujah!" sang the choir above her head.\r\n"Hardly knew you! hardly knew you!" were the words she thought they said.\r\n\r\nThis made the little maiden feel so very, very cross,\r\nThat she gave her little mouth a twist, her little head a toss;\r\nFor she thought the very hymn they sang was all about her bonnet,\r\nWith the ribbon, and the feather, and the bit of lace upon it.\r\n\r\nAnd she would not wait to listen to the sermon or the prayer,\r\nBut pattered down the silent street, and hurried up the stair,\r\nTill she reached her little bureau, and in a band-box on it,\r\nHad hidden, safe from critics\' eyes, her foolish little bonnet.\r\n\r\nWhich proves, my little maidens, that each of you will find\r\nIn every Sabbath service but an echo of your mind;\r\nAnd the silly little head, that\'s filled with silly little airs,\r\nWill never get a blessing from sermon or from prayers.\r\n\r\n    _M. T. Morrison._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWork Thou for Pleasure\r\n\r\n\r\nWork thou for pleasure; paint or sing or carve\r\nThe thing thou lovest, though the body starve.\r\nWho works for glory misses oft the goal;\r\nWho works for money coins his very soul.\r\nWork for work\'s sake then, and it well may be\r\nThat these things shall be added unto thee.\r\n\r\n    _Kenyon Cox._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Tin Gee Gee\r\n\r\n\r\nI was strolling one day down the Lawther Arcade,\r\nThat place for children\'s toys,\r\nWhere you can purchase a dolly or spade\r\nFor your good little girls and boys.\r\nAnd as I passed a certain stall, said a wee little voice to me:\r\nO, I am a Colonel in a little cocked hat, and I ride on a tin Gee Gee;\r\nO, I am a Colonel in a little cocked hat, and I ride on a tin Gee Gee.\r\n\r\nThen I looked and a little tin soldier I saw,\r\nIn his little cocked hat so fine.\r\nHe\'d a little tin sword that shone in the light\r\nAs he led a glittering line of tin hussars,\r\nWhose sabers flashed in a manner \xc3\xa0 la military.\r\nAnd that little tin soldier he rode at their head,\r\nSo proud on his tin Gee Gee.\r\n\r\nThen that little tin soldier he sobbed and he sighed,\r\nSo I patted his little tin head.\r\nWhat vexes your little tin soul? said I,\r\nAnd this is what he said:\r\nI\'ve been on this stall a very long time,\r\nAnd I\'m marked twenty-nine, as you see;\r\nWhilst just on the shelf above my head,\r\nThere\'s a fellow marked sixty-three.\r\n\r\nNow he hasn\'t got a sword and he hasn\'t got a horse,\r\nAnd I\'m quite as good as he.\r\nSo why mark me at twenty-nine,\r\nAnd him at sixty-three?\r\nThere\'s a pretty little dolly girl over there,\r\nAnd I\'m madly in love with she.\r\nBut now that I\'m only marked twenty-nine,\r\nShe turns up her nose at me,\r\nShe turns up her little wax nose at me,\r\nAnd carries on with sixty-three.\r\n\r\nAnd, oh, she\'s dressed in a beautiful dress;\r\nIt\'s a dress I do admire,\r\nShe has pearly blue eyes that open and shut\r\nWhen worked inside by a wire,\r\nAnd once on a time when the folks had gone,\r\nShe used to ogle at me.\r\nBut now that I\'m only marked twenty-nine,\r\nShe turns up her nose at me.\r\nShe turns up her little snub nose at me,\r\nAnd carries on with sixty-three.\r\n\r\nCheer up, my little tin man, said I,\r\nI\'ll see what I can do.\r\nYou\'re a fine little fellow, and it\'s a shame\r\nThat she should so treat you.\r\nSo I took down the label from the shelf above,\r\nAnd I labeled him sixty-three,\r\nAnd I marked the other one twenty-nine,\r\nWhich was _very, very_ wrong of me,\r\nBut I felt so sorry for that little tin soul,\r\nAs he rode on his tin Gee Gee.\r\n\r\nNow that little tin soldier he puffed with pride,\r\nAt being marked sixty-three,\r\nAnd that saucy little dolly girl smiled once more,\r\nFor he\'d risen in life, do you see?\r\nAnd it\'s so in this world; for I\'m in love\r\nWith a maiden of high degree;\r\nBut I am only marked twenty-nine,\r\nAnd the other chap\'s sixty-three--\r\nAnd a girl never looks at twenty-nine\r\nWith a possible sixty-three!\r\n\r\n    _Fred

a rattling!\r\n    What a battling!\r\n    What a shuffling!\r\n    What a scuffling!\r\nAs the weaver makes his shuttle\r\nHither, thither, scud and scuttle.\r\nThreads in single, threads in double;\r\nHow they mingle, what a trouble!\r\nEvery color, what profusion!\r\nEvery motion, what confusion!\r\nWhile the web and woof are mingling,\r\nSignal bells above are jingling,--\r\nTelling how each figure ranges,\r\nTelling when the color changes,\r\nAs the weaver makes his shuttle\r\nHither, thither, scud and scuttle.\r\n\r\nThe weaver at his loom is sitting,\r\nThrows his shuttle to

for woof its kings and sages,\r\nTakes the nobles and their pages,\r\nTakes all stations and all stages,--\r\nThrones are bobbins in His shuttle;\r\nArmies make them scud and scuttle;\r\nWeb into the woof must flow,\r\nUp and down the nations go,\r\nAs the weaver wills they go;\r\n    Men are sparring,\r\n    Powers are jarring,\r\nUpward, downward, hither, thither\r\nJust like puppets in a

shuttle,\r\nHither, thither, scud and scuttle?\r\n\r\nGlorious wonder! what a weaving!\r\nTo the dull beyond believing!\r\nSuch, no fabled ages know.\r\nOnly _Faith_ can see the mystery,\r\nHow, along the aisle of history\r\nWhere the feet of sages go,\r\nLoveliest to the purest eyes,\r\nGrand the mystic tapet lies,--\r\nSoft and smooth, and even spreading\r\nEvery figure has its plaidings,\r\nAs if made for angels\' treading;\r\nTufted circles touching ever,\r\nInwrought figures fading never;\r\nBrighter form and softer shadings;\r\nEach illumined,--what a riddle\r\nFrom a cross that gems the middle.\r\n\r\n\'Tis a saying--some reject it--\r\nThat its light is all reflected;\r\nThat the tapet\'s hues are given\r\nBy a sun that shines in heaven!\r\n\'Tis believed, by all believing,\r\nThat great God himself is weaving,--\r\nBringing out the world\'s dark mystery,\r\nIn the light of truth and history;\r\nAnd as web and woof diminish,\r\nComes the grand and glorious finish;\r\nWhen begin the golden ages\r\nLong foretold by seers and sages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Mortgage on the Farm\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Tis gone at last, and I am glad; it stayed a fearful while,\r\nAnd when the world was light and gay, I could not even smile;\r\nIt stood before me like a giant, outstretched its iron arm;\r\nNo matter where I looked, I saw the mortgage on the farm.\r\n\r\nI\'ll tell you how it happened, for I want the world to know\r\nHow glad I am this winter day whilst earth is white with snow;\r\nI\'m just as happy as a lark. No cause for rude alarm\r\nConfronts us now, for lifted is the mortgage on the farm.\r\n\r\nThe children they were growing up and they were smart and trim.\r\nTo some big college in the East we\'d sent our youngest, Jim;\r\nAnd every time he wrote us, at the bottom of his screed\r\nHe tacked some Latin fol-de-rol which none of us could read.\r\n\r\nThe girls they ran to music, and to painting, and to rhymes,\r\nThey said the house was out of style and far behind the times;\r\nThey suddenly diskivered that it didn\'t keep\'m warm--\r\nAnother step of course towards a mortgage on the farm.\r\n\r\nWe took a cranky notion, Hannah Jane and me one day,\r\nWhile we were coming home from town, a-talking all the way;\r\nThe old house wasn\'t big enough for us, although for years\r\nBeneath its humble roof we\'d shared each other\'s joys and tears.\r\n\r\nWe built it o\'er and when \'twas done, I wish you could have seen it,\r\nIt was a most tremendous thing--I really didn\'t mean it;\r\nWhy, it was big enough to hold the people of the town\r\nAnd not one half as cosy as the old one we pulled down.\r\n\r\nI bought a fine pianner and it shortened still the pile,\r\nBut, then, it pleased the children and they banged it all the while;\r\nNo matter what they played for me, their music had no charm,\r\nFor every tune said plainly: "There\'s a mortgage on the farm!"\r\n\r\nI worked from morn till eve, and toiled as often toils the slave\r\nTo meet that grisly interest; I tried hard to be brave,\r\nAnd oft when I came home at night with tired brain and arm,\r\nThe chickens hung their heads, they felt the mortgage on the farm.--\r\n\r\nBut we saved a penny now and then, we laid them in a row,\r\nThe girls they played the same old tunes, and let the new ones go;\r\nAnd when from college came our Jim with laurels on his brow,\r\nI led him to the stumpy field and put him to the plow.\r\n\r\nHe something said in Latin which I didn\'t understand,\r\nBut it did me good to see his plow turn up the dewy land;\r\nAnd when the year had ended and empty were the cribs,\r\nWe found we\'d hit the mortgage, sir, a blow between the ribs.\r\n\r\nTo-day I harnessed up the team and thundered off to town,\r\nAnd in the lawyer\'s sight I planked the last bright dollar down;\r\nAnd when I trotted up the lanes a-feeling good and warm,\r\nThe old red rooster crowed his best: "No mortgage on the farm!"\r\n\r\nI\'ll sleep almighty good to-night, the best for many a day,\r\nThe skeleton that haunted us has passed fore\'er away.\r\nThe girls can play the brand-new tunes with no fears to alarm,\r\nAnd Jim can go to Congress, with no mortgage on the farm!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Legend Beautiful\r\n\r\n\r\n"Hadst thou stayed, I must have fled!"\r\nThat is what the vision said.\r\n\r\nIn his chamber all alone,\r\nKneeling on the floor of stone,\r\nPrayed the Monk in deep contrition\r\nFor his sins of indecision,\r\nPrayed for greater self-denial\r\nIn temptation and in trial;\r\nIt was noonday by the dial,\r\nAnd the Monk was all alone.\r\n\r\nSuddenly, as if it lightened,\r\nAn unwonted splendor brightened\r\nAll within him and without him\r\nIn that narrow cell of stone;\r\nAnd he saw the blessed vision\r\nOf our Lord, with light Elysian\r\nLike a vesture wrapped about Him,\r\nLike a garment round Him thrown.\r\n\r\nNot as crucified and slain\r\nNot in agonies of pain,\r\nNot with bleeding hands and feet,\r\nDid the Monk his Master see;\r\nBut as in the village street,\r\nIn the house or harvest field,\r\nHalt and lame and blind He healed,\r\nWhen He walked in Galilee.\r\n\r\nIn as attitude imploring,\r\nHands upon his bosom crossed,\r\nWondering, worshiping, adoring,\r\nKnelt the Monk, in rapture lost,\r\nLord, he thought, in heaven that reignest,\r\nWho am I that thus Thou deignest\r\nTo reveal Thyself to me?\r\nWho am I, that from the center\r\nOf Thy glory Thou shouldst enter\r\nThis poor cell, my guest to be?\r\n\r\nThen amid his exaltation,\r\nLoud the convent bell appalling,\r\nFrom its belfrey calling, calling,\r\nRang through court and corridor\r\nWith persistent iteration,\r\nHe had never heard before.\r\nIt was now the appointed hour\r\nWhen alike in shine or shower,\r\nWinter\'s cold or summer\'s heat,\r\nTo the convent portals came\r\nAll the blind and halt and lame,\r\nAll the beggars of the street,\r\nFor their daily dole of food\r\nDealt them by the brotherhood;\r\n\r\nAnd their almoner was he\r\nWho upon his bended knees\r\nRapt in silent ecstasy\r\nOf divinest self-surrender,\r\nSaw the vision and the splendor.\r\n\r\nDeep distress and hesitation\r\nMingled with his adoration;\r\nShould he go, or should he stay?\r\nShould he leave the poor to wait\r\nHungry at the convent gate,\r\nTill the vision passed away?\r\nShould he slight his radiant guest,\r\nSlight this visitant celestial\r\nFor a crowd of ragged, bestial\r\nBeggars at the convent gate?\r\nWould the vision there remain?\r\nWould the vision come again?\r\nThen a voice within his breast\r\nWhispered audible and clear,\r\nAs if to the outward ear:\r\n"Do thy duty; that is best;\r\nLeave unto thy Lord the rest!"\r\n\r\nStraightway to his feet he started,\r\nAnd with longing look intent\r\nOn the blessed vision bent,\r\nSlowly from his cell departed,\r\nSlowly on his errand went.\r\n\r\nAt the gate the poor were waiting,\r\nLooking through the iron grating,\r\nWith that terror in the eye\r\nThat is only seen in those\r\nWho amid their wants and woes\r\nHear the sound of doors that close.\r\nAnd of feet that pass them by:\r\nGrown familiar with disfavor,\r\nGrown familiar with the savor\r\nOf the bread by which men die;\r\nBut to-day, they knew not why,\r\nLike the gate of Paradise\r\nSeemed the convent gate to rise,\r\nLike a sacrament divine\r\nSeemed to them the bread and wine.\r\nIn his heart the Monk was praying,\r\nThinking of the homeless poor,\r\nWhat they suffer and endure;\r\nWhat we see not, what we see;\r\nAnd the inward voice was saying:\r\n"Whatsoever thing thou doest\r\nTo the least of mine and lowest,\r\nThat thou doest unto me."\r\n\r\nUnto me! but had the vision\r\nCome to him in beggar\'s clothing,\r\nCome a mendicant imploring,\r\nWould he then have knelt adoring,\r\nOr have listened with derision,\r\nAnd have turned away with loathing?\r\n\r\nThus his conscience put the question,\r\nFull of troublesome suggestion,\r\nAs at length, with hurried pace,\r\nToward his cell he turned his face,\r\nAnd beheld the convent bright\r\nWith a supernatural light,\r\nLike a luminous cloud expanding\r\nOver floor and wall and ceiling.\r\n\r\nBut he paused with awe-struck feeling\r\nAt the threshold of his door,\r\nFor the vision still was standing\r\nAs he left it there before,\r\nWhen the convent bell appalling,\r\nFrom its belfry calling, calling,\r\nSummoned him to feed the poor.\r\nThrough the long hour intervening\r\nIt had waited his return,\r\nAnd he felt his bosom burn,\r\nComprehending all the meaning,\r\nWhen the blessed vision said:\r\n"Hadst thou stayed, I must have fled."\r\n\r\n    _Henry W. Longfellow._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSomebody\'s Darling\r\n\r\n\r\nInto a ward of the whitewashed halls,\r\n  Where the dead and dying lay,\r\nWounded by bayonets, shells, and balls,\r\n  Somebody\'s Darling was borne one day--\r\n\r\nSomebody\'s Darling, so young and so brave,\r\n  Wearing yet on his pale, sweet face,\r\nSoon to be hid by the dust of the grave,\r\n  The lingering light of his boyhood\'s grace.\r\n\r\nMatted and damp are the curls of gold,\r\n  Kissing the snow of the fair young brow,\r\nPale are the lips of delicate mold--\r\n  Somebody\'s Darling is dying now.\r\n\r\nBack from his beautiful blue-veined brow\r\n  Brush all the wandering waves of gold,\r\nCross his hands on his bosom now--\r\n  Somebody\'s Darling is still and cold.\r\n\r\nKiss him once for somebody\'s sake,\r\n  Murmur a prayer both soft and low;\r\nOne bright curl from its fair mates take--\r\n  They were somebody\'s pride, you know.\r\n\r\nSomebody\'s hand hath rested there--\r\n  Was it a mother\'s, soft and white?\r\nAnd have the lips of a sister fair\r\n  Been baptized in their waves of light?\r\n\r\nGod knows best! he was somebody\'s love;\r\n  Somebody\'s heart enshrined him there;\r\nSomebody wafted his name above,\r\n  Night and morn on the wings of prayer.\r\n\r\nSomebody wept when he marched away,\r\n  Looking so handsome, brave, and grand;\r\nSomebody\'s kiss on his forehead lay,\r\n  Somebody clung to his parting hand.\r\n\r\nSomebody\'s waiting and watching for him--\r\n  Yearning to hold him again to her heart;\r\nAnd there he lies with his blue eyes dim,\r\n  And the smiling, child-like lips apart.\r\n\r\nTenderly bury the fair young dead,\r\n  Pausing to drop on his grave a tear;\r\nCarve in the wooden slab at his head,\r\n  "Somebody\'s Darling slumbers here."\r\n\r\n    _Maria La Coste._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Pride of Battery B\r\n\r\n\r\nSouth Mountain towered upon our right, far off the river lay,\r\nAnd over on the wooded height we held their lines at bay.\r\nAt last the muttering guns were still; the day died slow and wan;\r\nAt last the gunners pipes did fill, the sergeant\'s yarns began.\r\nWhen, as the wind a moment blew aside the fragrant flood\r\nOur brierwoods raised, within our view a little maiden stood.\r\nA tiny tot of six or seven, from fireside fresh she seemed,\r\n(Of such a little one in heaven one soldier often dreamed.)\r\nAnd as we stared, her little hand went to her curly head\r\nIn grave salute. "And who are _you_?" at length the sergeant said.\r\n"And where\'s your home?" he growled again. She lisped out, "Who is me?\r\nWhy, don\'t you know? I\'m little Jane, the Pride of Battery B.\r\nMy home? Why, that was burned away, and pa and ma are dead;\r\nAnd so I ride the guns all day along with Sergeant Ned.\r\nAnd I\'ve a drum that\'s not a toy, a cap with feathers, too;\r\nAnd I march beside the drummer boy on Sundays at review.\r\nBut now our \'bacca\'s all give out, the men can\'t have their smoke,\r\nAnd so they\'re cross--why, even Ned won\'t play with me and joke.\r\nAnd the big colonel said to-day--I hate to hear him swear--\r\nHe\'d give a leg for a good pipe like the Yanks had over there.\r\nAnd so I thought when beat the drum,  and the big guns were still,\r\nI\'d creep beneath the tent and come out here across the hill\r\nAnd beg, good Mister Yankee men, you\'d give me some \'Lone Jack.\'\r\nPlease do: when we get some again, I\'ll surely bring it back.\r\nIndeed I will, for Ned--says he,--if I do what I say,\r\nI\'ll be a general yet, maybe, and ride a prancing bay."\r\n\r\nWe brimmed her tiny apron o\'er; you should have heard her laugh\r\nAs each man from his scanty store shook out a generous half.\r\nTo kiss the little mouth stooped down a score of grimy men,\r\nUntil the sergeant\'s husky voice said,"\'Tention squad!" and then\r\nWe gave her escort, till good-night the pretty waif we bid,\r\nAnd watched her toddle out of sight--or else \'twas tears that hid\r\nHer tiny form--nor turned about a man, nor spoke a word,\r\nTill after awhile a far, hoarse shout upon the wind we heard!\r\nWe sent it back, then cast sad eyes upon the scene around;\r\nA baby\'s hand had touched the ties that brothers once had bound.\r\n\r\nThat\'s all--save when the dawn awoke again the work of hell,\r\nAnd through the sullen clouds of smoke the screaming missiles fell,\r\nOur general often rubbed his glass, and marveled much to see\r\nNot a single shell that whole day fell in the camp of Battery B.\r\n\r\n    _Frank H. Gassaway._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Wood-Box\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was kept out in the kitchen, and \'twas long and deep and wide,\r\nAnd the poker hung above it and the shovel stood beside,\r\nAnd the big, black cookstove, grinnin\' through its grate from ear to ear,\r\nSeemed to look as if it loved it like a brother, pretty near.\r\nFlowered oilcloth tacked around it kept its cracks and knot-holes hid,\r\nAnd a pair of leather hinges fastened on the heavy lid,\r\nAnd it hadn\'t any bottom--or, at least, it seemed that way\r\nWhen you hurried in to fill it, so\'s to get outside and play.\r\n\r\nWhen the noons was hot and lazy and the leaves hung dry and still,\r\nAnd the locust in the pear tree started up his planin\'-mill,\r\nAnd the drum-beat of the breakers was a soothin\', temptin\' roll,\r\nAnd you knew the "gang" was waitin\' by the brimmin\' "swimmin\' hole"--\r\nLouder than the locust\'s buzzin,\' louder than the breakers\' roar,\r\nYou could hear the wood-box holler, "Come and fill me up once more!"\r\nAnd the old clock ticked and chuckled as you let each armful drop,\r\nLike it said, "Another minute, and you\'re nowheres near the top!"\r\n\r\nIn the chilly winter mornin\'s when the bed was snug and warm,\r\nAnd the frosted winders tinkled \'neath the fingers of the storm,\r\nAnd your breath rose off the piller in a smoky cloud of steam--\r\nThen that wood-box, grim and empty, came a-dancin\' through your dream,\r\nCame and pounded at your conscience, screamed in aggravatin\' glee,\r\n"Would you like to sleep this mornin\'? You git up and \'tend to me!"\r\nLand! how plain it is this minute--shed and barn and drifted snow,\r\nAnd the slabs of oak a-waitin!, piled and ready, in a row.\r\n\r\nNever was a fishin\' frolic, never was a game of ball,\r\nBut that mean, provokin\' wood-box had to come and spoil it all;\r\nYou might study at your lessons and \'twas full and full to stay,\r\nBut jest start an Injun story, and \'twas empty right away.\r\nSeemed as if a spite was in it, and although I might forgit\r\nAll the other chores that plagued me, I can hate that wood-box yit:\r\nAnd when I look back at boyhood--shakin\' off the cares of men--\r\nStill it comes to spoil the picture, screamin\', "Fill me up again!"\r\n\r\n    _Joseph C. Lincoln._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nInasmuch\r\n\r\n\r\nGood Deacon Roland--"may his tribe increase!"--\r\nAwoke one Sabbath morn feeling at peace\r\nWith God and all mankind. His wants supplied,\r\nHe read his Bible and then knelt beside\r\nThe family altar, and uplifted there\r\nHis voice to God in fervent praise and prayer;\r\nIn praise for blessings past, so rich and free,\r\nAnd prayer for benedictions yet to be.\r\nThen on a stile, which spanned the dooryard fence,\r\nHe sat him down complacently, and thence\r\nSurveyed with pride, o\'er the far-reaching plain,\r\nHis flocks and herds and fields of golden grain;\r\nHis meadows waving like the billowy seas,\r\nAnd orchards filled with over-laden trees,\r\nQuoth he: "How vast the products of my lands;\r\nAbundance crowns the labor of my hands,\r\nGreat is my substance; God indeed is good,\r\nWho doth in love provide my daily food."\r\n\r\nWhile thus he sat in calm soliloquy,\r\nA voice aroused him from his reverie,--\r\nA childish voice from one whose shoeless feet\r\nBrought him unnoticed to the deacon\'s seat;\r\n"Please mister, I have eaten naught to-day;\r\nIf I had money I would gladly pay\r\nFor bread; but I am poor, and cannot buy\r\nMy breakfast; mister, would you mind if I\r\nShould ask for something, just for what you call\r\nCold pieces from your table, that is all?"\r\nThe deacon listened to the child\'s request,\r\nThe while his penetrating eye did rest\r\nOn him whose tatters, trembling, quick revealed\r\nThe agitation of the heart concealed\r\nWithin the breast of one unskilled in ruse,\r\nWho asked not alms like one demanding dues.\r\nThen said the deacon: "I am not inclined\r\nTo give encouragement to those who find\r\nIt easier to beg for bread betimes,\r\nThan to expend their strength in earning dimes\r\nWherewith to purchase it. A parent ought\r\nTo furnish food for those whom he has brought\r\nInto this world, where each one has his share\r\nOf tribulation, sorrow, toil and care.\r\nI sympathize with you, my little lad,\r\nYour destitution makes me feel so sad;\r\nBut, for the sake of those who should supply\r\nYour wants, I must your earnest plea deny;\r\nAnd inasmuch as giving food to you\r\nWould be providing for your parents, too,\r\nThus fostering vagrancy and idleness,\r\nI cannot think such charity would bless\r\nWho gives or takes; and therefore I repeat,\r\nI cannot give you anything to eat."\r\nBefore this "vasty deep" of logic stood\r\nThe child nor found it satisfying food.\r\nNor did he tell the tale he might have told\r\nOf parents slumbering in the grave\'s damp mould,\r\nBut quickly shrank away to find relief\r\nIn giving vent to his rekindled grief,\r\nWhile Deacon Roland soon forgot the appeal\r\nIn meditating on his better weal.\r\n\r\nEre long the Sabbath bells their peals rang out\r\nTo summon worshippers, with hearts devout,\r\nTo wait on God and listen to His word;\r\nAnd then the deacon\'s pious heart was stirred;\r\nAnd in the house of God he soon was found\r\nEngaged in acts of worship most profound.\r\nWearied, however, with his week-day care,\r\nHe fell asleep before the parson\'s prayer\r\nWas ended; then he dreamed he died and came\r\nTo heaven\'s grand portal, and announced his name:\r\n"I\'m Deacon Roland, called from earth afar,\r\nTo join the saints; please set the gates ajar,\r\nThat I may \'join the everlasting song,\'\r\nAnd mingle ever with the ransomed throng."\r\nThen lo! "a horror of great darkness" came\r\nUpon him, as he heard a voice exclaim:\r\n"Depart from me! you cannot enter here!\r\nI never knew you, for indeed, howe\'er\r\nYou may have wrought on earth, the sad, sad fact\r\nRemains, that life\'s sublimest, worthiest act--"\r\nThe deacon woke to find it all a dream\r\nJust as the minister announced his theme:\r\n"My text," said he, "doth comfort only such\r\nAs practice charity; for \'inasmuch\r\nAs ye have done it to the least of these\r\nMy little ones\' saith He who holds the keys\r\nOf heaven, \'ye have done it unto me,\'\r\nAnd I will give you immortality."\r\n\r\nStraightway the deacon left his cushioned pew,\r\nAnd from the church in sudden haste withdrew,\r\nAnd up the highway ran, on love\'s swift feet\r\nTo overtake the child of woe, and greet\r\nHim as the worthy representative\r\nOf Christ the Lord and to him freely give\r\nAll needful good, that thus he might atone\r\nFor the neglect which he before had shown.\r\nThus journeying, God directed all his way,\r\nO\'er hill and dale, to where the outcast lay\r\nBeside the road bemoaning his sad fate.\r\nAnd then the deacon said, "My child, \'tis late;\r\nMake haste and journey with me to my home;\r\nTo guide you thither, I myself have come;\r\nAnd you shall have the food you asked in vain,\r\nFor God himself hath made my duty plain;\r\nIf he demand it, all I have is thine;\r\nShrink not, but trust me; place thy hand in mine."\r\nAnd as they journeyed toward the deacon\'s home,\r\nThe child related how he came to roam,\r\nUntil the listening deacon understood\r\nThe touching story of his orphanhood.\r\nThen, finding in the little waif a gem\r\nWorthy to deck the Saviour\'s diadem,\r\nHe drew him to his loving breast, and said,\r\n"My child, you shall by me be clothed and fed;\r\nNor shall you go from hence again to roam\r\nWhile God in love provides for us a home."\r\nAnd as the weeks and months roll on apace,\r\nThe deacon held the lad in love\'s embrace;\r\nAnd being childless did on him confer\r\nThe boon of sonship.\r\n\r\n                     Thus the almoner\r\nOf God\'s great bounty to the destitute\r\nThe deacon came to be; and as the fruit\r\nOf having learned to keep the golden rule\r\nHis charity became all-bountiful;\r\nAnd from thenceforth he lived to benefit\r\nMankind; and when in life\'s great book were writ\r\nTheir names who heeded charity\'s request,\r\nLo! Deacon Roland\'s "name led all the rest."\r\n\r\n    _S.V.R. Ford._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNo Sects in Heaven\r\n\r\n\r\nTalking of sects quite late one eve,\r\nWhat one and another of saints believe,\r\nThat night I stood in a troubled dream\r\nBy the side of a darkly-flowing stream.\r\n\r\nAnd a "churchman" down to the river came,\r\nWhen I heard a strange voice call his name,\r\n"Good father, stop; when you cross this tide\r\nYou must leave your robes on the other side."\r\n\r\nBut the aged father did not mind,\r\nAnd his long gown floated out behind\r\nAs down to the stream his way he took,\r\nHis hands firm hold of a gilt-edged book.\r\n\r\n"I\'m bound for heaven, and when I\'m there\r\nI shall want my book of Common Prayer,\r\nAnd though I put on a starry crown,\r\nI should feel quite lost without my gown."\r\n\r\nThen he fixed his eye on the shining track,\r\nBut his gown was heavy and held him back,\r\nAnd the poor old father tried in vain,\r\nA single step in the flood to gain.\r\n\r\nI saw him again on the other side,\r\nBut his silk gown floated on the tide,\r\nAnd no one asked, in that blissful spot,\r\nIf he belonged to "the church" or not.\r\n\r\nThen down to the river a Quaker strayed;\r\nHis dress of a sober hue was made,\r\n"My hat and coat must be all of gray,\r\nI cannot go any other way."\r\n\r\nThen he buttoned his coat straight up to his chin\r\nAnd staidly, solemnly, waded in,\r\nAnd his broad-brimmed hat he pulled down tight\r\nOver his forehead, so cold and white.\r\n\r\nBut a strong wind carried away his hat,\r\nAnd he sighed a few moments over that,\r\nAnd then, as he gazed to the farther shore\r\nThe coat slipped off and was seen no more.\r\n\r\nPoor, dying Quaker, thy suit of gray\r\nIs quietly sailing--away--away,\r\nBut thou\'lt go to heaven, as straight as an arrow,\r\nWhether thy brim be broad or narrow.\r\n\r\nNext came Dr. Watts with a bundle of psalms\r\nTied nicely up in his aged arms,\r\nAnd hymns as many, a very wise thing,\r\nThat the people in heaven, "all round," might sing.\r\n\r\nBut I thought that he heaved an anxious sigh,\r\nAs he saw that the river ran broad and high,\r\nAnd looked rather surprised, as one by one,\r\nThe psalms and hymns in the wave went down.\r\n\r\nAnd after him, with his MSS.,\r\nCame Wesley, the pattern of godliness,\r\nBut he cried, "Dear me, what shall I do?\r\nThe water has soaked them through and through."\r\n\r\nAnd there, on the river, far and wide,\r\nAway they went on the swollen tide,\r\nAnd the saint, astonished, passed through alone,\r\nWithout his manuscripts, up to the throne.\r\n\r\nThen gravely walking, two saints by name,\r\nDown to the stream together came,\r\nBut as they stopped at the river\'s brink,\r\nI saw one saint from the other shrink.\r\n\r\n"Sprinkled or plunged--may I ask you, friend,\r\nHow you attained to life\'s great end?"\r\n"_Thus_, with a few drops on my brow";\r\n"But I have been _dipped_, as you\'ll see me now.\r\n\r\n"And I really think it will hardly do,\r\nAs I\'m \'close communion,\' to cross with you.\r\nYou\'re bound, I know, to the realms of bliss,\r\nBut you must go that way, and I\'ll go this."\r\n\r\nAnd straightway plunging with all his might,\r\nAway to the left--his friend at the right,\r\nApart they went from this world of sin,\r\nBut how did the brethren "enter in"?\r\n\r\nAnd now where the river was rolling on,\r\nA Presbyterian church went down;\r\nOf women, there seemed an innumerable throng,\r\nBut the men I could count as they passed along.\r\n\r\nAnd concerning the road they could never agree,\r\nThe _old_ or the _new_ way, which it could be;\r\nNor ever a moment paused to think\r\nThat both would lead to the river\'s brink.\r\n\r\nAnd a sound of murmuring long and loud\r\nCame ever up from the moving crowd,\r\n"You\'re in the old way, and I\'m in the new,\r\nThat is the false, and this is the true":\r\nOr, "I\'m in the old way, and you\'re in the new,\r\n_That_ is the false, and _this_ is the true."\r\n\r\nBut the brethren only seemed to speak,\r\nModest the sisters walked, and meek,\r\nAnd if ever one of them chanced to say\r\nWhat troubles she met with on the way,\r\nHow she longed to pass to the other side,\r\nNor feared to cross over the swelling tide,\r\nA voice arose from the brethren then,\r\n"Let no one speak but the \'holy men,\'\r\nFor have ye not heard the words of Paul?\r\n\'Oh, let the women keep silence all.\'"\r\n\r\nI watched them long in my curious dream.\r\nTill they stood by the border of the stream,\r\nThen, just as I thought, the two ways met.\r\nBut all the brethren were talking yet,\r\nAnd would talk on, till the heaving tide\r\nCarried them over, side by side;\r\nSide by side, for the way was one,\r\nThe toilsome journey of life was done,\r\nAnd priest and Quaker, and all who died,\r\nCame out alike on the other side;\r\nNo forms or crosses, or books had they,\r\nNo gowns of silk, or suits of gray,\r\nNo creeds to guide them, or MSS.,\r\nFor all had put on "Christ\'s righteousness."\r\n\r\n    _Elizabeth H. Jocelyn Cleaveland._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Railroad Crossing\r\n\r\n\r\nI can\'t tell much about the thing, \'twas done so powerful quick;\r\nBut \'pears to me I got a most outlandish heavy lick:\r\nIt broke my leg, and tore my skulp, and jerked my arm \'most out.\r\nBut take a seat: I\'ll try and tell jest how it kem about.\r\n\r\nYou see, I\'d started down to town, with that \'ere team of mine,\r\nA-haulin\' down a load o\' corn to Ebenezer Kline,\r\nAnd drivin\' slow; for, jest about a day or two before,\r\nThe off-horse run a splinter in his foot, and made it sore.\r\n\r\nYou know the railroad cuts across the road at Martin\'s Hole:\r\nWell, thar I seed a great big sign, raised high upon a pole;\r\nI thought I\'d stop and read the thing, and find out what it said,\r\nAnd so I stopped the hosses on the railroad-track, and read.\r\n\r\nI ain\'t no scholar, rekollect, and so I had to spell,\r\nI started kinder cautious like, with R-A-I and L;\r\nAnd that spelt "rail" as clear as mud; R-O-A-D was "road."\r\nI lumped \'em: "railroad" was the word, and that \'ere much I knowed.\r\n\r\nC-R-O and double S, with I-N-G to boot,\r\nMade "crossing" jest as plain as Noah Webster dared to do\'t.\r\n"Railroad crossing"--good enough!--L double-O-K, "look";\r\nAnd I wos lookin\' all the time, and spellin\' like a book.\r\n\r\nO-U-T spelt "out" just right; and there it was, "look out,"\r\nI\'s kinder cur\'us like, to know jest what\'t was all about;\r\nF-O-R and T-H-E; \'twas then "look out for the--"\r\nAnd then I tried the next word; it commenced with E-N-G.\r\n\r\nI\'d got that fur, when suddintly there came an awful whack;\r\nA thousand fiery thunderbolts just scooped me off the track;\r\nThe hosses went to Davy Jones, the wagon went to smash,\r\nAnd I was histed seven yards above the tallest ash.\r\n\r\nI didn\'t come to life ag\'in fur \'bout a day or two;\r\nBut, though I\'m crippled up a heap, I sorter struggled through;\r\nIt ain\'t the pain, nor \'taint the loss o\' that \'ere team of mine;\r\nBut, stranger, how I\'d like to know the rest of that \'ere sign!\r\n\r\n    _Hezekiah Strong._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sunset City\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTurn back the leaves of history. On yon Pacific shore\r\nA world-known city\'s fall and rise shall thrill your hearts once more.\r\n\'Twas April; nineteen-six the year; old San Francisco lay\r\nEffulgent in the splendor of the dying orb of day\r\nThat bathed in flood of crimson light Mount Tamalpais\' lonely height\r\nAnd kissed the sister towns "goodnight" across the misty bay.\r\n\r\nIt burst in glory on the hills, lit up the princely homes,\r\nAnd gleamed from lofty towers and spires and flashed from gilded domes;\r\nIt glorified the massive blocks caught in its widening flow,\r\nEngulfed the maze of streets and parks that stretched away below,\r\nTill marble white and foliage green and vales of gray, and silvery sheen\r\nOf ocean\'s surface vast, serene, were tinted by its glow.\r\n\r\nThe tranquil murmurs of the deep were borne on balmy air\r\nAll odorous with lily breath and roses sweet and rare.\r\nThe zephyrs sang a lullaby as the slow, fiery ball\r\nEnded its trail of gorgeousness behind horizon\'s wall.\r\nThen gray absorbed each rainbow hue and dark the beauteous landscape grew\r\nAs shadowy Evening softly drew her curtain over all.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThat night around the festal board, \'mid incandescence gay,\r\nSat Pomp and Pride and Wealth and Power, in sumptuous array,\r\nThat night the happy, careless throng were all on pleasure bent,\r\nAnd Beauty in her jewelled robes to ball and opera went.\r\n\'Mid feasting, laughter, song and jest; by music\'s soothing tones caressed;\r\nThe Sunset City sank to rest in peace, secure, content.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nUnconscious of approaching doom, old San Francisco sleeps\r\nWhile from the east, all smilingly, the April morning creeps.\r\nSee! Playful sunbeams tinge with gold the mountains in the sky,\r\nAnd hazy clouds of gray unfold--but, hark! What means that cry?\r\nThe ground vibrates with sadden shock. The buildings tremble, groan\r\n      and rock.\r\nWild fears the waking senses mock, and some wake but to die.\r\n\r\nA frightful subterranean force the earth\'s foundation shakes;\r\nThe city quivers in the throes of fierce, successive quakes,\r\nAnd massive structures thrill like giant oaks before the blast;\r\nInto the streets with deafening crash the frailer ones are cast.\r\nHalf garbed, the multitude rush out in frantic haste, with prayer and\r\n      shout,\r\nTo join the panic stricken rout. Ho! DEATH is marching past.\r\n\r\nA rumbling noise! The streets upheave, and sink again, like waves;\r\nAnd shattered piles and shapeless wrecks are strewn with human graves.\r\nDanger at every corner lurks. Destruction fills the air.\r\nDeath-laden showers of mortar, bricks, are falling everywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\n"_Fire! Fire!_" And lo! the dread fiend starts. Mothers with babes clasped\r\n      to their hearts\r\nAre struggling for the open parts in frenzy of despair.\r\n\r\nA hundred tiny tongues of flame forth from the ruins burst.\r\nNo water! God! what shall we do to slake their quenchless thirst?\r\nThe shocks have broken all the mains! "_Use wine!_" the people cry.\r\nThe red flames laugh like drunken fiends; they stagger as to die,\r\nThen up again in fury spring, on high their crimson draperies fling;\r\nFrom block to block they leap and swing, and smoke clouds hide the sky.\r\n\r\nHa! from the famed Presidio that guards the Golden Gate\r\nCome Funston and his regulars to match their strength with Fate.\r\nThe soldiers and the citizens are fighting side by side\r\nTo check that onslaught of red wrath, to stem destruction\'s tide.\r\nWith roar, and boom, and blare, and blast, an open space is cleared at\r\n      last.\r\nThe fiends of fury gallop past with flanks outstretched and wide;\r\n\r\nAround the city\'s storehouses they wreathe and twine and dance,\r\nAnd wealth and splendor shrivel up before their swift advance.\r\nBefore their devastating breath the stricken people flee.\r\n"Mine, mine your treasures are!" cried Death, and laughs in fiendish glee.\r\nInto that vortex of red hell sink church and theatre, store, hotel.\r\nWith thunderous roar and hissing yell on sweeps the crimson sea.\r\n\r\nAgain with charge of dynamite the lurid clouds are riven;\r\nAgain with heat and sulphur smoke the troops are backward driven.\r\nAll day, all night, all day again, with that infernal host\r\nThey strive in vain for mastery. Each vantage gained is lost,--\r\nOn comes the bellowing flood of flame in furious wrath its own to claim;\r\nResistless in its awful aim each space is bridged and crossed.\r\n\r\nAh God! the miles and miles of waste! One half the city gone!\r\nAnd westward now--toward Van Ness--the roaring flames roll on.\r\n"Blow up that mile of palaces!" It is the last command,\r\nAnd there, at broad Van Ness, the troops make their heroic stand.\r\nThe fight is now for life--sweet life, for helpless babe and homeless\r\n      wife--\r\nThe culmination of the strife spectacularly grand.\r\n\r\nOn sweeps the hurricane of fire. The fatal touch is given.\r\nThe detonation of the blast goes shrieking up to heaven.\r\nThe mansions of bonanza kings are tottering to their doom;\r\nThat swirling tide of fiery fate halts at the gaping tomb.\r\nBeyond the cataclysm\'s brink, the multitude, too dazed to think,\r\nBehold the red waves rise and--sink into the smoldering gloom.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nThe fire has swept the waterfront and burned the Mission down,\r\nThe business section--swallowed up, and wiped out Chinatown--\r\nFull thirty thousand homes destroyed, Nob Hill in ashes lies,\r\nAnd ghastly skeletons of steel on Market Street arise.\r\nA gruesome picture everywhere! \'Tis desolation grim and bare\r\nWaits artisan and millionaire beneath rank sulphurous skies.\r\n\r\nTo-night, within the city parks, famished, benumbed and mute,\r\nTwo hundred thousand refugees, homeless and destitute!\r\nUpon the hard, cold ground they crouch--the wrecks of Pomp and Pride;\r\nMilady and the city waifs are huddled side by side.\r\nAnd there, \'neath shelter rude and frail, we hear the new-born infants\r\n      wail,\r\nWhile\' nations read the tragic tale--how San Francisco died.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nPROPHECY--1906\r\n\r\nNot dead! Though maimed, her Soul yet lives--indomitable will--\r\nThe Faith, the Hope, the Spirit bold nor quake nor fire can kill.\r\nTo-morrow hearts shall throb again with western enterprise,\r\nAnd from the ruins of to-day a city shall arise--\r\nA monument of beauty great reared by the Conquerors of Fate--\r\nThe City of the Golden Gate and matchless sunset skies!\r\n\r\n\r\nVII\r\n\r\nFULFILLMENT--1915\r\n\r\nReborn, rebuilt, she rose again, far vaster in expanse--\r\nA radiant city smiling from the ashes of romance!\r\nA San Francisco glorified, more beauteous than of yore,\r\nEnthroned upon her splendid hills, queen of the sunset shore;\r\nHer flags of industry unfurled, her portals open to the world!\r\nThus, in the Book of Destiny, she lives for evermore.\r\n\r\n    _Isabel Ambler Gilman._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAutumn\r\n\r\nA DIRGE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe autumn is old;\r\nThe sere leaves are flying;\r\nHe hath gathered up gold,\r\nAnd now he is dying:\r\nOld age, begin sighing!\r\n\r\nThe vintage is ripe;\r\nThe harvest is heaping;\r\nBut some that have sowed\r\nHave no riches for reaping:--\r\nPoor wretch, fall a-weeping!\r\n\r\nThe year\'s in the wane;\r\nThere is nothing adorning;\r\nThe night has no eve,\r\nAnd the day has no morning;\r\nCold winter gives warning.\r\n\r\nThe rivers run chill;\r\nThe red sun is sinking;\r\nAnd I am grown old,\r\nAnd life is fast shrinking;\r\nHere\'s enow for sad thinking!\r\n\r\n    _Thomas Hood_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrandmother\'s Quilt\r\n\r\n\r\nWhy, yes, dear, we can put it by. It does seem out of place\r\nOn top of these down comforts and this spread of silk and lace,\r\nYou see, I\'m used to having it lie so, across my feet,\r\nBut maybe I won\'t need it here, with this nice furnace heat;\r\nI made it? Yes, dear, long ago. \'Twas lots of work, you think?\r\nOh, not so much. My rose quilt, now, all white and green and pink,\r\nIs really handsome. This is just a plain, log cabin block,\r\nPieced out of odds and ends; but still--now that\'s your papa\'s frock\r\nBefore he walked, and this bit here is his first little suit.\r\nI trimmed it up with silver braid. My, but he did look cute!\r\nThat red there in the centers, was your Aunt Ruth\'s for her name,\r\nHer grandmother almost clothed the child, before the others came.\r\nThose plaids? The younger girls\', they were. I dressed them just alike.\r\nAnd this was baby Winnie\'s sack--the precious little tyke!\r\nMa wore this gown to visit me (they drove the whole way then).\r\nAnd little Edson wore this waist. He never came again.\r\nThis lavender par\'matta was your Great-aunt Jane\'s--poor dear!\r\nMine was a sprig, with the lilac ground; see, in the corner here.\r\nSuch goods were high in war times. Ah, that scrap of army blue;\r\nYour bright eyes spied it! Yes, dear child, that has its memories, too.\r\nThey sent him home on furlough once--our soldier brother Ned;\r\nBut somewhere, now, the dear boy sleeps among the unknown dead.\r\nThat flowered patch? Well, now, to think you\'d pick that from the rest!\r\nWhy, dearie--yes, it\'s satin ribbed--that\'s grandpa\'s wedding vest!\r\nJust odds and ends! no great for looks. My rose quilt\'s nicer, far,\r\nOr the one in basket pattern, or the double-pointed star.\r\nBut, somehow--What! We\'ll leave it here? The bed won\'t look so neat,\r\nBut I think I would sleep better with it so, across my feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Two Angels\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo angels, one of Life and one of Death,\r\n  Passed o\'er our village as the morning broke;\r\nThe dawn was on their faces, and beneath,\r\n  The sombre houses hearsed with plumes of smoke.\r\n\r\nTheir attitude and aspect were the same,\r\n  Alike their features and their robes of white;\r\nBut one was crowned with amaranth, as with flame,\r\n  And one with asphodels, like flakes of light.\r\n\r\nI saw them pause on their celestial way;\r\n  Then said I, with deep fear and doubt oppressed,\r\n"Beat not so loud, my heart, lest thou betray\r\n  The place where thy beloved are at rest!"\r\n\r\nAnd he who wore the crown of asphodels,\r\n  Descending, at my door began to knock,\r\nAnd my soul sank within me, as in wells\r\n  The waters sink before an earthquake\'s shock.\r\n\r\nI recognized the nameless agony,\r\n  The terror and the tremor and the pain,\r\nThat oft before had filled or haunted me,\r\n  And now returned with threefold strength again.\r\n\r\nThe door I opened to my heavenly guest,\r\n  And listened, for I thought I heard God\'s voice;\r\nAnd, knowing whatsoe\'er he sent was best,\r\n  Dared neither to lament nor to rejoice.\r\n\r\nThen with a smile, that filled the house with light,\r\n  "My errand is not Death, but Life," he said;\r\nAnd ere I answered, passing out of sight,\r\n  On his celestial embassy he sped.\r\n\r\n\'Twas at thy door, O friend! and not at mine,\r\n  The angel with the amaranthine wreath,\r\nPausing, descended, and with, voice divine,\r\n  Whispered a word that had a sound like Death.\r\n\r\nThen fell upon the house a sudden gloom,\r\n  A shadow on those features fair and thin;\r\nAnd softly, from that hushed and darkened room,\r\n  Two angels issued, where but one went in.\r\n\r\nAll is of God! If he but waves his hand,\r\n  The mists collect, the rain falls thick and loud,\r\nTill, with a smile of light on sea and land,\r\n  Lo! he looks back from the departing cloud.\r\n\r\nAngels of Life and Death alike are his;\r\n  Without his leave they pass no threshold o\'er;\r\nWho, then, would wish or dare, believing this,\r\n  Against his messengers to shut the door?\r\n\r\n    _Henry W. Longfellow._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Witch\'s Daughter\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the pleasant harvest-time,\r\n  When cellar-bins are closely stowed,\r\n  And garrets bend beneath their load,\r\nAnd the old swallow-haunted barns--\r\n  Brown-gabled, long, and full of seams\r\n  Through which the moted sunlight streams--\r\n\r\nAnd winds blow freshly in, to shake\r\n  The red plumes of the roosted cocks,\r\n  And the loose hay-mow\'s scented locks--\r\nAre filled with summer\'s ripened stores,\r\n  Its odorous grass and barley sheaves,\r\n  From their low scaffolds to their eaves.\r\n\r\nOn Esek Harden\'s oaken floor,\r\n  With many an autumn threshing worn,\r\n  Lay the heaped ears of unhusked corn.\r\nAnd thither came young men and maids,\r\n  Beneath a moon that, large and low,\r\n  Lit that sweet eve of long ago,\r\nThey took their places; some by chance,\r\n  And others by a merry voice\r\n  Or sweet smile guided to their choice.\r\n\r\nHow pleasantly the rising moon,\r\n  Between the shadow of the mows,\r\n  Looked on them through the great elm-boughs!--\r\nOn sturdy boyhood, sun-embrowned,\r\n  On girlhood with its solid curves\r\n  Of healthful strength and painless nerves!\r\nAnd jests went round, and laughs that made\r\n  The house-dog answer with his howl,\r\n  And kept astir the barn-yard fowl.\r\n\r\nAnd quaint old songs their fathers sung,\r\n  In Derby dales and Yorkshire moors,\r\n  Ere Norman William trod their shores;\r\nAnd tales, whose merry license shook\r\n  The fat sides of the Saxon thane,\r\n  Forgetful of the hovering Dane!\r\n\r\nBut still the sweetest voice was mute\r\n  That river-valley ever heard\r\n  From lip of maid or throat of bird;\r\nFor Mabel Martin sat apart,\r\n  And let the hay-mow\'s shadow \'fall\r\n  Upon the loveliest face of all.\r\nShe sat apart, as one forbid,\r\n  Who knew that none would condescend\r\n  To own the Witch-wife\'s child a friend.\r\n\r\nThe seasons scarce had gone their round,\r\n  Since curious thousands thronged to see\r\n  Her mother on the gallows-tree;\r\nAnd mocked the palsied limbs of age,\r\n  That faltered on the fatal stairs,\r\n  And wan lip trembling with its prayers!\r\n\r\nFew questioned of the sorrowing child,\r\n  Or, when they saw the mother die,\r\n  Dreamed of the daughter\'s agony.\r\nThey went up to their homes that day,\r\n  As men and Christians justified:\r\n  God willed it, and the wretch had died!\r\n\r\nDear God and Father of us all,\r\n  Forgive our faith in cruel lies,--\r\n  Forgive the blindness that denies!\r\nForgive Thy creature when he takes,\r\n  For the all-perfect love Thou art,\r\n  Some grim creation of his heart.\r\nCast down our idols, overturn\r\n  Our bloody altars; let us see\r\n  Thyself in Thy humanity!\r\n\r\nPoor Mabel from her mother\'s grave\r\n  Crept to her desolate hearth-stone,\r\n  And wrestled with her fate alone;\r\nWith love, and anger, and despair,\r\n  The phantoms of disordered sense,\r\n  The awful doubts of Providence!\r\nThe school-boys jeered her as they passed,\r\n  And, when she sought the house of prayer,\r\n  Her mother\'s curse pursued her there.\r\nAnd still o\'er many a neighboring door\r\n  She saw the horseshoe\'s curved charm,\r\n  To guard against her mother\'s harm;--\r\n\r\nThat mother, poor, and sick, and lame,\r\n  Who daily, by the old arm-chair,\r\n  Folded her withered hands in prayer;--\r\nWho turned, in Salem\'s dreary jail,\r\n  Her worn old Bible o\'er and o\'er,\r\n  When her dim eyes could read no more!\r\n\r\nSore tried and pained, the poor girl kept\r\n  Her faith, and trusted that her way,\r\n  So dark, would somewhere meet the day.\r\nAnd still her weary wheel went round,\r\n  Day after day, with no relief:\r\n  Small leisure have the poor for grief.\r\n\r\nSo in the shadow Mabel sits;\r\n  Untouched by mirth she sees and hears,\r\n  Her smile is sadder than her tears.\r\nBut cruel eyes have found her out,\r\n  And cruel lips repeat her name,\r\n  And taunt her with her mother\'s shame.\r\n\r\nShe answered not with railing words,\r\n  But drew her apron o\'er her face,\r\n  And, sobbing, glided from the place.\r\nAnd only pausing at the door,\r\n  Her sad eyes met the troubled gaze\r\n  Of one who, in her better days,\r\nHad been her warm and steady friend,\r\n  Ere yet her mother\'s doom had made\r\n  Even Esek Harden half afraid.\r\n\r\nHe felt that mute appeal of tears,\r\n  And, starting, with an angry frown\r\n  Hushed all the wicked murmurs down,\r\n"Good neighbors mine," he sternly said,\r\n  "This passes harmless mirth or jest;\r\n  I brook no insult to my guest.\r\n\r\n"She is indeed her mother\'s child;\r\n  But God\'s sweet pity ministers\r\n  Unto no whiter soul than hers.\r\nLet Goody Martin rest in peace;\r\n  I never knew her harm a fly,\r\n  And witch or not, God knows,--not I.\r\nI know who swore her life away;\r\n  And, as God lives, I\'d not condemn\r\n  An Indian dog on word of them."\r\n\r\nPoor Mabel, in her lonely home,\r\n  Sat by the window\'s narrow pane,\r\n  White in the moonlight\'s silver rain.\r\nThe river, on its pebbled rim,\r\n  Made music such as childhood knew;\r\n  The door-yard tree was whispered through\r\nBy voices such as childhood\'s ear\r\n  Had heard in moonlights long ago;\r\n  And through the willow boughs below\r\nShe saw the rippled waters shine;\r\n  Beyond, in waves of shade and light\r\n  The hills rolled off into the night.\r\n\r\nSweet sounds and pictures mocking so\r\n  The sadness of her human lot,\r\n  She saw and heard, but heeded not.\r\nShe strove to drown her sense of wrong,\r\n  And, in her old and simple way,\r\n  To teach, her bitter heart to pray.\r\n\r\nPoor child! the prayer, began in faith,\r\n  Grew to a low, despairing cry\r\n  Of utter misery: "Let me die!\r\nOh! take me from the scornful eyes,\r\n  And hide me where the cruel speech\r\n  And mocking finger may not reach!\r\n\r\n"I dare not breathe my mother\'s name;\r\n  A daughter\'s right I dare not crave\r\n  To weep above her unblest grave!\r\nLet me not live until my heart,\r\n  With few to pity, and with none\r\n  To love me, hardens into stone.\r\nO God! have mercy on thy child,\r\n  Whose faith in Thee grows weak and small,\r\n  And take me ere I lose it all."\r\n\r\nThe broadest lands in all the town,\r\n  The skill to guide, the power to awe,\r\n  Were Harden\'s; and his word was law.\r\nNone dared withstand him to his face,\r\n  But one sly maiden spake aside:\r\n  "The little witch is evil-eyed!\r\nHer mother only killed a cow,\r\n  Or witched a churn or dairy-pan;\r\n  But she, forsooth, must charm a man!"\r\n\r\nA shadow on the moonlight fell,\r\n  And murmuring wind and wave became\r\n  A voice whose burden was her name.\r\nHad then God heard her? Had he sent\r\n  His angel down? In flesh and blood,\r\n  Before her Esek Harden stood!\r\n\r\nHe laid his hand upon her arm:\r\n  "Dear Mabel, this no more shall be;\r\n  Who scoffs at you, must scoff at me.\r\nYou know rough Esek Harden well;\r\n  And if he seems no suitor gay,\r\n  And if his hair is mixed with gray,\r\nThe maiden grown shall never find\r\n  His heart less warm than when she smiled\r\n  Upon his knees, a little child!"\r\n\r\nHer tears of grief were tears of joy,\r\n  As folded in his strong embrace,\r\n  She looked in Esek Harden\'s face.\r\n"O truest friend of all!" she said,\r\n  "God bless you for your kindly thought,\r\n  And make me worthy of my lot!"\r\n\r\nHe led her through his dewy fields,\r\n  To where the swinging lanterns glowed,\r\n  And through the doors the huskers showed.\r\n"Good friends and neighbors!" Esek said,\r\n  "I\'m weary of this lonely life;\r\n  In Mabel see my chosen wife!\r\n\r\n"She greets you kindly, one and all:\r\n  The past is past, and all offence\r\n  Falls harmless from her innocence.\r\nHenceforth she stands no more alone;\r\n  You know what Esek Harden is;--\r\n  He brooks no wrong to him or his."\r\n\r\nNow let the merriest tales be told,\r\n  And let the sweetest songs be sung,\r\n  That ever made the old heart young!\r\nFor now the lost has found a home;\r\n  And a lone hearth shall brighter burn,\r\n  As all the household joys return!\r\n\r\nOh, pleasantly the harvest moon,\r\n  Between the shadow of the mows,\r\n  Looked on them through the great elm-boughs!\r\nOn Mabel\'s curls of golden hair,\r\n  On Esek\'s shaggy strength it fell;\r\n  And the wind whispered, "It is well!"\r\n\r\n    _John G. Whittier._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDavid\'s Lament for Absalom\r\n\r\n\r\nKing David\'s limbs were weary. He had fled\r\nFrom far Jerusalem; and now he stood\r\nWith his faint people for a little rest\r\nUpon the shore of Jordan. The light wind\r\nOf morn was stirring, and he bared his brow\r\nTo its refreshing breath; for he had worn\r\nThe mourner\'s covering, and he had not felt\r\nThat he could see his people until now.\r\n\r\nThey gathered round him on the fresh green bank\r\nAnd spoke their kindly words, and as the sun\r\nRose up in heaven he knelt among them there,\r\nAnd bowed his head upon his hands to pray.\r\nOh! when the heart is full--where bitter thoughts\r\nCome crowding thickly up for utterance,\r\nAnd the poor common words of courtesy,--\r\nAre such a mockery--how much\r\nThe bursting heart may pour itself in prayer!\r\nHe prayed for Israel--and his voice went up\r\nStrongly and fervently. He prayed for those\r\nWhose love had been his shield--and his deep tones\r\nGrew tremulous. But, oh! for Absalom,\r\nFor his estranged, misguided Absalom--\r\nThe proud, bright being who had burst away\r\nIn all his princely beauty to defy\r\nThe heart that cherished him--for him he prayed,\r\nIn agony that would not be controll\'d,\r\nStrong supplication, and forgave him there\r\nBefore his God for his deep sinfulness.\r\n\r\nThe pall was settled. He who slept beneath\r\nWas straightened for the grave, and as the folds\r\nSank to their still proportions, they betrayed\r\nThe matchless symmetry of Absalom,\r\nThe mighty Joab stood beside the bier\r\nAnd gazed upon the dark pall steadfastly,\r\nAs if he feared the slumberer might stir.\r\nA slow step startled him. He grasped his blade\r\nAs if a trumpet rang, but the bent form\r\nOf David entered; and he gave command\r\nIn a low tone to his few followers,\r\nAnd left him with the dead.\r\n\r\n    The King stood still\r\nTill the last echo died; then, throwing off\r\nThe sackcloth from his brow, and laying back\r\nThe pall from the still features of his child.\r\nHe bowed his head upon him and broke forth\r\nIn the resistless eloquence of woe:\r\n\r\n"Alas! my noble boy; that thou shouldst die!\r\n  Thou who were made so beautifully fair!\r\nThat death should settle in thy glorious eye,\r\n  And leave his stillness in this clustering hair!\r\nHow could he mark thee for the silent tomb,\r\n    My proud boy, Absalom!\r\n\r\n"Cold is thy brow, my son! and I am chill\r\n  As to my bosom I have tried to press thee!\r\nHow was I wont to feel my pulses thrill\r\n  Like a rich harp-string yearning to caress thee,\r\nAnd hear thy sweet \'my father!\' from those dumb\r\n    And cold lips, Absalom!\r\n\r\n"But death is on thee! I shall hear the gush\r\n  Of music, and the voices of the young;\r\nAnd life will pass me in the mantling blush,\r\n  And the dark tresses to the soft winds flung;--\r\nBut thou no more, with thy sweet voice, shalt come\r\n    To meet me, Absalom!\r\n\r\n"And oh! when I am stricken, and my heart,\r\n  Like a bruised reed, is waiting to be broken,\r\nHow will its love for thee, as I depart,\r\n  Yearn for thine ear to drink its last deep token!\r\nIt were so sweet, amid death\'s gathering gloom,\r\n    To see thee, Absalom!\r\n\r\n"And now, farewell! \'Tis hard to give thee up,\r\n  With death so like a gentle slumber on thee!--\r\nAnd thy dark sin! Oh! I could drink the cup,\r\n  If from this woe its bitterness had won thee.\r\nMay God have called thee, like a wanderer, home,\r\n    My lost boy, Absalom!"\r\n\r\nHe covered up his face, and bowed himself\r\nA moment on his child; then, giving him\r\nA look of melting tenderness, he clasped\r\nHis hands convulsively, as if in prayer,\r\nAnd, as if strength were given him of God,\r\nHe rose up calmly, and composed the pall\r\nFirmly and decently--and left him there,\r\nAs if his rest had been a breathing sleep.\r\n\r\n    _N.P. Willis_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChristmas Day in the Workhouse\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is Christmas day in the workhouse,\r\n  And the cold bare walls are bright\r\nWith garlands of green and holly,\r\n  And the place is a pleasant sight:\r\nFor with clean-washed hands and faces,\r\n  In a long and hungry line\r\nThe paupers sit at the tables,\r\n  For this is the hour they dine.\r\n\r\nAnd the guardians and their ladies,\r\n  Although the wind is east,\r\nHave come in their furs and wrappers\r\n  To watch their charges feast;\r\nTo smile and be condescending,\r\n  Put pudding on pauper plates,\r\nTo be hosts at the workhouse banquet\r\n  They\'ve paid for--with the rates.\r\n\r\nOh, the paupers are meek and lowly\r\n  With their "Thank\'ee kindly, mum\'s";\r\nSo long as they fill their stomachs,\r\n  What matter whence it comes?\r\nBut one of the old men mutters,\r\n  And pushes his plate aside:\r\n"Great God!" he cries; "but it chokes me;\r\n  For this is the day _she_ died."\r\n\r\nThe guardians gazed in horror,\r\n  The master\'s face went white:\r\n"Did a pauper refuse their pudding?"\r\n  "Could their ears believe aright?"\r\nThen the ladies clutched their husbands\r\n  Thinking the man would die,\r\nStruck by a bolt, or something,\r\n  By the outraged One on high.\r\n\r\nBut the pauper sat for a moment,\r\n  Then rose \'mid a silence grim,\r\nFor the others had ceased to chatter,\r\n  And trembled in every limb.\r\nHe looked at the guardians\' ladies,\r\n  Then, eyeing their lords, he said:\r\n"I eat not the food of villains\r\n  Whose hands are foul and red,\r\n\r\n"Whose victims cry for vengeance\r\n  From their dark unhallowed graves."\r\n"He\'s drunk!" said the workhouse master,\r\n  "Or else he\'s mad, and raves."\r\n"Not drunk or mad," cried the pauper,\r\n  "But only a hunted beast,\r\nWho, torn by the hounds and mangled,\r\n  Declines the vulture\'s feast.\r\n\r\n"I care not a curse for the guardians,\r\n  And I won\'t be dragged away.\r\nJust let me have the fit out,\r\n  It\'s only on Christmas day\r\nThat the black past comes to goad me,\r\n  And prey on my burning brain,\r\nI\'ll tell you the rest in a whisper,--\r\n  I swear I won\'t shout again,\r\n\r\n"Keep your hands off me, curse you!\r\n  Hear me right out to the end,\r\nYou come here to see how paupers\r\n  The season of Christmas spend.\r\nYou come here to watch us feeding,\r\n  As they watch the captured beast,\r\nHear why a penniless pauper\r\n  Spits on your palfry feast.\r\n\r\n"Do you think I will take your bounty,\r\n  And let you smile and think\r\nYou\'re doing a noble action\r\n  With the parish\'s meat and drink?\r\nWhere is my wife, you traitors--\r\n  The poor old wife you slew?\r\nYes, by the God above us,\r\n  My Nance was killed by you!\r\n\r\n"Last winter my wife lay dying,\r\n  Starved in a filthy den;\r\nI had never been to the parish,--\r\n  I came to the parish then.\r\nI swallowed my pride in coming,\r\n  For, ere the ruin came.\r\nI held up my head as a trader,\r\n  And I bore a spotless name.\r\n\r\n"I came to the parish, craving\r\n  Bread for a starving wife,\r\nBread for the woman who\'d loved me\r\n  Through fifty years of life;\r\nAnd what do you think they told me,\r\n  Mocking my awful grief?\r\nThat \'the House\' was open to us,\r\n  But they wouldn\'t give \'out relief.\'\r\n\r\n"I slunk to the filthy alley--\r\n \'Twas a cold, raw Christmas eve--\r\nAnd the bakers\' shops were open,\r\n  Tempting a man to thieve:\r\nBut I clenched my fists together,\r\n  Holding my head awry,\r\nSo I came to her empty-handed\r\n  And mournfully told her why.\r\n\r\n"Then I told her \'the House\' was open;\r\n  She had heard of the ways of _that_,\r\nFor her bloodless cheeks went crimson,\r\n  And up in her rags she sat,\r\nCrying, \'Bide the Christmas here, John,\r\n  We\'ve never had one apart;\r\nI think I can bear the hunger,--\r\n  The other would break my heart.\'\r\n\r\n"All through that eve I watched her,\r\n  Holding her hand in mine,\r\nPraying the Lord, and weeping\r\n  Till my lips were salt as brine.\r\nI asked her once if she hungered,\r\n  And as she answered \'No,\'\r\nThe moon shone in at the window\r\n  Set in a wreath of snow.\r\n\r\n"Then the room was bathed in glory,\r\n  And I saw in my darling\'s eyes\r\nThe far-away look of wonder\r\n  That comes when the spirit flies;\r\nAnd her lips were parched and parted,\r\n  And her reason came and went,\r\nFor she raved of our home in Devon\r\n  Where our happiest years were spent.\r\n\r\n"And the accents, long forgotten,\r\n  Came back to the tongue once more,\r\nFor she talked like the country lassie\r\n  I woo\'d by the Devon shore.\r\nThen she rose to her feet and trembled,\r\n  And fell on the rags and moaned,\r\nAnd, \'Give me a crust--I\'m famished--\r\n  For the love of God!\' she groaned.\r\n\r\n"I rushed from the room like a madman,\r\n  And flew to the workhouse gate,\r\nCrying \'Food for a dying woman?\'\r\n  And the answer came, \'Too late.\'\r\nThey drove me away with curses;\r\n  Then I fought with a dog in the street,\r\nAnd tore from the mongrel\'s clutches\r\n  A crust he was trying to eat.\r\n\r\n"Back, through the filthy by-lanes!\r\n  Back, through the trampled slush!\r\nUp to the crazy garret,\r\n  Wrapped in an awful hush.\r\nMy heart sank down at the threshold,\r\n  And I paused with a sudden thrill,\r\nFor there in the silv\'ry moonlight\r\n  My Nance lay, cold and still.\r\n\r\n"Up to the blackened ceiling\r\n  The sunken eyes were cast--\r\nI knew on those lips all bloodless\r\n  My name had been the last:\r\nShe\'d called for her absent husband--\r\n  O God! had I but known!--\r\nHad called in vain, and in anguish\r\n  Had died in that den--_alone_.\r\n\r\n"Yes, there, in a land of plenty,\r\n  Lay a loving woman dead,\r\nCruelly starved and murdered\r\n  For a loaf of the parish bread.\r\nAt yonder gate, last Christmas,\r\n  I craved for a human life.\r\nYou, who would feast us paupers,\r\n  _What of my murdered wife!_\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n"There, get ye gone to you dinners;\r\n  Don\'t mind me in the least;\r\nThink of the happy paupers\r\n  Eating your Christmas feast;\r\nAnd when you recount their blessings\r\n  In your snug, parochial way,\r\nSay what you did for _me_, too,\r\n  Only last Christmas Day."\r\n\r\n    _George R. Sims._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOur Presidents--A Memory Rhyme\r\n\r\n\r\nFirst on the list is Washington, Virginia\'s proudest name;\r\nJohn Adams next, the Federalist, from Massachusetts came;\r\nThree sons of old Virginia into the White House go--\r\n\'Twas Jefferson, and Madison, and then came James Monroe.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts for one term sent Adams called John Q.,\r\nAnd Tennessee a Democrat, brave Jackson staunch and true.\r\nMartin Van Buren of New York, and Harrison we see,\r\nAnd Tyler of Virginia, and Polk of Tennessee.\r\n\r\nLouisiana Taylor sent; New York Millard Fillmore;\r\nNew Hampshire gave us Franklin Pierce; when his term was o\'er\r\nThe keystone state Buchanan sent.  War thunders shook the realm\r\nAbe Lincoln wore a martyr\'s crown, and Johnson took the helm.\r\n\r\nThen U.S. Grant of Illinois who ruled with sword and pen;\r\nAnd Hayes, and Garfield who was shot, two noble Buckeye men.\r\nChester Arthur from New York, and Grover Cleveland came;\r\nBen Harrison served just four years, then Cleveland ruled again.\r\n\r\nMcKinley--shot at Buffalo--the nation plunged in grief,\r\nAnd "Teddy" Roosevelt of New York served seven years as chief.\r\nTaft of Ohio followed him. Then Woodrow Wilson came--\r\nNew Jersey\'s learned Democrat; war set the world aflame;\r\n\r\nAnd when the tide of strife and hate its baneful course had run,\r\nThe country went Republican and Warren Harding won.\r\nNo duty would he shirk,--he died while on a western trip;\r\nCoolidge of Massachusetts then assumed the leadership.\r\n\r\n    _Isabel Ambler Gilman._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAnnie and Willie\'s Prayer\r\n\r\n\r\n\'Twas the eve before Christmas; "Good night" had been said,\r\nAnd Annie and Willie had crept into bed;\r\nThere were tears on their pillows, and tears in their eyes,\r\nAnd each little bosom was heaving with sighs,\r\nFor to-night their stern father\'s command had been given\r\nThat they should retire precisely at seven\r\nInstead of at eight; for they troubled him more\r\nWith questions unheard of than ever before;\r\nHe had told them he thought this delusion a sin,\r\nNo such being as Santa Claus ever had been,\r\nAnd he hoped, after this, he should never more hear\r\nHow he scrambled down chimneys with presents, each year,\r\nAnd this was the reason that two little heads\r\nSo restlessly tossed on their soft downy beds.\r\n\r\nEight, nine, and the clock on the steeple tolled ten;\r\nNot a word had been spoken by either till then;\r\nWhen Willie\'s sad face from the blanket did peep,\r\nAnd whispered, "Dear Annie, is oo fast asleep?"\r\n"Why, no, brother Willie," a sweet voice replies,\r\n"I\'ve tried it in vain, but I can\'t shut my eyes;\r\nFor somehow, it makes me so sorry because\r\nDear papa has said there is no Santa Claus;\r\nNow we know there is, and it can\'t be denied,\r\nFor he came every year before mamma died;\r\nBut then I\'ve been thinking that she used to pray,\r\nAnd God would hear everything mamma would say;\r\nAnd perhaps she asked him to send Santa Claus here\r\nWith the sacks full of presents he brought every year."\r\n"Well, why tant we pray dest as mamma did then,\r\nAnd ask Him to send him with presents aden?"\r\n"I\'ve been thinking so, too," and, without a word more,\r\nFour little bare feet bounded out on the floor,\r\nAnd four little knees the soft carpet pressed,\r\nAnd two tiny hands were clasped close to each breast.\r\n"Now, Willie, you know we must firmly believe\r\nThat the presents we ask for we\'re sure to receive;\r\nYou must wait just as still till I say the \'Amen,\'\r\nAnd by that you will know that your turn has come then.\r\nDear Jesus, look down on my brother and me.\r\nAnd grant as the favor we are asking of Thee!\r\nI want a wax dolly, a tea-set and ring,\r\nAnd an ebony work-box that shuts with a spring.\r\nBless papa, dear Jesus, and cause him to see\r\nThat Santa Claus loves us far better than he;\r\nDon\'t let him get fretful and angry again\r\nAt dear brother Willie, and Annie, Amen!"\r\n"Peas Desus \'et Santa Taus tum down to-night,\r\nAnd bing us some pesents before it is \'ight;\r\nI want he should div me a nice ittle sed,\r\nWith bight, shiny unners, and all painted yed;\r\nA box full of tandy, a book and a toy--\r\nAmen--and then Desus, I\'ll be a dood boy."\r\nTheir prayers being ended they raised up their heads,\r\nAnd with hearts light and cheerful again sought their beds;\r\nThey were soon lost in slumber both peaceful and deep,\r\nAnd with fairies in dreamland were roaming in sleep.\r\n\r\nEight, nine, and the little French clock had struck ten\r\nEre the father had thought of his children again;\r\nHe seems now to hear Annie\'s half suppressed sighs,\r\nAnd to see the big tears stand in Willie\'s blue eyes.\r\n"I was harsh with my darlings," he mentally said,\r\n"And should not have sent them so early to bed;\r\nBut then I was troubled,--my feelings found vent,\r\nFor bank-stock to-day has gone down ten per cent.\r\nBut of course they\'ve forgotten their troubles ere this,\r\nAnd that I denied them the thrice asked-for kiss;\r\nBut just to make sure I\'ll steal up to their door,\r\nFor I never spoke harsh to my darlings before."\r\nSo saying, he softly ascended the stairs,\r\nAnd arrived at the door to hear both of their prayers.\r\nHis Annie\'s "bless papa" draws forth the big tears,\r\nAnd Willie\'s grave promise falls sweet on his ears.\r\n"Strange, strange I\'d forgotten," said he with a sigh,\r\n"How I longed when a child to have Christmas draw nigh.\r\nI\'ll atone for my harshness," he inwardly said,\r\n"By answering their prayers, ere I sleep in my bed."\r\n\r\nThen he turned to the stairs, and softly went down,\r\nThrew off velvet slippers and silk dressing-gown;\r\nDonned hat, coat, and boots, and was out in the street,\r\nA millionaire facing the cold driving sleet,\r\nNor stopped he until he had bought everything,\r\nFrom the box full of candy to the tiny gold ring.\r\nIndeed he kept adding so much to his store\r\nThat the various presents outnumbered a score;\r\nThen homeward he turned with his holiday load\r\nAnd with Aunt Mary\'s aid in the nursery \'twas stowed.\r\nMiss Dolly was seated beneath a pine-tree,\r\nBy the side of a table spread out for a tea;\r\nA work-box well filled in the centre was laid,\r\nAnd on it the ring for which Annie had prayed;\r\nA soldier in uniform stood by a sled\r\nWith bright shining runners, and all painted red;\r\nThere were balls, dogs and horses, books pleasing to see,\r\nAnd birds of all colors--were perched in the tree,\r\nWhile Santa Claus, laughing, stood up in the top,\r\nAs if getting ready more presents to drop.\r\nAnd as the fond father the picture surveyed,\r\nHe thought for his trouble he had amply been paid;\r\nAnd he said to himself as he brushed off a tear,\r\n"I\'m happier to-night than I\'ve been for a year,\r\nI\'ve enjoyed more true pleasure than ever before--\r\nWhat care I if bank-stocks fall ten per cent more.\r\nHereafter I\'ll make it a rule, I believe,\r\nTo have Santa Claus visit us each Christmas eve."\r\nSo thinking he gently extinguished the light,\r\nAnd tripped down the stairs to retire for the night.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the beams of the bright morning sun\r\nPut the darkness to flight, and the stars, one by one,\r\nFour little blue eyes out of sleep opened wide,\r\nAnd at the same moment the presents espied;\r\nThen out of their beds they sprang with a bound,\r\nAnd the very gifts prayed for were all of them found;\r\nThey laughed and they cried in their innocent glee,\r\nAnd shouted for papa to come quick and see\r\nWhat presents old Santa Claus brought in the night\r\n(Just the things that they wanted) and left before light;\r\n"And now," added Annie, in a voice soft and low,\r\n"You\'ll believe there\'s a Santa, Clans, papa, I know";\r\nWhile dear little Willie climbed up on his knee,\r\nDetermined no secret between them should be,\r\nAnd told in soft whispers how Annie had said\r\nThat their blessed mamma, so long ago dead,\r\nUsed to kneel down and pray by the side of her chair,\r\nAnd that God, up in heaven, had answered her prayer!\r\n"Then we dot up, and payed dust as well as we tould,\r\nAnd Dod answered our payers; now wasn\'t he dood?"\r\n\r\n"I should say that he was if he sent you all these,\r\nAnd knew just what presents my children would please.\r\nWell, well, let him think so, the dear little elf,\r\n\'Twould be cruel to tell him I did it myself."\r\n\r\nBlind father! who caused your proud heart to relent,\r\nAnd the hasty word spoken so soon to repent?\r\n\'Twas the Being who made you steal softly upstairs,\r\nAnd made you His agent to answer their prayers.\r\n\r\n    _Sophia P. Snow._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTrailing Arbutus\r\n\r\n\r\nI wandered lonely where the pine-trees made\r\nAgainst the bitter East their barricade,\r\n  And, guided by its sweet\r\nPerfume, I found, within a narrow dell,\r\nThe trailing spring flower tinted like a shell\r\n  Amid dry leaves and mosses at my feet.\r\n\r\nFrom under dead boughs, for whose loss the pines\r\nMoaned ceaseless overhead, the blossoming vines\r\n  Lifted their glad surprise,\r\nWhile yet the bluebird smoothed in leafless trees\r\nHis feathers ruffled by the chill sea-breeze,\r\n  And snow-drifts lingered under April skies.\r\n\r\nAs, pausing, o\'er the lonely flower I bent,\r\nI thought of lives thus lowly clogged and pent,\r\n  Which yet find room,\r\nThrough care and cumber, coldness and decay,\r\nTo lend a sweetness to the ungenial day\r\n  And make the sad earth happier for their bloom.\r\n\r\n    _J.G.

Chester._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPrayer and Potatoes\r\n\r\n\r\nAn old lady sat in her old arm-chair,\r\nWith wrinkled visage and disheveled hair,\r\n  And pale and hunger-worn features;\r\nFor days and for weeks her only fare,\r\nAs she sat there in her old arm-chair,\r\n  Had been potatoes.\r\n\r\nBut now they were gone; of bad or good.\r\nNot one was left for the old lady\'s food\r\n  Of those potatoes;\r\nAnd she sighed and said, "What shall I do?\r\nWhere shall I send, and to whom shall I go\r\n  For more potatoes?"\r\n\r\nAnd she thought of the deacon over the way,\r\nThe deacon so ready to worship and pray,\r\n  Whose cellar was full of potatoes;\r\nAnd she said: "I will send for the deacon to come;\r\nHe\'ll not mind much to give me some\r\n  Of such a store of potatoes."\r\n\r\nAnd the deacon came over as fast as he could,\r\nThinking to do the old lady some good,\r\n  But never thought of potatoes;\r\nHe asked her at once what was her chief want,\r\nAnd she, simple soul, expecting a grant,\r\n  Immediately answered, "Potatoes."\r\n\r\nBut the deacon\'s religion didn\'t lie that way;\r\nHe was more accustomed to preach and pray\r\n  Than to give of his hoarded potatoes;\r\nSo, not hearing, of course, what the old lady said,\r\nHe rose to pray with uncovered head,\r\n  But _she_ only thought of potatoes.\r\n\r\nHe prayed for patience, and wisdom, and grace,\r\nBut when he prayed, "Lord, give her peace,"\r\n  She audibly sighed "Give potatoes";\r\nAnd at the end of each prayer which he said,\r\nHe heard, or thought that he heard in its stead,\r\n  The same request for potatoes.\r\n\r\nThe deacon was troubled; knew not what to do;\r\n\'Twas very embarrassing to have her act so\r\n  About "those carnal potatoes."\r\nSo, ending his prayer, he started for home;\r\nAs the door closed behind him, he heard a deep groan,\r\n  "Oh, give to the hungry, potatoes!"\r\n\r\nAnd that groan followed him all the way home;\r\nIn the midst of the night it haunted his room--\r\n  "Oh, give to the hungry, potatoes!"\r\nHe could bear it no longer; arose and dressed;\r\nFrom his well-filled cellar taking in haste\r\n  A bag of his best potatoes.\r\n\r\nAgain he went to the widow\'s lone hut;\r\nHer sleepless eyes she had not shut;\r\nBut there she sat in that old arm-chair,\r\nWith the same wan features, the same sad air,\r\nAnd, entering in, he poured on the floor\r\nA bushel or more from his goodly store\r\n  Of choicest potatoes.\r\n\r\nThe widow\'s cup was running o\'er,\r\nHer face was haggard and wan no more.\r\n"Now," said the deacon, "shall we pray?"\r\n"Yes," said the widow, "_now_ you may."\r\nAnd he kneeled him down on the sanded floor,\r\nWhere he had poured his goodly store,\r\nAnd such a prayer the deacon prayed\r\nAs never before his lips essayed;\r\nNo longer embarrassed, but free and full,\r\nHe poured out the voice of a liberal soul,\r\nAnd the widow responded aloud "Amen!"\r\n  But spake no more of potatoes.\r\n\r\nAnd would you, who hear this simple tale,\r\nPray for the poor, and praying, "prevail"?\r\nThen preface your prayers with alms and good deeds;\r\nSearch out the poor, their wants and their needs;\r\nPray for peace, and grace, and spiritual food,\r\nFor wisdom and guidance,-for all these are good,--\r\n  _But don\'t forget the potatoes_.\r\n\r\n    _J.T.

In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
