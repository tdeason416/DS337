You\'ve stuck at\r\nit a full hour already. What\'s the use of cramming any more? You\'ll\r\nget through the exam all right; you know you always do," protested\r\nVan Blake as he flipped a scrap of blotting paper across the study\r\ntable at his roommate.\r\n\r\nBob Carlton looked up from his book. "Perhaps you\'re right, Van," he\r\nreplied, "but you see I can\'t be too sure on this stuff. Math isn\'t\r\nmy strong point, and I simply must not fall down on it; if I should\r\nflunk it would break my father all up."\r\n\r\n"You flunk! I\'d like to see you doing it." Van smiled derisively.\r\n"When you fall down on an exam the rest of us better give up. You\r\nknow perfectly well you\'ll get by. You are always worrying your head\r\noff when there\'s no earthly need of it. Now look at me. If there is\r\nany worrying to be done I\'m the one that ought to be doing it. Do I\r\nlook fussed? You don\'t catch your uncle losing any sleep over his\r\nexams--and yet I generally manage to scrape along, too."\r\n\r\n"I know you do--you old eel!" Bob glanced admiringly at his friend.\r\n"I believe you just wriggle by on the strength of your grin."\r\n\r\n"Well, if you are such a believer in a grin why don\'t you cultivate\r\none yourself and see how far it will carry you?" chuckled Van. "The\r\ntrouble with you, Bobbie, is your conscience; you ought to be\r\noperated on for it. Why are you so afraid you won\'t get good marks\r\nall the time?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not afraid; but I\'d be ashamed if I didn\'t," was the serious\r\nreply. "I promised my father that if he\'d let me come to Colversham\r\nto school I\'d do my best, and I mean to. It costs a pile of money\r\nfor him to send me here, and it\'s only decent of me to hold up my\r\nend of the bargain."\r\n\r\nVan Cortlandt Blake stretched his arms and gazed thoughtfully down\r\nat the ruler he was twirling in his fingers.\r\n\r\n"Bobbie, you\'re a trump; I wish more fellows were like you. The\r\ndifference between us is that while I perfectly agree with you I sit\r\nback and talk about it; you go ahead and do something. It\'s rotten\r\nof me not to work harder down here. I know my father is sore on it,\r\nand every time he writes I mean to take a brace and do better--honest\r\nI do, no kidding. But you know how it goes. Somebody wants me on the\r\nball nine, or on the hockey team, or in the next play, and I say yes\r\nto every one of them. The first I know I haven\'t a minute to study\r\nand then I get ragged on the exams.\r\n\r\n"You are too popular for your own good, Van.  No, I\'m not throwing\r\nspinach, straight I\'m not. What I mean is that everybody likes you.\r\nWhy, there isn\'t a more popular boy in the school! That\'s why you\r\nget pulled into every sort of thing that\'s going. It\'s all right,\r\ntoo, only if you expect to study any you\'ve got to rise up in your\r\nboots and take a stand. That\'s why I shut myself up and grind\r\nregularly part of every evening. I don\'t enjoy doing it, but it\'s\r\nthe only way."\r\n\r\nVan rose and began to roam round the room uneasily.\r\n\r\n"Goodness knows, Bobbie, if one of us didn\'t grind neither of us\r\nwould get anywhere. By the way, did you manage to dig out that\r\nCaesar for to-morrow? Fire away and give me the product of your\r\nmighty brain. I guess I can memorize the translation if you read it\r\nto me enough times."\r\n\r\nBob did not reply.\r\n\r\n"Well?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think it is a straight thing for me to translate your Latin\r\nfor you every day, Van," he said at last. "You ought not to ask me\r\nto do it."\r\n\r\n"I know it; it\'s mighty low down--I acknowledge that," answered Van\r\nfrankly. "But what would you have me do? Flunk it? Come on. I\'ll get\r\nit myself next time."\r\n\r\n"That\'s what you always say, Van, but you never do."\r\n\r\n"But I tell you I will. This week I\'ve been so rushed with the Glee\r\nClub rehearsals I couldn\'t do a thing. But you wait and view yours\r\ntruly next week."\r\n\r\nReluctantly Bob took up his Caesar and opened it.\r\n\r\n"That\'s a gentleman, Bobbie. Some time when you\'re drowning I\'ll\r\nthrow a plank to you. I knew you\'d save my life."\r\n\r\n"I do not approve of doing it at all," Bob observed, still searching\r\nfor the place in the much worn brown text-book. "I\'ve done about all\r\nyour studying this term."\r\n\r\n"I own it, oh Benefactor. Are you not my brain--my intellectual\r\nmachinery? Could I live a day without you?"\r\n\r\nLeaning across the table Van affectionately rumpled up Bob\'s tidy\r\nlocks until every individual hair stood on end.\r\n\r\n"If it weren\'t for me you\'d be dropped back into the next class--that\'s\r\nwhat would happen to you; and you deserve it, too."\r\n\r\nVan was silent.\r\n\r\n"I know it. I haven\'t put in an hour of solid work for a month, Bob\r\nI ought to be ashamed, and I am." He paused. "But there\'s no use\r\njumping all over myself if I haven\'t," he resumed, shifting to a\r\nmore sprightly tone. "I\'ve said I was going to take a spurt soon and\r\nI mean it. I\'ll begin next week."\r\n\r\n"Why not start to-day?"\r\n\r\nThere was a rap at the door.\r\n\r\n"Why not?" echoed Van, moving toward the door with evident relief.\r\n"Don\'t you see I can\'t? Somebody\'s always breaking in on my work.\r\nHere\'s somebody this very minute."\r\n\r\nHe flung open the door.\r\n\r\n"Mail. A parcels-post package for you, Bob. I\'ll bet it\'s eats. Your\r\nmother\'s a corker at sending you things; I wish my mother sent me\r\nsomething now and then."\r\n\r\n"Well, it\'s a little different with you. Your family live so far out\r\nwest they can\'t very well mail grub to you; but Mater is right here\r\nin New York, and of course as she\'s near by she\'d be no sort of a\r\nmother if she didn\'t send me something beside this prison fare. Come\r\non and see what it is this time."\r\n\r\nBob loosened the string from the big box and began unwinding the\r\nwrappings.\r\n\r\n"Plum-cake!" he cried. "A dandy great loaf! And here\'s olives, and\r\npreserved ginger, and sweet chocolate. She\'s put in salted almonds,\r\ntoo; and look--here\'s a tin box of Hannah\'s molasses cookies, the\r\nkind I used to like when I was a kid. Isn\'t my mother a peach?"\r\n\r\n"She sure is; and she must think a lot of you," said Van slowly. "I\r\nwish my mother\'d ever--"\r\n\r\n"Maybe if you pitched in a little harder here she\'d feel--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, cut out the preaching, Bobbie," was the impatient retort. "I\'ve\r\nhad enough for one day."\r\n\r\nBob did not speak, but tore open the letter that had come with the\r\nbundle.\r\n\r\n"Oh, listen to this, Van," he shouted excitedly. "Mother says they\r\nhave decided to open the New Hampshire house for Easter. They\'re\r\ngoing up for my spring vacation and take in the sugaring off. What\r\na lark! And listen to this. She writes: \'You\'d better arrange to bring\r\nyour roommate home with you for the holiday unless he has other\r\nplans.\'"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I say!"\r\n\r\n"Could you go, Van?"\r\n\r\nBob eyed his chum eagerly.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see why I couldn\'t. I\'m not going home to Colorado. It\'s\r\ntoo far. I was thinking of going to Boston with Ted Talbot, but I\'d\r\na good sight rather go batting with you, Bobbie, old man. It was\r\nfine of your mother to ask me. Where is the place?"\r\n\r\n"Our farm? It\'s in Allenville, New Hampshire, near Mount Monadnock.\r\nIt used to be my grandfather\'s home, and after he died and we all\r\nmoved to New York Father fixed it over and kept it so we could go\r\nthere summers. I\'ve never been up in the spring, though. It will be\r\nno end of fun."\r\n\r\n"I hope you do not call this weather spring," put in Van,\r\nsarcastically, pointing to the snow-buried hills outside.\r\n\r\n"Well, it is the middle of March, and it ought to be spring, if it\r\nisn\'t," answered Bob. "Just think! Only a week more of cramming;\r\nthen the exams, and we\'re off. I\'m awfully glad you can go."\r\n\r\n"You speak pretty cheerfully of the exams. I don\'t suppose you dread\r\nthem much." Van lapsed into a moody silence, kicking the crumpled\r\nwrapping-paper into the fireplace. "You don\'t need to worry, Bob.\r\nBut look at me. I\'ll be lucky if I squeak through at all. Of course\r\nI\'ve never really flunked, but I\'ve been so on the ragged edge of\r\ngoing under so many times that it\'s no fun."\r\n\r\n"Cheer up! You\'ll get through. Why, man alive, you\'ve got to. Now\r\ncome on and get at this Latin and afterward we\'ll pitch into the\r\nplum-cake."\r\n\r\n"What do you say we pitch into the cake first?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir. Not a bite of cake will you get until you have done your\r\nCaesar. Come on, Van, like a good kid, and have it over; then we\'ll\r\neat and talk about Allenville."\r\n\r\nOnce more Bob opened the book.\r\n\r\n"Here we are! You\'ve got to do it, Van, and to-morrow you\'ll be glad\r\nthat you did. Stop fooling with that paper and bring your chair\r\nround this side of the desk. Begin here: _Cum Caesar esset_--"\r\n\r\nPersistently Bob followed each line of the lesson down the page,\r\ntranslating and explaining as he went, and ungraciously Van Blake\r\nlistened.\r\n\r\nThe little brass clock on the mantelpiece ticked noisily, and the\r\nlate afternoon sun that streamed in through the windows lighted into\r\nscarlet the crimson wall-paper and threw into prominence the posters\r\ntacked upon it. It was a cozy room with its deep rattan chairs and\r\npillow-strewn couch. Snow-shoes, fencing foils, boxing-gloves, and\r\ntennis racquets littered the corners, and on every side a general\r\nair of boyish untidiness prevailed.\r\n\r\nAlthough the apartment was not, perhaps, as luxurious as a college\r\nroom, it was nevertheless entirely comfortable, for the Colversham\r\nSchool boasted among its members not only boys of moderate means but\r\nthe sons of some of the richest families in the country. It aimed to\r\nbe a democratic institution, and in so far as this was possible it\r\nwas; the school, however, was richly endowed and therefore its every\r\nappointment from its perfectly rolled tennis courts to its instructors\r\nand the Gothic architecture of its buildings was of the best.\r\n\r\nVan Cortlandt Blake, whose father was a western manufacturer, had by\r\npure chance stumbled upon Bob Carlton the day the two had alighted\r\nfrom the train and stood helpless among the new boys on the station\r\nplatform, awaiting the motor-car which was to meet them and carry\r\nthem up to the school. Before the five mile ride was finished and\r\nthe automobile had turned into the avenue of Colversham the boys had\r\nagreed to room together. Bob came from New York City. He was younger\r\nthan Van, slender, dark, and very much in earnest; he might even\r\nhave passed for a grind had it not been for his sense of humor and\r\nhis love for skating and tennis. As it was he proved to be a master\r\nat hockey, as the school team soon discovered, and before he had\r\nbeen a week at Colversham his classmates also found that he was most\r\nloyal in his friendships and a lad of unusual generosity.\r\n\r\nVan Blake was of an entirely different type. Big, husky, happy-go-lucky--a\r\npoor student but a right jolly companion; a fellow who could pitch\r\ninto any kind of sport and play an uncommonly good game at almost anything.\r\nMore than that, he could rattle off ragtime untiringly and his nimble\r\nfingers could catch up on the piano any tune he heard whistled. What\r\nwonder he speedily became the idol of Colversham? He was a born leader,\r\ntactfully marshaling at will the boys who were his own age, and\r\ngood-naturedly bullying those who were younger.\r\n\r\nTo the school authorities he presented a problem. His influence was\r\nstrong and, they felt, not always good; yet there was not a teacher\r\non the premises who did not like him. Intellectually they were\r\nforced to own that he was demoralizing. He was, moreover, a\r\ndisturber of the social order. But his pranks were, after all, pure\r\nmischief and never malicious or underhanded. With a boy like Bob\r\nCarlton as a roommate and drag anchor the principal argued he could\r\nnot go far astray.\r\n\r\nAnd so the first year had passed without mishap, and already the\r\nsecond was nearing its close. The school board congratulated itself.\r\nHad the faculty known that for most of his scholarship, poor as it\r\noften was, Van Blake was indebted to the sheer will power of Bob\r\nCarlton they might have felt less sanguine. Day after day Bob had\r\npatiently tutored his big chum in order that he might contrive to\r\nscrape through his lessons. It was Bob who did the work and Van who\r\nserenely accepted the fruits of it--accepted it but too frequently\r\nwith scant thanks and even with grumbling. Bob, however, doggedly\r\nkept at his self-imposed task. To-day\'s Latin translation was but an\r\nillustration of the daily program; Bob did the pioneering and Van\r\ncame upon the field when the path was cleared of difficulties. And\r\nyet it was a glance of genuine affection that Bob cast at his friend\r\nstretched so comfortably in the big Morris chair with a pillow at\r\nhis back.\r\n\r\n"There, you lazy villain, I think you\'ll do!" he declared at last.\r\n"Don\'t forget about the hostages in the second line; you seem pretty\r\nshaky on that. I guess, though, you\'ll pull through alive."\r\n\r\n"Bobbie, you\'re my guiding angel," returned the elder boy yawning.\r\n"When I make my pile and die rich I\'m going to leave you all my\r\nmoney."\r\n\r\n"Great Hat! Hear him. Leave me your money! What do you suppose I\'m\r\ngoing to be doing while you\'re rolling up your millions? I intend to\r\nbe rich myself, thank you," retorted Bob, throwing down his book.\r\n"Now for the plum-cake! You deserve about half the loaf, old man,\r\nbut I shan\'t give it to you, for it would make you sick as a dog,\r\nand then I\'d have you to take care of. Oh, I say, listen a minute!\r\nIsn\'t that the crowd coming from the gym? Open the window and\r\nwhistle to them. Tell \'em to pile up here for a feed. And get your\r\nmuscle to work on this olive bottle, Van. I can\'t get the cork out."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nA NARROW ESCAPE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dreaded examinations came and went and, as Van Blake expressed\r\nit, were passed with honor by Bobbie and with dishonor by himself.\r\nAfter the last one was over it was with a breath of relief that the\r\ntwo lads tossed pajamas and fresh linen into their suit-cases;\r\ncollected snow-shoes and sweaters; and set out on their New\r\nHampshire visit.\r\n\r\nIt had been a late spring and therefore although the buds were\r\nswelling and a few pussy-willows venturing from their houses the\r\ncountry was still in the grip of winter; great drifts buried\r\nroadside and valley and continued to obstruct those highways where\r\ntravel was infrequent.\r\n\r\n"There certainly is nothing very summerish about this New England\r\nweather of yours, Bob," remarked Van, as, on alighting from the\r\ntrain at Allenville, he buttoned closer his raccoon coat and stepped\r\ninto the waiting sleigh which had come to meet them.\r\n\r\n"The State did not realize you were coming, old man; otherwise they\r\nwould have had some weather especially prepared for your benefit,"\r\nBob replied, springing into the sleigh beside his chum. "My, but\r\nthis is a jolly old pung! Hear it creak. I say," he leaned forward\r\nto address the driver, "where did my father get this heirloom,\r\nDavid?"\r\n\r\n"Law, Mr. Bob, this ain\'t your father\'s," David drawled. "He ain\'t\r\ngot anything but wheeled vehicles in the barn, and not one of \'em\r\nwill be a mite of use till April. I borrowed this turnout of the\r\nMcMasters\', who live a piece down the road; the foreman, you know.\r\nIt was either this or a straight sledge, and we happened to be using\r\nthe sledges collecting sap."\r\n\r\n"Are you sugaring off already?" questioned Bob with evident\r\ndisappointment. "I understood Father to say we\'d get here in time to\r\nbe in on that."\r\n\r\n"Bless your soul, Mr. Bob, you\'ll see all you want of it," was\r\nDavid\'s quick answer. "There\'s gallons of sap that hasn\'t been\r\nboiled down yet. It\'s a great year for maple-sugar, a great year."\r\n\r\n"Are some years better than others?" Van inquired.\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed. What you want to make the sap run is a good cold snap,\r\nfollowed by a thaw. That\'s just what we\'ve been having. It\'s a prime\r\ncombination."\r\n\r\nHe jerked the reins impatiently.\r\n\r\n"Get up there, Admiral! He\'s the very worst horse to stop that ever\r\nwas made. You see in summer he drags a hay-cart, and he has to keep\r\nhalting for the hay to be piled on; then in the fall we use him for\r\nworking on the road, and he has to wait while we pick up stones and\r\nspread gravel; in the spring he makes the rounds of the sugar\r\norchard every morning and stands round on three legs while we empty\r\nthe sap buckets into the cask on the sledge. Poor soul, he never\r\nseems to get going that he ain\'t hauled up. He\'s so used to it now\r\nthat he\'d rather stop than go, I reckon."\r\n\r\nDavid\'s prophecy appeared to be quite true, for the Admiral proved\r\nto be so loath to proceed that every few paces he would hesitate,\r\nturn his head, and seem to be inquiring where the hay, stones, or\r\nsap buckets were to-day. It was only David\'s repeated urging which\r\nkept him moving at all. In consequence it was dark before the boys\r\ncaught sight of the "Pine Ridge" lights gleaming through the tangle\r\nof hemlock boughs that screened the drive, and saw the door of the\r\nhospitable old farmhouse swing open.\r\n\r\n"Well, I\'ll wager you\'re pretty hungry," a cheery voice called.\r\n\r\n"Hungry, Mother! We\'re starved--hollow down to our shoe-strings!"\r\nSwinging himself out upon the steps Bob bent and kissed his mother.\r\n"Mother, this is my roommate, Van Blake," he added.\r\n\r\n"I\'m very glad to see you, Van," Mrs. Carlton said, putting both her\r\nhands into those of the big fellow who smiled down at her. "How\r\nstrange it is that although you and Bob are such friends and he is\r\ncontinually talking and writing of you that you and I should never\r\nhave met!"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t just know how it\'s happened, Mrs. Carlton," Van answered.\r\n"It seems as if the times you\'ve been at the school to visit I\'ve\r\neither been away or shut up in the infirmary with chicken-pox or\r\nsomething. I\'m great at catching diseases, you know--I get\r\neverything that\'s going. Father says he thinks I can\'t bear to let\r\nanything get by me."\r\n\r\nHe laughed boyishly.\r\n\r\n"Speaking of fathers, where\'s Dad, Mater?"\r\n\r\n"He stopped to put another log on the fire. Come in and see what a\r\nblaze we have ready for you."\r\n\r\nThe two boys followed her into the hall, while David staggered at\r\nthe rear of the procession with the luggage.\r\n\r\nMr. Carlton came forward.\r\n\r\n"This is Van Blake, Father," Bob said, proudly introducing his chum.\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad to see you, young man," Mr. Carlton responded. "Bob\'s\r\nfriends will always find a welcome from us."\r\n\r\n"Thank you, sir."\r\n\r\nMr. Carlton reflected a moment then asked abruptly:\r\n\r\n"I don\'t suppose you happen to be a connection of the Colorado\r\nBlakes."\r\n\r\n"I come from Colorado," replied Van quickly.\r\n\r\n"You\'re not one of the sugar Blakes; not Asa Blake\'s son."\r\n\r\n"Yes," cried Van. "Mr. Asa Blake is my father, and he is in the beet\r\nsugar business. Do you know him?"\r\n\r\n"I believe I\'ve met him," Mr. Carlton admitted hurriedly, stooping\r\nto push the glowing back-log a little further forward.\r\n\r\n"Why, Father--"\r\n\r\nBob was interrupted.\r\n\r\n"Come, boys," said Mrs. Carlton bustling in. "I guess you\'ve warmed\r\nyour fingers by this time. Bob, take Van up-stairs and tumble out of\r\nthose fur coats as fast as ever you can so to be ready for dinner."\r\n\r\nThe lads needed no second bidding. They were up-stairs and back in\r\nthe dining-room in a twinkling, and so eagerly did they chatter of\r\ntheir plans for the morrow that hungry though they were they almost\r\nforgot to eat.\r\n\r\n"There are so many things to do that it is hard to decide where to\r\nbegin," declared Bob. "Of course we want some coasting and some\r\nsnow-shoeing; and we must climb Monadnock. Van says he hasn\'t seen\r\na real mountain since he came East. Then we want to be on hand for\r\nthe maple-sugar making. Why, ten days won\'t be half long enough to\r\ndo everything we ought to do."\r\n\r\nHis mother laughed.\r\n\r\n"You must have a good sleigh ride, too," she put in.\r\n\r\n"I draw the line on a sleigh ride if we have to go with that horse\r\nthat brought us up from the station," announced Bob.\r\n\r\n"Me, too!" Van echoed.\r\n\r\n"It would take you the entire ten days to get anywhere and back if\r\nyou went sleighing with the Admiral," said Mr. Carlton.\r\n\r\nEvery one smiled.\r\n\r\n"I\'d advise your seizing upon the first clear day for your Monadnock\r\ntramp," Mr. Carlton continued. "You\'d better make sure of good\r\nweather when you get it. It won\'t make so much difference with your\r\nother plans; but for the mountain trip you must have a good day."\r\n\r\n"I do want Van to get the view from the top if he makes the climb,"\r\nBob answered.\r\n\r\nSo the chat went merrily on.\r\n\r\nYet despite the gaiety of the evening and Mr. Carlton\'s evident\r\ninterest in the boys\' holiday schemes Bob more than once caught his\r\nfather furtively studying Van\'s profile. Obviously something either\r\npuzzled or annoyed him. There was, however, no want of cordiality in\r\nhis hearty goodnight or in the zest with which he advocated that if\r\nthe next morning proved to be unclouded the two lads better make\r\ncertain of their mountain excursion. He even helped lay out the walk\r\nand offered many helpful suggestions. Bob\'s uneasiness lest his\r\nfather should not like his chum vanished, and when he dropped into\r\nbed the last vague misgiving took flight, and he fell into a slumber\r\nso profound that morning came only too soon.\r\n\r\nIt was David who, entering softly to start the fire in the bedroom\r\nfireplace, awakened Bob.\r\n\r\nHe sat up and rubbed his eyes sleepily.\r\n\r\n"What sort of a day is it, David?" he questioned in a whisper that\r\nhe might not arouse Van, who was lying motionless beside him.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a grand day, Mr. Bob. There ain\'t a cobweb in the sky."\r\n\r\nDavid tiptoed out and Bob nestled down once more beneath the\r\nblankets. It was fun to lie there watching the logs blaze up and see\r\nyour breath rise on the chilly air; it was fun, too, to know that no\r\ngong would sound as it did at school and compel you to rush madly\r\ninto your clothes lest you be late for breakfast and chapel, and\r\nreceive a black mark in consequence. No, for ten delicious days\r\nthere was to be no such thing as hurry. Bob lay very still\r\nluxuriating in the thought. Then he glanced at Van, who was still\r\nimmovable, his arm beneath his cheek. His friend\'s obliviousness to\r\nthe world was irresistible. Bob raised himself carefully; caught up\r\nhis pillow; took accurate aim; and let it fly.\r\n\r\nIt struck Van in the head, routing further possibility of sleep.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you let a fellow alone?" he snapped.\r\n\r\n"Wake up, you old mummy!" shouted Bob. "A great mountain climber you\r\nare, sleeping here all day. Have you forgotten you\'re going up\r\nMonadnock to-day?"\r\n\r\n"Hang Monadnock! I was sound asleep when you lammed that pillow at\r\nme, you heathen. What\'s the good of waking me up at this unearthly\r\nhour?" yawned Van.\r\n\r\n"It\'s seven o\'clock."\r\n\r\n"Seven o\'clock!" Van straightened up and stared. "Why, man alive, I\r\nhaven\'t been asleep fifteen minutes."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve been lying like a log for nine mortal hours," chuckled Bob.\r\n\r\n"Great Scott! Some sleep, isn\'t it? That\'s better than I do at\r\nColversham."\r\n\r\n"Rat_her!_"\r\n\r\n"Well, I need sleep. I\'m worn out with over-study."\r\n\r\n"You are, like--"\r\n\r\n"I am. I\'m an intellectual wreck," moaned Van. "It\'s the Latin."\r\n\r\nBob burst into a shout, which was cut short by a rap at the door.\r\n\r\n"Time to get up, boys," called the cheery voice of Mr. Carlton.\r\n"Step lively, please. Here\'s a can of hot water."\r\n\r\nThe boys wasted no more time in fooling.\r\n\r\nThey bathed, dressed, and almost before they knew it were at the\r\ntable partaking of a hearty breakfast which was capped by heaps of\r\ngolden brown pancakes rendered even more golden by the sea of maple-syrup\r\nin which they floated.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll never be able to climb anything after this meal," Van gasped\r\nas he left the table and was thrusting his arms into his sweater.\r\n\r\nBob grinned.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t expect us back before late afternoon, Father," he called over\r\nhis shoulder. "We\'ve a long slow climb ahead of us because of the\r\nsnow. Probably we shall find it drifted in lots of places. Then we\r\nshall want some time at the top of the mountain, you know. Besides,\r\nwe\'re going to stop and cook chops, and that will delay us. So don\'t\r\nworry if we don\'t turn up much before dinner time."\r\n\r\n"You\'re sure you know the trail, Bob?" his mother called as the\r\ntrampers went down the steps.\r\n\r\n"Why, Mother dear, what a question! Know the trail? Haven\'t I\r\nclimbed that mountain so many times that I could go up it backwards\r\nand with my eyes shut?"\r\n\r\n"I guess that\'s true, Mother," agreed Mr. Carlton reassuringly.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, then," said Bob\'s mother. "Have a fine day and don\'t\r\nfreeze your noses."\r\n\r\nThe boys waved, and with a scuff of their snow-shoes were off.\r\n\r\nThe climb was indeed a stiff one. At first the trail led through\r\nlow, flat woods, fragrant with hemlock and balsam; here it was\r\nsheltered and warm. But soon the real ascent began.\r\n\r\n"We follow the bed of this brook almost to the top," explained Bob\r\nwho was leading the way. "We come into it here, you see. In summer\r\nit is a narrow path clearly marked by rough stones; you wouldn\'t\r\nbelieve how different it looks now all covered with snow. It doesn\'t\r\nseem like the same place. I didn\'t realize what a difference the\r\nsnow would make in everything. But, anyway, we can\'t miss the way\r\nwith these great boulders along the sides of the path; and even if\r\nwe did the trees are blazed."\r\n\r\nThey pushed on for some time.\r\n\r\nThen the strap of Van\'s snow-shoe broke.\r\n\r\n"Oh, thunder! Got a knife, Bob?" he called. "This darn thing\'s\r\nbusted. I\'ll have to haul to for repairs."\r\n\r\nBob stopped impatiently.\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t you look at it before you started?" he said.\r\n\r\n"Never thought of it, Old Preparedness," was the good-natured reply.\r\n"No matter, I have some string and I think I can fix it."\r\n\r\nIt took some time, however, to make the fastening to the shoe and\r\nmoccasin secure, and in the meantime the sun went behind a cloud.\r\n\r\n"I guess Father wasn\'t a very good weather prophet," remarked Bob,\r\nglancing at the sky. "It seems to be clouding up."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t fret. What do we care?" was Van\'s easy answer. "We\'re not\r\nreally after the view. I don\'t give a hurrah for what we see when we\r\nget to the top; what I want is the fun of doing it."\r\n\r\nThey shuffled on.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll be glad when this luncheon is inside instead of outside of me,\r\nwon\'t you?" puffed Bob. "It\'s almighty heavy to carry."\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t the lunch I mind. It\'s all these infernal clothes," was\r\nVan\'s retort. "I don\'t see what on earth I wore so many things for."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll want them by and by."\r\n\r\n"I bet I won\'t!" protested Van. "I\'m going to tie my red sweater to\r\nthis tree and leave it here; I can\'t be bothered with so much\r\nstuff."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll be cold when you get to the top."\r\n\r\n"No, I won\'t. And anyway I\'d rather be too cold then than too hot\r\nnow. One\'s no better than the other."\r\n\r\nDeaf to Bob\'s counsel Van resolutely wound the offending sweater\r\nabout a great white birch tree that stood at a fork of the path.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll be sorry," was Bob\'s parting thrust as they plodded on.\r\n\r\nThe trail was now steep and so narrow that frequently Bob had to\r\nstop and search for the blazing on the trees.\r\n\r\n"Of course I know my way, all right," he insisted. "Still, it is\r\nmighty different in winter from what it is at other seasons of the\r\nyear, I\'ll admit that. Remember, I\'ve never climbed this hill when\r\nthe snow was on the ground. However, when we once get to the top the\r\ncoming down will be a cinch, because we can follow our own tracks."\r\n\r\nIt was nearly two o\'clock before the boys reached the top of the\r\nmountain. Over the landscape hung a mass of heavy gray clouds\r\nbeneath which the sun was hidden; the wind was cutting as a knife,\r\nand while Van sought the shelter of an old shack Bob roamed about,\r\ndelighting in the familiar scene.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you come over here and look at the view?" he called to\r\nhis companion. "It is fairly clear in spite of the clouds."\r\n\r\nVan shivered.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t want to. I don\'t care a hang for the view--I told you\r\nthat before. I\'m just hungry. Let\'s get a fire going and cook the\r\nchops. What do you say?"\r\n\r\n"You\'re cold. I said you would be."\r\n\r\n"I\'m not. I\'m starved, though. Where can we get some wood?"\r\n\r\nBob glanced about.\r\n\r\n"There seems to be plenty of undergrowth down in that hollow. Take\r\nmy knife and cut away some of it. There\'s a piece of an old stump,\r\ntoo, that ought to burn well if it isn\'t too wet."\r\n\r\n"That thing would never burn; but the brush will. Sling me the knife\r\nand I\'ll cut an armful. Let\'s build it in that little rocky shelter.\r\nThanks to my camping training I\'m right at home on this job."\r\n\r\nVan\'s boast was no idle one. Soon the fire was crackling merrily and\r\nthe chops and bacon were sizzling in the frying-pan. Bob unpacked\r\nthe sandwiches and the thermos bottle of hot chocolate.\r\n\r\nIt was a regal luncheon.\r\n\r\nHow good everything tasted!\r\n\r\n"I believe I was cold," Van admitted, rubbing his hands over the\r\ndying embers of the blaze. "But I\'m warm as toast now. Is there any\r\nmore grub left to eat?"\r\n\r\n"Not a crumb--why? Are you still hungry?" queried Bob who was\r\npacking up the camping kit.\r\n\r\nVan chuckled.\r\n\r\n"Well, not exactly. I only thought we ought not to waste anything."\r\n\r\nBob glanced up and laughed; then his face grew sober.\r\n\r\n"I say, there\'s a snowflake!" he cried. "And another! Jove, Van,\r\nit\'s begun to snow!"\r\n\r\n"We better be getting down, I suppose," drawled Van.\r\n\r\n"Just that, old man; fast as we can, too. Come on."\r\n\r\n"What\'s your hurry? It will be a lark."\r\n\r\n"It will be no lark if it snows much--I\'ll tell you that," replied\r\nBob seriously. "Besides, the folks will worry. Come ahead."\r\n\r\nThey turned back down the trail.\r\n\r\nThe snowfall increased.\r\n\r\n"You can hardly see our tracks already," Bob called over his\r\nshoulder. "And this wind is fierce. I had no idea it would snow. It\r\nis awfully wet and sticky snow, too; see how it clings to the\r\ntrees."\r\n\r\nThey sped on.\r\n\r\nThe descent was far easier than the climb, and they could go\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t remember that big rock," exclaimed Van suddenly, pointing\r\nto a huge boulder that fronted them. "Isn\'t it a whacker! Odd that\r\nI didn\'t notice it when we came up. Could we have passed it and not\r\nseen it?"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "I DON\'T REMEMBER THAT BIG ROCK"]\r\n\r\n"I suppose we must have," Bob answered. "I don\'t remember it,\r\nthough. Everything looks queer and different in the storm. It\'s a\r\nregular squall. How quickly it came!"\r\n\r\n"Can you still see our tracks?"\r\n\r\n"No. But of course we\'re right; I couldn\'t miss my way after coming\r\nover this path so many times."\r\n\r\n"Can you see the blazes on the trees?"\r\n\r\n"No, silly. How could I when they are all plastered over thick with\r\nsnow?" was Bob\'s scornful retort. He was silent for a moment. "But\r\ndon\'t you worry," he declared. "I am certain we came this way--at\r\nleast I _think_ we did."\r\n\r\nHis tone, however, was less convincing.\r\n\r\nThey went on.\r\n\r\n"We don\'t seem to be coming out anywhere, do we?" Van finally asked.\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t we pass a little clearing somewhere on the way up?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, there was one."\r\n\r\n"Have we passed it?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Then it\'s ahead of us."\r\n\r\n"It ought to be. I say, suppose we stop a minute and brush the snow\r\noff these trees so to make sure we really are on the trail."\r\n\r\n"A bully idea!"\r\n\r\nThe boys put down their packs and reconnoitred.\r\n\r\n"There don\'t seem to be any marks on these trees," Van asserted\r\nafter an interval of search.\r\n\r\n"But there must be."\r\n\r\n"Find them then--if you can."\r\n\r\nBob nervously scrutinized several gnarled trunks.\r\n\r\n"You\'re right, Van," he owned at last. "We\'re off the trail; missed\r\nit somehow. We\'d better go back; we can\'t be far wrong. Or better\r\nyet, you wait here while I hunt."\r\n\r\nBob was very grave.\r\n\r\n"You bet I\'m not going to be left here to be buried in snow like the\r\nBabes in the Wood," protested Van gaily. "No sir-ee! I don\'t stay\r\nhere. I\'ll help hunt for the path too. Now don\'t go getting nervous,\r\nBobbie, old chap. Two of us can\'t very well get lost on this\r\nmountain. We\'ll separate enough to keep within hallooing distance,\r\nand we\'ll tie a handkerchief on this tree so we can get back to it\r\nagain if we want to. We know we\'re part way down, anyway. That\'s\r\ncertain."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t feel so sure," was Bob\'s answer. "We ought to have turned\r\nback when it began to cloud up; but I never dreamed of snow. The\r\nfamily will be having a blue fit about us."\r\n\r\n"Cheer up! We\'ll get down all right, only it may take us a little\r\nlonger," Van asserted.\r\n\r\nThey branched into a side path.\r\n\r\nThe snow swirled about them in blinding sheets, and their footing\r\nbecame heavy and slippery.\r\n\r\nWandering on, they scanned the trees.\r\n\r\nNot a mark appeared.\r\n\r\nBoth boys were chilled now, and their spirits drooped.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of being lost on the mountain began to definitely\r\nform itself in their minds.\r\n\r\n"I\'m mighty sorry I got you into this scrape, Van," Bob said after\r\na long pause. "I was too cock-sure of myself. That comes of thinking\r\nyou know it all."\r\n\r\n"Pooh! It wasn\'t your fault, Bob. I\'d give a cent, though, to know\r\nwhere we are. Do you suppose we\'ve been making any progress all this\r\ntime, or just going round in a circle?"\r\n\r\n"Search me. I\'ll bet we\'ve walked miles," groaned Bob. "I\'ve got to\r\nrest if we never find the trail."\r\n\r\nHe spoke wearily.\r\n\r\n"You\'re not going to sit down, Bob," Van retorted sharply. "Brace\r\nup. You\'ve got to keep moving."\r\n\r\n"But I can\'t. I\'m tired and--and--sleepy."\r\n\r\nHis voice trailed off into a yawn.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t care." Van wheeled on his friend fiercely and striding up\r\nto him shook him violently by the shoulders. "Now pull yourself\r\ntogether!" he commanded. "Where\'s your nerve? Brace up or I\'ll\r\nrattle the daylights out of you."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t go another step."\r\n\r\n"You\'ve got to. Start on ahead. Don\'t crawl that way--walk! Faster!\r\nFaster than that, do you hear? I\'m just behind you, and I shall step\r\non your heels if you lag. Keep it up. Go on."\r\n\r\nPanting, Bob obeyed.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he gave a cry.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?" demanded Van.\r\n\r\n"There! There on the tree!" He pointed before him with trembling\r\nhand. "Your sweater!"\r\n\r\nVan pushed past him.\r\n\r\n"Sure as fate! My sweater! Blamed if it isn\'t."\r\n\r\nThey both laughed weakly.\r\n\r\n"Then we\'ve found the trail!" Bob almost sobbed the words.\r\n\r\n"We sure have! And hark, don\'t you hear voices? It\'s David, as I\'m\r\nalive; and your father!"\r\n\r\nAid had indeed come.\r\n\r\n"Father!" Bob shouted the word and then laughed again--this time a\r\nbit hysterically.\r\n\r\n"The rescuing party\'s right here!" called Mr. Carlton.\r\n\r\nHe said it lightly, but as he came up and joined them Van saw that\r\nhis face was drawn and his eyes suspiciously bright.\r\n\r\n"David has the sledge just at the foot of the hill," he remarked,\r\nappearing not to notice the boy\'s fatigue. "I guess you\'d just as\r\nsoon ride the rest of the way."\r\n\r\nHe slipped an arm around Bob.\r\n\r\n"It\'s not much farther, son. Move right along as fast as you can.\r\nHurry, boy. Your mother\'s pretty worried. Thank goodness we found\r\nyou in time."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nSUGARING OFF\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning, incredible as it seemed, Bob and Van were none the\r\nworse for their mountain trip, and Mr. Carlton, who had worried no\r\nlittle about them, and who was still feeling the effects of his\r\nhours of anxiety, remarked somewhat wrathfully:\r\n\r\n"You two fellows come to the surface like a pair of corks! Any one\r\nwould think that being lost on a mountain was an every-day\r\noccurrence with you. That is the difference between sixteen and\r\nforty-six, I suppose. My poor old nerves rebel at being jolted in\r\nsuch casual fashion."\r\n\r\nBob smiled.\r\n\r\n"We\'re fit as two fighting cocks to-day, Father," he declared. "In\r\nfact, this very minute we\'re going out to help David collect sap.\r\nThey are going to boil a lot of it down to-day."\r\n\r\n"I imagined as much when I saw the smoke rising from the sugar-house\r\nchimney. Well, you seem to have your morning\'s work mapped out. Just\r\ndon\'t get lost again, for I have no mind to go scouring the country\r\na second time to find you."\r\n\r\n"We\'ll take good care, Mr. Carlton," Van replied, giving a final tug\r\nat his long rubber boots.\r\n\r\n"You may not lose yourself, Van," Bob chuckled, "but I am morally\r\ncertain you\'ll lose your boots. You will just walk off and leave\r\nthem in some snow-drift or mud puddle and never miss them. They are\r\nbig enough for an elephant. Where did you get them, anyway?"\r\n\r\n"They\'re an old pair David lent me; your father said I\'d better wear\r\nthem."\r\n\r\n"He\'s dead right, too. The snow is still deep in spots, and it is\r\nthawing everywhere. It is not the boots I\'m quarreling with; it\'s\r\ntheir size. I guess, though, you can get on somehow. We want to cut\r\nacross the road and make for that hill over to the right. That\'s\r\nwhere the sugar-house is; it stands in the middle of an orchard of\r\nmaples which were planted by my grandfather. Of course we have other\r\nmaple trees scattered about the farm and David taps those, too; but\r\nmost of our sugar comes from this orchard."\r\n\r\n"Did your grandfather make maple-sugar to sell?"\r\n\r\n"Goodness, no! He made it to use. White sugar, you must understand,\r\nwas not so common in the olden days as it is now. Very little of it\r\nwas grown in our country; and so, as it had to be brought from the\r\nEast Indies, Spain, and South America, it was pretty expensive.\r\nGrandfather told me once that when he was a boy people used brown\r\nsugar or maple-sugar to sweeten their food, and sometimes they even\r\nused cheap molasses. White sugar was looked upon as a great luxury."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I ever realized that before," said Van thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n"Why, even my father remembers when, as a little shaver, he used to\r\nhave white sugar spread on his bread for a treat."\r\n\r\n"Seems queer, doesn\'t it?" Van mused.\r\n\r\n"Yes. But it isn\'t so queer when you consider that all the sugar-cane\r\nnow growing in America first had to be brought to the West Indies\r\nfrom Spain, the Canary Islands, or Madeira and then transplanted\r\nalong the Mississippi delta. Dad says that originally sugar-cane came\r\nfrom Africa or India and that doubtless it was the Crusaders who\r\nintroduced it into Europe."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean to tell me that people never knew about sugar until\r\nthen?" inquired Van incredulously, halting in the middle of the\r\nroad.\r\n\r\n"The Chinese were practically the only people who did, and they did\r\nnot use it at all as we do; they just sweetened things with the thin\r\nsap."\r\n\r\nVan regarded his chum steadily for a moment.\r\n\r\n"Say," he demanded at last, "how did you come to know so much,\r\nBobbie?"\r\n\r\n"What? Oh, about sugar? I don\'t know much. I just happen to remember\r\na few scraps Father has told me from time to time. He\'s in the sugar\r\nbusiness, you know."\r\n\r\n"Really? No, I didn\'t know. You never said anything about it. Cane-sugar?"\r\n\r\n"Yes." Bob watched Van curiously.\r\n\r\n"That\'s odd."\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, because my father is in the sugar business too. Don\'t you\r\nrecall my telling your father so? Yes, my dad makes beet sugar."\r\n\r\n"Then that\'s how my father happened to know your father!" exclaimed\r\nBob quickly. "I suppose they\'re business friends. I\'ve been\r\nwondering why Father kept watching you. Probably he sees in you some\r\nresemblance to your father. Do you look like him?"\r\n\r\n"I hardly know. Some people think I do. My mother says so," was\r\nVan\'s indifferent response. "But say, tell me more about sugar.\r\nYou\'d think with my father right in the business I\'d know something\r\nabout it; but I don\'t. Do they get sugar from anything beside beets,\r\nand sugar-cane, and maple sap?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, my, yes. There\'s sugar in ever so many other things: in grapes,\r\nand milk, and the date palm, and in maize; but it is from the beet\r\nand cane that the most sugar can be extracted."\r\n\r\nVan nodded.\r\n\r\n"You\'re quite a lecturer, Bobbie," he said. "Wait until I get back\r\nhome and astonish my father with all this knowledge. I\'ll make his\r\neyes stick out."\r\n\r\nVan broke into hearty laughter at the thought. Then, as he started\r\nto walk on he gave a shout of dismay.\r\n\r\n"Hold onto me, Bob," he cried. "I can\'t move. While I\'ve been\r\nstanding here listening to your words of wisdom I\'ve been sinking\r\ndeeper and deeper into your old yellow mud until now I can\'t stir.\r\nI can\'t--upon my word. My feet are in perfectly solid. You can laugh\r\nif you want to, but you\'ve just got to pull me out, that\'s all.\r\nHelp! Help! To the rescue. I shall disappear in another minute.\r\nDavid will never see his rubber boots again."\r\n\r\n"Of course you can get your feet out," was Bob\'s scornful retort.\r\n\r\n"Cross my heart I can\'t. Honest, Bobbie," protested Van. "I\'ve got\r\ninto a quicksand or a quagmire or something. Look at me. I\'m up to\r\nmy knees now, and if you don\'t hurry you\'ll see nothing of me but my\r\ncollar. I saved your life yesterday; you might do the same for me\r\nto-day."\r\n\r\nBut Bob was too convulsed with amusement to offer aid; instead he\r\nstood on a large rock at the roadside and laughed immoderately.\r\n\r\n"Pull! Pull!" he cried to Van. "Why don\'t you pull?"\r\n\r\n"I am pulling," Van answered. "But it does no good. I can\'t budge my\r\nfeet. I never saw such mud in all my life. It must be yards deep. It\r\nsucks my boots right off. You\'ll have to help me."\r\n\r\n"Not I! I know too well what would happen. It would be like\r\nKipling\'s story of the Elephant\'s Child. Don\'t you remember, when\r\nthe crocodile let go the nose of the little elephant how he suddenly\r\nsat down _plop_. I\'ve no notion of being pulled into this mud\r\nhole when your rubber boots come to the surface. You\'ll have to get\r\nyourself out."\r\n\r\n"You old heathen! It is not a straight game to fit me out with a\r\npair of hip rubber boots miles too large for me and then sit and\r\nhowl when you see me losing my life in them. Well, you needn\'t come\r\ninto the mire if you don\'t want to, but you can at least be\r\ngentleman enough to pass me the end of that pole that is lying\r\nbeside you," said Van.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll do that."\r\n\r\nBob picked up a long branch from the ground.\r\n\r\n"Here!" he cried. "Catch hold of this and pull."\r\n\r\nThe two boys tugged at opposite ends of the stick.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly and quite without warning something happened.\r\n\r\nThe dead wood parted and Bob hurtled backward off the rock where he\r\nhad been standing and landed in a snow-drift; while Van, much to his\r\nastonishment, sat down with abruptness in the wettest of the mud.\r\n\r\nTwo more chagrined boys could nowhere have been found.\r\n\r\nBob was the first to get to his feet. Shaking the snow out of his\r\nhair and collar he called:\r\n\r\n"Get up, you--unless you want to be swallowed up for life. My eye,\r\nbut you\'re a sight! If your mother could only see you now. Well,\r\nyour feet are out, if you did have to get in all over to do it. Now\r\nstep lively if you don\'t want to get stuck again. You are a peach,\r\nI must say!"\r\n\r\nVan took the banter good-naturedly.\r\n\r\n"That\'s what one might call being buried alive," he answered. "Lucky\r\nit wasn\'t you! I\'m tall and could keep my head out; but the mire\r\nwould long since have closed over an abbreviated person like\r\nyourself and you would have been seen no more."\r\n\r\nBob winced. He was sensitive about his height.\r\n\r\nClambering up on the rock beside his chum Van scooped up a handful\r\nof clean snow and with it washed his hands and face.\r\n\r\n"There!" he said at length. "I\'m just as tidy as if it had not\r\nhappened."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t exactly agree with you," replied Bob, "but I guess you\'ll\r\nhave to do. Come on now. Goodness only knows where David and the\r\nsledge have got to by this time."\r\n\r\nThey hurried up the hill.\r\n\r\n"There\'s David!" Van said, as they reached the crest of the rise.\r\n\r\nIt was David sure enough; and standing beside him in his customary\r\nmotionless attitude was the Admiral harnessed into a great sledge\r\nsurmounted by a barrel into which David was pouring the sap as fast\r\nas he gathered it. At the moment the man was busy detaching one of\r\nthe sap buckets from the trunk of a giant maple.\r\n\r\nThe boys joined him.\r\n\r\n"What are you doing, Dave?" asked Van curiously.\r\n\r\n"Doing! Ain\'t you got eyes, young man? I certainly ain\'t writing a\r\nbook or taking a wireless message," he answered without turning his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n"But straight, I mean it. What are you doing? You know this business\r\nis new to me," explained Van.\r\n\r\n"Haven\'t you ever seen maple-sugar made?" David\'s tone was full of\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n"Never."\r\n\r\n"Well, bless my soul! Where was you raised?"\r\n\r\n"In Colorado."\r\n\r\n"Humph! That accounts for it. If you\'d been brought up in the East\r\nyou\'d have known."\r\n\r\n"But I was raised in the East, David, and I\'ve never seen maple-sugar\r\nmade," piped Bob, instantly overthrowing the old farmer\'s philosophy.\r\n\r\n"You ain\'t never--you ain\'t seen maple-syrup or maple-sugar made,\r\nMr. Bob?" queried David aghast.\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Well, what are we coming to?"\r\n\r\nThe farmhand surveyed the boys disdainfully.\r\n\r\n"What you been doing with yourself all your days?" he gasped at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been going to school."\r\n\r\n"And they ain\'t taught you to make maple-sugar?  That\'s about all\r\nschooling is worth nowadays," he affirmed. "Now I warn\'t never\r\ninside a schoolhouse in my life, but I\'ve known from the time I was\r\nknee-high to a grasshopper how to make maple-sugar. I made pounds of\r\nit before I was half the age of you two. The boys of this generation\r\ndon\'t know nothin\'!"\r\n\r\nHe sniffed contemptuously.\r\n\r\n"Well, you may as well learn before you\'re a minute older," he\r\ncontinued. "Listen, now. Do you see the little hole in this maple?"\r\nHe pointed up at the gray trunk above his head. "We make a little\r\nhole like that in every tree as soon as the sap begins to run in the\r\nearly spring. Then we drive into the hole this small piece of hollow\r\nwood--it is like a trough, you see; and the sap runs through it\r\ninto the buckets we hang beneath. All day and all night it drips in\r\nand each morning we go round and empty every pail into the cask we\r\ncarry on the sledge. The sap, as you see, is thin, because only part\r\nof it is sugar; the rest is water. What we have to do is to boil\r\ndown the liquid until the part that is water goes off in vapor and\r\nonly the syrup is left. If we\'re after maple-syrup we let it cool\r\nwhen it gets thick and later bottle it; but if we want sugar we must\r\nboil the syrup still more until little crystals form in it."\r\n\r\n"How can you tell when it has been boiled enough?" questioned Van.\r\n\r\n"Oh, we\'ve made it enough times to know," David replied. "Some folks\r\nstick a thermometer into it and figger how hot it will have to be;\r\nthey say that\'s the best way. Others try the syrup in cold water or\r\non snow like you would candy. Generally speaking, I can tell by the\r\nfeel of it, and by the way it drips from the spoon. Sometimes,\r\nthough, when I\'m in doubt I try it on snow myself. If it gets kinder\r\nsoft and waxy you can be sure it is getting done. If I was you\r\ninstead of tracking round emptying buckets I\'d go in the sugar-house\r\nand see \'em boiling the syrup. They started yesterday, and as I\r\ncalculate it the mess ought to be pretty well along by now."\r\n\r\n"Bully idea, David! What do you say, Van?" asked Bob. "Shall we\r\ntrail David or shall we go in and see the sugar made?"\r\n\r\n"Sugar! Sugar! Me for the sugar!" Van cried.\r\n\r\n"Sugar it is then!"\r\n\r\nInto the sugar-house they went.\r\n\r\nThe small room was hot and steamy, and in the middle of it in a\r\nzinc-lined tank the foaming sap was boiling furiously. Beside it\r\nstood McMasters, Mr. Carlton\'s foreman, a thermometer in his hand.\r\n\r\n"Good-morning, Mr. Bob," he said. "So you are coming to cast an eye\r\non the maple-sugar! Last week we made syrup and bottled it. Not a\r\nbad day\'s work, eh?"\r\n\r\nWith no little pride he pointed to a row of neat bottles\r\nsymmetrically arranged on a shelf. "We\'ll seal them to-morrow or\r\nnext day and get the labels on, and then they will be ready to sell.\r\nBut to-day it\'s sugar, so we have to keep the sap at a higher\r\ntemperature."\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he paused to test the bubbling liquid in the kettle.\r\n\r\n"If you lads want a treat take one of those wooden plates over there\r\nand fill it with snow; I\'ll spoon some of this hot sap over it, and\r\nyou will have a feast for a king."\r\n\r\nThe boys needed no urging. They took the plates, hurried out, and\r\nsoon returned with them; over the heap of snow the foreman poured\r\nseveral heaping spoonfuls of hot syrup which, to their surprise,\r\ncooled in an incredibly short time and stiffened into a sticky mass\r\nthat looked like candy.\r\n\r\n"Now get one of those wooden skewers from the shelf and use it as a\r\nfork," McMasters said.\r\n\r\nThe boys caught the idea at once.\r\n\r\nThey gathered the candied syrup up on the end of the sticks and\r\nthrust it into their mouths.\r\n\r\n"Why, it is just like toffy!" Van exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"It is a sight fresher than anything you could buy at the store,"\r\nobserved the foreman.\r\n\r\n"I believe I\'ve got to have some more, Mac," Bob said. "Somehow it\r\nmelts away before you know you\'re eating it."\r\n\r\nHe refilled his plate with fresh snow and held it out for a second\r\nhelping of syrup.\r\n\r\nMcMasters filled it good-naturedly.\r\n\r\nBut when the plates were extended the fourth and fifth time the\r\nScotchman demurred.\r\n\r\n"It is no stuff to make a meal of, Mr. Bob," protested he. "And at\r\nten o\'clock in the morning, too. I\'ll give you no more. It is too\r\nsweet. Next you know the two of you will be spending your vacation\r\nin bed and wondering what\'s the matter with you. Why, we\'d have no\r\nsugar at all if you should stay here eating at this rate. If it\'s candy\r\nyou\'re wantin\', ask the cook to boil some maple-syrup until it is\r\nthick like molasses candy; then turn it out of the pan and when it\r\nis almost cool pull it until it turns white. You\'ll find it better\r\nthan any candy you can buy. Try it."\r\n\r\n"We certainly will, Mac, and thanks for the suggestion," Bob\r\nreplied.\r\n\r\n"And while you\'re at it you might hunt up some butternuts and stir\r\nthem in; I\'ll recommend the result and will wager you\'ll think it as\r\ngood as anything you ever ate."\r\n\r\nOnce more he took the temperature of the steaming sap.\r\n\r\n"We\'re going to put some of the sugar in those tin pails and sell\r\nit," he continued. "Each pail holds ten pounds. And some we shall\r\npour into those small tin moulds and make little scalloped cakes for\r\nour own use. I reckon you can have some of them to take back to\r\ncollege when you go. We\'ll certainly have a plenty to spare you\r\nsome, for your father will make a handsome thing out of his sugar\r\nthis year. I wouldn\'t wonder but you\'re being educated on maple-sugar\r\nmoney. You better make your bow of thanks to the trees as you go\r\nthrough the orchard," he added whimsically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE REFINERY\r\n\r\n\r\nVacation with its country sports came to an end only too quickly,\r\nand leaving the New Hampshire hills behind the Carlton family,\r\ntogether with Van Blake, set out for New York where the boys were to\r\nmake a weekend visit before returning to Colversham.\r\n\r\n"I wish while we\'re in New York we could go through your refinery,\r\nDad," Bob remarked to his father.\r\n\r\nMr. Carlton glanced at him in surprise.\r\n\r\n"What set you thinking of that, Bob?" he asked. "You never were\r\ninterested in sugar making before."\r\n\r\n"I know it, Father." Bob flushed guiltily. "I ought to have been.\r\nBut since we have seen maple-sugar made Van and I thought it would\r\nbe fun to see the process that white sugar has to go through before\r\nit is ready for the market."\r\n\r\n"Van thought so, did he?" queried Mr. Carlton.\r\n\r\n"Why, yes, he thought so. I believe, though, it was I who suggested\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Humph!" murmured Mr. Carlton. He mused a moment. "I suppose it\r\nwould do no harm," he said at last, half to himself.\r\n\r\n"Harm!"\r\n\r\n"No, no! Of course not," interrupted Mr. Carlton hurriedly. "The\r\nprocess is an open secret anyway, except perhaps--Oh, I guess it\r\nwould be all right."\r\n\r\nBob regarded his father with a puzzled stare.\r\n\r\n"I will arrange for you and Van to go through the works right away,"\r\ncontinued Mr. Carlton. "It simply will be necessary for me to\r\ntelephone the superintendent and tell him you are coming so he will\r\nhave some one on hand to explain things to you. This was your\r\nscheme, you say?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir. Why?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing, nothing," was Mr. Carlton\'s enigmatic reply.\r\n\r\nHe was as good as his word, for despite his peculiar reluctance in\r\nthe matter he lost no time in perfecting the plan, and the next\r\nmorning after the party reached New York he informed the boys that\r\nthe motor-car would be at the door at nine o\'clock to take them to\r\nthe refinery.\r\n\r\nBob and Van, to whom New York was more or less of an old story,\r\nhailed this announcement with pleasure and promptly stowed\r\nthemselves away in the big limousine which was to whirl them to Long\r\nIsland where the works were located. All the way out Van was\r\nsingularly silent, and appeared to be turning something over in his\r\nmind; once he started to speak, but checked himself abruptly.\r\n\r\nBob watched him uneasily.\r\n\r\n"I believe you\'ve lost your enthusiasm about sugar," said he at\r\nlast, "and did not really want to come."\r\n\r\n"What a notion! Of course I wanted to come."\r\n\r\n"But you seem so glum, old man."\r\n\r\n"Glum! Nonsense! I never was in better spirits in my life."\r\n\r\nWith a sudden shifting of the subject Van pointed to a stack of\r\nchimneys cleaving the sky and observed:\r\n\r\n"I wonder if those belong to your father\'s plant?"\r\n\r\n"I fancy they do," was Bob\'s quick answer. "Dad said we\'d see a\r\nbunch of tall chimneys, and that the refinery was of yellow brick."\r\n\r\n"Then this is the place," Van declared, drumming on the window glass\r\nwith forced gaiety.\r\n\r\nHe did not, however, leap from the car with the spring of\r\nanticipation that Bob did, and noticing his spiritless step his\r\nfriend once more remarked upon it.\r\n\r\n"You seem bored to death to have to drag yourself through here,\r\nVan," said he. "What\'s the matter? You know if you do not want to\r\ncome you don\'t have to."\r\n\r\n"I do want to."\r\n\r\n"But somehow you seem so-so--"\r\n\r\n"So _what?_"\r\n\r\n"Why, you seem to hang back as if you could hardly put one foot\r\nbefore the other," answered Bob. "Don\'t you feel well?"\r\n\r\n"Prime! There\'s nothing the matter with me. What put that idea into\r\nyour head?"\r\n\r\n"Chiefly you yourself."\r\n\r\n"Well, cut it out. I don\'t see what you\'re fussing about me for. I\'m\r\njust as anxious to see how sugar is made as you are."\r\n\r\nStill Bob was unconvinced. He could not have explained why, but he\r\nfelt certain that Van\'s enthusiasm was feigned. For a second he\r\npaused undecidedly on the pavement before the door of the great\r\nfactory; then shrugging his shoulders he entered, followed closely\r\nby his chum.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that they were expected, for a clerk rose from his\r\ndesk and came forward to greet them.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Hennessey, the superintendent, said I was to bring you to his\r\noffice when you arrived," he said.\r\n\r\n"Thank you."\r\n\r\n"You are Mr. Carlton\'s son, aren\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"I thought you must be. Mr. Hennessey himself is going to take you\r\nthrough the works."\r\n\r\nThe clerk led the way to the door of a private office, where he\r\nknocked.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Carlton and his friend are here," he announced to the boy who\r\nopened the door. "Tell Mr. Hennessey right away."\r\n\r\nThe boys had not a moment to wait before a large man with a genial\r\nface and outstretched hand came forward.\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad to see you, Mr. Carlton," he said. "I\'m Hennessey, the\r\nsuperintendent. Possibly you may have heard your father speak of me;\r\nI have been helping him make sugar for twenty years."\r\n\r\nBob smiled up into the eyes of the big man looking down at him.\r\n\r\n"Indeed Dad has spoken of you, Mr. Hennessey," he said, returning\r\nthe hearty hand-shake. "He depends on you a lot. He says he always\r\nfeels sure that when you\'re on the job everything will be all\r\nright."\r\n\r\nMr. Hennessey flushed with pleasure.\r\n\r\n"I merely try to run your father\'s place as if it were my own," was\r\nthe modest rejoinder.\r\n\r\n"That\'s just it--that\'s why Father feels he can go to the North Pole\r\nif he wants to and not worry while he\'s gone," nodded Bob. "I think\r\nit is mighty good of you to bother with my chum and me. Can\'t you\r\nsend some one to take us through the refinery? There is not the\r\nslightest need for you to go with us yourself."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I wouldn\'t think of turning you over to some one else. You see\r\nI am interested in your sugar education; I can\'t allow the boss\'s\r\nson to get a wrong start in the business," laughed Mr. Hennessey.\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid I\'m not starting in the business," protested Bob,\r\nshaking his head deprecatingly. "I\'m only trying to learn a little\r\nsomething about Dad\'s job, so I can be a bit more intelligent about\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"You\'re going to investigate the way your father earns his money,\r\neh?" chuckled the superintendent. "Well, I\'ll tell you right now you\r\nneed do no blushing for your father\'s business methods; he makes his\r\nfortune as cleanly and honestly as any man could make it."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll take a chance on Dad," was the laconic response.\r\n\r\n"You can do so with safety."\r\n\r\nThere was a pause and turning Bob introduced Van Blake.\r\n\r\nThen after the two boys had been provided with duck coats so that\r\nnone of the sticky liquid that sometimes dripped from the machinery\r\nshould spot their clothing the three set out for the basement of the\r\nfactory, where the incoming cargoes of sugar were unloaded. Here\r\ngreat bags or casks of raw sugar were being opened, and their\r\ncontents emptied into wooden troughs preparatory to cleansing and\r\nrefining.\r\n\r\nBoth lads regarded with surprise the material that was being tipped\r\nout into the bins.\r\n\r\n"Why, it looks like nothing but coarse, muddy snow!" ejaculated Van.\r\n"Do you really mean to tell us that you can make that brown stuff\r\nwhite, Mr. Hennessey?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s what we\'re here for," answered Mr. Hennessey, obviously\r\nenjoying his amazement. "All raw sugar comes to us this way. You\r\nsee, it is about the color of maple or brown sugar, but it is not\r\nnearly so pure, for it has a great deal of dirt mixed with it when\r\nwe first get it."\r\n\r\n"Where does it come from?" inquired Bob.\r\n\r\n"Largely from the plantations of Cuba and Porto Rico. Toward the end\r\nof the year we also get raw sugar from Java, and by the time this is\r\nrefined and ready for the market the new crop from the West Indies\r\ncomes along. In addition to this we get consignments from the\r\nPhilippine Islands, the Hawaiian Islands, South America, Formosa,\r\nand Egypt. I suppose it is quite unnecessary to tell you young men\r\nanything of how the cane is grown; of course you know all that."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe we do, except in a general way," Bob admitted\r\nhonestly. "I am ashamed to be so green about a thing at which Dad\r\nhas been working for years. I don\'t know why I never asked about it\r\nbefore. I guess I never was interested. I simply took it for\r\ngranted."\r\n\r\n"That\'s the way with most of us," was the superintendent\'s kindly\r\nanswer. "We accept many things in the world without actually knowing\r\nmuch about them, and it is not until something brings our ignorance\r\nbefore us that we take the pains to focus our attention and learn\r\nabout them. So do not be ashamed that you do not know about sugar\r\nraising; I didn\'t when I was your age. Suppose, then, I give you a\r\nlittle idea of what happens before this raw sugar can come to us."\r\n\r\n"I wish you would," exclaimed both boys in a breath.\r\n\r\n"Probably in your school geographies you have seen pictures of\r\nsugar-cane and know that it is a tall perennial not unlike our\r\nIndian corn in appearance; it has broad, flat leaves that sometimes\r\nmeasure as many as three feet in length, and often the stalk itself\r\nis twenty feet high. This stalk is jointed like a bamboo pole, the\r\njoints being about three inches apart near the roots and increasing\r\nin distance the higher one gets from the ground."\r\n\r\n"How do they plant it?" Bob asked.\r\n\r\n"It can be planted from seed, but this method takes much time and\r\npatience; the usual way is to plant it from cuttings, or slips. The\r\nfirst growth from these cuttings is called plant cane; after these\r\nare taken off the roots send out ratoons or shoots from which the\r\ncrop of one or two years, and sometimes longer, is taken. If the\r\nsoil is not rich and moist replanting is more frequently necessary\r\nand in places like Louisiana, where there is annual frost, planting\r\nmust be done each year. When the cane is ripe it is cut and brought\r\nfrom the field to a central sugar mill, where heavy iron rollers\r\ncrush from it all the juice. This liquid drips through into troughs\r\nfrom which it is carried to evaporators where the water portion of\r\nthe sap is eliminated and the juice left; you would be surprised if\r\nyou were to see this liquid. It looks like nothing so much as the\r\nsoapy, bluish-gray dish-water that is left in the pan after the\r\ndishes have been washed."\r\n\r\n"A tempting picture!" Van exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"I know it. Sugar isn\'t very attractive during its process of\r\npreparation," agreed Mr. Hennessey. "The sweet liquid left after the\r\nwater has been extracted is then poured into vacuum pans to be\r\nboiled until the crystals form in it, after which it is put into\r\nwhirling machines, called centrifugal machines, that separate the\r\ndry sugar from the syrup with which it is mixed. This syrup is later\r\nboiled into molasses. The sugar is then dried and packed in these\r\nburlap sacks such as you see here, or in hogsheads, and shipped to\r\nrefineries to be cleansed and whitened."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t any of the sugar refined in the places where it grows?"\r\nqueried Bob.\r\n\r\n"Practically none. Large refining plants are too expensive to be\r\nerected everywhere; it therefore seems better that they should be\r\nbuilt in our large cities, where the shipping facilities are good\r\nnot only for receiving sugar in its raw state but for distributing\r\nit after it has been refined and is ready for sale. Here, too,\r\nmachinery can more easily be bought and the business handled with\r\nless difficulty."\r\n\r\n"You spoke of a central sugar mill," began Bob.\r\n\r\n"Yes. Each plantation does not have a mill of its own or, indeed,\r\nneed one. Frequently a planter will raise too small a crop to pay\r\nhim to operate a mill; so a mill is constructed in the center of a\r\nsugar district, and to this growers may carry their wares and be\r\npaid in bulk. It saves much trouble and expense. It also encourages\r\nsmall growers who could not afford to build mills and might in\r\nconsequence abandon sugar raising. The leaves are all stripped off\r\nbefore the cane is shipped so that nothing but the stalks are sent.\r\nAs the largest portion of sugar is in the part of the cane nearest\r\nthe ground it is cut as close to the root as possible. After the\r\njuice has been crushed from the stalks by putting them several times\r\nthrough the rollers the cane, or _begass_, as it is called, is\r\nso dry that it can be used as fuel for running the mill machinery."\r\n\r\n"How clever!"\r\n\r\n"Clever and economical as well," agreed Mr. Hennessey. "Moreover, it\r\ndoes away with a waste product that otherwise would accumulate."\r\n\r\nBob nodded.\r\n\r\n"Raw sugar has usually been shipped to the northern refineries by\r\nwater, as that mode of transportation is cheaper; but during the\r\nGreat War ships have been so scarce that in 1916 a large consignment\r\nof Hawaiian sugar was for the first time sent overland across the\r\nAmerican continent by train; this of course made the freight rates\r\nhigher, and if such a condition were to continue the price of sugar\r\nwould of necessity have to be advanced."\r\n\r\n"I never thought of such things affecting us," murmured Van.\r\n\r\n"We live in a network of interdependence," Mr. Hennessey replied.\r\n"Scarcely anything can be done in any land that does not affect us.\r\nCommercial conditions react upon us all, for there is not one of us\r\nwho is not indebted to the four corners of the globe for what he\r\neats, wears, and uses. Therefore, you see, world prosperity and\r\ncomfort can be at their height only when there is world peace under\r\nwhich all nations are friends, maintaining cordial trade relation\r\nwith one another."\r\n\r\n"What political party do you belong to, Mr. Hennessey?" asked Bob,\r\nglancing into the superintendent\'s earnest face.\r\n\r\n"I do not know just what label you would put on me," the big man\r\nreplied evasively. "But this I do know: first, last, and all the\r\ntime I am for a universe where each country shall work for the good\r\nof the whole."\r\n\r\nHe spoke slowly and with impressiveness; then breaking off abruptly\r\nhe led the way up a winding iron staircase and the boys, still\r\npondering his words, followed him silently and thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nVAN SPRINGS A SURPRISE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe room into which they emerged was at the top of the factory, and\r\nit was here in great vats that the dry sugar was melted.\r\n\r\n"We often melt down as many as two million pounds of raw sugar a\r\nday," said Mr. Hennessey. "The United States, you know, is the\r\ngreatest sugar consuming nation in the world. No other country\r\ndevours so much of it. One reason is because here even the poorer\r\nclasses have money enough so they can afford sugar for household\r\nuse; in many countries this is not the case. Only the well-to-do\r\ntake sugar in tea or coffee and have it for common use. Our\r\nAmericans also eat quantities of candy. At the present time children\r\neat three times as many sweets as did their parents, and the amount\r\nis constantly increasing. Doctors tell us sugar is one of the fuels\r\nnecessary to the human system; it generates both heat and energy.\r\nPossibly it is because our people work so hard and are driven at\r\nsuch high nervous tension that they demand so much of this sort of\r\nfood."\r\n\r\n"I never knew before that candy was good for us," ejaculated Bob in\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n"Oh, bless you, yes! But you must take it in moderation if you wish\r\nto benefit from it and escape illness. Used intelligently sugar is\r\nan excellent food, but of course you must prescribe it for yourself\r\nin the proper proportions," laughed Mr. Hennessey. "We all\r\nconstantly take more or less sugar into our systems through the\r\nordinary foods we eat. But here in America over and above this each\r\nindividual annually averages about eighty pounds of sugar. You will\r\nagree that that is a good deal."\r\n\r\n"I should think so! Why, that is a tremendous amount!" Van declared.\r\n\r\n"It seems so when you see it in figures, doesn\'t it?" returned the\r\nsuperintendent. "Next to the United States in sugar consumption\r\ncomes England, the reason for this being that the English\r\nmanufacture such vast amounts of jam for the market. England is a\r\ngreat fruit growing country, you must remember. The damp, moderate\r\nclimate results in wonderful strawberries, gooseberries, plums, and\r\nother small fruits. With these products cheap, fine, and plenty, the\r\nEnglish have taken up fruit canning as one of their industries, and\r\nthey turn out some of the best jams and marmalades that are made."\r\n\r\nThe boys listened intently.\r\n\r\n"The Germans and the French are much more frugal than we Americans,"\r\nwent on Mr. Hennessey. "Sugar is not so common in their countries.\r\nOften when in Germany you will notice people in the restaurants and\r\ncaf\xc3\xa9s who carry away in their pockets the loaf sugar which has been\r\nallotted them and which they have not had occasion to use. It is a\r\ncommon occurrence, and considered quite proper, although it looks\r\nstrange to us. Doubtless, too, if you have traveled abroad you have\r\ndiscovered how few candy shops there are. Foreigners regard the\r\nwholesale fashion in which we devour sweets with wonder and often\r\nwith disgust. They consider it a form of self-indulgence, and indeed\r\nI myself think we are at times a bit immoderate."\r\n\r\n"My father says we are an immoderate people," Van put in.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid he is right," nodded Mr. Hennessey. "We seem to proceed\r\non the principle that if a thing is good we must have a great deal\r\nof it. However, the vice--if vice it be--is good for the sugar\r\nbusiness."\r\n\r\nHe paused a moment and stood looking down into the great foaming\r\nvats before him.\r\n\r\n"You can\'t see the steam coils that are melting this raw sugar," he\r\nremarked. "They go round the inside of the tanks. But after the\r\nliquid is drawn off you can see them. When first melted the sugar is\r\nfar from pure; you would be astonished at the amount of dirt mixed\r\nwith it. Many of these impurities boil up to the surface and over\r\nand over again we skim them off. But even after that we have to wash\r\nthe sugar by various processes. After it has been separated,\r\nclarified, and filtered it comes out a clear white liquid, and is\r\nready for the vacuum pans, where the water is evaporated and the\r\nsugar crystallized."\r\n\r\n"How do you get the liquid clear?" asked Bob.\r\n\r\n"After it has been skimmed as carefully as possible we first settle\r\nit through the agency of chemicals," answered Mr. Hennessey. "We use\r\nmilk of lime as a foundation, but we put other things with it. Our\r\nexact formula is a secret, but since you are in the family I guess\r\nthere would be no objection to my telling you that we use---"\r\n\r\n"Don\'t tell us! Don\'t tell us!" cried Van suddenly. "I don\'t want to\r\nknow. I\'d rather not. I mustn\'t listen."\r\n\r\nCovering his ears the boy turned away.\r\n\r\nHis companions regarded him with amazement.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t tell me, Mr. Hennessey," he pleaded. "Don\'t tell me anything\r\nthat is secret. I can\'t listen. It wouldn\'t be right."\r\n\r\nIt was evident both to the superintendent and to Bob that his\r\ndistress was real, and although neither of them understood it Mr.\r\nHennessey cut short his explanation.\r\n\r\nTry as they would the strange interruption left a jarring note\r\nbehind it, and to ease the tenseness the older man stepped forward\r\nand, taking from a rack near by one of several glass tubes filled\r\nwith yellow liquid, held it up to the light.\r\n\r\n"You see much must still be done to this stuff before it comes out\r\nwhite," he said. "We squeeze the liquid through a series of filter\r\nbags and also send it through other filters filled with black bone\r\ncoal."\r\n\r\n"What is black bone coal?" Bob demanded.\r\n\r\n"Bone coal is a product made by burning and pulverizing the large\r\nbones left at the abbatoirs until a coarse-grained black powder not\r\nunlike emery sand is made; if this is not allowed to become too fine\r\nwith using it is an excellent sugar filter. In fact, strangely\r\nenough, nothing has ever been found to take its place, and it has\r\nbecome a necessary but expensive agency employed in every sugar\r\nrefinery. Quantities of it are used; in our refinery alone we have\r\nabout a hundred bone coal filters and each one holds thirty tons of\r\nblack bone coal. That will give you some idea how much of it is\r\nneeded. We get nothing back on it, either, for in the process of\r\nusing it becomes finer, and after that it is good for nothing\r\nunless, perhaps, to be made into cheap shoe-dressing. Unlike many of\r\nthe other industries sugar refining has no by-products; by that I\r\nmean nothing on which the manufacturer may recover money. On the\r\ncontrary in the leather business, for example, almost every scrap of\r\nmaterial can either be utilized or sold for cash; odds and ends of\r\nthe hides go into glue stock, small bits of leather are made into\r\nheel-taps or hardware fittings. But in refining cane-sugar there is\r\nnothing to be turned back into money to reimburse the manufacturer\r\nfor his outlay. What isn\'t sugar is dead loss."\r\n\r\nThe three now moved on and saw how the heated juice traveled by\r\nmeans of pipes from one vat to another, and how it constantly became\r\nthicker and clearer.\r\n\r\n"One of the greatest dangers to successful sugar making is\r\nfermentation," observed Mr. Hennessey. "Sugar must continually be\r\nstirred by revolving paddles to keep it from fermenting; we also are\r\nobliged to take the greatest care that our vats and all other\r\nreceptacles are clean, and that the plant is immaculate. Frequently\r\nwe wash down all the walls with a solution of lime in order that the\r\nentire interior of the refinery may be quite fresh."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t dream it was so much work to make white sugar," ventured\r\nBob, a little awed. "Our maple-sugar making was much simpler."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll venture to say it was," agreed Mr. Hennessey. "In the first\r\nplace, you did not make such a quantity of it; then you did not try\r\nto get it white. Furthermore, you were content to take it in cakes.\r\nMaking cane-sugar is, however, easy enough if one is careful and\r\nknows the exact way to do it. There is plenty of opportunity to\r\nspoil it--I\'ll admit that; but it is seldom that a batch of our\r\nsugar goes back on us. We have fine chemists who watch every step of\r\nthe process and who constantly test samples of the liquid at every\r\nstage into which it passes until it comes out water-white."\r\n\r\n"And then?"\r\n\r\n"Then follows crystallization, and this too requires skilled workmen\r\nand extreme care. The water is evaporated and the sugar crystallized\r\nin the vacuum pans, the size crystal depending upon the temperature\r\nat which the liquid is boiled. It takes a lower temperature to form\r\na small crystal and a higher one to form a large crystal. An expert\r\nwho takes the temperature of the boiling sugar regulates what we\r\ncall fine-grain or coarse-grain sugar by regulating the size of the\r\ncrystals. By drawing off some of the liquid and examining it on a\r\nglass slide by electric light he can tell the precise moment at\r\nwhich the crystals are the right size. Each size has a name by which\r\nit is known in the trade: Diamond A; Fine Granulated; Coarse\r\nGranulated; Crystal Domino; Confectioners\' A and so on."\r\n\r\nThey were walking as Mr. Hennessey talked. "After the sugar has been\r\ncrystallized in the pans it passes into a mixer, where it is stirred\r\nand kept from caking until it is put into the centrifugal machines,\r\nwhich actually spin off the crystals. These machines are lined with\r\ngauze, and as they whirl at tremendous velocity they force out\r\nthrough this gauze the liquid part of the sugar and leave the sugar\r\ncrystals inside the machine. When these are quite dry the bottom of\r\nthe receptacle opens, and the granular sugar is dropped through into\r\na large bin."\r\n\r\n"But I should think it would stick together," objected Van.\r\n\r\n"That\'s an intelligent objection, my boy," declared Mr. Hennessey,\r\nmuch pleased at Van\'s grasp of the subject. "It would stick if it\r\nwere not dried off by a degree of heat just right to keep the\r\nparticles separate and not allow them to cake. After this any dust\r\nor dirt adhering to the sugar is blown off by an air blast. The\r\nproduct is then ready to be pressed into moulds or cut; boxed in\r\nsmall packages of varying weights; or put into bags or barrels."\r\n\r\nMr. Hennessey led the way to another floor of the refinery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "I SHOULD THINK IT WOULD STICK TOGETHER."]\r\n\r\nHere were automatic machines upon which empty boxes traveled along\r\nuntil they reached a device that filled each one with the exact\r\nnumber of pounds to be contained in it, the package afterward passed\r\nto women who sealed it tightly and gave it the final touch before it\r\nwas shipped. Other women were packing loaf or domino sugar, while\r\ndown-stairs in a cooper shop men moved about constructing with great\r\nrapidity the barrels that were to carry larger quantities of sugar\r\nto the wholesale and retail stores.\r\n\r\n"I guess by this time you\'ve had all the sugar-making you want for\r\none day," declared the superintendent. "I\'m afraid I\'ve given you\r\nquite a stiff lesson. You see I am so interested in it myself that\r\nI forget to have mercy on my listeners."\r\n\r\nHe smiled down at the boys.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sure we have had a fine morning with you, Mr. Hennessey, and we\r\ncertainly have learned a lot," Bob said, putting out his hand. "I\r\ncan\'t swear, though, that we could make white sugar even now."\r\n\r\n"Faith, I\'d be sorry if I thought I could teach any one the whole\r\nprocess in three hours. It would make my twenty years of study and\r\nhard work brand me as pretty stupid," chuckled the big\r\nsuperintendent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nA FAMILY TANGLE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not until the boys were in the motor-car and returning home\r\nthat Bob ventured to mention to Van his strange behavior of the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\n"What on earth was the matter with you, Van?" he asked.\r\n\r\nVan stirred uneasily.\r\n\r\n"Bobbie," he said, "I\'m going to tell you something. I\'ve been\r\nwondering whether I\'d better or not, and at last I\'ve decided to. I\r\ndidn\'t want to go to your father\'s refinery to-day or, in fact, at\r\nall. You\'ve all been very kind to me, although it was not until I\r\ngot a letter from my father this morning that I realized how kind."\r\n\r\nHe paused.\r\n\r\n"Has your dad told you anything about my people?" he asked abruptly.\r\n"Of course he knows, but he may have thought best to keep it to\r\nhimself; at any rate it has not prevented him from giving me as\r\ncordial a welcome to your home as he would if--"\r\n\r\n"If what?"\r\n\r\n"Well, if I weren\'t the person I am."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?"\r\n\r\n"Why, he\'s trusted me and treated me as if he really liked me; and\r\nyet under the circumstances you can\'t expect him actually to mean\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Mean what? What are you talking about?"\r\n\r\n"Hasn\'t he spoken to you about my father?"\r\n\r\n"Of course not; why should he?"\r\n\r\n"Then you haven\'t heard anything?"\r\n\r\n"Not a word. I don\'t understand what you are driving at at all," Bob\r\ndeclared, somewhat irritated. "Out with it. What\'s the matter?"\r\n\r\nVan hesitated as if uncertain how to begin.\r\n\r\n"That\'s mighty white of your father," he murmured, breaking the\r\npause. "You see, it is this way. When I wrote home that I was going\r\nto New Hampshire to visit my roommate the family wrote me to go\r\nahead. I recall now that I didn\'t mention your last name; in fact I\r\nguess I haven\'t in any of my letters. When I did happen to write\r\n(which wasn\'t often) I\'ve always spoken of you as _Bob_. So\r\nwhen I got to Allenville I dropped a line to Father to say I\'d\r\narrived safely and in the note I put something about Mr. Carlton.\r\nFather lit on it right away; he wished to know who these Carltons\r\nwere. I replied they were Mr. and Mrs. Carlton, of course--the\r\nparents of my roommate. Upon that I got another letter from home in\r\nwhich Father inquired if your father was in the sugar business, and\r\nsaid that years ago he used to have a partner named James Carlton,\r\nwho started in the sugar trade with him and with whom he later\r\nquarreled. He supposed this could not be the same person, but he\r\njust wondered if by any chance it was."\r\n\r\nVan stopped.\r\n\r\n"Was that all he said?"\r\n\r\n"No, but I don\'t like to tell you the rest, Bobbie."\r\n\r\n"Fire away--unless it is something about Dad," Bob replied. "If it\r\nis I shan\'t listen, or at least I shan\'t believe it."\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t exactly against your father. I do not understand it very\r\nwell myself. My father just said that if your father was Mr. James\r\nCarlton and he was in the sugar business he felt that because of\r\nfamily misunderstandings it would be better if I did not visit here\r\nagain. He was very sorry I had done it this time, but of course that\r\ncould not be helped now."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean to say he wants you to break off your friendship\r\nwith me?" Bob gasped tremulously.\r\n\r\n"No, he didn\'t seem to be opposed to you; he just was hot at your\r\ndad. He added that he didn\'t believe your family could have known\r\nwho I was when they asked me here, and I am afraid that\'s true,\r\nBobbie."\r\n\r\n"Why, of course they knew! Haven\'t I spoken of you over and over\r\nagain?" Bob protested indignantly.\r\n\r\nVan shook his head.\r\n\r\n"They knew I was your chum all right, Bob; but so far as details\r\nwere concerned your family did not know much more about me than mine\r\nknew about you. Don\'t you recall how, when I arrived at Allenville,\r\nyour father asked if I was one of the _Sugar Blakes_--Asa\r\nBlake\'s son?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I do remember that now, but--"\r\n\r\n"That, you will recollect, was after I was landed at Allenville and\r\nyour guest. Your father didn\'t know until that moment who I was, and\r\nwhen he found out he was too decent to say anything, or make it\r\nevident he didn\'t want me in the house. What could he do?"\r\n\r\n"But--but--"\r\n\r\nBob broke off from sheer inability to continue. He was much too\r\nbewildered.\r\n\r\n"Your father sensed the awkwardness of the situation at once. Here\r\nyou had gone to school and as ill luck would have it you had picked\r\nfrom out the entire bunch of boys the son of his worst enemy for a\r\nchum. Neither your father nor mine realized the truth until you\r\ninnocently carted me home with you for a holiday visit. When your\r\nfather found out the fact he was too polite to turn me out-of-doors;\r\nhe just acted the gentleman and made the best of a bad dilemma,"\r\nexplained Van with appalling convincingness. "He even had the\r\ngoodness to save my life the day we got lost on one of your New\r\nHampshire mountains. He didn\'t tell you any of this because he\r\ndidn\'t want to spoil your pleasure; but I am certain that if he had\r\nknown who I was before I came he would not have allowed you to ask\r\nme into your home."\r\n\r\n"Nonsense! You are way off. Why, he\'s been as interested in having\r\nyou with us as I have; at least he has acted so."\r\n\r\n"_Acted_ is just the word," Van cut in. "He has acted, all\r\nright. I guess you\'ll find he\'s been acting all the time. Honor\r\nbright, hasn\'t he said anything to you about me?"\r\n\r\n"No, not one word." Then suddenly Bob flushed; the memory of his\r\nfather\'s strange conversation about the boy\'s visit to the refinery\r\nrushed over him. "Dad did say one thing which I did not understand\r\nat the time," he confessed reluctantly. "Perhaps, though, he did not\r\nmean anything by it."\r\n\r\n"What was it?"\r\n\r\nBob struggled to evade the issue.\r\n\r\n"Oh, it was nothing much."\r\n\r\n"Come, Bobbie, you and I are friends," interrupted Van, "and we want\r\nto keep on being friends no matter how our fathers feel toward one\r\nanother. If they have quarreled it is a great pity, but at least we\r\nneedn\'t. The only way to straighten out this tangle is to be honest\r\nwith each other and get at the truth; then, and not until then shall\r\nwe know where we stand."\r\n\r\n"You\'re a brick, Van!"\r\n\r\n"Come ahead then--let\'s have it. What was it your father said?"\r\n\r\n"He merely asked whether it was your plan or mine to visit the\r\nrefinery, and when I told him I suggested it he inquired all over\r\nagain if I was sure you did not mention it first," Bob returned in\r\nvery low tone. The words seemed wrung from him, and he colored as he\r\nrepeated them.\r\n\r\n"Was that all?"\r\n\r\n"Not quite. After I had convinced him that the trip was my own idea\r\nhe said: \'_Well, well--it can do no harm; the process is an open\r\nsecret, anyway._\'"\r\n\r\n"You see I was right in my guess as to his feelings, Bobbie."\r\n\r\n"Maybe."\r\n\r\n"Of course I was; this proves it."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid so," whispered Bob miserably.\r\n\r\n"Now all this may explain to you why I was so queer when we were at\r\nthe refinery this morning," Van continued, once more reverting to\r\nthe subject. "Do you understand it any better?"\r\n\r\n"I can see you didn\'t want Mr. Hennessey to tell you much about his\r\nprocesses."\r\n\r\n"You bet I didn\'t. I was in an awful hole. I got that letter from my\r\nfather just before we left the house, and I was all upset over it.\r\nI didn\'t know what to do. It was bad enough to be visiting you without\r\nbeing shown all through your father\'s business plant as if I were an\r\nhonored guest. It didn\'t seem as if I ought to go at all. If your\r\nfather knew who I was he certainly couldn\'t want me to; and if he\r\ndidn\'t it was worse yet. At first I thought the only honorable thing\r\nwas to go straight to him and have it out; but I found I hadn\'t the\r\nnerve. Then I thought I\'d ride with you to the factory and not go\r\nin. What I dreaded was that we might run into something that I\r\nshould have no right to see, and that was precisely what happened."\r\n\r\n"So that was the reason you stopped Mr. Hennessey when he started to\r\ntell us the chemical formula?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. He said it was a secret, and it seemed to me it would be wrong\r\nfor me to listen. If I didn\'t know what that formula was I certainly\r\ncouldn\'t tell it, and ignorance might help me out of an awkward\r\nposition if any one should try to persuade me to."\r\n\r\n"You are a trump, old man."\r\n\r\n"It was only the square thing toward your father; he has been\r\nstraight with me and I want to show him that I can be a gentleman,\r\ntoo."\r\n\r\nThe boys were silent for an interval; then Bob said:\r\n\r\n"Now about this snarl, Van--what are we going to do? Certainly we\r\nfellows are not going to let this feud of our fathers affect us."\r\n\r\n"Not by a jugful!" retorted Van with spirit. "The thing for us to do\r\nis to go right on being friends as if nothing had happened. It will\r\nmake it all the easier that your father knows just who I am, and my\r\nfather knows exactly who you are; it is franker and more in the open\r\nto have it so. If worse comes to worse we can talk the whole thing\r\nout with our families, and tell them how we feel. I am sure both\r\nyour father and mine are too big to spoil a friendship like ours\r\nbecause of some fuss they had years and years ago. No, sir! I\'m\r\ngoing to hold on to you, Bobbie, and," he added shyly, "I\'m going to\r\nhold on to your father, too, if he\'ll let me, for I like him."\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad you like Dad," Bob said, flushing with pleasure. "I do\r\nmyself."\r\n\r\n"My dad isn\'t so bad, either," Van ventured with a dry little smile.\r\n"Some time you shall see for yourself."\r\n\r\n"I hope so."\r\n\r\n"Then it is agreed that we\'ll stick together, no matter what\r\nhappens," said Van solemnly.\r\n\r\n"Sure thing!"\r\n\r\n"Promise."\r\n\r\n"You may bank on me," was Bob\'s earnest answer.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nMR. CARLTON MAKES A WAGER AND WINS\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the boys sat at dinner that evening Mr. Carlton inquired about\r\ntheir trip to the refinery, and with a humorous twinkle in his eye\r\nadded:\r\n\r\n"I do not suppose you would care to put in another day on factory\r\nvisiting, would you?"\r\n\r\n"What do you mean, Dad?" asked Bob.\r\n\r\n"I was wondering whether you would like to see where some of our\r\nsugar goes," was his father\'s answer. "Would you be interested to\r\ntake a tour through the Eureka Candy Factory to-morrow and learn how\r\ncandy is made?"\r\n\r\n"I should," responded Bob promptly.\r\n\r\n"And you, Van?" demanded Mr. Carlton with a kindly smile.\r\n\r\n"I\'d like it of all things," said Van, returning the smile frankly.\r\n\r\n"Very well. You shall spend to-morrow at the Eureka Company\'s\r\nfactory. They are big customers of ours and when I telephoned them\r\ntoday they told me they would be glad to have you come, and promised\r\nto show you all about."\r\n\r\n"Are you sure they would want me to come, Mr. Carlton?" asked Van,\r\nlooking squarely into the eyes of the older man.\r\n\r\n"Why not? You\'re a chum of Bob\'s, aren\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. But, you see, that isn\'t all."\r\n\r\nWith one searching glance Mr. Carlton scanned the lad\'s face.\r\n\r\n"No, Van," he replied with quiet emphasis, "that is not all. You are\r\nmore than Bob\'s chum--you are a friend of mine, too."\r\n\r\nThe boy flushed.\r\n\r\n"I\'d like to think so, Mr. Carlton."\r\n\r\n"I want you to know so, Van. I happened to see Mr. Hennessey," he\r\nwent on in a lower tone, "and he related to me that incident at the\r\nfactory. Of course he did not understand it, but I did--instantly.\r\nI appreciated your sense of honor, my boy."\r\n\r\n"I wanted to be square."\r\n\r\n"You were a gentleman in the very best sense of the word."\r\n\r\nA great gladness glowed in Van\'s eyes, for terse as was the phrase\r\nit bore to him the very recognition he had coveted from Bob\'s\r\nfather. Mr. Carlton, however, did not enlarge upon the subject, but\r\ncasting it swiftly into the background asked:\r\n\r\n"Are you sure you both would rather spend your last morning in New\r\nYork going through a candy factory than doing anything else?\r\nFactories are tiresome places, you must remember."\r\n\r\n"But a candy factory could never be tiresome!" asserted Bob.\r\n\r\nHis father laughed.\r\n\r\n"There are just as many miles in a candy factory as any other," he\r\nreplied. "Any of the men who work there would tell you that, I\r\nfancy."\r\n\r\n"But they are such nice miles!" argued Bob. "Don\'t you say we go,\r\nVan?"\r\n\r\n"I sure do. I want to see how they dip chocolates," Van answered.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all aboard to-morrow morning, then," Mr. Carlton said as he\r\nlit his after-dinner cigar.\r\n\r\n"There\'s one thing, Dad, that it\'s only fair to warn you about,"\r\ncalled Bob, turning on the lowest step of the stairway to address\r\nhis father. "Our expedition may cost you something. You see they\r\nprobably won\'t let us eat any candy at the factory; we\'ll just have\r\nto walk round with our eyes open and our hands crammed into our\r\npockets to keep from swiping it. All the time we\'ll be getting up a\r\ntremendous candy appetite, and the minute we get outside we\'ll just\r\nhave to make a bee-line for the first candy shop in sight and get\r\nfilled up. So you must be prepared to cash in for refreshments."\r\n\r\nThe corners of Mr. Carlton\'s mouth twisted into an enigmatic smile.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll agree to pay for as much candy as you care to eat," he said,\r\naccepting the challenge without objection.\r\n\r\nBob stared at him.\r\n\r\n"Do you mean it?"\r\n\r\n"Certainly. Why do you question it?"\r\n\r\n"But"--faltered Bob in amazement, "you never promised anything like\r\nthat before."\r\n\r\n"I may never promise it again, so make the most of it," was the dry\r\nretort.\r\n\r\nAlthough Bob did not reply he by no means forgot the unprecedented\r\noffer, and that the memory of it might be equally fresh in his\r\nfather\'s mind he spoke of it once again when the three parted the\r\nnext morning.\r\n\r\n"Well, Dad, we\'re off for the Bonbon World," he called as he passed\r\nthe library door where his father sat looking over the morning\'s\r\nmail. "Remember you are going to O.K. any candy bills we run up."\r\n\r\n"I\'m backing you for all you can eat," nodded Mr. Carlton.\r\n\r\n"Dad sure is game!" Bob declared as he and Van stepped into the\r\nwaiting motor-car and began their ride to the factory. "He\'ll play\r\nit out, too. He never goes back on his word."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid he\'ll be in for something then," grinned Van.\r\n\r\nBoth boys were more than ever convinced of the truth of this remark\r\nwhen they entered the factory and were greeted by the mingled aroma\r\nof chocolate, wintergreen and molasses.\r\n\r\n"I could eat ten pounds of chocolates this minute!" exclaimed Van.\r\n\r\n"Go easy. Remember, we\'ve got to wait until we have made the entire\r\ntour of this factory before we can have so much as a single caramel.\r\nYou mustn\'t go getting up your appetite so soon."\r\n\r\n"But smell it, Bobbie! Why, the whole place is one mellifluous\r\nsmudge. What do you say we chuck Colversham and get a job here?\r\nThink of having pounds of candy--tons of it--around all the time!\r\nWouldn\'t it be a snap!"\r\n\r\nVan was cut short in his rhapsody by the approach of a pleasant\r\nfaced lad of about his own age who was dressed from head to foot in\r\nwhite and wore a little white cap, across the front of which was\r\nprinted in gold letters the word _Eureka_.\r\n\r\n"Are you Mr. Carlton?" he inquired of Van.\r\n\r\n"I\'m not, but my chum is."\r\n\r\n"We were expecting you," the boy answered, turning to Bob. "I am to\r\nshow you and your friend through the works. Will you kindly step\r\nthis way?"\r\n\r\nTagging at the heels of their white-robed guide Bob and Van made\r\ntheir way through a large storeroom stacked to the ceiling with\r\nfancy boxes of various sizes, shapes, and colors.\r\n\r\n"Give up Colversham, Bob, and maybe you could come here and wear a\r\nwhite suit every day and personally conduct visitors through the\r\nworks; perhaps they\'d even pay you in bonbons," whispered Van.\r\n\r\n"He must be about our age," returned Bob. "I wonder what they pay\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n"I\'d lots rather have had a man take us round," said Van softly. "Do\r\nyou suppose this fellow knows anything?"\r\n\r\nAll the way up in the elevator the two visitors watched the white-suited\r\nboy curiously and when they alighted in the large, sun-flooded room\r\nat the top of the factory they were still speculating as to his age\r\nand how much he earned, and marveling that so young a representative\r\nshould have been selected to explain to them the candy industry.\r\n\r\nThe room they entered was high and airy and at the further end of\r\nit, moving amid steam that rose from a score of copper kettles, a\r\ngreat many men in spotless white were hurrying about.\r\n\r\n"It is here that we start our candy making," said the boy who was\r\nshowing Bob about. "Into those copper kettles we put our mixture of\r\nconfectioners\' sugar--confectioners\' A, we call it--and corn syrup;\r\nthis combination forms the basis of almost every variety of candy\r\nmade. The kettles, as you will see, are heated by gas, which gives\r\na steady flame, and at the side of each one we have a thermometer by\r\nwhich we can tell the exact temperature of the mixture. There is\r\nalso a glass disc set in the side of every kettle to enable us to\r\nwatch the boiling. The sugar and corn syrup are melted together and\r\ncooked at the temperature which after repeated experiments has\r\nproved the most successful for our purpose--one that will neither\r\nburn nor stick, or make the cooled fondant too thin to keep its\r\nshape."\r\n\r\nThe boy spoke in the slow, measured tones of one who had told the\r\ntale many times before and was quite accustomed to his task.\r\n\r\nBob glanced at Van.\r\n\r\nTheir respect for the lad was rising.\r\n\r\n"How much does one of these kettles hold?" Bob asked.\r\n\r\n"About six hundred pounds."\r\n\r\n"And you fill all of them every day?" demanded Van in astonishment.\r\n\r\n"Several times over," was the answer. "It takes a lot of this ground\r\nmaterial for the different kinds; some of it has other ingredients\r\nmixed with it later, and some is beaten, flavored, and colored for\r\nthe fillings of chocolates."\r\n\r\n"But who on earth eats so much candy?" ejaculated Bob.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know," responded the boy wearily. "I\'m sure I don\'t."\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe I\'d touch a piece of candy for a hundred dollars,"\r\nhe continued. "I am sick of the sight of it. Candy from morning to\r\nnight--candy, candy, candy! Candy everywhere! Nothing but candy."\r\n\r\nBob and Van eyed him unbelievingly.\r\n\r\nCould a boy be human and feel that way?\r\n\r\n"Everybody here gets into the same state of mind," the lad went on.\r\n"When the green hands come they are crazy about the stuff for about\r\na couple of days; then it is all over. You couldn\'t hire them to\r\neat. Every few weeks the different employees are allowed to buy two\r\npounds for themselves at the wholesale price, but you would be\r\nsurprised to see how few of them do it. If they get it you can be\r\npretty certain that it is to give away, for they\'d never eat it\r\nthemselves."\r\n\r\nHis two listeners stared incredulously.\r\n\r\nTheir guide led them across the room.\r\n\r\n"So," said he, reverting once more to the kettles and the\r\nthermometer, "our candy is not made by guesswork, you see. Sugar\r\ncosts too much to risk having such a large batch as a kettleful\r\nspoiled. We boil it by the thermometer, and when it is at just the\r\nright point we take it off and put it into these coolers, where it\r\nthickens and is reduced to a workable temperature. That which is to\r\nbe used as filling is then shifted into these big cylindrical cans\r\nthat have inside them a series of revolving fingers and here the\r\ncandy is beaten until quite smooth; whatever flavoring or coloring\r\nmatter is needed is beaten into it."\r\n\r\nAs the machinery whirled the boys stood watching the beaters.\r\n\r\n"Some of this beaten sugar will be colored pink, flavored with rose\r\nor wintergreen, and used for the centers of chocolate; some will\r\nhave maple flavoring, some vanilla, some lemon. Nuts will be stirred\r\ninto some of the rest of it. There is an almost endless number of\r\nways in which it may be varied. Come over here and see them\r\npreparing the centers and getting them ready to cover with\r\nchocolate."\r\n\r\nIt was an interesting process.\r\n\r\nShallow wooden trays filled with dry corn-starch passed beneath a\r\nmachine which left in them rows of empty holes the size of the heart\r\nof a chocolate cream. The trays then moved on until they stopped\r\njust under a nozzle, which ran exactly the right amount of liquid\r\nfilling into each hole. The dryness of the corn-starch prevented the\r\nmixture from flowing together. As soon as every hole in the tray was\r\nfilled with fondant it was set away to cool and an empty tray\r\nsubstituted. When the little centers were hard enough they were\r\ntaken out of the corn-starch moulds, and after being put upon\r\ntraveling strips of fine wire netting, melted chocolate was poured\r\nover them. The wire frames sped along like miniature moving\r\nsidewalks, their contents drying and cooling on the way. In the\r\nmeantime the superfluous chocolate dripped through the netting into\r\na trough beneath and was collected to be melted over again. On went\r\nthe finished chocolates until they reached the packing-room, where\r\ngirls removed them from the frames, sorted them, and put them into\r\nboxes.\r\n\r\n"These are not what is known as hand-dipped or fork-dipped\r\nchocolates," explained the boy. "Those are higher priced, because\r\nthey require individual attention, and the material put into them is\r\nmore expensive. To make those the girls take the centers and\r\nsubmerge each one in melted chocolate with a dipping-fork, finishing\r\nthe pieces with a certain little twist or decoration on top; it\r\nrequires no small amount of skill to make this top-knot, which not\r\nonly serves to render the candy more attractive but to distinguish\r\none variety of filling from another. Each kind has its own\r\nparticular decoration. After some practice any of us might, I\r\nsuppose, learn to make the twist on a chocolate once; but to make\r\nthat precise thing each time and never vary it would be quite a\r\ndifferent matter. It is important the pattern should be uniform,\r\nsince both the dippers and the packers must know what is inside; in\r\naddition those who sell the candy must know. It is no easy task.\r\nAfter the chocolates are finished _Eureka_ is stamped on the\r\nbottom of every piece and they are ready to be sold."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see what prevents your candy from sticking to everything,"\r\nobserved Van thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "IT IS NO EASY TASK"]\r\n\r\n"Blasts of cool air that come through those overhead pipes. We can\r\nturn on the current whenever we wish. Whenever the girls who are\r\npacking candy find that it is becoming soft they turn on a current\r\nof cold air to chill and harden it; we often use these cool blasts,\r\ntoo, when handling candies in the process of making. Such kinds as\r\nbutter-scotch, hoarhound, and the pretty twisted varieties stick\r\ntogether very easily. If they are allowed to become lumpy or marred\r\nthey are useless for the trade and have to be melted over."\r\n\r\n"What are those men over there doing?" inquired Bob, pointing to a\r\ngroup of workmen who were stirring a seething mixture of nuts and\r\nmolasses.\r\n\r\n"Some of them are making peanut brittle, some caramels; and in the\r\nlast kettle I believe they are boiling hoarhound candy. See! The\r\nlast man is ready to empty his upon the table. Suppose we go over\r\nand watch him."\r\n\r\nThey reached the spot just in time to see the kettle lifted and the\r\nhot candy poured out upon the metal top of the table, where it\r\nspread itself like a small, irregular pond. At once the workman in\r\ncharge took up a steel bar not unlike a metal yardstick and began\r\npressing down the mass to a uniform thickness. This done he ran the\r\nbar deftly beneath and turned the vast piece over just as one would\r\nflop over some gigantic griddle-cake. He continued to change it from\r\nside to side, pressing it down in any spot where it was too thick,\r\nbut never once touching it with his hands. He then cut off a long\r\nnarrow strip and fed it into a machine at his elbow, the boys\r\nregarding him expectantly. Suddenly, to their great surprise, the\r\nformless ribbon of candy that had gone into the machine began to\r\ncome forth at the other end in prettily marked discs, each with the\r\nfirm name stamped upon it.\r\n\r\n"Hoarhound tablets, you see," observed the boy. "The Italian who is\r\nmaking peanut brittle has flattened his on the table in the same\r\nfashion and marked it into bars which later will be cut and wrapped\r\nin paraffine paper."\r\n\r\n"I never realized so much candy was manufactured in one day,"\r\nexclaimed Bob as they went down in the elevator.\r\n\r\n"Oh, this isn\'t much," returned the boy. "We are running light just\r\nnow. You should come a few weeks before Christmas if you want to see\r\nthings hum here."\r\n\r\n"I guess that would be a good time for visitors to keep out,"\r\nreturned Bob as they smilingly bade good-bye to their guide and\r\nstarted home in the motor-car.\r\n\r\nAs the automobile glided into Fifth Avenue Van said:\r\n\r\n"Look, Bobbie, there\'s a candy shop! I suppose all that stuff in the\r\nwindow was made in exactly the same way as those things we saw to-day,\r\ndon\'t you?"\r\n\r\nBut Bob did not turn his head.\r\n\r\nInstead he replied:\r\n\r\n"Don\'t say candy to me. I do not want to lay eyes on another piece\r\nof it for a week!"\r\n\r\n"Nor I!" Van echoed. "Do you wonder that boy at the factory feels as\r\nhe does? I guess your father can keep his money so far as we are\r\nconcerned. He\'ll have no candy bills from us."\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Mr. Carlton waited for the tremendous bonbon bill\r\nthat had threatened to reduce his bank account, and when it was not\r\nforthcoming he nodded his head and chuckled quietly to himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nVAN MUTINIES\r\n\r\n\r\nAnother day passed and Bob and Van were once more back at Colversham\r\ngreeting the boys and vainly endeavoring to settle down to the work\r\nof the last term.\r\n\r\n"It seems as if the stretch from April to June is about the hardest\r\npull of the whole year," yawned Van, looking up for the twentieth\r\ntime from his Latin lesson and gazing out into the sunny campus.\r\n"Studying is bad enough at best, but when the trout brooks begin to\r\nrun and the canoeing is good it is a deadly proposition to be cooped\r\nup in this room hammering away for the finals."\r\n\r\n"It always seems worse after a vacation," agreed Bob, tilting back\r\nin his chair. "You\'ll get back into the harness, though, in a day or\r\ntwo; you know you always yap just about so much when you first get\r\nback to school."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t yap, as you call it, any worse than most fellows do. I hate\r\nbeing tied up like a pup on a leash. It seems as if I\'d just have to\r\nget out and play ball--and if you were a human being you\'d want to,\r\ntoo," growled Van.\r\n\r\n"Hang it all, don\'t you suppose I want to?" Bob retorted. "What do\r\nyou think I\'m made of, anyway?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know, Bobbie. Sometimes you\'re so resigned I begin to fear\r\nyou are a mummy," was Van\'s laughing retort. "Now, I\'m not like\r\nthat. It is one big grind for me to study. The minute spring comes\r\nit seems as if I never could translate another line of Cicero as\r\nlong as I lived, and I don\'t care a hurray what X equals. What will\r\nit matter a hundred years hence whether we plug away here at this\r\nstuff, or get out and play ball?"\r\n\r\n"I guess you\'d find it would matter to you right now without waiting\r\nfor the end of a century," was the laconic answer. "But speaking of\r\nball, what wouldn\'t you give to see the first League game of the\r\nseason in town, Saturday? That will be some playing!"\r\n\r\n"I clean forgot the season opened this week," exclaimed Van. "Since\r\nI got back here I\'ve been all mixed up on dates. I thought it was\r\nnext week. Are you sure it\'s Saturday?"\r\n\r\nBob nodded.\r\n\r\n"Positive."\r\n\r\n"It\'ll be a cracker-jack game," mused Van. "I\'d give something to be\r\nthere. You don\'t suppose we could get off at noon and go, do you?"\r\n\r\n"Not on your life! Right now, after vacation? What do you take this\r\nschool faculty for--an entertainment committee? You seem to forget\r\nwe\'d have to cut algebra, and English, and gym."\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t care."\r\n\r\n"I should. I\'m working this trip, and can\'t afford to miss\r\nrecitations," was Bob\'s sharp reply. "As for you, you can afford to\r\nmiss them even less than I can--you know that. Put it out of your\r\nhead. When you can\'t do a thing there is no use thinking about it\r\nand wishing you could."\r\n\r\n"I see no earthly harm in talking about it."\r\n\r\n"I do. It just keeps you stirred up."\r\n\r\n"Then what did you mention it for in the beginning?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. I wish to goodness I hadn\'t," Bob declared.\r\n\r\n"Well, in spite of your opinions I repeat I\'d give a fiver to see\r\nthat game Saturday."\r\n\r\n"You can\'t, so cut it out and let me finish this theme. Every time\r\nI\'ve started to write you\'ve broken in and driven every blooming\r\nidea out of my head. Now quit it. You better pitch into your own\r\nwork for to-morrow. Dig out all the Cicero you can, and later I\'ll\r\nhelp you with the rest."\r\n\r\nWith finality Bob wheeled his chair around and proceeded to submerge\r\nhimself in his task.\r\n\r\nBut not so Van. He took up his book, to be sure, but over the top of\r\nit his eyes roved to the world outside, and fixed themselves\r\ndreamily on the line of hills that peeped above the tips of the red\r\nmaples budding in the school campus. He was far away from Colversham\r\nand its round of duties. In imagination he moved with a gay, eager\r\ncrowd through the gateway leading into the great city ball ground.\r\nHe could hear the game called; watch the first swirl of the ball as\r\nit curved from the pitcher\'s hand; catch the sharp click of the bat\r\nagainst it; and join in the roar of applause as the swift-footed\r\nrunner sped to second base.\r\n\r\nEverybody would be at that opening game!\r\n\r\nNot to go when it was within trolley distance was absurd.\r\n\r\nWhat was algebra, English, or a little wall-scaling compared to such\r\nan opportunity?\r\n\r\nAnd, anyway, who would be the wiser?\r\n\r\nThere must be ways of getting off so nobody, not even Bob, would\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nIf only Bob could be persuaded to cut school!\r\n\r\nBut it was never any use to urge Bob when he spoke in that horribly\r\npositive tone. You might just as well try to move a lighthouse.\r\n\r\nVan glanced furtively at his chum who, unconscious of his scrutiny,\r\nwas writing steadily down a long page of foolscap. The sight had a\r\nsteadying effect. Van again took up his book and scowled once more\r\nat that same old line at the top of the page. But all the time\r\nbetween his eyes and his Latin lesson swayed that alluring throng of\r\npleasure seekers. Impatiently he tried to banish them, but stern as\r\nwas his attempt their laughter still sounded in his ears. Against\r\nhis will he was back at the ball game, and this time he was on his\r\nfeet shouting wildly with the other fans as Carruth, the star\r\nbatter, made a soaring hit and stole two bases on it. In that\r\ninstant of unreined enthusiasm Van Blake decided that come what\r\nmight he would go to the game on Saturday--go even though his whole\r\nterm\'s work went for naught.\r\n\r\nThe resolve made he tried to stifle his conscience by falling upon\r\nhis Latin with unwonted zeal, and so ardently did he wrestle with it\r\nthat when, an hour later, Bob pushed aside his papers and offered to\r\nhelp him with the lesson he was able to greet his chum with a\r\ntranslation so far beyond his customary efforts that Bob patted him\r\non the head with paternal pride, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n"Bully for you, old man! That\'s about the best work I ever knew of\r\nyour doing. The middle of it is a little queer, but we\'ll fix that\r\nup all right. Who says you\'re not a Cicero?"\r\n\r\n"Bobbie, if I thought for one moment that there was any danger of my\r\nbecoming a Cicero or any other Latin worthy I\'d go drown myself!"\r\nVan cried, startled at the mere thought. "I\'m not so worse, though,\r\nam I? I\'d no idea I could reel it off like that."\r\n\r\n"Of course you can do it. Why, Van, you could do all kinds of things\r\nif you\'d only go at them. The trouble with you is that you always\r\nstudy with one eye out the window. If you\'d only get down to your\r\njob with all your might you\'d not only get your lessons better but\r\nyou\'d learn them in half the time."\r\n\r\n"I \'spect that\'s so," drawled Van lazily. "I ought to duff right in\r\non all fours. I acknowledge it. But it is not so easy to make your\r\nmind go where you send it."\r\n\r\nHe broke off, shifting the subject to athletics, and was in the\r\nhighest spirits the rest of the day; but underneath all his fun and\r\nbanter the question constantly arose in his inner consciousness: How\r\ncould he elude his roommate\'s watchfulness and on the coming\r\nSaturday escape to the great game?\r\n\r\nStrangely enough Fortune seemed to smile upon his plot, for Friday\r\nmorning Bob was taken to the infirmary with a sore throat, which,\r\nalthough slight, isolated him from the rest of the boys. No longer\r\nwas he at Van\'s elbow to watch, warn, or censure.\r\n\r\nThe coast was entirely clear.\r\n\r\nVan formulated his plans.\r\n\r\nDirectly after luncheon on Saturday he would start for the city,\r\nhugging the edge of the campus and afterward cutting across the\r\nadjoining estate to meet the car line where it forked into the main\r\nroad. Many another boy had done the same and not been caught; why\r\nnot he? It was, to be sure, against the rules to leave the school\r\ngrounds without permission, but one must take a chance now and then.\r\nDid not half the spice of life lay in risks?\r\n\r\nAccordingly after the noonday meal was finished and the boys had\r\nscattered to recitations or the dormitories Van sauntered idly out\r\npast the tennis-courts; across the field skirting the golf course\r\nand then with one sudden plunge was behind the gymnasium and running\r\nlike a deer for the thicket that separated Colversham from the\r\nSawyer estate. He knew the lay of the land perfectly, for this short\r\ncut was a favorite thoroughfare of the boys, in spite of the posted\r\nprotest of _No Trespassing_.\r\n\r\nCreeping cautiously through the shelter of the orchard he contrived\r\nto escape observation and reach the highway in safety; at this quiet\r\nnoon hour the road was entirely deserted save for the presence of\r\none small boy who was jogging on ahead, a dinner pail upon his arm.\r\nHe was a slender little fellow of six or seven years who whistled\r\nshrilly as he went and kicked up clouds of dust with his bare feet.\r\nAs Van watched the sway of his shoulders and the unhampered tread of\r\nhis unshod feet he could not but recall the days when he, too, had\r\ngloried in going barefoot. He smiled at the memory which now seemed\r\nso absurd.\r\n\r\nA slight sound behind him broke in upon his reverie.\r\n\r\nBounding the turn just at his back swept a big scarlet touring-car\r\ndriven by a solitary man. It was coming at tremendous speed and no\r\nhorn had given warning of its noiseless approach. Van had but an\r\ninstant to step out of its path when on it shot, bearing down on the\r\nunconscious boy ahead. The little chap was walking in the middle of\r\nthe road and whistling so loudly that no hint of the oncoming danger\r\nreached him. The man in the motor saw the child and sounding his\r\nhorn, swerved to the left; but it was too late. The speeding car\r\ncaught the lad, struck him, and tossed him to the roadside rushing\r\non in its mad flight faster, if anything, than before.\r\n\r\nIn vain did Van call after it.\r\n\r\nHis protest was useless.\r\n\r\nThe great red vehicle whirled forward, a speck in the sunshine, and\r\nwas lost to view.\r\n\r\nTerror-stricken Van darted to the child\'s side and bent over him.\r\n\r\nHis eyes were closed and an ugly gash in his forehead was bleeding\r\nprofusely.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NO HORN HAD GIVEN WARNING]\r\n\r\nBinding a handkerchief round the little fellow\'s head the older boy\r\nlifted him in his arms and retracing his steps ran with him down the\r\nroad, across the Sawyer lawn, and up the steps of the Colversham\r\ninfirmary.\r\n\r\nA young orderly who was lounging at the door came forward and on\r\nseeing the child\'s face spoke quickly to a physician who was passing\r\nthrough the hall. Together they took the little boy from Van\'s arms\r\nand carried him to a cot in an adjoining room, anxiously plying Van\r\nwith questions as they went.\r\n\r\nBriefly Van related the story.\r\n\r\n"Such men should be hung! Prison is too good for them!" snapped the\r\ndoctor angrily.\r\n\r\nHe passed his hand with infinite tenderness over the tiny, still\r\nform on the bed.\r\n\r\n"Is he much hurt, sir?" questioned Van eagerly.\r\n\r\n"I can\'t tell yet. He is hurt enough so that he doesn\'t come to his\r\nsenses, poor little chap! Here, Jackson, ring for a couple of\r\nnurses. We\'ll get the child up-stairs."\r\n\r\nVan tagged behind them more because he was anxious to hear of the\r\nlad\'s condition than because he could be of any real use.\r\n\r\nAs the sad procession left the elevator, emerging into the corridor\r\non the second floor, a tall man who was coming down the stairway\r\nconfronted them.\r\n\r\nIt was Dr. Maitland, the principal of the school!\r\n\r\n"What\'s this?" he asked, advancing with swift stride.\r\n\r\nThe doctor hurriedly explained the circumstances.\r\n\r\n"A motor accident on the Claybrook Road, you say? Well, well! Poor\r\nlittle chap! Who brought him in?"\r\n\r\n"This lad--one of the schoolboys. You showed good judgment, Blake,\r\nand it was a mighty fortunate thing that you were there," observed\r\nthe surgeon, passing on.\r\n\r\n"The Claybrook Road?" repeated the puzzled principal. "You were on\r\nthe Claybrook Road, Blake? And what were you doing there at this\r\ntime of day?"\r\n\r\nWith throbbing heart Van suddenly came to himself.\r\n\r\nUp to that instant no thought of his own peculiar plight had crossed\r\nhis mind. Now the reality of his dilemma rushed upon him with\r\npitiless force.\r\n\r\n"May I ask," repeated the principal in measured tone, "what were you\r\ndoing on the Claybrook Road at this hour, Blake?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nVAN\'S GREAT DEED\r\n\r\n\r\nDr Maitland, who was a man of unswerving justice, was influenced in\r\nhis judgments neither by pity nor explanations, and thus it came\r\nabout that when Van had answered his questions, putting before him\r\nthe facts about his runaway, the principal sent the boy to his own\r\nroom to there await sentence Van was in the lowest of spirits. What\r\nwould the penalty of his insurrection be? He knew Dr. Maitland far\r\ntoo well to expect mercy, nor did he wish it. He was too proud for\r\nthat. He had disobeyed the rules of the school, and he must now bear\r\nthe punishment, be it what it would. The thought of holding back the\r\nfacts had never entered his mind. Indolent he sometimes was even to\r\nlaziness but never within his memory had he been dishonest. So he\r\nhad fearlessly told the truth, and despite the calamity it\r\nthreatened he found himself the happier for telling it. Whether it\r\nwould mean expulsion from Colversham he did not know; probably it\r\nwould.\r\n\r\nTo think of leaving Colversham, the place he loved so much! And in\r\ndisgrace, too. What would the other boys say? And his father?\r\n\r\nVan shrank at the thought of telling his father.\r\n\r\nMr. Blake was a severe man who, like Dr. Maitland, would not gloss\r\nover the affair either by tolerance or sympathy. He would be angry,\r\nand he would have the right to be. Van admitted that. As he looked\r\nback on his school days he realized for the first time how indulgent\r\nhis father had been; he had denied his son no reasonable wish,\r\nsimply asking in return that the boy express his gratitude by\r\nstudiousness and obedience. Van flushed as with vividness it came to\r\nhis consciousness that he had repaid his father\'s goodness with\r\nneither of these things. He had studied just as little as was\r\npossible, and in place of appreciation he had rendered nothing but\r\ndisgrace.\r\n\r\nHis self-esteem was at a very low ebb when Bob, dismissed from the\r\ninfirmary, returned to his old quarters. Van was seldom depressed--so\r\nseldom, in fact, that the sight aroused in his chum nothing but an\r\nanxiety lest he be ill. Surely nothing but sickness could cause Van\r\nBlake to lie on a couch, his face buried in pillows!\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter, old fellow?" called Bob the instant he was\r\ninside the door. "Are you used up?"\r\n\r\nNo answer.\r\n\r\n"I say, what\'s the trouble?" Bob repeated, hurrying to his side.\r\n\r\nIt took much questioning before the story could be drawn from the\r\nboy\'s reluctant lips.\r\n\r\n"When Bob had at last heard it he was silent.\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you say something?" queried Van peevishly.\r\n\r\n"I hardly know what to say," Bob answered with slow gentleness. "I\'m\r\nso sorry--so sorry and upset. I can\'t for the life of me understand\r\nhow you came to do such a thing. Did you expect to get away with it?\r\nYou must have known you would be missed at recitations and tracked\r\ndown."\r\n\r\n"That\'s right--rub it in!"\r\n\r\n"I\'m not rubbing it in; I\'m only trying to understand it."\r\n\r\n"There\'s nothing to understand. I just was crazy to go to that ball\r\ngame and I started. I should have gone, too, if it hadn\'t been for\r\nthe kid getting hurt."\r\n\r\n"It was bully of you to bring him back, anyway," Bob said. "Of\r\ncourse you knew it was all up with you when you did it."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t think about it at all. I wasn\'t thinking of anything but\r\nthat poor little chap who was mowed down by the brute in that car.\r\nIf I hadn\'t happened to hear the motor it might have been me\r\ninstead. I wish it had been," he declared gloomily.\r\n\r\n"No you don\'t. Great Scott, cheer up, Van! The country hasn\'t gone\r\nto the dogs yet. I must admit you are in a mess; but it doesn\'t\r\nbegin to be the mess it would have been if you had gone to the game,\r\nhad a bang-up time, and come home a sneak who had stolen his fun. At\r\nleast you have done the square thing and \'fessed up, and now you\'ll\r\nbe man enough to take what\'s coming to you. What do you suppose\r\nMaitland will do?"\r\n\r\n"I can guess pretty well--pack me off home. He is stiff as a ramrod\r\non obedience to the school rules," sighed Van, "and he\'s right, too.\r\nIt is perfectly fair. I knew it when I went."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t see, just for one afternoon of sport, how you--" Bob broke\r\noff. "If I\'d only been here you never would have gone."\r\n\r\n"Maybe not," admitted Van. Then he added in the same breath: "No, I\r\nshouldn\'t have gone if you had been here, Bobbie. Somehow you\'re my\r\ngood angel. I wrote Father so the other day."\r\n\r\n"Stuff!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s true. You are such a brick! I thought you\'d blow my head off\r\nwhen you\'d heard what I\'d done."\r\n\r\n"Well, I am mad enough to do it," was the tart reply. "For you to go\r\nand do a thing like that just for a ball game! It wasn\'t worth it.\r\nThink of your being pitched out of Colversham for a measly game of\r\nbaseball. And you didn\'t get there, either!"\r\n\r\nVan kicked the pillows impatiently.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t light into me, Bobbie," he moaned. "Don\'t I feel bad enough\r\nas it is?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know whether you do or not; you ought to."\r\n\r\n"I do, Bob. I\'m dead sorry."\r\n\r\n"If you\'d stay sorry it might do some good," returned Bob. A sudden\r\nthought seemed to strike him. He did not speak for a few moments;\r\nthen he said half aloud: "Who knows--it might help."\r\n\r\n"What might help?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing."\r\n\r\nBob got up and sauntered to the door.\r\n\r\n"Will you stay right here like a decent chap and not get into any\r\nmore mischief until I get back?"\r\n\r\n"Where are you going?"\r\n\r\n"Nowhere much--just across the campus for a little while. I\'ll be\r\nback soon. Will you wait here exactly where you are?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, but--"\r\n\r\n"Honor bright?"\r\n\r\n"Sure!"\r\n\r\n"All right. Don\'t quit this room until I come. So long!"\r\n\r\nBob was gone.\r\n\r\nVan lay very still after the door had closed, and to keep him\r\ncompany in his solitude back swarmed all those dreary thoughts that\r\nBob\'s cheery presence had for the time being banished; with a rush\r\nthey came to jeer, taunt, and terrify.\r\n\r\nThe _little while_ lengthened into an hour and on into a second\r\none.\r\n\r\nThe room became intolerable.\r\n\r\nThen upon the stone floor of the corridor outside sounded Bob\'s\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\n"Still here, Van?" he cried, coming in with elastic step and banging\r\nthe door after him.\r\n\r\nHis face was wreathed in smiles.\r\n\r\n"What\'s happened to you that you look like that?" questioned Van,\r\nsitting up among the pillows.\r\n\r\n"Like what?"\r\n\r\n"Why, as if somebody had sent you a Christmas-tree or made you\r\npresident of a railroad?"\r\n\r\nBob laughed.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve been to see the Head," he said.\r\n\r\n"Humph! I never knew of his causing any one such overwhelming\r\ndelight," observed Van a little spitefully.\r\n\r\n"Hush up, old man; don\'t run down the Doctor," Bob said. "You may\r\nhave more cause to be grateful to him than you know."\r\n\r\n"You don\'t mean--" Van\'s voice trembled. "Did you go to see him\r\nabout me?"\r\n\r\nBob nodded.\r\n\r\n"Bob! How did you dare?"\r\n\r\n"I dare do anything that becomes a man; who dares do more is none,"\r\nquoted Bob merrily. "I don\'t believe, though, I\'d have dared go for\r\nmyself," he answered. "It is different when you are doing it for\r\nsome one else. Now sit up and listen and I\'ll tell you all about it.\r\nThe Doctor was mighty white about you; but in spite of all he stuck\r\nto the fact that you\'d disobeyed the rules; he kept going back to\r\nthat every time I tried to switch him off. We squabbled over you a\r\nsolid hour, and the upshot of it was this: you are to stay at\r\nColversham--"\r\n\r\n"Hurrah!"\r\n\r\nVan hurled a pillow into the air.\r\n\r\n"Shut up and hear the rest of it. You are to stay here because I\r\npromised upon my word of honor that you would keep straight and\r\nstudy."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll do it."\r\n\r\n"That isn\'t all."\r\n\r\nBob hesitated.\r\n\r\nIt was a wrench for him to deliver the remainder of the message.\r\n\r\n"Yes, you are to stay," he repeated as if to gain time. "But of\r\ncourse you can\'t expect to slip through with no punishment at all."\r\n\r\n"No, indeed!"\r\n\r\nStill Van spoke with jaunty hopefulness.\r\n\r\n"The Doctor thinks it is only fair that you should be pretty\r\nseverely reminded of what you\'ve done."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all right. I\'m not afraid. Fire ahead! What\'s he going to do\r\nwith me?"\r\n\r\n"He thinks--he says--he feels it is best--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, come on, come on--out with it!"\r\n\r\n"He has forbidden you to take any part in the school athletics this\r\nspring," was the reluctant whisper.\r\n\r\nVan did not speak.\r\n\r\n"I\'m mighty sorry, old fellow," declared Bob, "but it was the best\r\nI could do."\r\n\r\nStill Van made no reply.\r\n\r\nWith troubled gaze Bob regarded his chum.\r\n\r\n"I\'d far rather Maitland had knocked me out," he ventured at last.\r\n\r\nStooping, he put his hand on Van\'s shoulder.\r\n\r\nVan roused himself and looked up into his friend\'s face with one of\r\nhis quick smiles.\r\n\r\n"It\'s all right, Bob," he said. "Don\'t you fuss about me any more.\r\nYou were a trump to get me off as well as you did. I\'ll take my\r\nmedicine without whimpering. I ought to bless my stars that my\r\nbanishment from athletics is only temporary. Suppose I had been\r\nsmashed up so I could never play another game like that little kid,\r\nTim McGrew," he shuddered. "It was just sheer luck that saved me.\r\nWhy, do you suppose, he should have been the one to be crippled and\r\nI go scot free?" he observed meditatively.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know. Maybe because there is something in the world that\r\nonly you can do. My father believes that."\r\n\r\n"Do you?"\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know."\r\n\r\n"It would be strange, wouldn\'t it, to feel you were let off just to\r\ndo something?" mused Van. "You\'d be wondering all the time what it\r\nwas. Of course it would be something big."\r\n\r\n"You could never tell what it was," Bob replied, falling in with his\r\nfriend\'s mood. "I suppose the only way to make sure would be to do\r\nwhatever came to you the best way you could do it. You never could\r\nbe sure that what you were doing was not the great thing."\r\n\r\n"Not studying and stuff like that."\r\n\r\n"It might be; or at least studying might lead to it."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe it."\r\n\r\n"It wouldn\'t hurt you to try it."\r\n\r\n"No, I suppose not." Then with characteristic caprice Van shifted\r\nthe subject. "But seriously, Bobbie, there is something I am going\r\nto do. You\'ll howl, I guess, and maybe you\'ll be disappointed, too.\r\nIt\'s about that sick kid, Tim McGrew. The surgeon says the little beggar\r\nwill never walk again. I feel pretty sore about it; I suppose\r\nbecause I was there," explained Van uneasily. "I\'ve about decided to\r\nchip in the money Father was going to send me for a canoe and get a\r\nwheel chair for him. His folks are poor, and can\'t get one, and the\r\ndoctor says--"\r\n\r\n"You\'re a--"\r\n\r\n"Oh, shut up, can\'t you, Bobbie? It\'s only because I\'m so cut up\r\nabout the accident. Remember, it might have been me instead of him.\r\nYou won\'t mind much if we don\'t have the canoe, will you?"\r\n\r\n"No," was the low answer.\r\n\r\nNeither of the boys spoke for some time.\r\n\r\nThen Bob whispered:\r\n\r\n"Have you thought, Van, that maybe the thing you are to do is\r\nsomething for that little lame boy, Tim McGrew?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nHOW VAN BORE HIS PUNISHMENT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe spring term passed much faster than either Bob or Van dreamed it\r\nwould and despite the absence of athletics Van Blake found plenty to\r\ndo to fill the gap left by this customary activity.\r\n\r\nIn the first place there was his studying. Had not Bob assumed an\r\nobligation that must be lived up to and that was quite as binding as\r\nif it existed on paper instead of in a mere invisible point of\r\nhonor? He was very grateful to Bob and had given bond that he would\r\nlive up to the pledge his chum had made for him. Now he must fulfil\r\nhis promise, Van argued. So although the call of the springtime was\r\nstrong and difficult to resist he had been faithful to his work,\r\n"plugging away," as he expressed it, with all his strength. To his\r\nsurprise the task, so irksome at first, became interesting. It was\r\na novel experience to enter a classroom and instead of moving in a\r\nmental haze possess a clear idea of what was going on. Twice he was\r\nable to furnish the correct answers to Latin questions on which\r\nevery one else had failed, and what a thrill of satisfaction\r\naccompanied the performance!\r\n\r\nThe attitude of his teachers changed, too. Formerly they had been\r\npolite; now they became even cordial, demonstrating by an\r\nunsuspected friendliness that they were after all ordinary human\r\nbeings and rather likable ones at that. They were moreover amazingly\r\nsympathetic and met every endeavor of Van\'s with generous aid.\r\nPerhaps schools were not the prison-houses he had formerly thought\r\nthem!\r\n\r\nThere had, of course, been no chance to conceal from the boys the\r\nreason of his banishment from the ball field and tennis-courts; such\r\na story as the motor accident travels with insidious speed. Before\r\na day had passed from one end of Colversham to the other everybody\r\nknew that Van Blake had disobeyed the school rules and had in\r\nconsequence forfeited his place in out-of-door sports. Van, however,\r\nwas a great favorite and the manly way in which he accepted his\r\npenalty provoked nothing but admiration and respect from his\r\nclassmates. He frankly admitted his mistake, owning that while his\r\nsentence was severe it was perfectly just; nor would he permit a\r\nword of criticism of Dr. Maitland\'s decree to be voiced in his\r\nhearing.\r\n\r\n"Maitland is all right!" was his hearty endorsement, and that remark\r\nwas the only encouragement his pals received when they came to\r\ncondone with him.\r\n\r\nGradually the affair dropped out of sight. Van went among the boys,\r\ncheerily giving advice as to the make-up of the school teams and\r\neven coaching the fellow who was to serve as his successor as\r\npitcher on the nine.\r\n\r\nNevertheless there still remained quite a margin of leisure, and it\r\nwas during this lonely interval when every one else was training for\r\nthe coming games that he would stray off by himself and visit little\r\nTim McGrew. Between the two a peculiar friendship sprang up. On\r\nVan\'s part it arose from forlornness mingled with a half formulated\r\nbelief that he must do something to express his thankfulness that he\r\nhimself had escaped from the fate that had overtaken the child. On\r\nthe small lad\'s side it had its root in gratitude and hero-worship.\r\nIn Tim\'s eyes Van Blake was an all-powerful person. Was it not he\r\nwho had picked him up and carried him to the hospital? And had not\r\nthis same big schoolboy bought the beautiful wheel-chair that\r\nenabled one to travel about the house and yard almost as readily as\r\nif on foot? In addition to all this was it not Van who came often to\r\nthe house, never forgetting to bring in his pocket some toy or\r\npicture-book? Small things they often were--these gifts that meant\r\nso much to the child--often things of very slight money value; but\r\nto the invalid whose long, tedious days of convalescence were\r\nstretches of monotony the tiny presents seemed treasures from an\r\nenchanted land.\r\n\r\nTim was now at home in the shabby cottage on the outskirts of\r\nColversham where he lived with his mother and four sisters. Poor as\r\nthe place was it was spotlessly neat and Tim\'s family were\r\nspotlessly tidy too. Mrs. McGrew, who supported her household by\r\ndoing washing for some of the families in the town, might have had\r\na permanent and much more lucrative position elsewhere had it not been\r\nfor leaving her five little ones; as it was, she clung to her\r\nchildren, struggling to meet her living expenses as best she could.\r\nIt had been a sore grief to her when Tim, her only boy and the baby\r\nof the home, had become crippled. Perhaps she sensed more clearly\r\nthan did the lad the full seriousness of the calamity. As for Tim,\r\nhe accepted it in childish fashion, hopefully ignoring the problems\r\nof the future.\r\n\r\nTo Van Blake Mrs. McGrew was all gratitude. Of all her children her\r\nboy was her favorite.\r\n\r\n"But for you, sir, little Timmie might have been left at the\r\nroadside to die," she would exclaim over and over. "We\'ll never\r\nforget it--never--neither I nor the children!"\r\n\r\nIt was thus that Van became the hero of the McGrew household, and\r\nthe warmth and genuineness of the welcome he unfailingly received\r\nthere aroused in him an answering friendliness. Many a time when he\r\nsaw things either new or interesting he would find himself\r\ninstinctively saying:\r\n\r\n"I must tell Tim about that," or "I must take that to Tim."\r\n\r\nBut with his enthronement as the sovereign of Tim\'s universe there\r\ncame to Van a very disquieting experience. Tim thought his big\r\nfriend knew everything, and in consequence whenever he became\r\npuzzled about facts that were being read to him or that he heard he\r\nwould instantly appeal to Van, whom he was sure could right every\r\nsort of dilemma that might arise. But too often the unlucky Van was\r\nforced to blush and falter that he would have to look it up; and\r\nwhen he did so he frequently learned something himself. For Tim\r\nnever forgot. No sooner would Van be inside the gate than the shrill\r\nlittle voice would pipe: "And did you find out how far away Mars is,\r\nMr. Blake?"\r\n\r\nPoor Van, it kept him scrambling to satisfy Tim McGrew\'s\r\nintellectual curiosity, yet there was a tang in the game that\r\nrendered it very interesting. He found, too, ample reward in seeing\r\nthe wee invalid\'s face brighten when the query was answered.\r\n\r\nSo the spring sped on.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Van had heard only irregularly from his parents. In\r\na long letter to his father he had sent all the facts of his\r\ndisgrace at school and had added that he was truly sorry; the reply\r\nhe received had been terse and rather stern but not unkind. Mr.\r\nBlake expressed much regret for his son\'s conduct and closed his\r\nepistle with the caustic comment that he should look for a proof of\r\nVan\'s desire to make good. That was all. Van knew that Dr. Maitland\r\nhad also written; but what he did not know was that with the\r\nfearlessness so characteristic of him Bob Carlton had taken the time\r\nand trouble to pen a long note to Colorado as a plea for his chum.\r\nIt was a remarkable composition from a boy so young--a letter full\r\nof affection and earnestness and voicing a surprising insight into\r\nhis friend\'s character and disposition. Mr. Blake read it over three\r\ntimes, and when he finished sat in a reverie with it still between\r\nhis fingers. The tone of it was so like the man he had known long\r\nago, that friend from whom a misunderstanding that now seemed\r\npitiably trivial had separated him. It had been his fault; Mr. Blake\r\ncould see that now. He had been both hasty and unjust. Over him\r\nsurged a great wave of regret. Well, it was too late to mend the\r\nmatter at this late day. One chance was, however, left him--to make\r\nup to the son for the injustice done the father.\r\n\r\nIt therefore came about that at the close of the school term Bob\r\nCarlton was overjoyed to receive from Van\'s parents an invitation to\r\ncome west with their boy and pass the summer holidays. Such a\r\nmiracle seemed too good to be a reality, and the lads\' instant fear\r\nwas that the Carltons would be unwilling to spare Bob from home for\r\nsuch a long time. To their surprise, however, Mr. Carlton welcomed\r\nthe plan with enthusiasm. A trip to Colorado would be a wonderful\r\nopportunity, the educational value of which could scarcely be\r\nestimated, he argued. Underneath this most excellent reason there\r\nalso existed on Mr. Carlton\'s part a desire to show his former\r\npartner that he cherished no ill will for the past. Who knew but the\r\nboy might even be a messenger of peace?\r\n\r\nSo one June morning, after bidding good-bye to Colversham and to Tim\r\nMcGrew, the two lads set forth on their western journey. They were\r\nin high spirits. Both had passed the examinations with honors, and\r\nas Van thought of his achievement again and again he wondered if it\r\ncould be true that he was one of that light-hearted band who were\r\nstarting off on their summer vacation with no conditions to work\r\noff.\r\n\r\nThe solitary cloud on the horizon was the grief of little Tim at\r\nhaving his friend go. But Van promised there should be letters--lots\r\nof them--and post-cards, too, all along the route; the parting would\r\nnot be for long anyway.\r\n\r\nThese were some of the thoughts that surged through Van\'s mind as he\r\nand Bob settled themselves into their places on the train and began\r\nthe attempt to fathom the reams of directions Mr. Blake had sent\r\nthem; pages and pages there were of what to do and what not to do on\r\nthe long trip, the letter closing with the single sentence:\r\n\r\n"I am trusting you to make this journey alone because I believe your\r\nchum, Bob Carlton, has a level head."\r\n\r\n"If your own head is not level, Bobbie, it is at least an honor to\r\nbe associated with a head that is," remarked Van humorously. "I\r\nguess that is about all the recommendation you need from Dad, old\r\nboy. I wonder how he happened to take such a fancy to you without\r\never having met you."\r\n\r\n"I wonder," echoed Bob quietly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE BOYS MAKE A NEW ACQUAINTANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Bob every mile of the western journey was a step into Wonderland;\r\nnovel sights, novel ideas confronted him on every hand and viewed\r\nthrough the medium of his enthusiasm things that had become\r\nthreadbare to Van became, as if by magic, suddenly new. The\r\ngreatness of the country was a marvel of which Bob had never before\r\nhad any adequate conception. Then there were the cities, alive with\r\nvarying industries, and teeming with their strangely mixed American\r\npopulation. Above all was the amazing natural beauty of scenery\r\nhitherto undreamed of. Hour after hour Bob sat spellbound at the\r\nwindow of the observation-car, never tiring of watching the shifting\r\nlandscape as it whirled past. His interest and intelligence caught\r\nthe notice of a gentleman who occupied the section opposite the\r\nboys, and soon the three formed one of those pleasant acquaintances\r\nso frequently made in traveling.\r\n\r\nMr. Powers (for that was the stranger\'s name) was on his way back to\r\nhis farm in Utah, and very eager was he to reach home.\r\n\r\n"So many things on the place need my attention that the journey you\r\nare delighting in seems very long to me," he remarked to Bob one\r\nmorning as they came from the dining-car.\r\n\r\n"Is your farm a large one, Mr. Powers?" questioned Bob.\r\n\r\nMr. Powers smiled.\r\n\r\n"It is larger than you would want to build a fence around," he\r\nreturned humorously.\r\n\r\n"I suppose you have all sorts of cows and pigs and horses on it, and\r\nraise every kind of fruit and vegetable that ever was invented," put\r\nin Van mischievously.\r\n\r\nMr. Powers shook his head and looked not a little amused.\r\n\r\n"No. We have only enough stock for our own use--nothing fancy. I do\r\nnot go in for show farming. I raise only one thing on my land, and\r\nI\'m going to see if you are clever enough to guess what it is."\r\n\r\n"Alfalfa!" cried Bob instantly.\r\n\r\n"No. How did you happen to think of that?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I\'ve read that lots of western farmers raised it."\r\n\r\n"True enough. It wasn\'t a bad guess, but it was not the right one,"\r\nsaid the stranger. "Now suppose we hear from your chum."\r\n\r\n"Corn."\r\n\r\n"Still wrong; but you are getting warmer."\r\n\r\n"Wheat."\r\n\r\n"Wheat is not as good a random shot as corn."\r\n\r\n"It must be a vegetable," declared Bob thoughtfully. "Let me see.\r\nNot potatoes?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"Of course it couldn\'t be peas, or beans, or squash, because you\r\nsaid once you had hundreds of acres, and you would never raise any\r\nof those things in such large quantities," argued Van. "Spinach,\r\ntomatoes--"\r\n\r\n"I have it!" cried Bob. "You should have guessed it the first thing,\r\nVan."\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"Can\'t you think? With your father right in the business you ought\r\nto."\r\n\r\n"Beets," exclaimed Van.\r\n\r\n"Beets it is!" agreed Mr. Powers. "So your father is interested in\r\nbeets too, is he? You don\'t chance to be the son of Mr. Asa Blake,\r\ndo you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"That is a coincidence," observed Mr. Powers much interested. "I\r\nsell all my crops to him. I expect then, young man, you know all\r\nthere is to be known about growing beets."\r\n\r\n"On the contrary, I don\'t know a thing," Van confessed laughing.\r\n"Dad has never talked to me much about his business. He is too busy\r\nto talk to anybody," he added a little dubiously.\r\n\r\n"It is usually the doctor\'s children who never get any medicine,"\r\nchuckled Mr. Powers. "Now, I could do better than that for you. I\r\ncould tell you considerable about beets if you urged me to."\r\n\r\n"I wish you would," answered the boys promptly.\r\n\r\n"There, you see, you urge me at once--you insist upon hearing! What\r\ncan I do? There is no escape for me but to comply with your request.\r\nOf course I was not expecting to be called upon to speak to-day and\r\ntherefore I must crave the indulgence of the audience if I am but\r\npoorly prepared," began Mr. Powers with mock gravity.\r\n\r\n"In the first place you must remember that while sugar-cane can only\r\nbe cultivated in a hot, moist climate, beets grow best in the\r\ntemperate zone. In the United States there is a belt of beet-sugar\r\nland two hundred miles wide that runs irregularly across the country\r\nfrom southern New England to the Pacific coast. Sugar-beets can, of\r\ncourse, be grown elsewhere, but it is in this particular region that\r\nthey thrive best. If even a small proportion of this area were to be\r\nplanted with beets we could get enough sugar from them to enable us\r\nto ship it to foreign markets instead of yearly importing a large\r\namount of it. The trouble is that we Americans are so rich in land\r\nthat we waste it and fail to get from it a tenth part of what we\r\nmight. If you doubt that travel in Europe and see what is done with\r\nland on the other side; or, better yet, watch what some Italian in\r\nthis country will get from a bit of land no bigger than your pocket\r\nhandkerchief."\r\n\r\nMr. Powers stopped a minute and looked out of the window.\r\n\r\n"The great objection our people make to growing beets is that they\r\ninjure the soil so that nothing else planted afterward will\r\nflourish. Now to an extent this is true. Beets do run out the soil\r\nif they are raised year after year on the same land. If our farmers\r\nwere not so slow to get a new idea they would raise beets in\r\nrotation as is done in Europe."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by rotation?" demanded Bob.\r\n\r\n"A rotating crop is one that produces a sequence of different kinds\r\nof harvests," explained Mr. Powers. "By that I mean harvests of\r\nentirely varying nature. Abroad they have learned that a hoed crop,\r\nwhen planted annually, destroys the productivity of the earth;\r\ntherefore foreigners plant beets one year in three or five and\r\ncereals, turnips, or something else in between times. Formerly they\r\nused to let the land lie fallow a year to rest it, but now they have\r\nworked out a scheme by which they get a crop every year. It was\r\nNapoleon, that Frenchman of wonderful brain, who first discovered\r\nthe value of beets for making sugar, and thought out the plan for\r\nraising them in rotation with other varieties of crops. He commanded\r\nthat ninety thousand acres of beets be planted in different parts of\r\nFrance, and he established in connection with this decree a great\r\nfund of money from which bonuses were to be paid to persons who\r\nbuilt factories to manufacture beet-sugar. He went even further,\r\nfurnishing free instruction to all who wished to learn the industry.\r\nIn consequence at the end of a couple of years there were in France\r\nover three hundred small sugar factories; little by little this\r\nnumber has increased until now the sugar product of the French\r\nnation is enormous."\r\n\r\nFascinated by the story Bob and Van listened attentively.\r\n\r\n"Didn\'t other countries steal the idea of the rotating crop?"\r\ninquired Van.\r\n\r\n"Not at first. Germany tried to make her farmers believe in the new\r\nnotion, but failed," answered Mr. Powers. "Later, however, as an\r\ninducement, the German government helped beet-sugar factories pay\r\nsuch good prices for beets that the farmers became anxious to raise\r\nthem; at the same time a high duty was placed on imported sugar, and\r\nthe result was that the German people were forced to manufacture\r\ntheir own. At the present time about one-half of the sugar used by\r\nall the world is made in foreign factories. I myself run my beet\r\nfarm on the rotation principle, and find that the hoed root crops\r\nseem to stimulate the others; but I can\'t convince my neighbors of\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"Does beet-sugar taste any different from cane?" inquired Bob.\r\n\r\n"Not a whit; you couldn\'t tell the difference," was Mr. Powers\'\r\nanswer.\r\n\r\n"I suppose sugar-beets are just like those in our gardens," ventured\r\nVan.\r\n\r\n"No, they\'re not; they are, however, not unlike them. They differ in\r\nhaving more juice and in usually being white," replied Mr. Powers.\r\n"The ground has first to be plowed and harrowed, and is afterward\r\nlaid off in eighteen-inch rows because beets, you know, are planted\r\nfrom seed. When the crop comes up trouble begins, for it has to be\r\nthinned until each plant has a good area in which to grow; the beets\r\nmust also be carefully weeded and the soil round them loosened if\r\nthey are to thrive."\r\n\r\n"How long is it before they are ready for sugar making?" inquired\r\nBob.\r\n\r\n"Practically five months; it depends somewhat on the season. When\r\nthey are ripe they are dug up, the tops are removed, and they are\r\nfloated down small canals where washing machines with revolving\r\nbrushes remove from them every atom of dirt."\r\n\r\n"And then?"\r\n\r\n"If they are to be made directly into syrup and do not have to be\r\nshipped in bulk they go into slicers which cut them into V-shaped\r\npieces about the length and thickness of a slate pencil, these\r\npieces being called cossettes. The sliced beet-root is next put into\r\nwarm water tanks in order that the sugar contained in it may be\r\ndrawn out. Built in a circle, these tanks are connected, and as the\r\nbeets move from one vat to another more and more sugar is taken from\r\nthem until they reach the last vat when the beet pulp is of no\r\nfurther use except to be used as fodder for live stock. The juice\r\nremains in the tanks, and in color it is--"\r\n\r\n"Red!" cried Van, thoughtlessly interrupting.\r\n\r\n"No, son, not red. It is black as ink."\r\n\r\n"Black!" exclaimed the boys in a chorus.\r\n\r\n"Black as your shoe."\r\n\r\n"But--but I don\'t see how they--" Van stopped, bewildered.\r\n\r\n"They bleach it by injecting fumes of sulphur gas into the tanks;\r\nlime is also used to--"\r\n\r\n"To clear it after the dirt has come to the top," put in the boys in\r\na breath.\r\n\r\n"Exactly so," laughed Mr. Powers. "I observe you are now at the home\r\nplate."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "THESE TANKS ARE CONNECTED"]\r\n\r\n"We saw it done at the sugar-cane refinery," explained Bob.\r\n\r\n"I see," nodded Mr. Powers. "Well, the principle of making beet-sugar\r\nis the same as cane-sugar. By the use of chemical solutions the juice\r\nis cleared until it is perfectly white."\r\n\r\nBob nudged Van with his elbow and the lads smiled understandingly.\r\nThere was no danger of their forgetting Mr. Hennessey and his secret\r\nchemical formula.\r\n\r\n"The remainder of the process is also similar to that used in\r\nrefining cane-sugar. The syrup passes from tank to tank, constantly\r\nthickening, and the molasses is extracted in the same fashion by\r\nbeing thrown off in the centrifugal machines when the sugar\r\ncrystallizes. Molasses is often boiled two and three times to make\r\nsecond and third grade molasses for the trade, and you must remember\r\nin this connection that the names _New Orleans_ and _Porto\r\nRico_ do not necessarily indicate where the product was made, but\r\nrather its quality, these varieties being of the finest grade."\r\n\r\nMr. Powers rose and drew out a cigar.\r\n\r\n"I think I\'m quite a lecturer, don\'t you?" he said. "I imagine your\r\nfather, Van, could have told you this story much better than I have\r\nif you could have captured him for two hours on a train when he had\r\nnothing else to do. As it is I have had to fill his place, and I\r\nwant you to inform him with my compliments that I am surprised to\r\ndiscover how completely he has neglected his son\'s education."\r\n\r\nWith a mischievous twinkle in his eye Mr. Powers passed into the\r\nsmoking-car.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE DAWN OF A NEW YEAR\r\n\r\n\r\nOn their arrival at Denver Van and Bob were met by Mr. Blake, and a\r\ndelay in the train admitted of a passing greeting between Mr. Powers\r\nand Van\'s father; afterward the heavy express that had safely\r\nbrought the travelers to their journey\'s end thundered on its way\r\nand the boys were left on the platform. Mr. Blake regarded each of\r\nthem keenly for a moment before speaking; then he extended his hand\r\nto Bob, saying:\r\n\r\n"The highest compliment I can pay you, young man, is to tell you you\r\nare like your father. Mrs. Blake and I are very grateful to you for\r\nwhat you\'ve done for our son."\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid--" protested Bob.\r\n\r\nMr. Blake cut him short.\r\n\r\n"There, there, we won\'t discuss it," said he. "I simply wish you to\r\nknow that both of us have appreciated your friendship for Van. He is\r\na scatter-brained young dog, but he is all we have, and we believe\r\nin time he is going to make good. Eh, son?" Despite the words he\r\nsmiled down at the lad kindly.\r\n\r\n"I hope so, Father."\r\n\r\n"With a wise friend at your elbow it will be your own fault if you\r\ndo not," his father declared.\r\n\r\nSummoning a porter to carry the luggage the trio followed him to the\r\ntrain which was to take them to the small town outside of Denver,\r\nwhere the Blakes resided.\r\n\r\nHere they found Van\'s mother--very beautiful and very young, it\r\nseemed to Bob; a woman of soft voice and pretty southern manner who\r\nseemed always to appear in a different gown and many floating scarfs\r\nand ribbons. Bob felt at a glance that she would not be the sort of\r\nperson to pack boxes of goodies and send to her boy; she would\r\nalways be too busy to do that. That she was, nevertheless, genuinely\r\nfond of Van there could be not the smallest doubt, and she welcomed\r\nboth boys to the great stone house with true Virginian hospitality.\r\n\r\nTo describe that western sojourn would be a book in itself.\r\n\r\nBob wrote home to his parents volumes about his good times, and\r\nstill left half the wonders of his Colorado visit untold. There was\r\nthe trip up Pike\'s Peak; a two days\' jaunt to a gold mine; a\r\nhorseback ride to a large beet farm in an adjoining town; three\r\nweeks of real mountain camping, the joy of which was enhanced by the\r\ncapture of a good sized bear. In addition to all this there were\r\nseveral fishing trips, and toward the close of the holiday a tour to\r\nthe Grand Canyon.\r\n\r\nIt was a never-to-be-forgotten vacation crowded with experiences\r\nnovel and delightful.\r\n\r\n"I wonder, Van, how you can ever be content to leave all this behind\r\nand come East to school," remarked Bob to his chum when toward the\r\nlast of September they once more boarded the train and turned their\r\nfaces toward Colversham.\r\n\r\n"Oh, you see, Dad was born in the East, and he wanted me to have an\r\neastern education," explained Van. "He laughs at himself for the\r\nidea though, and says it is only a sentimental notion, as he is\r\nconvinced a western school would do exactly as well. He has lived\r\nout here twenty years now, and yet he still has a tender spot in his\r\nheart for New England. It is in his blood, he declares, and he can\'t\r\nget it out. Notwithstanding his love for the East, however, Mother\r\nand I say that wild horses couldn\'t drag him back there to live."\r\n\r\n"I suppose you wouldn\'t want to come East, either," Bob said.\r\n\r\n"Not on your life! Give me lots of hustle and plenty of room!"\r\nreplied Van emphatically. "But I like the East and the eastern\r\npeople, and I\'ll be almighty tickled to get back to Colversham and\r\nthe fellows--to say nothing of Tim McGrew."\r\n\r\n"You\'ll take up football again this fall, of course," said Bob.\r\n"We\'ll both duff right in with the practice squad as soon as the\r\nboys get out; it seems to me there is no earthly reason why each of\r\nus shouldn\'t land somewhere on the eleven this year."\r\n\r\nWeeks afterward Bob thought with a grim smile of the remark.\r\n\r\nHow different that fall term proved to be from anything he had\r\nexpected!\r\n\r\nColversham was reached without disaster and back into the chaos of\r\ntrunks, suit-cases, and swarming arrivals came the western\r\ntravelers. From morning until night a stream of boys crossed and\r\nrecrossed the campus and the air was merry with such characteristic\r\ngreetings as:\r\n\r\n"Ah, there, Blakie! How is the old scout?"\r\n\r\n"Snappy work, Bob Carlton! I say, you look pretty kippie. Where did\r\nyou swipe the yellow shoes?"\r\n\r\n"Just wearing them temporarily until I can step into yours as stroke\r\nof the crew!" called back Bob good-naturedly.\r\n\r\nA shout went up from the boys who had heard the sally.\r\n\r\nFor nearly a week the school grounds were a-hum with voices. Then\r\nthings began to settle down into the regular yearly routine. In\r\nspite of the stiff program ahead Van managed to spend some part of\r\neach day, if only a few moments of it, with Tim McGrew. How much\r\nthere was to tell! Three months had worked marvels in the little\r\nfellow and it was a pleasure to see how his strength was returning.\r\n\r\n"The doctor thinks there\'s a chance I may walk yet, Mr. Blake!"\r\nexclaimed the child. "He doesn\'t promise it, mind; he just says\r\nmaybe things won\'t turn out as bad as we thought at first. I heard\r\nhim tell Ma that perhaps later if I was to be operated on maybe I\'d\r\npull through and surprise everybody. Think of it! Think what it\r\nmeans to know there is even a chance. Wouldn\'t it be wonderful if I\r\nshould walk again some time?"\r\n\r\nCatching the glow in the wistful face Van\'s own beamed.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll have us all fooled yet, Tim," he cried, "and be prancing\r\nround here like a young Kentucky colt--see if you don\'t."\r\n\r\nThe lads chuckled together.\r\n\r\nVan was bubbling over with high spirits when he left Tim that\r\nafternoon and there was nothing to herald the approach of the\r\ncalamity that fell like a thunderbolt upon him. It was late at night\r\nwhen the illness developed that so alarmed Bob Carlton that it sent\r\nhim rushing to the telephone to call up the head master. From that\r\nmoment on things moved with appalling rapidity. Van was carried from\r\nthe dormitory to the school hospital and at the doctor\'s advice Mr.\r\nCarlton was summoned from New York by telephone. Within an\r\nincredibly few hours both he and his wife arrived by motor, and\r\ntheir first act was to wire Van\'s father.\r\n\r\nThe boy was very ill, so ill that in an operation lay the one\r\nslender chance of saving his life. The case could brook no delay.\r\nThere was not sufficient time to consult Van\'s father, or learn from\r\nhim his preferences as to what should be done. To Mr. Carlton fell\r\nthe entire responsibility of taking command of the perilous\r\nsituation. He it was who secured the famous surgeon from New York;\r\nwho sent for nurses and doctors; who made the decision that meant\r\nlife or death to the boy who lay suffering on the cot in that silent\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nHow leaden were the hours while the lad\'s existence trembled in the\r\nbalance!\r\n\r\nMr. Carlton paced the floor of the tiny office, his hands clinched\r\nbehind him and his lips tightly set. If Van did not survive his\r\nwould be the word that had sent him to his end. Should the worst\r\nbefall how should he ever greet that desperate father who was even\r\nnow hurrying eastward with all the speed that money could purchase?\r\nWhat should he say? What could he say, Mr. Carlton asked himself. To\r\nlose his own child would be a grief overwhelming enough; but to have\r\ngiven the order that hurried another man\'s only boy into eternity--that\r\nwould be a tragedy that nothing could ever make right.\r\n\r\n"I have done the best I knew," muttered Mr. Carlton over and over to\r\nhimself. "I have done toward his son precisely as I would have done\r\ntoward my own. Had I it all to decide over again I could do nothing\r\ndifferent."\r\n\r\nYet try as he would to comfort himself the hours before he could\r\nhave tidings from the operating room dragged with torturing\r\nslowness. Bob, crouched in a chair in the corner of the room, dared\r\nnot speak to his father. Never had he seen him so unnerved. There\r\nwas no need to question the seriousness of the moment; it brooded in\r\nthe tenseness of the atmosphere, in the speed with which his heart\r\nbeat, in the drawn face of the man who never ceased his measured\r\ntread up and down the narrow room.\r\n\r\nAnd when the strain of the operation was actually over there was no\r\nlessening of anxiety, because for days following the battle for life\r\nhad still to be waged. Would human strength hold through the combat?\r\nThat was the question that filled the weary hours of the day and the\r\nsleepless watches of the night.\r\n\r\nMr. Carlton, ordinarily so bound up in business affairs that he\r\nnever could leave town, now gave not a thought to them. Instead he\r\ntook up his abode in the dormitory with Bob that he might be close\r\nat hand, and here he eagerly checked off the successive hours that\r\nbrought nearer that man who was racing against Fate across the vast\r\nbreadth of the country.\r\n\r\nHow would they meet, these two who had been so long divided by a\r\ngulf of years and bitterness? Would his former friend feel that the\r\ndecisions he had made were wise, or would he heap reproaches upon\r\nhim for putting in jeopardy a life over which he had no jurisdiction?\r\nWith dread Mr. Carlton strove to put the thought of the coming\r\ninterview out of his mind.\r\n\r\n"I have done as well as I knew," he reiterated. "Would that it had\r\nbeen my own boy instead of his!"\r\n\r\nOver and over he planned to himself what he would say at that\r\ncrucial meeting. He would explain as nearly as he could the precise\r\nconditions that he felt justified him in assuming the immense\r\nfinancial responsibilities he had heaped up for his former friend.\r\nIf the lad lived it would be worth it all; but if he did not it\r\nwould all have gone for naught. Would not any father rather have had\r\nhis child alive, invalid though he was, than to have lost him\r\naltogether?\r\n\r\nThe meeting when it came was quite different from anything Mr.\r\nCarlton had outlined. It was after midnight when the special arrived\r\nat the dim little station, and even before the train came to a stop\r\nits solitary passenger sprang impatiently to the platform.\r\n\r\nThere was no need for James Carlton to make certain who it was;\r\nevery line of the form was familiar. He strode to the traveler\'s\r\nside.\r\n\r\nThe hands of the two men shot out and met in a firm clasp.\r\n\r\n"The boy?"\r\n\r\n"He is alive, Asa."\r\n\r\n"God bless you, Jim!"\r\n\r\nVan Blake faced the great crisis, fought his way courageously\r\nthrough it, and won.\r\n\r\nSlowly he retraced his steps up the path to health again, and as\r\nsoon as he was able to be moved he and his father and mother\r\ntogether with the Carltons went to Allenville and opened the old\r\nfarmhouse for Christmas.\r\n\r\nWhat a Christmas it was!\r\n\r\nWhat a day of rejoicing and thanksgiving among young and old!\r\n\r\nTim McGrew and all his family were brought down for a holiday, and\r\nthere was a royal tree decked with candles and loaded with gifts;\r\nthere was a pudding which could nowhere have been matched; a\r\nsouthern plum-pudding made by Van\'s mother; there were carols sung\r\nas only those to whom they meant much could sing them; and there was\r\njoy and peace in every heart.\r\n\r\n"Next summer it must be Colorado for you all, Jim," cried Asa Blake\r\nas he stood with his hand on the shoulder of his old partner. "We\'ll\r\nmake this New Year the happiest of our lives. Tim shall go too; and\r\nif money can buy surgical skill he shall make the journey hither on\r\nhis own two feet. Here\'s to the new year, Jim!"\r\n\r\n"The new year, Asa, and may God bless us every one!" echoed Mr.\r\nCarlton, softly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Story of Sugar, by Sara Ware Bassett\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE STORY OF SUGAR ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 7803-8.txt or 7803-8.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/7/8/0/7803/\r\n\r\nProduced by Juliet Sutherland, Anne Folland, Ted Garvin\r\nand the Online Distributed Proofreading Team.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
