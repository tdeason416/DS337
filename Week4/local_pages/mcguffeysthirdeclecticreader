The moral tone is\r\nplain. "She is kind to the old blind man."\r\n\r\nThe exercises are still suitable, and perhaps more helpful\r\nthan some contemporary alternatives. Much is left to the\r\nteacher. Explanations given in the text are enough to get\r\nstarted teaching a child to read and write. Counting in\r\nRoman numerals is included as a bonus in the form of lesson\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\nThere is no text version because much of the material uses\r\nspecialized characters that have no ASCI equivalent.\r\nWherever possible the "ASCI" text has been converted.\r\n\r\nThe "non-ASCI" text remains as images.  The "non-ASCI"\r\ntext is approximated in text boxes to right of the image, as\r\nare script images.\r\n\r\nThe form of contractions includes a space. The\r\ncontemporary word "don\'t" was rendered as "do n\'t".\r\n\r\nThe author, not listed in the text is William Holmes\r\nMcGuffey.\r\n\r\nDon Kostuc\r\n\r\n\r\nECLECTIC EDUCATIONAL SERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMCGUFFEY\'S(R)\r\n\r\n\r\nTHIRD\r\n\r\n\r\nECLECTIC READER.\r\n\r\n\r\nREVISED EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMcGuffey Editions and Colophon are Trademarks of\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK--CHICHESTER--WEINHEIM--BRISBANE--SINGAPORE--TORONTO\r\n\r\n\r\nThe long continued popularity of MCGUFFEY\'S\r\nREADERS is sufficient evidence of the positive merits of\r\nthe books. The aim of this revision has been to preserve\r\nunimpaired the distinctive features of the series, and at the\r\nsame time to present the matter in a new dress, with new\r\ntype, new illustrations, and with a considerable amount of\r\nnew matter.\r\nSpelling exercises are continued through the first half of\r\nthe THIRD READER. These exercises, with those furnished\r\nin the two lower books, are exhaustive of the words\r\nemployed in the reading lessons. Words are not repeated in\r\nthe vocabularies.\r\nIn the latter half of the book, definitions are introduced. It\r\nis hoped that the teacher will extend this defining exercise to\r\nall the words of the lesson liable to be misunderstood. The\r\nchild should define the word in his own language sufficiently\r\nto show that he has a mastery of the word in its use.\r\nDrills in articulation and emphasis should be given with\r\nevery lesson. The essentials of good reading are not to be\r\ntaught by one or two lessons. Constant drill on good\r\nexercises, with frequent exhibitions of the correct method\r\nfrom the teacher, will be found more effectual than any form\r\nprescribed in type.\r\nIf the pupils are not familiar with the diacritical marks,\r\nthey should be carefully taught; such instruction constitutes\r\nan excellent drill on articulation, and enables the pupils to\r\nuse the dictionary with intelligence.\r\nCopyright, 1879, by VAN ANTWERP, BRAGG & Co.\r\nCopyright, 1896, by AMERICAN BOOK COMPANY.\r\nCopyright, 1907 and 1920, by H.

Except in case of\r\nmalformation of these organs, every pupil should sound each\r\nelement correctly before such drill should cease.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF VOCALS.\r\n\r\nLONG SOUNDS.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t6 \tECLECTIC SERIES,\r\n\r\nSHORT SOUNDS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIPHTHONGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF SUBVOCALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF ASPIRATES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\tTHIRD READER. \t7\r\n\r\nNOTE.-The above forty-five sounds are those most\r\nemployed in the English language. Some of these sounds are\r\nrepresented by other letters, as shown in the following table.\r\n\r\nTABLE OF SUBSTITUTES.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISES IN ARTICULATION.\r\n\r\nThe following exercises may be used for drill after the\r\ntables are fully understood. Pronounce the word first; then,\r\nthe sound indicated.\r\n\r\n\t8 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n\r\nEXERCISE I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\tTHIRD READER. \t9\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t10 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n\r\nEMPHASIS.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--If the pupil has received proper oral instruction,\r\nhe has been taught to understand what he has read, and has\r\nalready acquired the habit of emphasizing words. He is now\r\nprepared for a more formal introduction to the SUBJECT of\r\nemphasis, and for more particular attention to its first\r\nPRINCIPLES. This lesson, and the examples given, should\r\nbe repeatedly practiced.\r\nIn reading and in talking, we always speak some words\r\nwith more force than others. We do this, because the\r\nmeaning of what we say depends most upon these words.\r\nIf I wish to know whether it is George or his brother who\r\nis sick, I speak the words George and brother with more\r\nforce than the other words. I say, Is it George or his brother\r\nwho is sick?\r\nThis greater force with which we speak the words is called\r\nEMPHASIS.\r\nThe words upon which emphasis is put, are sometimes\r\nprinted in slanting letters, called Italics,* and sometimes in\r\nCAPITALS.\r\nThe words printed in Italics in the following questions and\r\nanswers, should be read with more force than the other\r\nwords, that is, with emphasis.\r\nDid you ride to town yesterday? No, my brother, did.\r\nDid yon ride to town yesterday? No, I walked.\r\n\r\n* Italics are also used for other purposes, though most\r\nfrequently for emphasis.\r\n\r\n\t \tTHIRD READER. \t11\r\n\r\nDid you ride to town yesterday? No, I went into the\r\ncountry.\r\nDid you ride to town yesterday? No, I went the day before.\r\nHave you seen James or John lately? I have seen James,\r\nbut not John.\r\nDid you say there were four eggs in the nest, or three?\r\nThere were only three eggs, not four.\r\nWere the eggs white or blue? The eggs were white, not\r\nblue.\r\nHad the boy a hat on his head, or a cap? He had a cap on,\r\nnot a hat.\r\n\r\nPUNCTUATION.\r\n\r\nPunctuation should be thoroughly studied by the pupil, in\r\norder that he may become perfectly familiar with the marks\r\nand pauses found in the reading lessons of this volume.\r\n\r\nMARKS AND PAUSES.\r\n\r\nThese marks are used to point off written or printed matter\r\ninto sentences and parts of sentences, and thus to assist the\r\nreader in obtaining the meaning of the writer. They seldom\r\nindicate the length of the pause to be made; this must be\r\ndetermined by the sense.\r\nA Hyphen (-) is used between syllables in a word divided at\r\nthe end of a line; as, "be-cause," "ques-tion," and between the\r\nparts of a compound word; as,\r\nRocking-chair, good-by.\r\n\r\n 12\tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n\r\nThe Comma (,), Semicolon (;), and Colon (:) mark\r\ngrammatical divisions in a sentence; as,\r\nGod is good; for he gives us all things.\r\nBe wise to-day, my child: \'t is madness to defer.\r\n\r\nA Period (.) is placed at the end of a sentence; as,\r\nGod is love. Life is short.\r\nOr is used after an abbreviation; as,\r\nDr. Murphy. Jan. 10, 1879.\r\n\r\nAn Interrogation Point (?) denotes a question; as,\r\nHas he come? Who are you?\r\n\r\nAn Exclamation Point (!) denotes strong feeling; as,\r\nO Absalom! my son! my son!\r\n\r\nThe Dash (--) is used where there is a sudden break or\r\npause in a sentence; as,\r\nThe truth has power--such is God\'s will--to make us better.\r\n\r\nQuotation Marks (" ") denote the words of another; as,\r\nGod said, "Let there be light."\r\n\r\nAn Apostrophe (\') denotes that a letter or letters are left\r\nout; as,\r\nO\'er, for over; \'t is, for it is.\r\nAnd is also used to show ownership; as,\r\nThe man\'s hat. Helen\'s book.\r\n\r\n\r\nMCGUFFEY\'S\r\n\r\nTHIRD READER.\r\n\r\nLESSON I.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SHEPHERD BOY.\r\n\r\n1. Little Roy led his sheep down to pasture,\r\nAnd his cows, by the side of the brook;\r\n\r\n(13)\r\n\r\n\t14 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n\r\nBut his cows never drank any water,\r\n   And his sheep never needed a crook.\r\n\r\n2. For the pasture was gay as a garden,\r\n   And it glowed with a flowery red;\r\nBut the meadows had never a grass blade,\r\n  And the brooklet--it slept in its bed:\r\n\r\n3. And it lay without sparkle or murmur,\r\n   Nor reflected the blue of the skies;\r\nBut the music was made by the shepherd,\r\n   And the sparkle was all in his eyes.\r\n\r\n4. Oh, he sang like a bird in the summer!\r\n  And, if sometimes you fancied a bleat,\r\nThat, too, was the voice of the shepherd,\r\n  And not of the lambs at his feet.\r\n\r\n5. And the glossy brown cows were so gentle\r\n  That they moved at the touch of his hand\r\nO\'er the wonderful, rosy-red meadow,\r\n  And they stood at the word of command.\r\n\r\n6. So he led all his sheep to the pasture,\r\n  And his cows, by the side of the brook;\r\nThough it rained, yet the rain never pattered\r\n  O\'er the beautiful way that they took.\r\n\r\n7. And it was n\'t in Fairyland either,\r\n  But a house in the midst of the town,\r\nWhere Roy, as he looked from the window,\r\n  Saw the silvery drops trickle down.\r\n\r\n\t \tTHIRD READER. \t15\r\n\r\n8. For his pasture was only a table,\r\n   With its cover so flowery fair,\r\nAnd his brooklet was just a green ribbon,\r\n   That his sister had lost from her hair.\r\n\r\n9. And his cows were but glossy horse-chestnuts,\r\n   That had grown on his grandfather\'s tree;\r\nAnd his sheep only snowy-white pebbles,\r\n   He had brought from the shore of the sea.\r\n\r\n10. And at length when the shepherd was weary,\r\n   And had taken his milk and his bread,\r\nAnd his mother had kissed him and tucked him,\r\n   And had bid him "good night" in his bed;\r\n\r\n11. Then there entered his big brother Walter,\r\n   While the shepherd was soundly asleep,\r\nAnd he cut up the cows into baskets,\r\n   And to jackstones turned all of the sheep.\r\n\r\nEmily S. Oakey.\r\n\r\nLESSON II.\r\n\r\n\r\nJOHNNY\'S FIRST SNOWSTORM.\r\n\r\n1. Johnny Reed was a little boy who never\r\nhad seen a snowstorm till he was six years old.\r\nBefore this, he had lived in a warm country,\r\nwhere the sun shines down on beautiful\r\n\r\n\t16 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\norange groves, and fields always sweet with  flowers.\r\n2. But now he had come to visit his grandmother, who\r\nlived where the snow falls in winter. Johnny was standing at\r\nthe window when the snow came down.\r\n\r\n3. "O mamma!" he cried, joyfully, "do come quick, and\r\nsee these little white birds flying down from heaven."\r\n4. "They are not birds, Johnny," said mamma, smiling.\r\n5. "Then maybe the little angels are losing their feathers!\r\nOh! do tell me what it is; is it sugar? Let me taste it," said\r\n\r\n\t\tTHIRD READER. \t17\r\nJohnny. But when he tasted it, he gave a little jump--it was\r\nso cold.\r\n6. "That is only snow, Johnny," said his mother.\r\n7.  "What is snow, mother?"\r\n8. "The snowflakes, Johnny, are little drops of water that\r\nfall from the clouds. But the air through which they pass is\r\nso cold it freezes them, and they come down turned into\r\nsnow."\r\n9. As she said this, she brought out an old black hat from\r\nthe closet. "See, Johnny! I have caught a snowflake on this\r\nhat. Look quick through this glass, and you will see how\r\nbeautiful it is."\r\n10. Johnny looked through the glass. There lay the pure,\r\nfeathery snowflake like a lovely little star.\r\n11. "Twinkle, twinkle, little star!" he cried in delight. "Oh!\r\nplease show me more snow-flakes, mother."\r\n12. So his mother caught several more, and they were all\r\nbeautiful.\r\n13. The next day Johnny had a fine play in the snow, and\r\nwhen he carne in, he said, "I love snow; and I think\r\nsnowballs are a great deal prettier than oranges."\r\n\r\n\r\n3,\r\n\r\n\t18 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n\r\nLESSON III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLET IT RAIN.\r\n\r\nRose. See how it rains! Oh dear, dear, dear! how dull it is!\r\nMust I stay in doors all day?\r\nFather. Why, Rose, are you sorry that you had any bread\r\nand butter for breakfast, this morning?\r\nRose. Why, father, what a question! I should be sorry,\r\nindeed, if I could not get any.\r\nFather. Are you sorry, my daughter, when you see the\r\nflowers and the trees growing in the garden?\r\nRose. Sorry? No, indeed. Just now, I wished very much to\r\ngo out and see them,--they look so pretty.\r\nFather. Well, are you sorry when you see the horses,\r\ncows, or sheep drinking at the brook to quench their thirst?\r\nRose. Why, father, you must think I am a cruel girl, to\r\nwish that the poor horses that work so hard, the beautiful\r\ncows that\r\n\r\n\t\tTHIRD READER. \t19\r\ngive so much nice milk, and the pretty lambs should always\r\nbe thirsty.\r\nFather. Do you not think they would die, if they had no\r\nwater to drink?\r\nRose. Yes, sir, I am sure they would. How shocking to\r\nthink of such a thing!\r\nFather. I thought little Rose was sorry it rained. Do you\r\nthink the trees and flowers would grow, if they never had\r\nany water on them?\r\nRose. No, indeed, father, they would be dried up by the\r\nsun. Then we should not have any pretty flowers to look at,\r\nand to make wreaths of for mother.\r\nFather. I thought you were sorry it rained. Rose, what is\r\nour bread made of?\r\nRose. It is made of flour, and the flour is made from\r\nwheat, which is ground in the mill.\r\nFather. Yes, Rose, and it was rain that helped to make the\r\nwheat grow, and it was water that turned the mill to grind the\r\nwheat. I thought little Rose was sorry it rained.\r\nRose. I did not think of all these things, father. I am truly\r\nvery glad to see the rain falling.\r\n\r\n\t20 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n\r\nLESSON IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTLE-BUILDING.\r\n\r\n1. "O pussy!" cried Herbert, in a voice of anger and\r\ndismay, as the blockhouse he was building fell in sudden\r\nruin. The playful cat had rubbed against his mimic castle,\r\n\r\n\t\tTHIRD READER. \t21\r\nand tower and wall went rattling down upon the floor.\r\n2. Herbert took up one of the blocks and threw it fiercely\r\nat pussy. Happily, it passed over her and did no harm. His\r\nhand was reaching for another block, when his little sister\r\nHetty sprang toward the cat, and caught her up.\r\n3. "No, no, no!" said she, "you sha\'n\'t hurt pussy!\r\nShe did n\'t mean to do it!"\r\n4. Herbert\'s passion was over quickly, and, sitting down\r\nupon the floor, he covered his face with his hands, and began\r\nto cry.\r\n5. "What a baby!" said Joe, his elder brother, who was\r\nreading on the sofa. "Crying over spilled milk does no good.\r\nBuild it up again."\r\n6. "No, I won\'t," said Herbert, and he went on crying.\r\n7. "What\'s all the trouble here?" exclaimed papa, as he\r\nopened the door and came in.\r\n8. "Pussy just rubbed against Herbert\'s castle, and it fell\r\ndown," answered Hetty. "But she did n\'t mean to do it; she\r\ndid n\'t know it would fall, did she, papa?"\r\n9. "Why, no! And is that all the trouble?"\r\n\r\n\t22 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n10. "Herbert!" his papa called, and held out his hands.\r\n"Come." The little boy got up from the floor, and came\r\nslowly, his eyes full of tears, and stood by his father.\r\n11. "There is a better way than this, my boy," said papa.\r\n"If you had taken that way, your heart would have been light\r\nalready. I should have heard you singing over your blocks\r\ninstead of crying. Shall I show you that way?"\r\n12. Herbert nodded his head, and papa sat down on the\r\nfloor by the pile of blocks, with his little son by his side, and\r\nbegan to lay the foundation for a new castle.\r\n\r\nLESSON V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCASTLE-BUILDING.\r\n(CONCLUDED)\r\n\r\n1. Soon, Herbert was as much interested in castle-building\r\nas he had been a little while before. He began to sing over\r\nhis work. All his trouble was gone.\r\n\r\n \tTHIRD READER. \t23\r\n2. "This is a great deal better than crying, is n\'t it?" said\r\npapa.\r\n3. "Crying for what?" asked Herbert, forgetting his grief\r\nof a few minutes before.\r\n4. "Because pussy knocked your castle over."\r\n5. "Oh!" A shadow flitted across his face, but was gone in\r\na moment, and he went on building as eagerly as ever.\r\n6. "I told him not to cry over spilled milk," said Joe,\r\nlooking down from his place on the sofa.\r\n7. "I wonder if you did n\'t cry when your kite string\r\nbroke," retorted Herbert.\r\n8. "Losing a kite is quite another thing," answered Joe, a\r\nlittle dashed. "The kite was gone forever; but your blocks\r\nwere as good as before, and you had only to build again."\r\n9. "I do n\'t see," said papa, "that crying was of any more\r\nuse in your case then in Herbert\'s. Sticks and paper are easily\r\nfound, and you had only to go to work and make another\r\nkite." Joe looked down at his book, and went on reading. By\r\nthis time the castle was finished.\r\n10. "It is ever so much nicer than the one\r\n\r\n\t24 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\npussy knocked down," said Hetty. And so thought Herbert,\r\nas he looked at it proudly from all sides.\r\n11. "If pussy knocks that down, I\'ll-"\r\n12. "Build it up again," said papa, finishing the sentence\r\nfor his little boy.\r\n\r\n13. "But, papa, pussy must not knock my castles down. I\r\ncan\'t have it," spoke out Herbert, knitting his forehead.\r\n14. "You must watch her, then. Little boys, as well as\r\ngrown up people, have to be often on their guard. If you go\r\ninto the street, you have to look out for the carriages, so as\r\nnot to be run over, and you have to keep out of people\'s way.\r\n15. "In the house, if you go about heedlessly, you will be\r\nvery apt to run against some one. I have seen a careless child\r\ndash suddenly into a room just as a servant was leaving it\r\nwith a tray of dishes in her hands. A crash followed."\r\n\r\n\t\tTHIRD READER. \t25\r\n16.  "It was I, was n\'t it?" said Hetty.\r\n17.  "Yes, I believe it was, and I hope it will never happen\r\nagain."\r\n18. Papa now left the room, saying, "I do n\'t want any\r\nmore of this crying over spilled milk, as Joe says. If your\r\ncastles get knocked down, build them up again."\r\n\r\nLESSON VI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLEND A HAND.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n26 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\tTHIRD READER. \t27\r\n\r\nLESSON VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRUANT.\r\n1. James Brown was ten years old when his parents sent\r\nhim to school. It was not far from his home, and therefore\r\nthey sent him by himself.\r\n2. But, instead of going to school, he was in the habit of\r\nplaying truant. He would go into the fields, or spend his time\r\nwith idle boys.\r\n3. But this was not all. When he went home, he would\r\nfalsely tell his mother that he had been to school, and had\r\nsaid his lessons very well.\r\n4. One fine morning, his mother told James to make haste\r\nhome from school, for she wished, after he had come back,\r\nto take him to his aunt\'s.\r\n5. But, instead of minding her, he went off to the water,\r\nwhere there were some boats. There he met plenty of idle\r\nboys.\r\n6. Some of these boys found that James\r\n\r\n\t28 \tECLECTIC SERIES,\r\nhad money, which his aunt had given him; and he was led by\r\nthem to hire a boat, and to go with them upon the water.\r\n7. Little did James think of the danger into which he was\r\nrunning. Soon the wind began to blow, and none of them\r\nknew how to manage the boat.\r\n\r\n8. For some time, they struggled against the wind and the\r\ntide. At last, they became so tired that they could row no\r\nlonger.\r\n9. A large wave upset the boat, and they were all thrown\r\ninto the water. Think of James Brown, the truant, at this\r\ntime!\r\n10. He was far from home, known by no one. His parents\r\nwere ignorant of his danger.\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t29\r\nHe was struggling in the water, on the point of being\r\ndrowned.\r\n11. Some men, however, saw the boys, and went out to\r\nthem in a boat. They reached them just in time to save them\r\nfrom a watery grave.\r\n12. They were taken into a house, where their clothes\r\nwere dried. After a while, they were sent home to their\r\nparents.\r\n13. James was very sorry for his conduct, and he was\r\nnever known to be guilty of the same thing again.\r\n14. He became regular at school, learned to attend to his\r\nbooks, and, above all, to obey his parents perfectly.\r\n\r\nLESSON VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE KITTEN.\r\n\r\n1.  My little white kitten\'s asleep on my knee;\r\nAs white as the snow or the lilies is she;\r\n    She wakes up with a pur\r\n    When I stroke her soft fur:\r\nWas there ever another white kitten like her?\r\n\r\n\t30 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n\r\n2.  My little white kitten now wants to go out\r\nAnd frolic, with no one to watch her about;\r\n    "Little kitten," I say,\r\n   "Just an hour you may stay,\r\nAnd be careful in choosing your places to play."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. But night has come down, when I hear a loud "mew;"\r\nI open the door, and my kitten comes through;\r\n    My white kitten! ah me!\r\n    Can it really be she--\r\nThis ill-looking, beggar-like cat that I see?\r\n\r\n4. What ugly, gray streaks on her side and her back!\r\nHer nose, once as pink as a rosebud, is black!\r\n    Oh, I very well know,\r\n    Though she does not say so,\r\nShe has been where white kittens ought never to go.\r\n\r\n\t\tTHIRD READER. \t31\r\n\r\n5. If little good children intend to do right,\r\nIf little white kittens would keep themselves white,\r\n    It is needful that they\r\n    Should this counsel obey,\r\nAnd be careful in choosing their places to play.\r\n\r\nLESSON IX.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEAVER.\r\n\r\n1. The beaver is found chiefly in North America. It is\r\nabout three and a half feet long, including the flat, paddle-\r\nshaped tail, which is a foot in length.\r\n2. The long, shining hair on the back is chestnut-colored,\r\nwhile the fine, soft fur that lies next the skin, is grayish\r\nbrown.\r\n3. Beavers build themselves most curious huts to live in,\r\nand quite frequently a great number of these huts are placed\r\nclose together, like the buildings in a town.\r\n4. They always build their huts on the banks of rivers or\r\nlakes, for they swim much\r\n\r\n\t32 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\nmore easily than they walk, and prefer moving about in the\r\nwater.\r\n5. When they build on the bank of a running stream, they\r\nmake a dam across the stream for the purpose of keeping the\r\nwater at the height they wish.\r\n6. These dams are made chiefly of mud, and stones, and\r\nthe branches of trees. They are sometimes six or seven\r\nhundred feet in length, and are so constructed that they look\r\nmore like the work of man than of little dumb beasts.\r\n7. Their huts are made of the same material as the dams,\r\nand are round in shape. The walls are very thick, and the\r\nroofs are finished off with a thick layer of mud, sticks, and\r\nleaves.\r\n8. They commence building their houses late in the\r\nsummer, but do not get them finished before the early frosts.\r\nThe freezing makes them tighter and stronger.\r\n9. They obtain the wood for their dams and huts by\r\ngnawing through the branches of trees, and even through the\r\ntrunks of small ones, with their sharp front teeth. They peel\r\noff the bark, and lay it up in store for winter food.\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t33\r\n10. The fur of the beaver is highly prized. The men who\r\nhunt these animals are called trappers.\r\n11. A gentleman once saw five young beavers playing.\r\nThey would leap on the trunk of a tree that lay near a beaver\r\ndam, and would push one another off into the water.\r\n\r\n12. He crept forward very cautiously, and was about to\r\nfire on the little creatures; but their amusing tricks reminded\r\nhim so much of some little children he knew at home, that he\r\nthought it would be inhuman to kill them. So he left them\r\nwithout even disturbing their play.\r\n\r\n3,3\r\n\r\n\t34 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n\r\nLESSON X.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG TEACHER.\r\n\r\n1. Charles Rose lived in the country with his father, who\r\ntaught him to read and to write.\r\n2. Mr. Rose told his son that, when his morning lessons\r\nwere over, he might amuse himself for one hour as he\r\npleased.\r\n3. There was a river near by. On its bank stood the hut of a\r\npoor fisherman, who lived by selling fish.\r\n4. His careful wife kept her wheel going early and late.\r\nThey both worked very hard to keep themselves above want.\r\n5. But they were greatly troubled lest their only son\r\nshould never learn to read and to write. They could not teach\r\nhim themselves, and they were too poor to send him to\r\nschool.\r\n6. Charles called at the hut of this fisherman one day, to\r\ninquire about his dog, which was missing.\r\n\r\n\t\tTHIRD READER. \t35\r\n7. He found the little boy, whose name was Joe, sitting by\r\nthe table, on which he was making marks with a piece of\r\nchalk. Charles asked him whether he was drawing pictures.\r\n\r\n8. "No, I am trying to write," said little Joe, "but I know\r\nonly two words. Those I saw upon a sign, and I am trying to\r\nwrite them."\r\n9. "If I could only learn to read and write," said he, "I\r\nshould be the happiest boy in the world."\r\n\r\n\t36 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n10. "Then I will make you happy," said Charles. "I am\r\nonly a little boy, but I can teach you that.\r\n11. "My father gives me an hour every day for myself.\r\nNow, if you will try to learn, you shall soon know how to\r\nread and to write."\r\n12. Both Joe and his mother were ready to fall on their\r\nknees to thank Charles. They told him it was what they\r\nwished above all things.\r\n13. So, on the next day when the hour came, Charles put\r\nhis book in his pocket, and went to teach Joe. Joe learned\r\nvery fast, and Charles soon began to teach him how to write.\r\n14. Some time after, a gentleman called on Mr. Rose, and\r\nasked him if he knew where Charles was. Mr. Rose said that\r\nhe was taking a walk, he supposed.\r\n15. "I am afraid," said the gentleman, "that he does not\r\nalways amuse himself thus. I often see him go to the house\r\nof the fisherman. I fear he goes out in their boat."\r\n16. Mr. Rose was much troubled. He had told Charles that\r\nhe must never venture on the river, and he thought he could\r\ntrust him.\r\n\r\n\t\tTHIRD READER. \t37\r\n17. The moment the gentleman left, Mr. Rose went in\r\nsearch of his son. He went to the river, and walked up and\r\ndown, in hope of seeing the boat.\r\n18. Not seeing it, he grew uneasy. He thought Charles\r\nmust have gone a long way off. Unwilling to leave without\r\nlearning something of him, he went to the hut.\r\n19. He put his head in at the window, which was open.\r\nThere a pleasant sight met his eyes.\r\n20. Charles was at the table, ruling a copybook Joe was\r\nreading to him, while his mother was spinning in the corner.\r\n21. Charles was a little confused. He feared his father\r\nmight not be pleased; but he had no need to be uneasy, for\r\nhis father was delighted.\r\n22. The next day, his father took him to town, and gave\r\nhim books for himself and Joe, with writing paper, pens, and\r\nink.\r\n23. Charles was the happiest boy in the world when he\r\ncame home. He ran to Joe, his hands filled with parcels, and\r\nhis heart beating with joy.\r\n\r\n\t38 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n\r\nLESSON XI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BLACKSMITH.\r\n\r\n1. Clink, clink, clinkerty clink!\r\nWe begin to hammer at morning\'s blink,\r\nAnd hammer away\r\nTill the busy day,\r\nLike us, aweary, to rest shall sink.\r\n\r\n2. Clink, clink, clinkerty clink!\r\nFrom labor and care we never will shrink;\r\nBut our fires we\'ll blow\r\nTill our forges glow\r\nWith light intense, while our eyelids wink.\r\n\r\n\t\tTHIRD READER. \t39\r\n\r\n3. Clink, clink, clinkerty clink;\r\nThe chain we\'ll forge with many a link.\r\nWe\'ll work each form\r\nWhile the iron is warm,\r\nWith strokes as fast as we can think.\r\n\r\n4. Clink, clink, clinkerty clink!\r\nOur faces may be as black as ink,\r\nBut our hearts are true\r\nAs man ever knew,\r\nAnd kindly of all we shall ever think.\r\n\r\nLESSON XII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA WALK IN THE GARDEN.\r\n\r\n1. Frank was one day walking with his mother, when they\r\ncame to a pretty garden. Frank looked in, and saw that it had\r\nclean gravel walks, and beds of beautiful flowers all in\r\nbloom.\r\n2. He called to his mother, and said, "Mother, come and\r\nlook at this pretty garden. I wish I might open the gate, and\r\nwalk in."\r\n\r\n\t40 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n3. The gardener, being near, heard what Frank said, and\r\nkindly invited him and his mother to come into the garden.\r\n4. Frank\'s mother thanked the man. Turning to her son,\r\nshe said, "Frank, if I take you to walk in this garden, you\r\nmust take care not to meddle with anything in it."\r\n\r\n5. Frank walked along the neat gravel paths, and looked at\r\neverything, but touched nothing that he saw.\r\n6. He did not tread on any of the borders, and was careful\r\nthat his clothes should not brush the tops of the flowers, lest\r\nhe might break them.\r\n\r\n\t\tTHIRD READER. \t41\r\n7. The gardener was much pleased with Frank, because he\r\nwas so careful not to do mischief. He showed him the seeds,\r\nand told him the name of many of the flowers and plants.\r\n8. While Frank was admiring the beauty of a flower, a boy\r\ncame to the gate, and finding it locked, he shook it hard. But\r\nit would not open. Then he said, "Let me in; let me in; will\r\nyou not let me in this garden?"\r\n9. "No, indeed," said the gardener, "I will not let you in, I\r\nassure you; for when I let you in yesterday, you meddled\r\nwith my flowers, and pulled some of my rare fruit. I do not\r\nchoose to let a boy into my garden who meddles with the\r\nplants."\r\n10. The boy looked ashamed, and when he found that the\r\ngardener would not let him in, he went slowly away.\r\n11. Frank saw and felt how much happier a boy may be by\r\nnot meddling with what does not belong to him.\r\n12. He and his mother then continued their walk in the\r\ngarden, and enjoyed the day very much. Before they left, the\r\ngardener gave each of them some pretty flowers.\r\n\r\n42 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n\r\nLESSON XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WOLF.\r\n1. A boy was once taking care of some sheep, not far from\r\na forest. Near by was a village, and he was told to call for\r\nhelp if there was any danger.\r\n2. One day, in order to have some fun, he cried out, with\r\nall his might, "The wolf is coming! the wolf is coming!"\r\n3. The men came running with clubs and axes to destroy\r\nthe wolf. As they saw nothing they went home again, and\r\nleft John laughing in his sleeve.\r\n4. As he had had so much fun this time, John cried out\r\nagain, the next day, "The wolf! the wolf!"\r\n5. The men came again, but not so many as the first time.\r\nAgain they saw no trace of the wolf; so they shook their\r\nheads, and went back.\r\n6. On the third day, the wolf came in earnest. John cried in\r\ndismay, "Help! help!\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t43\r\nthe wolf! the wolf!" But not a single man came to help him.\r\n7. The wolf broke into the flock, and killed\r\n\r\na great many sheep. Among them was a beautiful lamb,\r\nwhich belonged to John.\r\n8. Then he felt very sorry that he had deceived his friends\r\nand neighbors, and grieved over the loss of his pet lamb.\r\n\r\nThe truth itself is not believed,\r\nFrom one who often has deceived.\r\n\r\n44 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n\r\nLESSON XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LITTLE BIRD\'S SONG.\r\n\r\n1. A little bird, with feathers brown,\r\nSat singing on a tree;\r\nThe song was very soft and low,\r\nBut sweet as it could be.\r\n\r\n2. The people who were passing by,\r\nLooked up to see the bird\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t45\r\n\r\nThat made the sweetest melody\r\nThat ever they had heard.\r\n3. But all the bright eyes looked in vain;\r\nBirdie was very small,\r\nAnd with his modest, dark-brown coat,\r\nHe made no show at all.\r\n4. "Why, father," little Gracie said\r\n"Where can the birdie be?\r\nIf  I could sing a song like that,\r\nI\'d sit where folks could see."\r\n5. "I hope my little girl will learn\r\nA lesson from the bird,\r\nAnd try to do what good she can,\r\nNot to be seen or heard.\r\n6. "This birdie is content to sit\r\nUnnoticed on the way,\r\nAnd sweetly sing his Maker\'s praise\r\nFrom dawn to close of day.\r\n7. "So live, my child, all through your life,\r\nThat, be it short or long,\r\nThough others may forget your looks,\r\nThey\'ll not forget your song."\r\n\r\n46 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n\r\nLESSON XV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHARRY AND ANNIE.\r\n1. Harry and Annie lived a mile from town, but they went\r\nthere to school every day. It was a pleasant walk down the\r\nlane, and through the meadow by the pond.\r\n2. I hardly know whether they liked it better in summer or\r\nin winter. They used to pretend that they were travelers\r\nexploring a new country, and would scatter leaves on\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t47\r\nthe road that they might find their way back again.\r\n3. When the ice was thick and firm, they went across the\r\npond. But their mother did not like to have them do this\r\nunless some one was with them.\r\n4. "Do n\'t go across the pond to-day, children," she said,\r\nas she kissed them and bade them good-by one morning; "it\r\nis beginning to thaw."\r\n5. "All right, mother," said Harry, not very good-\r\nnaturedly, for he was very fond of running and sliding on the\r\nice. When they came to the pond, the ice looked hard and\r\nsafe.\r\n6. "There," said he to his sister, "I knew it had n\'t thawed\r\nany. Mother is always afraid we shall be drowned. Come\r\nalong, we will have a good time sliding. The school bell will\r\nnot ring for an hour at least."\r\n7.  "But you promised mother," said Annie.\r\n8.  "No, I did n\'t. I only said \'All right,\' and it is all right."\r\n9. "I did n\'t say anything; so I can do as I like," said\r\nAnnie.\r\n10. So they stepped on the ice, and started to go across the\r\npond. They had not gone\r\n\r\n\r\n\t48 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\nfar before the ice gave way, and they fell into the water.\r\n11. A man who was at work near the shore, heard the\r\nscreams of the children, and plunged into the water to save\r\nthem. Harry managed to get to the shore without any help,\r\nbut poor Annie was nearly drowned before the man could\r\nreach her.\r\n12. Harry went home almost frozen, and told his mother\r\nhow disobedient he had been. He remembered the lesson\r\nlearned that day as long as he lived.\r\n\r\nLESSON XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nBIRD FRIENDS.\r\n1. I once knew a man who was rich in his love for birds,\r\nand in their love for him. He lived in the midst of a grove\r\nfull of all kinds of trees. He had no wife or children in his\r\nhome.\r\n2. He was an old man with gray beard, blue and kind eyes,\r\nand a voice that the\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t49\r\nbirds loved; and this was the way he made them his friends.\r\n3. While he was at work with a rake on his nice walks in\r\nthe grove, the birds came\r\n\r\nclose to him to pick up the worms in the fresh earth he dug\r\nup. At first, they kept a rod or two from him, but they soon\r\nfound he was a kind man, and would not hurt them, but liked\r\nto have them near him.\r\n3. 4.\r\n\r\n\t50 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n4. They knew this by his kind eyes and voice, which tell\r\nwhat is in the heart. So, day by day their faith in his love\r\ngrew in them.\r\n5. They came close to the rake. They would hop on top of\r\nit to be first at the worm. They would turn up their eyes into\r\nhis when he spoke to them, as if they said, "He is a kind\r\nman; he loves us; we need not fear him."\r\n6. All the birds of the grove were soon his fast friends.\r\nThey were on the watch for him, and would fly down from\r\nthe green tree tops to greet him with their chirp.\r\n7. When he had no work on the walks to do with his rake\r\nor his hoe, he took crusts of bread with him, and dropped the\r\ncrumbs on the ground. Down they would dart on his head\r\nand feet to catch them as they fell from his hand.\r\n8  He showed me how they loved him. He put a crust of\r\nbread in his mouth, with one end of it out of his lips. Down\r\nthey came like bees at a flower, and flew off with it crumb\r\nby crumb.\r\n9. When they thought he slept too long in the morning,\r\nthey would fly in and sit\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t51\r\non the bedpost, and call him up with their chirp.\r\n10. They went with him to church, and while he said his\r\nprayers and sang his hymns in it, they sat in the trees, and\r\nsang their praises to the same good God who cares for them\r\nas he does for us.\r\n11. Thus the love and trust of birds were a joy to him all\r\nhis life long; and such love and trust no boy or girl can fail to\r\nwin with the same kind heart, voice, and eye that he had.\r\n\r\nAdapted from Elihu Burritt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XVII.\r\n\r\nWHAT THE MINUTES SAY.\r\n\r\n1.  We are but minutes--little things!\r\nEach one furnished with sixty wings,\r\nWith which we fly on our unseen track,\r\nAnd not a minute ever comes back.\r\n\r\n2.  We are but minutes; use us well,\r\nFor how we are used we must one day tell.\r\nWho uses minutes, has hours to use;\r\nWho loses minutes, whole years must lose.\r\n\r\n\t52 \tECLECTIC SERIES\r\n\r\nLESSON XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WIDOW AND THE MERCHANT.\r\n1. A merchant, who was very fond of music, was asked by\r\na poor widow to give her some assistance. Her husband, who\r\nwas a musician, had died, and left her very poor indeed.\r\n2. The merchant saw that the widow and her daughter,\r\nwho was with her, were in great\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t53\r\ndistress. He looked with pity into their pale faces, and was\r\nconvinced by their conduct that their sad story was true.\r\n3. "How much do you want, my good woman?" said the\r\nmerchant.\r\n4. "Five dollars will save us," said the poor widow, with\r\nsome hesitation.\r\n5. The merchant sat down at his desk, took a piece of\r\npaper, wrote a few lines on it, and gave it to the widow with\r\nthe words, "Take it to the bank you see on the other side of\r\nthe street."\r\n6. The grateful widow and her daughter, without stopping\r\nto read the note, hastened to the bank. The banker at once\r\ncounted out fifty dollars instead of five, and passed them to\r\nthe widow.\r\n7. She was amazed when she saw so much money. "Sir,\r\nthere is a mistake here," she said. "You have given me fifty\r\ndollars, and I asked for only five."\r\n8. The banker looked at the note once more, and said,\r\n"The check calls for fifty dollars."\r\n9. "It is a mistake--indeed it is," said the widow.\r\n10. The banker then asked her to wait\r\n\r\n\t54 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\na few minutes, while he went to see the merchant who gave\r\nher the note.\r\n11. "Yes." said the merchant, when he had heard the\r\nbanker\'s story, "I did make a mistake. I wrote fifty instead of\r\nfive hundred. Give the poor widow five hundred dollars, for\r\nsuch honesty is poorly rewarded with even that sum."\r\nLESSON XIX.\r\n\r\nTHE BIRDS SET FREE.\r\n1. A man was walking one day through a large city. On a\r\nstreet corner he saw a boy with a number of small birds for\r\nsale, in a cage.\r\n2. He looked with sadness upon the little prisoners flying\r\nabout the cage, peeping through the wires, beating them with\r\ntheir wings, and trying to get out.\r\n3. He stood for some time looking at the birds. At last he\r\nsaid to the boy, "How much do you ask for your birds?"\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t55\r\n4. "Fifty cents apiece, sir," said the boy. "I do not mean\r\nhow much apiece," said the man, "but how much for all of\r\nthem? I want to buy them all."\r\n5. The boy began to count, and found they came to five\r\ndollars. "There is your money,"\r\n\r\nsaid the man. The boy took it, well pleased with his\r\nmorning\'s trade.\r\n6. No sooner was the bargain settled than the man opened\r\nthe cage door, and let all the birds fly away.\r\n7. The boy, in great surprise, cried, "What did you do that\r\nfor, sir? You have lost all your birds."\r\n\r\n\t56 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n8. "I will tell you why I did it," said the man. "I was shut\r\nup three years in a French prison, as a prisoner of war, and I\r\nam resolved never to see anything in prison which I can\r\nmake free."\r\nLESSON XX.\r\n\r\n\r\nA MOMENT TOO LATE.\r\n\r\n1. A moment too late, my beautiful bird,\r\nA moment too late are you now;\r\nThe wind has your soft, downy nest disturbed--\r\nThe nest that you hung on the bough.\r\n\r\n2. A moment too late; that string in your bill,\r\nWould have fastened it firmly and strong;\r\nBut see, there it goes, rolling over the hill!\r\nOh, you staid a moment too long.\r\n\r\n3. A moment, one moment too late, busy bee;\r\nThe honey has dropped from the flower:\r\nNo use to creep under the petals and see;\r\nIt stood ready to drop for an hour.\r\n\r\n4. A moment too late; had you sped on your wing,\r\nThe honey would not have been gone;\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t57\r\n\r\nNow you see what a very, a very sad thing\r\n \'T is to stay a moment too long.\r\n\r\n5. Little girl, never be a moment too late,\r\nIt will soon end in trouble or crime;\r\nBetter be an hour early, and stand and wait,\r\nThan a moment behind the time.\r\n\r\n6. If the bird and the bee, little boy, were too late,\r\nRemember, as you play along\r\nOn your way to school, with pencil and slate,\r\nNever stay a moment too long.\r\n\r\nLESSON XXI.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUMMING BIRDS.\r\n1. The most beautiful humming birds are found in the\r\nWest Indies and South America. The crest of the tiny head of\r\none of these shines like a sparkling crown of colored light.\r\n2. The shades of color that adorn its breast, are equally\r\nbrilliant. As the bird\r\n\r\n\t58 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\nflits from one object to another, it looks more like a bright\r\nflash of sunlight than it does like a living being.\r\n3. But, you ask, why are they called humming birds? It is\r\nbecause they make a soft, humming noise by the rapid\r\nmotion of their wings--a motion so rapid, that as they fly you\r\ncan only see that they have wings.\r\n4. One day when walking in the woods, I found the nest of\r\none of the smallest humming birds. It was about half the size\r\nof a very small hen\'s egg, and\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t59\r\nwas attached to a twig no thicker than a steel knitting needle.\r\n5. It seemed to have been made of cotton fibers, and was\r\ncovered with the softest bits of leaf and bark. It had two eggs\r\nin it, quite white, and each about as large as a small\r\nsugarplum.\r\n6. When you approach the spot where one of these birds\r\nhas built its nest, it is necessary to be careful. The mother\r\nbird will dart at you and try to peck your eyes. Its sharp beak\r\nmay hurt your eyes most severely, and even destroy the\r\nsight.\r\n7. The poor little thing knows no other way of defending\r\nits young, and instinct teaches it that you might carry off its\r\nnest if you could find it.\r\n\r\nLESSON XXII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WIND AND THE SUN.\r\nA FABLE.\r\n1. A dispute once arose between the Wind and the Sun, as\r\nto which was the stronger.\r\n\r\n\t60 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n2. To decide the matter, they agreed to try their power on\r\na traveler. That party which should first strip him of his\r\ncloak, was to win the day.\r\n3. The Wind began. He blew a cutting blast, which tore up\r\nthe mountain oaks by their roots, and made the whole forest\r\nlook like a wreck.\r\n4. But the traveler, though at first he could scarcely keep\r\nhis cloak on his back, ran under a hill for shelter, and\r\nbuckled his mantle about him more closely.\r\n5. The Wind having thus tried his utmost power in vain,\r\nthe Sun began.\r\n6. Bursting through a thick cloud, he darted his sultry\r\nbeams so forcibly upon the traveler\'s head, that the poor\r\nfellow was almost melted.\r\n7. "This," said he, "is past all bearing. It is so hot, that one\r\nmight as well be in an oven."\r\n8. So he quickly threw off his cloak, and went into the\r\nshade of a tree to cool himself.\r\n9. This fable teaches us, that gentle means will often\r\nsucceed where forcible ones will fail.\r\n\r\n\t\tTHIRD READER. \t61\r\n\r\nLESSON XXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUNSET.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t62 \tECLECTIC SERIES,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEAUTIFUL HANDS.\r\n1. "O Miss Roberts! what coarse-looking hands Mary\r\nJessup has!" said Daisy Marvin, as she walked home from\r\nschool with her teacher.\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t63\r\n2. "In my opinion, Daisy, Mary\'s hands are the prettiest in\r\nhe class."\r\n3. "Why, Miss Roberts, they are as red and hard as they\r\ncan be. How they would look if she were to try to play on a\r\npiano!" exclaimed Daisy.\r\n4. Miss Roberts took Daisy\'s hands in hers, and said,\r\n"Your hands are very soft and white, Daisy--just the hands to\r\nlook beautiful on a piano; yet they lack one beauty that\r\nMary\'s hands have. Shall I tell you what the difference is?"\r\n5.  "Yes, please, Miss Roberts."\r\n6. "Well, Daisy, Mary\'s hands are always busy. They wash\r\ndishes; they make fires; they hang out clothes, and help to\r\nwash them, too; they sweep, and dust, and sew; they are\r\nalways trying to help her poor, hard-working mother.\r\n7. "Besides, they wash and dress the children; they mend\r\ntheir toys and dress their dolls; yet, they find time to bathe\r\nthe head of the little girl who is so sick in the next house to\r\ntheirs.\r\n8.

I\r\nhave seen them patting the tired horse and the lame dog in\r\nthe street.\r\n\r\n\t64 \tECLECTIC SERIES,\r\n\r\n\r\nThey are always ready to help those who need help."\r\n9. "I shall never think Mary\'s hands are ugly any more,\r\nMiss Roberts."\r\n10. "I am glad to hear you say that, Daisy; and I must tell\r\nyou that they are beautiful because they do their work gladly\r\nand cheerfully."\r\n11. "O Miss Roberts! I feel so ashamed of myself, and so\r\nsorry," said Daisy, looking into her teacher\'s face with\r\ntearful eyes.\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t65\r\n12. "Then, my dear, show your sorrow by deeds of\r\nkindness. The good alone are really beautiful."\r\n\r\nLESSON XXV.\r\n\r\nTHINGS TO REMEMBER.\r\n1. When you rise in the morning, remember who kept you\r\nfrom danger during the night. Remember who watched over\r\nyou while you slept, and whose sun shines around you, and\r\ngives you the sweet light of day.\r\n2. Let God have the thanks of your heart, for his kindness\r\nand his care; and pray for his protection during the wakeful\r\nhours of day.\r\n3. Remember that God made all creatures to be happy, and\r\nwill do nothing that may prevent their being so, without\r\ngood reason for it.\r\n4. When you are at the table, do not eat in a greedy\r\nmanner, like a pig. Eat quietly,\r\n3,5\r\n\r\n66 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\nand do not reach forth your hand for the food, but ask some\r\none to help you.\r\n5. Do not become peevish and pout, because you do not\r\nget a part of everything. Be satisfied with what is given you.\r\n6. Avoid a pouting face, angry looks, and angry words. Do\r\nnot slam the doors. Go quietly up and down stairs; and never\r\nmake a loud noise about the house.\r\n7. Be kind and gentle in your manners; not like the\r\nhowling winter storm, but like the bright summer morning.\r\n8. Do always as your parents bid you. Obey them with a\r\nready mind, and with a pleasant face.\r\n9. Never do anything that you would be afraid or ashamed\r\nthat your parents should know. Remember, if no one else\r\nsees you, God does, from whom you can not hide even your\r\nmost secret thought.\r\n10. At night, before you go to sleep, think whether you\r\nhave done anything that was wrong during the day, and pray\r\nto God to forgive you. If anyone has done you wrong,\r\nforgive him in your heart.\r\n11. If you have not learned something useful, or been in\r\nsome way useful, during\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t67\r\nthe past day, think that it is a day lost, and be very sorry for\r\nit.\r\n12. Trust in the Lord, and He will guide you in the way of\r\ngood men. The path of the just is as the shining light that\r\nshineth more and more unto the perfect day.\r\n13. We must do all the good we can to all men, for this is\r\nwell pleasing in the sight of God. He delights to see his\r\nchildren walk in love, and do good one to another.\r\n\r\nLESSON XXVI.\r\n\r\nTHREE LITTLE MICE.\r\n1. I will tell you the story of three little mice,\r\nIf you will keep still and listen to me,\r\nWho live in a cage that is cozy and nice,\r\nAnd are just as cunning as cunning can be.\r\nThey look very wise, with their pretty red eyes,\r\nThat seem just exactly like little round beads;\r\nThey are white as the snow, and stand up in a row\r\nWhenever we do not attend to their needs;--\r\n\r\n\t68 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Stand up in a row in a comical way,--\r\nNow folding their forepaws as if saying, "please;"\r\nNow rattling the lattice, as much as to say,\r\n"We shall not stay here without more bread and\r\ncheese,"\r\nThey are not at all shy, as you\'ll find, if you try\r\nTo make them run up in their chamber to bed;\r\nIf they do n\'t want to go, why, they won\'t go--ah! no,\r\nThough you tap with your finger each queer little\r\nhead.\r\n3. One day as I stood by the side of the cage,\r\nThrough the bars there protruded a funny, round tail;\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t69\r\n\r\nJust for mischief I caught it, and soon; in a rage,\r\nIts owner set up a most pitiful wail.\r\nHe looked in dismay,--there was something to pay,--\r\nBut what was the matter he could not make out;\r\nWhat was holding him so, when he wanted to go\r\nTo see what his brothers upstairs were about?\r\n\r\n4. But soon from the chamber the others rushed down,\r\nImpatient to learn what the trouble might be;\r\nI have not a doubt that each brow wore a frown,\r\nOnly frowns on their brows are not easy to see.\r\nFor a moment they gazed, perplexed and amazed;\r\nThen began both together to--gnaw off the tail!\r\nSo, quick I released him,--do you think that it pleased\r\nhim?\r\nAnd up the small staircase they fled like a gale.\r\nJulia C. R. Dorr.\r\nLESSON XXVII.\r\n\r\nTHE NEW YEAR.\r\n1. One pleasant New-year morning, Edward rose, and\r\nwashed and dressed himself\r\n\r\n\t70 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\nin haste. He wanted to be first to wish a happy New Year.\r\n2. He looked in every room, and shouted the words of\r\nwelcome. He ran into the\r\n\r\nstreet, to repeat them to those he might meet.\r\n3. When he came back, his father gave him two bright,\r\nnew silver dollars.\r\n4. His face lighted up as he took them. He had wished for\r\na long time to buy some pretty books that he had seen at the\r\nbookstore.\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t71\r\n5. He left the house with a light heart, intending to buy the\r\nbooks.\r\n6. As he ran down the street, he saw a poor German\r\nfamily, the father, mother, and three children shivering with\r\ncold.\r\n7. "I wish you a happy New Year," said Edward, as he\r\nwas gayly passing on. The man shook his head.\r\n8. "You do not belong to this country," said Edward. The\r\nman again shook his head, for he could not understand or\r\nspeak our language.\r\n9. But he pointed to his mouth, and to the children, as if to\r\nsay, "These little ones have had nothing to eat for a long\r\ntime."\r\n10. Edward quickly understood that these poor people\r\nwere in distress. He took out his dollars, and gave one to the\r\nman, and the other to his wife.\r\n11. How their eyes sparkled with gratitude! They said\r\nsomething in their language, which doubtless meant, "We\r\nthank you a thousand times, and will remember you in our\r\nprayers."\r\n12. When Edward came home, his father asked what\r\nbooks he had bought. He hung his head a moment, but\r\nquickly looked up.\r\n\r\n\t72 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n13. "I have bought no books," said he, "I gave my money\r\nto some poor people, who seemed to be very hungry and\r\nwretched.\r\n14. "I think I can wait for my books till next New Year.\r\nOh, if you had seen how glad they were to receive the\r\nmoney!"\r\n15. "My dear boy;" said his father, "here is a whole bundle\r\nof books. I give them to you, more as a reward for your\r\ngoodness of heart than as a New-year gift.\r\n16. "I saw you give the money to the poor German family.\r\nIt was no small sum for a little boy to give cheerfully.\r\n17. "Be thus ever ready to help the poor, and wretched,\r\nand distressed; and every year of your life will be to you a\r\nhappy New Year."\r\nLESSON XXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CLOCK AND THE SUNDIAL.\r\nA FABLE.\r\n1. One gloomy day, the clock on a church steeple, looking\r\ndown on a sundial, said,\r\n\r\n\t\tTHIRD READER. \t73\r\n"How stupid it is in you to stand there all the while like a\r\nstock!\r\n2. "You never tell the hour till a bright sun looks forth\r\nfrom the sky, and gives you leave. I go merrily round, day\r\nand night, in summer and winter the same, without asking\r\nhis leave.\r\n3. "I tell the people the time to rise, to go to dinner, and to\r\ncome to church.\r\n\r\n\r\n\t74 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n4. "Hark! I am going to strike now; one, two, three, four.\r\nThere it is for you. How silly you look! You can say\r\nnothing."\r\n5. The sun, at that moment, broke forth from behind a\r\ncloud, and showed, by the sundial, that the clock was half an\r\nhour behind the right time.\r\n6. The boasting clock now held his tongue, and the dial\r\nonly smiled at his folly.\r\n7. MORAL.--Humble modesty is more often right than a\r\nproud and boasting spirit.\r\n\r\nLESSON XXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMEMBER.\r\n1. Remember, child, remember,\r\nThat God is in the sky;\r\nThat He looks down on all we do,\r\nWith an ever-wakeful eye.\r\n\r\n2. Remember, oh remember,\r\nThat, all the day and night,\r\nHe sees our thoughts and actions\r\nWith an ever-watchful sight.\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t75\r\n\r\n3. Remember, child, remember,\r\nThat God is good and true;\r\nThat He wishes us to always be\r\nLike Him in all we do.\r\n\r\n4. Remember that He ever hates\r\nA falsehood or a lie;\r\nRemember He will punish, too,\r\nThe wicked, by and by.\r\n\r\n5. Remember, oh remember,\r\nThat He is like a friend,\r\nAnd wishes us to holy be,\r\nAnd happy, in the end.\r\n\r\n6. Remember, child, remember,\r\nTo pray to Him in heaven;\r\nAnd if you have been doing wrong,\r\nOh, ask to be forgiven.\r\n\r\n7. Be sorry, in your little prayer,\r\nAnd whisper in his ear;\r\nAsk his forgiveness and his love.\r\nAnd He will surely hear.\r\n\r\n8. Remember, child, remember,\r\nThat you love, with all your might,\r\n\r\n\t76 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n\r\nThe God who watches o\'er us,\r\nAnd gives us each delight;\r\nWho guards us ever through the day,\r\nAnd saves us in the night.\r\n\r\nLESSON XXX..\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOURAGE AND COWARDICE.\r\n1. Robert and Henry were going home from school, when,\r\non turning a corner, Robert cried out, "A fight! let us go and\r\nsee!"\r\n\r\n\tECLECTIC READER. \t77\r\n2. "No," said Henry; "let us go quietly home and not\r\nmeddle with this quarrel. We have nothing to do with it, and\r\nmay get into mischief."\r\n3. "You are a coward, and afraid to go," said Robert, and\r\noff he ran. Henry went straight home, and in the afternoon\r\nwent to school, as usual.\r\n4. But Robert had told all the boys that Henry was a\r\ncoward, and they laughed at him a great deal.\r\n5. Henry had learned, however, that true courage is shown\r\nmost in bearing reproach when not deserved, and that he\r\nought to be afraid of nothing but doing wrong.\r\n6. A few days after, Robert was bathing with some\r\nschoolmates, and got out of his depth. He struggled, and\r\nscreamed for help, but all in vain.\r\n7. The boys who had called Henry a coward, got out of the\r\nwater as fast as they could, but they did not even try to help\r\nhim.\r\n8. Robert was fast sinking, when Henry threw off his\r\nclothes, and sprang into the water. He reached Robert just as\r\nhe was sinking the last time.\r\n\r\n\t78 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n9. By great effort, and with much danger to himself, he\r\nbrought Robert to thc shore, and thus saved his life.\r\n10. Robert and his schoolmates were ashamed at having\r\ncalled Henry a coward. They owned that he had more\r\ncourage than any of them.\r\n11. Never be afraid to do good, but always fear to do evil.\r\n\r\nLESSON XXXI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWEIGHING AN ELEPHANT.\r\n1. "An eastern king," said Teddy\'s mother, "had been\r\nsaved from some great danger. To show his gratitude for\r\ndeliverance, he vowed he would give to the poor the weight\r\nof his favorite elephant in silver."\r\n2. "Oh! what a great quantity that would be," cried Lily,\r\nopening her eyes very wide.\r\n"But how could you weigh an elephant?"\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t\t79\r\nasked Teddy, who was a quiet, thoughtful boy\r\n3. "There was the difficulty," said his mother. "The wise\r\nand learned men of the court stroked their long beards, and\r\ntalked the matter over, but no one found out how to weigh\r\nthe elephant.\r\n4. "At last, a poor old sailor found safe and simple means\r\nby which to weigh the enormous beast. The thousands and\r\nthousands of pieces of silver were counted out to the people;\r\nand crowds of the poor were relieved by the clever thought\r\nof the sailor."\r\n5. "O mamma," said Lily, "do tell us what it was!"\r\n6. "Stop, stop!" said Teddy. "I want to think for myself--\r\nthink hard--and find out how an elephant\'s weight could be\r\nknown, with little trouble and expense."\r\n7. "I am well pleased," said his mother, "that my little boy\r\nshould set his mind to work on the subject. If he can find out\r\nthe sailor\'s secret before night, he shall have that orange for\r\nhis pains."\r\n8. The boy thought hard and long. Lily laughed at her\r\nbrother\'s grave looks, as he sat leaning his head on his hands.\r\nOften\r\n\r\n\t80 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nshe teased him with the question, "Can you weigh an\r\nelephant, Teddy?"\r\n9. At last, while eating his supper, Teddy suddenly cried\r\nout, "I have it now!"\r\n10.  "Do you think so?" asked his mother.\r\n11.  "How would you do it," asked Lily.\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t81\r\n12. "First, I would have a big boat brought very close to\r\nthe shore, and would have planks laid across, so that the\r\nelephant could walk right into it."\r\n13. "Oh, such a great, heavy beast would make it sink low\r\nin the water," said Lily.\r\n14. "Of course it would," said her brother. Then I would\r\nmark on the outside of the boat the exact height to which the\r\nwater had risen all around it while the elephant was inside.\r\nThen he should march on shore, leaving the boat quite\r\nempty."\r\n15. "But I do n\'t see the use of all this," said Lily.\r\n16. "Do n\'t you?" cried Teddy, in surprise. "Why, I should\r\nthen bring the heaps of silver, and throw them into the boat\r\ntill their weight would sink it to the mark made by the\r\nelephant. That would show that the weight of each was the\r\nsame."\r\n17. "How funny!" cried Lily; "you would make a\r\nweighing machine of the boat?"\r\n18. "That is my plan," said Teddy.\r\n19. "That was the sailor\'s plan," said his mother. "You\r\nhave earned the orange, my boy;" and she gave it to him with\r\na smile.\r\nAdapted from A. L. O.

I\'m longing to he:\r\nThe name and the life of a soldier for me!\r\nI would not be living at ease and at play;\r\nTrue honor and glory I\'d win in my day.\r\n\r\n2.  A soldier! a soldier! in armor arrayed;\r\nMy weapons in hand, of no contest afraid;\r\nI\'d ever be ready to strike the first blow,\r\nAnd to fight my way through the ranks of the foe.\r\n\r\n3.  But then, let me tell you, no blood would I shed,\r\nNo victory seek o\'er the dying and dead;\r\nA far braver soldier than this would I be;\r\nA warrior of Truth, in the ranks of the free.\r\n\r\n4.  A soldier! a soldier! Oh, then, let me be!\r\nMy friends, I invite you, enlist now with me.\r\nTruth\'s bands shall be mustered, love\'s foes shall\r\ngive way!\r\nLet\'s up, and be clad in our battle array!\r\nJ. G. Adams.\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t83\r\n\r\nLESSON XXXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ECHO.\r\n1. As Robert was one day rambling about, he happened to\r\ncry out, "Ho, ho!" He instantly heard coming back from a\r\nhill near by, the same words, "Ho, ho!"\r\n2. In great surprise, he said with a loud voice, "Who are\r\nyou?" Upon this, the same words came back, "Who are\r\nyou?"\r\n3. Robert now cried out harshly, "You must be a very\r\nfoolish fellow."  "Foolish fellow!" came back from the hill.\r\n4. Robert became angry, and with loud and fierce words\r\nwent toward the spot whence the sounds came. The words all\r\ncame back to him in the same angry tone.\r\n5. He then went into the thicket, and looked for the boy\r\nwho, as he thought, was mocking him; but he could find\r\nnobody anywhere.\r\n6. When he went home, he told his mothe\r\n\r\n84 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nthat some boy had hid himself in the wood, for the purpose\r\nof mocking him.\r\n7. "Robert," said his mother, "you are angry with yourself\r\nalone. You heard nothing but your own words."\r\n8. "Why, mother, how can that be?" said Robert. "Did you\r\nnever hear an echo?" asked his mother. "An echo, dear\r\nmother? No, ma\'am. What is it?"\r\n9. "I will tell you," said his mother. "You know, when you\r\nplay with your ball,\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t85\r\nand throw it against the side of a house, it bounds back to\r\nyou." "Yes, mother," said he, "and I catch it again."\r\n10. "Well," said his mother, "if I were in the open air, by\r\nthe side of a hill or a large barn, and should speak very loud,\r\nmy voice would be sent back, so that I could hear again the\r\nvery words which I spoke.\r\n11. "That, my son, is an echo. When you thought some\r\none was mocking you, it was only the hill before you,\r\nechoing, or sending back, your own voice.\r\n12. "The bad boy, as you thought it was, spoke no more\r\nangrily than yourself. If you had spoken kindly, you would\r\nhave heard a kind reply.\r\n13. "Had you spoken in a low, sweet, gentle tone, the\r\nvoice that came back would have been as low, sweet, and\r\ngentle as your own.\r\n14. "The Bible says, \'A soft answer turneth away wrath.\'\r\nRemember this when you are at play with your school mates.\r\n15. "If any of them should be offended, and speak in a\r\nloud, angry tone, remember the echo, and let your words be\r\nsoft and kind."\r\n\r\n86 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n16. "When you come home from school, and find your\r\nlittle brother cross and peevish, speak mildly to him. You\r\nwill soon see a smile on his lips, and find that his tones will\r\nbecome mild and sweet.\r\n17. "Whether you are in the fields or in the woods, at\r\nschool or at play, at home or abroad, remember,\r\nThe good and the kind,\r\nBy kindness their love ever proving,\r\nWill dwell with the pure and the loving."\r\n\r\nLESSON XXXIV.\r\n\r\nGEORGE\'S FEAST.\r\n1. George\'s mother was very poor. Instead of having\r\nbright, blazing fires in winter, she had nothing to burn but\r\ndry sticks, which George picked up from under the trees and\r\nhedges.\r\n2. One fine day in July, she sent George to the woods,\r\nwhich were about two miles from the village in which she\r\nlived. He\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t87\r\nwas to stay there all day, to get as much wood as he could\r\ncollect.\r\n3. It was a bright, sunny day, and George worked very\r\nhard; so that by the time the\r\n\r\nsun was high, he was hot, and wished for a cool place where\r\nhe might rest and eat his dinner.\r\n4. While he hunted about the bank he saw among the moss\r\nsome fine, wild strawberries, which were a bright scarlet\r\nwith ripeness.\r\n\r\n\t88 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n5. "How good these will be with my bread and butter!"\r\nthought George; and lining his little cap with leaves, he set\r\nto work eagerly to gather all he could find, and then seated\r\nhimself by the brook.\r\n6. It was a pleasant place, and George felt happy and\r\ncontented. He thought how much his mother would like to\r\nsee him there, and to be there herself, instead of in her dark,\r\nclose room in the village.\r\n7. George thought of all this, and just as he was lifting the\r\nfirst strawberry to his mouth, he said to himself, "How much\r\nmother would like these;" and he stopped, and put the\r\nstrawberry back again.\r\n8. "Shall I save them for her?" said he, thinking how much\r\nthey would refresh her, yet still looking at them with a\r\nlonging eye.\r\n9. "I will eat half, and take the other half to her," said he at\r\nlast; and he divided them into two heaps. But each heap\r\nlooked so small, that he put them together again.\r\n10. "I will only taste one," thought he; but, as he again\r\nlifted it to his mouth, he saw that he had taken the finest, and\r\nhe put it back. "I will keep them all for her,"\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t89\r\nsaid he, and he covered them up nicely, till he should go\r\nhome.\r\n11. When the sun was beginning to sink, George set out\r\nfor home. How happy he felt, then, that he had all his\r\nstrawberries for his sick mother. The nearer he came to his\r\nhome, the less he wished to taste them.\r\n12. Just as he had thrown down his wood, he heard his\r\nmother\'s faint voice calling him from the next room. "Is that\r\nyou, George? I am glad you have come, for I am thirsty, and\r\nam longing for some tea."\r\n13. George ran in to her, and joyfully offered his wild\r\nstrawberries. "And you saved them for your sick mother, did\r\nyou?" said she, laying her hand fondly on his head, while the\r\ntears stood in her eyes. "God will bless you for all this, my\r\nchild."\r\n14. Could the eating of the strawberries have given\r\nGeorge half the happiness he felt at this moment?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t90 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n\r\nLESSON XXXV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LORD\'S PRAYER.\r\n\r\n1.

"It\'s mine," said Fred, showing a white handled\r\npocketknife, with every blade perfect and shining. "Just what\r\nI\'ve always\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t93\r\nwanted." And he turned the prize over and over with evident\r\nsatisfaction.\r\n2. "I guess I know who owns it," said Tom, looking at it\r\nwith a critical eye.\r\n\r\n3. "I guess you do n\'t," was the quick response. "It is n\'t\r\nMr. Raymond\'s," said Fred, shooting wide of the mark.\r\n4. "I know that; Mr. Raymond\'s is twice as large,"\r\nobserved Tom, going on with his drawing lesson.\r\n5. Do you suppose Fred took any comfort in that knife?\r\nNot a bit of comfort did he take. He was conscious all the\r\ntime of having something in his possession that did\r\n\r\n\t94 \tECLECTIC  SERIES.\r\nnot belong to him; and Tom\'s suspicion interfered sadly with\r\nhis enjoyment.\r\n6. Finally, it became such a torment to him, that he had\r\nserious thoughts of burning it, or burying it, or giving it\r\naway; but a better plan suggested itself.\r\n7. "Tom," said he, one day at recess, "did n\'t you say you\r\nthought you knew who owned that knife I found?"\r\n8. "Yes, I did; it looked like Doctor Perry\'s." And Tom ran\r\noff to his play, without giving the knife another thought.\r\n9. Dr. Perry\'s! Why, Fred would have time to go to the\r\ndoctor\'s office before recess closed: so he started in haste,\r\nand found the old gentleman getting ready to visit a patient.\r\n"Is this yours?" cried Fred, in breathless haste, holding up\r\nthe cause of a week\'s anxiety.\r\n10. "It was," said the doctor; "but I lost it the other day."\r\n11. "I found it," said Fred, "and have felt like a thief ever\r\nsince. Here, take it; I\'ve got to run."\r\n12. "Hold on!" said the doctor. "I\'ve got a new one, and\r\nyou are quite welcome to this."\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t95\r\n13. "Am I? May I? Oh! thank you!"  And with what a\r\ndifferent feeling he kept it from that which he had\r\nexperienced for a week!\r\n\r\nLESSON XXXVII.\r\n\r\nBATS.\r\n1. Bats are very strange little animals, having hair like\r\nmice, and wings like birds. During the day, they live in\r\ncrevices of rocks, in caves, and in other dark places.\r\n2. At night, they go forth in search of food; and, no doubt,\r\nyou have seen them flying\r\n\r\n96 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\nabout, catching such insects as happen to be out rather late at\r\nnight.\r\n3. The wings of a bat have no quills. They are only thin\r\npieces of skin stretched upon a framework of bones. Besides\r\nthis, it may be said that while he is a quadruped, he can rise\r\ninto the air and fly from place to place like a bird.\r\n4. There is a funny fable about the bat, founded upon this\r\ndouble character of beast and bird, which I will tell you.\r\n5. An owl was once prowling about, when he came across\r\na bat. So he caught him in his claws, and was about to\r\ndevour him. Upon this, the bat began to squeal terribly; and\r\nhe said to the owl, "Pray, what do you take me for, that you\r\nuse me thus?"\r\n6. "Why, you are a bird, to be sure," said the owl, "and I\r\nam fond of birds. I love dearly to break their little bones."\r\n7. "Well," said the bat, "I thought there was some mistake.\r\nI am no bird. Do n\'t you see, Mr. Owl, that I have no\r\nfeathers, and that I am covered with hair like a mouse?"\r\n8. "Sure enough," said the owl, in great surprise; "I see it\r\nnow. Really, I took you\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t97\r\nfor a bird, but it appears you are only a kind of mouse. I ate a\r\nmouse last night, and it gave me the nightmare. I can\'t bear\r\nmice! Bah! it makes me sick to think of it." So the owl let the\r\nbat go.\r\n\r\n9. The very next night, the bat encountered another\r\ndanger. He was snapped up by puss, who took him for a\r\nmouse, and immediately prepared to eat him.\r\n10. "I beg you to stop one moment," said the bat. "Pray,\r\nMiss Puss, what do you suppose I am?" "A mouse, to be\r\nsure!" said the cat. "Not at all," said the bat, spreading his\r\nlong wings.\r\n11. "Sure enough," said the cat: "you seem to be a bird,\r\nthough your feathers are\r\n3,7.\r\n\r\n\t98 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\nnot very fine. I eat birds sometimes, but I am tired of them\r\njust now, having lately devoured four young robins; so you\r\nmay go. But, bird or mouse, it will be your best policy to\r\nkeep out of my way hereafter."\r\n12. The meaning of this fable is, that a person playing a\r\ndouble part may sometimes escape danger; but he is always,\r\nlike the bat, a creature that is disgusting to everybody, and\r\nshunned by all.\r\nS. G. Goodrich--Adapted.\r\n\r\nLESSON XXXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA SUMMER DAY.\r\n\r\n1.

"I will think of it." It is easy to say this; but do you\r\nknow what great things have come from thinking?\r\n2. We can not see our thoughts, or hear, or taste, or feel\r\nthem; and yet what mighty power they have!\r\n3. Sir Isaac Newton was seated in his garden on a\r\nsummer\'s evening, when he saw an apple fall from a tree. He\r\nbegan to think, and, in trying to find out why the apple fell,\r\ndiscovered how the earth, sun, moon, and stars are kept in\r\ntheir places.\r\n4. A boy named James Watt sat quietly by the fireside,\r\nwatching the lid of the tea kettle as it moved up and down.\r\nHe began to think; he wanted to find out why the steam in\r\nthe kettle moved the heavy lid.\r\n\r\n\t102 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n5. From that time he went on thinking and thinking; and\r\nwhen he became a man, he improved the steam engine so\r\nmuch that it could, with the greatest ease, do the work of\r\nmany horses.\r\n6. When you see a steamboat, a steam mill, or a\r\nlocomotive, remember that it would never have been built if\r\nit had not been for the hard thinking of some one.\r\n7. A man named Galileo was once standing in the\r\ncathedral of Pisa, when he saw a chandelier swaying to and\r\nfro.\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t103\r\n8. This set him thinking, and it led to the invention of the\r\npendulum.\r\n9. James Ferguson was a poor Scotch shepherd boy. Once,\r\nseeing the inside of a watch, he was filled with wonder.\r\n"Why should I not make a watch?" thought he.\r\n10. But how was he to get the materials out of which to\r\nmake the wheels and the mainspring? He soon found how to\r\nget them: he made the mainspring out of a piece of\r\nwhalebone. He then made a wooden clock which kept good\r\ntime.\r\n11. He began, also, to copy pictures with a pen, and\r\nportraits with oil colors. In a few years, while still a small\r\nboy, he earned money enough to support his father.\r\n12. When he became a man, he went to London to live.\r\nSome of the wisest men in England, and the king himself,\r\nused to attend his lectures. His motto was, "I will think of it;"\r\nand he made his thoughts useful to himself and the world.\r\n13. Boys, when you have a difficult lesson to learn, do n\'t\r\nfeel discouraged, and ask some one to help you before\r\nhelping yourselves. Think, and by thinking you will learn\r\nhow to think to some purpose.\r\n\r\n\t104 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\nLESSON XL.\r\nCHARLIE AND ROB.\r\n1. "Do n\'t you hate splitting wood?" asked Charlie, as he\r\nsat down on a log to hinder Rob for a while.\r\n2. "No, I rather like it. When I get hold of a tough old\r\nfellow, I say, \'See here, now, you think you\'re the stronger,\r\nand are going to beat me; so I\'ll split you up into kindling\r\nwood."\r\n3. "Pshaw!" said Charlie, laughing; "and it\'s only a stick\r\nof wood."\r\n4. "Yes; but you see I pretend it\'s a lesson, or a tough job\r\nof any kind, and it\'s nice to conquer it."\r\n5. "I do n\'t want to conquer such things; I do n\'t care what\r\nbecomes of them. I wish I were a man, and a rich one."\r\n6. "Well, Charlie, if you live long enough you\'ll be a man,\r\nwithout wishing for it; and as for the rich part, I mean to be\r\nthat myself."\r\n7. "You do. How do you expect to get your money? By\r\nsawing wood?"\r\n8. "May be--some of it; that\'s as good a\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t105\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nway as any, so long as it lasts. I do n\'t care how I get rich,\r\nyou know, so that it\'s in an honest and useful way."\r\n9. "I\'d like to sleep over the next ten years, and wake up to\r\nfind myself a young man with a splendid education and\r\nplenty of money."\r\n\r\n\t106 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n10. "Humph! I am not sleepy--a night at a time is enough\r\nfor me. I mean to work the next ten years. You see there are\r\nthings that you\'ve got to work out--you can\'t sleep them out."\r\n11. "I hate work," said Charlie, "that is, such work as\r\nsawing and splitting wood, and doing chores. I\'d like to do\r\nsome big work, like being a clerk in a bank or something of\r\nthat sort."\r\n12. "Wood has to be sawed and split before it can be\r\nburned," said Rob. "I do n\'t know but I\'ll be a clerk in a bank\r\nsome time; I\'m working towards it. I\'m keeping father\'s\r\naccounts for him."\r\n13. How Charlie laughed! "I should think that was a long\r\nway from being a bank clerk. I suppose your father sells two\r\ntables and six chairs, some days, does n\'t he?"\r\n14. "Sometimes more than that, and sometimes not so\r\nmuch," said Rob, in perfect good humor.\r\n15. "I did n\'t say I was a bank clerk now.  I said I was\r\nworking towards it. Am I not nearer it by keeping a little bit\r\nof a book than I should be if I did n\'t keep any book at all?"\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t107\r\n16. "Not a whit--such things happen," said Charlie, as he\r\nstarted to go.\r\n17. Now, which of these boys, do you think, grew up to be\r\na rich and useful man, and which of them joined a party of\r\ntramps before he was thirty years old?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XLI.\r\n\r\nRAY AND HIS KITE.\r\n1. Ray was thought to be an odd boy. You will think him\r\nso, too, when you have read this story.\r\n2. Ray liked well enough to play with the boys at school;\r\nyet he liked better to be alone under the shade of some tree,\r\nreading a fairy tale or dreaming daydreams. But there was\r\none sport that he liked as well as his companions; that was\r\nkiteflying.\r\n3. One day when he was flying his kite, he said to himself,\r\n"I wonder if anybody ever tried to fly a kite at night. It seems\r\n\r\n\t108 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\nto me it would be nice. But then, if it were very dark, the kite\r\ncould not be seen. What if I should fasten a light to it,\r\nthough? That would make it show. I\'ll try it this very night."\r\n4. As soon as it was dark, without saying a word to\r\nanybody, he took his kite and lantern, and went to a large,\r\nopen lot, about a quarter of a mile from his home. "Well,"\r\nthought he, "this is queer. How lonely and still it seems\r\nwithout any other boys around! But I am going to fly my\r\nkite, anyway."\r\n5. So he tied the lantern, which was made of tin punched\r\nfull of small holes, to the tail of his kite. Then he pitched the\r\nkite, and,\r\n\r\n\r\n \tTHIRD READER.\t109\r\nafter several attempts, succeeded in making it rise. Up it\r\nwent, higher and higher, as Ray let out the string. When the\r\nstring was all unwound, he tied it to a fence; and then he\r\nstood and gazed at his kite as it floated high up in the air.\r\n6. While Ray was enjoying his sport, some people who\r\nwere out on the street in the village, saw a strange light in\r\nthe sky. They gathered in groups to watch it. Now it was still\r\nfor a few seconds, then it seemed to be jumping up and\r\ndown; then it made long sweeps back and forth through the\r\nair.\r\n7. "What can it be?" said one person. "How strange!" said\r\nanother. "It can not be a comet; for comets have tails," said a\r\nthird. "Perhaps it\'s a big firefly," said another.\r\n8. At last some of the men determined to find out what\r\nthis strange light was--whether it was a hobgoblin dancing in\r\nthe air, or something dropped from the sky. So off they\r\nstarted to get as near it as they could.\r\n9. While this was taking place, Ray, who had got tired of\r\nstanding, was seated in a fence corner, behind a tree. He\r\ncould see\r\n\r\n\t110 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\nthe men as they approached; but they did not see him.\r\n10. When they were directly under the light, and saw what\r\nit was, they looked at each other, laughing, and said, "This is\r\nsome boy\'s trick; and it has fooled us nicely. Let us keep the\r\nsecret, and have our share of the joke."\r\n11. Then they laughed again, and went back to the village;\r\nand some of the simple people there have not yet found out\r\nwhat that strange light was.\r\n12. When thc men had gone, Ray thought it was time for\r\nhim to go; so he wound up his string, picked up his kite and\r\nlantern, and went home. His mother had been wondering\r\nwhat had become of him.\r\n13. When she heard what he had been doing, she hardly\r\nknew whether to laugh or scold; but I think she laughed, and\r\ntold him that it was time for him to go to bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t111\r\n\r\nLESSON XLII.\r\nBEWARE OF THE FIRST DRINK.\r\n\r\n1. "Uncle Philip, as the day is fine, will you take a walk\r\nwith us this morning?"\r\n2. "Yes, boys. Let me get my hat and cane, and we will\r\ntake a ramble. I will tell you a story as we go. Do you know\r\npoor old Tom Smith?"\r\n3. "Know him! Why, Uncle Philip, everybody knows him.\r\nHe is such a shocking drunkard, and swears so horribly."\r\n4. "Well, I have known him ever since we were boys\r\ntogether. There was not a more decent, well-behaved boy\r\namong us. After he left school, his father died, and he was\r\nput into a store in the city. There, he fell into bad company.\r\n5. "Instead of spending his evenings in reading, he would\r\ngo to the theater and to balls. He soon learned to play cards,\r\nand of course to play for money. He lost more than he could\r\npay.\r\n6. "He wrote to his poor mother, and told her his losses.\r\nShe sent him money to pay his debts, and told him to come\r\nhome.\r\n\r\n\t112 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n7. "He did come home. After all, he might still have been\r\nuseful and happy, for his friends were willing to forgive the\r\npast. For a time, things went on well. He married a lovely\r\nwoman, gave up his bad habits, and was doing well.\r\n8. "But one thing, boys, ruined him forever. In the city, he\r\nhad learned to take strong drink, and he said to me once, that\r\nwhen a man begins to drink, he never knows where it will\r\nend. \'Therefore,\' said Tom, \'beware of the first drink!\'\r\n9. "It was not long before he began to follow his old habit.\r\nHe knew the danger, but it seemed as if he could not resist\r\nhis desire to drink. His poor mother soon died of grief and\r\nshame. His lovely wife followed her to the grave.\r\n10. "He lost the respect of all, went on from bad to worse,\r\nand has long been a perfect sot. Last night, I had a letter\r\nfrom the city, stating that Tom Smith had been found guilty\r\nof stealing, and sent to the state prison for ten years.\r\n11. "There I suppose he will die, for he is now old. It is\r\ndreadful to think to what an end he has come. I could not but\r\nthink,\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t113\r\nas I read the letter, of what he said to me years ago, \'Beware\r\nof the first drink!\'\r\n12. "Ah, my dear boys, when old Uncle Philip is gone,\r\nremember that he told you\r\n\r\nthe story of Tom Smith, and said to you, \'Beware of the first\r\ndrink!\' The man who does this will never be a drunkard."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t114 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n\r\nLESSON XLIII.\r\n\r\nSPEAK GENTLY.\r\n\r\n1. Speak gently; it is better far\r\nTo rule by love than fear:\r\nSpeak gently; let no harsh words mar\r\nThe good we might do here.\r\n\r\n2. Speak gently to the little child;\r\nIts love be sure to gain;\r\nTeach it in accents soft and mild;\r\nIt may not long remain.\r\n\r\n3. Speak gently to the aged one;\r\nGrieve not the careworn heart:\r\nThe sands of life are nearly run;\r\nLet such in peace depart.\r\n\r\n4.

A man had seven sons, who were always quarreling.\r\nThey left their studies and work, to quarrel among\r\nthemselves. Some bad men were looking forward to the\r\ndeath of their father, to cheat them out of their property by\r\nmaking them quarrel about it.\r\n2. The good old man, one day, called his sons around him.\r\nHe laid before them seven sticks, which were bound\r\ntogether. He said, "I will pay a hundred dollars to the one\r\nwho can break this bundle."\r\n3. Each one strained every nerve to break the bundle.\r\nAfter a long but vain trial, they all said that it could not be\r\ndone.\r\n\r\n\t116 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n4. "And yet, my boys," said the father, "nothing is easier\r\nto do." He then untied the bundle, and broke the sticks, one\r\nby one, with perfect ease.\r\n\r\n5. "Ah!" said his sons, "it is easy enough to do it so;\r\nanybody could do it in that way."\r\n6. Their father replied, "As it is with these sticks, so is it\r\nwith you, my sons. So\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t117\r\nlong as you hold fast together and aid each other, you will\r\nprosper, and none can injure you.\r\n7.

The home of little Jeannette is far away, high up among\r\nthe mountains. Let us call her our mountain sister.\r\n2. There are many things you would like to hear about her,\r\nbut I can only tell you now how she goes with her father and\r\nbrother, in the autumn, to help gather nuts for the long\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\n\t118 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n3. A little way down the mountain side is a chestnut wood.\r\nDid you ever see a chestnut tree? In the spring its branches\r\nare covered with bunches of  creamy flowers, like long\r\ntassels. All the hot summer these are turning into sweet nuts,\r\nwrapped safely in large, prickly, green balls.\r\n4. But when the frost of autumn comes, these prickly balls\r\nturn brown, and crack open. Then you may see inside one,\r\ntwo, three, and even four, sweet, brown nuts.\r\n5. When her father says, one night at supper time, "I think\r\nthere will be a frost tonight," Jeannette knows very well what\r\nto do. She dances away early in the evening to her little bed,\r\nmade in a box built up against the wall.\r\n6. Soon she falls asleep to dream about\r\n\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t119\r\nthe chestnut wood, and the little brook that springs from rock\r\nto rock down under the tall, dark trees. She wakes with the\r\nfirst daylight, and is out of bed in a minute, when she hears\r\nher father\'s cheerful call, "Come, children; it is time to be\r\noff."\r\n7. Their dinner is ready in a large basket. The donkey\r\nstands before the door with great bags for the nuts hanging at\r\neach side. They go merrily over the crisp, white frost to the\r\nchestnut trees. How the frost has opened the burs! It has\r\ndone half their work for them already.\r\n8. How they laugh and sing, and shout to each other as\r\nthey fill their baskets! The sun looks down through the\r\nyellow leaves; the rocks give them mossy seats; the birds\r\nand squirrels wonder what these strange people are doing in\r\ntheir woods.\r\n9. Jeannette really helps, though she is only a little girl;\r\nand her father says at night, that his Jane is a dear, good\r\nchild. This makes her very happy. She thinks about it at\r\nnight, when she says her prayers. Then she goes to sleep to\r\ndream of the merry autumn days.\r\n10. Such is our little mountain sister, and\r\n\r\n\t120 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nhere is a picture of her far-away home. The mountain life is\r\never a fresh and happy one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t121\r\n\r\nLESSON XLVI.\r\n\r\nHARRY AND THE GUIDEPOST.\r\n\r\n1. The night was dark, the sun was hid\r\nBeneath the mountain gray,\r\nAnd not a single star appeared\r\nTo shoot a silver ray.\r\n\r\n2. Across the heath the owlet flew,\r\nAnd screamed along the blast;\r\nAnd onward, with a quickened step,\r\nBenighted Harry passed.\r\n\r\n3. Now, in thickest darkness plunged,\r\nHe groped his way to find;\r\nAnd now, he thought he saw beyond,\r\nA form of horrid kind.\r\n\r\n4. In deadly white it upward rose,\r\nOf cloak and mantle bare,\r\nAnd held its naked arms across,\r\nTo catch him by the hair.\r\n\r\n5. Poor Harry felt his blood run cold,\r\nAt what before him stood;\r\nBut then, thought he, no harm, I\'m sure,\r\nCan happen to the good.\r\n\r\n\t122 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n\r\n6. So, calling all his courage up,\r\nHe to the monster went;\r\nAnd eager through the dismal gloom\r\nHis piercing eyes he bent.\r\n\r\n7. And when he came well nigh the ghost\r\nThat gave him such affright,\r\nHe clapped his hands upon his side,\r\nAnd loudly laughed outright.\r\n\r\n8.

Ah well, thought he, one thing I\'ve learned,\r\nNor shall I soon forget;\r\nWhatever frightens me again,\r\nI\'ll march straight up to it.\r\n\r\n10.

Amy was a dear little girl, but she was too apt to waste\r\ntime in getting ready to do her tasks, instead of doing them at\r\nonce as she ought.\r\n\r\n\t124 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n2. In the village in which she lived, Mr. Thornton kept a\r\nstore where he sold fruit of all kinds, including berries in\r\ntheir season. One day he said to Amy, whose parents were\r\nquite poor, "Would you like to earn some money? "\r\n3. "Oh, yes," replied she, "for I want some new shoes, and\r\npapa has no money to buy them with."\r\n4. "Well, Amy," said Mr. Thorhton, "I noticed some fine,\r\nripe blackberries in Mr. Green\'s pasture to-day, and he said\r\nthat anybody was welcome to them. I will pay you thirteen\r\ncents a quart for all you will pick for me."\r\n5. Amy was delighted at the thought of earning some\r\nmoney; so she ran home to get a basket, intending to go\r\nimmediately to pick the berries.\r\n6. Then she thought she would like to know how much\r\nmoney she would get if she picked five quarts. With the help\r\nof her slate and pencil, she found out that she would get\r\nsixty-five cents.\r\n7. "But supposing I should pick a dozen quarts," thought\r\nshe, "how much should I earn then?" "Dear me," she said,\r\nafter\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t125\r\nfiguring a while, "I should earn a dollar and fifty-six cents."\r\n8. Amy then found out what Mr. Thornton would pay her\r\nfor fifty, a hundred, and two hundred quarts. It took her some\r\ntime to\r\n\r\ndo this, and then it was so near dinner time that she had to\r\nstay at home until afternoon.\r\n9. As soon as dinner was over, she took\r\n\r\n\t126 \tECLECTIC SERIES,\r\nher basket and hurried to the pasture. Some boys had been\r\nthere before dinner, and all the ripe berries were picked. She\r\ncould not find enough to fill a quart measure.\r\n10. As Amy went home, she thought of what her teacher\r\nhad often told her--"Do your task at once; then think about\r\nit," for "one doer is worth a hundred dreamers."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XLVIII.\r\nWHO MADE THE STARS?\r\n\r\n1. "Mother, who made the stars, which light\r\nThe beautiful blue sky?\r\nWho made the moon, so clear and bright,\r\nThat rises up so high?"\r\n\r\n2. "\'T was God, my child, the Glorious One,\r\nHe formed them by his power;\r\nHe made alike the brilliant sun,\r\nAnd every leaf and flower.\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD  READER. \t127\r\n\r\n3. "He made your little feet to walk;\r\nYour sparkling eyes to see;\r\nYour busy, prattling tongue to talk,\r\nAnd limbs so light and free.\r\n\r\n4. "He paints each fragrant flower that blows,\r\nWith loveliness and bloom;\r\nHe gives the violet and the rose\r\nTheir beauty and perfume.\r\n\r\n5. "Our various wants his hands supply;\r\nHe guides us every hour;\r\nWe\'re kept beneath his watchful eye,\r\nAnd guarded by his power.\r\n\r\n6. "Then let your little heart, my love,\r\nIts grateful homage pay\r\nTo that kind Friend, who, from above,\r\nThus guides you every day.\r\n\r\n7. "In all the changing scenes of time,\r\nOn Him our hopes depend;\r\nIn every age, in every clime,\r\nOur Father and our Friend."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t128 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n\r\nLESSON XLIX.\r\nDEEDS OF KINDNESS.\r\n1. One day, as two little boys were walking along the\r\nroad, they overtook a woman carrying a large basket of\r\napples.\r\n2. The boys thought the woman looked very pale and\r\ntired; so they said, "Are you going to town? If you are, we\r\nwill carry your basket."\r\n3. "Thank you," replied the woman, "you are very kind:\r\nyou see I am weak and ill." Then she told them that she was\r\na widow, and had a lame son to support.\r\n4. She lived in a cottage three miles away, and was now\r\ngoing to market to sell the apples which grew on the only\r\ntree in her little garden. She wanted the money to pay her\r\nrent.\r\n5. "We are going the same way you are," said the boys.\r\n"Let us have the basket;" and they took hold of it, one on\r\neach side, and trudged along with merry hearts.\r\n6. The poor widow looked glad, and said that she hoped\r\ntheir mother would not be angry with them. "Oh, no," they\r\nreplied;\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t129\r\n"our mother has taught us to be kind to everybody, and to be\r\nuseful in any way that we can."\r\n7. She then offered to give them a few of  the ripest apples\r\nfor their trouble. "No,\r\n\r\nthank you," said they; "we do not want any pay for what we\r\nhave done."\r\n8. When the widow got home, she told her lame son what\r\nhad happened on the road,\r\n3. 9.\r\n\r\n\t130 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\nand they were both made happier that day by the kindness of\r\nthe two boys.\r\n9. The other day, I saw a little girl stop and pick up a piece\r\nof orange peel, which she threw into the gutter. "I wish the\r\nboys would not throw orange peel on the sidewalk," said she.\r\n"Some one may tread upon it, and fall."\r\n10. "That is right, my dear," I said. "It is a little thing for\r\nyou to do what you have done, but it shows that you have a\r\nthoughtful mind and a feeling heart."\r\n11. Perhaps some may say that these are little things. So\r\nthey are; but we must not wait for occasions to do great\r\nthings. We must begin with little labors of love.\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON L.\r\nTHE ALARM CLOCK.\r\n1. A lady, who found it not easy to wake in the morning as\r\nearly as she wished,\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t131\r\nbought an alarm clock. These clocks are so made as to strike\r\nwith a loud whirring noise at any hour the owner pleases to\r\nset them.\r\n2. The lady placed her clock at the head of the bed, and at\r\nthe right time she found herself roused by the long, rattling\r\nsound.\r\n3. She arose at once, and felt better all day for her early\r\nrising. This lasted for some weeks. The alarm clock\r\nfaithfully did its duty, and was plainly heard so long as it\r\nwas obeyed.\r\n4. But, after a time, the lady grew tired of early rising.\r\nWhen she was waked by the noise, she merely turned over in\r\nbed, and slept again.\r\n5. In a few days, the clock ceased to rouse her from her\r\nsleep. It spoke just as loudly as ever; but she did not hear it,\r\nbecause she had been in the habit of not obeying it.\r\n6. Finding that she might as well be without it, she\r\nresolved that when she heard the sound she would jump up.\r\n7. Just so it is with conscience. If we will obey its voice,\r\neven in the most trifling things, we can always hear it, clear\r\nand strong.\r\n\r\n\t132 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n8. But if we allow ourselves to do what we have some\r\nfears may not be quite right, we shall grow more and more\r\nsleepy, until the voice of conscience has no longer power to\r\nwake as.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON LI.\r\n\r\nSPRING.\r\n\r\n1. The alder by the river\r\nShakes out her powdery curls;\r\nThe willow buds in silver\r\nFor little boys and girls.\r\n\r\n2.

The oldest was a bad boy. always in trouble\r\nhimself, and trying to get others into trouble. The youngest,\r\nwhose name was George, was a very good boy.\r\nGeorge wished to do right, but was very much wanting in\r\ncourage. The other boys were named Henry and James. As\r\nthey walked along, they talked as follows:\r\nHenry. What fun it would be to throw a snowball against\r\nthe schoolroom door, and make the teacher and scholars all\r\njump!\r\nJames. You would jump, if you should. If the teacher did\r\nnot catch you and whip you, he would tell your father, and\r\nyou would get a whipping then; and that would make you\r\njump higher than the scholars, I think.\r\nHenry. Why, we would get so far off, before the teacher\r\ncould come to the door, that he could not tell who we are.\r\nHere is a snowball just as hard as ice, and George\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t135\r\nwould as soon throw it against the door as not.\r\nJames. Give it to him, and see. He would not dare to\r\nthrow it.\r\nHenry. Do you think George is a coward? You do not\r\nknow him as well as I do.\r\n\r\nHere, George, take this snowball, and show James that you\r\nare not such a coward as he thinks you are.\r\nGeorge. I am not afraid to throw it; but I do not want to. I\r\ndo not see that it\r\n\r\n\t136 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\nwill do any good, or that there will be any fun in it.\r\nJames. There! I told you he would not dare to throw it.\r\nHenry. Why, George, are you turning coward? I thought\r\nyou did not fear anything. Come, save your credit, and throw\r\nit. I know you are not afraid.\r\nGeorge. Well, I am not afraid to throw. Give me the\r\nsnowball. I would as soon throw it as not.\r\nWhack! went the snowball against the door; and the boys\r\ntook to their heels. Henry was laughing as heartily as he\r\ncould, to think what a fool he had made of George.\r\nGeorge had a whipping for his folly, as he ought to have\r\nhad. He was such a coward, that he was afraid of being\r\ncalled a coward. He did not dare refuse to do as Henry told\r\nhim, for fear that he would be laughed at.\r\nIf he had been really a brave boy, he would have said,\r\n"Henry, do you suppose that I am so foolish as to throw that\r\nsnowball, just because you want to have me? You may throw\r\nyour own snowballs, if you please!"\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t137\r\nHenry would, perhaps, have laughed at him, and called\r\nhim a coward.\r\nBut George would have said, "Do you think that 1 care for\r\nyour laughing? I do not think it right to throw the snowball. I\r\nwill not do that which 1 think to be wrong, if the whole town\r\nshould join with you in laughing."\r\nThis would have been real courage. Henry would have\r\nseen, at once, that it would do no good to laugh at a boy who\r\nhad so bold a heart. You must have this fearless spirit, or you\r\nwill get into trouble, and will be, and ought to be, disliked by\r\nall.\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON LIII.\r\n\r\nTHE OLD CLOCK.\r\n\r\n1.  In the old, old hall the old clock stands,\r\nAnd round and round move the steady hands;\r\nWith its tick, tick, tick, both night and day,\r\nWhile seconds and minutes pass away.\r\n\r\n\t138 \tECLECTIC SERIES,\r\n\r\n2.  At the old, old clock oft wonders Nell,\r\nFor she can\'t make out what it has to tell;\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nShe has ne\'er yet read, in prose or rhyme,\r\nThat it marks the silent course of time.\r\n\r\n3.  When I was a child, as Nell is now,\r\nAnd long ere Time had wrinkled my brow,\r\nThe old, old clock both by night and day\r\nSaid,--"Tick, tick, tick!" Time passes away.\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t139\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON LIV.\r\nTHE WAVES.\r\n1. "Where are we to go?" said the little waves to the great,\r\ndeep sea.\r\n"Go, my darlings, to the yellow sands: you will find work\r\nto do there."\r\n2. "I want to play," said one little wave; "I want to see\r\nwho can jump the highest."\r\n"No; come on, come on," said an earnest wave; "mother\r\nmust be right. I want to work."\r\n3. "Oh, I dare not go," said another; "look at those great,\r\nblack rocks close to the sands; I dare not go there, for they\r\nwill tear me to pieces."\r\n4. "Take my hand, sister," said the earnest wave; "let us go\r\non together. How glorious it is to do some work."\r\n5. "Shall we ever go back to mother?" "Yes, when our\r\nwork is done."\r\n\r\n\t140 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n6. So one and all hurried on. Even the little wave that\r\nwanted to play, pressed on, and thought that work might be\r\nfun after all. The timid ones did not like to be left behind,\r\nand they became earnest as they got nearer the sands.\r\n7. After all, it was fun, pressing on one after another--\r\njumping, laughing, running on to the broad, shining sands.\r\n8. First, they came in their course to a great sand castle.\r\nSplash, splash! they all\r\n\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t141\r\nwent over it, and down it came. "Oh, what fun!" they cried.\r\n9. "Mother told me to bring these seaweeds; I will find a\r\npretty place for them," said one--and she ran a long way over\r\nthe sands, and left them among the pebbles. The pebbles\r\ncried, "We are glad you are come. We wanted washing."\r\n10. "Mother sent these shells; I do n\'t know where to put\r\nthem," said a little fretful wave. "Lay them one by one on the\r\nsand, and do not break them," said the eldest wave.\r\n11. And the little one went about its work, and learned to\r\nbe quiet and gentle, for fear of breaking the shells.\r\n12. "Where is my work?" said a great, full-grown wave.\r\n"this is mere play. The little ones can do this and laugh over\r\nit. Mother said there was work for me." And he came down\r\nupon some large rocks.\r\n13. Over the rocks and into a pool he went, and he heard\r\nthe fishes say, "The sea is coming. Thank you, great sea; you\r\nalways send a big wave when a storm is nigh. Thank you,\r\nkind wave; we are all ready for you now."\r\n\r\n\t142 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n14. Then the waves all went back over the wet sands,\r\nslowly and carelessly, for they were tired.\r\n15. "All my shells are safe," said one.\r\n16. And, "My seaweeds are left behind," said another.\r\n17. "I washed all of the pebbles," said a third.\r\n18. "And I--I only broke on a rock, and splashed into a\r\npool," said the one that was so eager to work. "I have done\r\nno good, mother--no work at all"\r\n19. "Hush!" said the sea. And they heard a child that was\r\nwalking on the shore, say, "O mother, the sea has been here!\r\nLook, how nice and clean the sand is, and how clear the\r\nwater is in that pool."\r\n20. Then the sea, said, "Hark!" and far away they heard\r\nthe deep moaning of the coming storm.\r\n21. "Come, my darlings," said she; "you have done your\r\nwork, now let the storm do its work."\r\n\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t143\r\n\r\nLESSON LV.\r\n\r\nDO N\'T KILL THE BIRDS.\r\n\r\n1. Do n\'t kill the birds! the little birds,\r\nThat sing about your door\r\nSoon as the joyous Spring has come,\r\nAnd chilling storms are o\'er.\r\n\r\n2. The little birds! how sweet they sing!\r\nOh, let them joyous live;\r\nAnd do not seek to take the life\r\nWhich you can never give.\r\n\r\n3. Do n\'t kill the birds! the pretty birds,\r\nThat play among the trees;\r\n\r\n\t144 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n\r\nFor earth would be a cheerless place,\r\nIf it were not for these.\r\n\r\n4. The little birds! how fond they play!\r\nDo not disturb their sport;\r\nBut let them warble forth their songs,\r\nTill winter cuts them short.\r\n\r\n5. Do n\'t kill the birds! the happy birds,\r\nThat bless the field and grove;\r\nSo innocent to look upon,\r\nThey claim our warmest love.\r\n\r\n6. The happy birds, the tuneful birds,\r\nHow pleasant  \'t is to see!\r\nNo spot can be a cheerless place\r\nWhere\'er their presence be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON LVI.\r\n\r\nWHEN TO SAY NO.\r\n\r\n1. Though "No" is a very little word, it is not always easy\r\nto say it; and the not doing so, often causes trouble.\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t145\r\n2. When we are asked to stay away from school, and\r\nspend in idleness or mischief the time which ought to be\r\nspent in study, we should at once say "No."\r\n3. When we are urged to loiter on our way to school, and\r\nthus be late, and interrupt our teacher and the school, we\r\nshould say "No." When some schoolmate wishes us to\r\nwhisper or play in the schoolroom, we should say "No."\r\n4. When we are tempted to use angry or wicked words, we\r\nshould remember that the eye of God is always upon us, and\r\nshould say "No."\r\n5. When we have done anything wrong, and are tempted\r\nto conceal it by falsehood, we should say "No, we can not\r\ntell a lie; it is wicked and cowardly."\r\n6. If we are asked to do anything which we know to be\r\nwrong, we should not fear to say "No."\r\n7. If we thus learn to say "No," we shall avoid much\r\ntrouble, and be always safe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.10.\r\n\r\n146 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\nLESSON LVII.\r\nWHICH LOVED BEST?\r\n\r\n"I love you, mother," said little John;\r\nThen, forgetting work, his cap went on,\r\nAnd he was off to the garden swing,\r\nLeaving his mother the wood to bring.\r\n\r\n\r\n2.  "I love you, mother," said rosy Nell;\r\n"I love you better than tongue can tell;"\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t147\r\n\r\nThen she teased and pouted full half the day,\r\nTill her mother rejoiced when she went to play.\r\n\r\n3.  "I love you, mother," said little Fan;\r\n "To-day I\'ll help you all I can;\r\nHow glad I am that school does n\'t keep!"\r\nSo she rocked the baby till it fell asleep.\r\n\r\n4.  Then, stepping softly, she took the broom,\r\nAnd swept the floor, and dusted the room;\r\nBusy and happy all day was she,\r\nHelpful and cheerful as child could be.\r\n\r\n5.  "I love you, mother," again they said--\r\nThree little children going to bed;\r\nHow do you think that mother guessed\r\nWhich of them really loved her best?\r\nJoy Allison.\r\n\r\nLESSON LVIII.\r\n\r\nJOHN CARPENTER.\r\n1. John Carpenter did not like to buy toys that somebody\r\nelse had made. He liked the fun of making them himself. The\r\nthought that they were his own work delighted him.\r\n2. Tom Austin, one of his playmates, thought a toy was\r\nworth nothing unless it cost a great deal of money. He never\r\ntried to make anything, but bought all his toys.\r\n\r\n\t148 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n3. "Come and look at my horse," said he, one day. "It cost\r\na dollar, and it is such a beauty! Come and see it."\r\n4. John was soon admiring his friend\'s\r\n\r\nhorse; and he was examining it carefully, to see how it was\r\nmade. The same evening he began to make one for himself.\r\n5. He went into the wood shed, and picked\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t149\r\nout two pieces of wood--one for the head of his horse, the\r\nother for the body. It took him two or three days to shape\r\nthem to his satisfaction.\r\n6. His father gave him a bit of red leather for a bridle, and\r\na few brass nails, and his mother found a bit of old fur with\r\nwhich he made a mane and tail for his horse.\r\n7. But what about the wheels? This puzzled him. At last\r\nhe thought he would go to a turner\'s shop, and see if he could\r\nnot get some round pieces of wood which might suit his\r\npurpose.\r\n8. He found a large number of such pieces among the\r\nshavings on the floor, and asked permission to take a few of\r\nthem. The turner asked him what he wanted them for, and he\r\ntold him about his horse.\r\n9. "Oh," said the man, laughing, "if you wish it, I will\r\nmake some wheels for your horse. But mind, when it is\r\nfinished, you must let me see it."\r\n10. John promised to do so, and he soon ran home with\r\nthe wheels in his pocket. The next evening, he went to the\r\nturner\'s shop with his horse all complete, and was told that\r\nhe was an ingenious little fellow\r\n\r\n150 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n11. Proud of this compliment, he ran to his friend Tom,\r\ncrying, "Now then, Tom, here is my horse,--look!"\r\n12. "Well, that is a funny horse," said Tom; "where did\r\nyou buy it?" "I did n\'t buy it," replied John; I made it."\r\n13. "You made it yourself! Oh, well, it\'s a good horse for\r\nyou to make. But it is not so good as mine. Mine cost a\r\ndollar, and yours did n\'t cost anything."\r\n14. "It was real fun to make it, though," said John, and\r\naway he ran with his horse rolling after him.\r\n15. Do you want to know what became of John? Well, I\r\nwill tell you. He studied hard in school, and was called the\r\nbest scholar in his class. When he left school, he went to\r\nwork in a machine shop. He is now a master workman, and\r\nwill soon have a shop of his own.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t151\r\n\r\nLESSON LIX.\r\n\r\nPERSEVERE.\r\n\r\n1.

He got off\r\nfrom his horse to look at something on the roadside. The\r\nhorse broke away from him, and ran off. Mr. Lenox ran after\r\nhim, but soon found that he could not catch him.\r\nA little boy at work in a field near the road, heard the\r\nhorse. As soon as he saw him running from his master, the\r\nboy ran\r\n\r\n\t152 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n\r\nvery quickly to the middle of the road, and, catching the\r\nhorse by thc bridle, stopped him till Mr. Lenox came up.\r\nMr. Lenox. Thank you, my good boy, you have caught my\r\nhorse very nicely. What shall I give you for your trouble?\r\nBoy. I want nothing, sir.\r\nMr. L. You want nothing? So much the better for you.\r\nFew men can say as much. But what were you doing in the\r\nfield?\r\nB. I was rooting up weeds, and tending the sheep that\r\nwere feeding on turnips.\r\nMr. L. Do you like to work?\r\nB. Yes, sir, very well, this fine weather.\r\nMr. L. But would you not rather play?\r\nB. This is not hard work. It is almost as good as play.\r\nMr. L. Who set you to work?\r\nB. My father, sir.\r\nMr. L. What is your name?\r\nB. Peter Hurdle, sir.\r\nMr. L. How old are you?\r\nB. Eight years old, next June.\r\nMr. L.

What are they?\r\nMr. L. Such things as ninepins, marbles, tops, and wooden\r\nhorses.\r\nB. No, sir. Tom and I play at football in winter, and I have\r\na jumping rope. I had a hoop, but it is broken.\r\nMr. L. Do you want nothing else?\r\nB. I have hardly time to play with what I have.

Little Gustava sits in the sun,\r\nSafe in the porch, and the little drops run\r\nFrom the icicles under the eaves so fast,\r\nFor the bright spring sun shines warm at last,\r\nAnd glad is little Gustava.\r\n\r\n2.  She wears a quaint little scarlet cap,\r\nAnd a little green bowl she holds in her lap,\r\nFilled with bread and milk to the brim,\r\nAnd a wreath of marigolds round the rim:\r\n"Ha! ha!" laughs little Gustava.\r\n\r\n3.  Up comes her little gray, coaxing cat,\r\nWith her little pink nose, and she mews, "What\'s that ?"\r\nGustava feeds her,--she begs for more,\r\nAnd a little brown hen walks in at the door:\r\n"Good day!" cries little Gustava.\r\n\r\n4.  She scatters crumbs for the little brown hen,\r\nThere comes a rush and a flutter, and then\r\nDown fly her little white doves so sweet,\r\nWith their snowy wings and their crimson feet:\r\n"Welcome!" cries little Gustava.\r\n\r\n5.  So dainty and eager they pick up the crumbs.\r\nBut who is this through the doorway comes?\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t157\r\n\r\nLittle Scotch terrier, little dog Rags,\r\nLooks in her face, and his funny tail wags:\r\n"Ha! ha!" laughs little Gustava.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6.  "You want some breakfast, too?" and down\r\nShe sets her bowl on the brick floor brown,\r\nAnd little dog Rags drinks up her milk,\r\nWhile she strokes his shaggy locks, like silk:\r\n"Dear Rags!" says little Gustava.\r\n\r\n7.  Waiting without stood sparrow and crow,\r\nCooling their feet in the melting snow.\r\n\r\n\t158\tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n\r\n"Won\'t you come in, good folk?" she cried,\r\nBut they were too bashful, and staid outside,\r\nThough "Pray come in!" cried Gustava.\r\n\r\n8.  So the last she threw them, and knelt on the mat,\r\nWith doves, and biddy, and dog, and cat.\r\nAnd her mother came to the open house door:\r\n"Dear little daughter, I bring you some more,\r\nMy merry little Gustava."\r\n\r\n9.

James Selton was one of the most insolent boys in the\r\nvillage where he lived. He would rarely pass people in the\r\nstreet without being guilty of some sort of abuse.\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t159\r\n2. If a person were well dressed he would cry out,\r\n"Dandy!" If a person\'s clothes were dirty or torn, he would\r\nthrow stones at him, and annoy him in every way.\r\n3. One afternoon, just as the school was dismissed, a\r\nstranger passed through the village. His dress was plain and\r\nsomewhat old, but neat and clean. He carried a cane in his\r\nhand, on the end of which was a bundle, and he wore a\r\nbroad-brimmed hat.\r\n4. No sooner did James see the stranger, than he winked to\r\nhis playmates, and said, "Now for some fun!" He then\r\nsilently went toward the stranger from behind, and, knocking\r\noff his hat, ran away.\r\n5. The man turned and saw him, but James was out of\r\nhearing before he could speak. The stranger put on his hat,\r\nand went on his way. Again did James approach; but this\r\ntime, the man caught him by the arm, and held him fast.\r\n6. However, he contented himself with looking James a\r\nmoment in the face, and then pushed him from him. No\r\nsooner did the naughty boy find himself free again, than he\r\nbegan to pelt the stranger with dirt and stones.\r\n\r\n\t160 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n7. But he was much frightened when the "rowdy," as he\r\nfoolishly called the man, was struck on the head by a brick,\r\nand badly hurt. All the boys now ran away, and James\r\nskulked across the fields to his home.\r\n8. As he drew near the house, his sister Caroline came out\r\nto meet him, holding up\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t161\r\na beautiful gold chain and some new books for him to see.\r\n9. She told James, as fast as she could talk, that their\r\nuncle, who had been away several years, had come home,\r\nand was now in the house; that he had brought beautiful\r\npresents for the whole family; that he had left his carriage at\r\nthe tavern, a mile or two off, and walked on foot, so as to\r\nsurprise his brother, their father.\r\n10. She said, that while he was coming through the\r\nvillage, some wicked boys threw stones at him, and hit him\r\njust over the eye, and that mother had bound up the wound.\r\n"But what makes you look so pale?" asked Caroline,\r\nchanging her tone.\r\n11. The guilty boy told her that nothing was the matter\r\nwith him; and running into the house, he went upstairs into\r\nhis chamber. Soon after, he heard his father calling him to\r\ncome down. Trembling from head to foot, he obeyed. When\r\nhe reached the parlor door, he stood, fearing to enter.\r\n12. His mother said, "James, why do you not come in?\r\nYou are not usually so bashful. See this beautiful watch,\r\nwhich your uncle has brought for you."\r\n3, 11.\r\n\r\n\t162 \tECLECTIC SERIES,\r\n13. What a sense of shame did James now feel! Little\r\nCaroline seized his arm, and pulled him into the room. But\r\nhe hung down his head, and covered his face with his hands.\r\n14. His uncle went up to him, and kindly taking away his\r\nhands, said, "James, will you not bid me welcome?" But\r\nquickly starting back, he cried, "Brother, this is not your son.\r\nIt is the boy who so shamefully insulted me in the street!"\r\n15. With surprise and grief did the good father and mother\r\nlearn this. His uncle was ready to forgive him, and forget the\r\ninjury. But his father would never permit James to have the\r\ngold watch, nor the beautiful books, which his uncle had\r\nbrought for him.\r\n16. The rest of the children were loaded with presents.\r\nJames was obliged to content himself with seeing them\r\nhappy. He never forgot this lesson so long as he lived. It\r\ncured him entirely of his low and insolent manners.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t163\r\n\r\nLESSON LXIII.\r\n\r\nWE ARE SEVEN.\r\n\r\n1. I met a little cottage girl:\r\nShe was eight years old, she said;\r\nHer hair was thick with many a curl,\r\nThat clustered round her head.\r\n\r\n2. She had a rustic, woodland air,\r\nAnd she was wildly clad:\r\nHer eyes were fair, and very fair;--\r\nHer beauty made me glad.\r\n\r\n3. "Sisters and brothers, little maid,\r\nHow many may you be?"\r\n"How many? Seven in all," she said,\r\nAnd, wondering, looked at me.\r\n\r\n4. "And where are they? I pray you tell."\r\nShe answered, "Seven are we;\r\nAnd two of us at Conway dwell,\r\nAnd two are gone to sea.\r\n\r\n\tl64\tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n\r\n5. "Two of us in the churchyard lie,\r\nMy sister and my brother;\r\nAnd, in the churchyard cottage, I\r\nDwell near them with my mother,"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n6. "You say that two at Conway dwell,\r\nAnd two are gone to sea,\r\nYet ye are seven! I pray you tell,\r\nSweet maid, how this may be."\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t165\r\n\r\n7. Then did the little maid reply,\r\n"Seven boys and girls are we;\r\nTwo of us in the churchyard lie,\r\nBeneath the churchyard tree."\r\n\r\n8. "You run about, my little maid,\r\nYour limbs, they are alive;\r\nIf two are in the churchyard laid,\r\nThen ye are only five."\r\n\r\n9. "Their graves are green, they may be seen,"\r\nThe little maid replied,\r\n"Twelve steps or more from mother\'s door,\r\nAnd they are side by side.\r\n\r\n10. "My stockings there I often knit,\r\nMy kerchief there I hem;\r\nAnd there upon the ground I sit,\r\nAnd sing a song to them.\r\n\r\n11. "And often after sunset, sir,\r\nWhen it is light and fair,\r\nI take my little porringer,\r\nAnd eat my supper there.\r\n\r\n12. "The first that died was sister Jane;\r\nIn bed she moaning lay,\r\n\r\n166 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n\r\nTill God released her from her pain;\r\nAnd then she went away.\r\n\r\n13. "So in the churchyard she was laid;\r\nAnd, when the grass was dry,\r\nTogether round her grave we played,\r\nMy brother John and I.\r\n\r\n14. "And when the ground was white with snow,\r\nAnd I could run and slide,\r\nMy brother John was forced to go,\r\nAnd he lies by her side."\r\n\r\n15. "How many are you, then?" said I,\r\n"If they two are in heaven?"\r\nQuick was the little maid\'s reply,\r\n"O master! we are seven."\r\n\r\n16. "But they are dead; those two are dead!\r\nTheir spirits are in heaven!"\r\n\'T was throwing words away: for still\r\nThe little maid would have her will,\r\nAnd said, "Nay, we are seven."\r\nWilliam Wordsworth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t167\r\n\r\nLESSON LXIV.\r\n\r\nMARY\'S DIME.\r\n1. There! I have drawn the chairs into the right corners,\r\nand dusted the room nicely. How cold papa and mamma will\r\nbe when they return from their long ride! It is not time to\r\ntoast the bread yet, and I am tired of reading.\r\n2. What shall I do? Somehow, I can\'t help thinking about\r\nthe pale face of that little beggar girl all the time. I can see\r\nthe glad light filling her eyes, just as plain as I did when I\r\nlaid the dime in her little dirty hand.\r\n3. How much I had thought of that dime, too! Grandpa\r\ngave it to me a whole month ago, and I had kept it ever since\r\nin my red box upstairs; but those sugar apples looked so\r\nbeautiful, and were so cheap--only a dime apiece--that I\r\nmade up my mind to have one.\r\n4. I can see her--the beggar girl, I mean--as she stood\r\nthere in front of the store, in her old hood and faded dress,\r\nlooking at the candies laid all in a row. I wonder\r\n\r\n168 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\nwhat made me say, "Little girl, what do you want?"\r\n5. How she stared at me, just as if nobody had spoken\r\nkindly to her before. I guess\r\n\r\nshe thought I was sorry for her, for she said, so earnestly and\r\nsorrowfully, "I was thinking how good one of those\r\ngingerbread rolls would taste. I have n\'t had anything to eat\r\nto-day."\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t169\r\n6. Now, I thought to myself, "Mary Williams, you have\r\nhad a good breakfast and a good dinner this day, and this\r\npoor girl has not had a mouthful. You can give her your\r\ndime; she needs it a great deal more than you do."\r\n7. I could not resist that little girl\'s sorrowful, hungry\r\nlook--so I dropped the dime right into her hand, and, without\r\nwaiting for her to speak, walked straight away. I\'m so glad I\r\ngave her the dime, if I did have to go without the apple lying\r\nthere in the window, and looking just like a real one.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON LXV.\r\nMARY DOW.\r\n\r\n1. "Come in, little stranger," I said,\r\nAs she tapped at my half open door;\r\nWhile the blanket, pinned over her head,\r\nJust reached to the basket she bore.\r\n\r\n170\tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n\r\n2. A look full of innocence fell\r\nFrom her modest and pretty blue eye,\r\nAs she said, "I have matches to sell,\r\nAnd hope you are willing to buy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. "A penny a bunch is the price,\r\nI think you\'ll not find it too much;\r\nThey are tied up so even and nice,\r\nAnd ready to light with a touch."\r\n\r\n4. I asked, "\'What\'s your name, little girl?"\r\n"\'Tis Mary," said she, "Mary Dow;"\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t171\r\n\r\nAnd carelessly tossed off a curl,\r\nThat played on her delicate brow.\r\n\r\n5.

"She sits there at home, without food,\r\nBeside our poor, sick Willy\'s bed;\r\nShe paid all her money for wood,\r\nAnd so I sell matches for bread.\r\n\r\n7. "I\'d go to the yard and get chips,\r\nBut then it would make me too sad\r\nTo see the men building the ships,\r\nAnd think they had made one so bad.\r\n\r\n8. "But God, I am sure, who can take\r\nSuch fatherly care of a bird,\r\nWill never forget nor forsake\r\nThe children who trust in his word.\r\n\r\n9.

"Fly home, little bird," then I thought,\r\n"Fly home, full of joy, to your nest;"\r\nFor I took all the matches she brought,\r\nAnd Mary may tell you the rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON LXVI.\r\nTHE LITTLE LOAF.\r\n1. Once when there was a famine, a rich baker sent for\r\ntwenty of the poorest children in the town, and said to them,\r\n"In this basket there is a loaf for each of you. Take it, and\r\ncome back to me every day at this hour till God sends us\r\nbetter times."\r\n2. The hungry children gathered eagerly about the basket,\r\nand quarreled for the bread, because each wished to have the\r\nlargest loaf. At last they went away without even thanking\r\nthe good gentleman.\r\n3. But Gretchen, a poorly-dressed little girl, did not\r\nquarrel or struggle with the rest,\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t173\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nbut remained standing modestly in the distance. When the\r\nill-behaved girls had left, she took the smallest loaf, which\r\nalone was left in the basket, kissed the gentleman\'s hand, and\r\nwent home.\r\n4. The next day the children were as ill behaved as before,\r\nand poor, timid Gretchen received a loaf scarcely half the\r\nsize of the one she got the first day. When she came home,\r\nand her mother cut the loaf open, many new, shining pieces\r\nof silver fell out of it.\r\n\r\n\t174 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n5. Her mother was very much alarmed, and said, "Take\r\nthe money back to the good gentleman at once, for it must\r\nhave got into the dough by accident. Be quick, Gretchen! be\r\nquick!"\r\n6. But when the little girl gave the rich man her mother\'s\r\nmessage, he said, "No, no, my child, it was no mistake. I had\r\nthe silver pieces put into the smallest loaf to reward you.\r\nAlways be as contented, peaceable, and grateful as you now\r\nare. Go home now, and tell your mother that the money is\r\nyour own."\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON LXVII.\r\n\r\nSUSIE AND ROVER.\r\n1. "Mamma," said Susie Dean, one summer\'s morning,\r\n"may I go to the woods, and pick berries?"\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t175\r\n2. "Yes," replied Mrs. Dean, "but you must take Rover\r\nwith you."\r\n3. Susie brought her little basket, and her mother put up a\r\nnice lunch for her. She tied down the cover, and fastened a\r\ntin cup to it.\r\n4. The little girl called Rover--a great Newfoundland\r\ndog--and gave him a tin pail to carry. "If I bring it home\r\nfull, mamma," she said, "won\'t you make some berry\r\ncakes for tea?"\r\n5. Away she tripped, singing as she went down the lane\r\nand across the pasture. When she got to the woods, she put\r\nher dinner basket down beside a tree, and began to pick\r\nberries.\r\n6. Rover ran about, chasing a squirrel or a rabbit now and\r\nthen, but never straying far from Susie.\r\n7. The tin pail was not a very small one. By the time it\r\nwas two thirds full, Susie began to feel hungry, and thought\r\nshe would eat her lunch.\r\n8. Rover came and took his place at her side as soon as\r\nshe began to eat. Did she not give him some of the lunch?\r\nNo, she was in a selfish mood, and did no such thing.\r\n\r\n\t176 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n9. "There, Rover, run away! there\'s a good dog," she said;\r\nbut Rover staid near her, watching her steadily with his clear\r\nbrown eves.\r\n\r\n10. The meat he wanted so much, was soon eaten up; and\r\nall he got of the nice dinner, was a small crust of gingerbread\r\nthat Susie threw away.\r\n11. After dinner, Susie played a while by\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t177\r\nthe brook. She threw sticks into the water, and Rover swam\r\nin and brought them back. Then she began to pick berries\r\nagain.\r\n12. She did not enjoy the afternoon as she did the\r\nmorning. The sunshine was as bright, the berries were as\r\nsweet and plentiful, and she was neither tired nor hungry.\r\n13. But good, faithful Rover was hungry, and she had not\r\ngiven him even one piece of meat. She tried to forget how\r\nselfish she had been; but she could not do so, and quite early\r\nshe started for home.\r\n14. When she was nearly out of the woods, a rustling in\r\nthe underbrush attracted her attention. "I wonder if that is a\r\nbird or a squirrel," said she to herself. "If I can catch it, how\r\nglad I shall be!"\r\n15. She tried to make her way quietly through the\r\nunderbrush; but what was her terror when she saw it large\r\nsnake coiled up before her, prepared for a spring!\r\n16. She was so much frightened that she could not move;\r\nbut brave Rover saw the snake, and, springing forward,\r\nseized it by the neck and killed it.\r\n17. When the faithful dog came and rubbed his head\r\nagainst her hand, Susie put her\r\n3, 12.\r\n\r\n178 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\narms \'round his neck, and burst into tears. "O Rover," she\r\ncried, "you dear, good dog! How sorry I am that I was so\r\nselfish!"\r\n18. Rover understood the tone of her voice, if he did not\r\nunderstand her words, and capered about in great glee,\r\nbarking all the time. You may be sure that he had a plentiful\r\nsupper that evening.\r\n19. Susie never forgot the lesson of that day. She soon\r\nlearned to be on her guard against a selfish spirit, and\r\nbecame a happier and more lovable little girl.\r\nMrs. M. O.

"Will you come with us, Susan?" cried several little\r\ngirls to a schoolmate. "We are going to the woods; do come,\r\ntoo."\r\n2. "I should like to go with you very much," replied\r\nSusan, with a sigh; "but I can not finish the task grandmother\r\nset me to do."\r\n3. "How tiresome it must be to stay at home to work on a\r\nholiday!" said one of the girls, with a toss of her head.\r\n"Susan\'s grandmother is too strict."\r\n4. Susan heard this remark, and, as she bent her head over\r\nher task, she wiped away a tear, and thought of the pleasant\r\nafternoon the girls would spend gathering wild flowers in the\r\nwoods.\r\n5. Soon she said to herself, "What harm can there be in\r\nmoving the mark grandmother put in the stocking? The\r\nwoods must be very beautiful to-day, and how I should like\r\nto be in them!"\r\n6. "Grandmother," said she, a few minutes afterwards, "I\r\nam ready, now." "What, so\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t181\r\nsoon, Susan?" Her grandmother took the work, and looked at\r\nit very closely.\r\n7. "True, Susan," said she, laying great stress on each\r\nword; "true, I count twenty turns from the mark; and, as you\r\nhave never deceived me, you may go and amuse yourself as\r\nyou like the rest of the day."\r\n8. Susan\'s cheeks were scarlet, and she did not say,\r\n"Thank you." As she left the cottage, she walked slowly\r\naway, not singing as usual.\r\n9. "Why, here is Susan!" the girls cried, when she joined\r\ntheir company; "but what is the matter? Why have you left\r\nyour dear, old grandmother?" they tauntingly added.\r\n10. "There is nothing the matter." As Susan repeated these\r\nwords, she felt that she was trying to deceive herself. She\r\nhad acted a lie. At the same time she remembered her\r\ngrandmother\'s words, "You have never deceived me."\r\n11. "Yes, I have deceived her," said she to herself. "If she\r\nknew all, she would never trust me again."\r\n12. When the little party had reached an open space in the\r\nwoods, her companions ran about enjoying themselves; but\r\nSusan sat on\r\n\r\n\t182 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nthe grass, wishing she were at home confessing her fault.\r\n13. After a while Rose cried out, "Let us make a crown of\r\nviolets, and put it on the head of the best girl here."\r\n14. "It will be easy enough to make the crown, but not so\r\neasy to decide who is to wear it," said Julia.\r\n15. "Why, Susan is to wear it, of course," said Rose: "is\r\nshe not said to be the best girl in school and the most\r\nobedient at home?"\r\n16. "Yes, yes; the crown shall be for Susan,"\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t183\r\ncried the other girls, and they began to make the crown. It\r\nwas soon finished.\r\n17. "Now, Susan," said Rose, "put it on in a very dignified\r\nway, for you are to be our queen."\r\n18. As these words were spoken, the crown was placed on\r\nher head. In a moment she snatched it off, and threw it on the\r\nground, saying, "No crown for me; I do not deserve it."\r\n19. The girls looked at her with surprise. "I have deceived\r\nmy grandmother," said she, while tears flowed down her\r\ncheeks. "I altered the mark she put in the stocking, that I\r\nmight join you in the woods."\r\n20. "Do you call that wicked?" asked one of the girls.\r\n"I am quite sure it is; and I have been miserable all the\r\ntime I have been here."\r\n21. Susan now ran home, and as soon as she got there she\r\nsaid, with a beating heart, "O grandmother! I deserve to be\r\npunished, for I altered the mark you put in the stocking. Do\r\nforgive me; I am very sorry and unhappy."\r\n22. "Susan," said her grandmother, "I knew it all the time;\r\nbut I let you go out, hoping\r\n\r\n\t184 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\nthat your own conscience would tell you of your sin.

Oh, were you ne\'er a schoolboy,\r\nAnd did you never train,\r\nAnd feel that swelling of the heart\r\nYou ne\'er can feel again?\r\n\r\n2. Did you never meet, far down the street,\r\nWith plumes and banners gay,\r\nWhile the kettle, for the kettledrum,\r\nPlayed your march, march away?\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t185\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. It seems to me but yesterday,\r\nNor scarce so long ago,\r\nSince all our school their muskets took,\r\nTo charge the fearful foe.\r\n\r\n4. Our muskets were of cedar wood,\r\nWith ramrods bright and new;\r\nWith bayonets forever set,\r\nAnd painted barrels, too.\r\n\r\n5. We charged upon a flock of geese,\r\nAnd put them all to flight--\r\nExcept one sturdy gander\r\nThat thought to show us fight.\r\n\r\n\t186 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n\r\n6. But, ah! we knew a thing or two;\r\nOur captain wheeled the van;\r\nWe routed him, we scouted him,\r\nNor lost a single man!\r\n\r\n7. Our captain was as brave a lad\r\nAs e\'er commission bore;\r\nAnd brightly shone his new tin sword;\r\nA paper cap he wore.\r\n\r\n8. He led us up the steep hillside,\r\nAgainst the western wind,\r\nWhile the cockerel plume that decked his head\r\nStreamed bravely out behind.\r\n\r\n9. We shouldered arms, we carried arms,\r\nWe charged the bayonet;\r\nAnd woe unto the mullein stalk\r\nThat in our course we met!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t187\r\n\r\n10. At two o\'clock the roll we called,\r\nAnd till the close of day,\r\nWith fearless hearts, though tired limbs,\r\nWe fought the mimic fray,--\r\nTill the supper bell, from out the dell,\r\nBade us march, march away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON LXXI.\r\n\r\nHOW WILLIE GOT OUT OF THE SHAFT.\r\n1. Willie\'s aunt sent him for a birthday present a little\r\nwriting book. There was a place in the book for a pencil.\r\nWillie thought a great deal of this little book, and always\r\nkept it in his pocket.\r\n2. One day, his mother was very busy, and he called his\r\ndog, and said, "Come, Caper, let us have a play."\r\n\r\n\t188 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n3. When Willie\'s mother missed him, she went to the door\r\nand looked out, and could not see him anywhere; but she\r\nknew that Caper was with him, and thought they would\r\ncome back before long.\r\n4. She waited an, hour, and still they did not come. When\r\nshe came to the gate by the road, she met Mr. Lee, and told\r\nhim how long Willie had been gone. Mr. Lee thought he\r\nmust have gone to sleep under the trees. So they went to all\r\nthe trees under which Willie was in the habit of playing, but\r\nhe was nowhere to be found.\r\n5. By this time the sun had gone down. The news that\r\nWillie was lost soon spread over the neighborhood, and all\r\nthe men and women turned out to hunt. They hunted all\r\nnight.\r\n6. The next morning the neighbors were gathered round,\r\nand all were trying to think what to do next, when Caper\r\ncame bounding into the room. There was a string tied round\r\nhis neck, and a bit of paper tied to it.\r\n7. Willie\'s father, Mr. Lee, took the paper, and saw that it\r\nwas a letter from Willie. He read it aloud. It said, "O father!\r\ncome to me. I am in the big hole in the pasture."\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t189\r\n8. Everybody ran at once to the far corner of the pasture;\r\nand there was Willie, alive and well, in the shaft. Oh, how\r\nglad he was when his father caught him in his arms, and\r\nlifted him out!\r\n\r\n9. Now I will tell you how Willie came to be in the shaft.\r\nHe and Caper went to the pasture field, and came to the edge\r\nof the shaft and sat down. In bending over\r\n\r\n\t190 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\nto see how deep it was, he lost his balance, and fell in. He\r\ntried very hard to get out, but could not.\r\n10. When the good little dog saw that his master was in\r\nthe shaft, he would not leave him, but ran round and round,\r\nreaching down and trying to pull him out. But while Caper\r\nwas pulling Willie by the coat sleeves, a piece of sod gave\r\nway under his feet, and he fell in too.\r\n11. Willie called for his father and mother as loud as he\r\ncould call; but he was so far away from the house that no one\r\ncould hear him.\r\n12. He cried and called till it was dark, and then he lay\r\ndown on the ground, and Caper lay down close beside him.\r\nIt was not long before Willie cried himself to sleep.\r\n13. When he awoke it was morning, and he began to think\r\nof a way to get out. The little writing book that his aunt had\r\ngiven him, was in his pocket. He took it out, and, after a\r\ngood deal of trouble, wrote the letter to his father.\r\n14. Then he tore the leaf out, and took a string out of his\r\npocket, and tied it round Caper\'s neck, and tied the letter to\r\nthe\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t191\r\nstring. Then he lifted the dog up, and helped him out, and\r\nsaid to him, "Go home, Caper, go home!" The little dog\r\nscampered away, and was soon at home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON LXXII.\r\nTHE PERT CHICKEN.\r\n\r\n1. There was once a pretty chicken;\r\nBut his friends were very few,\r\nFor he thought that there was nothing\r\nIn the world but what he knew:\r\nSo he always, in the farmyard,\r\nHad a very forward way,\r\nTelling all the hens and turkeys\r\nWhat they ought to do and say.\r\n"Mrs. Goose," he said, "I wonder\r\nThat your goslings you should let\r\nGo out paddling in the water;\r\nIt will kill them to get wet."\r\n\r\n\t192 \tECLECTIC SERIES,\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n2. "I wish, my old Aunt Dorking,"\r\nHe began to her, one day,\r\n"That you would n\'t sit all summer\r\nIn your nest upon the hay.\r\nWon\'t you come out to the meadow,\r\nWhere the grass with seeds is filled?"\r\n"If I should," said Mrs. Dorking,\r\n"Then my eggs would all get chilled."\r\n"No, they wo n\'t," replied the chicken,\r\n"And no matter if they do;\r\nEggs are really good for nothing;\r\nWhat\'s an egg to me or you?"\r\n\r\n3. "What\'s an egg!" said Mrs. Dorking,\r\n"Can it be you do not know\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t193\r\n\r\nYou yourself were in an eggshell\r\nJust one little month ago?\r\nAnd, if kind wings had not warmed you,\r\nYou would not be out to-day,\r\nTelling hens, and geese, and turkeys,\r\nWhat they ought to do and say!\r\n\r\n4. "To be very wise, and show it,\r\nIs a pleasant thing, no doubt;\r\nBut, when young folks talk to old folks,\r\nThey should know what they\'re about."\r\nMarian Douglas.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON LXXIII.\r\n\r\nINDIAN CORN.\r\n\r\n1. Few plants are more useful to man than Indian corn, or\r\nmaize. No grain, except rice, is used to so great an extent as\r\nan article of food. In some countries corn is almost the only\r\nfood eaten by the people.\r\n\r\n3, 13\r\n\r\n\t194 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n2. Do you know why it is called Indian corn? It is because\r\nthe American Indians were the first corn growers. Columbus\r\nfound this grain widely cultivated by them when he\r\ndiscovered the New World. They pounded it in rude, stone\r\nbowls, and thus made a coarse flour, which they mixed with\r\nwater and baked.\r\n3. Indian corn is now the leading crop in the United\r\nStates. In whatever part of this land we live, we see corn\r\ngrowing every year in its proper season. Yet how few can\r\ntell the most simple and important facts about its planting\r\nand its growth!\r\n4. Corn, to do well, must have a rich soil and a warm\r\nclimate. It is a tender plant, and is easily injured by cold\r\nweather. The seed corn does not sprout, but rots, if the\r\nground is cold and wet.\r\n5. To prepare land properly for planting corn, the soil is\r\nmade fine by plowing, and furrows are run across the field\r\nfour feet apart each way. At every point where these furrows\r\ncross, the farmer drops from four to seven grains of seed\r\ncorn. These are then covered with about two inches of earth,\r\nand thus form "hills" of corn.\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t195\r\n6. In favorable weather, the tender blades push through\r\nthe ground in ten days or two weeks; then the stalks mount\r\nup rapidly, and the long, streamer-like leaves unfold\r\ngracefully from day to day. Corn must be carefully cultivated\r\nwhile the plants are small. After they begin to shade the\r\nground, they need but little hoeing or plowing.\r\n7. The moisture and earthy matter, drawn through the\r\nroots, become sap. This passes through the stalk, and enters\r\nthe leaves. There a great change takes place which results in\r\nthe starting of the ears and the growth of the grain.\r\n8. The maize plant bears two kinds of flowers,--male and\r\nfemale. The two are widely separated. The male flowers are\r\non the tassel; the fine silk threads which surround the ear,\r\nand peep out from the end of the husks, are the female\r\nflowers.\r\n9. Each grain on the cob is the starting point for a thread\r\nof silk; and, unless the thread receives some particle of the\r\ndust which falls from the tassel flowers, the kernel with\r\nwhich it is connected will not grow.\r\n10. The many uses of Indian corn and its products are\r\nworthy of note. The green\r\n\r\n\t196 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\nstalks and leaves make excellent fodder for cattle. The ripe\r\ngrain is used all over the earth as food for horses, pigs, and\r\npoultry. Nothing is better for fattening stock.\r\n11. Green corn, or "roasting ears," hulled corn and\r\nhominy, New England hasty pudding, and succotash are\r\nfavorite dishes with many persons. Then there are parched\r\ncorn and pop corn--the delight of long winter evenings.\r\n12. Cornstarch is an important article of commerce. Sirup\r\nand sugar are made from the juice of the stalk, and oil and\r\nalcohol from the ripened grain. Corn husks are largely used\r\nfor filling\r\n\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t197\r\nmattresses, and are braided into mats, baskets, and other\r\nuseful articles.\r\n13. Thus it will be seen how varied are the uses of Indian\r\ncorn. And besides being so useful, the plant is very beautiful.\r\nThe sight of a large cornfield in the latter part of summer,\r\nwith all its green banners waving and its tasseled plumes\r\nnodding, is one to admire, and not to be forgotten.\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON LXXIV.\r\nTHE SNOWBIRD\'S SONG.\r\n\r\n1.  The ground was all covered with snow one day,\r\nAnd two little sisters were busy at play,\r\nWhen a snowbird was sitting close by on a tree,\r\nAnd merrily singing his chick-a-de-dee.\r\n\r\n\t198 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n\r\n2.  He had not been singing that tune very long\r\nEre Emily heard him, so loud was his song;\r\n"O sister, look out of the window!" said she;\r\n"Here\'s a dear little bird singing chick-a-de-dee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.  "Poor fellow! he walks in the snow and the sleet,\r\nAnd has neither stockings nor shoes on his feet:\r\nI wonder what makes him so full of his glee;\r\nHe\'s all the time singing his chick-a-de-dee.\r\n\r\n4.  "If I were a barefooted snowbird, I know,\r\nI would not stay out in the cold and the snow;\r\nI pity him so! oh, how cold he must be!\r\nAnd yet he keeps singing his chick-a-de-dee.\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t199\r\n\r\n5. "O mother; do get him some stockings, and shoes,\r\nAnd a nice little frock, and a hat if he choose:\r\nI wish he\'d come into the parlor, and see\r\nHow warm we would make him, poor chick-a-de-dee!"\r\n\r\n6. The bird had flown down for some sweet crumbs of bread,\r\nAnd heard every word little Emily said:\r\n"What a figure I\'d make in that dress" thought he,\r\nAnd laughed as he warbled his chick-a-de-dee.\r\n\r\n7. "I am grateful," said he, "for the wish you express,\r\nBut have no occasion for such a fine dress;\r\nI rather remain with my little limbs free,\r\nThan to hobble about, singing chick-a-de-dee.\r\n\r\n8.  "There is One, my dear child, though I can not tell who,\r\nHas clothed me already, and warm enough, too.\r\nGood morning! Oh, who are so happy as we?"\r\nAnd away he flew, singing his chick-a-de-dee.\r\nF. C. Woodworth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\t200 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n\r\nLESSON LXXV.\r\nMOUNTAINS.\r\n1. The Himalayas are the highest mountains on our globe,\r\nThey are in Asia, and separate India from Thibet. They\r\nextend in a continuous line for more than a thousand miles.\r\n2. If you ever ascend one of these mountains from the\r\nplain below, you will have to cross an unhealthy border,\r\ntwenty miles in width. It is, in fact, a swamp caused by the\r\nwaters overflowing the river banks.\r\n3. The soil of this swampy border is covered with trees\r\nand shrubs, where the tiger, the elephant, and other animals\r\nfind secure retreat. Beyond this border, you will reach\r\nsmiling valleys and noble forests.\r\n4. As you advance onward and upward, you will get\r\namong bolder and more rugged scenes. The sides of the\r\nmountains are very steep, sometimes well wooded to quite a\r\nheight, but sometimes quite barren.\r\n5. In crossing a river you must be content with three ropes\r\nfor a bridge. You will find the streets of the towns to be\r\nsimply stairs\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t201\r\ncut out of the rock, and see the houses rising in tiers.\r\n6. The pathways into Thibet, among these mountains, are\r\nmere tracks by the side of\r\n\r\nfoaming torrents. Often, as you advance, you will find every\r\ntrace of the path swept away by the failing of rocks and earth\r\nfrom above.\r\n\r\n202 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\n7. Sometimes you will find posts driven into the mountain\r\nside, upon which branches of trees and earth are spread. This\r\nforms a trembling foothold for the traveler.\r\n8. In the Andes, in South America, the sure-footed mule is\r\nused to carry travelers. Quite often a chasm must be crossed\r\nthat is many feet wide and hundreds of feet deep. The mule\r\nwill leap across this chasm, but not until it is sure it can\r\nmake a safe jump.\r\n9. "One day," says a traveler, "I went by the worst pass\r\nover the Andes Mountains. The path for seventy yards was\r\nvery narrow, and at one point it was washed entirely away.\r\nOn one side the rock brushed my shoulder, and on the other\r\nside my foot overhung the precipice."\r\n10. The guide told this man, after he was safely over the\r\npass, that, to his knowledge, four hundred mules had fallen\r\nover that precipice, and in many instances travelers had lost\r\ntheir lives at that terrible spot.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t203\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON LXXVI.\r\n\r\nA CHILD\'S HYMN.\r\n\r\n1. God make my life a little light,\r\nWithin the world to glow;\r\nA little flame that burneth bright\r\nWherever I may go.\r\n\r\n2. God make my life a little flower,\r\nThat giveth joy to all,\r\nContent to bloom in native bower,\r\nAlthough its place be small.\r\n\r\n3. God make my life a little song,\r\nThat comforteth the sad;\r\nThat helpeth others to be strong,\r\nAnd makes the singer glad.\r\n\r\n4. God make my life a little hymn\r\nOf tenderness and praise;\r\nOf faith--that never waxeth dim\r\nIn all His wondrous ways.\r\n\r\n204 \tECLECTIC SERIES,\r\n\r\nLESSON LXXVII.\r\nHOLDING THE FORT.\r\n1. While Genie was walking slowly down street one day,\r\nshe heard an odd rapping on the pavement behind her.\r\nLooking round, she saw Rob Grey hobbling on crutches.\r\n2. "Why, what is the matter?" cried Genie. "I have n\'t seen\r\nyou for a week, and now you are walking in that way."\r\n3. "I shall have to walk in this way as much as a week\r\nlonger, Genie. I sprained my ankle by stopping too quick--\r\nno, not too quick, either, for there was something in my\r\nway."\r\n"What was it?" asked Genie.\r\n4. "One of the Commandments," replied Rob. "You\r\nremember how that lecturer talked to us about \'holding the\r\nfort\'? Well, I thought I should like to do it; but it\'s a pretty\r\nlong war, you know--all a lifetime, and no vacations--\r\nfurloughs, I think they call them."\r\n5. "If there was nothing to fight, we should not need to be\r\nsoldiers," said Genie.\r\n6. "Well, I thought I would try; but the\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t205\r\nfirst day, when we came out of the schoolhouse, Jack Lee\r\nsnatched my books out of my hand, and threw them into the\r\nmud.\r\n7. "I started after him as fast as I could run. I meant to\r\nthrow him where he had\r\n\r\nthrown the books, when, all of a sudden, I thought of the\r\nCommandment about returning good for evil.\r\n8. "I stopped short--so short, that, somehow,\r\n\r\n\t206 \tECLECTIC SERIES.\r\nmy foot twisted under me. So, you see, it was one of the\r\ncommandments."\r\n9. "If one must stumble at them, it is a good thing to fall\r\non the right side," said Genie, with a wise nod of her head.\r\n10. "The whole thing puzzles me, and makes me feel--\r\nwell, like giving it up," said Rob. "It might have served me\r\nright when I was chasing Jack; but when I thought of the\r\nCommandment, I really tried to do the right thing."\r\n11. "You did do it, Rob," said Genie. "You \'held the fort\'\r\nthat time. Why, do n\'t you see--you are only a wounded\r\nsoldier."\r\n12. "I never thought of that," said Rob.  "If I believe that\r\nway--" He began to whistle, and limped off to school without\r\nfinishing the sentence. But Genie knew, by the way he\r\nbehaved that day, that he had made up his mind to hold the\r\nfort.\r\n\r\n\r\n\tTHIRD READER. \t207\r\n\r\nLESSON LXXVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE LITTLE PEOPLE.\r\n\r\n1. A dreary place would be this earth,\r\nWere there no little people in it;\r\nThe song of life would lose its mirth,\r\nWere there no children to begin it;\r\n\r\n2. No little forms, like buds to grow,\r\nAnd make the admiring heart surrender;\r\nNo little hands on breast and brow,\r\nTo keep the thrilling love chords tender.\r\n\r\n3. The sterner souls would grow more stern,\r\nUnfeeling nature more inhuman,\r\nAnd man to utter coldness turn,\r\nAnd woman would be less than woman.\r\n\r\n4. Life\'s song, indeed, would lose its charm,\r\nWere there no babies to begin it;\r\nA doleful place this world would be,\r\nWere there no little people in it.\r\n\r\nJohn G.

Good night, my father, mother, dear!\r\nNow kiss your little son;\r\nGood night, my friends, both far and near!\r\nGood night to every one.\r\n\r\n3. Good night, ye merry, merry birds!\r\nSleep well till morning light;\r\nPerhaps, if you could sing in words,\r\nYou would have said, "Good night!"\r\n\r\n4. To all my pretty flowers, good night!\r\nYou blossom while I sleep;\r\nAnd all the stars, that shine so bright,\r\nWith you their watches keep.\r\n\r\n5.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
