pig,\r\n  That was not very little nor yet very big.\r\n  So here\'s an end of the song of all three,\r\n  Johnny Pringle, Betty Pringle, and little Piggy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n    The queen of hearts,\r\n    She made some tarts,\r\n  All on a summer\'s day;\r\n    The knave of hearts\r\n    He stole those tarts,\r\n  And with them ran away:\r\n    The king of hearts\r\n    Call\'d for those tarts,\r\n  And beat the knave full sore;\r\n    The knave of hearts\r\n    Brought back those tarts,\r\n  And said he\'d ne\'er steal more.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n    The king of spades\r\n    He kiss\'d the maids,\r\n  Which vex\'d the queen full sore;\r\n    The queen of spades\r\n    She beat those maids\r\n  And turn\'d them out of door;\r\n    The knave of spades\r\n    Grieved for those jades,\r\n  And did for them implore;\r\n    The queen so gent,\r\n    She did relent,\r\n  And vow\'d she\'d ne\'er strike more.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n    The king of clubs\r\n    He often drubs\r\n  His loving queen and wife;\r\n    The queen of clubs\r\n    Returns him snubs,\r\n  And all is noise and strife:\r\n    The knave of clubs\r\n    Gives winks and rubs,\r\n  And swears he\'ll take her _part_;\r\n    For when our kings\r\n    Will do such things,\r\n  They should be made to _smart_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n    The diamond king\r\n    I fain would sing,\r\n  And likewise his fair queen,\r\n    But that the knave,\r\n    A haughty slave,\r\n  Must needs step in between.\r\n    "Good diamond king,\r\n    With hempen string\r\n  This haughty knave destroy,\r\n    Then may your queen,\r\n    With mind serene,\r\n  Your royal love enjoy."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  There was a little guinea-pig,\r\n  Who, being little, was not big;\r\n  He always walk\'d upon his feet,\r\n  And never fasted when he eat.\r\n\r\n  When from a place he ran away,\r\n  He never at that place did stay;\r\n  And while he ran, as I am told,\r\n  He ne\'er stood still for young or old.\r\n\r\n  He often squeak\'d, was sometimes violent,\r\n  And when he squeak\'d he ne\'er was silent:\r\n  Though ne\'er instructed by a cat,\r\n  He knew a mouse was not a rat.\r\n\r\n  One day, as I am certified,\r\n  He took a whim and fairly died;\r\n  And, as I\'m told by men of sense,\r\n  He never has been living since.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  The king of France, with twenty thousand men,\r\n  March\'d up the hill, and then--march\'d back again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n  When good King Arthur ruled this land,\r\n    He was a goodly king;\r\n  He stole three pecks of barley-meal,\r\n    To make a bag-pudding.\r\n\r\n  A bag-pudding the king did make,\r\n    And stuff\'d it well with plums:\r\n  And in it put great lumps of fat,\r\n    As big as my two thumbs.\r\n\r\n  The king and queen did eat thereof,\r\n    And noblemen beside;\r\n  And what they could not eat at night,\r\n    The queen next morning fried.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        My dears, do you know\r\n        That a long time ago,\r\n          Two poor little children,\r\n        Whose names I don\'t know,\r\n  Were stolen away on a fine summer\'s day,\r\n  And left in a wood, so I\'ve heard people say.\r\n\r\n        And when it was night,\r\n        How sad was their plight!\r\n          The sun it went down,\r\n        And the moon gave no light!\r\n  They sobb\'d and they sigh\'d, and they bitterly cried,\r\n  And the poor little things they lay down and died.\r\n\r\n        And when they were dead,\r\n        The Robins so red\r\n          Brought strawberry leaves,\r\n        And over them spread;\r\n            And all the day long,\r\n            They sung them this song,\r\n  "Poor babes in the wood! poor babes in the wood!\r\n  Ah! don\'t you remember the babes in the wood?"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n  When I was a bachelor,\r\n    I lived by myself,\r\n  And all the bread and cheese I got\r\n    I put upon the shelf.\r\n  But the rats and the mice\r\n    They made such a strife,\r\n  I was forced to go to London\r\n    To get myself a wife:\r\n  The roads were so bad,\r\n    And the lanes were so narrow,\r\n  I was forced to bring my wife home\r\n    In a wheelbarrow.\r\n  The wheelbarrow broke,\r\n    And my wife had a fall,\r\n  Down came the wheelbarrow,\r\n    My wife, and all.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n  Gay go up and gay go down,\r\n  To ring the bells of London town.\r\n\r\n  Oranges and lemons,\r\n  Say the bells of St. Clement\'s.\r\n\r\n  Bull\'s

for thinking on\'t.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  I have a little sister, they call her Peep, Peep,\r\n  She wades in the water, deep, deep, deep,\r\n  She climbs up the mountains, high, high, high;\r\n  My

fiddlers.\r\n  Oh, there\'s none so rare,\r\n  As can compare\r\n  With King Cole and his fiddlers three!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Old Mother Goose, when\r\n    She wanted to wander,\r\n  Would ride through the air\r\n    On a very fine gander.\r\n\r\n  Mother Goose had a house,\r\n    \'Twas built in a wood,\r\n  Where an owl at the door\r\n    For sentinel stood.\r\n\r\n  This is her son Jack,\r\n    A plain-looking lad,\r\n  He is not very good,\r\n    Nor yet very bad.\r\n\r\n  She sent him to market,\r\n    A live goose he bought;\r\n  "Here, mother," says he,\r\n    "It will not go for nought."\r\n\r\n  Jack\'s goose and her gander\r\n    Grew very fond,\r\n  They\'d both eat together,\r\n    Or swim in one pond.\r\n\r\n  Jack found one morning,\r\n    As I have been told,\r\n  His goose had laid him\r\n    An egg of pure gold.\r\n\r\n  Jack rode to his mother,\r\n    The news for to tell;\r\n  She call\'d him a good boy,\r\n    And said it was well.\r\n\r\n  Jack sold his gold egg\r\n    To a rogue of a Jew,\r\n  Who cheated him out of\r\n    The half of his due.\r\n\r\n  Then Jack went a-courting\r\n    A lady so gay,\r\n  As fair as the lily\r\n    And sweet as the May.\r\n\r\n  The Jew and the Squire\r\n    Came close at his back,\r\n  And began to belabour\r\n    The sides of poor Jack.\r\n\r\n  They threw the gold egg\r\n    In the midst of the sea;\r\n  But Jack he jump\'d in,\r\n    And got it back presently.\r\n\r\n  The Jew got the goose,\r\n    Which he vow\'d he would kill,\r\n  Resolving at once\r\n    His pockets to fill.\r\n\r\n  Jack\'s mother came in,\r\n    And caught the goose soon,\r\n  And, mounting its back,\r\n    Flew up to the moon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHARRY\'S LADDER TO LEARNING.\r\n\r\nPART V.\r\n\r\nHARRY\'S SIMPLE STORIES.\r\n\r\n_From Mrs. Barbauld\'s "Lessons for Children."_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSIMPLE STORIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nGood morning, little boy; how do you do? Bring your little stool and sit\r\ndown by me, for I have a great deal to tell you.\r\n\r\nI hope you have been a good boy, and read all the pretty words I wrote\r\nfor you before. You have, you say; you have read them till you are\r\ntired, and you want some more new lessons. Come, then, sit down. Now you\r\nand I will tell stories.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJANUARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is very cold. It snows. It freezes. There are no leaves upon the\r\ntrees. The oil is frozen, and the milk is frozen, and the river is\r\nfrozen, and everything in the fields is frozen.\r\n\r\nAll the boys are sliding: you must learn to slide. There is a man\r\nskating. How fast he goes! You shall have a pair of skates. Take care!\r\nthere is a hole in the ice. Come in. It is four o\'clock. It is dark.\r\nLight the candles: and, Ralph! get some wood from the wood-house, and\r\nget some coals, and make a very good fire.\r\n\r\nNow get the large picture-book, and let us look at the pretty pictures,\r\nand I will tell you stories about them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEBRUARY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is still very cold, but the days are longer, and there is the yellow\r\ncrocus coming up, and the mezereon tree is in blossom, and there are\r\nsome white snow-drops peeping up their little heads. Pretty white\r\nsnow-drop, with a green stalk! May I gather it? Yes, you may; but you\r\nmust always ask leave before you gather a flower.\r\n\r\nWhen spring comes again there will be green leaves and flowers, daisies\r\nand pinks, and violets and roses; and there will be young lambs, and\r\nwarm weather. Come again, spring!\r\n\r\nWhat a noise the rooks make! Caw! caw! caw! and how busy they are! They\r\nare going to build their nests. There is a man ploughing the field. In a\r\nfew days the farmer will sow it with barley. Wheat is sown in the\r\nautumn. In some places oxen draw the plough instead of horses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARCH.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow the wind blows. It will blow such a little fellow as you away,\r\nalmost. There is a tree blown down. Which way does the wind blow? Take\r\nout your handkerchief. Throw it up. The wind blows it this way. The wind\r\ncomes from the north. The wind is north. It is a cold wind. The wind\r\nwas west yesterday: then it was warmer.\r\n\r\nHere is a lady-bird upon a leaf. It is red, and has black spots. Ah! it\r\nhas wings: it has flown away. There is a black beetle. Catch it. How\r\nfast it runs! Where is it gone? Into the ground. It makes a little hole\r\nand runs into the ground.\r\n\r\nThere are some young lambs. Poor things! how they creep under the hedge.\r\nWhat is this flower? A primrose. Where is Harry? He is sitting under a\r\ntree.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPRIL.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow the birds sing, and the trees are in blossom, and flowers are coming\r\nout, and butterflies, and the sun shines. Now it rains. It rains and the\r\nsun shines. There is a rainbow. Oh, what fine colours! Pretty bright\r\nrainbow! No, you cannot catch it; it is in the sky. It is going away.\r\nIt fades. It is quite gone. I hear the cuckoo. He says, Cuckoo! cuckoo!\r\nHe is come to tell us it is spring. Do you know the nursery rhyme about\r\nthe cuckoo?\r\n\r\n  The cuckoo\'s a bonny bird,\r\n    He sings as he flies;\r\n  He brings us good tidings,\r\n    And tells us no lies.\r\n  He sucks little birds\' eggs\r\n    To make his voice clear,\r\n  And always sings "Cuckoo"\r\n    When spring-time is near.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMAY.\r\n\r\n\r\nOh, pleasant May! Let us walk out in the fields. The hawthorn is in\r\nblossom. Let us go and get some out of the hedges. And here are daisies,\r\nand cowslips, and crow-flowers. We will make a nosegay. Smell, it is\r\nvery sweet! What has Harry got? He has got a nest of young birds. He has\r\nbeen climbing a high tree for them. Poor little birds! they have no\r\nfeathers. Keep them warm. You must feed them with a quill. You must give\r\nthem bread and milk. They are young goldfinches. They will be very\r\npretty when they have got their red head and yellow wings.\r\n\r\nWe will drink tea out of doors. Bring the tea-things. It is very\r\npleasant. But here is no table. What must we do? Oh, here is a large\r\nround stump of a tree! it will do very well for a table. But we have no\r\nchairs. Here is a seat of turf, and a bank almost covered with violets:\r\nwe shall sit here, and Harry may lie on the soft grass carpet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJUNE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat noise is that? It is the mower in the field whetting his scythe. He\r\nis going to cut down the grass. And will he cut down all the flowers\r\ntoo? Yes, everything. Now we must make hay. Where is your fork and rake?\r\nSpread the hay. Now make it up into cocks. Now tumble on the haycock.\r\nThere, cover Harry up with hay. How sweet the hay smells! Oh, it is very\r\nhot. No matter; you should make hay while the sun shines. You must work\r\nwell. See! all the lads and lasses are at work. They must have some\r\nbeer, and bread and cheese. Now put the hay in the cart. Will you ride\r\nin the cart? Huzza!\r\n\r\nIt is a pleasant evening. Come here, Harry: look at the sun. The sun is\r\nin the west. Yes, little boys say he is going to bed. How pretty the sun\r\nlooks! We can look at him now; he is not so bright as he was at\r\ndinner-time, when he was up high in the sky. And how beautiful the\r\nclouds are! There are crimson clouds, and purple and gold-coloured\r\nclouds. Now we can see only half of the sun. Now he is gone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJULY.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is very hot, indeed, now, and the grass and flowers are all burnt,\r\nfor it has not rained a great while. You must water your garden, else\r\nthe plants will die. Where is the watering-pot? Let us go under the\r\ntrees. It is shady there: it is not so hot. Come into the arbour. There\r\nis a bee upon the honey-suckle. He is getting honey. He will carry it to\r\nthe hive.\r\n\r\nWill you go and bathe in the water? Here is the river. It is not deep.\r\nPull off your clothes. Jump in. Do not be afraid. Pop your head in. Now\r\ntry to swim. Do you see that little frog? You should swim just as the\r\nlittle frog swims.\r\n\r\nNow you have been in the water long enough. Come out, and let me dry you\r\nwith this towel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUGUST.\r\n\r\n\r\nLet us go into the corn-fields to see if the corn is almost ripe. Yes,\r\nit is quite brown; it is ripe. Farmer Diggory! you must bring a sharp\r\nsickle and cut down the corn; it is ripe. Now it must be tied up in\r\nsheaves. Now put a great many sheaves together, and make a shock.\r\n\r\nThere is a poor old woman picking up some ears of corn; and a poor\r\nlittle girl with her. They are gleaning. Give them your handful, Harry.\r\nTake it, poor woman, it will help to make you a loaf.\r\n\r\nLook, there are black clouds. How fast they move along! Now they have\r\nhid the sun. There is a little bit of blue sky still. Now it is all\r\ncovered with black clouds. It is very dark, like night. It will rain\r\nsoon. Now it begins. What large drops! The ducks are very glad, but the\r\nlittle birds are not glad; they go and shelter themselves under the\r\ntrees. Now the rain is over. It was only a shower. Now the flowers smell\r\nsweet, and the sun shines, and the little birds sing again, and it is\r\nnot so hot as it was before it rained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEPTEMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\nHark! somebody is letting off a gun! They are shooting the poor birds.\r\nHere is a bird dropped down just at your feet. It is all bloody. Poor\r\nthing! how it flutters! Its wing is broken. It cannot fly any further.\r\nIt is going to die. What bird is it? It is a partridge. Are you not\r\nsorry, Harry? It was alive a little while ago.\r\n\r\nBring the ladder, and set it against the tree. Now bring a basket. We\r\nmust gather apples. No, you cannot go up the ladder; you must have a\r\nlittle basket, and pick up apples under the tree. Shake the tree. Down\r\nthey come. How many have you got? We will have an apple-dumpling. Come,\r\nyou must help to carry the apples into the apple-chamber. Apples make\r\ncyder. You shall have some baked pears and bread for supper, and some\r\ncyder. Are these apples? No, they are quinces; they will make marmalade.\r\nDo not be in such haste, little boy; you shall have some cyder directly.\r\nYou must not drink much.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe leaves are falling off the trees now, and the flowers are all gone.\r\nNo, here is an African marigold, and a China-aster, and a Michaelmas\r\ndaisy. And here are a few roses left.\r\n\r\nWill you have any nuts? Fetch the nut-crackers. Peel this walnut. I will\r\nmake you a little boat of the walnut-shell, and you can swim it in a\r\npan. We must get the grapes, or else the birds will eat them all. Here\r\nis a bunch of black grapes. Here is a bunch of white ones. Which will\r\nyou have? Grapes make wine.\r\n\r\nWhat bird have you got there? It is dead, but it is very pretty. It has\r\na scarlet eye, and red, and green, and purple feathers. It is very\r\nlarge. It is a pheasant. He is very good to eat. We will pull off his\r\nfeathers, and tell Betty Cook to roast him. Here is a hare too. Poor\r\npuss! the hounds did catch her.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOVEMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow dark and dismal it is! No more flowers! no more pleasant sunshine!\r\nno more haymaking! The sky is very black: the rain pours down. Well,\r\nnever mind it; we will sit by the fire, and read, and tell stories, and\r\nlook at pictures. I wonder what poor little boys do that have no fire to\r\ngo to, and no shoes and stockings to keep them warm, and no victuals to\r\neat? Here is a halfpenny, Harry, and when you see one of those poor\r\nboys you shall give it to him. He will say, "Thank you, you are very\r\ngood!" and then he will buy a roll.\r\n\r\nWhere are Billy, and Harry, and Betsy? Now tell me who can spell best.\r\nGood boy! Now you shall all have some cake. That is right, Jane, shut\r\nthe cupboard door.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEMBER.\r\n\r\n\r\nChristmas is coming, and Betty is very busy. What is she doing? She is\r\nparing apples, and chopping meat, and beating spice. What for, I wonder?\r\nIt is to make mince-pies. Do you love mince-pies? Oh, they are very\r\ngood!\r\n\r\nLook! a pretty little robin is flying against the window. Open the\r\nwindow. Well, what do you want, little robin? Only a few crumbs of\r\nbread. Give him some crumbs, and he will hop, hop about the parlour, and\r\nsit upon the top of the screen, and sing--oh, he will sing all day\r\nlong! Now pray do not let that wicked cat take him. No, puss! you must\r\ngo and catch mice; you shall not eat poor robin.\r\n\r\nLittle boys come from school at Christmas. Pray wrap them up warm, for\r\nit is very cold. Well, spring will come again some time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE IDLE BOY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was a little boy; he was not a big boy, for if he had been a big\r\nboy I suppose he would have been wiser; but this was a little boy, not\r\nhigher than the table, and his papa and mamma sent him to school. It was\r\na very pleasant morning; the sun shone, and the birds sung on the trees.\r\nNow this little boy did not much love his book, for he was but a silly\r\nlittle boy, as I told you; and he had a great mind to play instead of\r\ngoing to school. And he saw a [Illustration]\r\n\r\nbee flying about, first upon one flower, and then upon another; so he\r\nsaid, "Pretty bee! will you come and play with me?" But the bee said,\r\n"No, I must not be idle; I must go and gather honey." Then the little\r\nboy met a dog, and he said, "Dog! will you play with me?" But the dog\r\nsaid, "No, I must not be idle; I am going to catch a hare for my\r\nmaster\'s dinner: I must make haste and catch it." Then the little boy\r\nwent by a hay-rick, and he saw a bird pulling some hay out of the\r\nhay-rick, and he said, "Bird! will you come and play with me?" But the\r\nbird said, "No, I must not be idle; I must get some hay to build my nest\r\nwith, and some moss, and some wool." So the bird flew away. Then the\r\nlittle boy saw a horse, and he said, "Horse! will you play with me?" But\r\nthe horse said, "No, I must not be idle; I must go and plough, or else\r\nthere will be no corn to make bread of." Then the little boy thought\r\nwith himself, "What! is nobody idle? then little boys must not be idle\r\nneither." So he made haste, and went to school, and learned his lesson\r\nvery well, and the master said he was a good boy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGATHERING APPLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nSee, here is Mamma, and here are Maria, and Harry, and Herbert. They are\r\nin the orchard gathering apples to put into puddings. See, Mamma is\r\nshaking the tree, and Maria is catching the apples in her frock. And\r\nlook, how busy Harry and Herbert are! I hope they will not eat too many\r\napples.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHARRY\'S LADDER TO LEARNING.\r\n\r\nPART VI.\r\n\r\nHARRY\'S COUNTRY WALK.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNTRY WALK.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nEarly one morning during last summer, Harry and I put on our hats, and\r\ntaking some cake in our pockets for lunch set out for a good long walk.\r\nFirst we went through the Home Meadow, where the tall elm-trees are, and\r\nthen through the gate at the bottom of the valley into the corn-fields.\r\nThe sun was shining bright and clear, and a lark was singing high up in\r\nthe blue sky almost beyond our sight. Harry and I stood still to watch\r\nits descent, and after many minutes we saw it alight near a tuft of\r\ngrass by the hedge-side. We walked a little nearer, and then we found\r\nthat there was another bird there with some young ones; so we thought\r\nthat this lark had been singing its long, sweet song in the air to\r\ncheer its mate, who was feeding their little ones in the nest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWe then walked on, and soon came to the skirts of the wood, through\r\nwhich runs a little stream. We thought there must be some one in the\r\nwood, for we heard a smart tapping sound, like the noise of a little\r\nhammer. I climbed on the top of a hedge-bank, and, after a little while,\r\nfound that the noise came from over our heads. On the trunk of a tree\r\nwere two wood-peckers pecking with their long beaks at the bark of a\r\nfir-tree, in which they find a number of little insects, which serve\r\nthem for their food. I lifted Harry up to see them at their work, but he\r\ndid not frighten them, and at some long way off we could still hear them\r\ntapping away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nJust at the corner of the wood, as we were turning round by the side of\r\nthe fence, we saw two hares and a rabbit feeding among the clover; one\r\nof them pricked up his ears and looked at us for a moment, and then all\r\nof them ran away across the field much faster than Harry, who tried all\r\nhe could to catch them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWe had not walked much further when we heard a great chattering, and\r\nwhen we came to a young beech-tree close by the stile, we soon found the\r\ncause of the noise. About two dozen or more of a little bird called the\r\ntitmouse had all perched on one tree, where they were pecking, and\r\nfighting, and love-making, and noise-making, all at the same time.\r\nExcept the noise made by sparrows when they go to bed on a summer\'s\r\nevening, I never heard the like.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhile I was amusing myself by watching the titmice, Harry, who had\r\nrambled on a little way, came running back to ask me what the funny\r\nthing could be that he had found. It was a mole that had been caught in\r\na trap, and was dangling in the air with a swarm of bees around. I told\r\nHarry that the moles are blind, or nearly so, and that they live under\r\nthe ground, and do great good to the farmers by eating the slugs and\r\nother things that destroy the corn; but that they turn up such great\r\nmounds of earth when making their tunnels, that the farmers are often\r\nglad to get rid of them, and therefore set traps to kill them.\r\n\r\nIn the next field we came to, the young wheat had grown up higher than\r\nmy knees, and Harry was greatly pleased at running down the furrows and\r\nmaking the blades of corn bend before him. Presently he stopped and\r\npeeped through an opening, whence he discovered a whole covey of\r\npartridges, the two old birds and seven young ones; they all rose with a\r\nwhirring noise, and flew into the field we had just left.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSoon after the partridges had flown away, Harry was delighted to hear\r\nthe well-known voice of the cuckoo; it sounded so near us that we both\r\nstarted at the first voice, and we soon found out where the cuckoo was.\r\nLike a lazy tyrant, instead of making a house for himself, the cuckoo\r\ntakes the first little bird\'s nest he can find, and turns the poor\r\noccupant away. When we reached the tree where the cuckoo was, we saw it\r\nsitting on a small nest throwing out the eggs of a poor little bird, who\r\nwas screaming in anger at the intruder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen I told Harry what the cuckoo had been doing, he wanted to throw a\r\nstone at it, but I told him that this cuckoo was only doing what all\r\nother cuckoos did, and that the poor little bird would soon build itself\r\nanother nest. As we walked on, still by the side of the wood, Harry saw\r\nsomething jumping about in the boughs of a tree; and presently another\r\nfollowed it: they were two squirrels, with their long bushy tails curled\r\nover their backs, and their ears pricked up to hear the slightest noise.\r\nAs soon as they saw Harry looking at them they both leaped away, and we\r\nlost them in the branches of a large oak. To look after the squirrels\r\nwe had climbed over the hedge, so we were walking a little way in the\r\nwood. Presently I heard the call of a pheasant; and as we walked\r\nfurther, we came to some brush-wood, under which were two old birds and\r\ntheir young ones. They all flew away at our approach; but the old\r\ncock-pheasant left two of his tail-feathers in the brush-wood, which\r\nHarry soon picked up to decorate his hat with.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe next bird that caught our notice was a fly-catcher. It was sitting\r\non a bramble catching bees and flies, and so intently was it watching\r\nfor them, that it did not even notice our presence, till Harry tried to\r\nput his hand on it, but then away it flew with a fine chattering.\r\n\r\nWe now left the wood, and taking the foot-path to the left, went along\r\ntill we came to the road. Just by the stile sat a girl, who had been\r\ngathering dried sticks in the wood, where her father was cutting down\r\ntrees. She had tied up the sticks into a bundle, and was sitting on them\r\nto rest herself, because they were so heavy. She asked me to help her to\r\nput them on her head; this I did, and then she thanked me, and trudged\r\non, singing as merrily as a lark in the sky.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNow we came to a bridge over a wide river. I mounted Harry astride the\r\nparapet, and there we stopped for some minutes to look at the boats as\r\nthey passed under us, and to watch two swans which were sailing up the\r\nriver with their great wings spread out for sails, and their necks so\r\nproudly bent that they looked like the king and queen of the river.\r\nHarry would have stayed for hours to look at them, but we could not stop\r\nlong.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWe next turned down the pathway by the river-side, and soon we came to\r\nthe wide marshes, which are only two miles off the sea. There we were\r\nstanding under a willow, watching for the fish which were swimming down\r\nthe river in little shoals, when we heard a splash on the opposite bank;\r\nit was an otter that had dived into the river, and caught a fish, with\r\nwhich we saw it climb on to the bank again. Men used to hunt the otter\r\nwith dogs and spears; and sometimes otters have been trained to catch\r\nfish and bring them to land, but we do not often find them in England.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAs we walked on by the river-side, we noticed a hawk flying swiftly over\r\nus; afterwards we saw him balance himself on his wings, and keep for\r\nmany minutes in exactly the same place. Presently, with a loud scream,\r\nhe darted down into some rushes a little way before us, and then we\r\nheard a most furious quacking, as if there were fifty ducks there. We\r\nran on and saw a drake flying at the hawk and pecking at its wings, and\r\nthe duck, quacking in the utmost alarm, tried to get all her little\r\nducklings under her wings; but, alas! one little truant ran into the\r\nweeds, and the hawk caught it in his claws, and, in spite of all the\r\nefforts of the poor drake, flew away with it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHarry was greatly excited at this scene, and cried to see the hawk carry\r\naway the poor little duck; but he soon laughed again, for as he watched\r\nthe robber in his flight through the air, he saw a number of little\r\nbirds fly after him,--sparrows, swallows, finches, all chirping at him\r\nand mocking him; then a tribe of bigger birds, blackbirds, magpies,\r\nrooks, and jays, flew after him also; and as the hawk could not fly fast\r\nwith the duckling in his claws, they soon overtook him, and we saw them\r\npeck at his wings and his tail, and pull his feathers out; and they all\r\nscreamed and chattered at him till at last the hawk let the poor\r\nduckling down into the marsh, and then, rising much higher than the\r\nother birds, flew away so quickly that he was out of sight in a minute.\r\nHarry clapped his hands with delight to see the hawk thus treated, and\r\nsaid that he was rightly served.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNow we walked on again by the river-side. The swallows skimmed along\r\nthe surface of the water, and caught the insects that hovered over it,\r\nand now and then a sea-gull came with its great wings, and diving into\r\nthe river, bore away a poor fish in its beak to swallow at its leisure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThen we came close to a solemn-looking heron, who stood so still that\r\nwe could hardly tell if he were alive, till we saw him suddenly dive his\r\nhead in a pool of water and pull out a frog, which he swallowed at one\r\nmouthful; and then he stood as still and solemn as ever. He flew away\r\nwhen we walked near him, flapping his immense wings slowly, and giving a\r\nmournful cry.\r\n\r\nThen we turned away from the river, and took a path across the meadows,\r\nwhere Harry ran about and gathered cowslips and buttercups until he was\r\nquite tired; therefore it happened very luckily that just as we reached\r\nthe gate into the high-road, who should we see but Uncle George driving\r\npast in his gig! He stopped his horse when he saw us, and both Harry and\r\nI were very glad to have a nice ride home with him.\r\n\r\nIn the evening Harry and I went for a stroll in the fields near home,\r\nand presently we came to one where the sheep were feeding. The shepherd\r\nwas just calling them home to be put in the fold, and we were very much\r\namused to see the antics of some of the young lambs that would skip\r\nabout instead of going to bed with their mothers. This put me in mind to\r\ntell Harry Mrs. Barbauld\'s story about\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SILLY LITTLE LAMB.\r\n\r\nThere was once a shepherd, who had a great many sheep and lambs. He took\r\na great deal of care of them, and gave them sweet fresh grass to eat,\r\nand clear water to drink; and if they were sick he was very good to\r\nthem; and when they climbed up a steep hill, and the lambs were tired,\r\nhe used to carry them in his arms; and when they were all eating their\r\nsuppers in the field, he used to sit upon a stile, and play them a\r\ntune, and sing to them. And so they were the happiest sheep and lambs in\r\nthe whole world. But every night this shepherd used to pen them up in a\r\nfold. Do you know what a sheepfold is? Well, I will tell you. It is a\r\nplace like the court; but instead of pales there are hurdles, which are\r\nmade of sticks that will bend, such as osier twigs; and they are twisted\r\nand made very fast, so that nothing can creep in, and nothing can get\r\nout. Well, and so every night, when it grew dark and cold, the shepherd\r\ncalled all his flock, sheep and lambs, together, and drove them into the\r\nfold, and penned them up, and there they lay as snug and warm and\r\ncomfortable as could be, and nothing could get in to hurt them, and the\r\ndogs lay round on the outside to guard them, and to bark if any body\r\ncame near; and in the morning the shepherd unpenned the fold, and let\r\nthem all out again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNow they were all very happy, as I told you, and loved the shepherd\r\ndearly that was so good to them--all except one foolish little lamb. And\r\nthis lamb did not like to be shut up every night in the fold; and she\r\ncame to her mother, who was a wise old sheep, and said to her, "I wonder\r\nwhy we are shut up so every night? the dogs are not shut up, and why\r\nshould we be shut up? I think it is very hard, and I will get away if I\r\ncan, I am resolved; for I like to run about where I please, and I think\r\nit is very pleasant in the woods by moonlight." Then the old sheep\r\nsaid to her, "You are very silly, you little lamb, you had better stay\r\nin the fold. The shepherd is so good to us, that we should always do as\r\nhe bids us; and if you wander about by yourself, I dare say you will\r\ncome to some harm." "I dare say not," said the little lamb. And so when\r\nthe evening came, and the shepherd called them all to come into the\r\nfold, she would not come, but crept slily under a hedge and hid herself;\r\nand when the rest of the lambs were all in the fold and fast asleep,\r\nshe came out, and jumped, and frisked, and danced about; and she got out\r\nof the field, and got into a forest full of trees, and a very fierce\r\nwolf came rushing out of a cave and howled very loud. Then the silly\r\nlamb wished she had been shut up in the fold, but the fold was a great\r\nway off. And the wolf saw her and seized her, and carried her away to a\r\ndismal den; and there the wolf had two cubs, and the wolf said to them,\r\n"Here, I have brought you a young fat lamb." And so the cubs took her,\r\nand growled over her a little while, and then ate her up.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHarry said that was a very naughty lamb.\r\n\r\nIt now began to be quite dark, so Harry and I returned home. Then we had\r\na long talk about what we had seen during the day; and then Harry had\r\nhis bread and milk for supper, and then he said his prayers and went to\r\nbed.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nPLEASURE BOOKS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE,\r\n\r\nBEAUTIFULLY ILLUSTRATED BY\r\n\r\nJOHN ABSOLON, EDWARD WEHNERT, AND HARRISON WEIR.\r\n\r\nPRICE SIXPENCE EACH PLAIN,\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\nONE SHILLING EACH COLOURED.\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE HISTORY OF LITTLE BO-PEEP.\r\n  THE HOUSE THAT JACK BUILT.\r\n  THE WEDDING OF COCK ROBIN AND JENNY WREN.\r\n  THE CAT AND THE MOUSE.\r\n  THE DEATH AND BURIAL OF COCK ROBIN.\r\n  THE OLD DAME AND HER SILVER SIXPENCE.\r\n  THE LIFE AND DEATH OF JENNY WREN.\r\n  THE STORY OF OLD MOTHER HUBBARD.\r\n  THE LITTLE MAN AND THE LITTLE MAID.\r\n  THE STORY OF THE THREE BEARS.\r\n  THE FOX AND THE GEESE.\r\n  THE HISTORY OF LITTLE GOODY TWO-SHOES.\r\n  THE UGLY DUCK\'S STORY.\r\n  THE CHARMED FAWN OF THE FOREST.\r\n  THE STORY OF LUCKY HANS.\r\n  THE HISTORY OF PUSS IN BOOTS.\r\n  THE FAMOUS HISTORY OF ROBIN HOOD.\r\n  THE STORY OF RIP VAN WINKLE.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLITTLE MARY\'S BOOKS,\r\n\r\n\r\nPRICE SIXPENCE EACH,\r\n\r\nADORNED WITH NUMEROUS ILLUSTRATIONS.\r\n\r\n  LITTLE MARY\'S PRIMER.\r\n  LITTLE MARY\'S READING BOOK.\r\n  LITTLE MARY\'S SPELLING-BOOK.\r\n  LITTLE MARY\'S ENGLISH HISTORY.\r\n  LITTLE MARY\'S SCRIPTURE HISTORY.\r\n  LITTLE MARY\'S FIRST BOOK OF POETRY.\r\n  LITTLE MARY\'S SECOND BOOK OF POETRY.\r\n  LITTLE MARY\'S BABES IN THE WOOD.\r\n\r\nINDESTRUCTIBLE BOOKS FOR CHILDREN.\r\n\r\nPRINTED ON A PATENT CLOTH,\r\n\r\n_Price One Shilling each,_\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nPATENT INDESTRUCTIBLE ALPHABET,\r\n\r\nWITH TWENTY-SIX ILLUSTRATIONS BY JOHN ABSOLON.\r\n\r\nTHE\r\n\r\nPATENT INDESTRUCTIBLE PRIMER,\r\n\r\nWITH FORTY ILLUSTRATIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nHARRY\'S BOOKS.\r\n\r\nPRICE SIXPENCE EACH PLAIN, ONE SHILLING COLOURED.\r\n\r\n  HARRY\'S HORN-BOOK, with 58 Pictures.\r\n  HARRY\'S PICTURE-BOOK, with 46 Pictures.\r\n  HARRY\'S NURSERY SONGS, with 35 Pictures.\r\n  HARRY\'S NURSERY TALES, with 35 Pictures.\r\n  HARRY\'S SIMPLE STORIES, with 28 Pictures.\r\n  HARRY\'S COUNTRY WALKS, with 21 Pictures.\r\n\r\n_Or Bound in One Volume, complete_,\r\n\r\nHARRY\'S LADDER TO LEARNING,\r\n\r\nWITH TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY ILLUSTRATIONS,\r\n\r\n_Price 3s. 6d.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
