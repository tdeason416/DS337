The moral tone is plain. "She is kind\r\nto the old blind man."\r\n\r\nThe exercises are still suitable, and perhaps more helpful than some\r\ncontemporary alternatives. Much is left to the teacher. Explanations given\r\nin the text are enough to get started teaching a child to read and write.\r\nCounting in Roman numerals is included as a bonus in the form of lesson\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\nEach lesson begins with vocabulary words, followed by the description of a\r\npicture (if any) related to the lesson\'s reading exercise. The lesson then\r\nconsists of printed text for reading and sometimes script (handwriting)\r\nfor reading or copying.\r\n\r\nDon Kostuch\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECLECTIC EDUCATIONAL SERIES.\r\n\r\nMCGUFFEY\'S [Registered]\r\n\r\nFirst\r\n\r\nECLECTIC READER\r\n\r\nRevised Edition\r\n\r\n\r\nMcGuffey Edition and Colophon are Trademarks of\r\n\r\nJOHN WILEY & SONS, INC.\r\nNEW YORK - CHICHESTER - WEINHEIM - BRISBANE - SINGAPORE - TORONTO\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIONS TO TEACHERS.\r\n\r\nThis First Reader may be used in teaching reading by any of the methods in\r\ncommon use; but it is especially adapted to the Phonic Method, the Word\r\nMethod, or a combination of the two.\r\n\r\nI. Phonic Method.--First teach the elementary sounds and their\r\nrepresentative, the letters marked with diacriticals, as they occur in the\r\nlessons; then, the formation of words by the combination of these sounds.\r\nFor instance, teach the pupil to identify the characters a, o, n, d, g, r,\r\nand th, in Lesson I, as the representatives of certain elementary sounds;\r\nthen teach him to form the words at the head of the lesson, then other\r\nwords, as nag, on, and, etc. Pursue a similar course in teaching the\r\nsucceeding lessons. Having read a few lessons in this manner, begin to\r\nteach the names of the letters and the spelling of words, and require the\r\ngroups, "a man," "the man," "a pen," to be read as a good reader would\r\npronounce single words.\r\n\r\nII.  When one of the letters in the combinations ou or ow, is marked in\r\nthe words at the head of the reading exercises, the other is silent. If\r\nneither is marked, the two letters represent a diphthong. All other\r\nunmarked vowels in the vocabularies, when in combination, are silent\r\nletters. In slate or blackboard work, the silent letters may be canceled.\r\n\r\nIII. Word Method.--Teach the pupil to identify at sight the words placed\r\nat the head of the reading exercises, and to read these exercises without\r\nhesitation. Having read a few lessons, begin to teach the names of the\r\nletters and the spelling of words.\r\n\r\nIV. Word Method and Phonic Method Combined.--Teach the pupil to identify\r\nwords and read sentences, as above. Having read a few lessons in this\r\nmanner, begin to use the Phonic Method, combining it with the Word Method,\r\nby first teaching the words in each lesson as words; then the elementary\r\nsounds, the names of the letters, and spelling.\r\n\r\nV. Teach the pupil to use script letters in writing, when teaching the\r\nnames of the letters and the spelling of words.\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright, 1879, by Van Antwerp, Bragg & Co.\r\nCopyright, 1896, by American Book Company.\r\nCopyright, 1907 and 1920, by H.H. Vail.\r\n\r\nEP486\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreface\r\n\r\nIn presenting McGuffey\xc2\x92s Revised First Reader to the public, attention is\r\ninvited to the following features:\r\n\r\n1. Words of only two or three letters are used in the first lessons.\r\nLonger and more difficult ones are gradually introduced as the pupil gains\r\naptness in the mastery of words.\r\n\r\n2. A proper gradation has been carefully preserved. All new words are\r\nplaced at the head of each lesson, to be learned before the lesson is\r\nread. Their number in the early lessons is very small, thus making the\r\nfirst steps easy. All words in these vocabularies are used in the text\r\nimmediately following.\r\n\r\n3. Carefully engraved script exercises are introduced for a double\r\npurpose. These should be used to teach the reading of script; and may also\r\nserve as copies in slate work.\r\n\r\n4. The illustrations have been designed and engraved specially for the\r\nlessons in which they occur. Many of the engravings will serve admirably\r\nas the basis for oral lessons in language.\r\n\r\n5. The type is large, strong, and distinct.\r\n\r\nThe credit for this revision is almost wholly due to the  friends of\r\nMcGuffey\xc2\x92s Readers,--eminent teachers and scholars, who have contributed\r\nsuggestions and criticisms gained from their daily work in the schoolroom.\r\n\r\nCincinnati, June, 1879.\r\n\r\n                                                                     (iii)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ALPHABET.\r\n\r\nA    a      N   n\r\nB    b      O   o\r\nC    c      P   p\r\nD    d      Q   q\r\nE    e      R   r\r\nF    f      S   s\r\nG    g      T   t\r\nH    h      U   u\r\nI    i      V   v\r\nJ    j      W   w\r\nK    k      X   x\r\nL    l      Y   y\r\nM    m      Z   z\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\nScript Alphabet\r\n\r\nA  B  C  D  E  F  G\r\nH  I  J  K  L  M  N\r\nO  P  Q  R  S  Y  U\r\nV  W  X  Y  Z\r\n\r\na  b  c  d  e  f  g  h  i\r\nj  k  l  m  n  o  p  q\r\nr  s  t  u  v  w  x  y  z\r\n\r\nSCRIPT FIGURES\r\n\r\n1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  0\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dog]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMcGuffey\'s FIRST READER.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON I.\r\n\r\ndog   the   ran\r\n\r\na   o    n   d   g   r   th\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Running dog.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe dog.\r\n\r\nThe dog ran.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON II.\r\n\r\ncat    mat    is    on\r\n\r\nc    t    i    m    s\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cat]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cat.

His father and mother were dead. His\r\ndear, old grandma took care of him, and tried to make him happy.\r\n\r\nEvery day, Mary\'s mother filled Frank\'s basket with bread and meat, and a\r\nlittle tea for his grandma.\r\n\r\n"How do you do, Frank?" said Mary. "Don\'t make a noise; my doll is going\r\nto sleep. It is just a little sick to-day."\r\n\r\n"Well, then, let us whistle it to sleep."

Mary blew and blew a long time. "I can\'t make\r\nit whistle," said she, almost ready to cry.\r\n\r\n"Sometimes they will whistle, and sometimes they won\'t," said Frank. "Try\r\nagain, Mary."\r\n\r\nShe tried once more, and the whistle made a low, sweet sound. "It\r\nwhistles!" she cried.\r\n\r\nIn her joy, she had turned the doll\'s face down, and its eyes shut tight,\r\nas if it had gone to sleep.\r\n\r\n"There!" cried Frank, "I told you the way to put a doll to sleep, is to\r\nwhistle to it."\r\n\r\n"So it is," said Mary. "Dear, little thing; it must be put in its bed\r\nnow."\r\n\r\nSo they went into the house.

They were\r\nvery small, and the old hen took good care of them. She found food for\r\nthem in the daytime, and at night kept them under her wings.\r\n\r\nOne day, this old hen took her chickens down to a small brook. She thought\r\nthe air from the water would do them good.\r\n\r\nWhen they got to the brook, they walked on the bank a little while. It was\r\nvery pretty on the other side of the brook, and the old hen thought she\r\nwould take her children over there.\r\n\r\nThere was a large stone in the brook: she thought it would be easy for\r\nthem to jump to that stone, and from it to the other side.\r\n\r\nSo she jumped to the stone, and told the children to come after her. For\r\nthe first time, she found that they would not obey her.\r\n\r\nShe flapped her wings, and cried, "Come here, all of you! Jump upon this\r\nstone, as I did. We can then jump to the other side. Come now!"\r\n\r\n"O mother! we can\'t, we can\'t, we can\'t!" said all the little chickens.\r\n\r\n"Yes you can, if you try," said the old hen. "Just flap your wings, as I\r\ndid, and you can jump over."\r\n\r\n"I am flapping my wings," said Chippy, who stood by himself; "but I can\'t\r\njump any better than I could before."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON LXII.\r\n\r\nchirped    nev\'er     in deed\'    slow\'ly    re\'ally    brood\r\n\r\nbe gan\'    did n\'t    use         door       bite       piece\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hen with chicks.]\r\n\r\n\r\n"I never saw such children," said the old hen. "You don\'t try at all."\r\n\r\n"We can\'t jump so far, mother. Indeed we can\'t, we can\'t!" chirped the\r\nlittle chickens.\r\n\r\n"Well," said the old hen, "I must give it up." So she jumped back to the\r\nbank, and walked slowly home with her brood.\r\n\r\n"I think mother asked too much of us," said one little chicken to the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\n"Well, I tried," said Chippy.\r\n\r\n"We didn\'t," said the others; "it was of no use to try."\r\n\r\nWhen they got home, the old hen began to look about for something to eat.\r\nShe soon found, near the back door, a piece of bread.\r\n\r\nSo she called the chickens, and they all ran up to her, each one trying to\r\nget a bite at the piece of bread.\r\n\r\n"No, no!" said the old hen. "This bread is for Chippy. He is the only one\r\nof my children that really tried to jump to the stone."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON LXIII.\r\n\r\nlast    slates    write     waste     neat     taken\r\n\r\nclean   learn     read\'er   par\'ents  sec\'ond\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Teacher with four students in classroom.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have come to the last lesson in this book.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
