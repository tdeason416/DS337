Evidently the message was puzzling. Again Mr. Clark read it.\r\nDonald wondered what it could be. All the afternoon the yellow envelope\r\nhad been on the table, and more than once his mind had wandered from the\r\nlessons he was preparing to speculate on the possible tidings wrapped\r\nup in that sealed packet. Not that a telegram was an unheard-of event in\r\nthe family. No, his father received many; most of them, however, went to\r\nthe Boston office, and the boy could not imagine what this one was doing\r\nat their Cambridge home.\r\n\r\nThe moment his father entered the house Donald handed him the envelope\r\nand Mr. Clark quickly stripped it open; yet even though it now lay\r\nspread out before him the mystery it contained appeared to be unsolved.\r\nIt was seldom that Donald asked questions, nevertheless he found himself\r\nwondering and wondering what it was that had brought that odd little\r\nwrinkle into his father\'s forehead. Donald understood that wrinkle; he\r\nhad seen it many times and knew it never came unless some question arose\r\nto which it was difficult to frame an answer. As his father and he had\r\nlived alone together ever since he could remember they had grown to know\r\neach other very well, and had become the best of friends. It therefore\r\nfollowed that when one worried, both worried.\r\n\r\nAs the boy looked on, his father glanced up suddenly and caught sight\r\nof the anxiety mirrored in his face. The man smiled kindly.\r\n\r\n"I can find no answer to this riddle, Don," he said. "Listen! Perhaps\r\nyou can help me. A few days ago I received word from Crescent Ranch that\r\nJohnson, our manager, had been thrown from his horse while out on the\r\nrange and so badly hurt that he will never again be able to continue his\r\nwork with us. They have taken him to the hospital at Glen City. The\r\nletter came from Tom Thornton, the head herder at the ranch. Thornton\r\nassured me that everything was going well, and that there was not the\r\nslightest need for me to come to Idaho."\r\n\r\nDonald listened.\r\n\r\n"Well, to-day I received this telegram. It is neither from Johnson nor\r\nThornton. It reads:\r\n\r\n"\'You would do well to visit Crescent Ranch,\' and it is signed--\'Sandy\r\nMcCulloch.\'"\r\n\r\n"Who is Sandy McCulloch?" asked Donald.\r\n\r\n"That\'s the puzzle! I do not know. I never heard of any such person in\r\nmy life--not that I remember. Evidently, though, he knows enough about\r\nme to know that I own that sheep ranch, and to think that I ought to go\r\nout there and see it. I do not understand it at all. What do you make of\r\nit, son?"\r\n\r\nDonald thought carefully.\r\n\r\n"Do you suppose anything is wrong on the ranch?"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed! Thornton wrote particularly that everything was all right.\r\nHe was Johnson\'s assistant, and he ought to know. Besides, he has been\r\nwith us a long time, and is thoroughly familiar with every part of the\r\nwork."\r\n\r\n"Maybe it\'s a joke," ventured Donald.\r\n\r\n"It would be a stupid sort of joke to get me from Boston to Idaho on a\r\nwild-goose chase. No, there is no joke about this," went on Mr. Clark,\r\nrising and pacing the floor. "Sandy McCulloch is real, and he has some\r\nreal reason for wanting me to go to Crescent Ranch. I think I shall take\r\nhis advice and go."\r\n\r\nDonald was astounded. His father never left home.\r\n\r\n"And the office?"\r\n\r\n"Uncle Harold will have to do double duty while I am gone."\r\n\r\n"And--and--I?" inquired the boy hesitatingly.\r\n\r\nIdaho seemed very far away--quite at the other end of the world.\r\n\r\n"You? Oh, you\'ll have to go along too! I shall need you."\r\n\r\nDonald drew a long breath.\r\n\r\n"Let me see," continued his father, "this is the end of March, isn\'t it?\r\nYour spring term is about over. I happen to know you are well up in your\r\nwork, for I met Mr. Hurlbert, the high school principal, only yesterday.\r\nI am sure that if you fall behind by going on this trip you will study\r\nall the harder to make up the work when you get back, won\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir!" was the emphatic promise.\r\n\r\n"You see I\'ve no idea how long I shall be detained out West, therefore I\r\nhave no mind to leave you here. You might be ill. Besides, I should miss\r\nyou, Don."\r\n\r\n"I\'d much rather go with you, father."\r\n\r\nA quick light of pleasure flashed in the father\'s eyes.\r\n\r\n"Then that\'s settled," he exclaimed decisively. "Now I\'ll tell you what I\r\nmean to do. I am not going to wire Crescent Ranch that we are coming.\r\nInstead we will drop down and surprise them. It won\'t take long to see\r\nhow things are running, and even if it proves that everything is all\r\nright I shall not begrudge the trip, for I have felt for some time that\r\nI ought to go. Clark & Sons have owned that ranch for thirty years, and\r\nyet I have never been near it. It certainly is time I went."\r\n\r\n"How did it happen you never did go, father?"\r\n\r\n"Well, during your grandfather\'s life an old Scotchman managed the ranch\r\nand attended to shipping the wool. As we had nothing to do but to sell\r\nit, we did not bother much about the place, for we had perfect\r\nconfidence in Old Angus, the manager. After your grandfather died, Uncle\r\nHarold and I had all we could do to attend to the business here. It grew\r\nso rapidly that it was about as much as two young fellows like ourselves\r\ncould handle. We always meant to go out--one of us--but we never did.\r\nThen our faithful Scotchman died. We felt lost, I can tell you! He had\r\nhad all the management of Crescent for twenty years and was one of the\r\nfinest men in the world. He might have lived until now, perhaps, had he\r\nnot been caught on the range in a blizzard while struggling to get a\r\nflock of sheep out of the storm and thereby lost his life."\r\n\r\nMr. Clark paused a moment.\r\n\r\n"After him came Johnson. He has done his work well, so far as we know;\r\nbut now he is out of the running too and we shall have to get some one\r\nelse."\r\n\r\n"Whom are you going to get?"\r\n\r\n"I haven\'t the most remote idea. You see, Don, I know next to nothing\r\nabout managing a ranch. I stay here in Boston and simply sell wool. This\r\nend of the business I know thoroughly, but the other end is Greek to\r\nme."\r\n\r\nDonald laughed. He was just beginning Greek.\r\n\r\n"I am glad you don\'t know about a ranch, father," he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, because you seem to know almost everything else, and it is fun to\r\nfind something you don\'t know."\r\n\r\nThere was admiration in the boy\'s words.\r\n\r\nHis father shook his head and there was a shadow of sadness in his smile\r\nas he replied:\r\n\r\n"I know very little, Donald boy. The older I grow the less I know, too.\r\nYou will feel that way when you are my age. Now here is a chance for us\r\nto learn something together. Let\'s go to Idaho and find out all we can\r\nabout sheep-raising."\r\n\r\nWithin the next few days the plans for the journey were completed.\r\n\r\nAs one article after another was purchased and packed the trip unfolded\r\ninto a most alluring pilgrimage. They must take their riding togs, for\r\nUncle Harold reminded them that they would probably be in the saddle\r\nmuch of the time; their camping kit must go also; above all they must\r\ncarry good revolvers and rifles. Donald\'s heart beat high. He and his\r\nfather had always ridden a great deal together; it was their favorite\r\nsport. Now they were to have whole days of it. And added to this\r\npleasure was the crowning glory of both a rifle and a revolver!\r\n\r\nAll this fairy-land of the future had come about through Sandy\r\nMcCulloch!\r\n\r\nWho was this wonderful Sandy? And why had he telegraphed?\r\n\r\nSandy McCulloch! The very name breathed a charm. Donald repeated it to\r\nhimself constantly. He dreamed dreams and wove adventures about this\r\nmysterious Scotchman. He knew he should like Sandy. Who could help it?\r\nHis name was enough.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the days of preparation flew by. Donald\'s spring\r\nexaminations were passed with honors--a fact which his father declared\r\nproved that he had taken his work in earnest and that he deserved an\r\nouting. Mr. Clark laughingly ventured the hope that he should be able to\r\nleave his business affairs in equally good condition.\r\n\r\n"You have set quite a pace for me, Don! I am not sure whether I can take\r\nhonors at the office or not. I have done the best I could, however, to\r\nput things into Uncle Harold\'s hands so to cause him as little trouble\r\nas possible."\r\n\r\nDonald tried not to become impatient while these arrangements were being\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nAt last dawned that clear April morning when the East was left behind\r\nand the journey to the West--that unknown land--was begun. Donald had\r\nnever been West. The vastness of the country, the newness of the scenery\r\nsurprised and delighted him. Geography had never seemed so real before.\r\nNo longer were the various states pink, green, or purple splotches on\r\nthe map; they were real living places with people, sunshine, and fresh\r\nair.\r\n\r\n"I had no idea America was so big!" he gasped to his father.\r\n\r\n"It\'s the finest country in the world, Don! Be proud and thankful that\r\nyou are an American. No other land does so much for her people. Be\r\nhumble, too. Never let a chance go by to do your part in helping the\r\ncountry that does so much for you."\r\n\r\nThey were standing in the glassed-in rear of the train, and as Mr.\r\nClark spoke he pointed to vast tracts of forest land that sped past\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid I can\'t do anything for a great country like this, father,"\r\nsaid Donald, a little quiver in his voice.\r\n\r\n"There is one thing we can all do--that is be good citizens. Every law\r\nwe have was made for the good of our people. In so far as you keep these\r\nlaws you will be aiding in building up a more perfect America. Bear your\r\nshare in that work--do not be a hindrance, Don."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll try, father," was the boy\'s grave reply.\r\n\r\nTo help in the progress of such a land as this! More than once Donald\r\nthought of his father\'s words as the train threaded its way along the\r\nbanks of mighty rivers, rolled through great woodlands, or skirted\r\ncities which throbbed with the life of mighty industries.\r\n\r\nAnd all this vast-reaching land was his country--his!\r\n\r\nOn every hand there were wonders!\r\n\r\nAs the express thundered along he poured out question after question.\r\n\r\nWhy did people go way to Idaho to raise sheep? Why didn\'t his father\r\nraise his sheep in the East? Certainly there was room enough, plenty of\r\nroom, that was much nearer than Idaho. How did sheep get into the\r\nmountains of Idaho anyway?\r\n\r\nMr. Clark ducked his head under the torrent of queries.\r\n\r\n"You will drown me with questions!" he exclaimed laughing. "Well, I\r\nshall do my best to answer you. New Mexico was the first sheep center in\r\nour country. Herds were originally brought from Spain, and these flocks\r\nworked their way up from Mexico through New Mexico and California; here\r\nthe hills supplied the coolness necessary to animals with such thick\r\ncoats, and furnished them at the same time with plentiful grass for\r\nfood. During the day the herds grazed, and at night they were driven\r\ninto corrals of cedar built by the shepherds. These sheep were mostly\r\nMerinos, a variety raised in Spain. Afterward, in 1853, a man named\r\nWilliam W. Hollister brought three hundred ewes across our continent to\r\nthe West. Think what a journey it must have been!"\r\n\r\n"Wasn\'t the railroad built?"\r\n\r\n"No. Neither were there any bridges. There were rivers to swim and\r\nmountains to climb; furthermore there was many a search for water-holes,\r\nbecause Mr. Hollister was not well enough acquainted with the country to\r\nknow where to find water for himself and the herd."\r\n\r\n"I should not think a sheep would have lived through such a journey!"\r\ncried Donald.\r\n\r\n"Many of them did, however," answered his father, "and that is how our\r\nwestern sheep-raising industry began. Now it is one of the great\r\noccupations of our land, and soon you and I are to know more about it."\r\n\r\n"And about Sandy McCulloch, too, I hope," put in the boy.\r\n\r\n"I hope so; only remember--not a word of that telegram to any one at the\r\nranch. We shall get into Glen City this noon if our train is on time and\r\nwe must trust to luck in getting to Crescent Ranch. It is fifteen miles\r\nfrom the station, up in the foot-hills of the Rockies."\r\n\r\n"The--the--you don\'t mean the Rocky Mountains!" gasped Donald, his eyes\r\nvery wide open.\r\n\r\n"Certainly. Have you forgotten your geography?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I know that a spur of the Rocky Mountains does run diagonally\r\nacross Idaho; but somehow I never thought of really being in the Rocky\r\nMountains!"\r\n\r\nMr. Clark enjoyed the outburst.\r\n\r\n"To be where there are bears and bob-cats and----"\r\n\r\n"Maybe, after all, you would rather have stayed at home and finished out\r\nyour school year."\r\n\r\n"I rather guess not!" was the lad\'s emphatic reply.\r\n\r\nSo impatient was he to see the marvels of this magic land that the last\r\nfew hours of the journey seemed unending.\r\n\r\nBut they did end.\r\n\r\nToward noon the heavy train pulled into Glen City and they bundled out\r\non to the platform. They were the only passengers, but there was a\r\ngreat deal of freight--boxes, barrels, and cases of provisions. As they\r\nstood hesitating as to what they had better do a tall, bony young fellow\r\napproached the station agent and called with a decided suggestion of the\r\nHighlander in his accent:\r\n\r\n"I dinna see those kegs of lime for Crescent Ranch, Mitchell."\r\n\r\n"They\'re here. You will find them at the end of the platform. Come, and\r\nI\'ll help you pile them on your wagon."\r\n\r\nMr. Clark turned to the Scotchman.\r\n\r\n"Are you going to Crescent Ranch?"\r\n\r\n"Aye, I be, sir."\r\n\r\n"Can you take my son and me along?"\r\n\r\nThe Scotchman studied him carefully.\r\n\r\n"Have you business at the ranch?" he asked, looking keenly into the eyes\r\nof the speaker.\r\n\r\nMr. Clark met his gaze good-naturedly.\r\n\r\n"We might possibly have," he answered. "At any rate we want to go up\r\nthere. My name is Clark and I come from Boston."\r\n\r\n"Clark, did you say, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nThe stolid stare of the Scotchman did not waver.\r\n\r\n"Mayhap you\'re the owner, sir."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I am."\r\n\r\nA gleam of something very like satisfaction passed over the tanned\r\nfeatures of the young man. Then his face settled back into its wonted\r\ncalmness.\r\n\r\n"It\'s welcome you are, sir," he said heartily. "I dinna think there\'ll\r\nbe trouble about taking you and your son to Crescent."\r\n\r\nHe wheeled and led the way to a wagon, where he piled up some sacks of\r\ngrain for his guests to sit upon. Then he lifted in their luggage and\r\nthe freight for which he had come, and gathered the lines over the backs\r\nof his horses.\r\n\r\nAs the wagon toiled up the long, low hills Mr. Clark began asking\r\nquestions about the ranch--he asked many questions concerning the\r\ncountry and the flocks. To all of these he received terse answers.\r\n\r\nPresently the Scotchman turned.\r\n\r\n"It\'s little you be knowin\' of sheepin\', sir."\r\n\r\nThe remark was made with so much simplicity that it could not have been\r\nmistaken for rudeness.\r\n\r\n"Very little."\r\n\r\n"Keep it to yourself, man," was the laconic advice the Highlander tossed\r\nover his shoulder as he transferred his attention to his horses.\r\n\r\nMr. Clark bit his lip to hide a smile.\r\n\r\n"What is your name, my lad?" he asked suddenly.\r\n\r\n"Sandy McCulloch, sir," was the quiet answer.\r\n\r\nDonald waited, listening eagerly to every turn of the conversation that\r\nfollowed, but to his astonishment neither his father nor Sandy McCulloch\r\nspoke one word regarding the mysterious telegram.\r\n\r\nIt was nightfall when the wagon that had brought them turned into a\r\nmuddy drive and stopped before a bare looking house situated in a\r\nmeadow, and surrounded by a number of vast barns and sheep-pens. Out of\r\nthis house came a broad-shouldered, bronzed man who stood on the steps,\r\nwaiting their approach. He wore trousers of sheepskin, a soiled flannel\r\nshirt, and round his neck--knotted in the back--was a red handkerchief.\r\nDonald noticed that into his belt of Mexican leather was tucked a\r\nrevolver. He stared at the strangers inquiringly.\r\n\r\nMr. Clark jumped out as soon as the wagon stopped, and extended his\r\nhand.\r\n\r\n"I do not know your name," he said pleasantly, "but mine is Clark. My\r\nson Donald and I have come from Boston to see the ranch."\r\n\r\nThe man sprang forward.\r\n\r\n"I\'m Tom Thornton, sir. What a pleasure to have a visit from you! Such\r\nan unexpected visit, too."\r\n\r\nHe slapped Mr. Clark heartily on the shoulder and took Donald\'s hand in\r\na tight grip.\r\n\r\nBut though he talked loudly, and laughed a great deal while carrying in\r\ntheir luggage, for some reason Donald felt certain that really Tom\r\nThornton was not glad to see them at all.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChapter II\r\n\r\nWHO SANDY WAS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next morning both Donald and his father were astir early.\r\n\r\nThere was nothing to keep them within the great chilly house, and\r\neverything to lure them into the sunshine. The sky was without a cloud,\r\nand into its blueness stretched distant ranges of hazy mountains at\r\nwhose feet nestled lower hills covered with faint green. Near at hand\r\npatches of meadow were toned to grayish white by grazing bands of sheep.\r\nOn the still air came the flat, metallic note of herd-bells, and the\r\nbleating of numberless unseen flocks within the pens and barns.\r\n\r\nWhat a novel scene it was!\r\n\r\nThe newcomers found their way to a sheltered corner where they could\r\nlook out before them into the vastness.\r\n\r\nIt was all so strange, so interesting!\r\n\r\nSomewhere in the ravine below they could catch the rushing music of a\r\nstream which wove itself in and out a maze of rolling hills and was lost\r\nat last in the shadows of the green valleys.\r\n\r\nAs they stood silent and drank in the beauty about them, an angry voice\r\nbroke the stillness.\r\n\r\nIt came from the interior of the barn near which they were standing.\r\n\r\n"I tell you what, Tom Thornton, I\'m with Sandy McCulloch. The sheep\r\nalways were washed after shearing in Old Angus\'s day, and in Johnson\'s\r\nas well. That is how Crescent Ranch came to have the good name it now\r\nholds. There were no scabby sheep here to infect the rest of the herd."\r\n\r\n"What\'s that to you, Jack Owen? You are here to mind the boss, ain\'t\r\nyou? What\'s the use of our working like beavers for ten days to dip the\r\nflock if we don\'t have to? Dipping is a dirty, tiresome job. You are not\r\nin for making work for yourself, are you?"\r\n\r\n"The flocks will be ruined!"\r\n\r\n"What do you care--they are not your sheep."\r\n\r\n"Well, I have been on this ranch a long time, Thornton, and I can\'t help\r\ncaring what becomes of \'em. I take the same pride in the place Sandy\r\ndoes. We have won a reputation here for doing things the way they ought\r\nto be done--for minding the laws--for having clean, healthy stock. Sandy\r\nsays he shall dip his herd, anyway."\r\n\r\n"Bother Sandy! He\'s talked to you men until he\'s got you all upset. You\r\nwould have been with me if he had kept his mouth shut. But no matter\r\nwhat he says I am running this ranch at present. I mean to run it in the\r\nfuture, too. If you\'re wise you will do as I tell you."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Clark may have something to say about the dipping."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you fret," sneered Thornton. "I sounded him last night. He\'s a\r\ntenderfoot. I don\'t believe he knows a thing about sheeping."\r\n\r\nMr. Clark drew Donald into the sun-flooded field before he spoke.\r\n\r\nThen, after a thoughtful silence he turned:\r\n\r\n"Well, Don?"\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t have that Thornton here another day, father!" broke out the\r\nboy hotly.\r\n\r\n"Slowly, son, slowly! We must be sure about Thornton before we condemn\r\nhim. He has been ten years on the ranch; more than that, we are without\r\na manager, and we have none in view. Remember \'he stumbles who runs\r\nfast.\' Take time, Don, take time."\r\n\r\nDonald flushed.\r\n\r\n"I know it is the best way, but I was so angry to hear him talking that\r\nway about you."\r\n\r\n"Loyalty is a fine trait, Don." Mr. Clark laid his hand affectionately\r\non his son\'s shoulder. "I like to see you loyal. But in this matter we\r\nmust move slowly."\r\n\r\n"What about this dipping, father? What is it?"\r\n\r\n"Something about washing the sheep. I do not clearly understand it\r\nmyself."\r\n\r\n"Shall you have it done?"\r\n\r\n"What do you say?"\r\n\r\n"Of course I do not know anything about it," Donald replied modestly,\r\n"but somehow I feel as if Sandy and the men are right."\r\n\r\n"I think so too."\r\n\r\n"Couldn\'t I ask Sandy what it is, father?"\r\n\r\n"I am thinking of asking him myself, Don, if I get a good chance."\r\n\r\nThe chance came unexpectedly, for at that very moment Sandy McCulloch\r\ncame out of one of the sheep-pens and crossed the walk to the central\r\nbarn.\r\n\r\n"What are you up to to-day, Sandy?" called Mr. Clark.\r\n\r\n"I am going to dip my flock, sir, down in the south meadow."\r\n\r\n"I am glad of that, for it will give us a chance to see it done,"\r\nobserved Mr. Clark. Then lowering his voice he asked: "Why do you dip\r\nthe sheep, Sandy?"\r\n\r\n"Are you asking because you want to know?" inquired Sandy with the\r\ndirectness which characterized everything he said.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Both Donald and I wish to learn."\r\n\r\n"Well, sir, it is this way. After the shearing is over and the fleece\r\nremoved, the coat of the sheep is light and therefore easily dried. We\r\nthen take the flocks and run them through a bath of lime and sulphur.\r\nSome shepherds prefer a coal-tar dip. Whatever the dip is made of, the\r\npurpose is the same. It is to kill the parasites on the sheep and cure\r\nany diseases of the eyes. If sheep are not dipped they get the \'scab.\'\r\nSome bit of a creature gets under their skin and burrows until it makes\r\nthe sheep sick. Often, too, the wool will peel off in great patches. One\r\nsheep will take it from another, until by and by the whole herd is\r\ninfected."\r\n\r\nMr. Clark nodded.\r\n\r\n"I never mean to let a sickly sheep go on the range," continued Sandy.\r\n"I try to flax round and find out what is the matter with him so I can\r\ncure him. We don\'t want our herd spoiling the feeding grounds and the\r\nwater-holes and giving their diseases to all the flocks that graze after\r\nthem. If we are let graze on the range the least we can do is to be\r\ndecent about it--that\'s the way I look at it."\r\n\r\n"Have our sheep always been dipped?"\r\n\r\n"Aye, sir, that they have--dipped every spring after shearing; then we\r\nclipped their feet before they started for the range. Sheep, you know,\r\nwalk on two toes, and if their feet are not trimmed they get sore from\r\ntraveling so much. I suppose nature intended sheep to climb over the\r\nrocks and wear their hoofs down that way. They have a queer foot. Did\r\nyou know that there is a little oily gland between the toes to make the\r\nhoof moist, and keep it from cracking?"\r\n\r\n"No, I guess neither Donald nor I knew that, did we, Donald? Now about\r\nthis dipping--do you thoroughly understand how it is done, Sandy?"\r\n\r\n"I do that, sir."\r\n\r\nDonald wondered why his father was so thoughtful.\r\n\r\n"How long have you been at Crescent Ranch, Sandy?" asked Mr. Clark at\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n"Ever since I was a lad of fifteen, sir."\r\n\r\n"That must be about ten years!"\r\n\r\n"Fourteen."\r\n\r\nA new thought came to Mr. Clark.\r\n\r\n"Why, then you must have known Old Angus," he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"I did, sir."\r\n\r\n"He was a fine old man, they tell me."\r\n\r\n"He was."\r\n\r\n"I never saw him--I wish I had. It was a great loss to the ranch and to\r\nall of us when he went."\r\n\r\n"It was indeed."\r\n\r\n"You must remember him well, Sandy."\r\n\r\nThrowing back his head with a gesture of pride, Sandy confronted Mr.\r\nClark.\r\n\r\n"I do, sir," he replied simply. "He was my father."\r\n\r\nMr. Clark and Donald stared.\r\n\r\n"Why didn\'t you tell me that in the first place?" cried Donald\'s father,\r\nstepping forward eagerly and seizing the hand of the young ranchman.\r\n\r\n"I thought mayhap you knew it. If not--why prate about it? It\'s on my\r\nown feet I must stand and not on my father\'s. If I am of any use you\r\nwill find it out fast enough, father or no father; if I\'m not \'twere\r\nbest you found that out as well."\r\n\r\n"Independent as your forebears, Sandy!" laughed Mr. Clark.\r\n\r\n"I be a McCulloch, sir!" was all Sandy said.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nTHE DIPPING\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a great surprise to Tom Thornton when Mr. Clark informed him that\r\nhe wanted the men to start in dipping the sheep as soon as they could\r\nget ready.\r\n\r\n"I suppose, Thornton, you have everything in readiness for the work,"\r\ncontinued the owner casually.\r\n\r\nThornton did not hesitate.\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed, sir. We can start right in to-day if you wish. It is for\r\nyou to say. But really, Mr. Clark, the flock hardly needs it. Our sheep\r\nare in prime condition."\r\n\r\n"That\'s all the more reason for keeping them so, Thornton," was the\r\nsmiling reply.\r\n\r\n"Of course that is true, sir. Very well. We will go ahead. I think I\r\nshall have time to give the orders, although I have got to be in Glen\r\nCity about ten days shipping the clip."\r\n\r\n"What?"\r\n\r\n"Shipping the wool, sir."\r\n\r\n"Oh, yes."\r\n\r\n"I can start the work before I go."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think you need bother, Thornton," remarked Mr. Clark slowly.\r\n"You go on down to Glen City and finish up your business there."\r\n\r\n"But somebody must see to the dipping if you really want it done."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll attend to it."\r\n\r\n"You!"\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\n"Why--why--nothing, sir. I beg your pardon. Only I thought you might be\r\ntoo tired after your trip."\r\n\r\n"Oh, no. I am not tired at all."\r\n\r\nThornton eyed him.\r\n\r\nEven Donald was astonished.\r\n\r\nMr. Clark did not seem to be at all disturbed by the embarrassing\r\nstillness, but went on shaving down a stick he was whittling.\r\n\r\n"I do not mean to manage the dipping myself," he explained at last. "I\r\nshall let Sandy McCulloch take charge of it."\r\n\r\n"Sandy McCulloch! Why, sir, that boy could never do it in the world! He\r\nis a good lad--well enough in his way--but not very smart. Not at all\r\nlike his father."\r\n\r\n"Well, if he has no ability I shall soon find it out. I mean to try him,\r\nanyway."\r\n\r\n"Oh, you can try him if you like, but I know the fellow better than you\r\ndo. You are foolish to turn any big work over to him. He can\'t handle\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"I intend to give him the chance."\r\n\r\nThornton\'s annoyance began to get beyond his control.\r\n\r\n"Very well. It is not my business," he snapped as he left the room.\r\n\r\nThe instant he was gone Donald, who could not keep silent another\r\nmoment, cried:\r\n\r\n"Oh, father! I am so glad you are going to let Sandy manage the\r\ndipping!"\r\n\r\n"It is an experiment, Don. Sandy is young and he may make a mess of\r\nthings--not because he does not mean well, but because he lacks\r\nexperience. He has been here a long time, to be sure, but he never has\r\ntaken any care beyond watching his own flocks."\r\n\r\n"I do not think he will fail. The men will all help him. They like him."\r\n\r\n"I can see that."\r\n\r\n"And I like him too, father."\r\n\r\n"So do I, son. I am trusting him with this work not only because I like\r\nhim but because I feel sure that the son of such a father cannot go far\r\nastray. It was a great surprise to me when I found Sandy was the son of\r\nOld Angus. You see we all thought so much of the old Scotchman that he\r\nwas Old Angus to everybody. I had almost forgotten he had another name.\r\nI don\'t think I ever heard any one call him Angus McCulloch in my life.\r\nAnd yet I remember the name now, for I can recall seeing it written out\r\non checks and letters."\r\n\r\n"It is a fine name," Donald declared.\r\n\r\n"Sandy comes of good stock. I want to help him all I can. If he has the\r\nright stuff in him perhaps we can give him a lift. I wish we might, for\r\nI feel we owe his father more than we ever can repay."\r\n\r\nIt was great news to Sandy when he learned that not only was he to dip\r\nhis own flock, but that into his hands was to be put the dipping of the\r\nentire herd.\r\n\r\n"I\'m no so sure I can manage it, Mr. Clark," he said modestly, lapsing,\r\nas he often did, into his broad Scotch. "I\'ll do the best I can though,\r\nsir."\r\n\r\n"I am sure you will."\r\n\r\nAnd Sandy did do his best!\r\n\r\nThe hot dip, with the proper proportions of lime and sulphur, was\r\nprepared, and Sandy tested its temperature by seeing if he could bear\r\nhis hand in it. Then the long cement troughs were filled. These troughs\r\nwere just wide enough so the sheep were not able to turn. Groups of\r\nsheep that had been driven from the larger enclosures to the small pens\r\nnear the dipping troughs were then hurried, one by one, to the men\r\nstanding at the head of the troughs; it was the duty of these men to\r\npush each sheep in turn down the smooth metal incline into the dip. The\r\nsheep slipped in easily. As they swam along through the steaming bath\r\nother men were posted midway and when a sheep passed they thrust the\r\nhead twice under water with their crooks so that the eyes and heads--as\r\nwell as the bodies--might be cleansed. At the far end of the troughs\r\nstill other herders helped the bedraggled creatures out onto a draining\r\nplatform where they dripped for a time and were afterward driven back\r\ninto their pens.\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t think the sheep would ever dry!" Donald remarked to Sandy\r\nas they watched the process.\r\n\r\n"Oh, they do; only it takes a couple of days--and sometimes more before\r\ntheir wool is thoroughly dry," answered the Scotchman.\r\n\r\nDonald looked on, fascinated.\r\n\r\nThe work proceeded without a hitch.\r\n\r\nThe sheep were fed into the troughs, hurried on and away, only to give\r\nplace to others. Whenever the dip cooled a fresh, hot supply was added.\r\nWithin an hour Donald counted a hundred sheep swim their way through the\r\none trough near which he chanced to be standing.\r\n\r\nSandy McCulloch was everywhere at once--now here, now there, giving\r\norders. Gladly the herders obeyed him. They all liked Sandy, not only\r\nfor his own sake but for the sake of Old Angus, his father, under whom\r\nmost of them had worked in years past.\r\n\r\n"Sandy\'s a fine lad!" Donald heard one of the herders say.\r\n\r\n"There\'s not a better on Crescent Ranch!" was the prompt reply from a\r\ngrizzled old Mexican who was ducking the heads of the herd that sped\r\npast him.\r\n\r\n"He wouldn\'t make a bad boss of the ranch," murmured another in an\r\nundertone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "HE WOULDN\'T MAKE A BAD BOSS"]\r\n\r\nSandy did not hear them. He was too intent on his work. He went about it\r\nsimply, yet with his whole soul. Day after day his cheery voice could\r\nbe heard:\r\n\r\n"Your dip is cooling, Bernardo! Warm it up a bit. Dinna you know you\'ll\r\nhave your labor for your pains unless the stuff is hot as the sheep can\r\nbear it? Hurry your flock ahead there, Jos\xc3\xa9. Think you we want to be\r\ndipping sheep the rest of the season? If those ewes have drained off\r\nenough let the dogs drive them back to the pens. They\'ll rub their sides\r\nup against the boards and cleanse the pen as well as themselves. Now\r\nbring out the new herd that came last week from Kansas City. You\'ll find\r\nthem in pens seventeen and eighteen. We kept them by themselves so they\r\nwould scatter no disease through the flock. After they are dipped they\r\ncan be put with the others."\r\n\r\nThe men took all he said good-naturedly. Sandy used no unnecessary\r\nwords, but what he did say was crisp and to the point, and the herders\r\nliked it. They liked, too, to watch his face when his lips parted and\r\nhis glistening white teeth gleamed between them. Sandy had a very\r\ncontagious smile. He worked tirelessly, and ever as he moved about among\r\nthe sheep two great Scotch collies tagged at his heels. Busy as he was\r\nhe often bent down to pat one of the shaggy heads, and was rewarded by\r\nhaving the beautiful dogs thrust their long noses into his hand or rub\r\nup against his knees. It was amusing to Donald to watch these dogs dash\r\nafter the sheep and drive them into the pens. Sometimes they leaped on\r\nthe backs of the herd and ran the entire length of the line until they\r\nreached the ones at the front. They then proceeded to bite the necks of\r\nthese leaders until they turned them in the desired direction. This\r\ndone, the collies would run back and by nipping the heels of the sheep\r\nat the rear they would compel them to follow where they wished to have\r\nthem go.\r\n\r\nDonald had never seen anything like it.\r\n\r\nDuring the time that the dipping process continued he did not lack for\r\nentertainment, you may be sure.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll soon have nothing more to do, Sandy," the boy said one night\r\nwhen he and the Scotchman were sitting in the twilight on the steps of\r\nthe big barn.\r\n\r\n"How\'s that, laddie?"\r\n\r\n"Why, the dipping will be over to-morrow, won\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Yes; but that is only the beginning of trouble. We shall then put the\r\nherd out in the wet grass a while and soften their hoofs so they can be\r\ntrimmed before the flocks start for the range. Then the bells must be\r\nput on, and the bands of sheep made up for the herders."\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by making up the herd?"\r\n\r\n"I\'ll try to tell you. Sheep, you must know, are the queerest creatures\r\nunder the blue of heaven. It ain\'t in the power of man to understand\r\nthem. Some minutes they are doing as you\'d likely think they would; the\r\nnext thing you know they are all stampeding off by themselves, and try\r\nas you will you cannot stop \'em. They dinna seem sometimes to have a bit\r\nof brains."\r\n\r\nDonald laughed.\r\n\r\n"Aye! You may well laugh, sitting here, but it\'s no so funny when they\r\ngo chasing after the leaders and jumping over the face of some cliff.\r\nThink of seeing a hundred of \'em piled up dead at your feet!"\r\n\r\n"Did such a thing as that really ever happen, Sandy?" questioned Donald\r\nincredulously.\r\n\r\n"It did so. Didn\'t bears get after a flock on one of the ranges and\r\ndidn\'t the whole lot of scared creatures start running? If they had but\r\nwaited either the dogs or the herders might have driven off the bears.\r\nBut no! Nothing would do but they must run--and run they did. One after\r\nanother they leaped over the edge of the rimrock until most of the flock\r\nwas destroyed. Folks named the place \'Pile-Up Chasm.\' It was a sorry\r\nloss to the owner."\r\n\r\n"But I don\'t see why----"\r\n\r\n"No, nor anybody else," interrupted Sandy. "That\'s the sort of thing\r\nthey do. When they are frightened they never make a sound--they just\r\nrun. If nobody heads them off they are like to run to their death; and\r\nwhen anybody does head them off it must be done carefully or the front\r\nones will wheel about and pile up on all those coming toward them. Lots\r\nof sheep are killed in this way. They trample each other to death. Why,\r\nonce a man down in Glen City was driving a big flock along when around a\r\nturn in the road came a motor-truck. The sheep got scared and the front\r\nones whisked straight about. That started others. Soon there was a grand\r\nmix-up--sheep all panic-stricken and tramping over each other. The owner\r\nlost half his herd. Now you see why we have to have leaders."\r\n\r\n"Leaders?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. That is one part of making up the herds. We must put some sheep\r\nthat are wiser than the rest in every flock that they may lead the\r\nstupid ones. I dinna ken where they\'d be if we didn\'t. We take as\r\nleaders sheep that are \'flock-wise\'--by that I mean old ewes or wethers\r\nthat have long been in the herds and know the ways. Sometimes, also, we\r\nput in a goat or two, for a goat has the wit to find water and food for\r\nhimself. Not so the sheep! Never a bit! You have to lead sheep clean up\r\nto grass and to water as well. They can never find anything for\r\nthemselves."\r\n\r\n"Do they know anything at all, Sandy?" queried Donald, laughing.\r\n\r\n"They do so. In some ways they are canny enough. They will scent a\r\nstorm, and when one is coming never a peg will they stir to graze. They\r\ngive a queer cry, too, when they find water--a cry to tell the others in\r\nthe flock; and if the water is brackish or tainted they make a different\r\nsound as if to warn the herd. Sheep are very fussy about what they\r\ndrink. It\'s a strange lot they are, sure enough!"\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t think they would know enough to follow their leaders even\r\nif they had any," remarked Donald.\r\n\r\n"Well, you see there is a sort of instinct born in \'em to tag after each\r\nother. Besides, they learn to follow by playing games. Yes, indeed,"\r\nprotested Sandy, as Donald seemed to doubt his words, "sheep are very\r\nfond of games. There are a number of different ones that they play. The\r\none they seem to like best is \'Follow the Leader.\' I don\'t know as you\r\never played it, but when I was a lad I did."\r\n\r\n"Of course I have played it. We used to do it at recess."\r\n\r\n"Well, the sheep like it as well as you, and it is a lucky thing, for it\r\nteaches them one of the very things we want them to learn. They will\r\noften start out, one old sheep at the head, and all the others will fall\r\ninto line and do just what that sheep at the front does. So they learn\r\nthe trick of keeping their eyes on a few that are wiser than they, and\r\ndoing what the knowing ones do. They seem to have no minds of their\r\nown--they just trail after their leaders. If we can get leaders that are\r\nable to see what we want done it is a great help."\r\n\r\n"I should think so!"\r\n\r\n"When we have selected our leaders we then scatter markers through each\r\nband of sheep."\r\n\r\n"And what are markers, Sandy?"\r\n\r\n"For a marker you must take a black-faced sheep--or, mayhap, one with a\r\ncrumpled horn; he must have something queer about him so you will know\r\nhim right off when he is mixed in with the flock. We put these markers\r\nat the beginning of every hundred sheep. It makes it easier to keep\r\ntrack of the herd."\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry to be so stupid, Sandy," Donald said, "but I don\'t think I\r\njust understand about the markers."\r\n\r\n"We have two thousand sheep in a band," explained the herder kindly.\r\n"Now if one of our markers is missing we reckon that a hundred sheep are\r\ngone. No one sheep ever strays off by himself, you may be sure of that.\r\nWhen sheep stray they stray in bunches. If a marker wanders off you can\r\nsafely figure that a lot of those around him have gone too. Roughly\r\nspeaking we call it a hundred."\r\n\r\n"But when you have such big bands of sheep and they are moving about I\r\nshould not think the markers would be in the same place twice,"\r\npersisted Donald, determined to fathom this puzzling problem.\r\n\r\n"You dinna ken sheep, laddie! They are as jealous to keep their rightful\r\nplace in the flock as school children are to get the first place in the\r\nline. They will fight and fight if another takes the position that\r\nbelongs to them. It is a silly idea, but an aid to the herders."\r\n\r\n"And so the leaders and these markers really help the shepherds to\r\nmanage the flock?"\r\n\r\n"Aye. But you\'re leaving out the shepherd\'s best helper."\r\n\r\nSandy\'s face suddenly softened into tenderness.\r\n\r\n"His best helper?" repeated Donald.\r\n\r\n"Aye, laddie! His dogs!"\r\n\r\nBending down the Scotchman thrust his hand into the ruff of shaggy hair\r\nabout the neck of one of the collies beside him. There was a low growl\r\nfrom the other dog, who rose and rested his pointed nose on Sandy\'s\r\nknee.\r\n\r\nThe man laughed.\r\n\r\n"Robin," he said, addressing the collie before him, "must you always\r\ntake it amiss if I have a word for Prince Charlie? You\'re no gentleman!\r\nDown, both of you!"\r\n\r\nThe collies crouched at his feet.\r\n\r\n"I never can speak to one without speaking to the other," he went on.\r\n"They are jealous as magpies."\r\n\r\n"They are the finest dogs I ever saw, Sandy."\r\n\r\n"I pride myself there are not many like them," agreed the herder. "I\r\nraised them from puppies and trained them myself. Now Colin, who also\r\ngoes with me when I go to the hills, is a good dog, but he is not my\r\nown. He belongs to the ranch. So do Victor and Hector. You never feel\r\nthe same toward them as you do with those you have brought up yourself.\r\nRobin and Prince Charlie are not to be matched in the county. But to see\r\nthem at their best you must see \'em on the range."\r\n\r\n"I wish I could!"\r\n\r\n"So it\'s to the range you\'d be going, is it? Well, well--belike when the\r\nherds are made up and we set out your father will let you go up into the\r\nhills a piece with me."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Sandy," cried the boy, "would you take me? Do you suppose father\r\nwould let me go?"\r\n\r\n"\'Twill do no harm to ask him. I must wait, though, until I see the\r\nother herders off, and until Thornton is back from Glen City. The\r\nflocks must have a few days\' rest after the dipping. Poor things! It is\r\na sorry time they have being dipped in that hot bath just after they\r\nhave lost their thick, warm coats; it makes them more chilly than ever.\r\nThen, too, they sometimes get small cuts while they are being sheared\r\nand the lime and sulphur makes the bruises smart. I am always sorry for\r\nthe beasties. Yet after all I comfort myself with thinking that it is\r\nbetter they should be wretched for a little while than to be sick for a\r\nlong while. It is like sitting in a dark room when you have the\r\nmeasles--you do not like it but you know you will be worse off if you\r\ndon\'t do it."\r\n\r\nSandy laughed and so did Donald.\r\n\r\n"Then it will be several days before you start for the range, Sandy."\r\n\r\n"Yes. I must wait for Thornton. I can\'t leave your father here alone. He\r\nmight want me."\r\n\r\n"You have been a great help to my father, Sandy."\r\n\r\n"It\'s little enough I\'ve done. I would do a good sight more if the need\r\ncame. A McCulloch would do anything in his power for Crescent Ranch or\r\nits owners."\r\n\r\n"I believe you, Sandy."\r\n\r\n"You do well to believe me, lad, for I speak the living truth!"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nSANDY GIVES DONALD A LESSON\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the next few days preparations for the range went steadily\r\nforward.\r\n\r\nMost of the herders had been so long at Crescent Ranch that they knew\r\nexactly what to do. It was an ancient story to men who had worked under\r\nOld Angus and Johnson.\r\n\r\nTo Donald, however, everything was new. From morning to night he trotted\r\nafter Sandy until one day the young Scotchman remarked with a\r\nmischievous smile:\r\n\r\n"You put me verra much in mind of one of my collies--I declare if you\r\ndon\'t!"\r\n\r\nThe boy chuckled.\r\n\r\n"It is all so different from anything I ever saw before, Sandy. I am\r\nfinding out so many things! Why, until yesterday I thought sheep were\r\njust sheep--all of them the same kind. Father mentioned Merinos, and I\r\nsupposed they were all Merinos."\r\n\r\n"Well! Well! And so you have found out that they are not all the same\r\nkind? How many kinds have you learned about, pray?"\r\n\r\nDonald took Sandy\'s banter in good part.\r\n\r\n"You needn\'t laugh, Sandy," he said. "Lots and lots of our sheep are\r\nMerinos, aren\'t they?"\r\n\r\n"Aye, laddie. Merinos are a good sheep for wool-growing. They are no so\r\nbonny--having a wrinkled skin and wool on their faces; they are small,\r\ntoo. But their coat is fine and long, and they are kindly. The American\r\nMerinos are the best range sheep we have, because they are so hardy and\r\nstay together so well. Some sheep scatter. It seems to be in their blood\r\nto wander about. Of course you can\'t take sheep like that on the range.\r\nThey would be all over the state."\r\n\r\n"I should think it would be a great bother to cut the wool from a Merino\r\nwhen he is so wrinkly," suggested Donald thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n"You show your wit--it is a bother. It takes much longer to clip them\r\nthan it does a smooth-skinned sheep. Besides, their fleece is heavy, for\r\nit contains a great deal of oil--or as we call it, yolk. But have done\r\nwith Merinos. What others did you learn about?"\r\n\r\n"One of the herders told me about the Delaine Merinos and showed me the\r\nlong parallel fibers in their wool; he also pointed out a French Merino,\r\nor--or--a----"\r\n\r\n"Rambouillet!" laughed Sandy. "I was waiting to hear you twist your\r\ntongue around that word. It took me full a week to learn to say it, and\r\neven now I never say it in a hurry. We have many a French Merino here;\r\nthey belong, though, to quite a different family from the other Merinos.\r\nYou will find them a much larger sheep, and their wool coarse fibered.\r\nThey are great eaters, these French Merinos."\r\n\r\n"Like me!" cried Donald.\r\n\r\n"Verra like you!" agreed Sandy. "But it is no so easy filling them up.\r\nWhy, they will eat a whole hillside in no time. They can beat you, too,\r\non staying out in all sorts of weather. Here in Idaho we generally have\r\nfairly mild winters, so our sheep can be out all the year round. We have\r\na few shacks down in the valley where we can shelter them if we have\r\ncold rains during the season. They feed down there along the river,\r\neating sage-brush and dried hay from fall until spring. It is often\r\nscant picking, but if it is too scant we give them grain, alfalfa hay,\r\nor sometimes pumpkins."\r\n\r\n"Why, I never dreamed they stayed out all winter!" ejaculated Donald,\r\nopening his eyes.\r\n\r\n"In a state where it is as mild as this one they can. Then in the spring\r\nwhen the shearing, dipping, and all is done, we start for the range. We\r\nnever go, though, until the sun has baked the grass a while, for if the\r\nherd crops too early the sheep pull at the new shoots that are just\r\ntaking hold in the soil and up they come--roots and all. Then in future\r\nyou will have no grass--just bare ground. Very early grass is bad for\r\nsheep, too."\r\n\r\n"What do people do where there are no ranges, Sandy?"\r\n\r\n"Their sheep are kept in great fenced-in pastures and fed from troughs\r\nor feeding racks. They have alfalfa hay, turnips, rape, kale, corn,\r\npumpkins and grain. The range sheep are the hardiest, though. Sheep were\r\nmade to climb and scramble over rocky places, and they are stronger and\r\nhealthier for doing it."\r\n\r\n"I\'d rather be a range sheep!" declared Donald.\r\n\r\n"And I!" agreed Sandy promptly. "But you\'re no through telling me about\r\nthe sorts of sheep you learned about. Didn\'t anybody tell you about the\r\nCotswolds?"\r\n\r\nDonald shook his head.\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s a sad pity. They are such big, grand fellows with their\r\nwhite faces and white legs. And dinna forget the Lincolns. You will have\r\nno trouble in knowing a Lincoln. They are the heaviest sheep we have,\r\nand their wool is long. A Lincoln is handsome as a painting; in fact I\'d\r\nfar rather have one than some of the paintings I\'ve seen. You want to\r\nget sight of one when its fleece is full! We have a scattering, too, of\r\nLeicesters and Dorset Horns, but the Dorsets are such fighters that I\r\ndinna care much for them. They will even attack the dogs."\r\n\r\n"I never heard of sheep doing that!"\r\n\r\n"Now and again they will, but not often."\r\n\r\nSandy paused and began to whistle softly to himself.\r\n\r\n"Are--are those all the kinds of sheep, Sandy?" ventured Donald at last,\r\nafter he had waited for some time and there seemed to be no prospect of\r\nSandy coming to the end of his tune.\r\n\r\n"All! Hear the lad! All! Indeed and that\'s not all! There are Cheviots\r\nfrom the English and Scotch hill country. You\'ve had a cheviot suit,\r\nmayhap. Yes? Well, that\'s where you got it. Then there is the Tunis and\r\nthe Persian. California, Nevada, and Texas raise Persians. They are a\r\nfat-tailed sheep. We never went in for them here. In England you will\r\nfind a host of other sorts of sheep that are raised on the English\r\nDowns; most of them are short-haired and are raised not so much for\r\ntheir wool as for their mutton. There are Southdowns, Hampshire Downs,\r\nSussex, Oxfords, Shropshire Downs, and the Dorset Horns. We always like\r\nsome Shropshires in our herd."\r\n\r\n"Oh, Sandy," groaned Donald with a wry smile, "I never, never can\r\nremember all these kinds."\r\n\r\n"Dinna shed tears about it, laddie. The wool will keep growing on their\r\nbacks just the same. But it\'s likely that you\'ll never again be thinking\r\nthat a sheep is just a sheep!"\r\n\r\n"Indeed I shan\'t!"\r\n\r\n"As for myself," went on Sandy, "I like all kinds; I like the smell of\r\nthem, and being with them on the range. You\'ll like the range, too, if\r\nyour father lets you go. You\'ll like the big sky, the crisp air, and the\r\npeace of it."\r\n\r\n"I hope he will let me go."\r\n\r\n"Dinna fear! We will ask him to-night or to-morrow. Thornton will be\r\nback to-morrow. Then we\'ll be getting ready the wagons and our own kit."\r\n\r\n"What wagons?"\r\n\r\n"Did you no see the canvas-topped wagons in the barn? Verra like gipsy\r\nwagons they are. We call them prairie schooners because they are the\r\nsort of wagon the first settlers crossed the country in. Ships of the\r\nDesert they were indeed! In the West we use them even now. When we go to\r\nthe range three of these wagons go along part way and carry the food,\r\nestablishing what we call central camps. From these camps provisions are\r\nbrought to us."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you come down for your food!" exclaimed Donald, aghast.\r\n\r\n"Nay, nay! Never a bit! When we are off, we\'re off! We never turn back\r\nuntil fall. Our food is sent to us on the range three times a week. A\r\ncamp-tender comes on horseback bringing supplies on a packhorse or on a\r\nlittle Mexican burro. If we are not too far up in the hills this tender\r\nfetches the food all the way; if we are, he leaves it in some spot\r\nagreed upon and we go down and get it, leaving the flocks in care of the\r\ndogs. The schooners stay near enough to the home ranch so they can go\r\nback and forth now and then and get restocked. We ourselves take a few\r\npots and pans to the range--just enough so we can cook our meals. It is\r\nlike camping out anywhere else."\r\n\r\n"I love camping!" cut in Donald.\r\n\r\n"Then you\'ll like the range for certain."\r\n\r\n"I know I shall. I hope I can go. What a lot I am learning, Sandy!\r\nPretty soon I shall know more about sheep-raising than father does!"\r\n\r\n"Dinna fret yourself about your father," was Sandy\'s dry retort. "He\r\nneeds no pity. He can take care of himself."\r\n\r\nTom Thornton, however, did not seem to agree with Sandy\'s estimate of\r\nhis employer. The moment he was back from Glen City he sought out Mr.\r\nClark who, with Donald, was sitting before the fire in the barren\r\nliving-room.\r\n\r\n"The clip is off for the East at last, Mr. Clark," he said. "It is\r\nlikely you will be following it soon yourself now that you have cast\r\nyour eye over the ranch and found it running all right. Have you come to\r\nany decision as to who you\'ll appoint as manager?"\r\n\r\nThornton glanced keenly at the ranch owner as he put his question.\r\n\r\n"I do not think I shall appoint any manager at present, Thornton,"\r\nreplied Mr. Clark slowly. "I am in no haste to return East. Donald and I\r\nare enjoying our holiday here tremendously and for a while, at least, I\r\nthink I shall stay and manage Crescent Ranch myself."\r\n\r\nThornton drew a quick breath.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that he was amazed and none too well pleased.\r\n\r\n"It is hard work, sir--especially when you are not used to it."\r\n\r\n"I am accustomed to hard work."\r\n\r\n"The men will take advantage of you, sir--if I may be so bold as to say\r\nso. They know you were not brought up to sheeping. They will impose on\r\nyou and shirk their duties."\r\n\r\n"I am not afraid, Thornton," was the calm reply. "I have had a chance to\r\ntest what they would do when they were dipping the sheep. It was as\r\nthorough a piece of work as one would wish to see done, and went\r\nsmoothly as a sled in iced ruts. I never saw better team-work. Sandy\r\ndirected things most ably."\r\n\r\n"Sandy does well enough at times," was Thornton\'s grudging answer, "but\r\nyou are depending on him too much. You may regret it later."\r\n\r\n"I doubt it."\r\n\r\nThornton turned.\r\n\r\n"Wait and see," was his curt reply.\r\n\r\nAfter he had gone out Donald rose and came to his father\'s side.\r\n\r\n"Thornton doesn\'t like Sandy, father."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid he doesn\'t, Don."\r\n\r\n"Why?"\r\n\r\n"Think of a reason."\r\n\r\n"Because Sandy is the son of Old Angus--is it that?"\r\n\r\n"Possibly," responded Mr. Clark, "and yet I think it is not wholly\r\nthat."\r\n\r\n"Because Sandy is so good?"\r\n\r\n"Perhaps."\r\n\r\n"Because we both like Sandy so much?" persisted the boy.\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t wonder."\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t see how any one could help liking Sandy! He is the best\r\nman on the place. He knows so much, and is so full of fun, father! And\r\nhe is so kind to his dogs and to the sheep! Why, I believe he loves\r\nevery sheep on Crescent Ranch."\r\n\r\n"I am sure of it."\r\n\r\nThere was a silence.\r\n\r\n"Father," burst out Donald when he could bear the silence no longer, "I\r\nbelieve Thornton wants you to appoint him manager of our ranch."\r\n\r\nMr. Clark\'s face lighted with pleasure.\r\n\r\n"I am glad to hear you call it our ranch, Don," he said. "I want you to\r\ngrow up and go to college and afterward I wish you to choose some useful\r\nwork in the world. Whatever honorable thing you elect to do I shall\r\ngladly help you to carry out. But if it happened--not that I should ever\r\nurge it--but if it happened that by and by you wanted to take part of\r\nthe care of this ranch on your shoulders it would make me very glad."\r\n\r\n"I am sure I should like to," cried Donald impulsively.\r\n\r\n"No, no," his father responded, shaking his head. "Do not give your\r\nword so thoughtlessly. It is a serious matter to choose what you will do\r\nin life. You must take a long time to think about it--years, perhaps.\r\nYou are only fourteen. There will be many an idea popping in and out of\r\nyour head between now and the time you are twenty. Just stow the thought\r\naway; take it out sometimes, turn it over, and put it back again."\r\n\r\n"I will, father."\r\n\r\n"And now, just for a moment, let us suppose you really are twenty and\r\nare helping me with the ranch. The first thing we should be doing now\r\nwould be trying to make up our minds about this new manager."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I suppose we should."\r\n\r\n"What should you say about that?"\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t appoint Thornton, father!"\r\n\r\nHis father smiled at the instant decision.\r\n\r\n"You must not be so positive in condemning Thornton, Don. We must be\r\ncareful that we are right before we turn him down. To have the care of\r\nCrescent Ranch is a responsible position. We want a faithful\r\nman--somebody we can trust when we are in the East; somebody who will\r\nrun the ranch exactly as if we were here."\r\n\r\n"Thornton wouldn\'t!"\r\n\r\n"That is what I am trying to find out," Mr. Clark said.\r\n\r\n"Have you anybody in mind, father--anybody beside Thornton?"\r\n\r\nMr. Clark fingered his watch-chain.\r\n\r\n"I am watching my men, Don. It is the little things a man does rather\r\nthan the big things that tell others what he is. Remember that. Watch\r\nthe little things."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t know you were watching anybody at all," avowed Donald. "You\r\ndid not seem to be doing much but wander round and have a good time."\r\n\r\n"I am glad of that," answered his father.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHORNTON HAS A REPRIMAND\r\n\r\n\r\nDonald had now been long enough at the ranch so that he had discovered a\r\nnumber of ways in which he could be of use. Most of his efforts, to be\r\nsure, were confined to aiding Sandy; but as Sandy had almost more work\r\nthan he could do he greatly appreciated the boy\'s help. Donald carried\r\nmeal to the feeding-troughs, fed the dogs, ran errands, and carried\r\nmessages from one pasture to another. He was not a little proud when one\r\nday Sandy bestowed on him the title of first assistant. To think of\r\nbeing the assistant of Sandy McCulloch! Donald\'s heart bounded! Of\r\ncourse he got tired. The days were long and the work was real. It was,\r\nhowever, good wholesome work in the open air--work that made his muscles\r\nache at first and then grow steadily stronger.\r\n\r\nOne evening after he had put in an unusually active day and was sitting\r\nin the lamplight with his father Sandy came to the door of the room and\r\nasked:\r\n\r\n"Might I come in and speak to you and Donald, Mr. Clark?"\r\n\r\nMr. Clark laid down his book. He always enjoyed a talk with Sandy.\r\n\r\n"Certainly," he answered. "Come up by the fire, Sandy. The chilly\r\nevenings still hang on, don\'t they?"\r\n\r\n"They do so. I\'m thinking, Mr. Clark, that now Thornton is back again it\r\nis time I started for the range. Some of the herders have gone already,\r\nas you know; the rest will be off to-morrow. I ought to be getting under\r\nway soon if I want to land my flock in high, cool pasturage before the\r\nheat comes."\r\n\r\n"Very true, Sandy. I have kept you behind because your aid in starting\r\noff the wagons and the other herders was invaluable. But, as you say,\r\nthere is no need to detain you longer. How soon could you get away?"\r\n\r\n"I could start to-morrow if I had my permit."\r\n\r\n"How is that?"\r\n\r\n"As you remember, sir, we must have permits to graze on the range. You\r\nhave paid enough money to the government to realize that."\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed. And I never grudge the money, either."\r\n\r\n"What are permits, Sandy?" put in Donald eagerly.\r\n\r\n"Well, laddie, long ago people who raised horses and sheep wandered over\r\nall the mountainsides with their herds, and fed them wherever grass was\r\nplenty. It was free land. Anybody could graze there. It was a fine thing\r\nfor a man with thousands of sheep not to have to pay a cent for their\r\nfood, wasn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Of course."\r\n\r\n"You would have thought there would have been enough for everybody to\r\nfeed their stock peaceably, wouldn\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed!"\r\n\r\n"Well now, it didn\'t work out so at all. The sheepmen and the cattlemen\r\ncame to actual war. The cattlemen declared that their herds would not\r\ngraze where the sheep had been because of some queer odor the sheep left\r\nbehind them; they argued, moreover, that sheep gnawed the grass off so\r\nclose to the roots that they destroyed the crop and left barren land.\r\nThe sheepmen, on the other hand, complained because the cattle--loving\r\nto stand in the water--waded into the water-holes and spoiled them. Each\r\nfaction tried to crowd the other off the range. Dreadful things\r\nhappened. Vaqueros, or cowboys, would dash on horseback right into the\r\nmidst of a flock and scatter the sheep in every direction. Often many of\r\nthe sheep fled into the hills and their owners never could find them\r\nagain. Or sometimes the cowboys would drive the sheep ahead of them over\r\nhigh precipices. Cattlemen, being on horseback, had a great scorn for\r\nsheep-herders, who were obliged to trail their flocks on foot. The feud\r\nbetween the two varieties of stock-raisers became worse and worse."\r\n\r\nDonald listened breathlessly.\r\n\r\n"More men took up stock-raising as time went on, and in consequence more\r\nherds were turned onto the range. Soon the results began to show. The\r\nyoung trees of the forest lands were trampled down, or nibbled and\r\ndestroyed; water-holes, which the settlers had used as their water\r\nsupply, began to be polluted; homesteaders, who had built houses and\r\nsettled in the sheep-raising districts, were driven off the range and\r\nhad no place where they could be sure of feeding their flocks. The worst\r\nevil, though, was that one band of sheep after another would feed in the\r\nsame spot. The first flock would nip off the top of the grass; the next\r\nflock had to eat it closer in order to get food enough; and when the\r\nlast flocks came they burrowed into the earth with their sharp noses and\r\ndug the grass up by the roots. Whole stretches of land that had once\r\nbeen green and beautiful were left bare so that nothing would grow on\r\nthem for years and years. Cattle do not eat the turf so close as that,\r\nand I do not wonder that the vaqueros complained, do you?"\r\n\r\n"I should think they would have!" agreed Donald heartily.\r\n\r\n"Then, too, the sheep have small, sharp hoofs, you know; these hoofs cut\r\nthrough the soil so that if many sheep travel over a place they grind\r\nthe earth to powder. Well, that is just what happened. The sheep left\r\nthe hillsides nothing but patches of brown dust. Things went on from bad\r\nto worse until our government stepped in."\r\n\r\nDonald kept his eyes intently on Sandy\'s face.\r\n\r\n"What could our government do?" he asked earnestly.\r\n\r\n"Well, it could do a good many things, and it did. First, it took about\r\n160,000,000 acres of land as National Forests. It was no longer free\r\npasture. It belonged to the United States."\r\n\r\n"I should think the herders would have been pretty cross about that!"\r\n\r\n"They were. You can see just how they felt. They made their living by\r\nraising stock, and to be deprived of pasturage angered them. At first\r\nthe government intended to stop all herds from feeding in these National\r\nReserves. They thought it was time to protect the forests that we might\r\nnot have floods, landslides, and forest fires. They called it conserving\r\nthe forests. Afterward, though, they considered that the western people\r\nmade their living by raising cattle and sheep, and they worked out a\r\nplan whereby every owner who wanted to graze on the range should pay a\r\ncertain sum to the United States Government for a permit, and should be\r\nallotted a particular pasture for his herd. The only restriction was\r\nthat if an owner was granted a permit he must promise to obey the rules\r\nof the range. It was a wise and just arrangement. Only a certain number\r\nof sheep are now allowed to graze on a given area; there is therefore\r\nplenty of grass and no need for the flocks to eat the herbage down close\r\nand destroy it. The money for the permits, in the meantime, goes to the\r\ngovernment, and enriches the United States treasury. Much of this money\r\nis spent in paying men to work on the range and better the conditions\r\nthere, so really it comes back to the people who pay it."\r\n\r\n"I understand," Donald replied quickly, when Sandy paused for breath.\r\n"It is very interesting isn\'t it, father? But I do not see how they can\r\nprevent herders who have no permits from grazing on the range."\r\n\r\n"They ought not to have to prevent them!" answered Sandy, hotly. "The\r\nherders ought to be decent enough to obey the law. If you are granted a\r\nfavor you ought to be a gentleman in accepting it. Now I\'m born of\r\ngenerations of shepherds--poor country folk they were, too; but my\r\npeople ever had a sense of honor--they were gentlemen."\r\n\r\nSandy drew himself up and threw back his head as he spoke the words.\r\n\r\n"I cannot imagine a McCulloch being anything but a gentleman, Sandy,"\r\nsaid Mr. Clark, who had been listening carefully to Sandy\'s story of the\r\nrange.\r\n\r\nSandy was pleased.\r\n\r\n"It\'s many would not think so, Mr. Clark," he replied, as he stretched\r\nout his rough, brown hands.\r\n\r\n"One can tell nothing from hands," laughed Mr. Clark. "The heart is the\r\nthing that tells the tale. A clean, honest heart makes a gentleman, and\r\nno one is a gentleman without it."\r\n\r\n"But you are not telling me how they kept the herders without permits\r\noff the range," put in Donald mischievously.\r\n\r\n"I almost forgot. The question always ruffles me. You did a bad thing to\r\nstir me up about it. I\'ll tell you. The United States had to put\r\nsoldiers on the range--think of it--soldiers to protect the government\r\nfrom its own people! And when the government was working to help those\r\nvery people, too. They called these soldiers rangers. It was their duty\r\nto patrol the dividing line of the National Reserves. Every herder who\r\npassed in must show his permit and let the ranger see that he had with\r\nhim no more sheep than he ought to have. That was fair, wasn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"Perfectly!" nodded Donald.\r\n\r\n"Alack! It is a sad thing that there are people in the world who do not\r\nlove their country well enough to obey her laws. If they are too stupid\r\nto see the laws are for their good why can\'t they trust the government?\r\nHere the government was going to give the herders better pastures and\r\nkeep their flocks from being molested in them. Wouldn\'t you think a man\r\nwith a grain of sense would see the wisdom of the plan!" Sandy\'s temper\r\nbegan to rise once more. "But no! The herders just felt the rangers who\r\nhad been stationed to carry out the laws were enemies who had taken away\r\ntheir freedom. So when the rangers did not see them they tried every way\r\nto steal into the reserves without permits. Two men would start with\r\ntheir flocks; one would take the attention of the ranger by showing his\r\npermit and while the ranger was busy with him the other man would slide\r\ninto the reserve far down the line where he was not noticed."\r\n\r\n"What a mean trick!" cried Donald. "And what if the ranger happened to\r\nsee him?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, he would gallop after him and ride into his flock, scattering it\r\nevery which way as he tried to drive the sheep out of the reserve. Often\r\nthe herder would lose hundreds of them."\r\n\r\n"Served him right!"\r\n\r\n"That\'s what I think, too," grinned Sandy. "The like are not all dead\r\nyet either--worse luck! And this brings me back to the matter of my\r\npermit, Mr. Clark. We are two permits short, sir. The new herds that\r\ncame from Kansas City are not counted into our old rating. Did you think\r\nof that? Having more sheep this year we must pay in more money. You\r\ndidn\'t happen to remember, did you, to get permits for those extra\r\nflocks?"\r\n\r\n"No, Sandy, I didn\'t; but of course Thornton has attended to it. See,\r\nhere he comes. We will ask him. Thornton," he called, as the big fellow\r\npassed the door, "what are we going to do about permits for the new\r\nherds? They are not included in the tax we now pay."\r\n\r\n"Don\'t you worry about more permits, Mr. Clark. I can save you a penny\r\non that," declared Thornton with a knowing wink. "You pay the government\r\nenough as it is. Leave it to me, sir. I\'ll see that the herds get into\r\nthe range all right, and that it costs you no more. When Sandy goes in\r\nhe can talk with the ranger. All the rangers know him and they never\r\nwill suspect him. In the meantime Owen can take the Kansas City herd and\r\nslip in further down the line. There is no danger of our being caught.\r\nMany a herder has done it and had no trouble."\r\n\r\n"There will be no sliding sheep into the reserves without permits while\r\nI own Crescent Ranch, Thornton," said Mr. Clark sternly. "We will pay\r\nwhat we owe the government or we will keep fewer sheep."\r\n\r\n"I was only trying to save you money, sir," Thornton hastened to\r\nexplain.\r\n\r\n"You took a very poor method to do it," was Mr. Clark\'s cold reply. "The\r\nmoney part of wool-growing is not your care. You are here to raise sheep\r\nin conformity to the laws of your country."\r\n\r\n"A mighty poor set of laws they are," grumbled Thornton sullenly.\r\n\r\n"You may not like them, but they are for your good nevertheless, and\r\nsince you are an American it is up to you to obey them. I keep no man in\r\nmy employ who is not--before everything else--a good citizen."\r\n\r\nThornton flushed, but made no reply.\r\n\r\nThen darting an angry glance at Sandy from beneath his shaggy brows, he\r\nleft the room.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nDONALD\'S FIRST ADVENTURE ON THE RANGE\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter Donald went to bed that night Mr. Clark and Sandy had a long talk\r\nand the next morning when Donald came to breakfast the first question\r\nhis father asked was:\r\n\r\n"How would you like to start for the range with Sandy, son, when the\r\npermits come?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, father! Will you really let me? I have wanted so much to go! I am a\r\ngood walker, you know, and I am used to camping. Besides, I should like\r\nto be with Sandy," he added shyly.\r\n\r\n"I am convinced that you could be with no better young fellow in the\r\nworld, Don, than to be with Sandy McCulloch," replied Mr. Clark warmly.\r\n"Yes, I am going to let you go. I want you to help Sandy, however, all\r\nthat you can. You must not be an idler and make extra trouble. You must\r\ntake hold and do part of the work if you go. Do not think," he added\r\nkindly, "that I consider you a lazy lad, for you are far from it. You\r\nhave been a great help on the ranch since you came. I have not been\r\nignorant of many thoughtful things that you have been doing to help. I\r\nsimply wish to remind you that on the range Sandy will have all he can\r\ndo. In the midst of your pleasure do not forget your obligation to be\r\nuseful. If you keep your eyes open you will see things that you can do,\r\njust as you have seen them here. You will have a thoroughly good time on\r\nthe range, and I am glad to have you go. A little later I may want you\r\nto come back to the ranch to help me. You will be willing to do that,\r\nwon\'t you?"\r\n\r\n"Of course, father, I\'ll come whenever you send for me!" was the instant\r\nresponse. "But what are you going to do while I am gone? Can\'t you come\r\ntoo?"\r\n\r\n"I\'m afraid not. I do not see how I can leave things here just now.\r\nProvisions must be portioned out and sent to the central camps. Then\r\nthere are many repairs to be made and I must attend to those. I wish,\r\nalso, to look over the books while I am here. You see I have plenty to\r\ndo. When I get my work done I may ride up into the hills and join you\r\nand Sandy."\r\n\r\n"I wish you would," answered Donald. Then he added thoughtfully:\r\n"Father, if I stayed and helped you, could you get away any sooner?"\r\n\r\nThe older man smiled at the boy.\r\n\r\n"That is generous of you, Donald boy. I appreciate it. No, I do not see\r\nhow you could help me by remaining. You go with Sandy and when I need\r\nyou I will send for you. In the meantime Thornton and I will get on very\r\nwell here."\r\n\r\n"Thornton! Isn\'t he going to the range with one of the new herds?"\r\n\r\n"Not at present. There is a great deal of work to be done here. I prefer\r\nto keep him to help me."\r\n\r\n"I wish you would have somebody else to help you and let Thornton take\r\nthe herd, father."\r\n\r\n"I think he is better here."\r\n\r\n"Very well. You know best," declared Donald. "Shall you really feel all\r\nright if I go with Sandy?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed. I want you to learn every phase of ranch life that you\r\ncan. Then if anything ever decided you to take up wool-growing as a\r\nbusiness you would come to it with a knowledge I never had. It would be\r\nfar more interesting on that account. If, on the other hand, you decided\r\non some other work in life you at least would have learned something of\r\none of the great industries of our country and would be a broader-minded\r\ncitizen in consequence."\r\n\r\n"I am sure I should, father. Why, ever since I have seen how big America\r\nis I am lots prouder that I am an American."\r\n\r\nHis father smiled at his enthusiasm, then added gently:\r\n\r\n"Yes, but size is not everything. It is what a country is doing, or\r\ntrying to do, to better the conditions of her people that makes her\r\ntruly great. You know some of the things that are done to make life\r\nhappy, healthful, and comfortable for those who live in our cities. Now\r\ngo out on the range. Look about you. See all that thoughtful, far-seeing\r\nmen are doing to protect our forests, hillsides, streams; see how our\r\ngovernment is entering into the life of those who live not in cities but\r\non farms and ranches. You will find our country is doing much on the\r\nrange beside merely issuing permits for us to graze there."\r\n\r\n"What sort of things?"\r\n\r\n"Sandy knows; he\'ll show you. In spite of the fact that he was born a\r\nScotchman he is as good an American as I know. He appreciates the\r\nbenefits of this wonderful land enough to desire to be a helpful,\r\nlaw-abiding citizen. He does not accept all the advantages America\r\noffers without giving something in return, you see."\r\n\r\n"Sandy is too proud to take everything for nothing, father."\r\n\r\n"He is also too honest, son. Now go and get your camping traps together.\r\nI expect by afternoon to have a telegram that will answer in place of\r\npermits until they can be mailed to us. As soon as they come you and\r\nSandy can start off; and in case they do not come to-day I can send them\r\nafter you by a mounted messenger. So I think you\'d better set out\r\nanyway. Wear your tramping shoes and carry your sleeping-bag. You better\r\nask Sandy if there is anything else he wants you to take."\r\n\r\nDonald needed no second bidding.\r\n\r\nHe was in the highest of spirits.\r\n\r\nAn hour later and he had said good-bye to his father and Thornton, and\r\nwas on his way to the range with Sandy McCulloch. At their backs a band\r\nof about two thousand sheep ambled along, the four dogs, Robin, Prince\r\nCharlie, Colin, and Hector, dashing in and out among them to keep the\r\nstragglers well in the path.\r\n\r\nThe trail Sandy was following led across the open fields and ascending\r\ngradually, made for the chain of low hills faintly outlined in the\r\nfar-away blue haze. Beyond these hills loomed more distant mountains,\r\ntheir tops capped with snow. These mountains, Sandy told Donald, were\r\nthe foot-hills of the Rockies.\r\n\r\nIt was quite evident that Sandy was now in his element. He swung along\r\nwith slow but steady gait, carrying his pack easily and swinging his\r\nstaff. His eye was alert for every movement of the flock. Now he would\r\nturn and draw some straying creature into place by putting his crook\r\naround one of its back legs. Sometimes he would motion the dogs to drive\r\nthe herd along faster.\r\n\r\nTo an eastern-bred lad who had lived all his life in a city the scene\r\nwas wonderfully novel. The great blue stretch of sky seemed endless. How\r\nstill the country was! Had it not been for the muffled tramp of hoofs,\r\nthe low bleating of the herd, the flat-toned note of the sheep-bells,\r\nthere would not have been a sound. The quiet of the day cast its spell\r\neverywhere. Sandy, who was usually chary enough of his words, preserved\r\neven a stricter silence. Although his lips were parted with a contented\r\nsmile, only once did he venture to break the quiet and that was when he\r\nsoftly hummed a bar or two of "There Were Hundred Pipers"--a favorite\r\nsong of his.\r\n\r\nAt last Donald, who was bubbling over with questions, could bear it no\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\n"Are you always so quiet, Sandy, when you go to the range?" he asked.\r\n\r\nThe Scotchman roused himself.\r\n\r\n"Why, laddie, I was almost forgetting you were here! Aye, being with a\r\nflock is a quiet life. You have nobody to talk to on the range--nobody\r\nexcept the dogs; so you fall into the way of thinking a heap and saying\r\nbut little. I like it. Some herders, though, find it a hard sort of\r\nexistence. Many a man has sat alone day after day on the range, watching\r\nthe sheep work their way in and out of the flock until in his sleep he\r\ncould picture that sea of gray and white moving, moving, moving! It was\r\nalways before him, sleeping or waking. It is a bad thing for a shepherd\r\nto get into that state of mind. We call it getting locoed."\r\n\r\n"What does that mean?"\r\n\r\n"You must know that on the hills grows a weed called loco-weed.\r\nSometimes the sheep find and eat it, and it makes them dull and\r\nstupid--you know how you feel when you take gas to have your teeth\r\npulled. Yes? Well, it\'s like that. We never let the herd get it if we\r\ncan help it, and if they do we drive them away from it. They will go\r\nright back again, too, and eat more if you do not watch them. That\'s\r\nwhat loco-weed is."\r\n\r\n"And the shepherds?"\r\n\r\n"When a man gets dull and stupid by being alone so much, and sees sheep\r\nall the time--even when his eyes are shut--the best thing he can do is\r\nto leave the range. Some folks can stand being alone, others can\'t. Why,\r\nI have known of herders being alone until they actually wouldn\'t\r\ntalk--they couldn\'t. They didn\'t want to speak or be spoken to and were\r\nready to shoot any one who came upon them on the range and disturbed\r\nthem. Once I knew of a herder leaving a ranch because the boss said\r\ngood-morning to him. He complained that things were getting too\r\nsociable."\r\n\r\n"I should think the herders would like to see people when they are alone\r\nso much."\r\n\r\n"Aye. Wouldn\'t you! But no. In Wyoming there is a law that no herder\r\nshall be sent out alone to tend flocks; men must go in pairs. More than\r\nthat they must have little traveling libraries of a few books. The\r\nreason for that is to prevent them from sitting with their eyes fixed\r\nvacantly on the moving sheep all the time. It is a good law. Some time,\r\nlikely, they will have it in all the states."\r\n\r\n"I mean to tell father about it. We could do that at our ranch easily,"\r\nsaid Donald. "Do you get lonely on the range, Sandy?"\r\n\r\n"Nay, nay, laddie. It is many a year that I have been alone on the\r\nhills. I love it. There is always plenty to do. Sometimes I play tunes\r\non my harmonica. Again I\'ll spend weeks carving flowers and figures on a\r\nstaff. Then I have my dogs, and they are rare company. I sleep a good\r\npart of the day, you know, and watch the flock at night."\r\n\r\n"But I should think you would sleep at night."\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t do that."\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\n"Because there is more danger to the sheep at night. It is then that the\r\nwild creatures steal down and attack the herds."\r\n\r\n"Wild creatures?"\r\n\r\n"Bears, bob-cats, cougars, and coyotes."\r\n\r\n"On the range!" cried Donald.\r\n\r\n"Where else?"\r\n\r\n"But I never thought of such animals being on the range!" murmured the\r\nboy.\r\n\r\nSandy flashed him a smile.\r\n\r\n"You\'re no in a city park here, laddie," he observed emphatically.\r\n"There are all sorts of prowling creatures abroad at night. They are not\r\nafter us--never fear. It is the poor, helpless sheep they are after."\r\n\r\n"Do you suppose, Sandy, that I shall see a bear?" asked Donald, his eyes\r\nsparkling.\r\n\r\n"Verra likely. For your sake I hope you may; for the sake of the herd I\r\nhope not. I have seen many on the range and have shot not a few. Down at\r\nthe ranch I have a long chain made of bears\' claws."\r\n\r\nDonald\'s eyes opened wider and wider.\r\n\r\n"I\'d like to see a bear," cried he. "Just see him, you know--not have\r\nhim hurt the sheep."\r\n\r\n"Mayhap you\'ll get your wish."\r\n\r\nThus--now talking, now lapsing into big, silent pauses, Donald and Sandy\r\njogged on. At sundown they stopped for the night near a water-hole and\r\nhere the flock was refreshed by a draught from a clear mountain stream.\r\nThen Sandy unpacked his saucepans, built a fire, and fried bacon which\r\nhe laid--smoking hot--between two slices of bread. Was ever a meal so\r\ndelicious, Donald wondered! Supper finished, the little portable tent\r\nwas set up, more wood heaped on the fire, and the camp pitched for the\r\nnight. Donald was tired out. After the sheep were bedded down around\r\nthem, he crept only too gladly into his sleeping-bag and was soon\r\noblivious of the range, the herd, and even Sandy himself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen he awoke it was with a sense of being cramped within a small space.\r\nHe opened his eyes. It took him a few moments to collect his wits and\r\nremember where he was. Ah, yes! Here was the little low tent over his\r\nhead, and just outside blinked the embers of the fire where he and Sandy\r\nhad cooked their supper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THEY STOPPED FOR THE NIGHT]\r\n\r\nHe sat up softly and peered out into the night.\r\n\r\nThe country was flooded with moonlight in the brilliancy of which the\r\nridges of the far-off hills stood out clearly; even the pool in the\r\nmidst of the pasture caught the radiance and gleamed like a mirror. But\r\namid all the beauty a subtle feeling of solitude oppressed him. It\r\nseemed as if he was the only being in the whole world.\r\n\r\nFurther out he leaned.\r\n\r\nThen he started suddenly.\r\n\r\nAll that great sea of human creatures that had surrounded him when he\r\nwent to sleep had vanished!\r\n\r\nNot a sheep was to be seen.\r\n\r\nThoroughly alarmed, he turned.\r\n\r\n"Sandy!" he called. "Sandy!"\r\n\r\nThere was no reply.\r\n\r\nWith growing apprehension he thrust out his hand in the direction where\r\nthe herder had been lying.\r\n\r\nThe chill of the cold earth met his touch.\r\n\r\nTerrified he sprang to his feet and bent down in the darkness.\r\n\r\nThere was no one with him in the tent! Sandy and the herd were gone!\r\n\r\nFor a while Donald stood very still. He was really alone, then--alone,\r\nmiles from the home ranch, and not knowing the way back again! This was\r\nhis first thought. The next was of Sandy.\r\n\r\nAll that Thornton had hinted flashed into his mind. Sandy was not to be\r\ntrusted, Thornton had told his father. If they placed any dependence on\r\nthe young Scotchman they would some time regret it.\r\n\r\nHad Sandy deceived him?\r\n\r\nWhat possible object could he have, Donald asked himself, in so quietly\r\ndeparting with the sheep and leaving him behind?\r\n\r\nAt least he had left the tent.\r\n\r\nHad he taken the food and rifles with him?\r\n\r\nWith beating heart Donald scrambled for his match-box and made a light.\r\n\r\nNo, there was the knapsack of provisions, the saucepan, the coffee-pot!\r\nIn the corner, too, stood his own rifle. But Sandy\'s rifle was missing.\r\n\r\nDonald reflected a moment.\r\n\r\nSandy must be coming back. Ah, that was it! But where had he gone? Why\r\nshould he rise up in the middle of the night, take the flock and dogs,\r\nand steal off in this noiseless fashion? The boy could not solve the\r\nenigma.\r\n\r\nFor the present, at least, there was nothing to be done. He glanced at\r\nhis watch. It was three o\'clock. He turned into his sleeping-bag again,\r\nhaving first taken the precaution to put his rifle within easy reach.\r\nYet try as he would he could not sleep. His eyes stared, broad awake, at\r\nthe shadowy dome of the tent. He wished it was day.\r\n\r\nAs he lay there straining his ears for the cadence of approaching\r\nherd-bells he was conscious of a muffled sound--a dull, soft footfall,\r\nas if some one was loitering stealthily about the tent. He heard it\r\nagain. Then he could distinctly hear a sniffing at the corner of the\r\ntent near which the provisions lay.\r\n\r\nDonald\'s heart leaped to his throat.\r\n\r\nHe could feel the blood pounding under his ears.\r\n\r\nWho was coming so near with that velvety tread?\r\n\r\nNoiselessly he wriggled out of his sleeping-bag and stood behind the\r\nflap of the tent, rifle in hand. Then he heard the unmistakable panting\r\nof some heavy creature--some creature so close to him that he could\r\ndetect the rhythm of every breath it drew. Shaking in every limb he\r\nstole a look outside. Just beside the opening of his shelter he could\r\nsee, clearly defined in the moonlight, a thick, dark shadow outlined on\r\nthe grass. It was cast by some beast that was halting near the doorway.\r\n\r\nIn another second it would be upon him.\r\n\r\nThe boy caught his breath.\r\n\r\nThere was no time to think.\r\n\r\nRaising his rifle, he fired at the great dark mass. Again he fired!\r\n\r\nHad he struck the mark?\r\n\r\nAnother instant would tell.\r\n\r\nThe creature would either roll over wounded, or would spring upon him.\r\n\r\nHe jammed back the trigger of his rifle. The tremor that had swept over\r\nhim at first now left his hand. His arm was perfectly steady, his blood\r\nswinging in quick throbs through his body. He fired a third time.\r\n\r\nThere was a heavy thud, the rolling of a black mass on the ground, a\r\ngasp, a growl! Then all was quiet.\r\n\r\nStill Donald dared not take any chances. He poured another round of shot\r\ninto his victim. It did not move.\r\n\r\nThen cautiously he crept outside, his rifle tight in his grasp.\r\n\r\nThere on the ground a shaggy object lay motionless.\r\n\r\nHe went nearer.\r\n\r\nThen he gave a shout of astonishment.\r\n\r\nIt was a bear!\r\n\r\nHe had shot a bear--he, Donald Clark, alone and unaided, had really shot\r\na bear! What a story to tell his father; and Sandy, too; and the fellows\r\nat home!\r\n\r\nThen, for the first time, he was conscious of a trembling in his arms.\r\nHis knees felt strangely weak. Now that the excitement was over he\r\nrealized that he wanted to sit down. His rifle slipped from his fingers\r\nand he dropped to the turf. There he rested in a dazed sort of way and\r\nreviewed the tragedy. Suppose he had not been awake? Suppose the bear\r\nhad come into the tent while he lay there asleep and unarmed? In his\r\nheart he felt very grateful for his escape.\r\n\r\nThen there followed a disquieting thought--suppose there were other\r\nbears! He had often read of their coming in groups of fives and sixes.\r\nIt was no time for him to sit limply on the ground. He caught up his\r\nrifle and recharged its empty chambers. Then before the tent door he sat\r\nuntil sunrise, anxiously scanning the dim pasture-land and the distant\r\nrocky fastnesses. It seemed as if the day would never come.\r\n\r\nPresently across the intervale he caught the faint tinkle of herd-bells.\r\nOver the brim of rolling green just ahead of him came the flock, Sandy\r\nleading them, and the collies nipping at their heels. The herder strode\r\nrapidly forward, waving his sombrero as he came. Donald ran to meet\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"Are you safe and sound, laddie?" called Sandy when he got within\r\nshouting distance. "I have had a thousand minds about you--whether I\r\nought not to have waked you, tired as you were, and taken you with me;\r\nor whether it was better to let you sleep. You see when the full moon\r\nrose the sheep set out grazing. It\'s a trick they have. Many a time they\r\nhave done it; when they once set out no power on earth will stop them.\r\nSo the dogs and I had to go along too. I reckoned you would sleep until\r\nwe got back. The herd went farther, though, than I thought they would. I\r\nhad great trouble rounding them up."\r\n\r\nAs he talked they neared the camp where Sandy\'s keen eye took in at a\r\nglance every detail of the scene before him. Then he looked sharply at\r\nDonald. Under the thick tan the boy could see him pale. His lips became\r\nlivid.\r\n\r\n"Donald, lad, you are not hurt?" he cried, motioning to the bear that\r\nlay stretched on the grass.\r\n\r\n"No, Sandy, not a bit. Truly I\'m not. See! Isn\'t he a big one?"\r\n\r\n"He is many a size too big for a boy like you to be fighting alone. I\r\nwas a blind idiot to leave you behind me. Thank the good Lord you got\r\noff without a scratch. When I think of what might have come to you----!\r\nThe next time I\'ll no go grazing without you, Don. But who would have\r\nthought of a bear venturing into these lowlands! He must have been very\r\nhungry."\r\n\r\nLater Donald had to relate every part of his adventure, and they skinned\r\nthe black bear and spread his hide out in the sun.\r\n\r\n"His coat is thicker than that of most bears at this season of the year.\r\nIt will make a bonny rug for your father\'s office, Don. When the\r\ncamp-tender comes we will send it back by him to the home ranch.\r\nThornton can get it cured for you at Glen City and it will be a sightly\r\npresent for your father. You are a son worth having!"\r\n\r\n"I want to be, Sandy."\r\n\r\n"Dinna bother your head. I\'ve seen full a dozen lads worse than you!"\r\nwas the grim reply.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nA NARROW ESCAPE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was not long before Donald felt almost as at home in the hill country\r\nas did Sandy himself. They pitched camp and stayed in one place until\r\nthe grazing began to get scarce; then they "pulled up" and tramped on.\r\nSandy knew the region well and was therefore seldom at a loss to find\r\nwater-holes. During the night they watched the flock, and as soon as the\r\nherd had fed in the morning and was ready to come to rest they left the\r\ndogs on guard and slept. Donald usually slept soundly, for the fresh air\r\nand exercise kept him in perfect health. Sandy, on the other hand,\r\nslept with one eye open--or one ear open--the boy could never quite\r\ndecide which it was. But the result was the same; by some mysterious\r\nmeans Sandy was always conscious of every move of his flock.\r\n\r\nDonald never tired of watching the young Scotchman. What a picture he\r\nwas in his flannel blouse, open at the throat; his baggy trousers and\r\nsheepskin belt; his sombrero with its band of Mexican leather; and the\r\nfield-glasses slung over his shoulder! From these glasses, his rifle,\r\nand his crook he was seldom parted. His great knuckles, broad from the\r\ngrasp of his staff, were like iron; and his lithe, wiry body was never\r\nweary. And yet with all his strength Sandy was the gentlest of men with\r\nhis sheep.\r\n\r\nTo his dogs he was a god! Still, with all their devotion, the collies\r\nevidently understood that the sheep were their first care and they never\r\ndeserted their watch to accompany Sandy when he went on a hunt for\r\nwater-holes or more abundant feeding grounds. They were wonderfully\r\nintelligent animals--these collies. Donald constantly marveled at their\r\ncleverness. They were quick in singling out the slow or wayward sheep\r\nand would bite their heels to hurry them along. They also recognized the\r\nleaders and it was to them that they communicated the directions Sandy\r\ngave them. Yet Sandy seldom spoke to his dogs. A motion of his arm and\r\nthey would spring forward and follow out his wish. Only when he\r\ncommanded it did they bark. With their drooping, bushy tails and sharp\r\nnoses they reminded Donald far more of wolves than dogs. Sandy was kind\r\nto all of them, but it was Robin and Prince Charlie of which he was most\r\nfond. They had been bred from dogs his father had brought from the Old\r\nCountry, he explained to Donald. There were few persons in the world for\r\nwhom he cared so much. Once when Robin had been lost on the range the\r\nherder had traveled the hills three whole days to find him.\r\n\r\n"What makes shepherd dogs so different from other dogs, Sandy?" asked\r\nDonald one day.\r\n\r\n"Some of it is in their blood. They seem to want to herd sheep--they\r\ncan\'t help it. Then some of the credit of a fine sheep dog is due to\r\nhis training. Why, I was months working over Robin and the Prince. I had\r\nthem with goats and sheep from the time they were born. As soon as they\r\nwere big enough I began teaching them to come when I called \'em. A good\r\ndog has got to learn to come to you when you speak. If he has done wrong\r\nhe has got to come and be punished. Some dogs will run away when they\r\nsee that you have caught them doing the wrong thing. You cannot let a\r\nsheep dog do that."\r\n\r\n"But how do you train them so they won\'t?"\r\n\r\n"I will tell you. It seems a heartless sort of way, but I had to do it.\r\nI tied them with a long piece of rope; then I called them. As soon as\r\nthey came I spanked them good and hard, and afterward I\'d pat them and\r\ngive them a scrap of meat. They understood in time. They would come\r\nanyway--sure thing. If I whacked \'em it was all the same to them. By and\r\nby when they got so they would mind, I didn\'t have to whack \'em, and now\r\nit is seldom I lay hand to \'em. It was no pleasure to me, I can tell\r\nyou, and I quit it just as soon as I felt sure they would walk up like\r\ngentlemen whenever I spoke, no matter if they knew beforehand that they\r\nwere to be whipped. You can see why this had to be, Don. Of course you\r\nknow such dogs have the nature of wolves. In fact the better the\r\nshepherd dog, the more like a wolf he is. Now a wolf is a born enemy of\r\nsheep. Sometimes the wolf in a shepherd dog will get the better of him\r\nand he will turn about and kill the lambs instead of guarding them. If a\r\nsheep-dog is once a killer he has to die. You can never be sure of him\r\nagain. So you cannot turn a dog loose on the range unless he will come\r\nto you when you speak."\r\n\r\n"I suppose he might start killing sheep and you would not be able to get\r\ncontrol of him," ventured Donald, much interested.\r\n\r\n"That is just it! He must come even if he knows he is to be shot the\r\nnext minute. There is no safety for the sheep unless it is so. My dogs\r\nwould come to me willy-nilly."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it wonderful?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, unless you have been months and months, as I was, getting them to\r\ndo it; and even then it is rather wonderful. But a thing quite as\r\nwonderful as that is that they know every sheep in the flock. Let a ewe\r\nfrom another fold come in and they will scent her quick as lightning.\r\nAnd there is something else they will do: they understand well as\r\nourselves that sheep will walk right over ledges and into pits, one\r\nafter another; so the collies will stand guard at the edges of such\r\nplaces and warn \'em off. What is that but human, I ask you?"\r\n\r\nDonald nodded.\r\n\r\n"The men down at Crescent say," went on Sandy smiling broadly, "that I\r\nam daffy about dogs--my own dogs most of all. Well, haven\'t I cause?\r\nThere is not a shepherd in this part of the country but would swap his\r\ncollies for mine; or they\'d buy them. I\'ve been offered many a dollar\r\nfor the two. But I\'m no swapping my dogs, nor selling them, either!\r\nSometimes, you know, we fat up sheep for the market and sell them as\r\nmuttons. We then have to get the sheep into cars to send them off and it\r\nis no so easy if they haven\'t the mind to go. Well, you should see\r\nRobin and the Prince at the job. They will run right along the backs of\r\nthe herd, biting the necks of the leaders until they get them aimed\r\nwhere they want \'em to go; then they\'ll nip the heels of the others till\r\nthey march up the planks into the cars neat as a line of soldiers. Or\r\nthey will drive a flock onto a boat the same way. It is a great thing to\r\nget dogs that can do that. It takes more wit than a man has. Once a\r\nsheep-raiser from California saw Robin down at Glen City getting a lot\r\nof sheep off to Chicago on the train and he was hot for having him. He\r\noffered me into the hundreds if I would let him take the collie back\r\nwith him."\r\n\r\n"And you wouldn\'t sell?"\r\n\r\n"The money ain\'t coined would tempt me to part with either of my dogs!"\r\nSandy replied, with a contented shake of his head.\r\n\r\nHe did not speak again, but lapsed into a thoughtful silence.\r\n\r\nThere were many of these long silences during those days on the hills\r\nand to his surprise Donald had come to enjoy them. At first he had\r\nlooked forward eagerly to the coming of the camp-tender, who made his\r\nrounds three times a week. Not only did this Mexican bring fresh-baked\r\nbread, cold meat, and condensed milk to add to the campers\' stock of\r\nsalt pork, lentils, and coffee, but he brought messages from the outside\r\nworld; gossip from the other herders; and now and then a letter from\r\nDonald\'s father. These visits were as exciting as to meet an ocean liner\r\nat sea. Gradually, however, Donald looked forward less and less to\r\nseeing the tiny Mexican burros with their loaded paniers wend their way\r\nup the hillsides. He grew into the shepherd life until like Sandy he\r\nfound himself courting the sense of isolation and almost resenting the\r\nintrusion of the camp-tender.\r\n\r\nHe could now understand why the herders who had lived on the range for\r\nyears were such a silent lot of men. When his father and he had first\r\narrived at Crescent Ranch the shepherds had had so little to say that\r\nDonald, who was a sensitive lad, had felt sure that the men did not like\r\nto have them come. Later, however, he had found the herders kindly\r\ndespite their taciturn manner. It was not ill-will but habitual silence.\r\n\r\n"What a lot of things people say that they don\'t need to, Sandy," he\r\nobserved to the Scotchman one day.\r\n\r\nSandy chuckled outright.\r\n\r\n"So you have come to that way of thinking, have you? We\'ll make a\r\nshepherd of you yet! Well, well, it is true enough. Folks chatter and\r\nchatter and what does it amount to? Many\'s the time they wish afterward\r\nthey had held their tongues. But it is all as we\'re made. Some drop into\r\nbeing contented on the range; others cannot bear the stillness. I was\r\never happy alone in the open; but my brother Douglas was uneasy as a\r\ncolt."\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t know you had a brother, Sandy!" exclaimed Donald, in surprise.\r\n\r\n"Aye, a little lad, five years younger than myself."\r\n\r\n"What--what became of him, Sandy?"\r\n\r\n"What became of him--that\'s a question that I wish I could answer! He\r\ncame to Crescent Ranch years ago with my father and me and was about\r\nthe place for a long time. But he was all for the city. He hated the\r\nquiet of the hills. He wanted to be seeing people and to be around in\r\nthe rush of things, and he begged my father to let him go to some big\r\nplace and find a job. My father was ever a strict man and he would have\r\nnone of the youngster\'s going off by himself. There came a day, though,\r\nwhen the lad was so sore and unhappy that my father bid him set off for\r\nthe East. There was no other way to satisfy the boy. But it was a sad\r\ntime for my father--and for me, too."\r\n\r\n"Where did he go?"\r\n\r\n"To some city on the coast, I dinna just know where. We were ever\r\nthinking he would come back some day--but he never did. It is years now\r\nsince I have had tidings from him. But sometimes when I am here by\r\nmyself I cannot but wonder where he is and what has become of him. He\'d\r\nbe a man near twenty-five now."\r\n\r\n"Does my father know this?"\r\n\r\n"Likely not."\r\n\r\n"May I tell him?"\r\n\r\n"Aye, to be sure. No boy should have secrets from his father."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t see why a boy should want to," declared Donald. "Why, my father\r\nand I are--well, we are the greatest friends in the world! I like to be\r\nwith him better than any one else."\r\n\r\n"So I figure. He must be thinking now and again that he\'d like a sight\r\nof you at Crescent instead of seeing Thornton every day."\r\n\r\n"What sort of a man is Thornton, Sandy?"\r\n\r\n"What sort of a man do you take him to be?"\r\n\r\n"I do not like him!" was the prompt reply.\r\n\r\n"And wherefore?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, I--don\'t--know."\r\n\r\n"A poor reason. Dinna say that about any man until you get a better\r\none."\r\n\r\nDonald colored.\r\n\r\nSandy had dropped many a curt word that had brought the boy up,\r\nstanding. Whatever else the young herder was he was just. Not only did\r\nDonald\'s liking, but his respect for him, increase.\r\n\r\nAh, what happy days they passed together! Donald became so attached to\r\nthe various camps that he hated to leave them. Sometimes he and Sandy\r\nwould stay in a spot a week, sometimes ten days; then onward and upward\r\nover the great plateaus of the mountains they made their way. These flat\r\nreaches of pasture-land were like huge steps. It was hard to realize\r\nthat they were constantly climbing. Yet up, up, up they went! Each camp\r\nwas several hundred feet higher than the last. As they went on the\r\npasturage became richer, the air cooler. Clear streams from melting,\r\nsnowy summits rushed along, leaving pathways of music behind them. With\r\na hawk\'s keenness Sandy chose the most fertile stretches of grass for\r\nthe flock.\r\n\r\n"The weight of the clip depends on good grazing," he explained to\r\nDonald.\r\n\r\n"The clip?"\r\n\r\n"Aye, the wool. Wool is sold by the pound, you must know. The better the\r\nfeed, the thicker the wool. We must look out, though, for poisoned\r\nmeadows. There do be many in this region."\r\n\r\n"Poisoned meadows!"\r\n\r\n"Fields where poison herbage grows. Hundreds of sheep lose their lives\r\ndevouring poisonous weeds. Keep your eye out for signs, laddie."\r\n\r\n"Signs! Signs up here!"\r\n\r\n"Where else? That is one of the many things our United States government\r\ndoes for us. It posts notices of poisoned meadows to warn the grazers on\r\nthe range."\r\n\r\n"That is a pretty nice thing to do!" Donald said.\r\n\r\n"Sure enough it is," agreed Sandy. "Some day the survey will have all\r\nthe water-holes catalogued along with the poisoned herbage, and will\r\nthen be able to direct herders to the best grazing grounds. That is what\r\nthe government is busy trying to do now."\r\n\r\n"And yet sheep-owners kick at paying for permits," exclaimed Donald.\r\n"Why, lots of that permit money must come back in this way to the very\r\nmen who pay it."\r\n\r\n"For certain! And mind what I\'m telling you--you will see more things\r\nthat the government is doing for the herders when you get higher up. You\r\nwill see great pastures fenced in with coyote-proof wire--pastures to be\r\nused in lambing time so the young creatures will be safe from\r\nprairie-dogs."\r\n\r\n"Do you have coyotes on the range?"\r\n\r\n"Do we? Do we? Folks would know you for a tenderfoot right off if they\r\nheard you ask that question! The coyote, I\'d have you know, is the pest\r\nof the sheepman. He\'s the meanest critter--but there, why be talking?\r\nYou\'ll see for yourself soon enough. The government has spent thousands\r\nof dollars killing coyotes on these ranges."\r\n\r\n"To help the sheep-raisers?"\r\n\r\n"So."\r\n\r\n"Well, I don\'t wonder my father wanted Crescent Ranch to pay its full\r\nshare for permits. Since we are getting all these advantages, we ought\r\nto bear our part of the expense, oughtn\'t we?" said Donald.\r\n\r\n"That\'s my feeling. We ought to be proud, too, we are bearing it. It\'s a\r\ngrand country! I wasn\'t born here, like you, but I came here as a child,\r\nand the bones of my people are here. I mean to live in America and take\r\nwhat it offers, and wouldn\'t I be the churl not to give the little I\r\ncan in return! I haven\'t money, but I can live up to the laws. Scotchman\r\nthough I be \'twill no hinder me from making a good American of myself."\r\n\r\n"Bully for you, Sandy!" cried Donald. Then he added soberly: "I am going\r\nto be a better American when I get back home."\r\n\r\n"Dinna wait till then, laddie--be a better one now!"\r\n\r\nSandy chanced to be deftly cutting the outline of a thistle on a spruce\r\nstaff he was carving for the boy. Donald watched him in silence as he\r\nworked in the fading light. The sun had set behind the chain of near\r\nhills, and the plateau where they were camping was gray with shadows.\r\nThrough the dusk they could see the flock lazily browsing among the\r\njunipers.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was a cry from Sandy.\r\n\r\nHe threw down the staff and sprang to his feet.\r\n\r\n"The herd!" he shouted. "They\'re off!"\r\n\r\nSure enough! Without a cry the leaders had started for the rimrock, and\r\nin their wake--straight for the face of the precipice--was running the\r\nentire flock.\r\n\r\n"They\'re startled!" gasped Sandy. "We must head \'em off. Run for your\r\nlife! We must get between the brainless creatures and the cliff before\r\nthey go over."\r\n\r\nDonald ran. He had never run so before. His training as a track sprinter\r\nstood him in good stead now. But he had never been a long-distance\r\nrunner. Two hundred yards was his limit. Moreover he was not in\r\ntraining. But he ran--ran as he did not know he could run. He gained on\r\nthe sheep. Sandy, in the meantime, was waving his arms to the dogs who,\r\nunderstanding his slightest motion, now dashed ahead. The sheep,\r\nhowever, were far in advance by this time. On they sped in mad panic.\r\nDonald could run no more. He began to lag, his heart beating like a\r\nhammer. Even Sandy, who from the opposite direction was racing for the\r\nedge of the rock, slackened his pace.\r\n\r\nThe race was a hopeless one.\r\n\r\nThen without warning, out of the trees at the left side of the field\r\nrode a horseman at full gallop. With flying hoofs he cut in ahead of\r\nthe herd just as they neared the face of the rock.\r\n\r\nThe leaders swerved, circled, and turned about. The gait of the\r\nstampeding flock lessened. The dogs skilfully steered the approaching\r\nsheep out to one side where Sandy scattered them that they might not\r\ncollide with the ranks coming toward them. Gradually the fears of the\r\nflock became quieted. Falling into a walk they worked their way into\r\ntheir customary places and turned about, feeding as they went.\r\n\r\nImmediately when Sandy saw them safe he pressed forward to the side of\r\nthe horseman where he beckoned Donald to join him.\r\n\r\n"I spied your plight from the ridge above, Sandy McCulloch," called the\r\nrider. "The rest of the Crescent herd has gone in to the Reserve and I\r\nhave had my eye out for you for days. I thought it was about time that\r\nyou were coming along."\r\n\r\n"It\'s a good turn you\'ve done me this day, Sargeant," Donald heard Sandy\r\nsay.\r\n\r\n"You have done many a favor for me."\r\n\r\n"Dinna be talking. It is little I ever did for you. An errand or two\r\nperhaps, or carrying a message--but what is that? Any man would be glad\r\nto do the same. To-night, though, you have saved my whole herd. We\r\nshould not have had a sheep left. Here is Master Donald Clark, the son\r\nof our owner," went on Sandy, as Donald came nearer. "Let him thank you.\r\nDon, this soldier is one of the government rangers."\r\n\r\nLeaning from his saddle the horseman put out his hand.\r\n\r\n"I am proud," he said, "to meet one of the owners of Crescent Ranch. If\r\nyou are learning about the range, Master Clark, you cannot be in better\r\ncompany than to be with Sandy McCulloch. There is little about sheeping\r\nthat he doesn\'t know; nor is there a cleaner-handed herder to be found.\r\nWe never need to see his permit or count his sheep. He is no\r\nlawbreaker!"\r\n\r\n"I hope none of our men are," replied Donald, shyly.\r\n\r\n"Crescent Ranch has always had the reputation of being run on the\r\nsquare. We have no complaint to make," was the ranger\'s answer.\r\n\r\n"We--my father means that it shall be," the boy asserted modestly.\r\n\r\n"I do not doubt he does. You will have trouble, though, I fear, in\r\nfinding another manager who can match Old Angus--or even Johnson. They\r\nwere rare men who were famed throughout the county for their honesty and\r\ncommon sense."\r\n\r\n"We shall try to find some other manager as good."\r\n\r\n"May you be so fortunate. Good luck to you!"\r\n\r\nWith a wave of his hand the ranger cantered into the darkness and was\r\nsoon lost from sight.\r\n\r\n"You see, don\'t you, Don, that the rangers are not our natural born\r\nenemies after all," said Sandy, with a good-humored smile that bared his\r\nglistening teeth.\r\n\r\n"I should say not!"\r\n\r\n"They are all like that if we but live up to our part of the bargain. I\r\nnever yet met a ranger who was not friendly and kind. But you cannot\r\nhave folks for your friends if you do not meet them half-way."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nDONALD HAS A SURPRISE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was something of a disappointment when one morning a week or two\r\nlater the camp-tender, who had scrambled up over the rimrock, informed\r\nDonald that he was to return to the central camp where his father would\r\nmeet him, and take him back to Crescent.\r\n\r\n"The ponies are tethered just below, so you can ride down along with\r\nme," said the Mexican. "There is nothing the matter, only your father\r\nhas more than he can do with but Thornton and Green to help him. He\r\nneeds you for a while. He told me to tell you that in a few weeks you\r\nmight come back."\r\n\r\nDonald looked regretfully at Sandy.\r\n\r\n"I\'m sorry to go, Sandy. I promised, though, that I would return to\r\nCrescent whenever father wanted me; of course I am anxious to help him\r\nall I can. I cannot realize that it is June, and that I have been two\r\nmonths on the range. What a jolly time we have had! It seems a pity to\r\ngo and leave you here by yourself."\r\n\r\n"It would not be the first time I have been alone in the hills," smiled\r\nSandy.\r\n\r\n"He\'ll not be by himself either," put in Pete, the Mexican, "for Tobin\r\ncame up over the trail with me and is to bear Sandy company."\r\n\r\nDonald\'s face brightened.\r\n\r\n"I know you\'ll not be lonely, Sandy," he said, "but suppose anything\r\nhappened to you--what if you happened to be hurt as Johnson was?"\r\n\r\n"Aye, poor Johnson! What do they hear from him, Pete?"\r\n\r\n"Mr. Clark has been to Glen City a number of times to see him. He is\r\ngetting on finely! The ribs are mending and the hip, too. His heart is\r\nthe trouble now; he is breaking his heart for Crescent and the range.\r\nThe doctor says that he will never be able to come back to the ranch.\r\nMr. Clark is going to settle him and his wife on a farm of their own in\r\nCalifornia, where their son is."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I am very glad!" cried Donald. "Father said he should always look\r\nout for Johnson because he had been so faithful."\r\n\r\n"It is like your father to do it--and like your grandfather, too, Don.\r\nMay you be as good a man! Now get your traps together and be off with\r\nPete. It\'s many a time I\'ll be thinking of you after you are gone,\r\nladdie."\r\n\r\n"But you know I am coming back in a few weeks, Sandy."\r\n\r\n"There\'s long weeks and short weeks; it all depends on what you\'re\r\ndoing," was Sandy\'s whimsical answer. "Now be off. Why, you\'d think I\r\nwas seeing you to India instead of just down to the lowlands!"\r\n\r\nAs he dropped over the rimrock, Donald tried to laugh. It was not until\r\nhe was mounted upon the little Mexican pony that he gained courage to\r\nlook up. Outlined against the sky Sandy was standing on a point of rock,\r\nwaving his sombrero. That was the last Donald saw of him.\r\n\r\nChatting as they rode down the mountainside the boy and Pete pressed\r\nforward over the trail. At noon they dismounted and lunched on salt-pork\r\nand pilot bread. Then off they cantered again. The tiny ponies,\r\nsure-footed as mules, made their way over the steep inclines of the\r\nhilly country with astonishing daintiness, but although they maintained\r\na fair and even speed it was sunset when the white top of the prairie\r\nschooner came into sight, drawn up beside a stream and sheltered by a\r\ngroup of great trees. Several Mexican ponies were pastured near it. The\r\ncurtains at the end of the wagon were parted and fastened back and\r\ninside Donald could catch a glimpse of Manuel, the Mexican cook, busily\r\npreparing the food. A curl of faint smoke rose from the tin pipe which\r\nprotruded through the canvas, arching the top of the wagon. Then as\r\nDonald looked, into the clearing came the erect figure of his father.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PANTING PONY STOOD STILL]\r\n\r\nThe boy gave a shrill whistle on his fingers and touched the spurs to\r\nhis horse\'s flank.\r\n\r\n"Father!" he called.\r\n\r\nAnother moment and the panting pony stood still near the wagon, his\r\nsides heaving.\r\n\r\nDonald dismounted and ran to meet his father.\r\n\r\n"Well, well!" was Mr. Clark\'s first exclamation. "How is this? I sent a\r\npale-faced American boy to the range and I get an Indian in exchange!"\r\n\r\n"I suppose I am tanned," laughed Donald. "I know my hands are. As for my\r\nface--I have not seen it since I started. We don\'t have looking-glasses\r\nin the hills."\r\n\r\n"And you enjoyed your trip?"\r\n\r\n"I had the time of my life, father! It is simply bully up there. I wish\r\nyou had been along."\r\n\r\n"I am planning to go back with you in two or three weeks. It seemed a\r\npity to bring you down, but I did need you, Don. If it had only been\r\nthat I missed you I should not have sent, no matter how much I wanted to\r\nsee you."\r\n\r\n"I was glad to come, sir. How is everything at Crescent?"\r\n\r\n"Going well. We are getting in a big crop of alfalfa from the south\r\nmeadow. That is why I wanted you. You will now have to turn farmer and\r\npitch hay for a while."\r\n\r\n"All right!"\r\n\r\nAnd that was what Donald did. For the next few weeks he was busy helping\r\nhis father harvest the first crop of alfalfa grass, drying it, and\r\nstoring it away in the great sprawling barn of the home ranch for winter\r\nfeed. Days of hard work were succeeded by nights of heavy slumber. Life\r\nwas very real. The boy was doing something--something that\r\ntold--something that was of use to other persons; he had a place to\r\nfill, duties for which he was responsible. Continually he found himself\r\nspeaking of "our ranch" and suggesting to his father that "we" do such\r\nand such things.\r\n\r\nMr. Clark rubbed his hands with satisfaction. Although he and Donald had\r\nalways preserved a close comradeship no experience had ever drawn them\r\nso near together as had this common interest. It was happiness to each\r\nof them. From the time the boy tumbled out of bed in the early morning\r\nuntil he tumbled in again at dusk his whistle could be heard shrill\r\nabove the click of mowing-machines, and the tramp of horses\' hoofs.\r\n\r\nAt last came the day when the last load of alfalfa was housed under\r\ncover; then Mr. Clark said to Thornton:\r\n\r\n"Well, Thornton, there seems to be nothing more for which we shall be\r\nneeded at present. You can deal out the rations and send them to the\r\nthree central camps without me; you can also order necessary supplies\r\nfrom Glen City. Some repairs remain for you to oversee, but I am sure\r\nyou fully understand about them, and can manage them without my help.\r\nTo-morrow, therefore, if the day is fine, Donald and I will set out for\r\nthe range, I think."\r\n\r\nDonald threw his hat into the air.\r\n\r\n"To join Sandy, father?" he asked eagerly.\r\n\r\n"That is my plan."\r\n\r\n"Hurrah!"\r\n\r\nMr. Clark looked amused at his enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n"One would think you a born shepherd, Don, instead of a boy who has only\r\nbeen out on the range with a herder."\r\n\r\n"Why do you call Sandy just a herder, father?" Donald asked, seeming to\r\nfear that the term was a slight to his friend the Scotchman.\r\n\r\n"Because he is a herder, son. A shepherd is a man who herds or tends his\r\nown sheep--sheep that belong to him; a herder, on the contrary, is a man\r\nhired to care for other people\'s sheep. There is a great difference, you\r\nsee. Generally speaking, a shepherd will take more pains with a flock\r\nthan a herder will on the principle that we are more interested in our\r\nown possessions than in those which are not our own."\r\n\r\n"No one could take better care of sheep, father, than Sandy does."\r\n\r\n"I feel sure of that," agreed his father, gravely. "In fact all our\r\nherders are honest men--I am convinced of it. After the next shearing I\r\nmean to give to each man a small band of sheep for his own. He may run\r\nthem with the flocks, sell the wool, and keep the money as a nest-egg.\r\nThe men deserve a share in the profits of Crescent Ranch and I should\r\nlike them to have it in return for their splendid spirit of loyalty."\r\n\r\n"Even Thornton?"\r\n\r\nMr. Clark hesitated.\r\n\r\n"I have been watching Thornton," he admitted slowly. "That is why I kept\r\nhim with me, and why I stayed behind."\r\n\r\n"Why, I never thought of that being the reason!"\r\n\r\n"It was my chief reason."\r\n\r\n"But now you are going off and leaving Thornton alone," Donald said,\r\nsomewhat puzzled.\r\n\r\n"Yes, and I am leaving him in a position of trust, too. The supplies and\r\nmuch of our business is in his hands. He knows it. If he proves himself\r\nworthy, I shall appoint him, when we leave here, as manager in Johnson\'s\r\nplace; if he abuses the confidence I am placing in him he will force me\r\nto appoint some one else. I wish to be perfectly fair."\r\n\r\n"But I do not like Thornton," declared Donald.\r\n\r\n"We must never be guided by our prejudices, Don."\r\n\r\n"And anyway," went on the boy, "I don\'t see how you will know what he is\r\ndoing. You will be miles away in the hills. He could do almost anything\r\nhe chose. Have you left some one to watch him, father?"\r\n\r\n"No, indeed, son. That would be a mean method; don\'t you think so? To\r\nset a trap for a man, or to spy upon him would be contemptible!"\r\n\r\nDonald hung his head, ashamed of the suggestion.\r\n\r\n"No," continued Mr. Clark less severely, "I have left no one on guard\r\nover Thornton but himself. I am really trusting him."\r\n\r\n"You will never find out what he does, then."\r\n\r\n"Yes, I shall."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see how."\r\n\r\n"Thornton himself shall tell me."\r\n\r\nDonald gasped.\r\n\r\n"He never will tell you, father!" announced the boy positively.\r\n\r\n"Wait and see. Now let us think no more of Thornton, for it is of Sandy\r\nthat we are to talk. He has a great surprise for you."\r\n\r\n"A surprise for me!"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\nMr. Clark studied the lad\'s mystified expression with pleasure.\r\n\r\n"A surprise for me!" repeated Donald. "What can it be!"\r\n\r\n"You will see."\r\n\r\n"Aren\'t you going to tell me?"\r\n\r\n"No, not a word. It would spoil Sandy\'s fun."\r\n\r\n"A surprise!" reiterated Donald over and over.\r\n\r\nAs they rode from the central camp up over the rough trail Don\r\nspeculated constantly as to what could be in store for him. It seemed a\r\nlong journey for he was impatient to solve the waiting enigma. What\r\nsurprise could Sandy have concocted? At the border of the Reserve they\r\nmet the ranger who chanced to be patrolling that portion of the\r\ngovernment line. He remembered Donald very well and greeted him kindly;\r\nhe also had a cordial word for Mr. Clark. Donald, however, begrudged\r\neven this brief delay and was glad when they plunged into the woods and\r\nwere on their way through the National Forest.\r\n\r\nPete, the Mexican camp-tender who had come with them as guide, knew the\r\ncountry as an American boy knows his A\xc2\xa0B\xc2\xa0C\'s. He hunted out sheltered\r\nnooks where they could camp at night, taking great care to build the\r\nfire on a rocky base that it might not set ablaze the brush and litter\r\nof pine-needles about them.\r\n\r\n"Many a careless shepherd sets a forest fire through being thoughtless,"\r\nhe said. "Acres of timber will be burned off a hillside by one person\r\nwho did not put out his fire, or scattered sparks in the dried\r\nunderbrush. Old Angus trained us Crescent men always to build our fires\r\non a flat rock if we could; then there is no danger of our doing damage\r\nin the reserve or elsewhere."\r\n\r\n"It is a wise plan," Mr. Clark said heartily. "I wish all herders were\r\nas careful."\r\n\r\nSo they journeyed on--now in the sunlight of the plateaus, now in the\r\nshadows of the forest. Then one morning they suddenly emerged into an\r\nemerald meadow glowing with sunshine. There a beautiful sight met\r\nDonald\'s eye.\r\n\r\nSpread out like a fan the herd was grazing on the rich herbage of the\r\nmountain pasture, their backs to the brilliant light as was their wont.\r\nBut of these details Donald was not conscious. What held him spellbound\r\nwas the miracle that had happened in his absence. Now he knew the\r\nsurprise that Sandy had for him! Beside every ewe in the flock stood a\r\ntiny white lamb!\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nA SECOND ADVENTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nDonald\'s delight at being back on the range was equaled only by Sandy\'s\r\npleasure at having him there. The first thing, of course, was to display\r\nthe lambs to the boy and Mr. Clark.\r\n\r\nWith no little pride the Scotchman led the newcomers over the pasture,\r\npointing out the finest blooded creatures in the flock.\r\n\r\n"One would think, Sandy, that you were a mother hen with a brood of\r\nchicks!" laughed Donald\'s father. "Well, you have a right to be pleased\r\nwith your herd. You have a fine lot of lambs."\r\n\r\n"They are no so handsome just now, sir," Sandy chuckled. "But give them\r\ntime! A few weeks more, and a winsome sight they\'ll be."\r\n\r\n"Are--are--lambs always so long-legged?" queried Donald timidly, anxious\r\nnot to hurt Sandy\'s feelings. "These seem to have no bodies at all--just\r\nlegs."\r\n\r\n"That is their nature, lad. They have only enough body to keep their\r\nlegs alive. Young lambs are ever like that. Later they fill out. It is\r\ntheir strong legs that enable them to travel with the flock as soon as\r\nthey are three or four weeks old. But I am proud of them--legs or no\r\nlegs. Now that they are here, our next task is to bring them through\r\nalive. We have lost but a few thus far. Luckily we had several sets of\r\ntwins, so we have been able to give a lamb to every mother sheep that\r\nlost her baby. We fasten the strange lamb inside the skin of the dead\r\none, and the mother is as well pleased as if she had her own back\r\nagain."\r\n\r\n"What a funny idea!" Donald said.\r\n\r\n"Yes, isn\'t it? You see sheep recognize their young merely by scent. The\r\npower of smell is remarkably keen in all sheep. They can tell their\r\nbabies no other way. We do not want any of the ewes grieving because\r\nthey have no lamb--they do grieve, poor things--so we have to fool them\r\na little. It is a fair thing to do because the ewes with twins do not\r\nneed two. They are just as happy with one," explained Sandy.\r\n\r\n"And now you will have a big, big flock to take care of, won\'t you,\r\nSandy?"\r\n\r\n"Aye! There is much more to do now. I am glad you have come back, Don,\r\nfor I can put you to work."\r\n\r\n"You must put me to work also, Sandy," Mr. Clark observed, smiling.\r\n\r\nSandy shook his head.\r\n\r\n"Well, I reckon not. It would be a fine thing for me to be asking a\r\ngentleman like you to put your hand to anything, now wouldn\'t it!"\r\n\r\nEvidently the idea amused the herder.\r\n\r\n"Why not?" Mr. Clark asked seriously. "I am used to putting my hand to\r\nmuch hard work when I am at home. Everybody in this world works one way\r\nor another. Some of us work with our heads, some with our hands; but so\r\nlong as it is all honest, helpful work and we do it the best we can, we\r\nare all on equal footing, Sandy. Now if you were in my office in Boston\r\nI might be teaching you kinds of work that would be new to you; here you\r\ncan teach me. Try and forget everything, and just consider me a person\r\nwho is interested in sheep and wants to learn about them. Let me join\r\nDonald in helping all I can."\r\n\r\n"I\'ll take you at your word then, sir, since you urge me. I\'m no denying\r\nit will make matters simpler. There is enough to do--more than enough,\r\nand extra help will be welcome. Luigi will be going down with the\r\nponies, I suppose, sir."\r\n\r\n"Yes, he is to take them back, and stay and aid Thornton at the ranch."\r\n\r\n"Then you will have a place to fill right away, Mr. Clark. Some of the\r\nmen who have been helping have gone down already, but I have kept Tobin\r\nand a couple of the Mexicans. Still it is no so easy to protect so many\r\nlambs from the coyotes. Lambing time is their great feasting season. A\r\ncoyote is a mean creature, sir. Yet despise \'em as you may you cannot\r\nhelp admiring their cunning. There is no smarter animal alive than a\r\ncoyote!"\r\n\r\n"Tell us about them."\r\n\r\nSandy dropped down on a rock beside Mr. Clark and Donald.\r\n\r\n"A coyote, as of course you know, is a wee bit wolf, about the size of a\r\nfox, and there is no feed he enjoys so well as a young lamb. Coyotes\r\nseem to know when the lambs come and they make ready to raid the flocks.\r\nYou\'d think folks would be bright enough to catch \'em, but there ain\'t\r\nwit enough in the world to get ahead of them. They\'re the cutest! The\r\ntricks a coyote will invent, sir, pass belief. In spite of the fact this\r\npasture is fenced with coyote-proof wire the creatures manage to get\r\nin--goodness only knows how."\r\n\r\n"Have they bothered you much, Sandy?"\r\n\r\n"Have they! Haven\'t we built fires round the herd every night and\r\npatrolled the whole distance, back and forth, until light? Luigi,\r\nBernardo, Carlos, and I have been on our feet from twilight until\r\nsunrise, tramping like sentinels; yet with all our care we have lost six\r\nlambs already. Six is not many when you consider the numbers some\r\nherders lose, still it is just six too many. So you see if Luigi goes\r\ndown over the trail to-day with the ponies we can find work for you and\r\nDonald to-night."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I think it will be great fun to patrol!" cried Donald.\r\n\r\n"Think you so? Well, mayhap you will find it sport, since you haven\'t\r\nbeen doing it night after night for two weeks, lad."\r\n\r\nDonald regarded him good-naturedly.\r\n\r\n"There will be plenty of work waiting you by day, too," Sandy went on.\r\n"Just now we are busy inserting the flock mark in the ear of each\r\nlamb--a metal button with a crescent on it. The next ranch to ours is\r\nAnchor Ranch, and their herd is marked with an anchor, while down beyond\r\nlies Star Ranch. It behooves us to keep close track of our herds and\r\nmark them carefully. Then in addition to the marking we must dock the\r\ntails of the lambs lest they become foul; and we must record every lamb.\r\nWe have a book where we enter the number of the mother and opposite it\r\nthe number of her lamb. That is the way we keep track of the breeds."\r\n\r\n"Why, I had no idea you had so many things to do, Sandy," said Donald.\r\n"It is almost as bad as taking the census."\r\n\r\n"It is, and it all has to be done correctly, too. You can look up in the\r\nbooks the history of every sheep we have at Crescent Ranch. The pure\r\nbreed lambs have to be registered with the Breed Secretary, you know."\r\n\r\n"Sheep-raising seems to lead from one thing into another," reflected\r\nDonald. "In the East none of us ever think of all that the wool goes\r\nthrough before it is made into clothes for us."\r\n\r\n"It is better than any story," was Sandy\'s reply. "Herders get tired of\r\nit sometimes, but I never do. Sheeping is in my blood, I reckon. What\r\nwith herding and trailing the flock, what with bears, and bob-cats, and\r\ncougars, and coyotes--I dinna see how it would ever be dull."\r\n\r\n"That is because you love your work, Sandy," said Mr. Clark.\r\n\r\n"I do. Take me from the ranch, sir, and blindfold me even, and I verily\r\nbelieve I\'d find my way back again. Now a bit more about the coyotes. If\r\nyou are to be of help you must hear all I can tell you so that you will\r\nknow the better how to fight \'em. Sometimes they\'ll yelp like a dog and\r\ntrick you into thinking your own collies are in trouble; but do not\r\ntrust them. \'Twill be no collies but themselves that are barking. Again\r\nthey will cheat you into believing that they are far away, so gentle\r\nwill be their cry; that is to throw you off the track. Or they will bark\r\nin two keys as if there were twice as many of them as there really are.\r\nThey are the canny ones! Then when you pick up your gun and go where you\r\nthink they are, they will no be there; \'twill be at a different spot\r\nthey are at work."\r\n\r\n"Well, Don," said Mr. Clark, "I do not see but you and I have something\r\nahead of us. I am afraid we shall be of very little help, Sandy. Why,\r\none ought to be an expert to catch such a gamester as a coyote!"\r\n\r\n"Then you\'re no grudging us the loss of six lambs, Mr. Clark."\r\n\r\n"I do not see how you did so well--to lose only six in a great flock\r\nlike this!"\r\n\r\n"But even so, sir, I was that wrathful when I found I had been outwitted\r\nI could have cried. You see six or seven coyotes put their heads\r\ntogether, as they have a way of doing, and cut a group of lambs off from\r\nthe herd--got between them and the flock. It took the dogs to drive \'em\r\naway. Robin and the Prince are great fighters, and Colin is not far\r\nbehind. Before we got rid of them, though, we had lost three lambs. The\r\nnext time they tried a different trick: part of them barked and drew the\r\ndogs to a corner of the pasture, and then the rest came down on the\r\nunprotected end of the fold and carried away three more lambs."\r\n\r\n"Is there nothing that will stop them?" asked Donald.\r\n\r\n"We have tried many things. Some herders put strychnine in the carcasses\r\nof dead lambs and poison a few of the coyotes; most of them are too\r\nclever to be caught that way, though. The government has also killed\r\nmany. Perhaps to-night, Don, you may have a share in the good work. But\r\nI warn you do not send a bullet through one of my dogs, thinking his\r\nbarking is the yelp of one of these range thieves."\r\n\r\n"Indeed I\'ll be careful," Donald promised, as he sprang up and ran to\r\nthe edge of the rimrock to wave a good-bye to Luigi, who was\r\ndisappearing round a curve of the trail.\r\n\r\n"The lad is happy as a king here on the range, Sandy," Mr. Clark\r\nremarked.\r\n\r\n"He takes to it as if he had been bred on the hills, sir."\r\n\r\n"I wish he might like the work well enough to go into the business with\r\nme some time."\r\n\r\n"There is no telling. He is but young yet. When he is old as I, mayhap\r\nhe may choose to settle down and be a wool-grower."\r\n\r\n"How old are you, Sandy?"\r\n\r\n"I should be near thirty, sir, I\'m thinking, though I haven\'t always had\r\na birthday cake out here on the hills," was the whimsical reply.\r\n\r\n"Thirty! A rare age for such a level head as yours!"\r\n\r\n"I dinna ken about the head, Mr. Clark. My father used to say it was the\r\nheart that counted most. Now what say you to a basin of hot lentil\r\nsoup?" inquired the Scotchman, changing the subject. "You and Donald\r\nmust be hungry."\r\n\r\n"I believe we are. Let us go down to the tent. I see Donald there\r\nalready, building the fire."\r\n\r\nAfter having eaten a hearty meal they left the flock which was resting\r\nor grazing near by in charge of the dogs, and Mr. Clark, Donald, and the\r\nmen turned in to snatch a few hours\' sleep in anticipation of the long\r\nwatch before them.\r\n\r\nIt was deep twilight when they awoke.\r\n\r\nSandy shook Donald by the shoulder.\r\n\r\n"We must be up and away, laddie," he said, as the boy turned drowsily.\r\n"It\'s a man\'s work--real work you\'re doing here; you are no playing\r\nsheep-raiser. Rouse your father, snatch a bit of bread, and come and\r\nhelp me set the watch-fires. See, the Mexicans are already ahead of us."\r\n\r\nWith quick step he was off.\r\n\r\n"Dinna forget your rifle," he called as he went.\r\n\r\nDonald was on his feet.\r\n\r\n"Father," he shouted, "Sandy says we must be starting out."\r\n\r\nMr. Clark sat up.\r\n\r\n"I promised to obey Sandy, sure enough," he yawned, "and I like him all\r\nthe better for routing me out, sleepy though I am. I will be with you in\r\na moment. Where is Sandy?"\r\n\r\n"Setting watch-fires along the outer edge of the pasture. He says to\r\nbring your rifle."\r\n\r\nA little later and they had overtaken the Scotchman, who was striding\r\nalong through the darkness, swinging his lantern.\r\n\r\n"It is here I\'ll station you, Mr. Clark," said Sandy simply. "Patrol\r\nthis border as far as the bonfire; then turn backward and go until you\r\nmeet Bernardo. Donald will pace between the next two fires, and the\r\nMexicans and myself will complete the circle round the flock. Be careful\r\nlest bob-cats steal down on you unawares; they come softly as mice, make\r\nno fuss, and kill so quickly that they seldom disturb the herd. It is\r\nlikely we will no be troubled with them because of the fenced-in\r\npasture. Now cougars will leap the fence without the dogs knowing them\r\nto be at hand, too, and will take their kill off over their shoulders\r\nand disappear. We have seen no cougars, though, this year, and here\'s\r\nhoping that we won\'t. While you are patrolling I\'d advise you to fire\r\nnow and again, even though no beasts are in sight; it scares them off.\r\nNow I\'ve told you all I can. Good-night."\r\n\r\nAway into the falling darkness sped Sandy.\r\n\r\nDonald began his patrol. As he trudged back and forth on his beat he\r\ncould catch an occasional glimpse of the Scotchman, who stopped to toss\r\na few sticks on the fire or halted an instant to exchange a word with\r\none of the Mexicans. The boy could also see his father\'s dim figure\r\nwalking to and fro. It was dull work, this monotonous tramp. Donald\r\nlooked up at the canopy of stars and thought he had never seen so many.\r\nHe yawned, and yawned a second time. Still he kept up his even jog along\r\nthe outskirts of the fold.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he was conscious of a low whine not far away. It was repeated.\r\nThen came a loud barking as if a pack of wolves were on the other side\r\nof the pasture. He heard Sandy\'s voice echoing on the clear air. Two\r\nshots followed. Perhaps the coyotes were over there; or could it be a\r\ncougar or a bear? How he longed to be in the midst of the sport! Why\r\nshould he stay on this quiet, unmolested border of the pasture? Nothing\r\nwas happening here! An impulse to join his father or Sandy swept over\r\nhim; then a thought rose in his mind and held him back--if he left his\r\npatrol he would be a deserter, a deserter as blameworthy as any sentry\r\nwho fled from his post. Straightening up proudly, the boy resumed his\r\neven pace.\r\n\r\nIt was just as he turned that he caught sight of a crouching form\r\nslipping along the ground toward the edge of the flock. With a sharp\r\nflash Donald\'s rifle rang out. He shot into the air, not daring to aim\r\ntoward the pasture lest unwittingly he injure some of the sheep in the\r\ndarkness. His shot was answered by a yelp and a quick rush. Colin\r\nbounded to his side, sniffed, and darted into the herd.\r\n\r\nA commotion followed.\r\n\r\nThere was a struggle, a low growl of rage.\r\n\r\nThen the collie trotted back to Donald\'s side dragging in his teeth a\r\nlimp mass which he dropped at the lad\'s feet.\r\n\r\nThe boy struck a match and turned the creature over with his foot.\r\n\r\nIt was a coyote!\r\n\r\nThen how glad he was that he had not left his post!\r\n\r\nAt dawn Sandy came to relieve him. The herder glanced first at the dead\r\ncoyote, then at some faint tracks in the moist earth.\r\n\r\n"You have interrupted a midnight orgy, Don," he declared at last,\r\nrubbing his hands together as he always did when anything pleased him\r\nvery much. "Here are the marks of at least four coyotes that were\r\nstealing down on the flock when you fired. You got this one, and\r\nevidently drove off the others. I wish we had had as good luck on our\r\nside of the fold. In spite of his watchfulness Bernardo lost two lambs.\r\nHe is one of our best herders, too, and he is sore about it. You have\r\ndone a good night\'s work, lad. I am proud of my pupil!"\r\n\r\nAnd as Donald heard Sandy\'s words his lips parted in a smile and he felt\r\nhe would have patrolled a line twice as long to have earned the young\r\nScotchman\'s praise.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nA PREDICTION THAT CAME TRUE\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the lambs were three weeks old Sandy decided to break camp, leave\r\nthe fenced lambing-pasture, and push on to higher ground.\r\n\r\n"The sun is getting hot and we must have cooler quarters," he explained.\r\n"By nature sheep seek elevated ground, you know, and their health is\r\nbetter there. Now that their fleeces are getting so much thicker the\r\npoor beasts are too warm in the low places. What is more, they need the\r\nexercise of climbing. Grass, too, is becoming scant and we must not eat\r\nit down too close."\r\n\r\nMr. Clark agreed.\r\n\r\nTherefore a clear July morning saw the vast herd winding its way up the\r\nsteep incline of the mountainside. Sandy went on ahead, guiding the\r\nflock to the best pasturage and the freshest water-holes. The lambs\r\ntrotted at their mother\'s sides or frisked after them with the\r\nplayfulness of kittens. When a plentiful water supply and rich grass was\r\nfound Sandy often delayed the upward march a week or more, that the\r\nflock might make the most of the lush herbage. When feed was meager\r\nthere were days of scrambling up rocky stretches, and nights of\r\npatrolling the fold. Then more days of climbing would follow. Sometimes\r\na scarcity of water forced them to press on against their will.\r\n\r\nThey had now reached a high elevation, but the warmth of the July\r\nweather rendered the coolness welcome. The sheep gladly sought out the\r\nforest shade or, when they were above the timber-line, rested in the\r\nshadow of the high rocks. This rough land seemed to be the favorite\r\nplace for their sports, and Donald and his father were never tired\r\nwatching them.\r\n\r\nA single sheep would mount a boulder, from which vantage ground he would\r\nstand looking down at the herd. In a moment several of the flock would\r\nrush forward, butt him from the rock, and one of them would take his\r\nplace, only to be driven down and succeeded by the next victor. The\r\nsheep often played this for a long time.\r\n\r\n"It is a good game, too," declared Sandy, "for to rush up the side of a\r\nhigh rock like that and not slip back makes them sure-footed."\r\n\r\nAnother game the flock sometimes played was Follow the Leader, one old\r\newe marching ahead, followed by a line of sheep that went wherever she\r\nled them.\r\n\r\n"They play it almost as well as we did at school," said Donald, much\r\namused.\r\n\r\n"That is a useful game too," went on Sandy. "By playing it the young\r\nlambs learn to follow the others, and do what they do. That is one way\r\nthey get training to keep in the herd and obey the mind of the leader.\r\nIt is really more of a lesson than a game. I suspect, though, they are\r\nlike us--so long as they think it is a game they like to play it.\r\nPerhaps, now, if we were to hint to them it was a lesson they might\r\nnever play it again."\r\n\r\nDonald chuckled.\r\n\r\nThere were many times when it seemed to him that Sandy must be a boy of\r\nfourteen instead of a man of forty; yet the next moment the Scotchman\r\nwould address him with the gravity of a grandfather, and immediately\r\nDonald felt very young indeed. A strange mixture of youth and wisdom was\r\nSandy McCulloch!\r\n\r\nAs the lambs were now old enough to travel with the flock there was no\r\nfurther need for the Mexicans to linger on the range, and they therefore\r\nwent back over the trail to busy themselves at the home ranch until\r\nshearing time. The camp-tender, too, did not now take time to make the\r\ndifficult journey up into the mountains, but left supplies at a given\r\nspot in the lower pastures, or met some of the party half-way and\r\ndelivered over the provisions. If the rations were left it fell to the\r\nlot of one of the campers on the upper range to ride down on the pony\r\nand bring back "the grub," as Sandy called it. Once when Mr. Clark went\r\ndown it was only to find that the supplies had been scented out by a\r\nbear and dragged away; in consequence the party on the mountain were\r\nforced to get on without bread or fresh provisions until the tender made\r\nhis next round.\r\n\r\nAt times it was Donald\'s turn to make this trip; on other days Sandy or\r\nBernardo went. As there was always the chance of meeting a grizzly or a\r\nrattler the journey was not without its perils.\r\n\r\nThus the summer passed.\r\n\r\nThen came the fall days, when threatened cold made it necessary to turn\r\nthe heads of the herd toward the lower hills of the winter range.\r\nDownward they wended their way. Flurries of snow caught them unawares\r\nand at these blizzards Sandy\'s face always became grave, for it was in\r\none of these sudden squalls that his father, Old Angus, had perished.\r\nAlthough the days were chilly and the nights still colder, Mr. Clark and\r\nDonald kept resolutely with the flock; but when they reached the\r\nlowlands and the Scotch herder directed his band of sheep toward the\r\nbronzed fields of sage-brush and dried hay lying along the river valley\r\nDonald and his father bade good-bye to Bernardo and Sandy and returned\r\nto the shelter of the home ranch.\r\n\r\nThornton welcomed them.\r\n\r\nThere was something new in his manner--a strange, unaccustomed dignity\r\nwhich lent to the man a charm he had never before possessed.\r\n\r\n"Thornton did not shuffle toward us and look down as he usually does,"\r\nobserved Donald to his father when they were alone. "He is different,\r\nsomehow. What is it?"\r\n\r\n"I am not sure, son, but I cannot help feeling that Thornton has come to\r\nhis best self. The best is in all of us. It is not, however, always\r\nuppermost. Perhaps it is going to triumph in Thornton."\r\n\r\nThere unquestionably was a change in the big rough man.\r\n\r\nThat evening he got out the books and went over all the accounts with\r\nMr. Clark, telling him just what supplies he had ordered; what they had\r\ncost; and how much he had paid out in wages. In dealing with financial\r\nmatters Mr. Clark was on his native heath. He studied the columns of\r\nfigures critically. The accounts were correct to a cent, and he could\r\nreadily see that every reasonable economy had been practiced in the\r\nmanagement of the ranch.\r\n\r\n"You have done well, Thornton," he said after he had finished looking\r\nover the bills and papers. "I am greatly obliged to you for your\r\nfaithful work."\r\n\r\nDonald saw a flush of pleasure rise to the man\'s cheek.\r\n\r\n"My work has not always been faithful, Mr. Clark," Thornton declared\r\nwith sudden determination. "I want to tell you, sir, that I was not\r\nsetting out to be faithful to you at all. I wanted to get Johnson\'s\r\nplace, and then I meant to run Crescent Ranch to please myself. I am\r\ngoing to confess the whole thing; I want to confess it because your\r\nconfidence in me has made me ashamed of myself. You must have known\r\nsomehow that I was not running things as they ought to be run, else you\r\nwould never have come out here. Sandy knew it--so did all the old\r\nherders. Yet, save about the permits, you never have spoken a word of\r\nreproof, but have gone on trusting me. When you looked me so kindly in\r\nthe eye and went away leaving me in care of the whole home ranch I\r\nsomehow felt that you expected me to do the square thing."\r\n\r\nHis voice faltered.\r\n\r\nDonald, who had been an uncomfortable listener, now rose and tried to\r\nsteal out of the room unnoticed, but Thornton called him back.\r\n\r\n"Do not go, lad. You may be owning Crescent Ranch some day, and I want\r\nyou to hear what I have to say. There is not much more to tell. After\r\nyou and your father had gone to the range with Sandy I sat down and\r\nthought it all over. Here I was, alone! There was no getting away from\r\nmyself. I reviewed all the plans I had made--how I was going to stock\r\nsome of my friends at Glen City with provisions and charge it up to\r\nClark & Sons; how I was going to pad the accounts and keep the money--I\r\nwent over the whole thing, and I felt mean as a cur. It came to me that\r\nit was a pretty poor game. Then another plan came into my mind. You were\r\ngiving me a chance to be decent--why didn\'t I take it? I did. I have\r\nbeen absolutely honest about running the ranch while you have been gone,\r\nMr. Clark. I can look you and Donald in the eye just as Sandy, Jos\xc3\xa9,\r\nBernardo, and the other men do who have been working for your interest\r\nall these years."\r\n\r\nMr. Clark put out his hand.\r\n\r\n"I am glad you told me this, Thornton," he said quietly, "and I believe\r\nyou. See, here is a sheet of paper; it is scrawled over with letters and\r\nfigures of every sort. Turn it over."\r\n\r\nWonderingly the man obeyed. Nothing was written on the other side. It\r\nwas a blank page.\r\n\r\n"You see there is nothing on that side," went on Donald\'s father. "We\r\ncan there write what we will. Turn your own page the same way. Let us\r\nforget the past. Now for the future! Will you take the position as\r\nmanager of Crescent Ranch?"\r\n\r\nThornton was aghast.\r\n\r\n"I, sir! I? After all that has happened?" he contrived to stammer.\r\n\r\n"Why not?"\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t do it, Mr. Clark. Not one of the men would believe in me.\r\nNo, I am going to leave this place after the shearing is over, and go\r\nsomewhere where no one knows me; there I can make a fresh start. And\r\nanyway, even if all this had not happened, I am not the man to be\r\nmanager here. I have neither the confidence of the herders, nor the\r\nnecessary knowledge about the flocks. But there is a man on Crescent\r\nRanch who knows everything there is to know about sheep-raising--a man\r\nhonest as the day, and who loves the place as if it was his own--Sandy\r\nMcCulloch, sir. He is the only man for the position--there never has\r\nbeen any one else. Put him in as manager and you will never regret it."\r\n\r\nDonald sprang up.\r\n\r\n"Oh, father, do put Sandy in," he cried. "I never thought of Sandy as\r\nmanager--he seems so young!"\r\n\r\n"I have thought of him all along," Thornton continued. "That is why I\r\nwas so ready with a word against him every chance I got. I have been\r\nafraid of him--afraid of his honesty and his goodness. It was not that\r\nhe would tell tales about me; Sandy is too big-natured a man to do\r\nthat. He would scorn to use a mean weapon. No, it was just because he\r\nwas what he was that I feared him."\r\n\r\nMr. Clark was silent.\r\n\r\n"You owe it to Old Angus, Sandy\'s father, to give the lad the place,\r\nsir," pleaded Thornton.\r\n\r\n"And if I did what is to become of you, Thornton?" asked the owner\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know. It does not matter. I will stay here until after the\r\nshearing, for it is a busy time and I might be of help. Then I can go\r\nand look up something else."\r\n\r\nDonald watched his father as he bent forward and stirred the fire. The\r\nwell-known little wrinkle had come in his forehead and the boy knew that\r\nhis mind was busy.\r\n\r\n"Thornton," said Mr. Clark at last, "have you relatives here in the\r\nWest?"\r\n\r\n"No, sir."\r\n\r\n"Are you alone in the world?"\r\n\r\n"Yes."\r\n\r\n"Would you like to go East with Donald and me when we return to Boston\r\nafter the shearing?"\r\n\r\nThornton regarded him blankly.\r\n\r\n"I need another man in my office," explained the wool-broker. "You have\r\nproved yourself a good accountant. Furthermore it would be greatly to\r\nour advantage to have a reliable helper who is familiar with ranch\r\naffairs and knows Sandy, the new manager. Then if I wanted some one, as\r\nI often have in the past, to make the trip out here and attend to\r\nbusiness for me, you could do it."\r\n\r\nThornton got up and walked to the window. They could not see his face.\r\nHe stood with his back toward them, looking out into the darkness.\r\n\r\nThen suddenly he wheeled and came to Mr. Clark\'s side.\r\n\r\n"You took me by surprise, sir," he said unsteadily. "I cannot thank you.\r\nI know well it is another chance you are giving me. I will take it and\r\ngo East, and there I will prove to you that in the future you can trust\r\nme."\r\n\r\n"You have proved that already, Thornton," replied Donald\'s father, as he\r\nsmiled up into the face of the ranchman and gripped his coarse brown\r\nhand.\r\n\r\nAfter Thornton had left the room Donald and his father were silent.\r\n\r\nAt last the boy said:\r\n\r\n"You were right about Thornton, father. He was honest with you, just as\r\nyou predicted he would be."\r\n\r\n"I believe if you expect the best of a man you will usually get it,"\r\nreplied Mr. Clark. "There is something big and honest in each of us\r\nwhich springs to meet the big and honest in somebody else. Appeal to\r\nthat best side of people and it will respond. I have seldom known the\r\nrule to fail. Now just one thing more. Do not forget that this man has\r\ngiven us his confidence. It is a thing we must hold sacred. Never repeat\r\nwhat you have heard. And above all remember that Thornton deserves both\r\nadmiration and respect, for it is only great natures that admit they\r\nhave done wrong."\r\n\r\nDonald nodded.\r\n\r\n"I like Thornton better than I did before father," he said softly.\r\n\r\n"So do I, son!"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE SHEARING\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was great rejoicing among the herders when, in the latter part of\r\nApril, they drove their flocks to Glen City for the shearing, and heard\r\nthat Sandy McCulloch had been made manager of Crescent Ranch.\r\n\r\nMr. Clark and Donald gave out the facts with greatest care--how Thornton\r\nwas to become Clark & Son\'s confidential man at the Boston office; and\r\nhow Sandy was to take the vast sheep-raising portion of the business\r\nunder his direction.\r\n\r\n"It is a proud day for you, Sandy!" cried Jos\xc3\xa9.\r\n\r\n"I\'m no pretending I ain\'t pleased," replied Sandy, beaming on the\r\nMexican, "but dinna think I\'m proud. If I do my work well pride may\r\ncome; still, it\'s no time for it now."\r\n\r\n"Of course you\'ll do it well--how could you help it! It is in your\r\nblood," Jos\xc3\xa9 declared. "You have your father\'s own knack about the\r\nflocks. It is the real love for herding--a kind of part of you, it\r\nseems."\r\n\r\n"I get it from generations of shepherds who have tended the black-faced\r\nsheep among the broom and the heather on the hills of Scotland, I doubt\r\nnot," answered Sandy.\r\n\r\n"Well, it stands you in good stead, however you come by it," Jos\xc3\xa9 called\r\nover his shoulder as he moved off toward the pen where his sheep were.\r\n\r\n"I hope it may stand me in good stead in the future, Don," Sandy said\r\ngravely to the boy beside him.\r\n\r\n"I am sure it will. Isn\'t it splendid, Sandy, to see the herders all so\r\npleased and ready to follow out your orders? I think nothing could have\r\nmade me happier than to have you put in to manage the ranch."\r\n\r\n"I\'m verra, verra glad myself, laddie. It is a thing I never dared hope\r\nfor, and I would not have wanted to take the job from Thornton. But\r\nsince he is going East and is to be well provided for it makes\r\neverything right."\r\n\r\n"And yet you telegraphed my father to come here, Sandy."\r\n\r\nIt was the first time the telegram had ever been mentioned between them.\r\n\r\nSandy hesitated.\r\n\r\n"I felt your father should come out here and cast his eye over the place\r\nand, loving the ranch so well, I took it on myself to send for him. But\r\nI told no tales. It was his task to find the flaws if there were any. I\r\nam no certain what he found and I dinna want to hear. I simply know the\r\nsnarls have straightened themselves out, and that Crescent Ranch is now\r\ngoing on better than it has in years. The men have all been glad for a\r\nglimpse of your father. It is no so much fun working for somebody you\r\nhave never seen. It has been a great thing to have him come. And as for\r\nthe herds--was there ever a finer sight?"\r\n\r\nHe swept his hand around dramatically.\r\n\r\nOn every side, in numbered pens, sheep were waiting to be sheared.\r\n\r\nIt was the first time Donald had seen the stock all together and it was\r\nindeed, as Sandy had declared, a fine sight.\r\n\r\nThe herders were not a little proud of the thickness of the fleeces of\r\ntheir respective flocks and much good-natured banter passed between\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n"Is it on corn-husks you have been feeding your ewes that they look so\r\nsickly?" called one Mexican to another.\r\n\r\nThe swarthy herdsman grinned.\r\n\r\n"Mind your own band, Manuel Torquello! You haven\'t a fleece in your fold\r\nthat will tip the scales at ten pounds."\r\n\r\nBoth men laughed and passed on.\r\n\r\n"How much ought fleeces to weigh, Sandy?" asked Donald.\r\n\r\n"From six to ten pounds--as the clip runs. Some are heavier, some\r\nlighter. It depends on the quality of the wool, and the amount of oil in\r\nit."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see why the shearing is not done at the ranch instead of\r\ndriving all the sheep down here to Glen City," panted Donald as he tried\r\nto keep up with Sandy\'s strides.\r\n\r\n"Why, you see, lad, it is much more convenient to have the wool clipped\r\nnear the railroad. In that way we do away with carting it. The fleeces\r\ncan be sheared, packed, weighed, and put right on the cars. Beside that,\r\nwe get the power to run our plant from Glen City. Our shearing is done\r\nby electricity and not by hand, you know."\r\n\r\n"It is mean of me to make you answer questions, Sandy, when you are in\r\nsuch a hurry," Donald ventured hesitatingly, "but I wish you had time to\r\nexplain to me about the shearing."\r\n\r\nSandy was in a hurry--there was no denying that!\r\n\r\nHe and Donald had driven down from Crescent that morning, and were to\r\nmeet Thornton and Mr. Clark as soon as possible at the shed where the\r\nshearing was to be done. Nevertheless, in spite of his haste, Sandy\r\ntried as he went along to answer Donald\'s question.\r\n\r\n"There was a time long ago when all shearing was done by hand. In the\r\nspring bands of traveling shearers came from ranch to ranch and sheared\r\nthe flocks for so much a day. Sometimes these men were Mexicans,\r\nsometimes Indians. As they made a business of shearing and nothing else\r\nthey became verra skilful with the shears and could turn off many\r\nfleeces a day. It is an art to shear a sheep. Many a try must you have\r\nbefore you can do it. The smaller ranches still shear by hand, for it\r\ndoes not pay to run a power plant unless you have large flocks."\r\n\r\n"I suppose a power plant does the work quicker," suggested Donald.\r\n\r\n"No, I think good shearers can clip the fleeces almost as fast. The\r\nchief advantage in machinery is that it takes the wool off closer, and\r\nyou do not need such skilled men to do the work. You just have to\r\nremember not to shear flocks this way in summer, for the wool would be\r\ncut so close that your sheep would be wild with flies and sunburn before\r\ntheir coats grew long enough to protect them."\r\n\r\nThey had now reached the plant, where they were to meet Donald\'s father\r\nand Thornton; they mounted the steps of the low building and went in.\r\nImmediately they were greeted by the whirr of wheels, the chatter of\r\nmany herders, and the blatting of sheep.\r\n\r\nMr. Clark came forward.\r\n\r\n"Well, Don," he said, "this is quite a sight, isn\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"I should say it was! I had no idea shearing was done this way. It is\r\njust the way they clip horses or cut my hair."\r\n\r\nHis father smiled.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is done on the same principle. Let us watch this man here. He\r\nis just starting. I thought he would tie the feet of the sheep first,\r\nbut he does not seem to be doing it; instead he is turning it up on its\r\nrump, and holding it with his left arm so its hoofs cannot touch the\r\nfloor. They say sheep never kick or struggle if their feet are raised\r\nfrom the ground. Now he is starting with the shears. See! He is opening\r\nthe wool by a cut down the right shoulder. How neatly the fleece comes\r\noff--almost in one piece, as if it was a jacket!"\r\n\r\n"I guess that was a smooth-skinned sheep," laughed Donald, "or the\r\nshearer never could have done it so quickly."\r\n\r\nThe man who was shearing overheard him.\r\n\r\n"It was a smooth-skinned one," he called. "Still, even the wrinkly\r\nMerinos loose their coats pretty fast. Watch and see. I have one right\r\nhere."\r\n\r\nDonald watched.\r\n\r\nIt was fascinating.\r\n\r\n"I\'d like to try it," he said glancing up at his father.\r\n\r\n"I guess you\'d have trouble!"\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t mind the trouble if I wasn\'t afraid of cutting the sheep,"\r\nreplied the boy.\r\n\r\n"Suppose you leave it until you come West the next time," called Sandy,\r\nwho chanced to be passing and heard his words. "You mustn\'t do\r\neverything this trip, or you\'ll have nothing to look forward to when you\r\ncome again."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps it\'s as well for the sheep!" grunted the Mexican who was\r\nshearing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "I\'D LIKE TO TRY IT"]\r\n\r\n"I shouldn\'t wonder!" answered Donald good-naturedly.\r\n\r\nBut what a charm there was in that crisp snip of the shears!\r\n\r\nAt last, however, Donald and his father moved on to where crews of men\r\nwere busy at smooth board tables.\r\n\r\n"What are they doing here?" Donald asked.\r\n\r\n"They are tying fleeces," explained Mr. Clark.\r\n\r\n"But don\'t they wash that dirty wool before they tie it up?" questioned\r\nthe boy, astounded.\r\n\r\nSandy, who had joined them for the moment, laughed at Donald\'s disgust.\r\n\r\n"You\'d have us washing and ironing it, perhaps," he chuckled. "No, no!\r\nWe used to wash all fleeces before they were clipped, \'tis true. But\r\nyour father says that now buyers care little for them washed. Folks will\r\npay about as much for good wool unwashed as washed. It is a lucky thing\r\nfor us, because it saves us much trouble; more than that, it is better\r\nfor the sheep not to be put through the water. The thick fleece stays\r\ndamp for many days, and unless the creature is range-bred and therefore\r\nused to all weather it suffers a shock, and is liable to be sick. You\r\ncan\'t shear a flock until about two weeks after washing, for not only\r\nmust the fleece dry, but new yolk must form in the wool. If the wool is\r\ntoo dry the shears will not slip through it."\r\n\r\n"But by the end of two weeks I should think the sheep would have his\r\nfleece all dirty again," objected Donald.\r\n\r\n"That is just the point--he does."\r\n\r\n"Why couldn\'t you wash the fleece after it is taken off?"\r\n\r\n"We could. It is done sometimes. Your father can tell you that he sends\r\noff wool and has it scoured before selling it if a buyer wishes it\r\ndone."\r\n\r\nMr. Clark nodded.\r\n\r\n"But here," continued Sandy, "we wash no fleeces. We do take care,\r\nthough, not to tie very dirty pieces in with the fleece. My father\r\nalways insisted on the tying being honest. Only wool went into the\r\nbundle. You and your father must watch and see how quickly they do the\r\ntying."\r\n\r\nAs Sandy flitted away again Mr. Clark and Donald made their way to the\r\nlong table where the boys who went about among the shearers and\r\ncollected the fleeces were tossing them down.\r\n\r\nEach fleece was spread out on the table, the belly and loose ends folded\r\ndeftly inside; then the whole was fastened into a square bundle.\r\n\r\n"It would seem as if any twine would do to tie a package like that,\r\nwouldn\'t it, Don?" said Mr. Clark.\r\n\r\n"Of course."\r\n\r\n"It is not so," went on his father. "There is nothing about which a\r\nwool-grower has to be more careful than about the twine with which he\r\nties his fleeces. You must always avoid using a fiber twine--by that I\r\nmean hemp, or any variety having fibers which will break off in the\r\nwool. These fibers or particles get stuck in the fleeces, and later when\r\nthe wool reaches the mill, the mill people do not like it. Either the\r\nbits of hemp have to be picked out--an endless job--or the wool is sent\r\nback. You can see that they could not dye wool with all these little\r\nparticles in it. The hemp would take a different color from the rest of\r\nthe wool, and would result in specked goods."\r\n\r\n"What kind of twine do we use, father?" asked Donald, much interested.\r\n\r\n"We use a paper twine. Other growers often tie their fleeces with glazed\r\ntwine."\r\n\r\n"I never should have thought twine could make so much trouble," mused\r\nthe lad.\r\n\r\n"You would think of it, though, if you had once been set to picking\r\nfiber out of wool as I was when I was a boy!" interrupted Sandy, as he\r\ndarted past.\r\n\r\nDonald and his father followed at the heels of the young Scotchman as he\r\nwent through into another shed where the wool was being packed. Here lay\r\ngreat piles of tied fleeces and heaps of loose wool. About the shed\r\nstood wooden frames from the center of which swung burlap sacks used for\r\npacking the clip.\r\n\r\n"Why do the men first stuff the two lower corners of the bags with wool\r\nand tie them?" the boy asked after he had looked on a few moments.\r\n\r\n"We call those corners ears," replied his father. "Sacks of wool are not\r\nonly awkward to handle but very heavy, and it is a help to have the\r\ncorners, firmly tied, to take hold of."\r\n\r\nDonald nodded. He was too busy looking about him to reply.\r\n\r\nThe men packing the wool took one of the burlap bags, fitted its mouth\r\nover a wooden hoop just the right size, and fastened the bag inside the\r\nframe in such a way that it hung its full length and just cleared the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\nThen the packer began tossing wool into the sack.\r\n\r\nWhen it was about half-full he jumped into it and tramped the fleeces\r\ndown solidly.\r\n\r\nAfterward he climbed out and another man wheeled a truck under the\r\nframe; then the packer freed the sack, and when it dropped it was\r\npromptly sewed up and wheeled to the scales, where it was weighed. Its\r\nweight was entered in a book by a man who kept the tally and the same\r\nfigures were also roughly painted on the bag.\r\n\r\n"And there\'s the end of it!" exclaimed Sandy, who came up and stood\r\nbeside Donald as Mr. Clark walked away. "Now you know the wool business,\r\nDon!"\r\n\r\nDonald shook his head.\r\n\r\n"It will take me longer than this to know the wool business," he\r\nanswered. "I mean when we get home, though, to get father to tell me the\r\nrest of it--about the selling and manufacturing."\r\n\r\n"That part would be new to me too," said Sandy. "Here we have no\r\nselling; we do not even auction off our own wool, as you see, for our\r\nclip goes direct to our owners. But when a ranch sells its wool to other\r\nbuyers the manager has lively days, I can tell you. Both Anchor and Star\r\nRanch sell to brokers. They send out word that they have wool for sale\r\nand the Eastern buyers swarm here like flies. They bid on the wool--bid\r\nright against each other, even though sometimes they are the best of\r\nfriends. The men get an idea of the price they want to pay by looking\r\nover the fleeces and seeing how they will grade up. Above everything\r\nelse a wool buyer must have a trained eye, quick to detect the quality\r\nof the shipment offered for sale. That is what decides him on how high\r\nhe will bid. After the buyers have got up to what they consider a\r\nreasonable price they stop bidding. The wool-grower must then accept the\r\nhighest bid."\r\n\r\n"But he may not be satisfied with the price," put in Donald.\r\n\r\n"It makes no difference. They are supposed to make a fair bid on the\r\nclip."\r\n\r\n"What if he shouldn\'t take it?"\r\n\r\n"Why, then all the brokers who have bid on the wool leave town pledging\r\neach other not to bid on that particular shipment of wool for two\r\nweeks," replied Sandy.\r\n\r\n"Why?" inquired Donald, opening his eyes.\r\n\r\n"It is to protect the brokers. You can see the justice in it when you\r\nthink a moment. These Easterners are busy men and they come a long way.\r\nThey can\'t take a trip to some far-off ranch only to find the\r\nwool-grower has decided not to sell his fleeces; or that he will not\r\nsell them below a certain price. If a man really does not want to sell\r\nhe must not get the buyers there; if he does he must be content with\r\nwhat they offer. Your father would have to buy his wool this way if he\r\ndid not own Crescent Ranch; and even so he may send men to buy wool at\r\noutside ranches too, for all I know."\r\n\r\n"I am going to ask him," Donald said.\r\n\r\n"Do not ask him now. He might not want to talk his business over here.\r\nWait until you get back East."\r\n\r\n"I hate to think of going back home, Sandy," the boy declared, regret in\r\nhis tones.\r\n\r\n"All good things must come to an end, lad. You will go back, finish your\r\nschooling, go to college as your father wishes, and then, a gentleman\r\ngrown, you will be choosing some work."\r\n\r\nSandy studied Donald keenly.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I suppose that is just what I shall do. I am thinking some of\r\nstudying law, Sandy."\r\n\r\nThe Scotchman\'s face fell, but Donald did not notice it.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve always thought I should like to stand up in court and make a great\r\nplea--a speech that would sweep people off their feet," went on Donald.\r\n"Or," he added reflectively, "I may be a judge."\r\n\r\nSandy scratched his head.\r\n\r\n"There\'s a good bit step between studying law and being a judge," said\r\nhe.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps after all I may decide not to be a judge," ruminated Donald. "I\r\nhave always wanted to manage a baseball team and I may think I would\r\nrather do that."\r\n\r\n"Go on with you!" Sandy cried. "Next you\'ll be having yourself a\r\nlighthouse-keeper." Then he added wistfully: "But no matter what you\r\nare, laddie, dinna forget Crescent Ranch."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nHOME TO THE EAST\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin two weeks Thornton, Mr. Clark, and Donald were back in\r\nMassachusetts, and the thread of Eastern life was once more taken up.\r\n\r\nDonald did not return to school, since it was now so near June that to\r\nenter the class seemed useless; instead it was decided that he should\r\nhave a tutor through the summer to help him make up the work he had\r\nlost, and thereby enable him to go on with his class in the fall. This\r\ntutor, however, had to be found, and until he was the boy was free from\r\nduties of every sort. It gave him a strange sense of loneliness to be\r\nwith nothing to do. All his friends were in school--there was no one to\r\nplay with.\r\n\r\n"I think I\'ll go in to the office with you, father," he suggested one\r\nmorning. "It is stupid staying round in Cambridge when all the fellows\r\nare slaving for their exams. I have been so busy while out on the ranch\r\nthat now I do not know what to do with myself."\r\n\r\nMr. Clark agreed to the proposal cordially.\r\n\r\nIn consequence it came about that Donald joined Thornton at the large\r\nBoston warehouse. The store was not new to the boy, for he had often\r\nbeen there with his father; but to Thornton this part of the wool\r\nbusiness was as novel as the first glimpses of ranching had been to\r\nDonald. The high building of yellow brick with floor after floor of\r\nhurrying men, the offices noisy with the hum of typewriters, the ring of\r\ntelephones, the comings and goings of messenger-boys and\r\nmail-carriers--all this little universe of rush and confusion was an\r\nuntried world to Thornton. Its strangeness dazed him.\r\n\r\nMr. Clark promptly placed him in the accounting department, but to his\r\nsurprise Thornton foundered there helplessly. It was one thing to keep\r\nbooks amid the quiet and leisure of Crescent Ranch, and quite another to\r\nstruggle with columns of figures in the riot of modern business\r\nsurroundings. At the end of three days the Westerner looked gray and\r\ntired, and had accomplished nothing.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what I am going to do with him, Don," announced Mr. Clark,\r\nmuch troubled. "I have brought him here from Idaho, and of course I am\r\nbound to look out for him; yet there does not seem to be an earthly\r\nthing he can do. My plan was to set him to keeping books in Cook\'s\r\nplace, and send Cook out to Crescent Ranch to help Sandy. Sandy, you\r\nknow, cannot handle accounts. Poor lad--he had little opportunity for\r\nschooling in his youth, and the financial side of his work is his one\r\nweak spot. He realizes this himself, and it was only on the condition\r\nthat I send him an assistant that he would undertake the management of\r\nthe ranch at all. I expected, as I say, that Cook would go; evidently,\r\nhowever, Thornton is not going to be able to fill his place. What shall\r\nI do with Thornton, Don? We must find a niche for him somehow."\r\n\r\nDonald reflected a moment.\r\n\r\n"Had you thought, father, of trying him up-stairs?" he asked.\r\n\r\n"No, I hadn\'t. We need a foreman up there, but I had not considered\r\nThornton for the position. That is a happy inspiration, son. We will\r\ngive him a try. He may make good yet."\r\n\r\nAccordingly Thornton was sent to the upper floors of the warehouse,\r\nwhere the wool was stored. Here were great piles of loose wool reaching\r\nfrom floor to ceiling. Some piles contained only the finest wool; other\r\npiles that which was next-best in quality; still other piles were made\r\nup of the coarser varieties. There were piles of scoured wool, piles of\r\nSouth American and Australian wool--wool, wool, wool everywhere!\r\n\r\nWith keen interest Thornton looked about him. He wandered from one vast\r\npyramid of fleeces to another, catching up handfuls of the different\r\nvarieties and examining them. Then he walked to where the men were busy\r\nopening the first spring shipments of wool from Crescent Ranch. The\r\nwool was emptied from the sacks onto the floor in great heaps, and crews\r\nof men--skilled in judging the fiber--set to work to sort it, separating\r\nthe different qualities into piles. Donald, who was looking on, saw a\r\nsmile pass over Thornton\'s face--the first smile that had brightened it\r\nin days. Then, almost instinctively, the ranchman rolled up his sleeves\r\nand began to grade wool with the other men. He worked rapidly, for he\r\nwas thoroughly familiar with what he was doing.\r\n\r\nThe next day when Donald went up-stairs he found Thornton directing a\r\nlot of green hands who were packing the sorted, or graded wool, in bags.\r\nLater in the week it chanced that the man who weighed the wool fell ill\r\nand the Westerner took his place at the scales, seeing that the sacks of\r\nwool were correctly weighed and recorded, that they were sewed up\r\nstrongly, and marked for shipping.\r\n\r\nGradually the men, recognizing Thornton\'s ability, began to defer to his\r\njudgment. The month was not out before Clark & Sons began to wonder\r\nwhat they had done before Thornton came. So familiar did he make himself\r\nwith the stock that even Mr. Clark sent for and consulted him about\r\norders and shipments.\r\n\r\n"He is proving himself a thoroughly useful man, Don," declared Mr. Clark\r\nrubbing his hands with satisfaction. "His knowledge of the ranch and of\r\nthe wool itself is invaluable. It is just a case of putting the peg into\r\nthe proper hole. Thornton was like a fish out of water here in the\r\noffice. Now he is in his element. I shall make him foreman of the\r\nshipping department--a position just suited to him, and which he will\r\nfill well."\r\n\r\n"I am so glad he has made good, father," said Donald. "Now, what are you\r\ngoing to do about an assistant for Sandy? That is the next question to\r\nsettle, I suppose. Have you found any one?"\r\n\r\n"Not yet. I have had a great deal to do, Don. I shall, however, look up\r\nsome one as soon as possible. In the meantime, before you start in with\r\nyour tutor, and Thornton gets so rushed that he cannot be spared, I want\r\nto take you both to Mortonstown to visit the Monitor Mills. Thornton\r\nhas never seen the manufacture of woolen goods and will be the more\r\nintelligent for doing so; as for you, I am anxious to have you complete\r\nthe story of wool-growing which you began at Crescent Ranch. To stop\r\nshort of visiting a mill now would be like reading the opening chapters\r\nof a book and never finishing the volume."\r\n\r\n"I do want to know the rest of the story very much, father," Donald\r\nreplied. "I told Sandy when I was out West that I hoped you would some\r\ntime take me to a mill. Since we got home, though, you have been so busy\r\nthat I did not like to ask you."\r\n\r\n"That was thoughtful of you, son. Ordinarily I should have preferred to\r\nwait; it chances, however, that something has come up which obliges me\r\nto see the Monitor people right away. So I shall go out there to-morrow,\r\ntaking Thornton with me, and if you like you may go also."\r\n\r\n"Of course I\'d like!" exclaimed Donald eagerly.\r\n\r\nThe next day proved to be so gloriously clear that instead of making\r\nthe trip to Mortonstown by train Mr. Clark decided to run out in his\r\ntouring-car. It was not a long ride--something over twenty-five\r\nmiles--but to Thornton, unaccustomed to the luxury of a modern\r\nautomobile, the journey was one of unalloyed delight.\r\n\r\n"It is like riding in a sitting-room on wheels, isn\'t it?" he murmured\r\nwith a sigh of satisfaction.\r\n\r\n"Some day you will be having a car of your own, Thornton," Mr. Clark\r\nsaid, smiling.\r\n\r\n"And riding to Idaho in it," put in Donald.\r\n\r\n"Well, it is about the smoothest way I ever traveled!" declared the\r\nranchman. "When we came East I thought that sleeping-car close to a\r\nmoving palace; but this thing has the train beaten to a frazzle. You see\r\nI am used to jolting over rough roads in springless wagons, and it is\r\nsomething new to me to go along as if I was sliding down-hill on a\r\nvelvet sofa-cushion."\r\n\r\nDonald and his father heartily enjoyed the big fellow\'s pleasure.\r\n\r\nAs for Thornton, when the car came to a stop before the puffing\r\nMortonstown mills it was with regret that he dragged himself from the\r\nseat. Still, he had the ride home in anticipation--that was a comforting\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nOnce within the mills, however, even the memory of the homeward journey\r\nfaded from his mind. The vast buildings throbbing with the beat of\r\nengines, the click and whirr of bobbins, and the clash of machinery,\r\nblotted out everything else.\r\n\r\nWhen they entered Mr. Munger, the manager, who was expecting them, came\r\nforward cordially.\r\n\r\n"We were glad to hear by telephone that you were coming out to-day, Mr.\r\nClark," he said. "Mr. Bailey, the president, is waiting to see you in\r\nhis private office."\r\n\r\n"Very well," answered Mr. Clark. "Now while I am talking with him I\r\nshould greatly appreciate it if my son Donald, and my foreman, Mr.\r\nThornton, might go over the works. They have never visited a woolen\r\nmill."\r\n\r\n"We shall be delighted to show them about," answered Mr. Munger. "I will\r\nsend some one with them."\r\n\r\nTurning, the manager beckoned to a young man who was busy at a desk.\r\n\r\n"This gentleman," continued he, "has been with us many years and will be\r\nable to answer all your questions. Take these visitors through the\r\nfactory, Mac, show them everything, and bring them back here. Now if you\r\nare ready, Mr. Clark, we will join Mr. Bailey."\r\n\r\nDonald and Thornton moved away, following their guide into a building\r\njust across the yard. Here wool was being sorted by staplers who were\r\nexpert in judging its quality. They worked at frames covered with wire\r\nnetting which allowed the dirt to sift through, and as they handled the\r\nmaterial and tossed it into the proper piles they picked out straws,\r\nburrs, and other waste caught in it.\r\n\r\n"This sorting must be carefully done," explained the bookkeeper who was\r\nshowing them about, "or the wool will not take the dye well. Much\r\ndepends on having the fleeces clear of waste. We also are very\r\nparticular about the sorting. The finest wool, as you know, comes from\r\nthe sides of the sheep; that clipped from the head and legs is coarse\r\nand stiff. All this we separate before we send the fleeces on to be\r\nscoured. In this next room you will see how the material is washed."\r\n\r\nThey passed on and next saw how steam was blown through the wool, not\r\nonly removing the dirt but softening the fibers. The fleeces were also\r\nwashed in many great bowls of soap and water.\r\n\r\n"Here again we must exercise great care that the water is clean and the\r\nsoap pure, or the wool will not dye perfectly. We use a kind of potash\r\nsoap which we are sure is of the best make. Another thing which renders\r\nthe scouring of wool difficult is that we must not curl or snarl it\r\nwhile we are washing it."\r\n\r\n"I don\'t see how you can help it," Donald said.\r\n\r\n"We can if we take proper care," returned the bookkeeper.\r\n\r\n"And what is this other machine for?" inquired Thornton, pointing to one\r\nat the end of the room.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "WHAT IS THIS OTHER MACHINE?"]\r\n\r\n"That machine is picking the wool apart so that the air can get through\r\nit and help it to dry. After it is picked up light and fluffy we pass\r\nit through these heavy rollers, which are like wringers and which\r\nsqueeze out the remaining moisture. Yet during all these processes we\r\nmust always be careful not to snarl the wool. See, here is where it\r\ncomes out white and clean, ready to go to the dyeing room."\r\n\r\nDonald regarded the snowy fleeces with wonder.\r\n\r\n"You would never dream it could be the same wool!" he said. "Isn\'t it\r\nbeautiful? It is not much the way it looks when it leaves the ranch, is\r\nit, Thornton?"\r\n\r\n"I should say not," agreed the Westerner emphatically. "The sheep ought\r\nto see how handsome their coats are."\r\n\r\n"So they should!" answered the young bookkeeper. "You have been on a\r\nranch then?"\r\n\r\n"We have just come from one," Donald answered.\r\n\r\n"Have you, indeed! It is a free life--not much like being shut up inside\r\nbrick walls."\r\n\r\n"You have been West yourself, perhaps," ventured Thornton.\r\n\r\n"Yes, years ago--when I was a boy; but not recently."\r\n\r\n"Ah, you should see the sheep country now!" Thornton went on. "It is\r\nmuch improved, I reckon, since you were there."\r\n\r\n"I imagine so," the young guide answered with a wistful smile. "It is so\r\nlong since I have had a breath of real air that I have almost forgotten\r\nhow it would seem."\r\n\r\n"If you are wanting fresh air go out on the ranges and fill your lungs.\r\nYou will find plenty there," declared the ranchman.\r\n\r\n"That is just what they are trying to make me do," the young man\r\nreplied, "I have not been very well this year and Mr. Munger thinks the\r\nconfinement in the mill is telling on me. He wants me to go West for a\r\nvacation."\r\n\r\n"And should you like to?" questioned Donald.\r\n\r\nThe man did not answer; instead he said:\r\n\r\n"Suppose we go on. We must not waste too much time here. In this next\r\nroom you will see how the dyeing is done. We use centrifugal machines,\r\nand beside those we have these others to keep the wool spread and\r\nturned. With all our care not to snarl or curl it, it will get matted\r\nand must therefore be picked apart again. So we pass it through these\r\nrevolving drums which, you see, have sets of spikes on them; as the\r\nspikes on the different drums turn they catch in the wool and pick it\r\nall apart so it is again light and fluffy as it was before."\r\n\r\n"Doesn\'t so much washing and dyeing take out all the yolk, and make the\r\nwool very dry?" inquired Thornton.\r\n\r\nThe young man conducting them seemed pleased at the question.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it does! That is just the trouble. Therefore we are forced to set\r\nabout getting some oil back into it; otherwise it would be so harsh and\r\nstiff that we could do nothing with it. So we put the thin layers of\r\nwool into these machines and carry them along to a spraying apparatus\r\nwhich sprays them evenly with oil. We use olive oil, but some other\r\nmanufacturers prefer lard oil or oleine."\r\n\r\n"How funny to have to put oil back into the wool after you have just\r\nwashed it out!" Donald remarked.\r\n\r\n"It is funny, isn\'t it?" nodded the bookkeeper. "Now on this side of the\r\nroom they are blending the fleeces. Sometimes we blend different\r\nqualities of wool to get a desired effect, or sometimes we blend the\r\nwool with cotton or a different fiber. We take a thin layer of wool,\r\nthen put another layer of a different kind over it. We then pick it all\r\nup together until we get a uniform mixture."\r\n\r\n"It is a surprise to me that the wool has to go through so much red tape\r\nbefore it comes to spinning," Thornton said.\r\n\r\n"It is a long process," responded their guide. "I remember when I first\r\nsaw it, it seemed endless. Now I think little of it."\r\n\r\n"We get used to everything in time, I suppose," Thornton answered; then\r\nhe added whimsically: "Still, I don\'t think I should ever get used to\r\nriding in an automobile."\r\n\r\nA hearty laugh came from behind them, and turning they saw Mr. Clark and\r\nMr. Munger, the manager.\r\n\r\n"I came to hunt you up," said Mr. Clark. "I have finished my interview\r\nwith Mr. Bailey, and it seemed to me that by this time you must have\r\nfinished spinning your next-winter\'s overcoat, Don."\r\n\r\n"But I haven\'t, father," retorted Donald, smiling into his father\'s\r\nface. "I have not even begun to make the cloth at all."\r\n\r\n"The yarn is not spun yet, sir," put in the young man who was with them.\r\n\r\n"You are a slow guide, Mac, I fear," Mr. Munger laughed, laying a kindly\r\nhand on his bookkeeper\'s shoulder. "That is the chief fault with you\r\nScotchmen--you are too thorough. Now let us hurry along. These gentlemen\r\nmust get back to Boston to-day, you know."\r\n\r\nMr. Munger bustled ahead, conducting his visitors across a bridge and\r\ninto the next mill.\r\n\r\nHere was the carding room. Layers of wool entered the carding engine and\r\nwere combed by a multitude of wire teeth until all the fibers lay\r\nparallel; the thin film of wool then passed into a cone-like opening and\r\ncame out later in a thick strand of untwisted fibers.\r\n\r\n"It is now ready to go to the drawing-frames," Mr. Munger explained.\r\n"You will notice how these drawing-frames pull the wool into shape for\r\ntwisting and spinning, drawing it out to uniform size and finally\r\nwinding it on bobbins. The machine is a complicated one to explain, but\r\nyou can watch and see what it does."\r\n\r\n"How wonderful it is that machinery can do all this work," Mr. Clark\r\nobserved thoughtfully.\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is," Mr. Munger agreed. "Years ago every part of the process\r\nwas done by hand. Little by little, however, machines have been\r\nperfected until now we have contrivances that seem almost human. Shall\r\nwe go now and see the yarn spun?"\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the spinning room with its clatter of shifting bobbins\r\nMr. Munger turned to Donald.\r\n\r\n"I wonder if you know," he said, "that wool is worked into two different\r\nkinds of yarn--worsted yarn and woolen yarn. The fibers for worsted yarn\r\nare long and lie nearly parallel, and when woven result in a smooth\r\nsurface. Broadcloth is made from worsted yarn. Woolen yarn, on the\r\nother hand, has its fibers lying in every direction and all these loose\r\nends, when woven, give a rough surface. Of course after the cloth is\r\nmilled it comes out smooth, but it is not as smooth and fine as a\r\nworsted cloth."\r\n\r\n"I think I understand," Donald said. "Are we to see the cloth woven\r\nnext?"\r\n\r\n"Yes. You know we weave nothing but woolens; you must go to a worsted\r\nmill to see the other kinds of cloth made. The processes, though, are\r\nmuch alike."\r\n\r\nMr. Munger then hurried the party to the weaving mills, where amid an\r\nuproar of thousands of moving wheels, bobbins, and shuttles the threads\r\nof yarn traveled back and forth, back and forth, and came out of the\r\nlooms as cloth. The cloth was then steamed, pressed, and rolled or\r\nfolded.\r\n\r\n"And now, young man," announced Mr. Munger to Donald jestingly, "you\r\nhave seen the whole process, and there is no reason why your father\r\nshould not give you some wool and let you make your own cloth for your\r\nnext suit of clothes."\r\n\r\nAlthough Donald was very tired he tried to smile.\r\n\r\n"I think," he said, "that I would rather grow the wool on the ranch than\r\nmake it into cloth here. It is far nicer out on the ranges."\r\n\r\n"That is what I am trying to tell my young assistant," agreed Mr.\r\nMunger. "He is getting fagged, aren\'t you, Mac? You see he was brought\r\nup in the open country, and much as we think of him, we feel that he\r\nshould go back to the Western mountains."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I am all right, Mr. Munger," the bookkeeper hastened to say. "Just\r\na bit tired, perhaps--that is all."\r\n\r\n"If you are tired you should try the ranges of Idaho," Mr. Clark said.\r\n"My boy, here, and myself have recently returned from a year in the\r\nsheep country and feel like new men, don\'t we, Don? Undoubtedly the life\r\nthere may not be as gay as in the city; still--to quote my manager,\r\nSandy McCulloch, \'with bears, bob-cats, and coyotes, I dinna see how it\r\ncould ever be dull.\'"\r\n\r\nSo perfectly had Mr. Clark imitated Sandy\'s voice and accent that\r\nThornton and Donald both laughed. Then they stopped suddenly.\r\n\r\nThe young bookkeeper had turned very pale and was eying them with a\r\nstartled face.\r\n\r\n"Sandy McCulloch!" he repeated. "Did you say Sandy McCulloch, sir?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, Sandy McCulloch," answered Mr. Clark. "Do you know him?"\r\n\r\n"He must be of your kin, Mac!" interrupted Mr. Munger. "This lad,\r\nstrangely enough, is a McCulloch himself--Douglas McCulloch."\r\n\r\n"Then you must be--you are Sandy\'s brother!" cried Donald.\r\n\r\nThe young man swayed a little and put out his hand to steady himself.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Donald as if he would never speak.\r\n\r\nWhen he did his voice was tremulous with emotion.\r\n\r\n"Yes," he replied almost in a whisper. "I am Sandy\'s brother. Tell me of\r\nSandy and of my father."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nDONALD DECIDES\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a wonderful story, Donald thought.\r\n\r\nHe was never tired of living over how, in visiting the Mortonstown\r\nmills, they had so unexpectedly found Douglas McCulloch; how, because of\r\nill health, he was on the point of going West; and how, with Mr.\r\nMunger\'s permission, Mr. Clark had offered him the position as Sandy\'s\r\nassistant at Crescent Ranch. It was little short of a miracle that it\r\nhad all come about!\r\n\r\nIt was interesting, too, to hear what had happened to Douglas after he\r\nleft Idaho. When he first reached the East it was indeed a rude\r\nawakening from his dreams of city life; living was expensive, and work\r\nhard to find. Chance had borne him to the Monitor Mills where, because\r\nof his knowledge of wool, he had succeeded in getting a job at sorting\r\nfleeces. He had worked hard and patiently, and Mr. Bailey, who was quick\r\nto appreciate faithfulness, had promoted him until he had won the\r\nposition of head bookkeeper. These years of vigorous work had, however,\r\nleft their mark on one unaccustomed to long hours and little fresh air.\r\nIn his heart the boy sighed for the hills--he wanted to be back again in\r\nthe Western country which he so foolishly had insisted upon leaving. He\r\nbecame tired and thin, and the men for whom he worked were unselfish\r\nenough to see that unless he got back to the open ranges and to the\r\nsunlight he would soon be too ill to go.\r\n\r\nAnd now the chance had come--it was almost unbelievable!\r\n\r\n"I cannot realize that I am really to join Sandy," exclaimed the\r\nScotchman over and over. "It is almost too much good luck. As a lad I\r\nwas so eager to get away from the range that I would never have dreamed\r\nthe time could come when I would be pining to return there. I have had\r\nmy taste of the East! I would have gone back long ago had they not been\r\nso good to me here."\r\n\r\n"But why didn\'t you write to Sandy, Douglas?" inquired Donald.\r\n\r\n"Well, you see, although my father let me leave Crescent Ranch it\r\ndisappointed him not a little to have me do so. Sandy thought, since my\r\nfather felt that way, that I ought not to go, and we had words about it.\r\nI was very angry with Sandy at the time, but I see now that he was\r\nright. I wish I had stayed with my father. Then when I began to be\r\nhomesick here and it all turned out just as Sandy had said I was ashamed\r\nto write. Even now I am almost afraid Sandy will not want to see me."\r\n\r\n"Indeed he will!" cried Donald. "Why, often he talked about you when we\r\nwere on the range together, and wished he might see you. My father has\r\nwired him already and he can hardly wait to get you back to Idaho."\r\n\r\n"If only my father were there!" said Douglas sadly. "I shall never\r\nforgive myself that I came East and left him. I wish I had the chance to\r\nlive over again and I would do differently."\r\n\r\n"If we did not learn wisdom by what we do there would be no use in\r\nliving, Douglas," Mr. Clark put in kindly. "At least you are going West\r\nto Sandy--going to be a great help to him in his work."\r\n\r\n"I am so thankful that I can," replied the younger brother. "Think of\r\ngoing once more to Idaho and running that great ranch with him! It is\r\nmore than I deserve."\r\n\r\n"Make the most of your good fortune, Douglas," Mr. Clark said, "and do\r\nnot disappoint Sandy and me."\r\n\r\n"I will try, sir!" was the humble response.\r\n\r\nDouglas McCulloch was as good as his word.\r\n\r\nFrom the moment he and Sandy were united at Crescent Ranch he threw\r\nhimself heart and soul into his new work. The charm of the hills stole\r\nover him with a fascination they had never held in those far-off days\r\nwhen he was a restless boy, eager for the excitement of city life.\r\nDouglas had had his fling, and he returned to the vast Western land\r\nolder and wiser.\r\n\r\nTogether he and Sandy set about improving the ranch. They subscribed to\r\nmagazines on sheep-raising; they visited other ranches and kept abreast\r\nof the times; they installed newer and more hygienic methods of\r\nwool-growing. Never had Crescent Ranch been so perfectly run. With two\r\nintelligent and unwearying young men at its head it bid fair to outshine\r\nthe fame it had possessed in Old Angus\'s day. Gradually men interested\r\nin sheeping came from far and near to visit it. Clark & Sons began to be\r\nvery proud to be the owners of such a treasure.\r\n\r\nThornton, in the meantime, had become Mr. Clark\'s right hand man at the\r\nEastern office. From foreman he had worked up to being superintendent,\r\nand had then been promoted to traveling for the firm and selling wool.\r\nHis devotion to Mr. Clark and everything that concerned him was\r\nunfailing.\r\n\r\nDuring these years Donald had completed his school work; had taken his\r\nfour years at college; and loyal to his early ambition, had entered the\r\nLaw School. If it was a disappointment to his father for him to choose\r\nthe law instead of a business career Mr. Clark did not say so. He kept\r\nclosely in touch with the boy\'s studies and was proud of the future\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\nIt was just as everything seemed to be moving so ideally that the first\r\ngreat calamity fell upon Clark & Sons. One morning a telegram came from\r\nSandy saying that a big fire had swept the ranch, leveling to the ground\r\nhouse, barns, and sheep-pens. The blaze had come about through no one\'s\r\ncarelessness. Lightning had struck the central barn, and before aid\r\ncould be summoned the entire place had been destroyed.\r\n\r\nFortunately no one had been injured. The herders, together with their\r\nflocks, were on the range; and the crops of alfalfa had not been cut and\r\nwere therefore saved.\r\n\r\n"It might have been much worse, Don," said Mr. Clark in reviewing the\r\nsituation. "We have lost no men, no sheep, no hay, no wool. Suppose the\r\nfire had come in shearing time and had destroyed all the fleeces; or\r\nsuppose the blaze had come about through carelessness and Sandy and\r\nDouglas had had themselves to blame for it. As it is, it is nobody\'s\r\nfault--I am glad of that--and nothing has been lost but can be restored.\r\nThe buildings are well covered by insurance and can be rebuilt during\r\nthe summer. The chief trouble is that all this has happened at a time\r\nwhen I am very busy. I ought to go to Idaho, but I hardly see----"\r\n\r\n"Can\'t I go, father?" interrupted Donald quickly. "I don\'t see why I\r\ncouldn\'t adjust the insurance and help about having new buildings put\r\nup. Sandy and Douglas have good judgment, and before I started you could\r\ntell me just what you want done. Besides," he added shyly, "I am now\r\nthrough my first year at the Law School and have some little knowledge\r\nof legal affairs--that is, I know more than I used to."\r\n\r\nMr. Clark beamed.\r\n\r\n"You could go in my place perfectly well, Don, if you are willing to\r\ngive up your summer vacation to it. It would certainly be a great help.\r\nBut how about those house-parties you had planned for?"\r\n\r\n"I can decline those, father. I\'d be glad to go!" was Donald\'s reply. "I\r\nalways promised Sandy I would come West again some time, and I should\r\nreally enjoy another glimpse of the hills."\r\n\r\nSo it was arranged.\r\n\r\nWithin two days Donald was speeding West, and almost before he realized\r\nit he was back at Crescent Ranch.\r\n\r\nThen came letters for Mr. Clark.\r\n\r\nThe insurance was adjusted and with the aid of the McCullochs, Donald\r\nwas drawing up plans for new barns--barns with cement floors, and far\r\nbetter ventilated and equipped than the old ones had been. Almost every\r\nday brought to the Eastern office pages and pages of sketches for\r\nsheep-folds and modern contrivances for lessening the labor of\r\nwool-growing. Every line of these letters bubbled with enthusiasm. There\r\ncould be no possible question that Donald\'s heart was in every word he\r\nwrote.\r\n\r\nSummer passed and the time for the beginning of the college term drew\r\nnear.\r\n\r\nMr. Clark began to look for the boy\'s return.\r\n\r\nStill there was no Donald!\r\n\r\nThen came another letter:\r\n\r\n                 _Crescent Ranch, Glen City, Idaho._\r\n\r\n    DEAR FATHER:\r\n\r\n    You have been so generous in letting me follow out my own wishes as\r\n    to my future, that I hardly know how to write you. I hope you will\r\n    not be disappointed when you hear what I am going to say. The fact\r\n    is, dad, after thinking the matter well over I have changed my mind\r\n    about studying law. I have become tremendously interested in\r\n    Crescent Ranch and in wool-growing, and I am wild to jump into the\r\n    work.\r\n\r\n    If I thought you approved I should like to stay out here and see the\r\n    buildings finished and then go to Kansas City with Sandy to select\r\n    more sheep. If, however, you wish me to continue my law course I am\r\n    perfectly willing to come East and take my degree.\r\n\r\n    Please wire.\r\n\r\n    Affectionately your son,\r\n                  DONALD CLARK.\r\n\r\nDonald\'s father read the letter twice. Then he called his stenographer.\r\n\r\n"Lawson," he said briskly, "I want to dictate a telegram and have you\r\nget it off right away. Here is the message:\r\n\r\n    "_Mr. Donald Clark,\r\n        Crescent Ranch, Glen City, Idaho._\r\n\r\n    "Cut out the law. Take up sheeping. Three cheers for you!\r\n\r\n    "(Signed) WILLARD PAYSON CLARK.\r\n\r\n"Now repeat the message."\r\n\r\nThe stenographer did so.\r\n\r\nMr. Clark chuckled aloud.\r\n\r\n"That is O. K., Lawson. Send it along as soon as possible. Oh, and\r\nLawson--here is a gold-piece which goes with that telegram. Keep it in\r\nmemory of this day, for it is the happiest one of my life. Mr. Donald is\r\ncoming into Clark & Sons!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Story of Wool, by Sara Ware Bassett\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE STORY OF WOOL ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 24858-8.txt or 24858-8.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/2/4/8/5/24858/\r\n\r\nProduced by La Monte H.P.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
