His real name was Richard Snow.\r\n\r\nBut his mother always called him "Little Boy Blue."\r\n\r\nHis father called him "Boy Blue," too.\r\n\r\nEvery one called him "Little Boy Blue," and so I will.\r\n\r\nBoy Blue\'s eyes were as blue as the sky on a summer day.\r\n\r\nWhen he was a baby he always wore a blue ribbon in his hair.\r\n\r\nWhen he was five years old he wore a blue blouse and a blue cap.\r\n\r\nNow he wears a blue suit and a blue tie.\r\n\r\nFor Boy Blue is seven years old now, and is a big boy, you see.\r\n\r\nBoy Blue lives on a large farm in the country.\r\n\r\nThere are horses, and cows, and sheep, and pigs, and ducks, and hens\r\nand chickens on the farm.\r\n\r\nOf course, Boy Blue likes the cows and sheep best.\r\n\r\nHe likes to drive the cows to the pasture in the morning.\r\n\r\nSometimes, at night, he drives them home again.\r\n\r\nHe likes to watch his father milk the cows and feed them.\r\n\r\n"When I am a big boy," he says, "I shall milk my own cow every day."\r\n\r\nSometimes he goes with the boy to watch the sheep.\r\n\r\nShep, the dog, always goes with them. He watches the sheep all day\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nThey like to get into the meadow where the grass is green and sweet.\r\n\r\nBut Shep drives them out every time.\r\n\r\nBoy Blue and Shep play together in the fields. They run and jump and\r\nchase each other.\r\n\r\nBoy Blue hides, and Shep finds him. "Bow-wow!" Shep says. "Here you\r\nare! Now for a frolic."\r\n\r\nAnd off they go again.\r\n\r\nBoy Blue likes to feed the chickens.\r\n\r\nHe likes to drive the ducks down to the brook and watch them swim about\r\nin the water.\r\n\r\nSometimes he helps his mother take care of Little Sister.\r\n\r\nThen she calls him her "Little Helper."\r\n\r\n"No," he says, "I am your Big Boy Blue."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSNOWBALL\r\n\r\n\r\nOne morning Boy Blue had tears in his big blue eyes.\r\n\r\nHe could not find his Snowball.\r\n\r\nYou will laugh when I tell you who Snowball was.\r\n\r\nShe was not hard and cold.\r\n\r\nShe was soft and warm.\r\n\r\nSnowball was a pretty, white hen.\r\n\r\nShe was Boy Blue\'s very own, and she would follow him all over the\r\nyard.\r\n\r\nShe would eat grain from his hand, and let him smooth her white\r\nfeathers.\r\n\r\nBut now Boy Blue could not find her.\r\n\r\nHe had looked in the hen-house and all over the yard.\r\n\r\n"Have you looked in the barn?" asked his mother.\r\n\r\n"Oh, no!" said Boy Blue, "and I saw her coming out of the barn\r\nyesterday."\r\n\r\n"So did I," said his mother. "I think you will find her in the hay."\r\n\r\nBoy Blue climbed up on the hay.\r\n\r\nThere in a corner he found his Snowball.\r\n\r\nWhen she saw her little friend, she began to scold.\r\n\r\n"Why, Snowball, what are you doing here?" said Boy Blue.\r\n\r\n"Cluck, cluck," said Snowball. "Do not come too near."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"I have some eggs in this nice warm nest.\r\n\r\n"Soon I shall have some little chickens for you.\r\n\r\n"Oh, oh!" cried Boy Blue, "I must tell Mamma."\r\n\r\n"You must feed Snowball," said his mother.\r\n\r\n"Give her some corn and a drink of water."\r\n\r\nBoy Blue took very good care of his pretty, white Snowball.\r\n\r\nHe gave her corn and fresh water every morning.\r\n\r\nThree weeks seemed to him a long time to wait.\r\n\r\nBut Snowball did not seem to think so.\r\n\r\nOne morning Boy Blue went out to feed her, and she would not leave her\r\nnest.\r\n\r\n"Cluck, cluck!" said she, "I can hear my little chickens."\r\n\r\nBoy Blue kept very still and listened.\r\n\r\n"Peep, peep, peep," he heard.\r\n\r\n"Yes, Snowball," he said, "I can hear your chickens, too."\r\n\r\nAll day he was busy helping John build a chicken house.\r\n\r\nThey built the house in the field near the barn.\r\n\r\n"I know Snowball will like this house," said Boy Blue.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Snowball let him see her chickens.\r\n\r\n"Cluck, clack, cluck!" she said.\r\n\r\n"Oh, how pretty they are!" said Boy Blue.\r\n\r\n"One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.\r\n\r\n"You have seven dear little snowballs."\r\n\r\nSnowball was proud of her babies,\r\n\r\nBoy Blue put them in his hat.\r\n\r\nThey were too little to walk.\r\n\r\n"Come, Snowball," he said, "I have a new house for you."\r\n\r\n"Cluck, cluck! This is a good house," she said.\r\n\r\nSnowball and her seven little balls were very happy.\r\n\r\nBoy Blue took good care of them, and they grew fast.\r\n\r\nWhen the summer was over, he had eight big white snowballs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRE-CRACKER\r\n\r\n\r\nFourth of July! Fourth of July!\r\n\r\nThis is the best day for boys in all the year.\r\n\r\nBoy Blue liked the Fourth of July.\r\n\r\nHe liked fire-crackers and torpedoes and fire-balloons.\r\n\r\nHe liked everything that made a noise.\r\n\r\nThis was the Fourth of July, but poor little Boy Blue had no\r\nfire-crackers.\r\n\r\nHe could not even blow his horn.\r\n\r\nLittle Sister was sick, and Mamma had said he must be very quiet.\r\n\r\nIt did not seem one bit like the Fourth of July.\r\n\r\nHe was sitting on the steps, whistling and trying not to care.\r\n\r\n"Boy Blue," called his father, "I have something to show you out here."\r\n\r\nThe little boy jumped up and ran to the barn as fast as he could.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he was going to have some fire-works after all!\r\n\r\nHe ran into the barn, and what do you think he saw?\r\n\r\nThere stood a little pony.\r\n\r\nHe had a glossy brown coat and a white star on his forehead.\r\n\r\n"Oh! oh!" cried Boy Blue. "Is this pony for me?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, my boy, it is for your very own."\r\n\r\n"What a beautiful pony! What is his name, Papa?"\r\n\r\n"I do not know his name."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"You must name him yourself."\r\n\r\n"\'Star\' would be a good name,--or I might call him \'Brownie.\'\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know a good name! I shall call him \'Fire-cracker.\'"\r\n\r\n"This is the Fourth of July, you know, and I did want some\r\nfire-crackers so much!"\r\n\r\nFire-cracker was a good little pony.\r\n\r\nHe and his master soon became very fond of each other.\r\n\r\nBoy Blue learned to ride on his pony\'s back, and he took long rides\r\nwith his father.\r\n\r\nOne day he said, "I wish I had a pony cart, then I could take Little\r\nSister to ride.\r\n\r\n"Fire-cracker is very strong. I am sure he could draw both of us, if we\r\ndid not go very fast."\r\n\r\nPapa thought that was a good idea.\r\n\r\nThe next day he took Boy Blue to town to buy a pony cart.\r\n\r\nThey went to two or three stores but they could not find one small\r\nenough for Fire-cracker to draw.\r\n\r\nAt last Boy Blue saw one in a window.\r\n\r\nIt was painted blue and had red wheels.\r\n\r\nIt had a seat just big enough for Boy Blue and Little Sister.\r\n\r\nSo Papa and Boy Blue went into the store and bought it.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Boy Blue took Little Sister for a ride.\r\n\r\nFire-cracker was very careful.\r\n\r\nHe walked slowly and looked around very often to see the two children.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he was thinking, "How fine we all look this morning!\r\n\r\n"That is a very pretty carriage, and I like this harness, too.\r\n\r\n"My coat shines in the sun and Boy Blue put a red ribbon in my mane.\r\n\r\n"How proud he looks, holding the reins!\r\n\r\n"I think he likes to take Little Sister for a ride.\r\n\r\n"I like to see them both so happy.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, I am going to trot fast now."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOY BLUE\'S DREAM\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was a very hot day.\r\n\r\nBoy Blue had played all the morning and he was tired.\r\n\r\nLittle Sister had been making mud pies and she was tired, too.\r\n\r\nMamma was too busy to read to them.\r\n\r\n"Come, Little Sister," said Boy Blue, "It is too hot to play. I will\r\nread my story-book to you."\r\n\r\n"Where shall we go?" asked the little girl.\r\n\r\n"Let us sit under the maple tree," said her brother. "It looks cool\r\nthere."\r\n\r\nLittle Sister had her baby doll.\r\n\r\nShe rocked back and forth as Boy Blue read to her.\r\n\r\nSoon Little Sister and her doll were fast asleep.\r\n\r\nAll at once Boy Blue heard a voice.\r\n\r\nHe listened. It seemed to be saying:--\r\n\r\n "Little Boy Blue, come blow your horn,\r\n  The sheep\'s in the meadow,\r\n  The cow\'s in the corn."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"Oh," thought the little boy, "I must hurry!"\r\n\r\nHe looked for his horn. There it lay in the grass.\r\n\r\nBut he was so sleepy,--he couldn\'t run after the sheep.\r\n\r\nIn a moment he fell asleep.\r\n\r\nThen he heard the voice again:--\r\n\r\n  "Little Boy Blue, come blow your horn,\r\n    The sheep\'s in the meadow,\r\n    The cow\'s in the corn."\r\n\r\nYes, he could see the cow eating the corn in the field.\r\n\r\nAnd there was the sheep in the meadow, eating the fresh green grass.\r\n\r\nHe must call them away.\r\n\r\nSo he took up the horn and put it to his mouth.\r\n\r\nThen he blew one loud call.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" he said, as he opened his eyes, "What a loud noise that was!"\r\n\r\nThen he laughed and rubbed his eyes.\r\n\r\n"I guess I was dreaming," he said.\r\n\r\n"I guess I was dreaming, too," said Little Sister, opening her blue\r\neyes.\r\n\r\nThen she waked up her doll, and Boy Blue went on reading from his\r\nstory-book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Mary had a little lamb,\r\n    Its fleece was white as snow,\r\n  And everywhere that Mary went\r\n    The lamb was sure to go.\r\n\r\n  He followed her to school one day,\r\n    Which was against the rule.\r\n  It made the children laugh and play\r\n    To see a lamb at school.\r\n\r\n  And so the teacher put him out,\r\n    But still he lingered near,\r\n  And waited patiently about\r\n    Till Mary did appear.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARY\'S LAMB\r\n\r\n\r\nOf course you know all about Mary and her little lamb.\r\n\r\nThe little girl in this story was named Mary, and she had a little\r\nlamb, too.\r\n\r\nMary was Boy Blue\'s cousin.\r\n\r\nShe lived in the city, and her father owned a big toy-store.\r\n\r\nMary liked to go to the store with him.\r\n\r\nShe liked to see all the dolls and toys and books.\r\n\r\nSometimes she played store with her own toys.\r\n\r\nBut I must tell you about her lamb.\r\n\r\nOne summer Mary went to the country to visit Boy Blue.\r\n\r\nOf course there were cows, and pigs, and sheep, and lambs on the farm,\r\n\r\nMary liked the lambs best, and one of them was a great pet.\r\n\r\nShe called him Fleecy, and pulled sweet clover for him to eat.\r\n\r\nFleecy followed Mary all over the farm. Sometimes he even ran down the\r\nroad after her.\r\n\r\nWhen Mary was going home her uncle said to her, "You may take Fleecy\r\nwith you, if you wish."\r\n\r\nSo the next day Fleecy had a long ride in the train.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nI don\'t think he liked it very well, but he didn\'t say a word.\r\n\r\nWhen Mary took him out of the box he was glad to run about in the yard.\r\n\r\nHe soon became used to his new home.\r\n\r\nHe liked to play with the children.\r\n\r\nThey often played hide and seek.\r\n\r\nWhen they hid behind the trees he could always find them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LAMB AT SCHOOL\r\n\r\n\r\nOne morning Fleecy could not find Mary.\r\n\r\nHe looked everywhere for her.\r\n\r\nShe was not in the yard, and she was not in the barn.\r\n\r\nHe went to the gate, and looked down the street, but he could not see\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThen he went to the back door, and called, "Baa-a, Baa-a!" but she did\r\nnot come.\r\n\r\nWhere could she be?\r\n\r\nAfter a long time she came running into the yard.\r\n\r\nFleecy trotted up to her.\r\n\r\n"Baa-a, Baa-a!" he said; which meant, I think, "Where have you been,\r\nMary?"\r\n\r\n"I have been to school," said Mary.\r\n\r\nYou see she knew what he meant.\r\n\r\n"To school," thought Fleecy. "I wonder what that is."\r\n\r\nEveryday Mary went away and left him.\r\n\r\nDid I say every day?\r\n\r\nOnce in a while she stayed at home.\r\n\r\nThen Mary and the lamb played together in the yard.\r\n\r\n"Now," thought Fleecy, "she is going to stay at home with me."\r\n\r\nBut no, on Monday Mary went away again.\r\n\r\nAt last Fleecy could bear it no longer.\r\n\r\n"I must go to school, too," he said.\r\n\r\n"I must see what Mary does all day.\r\n\r\n"If she goes to school to play games, I can play with her."\r\n\r\nThe next day Fleecy watched Mary go through the gate.\r\n\r\nThen he followed her very quietly.\r\n\r\nMary ran along with the other little girls and boys.\r\n\r\nThey were playing tag and they did not see Fleecy.\r\n\r\nSoon he heard a bell ring.\r\n\r\nThen how the children ran!\r\n\r\nThey all ran into a little house and shut the door.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" thought Fleecy, "What shall I do? I can never open that door."\r\n\r\nJust then he saw a little boy running very fast.\r\n\r\nThe boy ran up to the same little house.\r\n\r\nHe opened the door and went in, but he did not shut it.\r\n\r\nFleecy climbed up the steps.\r\n\r\nHe put his head in at the door and looked around.\r\n\r\nHe could see no one, so he walked in.\r\n\r\nThere was another door, and that was open, too.\r\n\r\nFleecy stood still and listened.\r\n\r\nThe children were singing as if they were very happy.\r\n\r\nThen he put his head against the door and pushed it wide open.\r\n\r\nWhat a room-full of children he saw!\r\n\r\nAnd they were all sitting very still, and not playing at all.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I shall like school," thought Fleecy.\r\n\r\nJust then the children saw him.\r\n\r\nHow they did laugh to see a lamb at school!\r\n\r\nThe moment Fleecy saw Mary he ran up to her.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe children laughed and laughed.\r\n\r\nThe teacher laughed, too.\r\n\r\nOf course the lamb could not stay in school all the morning.\r\n\r\nThe children could not work because they liked to watch him.\r\n\r\nSo Mary put him out and shut the door.\r\n\r\nBut Fleecy nibbled some sweet clover and waited for Mary.\r\n\r\nWhen the children came out he trotted home with them.\r\n\r\nAfter that day Fleecy often went to school with the children.\r\n\r\nBut he never went in again.\r\n\r\nI think he liked clover better than books.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Little Bo-peep has lost her sheep,\r\n    And can\'t tell where to find them;\r\n  Leave them alone, and they\'ll come home,\r\n    And bring their tails behind them.\r\n\r\n  Little Bo-peep fell fast asleep,\r\n    And dreamed she heard them bleating;\r\n  But when she awoke she found it a joke,\r\n    For they were still a-fleeting.\r\n\r\n  Then up she took her little crook,\r\n    Determined for to find them;\r\n  She found them, indeed, but it made her heart bleed,\r\n    For they\'d left their tails behind them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLITTLE BO-PEEP\r\n\r\n\r\nAlice is seven years old to-day.\r\n\r\nShe is going to have a birthday party.\r\n\r\nAlice\'s aunt wrote the invitations, and Alice gave them to all her\r\nlittle school friends.\r\n\r\nThe invitation said:--\r\n\r\n"Little Bo-peep is to have a birthday party. She would like to have you\r\ncome and help her take care of her sheep. Please come Friday afternoon\r\nafter school."\r\n\r\nOf course the children asked Alice about her party.\r\n\r\n"Are you little Bo-peep?" they said.\r\n\r\n"Have you lost your sheep?\r\n\r\n"Are we going to help you find them?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Alice, "But my sheep have lost their tails, I think.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll know all about it on Friday."\r\n\r\nAt last it was Friday afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe children came to school all dressed for the party.\r\n\r\nIt was very hard to wait.\r\n\r\nHow slowly the clock ticked!\r\n\r\nTwo o\'clock! Three o\'clock! Four o\'clock, at last!\r\n\r\nThe children ran almost all the way to Alice\'s house.\r\n\r\nWhen they were all ready Alice put on a tall cap.\r\n\r\nThen she took a long crook and stood in the middle of the floor.\r\n\r\nAs she called the names of the children they stood in a line behind\r\nher.\r\n\r\nThen they began to march and sing:\r\n\r\n "Little Bo-peep has lost her sheep,\r\n    And can\'t tell where to find them;\r\n  Let them alone, and they\'ll come home,\r\n    And bring their tails behind them."\r\n\r\nThe children marched around the room, and through the hall into the\r\ndining-room.\r\n\r\nThere they saw a big green curtain, and there they found the sheep.\r\n\r\n"She found them, indeed, but it made her heart bleed,\r\nFor they\'d left their tails behind them."\r\n\r\nSure enough! There was a sheep on the curtain, but it had no tail.\r\n\r\nThere were some tails in a box on the table.\r\n\r\nBo-peep\'s mother gave one of them to each of the children.\r\n\r\n"Now," said Bo-peep, "I will try first to pin a tail on the sheep."\r\n\r\nSo her mother tied a handkerchief over her eyes, turned her around\r\nthree times, and said, "Go."\r\n\r\nBo-peep started off bravely, and pinned the tail to her mother\'s apron!\r\n\r\nHow the children laughed! and Bo-peep laughed too, when she saw what\r\nshe had done.\r\n\r\nBoy Blue was sure he could pin a tail on the sheep.\r\n\r\nBut he pinned it right on the corner of the table cloth.\r\n\r\nThen it was Mary\'s turn. She shut her eyes tight and walked very\r\nstraight.\r\n\r\nShe was going to pin the tail in just the right place.\r\n\r\nAll the children stood still and watched her cross the room.\r\n\r\nShe pinned on the tail, and how they all shouted!\r\n\r\nShe had put it into the sheep\'s mouth.\r\n\r\nBut she did better than any one else.\r\n\r\nSo Bo-peep\'s mother gave her a little woolly lamb to take home to her\r\nbaby brother.\r\n\r\nAll the children had a good time at the party.\r\n\r\nThey played games and ate ice-cream and cake and candy.\r\n\r\nThen they sang songs, and Alice\'s mother told them some stories.\r\n\r\nLast of all they sang "Little Bo-peep" again.\r\n\r\nAnd to this day they call Alice "Little\r\nBo-peep."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "All the children had a good time at the party."]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Hickory, dickory, dock!\r\n  The mouse ran up the clock.\r\n    The clock struck one\r\n    And down he run.\r\n  Hickory, dickory, dock!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHICKORY, DICKORY, DOCK\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was very quiet all over the house.\r\n\r\nLittle Boy Blue was fast asleep, dreaming of Santa Claus.\r\n\r\nBoy Blue\'s father and mother were asleep, too, but I don\'t know what\r\nthey were dreaming about.\r\n\r\n"Not a creature was stirring, not even a mouse."\r\n\r\nHark! Was that a mouse? Yes, I think it was.\r\n\r\nSome one was awake after all.\r\n\r\nMr. and Mrs. Mouse lived in a hole in the pantry wall.\r\n\r\nThey were talking quite loud now.\r\n\r\n"Yes, we must move right away," Mrs. Mouse was saying.\r\n\r\n"This nest is not large enough for six."\r\n\r\n"That is true," said Mr. Mouse. "I can\'t get my tail in now, and when\r\nthe babies grow, it will be still worse."\r\n\r\n"But where shall we go?" said Mrs. Mouse.\r\n\r\n"I will go house-hunting this very night, my dear."\r\n\r\n"Be sure you find a large house, where the cat can\'t find us."\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed!" said Mr. Mouse. Then he whisked through a little hole\r\nand went away.\r\n\r\n"Be careful, dear," called Mrs. Mouse, and she peeped through the hole\r\nand watched him out of sight.\r\n\r\nMr. Mouse ran across the kitchen floor into the dining-room.\r\n\r\nIt was very still!\r\n\r\nThen he ran into the hall.\r\n\r\n"This is too far from the kitchen," he thought.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid the babies would have to go to bed hungry in here."\r\n\r\nThen he went back into the dining-room.\r\n\r\n"This would be a good place for us," he thought.\r\n\r\nHe looked all around the room.\r\n\r\nWhere could he find a home?\r\n\r\nIt must be high up out of the reach of Pussy Cat, and big enough for\r\nMrs. Mouse and her four babies.\r\n\r\nWhat was that in the corner?\r\n\r\nIt was like a box, only very, very tall.\r\n\r\nMr. Mouse certainly did not know what it was, but I will tell you.\r\n\r\nIt was Boy Blue\'s grandfather\'s clock.\r\n\r\nIt had stood in that corner a long, long time, but Mr. Mouse had never\r\nseen it before.\r\n\r\n"I think I could make a good nest on top of that box," he thought.\r\n\r\n"Pussy Cat could not get up there, I know."\r\n\r\nSo Mr. Mouse began to run up the clock.\r\n\r\nHe heard it ticking very loudly.\r\n\r\n"Tick-tock! Tick-tock!" it was saying.\r\n\r\n"I wonder what that noise is," he said to himself.\r\n\r\n"I hope it doesn\'t make that noise in the day-time.\r\n\r\n"It might keep the babies awake."\r\n\r\nHe climbed a little higher, looking this way and that.\r\n\r\n"I think Mrs. Mouse will like this," he thought.\r\n\r\nJust then the clock struck one.\r\n\r\nHow Mr. Mouse trembled!\r\n\r\nHe nearly fell off the clock, he was so frightened.\r\n\r\nHe took one jump down to the floor, and then he ran.\r\n\r\nOh, how he ran! Across the dining-room, across the kitchen, across the\r\npantry, and into his hole he ran!\r\n\r\n"Oh, my dear, my dear! what is the matter?" cried his wife. "Did you\r\nsee the dog? Was the cat chasing you?"\r\n\r\n"No, no!" panted Mr. Mouse.\r\n\r\n"I was hunting for a house, and I climbed up on a tall box.\r\n\r\n"Just as I had found the very place for us, there was an awful noise\r\ninside the box."\r\n\r\n"That was a clock, my dear," said his wife.\r\n\r\n"It tells Boy Blue\'s mother when to have dinner, and when to put the\r\nbaby to bed.\r\n\r\n"I have heard her telling Boy Blue about it."\r\n\r\n"I think it was telling me it was time to go home," said Mr. Mouse, and\r\nthey both laughed softly so as not to wake up the babies.\r\n\r\nThe next night Mr. Mouse went house hunting in the barn.\r\n\r\nThere he found a very good home in a box of grain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Mistress Mary, quite contrary,\r\n    How does your garden grow?\r\n  With silver bells, and cockle shells,\r\n    And pretty maids all in a row.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMISTRESS MARY\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time there was a little girl named Mary.\r\n\r\nShe had no brothers and sisters, but she had a dear, good father and\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nMary always went to school with her little friends.\r\n\r\nShe played with them after school and on Saturdays.\r\n\r\nOne Saturday in winter all the children went coasting down the long\r\nhill near the school-house.\r\n\r\nMary took her new red sled and went with them.\r\n\r\nOh, it was such fun to coast down that long hill!\r\n\r\nThe children ran and laughed and shouted all the way.\r\n\r\nThey had not been coasting long when Mary fell off her sled right into\r\na snow bank.\r\n\r\nThat was fun, too, and Mary didn\'t care one bit.\r\n\r\nBut when she tried to stand up, it hurt her so it made tears come into\r\nher brown eyes.\r\n\r\n"Are you hurt very much?" asked Little Boy Blue.\r\n\r\n"My foot hurts," said Mary, trying not to cry.\r\n\r\n"We\'ll give you a ride home," said Jack Horner.\r\n\r\nSo Mary sat on her sled, and Boy Blue and Jack Horner played they were\r\nher horses.\r\n\r\nThey trotted so fast that Mary was soon at home and in her mother\'s\r\narms.\r\n\r\nWhen the doctor saw Mary\'s foot he shook his head.\r\n\r\n"This little girl has sprained her foot," he said.\r\n\r\n"She will have to stay in the house for some time."\r\n\r\nI am afraid Mary cried when the doctor said this.\r\n\r\nShe did not like to stay at home.\r\n\r\nShe wanted to go to school with all her playmates.\r\n\r\nShe wanted to go coasting and skating and play in the snow.\r\n\r\nIn a few days Mary could sit by the window and watch the children.\r\n\r\nThen she was not so lonely.\r\n\r\nJack brought home her school books and she studied very hard.\r\n\r\n"I want to keep up with my class, Mamma," she said.\r\n\r\nSo every day Mary and her mother played school together.\r\n\r\nEvery week Miss Brown came in to see how the little girl was getting\r\nalong.\r\n\r\nOf course the children went to see Mary very often.\r\n\r\nThey told her everything they had been doing in school.\r\n\r\nOne day Jack said, "I think it would be good fun to give Mary a\r\nsurprise party."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes," said Alice, "and we can all take something to make her\r\nhappy."\r\n\r\n"We can have the party next Saturday afternoon," said Jack.\r\n\r\n"I asked Mary\'s mother, and she said we could come at two o\'clock."\r\n\r\nAt recess the children told Miss Brown about the surprise party.\r\n\r\n"Why don\'t you take some plants to Mary?" she said.\r\n\r\n"Then she could have a garden to watch while she has to stay in the\r\nhouse."\r\n\r\n"Oh, that\'s just the thing for Mistress Mary," said Jack.\r\n\r\nAnd all the children began to sing:--\r\n\r\n "Mistress Mary quite contrary\r\n    How does your garden grow?\r\n  With silver bells, and cockle shells,\r\n    And pretty maids all in a row."\r\n\r\nSaturday afternoon Mary was playing with her dolls when the bell rang.\r\n\r\n"Alice has come to play with me," she thought.\r\n\r\nJust then the door opened and there stood twelve little boys and girls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nEach one was carrying a plant with a pretty, bright blossom.\r\n\r\nThey marched in singing "Mistress Mary," and little Mistress Mary\r\nlaughed, and cried, and clapped her hands, all in one minute.\r\n\r\nThen the children put the plants on a table near the window where Mary\r\ncould see them.\r\n\r\nThere were geraniums, and pinks; a sweet heliotrope, and a rose-bush\r\nwith a pink rose.\r\n\r\nAlice brought the heliotrope, and Jack brought the rose-bush.\r\n\r\nHow bright and cheerful the plants made the room look!\r\n\r\nThe children stayed an hour and played games with Mary.\r\n\r\nThey played "hide the thimble" and one or two guessing games, because\r\nMary could not run around the room with them.\r\n\r\nThen they had some little cakes and cookies which Mary\'s mother had\r\nmade for them.\r\n\r\nWhen it was time to go home they left a very happy little girl.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye," said Mary, "I hope you will come very often.\r\n\r\n"Thank you for the lovely plants. My table looks like a flower garden."\r\n\r\n"Yes, Mistress Mary," said Jack, "we\'ll come to see how your garden\r\ngrows. You ought to have some silver bells and some cockle shells."\r\n\r\nIn a few weeks Mistress Mary, as every one called her now, came back to\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nShe could run and play as well as any of the children.\r\n\r\nBut she did not forget her garden, and she often brought some of her\r\nflowers to school.\r\n\r\nWhen the spring came she made a garden out of doors for her plants.\r\n\r\nAnd what do you think she put all around the flower bed?\r\n\r\nShe put a splendid row of little white shells.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Little Tommy Tucker,\r\n    Sings for his supper.\r\n  What shall he eat?\r\n    White bread and butter.\r\n  How can he cut it without any knife?\r\n  How can he marry without any wife?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTOMMY TUCKER\r\n\r\n\r\nOne summer Mary went to make Grandma Hall a visit.\r\n\r\nGrandma\'s little girls were all grown up now, and Grandma and Grandpa\r\nlived alone on the farm.\r\n\r\nMary liked to go there to visit because Grandma could tell such\r\nsplendid stories, and there were always so many things to do.\r\n\r\nIt was Saturday and Mary had been busy all the morning helping Grandma\r\nmake cookies, and pies, and cakes.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner Grandma and little Mary took their sewing and sat out\r\nunder the old apple-tree in the garden.\r\n\r\nGrandma was making a cap, and Mary was making a white apron for her\r\nmother.\r\n\r\nThey had been sitting there only a little while when Mary saw a ragged\r\nboy coming down the road towards the house.\r\n\r\nRunning along close behind him was a ragged little dog.\r\n\r\nThe boy had a violin in his hand.\r\n\r\nWhen he saw the little girl and her grandmother he stood still and\r\nbegan to play.\r\n\r\nAs he played, the little dog stood up on his hind legs and tried to\r\nsing.\r\n\r\n"Bow--wow, wow!" he barked, and oh he did look so funny!\r\n\r\n"Please ask the boy to bring that funny dog over here, Grandma," said\r\nMary.\r\n\r\n"Come here, little boy," said Grandma. "What is your name?"\r\n\r\n"My name is Tommy," said the boy, "and this is my dog Rags."\r\n\r\n"Run and get Tommy and the dog some cookies, Mary," said Grandma, "I\r\nguess they are both hungry."\r\n\r\nTommy looked so tired that Mrs. Hall asked him to sit down and rest.\r\n\r\n"Where do you live?" she asked.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t live anywhere," replied Tommy, "I just have my dog Rags, and\r\nhe and I sleep wherever we can."\r\n\r\n"Well," said Grandma, "you must both stay here to-night. We can find a\r\nplace for a boy and a dog somewhere in this big house."\r\n\r\nI can\'t tell you how happy Tommy was.\r\n\r\nRags seemed happy, too.\r\n\r\nHe did all the tricks he knew, and for every trick he got a big, sweet\r\ncookie.\r\n\r\nAfter supper Tommy wanted to help, so he went out to the barn with\r\nGrandpa Hall.\r\n\r\nRags trotted along behind him, wagging his tail and barking at\r\neverything he saw.\r\n\r\n"What can you do, Tommy?" asked Grandpa.\r\n\r\n"I can play my violin and sing," said Tommy. "That is all I know how to\r\ndo."\r\n\r\n  "Little Tommy Tucker,\r\n  Sings for his supper.\r\n\r\n"I think we shall have to call you \'Tommy Tucker\'," said Grandpa.\r\n\r\nBut Tommy could do many things besides sing and play.\r\n\r\nHe helped Grandpa Hall feed the hens and chickens.\r\n\r\nHe gave them fresh water and found all the eggs.\r\n\r\nThen he brought in some wood for Grandma\'s fire.\r\n\r\nThere are a great many things for a boy to do on a farm.\r\n\r\nThat night, after the children had gone to bed, Grandpa said,\r\n\r\n"I wish Tommy could live here with us all the time.\r\n\r\n"I would like a good boy to help me."\r\n\r\n"That is a good idea," said Grandma.\r\n\r\n"It is lonely now that all our children are gone.\r\n\r\n"And Tommy is just the kind of a boy I like."\r\n\r\nSo the next morning Grandma asked Tommy if he would like to live with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"Could Rags stay here, too?" asked Tommy.\r\n\r\n"Of course he could," said Grandma.\r\n\r\n"You could help Grandpa in the summer, and in the winter you could go\r\nto school."\r\n\r\nWhat do you think Tommy did?\r\n\r\nHe couldn\'t say a word.\r\n\r\nHe threw his arms around Grandma\'s neck and kissed her.\r\n\r\n"Bow-wow," said Rags, jumping up beside them and barking as hard as he\r\ncould.\r\n\r\n"Bow-wow, this is a good home, Tommy."\r\n\r\nAnd Tommy thought so too.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  This little pig went to market,\r\n  This little pig stayed at home,\r\n  This little pig had bread and butter,\r\n  This little pig had none,\r\n  This little pig cried, "Wee, wee, wee!\r\n  I can\'t find my way home!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFIVE LITTLE PIGS\r\n\r\n\r\nTommy Tucker and Mary had been busy all day helping Grandpa Hall pick\r\napples.\r\n\r\nNow the supper dishes were done and the lamp was lighted.\r\n\r\n"Tell us a story, Grandma," they begged.\r\n\r\n"What shall I tell you?" said Grandma. "Shall I tell you about \'The\r\nThree Bears,\' or \'Tom Thumb,\' or \'Red Riding Hood\'?"\r\n\r\n"Tell us a new story, please," said Mary.\r\n\r\n"Well, I will tell you the story of the \'Five Little Pigs\'."\r\n\r\n"What five little pigs?" the children asked at the same moment.\r\n\r\n"You know," said Grandma.\r\n\r\n "This little pig went to market,\r\n  This little pig stayed at home,\r\n  This little pig had bread and butter,\r\n  This little pig had none,\r\n  This little pig cried, \'Wee, wee, wee!\r\n     \'I can\'t find my way home!\'"\r\n\r\n"Is there a story about those little pigs?" asked Mary. "I know I\r\nshould like that."\r\n\r\nSo Grandma Hall told the children this story:\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time there was a mother pig and she had five little pigs.\r\n\r\nThey were the very prettiest little pigs you ever saw.\r\n\r\nThey were every one white, with pretty pink noses and very curly tails.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the mother pig tied each little tail up at night to make it\r\ncurl more tightly.\r\n\r\nCurly and Whitey, Pearly and Twisty, and Baby, were the names of the\r\nfive little pigs.\r\n\r\nOne day the mother pig said to Curly: "You must go to market to-day, my\r\nson. I want a nice big cabbage for my soup."\r\n\r\nSo this little pig went to market.\r\n\r\nThe market was not very far away,--just down the road and across the\r\nfield to Grandpa Hall\'s cabbage patch.\r\n\r\n"Be sure and get a good large one," said the mother pig, as Curly\r\ntrotted away.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Mother," said Whitey, "may I go to market with Curly?"\r\n\r\n"No, Whitey," said his mother, "I want you to stay at home and take\r\ncare of Baby.\r\n\r\n"I shall be very busy all the morning.\r\n\r\n"You may take Baby out into the yard and play with her."\r\n\r\nSo this little pig stayed at home.\r\n\r\nWhitey took Baby and went out into the yard.\r\n\r\nPearly and Twisty were out there, but they were not playing.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to have to say that they were quarrelling, for one little\r\npig had some bread and butter and the other little pig had none.\r\n\r\nAfter a while the two little pigs stopped quarrelling, and then they\r\nall began to play together.\r\n\r\nFirst they played tag, then they played hide and seek.\r\n\r\n"Oh, there is Curly!" said Whitey.\r\n\r\n"See what a big cabbage he has!"\r\n\r\nSure enough, Curly was coming down the road with a cabbage as big as\r\nhis own head.\r\n\r\nMother Pig took the cabbage and put it into her soup.\r\n\r\nOh, how good the dinner did smell to the hungry little pigs!\r\n\r\n"Come to dinner, children," called their mother at last; and then what\r\na scampering there was!\r\n\r\nOne, two, three, four little pigs.\r\n\r\nThey almost fell over each other, they were in such a hurry.\r\n\r\n"Where is Baby?" cried Mother Pig.\r\n\r\nThen all the pigs were so frightened that their noses turned white.\r\n\r\nWhere was she, indeed?\r\n\r\nThey had forgotten to watch her while they were playing hide and seek.\r\n\r\nWhere could she be?\r\n\r\nThey all ran out of the house faster than they ran in.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps she ran after me and got lost," thought Curly, and he ran down\r\nthe big road.\r\n\r\nPearly thought she would go to the woods behind the barn.\r\n\r\nTwisty ran across the big meadow.\r\n\r\nMother Pig walked slowly up the road, looking behind all the trees and\r\nunder all the bushes.\r\n\r\n"Baby, Baby, Baby!" you could hear them all calling.\r\n\r\nAs Twisty ran along beside the brook, she thought she heard a noise.\r\n\r\n"Baby, Baby!" she called.\r\n\r\n"Wee, wee, wee!" cried Baby Pig, "I can\'t find my way home."\r\n\r\nWhen Twisty heard this she ran so fast she nearly fell into the brook.\r\n\r\nThere sat Baby Pig on a stone, wiping the tears out of her eyes with an\r\noak leaf.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Baby!" said Twisty, giving her sister a good hug, "what made you\r\nrun away?"\r\n\r\n"I didn\'t run away, I got lost," said Baby, "and I want to see my\r\nmother."\r\n\r\nSo Twisty and Baby ran home as fast as they could.\r\n\r\nThere were all the little pigs looking very sad because they had not\r\nfound Baby.\r\n\r\nWhen they saw her coming they ran to meet her, and Curly carried her\r\ninto the house "pig-a-back."\r\n\r\nThen they ate their cabbage soup, an it tasted all the better for\r\nwaiting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Jack and Jill\r\n    Went up the hill,\r\n      To get a pail of water.\r\n  Jack fell down\r\n    And broke his crown,\r\n      And Jill came tumbling after.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJACK AND JILL\r\n\r\n\r\nTommy Tucker and Mary had many good times together that summer.\r\n\r\nThey fished in the brook at the end of the meadow.\r\n\r\nThey went berrying and took their dinner with them.\r\n\r\nThey rode to market in the big wagon with Grandpa Hall.\r\n\r\nIn fact, they did everything that boys and girls who live on a farm\r\nlike to do.\r\n\r\nBut they did not always play alone.\r\n\r\nIn the very next house lived another little boy and girl.\r\n\r\nThis little boy and girl were twins, and they looked as much alike as\r\ntwo green peas.\r\n\r\nMary called them Jack and Jill, but I don\'t know what their mother\r\ncalled them.\r\n\r\nJack and Jill lived in a little house at the top of the hill.\r\n\r\nIn the winter, when the snow was on the ground, it was fine coasting\r\ndown that long hill.\r\n\r\nThe twins had new red sleds that Santa Claus had left them on Christmas\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nJack\'s sled was named "Racer," and Jill called hers "Lady Bird."\r\n\r\nTheir father had to paint the names on the sleds, for the sleds were\r\ntwins, too.\r\n\r\nAfter school and on Saturday you could often find Jack and Jill, with\r\n"Racer" and "Lady Bird," coasting down the hill together.\r\n\r\nBut this story is not about coasting in the winter.\r\n\r\nIt is about a slide Jack and Jill took one day in summer.\r\n\r\nMary and Tommy Tucker went to Jack\'s house one morning to play with the\r\ntwins.\r\n\r\nJill saw them coming and ran out to meet them.\r\n\r\n"Come down to the sand-bank," she cried. "We\'ve got something new down\r\nthere. Papa gave it to us."\r\n\r\nSo they all took hold of hands and ran down the hill.\r\n\r\n"Be careful, Jack," said Tommy.\r\n\r\n"Don\'t fall down and break your crown."\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the sand-bank, what do you think they found?\r\n\r\nThere was an old stove with a great big oven.\r\n\r\nSome of the covers were gone, and there was no funnel. But the oven was\r\nall right, and that was what Mary needed.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s make our oven full of cakes and pies," said Mary.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll build the fire," said Jack.\r\n\r\n"And I\'ll help you get the wood," said Tommy.\r\n\r\nHow the boys worked to get some dry leaves and sticks!\r\n\r\nOf course they could not light the fire but it was almost as much fun.\r\n\r\nThe little girls went to work at once getting out their table and\r\ndishes.\r\n\r\nThe table was a long board, and their dishes came from everywhere.\r\n\r\nThe pie plates were pretty, round shells that Mary had brought from the\r\nseashore.\r\n\r\nGrandma Hall had given them some small tins to make cakes in.\r\n\r\nThen there was a cracked bowl and a teapot without a handle.\r\n\r\nPlenty of dishes, you see, for a morning\'s baking.\r\n\r\n"What shall we bake this morning?" said Mary.\r\n\r\n"Oh, let\'s make some plum cake and blueberry cake.\r\n\r\n"Then we can make some blueberry pies and some apple pies."\r\n\r\n"Oh yes!" said Mary, "and I\'ll make some apple turnovers."\r\n\r\nBy this time the boys had the fire laid and the wood-box filled with\r\nwood.\r\n\r\n"What can we do now?" said Tommy.\r\n\r\n"You can get us some blueberries for our cakes and pies," said Jill.\r\n\r\nSo the boys took the cracked bowl and filled it with little round seeds\r\nthey called blueberries.\r\n\r\n"I know where I can get some apples," said Mary, and away she ran\r\nacross the field.\r\n\r\nShe was back again in a few minutes with her apron full of little green\r\napples.\r\n\r\n"You know, Jill," she said, "green apples make very good pies."\r\n\r\nJust then the boys came back with the berries and the baking was begun.\r\n\r\nAfter a dozen pies had been put into the oven, Jill said, "Oh, Jack! we\r\nmust have some more water.\r\n\r\n"Will you run up to the house and get some?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Jack, "if someone will go with me."\r\n\r\nTommy had gone for more apples and Mary was mixing her cake.\r\n\r\n"I will go with you," said Jill. "Here is our pail."\r\n\r\nSo Jack and Jill went up the hill to get a pail of water.\r\n\r\nTheir mother let them fill their pail.\r\n\r\nThen she gave them four cookies that she had just taken from the oven.\r\n\r\nWhen they started down the hill, Jack began to run.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"Oh, do be careful, Jack!" said Jill, "or you will--"\r\n\r\nBut she didn\'t say any more.\r\n\r\nFor down went Jack, down went Jill, and down went the pail.\r\n\r\nTommy and Mary saw them fall and ran to help them.\r\n\r\n"Oh, Jack!" said Mary, "did you break your crown?"\r\n\r\n"No," laughed Jack, "but Jill came tumbling after."\r\n\r\n"We ought to have known better than to let Jack and Jill go for a pail\r\nof water," said Tommy.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve broken the cookies," said Jill.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s go and ask Mamma for some more."\r\n\r\nSo they all went up the hill for more water and cookies.\r\n\r\nThis time Mary and Tommy carried the water down the hill.\r\n\r\nThe pies were baked, and the cakes ready to put into the oven in a very\r\nfew minutes.\r\n\r\nWhen Jill\'s mother called the children to dinner, there was a long row\r\nof cakes and pies and, cookies.\r\n\r\n"We ought to eat our dinner here," said Mary.\r\n\r\n"I like mother\'s pies and cookies best," said Jack.\r\n\r\nSo Jack and Jill ran up the hill once more, and Mary and Tommy climbed\r\nover the fence and ran across the garden to see what Grandma Hall had\r\nfor their dinner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Little Jack Homer\r\n  Sat in a corner,\r\n    Eating his Christmas pie;\r\n  He put in his thumb\r\n  And pulled out a plum,\r\n    And said, "What a big boy am I!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nJACK HORNER\'S PIE\r\n\r\n\r\nI am going to tell you about another one of Boy Blue\'s friends.\r\n\r\nHis name was Jack Horner.\r\n\r\nAt least, Boy Blue called him Jack Horner.\r\n\r\nAnd I\'ll tell you why he called him Jack Horner, too.\r\n\r\nHis real name was Jack Horne.\r\n\r\nJack was a very jolly boy.\r\n\r\nHe had round red cheeks and twinkling eyes, and he was always running\r\nand jumping about and laughing at everything.\r\n\r\nOne morning when he waked up he was happier than ever.\r\n\r\nIn fact, he was the happiest boy in town.\r\n\r\nI know he was, for he said so, and he ought to know.\r\n\r\nHis birthday was coming.\r\n\r\nIndeed, it was the very next day.\r\n\r\nAnd the very next day was Christmas, too.\r\n\r\nThink of having a birthday and Christmas on the same day!\r\n\r\nHow would you like that?\r\n\r\nJack was going to have a birthday party.\r\n\r\nOr was it a Christmas party?\r\n\r\nJack couldn\'t tell which it was.\r\n\r\nAll the children were coming,--Boy Blue, and Mary, and Alice, and Tommy\r\nTucker, and ever so many more.\r\n\r\nThere was a secret about the party.\r\n\r\nJack\'s mother had told him, but he would not tell.\r\n\r\nBoy Blue tried to guess.\r\n\r\n"Is it a Christmas tree, Jack?"\r\n\r\n"Are we going to make candy?"\r\n\r\n"Is Santa Claus coming?"\r\n\r\n"Are we going on a sleigh-ride?"\r\n\r\n"No, no, no!" said Jack. "You will never guess."\r\n\r\nAt last Christmas Day came.\r\n\r\nJack could hardly stop to look at all of his presents.\r\n\r\nHe was thinking of the party and of getting the secret ready.\r\n\r\nAt two o\'clock the children came to the party.\r\n\r\nThey each brought Jack a present.\r\n\r\nMistress Mary brought him some roses.\r\n\r\n"They grew on the rose-bush you gave me," she said.\r\n\r\nAt first the children played games.\r\n\r\nThey played "blind man\'s buff," and "hide the thimble," and "button,\r\nbutton, who has the button."\r\n\r\nAt four o\'clock Jack\'s mother came into the room.\r\n\r\n"I think you must all be hungry by this time," she said.\r\n\r\n"Will you come and see what I have for you?"\r\n\r\nSo the children followed Mrs. Horne through the long hall into the\r\ndining-room.\r\n\r\nOh, there were such good things for hungry children!\r\n\r\nThere were pretty little cakes with pink and white frosting, and\r\noranges, and nuts, and raisins, and apples, and candy.\r\n\r\nBoy Blue\'s father had heard about the party and had sent the apples\r\nfrom the farm.\r\n\r\nBoy Blue\'s mother had sent some candy made of maple sugar and nuts.\r\n\r\nOh, it was so good!\r\n\r\nWhen each one had eaten some of the cakes, and some of the nuts, and\r\nsome of the candy, Mrs. Horne went out into the kitchen.\r\n\r\nJack began to laugh and his eyes looked very big and wise.\r\n\r\n"The surprise is coming!" cried Boy Blue. "The surprise is coming!"\r\n\r\nAnd sure enough! In came Mrs. Horne, carrying a huge pie in her hands.\r\n\r\n"This is Jack Horner\'s pie," she said. "I think it is full of plums."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "Then he had put in his hand and pulled out something."]\r\n\r\nThen she put it on the table in front of Jack.\r\n\r\nHe stood up and said:--\r\n\r\n "Little Jack Horner\r\n  Stood near a corner\r\n  Cutting his birthday pie.\r\n  He put in his thumb\r\n  And pulled out a plum,\r\n  And said, \'What a big boy am I!\'"\r\n\r\nHow the children laughed!\r\n\r\nJack had cut the paper crust of his birthday pie.\r\n\r\nThen he had put in his hand and pulled out something.\r\n\r\nIt was surely too big for a real plum.\r\n\r\n"For Boy Blue," said Jack, giving him the package.\r\n\r\nBoy Blue took off the white paper and there was a tiny horn, tied with\r\na blue ribbon.\r\n\r\nThen Jack pulled out another plum.\r\n\r\nIt was a book about flowers for Mistress Mary.\r\n\r\nTommy Tucker had a knife.\r\n\r\n"That\'s to cut your bread with," said Jack Horner.\r\n\r\nMary found a woolly lamb in her plum.\r\n\r\nThe lamb\'s head would come off, an inside was a tiny bottle of cologne.\r\n\r\nJack and Jill each had a little pail filled with candies.\r\n\r\nJack\'s plum was in the very bottom of the pie.\r\n\r\nIt was a dear little watch.\r\n\r\n"Now, I shall not be late to school again," he said.\r\n\r\nIt was Jack, you know, who let Mary\'s lamb into school.\r\n\r\nHe was late that morning and did not shut the door.\r\n\r\nWhen it was time for the children to go home Mr. Horne packed them all\r\ninto his big sleigh.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, Jack!" they cried.\r\n\r\n"Good-bye, Jack Horner, we have had\r\na lovely time!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  There was an old woman\r\n    Who lived in a shoe,\r\n  She had so many children\r\n    She didn\'t know what to do,\r\n  She gave them some butter\r\n    Without any bread;\r\n  Then she spanked them all soundly,\r\n    And sent them to bed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OLD WOMAN IN THE SHOE\r\n\r\n\r\nYou remember I told you that Boy Blue lived on a big farm.\r\n\r\nIn the winter Boy Blue could not go to school because the school-house\r\nwas so far from his home.\r\n\r\nSo Mary\'s mother said, "Boy Blue can spend the winter with us and go to\r\nschool with Mary."\r\n\r\nOf course the children thought that would be fine.\r\n\r\nMary didn\'t have any brothers or sisters, and sometimes she was rather\r\nlonely.\r\n\r\nSo Boy Blue went to spend the winter with Mary.\r\n\r\nHe was sorry to leave Fire-cracker and his eight white Snowballs.\r\n\r\n"I shall be back in the spring," he said. "John will have to take care\r\nof you this winter."\r\n\r\nBoy Blue had never seen such a large school in all his life.\r\n\r\nIn the little country school there were only ten children.\r\n\r\nIn Mary\'s school there were fifty boys and girls in one room, and there\r\nwere ten rooms in the school-house.\r\n\r\nNow it was winter, and there was snow on the ground.\r\n\r\nThe children had been to school three months.\r\n\r\nEvery afternoon they had great fun coasting down the long hill behind\r\nthe school-house.\r\n\r\nOne day Miss Smith said, "Children, do you know what month this is?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes!" they all said. "This is December."\r\n\r\n"Christmas comes this month," said one little girl.\r\n\r\nThen they all talked at once.\r\n\r\nOh, how they liked Christmas, and Santa Claus and Christmas trees!\r\n\r\nThey hoped Santa Claus would bring them many presents.\r\n\r\nAt last Miss Smith said, "Shall we have a Christmas tree this year in\r\nschool?"\r\n\r\nOf course they all wanted one.\r\n\r\n"I know something better than a Christmas tree," said Miss Smith.\r\n\r\n"Something better than a Christmas tree!" said Mistress Mary. "What can\r\nit be?"\r\n\r\n"I must tell you about it," said Miss Smith. "You know I have told you\r\nabout Mrs. Brown."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Boy Blue, "she is the \'Old Woman in the Shoe.\'"\r\n\r\nMiss Smith laughed. "Is that what you call her?" she said.\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Mary, "you know she has a great many children."\r\n\r\n"Well, Tommy and Betty Brown have been sick a long time.\r\n\r\n"Mrs. Brown has had to work very hard to get food to eat.\r\n\r\n"I am afraid they will not have a happy Christmas.\r\n\r\n"I think we might have a Christmas box, and fill it with all kinds of\r\ngood things.\r\n\r\n"We can put things to eat and wear in the box, and you can bring some\r\ntoys, too.\r\n\r\n"Then on Christmas day we can send the box to Mrs. Brown.\r\n\r\n"That would make her happy, and it would make us happy, too."\r\n\r\nThe children all thought this was a very good idea.\r\n\r\nJack said, "I think it would be great fun if we could have a box the\r\nshape of a big shoe. I know my father could make us one. I will ask him\r\nto-night."\r\n\r\nSo Jack\'s father made a big wooden shoe, and the boys helped him paint\r\nit black.\r\n\r\nWhen the shoe was finished, the children began to fill it.\r\n\r\nIn the toe of the shoe Jack put two large squashes.\r\n\r\nMary brought a bag of potatoes and some big red apples.\r\n\r\nBoy Blue wrote a letter to his mother and told her about the Christmas\r\nshoe.\r\n\r\nSo Mrs. Snow sent a roasted chicken, a dozen eggs, and some fresh\r\nbutter that she had made.\r\n\r\nI cannot tell you all the things that found their way into that wooden\r\nshoe.\r\n\r\nThere was everything that hungry little boys and girls like to eat.\r\n\r\nThere were games and toys for the boys, and dolls with pretty dresses\r\nfor the girls.\r\n\r\nAnd there was a fine new dress for Mrs. Brown, too.\r\n\r\nThe day before Christmas the shoe was ready and Mr. Horne came for it\r\nwith a big wagon.\r\n\r\nMiss Smith put a card in the shoe.\r\n\r\nIt said:--\r\n\r\n"A Merry Christmas to Mrs. Brown and all the little Browns, from\r\nMaggie\'s and Tommy\'s schoolmates."\r\n\r\n"Look, Mamma!" said little Maggie Brown. "What is that wagon stopping\r\nhere for, and what is that funny thing in it?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Brown came to the window just as Mr. Home took the shoe out of the\r\nwagon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"Why, it is a big shoe," laughed Mrs. Brown. "I guess it is for me to\r\nkeep you all in."\r\n\r\nTommy, and Katie, and Mary, and Alice, all ran to see.\r\n\r\nOh, they were so happy when the shoe was brought in and they found it\r\nwas something for them!\r\n\r\nMrs. Brown was happy, too, to think that her children would have such a\r\nmerry Christmas.\r\n\r\nShe told Mr. Horne to wish all the children who sent the shoe a very,\r\nvery happy Christmas.\r\n\r\n"And tell them," she said, "to come and see \'the Old Woman in the Shoe\'\r\nand her children!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Little Miss Muffet\r\n  Sat on a tuffet,\r\n    Eating her curds and whey;\r\n  There came a big spider\r\n  And sat down beside her,\r\n    And frightened Miss Muffet away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMISS MUFFET\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was the Christmas vacation and Boy Blue and Mary were at home every\r\nday.\r\n\r\nBoy Blue wished to go to his own home on the farm in his vacation.\r\n\r\nHe wished to see his father and mother, and little sister, and\r\nfire-cracker, and his eight Snowballs.\r\n\r\nBut one night he had a letter from his mother.\r\n\r\nOf course he could read it himself, because he was seven years old and\r\nhad been to school two years.\r\n\r\nWhen he read the letter he danced up and down for joy.\r\n\r\nHe danced right through the hall into the dining-room and showed his\r\nletter to Mary.\r\n\r\nThen she danced, too, because the letter said that Boy Blue\'s father\r\nand mother were coming to see him the very next day.\r\n\r\nAnd, best of all, Little Sister was coming to stay two weeks.\r\n\r\nWhen it was time to go to the station to meet Little Sister and her\r\nmother. Boy Blue could hardly wait for the train.\r\n\r\nAt last it came, bringing the two dearest people in all the world, and\r\nBoy Blue laughed, and cried, and asked questions, all in the same\r\nminute.\r\n\r\n"Where is Papa?\r\n\r\n"Is he coming to-morrow?\r\n\r\n"How is Fire-cracker?\r\n\r\n"Are you going to stay two weeks?"\r\n\r\n"Wait, wait, children!" said Mrs. Snow, "ask one question at a time."\r\n\r\nThey rode to Mary\'s house in a car, and all these questions and many\r\nothers were asked and answered.\r\n\r\nIt was the night before Christmas and the children were going to hang\r\nup their stockings.\r\n\r\n"Hang them by the chimney in your playroom," said Mary\'s mother. "Then\r\nSanta Claus won\'t have far to go."\r\n\r\nSo the children ran up to the playroom with their stockings.\r\n\r\n"Oh, look!" said Boy Blue. "Sister\'s stocking is so small that Santa\r\nClaus can\'t get even a rag doll into it."\r\n\r\nMary found a basket for Little Sister.\r\n\r\n"You can put this right under your stocking, dear," she said.\r\n\r\n"I will write a letter to Santa Claus and tell him where to put your\r\npresents."\r\n\r\nSo she wrote this letter and pinned it on the toe of the tiny stocking:\r\n\r\n"Dear Santa Claus:--Little Sister\'s stocking is so small I have given\r\nher a basket. Please put her presents in it."\r\n\r\nSanta Claus must have read the note, for the next morning the basket\r\nwas full.\r\n\r\nThere was a basket under each of the other stockings, too.\r\n\r\nOn each one was a note, saying:--\r\n\r\n"Your stockings were not large enough. I had to get a basket for you,\r\ntoo."\r\n\r\n                                                    SANTA CLAUS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Boy Blue\'s basket there were a horn and a drum, a box of tin\r\nsoldiers, and three books. Under the basket was a new red sled.\r\n\r\nMary found two dolls and a trunk full of dresses for them, a toy\r\nkitchen, and a writing desk in her basket.\r\n\r\nLittle Sister sat on the floor and began to take the presents out of\r\nher basket, one at a time.\r\n\r\nFirst, there was a big wax doll in a doll carriage.\r\n\r\nIt was such a pretty doll, with a blue coat and white hood, all ready\r\nto take out to ride!\r\n\r\nThen there were some picture books and another doll,--a big one that\r\ncould open and shut her eyes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBut what was this in the bottom of the basket? It was very soft and\r\nwhite and had curly hair.\r\n\r\nLittle Sister picked it up carefully. "Put it on your head," said Boy\r\nBlue. So Sister put it on. It was a fur cap.\r\n\r\nThen she found a fur collar, and last of all, a dear little fur muff.\r\n\r\nWhen she had them all on, she ran up to her mother.\r\n\r\n"See my muff, Mamma!" she cried.\r\n\r\nThen she ran to every one, saying:--"Muff! Muff! See my little muff!"\r\n\r\n"What a dear little Miss Muffet you are!" said Uncle Jack.\r\n\r\n"Oh." said Boy Blue, "we shall call you \'Miss Muffet\'!"\r\n\r\n"Merry Christmas, Miss Muffet!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall;\r\n  Humpty Dumpty had a great fall;\r\n    All the king\'s horses,\r\n    And all the king\'s men,\r\n  Couldn\'t put Humpty Dumpty together again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHUMPTY DUMPTY\r\n\r\n\r\nTommy Tucker had lived on the farm with Grandma and Grandpa Hall a long\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nHe and Rags were very happy in their new home.\r\n\r\nRags was getting fat now, and every Saturday he had a fine bath.\r\n\r\nAt least Tommy said it was a fine bath, but Rags did not seem to agree\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\n"Bow-wow," he would say, when he saw the big tub full of water, "I must\r\nrun and hide."\r\n\r\nBut Tommy always found him, and Rags always had his bath.\r\n\r\nWhen school began in September, Grandma Hall took Tommy to school.\r\n\r\nHe had a new suit of clothes, a new pair of boots, and a pretty cap to\r\nmatch his suit.\r\n\r\nThe school was two miles from the farm, so that the first morning he\r\nrode in the carriage with Grandma Hall because she could not walk so\r\nfar.\r\n\r\nEvery day after that Tommy walked to school in the morning and home\r\nagain at night.\r\n\r\nHe carried his dinner in a new pail, and he always found something very\r\ngood in that pail when he opened it at noon.\r\n\r\nAll the rest of the children brought their dinner, too, and if I should\r\ntell you all the things those children did at noon, it would fill a\r\nbook.\r\n\r\nWhen the nuts were ripe, they went into the woods and gathered big\r\nbaskets full.\r\n\r\nThey found pretty flowers and autumn leaves and made their school-room\r\nbright with them.\r\n\r\nThey played ball, and hide and seek.\r\n\r\nOh, there were such beautiful places to hide,--behind the wood-pile, in\r\nthe wood-box, behind trees and fences, and in the woods!\r\n\r\nTommy had never had such a good time in his life.\r\n\r\nHe did not play all the time, because he was working very hard to catch\r\nup with the other boys.\r\n\r\nBefore the winter was over he was in the class with Jack and Jill, and\r\nGrandma said she was very proud of him.\r\n\r\nBut I must tell you of the Jack-o\'-lanterns the children made for\r\nHallowe\'en.\r\n\r\nTommy did not know much about Hallowe\'en, for he had always lived in\r\nthe city.\r\n\r\nHe had seen boys make Jack-o\'-lanterns out of paper boxes.\r\n\r\nBut he had never seen a real pumpkin Jack-o\'-lantern in his life.\r\n\r\nOne day, near the last of October, the children were all talking about\r\nHallowe\'en and the fun they would have with their lanterns.\r\n\r\n"You\'ll make one, won\'t you, Tommy?" said Jack.\r\n\r\nOf course Tommy wanted to make one if the boys would show him how.\r\n\r\n"I know what would be fun," said\r\n\r\nJill. "Let\'s bring our pumpkins to school and make our lanterns at\r\nnoon."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes, that is just the thing!" they shouted.\r\n\r\n"Then when they are finished we can ask Miss Phillips which is the\r\nprettiest."\r\n\r\nAs if a Jack-o\'-lantern could ever be pretty!\r\n\r\nThe next morning there was a funny sight in the dressing-room.\r\n\r\nUnder each hook was a pumpkin.\r\n\r\nThere were big ones, little ones, fat ones, long ones, short ones,\r\nyellow ones, and green ones.\r\n\r\nIn fact, no two pumpkins were alike, except of course, Jack\'s and\r\nJill\'s.\r\n\r\n"It will never do for us to have ours different," said Jill.\r\n\r\nSo they hunted a long time to find two that were just alike.\r\n\r\nTommy tried very hard to think of his arithmetic and geography and\r\nspelling that morning.\r\n\r\nBut he couldn\'t help thinking of his pumpkin, which was waiting to be\r\nmade into a Jack-o\'-lantern.\r\n\r\nAt last it was noon.\r\n\r\nI am afraid the children did not care what they had for dinner that\r\nnoon, and they ate very fast.\r\n\r\nThey needed all the time they could get for their Jack-o\'-lanterns.\r\n\r\nFirst, they cut off the top of the pumpkin, and cut out all the seeds.\r\nThen came the fun of making the lantern\'s face.\r\n\r\nHe must have two eyes, a nose, a mouth, and two ears.\r\n\r\nJack cut two round holes for eyes.\r\n\r\nA long cut in the middle was the nose.\r\n\r\nThe mouth curved up at both ends, and the holes at the sides were ears.\r\n\r\nSome of the lanterns had two very good rows of teeth.\r\n\r\nTom\'s pumpkin was long and narrow. He said it looked so much like a big\r\negg that he was going to name it "Humpty Dumpty."\r\n\r\n"Oh, let\'s all name our lanterns!" said the children.\r\n\r\n"Mine is so round I shall call it \'Tubby\'," said Jack.\r\n\r\nThen Jill named hers "Bubby."\r\n\r\nOne of the boys named his "Green Top," and another was "Big Eyes."\r\n\r\nJust as the bell rang for school the last one was finished.\r\n\r\nHow Miss Phillips laughed when the children marched in, each one\r\ncarrying a funny Jack-o\'-lantern!\r\n\r\nShe said she could not tell which one was the prettiest.\r\n\r\nAfter she had been introduced to each one they were put into the hall\r\nto wait for school to be over.\r\n\r\nHallowe\'en night every lantern had a candle in it, and the children had\r\ngreat fun trying to frighten their mothers and fathers and each other.\r\n\r\nOf course Grandpa Hall jumped and ran when he saw a big bright face\r\ncoming at him from the barn.\r\n\r\nThen Grandma Hall saw it in the woodshed, and she ran and hid behind\r\nthe kitchen door.\r\n\r\nTommy played with Humpty Dumpty for several days.\r\n\r\nSaturday morning he was in the meadow playing with Humpty Dumpty when\r\nJack and Jill came to ask him to go with them to the woods.\r\n\r\nTommy put Humpty Dumpty up on the stone wall and ran off with the\r\ntwins.\r\n\r\nGrandpa Hall\'s old white cow was in the meadow eating grass.\r\n\r\nAs she came near the wall she saw something that looked very much like\r\na pumpkin.\r\n\r\nMrs. Cow was fond of pumpkins, so she thought she would go and see what\r\nit really was on the wall.\r\n\r\n"Why, it surely is a pumpkin," said Mrs. Cow, "but I wonder what all\r\nthose holes are for."\r\n\r\nHumpty Dumpty felt very much hurt to think that Mrs. Cow should speak\r\nof his eyes and mouth as holes.\r\n\r\n"But then, of course," thought Humpty, "she does not know that I am not\r\na pumpkin now."\r\n\r\nMrs. Cow kept putting her nose nearer and nearer to Humpty.\r\n\r\nAt last she got so near that she made him jump.\r\n\r\nAt least, I think he must have jumped, for he fell from the wall to the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Cow saw the pumpkin all broken in pieces she thought she\r\nmight as well eat it, and she did.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAt first she liked the pumpkin very much, but then she thought it\r\ndidn\'t taste just right.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t believe pumpkins with big round holes in them are good to\r\neat," said Mrs. Cow.\r\n\r\nBut when Tommy found what had happened to Humpty Dumpty, he said to\r\nGrandpa Hall, "I wonder which Mrs. Cow liked best, the Jack-o\'-lantern\r\nor the candle!"\r\n\r\nThe children in Miss Smith\'s room had been just as busy as bees all\r\nday.\r\n\r\nNow they were tired, and they could not work any more.\r\n\r\nMary put her head down on her desk and nearly went to sleep.\r\n\r\nMost of the boys were looking out of the window, because they liked to\r\nwatch it snow.\r\n\r\nIt had been snowing hard all day and they were thinking of the\r\nsnowballs they would make, and of the snow forts that they would build\r\non the hill.\r\n\r\nHow could they study when they were thinking of all those things?\r\n\r\n"Miss Smith," said Bo-peep, looking up from her work, "won\'t you please\r\ntell us a story? It is getting so dark that I cannot see to write."\r\n\r\nMiss Smith thought a minute and then said, "How would you like to play\r\nat being a book?"\r\n\r\nEvery little face brightened. The boys looked at Miss Smith and forgot\r\nabout the snow forts.\r\n\r\nMary sat up and did not feel one bit sleepy.\r\n\r\n"Why, Miss Smith," said Mary, "how can we be a book?"\r\n\r\n"I will show you," said Miss Smith.\r\n\r\n"We will play that we are the Mother Goose Book.\r\n\r\n"You must each think of some child from Mother Goose land whom you\r\nwould like to be.\r\n\r\n"Then each one can come to the front of the room and play at being that\r\nlittle child.\r\n\r\n"The rest of us will try to guess who the child is."\r\n\r\nThe children all thought that would be great fun, and for a few minutes\r\nit was so quiet they could almost hear the snow falling.\r\n\r\nAt the end of five minutes Miss Smith said, "Now it is time to begin.\r\nYou may be on the first page in our book, Jack.\r\n\r\n"You may use anything in the room you need to help you in acting your\r\npart."\r\n\r\nJack went into the hall. In a minute he pushed the door open a little\r\nway and looked in.\r\n\r\nThen he came into the school-room. He had his books under his arm, and\r\nas he came in very slowly he looked at the clock.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know!" said John. "Hickory, dickory, dock."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: "She looked so funny as she came into the room\r\nriding on a broom"]\r\n\r\n"No, no," said Mary, "that is:--\r\n\r\n  \'A dillar, a dollar,\r\n  A ten o\'clock scholar,\r\n  What makes you come so soon?\r\n  You used to come at ten o\'clock,\r\n  And now you come at noon.\'"\r\n\r\n"That is right," said Jack. "Mary guessed it."\r\n\r\nThen it was Mary\'s turn to be a page in the Mother Goose Book.\r\n\r\nWhen she came in she had on Miss Smith\'s long white apron, her hair was\r\ndone up high on her head, and she was riding on a broom.\r\n\r\nShe looked so funny that all the children laughed.\r\n\r\nAt last Edith stopped laughing and began to sing:\r\n\r\n "Old woman, old woman,\r\n  Old woman, said I.\r\n  Oh whither, oh whither,\r\n  Oh whither so high?\r\n  To sweep the cobwebs out of the sky;\r\n  But I\'ll be back again by-and-by."\r\n\r\nYes, Edith had guessed right, so she ran out of the room.\r\n\r\nWhen she came back the children all looked and looked.\r\n\r\nWho could she be?\r\n\r\nShe hadn\'t changed herself one bit, and she only stood still and looked\r\nat them.\r\n\r\n"We are caught this time," laughed Miss Smith.\r\n\r\nJust then a little girl in the back of the room jumped up and said:\r\n"Oh, see the curl in the middle of her forehead! I know who she is!\r\n\r\n \'There was a little girl,\r\n  And she had a little curl.\r\n  And it hung right down on her forehead.\r\n  When she was good\r\n  She was very good indeed;\r\n  But when she was bad she was horrid.\'"\r\n\r\nTommy went out next, and when he came back he had a little toy pig\r\nunder his arm.\r\n\r\n"I can think of ever so many pigs in Mother Goose," said Alice. "Have\r\nyou been to market, Tommy?"\r\n\r\n"No, no," said Tommy, "I did not buy this good fat pig."\r\n\r\n"I know who you are, and where you got your pig," laughed Jill.\r\n\r\n"Tom, Tom, the piper\'s son,\r\n Stole a pig and away he run."\r\n\r\nMistress Mary came in with her watering pot to water her flowers.\r\n\r\nBoy Blue was quickly guessed because he had a horn.\r\n\r\nJust as Jack and Jill came in with a pail of water, the bell rang.\r\n\r\nIt was time to go home!\r\n\r\nEvery one of the children was sorry not to see all of the book.\r\n\r\n"Some day we will play this game again," said Miss Smith. "Then we can\r\nsee the rest of the pages."\r\n\r\nAs they ran home together they were all talking of the new game.\r\n\r\nThat night they got out their Mother Goose books and read them through,\r\nso that the next time they would be sure to guess every rhyme.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Boy Blue and His Friends\r\nby Etta Austin Blaisdell and Mary Frances Blaisdell\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK BOY BLUE AND HIS FRIENDS ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 16046.txt or 16046.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/6/0/4/16046/\r\n\r\nProduced by Juliet Sutherland, Anuradha Valsa Raj, Leonard\r\nJohnson and the Online Distributed Proofreading Team at\r\nhttp://www.pgdp.net\r\n\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
