It is awakening in her\r\nlongings for free, wholesome, and adventurous outdoor life, for the\r\ninnocent delights of nature-loving Thoreau and bird-loving Burroughs.\r\nSturdy, independent, self-reliant, she is now demanding outdoor books\r\nthat are genuine and filled with practical information; books that tell\r\nhow to do worth-while things, that teach real woodcraft and are not\r\nadapted to the girl supposed to be afraid of a caterpillar or to shudder\r\nat sight of a harmless snake.\r\n\r\nIn answer to the demand, "On the Trail" has been written. The authors\'\r\ndeep desire is to help girls respond to this new, insistent call by\r\npointing out to them the open trail. It is their hope and wish that\r\ntheir girl readers may seek the charm of the wild and may find the same\r\nhappiness in the life of the open that the American boy has enjoyed\r\nsince the first settler built his little cabin on the shores of the New\r\nWorld. To forward this object, the why and how, the where and when of\r\nthings of camp and trail have been embodied in this book.\r\n\r\nThanks are due to Edward Cave, president and editor of _Recreation_, for\r\nkindly allowing the use of some of his wild-life photographs.\r\n\r\n                                                  LINA BEARD,\r\n                                                      ADELIA BELLE BEARD.\r\n          FLUSHING, N.

How to Find the Trail and How\r\nto Keep It=\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is a something in you, as in every one, every man, woman, girl,\r\nand boy, that requires the tonic life of the wild. You may not know it,\r\nmany do not, but there is a part of your nature that only the wild can\r\nreach, satisfy, and develop. The much-housed, overheated, overdressed,\r\nand over-entertained life of most girls is artificial, and if one does\r\nnot turn away from and leave it for a while, one also becomes greatly\r\nartificial and must go through life not knowing the joy, the strength,\r\nthe poise that real outdoor life can give.\r\n\r\nWhat is it about a true woodsman that instantly compels our respect,\r\nthat sets him apart from the men who might be of his class in village or\r\ntown and puts him in a class by himself, though he may be exteriorly\r\nrough and have little or no book education? The real Adirondack or the\r\nNorth Woods guide, alert, clean-limbed, clear-eyed, hard-muscled,\r\nbearing his pack-basket or duffel-bag on his back, doing all the hard\r\nwork of the camp, never loses his poise or the simple dignity which he\r\nshares with all the things of the wild. It is bred in him, is a part of\r\nhimself and the life he leads. He is as conscious of his superior\r\nknowledge of the woods as an astronomer is of his knowledge of the\r\nstars, and patiently tolerates the ignorance and awkwardness of the\r\n"tenderfoot" from the city. Only a keen sense of humor can make this\r\ntoleration possible, for I have seen things done by a city-dweller at\r\ncamp that would enrage a woodsman, unless the irresistibly funny side of\r\nit made him laugh his inward laugh that seldom reaches the surface.\r\n\r\nTo live for a while in the wild strengthens the muscles of your mind as\r\nwell as of your body. Flabby thoughts and flabby muscles depart together\r\nand are replaced by enthusiasm and vigor of purpose, by strength of limb\r\nand chest and back. To _have_ seems not so desirable as to _be_. When\r\nyou have once come into sympathy with this world of the wild--which\r\nholds our cultivated, artificial world in the hollow of its hand and\r\ngives it life--new joy, good, wholesome, heartfelt joy, will well up\r\nwithin you. New and absorbing interests will claim your attention. You\r\nwill breathe deeper, stand straighter. The small, petty things of life\r\nwill lose their seeming importance and great things will look larger and\r\ninfinitely more worth while. You will know that the woods, the fields,\r\nthe streams and great waters bear wonderful messages for you, and,\r\nlittle by little, you will learn to read them.\r\n\r\nThe majority of people who visit the up-to-date hotels of the\r\nAdirondacks, which their wily proprietors call camps, may think they see\r\nthe wild and are living in it. But for them it is only a big\r\npicnic-ground through which they rush with unseeing eyes and whose\r\ncloisters they invade with unfeeling hearts, seemingly for the one\r\npurpose of building a fire, cooking their lunch, eating it, and then\r\nhurrying back to the comforts of the hotel and the gayety of hotel life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: One can generally pass around obstructions like this on\r\nthe trail.]\r\n\r\nAt their careless and noisy approach the forest suddenly withdraws\r\nitself into its deep reserve and reveals no secrets. It is as if they\r\nentered an empty house and passed through deserted rooms, but all the\r\ntime the intruders are stealthily watched by unseen, hostile, or\r\nfrightened eyes. Every form of moving life is stilled and magically\r\nfades into its background. The tawny rabbit halts amid the dry leaves of\r\na fallen tree. No one sees it. The sinuous weasel slips silently under a\r\nrock by the side of the trail and is unnoticed. The mother grouse\r\ncrouches low amid the underbrush and her little ones follow her example,\r\nbut the careless company has no time to observe and drifts quickly by.\r\nOnly the irrepressible red squirrel might be seen, but isn\'t, when he\r\nloses his balance and drops to a lower branch in his efforts to miss\r\nnothing of the excitement of the invasion.\r\n\r\nThis is not romance, it is truth. To think sentimentally about nature,\r\nto sit by a babbling brook and try to put your supposed feelings into\r\nverse, will not help you to know the wild. The only way to cultivate the\r\nsympathy and understanding which will enable you to feel its\r\nheart-beats, is to go to it humbly, ready to see the wonders it can\r\nshow; ready to appreciate and love its beauties and ready to meet on\r\nfriendly and cordial terms the animal life whose home it is. The wild\r\nworld is, indeed, a wonderful world; how wonderful and interesting we\r\nlearn only by degrees and actual experience. It is free, but not\r\nlawless; to enter it fully we must obey these laws which are slowly and\r\nsilently impressed upon us. It is a wholesome, life-giving, inspiring\r\nworld, and when you have learned to conform to its rules you are met on\r\nevery hand by friendly messengers to guide you and teach you the ways of\r\nthe wild: wild birds, wild fruits and plants, and gentle, furtive, wild\r\nanimals. You cannot put their messages into words, but you can feel\r\nthem; and then, suddenly, you no longer care for soft cushions and rugs,\r\nfor shaded lamps, dainty fare and finery, for paved streets and concrete\r\nwalks. You want to plant your feet upon the earth in its natural state,\r\nhowever rugged or boggy it may be. You want your cushions to be of the\r\nsoft moss-beds of the piny woods, and, with the unparalleled sauce of a\r\nhealthy, hearty appetite, you want to eat your dinner out of doors,\r\ncooked over the outdoor fire, and to drink water from a birch-bark cup,\r\nbrought cool and dripping from the bubbling spring.\r\n\r\nYou want, oh! how you want to sleep on a springy bed of balsam boughs,\r\nwrapped in soft, warm, woollen blankets with the sweet night air of all\r\noutdoors to breathe while you sleep. You want your flower-garden, not\r\nwith great and gorgeous masses of bloom in evident, orderly beds, but\r\nkeeping always charming surprises for unexpected times and in\r\nunsuspected places. You want the flowers that grow without your help in\r\nways you have not planned; that hold the enchantment of the wilderness.\r\nSome people are born with this love for the wild, some attain it, but in\r\neither case the joy is there, and to find it you must seek it. Your\r\nchosen trail may lead through the primeval forests or into the great\r\nwestern deserts or plains; or it may reach only left-over bits of the\r\nwild which can be found at no great distance from home. Even a bit of\r\nmeadow or woodland, even an uncultivated field on the hilltop, will give\r\nyou a taste of the wild; and if you strike the trail in the right spirit\r\nyou will find upon arrival that these remnants of the wild world have\r\nmuch to show and to teach you. There are the sky, the clouds, the\r\nlungfuls of pure air, the growing things which send their roots where\r\nthey will and not in a man-ordered way. There is the wild life that\r\nobeys no man\'s law: the insects, the birds, and small four-footed\r\nanimals. On all sides you will find evidences of wild life if you will\r\nlook for it. Here you may make camp for a day and enjoy that day as much\r\nas if it were one of many in a several weeks\' camping trip.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is not to be a book of glittering generalities but, as far\r\nas it can be made, one of practical helpfulness in outdoor life;\r\ntherefore when you are told to strike the trail you must also be told\r\nhow to do it.\r\n\r\n\r\n=When You Strike the Trail=\r\n\r\nFor any journey, by rail or by boat, one has a general idea of the\r\ndirection to be taken, the character of the land or water to be crossed,\r\nand of what one will find at the end. So it should be in striking the\r\ntrail. Learn all you can about the path you are to follow. Whether it is\r\nplain or obscure, wet or dry; where it leads; and its length, measured\r\nmore by time than by actual miles. A smooth, even trail of five miles\r\nwill not consume the time and strength that must be expended upon a\r\ntrail of half that length which leads over uneven ground, varied by bogs\r\nand obstructed by rocks and fallen trees, or a trail that is all up-hill\r\nclimbing. If you are a novice and accustomed to walking only over smooth\r\nand level ground, you must allow more time for covering the distance\r\nthan an experienced person would require and must count upon the\r\nexpenditure of more strength, because your feet are not trained to the\r\nwilderness paths with their pitfalls and traps for the unwary, and every\r\nnerve and muscle will be strained to secure a safe foothold amid the\r\ntangled roots, on the slippery, moss-covered logs, over precipitous\r\nrocks that lie in your path. It will take time to pick your way over\r\nboggy places where the water oozes up through the thin, loamy soil as\r\nthrough a sponge; and experience alone will teach you which hummock of\r\ngrass or moss will make a safe stepping-place and will not sink beneath\r\nyour weight and soak your feet with hidden water. Do not scorn to learn\r\nall you can about the trail you are to take, although your questions may\r\ncall forth superior smiles. It is not that you hesitate to encounter\r\ndifficulties, but that you may prepare for them. In unknown regions take\r\na responsible guide with you, unless the trail is short, easily\r\nfollowed, and a frequented one. Do not go alone through lonely places;\r\nand, being on the trail, keep it and try no explorations of your own, at\r\nleast not until you are quite familiar with the country and the ways of\r\nthe wild.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Difficulties of the Adirondack trail.\r\n\r\nFacsimile of drawing made by a trailer (not the author) after a day in\r\nthe wilds of an Adirondack forest. Not a good drawing, perhaps, but a\r\ngood illustration.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Blazing the Trail=\r\n\r\nA woodsman usually blazes his trail by chipping with his axe the trees\r\nhe passes, leaving white scars on their trunks, and to follow such a\r\ntrail you stand at your first tree until you see the blaze on the next,\r\nthen go to that and look for the one farther on; going in this way from\r\ntree to tree you keep the trail though it may, underfoot, be overgrown\r\nand indistinguishable.\r\n\r\nIf you must make a trail of your own, blaze it as you go by bending down\r\nand breaking branches of trees, underbrush, and bushes. Let the broken\r\nbranches be on the side of bush or tree in the direction you are going,\r\nbut bent down away from that side, or toward the bush, so that the\r\nlighter underside of the leaves will show and make a plain trail. Make\r\nthese signs conspicuous and close together, for in returning, a dozen\r\nfeet without the broken branch will sometimes confuse you, especially as\r\neverything has a different look when seen from the opposite side. By\r\nthis same token it is a wise precaution to look back frequently as you\r\ngo and impress the homeward-bound landmarks on your memory. If in your\r\nwanderings you have branched off and made ineffectual or blind trails\r\nwhich lead nowhere, and, in returning to camp, you are led astray by one\r\nof them, do not leave the false trail and strike out to make a new one,\r\nbut turn back and follow the false trail to its beginning, for it must\r\nlead to the true trail again. _Don\'t lose sight of your broken\r\nbranches._\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Blazing the trail by bending down and breaking branches.]\r\n\r\nIf you carry a hatchet or small axe you can make a permanent trail by\r\nblazing the trees as the woodsmen do. Kephart advises blazing in this\r\nway: make one blaze on the side of the tree away from the camp and two\r\nblazes on the side toward the camp. Then when you return you look for\r\nthe _one_ blaze. In leaving camp again to follow the same trail, you\r\nlook for the _two_ blazes. If you should lose the trail and reach it\r\nagain you will know to a certainty which direction to take, for two\r\nblazes mean _camp on this side_; one blaze, _away from camp on this\r\nside_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=To Know an Animal Trail=\r\n\r\nTo know an animal trail from one made by men is quite important. It is\r\neasy to be led astray by animal trails, for they are often well defined\r\nand, in some cases, well beaten. To the uninitiated the trails will\r\nappear the same, but there is a difference which, in a recent number of\r\n_Field and Stream_, Mr. Arthur Rice defines very clearly in this way:\r\n"Men step _on_ things. Animals step _over_ or around things." Then again\r\nan animal trail frequently passes under bushes and low branches of trees\r\nwhere men would cut or break their way through. To follow an animal\r\ntrail is to be led sometimes to water, often to a bog or swamp, at times\r\nto the animal\'s den, which in the case of a bear might not be exactly\r\npleasant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Returning to camp by the blazed trail.\r\n\r\n_Note the blazed trees._]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Lost in the Woods=\r\n\r\nWe were in the wilderness of an Adirondack forest making camp for the\r\nday and wanted to see the beaver-dam which, we were told, was on the\r\nedge of a near-by lake. The guide was busy cooking dinner and we would\r\nnot wait for his leisure, but leaving the rest of the party, we started\r\noff confidently, just two of us, down the perfectly plain trail. For a\r\nshort distance there was a beaten path, then, suddenly, the trail came\r\nto an abrupt end. We looked this side and that. No trail, no appearance\r\nof there ever having been one. With a careless wave of his arm, the\r\nguide had said: "Keep in that direction." "That" being to the left, to\r\nthe left we therefore turned and stormed our way through thicket and\r\nbramble, breaking branches as we went. Sliding down declivities,\r\nscrambling over fallen trees, dipping beneath low-hung branches, we\r\nfinally came out upon the shore of the lake and found that we had struck\r\nthe exact spot where the beaver-dam was located.\r\n\r\nIt was only a short distance from camp and it had not taken us long to\r\nmake it, but when we turned back we warmly welcomed the sight of our\r\nblazed trail, for all else was strange and unfamiliar. Going there had\r\nbeen glimpses of the water now and then to guide us, returning we had no\r\nlandmarks. Even my sense of direction, usually to be relied on and upon\r\nwhich I had been tempted to depend solely, seemed to play me false when\r\nwe reached a place where our blazing was lost sight of. The twilight\r\nstillness of the great forest enveloped us; there was no sign of our\r\ncamp, no sound of voices. A few steps to our left the ground fell away\r\nin a steep precipice which, in going, we had passed unnoticed and which,\r\nfor the moment, seemed to obstruct our way. Then turning to the right we\r\nsaw a streak of light through the trees that looked, at first, like\r\nwater where we felt sure no water could be if we were on the right path;\r\nbut we soon recognized this as smoke kept in a low cloud by the\r\ntrees--the smoke of our camp-fire. That was our beacon, and we were soon\r\non the trail again and back in camp. This is not told as an adventure,\r\nbut to illustrate the fact that without a well-blazed trail it is easier\r\nto become lost in a strange forest than to find one\'s way.\r\n\r\nYou may strike the trail with the one object in view of reaching your\r\ndestination as quickly as possible. This will help you to become agile\r\nand sure-footed, to cover long distances in a short time, but it will\r\nnot allow of much observation until your mind has become alert and your\r\neyes trained to see quickly the things of the forests and plains, and to\r\nread their signs correctly. Unless there is necessity for haste, it is\r\nbetter to take more time and look about you as you go. To hurry over the\r\ntrail is to lose much that is of interest and to pass by unseeingly\r\nthings of great beauty. When you are new to the trail and must hurry,\r\nyou are intent only on what is just before you--usually the feet of your\r\nguide--or if you raise your eyes to glance ahead, you notice objects\r\nsimply as things to be reached and passed as quickly as possible.\r\nUnhurried trailing will repay you by showing you what the world of the\r\nwild contains.\r\n\r\nWalking slowly you can realize the solemn stillness of the forest, can\r\ntake in the effect of the gray light which enfolds all things like a\r\nveil of mystery. You can stop to examine the tiny-leafed, creeping vines\r\nthat cover the ground like moss and the structure of the soft mosses\r\nwith fronds like ferns. You can catch the jewel-like gleam of the wood\r\nflowers. You can breathe deeply and rejoice in the perfume of the balsam\r\nand pine. You can rest at intervals and wait quietly for evidences of\r\nthe animal life that you know is lurking, unseen, all around you; and\r\nyou can begin to perceive the protecting spirit of the wild that hovers\r\nover all.\r\n\r\nTo walk securely, as the woodsmen walk, without tripping, stumbling, or\r\nslipping, use the woodsmen\'s method of planting the entire foot on the\r\nground, with toes straight ahead, not turned out. If you put your heel\r\ndown first, while crossing on a slippery log as in ordinary walking, the\r\nnatural result will be a fall. With your entire foot as a base upon\r\nwhich to rest, the body is more easily balanced and the foot less likely\r\nto slip. When people slip and fall on the ice, it is because the edge of\r\nthe heel strikes the ice first and slides. The whole foot on the ice\r\nwould not slip in the same way, and very often not at all.\r\n\r\nTrailing does not consist merely in walking along a path or in making\r\none for yourself. It has a larger meaning than that and embraces various\r\nlines of outdoor life, while it always presupposes movement of some\r\nkind. In one sense going on the trail means going on the hunt. You may\r\ngo on the trail for birds, for animals, for insects, plants, or flowers.\r\nYou may trail a party of friends ahead of you, or follow a deer to its\r\ndrinking-place; and in all these cases you must look for the signs of\r\nthat which you seek.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Footprints or Tracks=\r\n\r\nIn trailing animals look for footprints in soft earth, sand, or snow.\r\nThe hind foot of the muskrat will leave a print in the mud like that of\r\na little hand, and with it will be the fore-foot print, showing but four\r\nshort fingers, and generally the streaks where the hard tail drags\r\nbehind. Fig. 4 shows what these look like. If you are familiar with the\r\ndog track you will know something about the footprints of the fox, wolf,\r\nand coyote, for they are much alike. Fig. 9 gives a clean track of the\r\nfox, but often there is the imprint of hairs between and around the\r\ntoes. A wolf track is larger and is like Fig. 8. The footprint of a deer\r\nshows the cloven hoof, with a difference between the buck\'s and the\r\ndoe\'s. The doe\'s toes are pointed and, when not spread, the track is\r\nalmost heart-shaped (Fig. 7), while the buck has blunter, more rounded\r\ntoes, like Fig. 10. The two round lobes are at the back of the foot,\r\nthe other end points in the direction the deer has taken. Sometimes you\r\nwill find deer tracks with the toes spread wide apart. That means the\r\nanimal has been running. All animals\' toes spread more or less when they\r\nrun. A bear track is like Fig. 11, but a large bear often leaves other\r\nevidences of his presence than his footprints. He will frequently turn a\r\nbig log over or tear one open in his search for ants. He will stand on\r\nhis hind legs and gnaw a hole in a dead tree or tall stump, and a\r\nbee-tree will bear the marks of his climbing on its trunk. It is\r\ninteresting to find a tree with the scars of bruin\'s feet, made\r\nprominent by small knobs where his claws have sunk into the bark. Each\r\nscar swells and stands out like one of his toes. When you see bark\r\nscraped off the trees some distance from the ground, you may be sure\r\nthat a horned animal has passed that way. Where the trees are not far\r\napart a wide-horned animal, like the bull moose, scrapes the bark with\r\nhis antlers as he passes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Footprints of animals.\r\n\r\n1 Caribou\r\n\r\n2 Mink\r\n\r\n3 Red Squirrel\r\n\r\n4 Fore foot of Muskrat, Hind foot of Muskrat, Tail of Muskrat\r\n\r\n5 Fisher\r\n\r\n6 Canada Lynx]\r\n\r\nThe cat-like lynx leaves a cat-like track (Fig. 6), which shows no print\r\nof the claws, and the mink\'s track is like Fig. 2. Rabbits\' tracks are\r\ntwo large oblongs, then two almost round marks. The oblongs are the\r\nprint of the large hind feet, which, with the peculiar gait of the\r\nrabbit, always come first. The large, hind-feet tracks point the\r\ndirection the animal has taken. Fig. 1 is the track of the caribou, and\r\nshows the print of the dew-claws, which are the two little toes up high\r\nat the back of the foot. It is when the earth is soft and the foot sinks\r\nin deeply that the dew-claws leave a print, or perhaps when the foot\r\nspreads wide in running.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Footprints of animals.\r\n\r\n7 Doe\r\n\r\n8 Wolf\r\n\r\n9 Fox\r\n\r\n10 Buck\r\n\r\n11 Bear\r\n\r\n12 Sheep]\r\n\r\nFig. 3 is the print of the foot of a red squirrel. Fig. 5 is the\r\nfisher\'s track, and Fig. 12 is that of a sheep. Pig tracks are much like\r\nthose of sheep, but wider. When you have learned to recognize the\r\nvarying freshness of tracks you will know how far ahead the animal\r\nprobably is. Other tracks you will learn as you become more familiar\r\nwith the animals, and you will also be able to identify the tracks of\r\nthe wild birds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nWOODCRAFT\r\n\r\n=Trees. Practical Use of Compass. Direction of Wind. Star Guiding. What\r\nto Do When Lost in the Woods. How to Chop Wood. How to Fell Trees.=\r\n\r\n\r\n=Trees=\r\n\r\nWhile on the trail you will find a knowledge of trees most useful, and\r\nyou should be able to recognize different species by their manner of\r\ngrowth, their bark and foliage.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Balsam-Fir=\r\n\r\nOne of the most important trees for the trailer to know is the\r\nbalsam-fir, for of this the best of outdoor beds are made. In shape the\r\ntree is like our Christmas-trees--in fact, many Christmas-trees are\r\nbalsam-fir.\r\n\r\nThe sweet, aromatic perfume of the balsam needles is a great aid in\r\nidentifying it. The branches are flat and the needles appear to grow\r\nfrom the sides of the stem. The little twist at the base of the needle\r\ncauses it to seem to grow merely in the straight, outstanding row on\r\neach side of the stem; look closely and you will see the twist.\r\n\r\nThe needles are flat and short, hardly one inch in length; they are\r\ngrooved along the top and the ends are decidedly blunt; in color they\r\nare dark bluish-green on the upper side and silvery-white underneath.\r\nThe bark is gray, and you will find little gummy blisters on the\r\ntree-trunk. From these the healing Canada balsam is obtained. The short\r\ncones, often not over two inches in length, the longest seldom more than\r\nfour inches, stand erect on top of the small branches, and when young\r\nare of a purplish color.\r\n\r\nFrom Maine to Minnesota the balsam-fir grows in damp woods and mountain\r\nbogs, and you will find it southward along the Alleghany Mountains from\r\nPennsylvania to North Carolina.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Spruce=\r\n\r\nThe spruce, red, black, and white, differs in many respects from the\r\nbalsam-fir: the needles are sharp-pointed, not blunt, and instead of\r\nbeing flat like the balsam-fir, they are four-sided and cover the\r\nbranchlet on all sides, causing it to appear rounded or bushy and not\r\nflat. The spruce-gum sought by many is found in the seams of the bark,\r\nwhich, unlike the smooth balsam-fir, is scaly and of a brown color.\r\nEarly spring is the time to look for spruce-gum. Spruce is a soft wood,\r\nsplits readily and is good for the frames and ribs of boats, also for\r\npaddles and oars, and the bark makes a covering for temporary shelters.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Hemlock=\r\n\r\nThis tree is good for thatching a lean-to when balsam-fir is not to be\r\nfound, and its bark can be used in the way of shingles.\r\n\r\nThe cones are small and hang down from the branches; they do not stand\r\nup alert like those of the balsam-fir, nor are they purple in color,\r\nbeing rather of a bright red-brown, and when very young, tan color. The\r\nwood is not easy to split--don\'t try it, or your hatchet will suffer in\r\nconsequence and the pieces will be twisted as a usual thing. The\r\nsouthern variety, however, often splits straight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Horse-chestnut.\r\n\r\nSugar-maple.\r\n\r\nAlder.\r\n\r\nInk impressions of leaves.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Balsam-Fir.\r\n\r\nSpruce.\r\n\r\nHemlock.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: White oak.\r\n\r\nLinden.\r\n\r\nInk impressions of leaves.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Pitch-pine and cone.\r\n\r\nSycamore leaf and fruit of sycamore.\r\n\r\n(The buttonball.)]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pine=\r\n\r\nThe pine-tree accommodates itself to almost any kind of soil, high, low,\r\nmoist, or dry, often growing along the edge of the water.\r\n\r\nThe gray pine is sometimes used for making the skeleton of a canoe or\r\nother boats, and the white pine for the skin or covering of the skeleton\r\nboat; but for you the pine will probably be most useful in furnishing\r\npine-knots, and its soft wood for kindling your outdoor fire.\r\n\r\nThe trees mentioned abound in our northern forests. The birch in its\r\ndifferent varieties is there also, but rarely ventures into the densest\r\nwoods, preferring to remain near and on its outskirts. However, none of\r\nthese trees confine themselves strictly to one locality.\r\n\r\nOaks, hickory, chestnut, maples, and sycamore are among the useful woods\r\nfor campers.\r\n\r\nLearn the quality and nature of the different trees. Each variety is\r\ndistinct from the others: some woods are easy to split, such as spruce,\r\nchestnut, balsam-fir, etc.; some very strong, as locust, oak, hickory,\r\nsugar-maple, etc.; then there are the hard and soft woods mentioned in\r\nfire-making.\r\n\r\nWhen you once understand the characteristics of the different woods, and\r\ntheir special qualifications, becoming familiar with only two or three\r\nvarieties at a time, the trees will be able to help you according to\r\ntheir special powers. You would not go to a musician to have a portrait\r\npainted, for while the musician might give you wonderful music he would\r\nbe helpless as far as painting a picture was concerned, and so it is\r\nwith trees. They cannot all give the same thing; if you want soft wood,\r\nit is wasting your time to go to hardwood trees; they cannot give you\r\nwhat they do not possess. Know the possibilities of trees and they will\r\nnot fail you.\r\n\r\n\r\n=How to Chop Wood=\r\n\r\nTrailing and camping both mean wood-chopping to some extent for\r\nshelters, fires, etc., and the girl of to-day should understand, as did\r\nthe girls of our pioneer families, how to handle properly a hatchet, or\r\nin this case we will make it a belt axe. There is a small hatchet\r\nmodelled after the Daniel Boone tomahawk, generally known as the "camp\r\naxe." It is thicker, narrower, and has a sharper edge than an ordinary\r\nhatchet. It comes of a size to wear on the belt and must be securely\r\nprotected by a well-fitted strong leather sheath; otherwise it will\r\nendanger not only the life of the girl who carries it, but also the\r\nlives of her companions. With the camp axe (hatchet) you can cut down\r\nsmall trees, chop fire-wood, blaze trees, drive down pegs or stakes, and\r\nchop kindling-wood. Every time you want to use the hatchet take the\r\nprecaution to examine it thoroughly and reassure yourself that the tool\r\nis in good condition and that the _head_ is _on firm_ and _tight_; be\r\npositive of this.\r\n\r\nGreat caution must be taken when chopping kindling-wood, as often\r\nserious accidents occur through ignorance or carelessness. Do not raise\r\none end of a stick up on a log with the other end down on the ground and\r\nthen strike the centre of the stick a sharp blow with the sharp edge of\r\nyour hatchet; the stick will break, but one end usually flies up with\r\nconsiderable force and very often strikes the eye of the worker, ruining\r\nthe sight forever. Take the blunt end of your hatchet and do not give a\r\nvery hard blow on the stick you wish to break; exert only force\r\nsufficient to break it partially, merely enough to enable you to finish\r\nthe work with your hands and possibly one knee. It may require a little\r\nmore time, but your eyes will be unharmed, which makes it worth while.\r\nOften children use a heavy stone to break kindling-wood, with no\r\ndisastrous results that I know of. The heavy stone does not seem to\r\ncause the wood to fly upward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Stand on the log when you chop it.\r\n\r\n13 14 15 16\r\n\r\n17 For safety.\r\n\r\nThe stump will be like this on top when the tree is down.\r\n\r\nHow to use the axe.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=How to Chop Logs=\r\n\r\nPractise on small, slender logs, chopping them in short lengths until\r\nyou understand something of the woodsman\'s art of "logging up a tree";\r\nthen and not until then should you attempt to cut heavier wood.\r\n\r\nIf you are sure-footed and absolutely certain that you can stand firmly\r\non the log without teetering or swaying when leaning over, do so. You\r\ncan then chop one side of the log half-way through and turn around and\r\nchop the other side until the second notch or "kerf" is cut through to\r\nthe first one on the opposite side, and the two pieces fall apart. While\r\nworking stand on the log with feet wide apart and chop the _side_ of the\r\nlog (not the top) on the space in front between your feet. Make your\r\nfirst chip quite long, and have it equal in length the diameter of the\r\nlog. If the chip is short, the opening of the kerf will be narrow and\r\nyour hatchet will become wedged, obliging you to double your labor by\r\nenlarging the kerf. Greater progress will be made by chopping diagonally\r\nacross the grain of the wood, and the work will be easier. It is\r\ndifficult to cut squarely against the grain and this is always avoided\r\nwhen possible. After you have cut the first chip in logging up a tree,\r\nchop on the base of the chip, swinging your hatchet from the opposite\r\ndirection, and the chip will fall to the ground.\r\n\r\nHaving successfully chopped off one piece of the log, it will be a\r\nsimple matter to cut off more. Chop slowly, easily, and surely. Don\'t be\r\nin a hurry and exhaust yourself; only a novice overexerts and tries to\r\nmake a deep cut with the hatchet.\r\n\r\nBe careful of the blade of your hatchet; keep it free from the ground\r\nwhen chopping, to avoid striking snags, stones, or other things liable\r\nto nick or dull the edge.\r\n\r\n\r\n=How to Fell a Tree=\r\n\r\nContent yourself with chopping down only slender trees, mere saplings,\r\nat first, and as you acquire skill, slightly heavier trees can be\r\nfelled. Begin in the right way with your very first efforts and follow\r\nthe woodsman\'s method.\r\n\r\nHaving selected the tree you desire to cut down, determine in which\r\ndirection you want it to fall and mark that side, but first make sure\r\nthat when falling, the tree will not lodge in another one near by or\r\ndrop on one of the camp shelters. See that the way is free of hindrance\r\nbefore cutting the tree, also _clear the way_ for the swing of your\r\nextended _hatchet_. If there are obstacles, such as vines, bushes, limbs\r\nof other trees, or rocks, which your hatchet might strike as you raise\r\nand lower it while at work, clear them all away, making a generous open\r\nspace on all sides, overhead, on the right and left side, and below the\r\nswing of the hatchet. Take no chance of having an accident, as would\r\noccur should the hatchet become entangled or broken.\r\n\r\nYou may have noticed that the top surface of most stumps has a\r\nsplintered ridge across its centre, and on one side of the ridge the\r\nwood is lower than on the other; this is because of the manner in which\r\na woodsman fells a tree. If he wants the tree to fall toward the west he\r\nmarks the west side of the trunk; then he marks the top and bottom of\r\nthe space he intends chopping out for the first kerf or notch (Fig. 13,\r\n_A_ and _B_), making the length of space a trifle longer than one-half\r\nof the tree diameter. The kerf is chopped out by cutting first from the\r\ntop _A_, then from the bottom _B_ (Fig. 14). When the first kerf is\r\nfinished and cut half-way through the tree, space for the kerf on the\r\nopposite side of the tree is marked a few inches higher than the first\r\none (Fig. 15, _C_ and _D_) and then it also is cut (Fig. 16).\r\n\r\nAfter you have chopped the two kerfs in a tree, you will know when it is\r\nabout to fall by the creaking and the slight movement of its top. Step\r\nto _one side_ of the falling tree, never behind or in front of it;\r\neither of the last two ways would probably mean death: if in front, the\r\ntree would fall on you, and if at the back, you would probably be\r\nterribly injured if not killed, as trees often kick backward with\r\ntremendous force as they go down; so be on your guard, keep cool, and\r\ndeliberately step to the side of the tree and watch it fall.\r\n\r\nChoose a quiet day, when there is no wind, for tree-felling. You cannot\r\ncontrol the wind, and it may control your tree.\r\n\r\nNever allow your hatchet to lie on the ground, a menace to every one at\r\ncamp, but have a particular log or stump and always strike the blade in\r\nthis wood. Leave your hatchet there, where it will not be injured, can\r\ndo no harm, and you will always know where to find it (Fig. 17).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Etiquette of the Wild=\r\n\r\nTranslated this means "_hands off_." The unwritten law of the woods is\r\nthat personal property cached in trees, underbrush, beneath stones, or\r\nhidden underground must never be _taken_, _borrowed_, _used_, or\r\n_molested_.\r\n\r\nCanoes and oars will often be discovered left by owners, sometimes\r\nfastened at the water\'s edge, again suspended from trees, and the\r\ntemptation to borrow may be strong, but remember such an act would be\r\ndishonorable and against the rules that govern the outdoor world.\r\n\r\nProvisions, tools, or other articles found in the forests should be\r\nrespected and allowed to remain where they are. It is customary for\r\ncampers to cache their belongings with the assurance that forest\r\netiquette will be held inviolate and their goods remain unmolested.\r\n\r\nEvery one has the privilege of examining and enjoying the beauties of\r\nmosses, berries, and wild flowers, but do not take these treasures from\r\ntheir homes to die and be thrown aside. Love them well enough to let\r\nthem stay where they are for others also to enjoy, unless you need\r\nspecimens for some important special study.\r\n\r\nA man who had always lived in the Adirondack forests, and at present is\r\nproprietor of an Adirondack hotel, recently reforested many acres of his\r\nwooded wild lands by planting through the forests little young trees,\r\nsome not over one foot high, and his indignation was great when he\r\ndiscovered that many of his guests when off on tramps returned laden\r\nwith these baby trees, which were easily pulled up by the roots because\r\nso lately planted.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Finding Your Way by Natural Signs and the Compass=\r\n\r\nAn important phase of woodcraft is the ability to find your way in the\r\nwilderness by means of natural signs as well as the compass. If,\r\nhowever, you do not know at what point of the compass from you the camp\r\nlies, the signs can be of no avail. Having this knowledge, the signs\r\nwill be invaluable.\r\n\r\n_Get your bearings before leaving camp._ Do not depend upon any member\r\nof the party, but know for yourself.\r\n\r\nIf you have a map giving the topography of land surrounding the\r\ncamping-grounds, consult it. Burn into your memory the direction _from_\r\ncamp of outlying landmarks, those near and those as far off as you can\r\nsee in all directions. The morning you leave camp, ascertain the\r\ndirection of the wind and notice particularly the sun and shadows. If\r\nit is early morning, face the sun and you will be looking toward the\r\neast. Stretch out both arms at your sides and point with your\r\nindex-fingers; your right finger will point to the south, your left to\r\nthe north, and your back will be toward the west. What landmarks do you\r\nsee east of the camp? South? North? West? And from what point of the\r\ncompass does the wind blow? If it comes from the west and you trail\r\neastward, the wind will strike your back going away from camp and should\r\nstrike your face returning, provided its direction does not change.\r\nAgain, if you go east, your camp will lie west of you, and your homeward\r\npath must be westward. Consult your compass and know exactly which\r\ndirection you take when leaving camp, and blaze your trail as you go,\r\nlooking backward frequently to see how landmarks should appear as you\r\nface them returning.\r\n\r\nWith all these friends to guide you, first, the map; second, sun; third,\r\nshadows; fourth, wind; fifth, compass; sixth, your bent-twig blazing,\r\nthere will be little, if any, danger of being lost. But you must\r\nconstantly keep on the alert and refer frequently to these guides,\r\nespecially when deflecting from the course first taken after leaving\r\ncamp. At every turning, stop and take your bearings anew; you cannot be\r\ntoo careful.\r\n\r\nThese signs are for daylight; at night the North Star will be your\r\nguide.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sunlight and Shadow=\r\n\r\nBearing in mind that the sun rises in the east and sets in the west, it\r\nwill be comparatively easy to keep your right course by consulting the\r\nsun. A fair idea may also be gained of the time of day by the length of\r\nshadows, if you remember that shadows are long in the morning and\r\ncontinue to grow shorter until midday, when they again begin to\r\nlengthen, growing longer and longer until night.\r\n\r\nTo find the direction of the sun on a cloudy day, hold a flat splinter\r\nor your knife blade vertically, so that it is absolutely straight up and\r\ndown. Place the point of the blade on your thumb-nail, watch-case, or\r\nother glossy surface; then turn the knife or splinter around until the\r\nfull shadow of the flat of blade or splinter falls on the bright\r\nsurface, telling the location of the sun.\r\n\r\nAn open spot where the sun can cast a clear shadow, and an hour when the\r\nsun is not immediately overhead, will give best results.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Wind=\r\n\r\nThe wind generally blows in the same direction all day, and if you learn\r\nto understand its ways, the wind will help you keep the right trail.\r\nMake a practise of testing the direction of the wind every morning.\r\nNotice the leaves on bush and tree, in what direction they move. Place a\r\nfew bits of paper on your open hand and watch in which way the wind\r\ncarries them; if there is no paper, try the test with dry leaves, grass,\r\nor anything light and easily carried by the breeze. Smoke will also show\r\nthe direction of the wind.\r\n\r\nWhen the wind is very faint, put your finger in your mouth, wet it on\r\nall sides, and hold it up; the side on which the wind blows will feel\r\ncool and tell from what quarter the wind comes: if on the east side of\r\nyour finger, the wind blows from the east, and so on. Keep testing the\r\ndirection of the wind as you trail, and if at any time it cools a\r\ndifferent side of the finger, you will know that you are not walking in\r\nthe same direction as when you left camp and must turn until the wet\r\nfinger tells you which way to go. The wind is a good guide so long as\r\nit keeps blowing in the same direction as when you left camp.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Use of Compass=\r\n\r\nShould you be on the trail and sudden storm-clouds appear, the sun\r\ncannot help you find your way; the shadows have gone. Moss on\r\ntree-trunks is not an infallible guide and you must turn to the compass\r\nto show the way, but unless you understand its language you will not\r\nknow what it is telling you. Learn the language before going to camp; it\r\nis not difficult.\r\n\r\nHold the compass out in a _level position_ directly in front of you; be\r\n_sure_ it is level; then decide to go north. Consult the compass and\r\nascertain in which direction the north lies. The compass needle points\r\ndirectly north with the north end of the needle; this end is usually\r\nblack, sometimes pearl. Let your eye follow straight along the line\r\npointed out by the needle; as you look ahead select a landmark--tree,\r\nrock, pond, or whatever may lie in that direction. Choose an object\r\nquite a distance off on the imaginary line, go directly toward it, and\r\nwhen intervening objects obscure the landmark, refer to your compass. If\r\nyou have turned from the pathway north, face around and readjust your\r\nsteps in the right direction. Do not let over two minutes pass without\r\nmaking sure by the compass that you are going on the right path, going\r\ndirectly north.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mariner\'s Compass.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Common Compass.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Big Dipper.\r\n\r\nLittle Dipper.\r\n\r\nThe compass and the North Star.]\r\n\r\nPractise using the compass for a guide until you understand it; have\r\nfaith in it and you may fearlessly trust to its guidance. Try going\r\naccording to various points of the compass: suppose you wish to go\r\nsoutheast, the compass tells you this as plainly as the north; try it.\r\nNaturally, if you go to the southeast away from camp, returning will\r\nbe in exactly the opposite direction, and coming back to camp you must\r\nwalk northwest. After learning to go in a straight line, guided entirely\r\nby the compass, try a zigzag path. A group of girls will find it good\r\nsport to practise trailing with the compass, and they will at the same\r\ntime learn how to avoid being lost and how to help others find their\r\nway. It is possible to\r\n\r\n\r\n=Make a Compass of Your Watch=\r\n\r\nBesides keeping you company with its friendly nearness, its ticking and\r\nits ready answers to your questions regarding the time, a watch in the\r\nwoods and fields has another use, for it can be used as a compass. It\r\nwill show just where the south is, then by turning your back on the\r\nsouth you face the north, and on your right is the east and on your left\r\nthe west. These are the rules:\r\n\r\nWith your watch in a horizontal position point the hour-hand to the sun,\r\nand if before noon, half-way between the hour hand and 12 is due south.\r\nIf it is afternoon calculate the opposite way. For instance, if at 8 A.\r\nM. you point the hour-hand to the sun, 10 will point to the south, for\r\nthat is half-way between 8 and 12. If at 2 P. M. you point the hour-hand\r\nto the sun, look back to 12, and half the distance will be at 1,\r\ntherefore 1 points to the south.\r\n\r\nAn easy way to get the direction of the sun without looking directly at\r\nit is by means of the shadow of a straight, slender stick or grass stem\r\nthrown on the horizontal face of your watch. Hold the stick upright with\r\nthe lower end touching the watch at the _point_ of the hour-hand, then\r\nturn the watch until the shadow of the stick falls along the hour-hand.\r\nThis will point the hand undeviatingly toward the sun.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mountain Climbing=\r\n\r\nThe campers should go together to climb the mountain, never one girl\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nBefore starting, find a strong stick to use as a staff; stow away some\r\nluncheon in one of your pockets; see that your camera is in perfect\r\norder, ready to use at a moment\'s notice; that your water-proof\r\nmatch-box is in your pocket filled with safety matches, your\r\npocket-knife safe with you, also watch and compass, and that the tin cup\r\nis on your belt. Your whistle being always hung around your neck will,\r\nof course, be there as usual.\r\n\r\nWhen you are ready, stand still and look about you once more to make\r\nsure of your bearings; close your eyes and tell yourself exactly what\r\nyou have seen. After leaving camp and arriving at the foot of the\r\nmountain, take your bearings anew; then look up ahead and select a\r\ncertain spot which you wish to reach on the upward trail. Having this\r\ndefinite object in view will help in making better progress and save\r\nyour walking around in a circle, which is always the tendency when in a\r\nstrange place and intervening trees or elevations obstruct the view, or\r\nwhen not sure of the way and trying to find it.\r\n\r\nBegin blazing the trail at your first step up the mountain side. Even\r\nthough there may be a trail already, you cannot be sure that it will\r\ncontinue; it is much safer to depend upon your own blazing.\r\n\r\nOften in trailing along the mountain you will find huge rocks and steep\r\ndepressions, or small lakes which you cannot cross over but must go\r\naround, and in so doing change your direction, perhaps strike off at an\r\nangle. Before making the detour, search out some large landmark, readily\r\nrecognized after reaching the other side of the obstruction, a tall,\r\npeculiarly shaped tree or other natural feature. Now is the time to try\r\nearnestly to keep the landmark in sight as long as possible and to be\r\nable to recognize it when you see it again. Watch your compass and the\r\nsun that you may continue in the right direction after circling the\r\nobstruction. Go slow in climbing, take your time and don\'t get out of\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\nOn many mountains the possibility of unexpected fogs exists, and safety\r\nrequires that the party be linked together with a soft rope; the same\r\nprecaution should be taken when the trail is very rough, steep, and\r\nrocky. The camper at the head of the line should tie the rope in a\r\nbow-line around her waist, with knot on left side, and eight or ten feet\r\nfrom her the next girl should link herself to the rope in the same\r\nmanner; then another girl, and another, until the entire party is on the\r\nrope.\r\n\r\nThe leader starts on the trail and the others, holding fast to their\r\nstaffs, carefully follow, each one cautious to keep the rope stretching\r\nout in front of her rather taut; then if one girl stumbles the others\r\nbrace themselves and keep her from falling.\r\n\r\nWhen descending the mountain, be careful to get a firm footing. Instead\r\nof facing the trail, it is safer to turn sideways, so that you can place\r\nthe entire foot down and not risk the toes only, or the heels. Often\r\ncoming down either a steep hill or a mountain is more difficult than\r\ngoing up.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Lost in the Woods=\r\n\r\nIt is not at all probable that you will lose your way while on the\r\ntrail, but if you should find yourself lost in the woods or in the open,\r\nthe first thing to do is to remember that a brave girl does not get into\r\na panic and so rob herself of judgment and the power to think clearly\r\nand act quickly. Believe firmly that you are _safe_, then sit down\r\nquietly and think out a plan of finding your way. Try to remember from\r\nwhich direction you have come and to recall landmarks. If you cannot do\r\nthis, do not be frightened and do not allow any thought of possible harm\r\nto get a foothold in your mind. If there is a hill near, from which you\r\ncan see any distance, climb that and get an outlook. You may be able to\r\nsee the smoke of your camp-fire, which, after all, cannot be so far\r\naway. You may find a landmark that you do remember. If you see nothing\r\nwhich you can recognize, make a signal flag of your handkerchief and put\r\nit up high, as high as you can. Your friends will be looking for that.\r\nThen give the lost signal, one long blast with your whistle, and after a\r\nshort pause follow with two more blasts in quick succession. If you have\r\nno whistle shout, loud and long, then wait a while, keeping eyes and\r\nears open to see and hear answering signals. If there is none, again\r\nshout the lost signal and continue the calls every little while for\r\nquite a time. Another call for help is the ascending smoke of three\r\nfires. This, of course, is for daylight. Build your fires some distance\r\napart, twenty-five feet or more, that the smoke from each may be clearly\r\nseen alone, not mingled with the rest. Aim to create _smoke_ rather than\r\nflame; a slender column of smoke can be seen a long distance, therefore\r\nthe fire need not be large. Choose for your fires as clear a space and\r\nas high an elevation as can be found, and in the relief and excitement\r\nof rescue _do not forget to extinguish every spark_ before leaving the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nIf you decide to keep moving, blaze your trail as you go, so that it may\r\nbe followed and also that you may know if you cross it again yourself.\r\nYou can blaze the trail by breaking or bending small branches on trees\r\nand bushes, or by small strips torn from your handkerchief and tied\r\nconspicuously on twigs. If you are where there are no trees or\r\nundergrowth, build small piles of stones or little hills of earth at\r\nintervals to mark your trail.\r\n\r\nIf night overtakes you, look for the _North Star_. That will help if you\r\nknow at what point of the compass your camp lies, and if you remember\r\nwhether your course in leaving camp was to the north, south, east, or\r\nwest, you can calculate pretty accurately whether the camp is to the\r\nnorth, south, east, or west of you.\r\n\r\nIn case the night must be spent where you are, go about making a\r\nshelter, prepare as comfortable a bed as possible, and do _not_ be\r\nafraid. You will probably be found before morning, and you must be found\r\nin good physical condition.\r\n\r\nIf you can kindle a fire, do it; that will help to guide your friends\r\nand will ward off wild creatures that might startle you. Keep your fire\r\ngoing all night and take care that it does not spread.\r\n\r\nIt is better to remain quietly in one spot all night than to wander\r\nabout in the dark and perhaps stumble upon dangerous places. If, when\r\nyou find the points of the compass by the _North Star_, you mark them\r\nplainly on a stone or fallen log, they will be a ready guide for you as\r\nsoon as daylight breaks.\r\n\r\nThe last word on this subject is: _Do not be afraid_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=To Find Your Way by the North Star=\r\n\r\nAt night you will have the same reliable guide that has ever been the\r\nmariner\'s friend, and if you do not know this star guide, lose no time\r\nin finding it.\r\n\r\nPolaris or pole-star is known generally as North Star, and this star is\r\nmost important to the outdoor girl. At all times the North Star marks\r\nthe north, its position never changes, and seeing that star and _knowing\r\nit_, you will always know the points of the compass. Face the North\r\nStar and you face the north. At your right hand is the east, at your\r\nleft hand is the west, and at your back is the south.\r\n\r\nThe North Star does not look very important because it is not very\r\nbright or very large, and were it not for the help of the Big Dipper,\r\nwhich every one knows, the North Star would not be easy to find. The\r\ndiagram given on page 37 shows the relative position of the stars and\r\nwill help you to find the North Star. The two stars forming the front\r\nside of the bowl of the Great Dipper point almost in a direct line to\r\nthe North Star, which is the last one in the handle of the Little\r\nDipper, or the tail of the Little Bear, which means the same thing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nCAMPING\r\n\r\n=Camp Sites. Water. Wood. Tents. Shelters. Lean-Tos. Fires. Cooking.\r\nSafety and Protection. Sanitation. Camp Spirit.=\r\n\r\n\r\n=Information=\r\n\r\nWhether your camp is to be for one day, one week, or a longer period of\r\ntime, the first question to be decided is: "Where shall we go?" If you\r\nknow of no suitable spot, inquire of friends, and even if they have not\r\npersonally enjoyed the delights of camping and sleeping in the open, one\r\nor more of them will probably know of some acquaintance who will be glad\r\nto give the information. Write to the various newspapers, magazines,\r\nrailroads, and outdoor societies for suggestions. The Geological Survey\r\nof the United States at Washington, D. C., will furnish maps giving\r\nlocation and extent of forests and water-ways, also location and\r\ncharacter of roads; you can obtain the maps for almost any part of every\r\nState. Most public automobile houses supply maps of any desired region.\r\nSend letters of inquiry to these sources of information, and in this way\r\nyou will probably learn of many "just the right place" localities.\r\nSelect a number of desirable addresses, investigate them, and make your\r\nown choice of location, remembering that the first three essentials for\r\na camp are good ground, water, and wood; the rest is easy, for these\r\nthree form the foundation for camping.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Location=\r\n\r\nWherever you go, choose a dry spot, preferably in an open space near\r\nwooded land. Avoid hollows where the water will run into your shelters\r\nin wet weather; let your camp be so located that in case of rain the\r\nwater will drain down away from it. Remember this or you may find your\r\ncamp afloat upon a temporary lake or swamp should a storm arise.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Water=\r\n\r\nPure drinking water you _must_ have, it is of _vital_ importance, so be\r\nsure to pitch your camp within near walking distance of a good spring, a\r\nsecurely covered well, or other supply of pure water.\r\n\r\nHenry David Thoreau\'s method of obtaining clear water from a pond whose\r\nsurface was covered with leaves, etc., was to push his pail, without\r\ntipping it in the least, straight down under the water until the top\r\nedge was below the surface several inches, then quickly lift it out; in\r\ndoing this the overflow would carry off all leaves and twigs, leaving\r\nthe remaining water in the pail clear and good. But you must first be\r\nsure that the pond contains pure water under the floating d\xc3\xa9bris.\r\n\r\nAlways be cautious about drinking water from rivers, streams, ponds, and\r\nlakes though they may appear ever so clear and tempting, for the purity\r\nis by no means assured, and to drink from these sources may cause\r\nserious illness. Unless you are absolutely sure that water is free from\r\nimpurities, _boil it_; then it will be safe to use for drinking and\r\ncooking.\r\n\r\nNext in importance to good water is good fire-wood and woodsy material\r\nfor shelters and beds. Bear this in mind when deciding upon the site for\r\nyour camp.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Companions=\r\n\r\nBecause your companions can make or mar the happiness in camp, it is\r\nsafer to have in your party only those girls who will take kindly to the\r\ncamp spirit of friendly helpfulness, those always ready to laugh and\r\ntreat discomforts as jokes. This means that though fun-loving and full\r\nof buoyancy and life, each girl will willingly do her part and assume\r\nher share of responsibilities.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Safeguarding=\r\n\r\nYou should also count among your companions two or more camp\r\ndirectors--possibly mothers of the girls, teachers, or older friends of\r\nwhom the parents approve--who will enter heartily into all phases of\r\noutdoor life and while really being one with you in sport and work, will\r\nat the same time keep careful oversight and assure protection.\r\n\r\nAvoid localities where there is a possibility of tramps or undesirable\r\ncharacters of any description, and do not wander from camp alone or\r\nunaccompanied by one of the directors. If your camp is in the forest it\r\nwill be the part of wisdom to secure also a reliable guide who knows the\r\nforest ways.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Start=\r\n\r\nThe day before you leave for your camping-ground, have everything in\r\nreadiness that there may be no delay when it is time to go. Be prompt,\r\nfor you want to play fair and not keep the other girls waiting, causing\r\nthem to lose valuable time.\r\n\r\nThe stimulating exhilaration which comes with trailing through the\r\nforests to camp, the keen delight of adventure, the charm of the\r\nwilderness, the freedom and wonder of living in the woods, all make for\r\nthe health and happiness of the girl camper, and once experienced, ever\r\nafter with the advent of spring comes the call of the untrammelled life\r\nin the big outdoors.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The One-Day Camp=\r\n\r\nEven a one-day camp fills the hours with more genuine lasting enjoyment\r\nthan girls can find in other ways; there is a charm about it which\r\nclings in your memory, making a joy, later, of the mere thought and\r\ntelling of the event.\r\n\r\nThat every moment of the day may be filled full of enjoyment for all,\r\nhave a good programme, some definite, well-thought-out plan of\r\nactivities and sports previously prepared, and if possible let every\r\ngirl know beforehand just what she is to do when all arrive at camp.\r\n\r\nWith an older person in charge, the party could be divided, according to\r\nits size, into different groups, and as soon as the grounds are reached\r\nthe groups should begin the fun of preparing for the camp dinner.\r\n\r\nIf the party consists of eight, two can gather fire-wood, two build the\r\nfireplace, two unpack the outfits, placing the provisions and cooking\r\nutensils in order conveniently near the fire, and two can bring the\r\ndrinking water and cooking water.\r\n\r\nProvisions and cooking utensils should be divided into as many packs as\r\nthere are campers, and every camper carry a pack. Count in the outfit\r\nfor each one a tin cup, preferably with open handle for wearing over\r\nbelt.\r\n\r\nIn the one-day camp very few cooking utensils are needed; they may\r\nconsist of two tin pails, one for drinking water, the other for boiling\r\nwater, one coffee-pot for cocoa, one frying-pan for flapjacks or eggs,\r\none large kitchen knife for general use, and one large spoon for\r\nstirring batter and cocoa.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Camp Dinner=\r\n\r\nCounting on a keen outdoor appetite for wholesome substantials, the\r\nprovision list includes only plain fare, such as: Lamb chops, or thinly\r\nsliced bacon packed in oil-paper. Dry cocoa to which sugar has been\r\nadded, carried in can or stout paper bag. One can of condensed milk,\r\nunsweetened, to be diluted with water according to directions on can.\r\nButter in baking-powder can. Dry flour mixed with salt and baking-powder\r\nin required proportions for flapjacks, packed in strong paper bag and\r\ncarried in one of the tin pails. Bread in loaf wrapped in wax-paper.\r\nPotatoes washed and dried ready to cook, packed in paper bag or carried\r\nin second tin pail. Pepper and salt each sealed in separate marked\r\nenvelopes; when needed, perforate paper with big pin and use envelopes\r\nas shakers. One egg for batter, buried in the flour to prevent breaking,\r\nand one small can of creamy maple sugar, soft enough to spread on hot\r\ncakes, or a can of ordinary maple syrup.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Clean-Up=\r\n\r\nWhile resting after dinner is the time for story-telling; then, before\r\ntaking part in sports of any kind, every particle of d\xc3\xa9bris, even small\r\nbits of egg-shell and paper, should be gathered up and burned until not\r\na vestige remains. To be "good sports," thought must be taken for the\r\nnext comers and the camping-ground left in perfect order, absolutely\r\nfree from litter or d\xc3\xa9bris of any kind.\r\n\r\nWhen breaking camp be _sure_ to soak the fire with water again and\r\nagain. It is criminal to leave any coals or even a spark of the fire\r\nsmouldering.\r\n\r\nBe _positive_ that the _fire is out_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A permanent camp.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Shelters and Tents. Lean-To=\r\n\r\nFor a fixed camp of longer or shorter duration your home will be under\r\nthe shelter of boughs, logs, or canvas. The home of green boughs is\r\nconsidered by many the ideal of camp shelters. This you can make for\r\nyourself. It is a simple little two-sided, slanting roof and back and\r\nopen-front shed, made of the material of the woods and generally known\r\nas a lean-to, sometimes as Baker tent when of canvas.\r\n\r\nThere are three ways of erecting the front framework.\r\n\r\nThe first is to find two trees standing about seven feet apart with\r\nconvenient branches down low enough to support the horizontal top cross\r\npole when laid in the crotches. Lacking the proper trees, the second\r\nmethod is to get two strong, straight, forked poles of green wood and\r\ndrive them down into the ground deep enough to make them stand firm and\r\nupright by themselves the required distance apart. The third way is to\r\nreinforce the uprights by shorter forked stakes driven firmly into the\r\nground and braced against the uprights, but this is not often necessary.\r\n\r\nHaving your uprights in place, extending above ground five feet or more,\r\nlay a top pole across, fitting its ends into the forked tops of the\r\nuprights. Against this top pole rest five or six slender poles at\r\nregular distances apart, one end of each against the top pole and the\r\nother end on the ground slanting outward and backward sufficiently to\r\ngive a good slope and allow sleeping space beneath. At right angles to\r\nthe slanting poles, lay across them other poles, using the natural pegs\r\nor stumps left on the slanting poles by lopped-off branches, as braces\r\nto hold the cross poles in place (Fig. 18).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 18\r\n\r\n21 19\r\n\r\n20\r\n\r\nOutdoor shelters.]\r\n\r\nWhen building the frame be sure to place the slanting poles so that\r\nthe little stumps left on them will turn _up_ and not down, that they\r\nmay hold the cross poles. Try to have spaces between cross poles as\r\nregular as possible. A log may be rolled up against the ground ends of\r\nthe slanting poles to prevent their slipping, though this is rarely\r\nnecessary, for they stand firm as a rule.\r\n\r\nYou can cover the frame with bark and then thatch it, which will render\r\nthe shelter better able to withstand a storm, or you may omit the bark,\r\nusing only the thatch as a covering. Put on very thick, this should make\r\nthe lean-to rain-proof.\r\n\r\nWith small tips of branches from trees, preferably balsam, hemlock, or\r\nother evergreens, begin thatching your shelter. Commence at the bottom\r\nof the lean-to, and hook on the thatch branches close together all the\r\nway across the lowest cross pole, using the stumps of these thatch\r\nbranches as hooks to hold the thatch in place on the cross pole (Fig.\r\n19). Overlap the lower thatches as you work along the next higher cross\r\npole, like shingles on a house, and continue in this way, overlapping\r\neach succeeding cross pole with an upper row of thatch until the top is\r\nreached. Fill in the sides thick with branches, boughs, or even small,\r\nthick trees.\r\n\r\nThe lean-to frame can be covered with your poncho in case of necessity,\r\nbut boughs are much better.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Permanent Camp. Lean-To. Open Camp=\r\n\r\nAnother kind of lean-to intended for a permanent camp is in general use\r\nthroughout the Adirondacks. It is built of substantial good-sized logs\r\nput together log-cabin fashion, with open front, slanting roof, and low\r\nback (Fig. 20). This shelter has usually a board floor raised a few\r\ninches above the ground and covered thick, at least a foot deep, with\r\nbalsam. Overspread with blankets, the soft floor forms a comfortable\r\nbed. A log across the front of the floor keeps the balsam in place and\r\nforms a seat for the campers in the evenings when gathered for a social\r\ntime before the fire. The roof of the log lean-to can be either of\r\nboards or well-thatched poles which have first been overlaid with bark.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 23 24\r\n\r\n22\r\n\r\nDining-tent, handy racks, and log bedstead.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most comfortable and delightful of real forest camps which I\r\nhave ever been in, was a permanent camp in the Adirondacks owned and run\r\nby one of the best of Adirondack guides. The camp consisted of several\r\nshelters and two big permanent fireplaces.\r\n\r\nOver the ground space for the large tent outlined with logs was a strong\r\nsubstantial rustic frame, built of material at hand in the forest and\r\nintended to last many seasons (Fig. 21). The shelter boasted of two\r\nspringy, woodsy beds, made of slender logs laid crosswise and raised\r\nsome inches from the ground. These slender logs slanted down slightly\r\nfrom head to foot of the bed, and the edges of the bed were built high\r\nenough to hold the deep thick filling of balsam tips, so generously deep\r\nas to do away with all consciousness of the underlying slender-log\r\nfoundation (Fig. 22). Each bed was wide enough for two girls and the\r\nshelter ample to accommodate comfortably four campers. There could have\r\nbeen one more bed, when the tent would have sheltered six girls.\r\n\r\nIn the late fall, the guide removed the water-proof tent covering and\r\nkept it in a safe, dry place until needed, leaving the beds and bare\r\ntent frame standing.\r\n\r\nThere was a smaller tent and also a lean-to in this camp.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A forest camp by the water.]\r\n\r\nThe dining-table, contrived of logs and boards, was sheltered by a\r\nsquare of canvas on a rustic frame (Fig. 23). The camp dishes of white\r\nenamel ware were kept in a wooden box, nailed to a close-by tree; in\r\nthis box the guide had put shelves, resting them on wooden cleats. The\r\ncupboard had a door that shut tight and fastened securely to keep out\r\nthe little wild creatures of the woods. Pots, kettles, frying-pan, etc.,\r\nhung on the stubs of a slender tree where branches and top had been\r\nlopped off (Fig. 24). The sealed foods were stowed away in a box\r\ncupboard, and canned goods were cached in a cave-like spot under a huge\r\nrock, with opening secured by stones.\r\n\r\nThe walls of the substantial fireplace, fully two feet high, were of big\r\nstones, the centre filled in part-way with earth, and the cook-fire was\r\nmade on top of the earth, so there was not the slightest danger of the\r\nfire spreading.\r\n\r\nThe soft, warm, cheerful-colored camp blankets when not in use were\r\nstored carefully under cover of a water-proof tent-like storehouse, with\r\nthe canvas sides dropped from the ridge-pole, both sides and flaps\r\nsecurely fastened and the entire storehouse made proof against\r\nintrusion.\r\n\r\nThis camp was located near a lake in the mountain forest and its charm\r\nwas indescribably delightful.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Tents=\r\n\r\nTents in almost endless variety of shapes and sizes are manufactured and\r\nsold by camp-outfitters and sporting-goods shops. The tents range from\r\nsmall canoe-tents, accommodating one person only, to the large\r\nwall-tents for four or more people. When using tents, difficulties of\r\ntransportation and extra weight can be overcome by having tent poles and\r\npegs cut in the forest.\r\n\r\nIf you purchase tents, full instructions for erection go with them.\r\nWrite for illustrated catalogues to various outfitters and look the\r\nbooks over carefully before buying. Your choice will depend upon your\r\nparty, length of stay, and location of camp.\r\n\r\nYou may be able to secure a discarded army-tent that has never been\r\nused, is in good condition, and has been condemned merely for some\r\nunimportant blemish. Such tents are very serviceable and can be\r\npurchased at Government auctions, or from dealers who themselves have\r\nbought them from the Government.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: In camp.]\r\n\r\nA large square seven by seven feet, or more, of balloon silk,\r\nwater-proof cloth, or even heavy unbleached sheeting, will be found most\r\nuseful in camp. Sew strong tape strings at the four corners and at\r\nintervals along the sides for tying to shelters, etc. The water-proof\r\ncloth will serve as a drop-curtain in front of the lean-to during a hard\r\nstorm, or as carpet cloth over ground of shelter, also as an extra\r\nshelter, either lean-to or tent style; any of the three materials can do\r\nduty as windbreak, fly to shelter, or dining canopy, and may be used in\r\nother ways.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Camp-Beds=\r\n\r\nTo derive joy and strength from your outing it is of serious importance\r\nthat you sleep well every night while at camp, and your camp-bed must be\r\ncomfortable to insure a good night\'s rest.\r\n\r\nA bough-bed is one of the joys of the forest when it is _well made_, and\r\nto put it together properly will require about half an hour\'s time, but\r\nthe delight of sleeping on a soft balsam bed perfumed with the pungent\r\nodors of the balsam will well repay for the time expended.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 25 26\r\n\r\nThe bough-bed, the cook-fire, and the wall-tent.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Bough-Bed=\r\n\r\nTips of balsam broken off with your fingers about fourteen inches long\r\nmake the best of beds, but hemlock, spruce, and other evergreens can be\r\nused; if they are not obtainable, the fan-like branches from other trees\r\nmay take their place. Of these you will need a large quantity, in\r\norder to have the bed springy and soft. Always place the outdoor bed\r\nwith the head well under cover and foot toward the opening of shelter,\r\nor if without shelter, toward the fire. Make the bed by arranging the\r\nbranches shingle-like in _very_ thick overlapping rows, convex side up,\r\ndirectly on the ground with _thick end_ of stems _toward_ the _foot_.\r\nPush these ends into the ground so that the tips will be raised\r\nslantingly up from the earth; make the rows which will come under the\r\nhips extra thick and springy. Continue placing the layers in this manner\r\nuntil the space for single or double bed, as the case may be, is covered\r\nwith the first layer of your green mattress. Over it make another layer\r\nof branches, reversing the ends of these tips from those underneath by\r\npushing the _thick ends_ of branches of this top layer slantingly into\r\nthe under layer _toward_ the _head_ of the bed with tips toward the\r\nfoot. Make more layers, until the bed is about two feet thick (Fig. 25);\r\nthen cover the mattress thus made with your poncho, rubber side down,\r\nand on top spread one of the sleeping blankets, using the other one as a\r\ncover. Be sure to allow plenty of time for this work and have the bed\r\ndry and soft.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Bag-Bed=\r\n\r\nWhen the camp is located where there is no material for a bough-bed,\r\neach girl can carry with her a bag three feet wide and six and one-half\r\nfeet long, made of strong cloth, ticking, soft khaki, or like material,\r\nto be filled with leaves, grass, or other browse found on or near the\r\ncamp-grounds. Such a mattress made up with poncho and blankets is very\r\nsatisfactory, but it must be well filled, so that when you lie on the\r\nmattress it will not mash flat and hard.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cot-Bed=\r\n\r\nFor an entire summer camp army cots which fold for packing are good and\r\nvery comfortable with a doubled, thick quilt placed on top for a\r\nmattress.\r\n\r\nThe sporting-goods stores show a great variety of other beds, cots, and\r\nsleeping-bags, and a line to them will bring illustrated catalogues, or,\r\nif in the city, you can call and see the goods.\r\n\r\nAny of the beds I have described, however, can be used to advantage, and\r\nI heartily endorse the _well-made_ bough-bed, especially if of balsam.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pillows=\r\n\r\nMake a bag one-half yard square of brown linen or cotton cloth, and when\r\nyou reach camp, gather the best browse you can find for filling, but be\r\ncareful about having the pillow too full; keep it soft and comfortable.\r\nIf there is no browse, use clean underwear in its place. Fasten the open\r\nend of the bag together with large-sized patent dress snappers.\r\n\r\nOne of the pleasantest phases of a season\'s camping are the little side\r\ntrips for overnight. You hit the trail that leads to the chosen spot\r\nlocated some two or three, perhaps six or seven, miles distant; a place\r\nabsolutely dry, where you can enjoy the fun of sleeping on the ground\r\nwithout shelter, having merely the starry sky for a canopy. Each girl\r\ncan select the spot where she is to sleep and free it from all twigs,\r\nstones, etc., as the smallest and most insignificant of these will rob\r\nher of sleep and make the night most uncomfortable. When the space is\r\nsmooth mark the spot where the shoulders rest when lying down and\r\nanother spot immediately under the hips, then dig a hollow for each to\r\nfit in easily; cover the sleeping space with poncho, rubber side down,\r\nand over this lay a folded blanket for a mattress, using the second\r\nblanket as a cover. Your sleep will then probably be sound and\r\nrefreshing.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Guards=\r\n\r\nEstablish watchers, for this temporary camp, in relays to keep guard\r\nthrough the night and care for the fire, not allowing it to spread, grow\r\ntoo hot, or die down and go out.\r\n\r\nIf there are eight in the party, the first two, starting in at 10 P. M.,\r\nwill keep vigil until 12 midnight. These may chance to see a porcupine\r\nor other small wild animal, but the little creatures will not come too\r\nnear as long as your camp-fire is burning. The next two watchers will be\r\non duty until 2 A. M., and will doubtless hear, if not see, some of the\r\nwild life of the forest. The third couple\'s turn lasts until 4 A. M.;\r\nthen the last two will be awakened in time to see the sun rise, listen\r\nto the twittering and singing of the wild birds, and possibly catch a\r\nglimpse of wild deer. With 6 A. M. comes broad daylight, and the\r\never-to-be-remembered night in the open is past and gone.\r\n\r\nThese side trips bring you into closer touch with nature, quicken your\r\nlove for, and a desire to know more of, the wild; and, much to the\r\ndelight of the campers keeping guard through the hours of the night,\r\nthere comes a keen sense of the unusual, of novel experience, of\r\nstrangeness and adventure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Soft wood.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Exercise=\r\n\r\nWhile wholesome camping calls for sufficient physical exercise to cause\r\na girl to be blissfully tired at night, and yet awaken refreshed and\r\nfull of energy the next morning with a good appetite for breakfast,\r\nuntil you become accustomed to the outdoor life, it is best to curb your\r\nambition to outdo the other girls in strength and endurance. It is best\r\nnot to overtax yourself by travelling too far on a long trail at one\r\nstretch, or by lifting too heavy a log, stone, or other weight.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Camp-Fire=\r\n\r\nThe outdoor fire in camp bespeaks cheer, comfort, and possibilities for\r\na hot dinner, all of which the camper appreciates.\r\n\r\n\r\n=How to Build a Fire=\r\n\r\nChoose an open space, if possible, for your fire. Beware of having it\r\nunder tree branches, too near a tent, or in any other place that might\r\nprove dangerous. Start your fire with the tinder nearest at hand, dry\r\nleaves, ferns, twigs, cones, birch bark, or pine-knot slivers. As the\r\ntinder begins to burn, add kindling-wood of larger size, always\r\nremembering that the air must circulate under and upward through the\r\nkindling; no fire can live without air any more than you can live\r\nwithout breathing. Smother a person and he will die, smother a fire and\r\nit will die.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hard wood.]\r\n\r\nSoft woods are best to use after lighting the tinder; they ignite easily\r\nand burn quickly, such as pine, spruce, alder, birch, soft maple,\r\nbalsam-fir, and others. When the kindling is blazing put on still\r\nheavier wood, until you have a good, steady fire. Hard wood is better\r\nthan soft when the fire is well going; it burns longer and can usually\r\nbe depended upon for a reliable fire, not sending out sparks or\r\nsputtering, as do many of the soft woods, but burning well and giving a\r\nfine bed of hot coals. The tree belonging exclusively to America, and\r\nwhich is the best of the hardwoods, comes first on the hardwood list.\r\nThis is _hickory_. Pecan, chestnut-oak, black birch, basket-oaks, white\r\nbirch, maple, dogwood, beech, red and yellow birch, ash, and apple wood\r\nwhen obtainable are excellent.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cook-Fire=\r\n\r\nMake the cook-fire _small_ and _hot_; then you can work over it in\r\ncomfort and not scorch both hands and face when trying to get near\r\nenough to cook, as would be the case if the fire were large.\r\n\r\nWhen in a hurry use dry bark as wood for the cook-fire. Hemlock, pine,\r\nhickory, and other bark make a hot fire in a short time, and water will\r\nboil quickly over a bark fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Log-Cabin Fire=\r\n\r\nStart this fire with two good-sized short sticks or logs. Place them\r\nabout one foot apart parallel to each other. At each end across these\r\nlay two smaller sticks, and in the hollow square formed by the four\r\nsticks, put the tinder of cones, birch bark, or dry leaves.\r\n\r\nAcross the two upper sticks and over the tinder, make a grate by laying\r\nslender kindling sticks across from and resting on top of the two upper\r\nlarge sticks. Over the grate, at right angles to the sticks forming it,\r\nplace more sticks of larger size. Continue in this way, building the\r\nlog-cabin fire until the structure is one foot or so high, each layer\r\nbeing placed at right angles to the one beneath it. The fire must be\r\nlighted from beneath in the pile of tinder. I learned this method when\r\non the Pacific slope. The fire burns quickly, and the log-cabin plan is\r\na good one to follow when heating the bean hole, as the fire can be\r\nbuilt over the hole, and in burning the red-hot coals will fall down\r\ninto it, or the fire can be built directly in the hole; both ways are\r\nused by campers.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Fire in the Rain=\r\n\r\nTo build a fire in the rain with no dry wood in sight seems a difficult\r\nproblem, but keep cheerful, hum your favorite tune, and look for a\r\npine-knot or birch bark and an old dead stump or log. In the centre of\r\nthe dead wood you will find dry wood; dig it out and, after starting the\r\nfire with either birch bark or pine-knot, use the dry wood as kindling.\r\nWhen it begins to burn, add larger pieces of wood, and soon the fire\r\nwill grow strong enough to burn wet wood. If there happens to be a big\r\nrock in your camp, build your fire on the sheltered side and directly\r\nagainst the stone, which will act as a windbreak and keep the driving\r\nrain from extinguishing the fire. A slightly shelving bank would also\r\nform a shelter for it. A pine-knot is always a good friend to the girl\r\ncamper, both in dry and wet weather, but is especially friendly when it\r\nrains and everything is dripping wet.\r\n\r\nYou will find pine-knots in wooded sections where pine-trees grow; or,\r\nif you are located near water where there are no trees, look for\r\npine-knots in driftwood washed ashore. When secured cut thin slices down\r\npart way all around the elongated knot and circle it with many layers of\r\nshavings until the knot somewhat resembles a toy tree. The inside will\r\nbe absolutely dry, and this branching knot will prove reliable and start\r\nyour fire without fail. Birch bark will start a fire even when the bark\r\nis damp, and it is one of the best things you can have as a starter for\r\nan outdoor, rainy-day fire.\r\n\r\nTake your cue from the forest guides, and while in the woods always\r\ncarry some dry birch bark in your pocket for a fire in case of rain.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Camp Fireplace=\r\n\r\nOne way to make the outdoor fireplace is to lay two _green_ logs side by\r\nside on the ground in a narrow V shape, but open at both ends; only a\r\nfew inches at one end, a foot or more at the other. The fire is built\r\nbetween the logs, and the frying-pan and pail of water, resting on both\r\nlogs, bridge across the fire. Should the widest space between the logs\r\nbe needed, place two slender green logs at right angles across the V\r\nlogs, and have these short top cross logs near enough together to hold\r\nthe frying-pans set on them (Fig. 26).\r\n\r\nWhen there are no green logs, build the fireplace with three rectangular\r\nsides of stone, open front, and make the fire in the centre; the pots\r\nand pans rest across the fire on the stones.\r\n\r\nIf neither stones nor logs are available, dig a circle of fresh earth as\r\na safeguard and have the fire in its centre. Here you will need two\r\nstrong, forked-top stakes driven down into the ground directly opposite\r\neach other, one on each side of the circle. Rest the end of a stout\r\ngreen stick in the forked tops of the stakes, and use it to hang pots\r\nand pails from when cooking. A fire can also be safeguarded with a\r\ncircle of stones placed close together. Another method of outdoor\r\ncooking may be seen on page 81, where leaning stakes are used from which\r\nto hang cooking utensils over the fire.\r\n\r\nOne more caution about possibilities of causing forest fire. Terrible\r\nwide-spread fires have resulted from what was supposed to be an\r\nextinguished outdoor fire. Do not trust it, but when you are sure the\r\ncamp-fire is out, pour on more water over the fire and all around the\r\nunburned edge of surrounding ground; then throw on fresh earth until the\r\nfire space is covered. Be always on the safe side. Tack up on a tree\r\nin the camp, where all must see it, a copy of the state laws regarding\r\nforest fires, as shown in photograph frontispiece.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bringing wood for the fire.]\r\n\r\nOn forest lands much of the ground is deep with tangled rootlets and\r\nfibres mixed in with the mould, and a fire may be smouldering down\r\nunderneath, where you cannot see it. _Have a care._\r\n\r\nThe permanent-camp fireplace, built to do service for several seasons,\r\nis usually of big, heavy, _green_ logs, stones, and earth. The logs,\r\nabout three and one-half feet long, are built log-cabin fashion, some\r\ntwenty-eight inches high, with all crevices filled in and firmly padded\r\nwith earth and stones. Big stones are anchored securely along the top of\r\nthe earth-covered log sides and back of the fireplace, raising these\r\nhigher than the front. The space inside the walled fireplace is very\r\nnearly filled up with earth, and the fire is built on this earth.\r\nSurfaces of logs which may have been left exposed where the fire is to\r\nbe made are safeguarded with earth (Fig. 27).\r\n\r\nSuch a fireplace is big, substantial, firm, and lasting. Many of them\r\nmay be seen in the Adirondacks. They usually face the camp shelter, but\r\nare located at a safe distance, fully two yards, from it. Fires built in\r\nthese are generally used as social cheer-fires, but you can have the\r\ncheer-fire even though the substantial fireplace be _non est_, if in the\r\nevening you pile more wood on the cook-fire, making it large enough for\r\nall to gather around and have a good time, telling stories, laughing,\r\ntalking, and singing.\r\n\r\nAn excellent rule in camp is to have always on hand _plenty_ of\r\n_fire-wood_. Replenish the reserve stock every day as inroads are made\r\nupon it, and have some sort of shelter or covering where the wood will\r\nbe kept dry and ready for immediate use.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Camp Cooking. Provisions=\r\n\r\nIn the woods one is generally hungry except immediately after a good\r\nmeal, and provisions and cooking are of vital interest to the camper.\r\nThe list of essentials is not very long and, when the camp is a\r\npermanent one, non-essentials may be added to the larder with advantage.\r\n\r\nBread of some kind will form part of every meal, and a few loaves\r\nfreshly baked can be taken to camp to start with while you are getting\r\nsettled.\r\n\r\nThe quickest bread to cook is the delectable flapjack, and it is quite\r\nexciting to toss it in the air, see it turn over and catch it again--if\r\nyou can.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Flapjacks=\r\n\r\nMix dry flour, baking-powder, and salt together, 1 good teaspoonful of\r\nRoyal baking-powder to every 2 cups of flour, and 1 level teaspoonful of\r\nsalt to 1 quart (4 cups) of flour. To make the batter, beat 1 egg and\r\nadd 1-1/2 cups of milk, or 1 cup of milk and 1/2 cup of water;\r\nunsweetened condensed milk diluted according to directions on can may be\r\nused. Carefully and gradually stir in enough of the flour you have\r\nprepared to make a creamy batter, be sure it is smooth and without\r\nlumps; then stir in 1 heaping teaspoonful of sugar, better still\r\nmolasses, to make the cakes brown. Grease the frying-pan with a piece of\r\nfat pork or bacon, have the pan hot, and, with a large spoon or a cup,\r\nladle out the batter into the pan, forming three small cakes to be\r\nturned by a knife, or one large cake to be turned by tossing. Use the\r\nknife to lift the edges of the cakes as they cook, and when you see them\r\na golden brown, turn quickly. Or, if the cake is large, loosen it; then\r\nlift the pan and quickly toss the cake up into the air in such a way\r\nthat it will turn over and land safely, brown side up, on the pan.\r\nUnless you are skilled in tossing flapjacks, don\'t risk wasting the cake\r\nby having it fall on the ground or in the fire, but confine your efforts\r\nto the small, knife-turned cakes. Serve them "piping hot," and if there\r\nare no plates, each camper can deftly and quickly roll her flapjack into\r\ncylinder form of many layers and daintily and comfortably eat it while\r\nholding the roll between forefinger and thumb.\r\n\r\nKeep the frying-pan well greased while cooking the cakes, rubbing the\r\npan with grease each time before pouring in fresh batter.\r\n\r\nFlapjacks are good with butter, delicious with creamy maple-sugar soft\r\nenough to spread smoothly over the butter. The sugar comes in cans.\r\nOrdinary maple-syrup can be used, but is apt to drip over the edges if\r\nthe cake is held in the hand.\r\n\r\nWell-cooked cold rice mixed with the batter will give a delicate\r\ngriddle-cake and make a change from the regular flapjack.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Biscuits=\r\n\r\nBiscuits are more easily made than raised bread and so are used largely\r\nin its place while in camp. The proportions of flour and baking-powder\r\nare the same as for flapjacks. To 4 cups of flour mix 2 teaspoonfuls of\r\nRoyal baking-powder and 1 level teaspoonful of salt; add shortening\r\nabout the size of an egg, either lard or drippings. Divide the\r\nshortening into small bits and, using the tips of your fingers, rub it\r\nwell into the dry flour just prepared; then gradually stir in cold water\r\nto make a soft dough, barely stiff enough to be rolled out 3/4 inch\r\nthick on bread-board, clean flat stone, or large, smooth piece of\r\nflattened bark. Whichever is used must be well floured, as must also\r\nthe rolling-pin and biscuit cutter. A clean glass bottle or smooth round\r\nstick may be used as rolling-pin, and the cutter can be a baking-powder\r\ncan, or the biscuits may be cut square, or 4 inches long and 2 inches\r\nwide with a knife. The dough may also be shaped into a loaf 3/4 inch\r\nthick and baked in a pan by planting the pan in a bed of hot coals,\r\ncovering it with another pan or some substitute, and placing a deep\r\nlayer of hot coals all over the cover. The biscuits should bake in about\r\nfifteen minutes. For a hurry meal each camper can take a strip of dough,\r\nwind it spirally around a peeled thick stick, which has first been\r\nheated, and cook her own spiral biscuit by holding it over the fire and\r\nconstantly turning the stick. Biscuits, in common with everything cooked\r\nover a hot wood-fire, need constant watching that they may not burn.\r\nTest them with a clean splinter of wood; thrust it into the biscuit and\r\nif no dough clings to the wood the biscuits are done.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Johnny-Cake=\r\n\r\nServed hot, split open and buttered, these Kentucky johnny-cakes with a\r\ncup of good coffee make a fine, hearty breakfast, very satisfying and\r\ngood.\r\n\r\nAllow 1/2 cup of corn-meal for each person, and to every 4 cups of meal\r\nadd 1 teaspoonful of salt, mix well; then pour water, which is _boiling\r\nhard_, gradually into the meal, stirring constantly to avoid having any\r\nlumps. When the consistency is like soft mush, have ready a frying-pan\r\nalmost full of _hot_ drippings or lard, dip your hands into cold water\r\nto enable you to handle the hot dough, and, taking up enough corn-meal\r\ndough to make a _large_-sized biscuit, pat it in your hands into a\r\n3/4-inch-thick cake and gently drop it into the hot fat; immediately\r\nmake another cake, drop it into the fat, and continue until the\r\nfrying-pan is full. As soon as one johnny-cake browns on the lower side\r\nturn it over, remove each cake from the fat as soon as done, and serve\r\nas they cook.\r\n\r\nCorn-meal must be thoroughly scalded with boiling water when making any\r\nkind of corn bread in order to have the bread soft and not dry and\r\n"chaffy."\r\n\r\nFor baked corn bread add 2 full teaspoons of baking-powder and stir in 2\r\neggs, after 4 cups of meal and 1 teaspoonful of salt have been\r\nthoroughly scalded and allowed to cool a little. Pour this corn-meal\r\ndough into a pan which has been generously greased, and bake.\r\n\r\nCorn-meal needs a hot oven and takes longer to bake than wheat-flour\r\nbiscuits.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Corn-Meal Mush=\r\n\r\nCorn-meal mush does not absolutely require fresh cream or milk when\r\nserved. It is good eaten with butter and very nourishing. Many like it\r\nwith maple-syrup or common molasses.\r\n\r\nTime is required to make well-cooked mush; at least one hour will be\r\nnecessary. To 2 quarts of boiling, bubbling water add 1 teaspoonful of\r\nsalt, and very slowly, little by little, add 2 cups of corn-meal,\r\nstirring constantly and not allowing the water to cease boiling. Do not\r\nstop stirring until the mush has cooked about ten minutes. It may then\r\nbe placed higher up from the fire, where it will not scorch, and\r\n_boiling_ water added from time to time as needed to keep the mush of\r\nright consistency. The cold mush may be made into a tempting dish, if\r\nsliced 1/2-inch thick and fried brown in pork fat. Many cold cooked\r\ncereals can be treated in the same way; sprinkled with flour these will\r\nbrown better.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Kentucky Bread=\r\n\r\nKentucky bread is made of flour, salt, and water. It is generally known\r\nas beaten biscuit. Mix 2 scant teaspoonfuls of salt with 1 quart of\r\nflour, add enough cold water to make a _stiff_, smooth dough and knead,\r\npull, and pound the dough until it blisters; the longer it is worked and\r\nbeaten the better. Roll out very thin, cut round or into squares and\r\nbake. These biscuits may be quickly made, are simple and wholesome.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cocoa=\r\n\r\nGood cocoa may be made by substituting cold milk and cold water for hot.\r\nFollow directions on the can as to proportion, and add the cold liquids\r\nafter the cocoa is mixed to a smooth paste; then boil. Either\r\nunsweetened condensed milk or milk powder can take the place of fresh\r\nmilk.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Coffee=\r\n\r\nFor every camper allow 1 tablespoonful of ground coffee, then 1 extra\r\nspoonful for the pot. Put the dry coffee into the coffee-pot, and to\r\nsettle it add a crumbled egg-shell; then pour in a little cold water and\r\nstir all together; when there are no egg-shells use merely cold water.\r\nAdd 1 cupful of cold water for each camper, and 2 for the pot, set the\r\ncoffee-pot over the fire and let it boil for a few moments, take it from\r\nthe fire and pour into the spout a little cold water, then place the\r\ncoffee where it will keep hot--not cook, but settle.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Tea=\r\n\r\nAllow 1 scant teaspoonful of tea for each person, scald the teapot,\r\nmeasure the tea into the pot, and pour in as many cups of _boiling_\r\nwater as there are spoonfuls of tea, adding an extra cupful for the pot.\r\n_Never_ let _tea boil_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Boiled Potatoes=\r\n\r\nWash potatoes, cut out any blemish, and put them on to cook in cold\r\nwater over the fire. They are much better boiled while wearing their\r\njackets. Allow from one-half to three-quarters of an hour for boiling,\r\ntest them with a sliver of wood that will pierce through the centre when\r\nthe potato is done. When cooked pour off the boiling water, set off the\r\nfire to one side where they will keep hot, and raise one edge of the lid\r\nto allow the steam to escape. Serve while _very_ hot.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Baked Potatoes=\r\n\r\nWrap each potato in wet leaves and place them all on hot ashes that lie\r\nover hot coals, put more hot ashes on top of the potatoes, and over the\r\nashes place a deep bed of red-hot coals. It will require about forty\r\nminutes or more for potatoes to bake. Take one out when you think they\r\nshould be done; if soft enough to yield to the pressure when squeezed\r\nbetween thumb and finger, the potato is cooked. Choose potatoes as near\r\nof a size as possible; then all will be baked to a turn at the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Bean Soup and Baked Beans=\r\n\r\nLook over one quart of dried beans, take out all bits of foreign matter\r\nand injured beans; then wash the beans in several waters and put them to\r\nsoak overnight in fresh water. Next morning scald 1-1/2 pounds salt\r\npork, scrape it well, rinse, and with 1 teaspoonful of dried onion or\r\nhalf of a fresh one, put on to boil with the beans in cold water. Cook\r\nslowly for several hours. When the water boils low, add more boiling\r\nwater and boil until the beans are soft.\r\n\r\nTo make soup, dip out a heaping cupful of the boiled beans, mash them to\r\na paste, then pour the liquid from the boiled beans over the paste and\r\nstir until well mixed; if too thin add more beans; if too thick add hot\r\nwater until of the right consistency, place the soup over the fire to\r\nreheat, and serve very hot. To bake beans, remove the pork from the\r\ndrained, partially cooked beans, score it across the top and replace it\r\nin the pot in midst of and extending a trifle above the surface of the\r\nbeans, add 1 cup of hot water and securely cover the top of the pot with\r\na lid or some substitute. Sink the pot well into the glowing coals and\r\nshovel hot coals over all. Add more hot water from time to time if\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nBeans cooked in a bean hole rival those baked in other ways. Dig the\r\nhole about 1-1/2 feet deep and wide, build a fire in it, and keep it\r\nburning briskly for hours; the oven hole must be _hot_. When the beans\r\nare ready, rake the fire out of the hole; then sink the pot down into\r\nthe hole and cover well with hot coals and ashes, placing them all over\r\nthe sides and top of the pot. Over these shovel a thick layer of earth,\r\nprotecting the top with grass sod or thick blanket of leaves and bark,\r\nthat rain may not penetrate to the oven. Let the beans bake all night.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Bacon=\r\n\r\nSliced bacon freshly cut is best; do not bring it to camp in jars or\r\ncans, but cut it as needed. Each girl may have the fun of cooking her\r\nown bacon.\r\n\r\nCut long, slender sticks with pronged ends, sharpen the prongs and they\r\nwill hold the bacon; or use sticks with split ends and wedge in the\r\nbacon between the two sides of the split, then toast it over the fire.\r\nOther small pieces of meat can be cooked in the same way. Bacon boiled\r\nwith greens gives the vegetable a fine flavor, as it also does\r\nstring-beans when cooked with them. It may, however, be boiled alone for\r\ndinner, and is good fried for breakfast.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Game Birds=\r\n\r\nGame birds can be baked in the embers. Have ready a bed of red-hot coals\r\ncovered with a thin layer of ashes, and after drawing the bird, dip it\r\nin water to wet the feathers; then place it on the ash-covered red\r\ncoals, cover the bird with more ashes, and heap on quantities of red\r\ncoals. If the bird is small it should be baked in about one-half hour.\r\nWhen done strip off the skin, carrying feathers with it, and the bird\r\nwill be clean and appetizing. Birds can also be roasted in the bean-pot\r\nhole, but in this way, they must first be picked, drawn, and rinsed\r\nclean; then cut into good-sized pieces and placed in the pot with fat\r\npork, size of an egg, for seasoning; after pouring in enough water to\r\ncover the meat, fasten the pot lid on securely and bury the pot in the\r\nglowing hot hole under a heap of red-hot coals. Cover with earth, the\r\nsame as when baking beans.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Fish=\r\n\r\nFish cooked in the embers is very good, and you need not first remove\r\nscales or fins, but clean the fish, season it with salt and pepper, wrap\r\nit in fresh, wet, green leaves or wet blank paper, not printed paper,\r\nand bury in the coals the same as a bird. When done the skin, scales,\r\nand fins can all be pulled off together, leaving the delicious hot fish\r\nready to serve.\r\n\r\nTo boil a fish: First scale and clean it; then cut off head and tail.\r\nIf you have a piece of new cheesecloth to wrap the fish in, it can be\r\nstuffed with dressing made of dry crumbs of bread or biscuits well\r\nseasoned with butter, or bits of pork, pepper, and a very small piece of\r\nonion. The cloth covering must be wrapped around and tied with white\r\nstring. When the fish is ready, put it into boiling water to which has\r\nbeen added 1 tablespoonful of vinegar and a little salt. The vinegar\r\ntends to keep the meat firm, and the dressing makes the fish more of a\r\ndinner dish; both, however, can be omitted. Allow about twenty minutes\r\nfor boiling a three-pound fish.\r\n\r\nThe sooner a fish is cooked after being caught the better. To scale a\r\nfish, lay it on a flat stone or log, hold it by the head and with a\r\nknife scrape off the scales. Scale each side and, with a quick stroke,\r\ncut off the head and lower fins. The back fin must have incisions on\r\neach side in order to remove it. Trout are merely scraped and cleaned by\r\ndrawing out the inside with head and gills. Do this by forcing your hand\r\nin and grasping tight hold of the gullet.\r\n\r\nTo clean most fish it is necessary to slit open the under side, take out\r\nthe inside, wash the fish, and wipe it dry with a clean cloth.\r\n\r\nIf the camping party is fond of fish, and fish frequently forms part of\r\na meal, have a special clean cloth to use exclusively for drying the\r\nfish.\r\n\r\n\r\n          _Provisions for One Person for Two Weeks.

Half-way down from\r\nthe top, place more cross poles, resting them on the crotches left on\r\nthe uprights. Have these last cross poles as nearly the same distance\r\nfrom the ground as possible and over them hang thick branches, hooking\r\nthe branches on by the stubs on their heavy ends. Also hang thickly\r\nfoliaged branches on the top cross poles, using the stubs where smaller\r\nbranches have been lopped off as hooks, as on the lower row (Fig. 29);\r\nthen peg down the bottom ends of the hanging branches to the ground with\r\nsharpened two-pronged crotches cut from branches. The upper row of\r\nbranches should overlap the under row one foot or more. Make the seat by\r\ndriving three stout stakes firmly into the ground; two at the back, one\r\nin front, and on these nail three crosspieces.\r\n\r\nNever throw dish water or any refuse near your tent or on the camp\r\ngrounds.\r\n\r\n_Burn_ or _bury_ all trash, remembering that earth and fire are your\r\ngood servants, and with their assistance you can have perfect camp\r\ncleanliness, which will go a long way toward keeping away a variety of\r\ntroublesome flies and make camp attractive and wholesome.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Camp Spirit=\r\n\r\nThoughtfulness for others; kindliness; the willingness to do your share\r\nof the work, and more, too; the habit of making light of all\r\ndiscomforts; cheerfulness under all circumstances; and the determination\r\nnever to sulk, imagine you are slighted, or find fault with people,\r\nconditions, or things. To radiate good-will, take things as they come\r\nand _enjoy them_, and to do your full share of entertainment and\r\nfun-making--this is the true camp spirit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nWHAT TO WEAR ON THE TRAIL\r\n\r\n=Camp Outfits. Clothing. Personal Outfits. Camp Packs. Duffel-Bags and\r\nWhat to Put in Them=\r\n\r\n\r\nTo prepare your own camping outfit for the coming summer, to plan, to\r\nwork out your lists, to select materials, and make many of the things\r\njust as you want them or even to hunt up the articles and purchase them,\r\nwhile all the time delightful visions of trailing and camp life dance\r\nbefore you, is to know the true joy of anticipation, and is great fun.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Clothing=\r\n\r\nMake your dress for the trail absolutely comfortable, not too heavy, too\r\ntight, too hot, or too cool. No part of the clothing should bind or\r\ndraw.\r\n\r\nBrown or dark gray are the best colors for the forest; avoid wearing\r\nthose which frighten the timid wild life, for you want to make friends\r\nwith the birds and animals, so do not wear metal buttons, buckles, or\r\nanything that shines or sparkles.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Underwear=\r\n\r\nFor girl campers the light-weight, pure-woollen underwear is best,\r\nespecially if you locate in the mountains, or the Canadian or Maine\r\nforests. On cold days two light-weight union garments are warmer than\r\none of heavy weight. Wool is never clammy and cold, it absorbs\r\nperspiration and when on the trail prevents the chilly feeling often\r\nexperienced when halting for a rest in the forest.\r\n\r\nUnion garments may be obtained in a variety of weights, and a one-piece\r\nsuit is the only garment necessary to wear under bloomers and middy when\r\nat camp.\r\n\r\nLeave corsets at home, they have no place in the outdoor life, and you\r\nwill be freer if you discard the dress skirt when at camp and on the\r\ntrail. Have your muscles free, be able to take in long, deep breaths, to\r\nmove readily all portions of your body, and not be hampered in any way\r\nby ill-fitting, uncomfortable clothing. There must be unrestricted\r\nfreedom of arms and limbs for a girl to be able to use them easily in\r\nclimbing mountains or hills, scrambling over fallen trees, sliding over\r\nrocks, jumping from stone to stone, or from root to half-sunken log on\r\nwet trails of the forest.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Stockings=\r\n\r\nSelect your stockings with care. Let them be of wool, strong, soft, and\r\nabsolutely satisfactory when the shoe is on. The aim of the entire camp\r\ndress is to have it so comfortable and well adapted to outdoor life that\r\nyou will forget it; think no more of it than a bird does of its\r\nfeathers. When woollen stockings are worn, wet feet are not apt to give\r\none cold, for the feet do not become chilled even when it is necessary\r\nto stand in the reedy edge of a mountain lake or stream. If, however,\r\nyou cannot wear wool, use cotton stockings. Remember that wool often\r\nshrinks in the wash. Allow for this when purchasing goods, though it is\r\nsaid, on reliable authority, that if laundered with care the garments\r\nwill not shrink.\r\n\r\nWhen washing woollen underwear use very soapy, cool water (not icy) with\r\naddition of a little borax, or ammonia, if you have either, and do not\r\nrub soap directly on wool; it mats the little fibres and this causes\r\nthe wool to shrink. For the same reason avoid rubbing the garments if\r\npossible during the cleansing process. All that is usually necessary is\r\nto squeeze and souse them well, then rinse in water of the same\r\ntemperature; do not wring the things; squeeze them and hang them up to\r\ndry. Changes of temperature in the water when washing wool will cause\r\nthe wool to shrink. To alternate between cold and warm, hot and lukewarm\r\nwater will surely cause the clothing to grow much smaller and stiffer;\r\nkeep both wash and rinse water either cold or lukewarm; cold is safer.\r\n\r\nAllow no one to persuade you to take old clothes to camp; they will soon\r\nneed mending and prove a torment.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Shoes=\r\n\r\nWear low-heeled, high-laced shoes of stout leather and easy fit. Make\r\nthem water-proof by giving the leather a good coat of hot, melted mutton\r\ntallow, completely covering the shoes and working the tallow into all\r\ncrevices. Be sure to do this, as it is worse than useless to depend upon\r\nrubber overshoes when trailing; sharp stones cut, and roots, twigs, and\r\nunderbrush tear the rubber, with the result that the overshoes soon fill\r\nwith water and your feet swim in little lakes. Test your shoes well\r\nbefore taking them to camp, be perfectly satisfied that they are\r\ncomfortable and well-fitting, wear them steadily for one week or more.\r\nIt is very unwise to risk new shoes on the trail, and it is of the\r\nutmost importance that the feet be kept in good condition. Be kind to\r\nyour feet.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Camping Dress=\r\n\r\nThe most serviceable and practical dress for camping is a three-piece\r\nsuit, made of a fadeless, soft quality of gray or brown material.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DUFFEL-BAGS\r\n\r\nLEGGIN\r\n\r\nPONCHO\r\n\r\nTRAILER\'S BOOT\r\n\r\nTrailers\' outfits.]\r\n\r\nThe middy-blouse while loose can be well-fitting, with long sleeves\r\nroomy enough to allow of pushing up above the elbow when desired. Sew\r\ntwo small patch pockets high on the left breast--one for your watch, the\r\nother for your compass; protect the pockets with flaps which fasten down\r\nover the open top with dress snaps. On the right breast sew one\r\ngood-sized pocket.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these you will need one large pocket on both right and\r\nleft side of middy, below belt line, making in all three large and two\r\nsmall pockets. The belt is held in place by sliding it through loops\r\nsewed on the middy, one at the back and one on each side.\r\n\r\nMake the skirt of this suit short enough for ease and of generous width,\r\nnot to draw at front, but give perfect freedom of the limbs. Have a seam\r\npocket in each side of the front breadth, and fasten the skirt down one\r\nside from belt to hem. It can then be quickly removed and used as a cape\r\nor a wind break when occasion requires. The bloomers, well-fitting and\r\ncomfortable, gathered below the knee with best quality of elastic, that\r\nit may last, can have a deep pocket sewed across the front of each leg,\r\nseveral inches conveniently below waist-line.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Hat=\r\n\r\nA soft, light-weight felt hat with brim sufficiently wide to shade the\r\neyes will prove the best head covering for the trail. Don\'t use hatpins;\r\nyour hat will cling to the head if you substitute a strip of woollen\r\ncloth in place of the inside leather band. The clinging wool prevents\r\nthe hat from being readily knocked off by overhanging branches or blown\r\noff on windy days.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Check List of Apparel=\r\n\r\nGo light when off for the woods, take with you only those things which\r\nseem to be absolutely necessary; remember that you will carry your own\r\npack and be your own laundress, so hesitate about including too many\r\nwashable garments. Make out your list, then consider the matter\r\ncarefully and realize that every one of the articles, even the very\r\nsmallest, has a way of growing heavier and heavier and adding to the\r\never-increasing weight of your pack the longer you walk, so be wise,\r\nread over your list and cut it down, decide that you _can_ do without a\r\nnumber of things thought at first to be indispensable.\r\n\r\nIn addition to your camp dress described, the following list forms a\r\nbasis to work upon, to be added to, taken from, or substitution made\r\naccording to location, climate, and nature of the country where you will\r\npitch camp:\r\n\r\n          One extra suit of wool underwear. Wash suit as\r\n          soon as changed.\r\n\r\n          One extra pair of stockings. Every morning put on\r\n          a fresh pair, washing the discarded ones the same\r\n          day.\r\n\r\n          One high-necked, long-sleeved, soft, woven\r\n          undershirt for cold days.\r\n\r\n          One extra thin middy-blouse for hot days.\r\n\r\n          Three pocket handkerchiefs, each laundered as soon\r\n          as discarded.\r\n\r\n          One kimono, soft, warm wool, buttoned down front,\r\n          not eider-down (it is too bulky), color brown or\r\n          dark gray.\r\n\r\n          One bathing-suit without skirt, made in one-piece,\r\n          loose, belted waist with bloomers; suit opened on\r\n          shoulders with strong button and buttonhole\r\n          fastenings.\r\n\r\n          One warm sweater with high turned-over collar and\r\n          sleeves good and long. On the trail carry your\r\n          sweater by tying the sleeves around your waist,\r\n          allowing the sweater to hang down at the back.\r\n\r\n          One pair of gloves, strong, pliable, easy-fitting\r\n          chamois, if you feel that you need them. The bare,\r\n          free hands are better.\r\n\r\n          One pair of strong, snug, well-fitting leggins\r\n          matching camp dress in color, with no buttons or\r\n          buckles to tangle on underbrush. The fastening can\r\n          be covered by smooth outer flap.\r\n\r\n          One pair of felt slippers or thick-soled moccasins\r\n          for tent.\r\n\r\n          Four extra strips of elastic for renewing those in\r\n          knees of bloomers.\r\n\r\n          One large, strong, soft silk or cotton\r\n          neckerchief, for protecting neck from sun, rain,\r\n          and cold, also good to fold diagonally and use for\r\n          arm sling or tie over hat in a hard wind; silk is\r\n          best.\r\n\r\n          Two head-nets if your stay is long, one if short,\r\n          to be worn in case of swarms of pestiferous flies\r\n          and mosquitoes. Especially needed for protection\r\n          from the midge, black-fly, etc., found in northern\r\n          forests and elsewhere during the spring and\r\n          through to the middle or last of July. Your net\r\n          can be of fine mesh bobbinet; if you have only\r\n          white, dye it black; all other colors are apt to\r\n          dazzle the eyes. The best material to use is black\r\n          Brussels net. Cut a strip of net long enough to\r\n          fit easily around your shoulders and allow of some\r\n          fulness. Take the measurement smoothly around the\r\n          shoulders with a piece of tape and add to this\r\n          about three-eighths of the entire length you have\r\n          just measured, which will give you the length\r\n          required. The width should be sufficient to allow\r\n          of the net reaching from base of hat crown across\r\n          over brim and down over top of shoulders, about\r\n          twenty-two inches or more in all. Cut the net\r\n          according to size needed; then fold the strip at\r\n          centre across the width, fold again, making four\r\n          even folds. Once more fold and you will have\r\n          divided the net into eight equal parts. Mark the\r\n          net at each fold and open it out (Fig. 30). Cut\r\n          armholes in the divisions marked 2 (Fig. 30) to\r\n          fit over the shoulders, sew together the two ends,\r\n          bind the shoulder armholes holding the net loosely\r\n          that it may not pull and strain. Sew an elastic to\r\n          back corner of each armhole, hem the top of net\r\n          strip and run an elastic through hem to fit snugly\r\n          on base of hat crown. Gather lower edges of net;\r\n          then try the net on, adjusting lower and upper\r\n          gathers so that the veil will blouse a little,\r\n          remembering not to let the net touch your face; if\r\n          it should, the little tormentors will bite through\r\n          and torture you. Sew a piece of black tape across\r\n          lower edge of the front and another across lower\r\n          edge of the back, fitting the tape to lie smoothly\r\n          over chest and back; then bring forward the\r\n          hanging pieces of elastic, adjust them comfortably\r\n          under the arms, and mark length of elastic to\r\n          reach around under arm and fasten with dress snaps\r\n          at front corner of armhole. Cut elastic and finish\r\n          net (Fig. 31).\r\n\r\n          _Ornaments_--Never take rings, bracelets,\r\n          necklaces, or jewelry of any kind to camp; leave\r\n          all such things at home, and with them ribbons,\r\n          beads, and ornaments of all descriptions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 30\r\n\r\n31\r\n\r\nThe head-net and blanket-roll.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Check List of Toilet Articles=\r\n\r\n          One comb, not silver-backed.\r\n\r\n          One hand-mirror to hang or stand up.\r\n\r\n          One tooth-brush in case.\r\n\r\n          One tube of tooth-paste, or its equivalent.\r\n\r\n          One nail-brush.\r\n\r\n          One cake of unscented toilet-soap.\r\n\r\n          Two cakes of laundry-soap.\r\n\r\n          One package of borax or securely corked bottle of\r\n          ammonia.\r\n\r\n          One tube of cold-cream.\r\n\r\n          One baking-powder can of pure, freshly "tried out"\r\n          mutton tallow, made so by boiling in pure water\r\n          until melted, then allowed to cool and harden.\r\n          When taken from the water, again melted and, while\r\n          hot, strained through a clean cloth into the can.\r\n          Good to remove pitch and balsam-gum from the\r\n          hands, to use as cold-cream to soften the hands,\r\n          and excellent to water-proof the shoes.\r\n\r\n          One wash-cloth, washed, aired, and sunned every\r\n          day. In rainy weather, washed and dried.\r\n\r\n          Two hand towels, each washed as soon as soiled.\r\n\r\n          One bath towel, washed as soon as used.\r\n\r\n          One manicure-scissors.\r\n\r\n          One package sandpaper nail-files.\r\n\r\n          Two papers of hair-pins.\r\n\r\n          One paper of common pins, also little flat pocket\r\n          pincushion well filled around edge with pins.\r\n\r\n          Two papers of large-sized safety-pins.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Check List of Personal Camp Property=\r\n\r\n          One note-book and pencil for taking notes on wild\r\n          birds, animals, trees, etc.\r\n\r\n          One needle-case, compact with needles and strong\r\n          white and black thread, wound on cardboard reels\r\n          (spools are too bulky). Scissors, thimble, and\r\n          large-eyed tape-needle for running elastic through\r\n          hem in bloomers and head-net, when needed.\r\n\r\n          Two papers of very large sized safety-pins of\r\n          horse-blanket kind.\r\n\r\n          One roll of tape, most useful in many ways.\r\n\r\n          One whistle, the loudest and shrillest to be\r\n          found, worn on cord around the neck, for calling\r\n          help when lost or in case of need. A short, simple\r\n          system of signalling calls should be adopted.\r\n\r\n          One compass, durable and absolutely true.\r\n\r\n          One watch, inexpensive but trustworthy. Do not\r\n          take your gold watch.\r\n\r\n          One package of common post-cards, with lead pencil\r\n          attached. The postals to take the place of\r\n          letters.\r\n\r\n          One package writing-paper and stamped envelopes,\r\n          if post-cards do not meet the needs.\r\n\r\n          One pocket-knife, a big, strong one, with\r\n          substantial, sharp, strong blades, for outdoor\r\n          work and to use at meals.\r\n\r\n          One loaded camera, in case which has secure\r\n          leather loops through which your belt can be\r\n          slipped to carry camera and hold it steady,\r\n          leaving the hands free and precluding danger of\r\n          smashing the instrument should a misstep on mossy\r\n          stone or a trip over unseen vine or root suddenly\r\n          throw you down and send the camera sailing on a\r\n          distance ahead. Such an accident befell a girl\r\n          camper who was too sure that her precious camera\r\n          would be safest if carried in her hand. Wear the\r\n          camera well back that you may not fall on it\r\n          should you stumble, or the camera can be carried\r\n          on strap slung from the right shoulder.\r\n\r\n          Three or more rolls of extra films, the quantity\r\n          depending upon your length of stay at camp and the\r\n          possibilities for interesting subjects.\r\n\r\n          One fishing-rod and fishing-tackle outfit. Choose\r\n          the simple and useful rather than the fancy and\r\n          expensive. Select your outfit according to the\r\n          particular kind of fishing you will find near\r\n          camp. There is a certain different style of rod\r\n          and tackle for almost every variety of fish. If\r\n          fishing is not to be a prominent feature of the\r\n          camp, you might take line and hooks, and wait\r\n          until you reach camp to cut your fishing-pole.\r\n\r\n          One tin cup, with open handle to slide over belt.\r\n          The cup will serve you with cool sparkling water,\r\n          with cocoa, coffee, or tea as the case may be, and\r\n          it will also be your soup bowl. Keep the inside of\r\n          the cup bright and shiny. While aluminum is much\r\n          lighter than other metal, it is not advisable to\r\n          take to camp either cup, teaspoon, or fork of\r\n          aluminum because it is such a good conductor of\r\n          heat that those articles would be very apt to burn\r\n          your lips if used with hot foods.\r\n\r\n          One dinner knife, if you object to using your\r\n          pocket-knife.\r\n\r\n          One dinner fork, not silver.\r\n\r\n          One teaspoon, not silver.\r\n\r\n          One plate, may be of aluminum or tin, can be kept\r\n          bright by scouring with soap and earth.\r\n\r\n          Two warm wool double blankets, closely woven and\r\n          of good size. The U.S. Army blankets are of the\r\n          best. With safety-pins blankets can be turned into\r\n          sleeping-bags and hammocks.\r\n\r\n          One poncho, light in weight to wear over\r\n          shoulders, spread on ground rubber side down to\r\n          protect from dampness, can be used in various\r\n          ways.\r\n\r\n          One pillow-bag.\r\n\r\n          One mattress-bag.\r\n\r\n          One water-proof match-safe.\r\n\r\n          One belt hatchet in case, or belt sheath small\r\n          axe, for chopping wood and felling small trees,\r\n          but, be very careful when using either of these\r\n          tools. Before going to camp find some one who can\r\n          give you proper instructions in handling one or\r\n          both, and practise carefully following directions.\r\n          Be very _cautious_ and go slow until you become an\r\n          expert. Outdoor books and magazines should be\r\n          consulted for information, and if you do not feel\r\n          absolutely confident of your ability to use the\r\n          hatchet or axe after practising, _do not take them\r\n          with you_. For the sake of others as well as\r\n          yourself, you have not the right to take chances\r\n          of injuring either others or yourself through\r\n          inability to use safely any tool. Do not attempt\r\n          to use a regular-sized axe, it is very dangerous.\r\n          One guide told me that after a tenderfoot chopped\r\n          a cruel gash nearly through his foot when using\r\n          the guide\'s axe, that axe was never again loaned,\r\n          but kept in a safe place and not allowed to be\r\n          touched by any one except the owner.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Check List for First Aid=\r\n\r\n          One hot-water bag, good for all pains and aches,\r\n          and a comfort when one is chilly.\r\n\r\n          One package pure ginger pulverized or ground, to\r\n          make hot ginger tea in case of chill, pains in the\r\n          bowels, or when you have met with an accidental\r\n          ducking or are wet through to the skin by rain.\r\n          Never mind if the tea does burn, ginger always\r\n          stings when helping one. Be a good sport, take\r\n          your medicine.\r\n\r\n          One box of charcoal tablets for dyspepsia or\r\n          indigestion.\r\n\r\n          One package bicarbonate of soda (baking-soda);\r\n          good for burns, sprinkle well with soda, see that\r\n          the burn is completely covered, then cover lightly\r\n          with cloth, and do not disturb it for a long time.\r\n\r\n          One bottle of ammonia well corked. Tie the cork\r\n          down firmly in the bottle (Fig. 32); a flannel\r\n          case or raffia covering will protect the glass\r\n          from breakage. Good to smell in case of faintness,\r\n          but care must be taken _not_ to hold it _too near_\r\n          the _nose_, as the ammonia might injure the\r\n          delicate membranes, as would also smelling-salts.\r\n          Safer to move the bottle or cloth wet with ammonia\r\n          slowly back and forth near the nose. Good also for\r\n          insect bites.\r\n\r\n          One roll of adhesive plaster. Cut into lengths for\r\n          holding covered ointment or poultice in place, the\r\n          strips criss-cross over the poultice, but are not\r\n          attached, the ends only are pressed on the bare\r\n          skin to which they firmly adhere.\r\n\r\n          Two rolls of 2-1/2 or 3 inch wide surgeon bandages\r\n          (not gauze) for general use where bandages are\r\n          needed.\r\n\r\n          One small package of absorbent cotton.\r\n\r\n          Two mustard plasters, purchased at drug store;\r\n          good for stomachache.\r\n\r\n          One package of powdered licorice to use as a\r\n          laxative. Dissolve a little licorice in water and\r\n          drink it. To keep the bowels open means to ward\r\n          off a host of evils. It is even more essential\r\n          that the inside of the body be kept clean than it\r\n          is to have the outside clean. To this end make a\r\n          practise of drinking a great deal of pure water;\r\n          drink it before breakfast, between meals (not at\r\n          meals), and before retiring. If you do this, you\r\n          will probably not need other laxative, especially\r\n          if you eat fruit either fresh or stewed. Fruit\r\n          should form part of every day\'s fare. _Keep your\r\n          bowels open._\r\n\r\n          One tube of Carron oil, to use for burns or\r\n          scalds.\r\n\r\n          One small bottle of camphor, for headaches.\r\n\r\n          One small bag of salt--good dissolved in water, 1\r\n          teaspoonful to 1 pint of water, for bathing tired\r\n          or inflamed eyes, often effects a cure. Good for\r\n          bathing affected spots of ivy poison, good for\r\n          sore-throat gargle, also for nosebleed; snuff,\r\n          then plug nose. Good for brushing teeth. For all\r\n          these dissolve salt in water in proportion as\r\n          given above.\r\n\r\n          One white muslin 24-inch triangular bandage, for\r\n          arm sling or chest, jaw, and head bandage. A man\'s\r\n          large-sized white handkerchief can be used; never\r\n          bind broken skin with colored cloth.\r\n\r\n          One bottle of fly dope, warranted to keep off\r\n          pestiferous flies and mosquitoes. All these may be\r\n          kept in one-half of a linen case of pockets, your\r\n          toilet articles in the other half, and the case\r\n          can be opened out and hung to the side of your\r\n          tent or shelter.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Check List for General Camp=\r\n\r\n          Two basins, of light metal, paper or collapsible\r\n          rubber. The last is easy to pack and light to\r\n          carry. One basin will serve for several girls. If\r\n          you camp near a body of fresh water let that be\r\n          your basin; it will always be ready filled. No\r\n          need then to bring water to your shelter, for a\r\n          delightful dip in the river or lake every morning\r\n          before breakfast will obviate all necessity, and\r\n          do away with the otherwise needful hand-basin.\r\n\r\n          One reliable map of location and surrounding\r\n          country for constant reference.\r\n\r\n          One water-pail, light weight, for every two or\r\n          three girls. Can be canvas, aluminum, paper,\r\n          rubber, or your own selection in other materials.\r\n\r\n          Six toilet-paper packages or more.\r\n\r\n          One or more tents of water-proof material.\r\n\r\n          One or more sod cloths for tent flooring.\r\n\r\n          One or more inner tents of cheesecloth for\r\n          protection from mosquitoes, etc. These can be made\r\n          at home or purchased with the tents at the regular\r\n          camp-outfitters\'. There is on the market a spray,\r\n          claimed to be absolutely effective against\r\n          mosquitoes, etc., and to keep both tent and camp\r\n          free from pests. One quart is said to last two\r\n          weeks with daily use. Cost, fifty cents per quart.\r\n\r\n          One carborundum stone for sharpening all cutting\r\n          tools.\r\n\r\n          One or more lanterns. Folding candle lanterns may\r\n          be purchased, but the simple ten-cent kind with\r\n          lamp-chimney for protection of candle are good.\r\n          They can be had at country stores in Cresco, Pa.\r\n          May possibly be found at camp-outfitters\'. If a\r\n          glass chimney is to be used, pack most carefully.\r\n          Fill the inside of the chimney with stockings,\r\n          handkerchiefs, etc.; then wrap the chimney all\r\n          over with other soft clothing and tie securely.\r\n          Have this outside wrap very thick.\r\n\r\n          One package of one-half length candles to use in\r\n          lantern.\r\n\r\n          One _tin_ box of one or two dozen safety-matches.\r\n          _Tin_ will not catch fire from the matches.\r\n\r\n          One strong tool-bag with separate labelled pockets\r\n          for different tools; each pocket with flap to\r\n          fasten securely with dress snaps. In this tool-bag\r\n          put assorted nails, mostly big, strong ones,\r\n          screws, awl, well-sealed bottle of strong glue,\r\n          ball of stout twine, a few rawhide thongs, three\r\n          or four yards of soft strong rope, a pair of\r\n          scissors, two spools of wire, and several yards of\r\n          cheesecloth.\r\n\r\n          One rope--long for mountain-climbing.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Check List of Kitchen Utensils=\r\n\r\n          Two dish-pans, one for piping-hot sudsy water for\r\n          washing dishes, the other for scalding-hot rinsing\r\n          water. The last pan can also be used for mixing\r\n          and bread-making. Select pans strong and of light\r\n          weight--canvas, aluminum, or tin--and be sure they\r\n          nest or fold.\r\n\r\n          Two water-pails, fitted one within the other, both\r\n          light weight.\r\n\r\n          One coffee-pot, size to fit in pails, must not be\r\n          too high. Cocoa can be made in the coffee-pot.\r\n\r\n          One frying-pan, for corn-dodgers, flapjacks, fried\r\n          mush, eggs, etc.\r\n\r\n          One folding camp-oven, for hot biscuits, bread\r\n          puddings, and many other good things relished by\r\n          hungry campers.\r\n\r\n          One wash-basin, to be kept strictly for washing\r\n          hands, when cooking.\r\n\r\n          One large spoon, for stirring and general use.\r\n\r\n          One kitchen-knife, suitable for cutting bread,\r\n          carving meat, turning pancakes, etc.\r\n\r\n          One kitchen-fork, strong and big, but not a\r\n          toasting-fork.\r\n\r\n          One Dutch oven pot, a strong seamless pot with\r\n          cover, to use for baking, boiling, and stewing.\r\n\r\n          Three dish-towels, washed after every meal.\r\n\r\n          One dish mop or cloth, washed and dried after each\r\n          meal; dry in sun when possible.\r\n\r\n          Four large cakes of soap.\r\n\r\n          One thick holder, for lifting pots. Hang this up\r\n          in a certain place where it may always be found\r\n          when needed.\r\n\r\n          One pepper and one salt shaker, small and light in\r\n          weight.\r\n\r\n          One net air-bag, for meat, fish, and anything that\r\n          must be kept fresh (Fig. 33) and protected from\r\n          the flies. Use strong net and two or more hoops\r\n          for the air-bag. With pincers you can twist the\r\n          two ends of strong wire together and make the\r\n          hoops of size large enough to hold the net out\r\n          away from a large piece of meat. Cut the net long\r\n          enough to stand above and hang below the meat.\r\n          Gather the top edge tightly together and sew it\r\n          fast; then sew the hoop near the top of the bag.\r\n          Other hoops on either side of centre of bag and a\r\n          hoop near bottom of bag, or sew only one hoop at\r\n          the top and one at the bottom. Have strong\r\n          draw-strings in the bottom of the bag, and fasten\r\n          a pendent hook at the top to hold the meat hanging\r\n          free inside of the bag. With copper wire attach a\r\n          good-sized ring on top of the bag, wire it through\r\n          the handle of the pendent hook and weld them\r\n          together. When in use, the bag should be suspended\r\n          high from the ground by means of a rope pulley run\r\n          through the top ring and over the limb of a\r\n          near-by tree. Similar air-bags can be obtained, if\r\n          desired, from camp-outfitters.\r\n\r\nWhen selecting cooking utensils for the camp, you will find those with\r\ndetachable handles pack better and for that reason are desirable.\r\n\r\nDo not forget that every check-list given may be reduced; don\'t think\r\nyou must include all the items. For these lists give outfits for\r\npermanent as well as temporary camps. If you can manage with _one towel_\r\nby washing it every day, or evening, allowing it to dry during the\r\nnight, one towel will be sufficient; leave the others at home. Drop\r\nfrom the various lists every article you can possibly dispense with and\r\nstill be comfortable in camp.\r\n\r\nIf you wear the camp suit travelling from home to camp, its weight and\r\nbulk will be omitted from your camp pack, and be so much to your gain,\r\nand you will maintain a good appearance notwithstanding, for if well\r\nmade and of proper fit the dress will be a suitable travelling costume.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Camp Packs=\r\n\r\nWhen you intend carrying your belongings and striking the trail either\r\npart or all the way to camp, the easiest method for portage is to stow\r\nthe things in a regular pack and fasten the pack on your back by means\r\nof strong, long straps attached to the pack, and passed over your\r\nshoulders and under your arms.\r\n\r\nA square of water-proof canvas makes a simple and good camp pack. Get a\r\nnine-by-nine-feet (more or less) square of cloth, and it will be found\r\nuseful as shelter, fly, ground-cloth, windbreak, and in other ways after\r\nreaching camp.\r\n\r\n\r\n=What to Put in Your Pack=\r\n\r\nOpen out your pack-cloth flat on the floor, and place your folded\r\nmattress-bag in the centre.\r\n\r\nFill the pillow-bag with your first-aid case and case of toilet\r\narticles, and if there is space for other things pack them in. Lay the\r\npillow-bag on top of the mattress-bag, place clothing by the side and on\r\ntop of the pillow-bag, being careful to keep the contents of your pack\r\nrectangular in shape and of size to fit well over your back.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 32\r\n\r\nCAMP PACK\r\n\r\nBLANKET PACK\r\n\r\n33\r\n\r\nPACK-HARNESS\r\n\r\nMEAT SAFE\r\n\r\nSome things to carry and how to carry them.]\r\n\r\nIf not adding too much to the weight, include many things from your\r\npersonal-belonging list; of these articles you can carry some in the\r\npockets of your camp suit. Everything being in the pack, fold over the\r\nsides and ends, making a neat, compact bundle; tie it securely with a\r\npiece of soft rope and across its top place the blankets with poncho\r\ninside, which you have previously made into a roll to fit. Bind pack and\r\nblankets together, attach the pack shoulder-strap and swing the pack on\r\nyour back.\r\n\r\nPack straps or harness can be obtained at any camp-outfitter\'s.\r\n\r\nA different style of pack may be a bag with square corners, all seams\r\nstrongly stitched, then bound with strong tape. Cut two pieces of the\r\nwater-proof cloth, one about sixteen inches wide, and the other eighteen\r\ninches; this last is for the front and allows more space. Let each piece\r\nbe twenty-one inches long or longer, unite them with a strip of the\r\ncloth six inches wide and sufficiently long to allow of flaps extending\r\nfree at the top to fold over from both sides across the opening; you\r\nwill then have a box-like bag. Make one large flap of width to fit the\r\ntop of the back, and length to cross over on front, covering the smaller\r\nflaps and fastening down on the outside of the front of the pack. All\r\nthree flaps may have pockets to hold small articles.\r\n\r\nThe shoulder-straps may be either of strong government webbing which\r\ncomes for the purpose, tube lamp-wick, or leather.\r\n\r\nWith this pack the blanket and poncho could be made into a thin roll and\r\nfitted around the edges of the pack, or made into a short roll and\r\nattached to top of pack.\r\n\r\nWhen feasible it is a good plan to pack your smaller belongings in\r\nwall-pockets with divisions protected by flaps securely fastened over\r\nthe open ends, the wall-pockets rolled, tied, and carried in the camp\r\npack. These pockets are useful at camp; they help to keep your things\r\nwhere you can find them. Next best is to use small separate labelled\r\nbags for different variety of duffel, and pack them in one or two duffel\r\ntube-shaped bags, which may be bound together, constituting one pack.\r\n\r\nFrom eighteen to twenty-four pounds is average weight for a girl to\r\ncarry; it all depends upon strength and endurance; some girls can carry\r\neven heavier packs, while others must have lighter ones. Beware about\r\nloading yourself down too heavily. Packs grow heavier and heavier, never\r\nlighter on the trail.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Blanket-Roll Pack=\r\n\r\nSide-trips from camp for only one night\'s bivouac will not need a back\r\npack; the few articles required can be carried in your blanket-roll.\r\nSpread the poncho out flat, rubber side down, then your blankets on top,\r\nand group the things you intend to take into two separate oblong groups,\r\none on each side of the central space at one end of the blankets; push\r\nthe articles in each division closely together, leaving the space\r\nbetween the divisions empty. Kneel in front of your blankets and begin\r\nto roll all together tightly, taking care not to allow any of the duffel\r\nto fall out. When the roll is complete, tie the centre with strong, soft\r\nstring, and also each end, and make a hoop of the roll by tying together\r\nthe hanging strings on the two ends. Wear the blanket-roll over left\r\nshoulder, diagonally across back and chest to rest over right hip. If\r\nyou have forgotten a few items, tie the things to the bottom of the\r\nblanket-roll and let them hang like tassels.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Duffel-Bag=\r\n\r\nArticles for general use while at camp can be packed together in one or\r\nmore duffel-bags; if but one bag is needed, provisions might go in the\r\nsame receptacle when space and weight permit. It is much better,\r\nhowever, to have a separate bag for provisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Packing Provisions=\r\n\r\nYou can make or buy separate tube bags of different heights, but all of\r\nthe same diameter, and pack flour in one, corn-meal in another, and so\r\non, having each bag labelled and all, when filled, fitted in one\r\nduffel-bag; you will find these bags a great comfort. They should be of\r\nwater-proof canvas with draw-string at the top. You can purchase\r\nfriction-top cans for butter, etc., of varying depth to accommodate\r\ndifferent quantities which will fit well in the large provision bag.\r\n\r\nA duffel-bag is usually made cylindrical in form with a disk of the\r\ncloth sewed in tight at one end, and the other end closed with\r\ndraw-strings. It is well to have another cloth disk attached to one spot\r\nat the top of the bag, to cover the contents before the draw-strings are\r\nfastened.\r\n\r\nA great variety of desirable camp packs, including duffel-bags,\r\npack-straps, harness, and tump-lines, may be purchased at the\r\ncamp-outfitter\'s; investigate before deciding upon home-made camp packs.\r\nPack-baskets can also be obtained, but all the good-sized pack-baskets I\r\nhave seen, while attractive in appearance, are too rigid, bulky,\r\nsharp-edged, and heavy to be of use to girl campers.\r\n\r\nHaving decided that the wilderness is the place to locate, unless you\r\ncan manage to camp with very little in the way of extra packs, you will\r\nbe obliged to employ a guide to assist in the carry, possibly two\r\nguides, as wilderness trails do not permit of a vehicle, or even a mule\r\nor horse, being used to help in the portage.\r\n\r\nShould your camp be on a more accessible site, the easy portage can be\r\ntaken advantage of and the problem readily solved; but the charm of the\r\nreal forest camp with all its possibilities for genuine life in the\r\nwilderness more, far more, than compensates for the extra difficulties\r\nin reaching camp. Really, though, the very difficulties are but part of\r\nthe sport; they give zest and add to the fun of the trail.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nOUTDOOR HANDICRAFT\r\n\r\n=Camp Furnishings--Dressing-Table, Seats, Dining-Table, Cupboard, Broom,\r\nChair, Racks, Birch-Bark Dishes, etc.=\r\n\r\n\r\nCamp is the place where girls enjoy most proving their powers of\r\nresourcefulness.\r\n\r\nIt is fun to supply a want with the mere natural raw materials found in\r\nthe open, and when you succeed in making a useful article of outdoor\r\nthings, the entire camp takes a pride in your work and the simple but\r\npractical and usable production gives a hundred per cent more pleasure\r\nthan could a store article manufactured for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nBe comfortable at camp. While it is good to live simply in the open, it\r\nis also good to be comfortable in the open, and with experience you will\r\nbe surprised to find what a delightful life can be lived at camp with\r\nbut few belongings and the simplest of camp furnishings. These last can,\r\nin a great measure, be made of tree branches and the various stuffs\r\nfound in the woods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Handicraft in the woods.\r\n\r\nDetails of the outdoor dressing-table. Comb-racks of forked sticks and\r\nof split sticks.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Dressing-Table=\r\n\r\nA near-by tree will furnish the substantial foundation for your\r\ndressing-table and wash-stand combined. If you can find a side-piece of\r\na wooden box, use it for the shelf and fasten this shelf on the trunk of\r\na tree about two and one-half feet or more above the ground. Cut two\r\nrustic braces and nail the front of the shelf on the top ends of these\r\nsupports; then nail a strip of wood across the tree as a cleat on which\r\nto rest the back of the shelf; fit the shelf on the cleat and nail the\r\nlower ends of the braces to the tree; strengthen the work still more by\r\ndriving a strong, long nail on each side of the top centre of the back\r\nof shelf, diagonally down through the shelf, cleat, and into the tree.\r\n\r\nIt is not essential that the straight shelf edge fit perfectly to the\r\nrounded tree, but if you desire to have it so, mark a semicircle on the\r\nwood of size to fit the tree and whittle it out.\r\n\r\nShould there be no piece of box for your shelf, make the shelf of\r\nstrong, slender sticks lashed securely close together on two side\r\nsticks. For cleats and braces use similar sticks described for board\r\nshelf.\r\n\r\nWhen the shelf is made in this way, cover the top with birch bark or\r\nother bark to give a flat surface.\r\n\r\nHang your mirror on a nail in the tree at convenient distance above the\r\nshelf, and your tooth-brush on another nail. The towel may hang over the\r\nextending end of the cleat, and you can make a small bark dish for the\r\nsoap. Your comb can rest on two forked-stick supports tacked on the\r\ntree, or two split-end sticks.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Camp-Seats=\r\n\r\nStones, logs, stumps, raised outstanding roots of trees, and boxes, when\r\nobtainable, must be your outdoor chairs, stools, and seats until others\r\ncan be made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Outdoor dressing-table, camp-cupboard, hammock-frame,\r\nseat, and pot-hook.]\r\n\r\nTwo trees standing near together may be used to advantage as uprights\r\nfor a camp seat. Cut a small horizontal kerf or notch at the same height\r\non opposite sides of both trees, get two strong poles (green wood), fit\r\nthem in the wedges and nail them to the trees; then lash them firmly in\r\nplace. Be absolutely certain that these poles are of strong wood,\r\nfirmly attached to the trees and not liable to slide or break.\r\n\r\nMake the seat by lashing sticks across from pole to pole, placing them\r\nclose together. Two more long poles, fastened to the trees at a proper\r\ndistance above the seat, would give a straight back, if a back is\r\ndesired, but it is not essential; with a folded blanket spread over it,\r\nthe seat alone is a luxury.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Camp-Table=\r\n\r\nA table can be built in much the same way as the seat and will answer\r\nthe purpose well if one of boards is not to be had. For the table make\r\nyour crosspieces about twenty-two inches long, nail them ladder-like but\r\nclose together on two poles, and make this table top flat on the surface\r\nby covering it with birch bark tacked on smoothly. Having previously\r\nfastened two other poles across from tree to tree, as you did when\r\nmaking the seat, you can lift the table top and lay it on the two\r\nfoundation poles; then bind it in place and the table will be finished.\r\nAnother way of using the table top is to drive four strong, stout,\r\nforked sticks into the ground for the four table legs and place the\r\ntable top across, resting the long side poles in the crotches of the\r\nstakes, where they may be lashed in place.\r\n\r\nBenches for the table can be made in like manner, only have the\r\nforked-stick legs shorter, raising the seat about eighteen inches above\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Camp-chair, biscuit-stick, and blanket camp-bed.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Camp-Cupboard=\r\n\r\nA cupboard made of a wooden box by inserting shelves, held up by means\r\nof cleats, will be found very convenient when nailed to a tree near the\r\ncook-fire. Hang a door on the cupboard which will close tight and\r\nfasten securely. Have this in mind when making out your check list, and\r\nadd hinges, with screws to fit, to your camp tools.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Camp-Broom=\r\n\r\nWith a slender pole as a handle, hickory shoots, or twisted fibre of\r\ninner bark of slippery-elm, for twine, and a thick bunch of the top\r\nbranchlets of balsam, spruce, hemlock, or pine for the brush part, you\r\ncan make a broom by binding the heavy ends of the branches tight to an\r\nencircling groove cut on the handle some three inches from the end. Cut\r\nthe bottom of the brush even and straight.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Camp-Chair=\r\n\r\nIf you have a good-size length of canvas or other strong cloth, make a\r\ncamp-chair. For the back use two strong, forked stakes standing upright,\r\nand use two long poles with branching stubs at equal distance from the\r\nbottom, for the sides and front legs of the chair; in the crotches of\r\nthese stubs the bottom stick on which the canvas strip is fastened will\r\nrest.\r\n\r\nEach side pole must be fitted into one of the forked high-back stakes,\r\nand then the top stick on the canvas strip must be placed in the same\r\ncrotches, but in front of and resting against the side poles, thus\r\nlocking the side poles firmly in place.\r\n\r\nTo fasten the canvas on the two sticks, cut one stick to fit across the\r\nchair-back and the other to fit across the lower front stubs. Fold one\r\nend of the canvas strip over one stick and nail the canvas on it, so\r\narranging the cloth that the row of nails will come on the under side of\r\nthe stick. Turn in the edge first that the nails may go through the\r\ndouble thickness of cloth. Adjust this canvas-covered stick to the top\r\nof the chair, allowing the cloth to form a loose hanging seat; measure\r\nthe length needed for back and seat, cut it off and nail the loose end\r\nof the canvas strip to the other stick; then fit one stick in the top of\r\nthe upright back stakes and the other stick in the bottom stubs.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Camp Clothes-Press=\r\n\r\nIf you are in a tent tie a hanging pole from the tent ridge-pole, and\r\nuse it as a clothes-press.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Blanket Bed=\r\n\r\nTwo short logs will be required for your blanket bed, the thicker the\r\nbetter, one for the head and one for the foot, also two long, strong,\r\ngreen-wood poles, one for each side of the bed; your blanket will be the\r\nmattress.\r\n\r\nFold the blanket, making the seam, formed by bringing the two ends\r\ntogether, run on the under-side along the centre of the doubled blanket,\r\nnot on the edge. Lap and fasten the blanket ends together with large\r\nhorse-blanket safety-pins, and with the same kind of pins make a case on\r\neach side of the blanket fold; then run one of the poles through each\r\ncase. Chop a notch near each end of the two short logs; in these notches\r\nplace the ends of the poles and nail them securely. Have the short logs\r\nthick enough to raise the bed up a few inches from the ground, and make\r\nthe notches sufficiently far apart to stretch the mattress out smooth,\r\nnot have it sag. A strip of canvas or khaki may be used in place of the\r\nblanket if preferred.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Camp Hammock=\r\n\r\nBy lashing short crosspieces to the head and foot of the side poles the\r\nblanket mattress can be a hammock and swing between two trees, having\r\nbeen attached to them with rope or straps of slippery-elm, beech, or\r\nblack birch.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Birch-Bark Dishes=\r\n\r\nIt will be easy for girls to make their birch-bark dinner plates,\r\nvegetable dishes, baskets, dippers, etc. Soften the thick bark by\r\nsoaking it in water; when it is pliable cut one plate the size you wish,\r\nlay it on a flat stone or other hard substance and scrape off the\r\noutside bark around the edges, allowing the outer bark to remain on the\r\nbottom of the plate to give greater strength; use this plate as a guide\r\nin cutting each of the others.\r\n\r\nWith your fingers shape the edges of the plates in an upward turn while\r\nthe bark is wet, using the smoothest side for the inside of the plate.\r\n\r\nA large bark cornucopia with bark strap-handle can be made and carried\r\non the arm in place of a basket when off berrying.\r\n\r\nVariations of circular, oblong, and rectangular bark dishes may be\r\nworked out from strips and rectangular pieces of birch bark, and all\r\ndishes can be turned into baskets by adding handles. When necessary to\r\nsew the edges of bark together, always have the bark wet and soft; then\r\nlap the edges and use a very coarse darning-needle with twine of\r\ninner-bark fibre or rootlets; have ready hot melted grease mixed with\r\nspruce gum to coat over the stitching and edges of the article, or you\r\ncan use white-birch resin for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nThe bark utensils will wear longer if a slender rootlet or branchlet of\r\npliable wood is sewed, with the "over-and-over" stitch, to the edge of\r\nthe article.\r\n\r\nFor round and oblong dishes or baskets, sew together the two ends of\r\nyour strip of wet bark; then sew the round or oblong bottom on the lower\r\nedge of the bark circle. In this case it is not easy to lap the edges,\r\nsimply bring them together and finish the seam with the addition of the\r\nslender rootlet binding.\r\n\r\nRectangular dishes are made by folding the wet bark according to the\r\ndiagrams and fastening the folds near the top of both ends of the\r\nreceptacle. These will hold liquids.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The birch-bark dish that will hold fluids. Details of\r\nmaking.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cooking Utensils=\r\n\r\nA forked stick with points sharpened makes a fine toasting-fork or\r\nbroiling-stick for bacon or other small pieces of meat. The meat is\r\nstuck on the two prongs and held over the fire.\r\n\r\nA split-end stick may be used for the same purpose by wedging the bacon\r\nin between the two sides of the split.\r\n\r\nYour rolling-pin can be a peeled, straight, smooth, round stick, and a\r\nsimilar stick, not necessarily straight but longer, may do duty as a\r\nbiscuit baker when a strip of dough is wound spirally around it and held\r\nover the fire.\r\n\r\nA hot flat stone can also be used for baking biscuits, and a large\r\nflat-topped rock makes a substitute for table and bread-board combined.\r\n\r\nIf you have canned goods, save every tin can when empty, melt off the\r\ntop, and with nail and hammer puncture a hole on two opposite sides near\r\nthe top, and fasten in a rootlet handle. These cans make very\r\nserviceable and useful cooking-pails.\r\n\r\nWhittle out a long-handled cake-turner from a piece of thin split wood,\r\nand also whittle out a large flat fork.\r\n\r\nMake a number of pot-hooks of different lengths, they are constantly\r\nneeded at camp; select strong green sticks with a crotch on one end and\r\ndrive a nail slantingly into the wood near the bottom of the stick on\r\nwhich to hang kettles, pots, etc. Be sure to have the nail turn up and\r\nthe short side of the crotch turn down as in diagram.\r\n\r\nCampers employ various methods of making candlesticks. One method is to\r\nlash a candle to the side of the top of a stake driven into the ground,\r\nor the stake can have a split across the centre of the top, and the\r\ncandle held upright by a strip of bark wedged in the split with a loop\r\non one side holding the candle and the two ends of the bark extending\r\nout beyond the other side of the stake. Again the candle is stuck into a\r\nlittle mound of clay, mud, or wet sand. If you have an old glass bottle,\r\ncrack off the bottom by pouring a little water in the bottle and placing\r\nit for a short while on the fire embers; then plant your candle in the\r\nground and slide the neck of the bottle over the candle. Steady it by\r\nplanting the neck of the bottle a little way in the ground and the glass\r\nbottle will act as a windbreak for your candle.\r\n\r\nNever leave a candle burning even for a moment unless some one is\r\npresent; it is a dangerous experiment. Fire cannot be trifled with. _Put\r\nout_ your candle before leaving it.\r\n\r\nA good idea before going away from camp when vacation is over is to\r\nphotograph all the different pieces of your outdoor handicraft, and when\r\nthe prints are made label each one with the month, date, and year and\r\nstate material used, time required in the making, and comments on the\r\nwork by other camp members.\r\n\r\nBe sure to take photographs of different views of the camp as a whole,\r\nalso of each separate shelter, both the outside and the inside, and have\r\npictures of all camp belongings.\r\n\r\nThe authors will be greatly interested in seeing these.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A bear would rather be your friend than your enemy.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nMAKING FRIENDS WITH THE OUTDOOR FOLK\r\n\r\n=In the Woods, the Fields, on the Shore. Stalking Animals and Birds=\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is but one way to make friends with the folk of the wild, and that\r\nis by gentleness, kindness, and quietness. Also one must learn to be\r\nfearless. It is said that while animals may not understand our language\r\nthey do understand, or feel, our attitude toward them; and if it is that\r\nof fear or dislike we stand little chance of really knowing them, to say\r\nnothing of establishing any kind of friendly relations with them. By\r\nquiet watchfulness, keenness of sight and hearing, you may obtain a\r\ncertain amount of knowledge of their ways, but when you add real\r\nsympathy and kindly feeling you gain their confidence and friendship.\r\nMake them understand that you will not interfere with or harm them, and\r\nthey will go about their own affairs unafraid in your presence. Then you\r\nmay silently watch their manner of living, their often amusing habits,\r\nand their frank portrayal of character. As a guest in the wild,\r\nconducting yourself as a courteous guest should, you will be well\r\ntreated by your wild hosts, some of whom, in time, may even permit you\r\nto feed and stroke them. They do not dislike but fear you; they would\r\nrather be your friends than your enemies. The baby animal which has not\r\nyet learned to fear a human being will sometimes, when in danger, run to\r\nyou for protection. This must win your heart if nothing else can.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Making friends with a ruffed grouse.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Stalking=\r\n\r\nYou may stalk an animal by remaining quiet as well as by following its\r\ntrail. To even see some of the inhabitants of woods, fields, and shore\r\nyou must be willing to exercise great patience and conform to their\r\nmethod of hiding by remaining absolutely still. It is the thing that\r\nmoves that they fear. Some of the animals appear not even to see a\r\nperson who remains motionless. At any rate, they ignore him as they do a\r\nstump or stone.\r\n\r\nFor this quiet stalking, find as comfortable a seat as you can where you\r\nhave reason to think some kind of animal or animals will pass and resign\r\nyourself to immovable waiting. If the rock beneath you grows\r\nunreasonably hard or the tree roots develop sharp edges, or the ground\r\nsends up unnoticed stones of torment; if your foot "goes to sleep" or\r\nyour nose itches, bear the annoyances bravely and your reward will be\r\nsure and ample. If the wait is unduly long and movement of some kind\r\nbecomes imperative, let such movement be made so slowly as to be almost\r\nimperceptible. Remember that unseen, suspicious eyes will be attracted\r\nby any sudden action and the faintest sound will be heard, for these\r\nspell danger to the wilderness folk and if frightened away they are not\r\napt to return.\r\n\r\nKeep your ears open to detect the first sound of approaching life. There\r\nis a thrill in this experience, and another when the animal you have\r\nheard comes boldly out before you. Then it is you will find that, in\r\nsome mysterious way, all bodily discomfort has vanished. Your whole\r\nbeing is absorbed in the movements of the creature who is unconscious of\r\nyour presence, and there is no room for other sensations. More animals\r\nmay appear and perhaps a little drama may be enacted as if for your\r\nbenefit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Found on the trail.\r\n\r\nChipmunk and white-footed mouse, panther, kangaroo rat, raccoon, and\r\nweasel.]\r\n\r\nIt may be a tragedy, it may be a comedy, or it may be only a bit of\r\nevery-day family life; but you do not know the plot nor how many actors\r\nwill take part, and your very uncertainty adds zest to the situation.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Animals Found on the Trail=\r\n\r\nThe animals most frequently seen in the woods where there is no longer\r\nany large game are the chipmunk, the red, the gray, and the black\r\nsquirrel, the rabbit and hare, the fox, weasel, pine-marten, woodchuck,\r\nraccoon, opossum, and skunk, also the pack-rat (of the west), the\r\nwhite-footed and field mouse. In deeper and wilder forests there are\r\ndeer and porcupine, though deer are found quite near habitations at\r\ntimes. In more remote places there are the moose and caribou; the bear,\r\nmountain-lion, lynx or wildcat, and the timber-wolf. The wolf is,\r\nhowever, equally at home in the open and at this day is most plentiful\r\non the wide plains of the west. Unless your trail leads through the\r\nremote wilderness, you will hardly come across the more savage animals,\r\nand when you do invade their territory it will give you greater courage\r\nto call to mind the fact that they, as well as the smaller wild things,\r\nare afraid of man. Our most experienced hunters and our best writers on\r\nthe subject of animal life agree that a wild animal\'s first emotion upon\r\nseeing a human being is undoubtedly _fear_. When you come upon one\r\nsuddenly you may feel sure that he is as much frightened as you are and\r\nwill probably turn aside to avoid you unless he thinks you are going to\r\nattack him. All wild creatures are afraid of fire, therefore the\r\ncamp-fire is a barrier they will not pass, and a blazing firebrand will\r\ndrive any of them away.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Timber wolves.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Birds=\r\n\r\nAmong the feathered tribes of the woods you will find the owl, the\r\nwoodcock, and the grouse. Of the smaller birds, the nuthatch, the wood\r\nand hermit thrush, whippoorwill, woodpeckers, wood-pewee, and others.\r\nMost of the birds prefer the edge of the woods, where they can dip into\r\nthe sunshine and take long flights through the free air of the open; but\r\nthe hermit-thrush, shyest and sweetest of singers, makes his home deep\r\nin the silent, shadowy forest. In these depths, and oftenest near a bog\r\nor marsh, you may also hear the call of the partridge, or more properly,\r\nthe ruffed grouse. As given by the writer William J. Long, the call is\r\nlike this:\r\n\r\n"Prut, prut, pr-r-r-rt! Whit-kwit? Pr-r-r-rt, pr-r-r-rt! Ooo-it, ooo-it?\r\nPr-r-reeee!"\r\n\r\nOr perhaps you will be startled by the rolling drum-call. This begins\r\nslowly, increases rapidly, and ends something like this: "Dum! dum! dum!\r\ndum-dum-dum-dumdumdum!" The drum-call is made by the male bird who,\r\nbeating the air with his wings, produces the sound. It is said to be a\r\nmating-call, but is heard at other times as well, long after the\r\nmating-season is over.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Baby moose.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Stalking the Ruffed Grouse=\r\n\r\nIf you want to see the birds, stalk them when you hear their call. Wait\r\nuntil you locate the direction of the sound, then walk silently and\r\nfollow it. As soon as the birds are sighted slip from one tree to\r\nanother, stopping instantly when you think they may see you, until you\r\ncan conceal yourself behind a bush, tree, or stump near enough for you\r\nto peer around and have a good view of your game. It may sometimes be\r\nnecessary to drop to your knees in order to keep out of sight. If you\r\nhave heard the drum it is the cock that you have stalked and, if early\r\nin the season, you will soon see his demure little mate steal through\r\nthe underbrush to meet her lordly master as he stands proudly on an old\r\nlog awaiting her. The "whit-kwit" call may lead you to the hen grouse\r\nwith her brood of little chicks which are so much the color of the brown\r\nleaves you will not see them until they move. If the call comes later in\r\nthe year you may come upon a flock of well-grown young birds who have\r\nleft their mother and are now following a leader.\r\n\r\nThe ruffed grouse is a beautiful bird. He is yellowish-brown or rusty,\r\nsplashed with black or dark brown, and white, with under-parts of a\r\nlight buff. His beak is short and on his small, dainty head he carries\r\nhis crest proudly. His shoulders bear epaulets of dark feathers, called\r\nthe ruff, and his fan-like tail is banded and cross-barred. The nest of\r\nthe grouse is on the ground, usually against a fallen log, at the foot\r\nof a tree, or in a hollow made by the roots; or it may be hidden amid\r\nunderbrush. It is easily overlooked, being made of dry leaves with,\r\nperhaps, some feathers. In the season it contains from eight to fourteen\r\neggs.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Woodcock=\r\n\r\nThe woodcock, another forest bird, seldom shows himself in broad\r\ndaylight except when hunted; then he will rise a few feet, fly a short\r\ndistance, drop and run, hiding again as quickly as he can. You will know\r\nthe woodcock from the ruffed grouse by his _long bill_, his short legs,\r\nand his very short tail. He frequents the banks of wooded streams or the\r\nbogs of the forests and, like the grouse, nests on the ground; but the\r\nwoodcock\'s nest seldom contains more than four eggs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Stalking wild birds.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Beaver=\r\n\r\nAlong the shores of sluggish streams, of lonely lakes and ponds, you may\r\nsee the beaver, the muskrat, very rarely the otter, and sometimes an\r\nugly little, long-bodied animal belonging to the marten family called\r\nthe fisher. These are all interesting, each in its own way, and well\r\nworth hours of quiet observation. The beaver, otter, and fisher choose\r\nwild, secluded places for their homes, but the muskrat may be found also\r\nin the marshes of farm lands. On the edges of our Long Island meadows\r\nthe boys trap muskrats for their skins.\r\n\r\nYou will find the beaver house in the water close to the shore and\r\noverlapping it. Though strongly and carefully built, it looks very much\r\nlike a jumble of small driftwood, with bleached sticks well packed\r\ntogether, and the ends standing out at all angles. The sticks are\r\nstripped of their bark and the house gleams whitely against the dark\r\nwater. The houses vary in size, some being built as high as five feet.\r\nThe beaver is rarely seen early in the day, most of his work is done at\r\nnight, so the best time to watch for him is just before dusk or perhaps\r\nan hour before sundown. It is not well to wait to see the beaver if your\r\ntrail back to camp is a long one, leading through dense forests. You\r\nwould far better postpone making its acquaintance than to risk going\r\nover the, perhaps, treacherous paths after dark. Night comes early in\r\nthe woods and darkness shuts down closely while it is still light in the\r\nopen. If your camp is near the beaver house or beaver dam, or if your\r\ntrip can be made by water, then, with no anxiety about your return, you\r\ncan sit down and calmly await the coming of this most skilful of all\r\nbuilding animals, and may see him add material to his house, or go on\r\nwith his work of cutting down a tree, as a reward for your patience.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Fish-Hawk, Osprey=\r\n\r\nOn the shore you will also find the fish-hawk, or osprey; a\r\nwell-mannered bird he is said to be, who fishes diligently and attends\r\nstrictly to his own business. The fish-hawk\'s nest will generally be at\r\nthe top of a dead tree where no one may disturb or look into it, though,\r\nas the accompanying photograph shows, it is sometimes found on rocks\r\nnear the ground. The young hawks have a way of their own of defending\r\nthemselves from any climbing creature, and to investigators of the nest\r\nthe results are disastrously disagreeable as well as laughable. As the\r\nintruder climbs near, the baby birds put their heads over the sides of\r\nthe nest and empty their stomachs upon him. This is vouched for by a\r\nwell-known writer who claims to have gone through the experience.\r\n\r\nThe female osprey is larger and stronger than the male. On slowly moving\r\nwings she sails over the water, dropping suddenly to clutch in her\r\nstrong talons the fish her keen eyes have detected near the surface of\r\nthe water. Fish are fish to the osprey and salt waters or fresh are the\r\nsame to her. I have watched the bird plunge into the waves of the ocean,\r\non the coast of Maine, to bring out a cunner almost too large for her to\r\ncarry, and I have seen her drop into the placid waters of an Adirondack\r\nlake for lake-trout in the same manner.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Blue Heron=\r\n\r\nThe great blue heron is one of the shore folk and his metallic blue-gray\r\nbody gleams in the sunlight, as you sight him from your canoe, standing\r\ntall and slim, a lonely figure on the bank. He flies slowly and\r\nmajestically, with his long legs streaming out behind. When out in a\r\nsmall boat on Puget Sound a large heron escorted us some distance. As\r\nwe rowed near the shore he would fly ahead and then wait for us,\r\nstanding solemnly on a stone in the water or a partially submerged log,\r\nto fly again as we approached.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The fish-hawk will sometimes build near the ground.]\r\n\r\nThis escort business seems to be a habit of the heron family, for the\r\nsame thing occurred on the Tomoca River, Fla., the home of the\r\nalligator, when a small, brilliantly blue heron flew ahead of our boat\r\nfor several miles, always stopping to wait for us, and then going on\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe heron is a fisher and when you see him standing close to the water,\r\non one foot perhaps, he is awaiting his game. It matters not how long he\r\nmust remain immovable, there he will stand until the fish comes within\r\nstriking distance, when the long, curved neck will shoot out like a\r\nsnake and the strong beak grasp its unwary prey.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Loon, Great Northern Diver=\r\n\r\nAnother interesting bird, which you may both hear and see on secluded\r\nlakes, is the loon or great northern diver. I first heard the wild cry\r\nof the loon, a lonesome and eerie sound, on Pine River Pond, a small\r\nlake in the foot-hills of the White Mountains. There I saw the great\r\nbird dive and disappear beneath the water to remain an alarmingly long\r\ntime, and then come up several hundred yards away, and rising, fly\r\nslowly to the shore. It is always a matter for guessing when the loon\r\ndives, for you can never tell where she will come up. This great diver\r\nis a large black-and-white bird, about the size of a goose. The breast\r\nis white, head black, and a white ring encircles its black neck. Its\r\nbeak is long, its legs very short and placed far back on the body. It is\r\nessentially a water-bird, and on shore is both slow and awkward. I do\r\nnot think it possible to become very intimate with the loon, for it is\r\none of the wildest of our birds, and so suspicious it will allow no\r\nclose approach, but quiet watching will reveal many of its interesting\r\ncharacteristics. Some one once found the nest of a loon and brought me a\r\nlittle, downy, young one that I might try to tame it; but it lived only\r\na day or two in spite of all the devotion expended upon it, and its\r\nwild, frightened cry was too pathetic to allow of another experiment of\r\nthe kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Animals and Birds of the Open=\r\n\r\nYou will find that the wild life of the open differs in some respects\r\nfrom that of the woods, though there will be the woodchuck, the rabbit,\r\nthe fox, and the hare in the fields and farm lands as well as in the\r\nwoods. The weasel, too, makes unwelcome visits to the farm, but besides\r\nthese there are other animals that are seldom or never found in the\r\nwoods.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Field-Mouse=\r\n\r\nThere is the little field-mouse, a short-eared and short-tailed little\r\ncreature with a thick neck and of a red-brown color. It feeds on grain\r\nand seeds, and when hard pressed for food will also eat the bark of\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Kangaroo-Rat, Jumping Mouse=\r\n\r\nIn the underbrush near a meadow and at the edges of thickets you may\r\npossibly see, though they are not common, a diminutive animal, beautiful\r\nin form and color and of most interesting habits. In the Southwest it is\r\ncalled the kangaroo-rat, but North and East it is known as the jumping\r\nmouse. The name kangaroo-rat is given because of its short fore legs,\r\nstrong hind legs, and the kangaroo-like leaps it makes. In temper it is\r\nvery unlike the ordinary rat; it does not bite and can be safely\r\nhandled, but will not live if kept in captivity.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pocket-Gopher=\r\n\r\nThe pocket-gopher lives and burrows in the fields. It is a mole-like\r\nanimal but much larger than the common mole. Its legs are short and its\r\nfront feet strong, with long nails for digging. The fur is soft and\r\nsilky and dark brown in color. Where the gopher is there may be found\r\nthe weasel, his greatest enemy. It should be an even fight between them,\r\nfor they are equally matched in ill-temper and savageness, and are near\r\nof a size though the gopher is the heavier.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Antelope=\r\n\r\nOn the great plains of the west you may still see the beautiful and\r\ngentle antelope, though that animal is fast disappearing, while the\r\nthieving coyote thrives and multiplies in the same region.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Coyote, Prairie-Wolf=\r\n\r\nThe coyote, or prairie-wolf, is about the size of a large dog and\r\nresembles one. Its color is gray, made by a mixture of black and white\r\nhairs. It is a cowardly animal and not dangerous, but its contemptible\r\ncharacter could not prevent a wave of compassion that came over me when\r\nI saw one poor creature caged in a wooden box and holding up the bloody\r\nstump where its fore foot had been torn off by the cruel and barbarous\r\nsteel trap.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Spermophile=\r\n\r\nIn the Middle West, especially in Indiana, the little spermophile,\r\nsometimes called the ground-squirrel, is common and not afraid to\r\nventure into the outskirts of a village. One variety wears spotted brown\r\nand yellow stripes down its back, another is gray, but all are about\r\nthe size of a gray squirrel. On the western prairies are the comical\r\nlittle prairie-dogs. You can see them sitting up on their haunches\r\nwatching the train as it carries you over the great plains.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Antelopes of the western plains.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Bobolink=\r\n\r\nThe birds of the open are varied and many. Most of the forest birds are\r\nseen occasionally in the fields, but some birds make their homes in the\r\nopen. You will find the bobolink\'s nest in a hay-field or down among the\r\nred clover. The bobolink of the north is a sweet singer and is pretty in\r\nhis black and white feathers with a touch of yellow at the back of his\r\nhead. There are creamy-yellow feathers down his back, too, but they are\r\nnot noticeable. When he goes south the male loses his pretty coat and,\r\nclad like his mate in yellowish-brown, is known as the rice-bird because\r\nhe feeds on the rice crops. Here he is killed because he is considered a\r\nrobber, and eaten because he is considered a delicacy.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Meadow-Lark=\r\n\r\nEarly spring trailing through the meadows will bring you the cheery song\r\nof the meadow-lark: "Spring-o-the-year!" Stalk him carefully and you\r\nwill find a large brown bird with yellow breast and a black crescent on\r\nhis throat. The meadow-lark is about the size of a quail. He stands\r\nerect when he sings, and he has a rather long beak. The nest can be\r\nfound, if you look for it, but is generally out of sight under a\r\nloosened clod of earth or tuft of grass.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Red-Winged Blackbird=\r\n\r\nThe red-winged blackbird with his sweet call of "O-ka-lie," or\r\n"Ouchee-la-ree-e!" you will also find on the meadows and marshes. He\r\nbuilds his nest among the reeds and is one of the first of our spring\r\nbirds in the north.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Song Sparrow=\r\n\r\nThe little song sparrow loves the open and the hot summer sunshine.\r\nTrailing along a country road at midday, when most of the other birds\r\nare still, you will find the song sparrow sitting on a rail fence\r\nsinging with undiminished enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nTo make friends with the birds provide food and water for them, then sit\r\ndown and wait quietly until they appear. Let them become accustomed to\r\nseeing you sitting still every day for a while, then begin slow, careful\r\nmovements, gradually becoming more natural, and in time the birds will\r\nallow you to walk among them as you please, if you are careful never to\r\nfrighten them. You can do this in camp; you can do it at home if you are\r\nnot living in a city. The trustful friendship of animals and birds opens\r\na new path of happiness and one that all girls should be able, in some\r\nmeasure, to enjoy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nWILD FOOD ON THE TRAIL\r\n\r\n=Edible Fruits, Nuts, Roots, and Plants=\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile wild foods gathered on the trail give a delightful variety to camp\r\nfare, be advised and do not gather, still less eat, them unless you are\r\nabsolutely sure you know what they are and that they are not poisonous.\r\nYou must be able to identify a thing with certainty before tasting in\r\norder to enjoy it in safety. It is well worth while to make a study of\r\nthe wild-growing foods, but in the meantime this chapter will help you\r\nto know some of them. _The italicized names are of the things I know to\r\nbe edible from personal experience._ You are probably well acquainted\r\nwith the common wild fruits such as the raspberry, strawberry,\r\nblackberry, blueberry, and huckleberry, but there are varieties of these\r\nand all will bear description.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Red Raspberry=\r\n\r\nThe wild berry often has a more delicious flavor and perfume than the\r\ncultivated one of the same species. Nothing can approach the wonderful\r\nand delicate flavor of the little wild strawberry, unless it is the wild\r\nred raspberry; and the fully ripe wild blackberry holds a spicy\r\nsweetness that makes the garden blackberry taste tame and flat in\r\ncomparison.\r\n\r\nThe _wild red raspberry_ is found in open fields and growing along\r\nfences and the sides of the road. The flowers are white and grow in\r\nloose clusters, while the berry, when fully ripe, is a deep, translucent\r\nred. The bush is shrubby, is generally about waist-high, and the stems\r\nbear small, hooked prickles. The leaves are what is called compound,\r\nbeing composed of three or five leaflets, usually three, which branch\r\nout from the main stem like the leaves of the rose-bush. The edges of\r\nthe leaves are irregularly toothed.\r\n\r\nThe berry is cup-shaped and fits over a core which is called the\r\nreceptacle, and from which it loosens when ripe to drop easily into your\r\nhand, leaving the receptacle and calyx on the stem. The sweet,\r\nfar-carrying perfume of the gathered wild red raspberry will always\r\nidentify it. The season for fruit is July and August.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Black Raspberry=\r\n\r\nThe growth and leaves of the _wild black raspberry_ are like those of\r\nthe red raspberry, and it is found in the same localities. The fruit,\r\nlike the other, is cup or thimble shaped and grows on a receptacle from\r\nwhich it loosens when fully ripe. Blackcaps, these berries are often\r\ncalled. They ripen in July. The berry is sometimes a little dry, but the\r\nflavor is sweet and fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Purple-Flowering Raspberry=\r\n\r\nThe purple-flowering raspberry is acid and insipid; it can hardly be\r\ncalled edible, though it is not poisonous. You will find it clambering\r\namong the rocks on the mountainside and in rocky soil. The leaves are\r\nlarge and resemble grape leaves, while the flower is large, purplish-red\r\nin color, and grows in loose clusters.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mountain Raspberry, Cloudberry=\r\n\r\nThe usual home of the mountain raspberry, or cloudberry, is on the\r\nmountain-tops among the clouds. You will find it in the White Mountains\r\nand on the coast of Maine, and it has recently been discovered at\r\nMontauk Point, L. I. The fruit has a pleasant flavor of a honey-like\r\nsweetness. The receptacle of the berry is broad and flat, the color is\r\nyellow touched with red where exposed to the sun. It does not grow in\r\nclusters like the other raspberries, but is solitary. The leaves are\r\nroundish with from five to nine lobes, something like the leaves of the\r\ngeranium. The plant grows low, is without prickles, and the solitary\r\nflowers are white. In the far north, where it is found in great\r\nprofusion, the cloudberry is made into delicious jam.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Wild Strawberry=\r\n\r\nWhen crossing sandy knolls or open, uncultivated fields and pastures,\r\nthe alluring perfume of the _wild strawberry_ will sometimes lead you to\r\nthe patch which shows the bright-red little berry on its low-growing\r\nplant. It is common everywhere, though it bears the name of wild\r\nVirginia strawberry. In Latin it is most appropriately called\r\n_Fragaria_, meaning fragrant. The leaves are compound with three\r\ncoarsely toothed, hairy leaflets. The small white flowers grow in sparse\r\nclusters on rather long, hairy stems. They have many deep yellow stamens\r\nwhich are surrounded by the fine white petals. In fruiting time the\r\nleaves are often bright-red.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Low Running Blackberry=\r\n\r\nAmong the mountains and hills, down in the valleys, and on the plains;\r\nstraggling along roadsides, clinging to fence rails, and sprawling over\r\nrocks, you will find the wild blackberry. There are several varieties,\r\nand blackberries of some kind are common throughout the United States.\r\n\r\nThe _low running blackberry_ belongs to the dewberry type and bears the\r\nlargest and juiciest berries. It is a trailing vine with compound leaves\r\nof from four to seven leaflets which are double-toothed. The berries are\r\nblack and glossy and grow in small clusters. They are sweet and pulpy\r\nwhen thoroughly ripe and the best ones are those which ripen slowly\r\nunder the shelter of the leaves.\r\n\r\nBlackberries grow on a receptacle or core, but unlike the raspberry,\r\nthey do not separate from it. When ripe they drop easily from the calyx\r\ncarrying the receptacle with them. The flowers are small and white, and\r\ngrow in clusters.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Running Swamp Blackberry=\r\n\r\nPerhaps you have seen the blackberry with fruit so small it seems only\r\npartially developed and, like myself, have hesitated to taste it, not\r\nbeing sure that it was a true blackberry and edible. It takes a good\r\nmany of these little berries to make a mouthful, but they are harmless.\r\nThey are called the _running swamp blackberry_. They ripen in August and\r\ngrow in sandy places as well as in the swamps. There are three leaflets,\r\nseldom more, to the stem, which are blunt at the tip, smooth, shining,\r\nand coarsely toothed. The flowers are small and white, and the stems\r\nprickly.\r\n\r\n\r\n=High-Bush Blackberry=\r\n\r\nThroughout the northern states as far west as Iowa, Kansas, and Missouri\r\nand down to North Carolina, you may find the _high-bush blackberry_. Its\r\nstems are sometimes ten feet high; they are furrowed and thorny and the\r\nbush grows along country roads, by fences, and in the woods. The berries\r\nare sweet, but quite seedy. They grow in long, loose clusters and ripen\r\nin July.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mountain Blackberry=\r\n\r\nThere is another variety called the _mountain blackberry_. It has a\r\nspicy flavor, but the fruit is small and dry. The leaves are more\r\nelongated toward the tip than those of the others and they are finely\r\ntoothed. The branches are reddish in color.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Thornless Blackberry=\r\n\r\nThe sweetest of all varieties is said to be the thornless blackberry. It\r\nripens later than the others and has no thorns. The leaves are long and\r\nnarrow.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Eastern Wild Gooseberry=\r\n\r\nAmong the mountains from Massachusetts to North Carolina, the eastern\r\nwild gooseberry grows. It is said that its flavor is delicious. The\r\nfruit is purplish in color and is free from all prickles. It grows on\r\nslender stems and, like the cultivated gooseberry, is tipped with the\r\ndry calyx. The leaves are small, rather round, and have three or five\r\nlobes. The flowers are greenish and insignificant. The plant is three or\r\nfour feet high, with spreading branches and smooth stems.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WALNUT\r\n\r\nHIGH-BUSH BLUEBERRY\r\n\r\nWINTERGREEN\r\n\r\nGood food on the trail.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Dwarf Blueberry=\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most satisfactory of all berries when one is really hungry\r\nis the blueberry, of which there are several varieties. The _dwarf\r\nblueberry_ is probably the most common. It is the earliest of the\r\nblueberries to ripen and grows in the thin, sandy, and rocky soil which\r\nis spurned by most other plants. You will find it upon barren hillsides,\r\nin rocky fields, and in dry pine woods. The berries are round, blue,\r\nabout the size of peas, and are covered with bloom like the grape. They\r\ngrow in thick clusters at the end of the branch and are tipped with fine\r\ncalyx teeth. The seeds are so small as to be almost unnoticed and the\r\nsoft ripe berry will bruise easily.\r\n\r\nThe flavor of all blueberries has a nutty quality which seems to give\r\nthe berry more substance as a food. The leaf is rather narrow and\r\npointed at each end; the under side is a lighter green than the upper\r\nand both are glossy. In the fall the leaves turn red and drop easily.\r\nThe bush is low and the branches usually covered with small, white dots.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Low Blueberry=\r\n\r\nAnother variety is called the _low blueberry_. It is very much like the\r\ndwarf blueberry, but the bush grows sometimes as high as four feet. It\r\nis stiff and upstanding and prefers the edge of the woods and sheltered\r\nroadsides to the dry open fields. The berries are blue with a grape-like\r\nbloom and, like the first variety, grow in thick clusters at the end of\r\nthe branch. You can grab a good handful in passing, so many are there in\r\na bunch.\r\n\r\n\r\n=High-Bush Blueberry=\r\n\r\nOn the _high-bush blueberry_ the color of the berries varies. Some\r\nbushes bear a black, shiny berry, others a smooth, blue, and still\r\nothers blue with a bloom. The sizes differ also. The berries grow in\r\nclusters, at times on branches almost bare of leaves; some are sweet,\r\nothers sour. The leaves are a pointed oval with the under side lighter\r\nin color than the upper; in some cases the under side is hairy. The\r\nflowers are pinkish and shaped somewhat like a cylinder. The bush grows\r\noccasionally to the height of ten feet, and you will generally find it\r\nin marshy places. I know that it grows by the edge of Teedyuskung Lake\r\nin Pike County, Pa., where our summer camp is located, but it is found\r\nalso in pasturelands.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Dangleberry=\r\n\r\nAnother variety is called the dangleberry. The berries grow on stems in\r\nloose clusters; they are rather large, of a dark-blue color with a\r\nbloom; they ripen late and are not very plentiful. The pale-green leaves\r\nare large, white, and resinous underneath, and are oval in shape. The\r\nflowers are greenish-pink and hang like bells on slender stems.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Wintergreen. Checkerberry=\r\n\r\nAlmost every one knows the little cherry-red _wintergreen berry_ or\r\n_checkerberry_, and almost every one likes its sweet aromatic flavor but\r\nfew would care to make a meal of it. The fruit is too dry for hearty\r\neating and the flavor too decided. The evergreen leaves are leathery in\r\ntexture and their flavor is stronger than that of the berry; they are\r\nwhitish underneath and dark, glossy green above. They are oval in shape\r\nand have a few small teeth or none at all. The flowers are white, waxy,\r\nand cup-shaped; they hang like bells from their short stems. The plant\r\ngrows close to the ground, generally in the woods and moist places. It\r\nis found as far north as Maine and west to Michigan.\r\n\r\nDo not mistake the bunchberry for the wintergreen. It, too, grows low on\r\nthe ground, but the bunchberries are in close clusters at the top of the\r\nsmall plant where the leaves radiate. The berries are bright scarlet,\r\nround and smooth, and are _not_ edible. Flower and leaf resemble those\r\nof the dogwood-tree, to which family the bunchberry belongs.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Partridgeberry=\r\n\r\nAnother ground berry is the partridgeberry. This may be eaten but is dry\r\nand rather tasteless. It is a red berry and grows on a slender, trailing\r\nvine. Its leaves are small and heart-shaped; some are veined with white.\r\nThey are evergreen. The flowers grow in pairs and are like four-pointed\r\nstars at the ends of slender tubes. Inside they are creamy white,\r\noutside a delicate pink. The partridgeberry likes pine forests and dry\r\nwoods.\r\n\r\n\r\n=June-Berry. Shadbush=\r\n\r\nThere are berries on trees as well as on bushes and vines, at least they\r\nare called berries though not always resembling them.\r\n\r\nThe June-berry is a tree from ten to thirty feet in height, while its\r\nclose relative, the shadbush, is a low tree and sometimes a shrub. The\r\nfruit resembles the seed-vessels of the rose; it grows in clusters and\r\nis graded in color from red to violet; it has a slight bloom and the\r\ncalyx shows at the summit. It ripens in June and is said to be sweet and\r\ndelicious in flavor. The oblong leaves are sharply toothed, rounded at\r\nthe base and pointed at the tip. The young leaves are hairy. The flowers\r\nare white and grow in clusters.\r\n\r\nThe shadbush grows in wet places and its fruit is smaller and on shorter\r\nstems. It is also said to be more juicy. The leaves are rather woolly.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PERSIMMON\r\n\r\nSWEET VIBURNUM\r\n\r\nFruits found principally in the south and the middle west.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Red Mulberry=\r\n\r\nAlthough the finest _mulberry-trees_ are said to be found along the\r\nMississippi and the lower Ohio Rivers, I have seen large, thrifty trees\r\nin Connecticut and on Long Island. They grow from Massachusetts to\r\nFlorida and west to Nebraska. Birds are very fond of the mulberry. The\r\nfirst rose-breasted grosbeaks I ever saw were in a great mulberry-tree\r\non a farm in the northern part of Connecticut. The berry is shaped much\r\nlike a blackberry; it is juicy and sweet, but lacks flavor. It grows on\r\na short stem and is about an inch in length. In July when the berry\r\nripens it is a dark purple.\r\n\r\nThere is a decided variety in the shape of the leaves on one tree; some\r\nhave seven lobes, some none at all. The edges of most are scalloped,\r\nthough I have seen leaves with smooth edges.\r\n\r\nThe _white mulberry_ is seldom found growing wild. The fruit is like the\r\nred mulberry but perfectly white.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sweet Viburnum. Nanny-Berry. Sheepberry=\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the sweet viburnum, nanny-berry or sheepberry, is said to\r\nbe edible. It grows on a small tree, of the honeysuckle family, in the\r\nwoods and by the streams from Canada to Georgia and west as far as\r\nMissouri. The tree has a rusty, scaly bark and broad, oval leaves,\r\npointed at the tip and finely toothed. The flower clusters are large\r\nand, though white, they appear yellowish from the many yellow anthers at\r\nthe centre. When entirely ripe the fruit is a dark blue or black and is\r\ncovered with a bloom; before ripening it is crimson. The berry grows in\r\nclusters on slender red stems. It is elongated and rather large. At its\r\nsummit is the calyx and stigma. The seed inside the berry is a stone\r\nwhich is flattened, blunt-pointed, and grooved. The fruit ripens in\r\nSeptember and October.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Large-Fruited Thorn=\r\n\r\nThe thorns, large-fruited and scarlet, are edible. As a child I knew the\r\nfruit as _haws_ and was very fond of it. The large-fruited thorn is a\r\nlow tree with branches spreading out horizontally. You will often find\r\nit in thickets. The bark is rough and the thorns on the branches are\r\nlong, sharp, and of a light-brown color. In flavor the fruit is sweet\r\nand apple-like; the flesh is dry and mealy; it grows on hairy stems and\r\nthe seeds are hard, rounded, and grooved. The summit is tipped with the\r\ncalyx and it ripens in September. The leaves are thick, narrowed at the\r\nbase, and rounded at the ends, with veins underneath that are prominent\r\nand often hairy.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Black Haw. Stag-Bush=\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the black haw, or stag-bush, is not edible until after\r\nfrost has touched it. It is oval, dark blue with bloom, and about half\r\nan inch long. It grows in stiff clusters on short, branching stems. The\r\nshrub, which is sometimes a small tree, is bushy and crooked, with stout\r\nand spreading branches. It is found from Connecticut to Georgia and as\r\nfar west as the Indian Territory. It grows among the underbrush in\r\nforests. The bark is scaly and of a reddish-brown color, the leaves are\r\ndark green and smooth on the upper side, paler and sometimes covered\r\nwith matted hair on the under side, where the veins show prominently;\r\nthey are two or three inches long and generally oval in shape with no\r\nteeth. The flowers are cream-white and grow in flat-topped clusters.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Wild Plums. Canada Plum=\r\n\r\nThere is a wild plum that is found in our New England States and in\r\nCanada known as the Canada plum. The plant grows along fences, in\r\nthickets, and by the side of streams. The plum is from one inch to one\r\nand a half inches long and is red or orange in color. It has a tough\r\nskin and a flat stone. The flavor is considered pleasant but the fruit\r\nis generally used for preserving. The leaves have long, sharp points at\r\nthe ends and are rather heart-shaped at the base. The flowers, white in\r\nbud, change to pink when opened. They grow in thin clusters.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Beach Plum=\r\n\r\nUsually on sandy and stony beaches, though at times farther inland, you\r\nmay find the beach plum. It is a low shrub and grows in clumps. The\r\nfruit is apt to be abundant and is sweet when quite ripe. This plum,\r\nalso, is used for preserving. The color of the fruit is from red to\r\nred-purple, it has a bloom over it and grows on a slender stem. The thin\r\nstone is rounded on one edge, sharp on the other, and generally has\r\npointed ends. The fruit ripens in August and September. The leaf is\r\noval, has a sharp-pointed tip, is rounded at the base, and has fine,\r\nforward-pointed teeth. There are many white flowers which grow in\r\nclusters along the branches.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Wild Red Cherry=\r\n\r\nThe wild red cherry is sour but edible; it is best used as preserves.\r\nThe tree is usually small yet sometimes reaches the height of thirty\r\nfeet. It is oftenest found in the woods of the north, but also grows\r\namong the mountains as far south as Tennessee. The bark is a\r\nreddish-brown and has rusty dots over it. The leaves are oblong, pointed\r\nat the tips and rather blunt at the base. They are bright green and\r\nglossy. The white flower is much like the cultivated cherry blossom but\r\nsmaller; it grows in clusters. The cherries are light red and about the\r\nsize of a pea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CANADA PLUM\r\n\r\nSCARLET HAW\r\n\r\nWILD BLACK CHERRY\r\n\r\nFruits found principally in the north and the middle west.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sand-Cherry=\r\n\r\nGrowing in the sand along our eastern coast as far south as New Jersey\r\nand sometimes on the shores of the Great Lakes, the sand-cherry is\r\nfound. It is a low, trailing bush, but in some cases sends up erect\r\nbranches as high as four feet. The fruit is dark red--black when quite\r\nripe--and about half an inch long. It grows in small clusters or\r\nsolitary, and is said to be sweet and edible. The leaves, dark green on\r\nthe upper side, are lighter underneath; they are rather narrow, broadest\r\ntoward the end and tapering at the base. The edge is toothed almost to\r\nthe base. The flowers are white and thinly clustered.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Persimmon=\r\n\r\nIn the Southern, Western, and Middle States, some say as far north as\r\nNew York, grows the _persimmon_. Deliciously sweet and spicy when frost\r\nhas ripened it, very astringent until ripe. It is plentiful in Kentucky\r\nand one of my earliest memories is of going to market with my mother in\r\nthe fall to buy persimmons. There I learned to avoid the fair, perfect\r\nfruit, though to all appearances it was quite ripe, and to choose that\r\nwhich looked bruised and broken.\r\n\r\nThe persimmon is about the size of a plum, but is flattened at the\r\npoles. It grows close to the branch and its calyx is large. The color is\r\nyellow generally flushed with red. Some writers describe it as juicy,\r\nbut I would not call it that; the flesh is more like custard or soft\r\njelly.\r\n\r\nThe tree usually varies in height from thirty to fifty feet, but in some\r\nplaces is said to reach one hundred or more feet. The trunk is short and\r\nthe branches spreading. In the south it often forms a thicket in\r\nuncultivated fields and along roadsides. The bark is dark brown or dark\r\ngray, the surface is scaly and divided into plates. The leaves are\r\nusually a narrow oval with smooth edges; when matured they are dark\r\ngreen and glossy on the upper side, underneath pale and often downy. The\r\nflower is a creamy-white or greenish-yellow.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Papaw=\r\n\r\nThe papaw is another fruit I knew well as a child. It is sometimes\r\ncalled custard-apple because the flesh resembles soft custard. As I\r\nwrite I can almost taste the, to me, sickish sweetness of the fruit and\r\nfeel the large, smooth, flat seeds in my mouth. In shape the papaw\r\nsomewhat resembles the banana, the texture of the skin is the same, but\r\nthe surface of the papaw is smoothly rounded and it is shorter and\r\nthicker than the banana, being usually from three to five inches long.\r\nIt ripens in September and October. The tree is small, often a shrub,\r\nand it grows wild no farther north than western New York.\r\n\r\nThere are some cultivated papaw-trees on Long Island, but I do not think\r\nthey bear fruit. Certainly none that I have seen have ever fruited. You\r\nwill find the tree as far south as Florida and Texas, through the Middle\r\nStates and west to Michigan and Kansas. It flourishes in the bottom\r\nlands of the Mississippi Valley and seeks the shade of the forests. The\r\nbark is dark brown with gray blotches; the leaves are large, being from\r\ntwo to twelve inches long and four inches wide. They are oval, pointed\r\nat the tip and narrowed at the base. When matured they are smooth, dark\r\ngreen on the upper side and paler beneath. At first the flower is as\r\ngreen as the leaves, but finally turns a deep red-purple. It grows close\r\nto the branch and is solitary.\r\n\r\n\r\n=May-Apple=\r\n\r\nOne of the most delicious wild fruits we have is the _May-apple_ or\r\n_mandrake_. It is finely flavored, sweet and juicy, but being a laxative\r\none must eat of it sparingly. It is most common in the Middle States and\r\nreaches perfection in Ohio.\r\n\r\nThe plant is from twelve to eighteen inches high, and the large\r\numbrella-like leaves are lifted on smooth, straight stems. The fruit\r\nusually grows from the fork of two leaves. It is yellow, lemon-shaped,\r\nand about the size of a plum. The flesh is like that of the plum and\r\nthere are numerous seeds in fleshy seed coverings. It ripens in July and\r\nis quite soft when fully ripe. I have sometimes gathered the firm,\r\nyellow May-apples, put them away in a cool, dark, dry place to ripen,\r\nand in taking them out have found them in prime condition. They will\r\nripen in this way without spoiling if not allowed to touch one another.\r\n\r\nThe leaves frequently measure a foot in diameter; they have from five to\r\nnine lobes, which are notched and pointed at the tips; the upper side is\r\ndarker than the lower. While the fruit of the May-apple is edible, the\r\nleaves and root are poisonous, not to the touch but to the taste. The\r\nflower is a clear white with from eight to twelve rounding petals and it\r\ngenerally measures about one and a half inches across. The petals expand\r\nin the morning, become erect in the afternoon, and close at night. We\r\nare told that the May-apple is a roadside plant, but I have found it\r\nonly in the woods.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Wild Grapes=\r\n\r\nThere are several varieties of wild grapes, all, I think, edible but not\r\nall pleasant to the taste. The fox-grape is sweet, but has a musky\r\nflavor and odor, a thick skin, and a tough pulp. The fruit ripens in\r\nSeptember but few care to eat it. The vine grows luxuriantly and is very\r\ncommon. The summer grape is another tough-skinned grape. It is not musky\r\nbut is generally astringent. The vine resembles the fox-grape in growth,\r\nbeing strong and vigorous. The fruit of the blue grape is sour and hangs\r\nin long, heavy clusters. It is usually found along water-ways.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAY APPLE MANDRAKE\r\n\r\nPARTRIDGE BERRY\r\n\r\nFruits common to most of the States.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Frost-Grape or Chicken-Grape=\r\n\r\nIf you try to eat the _frost-grapes_ before frost you will find them\r\ndecidedly sour, but after a good frost they are really fine. They have a\r\nsnappy, spicy flavor all their own, and one eats them, like currants,\r\nskin and all. They are small, round, and black with a slight bloom. The\r\nclusters are well-filled and hang loosely. The vine grows luxuriantly,\r\nbranching from a large trunk, and is found in wet places and on the\r\nbanks of streams, though it does well in the open and in drier soil. It\r\nflourishes in New England and down to Illinois and westward to Nebraska.\r\nThe leaves usually suggest three lobes but are mostly undivided. They\r\nare coarsely toothed and the under side bears occasional hairs along the\r\nveins.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Wild Nuts. Black Walnuts=\r\n\r\nOf all the wild-growing foods, nuts are, perhaps, the most nutritious.\r\nThe _black walnut_, not plentiful in the Atlantic States but abundant in\r\nthe Middle States and in the Mississippi Valley, has a rich, wild\r\nflavor, and a deep-brown stain for the hands that tear it from its\r\nball-like covering of tough, pimply green which forms the outer husk.\r\nThe nut is sometimes oblong, sometimes almost round, with a deeply\r\ngrooved, hard, brown shell. It grows in pairs or solitary. The tree is\r\nlarge, often reaching the height of one hundred feet, and its trunk is\r\nfrom four to six feet in diameter. The bark is dark brown with deep\r\nvertical grooves and its surface is broken with thick scales. The leaves\r\nare compound, growing on a middle stem which is sometimes two feet long.\r\nEach leaflet is a narrow oval, sharply pointed at the end, and usually\r\nabout three inches long. The nuts require frost to ripen them.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Butternut=\r\n\r\nWhile the _butternut-tree_ is much like the walnut in general\r\nappearance, it does not grow as large. The nuts are different in shape\r\nand in flavor, and the leaflets are hairy instead of smooth. The\r\nbutternut does not grow as far north as the walnut, but is often found\r\nside by side with the walnut in the Middle States. The green outer\r\ncovering of the nut is oblong and sticky on the surface, and, like the\r\nwalnut, will stain the hands. The shell is hard, brown, oblong, and\r\npointed at one end. It is deeply grooved. The flavor is rich but the nut\r\nbeing oily soon becomes rancid.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Hickory-Nuts=\r\n\r\nIn gathering hickory-nuts you must be able to distinguish between the\r\nedible variety and others that are fair on the outside but bitter\r\nwithin. There are nine varieties of hickory-nut trees, and in general\r\nappearance they are alike. All have compound leaves and the leaflets are\r\nlarger and fewer to the stem than the walnut, usually numbering from\r\nfive to eleven. The nuts grow in small clusters as a rule, often in\r\npairs, and the outer husk separates when ripe into four pieces, allowing\r\nthe nut to drop out clean and dry. The full-grown tree is of good size\r\nand is found almost everywhere in the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Shellbark. Shagbark=\r\n\r\nThe _shellbark_ or shagbark hickory-nut is one of the best. The flavor,\r\nas every one knows, is sweet and pleasant. It is the bark of the tree\r\nthat gives it the name of shagbark, for it separates into long, ragged\r\nstrips several inches wide which generally hold to the trunk at the\r\nmiddle and give it an unkempt, shaggy appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Mockernut=\r\n\r\nThe _mockernut_ is the hickory-nut with a dark, brownish-colored shell,\r\nhard and thick and not easily cracked. It is called the mockernut\r\nbecause while the nut is large, usually larger than the shellbark, the\r\nkernel is very small and difficult to take out of the thick shell.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pignut=\r\n\r\nI will italicize the _pignut_ because, though I have never eaten it, I\r\nonce tried to, and the first taste was all-sufficient. Some writers tell\r\nus that the flavor is sweet or slightly bitter. It was the decidedly\r\nbitter kind that I found lying temptingly clean and white under the\r\ntree. The thin outer husk of the pignut is not much larger than the nut.\r\nIt is broader at the top than at the stem, where it narrows almost to a\r\npoint. The husk does not open as freely as that of the other\r\nhickory-nuts. It is inclined to cling to the nut; in some cases it only\r\npartially opens and drops with the nut.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHELLBARK HICKORY NUT\r\n\r\nPIGNUT\r\n\r\nHickory nuts, sweet and bitter.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Beechnut=\r\n\r\nOne of the sweetest and most delicately flavored of our native nuts is\r\nthe little, triangular _beechnut_. The tree is common and widely\r\ndistributed, but few people know anything about the nut. In Kentucky the\r\nnuts used to be plentiful, but I have seen none in New York. It is said\r\nthat a beech-tree must be fully forty years old before it will bear\r\nfruit, and that may be the reason the nuts are not oftener found.\r\n\r\nThe soft-shelled nut is very small, no larger than the tip of your\r\nlittle finger. The color is pale brown, and it is three-sided with sharp\r\nangles. It is contained in a small, prickly husk and grows both solitary\r\nor in clusters of two or three. When touched by frost the burr opens and\r\nallows the nut to fall out while the burr remains on the tree.\r\n\r\nThe bark of the beech-tree is ashy gray, and the leaf is oblong, pointed\r\nat the tip, toothed on the edge, and strongly veined.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Chestnut=\r\n\r\nI find that the _chestnut-tree_ is not as well known as its fruit, which\r\nis sold from stands on the street corners of most American cities. A\r\nround, green prickly burr is the husk of the nut, and this is lined\r\ninside with soft, white, velvety down. Nestled closely in this soft bed\r\nlie several dark-brown nuts with soft, polished shells. The first frost\r\nopens the burrs, and the sweet nuts fall to the ground.\r\n\r\nYou may recognize the tree in midsummer by its long-tasselled,\r\ncream-white blossoms, which hang in profusion from the ends of the\r\nbranches. The chestnut is the only forest-tree that blossoms at that\r\ntime, so you cannot mistake it. Later you will know it by the prickly\r\ngreen burrs, which develop quickly. The tree is large and common to most\r\nStates. The leaves are from six to eight inches long; they are coarsely\r\ntoothed at the edges, sharply pointed at the end, and are prominently\r\nveined on the under side. They grow mostly in tufts drooping from a\r\ncommon centre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Nuts with soft shells. Beechnut and chestnut.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Bark and Roots of Trees=\r\n\r\n\r\n=Slippery-Elm=\r\n\r\nThe inner bark and the root of the _slippery-elm_ are not only pleasant\r\nto the taste but are said to be nutritious. They have a glutinous\r\nquality that gives the tree its name, and the flavor is nutty and\r\nsubstantial.\r\n\r\nThis variety of elm is common and is found from the Saint Lawrence River\r\nto Florida. It grows to a height of sixty or seventy feet, with\r\nspreading branches which flatten at the top. The outline of the tree is\r\nmuch like that of a champagne-glass, wide at the top and narrow at the\r\nstem. The slippery-elm resembles the white elm, but there are\r\ndifferences by which you can know it. If you stroke the leaf of a white\r\nelm you will find that it is rough one way but smooth the other; stroke\r\nthe leaf of the slippery-elm, and it will be rough _both_ ways. The buds\r\nof the white elm are smooth, those of the slippery-elm are _hairy_. Then\r\nyou cannot mistake the inner bark of the slippery-elm, which is\r\nfragrant, thick, and gummy. The outer bark is dark brown, with shallow\r\nridges and large, loose plates. The leaves are oblong, rounded at the\r\nbase, and are coarsely toothed. They are prominently veined and are dark\r\ngreen, paler on the under side.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sassafras=\r\n\r\nThe _sassafras_ grows wild from Massachusetts to Florida, and west\r\nthrough the Mississippi Valley. It is generally a small tree, from\r\nthirty to fifty feet high, and is often found growing in dense thickets\r\nin uncultivated fields. The edible bark is dark red-brown. It is thick\r\nbut not hard and is deeply ridged and scaled. The cracked bark is one\r\nof the characteristics of the tree; it begins to split when the tree is\r\nabout three years old. The strong aromatic flavor is held by the bark,\r\nthe wood, the roots, the stems, and the leaves. I have never tasted the\r\nfruit, which is berry-like, dark blue, and glossy, and is held by a\r\nthick, scarlet calyx; but the birds are fond of it.\r\n\r\nSassafras tea was at one time considered the best of spring medicines\r\nfor purifying the blood, and the bark was brought to market cut in short\r\nlengths and tied together in bunches.\r\n\r\nThe leaves are varied; on one twig there will sometimes be three\r\ndifferently shaped leaves. Some will be oval, some with three lobes, and\r\nsome mitten-shaped; that is, an oval leaf with a side lobe like the\r\nthumb of a mitten.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Salads. Watercress=\r\n\r\nThere is no more refreshing salad than the _watercress_ gathered fresh\r\nfrom a cool, running brook. It is a common plant, found almost anywhere\r\nin streams and brooks. Its smooth green or brownish leaves lie on the\r\ntop of the water; they are compound, with from three to nine small\r\nrounded leaflets. The flavor is peppery and pungent. Watercress\r\nsandwiches are good. The white flowers are small and insignificant and\r\ngrow in a small cluster at the end of the stem.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Dandelion=\r\n\r\nA salad of tender, young _dandelion_ leaves is not to be despised, and\r\nthe plant grows everywhere. Only the very young leaves, that come up\r\nalmost white in the spring, are good. The flavor is slightly bitter with\r\nthe wholesome bitterness one likes in the spring of the year. These\r\nyoung leaves are also good when cooked like spinach. The plant is so\r\ncommon it does not really call for a description, and if you know it you\r\ncan skip the following:\r\n\r\nGrowing low on the ground, sometimes with leaves lying flat on the\r\nsurface, the dandelion sends up a hollow, leafless stem crowned with a\r\nbright-yellow, many-petalled flower about the size of a silver\r\nfifty-cent piece. The seed head is a round ball of white down. The\r\nleaves are deeply notched, much like thistle leaves, but they have no\r\nprickles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nLITTLE FOES OF THE TRAILER\r\n\r\n=Poisonous Insects, Reptiles, and Plants=\r\n\r\n\r\n=Insects=\r\n\r\n\r\nMy first experience with wood-ticks, jiggers, and Jersey mosquitoes was\r\nduring the summer we spent at Bayville, near Toms River, N. J. In many\r\nways Bayville, with its sand, its pines, its beautiful wood roads, and\r\nrare wild flowers, is an interesting and attractive place. The salty air\r\nis fine when the thermometer is self-respecting and keeps the mercury\r\nbelow 90\xc2\xb0 in the shade, but the oak underbrush harbors wood-ticks, the\r\nblackberry bushes cover you with jiggers, the woods are full of\r\ndeer-flies, and the vicious mosquito, whose name is Legion, is\r\neverywhere where he is not barred out.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Wood-Ticks=\r\n\r\nI had been told of the ticks that infest the forests of the South, had\r\nheard blood-curdling stories of how they sometimes bury themselves,\r\nentire, in the flesh of animals and men and have to be cut out, and my\r\nhorror of them was great. In reality I found them unpleasant enough but,\r\nas far as we were concerned, comparatively harmless.\r\n\r\nThe wood-tick is a small, rather disgusting-looking creature which, in\r\nappearance and size, resembles the common bedbug. It fastens itself upon\r\nyou without your knowledge and you do not feel it even when it begins\r\nto suck your blood, but something generally impels you to pass your\r\nhand over the back of your neck, or cheek, where the thing is clinging,\r\nand, feeling the lump, you pull it off and no great harm done. The tick\r\nis supposed always to bury its head in the flesh, and it is said that if\r\nthe head is left in when the bug is pulled off an ugly sore will be the\r\nresult. We had no experience of that kind, however, nor, in our hurry to\r\nget rid of it, did we stop to remove the bug scientifically by dropping\r\noil on it, as Kephart advises, but just naturally and simply, also\r\nvigorously, we grasped it between thumb and forefinger and hastily\r\nplucked it off. The effect of the bite was no worse on any of our party\r\nthan that of the Jersey mosquito.\r\n\r\nOften your friends will see a tick on you and tell you of it even while\r\nthey have several, all unknown to themselves, decorating their own\r\ncountenance. The name by which science knows this unlovely bug is\r\n_Ixodes leech_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Jigger. Redbug. Mite=\r\n\r\nThe tiny mite called by the natives jigger and redbug is more annoying\r\nthan the wood-tick, one reason being that there are so many more of him.\r\nHe really does penetrate the skin, and his wanderings under the surface\r\ngive one the feeling of an itching rash which covers the body. You won\'t\r\nsee the jigger--he is too small, but if you invade his domain you will\r\ncertainly feel him.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Deer-Fly=\r\n\r\nThe deer-fly will bite and bite hard enough to hurt. It will drive its\r\nsharp mandibles into your skin with such force as to take out a bit of\r\nthe flesh, sometimes causing the blood to flow, but the bite does not\r\nseem particularly poisonous, though you feel it at the time and it\r\ngenerally raises a lump on the flesh. The deer-fly belongs to the\r\nfamily of gadflies. It is larger than a house-fly and its wings stand\r\nout at right angles to its body. It will not trouble you much except in\r\nthe woods.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Black-Fly=\r\n\r\nThe Adirondack and North Woods region is not only the resort of hunters,\r\ncampers, and seekers after health and pleasure, but it is also the haunt\r\nof the maddening black-fly. From early spring until the middle of July\r\nor first of August the black-fly holds the territory; then it evacuates\r\nand is seen no more until next season, when it begins a new campaign.\r\n\r\nUnder the name of buffalo-fly the black-fly is found in the west, where,\r\non the prairies, it has been known to wage war on horses until death\r\nensued--death of the horses, not of the fly. It is a small fly about\r\none-sixth of an inch long, thick-bodied, and black. It is said to have\r\nbroad silvery circles on its legs, but no one ever stops to look at\r\nthese. Its proboscis is developed to draw blood freely, and it is always\r\nin working order.\r\n\r\nThe only virtue the black-fly seems to have is its habit of quitting\r\noperations at sundown and leaving to other tormenters the task of\r\nkeeping you awake at night. When the black-fly bites you will know it,\r\nand it will leave its mark, when it does leave, which must generally be\r\nby your help, for it holds on with commendable persistence. If you would\r\nlearn more of this charming insect, look for _Simulium molestum_ in a\r\nbook which treats the subject scientifically.\r\n\r\n\r\n=No-see-um. Punky. Midge=\r\n\r\nThere is another pest of the North Woods which the guides call the\r\nno-see-um. It is a very diminutive midge resembling the mosquito in\r\nform and viciousness, but so small as to be almost invisible. Night and\r\nday are the same to the no-see-um; its warfare is continuous and its\r\nbite very annoying, but it disappears with the black-fly in July or\r\nAugust. By September the mountains and woods are swept clear of all\r\nthese troublesome things, except at times and in some places the\r\never-hungry mosquito, which will linger on for a last bite in his summer\r\nfeast.\r\n\r\nThe only way to relieve the irritation caused by the bites of these\r\npests, including the mosquito, is to bathe the affected parts with\r\ncamphor, alcohol, or diluted ammonia. When there are but one or two\r\nbites they may be touched with strong ammonia, but it will not do to use\r\nthis too freely, as it will burn the skin.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Gnats=\r\n\r\nIn the mountains of Pennsylvania the most troublesome insects I found\r\nwere the tiny gnats that persist in flying into one\'s eyes in a very\r\nexasperating fashion. They swarm in a cloud in front of your face as you\r\nwalk and make constant dashes at your eyes, although to reach their goal\r\nbrings instant death.\r\n\r\nIt is not much trouble to get one of these gnats out of your eye when it\r\nonce gets in. All that is necessary is to take the eyelashes of the\r\nupper eyelid between your thumb and first finger, and draw the upper\r\neyelid down _over_ the under eyelid. The under eyelashes sweep the upper\r\nlid clear, and the rush of tears that comes to the eye washes the insect\r\nout.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Bees, Wasps, and Yellow-Jackets=\r\n\r\nWhile honey-bees and wasps can make themselves most disagreeable when\r\ndisturbed, you can usually keep away from beehives and bee-trees as\r\nwell as from the great gray, papery nests of the wasp; but the hornets\r\nor yellow-jackets have an uncomfortable habit of building in low bushes\r\nand on the ground where you may literally put your foot in a hornets\'\r\nnest.\r\n\r\nThey are hot-tempered little people, these same hornets, as I have\r\nreason to know. Twice I have been punished by them, and both times it\r\nwas my head they attacked. Once I found them, or they found me, in a\r\ncherry-tree; and the second time we met was when I stepped in their nest\r\nhidden on the ground. Their sting is like a hot wire pressed into the\r\nflesh. When angered they will chase you and swarm around your head,\r\nstinging whenever they can; but they may be beaten off if some friendly\r\nhand will wield a towel or anything else that comes handy.\r\n\r\nIf the stings of any of these stinging insects are left in the wounds\r\nthey should be taken out with a _clean_ needle or _clean_ knife-blade.\r\nIn any case mix some mud into a paste and plaster it on the parts that\r\nhave been stung. If you are in camp and have with you a can of\r\nantiphlogistine use that instead of the mud; it is at least more sightly\r\nand is equally efficient in reducing inflammation.\r\n\r\nVarious things have been devised as protection against insect torments.\r\n\r\nOne is a veil of net to be worn over the hat. You will find this\r\ndescribed in Chapter IV under the heading of Personal Outfits.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Dopes=\r\n\r\nThen there are dopes to be rubbed over the face, neck, and hands. The\r\nthree said to be the best are Nessmuk\'s Dope, Breck\'s Dope, and H. P.\r\nWells\'s Bug-Juice. There is also a Rexall preparation which, I am told,\r\nis good while it stays on, but will wash off with perspiration.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Nessmuk\'s Dope=\r\n\r\nIn giving the recipe for his dope, Nessmuk says that it produces a glaze\r\nover the skin and that in preventing insect bites he has never known it\r\nto fail. This is the dope:\r\n\r\n          Pine tar                            3 oz.\r\n          Castor oil                          2 oz.\r\n          Oil of pennyroyal                   1 oz.\r\n\r\n          Simmer all together over a slow fire, and bottle.\r\n\r\n          This is sufficient for four persons for two weeks.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Breck\'s Dope=\r\n\r\n          Pine tar                            3 oz.\r\n          Olive (or castor oil)               2 oz.\r\n          Oil of pennyroyal                   1 oz.\r\n          Citronella                          1 oz.\r\n          Creosote                            1 oz.\r\n          Camphor (pulverized)                1 oz.\r\n          Large tube of carbolated vaseline.\r\n\r\n          Heat the tar and oil, and add the other\r\n          ingredients; simmer over slow fire until well\r\n          mixed. The tar may be omitted if disliked or for\r\n          ladies\' use.\r\n\r\nBreck tells us that his dope was planned to be a counter-irritant after\r\nbeing bitten as well as a preventer of bites.\r\n\r\n\r\n=H. P. Wells\'s Bug-Juice=\r\n\r\n          Olive oil                         1/2 pt.\r\n          Creosote                            1 oz.\r\n          Pennyroyal                          1 oz.\r\n          Camphor                             1 oz.\r\n\r\n          Dissolve camphor in alcohol and mix.\r\n\r\nAny dope must be well rubbed in on face, neck, ears, and _behind ears_,\r\nhands (on the backs), wrists, and arms; but be very careful not to get\r\nit _in your eyes_.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Smudges=\r\n\r\nSmudges are said to afford relief in camp, but my own experience has\r\nbeen that the insects can stand them better than I. A smudge is made by\r\nburning things that make little flame and much smoke. Dead leaves, not\r\ntoo dry, will make a fairly good smudge, but a better way is to burn\r\ndamp cedar bark, or branches, on piles of hot coals taken from the\r\ncamp-fire and kept alive at different sides of the camp.\r\n\r\nThe accounts of extreme suffering caused by insect bites come from\r\nunusually sensitive people. All people are not affected alike. Two\r\npersons from one camp will tell entirely different stories of their\r\nexperience with insects. The best way to encounter these, as all other\r\nannoyances, is to protect yourself as well as you can and then, without\r\nwhimpering, make the best of the situation. All the pests described will\r\nnot fall upon you at once, and, taken singly or even doubly, you will\r\nmanage to survive the ordeal. If the pleasure of the trail did not\r\nover-balance the pain there would be fewer campers to relate their\r\ntroubles.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Snakes=\r\n\r\nThe bite of a poisonous snake is by all means to be avoided, and the\r\npoint is: you almost always can avoid it. With all the snakes in the\r\nUnited States, Doctor William T. Hornaday, director of the Zoological\r\nPark of New York City, tells us that out of seventy-five million people\r\nnot more than two die each year of snake-bites.\r\n\r\nSnakes are not man-hunters; they will not track you down; they much\r\nprefer to keep out of your way. What you have to do is to keep out of\r\ntheirs. In a region where poisonous snakes abound it is well to wear\r\nkhaki leggins as a protection in case you inadvertently step too near\r\nand anger the creatures, for in such cases they sometimes strike before\r\nyou have time to beat a retreat. According to Doctor Hornaday, the\r\npoisonous snakes of North America are:\r\n\r\n          The rattlesnake,\r\n          Water-moccasin,\r\n          Copperhead,\r\n          Sonora coral-snake,\r\n          Harlequin snake.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Rattlesnakes=\r\n\r\nThe rattlesnake appears to vary in color and markings in the different\r\nlocalities where it is found, and there are fourteen or fifteen\r\nvarieties, but all carry the rattles, shake them warningly, and coil\r\nbefore they strike. The rattlesnake does not want to fight and if you\r\nkeep at a safe distance it will glide off in another direction, but it\r\nis safest not to venture within striking distance, which is said to be\r\ntwo-thirds the length of the snake, even if the snake has not coiled,\r\nfor it moves quickly and strikes like a flash.\r\n\r\nThe rattles are at the extreme end of the tail and are composed of horny\r\njoints. The sound of the rattle is much like the humming of a locust\r\n(cicada). Rattlesnakes are often found sunning themselves on large\r\nrocks, and stone-quarries are the chosen winter quarters where whole\r\ncolonies assemble. They are also found, during the summer, among\r\nunderbrush and in stubble-fields, where they probably go to hunt\r\nfield-mice and other small mammals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BANDED RATTLESNAKE\r\n\r\nPOISONOUS\r\n\r\nWATER-MOCCASIN\r\n\r\nPOISONOUS\r\n\r\nRED-BELLIED WATER-SNAKE\r\n\r\nSTRIPED LENGTHWISE\r\n\r\nHARMLESS\r\n\r\nPoisonous and non-poisonous snakes.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Banded Rattlesnake=\r\n\r\nThe mountains of Pennsylvania are a favorite resort of the rattlesnake,\r\nbut, though I have passed many summers in Pike County, famous for its\r\nsnakes, the only live one I ever saw in that locality was in a box at\r\nRowland station. The men of our party occasionally killed one and\r\nbrought it to camp as a trophy, but one of our weekend guests spent most\r\nof his time hunting the rattler that he might take its skin back to the\r\ncity, yet without success.\r\n\r\nIt is the banded rattlesnake that is usually found in Pennsylvania. The\r\ncolor is yellowish and it is marked with irregular, wide bands of dark\r\nbrown. Sometimes the snake is almost black, and it is thought that it\r\nturns dark with age.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Diamond Rattlesnake=\r\n\r\nThe rattlesnake marked in diamond patterns of gold outline on brown is\r\nof the south and is oftenest found in Florida. This is a very large\r\nsnake, and closely allied to it is the Texas rattlesnake, which is the\r\nsame in markings and color, but paler, as if faded out.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Massasauga=\r\n\r\nThe massasauga is the rattlesnake occasionally found in the swamps from\r\nwestern New York to Nebraska, but it is rare. Its color is light brown\r\nwith patches of dark brown its entire length.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Copperhead=\r\n\r\nThe copperhead is not a rattler, though its vibrating tail amid dry\r\nleaves will sometimes hum like one. (This is also true of the\r\nblacksnake.) Its bite is very poisonous. It is found amid rocks and in\r\nthe woods, and is at home from New England and the Atlantic coast west\r\nto Indiana and south to Texas. This snake is seldom more than three\r\nfeet long. Its color is light reddish-brown with bands of rich chestnut\r\nwhich are narrow on the back and wide at the sides. The underpart is\r\nwhitish with dark spots on the abdomen. The head is generally coppery in\r\ncolor but not always. In Texas the colors of the copperhead are\r\nstronger, the bands and head are decidedly reddish, and the bands have\r\nnarrow white borders.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Harlequin Snake and Coral-Snake=\r\n\r\nThe harlequin snake and the coral-snake are so similar in color and in\r\nhabits, one description for both will answer our purpose. They are\r\nsouthern snakes, beginning in southern Indiana and extending south. They\r\nare quite poisonous, but of such retiring habits as hardly to be classed\r\nas dangerous. Most of their time is spent hidden under the sand and in\r\nthe ground, but when they do come out their colors are so brilliant as\r\nnot to be mistaken. On the harlequin snake the colors are bright\r\ncoral-red, yellow, and black, which alternate in stripes that encircle\r\nthe body. Its head is always banded with a broad yellow stripe. The\r\ncoral-snake is much the same in color, and only a close observer would\r\nnotice the difference. The coral-snake is also found in Arizona.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Water-Moccasin, Cottonmouth=\r\n\r\nThe water-moccasin is ugly, and ugly all the way through. Its deadly\r\nviciousness is not redeemed by any outward beauty. Its average length is\r\nthree and a half feet, though it is occasionally longer. Its unlovely\r\nbody is thick and the color of greenish mud; the sides are paler and\r\nhave wide, blackish bands. There are dark bands from the eyes to the\r\nmouth and above them there are pale streaks. The top of the head is very\r\ndark. The abdomen is yellow with splashes of brown or black. Heavy\r\nshields overhang the eyes and give a sinister expression to their angry\r\nglare. When suddenly approached the moccasin opens wide its white-lined\r\nmouth, and one then understands why it is called cottonmouth.\r\n\r\nThis snake does not coil before its strikes, but vibrates its tail\r\nslowly and watches its prey with mouth open. The moccasin is decidedly a\r\nsouthern snake, and girls of the south know that its home is along the\r\nedges of bayous and in the swamps. It is frequently seen with its head\r\nand a small part of its body out of water while the rest is submerged,\r\nbut at times it will be found on a water-soaked log or on underbrush and\r\nlow boughs of trees that overhang the water. The bite is very poisonous.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Other Snakes=\r\n\r\nThere are many other snakes in the United States, but they are not\r\nvenomous. Here is one thing to remember: you need never fear a snake\r\nfound in this country which has _lengthwise stripes_, that is, stripes\r\nrunning from head to tail. Daniel C. Beard tells me that he has learned\r\nthis from observation, and Raymond L. Ditmars, curator of reptiles in\r\nthe New York Zoological Park, agrees with him.\r\n\r\nWhile the lengthwise-striped snakes are harmless, others not striped in\r\nthis way are harmless, too. The blacksnake, though he looks an ugly\r\ncustomer and, when cornered, will sometimes show fight, is not venomous\r\nand his bite is not deep. It is, therefore, wanton cruelty to kill every\r\nsnake that crosses your path simply because it happens to be a snake.\r\nKephart, in his book of "Camping and Woodcraft," says in regard to\r\nidentifying the poisonous snake:\r\n\r\n"The rattlesnake, copperhead, and cottonmouth are easily distinguished\r\nfrom all other snakes, as all three of them bear a peculiar mark, or\r\nrather a pair of marks, that no other animal possesses. This mark is\r\nthe _pit_, which is a deep cavity on each side of the face between the\r\nnostrils and the eye, sinking into the upper jaw-bone."\r\n\r\nIf, when one has been bitten and the snake killed, an examination is\r\nmade of its head, it can be ascertained immediately whether the snake\r\nwas venomous, and in this way unnecessary fright may be avoided.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Beaded Lizard, Gila Monster=\r\n\r\nThe only other venomous reptile found in the United States is the beaded\r\nlizard, called Gila monster (pronounced heela). Unless you visit the\r\ndesert regions of Arizona and New Mexico, you will not be apt to run\r\nacross this most interesting though poisonous reptile.\r\n\r\nThe Gila monster looks very much like a unique piece of Indian beadwork,\r\nwith its fat body and stubby legs covered with bright-colored, bead-like\r\ntubercles, which form almost a Navajo pattern. Its length is about\r\nnineteen inches, and its beads are colored salmon, flesh-pink, white or\r\nyellow, and black. Though it has the appearance of being stuffed with\r\ncotton, it is really formidable and very much alive. Its jaws are\r\nstrong; when it bites it holds on like a bulldog, and there is no way to\r\nforce it to open its mouth except to pry the powerful jaws apart. While\r\notherwise slow of movement, it will turn quickly from side to side,\r\nsnapping viciously. The inside of the Gila\'s mouth is black, and when\r\nangry it opens it wide and hisses.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Treatment for Snake-Bites=\r\n\r\nIf the unlikely should chance to happen and one of your party is bitten\r\nby a poisonous snake, first aid should be given _immediately_, and if a\r\nphysician is within reach he should be summoned as quickly as possible.\r\nMuch depends, however, upon what is done first. Any one can administer\r\nthe following treatment, and it should be done without flinching, for it\r\nmay mean the saving of a life:\r\n\r\n(1) As soon as the person is bitten twist a tourniquet very tightly\r\nabove the wound, that is, between the wound and the heart, to keep the\r\npoison as far as possible from entering the entire system.\r\n\r\n(2) Slash the wound or stab it with a _clean_ knife-blade and force it\r\nto bleed copiously. If there is no break in the skin or membrane of your\r\nmouth or lips and no cavity in any of your teeth, suck the wound to draw\r\nout the poison.\r\n\r\n(3) Give a stimulant in small doses at frequent intervals to stimulate\r\nthe heart and lungs and strengthen the nerves, but avoid overdoing this,\r\nfor the result will be harmful.\r\n\r\n(4) If you have with you an antivenomous serum, inject it as directed by\r\nthe formula that accompanies it.\r\n\r\nTie a loose bandage around the affected member, a handkerchief, neck\r\nscarf, or even a rope for a tourniquet, to check circulation, as\r\ndescribed in Chapter XII, on Accidents. Every little while loosen the\r\ntourniquet, then tighten it again, for it will not do to stop the\r\ncirculation entirely.\r\n\r\nAll authorities do not advise sucking the wound, but it is generally\r\ndone, for with a perfectly sound and healthy mouth there is no danger,\r\nas the poison enters the system only by contact with the blood.\r\n\r\nSome writers advocate cauterizing the wound with a hot iron; but,\r\nwhatever is done, do quickly, and _do not be afraid_. Fear is contagious\r\nand exceedingly harmful to the patient. Remember that a snake-bite is\r\nseldom fatal, and that a swollen arm or leg does not mean that the case\r\nis hopeless.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Poisonous Plants=\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of poisonous plants: those that are poison to the\r\ntouch and those that are harmless unless taken inwardly. Both may be\r\navoided when you learn to identify them.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Poison-Ivy=\r\n\r\nWe are apt to think that every one knows the common poison-ivy, but that\r\nsome people are not familiar with it was shown when one beautiful autumn\r\nday a young woman passed along our village street carrying a handful of\r\nthe sprays of the vine, gathered probably because of their beautiful\r\ncoloring. Noticing that she was a stranger, no doubt from the city, and\r\nrealizing the danger she was running of poisoning herself or some one\r\nelse, we hurriedly caught up with her and gave first aid to the ignorant\r\nin a few forceful remarks. The result was that, without a word, the\r\nyoung woman simply opened her hand, dropped her vines on the walk, and\r\nhurried off as if to escape a pestilence. We were left to close the\r\nincident by kicking the stuff into the street that some other equally\r\nuninformed person might not be tempted to pick it up.\r\n\r\nIf you do not know the poison-ivy, remember this: It is the\r\n_three-leaved ivy_. Its leaves always grow in triplets as shown in\r\nillustration. The leaves are smooth, but not glossy; they have no teeth\r\nbut are occasionally notched. Sometimes the plant is bushy, standing a\r\nfoot or two high, again it is trailing or climbing. It loves fence\r\ncorners and big rocks to clamber over; it will also choose large trees\r\nfor support, climbing up to their tops. The flowers are whitish and the\r\nfruit is a pretty, green-gray berry, round and smooth, which grows in\r\nscant clusters.\r\n\r\nPoison-ivy is found through the country from Maine to Texas and west to\r\nSouth Dakota, Utah, and Arkansas.\r\n\r\nSome people are immune to ivy poison and, happily, I belong to the\r\nfortunate ones. Many persons are poisoned by it, however, and it may be\r\nthat fear makes them more susceptible. On some the painful, burning\r\neruption is difficult to cure.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Poison-Oak=\r\n\r\nThe poison-oak closely resembles the poison-ivy, and is sometimes called\r\nby that name, but its leaves are differently shaped, being oval in\r\noutline with a few coarse, blunt teeth. They are also thicker and\r\nsmaller than the ivy leaf. The poison-oak is plentiful in cool uplands\r\nand in ravines, and is general throughout the Pacific coast from Lower\r\nCalifornia and Arizona to British America.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Poison-Sumach, or Swamp-Sumach=\r\n\r\nAnother member of the same family is the poison-sumach. They are all\r\nthree equally poisonous and act by contact. The poison, or swamp, sumach\r\nis a high, branching shrub closely resembling the harmless species which\r\ngrow on high, dry ground. The poison variety chooses low, wet places.\r\nThe leaves of the poison-sumach are compound, with from seven to\r\nthirteen leaflets growing from one stem, as the leaves of the\r\nwalnut-tree grow; the stalks are often of a purplish color. The leaflets\r\nare oval in shape and are pointed at the tip. The surface is smooth and\r\ngreen on both sides and they have no teeth. The autumn coloring is very\r\nbrilliant. The flowers are whitish-green and grow in loose clusters from\r\na stiff middle stalk at the angles of the leaves. The fruit is a\r\ngray-green berry growing in scant, drooping clusters. This _gray\r\ndrooping berry is the sumac poison sign_, for the fruit of the\r\nharmless sumach is crimson and is held erect in close pyramidal\r\nclusters.\r\n\r\nWitch-hazel (Pond\'s Extract) is used as a remedy for all of these\r\npoisons, but it is claimed that a paste made of _cooking-soda_ and water\r\nis better. Alcohol will sometimes be effective, also a strong lye made\r\nof wood-ashes. Salt and water will give relief to some. It seems to\r\ndepend upon the person whether the remedy, as well as the poison, will\r\nhave effect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: POISON IVY\r\n\r\nPOISON SUMAC\r\n\r\nPlants poison to the touch.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Yellow Lady\'s-Slipper=\r\n\r\nGrowing in bogs and low woods from Maine to Minnesota and Washington,\r\nsouthward to Georgia and Missouri, there is a sweet-scented, little\r\nyellow-and-brown flower called the yellow lady\'s-slipper, the plant of\r\nwhich is said to have the same effect when handled as poison-ivy. This\r\nflower is an orchid. The stalk, from one to two feet high, bears a\r\nsingle blossom at the top, and the leaves, shaped and veined like those\r\nof the lily-of-the-valley, grow alternately down the stem. The plant\r\ndoes not branch. Like the ivy, the yellow lady\'s-slipper does not poison\r\nevery one.\r\n\r\nI know of no other wild plants that are poisonous to the touch; the\r\nfollowing will poison only if taken inwardly.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Deadly Nightshade=\r\n\r\nTo the nightshade family belong plants that are poisonous and plants\r\nthat are not, but the thrilling name, deadly nightshade, carries with it\r\nthe certainty of poison.\r\n\r\nThe plant is an annual and you may often find it growing in a neglected\r\ncorner of the garden as well as in waste places. It is a tall plant; the\r\none I remember in our own garden reached to the top of a five-foot board\r\nfence. Its leaves are rather triangular in shape, they are dark green\r\nand the wavy edges are notched rather than toothed. The flowers are\r\nwhite and grow in small clusters. The fruit is a berry, round, black,\r\nand smooth, with calyx adhering to it. The berry clusters grow at the\r\nend of drooping stems. This must not be mistaken for the high-bush\r\nblueberry, for to eat the fruit would be most dangerous.\r\n\r\nThe antidotes for nightshade poison are emetics, cathartics, and\r\nstimulants. The poison should be thrown off the stomach first, then\r\nstrong coffee be given as a stimulant.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Pokeweed, Pigeonberry=\r\n\r\nPokeweed comes under the heading of poisonous plants though its berries\r\nare eaten by birds, and its young shoots are said to be almost equal in\r\nflavor, and quite as wholesome, as asparagus. It seems to be the large\r\nperennial root that holds the poison, though some authorities claim that\r\nthe poison permeates the entire plant to a certain extent. The root is\r\nsometimes mistaken for that of edible plants and the young leaves for\r\nthose of the marsh-marigold, which are edible when cooked. It is a tall\r\nplant with a stout stem and emits a strong odor. You will find it\r\ngrowing by the wayside and in rocky places. The leaves are oblong and\r\npointed at the tips and base. They have no teeth. The small white\r\nflowers are in clusters. The fruit is a small, flat, dark-purple berry,\r\ngrowing in long, upstanding clusters on a central stalk. The individual\r\nstem of the berry is very short. The name inkberry was given to the\r\nplant because of the strong stain of the berry juice which was sometimes\r\nused for ink. Pokeweed is at home in various states, Maine to Minnesota,\r\nArkansas, and Florida.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Poison-Hemlock=\r\n\r\nThe poison-hemlock is well known historically, being in use at the time\r\nof Socrates, and believed to have been administered to him by the\r\nGreeks. It is quite as poisonous now as in Socrates\'s day, and\r\naccidental poisoning has come from people eating the seeds, mistaking\r\nthem for anise-seed, eating the leaves for parsley and the roots for\r\nparsnips. The plant grows from two to seven feet high; its stem is\r\nsmooth and spotted or streaked with purplish-red. It has large,\r\nparsley-like leaves and pretty clusters of small, white flowers which\r\ngrow, stiff-stemmed, from a common centre and blossom in July and\r\nAugust. When the fresh leaves are bruised they give out a distinctly\r\nmouse-like odor and they are very nauseating to the taste.\r\nPoison-hemlock is common on waysides and waste places in New York, West\r\nVirginia, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Ohio. It is also found in New\r\nEngland and Michigan, Wisconsin, Illinois, Louisiana, and California.\r\n\r\nThe treatment recommended by professionals is emetics, warmth of hands\r\nand feet, artificial respiration, and the subcutaneous injection of\r\natropine, administered by a physician.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Water-Hemlock=\r\n\r\nWater-hemlock is similar in appearance and in effect. It is found in wet\r\nplaces and on the borders of swamps. The remedies are the same as for\r\npoison-hemlock.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEADLY NIGHTSHADE\r\n\r\nPOKEWEED\r\n\r\nPlants poison to the taste.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Jimson-Weed=\r\n\r\nThe jimson-weed is very common in Kentucky. I have not seen so much of\r\nit in the east and north, but it appears to grow pretty nearly over the\r\nwhole United States. It is from one to five feet in height, and an\r\nill-smelling weed, though first cousin to the beautiful, cultivated\r\ndatura, which is a highly prized garden plant. The stem is smooth,\r\ngreen, stout, and branching. The flower is large, sometimes four inches\r\nlong, and trumpet-shaped. There are several varieties of this weed; on\r\nsome the flower is white, on others the five, flaring, sharp-pointed\r\nlobes are stained with lavender and magenta. The calyx is long,\r\nclose-fitting, and light green. The leaves are rather large; they are\r\nangularly oval in shape and are coarsely notched. The fruit is a\r\nprickly, egg-shaped capsule which contains the seeds. It is these seeds\r\nwhich are sometimes eaten with serious results, and children have been\r\npoisoned by putting the flowers in their mouths.\r\n\r\nEmetics should immediately be administered to throw the poison off the\r\nstomach, then hot, strong coffee should be given. Sometimes artificial\r\nrespiration must be resorted to. In all cases of poisoning a physician\r\nshould be called if possible.\r\n\r\nThe habit of chewing leaves and stems without knowing what they are\r\nshould be suppressed when on the trail. It is something like going\r\nthrough a drug store and sampling the jars of drugs as you pass, and the\r\ndanger of poisoning is almost as great.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Toadstools=\r\n\r\nUnless you are an expert in distinguishing non-poisonous mushrooms from\r\nthe poison toadstool, _leave them all alone_. Many deaths occur yearly\r\nfrom eating toadstools which have been mistaken for the edible\r\nmushrooms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nON THE TRAIL WITH YOUR CAMERA\r\n\r\n=What to Photograph and How=\r\n\r\n\r\nYou cannot depend entirely upon your memory to recall the sights and\r\nadventures of the trail, and will be only half-equipped if you go\r\nwithout a camera and note-book. Several clicks of the camera will record\r\nthe principal events, while your note-book will fill in the detail.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Selecting a Camera=\r\n\r\nIn selecting a camera remember that every ounce in weight counts as two\r\nwhen on the long trail, and that to have to carry it in your hand is\r\nmost troublesome and inconvenient. The folding camera, which can be hung\r\nover your shoulder with a strap, is therefore the best; and do not try\r\nto carry plates, they are too heavy. It is of little use to consult the\r\nclerk of a photographic supply shop about the style of camera you should\r\nbuy. As a rule he is not chosen for his knowledge of the goods, and his\r\nadvice may be worse than none. The better plan is to secure descriptive\r\ncatalogues from dealer or manufacturer before investing, and study them\r\nwell. The catalogues will tell you the price, the size, the weight, and\r\n_what kind of work_ each variety of camera will do, and you will learn\r\nthe advantages and limitations of many before deciding upon one.\r\n\r\n\r\n=How to Know Your Camera=\r\n\r\nThe camera once bought and in your hands, the next thing to do is to\r\nbecome thoroughly acquainted with it. With your camera you are entitled\r\nto a little book of instructions. Take your camera and the book, sit\r\ndown alone, and give them your entire attention. Read the book carefully\r\nand, at the same time, carry out the instructions while the camera is\r\nunloaded, that is, without the film. If the size of the diaphragm can be\r\nchanged, change it and look into the lens to see the effect; also try\r\nadjusting the shutter and watch the lens for the effect of instantaneous\r\nand time exposures. Try the focussing scale, locate some image in the\r\nfinder, and practise holding the camera pressed closely against your\r\nbody, pointing neither up nor down, tipping neither to one side nor the\r\nother, but aimed directly at the object you are supposed to be\r\nphotographing. Then try turning the key which brings the film exposures\r\ninto position.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Loading the Camera=\r\n\r\nLearn how to load and to unload, first without unrolling your film.\r\nAfterward adjust the roll in the camera and see that it is properly\r\nplaced and will turn easily, before you loosen the end of the film. If\r\nyou detach the gummed paper which keeps the film tightly wrapped before\r\nplacing the roll in the camera, the whole film will spring loose from\r\nits spool and become light-struck before you can adjust it.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Count the Turns of the Key=\r\n\r\nWith your first roll of films it is well to learn and remember the\r\nnumber of turns you must give the key to bring a new exposure into\r\nplace. With my camera which takes a four-by-five picture, five turns of\r\nthe key are necessary between the exposures. Knowing this, I count, and\r\nwhen the fifth turn is reached I complete it slowly, watching carefully\r\nthe while for the new number to appear in the little red celluloid\r\nwindow. In this way, even when hurried or excited, I do not lose an\r\nexposure by turning the key once too often. Always remember to place a\r\nnew exposure _directly after_ taking a picture, to make sure that you\r\nwill not take two on one film. In making ready for a new subject count\r\nagain, for there are four things one must be sure of with most cameras\r\nbefore taking a photograph, and by counting you will know if any have\r\nbeen omitted:\r\n\r\n          (1) See that a fresh exposure is in place.\r\n\r\n          (2) See that the shutter is properly adjusted for\r\n          instantaneous (or time) exposure.\r\n\r\n          (3) See that diaphragm stop is set at the proper\r\n          opening for the light you will have.\r\n\r\n          (4) See that the distance is correctly focussed.\r\n\r\nThere are cameras, however, that are of universal focus and do not need\r\nadjustment. These are convenient ones for the trail, as they are always\r\nready and can be used quickly. Being small, they are also light to\r\ncarry.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Be Economical with Your Films=\r\n\r\nA very important thing to learn when taking photographs is to be\r\neconomical with your films, and especially is this so when on the trail,\r\nfor your supply is then necessarily limited. Merely for the sake of\r\nusing the new toy, many amateurs will photograph subjects that are not\r\nof the slightest interest to any one, and very often, when a scene or\r\nobject does present itself that is well worth while, all the films will\r\nhave been wasted and no picture can be taken.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Plan Your Pictures to Illustrate Your Trip=\r\n\r\nIt is a good idea to plan your pictures so that they will illustrate\r\nyour trip from beginning to end. A snap-shot of your party starting on\r\nthe trail, another of the country through which you pass, with, perhaps,\r\none or two figures in it, and the remainder of the films used on objects\r\nof interest found on the way. If you can secure pictures of any wild\r\nanimals you may see, they will make the series doubly interesting and\r\nvaluable. When you go into camp a view of the camp should be included.\r\nWhen the pictures are printed write on the back of each what it\r\nrepresents, where taken, and the date; they will then be valuable data\r\nas well as trustworthy reminders.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Backgrounds=\r\n\r\nLook for the best view of a subject before using your camera; there is\r\nalways a choice. One side may be much more pleasing or more\r\ncharacteristic than the other, or may show interesting details more\r\nplainly. If you have studied drawing you will be able also to find the\r\nview which makes the best composition. The background, too, must be\r\nconsidered, and the position of the sun. The simpler the background the\r\nbetter. Near-by foliage is not good for figures; it is too confused and\r\nthe figures will mingle with it. Sometimes the adjustable portrait-lens,\r\nwhich can be slipped over the other, will obviate that trouble by\r\nblurring everything not in exact focus, and this lens will allow you to\r\nstand nearer the object and so make it larger on the film. It is not\r\nintended for distant views and the camera should not be more than six\r\nfeet from the subject when it is used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The white birch-tree makes a fine background for the\r\nbeaver.]\r\n\r\nQuiet water makes an excellent background, also distant foliage and\r\nhills, flat fields and meadows. These may be obtained for figures, but\r\noften the very things you want to photograph most are in the woods with\r\nfoliage close to and all around them; then you must simply do the best\r\nyou can under the circumstances.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Color Values in Photographs=\r\n\r\nAnother thing to remember is that, unless in broad sunlight, green will\r\ntake dark and sometimes black; and brown or tan, being of the same color\r\nvalue in the photograph, will mingle with and often be lost in the\r\nbackground. If you are photographing a tawny animal, and most wild\r\nanimals are tawny, try to get it when in the sunlight with a dark or\r\nflat background, or else against a background lighter in color than the\r\nanimal. For instance, a red squirrel or chipmunk will be lost amid, or\r\nagainst, the foliage of a tree, but on a fence rail or fallen log it\r\nwill stand out distinctly.\r\n\r\nIf you have a chance at a beaver it will be near the water, of course.\r\nThen the choice view will be where the water can form at least part of\r\nthe background. If the shore is at the back it may be difficult when the\r\nprint is made to find the beaver at all. In the interesting photograph\r\nshown here the beaver is against the light trunk of the tree which shows\r\nwhere he has gnawed it almost through. In all this the position of the\r\nsun must be taken into account, but the rule of always having the sun at\r\nyour back, like most other rules, has its exceptions. I have found that\r\nso long as the sun lights up the object, even when from one side, I can\r\nsecure a good picture; but I never allow it to strike the lens of the\r\ncamera, and I make sure that the subject is not silhouetted against its\r\nbackground by having all the light at its back.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Blacktail deer snapped with a background of snow.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Photographing Wild Animals=\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to photograph wild animals after you have found them, but\r\nyou can do it if you are quick to see and to act and are also patient\r\nenough to wait for a good opportunity. You will often find deer feeding\r\nin sunlit places and can, if you stalk them carefully, approach near\r\nenough to get a good shot. If they happen to be in partial or light\r\nshadow, open the diaphragm of your camera at its widest stop and try for\r\nan instantaneous exposure. Very good photographs are sometimes taken by\r\nthat method, and it is worth the experiment where time exposures are out\r\nof the question, as in taking moving animals. A snap-shot will be of no\r\navail if the shadow is heavy, however, and a short time exposure may\r\nsometimes be used. Set your time lever at No. 1, which means one second,\r\nand the lever controlling the diaphragm at No. 16, and by pressing the\r\nbulb once you will have a time exposure of one second. An important\r\nthing for you to realize in taking animal photographs is the fact that\r\nthough the creature may seem quite near as you see it with your natural\r\neye, in the picture it will occupy only the relative space that it does\r\non the finder. If it covers a quarter of the space on the finder it will\r\ncover a quarter, no more and no less, of the finished photograph.\r\n\r\nThe wonderful pictures we see of wild animals are usually the work of\r\nprofessionals who have especially adapted cameras; but to take the\r\nphotograph oneself makes even a poor one of more value.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The skunk.\r\n\r\nDon\'t get too near when you try to photograph him.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Shutter Speed=\r\n\r\nTo photograph objects in rapid motion such as flying birds, the speed of\r\nyour shutter must be at least one three-hundredths of a second and you\r\nmust have a fast lens; but with a shutter speed of one one-hundredth I\r\nhave taken very good pictures of things moving at a moderate rate. A\r\nwalking or slowly running animal, for instance, can be taken with a\r\nshutter speed of one one-hundredth. You should find out the speed of the\r\nshutter when you buy your camera, then you will not throw away films on\r\nthings beyond its possibilities. "You press the button and we\'ll do the\r\nrest" doesn\'t work where moving objects are concerned.\r\n\r\nThose who go a-gunning with the camera, stalk their game as carefully as\r\nany hunter with a gun, and for really good results the following method\r\nis the safest to adopt. Time and patience are required, but one does not\r\nmind giving these, the interest is so absorbing and the successful\r\npicture so well worth while.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Set Your Camera Like a Trap=\r\n\r\nFind the spot frequented by the animal or bird you are after, wait for\r\nit to go away of its own accord while confident and unfrightened, then\r\nset up your camera like a trap where the lens will point to the place\r\nthe bird or animal will probably occupy upon its return.\r\n\r\nIf it is a nest it will be easy, for you can be sure the bird will come\r\nback there and can adjust your camera to take in the entire nest. Where\r\nthere is no nest, sight your camera upon some object between which and\r\nthe lens the creature must come in order to be within focus, and trample\r\ndown any undergrowth that may obstruct the view. Make sure that your\r\nfocus is correct for the distance and that the film will take in the\r\nwhole animal. You can provide for this by staking off the probable size\r\nof the animal at the place where you expect it to stand, and then\r\nlooking in the finder to see if both stakes are in focus. You will\r\nprobably have to raise the camera from the ground and perhaps tip it a\r\nlittle. For this a low tripod is best but if you haven\'t that, and very\r\nlikely you will not, a convenient log, stump, or stone will answer the\r\npurpose. If even these are not handy you can build up a stand of stones\r\nor small logs, or pile earth into a mound. Whatever material you use,\r\nthe stand must be made strong and firm. To have it slip or slide is to\r\nlose the picture. Make your camera perfectly secure and immovable on the\r\nstand, then tie a long cord to the release (the small lever which works\r\nthe shutter). The cord must be amply long enough to reach to the ambush\r\nwhere you will hide while awaiting your game. The ambush may be a clump\r\nof bushes, a convenient rock, or a tree behind which you will be\r\nconcealed. If there is no such cover near you can make one of brush and\r\nbranches. When the cord is carried from the camera to the ambush hide\r\nthe camera with leafy branches, leaving a good opening for the cord to\r\npass through to prevent it from becoming entangled. Then hie to your\r\ncover and, with the slightly slack cord in your hand, await the coming\r\nof your game.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The porcupine stood in the shade but the background was\r\nlight.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Taking the Picture=\r\n\r\nAs the animal approaches the camera grasp your cord firmly and steady\r\nyour nerves to act quickly, and when it is in focus, not before, give a\r\nquick, firm pull to the cord, releasing it immediately, and the thing is\r\ndone. Don\'t become excited at the critical moment and make your shot too\r\nsoon or jerk the cord too hard. If a bird is to be taken upon the nest\r\nand the nest is in shadow a short time exposure can be given, or a bulb\r\nexposure. For bulb exposure set the lever that controls the shutter at\r\n_B_ (meaning bulb), and the lever controlling the diaphragm at No. 16.\r\nWhen the bird has settled upon its nest pull the cord, count three\r\nslowly, and release it. The shutter will remain open as long as the cord\r\nis held taut and will close when released. This method cannot be used\r\nfor long time exposures. When you become more practised in the art of\r\nwild-life photography you will know how much time to allow for the\r\nexposures. There will be some failures, of course, but one good\r\nphotograph among several will repay you for all your trouble and will\r\nmake you keen to try again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Photographing a woodcock from ambush.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Photographing the Trail=\r\n\r\nYou can get a good picture of the trail with a snap-shot when it is in\r\nthe open, but a forest trail must have time exposure. When your eyes\r\nhave become accustomed to the dim light of the woods it will not seem\r\ndark, and you will be tempted to try a snap-shot because it is easier,\r\nbut if you do you may certainly count that a lost film. It is not\r\npossible to hold your camera in your hands and succeed with a time\r\nexposure of over one second. The beating of your heart will jar it, a\r\nbreath will make it move, so some kind of a rest must be found as when\r\ntaking the animals with bulb exposure. If the light is very dim first\r\nset the lever controlling the shutter at the point _T_ (time), then set\r\nthe lever for the diaphragm at No. 16, press the bulb, and allow from\r\nfifteen to twenty seconds\', or even thirty seconds\', exposure.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Timing Without a Watch=\r\n\r\nYou can time it without a watch by counting in this way:\r\none-and-two-and-three-and-up to the number of seconds required. One-and\r\nis one second.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The country through which you pass, with a trailer in the\r\nforeground.]\r\n\r\nWhen the seconds have been counted, press the bulb again and if the\r\ncamera has not moved you should have a good negative. No hard-and-fast\r\nrules can be given for this work because conditions vary; you must\r\nrely some on your judgment and learn by experience. It is said that\r\noverexposure is better than underexposure and can be handled better in\r\ndeveloping the films, so when in doubt it is well to allow a little more\r\ntime than you think should be necessary. Curious results sometimes come\r\nfrom underexposed films. I once had a print in outline, like a drawing,\r\nfrom a negative made in the Rocky Mountains. It did not look in the\r\nleast like a photograph, there were no shadows, but it was a good\r\nillustration of the scene.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Photographing Flowers and Ferns=\r\n\r\nIf your camera will focus so that you can place it near enough to take\r\nsmall objects such as flowers and ferns, another field of interest is\r\nopen to you and you can add a record of those found on the trail to\r\ncomplete your series. A camping trip will afford better and more\r\nunhurried opportunities for photographing flowers than a one day\'s\r\ntrail, unless you carry a box or basket with you for securing specimens\r\nthat you can take back and photograph at leisure. Do not break the stems\r\nof the flowers or plants, take them roots and all. Loosen the soil all\r\naround and under the roots so that which clings to the plant may be\r\nundisturbed and taken up with it. If the soil falls away, cover the root\r\nwith damp loam or mud and tie it up in a large leaf as in illustration.\r\nThis method not only keeps it from wilting but will enable you to take a\r\npicture of the growing plant with all its interesting characteristics.\r\nIf you put your plant with its clod of earth in a _shallow_ bowl, pour\r\nin as much water as the bowl will hold, and keep it always full, it will\r\nremain fresh and vigorous a long while and may be transplanted to\r\ncontinue its life and growth after you have finished with it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: METHOD OF PROTECTING ROOTS TO KEEP PLANTS FRESH WHILE YOU\r\nCARRY THEM TO CAMP FOR PHOTOGRAPHING\r\n\r\nMUD AROUND THE ROOTS\r\n\r\nWRAPPED IN LEAVES]\r\n\r\nJust here must come the caution not to tear up wild plants by their\r\nroots unless they are to serve a real purpose. Some of our most\r\nbeautiful wild flowers and rarest ferns are now in danger of being\r\nexterminated because of thoughtless and careless people who, in\r\ngathering them, will not even take the trouble to break the stems. When\r\nthe roots are gone there will be no more flowers and ferns.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Look at the Date on Your Film=\r\n\r\nEven the best photographer cannot take good photographs unless he has\r\ngood films. On the box of every roll of films is stamped the latest date\r\nwhen it may be safely developed and it is foolish to try to have a film\r\ndeveloped after that date has passed. When you buy your films be sure\r\nthey are fresh ones and that the date insures you ample time; one year\r\nahead is none too long.\r\n\r\nDo not open the box or take the wrappings from a roll of films until you\r\nare ready to load your camera. Then save both box and wrappings, and\r\nwhen your films have been exposed, use them for covering the roll again.\r\nKeep the wrapped and boxed rolls in a dark place until they can be\r\ndeveloped. Dampness will spoil both films and plates. If you are in a\r\ndamp climate, or on shipboard, keep them in a tin box, tightly closed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nON AND IN THE WATER\r\n\r\n=Boats Safe and Unsafe. Canoeing. Rowing.

Swimming.\r\nFishing=\r\n\r\n\r\n=Safe and Unsafe Boats=\r\n\r\nOne seldom goes on the long trail, or into camp, without encountering\r\nwater, and boats of some kind must be used, generally rowboats or\r\ncanoes. The safest boat on placid water is the heavy, flat-bottomed\r\nrowboat with oars secured to the oar-locks. In my younger days we owned\r\nsuch a boat, and no one felt in the least anxious when I would put off\r\nfor hours alone on the lake at our camp in Pike County, Pa.; especially\r\nas the creaking turn of the oar-locks could easily be heard at camp\r\nloudly proclaiming that I still lived, while I enjoyed the luxury of\r\nsolitary adventure. But a tub of this kind is not adapted to all waters\r\nand all purposes, and the safest boat on any water is the one best\r\nadapted to it and to the purpose for which the boat is used.\r\n\r\nRound-bottomed boats tip easily and should, therefore, not be used when\r\nlearning to row, though they are safe enough in the hands of those\r\naccustomed to their management. The best of oarsmen, however, cannot\r\nprevent her boat from capsizing if her passenger does not know how to\r\nenter or leave it, or to sit still when aboard.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A rowboat is a safer craft than a canoe.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Stepping in and out of a Boat=\r\n\r\nTo step on the gunwale (the edge of the boat) will naturally tip it and\r\nmost likely turn it over. One should always step directly into the\r\n_middle_ in order to keep the boat evenly balanced, and in getting out,\r\nstep _from_ the middle. Stepping on the side or the gunwale of a boat\r\nshows the ignorance of a tenderfoot. There are rowboats that are neither\r\nround-bottomed nor flat but are shaped like the boat in photograph, page\r\n206. These are safer than the round-bottomed, but are more easily\r\ncapsized than the flat-bottomed boats.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Canoes and Canoeing=\r\n\r\nIf you are to own a canoe select it carefully; consult catalogues of\r\nreliable dealers, and, if possible, have an experienced and good\r\ncanoeist help you choose it. The pretty canoe made of wood will answer\r\nin calm waters and wear well with careful usage, but sportsmen prefer\r\nthe canvas-covered canoe, declaring it the best boat for cruising, as it\r\nis light, easy to manage, will stand rough usage, and will also carry\r\ngreater loads. The best make has a frame of hardwood with cedar ribs and\r\nplanking; spruce gunwales and brass bang-plates to protect the ends.\r\nThis canoe is covered with strong canvas, treated with some kind of\r\nfiller, and then painted and varnished. There are usually two cane\r\nseats, one at the stern, the other near the bow. These are built in.\r\nCanoes vary in the shape of the bow, some being higher than others. The\r\nhigh bow prevents the shipping of too much water, but will also offer\r\nresistance to the wind and so impede the progress of the boat. A medium\r\nhigh bow is the best.\r\n\r\nOne firm of camp-outfitters advertises a canoe called the Sponson, the\r\nname being taken from the air-chambers built along the outside rail,\r\nwhich are called sponsons. It is claimed that these air-chambers make it\r\nnext to impossible to upset the canoe, and that even when filled with\r\nwater it will support a heavy weight. Sponsons can also be purchased\r\nseparately and can be adjusted to any sized canoe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Keep your body steady.]\r\n\r\nFor a novice the sponsons would seem a good thing, as they not only\r\ninsure safety but, in doing away with the fear of an upset, make\r\nlearning to paddle easier. Then there are the guide canoes made\r\nespecially for hunting and fishing. They are strong, flat-bottomed, will\r\ncarry a heavy load, are easy to paddle or pole, and will stand rough\r\nwater. These canoes are good for general use on the trail.\r\n\r\nThe prices of a _good_ canoe range from twenty-eight dollars to forty\r\ndollars. One may go higher, of course, but the essentials of the canoe\r\nwill be no better. A lower price means, as a rule, not so good a boat.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Paddles=\r\n\r\nGirls and women generally require shorter paddles than men, as they do\r\nnot have the same reach of arm, and you can take your choice of lengths.\r\nFor the stern the paddle should be longer than for the bow. Paddles are\r\nmade of red oak, maple, ash, spruce, and cherry. Some authorities prefer\r\nspruce for ordinary usage, but in rough water and in shooting rapids a\r\nharder wood is best. The weak part of a paddle is where the blade joins\r\nthe handle, and this part should not be too slender. If you use spruce\r\npaddles keep them smooth by trimming away all roughness and keep them\r\nwell shellacked, else they may become water-soaked. Paddles range in\r\nprice from one dollar and fifty cents to three dollars.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Canoeing on placid waters.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Accessories=\r\n\r\nA strong, healthy girl will no more need cushions and canoe-chairs than\r\na boy, but a back rest is not always to be despised. It is well to\r\nhave a large sponge aboard for bailing and for cleaning.\r\n\r\nAt a portage or "carry," the canoe is carried overland on the shoulders,\r\nand though some guides scorn to use a carrier, others are glad of them.\r\nThere are several styles, one being the neck-yoke carrier, another the\r\npneumatic canoe-yoke. The pneumatic yoke, when not inflated with air,\r\ncan be rolled into a bundle three by six inches, and when inflated it\r\ncan also be used for a canoe-seat, a camp-seat, and even for a pillow.\r\nIts weight is two pounds and the catalogue price is three dollars and\r\ntwenty-five cents.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Care of the Canoe=\r\n\r\nEven the strongest canoe should be well cared for. To leave it in the\r\nwater for any length of time, when not in use, is to run the risk of\r\ndamage and loss. A sudden storm will batter it against shore, send it\r\nadrift, or fill and sink it. A canoe should always be _lifted_, not\r\ndragged, ashore, and it should be turned upside down on the bank with a\r\nsupport in the middle so that it will not be strained by resting only on\r\nthe ends.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Getting in the Canoe=\r\n\r\nNever allow any one to get into your canoe or to sit on it when it is\r\nout of the water. That is harder on it than many days of actual use.\r\nWhen you are to get aboard your canoe, bring it up broadside to the\r\nshore and put one foot exactly in the middle, then carefully place the\r\nother beside it and sit down quickly, but with care to keep your\r\nbalance. If there is no one to hold the canoe for you, use your paddle\r\nto steady yourself by pushing it down to the bottom on the side away\r\nfrom shore. This will keep the canoe from slipping away from under you\r\nwhile you are stepping in. One of the first things to learn in\r\ncanoeing is to preserve your balance; even a slight lurch to one side or\r\nthe other must be avoided. Make every necessary movement cautiously and\r\ndo not look backward unless absolutely necessary. Never attempt to\r\nchange places with any one while in the canoe. If the change must be\r\nmade, land and change there.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bring your canoe up broadside to the shore.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Upset=\r\n\r\nShould there be an upset keep hold of your paddle, it will help to keep\r\nyou afloat, then if you can reach your craft and hold to it without\r\ntrying to climb upon it you can keep your head above water until help\r\narrives or until you can tread water to shore. If you can swim you are\r\ncomparatively safe, and a girl who goes often on the trail should, by\r\nall means, be a swimmer.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Paddling=\r\n\r\nSome expert canoeists strongly advise kneeling in the bottom of the\r\ncanoe while paddling, for at least part of the time, but the usual\r\nmethod is to sit on the seats provided at bow and stern, or sit on the\r\nbottom. The kneeling paddler has her canoe in better control, and\r\nbecomes more one with it than one who sits. In shooting rapids and in\r\nrough weather kneeling is the safest when one knows how to paddle in\r\nthat position. It is a good thing to learn both methods.\r\n\r\nWhen you paddle close one hand firmly on the end of the paddle and the\r\nother around the handle a short distance above the blade. Then, keeping\r\nyour body steady, dip your paddle into the water slightly in front of\r\nyou and sweep it backward and downward toward the stern, keeping it\r\nclose to the canoe. You face the bow in a canoe, remember, and reach\r\nforward for your stroke. At the finish of a stroke turn the paddle\r\nedgewise and slide it out of the water. For the next stroke bring the\r\nblade forward, swinging it horizontally with the blade parallel to the\r\nwater, and slide it edgewise into the water again in front of you. Fig.\r\n34 shows the beginning of a stroke, Fig. 35 while the stroke is in\r\nprogress, and Fig. 36 the ending. During the stroke bring your upper\r\nhand forward across your face or breast, and with the lower draw the\r\nblade through the water.\r\n\r\nIt is well to begin as bow paddler, for your duty there, in smooth\r\nwater, is to watch for obstructions such as hidden rocks and submerged\r\nlogs or snags, while the paddler at the stern must steer the canoe and\r\nkeep it in a straight course.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning learn to paddle as well from one side as from the\r\nother. To be able to change sides is very restful and sometimes a quick\r\nchange will prevent an accident. Like many other things, the knack of\r\npaddling will come with experience and will then require no more thought\r\nthan keeping your balance on a bicycle and steering it.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Loading a Canoe=\r\n\r\nA top-heavy canoe is decidedly dangerous, that is why it is safest to\r\nsit or kneel on the bottom, and in loading your camp stuff bear the fact\r\nwell in mind. Pack the load as low in the canoe as possible with the\r\nheaviest things at the bottom, but use common sense and do not put\r\nthings that should be kept dry underneath where any water that is\r\nshipped will settle and soak them. Think again and put cooking utensils\r\nand lunch provender where you can reach them without unloading the\r\ncanoe. The packing should be done in such a way as to cause the canoe\r\nto tip neither at one end or at the other, and certainly not to one\r\nside.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 34 36\r\n\r\n35 How to use the paddle and a flat-bottomed rowboat.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Rowing=\r\n\r\nA rowboat is a safer craft than a canoe, and rowing is not a difficult\r\nfeat, but there is a difference between the rowing of a heavy\r\nflat-bottomed boat and rowing a light skiff or round-bottomed rowboat.\r\nIn rowing properly one\'s body does most of the work and the strain comes\r\nmore on the muscles of the back than on those of the arms.\r\n\r\nIn paddling you face the bow of the canoe; in rowing you are turned\r\naround and face the stern of your boat. In paddling you reach forward\r\nand draw your paddle back; in rowing you lean back and pull your oars\r\nforward. When beginning a stroke grasp the handles of your oars firmly\r\nnear the ends, lean forward with arms outstretched and elbows straight,\r\nthe oars slanting backward, and, by bearing down on the handles of the\r\noars, lift the blades above the water. Then drop them in edgewise and\r\npull, straightening your body, bending your elbows, and bringing your\r\nhands together one above the other. As you finish the stroke bear down\r\non your oars to lift the blades out of the water again, turn your wrists\r\nto bring the flat of the blades almost parallel with the water but with\r\nthe back edge lifted a little; then bend forward and, sweeping the oars\r\nbackward, turning the edge down, plunge them in the water for another\r\npull. Turning the wrists at the beginning of a stroke feathers the oar,\r\nthe forward edge of which is sometimes allowed to skim lightly over the\r\nsurface of the water as the oar is carried backward. In steering with\r\nthe oars you pull hardest on the oar on the side _opposite_ to the\r\ndirection you wish to take. A little practise and all this comes easy\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nThe thing for a beginner to avoid is "catching a crab." That is,\r\ndipping the oars so lightly in the water as not to give sufficient hold,\r\nwhich will cause them, when pulled forward, to fly up and send the rower\r\nsprawling on her back. In dipping too deeply there is danger of losing\r\nan oar by the suction of the water. Experience will teach the proper\r\ndepth for the stroke.\r\n\r\nOn some of the Adirondack lakes the round-bottomed rowboats are used\r\nalmost exclusively, but the boat with a narrow, flat bottom is safer and\r\nis both light and easy to row. A cedar rowboat is the most desirable.\r\nThe oars should be light for ordinary rowing yet strong enough to\r\nprevent their snapping above the blade in rough water.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Rafts=\r\n\r\nYou can never tell just what will happen when you go on the long trail,\r\nthat is one of its charms, nor do you know what you will be called upon\r\nto do. The girl best versed in the ways of the water as well as of the\r\nwoods is surest of safety, and can be most helpful to her party.\r\nPossibly you may never be called upon to build a raft, and again an\r\nemergency may arise when a raft will not only be convenient but\r\nabsolutely necessary. When such an emergency does come it is not likely\r\nthat you will have anything besides the roughest of building material\r\nand no tools besides your small axe or hatchet. But with your axe you\r\ncan chop off limbs of sufficient size for the raft from fallen trees,\r\nand with ropes made of the inner bark of trees you can bind your small\r\nlogs together in such a way as to hold them firmly. Do not use green\r\nwood, it will not float like the dry. Logs about twelve inches in\r\ndiameter are the best, but half that size will make a good raft. Six\r\nfeet by twelve is a fair size. The smaller the logs the larger the raft\r\nmust be in order to carry any weight, for it must cover a wider surface\r\nof water than is necessary for one made of large logs. One good-sized\r\nlog will carry your weight easily, but a small one will sink beneath\r\nyou.\r\n\r\nIf you have two long, strong ropes you can use them for binding the logs\r\ntogether; if not you must make the ropes from fibre of some kind. Daniel\r\nC. Beard in his book, "Boat-Building and Boating," tells of making a\r\nvery strong rope of the inner bark of a chestnut-tree which had been\r\nkilled by fire. The fibre torn off in long strips must be twisted by two\r\npersons, or one end may be tied to a branch while you twist the other.\r\nWhen two are twisting one person takes one end, the other takes the\r\nother end, and, standing as far apart as possible, each twists the fibre\r\nbetween her fingers, turning it in opposite directions until when held\r\nslack it will double on itself and make a double twist. The ends are\r\nthen brought together and the rope kept from snarling until it is bent\r\nat the middle and allowed to double twist evenly all the way to the end.\r\nThe fibre rope will be a little less than _half_ the length of the\r\noriginal strands, and it should be about the size of heavy clothes-line\r\nrope. The short lengths of rope must be tied together to make two long\r\nropes. Use the square knot in tying to make sure that it will not slip.\r\nWhen the knot is wet it will be quite secure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The raft of logs.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Primitive Weaving Method=\r\n\r\nFor tying the logs together use the primitive weaving method. Lay three\r\nlengths of rope on the ground, one for the middle and one each for the\r\nends of the logs. Roll one log along the ropes until it rests across the\r\nmiddle of each rope, then turn each rope over the log, forming a bight\r\nas in Fig. 37. Bring the lower rope over the upper (Fig. 38) to form a\r\nloop, and turn it back over the log (Fig. 39). This leaves the log with\r\nthree loops of rope around it, one end of each rope lying on the\r\nground, the other end turned back over the log. Now roll another log\r\nover the lower ropes up close to the first log (Fig. 40). Bring down the\r\nupper ropes over the second log (Fig. 41), cross the lower ropes _over_\r\nthe upper ones and turn them back (Fig. 42). Draw the ropes tight and\r\npush the logs as closely together as possible; unless your logs are\r\nstraight there will be wide spaces between. Roll the third log over the\r\nlower ropes and make the weaving loop as with the other two, _always_\r\ncrossing the lower rope _over_ the upper (Fig. 43). Continue weaving in\r\nnew logs until the raft is the required width, then tie the ends of the\r\nropes around the last log. Remember to keep the ropes on the ground\r\nalways in a straight line without slanting them, otherwise the sides of\r\nyour raft will not be at right angles to the ends, and it will be a\r\ncrazily built affair, cranky and difficult to manage.\r\n\r\nChop notches on the outside logs where the ropes are to pass over them,\r\nand they will keep the rope from slipping out of place (Fig. 44). Cut\r\ntwo, more slender, logs for the ends of the raft and lash them on across\r\nthe others as in Fig. 45. The end logs should extend a little beyond\r\neach side of the raft. Fasten a rope with a strong slip knot to one end\r\nof the cross log and wrap it over the log and under the first lengthwise\r\nlog, then over and under again to form a cross on top. When the rope is\r\nunder the second time bring it up between the second and third log, then\r\ndown between the third and fourth log, and so on to the end, when you\r\nmust make a secure fastening. These cross logs give additional strength,\r\nkeep the raft in shape, and prevent its shipping too much water.\r\n\r\nIf you will make a miniature raft, following these directions carefully,\r\nwhen the time comes for you to build a full-sized one you will be quite\r\nfamiliar with the method of construction and will know exactly how to go\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 37 38 39\r\n\r\n40 41 42\r\n\r\n43\r\n\r\n44\r\n\r\n45\r\n\r\nPrimitive weaving in raft building.]\r\n\r\nFor the little raft use small, straight branches about twelve inches\r\nlong. Twist your slender rope of fibre if you can get it, of string if\r\nyou cannot, and weave it around the sticks just as you would weave the\r\nrope around the logs, finishing off with the two end sticks for the end\r\nlogs.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Poling=\r\n\r\nIf you have a raft you must know how to pole it, and at times it is\r\nnecessary to pole other kinds of craft. Select a straight pole of\r\nstrong, green wood eight feet or more in length. The length of the pole\r\nwill depend upon the depth of the water, for it must be long enough to\r\nreach bottom. Trim off all the small branches and make it as smooth as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nWhen the water is deep and calm a pole may sometimes be used as a paddle\r\nto send the raft along, but its real purpose is to push from the bottom.\r\nIn poling you must necessarily stand near the edge of the raft and must\r\ntherefore be careful not to lean too far over the water lest you lose\r\nyour balance and fall in.\r\n\r\nPoling is a primitive, go-as-you-please method of propelling a craft and\r\nis almost free from rules except those suggested by the common sense of\r\nthe poler. Like the early pioneers, you simply do the best you can under\r\nthe circumstances and are alert to take advantage of every element in\r\nyour favor. Where there is a current you pole for it and then allow your\r\nraft to float with it, provided it goes in the direction you wish to\r\ntake and is not too swift. In this case you use your pole for steering,\r\nwhich may sometimes be done from the stern, making a rudder of the pole,\r\nat others from the side, and at times reaching down to the river bed. If\r\nthe current runs the wrong way be careful to keep out of it as much as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nShallow water near the shore is usually the most quiet and the safest\r\nfor a raft. Here you can generally pole your raft up-stream when the\r\nwater is deep enough to float it and is not obstructed by rocks, logs,\r\nor snags. A raft is not safe where there is a swift current, and there\r\nshould always be strong arms to manage it.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Swimming=\r\n\r\nIf you will realize that your body is buoyant, not a dead weight in the\r\nwater, and that swimming should come as naturally to you as to the wild\r\ncreatures, it may help you to gain the confidence so essential in\r\nlearning to swim. If you are not afraid of the water you will not\r\nstruggle while in it, and the air in your lungs will keep you afloat\r\nwhile you learn to make the movements that will carry you along. You\r\nwill not sink if you are quite calm and move only your hands _under_\r\nwater with a slight paddling movement. Keep in mind that every inch\r\nabove water but adds so much to the weight to sink you lower. To throw\r\nup your arms is the surest way of going straight to the bottom. Do not\r\nbe afraid to allow the water to come up and partially cover your chin.\r\n\r\nAll sorts of contrivances have been invented to keep a person afloat\r\nwhile learning to swim, but they all tend to take from, rather than to\r\ngive confidence, for it is natural to depend entirely upon them and to\r\nfeel helpless when they are taken away. According to my own experience\r\nthe best method is to have a friend place a hand under your chin while\r\nher feet are touching bottom and to walk with you while you learn to\r\nmake the swimming movements. This will keep your head above water and\r\ngive you a sense of security, and you will then strike out confidently.\r\nThe support rendered is so slight you learn to manage your own weight in\r\nthe water almost immediately, while you have the feeling that some one\r\nupholds you, and the friendly hand may be withdrawn at intervals to\r\nallow you to try entirely alone.\r\n\r\nYou see that after all it is the _feeling_ of being supported more than\r\nthe actual support that counts, and if you can convince yourself that\r\nyou need no support you won\'t need it. It is best to start by swimming\r\n_toward_ land instead of away from it. To know that you are not going\r\nbeyond your depth but are gaining the shore is a great help in\r\nconquering fear.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Movements in Swimming=\r\n\r\nIf you are learning alone, begin in quiet, shallow water only deep\r\nenough to float you; waist-high is sufficiently deep. Assume the first\r\nposition for swimming by throwing your body forward with arms extended\r\nand palms of hands together, at the same time lifting your feet from the\r\nbottom with a spring. This should bring your body out perfectly straight\r\nin the water, feet together and arms ready for the first movement.\r\n\r\nNow separate your hands, turn them palm outward, and swing your arms\r\naround in a half-circle until they extend straight out from the sides,\r\npushing the water back with your hands. In the second movement bend your\r\nelbows and bring them down with palms of hands together under your chin,\r\nand at the same time draw your legs up under your body with knees and\r\nfeet still held close together. The third movement is to send your arms\r\nshooting straight ahead, while your legs, separating, describe a\r\nhalf-circle and your feet pushing against the water force you forward\r\nand then come together again in the first position.\r\n\r\nThis is a point to be remembered: always thrust your hands forward, to\r\nopen the way, and your feet back, to push yourself through it, at the\r\n_same time_. It is like a wire spring being freed at both ends at once,\r\neach end springing away from the middle. When you push the spring\r\ntogether, that is, when in taking the second movement you draw in your\r\nhands and feet, do it slowly; then take the third movement--letting the\r\nspring out--quickly, thrusting out your hands in front and your feet at\r\nthe back with a sudden movement, pushing your feet strongly against the\r\nwater and stretching yourself out as far as you can reach.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE FRIENDLY HAND UNDER YOUR CHIN WILL GIVE YOU\r\nCONFIDENCE\r\n\r\nLEARN TO TREAD WATER FOR SAFETY\r\n\r\nLearn to be at home in the water.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Floating=\r\n\r\nSome people can float who cannot swim. Others can swim but are not able\r\nto float. That is, they think they are not and do not seem willing to\r\ntry, but it is quite necessary every one should know how to rest in the\r\nwater, and learning to float is very essential.\r\n\r\nThe hand of a friend will help you in this as in learning to swim, but\r\nfor floating it is held under the back of your head instead of under\r\nyour chin. Lie on your back with legs straight before you, feet\r\ntogether, arms close at your sides, and head thrown back; trust the\r\nwater to bear you up and all that is necessary to keep you afloat is a\r\nrotary motion of your hands _under_ water. After a time all movement may\r\nbe given up and you will lie easily and quietly as on a bed. It is said\r\nthat it is easier for women and girls to float than for men, because\r\ntheir bones are lighter, and some learn to float the first time they\r\nenter the water; all of which is very encouraging to girls. Breathe\r\ndeeply but naturally while floating, for the more air there is in your\r\nlungs the more buoyant will be your body and the higher it will float.\r\nIf your body is inclined to roll from side to side spread out your arms\r\n_under_ water until you steady yourself. If your feet persist in sinking\r\nextend your arms above your head _under_ water and this will maintain\r\nthe balance.\r\n\r\nDo not try to lift your head, but keep it well back in the water. If\r\nyour nose and mouth are out that is all that is necessary. Let your\r\nmuscles relax and lie limply.\r\n\r\nTo regain your feet after floating bring your arms in front and pull on\r\nthe water with scooped hands while raising your body from the hips.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Diving=\r\n\r\nYou will learn to dive merely for the joy of the quick plunge into cool\r\nwaters, but there are times when to understand diving may mean the\r\nsaving of your own or some one else\'s life, and no matter how suddenly\r\nor unexpectedly you are cast into the water by accident, you will retain\r\nyour self-possession and be able to strike out and swim immediately.\r\n\r\nOne should never dive into unknown water if it can be avoided, but as on\r\nthe trail all water is likely to be unknown, investigate it well before\r\ndiving and look out for hidden rocks. Do not dive into shallow water;\r\nthat is dangerous. If you are to dive from the bank some distance above\r\nthe water, stand on the edge with your toes reaching over it. Extend\r\nyour arms, raise them, and duck your head between with your arms,\r\nforming an arch above, your ears covered by your arms. Lock your thumbs\r\ntogether to keep your hands from separating when they strike the water.\r\nBend your knees slightly and spring from them, but straighten them\r\nimmediately so that you will be stretched full length as you enter the\r\nwater. As soon as your body is in the water curve your back inward, lift\r\nyour head up, and make a curve through the water to the surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Breathing=\r\n\r\nBreathe through your nose always when swimming as well as when walking.\r\nTo open your mouth while swimming is usually to swallow a pint or two of\r\nwater. Exhale your breath as you thrust your hands forward, inhale it as\r\nyou bring them back. "Blow your hands from you."\r\n\r\n\r\n=Treading Water=\r\n\r\nIn treading water you maintain an upright position as in walking. Some\r\none says: "To tread water is like running up-stairs rapidly." Try\r\nrunning up-stairs and you will get the leg movement. While the water is\r\nup to your neck, bend your elbows and bring your hands to the surface,\r\nthen keep the palms pressing down the water. The principle is the same\r\nas in swimming. When you swim you force the water back with your hands\r\nand feet and so send your body forward. When you tread water you force\r\nthe water _down_ with your hands and feet and so send your body, or keep\r\nit, up.\r\n\r\nIt is even possible to stand quite still in deep water when you learn to\r\nkeep your balance. All you do is to spread out your arms at the sides on\r\na line with your shoulders and keep your head well back. You may go\r\nbelow the surface once or twice until you learn, but you will come up\r\nagain and the feat is well worth while. What an outdoor girl should\r\nstrive for is to become thoroughly at home in the water so that she may\r\nenter it fearlessly and know what to do when she is there.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: For dinner.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Fishing=\r\n\r\nJust here would seem to be the place to talk of fishing, but I am not\r\ngoing to try to tell you how to fish; that would take a volume, there\r\nare so many kinds of fish and so many ways of fishing. One way is to cut\r\na slender pole, tie a fish-line on the small end, tie a fish-hook to the\r\nend of the line, bait it with an angleworm, stand on the bank, drop the\r\nhook and bait into the water, and await results. Another way is to put\r\ntogether a delicate, quivering fishing-rod, carefully select a "fly,"\r\nadjust it, stand on the bank, or in a boat, and "cast" the fly far out\r\non the water with a dexterous turn of the wrist. You may catch fish in\r\neither way, but in some cases the pole and angleworm is the surest.\r\n\r\nA visitor stood on the bank of our Pike County lake and skilfully sent\r\nhis fly skimming over the water while the boy of the family, catching\r\nperch with his home-cut pole and angleworms, was told to watch and\r\nlearn. He did watch politely for a while, then turned again to his own\r\naffairs. Once more some one said: "Look at Mr. J., boy, and learn to\r\ncast a fly." But the boy, placidly fishing, returned: "I\'d rather know\r\nhow to catch fish." It was true the boy had caught the fish and the\r\nskilful angler had not. All of which goes to prove that if it is fish\r\nyou want, just any kind of fish and not the excitement of the sport, a\r\npole like the boy\'s will probably be equal to all requirements. But\r\nthere are black bass in the lake, and had one of them been in that\r\nparticular part of it, no doubt the fly would have tempted him, and the\r\nexperience and skill of Mr. J. supplemented by his long, flexible rod,\r\nhis reel and landing net, would have done the rest, while the boy had\r\nlittle chance of such a bite and almost none of landing a game fish like\r\nthe bass.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The veteran.]\r\n\r\nIf you want to fish, and every girl on the trail should know how, take\r\nit up in a common-sense way and learn from an experienced person. Own a\r\ngood, serviceable rod and fishing tackle and let it be your business to\r\nknow why they are good. Make up your mind to long, patient, trying\r\nwaits, to early and late excursions, and to some disappointments. Take a\r\nfisherman\'s luck cheerfully and carry the thing through like a true\r\nsportsman. There is one thing to remember which sportsmen sometimes\r\nforget in the excitement of the game and that is _not to catch more fish\r\nthan you have use for_. One need not be cruel even to cold-blooded fish,\r\nnor need one selfishly grab all one can get merely for the sake of the\r\ngetting and without a thought for those who are to come after. We have\r\nall heard of good fishing places which have been "fished out," and that\r\ncould not be if the fishermen had taken only as many as they could use.\r\nThis rule holds good all through the wild: Take what you need, it is\r\nyours, but all the rest belongs to others.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nUSEFUL KNOTS AND HOW TO TIE THEM\r\n\r\n=Square Knots. Hitching Knots. Other Knots=\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery outdoor girl should know what knots to use for various purposes\r\nand how to tie them, but only those which will be found useful on the\r\ntrail are given here.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Terms Used in Knot-Tying=\r\n\r\nThere are three different kinds of bends that are given a rope in the\r\nprocess of tying a knot, and each bend has its own name. You must learn\r\nthese in order to understand the directions for knot-tying; they are:\r\nthe _bight_, the _loop_, and the _round turn_.\r\n\r\nThe _bight_ (Fig. 46) is made by bending the rope so that the sides are\r\nparallel. The _loop_ (Fig. 47) is made by lapping one rope of the bight\r\nacross the other. The _round turn_ (Fig. 48) is made by carrying one\r\nrope of the loop all the way around to the other side, making half of\r\nthe loop double.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Square Knot=\r\n\r\nThis is probably what you would at first call a hard knot, and so it is\r\na hard knot to come untied of itself or to slip, but it is easy to untie\r\nwhen necessary. The hard knot most people tie is not quite the same as\r\nthe square knot, though it does resemble it.\r\n\r\nThe ordinary hard knot is what is known as the _granny_ knot, a slurring\r\nname which means a failure. The granny knot will not always stay tied,\r\nit often slips and it cannot be trusted when absolute security is\r\nneeded.\r\n\r\nBegin the _square knot_ with the single first tie (Fig. 49). You see the\r\nend _X_ turns up _over_ the other rope while the end _O_ laps _under_\r\nthe rope. Now bring the two ends together, lapping _X over O_ (Fig. 50).\r\nThen pass _X_ back under _O_, making the single tie once more. Now\r\ncompare what you have done with Fig. 51. Notice in the drawing that the\r\nends of rope _X_ are _both over_ the right-hand bight, and the ends of\r\nrope _O_ are _both under_ the left-hand bight. Draw the square knot\r\ntight and it looks like Fig. 52.\r\n\r\nYou cannot make a mistake in tying the square knot if you remember to\r\nnotice which end is on top, or laps _over_ the other rope when the first\r\nsingle tie is made (Fig. 49), and then be sure to lap this _same end\r\nover_ the other end in making the second tie which finishes the knot.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Figure-Eight Knot=\r\n\r\nUse the figure-eight knot to make a knot on the end of a rope or to\r\nprevent the end of the strands from untwisting. Form a loop like Fig. 53\r\nnear the end of the rope, bringing the short end over the long rope;\r\nthen pass the short end under the long rope once, as shown by dotted\r\nline, and carry it up over and through the loop (Fig. 54). Pull it up\r\ntightly to bring the end square across the rope (Fig. 55). This knot is\r\nnot difficult to untie.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 46 Bight.\r\n\r\n47 Loop.\r\n\r\n48 Round turn.\r\n\r\nBENDS IN KNOT TYING\r\n\r\n49 SQUARE KNOT 50\r\n\r\n51 52]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Bow-Line Knot=\r\n\r\nTo form a loop that will not slip and yet may be easily untied use the\r\nbow-line knot.\r\n\r\n(1) When the loop is not fastened to anything use the _overhand method_\r\nof tying it. First measure off sufficient rope for the loop you wish\r\nto make and hold the place with your left hand (this place is indicated\r\nby the arrow in Fig. 56); then with your right hand throw the short end\r\nof the rope over the long rope (Fig. 56). Still holding the short end\r\nwith your right hand, with the left hand bring the long rope up to form\r\na loop over the end (Fig. 57). Now with your right hand take up the end,\r\ndraw it farther through the loop, and pass it behind the long rope above\r\nthe loop, from right to left (Fig. 58). Bring the end forward again and\r\nslip it downward through the loop (Fig. 59). Draw the knot tight and it\r\ncannot slip, no matter how great the strain.\r\n\r\n(2) Use the _underhand method_ when the loop is passed _around_\r\nsomething or _through_ a ring. This loop may be put around the neck of a\r\nhorse or cow without danger of injury, for it will not slip and tighten.\r\nIt can also be used in place of the hitching tie.\r\n\r\nSlip the rope through the ring, or around the object, from left to right\r\nwhile you hold the long rope in your left hand. Take a half-hitch around\r\nthe long rope, passing the end _over_ the long rope, then under it. This\r\nmakes a loop like Fig. 60. Transfer this loop from the short rope to the\r\nlong rope by holding loosely, or giving slack, with the left hand and\r\npulling up with the right. A little practise will enable you to do this\r\neasily. Fig. 61 shows the loop transferred to the long rope with the\r\nshort end passing through it. At this stage carry the short end over,\r\nthen under the long rope _below_ the loop (Fig. 62), then up and through\r\nthe loop as in Fig. 63. Tighten the knot by pulling on both the long\r\nrope and the short end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 53 54 55\r\n\r\nFIGURE EIGHT KNOT\r\n\r\n56 57 58\r\n\r\nOVERHAND BOWLINE KNOT\r\n\r\n59]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sheep-Shank Knot=\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes necessary to shorten a rope temporarily and not\r\ndesirable to cut it, and the sheep-shank knot solves the problem. It\r\nis used by the sailors, who do not believe in cutting ropes. It will\r\nstand a tremendous strain without slipping, but will loosen when held\r\nslack, and can be untied by a quick jerk of the two outside ropes\r\nforming the bights.\r\n\r\nBegin by bending the rope to form two bights as in _A_, Fig. 64, carry\r\nthe single rope over at the top of the bend, then under to form a\r\nhalf-hitch as in _B_. Do the same with the other single rope at the\r\nbottom of the bend _C_, and draw both ends tight (_D_). With a little\r\npractise this can be done very quickly. If the rope is to be permanently\r\nshortened pass the ends through the first and second bights at the bend\r\nas in _E_, and the knot will hold for any length of time.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Parcel Slip-Knot=\r\n\r\nThis is the simplest of all knots to start with in tying up a parcel.\r\nBegin by making a knot about one inch from the end of your twine, using\r\nthe single tie like _F_ (Fig. 65). If this does not make the knot large\r\nenough use the figure-eight knot. The single tie is sufficient in\r\nordinary cases. Wrap your twine once around your parcel, lapping the\r\nlong twine over the knotted end as in _G_. Bring the knotted end over\r\nthe long twine, forming a bight, then _over_ and _under_ its own twine\r\nwith the single tie (_H_). Draw the tie up close to the knot at the end;\r\nthe knot prevents it from slipping off. Now the long twine may be drawn\r\ntight or loosened at will, and will hold the first wrap in place while\r\nthe twine is being wrapped around the package in a different place.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 60 61 62 63\r\n\r\nUNDERHAND BOWLINE KNOT\r\n\r\nA B C\r\n\r\nFIG 64 SHEEPSHANK KNOT\r\n\r\nD E]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cross-Tie Parcel Knot=\r\n\r\nWhen you have two or more parallel twines on your parcel and have begun\r\nto bring down the cross-line, secure it to each twine in this way: Bring\r\nthe long twine down and loop it under the first twine to form a bight\r\nas in _I_ (Fig. 66).\r\n\r\nThen carry the long twine over, itself forming a loop (_J_), then under\r\nthe first twine as in _K_.\r\n\r\nDraw tight and proceed to the second twine, making the same cross-tie.\r\n\r\nWhen you have carried your cross-line entirely around the parcel, tie it\r\nsecurely to the first twine where it began and finish with a single-tie\r\nknot, making a knot on the last end of the twine close to the fastening,\r\nto keep the end from slipping through.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Fisherman\'s Knot=\r\n\r\nThe fisherman\'s knot is used by fishermen to tie silkworm gut together.\r\nIt is easily untied by pulling the two short ends, but it never slips.\r\nLay the two ropes side by side (_L_, Fig. 67), then make a loop around\r\none rope with the other rope, passing the end under both ropes (_M_).\r\nBring the end over and into the loop to make a single tie (_N_). Tie the\r\nend of the second rope around the first rope in the same manner (_N_)\r\nand draw both knots tight (_O_).\r\n\r\n\r\n=Halter, Slip, or Running Knot=\r\n\r\nThe halter or slip knot is often convenient, but should never be used\r\naround the neck of an animal, for if either end is pulled it will slip\r\nand tighten, thereby strangling the creature.\r\n\r\nFirst form a bight, then with one end of the rope make a single tie\r\naround the other rope (Fig. 68).\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: F G H\r\n\r\nFIG 65 PARCEL SLIP KNOT\r\n\r\nI J K\r\n\r\nFIG 66 CROSS-TIE PARCEL KNOT\r\n\r\nL M N O\r\n\r\nFIG 67 FISHERMAN\'S KNOT]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Half-Hitch=\r\n\r\nIf you have anything to do with horses or boats you must know how to\r\nmake the proper ties for hitching the horse to a post, or a boat to a\r\ntree, stump, or anything else that is handy.\r\n\r\nThe half-hitch is a loop around a rope with the short end secured under\r\nthe loop (Fig. 69). This answers for a temporary, but not a secure,\r\nfastening.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Timber-Hitch=\r\n\r\nWhen you want a temporary fastening, secure yet easily undone, make a\r\n_timber-hitch_ (Fig. 70). Pass the rope around an object, take a\r\nhalf-hitch around the rope, and pass the short end once more between the\r\nrope and the object.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Hitching Tie=\r\n\r\nIf the hitching tie is properly made, and the knot turned to the _right_\r\nof the post, the stronger the pull on the long end of the rope, the\r\ntighter the hold, and the loop will not slip down even on a smooth,\r\nplain post. If the knot is turned to the left, or is directly in front,\r\nthe loop will not pull tight and will slide down. For the reason that\r\nthe loop will tighten, the _hitching tie_ should never be used around\r\nthe neck of a horse, as it might pull tight and the animal be strangled.\r\n\r\nIn making the hitching tie, first pass the rope from left to right\r\naround the post, tree, or stump; bring it together and hold in the left\r\nhand. The left hand is represented by the arrow (Fig. 71). With the\r\nright hand throw the short end of the rope across the ropes in front of\r\nthe left hand, forming a loop below the left hand (Fig. 72). Slip the\r\nright hand through this loop, grasp the rope just in front, and pull it\r\nback to form a bight, as you make a chain-stitch in crocheting (Fig.\r\n73). Down through this last bight pass the end of the rope and pull the\r\nknot tight (Fig. 74).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 68\r\n\r\n68 69 70\r\n\r\n71 72 73 74\r\n\r\nThe halter, slip-knot, and hitching-tie.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nACCIDENTS\r\n\r\n=Sprains. Bruises. Burns. Cuts. Sunstroke. Drowning=\r\n\r\n\r\nOne learns quickly how to take care of oneself while on the trail, and\r\nserious accidents seldom occur. In fact, every member of the party takes\r\npride in keeping herself free from accident; it is so like a tenderfoot\r\nto get hurt. However, it is well to be prepared in case accidents do\r\noccur, and this chapter is intended to forearm you that you may not\r\nstand helplessly by when your aid is needed.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Sprains and Bruises=\r\n\r\nThe best immediate treatment for ordinary sprains and bruises is the\r\napplication of _cloths dipped in very hot water_. This takes out the\r\nsoreness and prevents inflammation. As soon as one application cools a\r\nlittle, a hot one should take its place, as hot as can be borne without\r\nscalding the flesh. Very cold water can be used when hot is not\r\nobtainable. For a sprained ankle or wrist continue this treatment for a\r\nwhile and then bind smoothly and firmly with a clean cotton bandage.\r\nKeep as quiet as possible with a sprained ankle, and if the accident\r\noccurs when on a walk the fireman\'s lift may be used for carrying the\r\ninjured person to camp.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The fireman\'s lift.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Fireman\'s Lift=\r\n\r\nTo be able to use the fireman\'s lift may be to save a life, as it can be\r\nemployed when there is but one person to do the carrying. With\r\npractise any girl of ordinary strength can lift and carry another of her\r\nown size or even larger.\r\n\r\nIn order to make the lift easy, instruct the patient to relax all her\r\nmuscles and become perfectly limp; then turn her on her face, stand over\r\nher body with one foot at each side, face toward the patient\'s head.\r\nLean forward and place your hands under her arms, then gently raise her\r\nto her knees, next slide your hands quickly down around her body at the\r\nlow waist-line, lifting her at the same time to her feet. Immediately\r\ngrasp her right wrist with your left hand, and pass your head under her\r\nright arm and your right arm under one or both of her knees, shifting\r\nthe patient\'s hips well on your shoulders, rise to a standing position\r\nand carry patient away.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cuts=\r\n\r\nThe accidents that most frequently happen are simple cuts and bruises.\r\n\r\nFor a slight cut wash the wound in lukewarm water to remove all dirt or\r\nforeign matter, then press the lips or sides together and hold them in\r\nplace with strips of court-plaster or surgeon\'s adhesive plaster. Do not\r\ncover the entire wound with the plaster, but put strips across at right\r\nangles with the cut, leaving a space between every two strips and using\r\nonly enough plaster to keep the cut closed. Cover the hurt part with a\r\nbandage to protect it from further injury.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The tourniquet.\r\n\r\nBlanket stretcher.\r\n\r\nAids in "first aid."]\r\n\r\n\r\n=When an Artery is Cut=\r\n\r\nWhen an artery is cut the wound is more serious and the bleeding must be\r\nstopped _immediately_. When the blood comes from an artery it is bright\r\nred in color and flows copiously in spurts or jets. The blood in the\r\narteries is flowing away from the heart, therefore you must stop it\r\nbetween the cut and the heart. It is the arteries in the arms and legs\r\nthat are most likely to be injured. In the arm the large artery runs\r\ndown the inner side of the upper arm. In the leg the artery runs down\r\nthe inner side of the upper leg.\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Tourniquet=\r\n\r\nTo stop the bleeding press the artery _above_ the wound firmly with your\r\nfingers while some one prepares a tourniquet. Use a handkerchief, a\r\nnecktie, or anything of the kind for a tourniquet; tie it loosely around\r\nthe limb and in the bandage place a smooth stone (or something that will\r\ntake its place), adjusting it just above your fingers on the artery.\r\nThen slip a strong, slender stick about ten inches long under the\r\nbandage at the outer side of the arm or leg and turn the stick around\r\nlike the hand of a clock, until the stone presses the artery just as\r\nyour fingers did. Tie the stick above and below the bandage to keep it\r\nfrom untwisting.\r\n\r\n_Do not forget_ that the tourniquet is cutting off circulation, and for\r\nthis to continue very long is dangerous. It is not safe to keep it on\r\nmore than one hour without loosening. If the hand or foot grows cold and\r\nnumb before that time loosen the tourniquet and rub briskly to restore\r\ncirculation. Should the wound begin to bleed again when the tourniquet\r\nis loosened, be ready to tighten at once.\r\n\r\nIn case of an accident of this kind summon a physician, if one can be\r\nreached quickly. If not, take the patient to the nearest doctor, for the\r\nartery must be tied as soon as possible and only a physician or skilful\r\ntrained nurse can do that part of the work.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Emergency Stretchers=\r\n\r\nLoss of blood is too weakening to permit of the patient walking, and the\r\nexertion may start the wound bleeding again, so a stretcher of some kind\r\nmust be contrived in which she may be carried. You can make a good\r\nemergency stretcher of two strong poles of _green_ wood, one large\r\nblanket, and the ever-useful horse-blanket safety-pins. The poles should\r\nbe about six feet long, of a size to clasp easily in your hand, and as\r\nsmooth as they can be made with hurried work. They should, at least, be\r\nfree from jagged stumps or branches and twigs.\r\n\r\nBegin by folding the blanket through the middle _over_ one of the poles,\r\nthen pin the blanket together with the large safety-pins, with the pins\r\nabout six inches apart, to hold the pole in place. That finishes one\r\nside; for the other, lap the two edges of the blanket over the second\r\npole and pin them down like a hem. The stretcher will be of double\r\nthickness and will hold the injured person comfortably.\r\n\r\nIf a serious accident should occur some distance from camp and there are\r\nno blankets to use, do not hesitate to appropriate for a stretcher\r\nwhatever you have with you. When there is nothing else cut your khaki\r\nskirt into strips about twelve inches wide and tie the ends to two poles\r\n(the poles need not be smooth except at the ends), leaving spaces\r\nbetween.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Burns and Scalds=\r\n\r\nPersonally I have repudiated the old method of treating simple burns and\r\nscalds and, instead of applying oil or flour, have discovered for myself\r\nthat simply holding a slightly burned finger or hand in a running stream\r\nof cold water not only gives instant relief but prevents the pain from\r\nreturning in any severity. Care of the injured part to prevent the skin\r\nfrom breaking and causing a sore is the only thing left to be done.\r\nHowever, here are the ordinary remedies for burns. Any of the following\r\nthings spread over a piece of linen or soft cotton cloth are said to be\r\ngood: olive-oil, carbolized vaseline, fresh lard, cream, flour, and\r\nbaking-soda. For serious burns a physician should be called.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Heat Prostration and Sunstroke=\r\n\r\nThis will seldom occur in a camp of healthy girls whose stomachs and\r\nblood are in good order, but it is best not to expose oneself to the\r\nfierce rays of the sun during a period of intense heat, or directly\r\nafter eating. In case any one is overcome and complains of feeling\r\nfaint, and of dizziness and throbbing head, take her where it is cool,\r\nin the shade if possible, lay her down, loosen her clothing, and apply\r\ncold water to her face and head. She will probably be able to walk when\r\nshe revives, but if not, carry her home or into camp. _Do not give\r\nwhiskey, brandy, or any stimulants._\r\n\r\n\r\n=Cinder or Foreign Substance in the Eye=\r\n\r\nAs a rule all that is necessary to remove "something" in your eye is to\r\ntake the eyelashes of the upper lid between your thumb and forefinger\r\nand pull the lid down over the lower one. The lower lashes thus shut in,\r\ncombined with the tears that flood the eye, will clean the eye in most\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nIf the cinder or other substance is embedded in the upper lid, roll back\r\nthe lid over a match (the sulphur end taken off), then moisten a corner\r\nof a handkerchief and with it remove the cinder. If this treatment does\r\nnot avail and the substance cannot be removed, put a drop of olive-oil\r\nin the eye, close it and cover with a soft bandage, then go to a\r\nphysician. _Do not put anything stiff or hard into the eye._\r\n\r\n\r\n=Fainting=\r\n\r\nFainting occurs most often in overheated and over-crowded places where\r\nthe air is impure. The proper treatment is to lay the patient flat on\r\nher back with the head lower than the rest of the body and feet raised;\r\nthen loosen the clothes at waist and neck, sprinkle the face and neck\r\nwith cold water, and hold smelling salts or ammonia to the nostrils.\r\nInsist upon giving her all the fresh air possible. It is good also to\r\nrub the limbs with the motion upward toward the body.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Drowning--Shafer Method=\r\n\r\nSecure a doctor if possible, but do not wait for him. Do not _wait_ for\r\nanything; what you do, do _instantly_.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the rescued person is out of the water begin treatment to\r\nrestore respiration, that is, to make her _breathe_. If you can do this\r\nher life will probably be saved. Not until the patient breathes\r\nnaturally must you work to bring warmth and circulation to the body. To\r\npromote circulation _before_ the patient _breathes naturally_ may\r\nendanger her life.\r\n\r\nFirst quickly loosen the clothes at waist and neck; then turn the\r\npatient face downward on the ground with face either downward or turned\r\nto one side, arms extended above the head, and with chest raised\r\nslightly from the ground and resting upon your folded skirt. Also place\r\nsomething beneath her forehead to raise her nose and mouth from the\r\nground. This will allow the tongue to fall forward. If it does not,\r\ngrasp it with handkerchief and pull forward; this will permit the water\r\nto run out and will provide room for breathing.\r\n\r\nAs in cases of fainting, so with drowning patient, she must have all the\r\nair possible, for she is being suffocated with water, so do not allow a\r\ncrowd to form around her. Keep every one back except those assisting in\r\nthe actual work of restoration.\r\n\r\nWith the patient in the position described, kneel by her side or, better\r\nstill, astride of her, and let your hands fall into the spaces between\r\nthe short ribs. With your fingers turned outward and your weight falling\r\nupon the palms of your hands, press steadily downward and forward to\r\nexpel the air from the lungs. Hold this position a fraction of a second,\r\ncount four, then gradually release the pressure to allow the air to\r\nenter again through the throat. Count four, and again press down.\r\nContinue this treatment for a while, then, using another method, slip\r\nyour hands under the patient at the waist-line and lift her up\r\nsufficiently to allow her head to hang down as in illustration.\r\n\r\nLower her gently and lift again. Do this several times. You will find\r\nthat the movement will force the water from the lungs out of the mouth\r\nand help to produce artificial respiration.\r\n\r\nReturn to the first method and continue the treatment until the breath\r\ncomes naturally. It may be an hour or two before there are any signs of\r\nlife such as a gasp or slight movement, then the breath must be\r\ncarefully aided by more gentle pressure until it comes easily without\r\nhelp.\r\n\r\nDo not give up hope, and _do not stop working_. The work may be\r\ncontinued many hours if done in relays, that is, several girls taking\r\npart, each one in her turn. Remember, however, the treatment must be\r\ncontinuous and no time be allowed to elapse when the change is being\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Restoring respiration.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=After Respiration Begins=\r\n\r\nWith returning breath the first corner in recovery has been turned, but\r\nthe after treatment is very important. To restore circulation, begin by\r\nrubbing the limbs _upward_ with a firm pressure. This sends the blood to\r\nthe heart. Warmth must now be supplied by blankets heated before a fire,\r\nand hot stones or bricks may be placed at the thighs and at the soles of\r\nthe feet. Or the patient should be wrapped in a warm blanket, placed on\r\na stretcher, carried to camp, or to a house, and put to bed. Here\r\nhot-water bottles may be used, and as soon as it is possible for her to\r\nswallow, if nothing else can be obtained, give a little strong, hot\r\ncoffee, unsweetened and without milk. Lastly, keep the patient quiet and\r\nlet her sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Nosebleed=\r\n\r\nThe simplest method of stopping the nosebleed is to hold something\r\n_cold_ on the back of the neck (a large key will do) and pinch the\r\nnostrils together; also cool the forehead with water and hold the arms\r\nabove the head. This is usually effective.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nCAMP FUN AND FROLICS\r\n\r\n=Active Sports and Games. Evenings in Camp. Around the Camp-Fire. Quiet\r\nGames, Songs, and Stories. Lighting Fires Without a Match=\r\n\r\n\r\nCamp fun should have a place, and an important one, in your plans for\r\nthe trail. For the time being the camp is your home and it should never\r\nbe allowed to become dull for want of a little gayety and wholesome\r\namusement. In a permanent camp there will be days when the entire party\r\nwill be loafing and then is the time to start a frolic of some kind.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Obstacle Races=\r\n\r\nCompetitive sports are always entertaining, and races, of one kind or\r\nanother, are the most exciting. The Boy Scouts have a race in which the\r\ncompetitors drop first their staffs, then their hats, their neckties,\r\nleggins, and, finally struggling out of the blouse of their uniform,\r\nthey drop that also. All this must be done while on the way and before\r\nthey cross a given line. At the line they turn to go back over the\r\ncourse and, while running, take up their various belongings and put them\r\non before they reach the home goal.\r\n\r\nA race planned on these lines will be most amusing. A smooth course is\r\nnot necessary, you probably won\'t have it at camp, and to get over the\r\nuneven ground, with the detentions of first dropping, then picking up\r\nthe articles dropped, will add to the excitement of the sport. An\r\nentertaining variation of this will be to have those taking part in the\r\nrace appear in impromptu costumes (worn over the ordinary dress) which\r\nthey must remove piece by piece as they run and put the things all on\r\nagain while returning over the course. Such hastily adjusted costumes\r\ncannot help but be funny.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Medals=\r\n\r\nThe winner of the race should be given a medal as a prize. The medal can\r\nbe made of any handy material. A tin circular disk cut from the top of a\r\ntin can will do. Drive a nail through this tin medal near the edge and\r\npass a string through the hole so that it may be hung around the neck of\r\nthe winner. Or instead of giving a medal, the victor may be crowned,\r\nlike the ancient Greeks, with a wreath of leaves.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Blindfold Obstacle Walk=\r\n\r\nAnother amusing camp sport is the blindfold obstacle walk. Place six or\r\neight good-sized stones on the ground in a row, about two feet apart.\r\nThe stones should be flat on top so that you can stand a tin cup filled\r\nwith water on each stone. Let one member of the party make a trial trip\r\nover the cups, stepping between them as she passes down the row; then\r\nblindfold her, place two people as a guard, one on each side of her, to\r\nhold her hands and prevent a fall, and let them lead her to the end of\r\nthe line of cups and tell her to go over it again.\r\n\r\nThe guard will steady her in case she stumbles but must in no way guide\r\nher course aright. The stepper will step high and be absurdly careful\r\nnot to kick over one of the cups, for wet feet would probably be the\r\nresult. Sometimes the stepper will leave the line of her own accord;\r\nsometimes her guard will purposely, and without her knowing it, lead\r\nher off the course and then her careful, high steps over nothing add to\r\nthe fun of the onlookers.\r\n\r\nAny number may take part in the sport, and in turn act as stepper. At\r\nthe end a prize should be given by vote to the one who afforded the\r\ngreatest amusement.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Hunting the Quail=\r\n\r\nThis is something like the old game of hide-and-seek, with which all\r\ngirls are familiar, and it will not be difficult to learn. The players\r\nare divided into "hunter" and "quails." The hunter is "It," and any\r\ncounting-out rhyme will decide who is to take that part. When the\r\nhunter, with closed eyes, has counted her hundred, and the quails have\r\nscurried away to their hiding-places behind trees, bushes, or rocks, the\r\nhunt begins, and at the same time begins the cry of the quails:\r\n"Bob-White! Bob-White! Bob-White!" These calls, coming from every\r\ndirection, are very bewildering, and the hunter must be alert to detect\r\nthe direction of one particular sound and quick to see the flight of a\r\nquail and catch her before she can reach the home goal and find shelter\r\nthere. The first quail caught becomes hunter in her turn, and the noisy,\r\nrollicking game continues as long as the players wish. Another romping\r\ngame is called\r\n\r\n\r\n=Trotting-Horse=\r\n\r\nIt is warranted to put in circulation even the most sluggish blood and\r\nto warm the coldest feet, and it is fine for the almost frosty weather\r\nwe sometimes have in the mountains.\r\n\r\nThe players form a circle in marching order; that is, each girl faces\r\nthe back of another, with a space between every two players.\r\nTrotting-horse, the "It" of the game, stands in the centre of the\r\ncircle. When she gives the signal, the players forming the circle begin\r\nto run round and round, keeping the circle intact, while trotting-horse,\r\nalways trotting, tries to slip between the ranks, which close up to\r\nprevent her escape. Trotting-horse must trot, not run. If she runs when\r\nmaking her escape she must go back into the ring and try once more to\r\nbreak away. When she succeeds fairly in getting through the ranks the\r\nplayer in front of whom she slips becomes "It" and takes the place of\r\ntrotting-horse.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Wood Tennis=\r\n\r\nWood tennis is of the woods, woodsy. Green pine-cones take the place of\r\nballs; hands, of rackets; and branches, of tennis-net. Lay out a regular\r\ntennis-court by scraping the lines in the earth, or outlining the\r\nboundaries with sticks or other convenient materials. Build a net of\r\nbranches by sticking the ends in the ground, and collect a number of\r\nsmooth, green cones for balls.\r\n\r\nWood tennis must, of necessity, differ somewhat from the regulation\r\ngame. Since pine-cones will not bounce and there are no rackets for\r\nstriking them, they must be tossed across the net, caught in the hands,\r\nand quickly tossed back. In other respects the rules of the established\r\ngame may be used entire or simplified if desired.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WHEN DARKNESS CLOSES IN]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Around the Camp-Fire=\r\n\r\nWhen darkness creeps through the woods, closing in closer and closer;\r\nwhen it blots out, one by one, the familiar landmarks and isolates the\r\nlittle camp in a sea of night, with the mutual wish for nearer\r\ncompanionship, we gather around the camp-fire, the one light in all the\r\ngreat darkness. We are grateful for its warmth, as the evenings are\r\nchill, and its cheery blaze and crackle bring a feeling of hominess\r\nand comfort welcome to every one. If there are men in the party they\r\nlight their pipes and then begin the stories of past experiences on the\r\ntrail, which are of the keenest interest to all campers. These stories,\r\ntold while one gazes dreamily into the glowing coals of the fire or\r\nlooks beyond the light into the mysterious blackness of the forest, have\r\na charm that is wanting under different surroundings. The stories are\r\nnot confined to the men, for in these days when girls and women are also\r\non the trail, they too can relate things worth the telling.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Songs=\r\n\r\nThen come the songs. If there is some one in the party who can lead in\r\nsinging, she can use a familiar air with a rousing chorus as a frame\r\nupon which to hang impromptu verses, made up of personalities and local\r\nhits. This is always fun and you are surprised how quickly doggerel\r\nrhymes suggest themselves when your turn comes to furnish a verse to the\r\nsong.\r\n\r\nThe leader begins something like this, using, perhaps, the air and\r\nrefrain of an old chantey or college song.\r\n\r\n                  _Leader_\r\n           "I spotted a beaver,\r\n            But he wasn\'t very nye."\r\n\r\n                  _Chorus_\r\n           "Don\'t you rock so hard!"\r\n\r\n               _Second Soloist_\r\n           "His fur was all ragged\r\n            And he had but one eye."\r\n\r\n                  _Chorus_\r\n           "Don\'t you rock so hard.\r\n          Oh! You rock and I rock, and\r\n            Don\'t you rock so hard!\r\n          Everybody rocks when I rock, and\r\n            Don\'t you rock so hard."\r\n\r\n                  _Third Soloist_\r\n           "You may laugh at the beaver,\r\n            But he\'s always up to time."\r\n\r\n                  _Chorus_\r\n           "Don\'t you rock so hard!"\r\n\r\n              _Fourth Soloist_\r\n           "Oh, do drop the beaver,\r\n            And start a new rhyme."\r\n\r\n              _Chorus as before_\r\n\r\nA song like this may go on indefinitely or until the rhyming powers of\r\nthe party are exhausted.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Bird-Call Match=\r\n\r\nIn a camp where the members are all familiar with the calls of the\r\nvarious wild birds, a bird-call match makes a charming game when the\r\nparty is gathered around the camp-fire. The leader begins by whistling\r\nor singing the call of a wild bird; if it can be put into words so much\r\nthe better. For instance, we will take the first few notes of the\r\nwood-thrush, which F. Schuyler Mathews has put into notes and words as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Music: Come to me, I am here.\r\n\r\nWood-thrush.]\r\n\r\nOr the yellow-throated vireo, which he gives in this way:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Music: See me! I\'m here, Where are you?\r\n\r\nYellow vireo.]\r\n\r\nIf the leader is correct the next player gives the call of another bird.\r\nWhen a player gives a bird call which is known to be incorrect--that is,\r\nabsolutely wrong--and some one else can supply the proper rendering, the\r\nfirst player is dropped from the game just as a person is dropped out of\r\na spelling-match when she misspells a word. If there is no one who can\r\ngive the call correctly, she retains her place. This is excellent\r\ntraining in woodcraft as well as a fascinating game. Your ears will be\r\nquickened to hear and to identify the bird calls by playing it; and\r\nstoring bird notes in your memory for use in the next bird-call match\r\nwill become a habit.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Vary the Game=\r\n\r\nYou can vary this game by giving the calls of wild animals and the\r\ncharacteristic noises they make when frightened or angry.\r\n\r\nLiving even for a short time in the wild will develop unsuspected\r\nfaculties and qualities in your make-up, and to perfect yourself in\r\nknowledge of the woods and its inhabitants will seem of the utmost\r\nimportance. While learning the cries of birds and animals in sport, you\r\nwill wish to retain them in earnest, and to enter the wilderness\r\nequipped with some knowledge of its languages, will open vistas to you\r\nthat the more ignorant cannot penetrate.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Lighting the Fire Without a Match=\r\n\r\nA fire-lighting contest is the best of camp sports, for it requires\r\npractise and skill, and to excel in it is to acquire distinction among\r\nall outdoor people. There are girls in the Girl Pioneers Organization\r\nwho are as proficient in lighting a fire without matches as any of the\r\nBoy Scouts who make much of the feat.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Bow-and-Drill Method=\r\n\r\nThe bow-and-drill method is the most popular among girls and boys alike,\r\nand for this, as for all other ways of lighting a fire, you must have\r\nthe proper appliances and will probably have to make them yourself.\r\n\r\nUnlike the bow used for archery, the fire-bow is not to be bent by the\r\nbow-string but must have a permanent curve. Choose a piece of sapling\r\nabout eighteen or twenty inches long which curves evenly; cut a notch\r\naround it at each end and at the notched places attach a string of\r\nrawhide of the kind used as shoe-strings in hunting-shoes. Tie the\r\nbow-string to the bow in the manner shown in Fig. 75, and allow it to\r\nhang loosely. It must _not_ be taut as for archery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAKE THE BOW-STRING SLACK\r\n\r\n77\r\n\r\n75\r\n\r\n76\r\n\r\nFire without matches.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTo the bow must be added the twirling-stick and fireboard (Fig. 76).\r\nMake these of spruce. The twirling-stick, spindle, or fire-drill should\r\nbe a little over half an inch in diameter and sixteen inches long. Its\r\nsides may be rounded or bevelled in six or seven flat spaces like a\r\nlead-pencil, as shown in Fig. 76. Cut the top end to a blunt point and\r\nsharpen the bottom end as you would a lead-pencil, leaving the lead\r\nblunt. To hold the spindle you must have something to protect your hand.\r\nA piece of soapstone or a piece of very hard wood will answer. This is\r\ncalled the socket-block. In the wood or stone make a hole for a socket\r\nthat will hold the top end of the spindle (Fig. 76).\r\n\r\nThe flat piece of spruce for your fireboard should be about two feet\r\nlong and a little less than one inch thick. Cut a number of triangular\r\nnotches in one edge of the board as in Fig. 76. Make the outer end of\r\neach notch about half an inch wide, and at the inner end make a small,\r\ncup-like hole large enough to hold the lower end of the twirling-stick.\r\nThis is called the fire pit. The reason you are to have so many notches\r\nis because when one hole becomes too much enlarged by the drilling of\r\nthe twirling-stick, or is bored all the way through, it is discarded and\r\nthere must be others ready and prepared for immediate use.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Tinder=\r\n\r\nAll is now ready for creating a spark, but that spark cannot live alone,\r\nit must have something it can ignite before there will be a flame. What\r\nis wanted is tinder, and tinder can be made of various materials, all of\r\nwhich must be _absolutely dry_. Here is one receipt for making tinder\r\ngiven by Daniel C. Beard: "The tinder is composed of baked and blackened\r\ncotton and linen rags. The best way to prepare these rags is to bake\r\nthem until they are dry as dust, then place them on the hearth and touch\r\na match to them. As soon as they burst into flame, smother the flame\r\nwith a folded newspaper, then carefully put your punk (baked and charred\r\nrags) into a tin tobacco box or some other receptacle where it will keep\r\ndry and be ready for use."\r\n\r\nThis can be prepared at home. In the woods gather some of the dry inner\r\nbark of the cedar, the fine, stringy edges of white or yellow birch, and\r\ndry grasses, and dry them thoroughly at the camp-fire.\r\n\r\nMr. Beard also says: "You can prepare tinder from dry, inflammable woods\r\nor barks by grinding or pounding them between two flat stones. If you\r\ngrind up some charcoal (taken from your camp-fire) very fine to mix with\r\nit, this will make it all the more inflammable. A good, safe method to\r\nget a flame from your fine tinder is to wrap up a small amount of it in\r\nthe shredded bark of birch or cedar, so that you may hold it in your\r\nhand until it ignites from the embers produced by the saw."\r\n\r\nWith all your material at hand for starting a fire, make one turn around\r\nthe spindle, with the bow-string, as in Fig. 76. Place the point of the\r\nlower end of the spindle in the small hole or "fire pit" at the inside\r\nend of a notch in the fireboard, fit the socket-block on the top end of\r\nthe spindle (Fig. 76), and hold it in place with one hand, as shown in\r\nFig. 77. Grasp one end of the bow with the other hand and saw it back\r\nand forth. This will whirl the spindle rapidly and cause the friction\r\nwhich makes the heat that produces the spark. When it begins to smoke,\r\nfan it with your hand and light your tinder from the sparks.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Without the Bow=\r\n\r\nFig. 78 shows a method which is the same as Fig. 77, the only difference\r\nbeing that the bow is dispensed with, the hands alone being used for\r\ntwirling the spindle. While simpler, it is very difficult to put\r\nsufficient force and speed into the work to produce fire, and it is a\r\nvery tiresome process. Another way is shown in Fig. 79. It will take two\r\ngirls to work in this fashion. The spindle is whirled by pulling the\r\nleather shoe-string back and forth. One girl holds the spindle and\r\nsteadies the fireboard while the other does the twirling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RUBBING STICK\r\n\r\n80\r\n\r\nTHE PLOW\r\n\r\n78 79\r\n\r\n81\r\n\r\nSLIT BAMBOO\r\n\r\nSAW\r\n\r\nFire without the bow.]\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Plough=\r\n\r\nIt is more difficult to produce fire by the plough method than with the\r\nbow, but it can be done. The appliances are simple enough. All you need\r\nis a fireboard in which a groove or gutter has been cut, and a\r\nrubbing-stick to push up and down the gutter (Fig. 80).\r\n\r\nOther woods than spruce are used with success for fire-drills and\r\nfireboards, but all must be dry. These are soft maple, cedar, balsam,\r\ntamarack, cottonwood root, and _white_, not pitch, pine.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Bamboo Fire-Saw=\r\n\r\nPart of an old bamboo fishing-rod will supply material for the fire-saw.\r\nCut off a piece of bamboo about fifteen inches long, split it, and\r\nsharpen the edge of one piece to a knife-like thinness. Lay the other\r\nhalf down with the curved surface up and cut a slit in it through which\r\nthe sharp edge of the saw can be passed. One or two girls can work this.\r\nWhen there are two, one girl holds the slit bamboo down firmly, while\r\nthe other does the sawing (Fig. 81).\r\n\r\nPut a little wad of tinder on a dry leaf and arrange it where the\r\npowdered sawdust will fall on it. When the powder becomes sufficiently\r\nhot there will be sparks and these, falling into the tinder, can be\r\nfanned into a flame by waving your hand over it. You will not see the\r\nspark but when smoke arises you will know that it is there. Fan gently,\r\nelse you will blow the fire out, and keep on fanning until your flame is\r\nstarted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nHAPPY AND SANE SUNDAY IN CAMP\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is a good idea to carefully plan for your Sundays in camp, have every\r\nhour mapped out and never allow the time to drag. Make special effort\r\nand determine that the day shall be the very happiest day of each week,\r\na day in which every one of the campers will be especially interested\r\nand will look forward to with genuine pleasure.\r\n\r\nSit down quietly and think it all out. You will want the day to differ\r\nfrom week-days; you will want it filled with the real life, not\r\nhalf-life, the life only of the physical and mental, but the true,\r\nentire life for each camper; you will want to emphasize this higher,\r\ninner life, which is the spiritual.\r\n\r\nTo this end, when you arise in the morning, form the resolution that the\r\nday shall be a peaceful, enjoyable one for all the girls. When you take\r\nyour morning plunge resolve that not only will you be physically clean,\r\nbut you will also be both mentally and spiritually clean; then all\r\nthrough the day keep in mind that you _can_ rule your thoughts and that\r\nyou _will_, for power to do this will be given to you from the source of\r\nall power. Allow not one thought to remain which is not kind, friendly,\r\ncheerful, and peaceful. Should other thoughts intrude be firm and severe\r\nwith them, have no mercy on them, talk to those thoughts as you would to\r\nrobbers and thieves, tell them to go, _go_, GO, BEGONE, that you have\r\nnothing in common with them and you _command_ them to _go_; then\r\nimmediately busy yourself with active work, building the fire, cooking,\r\ntidying up the camp, etc.\r\n\r\nHave your Sunday breakfast especially nice, with a few flowers, vines,\r\nleaves, or grasses on the table for a Sunday centrepiece, and keep the\r\nconversation on wholesome, happy topics.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfast is over and the camp in order, with all the campers go\r\nfor a short walk to some attractive spot either by the water or inland,\r\nand when the place is reached, having previously selected certain songs\r\ncontaining cheerful, religious elements, ask the entire camp to join in\r\nthe singing. If one of the girls can sing a solo, let her do so, or it\r\nmay be that two can sing a duet; then sit quietly while one of the group\r\nreads something helpful, interesting, and beautiful, which will be\r\nverses from the Bible probably, but may be one of Emerson\'s essays, or\r\nextracts from other thoughtful and helpful writers.\r\n\r\nClose the simple exercises with another hymn and return to camp.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the camp dinner prepare some one dish as a pleasant\r\nsurprise for the other girls. When dinner is over, the dishes washed,\r\nand camp again in order, the girls should have one hour of quiet, to\r\nread, write letters, sketch, or lie down and rest. Each camper should\r\nrespect the demands of the hour for quiet and rest and _not talk_, but\r\nleave her companions to their own thoughts and occupations. If you\r\nshould see your special friend seated off by herself, do not disturb her\r\nduring the rest hour; it is each girl\'s right to remain unmolested at\r\nthat time.\r\n\r\nWhen the hour is up, the campers can each pack her portion of the\r\nevening meal, and in a moment\'s time be ready to hit the trail, or take\r\nthe canoe for a paddle to the place previously selected where supper is\r\nto be enjoyed, and if the trip be on land, all may play the observation\r\ngame while on the way.\r\n\r\n\r\n=Observation Game=\r\n\r\nThe leader counts 3 to the credit of the girl who first sees a squirrel,\r\n2 for the girl who sees the second one, and 1 for every succeeding\r\nsquirrel discovered by any member of the party. A bird counts 6, if\r\nidentified 12. A wood-mouse counts 4, when identified 8. A deer 20,\r\nbeaver 12, muskrat 8, chipmunk 10, porcupine 14, eagle 30, mink 16,\r\nrabbit 1. The player holding the highest record when reaching the supper\r\ngrounds is victor. Keep your records tacked up in your shelter to\r\ncompare with those you will make on the following Sunday.\r\n\r\nIn this game every time a player stumbles on the trail 5 is taken from\r\nher credit; if she falls, she loses 10.\r\n\r\nIt is a rule of the game that the winner be congratulated by each camper\r\nin turn, that she be crowned with a wreath of leaves, grasses, or vines\r\nand sit at the head of the table. Keep this game for your Sunday\r\nafternoons and play others during the week.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, as the campers sit quietly around the camp-fire, if the\r\ncamp director will talk to the girls gently and seriously for a little\r\nwhile on some phase of their real life, the talk will be welcome and\r\nappreciated; then just before retiring all should stand while singing\r\nthe good-night song.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly possible to present Sunday plans for each variety of camp\r\nand campers. The suggestions given are for helping girl campers to look\r\nupon Sunday in its true light, and to aid them in working out plans in\r\naccordance with the purpose of the day, that they may enjoy happy, sane\r\nSundays in camp.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTranscriber\'s Notes:\r\n\r\nObvious punctuation errors repaired.\r\n\r\nHyphen added to bow-line twice in list of illustrations to conform to\r\ntext usage.\r\n\r\nHyphen added to illustration of High-Bush Blueberry to conform to text\r\nusage.\r\n\r\nHyphen was removed from illustrations involving footprints to conform to\r\ntext.\r\n\r\nPage 27, hyphen added to fire-wood to conform to rest of text.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
