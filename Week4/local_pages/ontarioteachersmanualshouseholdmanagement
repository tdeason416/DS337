Our ideas of the purpose of\r\nschools are becoming broader, and we have decided that not only the\r\nmental nature, but all the child\'s activities and interests, should be\r\ngiven direction by means of the training given in our schools. We\r\nbelieve also that these activities and interests can be used to\r\nadvantage in assisting the mental development.\r\n\r\nHousehold Management aims to educate in this way, by directing the mind\r\nto ideas connected with the home and by training the muscles to perform\r\nhousehold duties.\r\n\r\nThough deemed essentially practical, this subject will, if rightly\r\npresented, give a mental training similar to other subjects of the\r\nCourse of Study. It should do more. While a pupil is made familiar with\r\nthe duties of home life and with the materials and appliances used in\r\nthe home, she will be unavoidably led to think of the work of the larger\r\nworld and to realize her relation to it. When such knowledge comes, and\r\na girl begins to feel that some part of the world\'s work depends on her,\r\ntrue character-building will begin.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this Manual is to assist teachers in presenting Household\r\nManagement to public and separate school classes in such a way as to\r\nattain these ends. It is hoped that it will be especially useful to\r\nthose teachers whose training in the subject has been limited.\r\n\r\nAn attempt has been made to explain the work of Form III Senior, and of\r\nthe Junior and Senior divisions of Form IV. The topics of Form II Junior\r\nare not discussed, as the work of this Form is intended to be taught as\r\ninformation lessons, for which general methods will suffice. In the\r\nother Forms mentioned, the topics of lessons are outlined in detail, but\r\nthe method of presentation is not given except in typical cases. Both\r\noutline and method are intended to be merely suggestive and to leave\r\nopportunity for the teacher\'s originality.\r\n\r\nIn cases where topics seem incompletely outlined, it is due to the fact\r\nthat they are treated in other school subjects or postponed until the\r\npupils reach a more advanced stage of mental development.\r\n\r\nThe order of lessons is optional, also the amount of work each should\r\ninclude, unless this is specially stated.\r\n\r\nMany lessons are suitable for rural schools, which have no equipment\r\nexcept what the ingenuity of the teacher may provide. In such schools,\r\nthe teacher may perform the practical work, while the class observes.\r\n\r\nThroughout the lessons, there is the difficulty of presenting scientific\r\nfacts to immature minds in a way that will be simple and clear. The use\r\nof technical language would often assist the expression, and this is apt\r\nto be unconsciously employed, but there is danger of such forms of\r\nspeech not being intelligible to the pupils; the teacher should\r\ntherefore choose her words carefully. Technical terms may be taught, but\r\nthis is not advised in Junior classes, unless really necessary. If the\r\nfacts are intelligently related to the experiences of the pupils, that\r\nis all that is desired.\r\n\r\nTemperatures, as indicated by Fahrenheit thermometers, have always been\r\ngiven, as this scale is best known in the home.\r\n\r\nSince this Manual is designed for teachers, few recipes have been\r\nfurnished. The books of reference which are appended will supply these\r\nand additional information on the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nCORRELATION WITH OTHER SCHOOL SUBJECTS\r\n\r\nOne of the benefits of placing Household Management in a Course of Study\r\nis that it relates the knowledge gained in school to the home life.\r\n\r\nThe Household Management teacher has great opportunity for this\r\ncorrelation. She should be more than a teacher of household duties. She\r\nshould lead the pupils to see the importance and necessity of mastering\r\nthe other school subjects. Wherever interest in these subjects has\r\nalready been established, this interest will form a basis for\r\ndevelopment in many Household Management lessons.\r\n\r\nThen, too, the teachers of other subjects should, as far as possible,\r\nwork with the Household Management teacher in relating their instruction\r\nto the operations and requirements in the home. If the teachers\r\nco-operate in planning their lessons, the pupils will receive a deeper\r\nimpression of the facts learned in each subject and will have an\r\nincreased interest in the work, through seeing how one branch of\r\nknowledge is related to another.\r\n\r\nThe following will show how some of the subjects are related to the\r\nclass work of Household Management:\r\n\r\nArithmetic.--This subject is used in household accounts, in\r\nmeasurements, in the division of recipes, and in computing the cost of\r\nfoods prepared for the table.\r\n\r\nReading.--The pupils should be asked to read aloud the recipes and their\r\nnotes and should be required to do this distinctly and accurately.\r\n\r\nSpelling, Writing, Language Work.--In writing recipes and notes, in\r\nstories of household topics, and in written answers, the teacher should\r\ninsist on neat writing, correct spelling, and good English.\r\n\r\nGeography.--The study of materials for food, clothing, and house\r\nfurnishings brings before the mind our commercial relations with foreign\r\ncountries and the occupations of their inhabitants. It also suggests\r\nconsideration of climate and soils.\r\n\r\nHistory.--The evolution of furniture and utensils, of methods of\r\nhousekeeping, and of preparing and serving food, brings out historical\r\nfacts.\r\n\r\nElementary Science.--Throughout the Course, this subject is the\r\nfoundation of much of the instruction given, as it explains the\r\nprinciples underlying household industries. Soap-making, bread-making,\r\npreservation of food, and the processes of cooking and cleaning are\r\nexamples of this.\r\n\r\nSome knowledge of elementary science is also necessary to an\r\nunderstanding of the construction and practical working of the kitchen\r\nstove, the fireless cooker, the cream separator, and many household\r\nappliances. Its principles determine the methods of heating, lighting,\r\nand ventilating.\r\n\r\nPhysiology and Hygiene.--The study of food and the planning and\r\npreparation of meals should include a knowledge of the body and its\r\nrequirements. The sanitary care of the house and its premises is\r\ndirectly related to hygiene.\r\n\r\nNature Study.--Animals and plants furnish us with most of our food, and\r\nfamiliarity with these is necessary to the housekeeper. A knowledge of\r\nthe structure of animals is essential in studying the cuts of meat; the\r\nstructure of plants and the functions of their different parts give a\r\nkey to the value of vegetable food.\r\n\r\nPhysical Training.--The class should be carefully trained throughout in\r\ncorrect muscular movements. The position of the body should be closely\r\nwatched in working and in sitting, and the classes should enter and\r\nleave the room in systematic order.\r\n\r\nManual Training.--The practical part of housekeeping demands constant\r\nuse of the hands. The teacher should be watchful of awkward handling of\r\nmaterials and utensils and be careful to correct it. She should require\r\ndeft, natural movements until they become habits.\r\n\r\nArt.--Ideas of colour and design should be applied in choosing\r\nwall-papers, carpets, dishes, furniture, and clothing. The pupils might\r\nbe asked to make original coloured designs for these household articles.\r\n\r\n\r\nROOMS\r\n\r\nIt is most desirable to have Household Management include all home\r\noperations and, to make this possible, more than one room should be\r\nprovided. Many school boards, however, in introducing the work, find\r\nthat one room is all that can be afforded. Where this is the case, it is\r\nnecessary that this room be equipped as a kitchen, though it must be\r\nused for other purposes as well. It will serve also for table-setting\r\nand serving, for simple laundry work, for lessons in home-nursing, and\r\nfor sewing.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Household Management class at work]\r\n\r\nThis kitchen should be large and airy, so that the class can work\r\ncomfortably and conveniently. A room having greater length than width\r\nadmits of the best arrangement.\r\n\r\nOn account of the odours that arise from cooking and other domestic\r\noperations, the kitchen should be on the top floor and should have more\r\nadequate means of ventilation than ordinary class-rooms. A north\r\nexposure makes it cooler in summer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Opposite end of Household Management class-room, showing\r\nthe black-board and class cupboard]\r\n\r\n\r\nEQUIPMENT\r\n\r\nIn planning an equipment, one must be guided by the conditions to be\r\nmet. It is difficult to be definite in details, but certain general\r\nprinciples should be observed.\r\n\r\nThe entire equipment should be suited to the needs of the pupils, and it\r\nshould also be one which it is desirable and possible for them to have\r\nin their own homes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Household Management class-room, showing tables, sinks,\r\nand stoves]\r\n\r\nThe walls and floor should be washable, and they, as well as the\r\nfurniture, should have plain, smooth surfaces which do not catch dust\r\nand are easily cleaned.\r\n\r\nThe sinks, stoves, tables, and cupboards should be placed so as to save\r\nsteps.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLES\r\n\r\nWhere economy is necessary, movable tables may be used, but the fixed\r\nones are to be preferred. The latter may be placed in the form of a\r\nhollow square or an oval, with openings from opposite sides to give\r\nconvenient access to a centre table, which can be used for supplies or\r\nas a dining table.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Section of a table designed for two pupils]\r\n\r\nDrawers and cupboards to hold the necessary utensils and supplies should\r\nbe provided in the tables for each pupil. Provision may also be made\r\nunder the table top for desk boards, which may be pulled out when notes\r\nare written, in order to allow the pupils to sit comfortably in front of\r\nthe cupboards. The table top should be of hard wood or some\r\nnon-absorbent material, jointed in narrow strips in order to prevent\r\nwarping. Part of this must be protected by a metal or glass strip on\r\nwhich to set the individual stoves or hot dishes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Contents of a table cupboard equipped for two pupils]\r\n\r\nA working drawing and design of the tables used in the Normal Schools\r\nmay be obtained from the Department of Education, Toronto.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Contents of an individual utensil drawer]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Contents of an individual supply drawer]\r\n\r\n\r\nSEATS\r\n\r\nThe seats may be swing seats, stools, or chairs. The swing seats are\r\nnoiseless and easily put out of the way, but are uncomfortable and\r\nunsteady, so that the pupils are inclined to prop themselves by placing\r\ntheir elbows on the table. The stools and chairs are noisy and occupy a\r\ngreat deal of room, but the latter are restful and conducive to the\r\ncorrect position of the pupils, the importance of which cannot be\r\nover-estimated. The former are inexpensive, if made with a plain, wooden\r\ntop. Both should admit of being pushed under the table, and for this\r\nreason the chairs should have folding backs. The legs should be tipped\r\nwith rubber in order to minimize the noise.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A class towel rack]\r\n\r\n\r\nRACKS\r\n\r\nTowel racks should be placed near the sinks and, if possible, should\r\nallow space for hanging the towels without folding. In some tables a\r\ntowel rack may be attached to one of the sides.\r\n\r\n\r\nSINKS\r\n\r\nA sink at each corner of the room saves much time and inconveniences in\r\nthe work. Each of these should be provided with hot and cold water. They\r\nmay be made of porcelain or of enamelled iron.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A class gas range, showing high ovens]\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS CUPBOARD\r\n\r\nA large class cupboard in two sections, having glass doors in the upper\r\npart to show the class china and glass, should be placed where it will\r\nbe most convenient and add to the attractiveness of the room. This\r\ncupboard will hold the dinner set and extra dishes and utensils, as well\r\nas the linen and some staple food supplies. A refrigerator is desirable\r\nfor such foods as butter, eggs, meat, etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A class cupboard]\r\n\r\n\r\nSTOVES\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Individual table stoves\r\n\r\n(_a_) a gas stove\r\n\r\n(_b_) an electric stove\r\n\r\n(_c_) a blue-flame kerosene stove\r\n\r\n(_d_) an ordinary kerosene stove]\r\n\r\nThe stoves provided will depend on the fuel that is available in the\r\nneighbourhood. Wood is still in use in some rural sections, while coal\r\nis the ordinary fuel in small towns and villages. Where either of these\r\nfuels is commonly used, there should be two ranges. One should be for\r\ncoal or wood, to teach the use of the home fuel, and the other an oil,\r\ngas, or electric stove, to demonstrate the time and labour saved the\r\nhousekeeper by the use of one of these. If possible, the stoves should\r\nhave high ovens, to obviate the necessity of stooping. A section of\r\nglass in the oven door is a great convenience, as it allows the\r\ncontents of the oven to be easily watched.\r\n\r\nFor individual work small table stoves are required. These may be\r\nsupplied with oil, alcohol, gas, or electricity, as may be most readily\r\nobtained. These stoves may be arranged so that they can be swung from\r\nthe table when not in use. In this way more room is provided for work,\r\nand the table is more easily cleaned. The tops of the stoves should be\r\nwide and flat, so that cooking dishes will not easily upset.\r\n\r\nA fireless cooker, though not really necessary, is most helpful. Where\r\nfunds are lacking, one may be made by the pupils at small expense. A\r\nbarrel, wooden box, or large pail may be filled with hay or excelsior,\r\nand small, covered, granite pails may be used to contain the food.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK-BOARDS\r\n\r\nThe black-boards should be of slate or glass, and as large as the size\r\nof the room allows. The windows and doors should be so placed that there\r\nwill be unbroken stretches of wall for this purpose. Part of the\r\nblack-board should be provided with a sliding board which, when\r\nrequired, can be drawn to conceal what is written. A separate\r\nblack-board for current prices of common food materials is an excellent\r\nidea. The responsibility of keeping these prices correct should be given\r\nto the pupils.\r\n\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATIVE MATERIAL\r\n\r\nA cabinet, or display case, for illustrative material, is of great\r\neducational value and, to the pupils, is one of the most attractive\r\nfeatures of the room. The following list of specimens is suggestive for\r\nthis:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A display cabinet--canned fruit]\r\n\r\n1. Standard china, such as Crown Derby, Wedgewood, Limoges, Dresden,\r\nBeleek, etc.\r\n\r\n2. Standard carpet, such as Axminster, Wilton, Brussels, Tapestry\r\n\r\n3. Woods used for furniture and building\r\n\r\n4. Food materials in various stages of preparation, such as sugar,\r\nspices, cereals, tea, coffee, cocoa\r\n\r\n5. Fruit canned by the pupils\r\n\r\n6. Designs for wall-paper, linoleum, dishes, etc., made by the pupils.\r\n\r\nOther illustrative material in the form of charts showing the\r\ncomparative values of the common foods, or illustrating cuts of meat or\r\ndifferent kinds of vegetables and fish, will be found to aid greatly in\r\nmaking the teaching effective. There are few of these to be obtained,\r\nbut home-made ones may be prepared from cuts in bulletins and magazines.\r\nPictures illustrating the production and manufacture of food may also be\r\nmounted and used.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK-CASE\r\n\r\nBook shelves should be provided, where a small library of books bearing\r\non the various phases of the subject may be kept, together with the\r\nGovernment Bulletins and some well-chosen periodicals and magazines.\r\nThese may be selected from the _Catalogue of Books_ which has been\r\nprepared by the Department of Education.\r\n\r\n\r\nUTENSILS\r\n\r\nIn regard to the selection of small articles required, such as dishes\r\nand utensils of various kinds, the greatest care should be exercised.\r\nThis part of the equipment can be exactly duplicated by the pupils in\r\ntheir homes, and in this way may be of educational value to the\r\ncommunity. The cooking and serving dishes should combine quality,\r\nutility, and beauty.\r\n\r\nIt is not economy to buy cheap utensils. As far as possible, they should\r\nbe chosen with smooth, curved surfaces, as seams and angles allow\r\nlodging places for food and make the cleaning difficult.\r\n\r\nEverything should be of good quality, the latest of its kind that has\r\nbeen approved, and, at the same time, have a shape and colour that is\r\nartistic.\r\n\r\nIt is wise to buy from stock which can be duplicated if breakages occur,\r\nso that the equipment may be kept uniform. For individual work the\r\nutensils should not be too large.\r\n\r\nColoured granite ware is best for most of the cooking dishes. Where tin\r\nis necessary, it should be of a good quality. Crockery is desirable for\r\nsome bowls, jars, and serving dishes. Spoons and serving forks should be\r\nof Nevada silver, and knives of the best steel with well-made wooden\r\nhandles.\r\n\r\nThe cost of this part of the equipment and the number of articles\r\npurchased must of course depend on the funds available. The following\r\nlist is intended to give what is really desirable in a specially\r\nequipped room, at prices which are a fair average.\r\n\r\n\r\nEQUIPMENT\r\n\r\nFOR TWENTY-FOUR PUPILS\r\n\r\n\r\nI.

In such cases the equipment must be a movable one, and gas\r\nstoves and plumbing are impossible. Table tops may be placed on\r\ntrestles or laid across the ordinary desks, and oil or alcohol lamps\r\nmust be used. These and the necessary utensils may be kept in a cupboard\r\nin the room.\r\n\r\nWith certain restrictions, the Department of Education assists in\r\nequipping special rooms in villages and rural districts and also in\r\nmaintaining instruction in this subject.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Modified equipment for rural schools]\r\n\r\nThe classes in these schools are usually smaller, so that an outfit\r\nsuitable for individual work with a class of twelve will generally\r\nsuffice.

The definite length of the\r\nperiod allowed in the school programme for this work makes economy of\r\ntime absolutely necessary. The cooking processes cannot be hurried, and\r\nunless there is in the teacher\'s mind a well-arranged plan for the use\r\nof the time, a part of the lesson is apt to be hastily and carelessly\r\ndone. Then, too, in the limited space of one room, a number of people\r\ncannot work without confusion unless there is system.\r\n\r\nThe pupils enjoy a well-regulated lesson and their co-operation is\r\ngained, while, through the poor results of a lesson indifferently\r\nplanned, they lose self-confidence and the sense of responsibility.\r\n\r\n\r\nNUMBER IN THE CLASS\r\n\r\nAs a Household Management class is one that calls for individual\r\nsupervision, the number should not exceed twenty-four, and a smaller\r\nclass ensures more thorough supervision on the part of the teacher.\r\nNeatness, thoroughness, and accuracy are important factors in the work\r\nof each lesson, and the number of pupils should not be so large that a\r\nlack of these will pass unnoticed.\r\n\r\n\r\nUNIFORMS, ETC.\r\n\r\nThe uniform consists of a large, plain, white apron with a bib large\r\nenough to protect the dress, a pair of sleevelets, a holder, a small\r\ntowel for personal use, and a white muslin cap to confine the hair.\r\n(See Frontispiece.) Each pupil will also require a note-book and pencil\r\nfor class, and a note-book to be used at home for re-copying the class\r\nwork in ink. These books should be neatly written and kept for\r\nreference, and should be regularly examined and marked by the teacher\r\nfor correction by the pupils.\r\n\r\nThe pupils should be encouraged to be clean and neat in appearance. They\r\nshould be expected to have tidy hair, clean hands and nails, and neat\r\nuniforms. It is a good plan for each pupil to have two sets of uniforms,\r\nso that when one is in the wash the other will be ready to use. It may\r\nbe wise to make a rule that the pupils without uniforms will not be\r\nallowed to work, but such a rule must be judiciously enforced, as in\r\nsome cases it might result in much loss of time. There should be lockers\r\nor other proper provision provided at the school for keeping each\r\nuniform separately. Pasteboard boxes may be used for this purpose, when\r\nno such provision is made.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCIPLINE\r\n\r\nThe pupils should be trained to enter and leave the room in the same\r\norder as in their other classes. Each pupil should have a definite\r\nworking place and should not be allowed to "visit" others during the\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nWhile at work, it is wise to allow the pupils as much freedom in talking\r\nand movement as possible, so as to portray the home life. They should be\r\ntaught, however, that when their conduct interferes with the order of\r\nthe room or the comforts and rights of others, they must suppress their\r\ninclinations. During the time of teaching there must be perfect quiet\r\nand attention. Marks are sometimes given to secure punctuality and good\r\nwork, but the best way to have both is to try to make each member of\r\nthe class interested and happy in her work.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIVISION OF THE PERIODS\r\n\r\nThe time given to a practical lesson is usually one and a half hours.\r\nThis must include both the theoretical and the practical work. In\r\ndividing the period, it is difficult to say how much time should be\r\ngiven to each of these, but, broadly speaking, the theoretical part may\r\noccupy one third of the time. The time for dish washing and cleaning\r\nwill be included in the time allowance for practical work. These duties\r\nshould require less time as the class advances in the work.\r\n\r\nNotes should be copied at the most convenient time, usually while the\r\nfood is cooking. Sitting to write notes will afford an opportunity for\r\nresting after any practical work. If printed cards are used, much of the\r\nnote-taking is obviated. A sample card is given below.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT\r\n\r\nJUNIOR FOURTH CARD\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE WATER SAUCE\r\n\r\n        1   c. veg. water\r\n        2   tbsp. flour\r\n            pepper\r\n        2   tbsp. butter\r\n        1/4 tsp. salt\r\n\r\n1. Put the vegetable water over a gentle heat.\r\n\r\n2. Mix the flour with a little cold water until smooth and thick as\r\ncream.\r\n\r\n3. When the vegetable water is steaming hot, gradually stir the flour\r\npaste into it and keep stirring until it thickens and boils.\r\n\r\n4. Add the butter, salt, and pepper.\r\n\r\n5. Pour the sauce over the hot vegetable.\r\n\r\n\r\nASSIGNMENT OF WORK\r\n\r\nFor practical work there are two plans in general use--individual and\r\ngroup work. In individual work, each pupil performs all the processes,\r\nhandling small quantities of material. In group work, the pupils work in\r\ngroups on one dish, each sharing the duties.\r\n\r\nBy the first method, the pupil has no chance to deal with quantities\r\nlarge enough for family purposes, and the small amount does not give\r\nadequate practice in manipulation, though it does give individual\r\nresponsibility in every detail. By the second method, normal quantities\r\nare used, but a pupil never has entire responsibility throughout the\r\nprocesses.\r\n\r\nThe cost of supplies is often accountable for group work, but lack of\r\nutensils or oven room may make it a necessity. In some lessons,\r\nindividual work with normal quantities may be obtained by allowing the\r\npupils to bring the main ingredients from home; for example, fruit for a\r\ncanning lesson. The finished product is then the property of the pupil\r\nwho has made it.\r\n\r\nThe cleaning which always follows the use of the equipment is preferably\r\ndone in groups. For instance, if there are groups of fours, number one\r\ncan, during a lesson, wash all dishes used by the four, number two can\r\nwipe the dishes, number three can clean the table used by the group, and\r\nnumber four can clean the sink. During the next lesson number two is\r\ndish washer, and number three dish wiper, and so on, until, in four\r\nlessons, each pupil has had practice in four kinds of household work and\r\nhas also been given an idea of the inter-dependence of family life and\r\ninterests. The same numbers should be kept during the term, as this\r\naffords an easy way of definitely designating the pupils for certain\r\nduties.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPLIES\r\n\r\nThe supplies for a lesson may be put on a centre table, or smaller\r\namounts may be placed on the working tables in front of the groups. If\r\nthe class is large, the latter plan is better, especially where\r\nmeasurements are necessary, as it saves time and confusion. Standard\r\nfood supplies, such as salt, pepper, sugar, and flour may be kept in a\r\ndrawer of the work-table of each pupil. (See page 15.)\r\n\r\nEvery member of the class should be familiar with the contents of the\r\nclass pantry, cupboards, and drawers, so that she can get or put away\r\nutensils and materials without the help of the teacher.\r\n\r\nIf breakages occur through carelessness, the utensils should be replaced\r\nat the expense of the offender. This is not only a deserved punishment,\r\nbut it always ensures a full equipment.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRACTICE WORK AT HOME\r\n\r\nAs a lesson in Household Management comes but once a week, much is\r\ngained by having the work reviewed by practice at home. To encourage\r\nthis, in some schools a "practice sheet" is posted, on which the work\r\ndone by each pupil, between lessons, is recorded. There is a danger of\r\nthe younger pupils attempting work that is too difficult, which will end\r\nin poor results and discouragement. To avoid this, with pupils in the\r\nThird Form, it may be wise to limit their practice in cookery to a\r\nreview of the work done in class.\r\n\r\nThe home practice work may be taken at the beginning of a lesson or\r\nduring the time the food is cooking. It may be quickly ascertained by\r\nthe pupils rising in order and stating simply the name of the duty they\r\nhave done or the dish they have made unless they have had poor results,\r\nwhen the nature of these should be told. If there have been failures,\r\nthe pupils should, if possible, give reasons for these and suggest means\r\nof avoiding them in future.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL SUGGESTIONS\r\n\r\n1. The teacher should endeavour to plan lessons which will be definitely\r\nrelated to the home lives of the pupils. What is useful for one class\r\nmay not be useful for another. The connection between the lessons and\r\nthe home should be very real. It is also important to have a sequence in\r\nthe lessons.\r\n\r\n2. Great care should be exercised in criticising any of the home methods\r\nthat are suggested by the pupils. A girl\'s faith in her mother should\r\nnot be lessened.\r\n\r\n3. The work should be taken up in a very simple manner; scientific\r\npresentation should be left for the high school.\r\n\r\n4. Economy should be emphasized in all home duties; time, labour, and\r\nmoney should be used to give the best possible returns. Wholesome\r\nsubstitutes for expensive foods and attractive preparation and serving\r\nof left-over foods should be encouraged.\r\n\r\n5. Too much vigilance cannot be exercised during the first year of\r\npractical work, when habits are being formed. It is much easier to form\r\nhabits than to break away from them.\r\n\r\n6. While nothing less than the best work should be accepted from the\r\npupils, it requires much discernment to know when fault should be found,\r\nin order to avoid saying or doing anything that would discourage them.\r\n\r\n7. As Household Management is a manual subject, the teacher is advised,\r\nas far as possible, not to spend time in talking about the work, but to\r\nhave the class spend their time in doing the work.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIONS FOR SCHOOLS WITH LIMITED, OR NO EQUIPMENT\r\n\r\nIn schools where the ordinary class-room must be used for all subjects,\r\nthere are unusual difficulties in teaching Household Management. For\r\nsuch schools, two modified equipments are outlined.\r\n\r\nSince such class-rooms require special arrangement for practical lessons\r\nin this subject, it would be well to take this work in the afternoon, so\r\nthat part of the noon hour may be taken for preparation. Pupils who have\r\nearned the right to responsibility may be appointed in turn to assist in\r\nthis duty.\r\n\r\nIn rural schools, the afternoon recess might be taken from 2.15 to 2.30\r\nand, during this time, tables, stoves, and supplies may be placed, so as\r\nto be ready for the lesson to follow in the remaining hour and a half.\r\n\r\nFor pupils who are not in the Household Management class, definite work\r\nshould be planned. They may occupy themselves with manual training,\r\nsewing, art work, map-drawing, composition, etc. In summer, school\r\ngardening may be done.\r\n\r\nSince the end of the week, in many schools, is chosen for a break in the\r\nusual routine, Friday afternoon seems a suitable time for Household\r\nManagement lessons.\r\n\r\nUnder such limited conditions, it will be necessary to group the larger\r\npupils into one class for practical work, and it may be necessary for\r\nthe pupils to take turns in working. In some cases, the teacher must\r\ndemonstrate what the class may practise at home.\r\n\r\nIt will be impossible, in such schools, to cover the prescribed work.\r\nFrom the topics suggested in the Course of Study each teacher may\r\narrange a programme by selecting what is most useful to the pupils and\r\nwhat is possible in the school.\r\n\r\nEven in schools which have no equipment, much of the theory of Household\r\nManagement can be taught and some experiments may be performed. On\r\nFriday afternoons a regular period may be devoted to this subject, when\r\nthe ingenious teacher will find ways and means of teaching many useful\r\nlessons.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following will be suggestive as suitable for lessons under such\r\nconditions:\r\n\r\n1. Any of the lessons prescribed in the Course of Study for Form III,\r\nJunior.\r\n\r\n2. Measuring.--Table of measures used in cookery, methods of measuring,\r\nequivalent measures and weights of standard foods.\r\n\r\n3. Cleaning.--Principles, methods, agents.\r\n\r\n4. Water.--Uses in the home, appearance under heat, highest temperature,\r\nways of using cooking water.\r\n\r\n5. Cooking.--Reasons for cooking, kinds of heat used, common methods of\r\nconducting heat to food, comparison of methods of cooking as to time\r\nrequired and effect of heat on food.\r\n\r\n        NOTE.--An alcohol stove, saucepan, and\r\n        thermometer are necessary for this lesson.\r\n\r\n6. The kitchen fire.--Experiments to show necessities of a fire,\r\nconstruction of a practical cooking stove.\r\n\r\n7. Food.--Uses, kinds, common sources.\r\n\r\n8. Preservation of food.--Cause of decay, methods of preservation,\r\napplication of methods to well-known foods.\r\n\r\n9. Yeast.--Description, necessary conditions, sources, use.\r\n\r\nNOTE.--A few test-tubes and a saucepan are necessary for this lesson.\r\n\r\n10. The table.--Laying a table, serving at table, table manners.\r\n\r\n11. Care of a bed-room.--Making the bed, ventilating, sweeping, and\r\ndusting the room.\r\n\r\n12. Sanitation.--Necessity for sanitation, household methods.\r\n\r\n13. Laundry work.--Necessary materials, processes.\r\n\r\n14. Home-nursing.--The ideal sick-room, care of the patient\'s bed, and\r\ndiet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nFORM III: JUNIOR GRADE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pupils of Form III, Junior, are generally too small to use the\r\ntables and stoves provided for the other classes and too young to be\r\nintrusted with fires, hot water, etc.; but they may be taught the\r\nsimpler facts of Household Management by the special teacher of the\r\nsubject, or by the regular teacher in correlation with the other\r\nsubjects. In either case a special room is not necessary.\r\n\r\nIf the latter plan be adopted, the following correlations are suggested:\r\n\r\n\r\nCORRELATIONS\r\n\r\nArithmetic.--1. Bills of household supplies, such as furniture, fuel,\r\nmeat, groceries, bed and table linen, material for clothing. This will\r\nteach the current prices as well as the usual quantities purchased.\r\n\r\n2. Making out the daily, weekly, or monthly supply and cost of any one\r\nitem of food, being given the number in the family and the amount used\r\nby each per day.\r\n\r\n_Example_: One loaf costs 6c. and cuts into 18 slices. Find the cost of\r\nbread for two days for a family of six, if each person uses 1 1/2 slices\r\nat one meal.\r\n\r\n3. Making out the total weekly or monthly expenses of a household, given\r\nthe items of meat, groceries, fuel, gas, etc. This brings up the\r\nquestion of the cost of living.\r\n\r\n4. Making out the total cost of a cake, a loaf of bread, a jar of fruit,\r\nor a number of sandwiches, given the cost of the main materials and\r\nfuel used. Compare the home cost with the cost at a store. This may be\r\nused to teach economy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGeography.--1. The sources of our water supply.\r\n\r\n2. The geographical sources of our ordinary household materials, their\r\nshipping centres, the routes by which they reach us, and the means of\r\ntransportation.\r\n\r\n_Examples_: Fuels, common minerals used in building and furnishing;\r\ntimber for floors and furniture; manufactured goods, such as cotton,\r\nlinen, carpets, china; domestic and foreign fruits; common groceries,\r\nsuch as salt, sugar, tea, coffee, cocoa, spices, rice, cereals, and\r\nflour.\r\n\r\n3. The preparation of our common household commodities.\r\n\r\n_Examples_: Cotton, linen, china, paper, sugar, tea, coffee, cereals,\r\nflour.\r\n\r\n4. The household products that are exported.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNature Study.--1. The parts of plants used as food.\r\n\r\n2. The natural sources of our common foods, such as cornstarch, flour,\r\nbreakfast cereals, tea, coffee, cocoa, sugar, salt, cheese, butter.\r\n\r\n3. The sources of common household substances, such as coal-oil,\r\ngasolene, paraffin, turpentine, washing soda, whiting, bathbrick, soap.\r\n\r\n4. The forms of water, as ice, steam.\r\n\r\n5. The composition and impurities of the air.\r\n\r\n6. The ordinary woods used in house building and furnishing.\r\n\r\nHygiene.--The necessity for the following:\r\n\r\n1. Fresh air in the home at all times--in living rooms and sleeping\r\nrooms\r\n\r\n2. Good food and plenty of sleep\r\n\r\n3. Cleanliness of the body\r\n\r\n4. Cleanliness in preparing food\r\n\r\n5. Cleanliness in the home and surroundings.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPhysical Training.--1. The value of exercise gained by performing\r\nhousehold duties.\r\n\r\n2. The importance of correct positions in performing home duties, such\r\nas dish washing, sewing, etc.\r\n\r\n3. The value of conveniences to save steps.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nComposition.--Topics selected from household materials and activities.\r\n\r\n_Examples_: Food materials, cleansing agents, planning a convenient\r\nkitchen or bath-room, sweeping day, baking day, arrangement of a kitchen\r\ncupboard or clothes closet, etc.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSpelling.--Names of household articles and duties as follows:\r\n\r\nFurniture of a special room, such as kitchen or sitting-room, kitchen\r\nutensils, contents of a kitchen cupboard, dishes and food used at a\r\nparticular meal, etc.\r\n\r\nManual Training.--Construction of household furnishings and utensils for\r\na doll\'s house from raffia, paper, and plasticine.\r\n\r\nArt.--Designing and colouring carpets, curtains, wall-papers, book\r\ncovers, dishes, tiles, ribbons, and dress materials.\r\n\r\nSewing.--Making the uniform for Household Management work.\r\n\r\nIf the Household Management teacher takes the work with this class, she\r\nshould follow the outline of work given in the Course of Study. This\r\noutline will make the pupils familiar with the common household\r\nmaterials as to their sources, preparation, and cost, and when, in the\r\nnext class, they deal with these materials, they will do so with more\r\ninterest and intelligence. It will also draw attention to the importance\r\nof economy in time and energy. The convenience of a kitchen and the use\r\nof proper utensils to facilitate labour will impress this fact.\r\n\r\nThe lessons should be taught simply as information lessons and should be\r\nof the same length as the other studies--from thirty to forty minutes.\r\nIf the usual hour and a half period be set aside for this class, the\r\nremainder of the time may be devoted to sewing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nFORM III: SENIOR GRADE\r\n\r\nLESSON I\r\n\r\n\r\nSCOPE OF HOUSEHOLD MANAGEMENT\r\n\r\nIn introducing the practical side of Household Management to a class, it\r\nis an advantage to let them have a general idea of what the subject\r\nincludes. They will then work with more intelligence and usually with\r\nmore interest. Then, too, the prevalent idea that the subject means only\r\ncooking will be corrected from the first.\r\n\r\nThroughout the introduction, the teacher should not forget that she is\r\ndealing with immature minds and that the ideas must be very simply\r\nexpressed. She might ask what the pupils expect to learn in this class,\r\nhave them name other subjects they study in school, and in each case\r\nlead up to the _one_ thing of which a particular subject treats; for\r\nexample, arithmetic treats of _numbers_; geography, of the _world_;\r\nhistory, of _past events_. She should lead the class to see that the one\r\nthing of which Household Management treats is the _home_; and that the\r\ntwo great requirements for a home are the _house_, and the people who\r\nlive in it, or the _occupants_.\r\n\r\nTo get the details relating to each of these two divisions, let the\r\npupils imagine they are boarding in some locality where they decide to\r\nmake a home for themselves. The first thing to be done is to choose a\r\nbuilding lot. Then they must decide upon the kind of house they want and\r\nthe plan of the house. After the house is built, it must be furnished.\r\nWhen the house is ready, it must be cleaned and kept clean. As soon as\r\nthe family move in, new considerations arise--they must have food, which\r\nmust be bought, prepared, and served; each member of the family must be\r\nclothed and educated; they must receive proper care when sick. Only a\r\nfew minutes should be spent on this introductory talk.\r\n\r\nWhile the class is naturally led to think of and name these details,\r\nthey should be written on the black-board in the order of development,\r\nsomewhat as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Household Management teaches us about the _home_.\r\n\r\n2. A home includes two main ideas:\r\n\r\n        (1) A house, (2) a family.\r\n\r\n3. In connection with a _house_ we must consider:\r\n\r\n        (1) The lot, (2) the plan, (3) the furnishing,\r\n        (4) the cleaning.\r\n\r\n4. In connection with a _family_ we must consider:\r\n\r\n        (1) Food (buying, cooking, serving), (2)\r\n        clothing (buying, sewing, mending), (3)\r\n        education, (4) home nursing.\r\n\r\nTell the pupils that a housekeeper should be informed on all of these\r\npoints, but little girls can expect to study only a few of them, such as\r\nquestions of food, clothing, and cleaning.\r\n\r\n\r\nSURVEY OF EQUIPMENT, UNIFORM, ETC.\r\n\r\nEquipment.--Most of the time of the first lesson should be used in\r\nmaking the pupils acquainted with their surroundings and individual\r\nnecessities, so that they will be ready for work the next day.\r\n\r\nGive each member of the class a definite working place, and let her\r\nexamine the contents of the cupboard and drawers which belong to her\r\nplace. Explain that the particular places which the pupils are given\r\nwill be kept throughout the year, and that, while they have the\r\nprivilege of using and enjoying them, they are responsible for their\r\ncleanliness and order.\r\n\r\nPoint out the remainder of the equipment--hot and cold water-taps, towel\r\nracks, class cupboard with its contents, refrigerator, large and\r\nindividual stoves.\r\n\r\nTeach each pupil how to light her stove and regulate its heat.\r\n\r\nUniforms, etc.--Tell the pupils that you have shown them what has been\r\nprovided for them, but you want them also to provide some things for\r\nthemselves. It will be necessary for them to bring a large, plain, white\r\napron, having a bib large enough to protect the dress; a pair of\r\nsleevelets; a holder; a small towel for personal use; and a white muslin\r\ncap to confine the hair while working. They will also need a note-book\r\nand pencil for class, and a note-book to be used at home for re-copying\r\nthe class work in ink. The latter book is to be very neatly written and\r\nkept for reference after it has been examined by the teacher.\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON II\r\n\r\nUSE OF EQUIPMENT\r\n\r\nThe little girls who make up the classes are not so far removed from\r\ntheir "playhouse" days that a survey of the dishes, stoves, and tables\r\nwill not give them an eager desire to begin using them. This desire\r\nshould be gratified, but as the use always necessitates the cleaning as\r\nwell, it may be advisable at first to make use of the equipment only for\r\nthe purpose of showing proper methods of cleaning.\r\n\r\nA short lesson on cleaning may be given in a few minutes, and the rest\r\nof the period spent in putting it into practice. The teacher may proceed\r\nsomewhat as follows in the development of a lesson on cleaning:\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT OF A LESSON ON CLEANING\r\n\r\nMEANING OF CLEANING\r\n\r\nTake two dishes--plates or saucers--exactly alike. Have one clean and\r\nthe other soiled with butter or some well-known substance. Ask the class\r\nthe difference between them. One is clean and one dirty. What substance\r\nis on one that hinders your saying it is clean? Butter. What else could\r\nbe on it? Jam. What else? Dust. What else? Gravy. Now instead of telling\r\nthe name of the particular substance in each case, let us try to find\r\none name that will apply to all of the substances which, as you say,\r\nmake the dish dirty. Let us give these substances a name which will show\r\nthat they do not belong to the plate. We may call each of them a foreign\r\nsubstance. And if I take the substance off the plate what am I doing to\r\nthe plate? Cleaning it. Then what is cleaning? Cleaning is removing a\r\nforeign substance.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF CLEANING\r\n\r\n1. _Scraping or rubbing away the foreign substance:_\r\n\r\nWhat would you use to remove the butter from the plate? A piece of paper\r\nor a knife. What are you doing with the knife or paper? Scraping or\r\nrubbing off the foreign substance. Then how was it removed? It was\r\nremoved by scraping or rubbing.\r\n\r\nSuppose some one has sharpened a pencil and let the pieces fall on the\r\nfloor, what would you take to remove the foreign substance from the\r\nfloor? A broom. What would you say you are doing with the broom?\r\nSweeping. How does the movement of the broom over the floor compare with\r\nthe movement of the knife over the plate? It is similar. What would you\r\ntake to remove the dust from the window-sill? A duster. What would you\r\nsay you are doing? Dusting. How does the movement of the duster compare\r\nwith the movement of the knife and the broom? It is similar. In all of\r\nthese cases of dish, floor, and sill, how did we remove the foreign\r\nsubstance? We scraped or rubbed it off. Name one way of removing a\r\nforeign substance. Scraping or rubbing it away.\r\n\r\n2. _Dissolving the foreign substance and then scraping it away:_\r\n\r\nShow a much soiled towel and ask what is usually done to clean it. It is\r\nwashed. Ask the pupils to tell just what they mean by that. The towel is\r\nput in water and soap used on it. What effect will the soap and water\r\nhave on the foreign substance? They will soften or dissolve it. Then\r\nwhat must be done next? The towel must be rubbed on a board or with the\r\nhands. What effect has this operation on the foreign substance? It\r\nscrapes or rubs the foreign substance away. Then we have another way of\r\ncleaning: By first dissolving the foreign substance, and then scraping\r\nor rubbing it away.\r\n\r\nA number of well-known cleaning operations may then be given, and the\r\npupils asked in each case to decide the method used--such as, whisking a\r\ncoat, scrubbing a table, cleaning the teeth, or washing dishes.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMMON HOUSEHOLD CLEANSING AGENTS\r\n\r\nNext, get lists of the common cleansing agents found in an ordinary\r\nhome, and arrange them in order of coarseness.\r\n\r\n\r\nBLACK-BOARD OUTLINE\r\n\r\nThe black-board scheme, as the lesson develops, will appear as follows:\r\n\r\n1. _Meaning of Cleaning:_\r\n\r\n        Cleaning is removing any foreign substance.\r\n\r\n2. _Methods of Cleaning:_\r\n\r\n        (1) Scraping or rubbing away the foreign\r\n            substance.\r\n\r\n        (2) Dissolving the foreign substance and then\r\n            scraping or rubbing it away.\r\n\r\n3. _Household cleansing agents used in the first method:_\r\n\r\n        (1) Duster\r\n        (2) Brush\r\n        (3) Broom\r\n        (4) Washboard\r\n        (5) Knife\r\n        (6) Whiting\r\n        (7) Bathbrick\r\n        (8) Coarse salt\r\n        (9) Sand\r\n        (10) Ashes.\r\n\r\n4. _Household cleansing agents used in the second method:_\r\n\r\n        (1) Water\r\n        (2) Hot water\r\n        (3) Soap\r\n        (4) Lux\r\n        (5) Ammonia\r\n        (6) Borax\r\n        (7) Washing soda\r\n        (8) Coal-oil\r\n        (9) Gasolene\r\n        (10) Acids\r\n        (11) Lye.\r\n\r\n5. _Combination cleansing agents:_\r\n\r\n        (1) Bon Ami,\r\n        (2) Dutch Cleanser,\r\n        (3) Sapolio.\r\n\r\nWhen the class have these ideas, they are ready to put them into\r\npractice, and the remainder of the lesson should be spent in practical\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nIf the pupils have soiled no dishes, it may be wise to drill them first\r\nin table washing or towel washing, so as to get them ready for the next\r\nlesson when tables and towels will be used.\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSONS III, IV, ETC.\r\n\r\nGradually, in connection with the making of simple dishes, the pupils\r\nshould be taught special methods of dish washing, sink cleaning, and\r\ndusting. Each day as they are appointed to different duties in cleaning,\r\nthese methods should be strictly followed until they become well known.\r\n\r\nWhile they are still new to the class, it will be a great help to have\r\noutlines of the kinds of cleaning which are necessary in every lesson\r\nposted conveniently in different parts of the room for reference.\r\n\r\nThese outlines may be as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nDISH WASHING\r\n\r\nPreparation for washing:\r\n\r\n1. Put away the food.\r\n\r\n2. Scrape and pile the dishes.\r\n\r\n3. Put the dishes that need it to soak.\r\n\r\n4. Place soap, pans, brushes, and towels.\r\n\r\n5.

Wash the duster and hang it up to dry.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEASURES AND RECIPES\r\n\r\nAnother preliminary part of the work will be teaching the pupils to\r\nmeasure and follow a recipe.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEASURES\r\n\r\nThe measures used in kitchen work are teaspoon, tablespoon, pint, quart,\r\nand gallon, of which a table should be developed as follows:\r\n\r\n    3 teaspoonfuls (tsp.)     1 tablespoonful (tbsp.)\r\n    16 tbsp.                  1 cup\r\n    2 cups                    1 pint (pt.)\r\n    2 pt.                     1 quart (qt.)\r\n    4 qt.                     1 gallon (gal.)\r\n\r\nIn connection with this table the following points should be brought\r\nout:\r\n\r\n1. That all measurements are made level.\r\n\r\n2. That in measuring liquids, the measure should be set on a level\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\n3. That to halve the contents of a spoon, the division should be made\r\nlengthwise.\r\n\r\n4. That to quarter the contents of a spoon, the half should be divided\r\ncrosswise.\r\n\r\n5. That in measuring flour, it should not be shaken down to level it.\r\n\r\n6. That in using one measure for both dry and liquid ingredients, the\r\ndry should be measured first.\r\n\r\n7. That in measuring a cupful of dry ingredients, the cup should be\r\nfilled by using a spoon or scoop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (_a_) Dividing the contents of a spoon]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (_b_) Dividing a spoonful in halves]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (_c_) Filling a cup]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (_d_) Levelling a cupful]\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF EQUIVALENT MEASURES AND WEIGHTS\r\n\r\nA table of equivalent measures and weights of some staple foods will\r\nalso be useful and may be given to the class:\r\n\r\n    2 cups butter (packed solidly)     1 pound\r\n    2 c. granulated sugar              1   "\r\n    2 c. rice                  (about) 1   "\r\n    2 c. finely chopped meat           1   "\r\n    2 2/3 c. brown sugar               1   "\r\n    2 2/3 c. powdered sugar            1   "\r\n    2 2/3 c. oatmeal                   1   "\r\n    2 2/3 c. cornmeal                  1   "\r\n    4 c. white flour                   1   "\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN OF LESSON ON MEASURING\r\n\r\nTIME LIMIT\r\n\r\nOne and one-half hours to be divided approximately as follows--one-half\r\nhour for teaching the theory, one-half hour for the practical\r\napplication of the theory, and one-half hour for housekeeping (washing\r\nof dishes, tables, sinks, etc., and putting the kitchen in order).\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARATION\r\n\r\n1. Place a set of measures at hand.\r\n\r\n2. Place a large bowl of flour on the teacher\'s table.\r\n\r\n3. Place flour and sugar in the boxes of the supply drawers.\r\n\r\n4. Place cans of cocoa and jugs of milk on the centre table.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT\r\n\r\n1. Introduction.--What do we take for a guide when cooking? How can we\r\nbe sure that we use the exact quantities the recipes require? Name some\r\nmeasures that you have learned in arithmetic. In this lesson we are\r\ngoing to learn the measures we require in cooking, also the proper ways\r\nof using them.\r\n\r\n2. Names of measures.--Show and name the measures, beginning at the\r\nsmallest: teaspoon, tablespoon, cup, pint, quart, gallon. As the\r\nmeasures are named, place them on the table in order of size.\r\n\r\n3. Methods of using measures.--Ask two or three pupils, in turn, to\r\nmeasure a teaspoonful of flour from the bowl on the teacher\'s table.\r\nThey will not agree in their measurements, and the necessity for\r\nlevelling will be shown. What can we use for levelling measures? How can\r\nwe level liquids?\r\n\r\nIf we need less than a spoonful, how can we measure it? Which part of\r\nthe spoon is deeper? How shall we divide the spoonful to make both\r\nhalves equal? How must we divide a spoonful into quarters? Into eighths?\r\nExamine and explain the divisions of the cup. To use one measure for\r\nboth liquid and dry ingredients, which should be measured first? (As\r\nthese points are obtained, they should be written on the black-board.)\r\n\r\n4. Table of measures.--In the tables of measures which you have learned,\r\nyou state the number of times one measure is contained in the next\r\nhigher. We shall form a table of the measures learned to-day. By\r\nmeasuring flour from their boxes, let each pupil find how many\r\nteaspoonfuls fill a tablespoon. How many tablespoonfuls fill a cup, a\r\nhalf cup, a quarter of a cup. They will state the remainder of the table\r\nfrom memory. Write the table on the black-board and teach the\r\nabbreviations.\r\n\r\n        NOTE.--After the lesson on measuring is\r\n        developed, the class should be given individual\r\n        work which will put these ideas into practice.\r\n        A simple recipe may be dictated by the teacher,\r\n        step by step. Cocoa makes a good recipe for\r\n        this lesson, as it affords practice in\r\n        measuring liquids as well as dry ingredients,\r\n        both powdered and granular. If each girl makes\r\n        half a cupful of cocoa, it will give practice\r\n        in dividing the contents of a spoon.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRACTICAL WORK TO APPLY MEASURING\r\n\r\nHave each pupil make half a cupful of cocoa by carrying out each step as\r\nit is dictated by the teacher, as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Numbers one put two cups of water in the tea kettle; numbers two\r\nlight a fire and put the water to boil; numbers three get cocoa from the\r\ncentre table; numbers four get milk.\r\n\r\n2. Set out sugar boxes and open them.\r\n\r\n3. Each take a small saucepan, a measuring cup, a teaspoon, a\r\nparing-knife, and a small cup.\r\n\r\n4. Measure half a teaspoonful of sugar into the saucepan.\r\n\r\n5. Measure half a teaspoonful of cocoa into the saucepan.\r\n\r\n6. Mix the sugar and cocoa by shaking the saucepan.\r\n\r\n7. Measure half of a third of a cupful of boiling water and stir it into\r\nthe sugar and cocoa.\r\n\r\n8. Set the mixture over a gentle fire and stir until it bubbles. Cook\r\nfor three minutes.\r\n\r\n9. Measure half of a third of a cupful of milk.\r\n\r\n10. Stir the milk into the mixture and heat it until it is steaming hot,\r\nbut do not boil it.\r\n\r\n11. Serve the cocoa in the small cups.\r\n\r\n12. Turn out the fires and put the saucepans to soak.\r\n\r\n\r\nSERVING\r\n\r\nEach pupil puts her table in order by moving all cooking utensils to the\r\nmetal part of the table and wiping off any soiled spots on the wooden\r\npart; she then sits to drink the cocoa she has made.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE-TAKING\r\n\r\nNotes are copied from the black-board in pencil in the ordinary class\r\nnote-books. The desk boards under the table tops are pulled out for this\r\npurpose. In this lesson the notes consist of:\r\n\r\n1. Table of measures, with abbreviations\r\n\r\n2. Points in measuring\r\n\r\n3. Recipe for cocoa (if there are recipe cards, these should be\r\ndistributed).\r\n\r\n\r\nHOUSEKEEPING\r\n\r\nThis will be done in groups of fours, according to their previous\r\nlessons in cleaning. If necessary, some special cleaning, as dish\r\nwashing or sink cleaning, may be taught at this point of the lesson:\r\n\r\n1. Number one will wash dishes for her group.\r\n\r\n2. Number two will wipe dishes for her group.\r\n\r\n3. Number three will clean the entire table belonging to her group.\r\n\r\n4. Number four will do work outside of her group as appointed, such as\r\ndusting, cleaning a sink or the centre table.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPE FOR COCOA\r\n\r\n        1 tsp. sugar\r\n        1 tsp. cocoa\r\n        1/3 c. boiling water\r\n        1/3 c. milk.\r\n\r\n1. Mix the sugar and cocoa in a saucepan.\r\n\r\n2. Stir the boiling water into the mixture, then set it over a gentle\r\nheat.\r\n\r\n3. Keep stirring until the mixture bubbles, then boil gently for about\r\nthree minutes.\r\n\r\n4. Stir in the milk and heat it until it steams, but do not boil it.\r\n\r\n5. Serve the cocoa hot or ice-cold.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPES\r\n\r\nIn connection with a recipe, the pupils should be taught to look for\r\nthree parts:\r\n\r\n1. The name\r\n\r\n2. The list and amount of ingredients\r\n\r\n3. The method.\r\n\r\nIn carrying out a recipe, they should, from the first, be taught to work\r\nin the following systematic order:\r\n\r\n1. To attend to the fire if necessary\r\n\r\n2. To collect the necessary utensils\r\n\r\n3. To collect the necessary ingredients\r\n\r\n4. To obey the method.\r\n\r\nFor this lesson, some simple recipe which will review measuring should\r\nbe clearly written on the black-board--the recipe for apple sauce or\r\ncranberry sauce would be suitable. While the pupils are learning\r\nobedience in following a recipe, it is better to keep them together in\r\ncarrying out their work. The method should be written in definite,\r\nnumbered steps, which may be checked off as each step is accomplished.\r\n\r\nWhen the class has had instruction in cleaning, measuring, and recipes,\r\nthey are ready for a series of lessons involving the use of simple\r\nrecipes which will put into practice the ideas they have learned. For\r\nthis practice, such recipes as the following are suggested:\r\n\r\nBoiled potatoes, mashed potatoes; boiled parsnips; boiled celery; boiled\r\ncarrots, asparagus, green peas; cranberry sauce; rhubarb sauce;\r\npreparing and combining ingredients for salads (fruit salad, potato\r\nsalad, cabbage and nut salad, Waldorf salad)--the dressing being\r\nsupplied; stuffed eggs; sandwiches.\r\n\r\nThe carrying out of these lessons will develop in the pupils accuracy\r\nand obedience, and make them familiar with the use and care of their\r\nutensils, as well as give opportunity for the cleaning of these and\r\nother parts of the equipment.\r\n\r\nDuring these first lessons, careful supervision should be given each\r\npupil, so that only correct habits may be formed in regard to neatness,\r\nthoroughness, quietness, and natural use of muscles.\r\n\r\nThe pupils should be encouraged to begin a book of recipes to contain\r\nneatly written copies of all they have used in school. The Art teacher\r\nmight correlate the work here by assisting them to design a suitable\r\ncover for this book.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nFORM III: SENIOR GRADE (Continued)\r\n\r\nCOOKERY\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON I\r\n\r\nAfter a number of practice lessons have developed in the pupils a\r\ncertain ability and self-confidence in working, formal cookery may be\r\nintroduced, and the following ideas should be brought out:\r\n\r\n1. The meaning of cooking:\r\n\r\n        Cooking is the application of sufficient heat\r\n        to make a change in the food.\r\n\r\n2. Reasons for cooking food:\r\n\r\n        (1) To make some food digestible.\r\n\r\n        (2) To change flavours and make some food more\r\n            appetizing.\r\n\r\n        (3) To preserve food.\r\n\r\n        (4) To kill harmful germs in food.\r\n\r\n3. Kinds of heat used:\r\n\r\n        (1) Dry heat--heat, only, is conveyed to the\r\n            food.\r\n\r\n        (2) Moist heat--heat and moisture are conveyed\r\n            to the food.\r\n\r\n4. Different ways of applying _dry heat_:\r\n\r\n        Toasting, broiling, pan-broiling, saut\xc3\xa9ing,\r\n        frying, baking.\r\n\r\n5. Different ways of applying _moist heat_:\r\n\r\n        Boiling, simmering, steaming, steeping.\r\n\r\n        NOTE.--If the class cannot name these methods,\r\n        the teacher may name and write them with only a\r\n        word of comment regarding each, or they may not\r\n        be given until the methods are studied.\r\n\r\nAs the moist heat methods are simpler and better known, they should be\r\nstudied first. The class should be led to see that some liquid must be\r\nused to supply the moisture and should account for the common use of\r\nwater for this purpose. Experiments should then be performed in heating\r\nwater, and its appearance and temperature should be noted.\r\n\r\n        NOTE.--A preliminary lesson on the use of the\r\n        thermometer may be necessary to show how to\r\n        read it, and to develop the idea that it is an\r\n        instrument for measuring heat. This may be\r\n        taught in the regular class work, previous to\r\n        the Household Management lesson.\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON ON THE THERMOMETER\r\n\r\n1. Development of the idea of "measuring":\r\n\r\nWhat would you use to measure the length of the table? A foot measure.\r\nWhat to measure the water in a tub? A pint, quart, or gallon measure.\r\nWhat to measure the amount of gas burned? A gas-meter.\r\n\r\n2. Development of the name "thermometer":\r\n\r\nWhat do we call the instrument\r\n\r\n        For measuring gas? A gas-meter\r\n\r\n        For measuring electricity? An electrometer\r\n\r\n        For measuring speed of a motor? A speedometer\r\n        (speed-meter)\r\n\r\n        For measuring the distance a bicycle travels? A\r\n        cyclometer (cycle-meter).\r\n\r\nIn each case what does "meter" mean? It means an instrument for\r\nmeasuring. What name may I give to an instrument for measuring heat? You\r\nmay call it a heat-meter.\r\n\r\nTell the pupils that, in science, many Greek words are used, and that\r\nyou will put a Greek word in place of the English word "heat", namely\r\n"thermos", as in thermos bottle. What will the name become?\r\nThermosmeter, or _thermometer_.\r\n\r\n3. Practice in using thermometers:\r\n\r\nThe unit of measurement (_degree_) should be given, and the scale taught\r\nfrom the black-board. Thermometers may then be given to the class to\r\nexamine and use.\r\n\r\nSaucepans having white inner surfaces are best to use for the\r\nexperiments, as changes made by the heat are more plainly seen.\r\n\r\n        _Observations of water under heat:_\r\n\r\n        (1) At a temperature of about 100 degrees, very\r\n            small bubbles form at the bottom and sides of\r\n            the dish and rise slowly to the surface of the\r\n            water. These bubbles are a film of water\r\n            containing the air that was in solution, which,\r\n            when expanded, rises to the top of the water.\r\n\r\n        (2) At a temperature of about 180 degrees, a\r\n            few larger bubbles form at the bottom of the\r\n            dish and rise slowly to the surface of the\r\n            water, making a slight movement in it. In these\r\n            bubbles air is replaced by steam which is\r\n            formed from the water by the heat.\r\n\r\n        (3) At a temperature of 212 degrees, a great\r\n            number of large bubbles form and rise quickly\r\n            to the surface, making much movement in the\r\n            water. The water is then said to boil.\r\n\r\n        (4) The water will take no higher temperature\r\n            than 212 degrees.\r\n\r\n        (5) After water once boils, it requires little\r\n            heat to keep it at this point, therefore the\r\n            heat may be reduced.\r\n\r\n        (6) An increase of heat increases the number,\r\n            size, and rate of the bubbles and the volume of\r\n            steam, but makes the liquid no hotter.\r\n\r\n        _Application of these observations:_\r\n\r\n        (1) If food be cooked in a liquid at its\r\n            greatest heat, where many bubbles are making\r\n            much movement in it, the process is called\r\n            _boiling_.\r\n\r\n        (2) If cooked in a liquid heated to 180-200,\r\n            where there is scarcely any movement in the\r\n            liquid, the process is called _simmering_.\r\n\r\n        (3) If cooked in the steam rising from a\r\n            boiling liquid, the process is called\r\n            _steaming_.\r\n\r\n        (4) If boiling liquid be poured over food and\r\n            no further heat applied, the process is called\r\n            _steeping_.\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSONS II, III, IV, ETC.\r\n\r\nPractice should then be given in each of the moist heat methods of\r\ncooking. The common foods, such as vegetables, fruit, eggs, and milk\r\nshould be used for this purpose.\r\n\r\nAfter the class has carried out a method for the first time, they should\r\nbe led to consider the order of work required for it. The necessary\r\nsteps should be arranged to form a set of rules for reference. The\r\neffects of the method in each case should also be noted.\r\n\r\nWhen the moist heat methods are well known, the dry heat methods should\r\nbe taught and practised. The outlines on pages 73-81 will suggest the\r\ndevelopment under each method.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN OF LESSON ON BOILING CARROTS\r\n\r\n\r\nAIM\r\n\r\nTo apply the principles of boiling, as taught in a previous lesson, to\r\nthe cooking of food.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIME LIMIT\r\n\r\nOne and one-half hours to be used approximately as follows: twenty-five\r\nminutes for preparation for practical work and the first part of the\r\npractical work, twenty-five minutes for the development of ideas of\r\nboiling as a method of cooking, fifteen minutes for the serving of food,\r\ntwenty-five minutes for housekeeping.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARATION FOR PRACTICAL WORK\r\n\r\n1. Review.--Question the pupils as follows: What kind of heat is used in\r\ncooking food by boiling? At what temperature is the food cooked by this\r\nmethod? Name the kinds of boiling. How much hotter is rapid boiling? How\r\nis water made to boil rapidly? When is rapid boiling useful?\r\n\r\n2. Discussion of recipe.--Have the recipe written on the black-board and\r\nread by one of the pupils, while the others follow the reading\r\ncarefully.\r\n\r\n        (1) Have the class decide:\r\n            (_a_) When the fires should be lighted\r\n            (_b_) The dishes required for the work\r\n            (_c_) The kind of boiling to use.\r\n\r\n        (2) Demonstrate the scrubbing, scraping, and\r\n            dicing of a carrot, also the draining of a food\r\n            cooked in liquid.\r\n\r\n        (3) State the quantity of ingredients each will\r\n            use.\r\n\r\n        (4) Caution the pupils as to accuracy, neatness,\r\n            and quietness while working.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRACTICAL WORK\r\n\r\nHave each pupil prepare the food according to the recipe and put it on\r\nto cook within a certain time. While the class works, carefully observe\r\neach pupil and give individual help to those who require it.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT OF THE IDEAS OF BOILING AS A METHOD OF COOKING\r\n\r\nThis will be done while the carrots are cooking. The ideas brought out\r\nfrom review and the class work, by questioning, will be those which are\r\ngiven on boiling under the methods of cooking.\r\n\r\n1. Definition of boiling\r\n\r\n2.

Effects of boiling.\r\n\r\nAs these ideas are obtained from the class, they should be written by\r\nthe teacher on the black-board and by the pupils in their note-books.\r\n\r\n\r\nSERVING\r\n\r\nThe pupils will drain, season, and serve the food. Each girl will set\r\none place on the wooden part of the table and serve herself. While the\r\nfood is being eaten, the table manners of each girl should be observed,\r\nand, if necessary, corrected in a tactful manner.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOUSEKEEPING\r\n\r\nThe work of putting the kitchen in order may be done in groups of twos\r\nor fours.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPE: BOILED CARROTS\r\n\r\n        Carrots\r\n        Boiling water\r\n        Salt and pepper\r\n        Butter.\r\n\r\n1. Scrub, scrape, and rinse the carrots.\r\n\r\n2. Cut them into pieces by dicing them.\r\n\r\n3. Put the pieces in a saucepan, set over the fire, and pour in boiling\r\nwater until the food is covered.\r\n\r\n4. Cook the carrots until the pieces are soft at the centre when pierced\r\nwith a fork.\r\n\r\n5. Drain off the liquid, then season the food with salt, pepper, and\r\nbutter.\r\n\r\n6. Serve in a hot vegetable dish.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLAN OF LESSON ON SIMMERING: APPLES\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION\r\n\r\n1. Review:\r\n\r\n        (1) Appearance and temperature of a boiling\r\n            liquid.\r\n\r\n        (2) Appearance and temperature of a simmering\r\n            liquid.\r\n\r\n2. State the difficulty of keeping a liquid at simmering temperature;\r\nshow the double boiler and explain its use for this purpose.\r\n\r\n3. Compare boiling and simmering as to length of time required and\r\ndifficulty.\r\n\r\n4. Tell the pupils they are going to study simmering by making Coddled\r\nApples.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISCUSSION OF RECIPE\r\n\r\n1. Read recipe.\r\n\r\n2. Question regarding:\r\n\r\n        (1) Kind of heat used\r\n\r\n        (2) Whether to prepare apples or syrup first,\r\n            and why\r\n\r\n        (3) Management in measuring so as to use only\r\n            one cup\r\n\r\n        (4) Why one quantity of syrup is sufficient for\r\n            so many apples.\r\n\r\n3. Decide on the dishes required for the work.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRACTICAL WORK\r\n\r\nAssign work in groups of twos--numbers one and three prepare syrup;\r\nnumbers two and four prepare apples; all attend to the cooking.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT OF IDEAS OF SIMMERING\r\n\r\n(To be dealt with while food is cooking)\r\n\r\n1. Definition.--Obtain this by comparing simmering with boiling.\r\n\r\n2. Effects:\r\n\r\n        (1) Compare a raw and simmered apple to get the\r\n            idea of "soft and tender".\r\n\r\n        (2) Tell the pupils simmering temperature will\r\n            not harden and toughen meat and eggs as much as\r\n            boiling does.\r\n\r\n        (3) Lying longer in the liquid to cook\r\n            dissolves out more of the food substance.\r\n\r\n        (4) Less water going off as vapour does not\r\n            carry away as much flavour.\r\n\r\n        (5) Less motion in the liquid does not break up\r\n            the food.\r\n\r\n\r\nSERVING\r\n\r\nWhen the apples are tender, let each girl serve herself with what she\r\nhas cooked. While the fruit is being eaten, direct attention to the\r\nflavour of apple in the syrup.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOUSEKEEPING\r\n\r\nAssign the work which is necessary to put the kitchen in order, and\r\nallow the pupils to carry it out in groups of twos or fours.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPE (INDIVIDUAL): CODDLED APPLES\r\n\r\n        1 apple\r\n        1/4 c. sugar\r\n        1/2 c. water.\r\n\r\n1. Put the sugar and water in the inside part of a double boiler, set\r\nover the fire, and boil gently for about five minutes.\r\n\r\n2. Wash and pare the apple, cut it into halves, and remove the core.\r\n\r\n3. Put the prepared fruit into the syrup, cover the dish closely, and\r\nset in the under part of the double boiler.\r\n\r\n4. Simmer the pieces of apple until tender, turning them occasionally.\r\n\r\n5. Lift the fruit carefully into a serving dish, then pour the syrup\r\nover it.\r\n\r\n6. Serve hot or cold.\r\n\r\n        NOTE.--One cup of sugar will make sufficient\r\n        syrup for six or seven apples.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF COOKING: DETAILS\r\n\r\nBOILING\r\n\r\n1. Definition:\r\n\r\nBoiling is a method of cooking in which the heat reaches the food\r\nthrough a boiling liquid.\r\n\r\n2. Kinds of boiling:\r\n\r\n        (1) Gentle boiling--temperature of 212 degrees.\r\n\r\n        (2) Rapid boiling--temperature of 212 degrees.\r\n\r\n3. Uses of rapid boiling:\r\n\r\n        (1) To make much steam\r\n\r\n        (2) To break up food\r\n\r\n        (3) To keep small particles of food in motion.\r\n\r\n4. Rules for boiling:\r\n\r\n        (1) Put the food in a cooking dish, set over\r\n            the heat, and pour in the boiling liquid to\r\n            cover the food well.\r\n\r\n        (2) Regulate the heat to the kind of boiling\r\n            required.\r\n\r\n        (3) Keep the food boiling during the entire\r\n            cooking.\r\n\r\n        (4) Continue the cooking until the food is\r\n            tender at the centre when it is tested, or for\r\n            the time required by the recipe.\r\n\r\n        (5) When the food is cooked, lift it from the\r\n            liquid or drain the liquid from the food.\r\n\r\n5. Effects of boiling:\r\n\r\n        (1) It makes some food soft and tender--fruit,\r\n            vegetables.\r\n\r\n        (2) It makes some food hard and tough--eggs, etc.\r\n\r\n        (3) It breaks up food.\r\n\r\n        (4) It dissolves out some of the food substance.\r\n\r\n        (5) It causes some loss of flavour (in the steam).\r\n\r\n        (6) It kills germs.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIMMERING\r\n\r\n1. Definition:\r\n\r\nSimmering is a method of cooking in a liquid at a temperature of about\r\n180 degrees.\r\n\r\n2. Rules for simmering:\r\n\r\n        (1) Use a double boiler to keep the temperature\r\n            correct.\r\n\r\n        (2) Put the food in liquid in the top dish, and\r\n            proceed as in boiling.\r\n\r\n3. Effects of simmering:\r\n\r\n        (1) It makes some foods soft and tender--fruit\r\n            and vegetables.\r\n\r\n        (2) It does not make the protein of animal food\r\n            (milk, eggs, and meat) hard as boiling does.\r\n\r\n        (3) It dissolves out a good deal of the food\r\n            substance into the cooking liquid.\r\n\r\n        (4) It causes very little loss of flavour.\r\n\r\n        (5) It does not break up the food.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEAMING\r\n\r\n1. Definition:\r\n\r\nSteaming is a method of cooking in the steam from boiling liquid.\r\n\r\n2. Rules for steaming:\r\n\r\n        (1) Have the water boiling rapidly in the under\r\n            part of the steamer.\r\n\r\n        (2) Put the food in the upper part, cover\r\n            closely, and place over the lower part.\r\n\r\n        (3) Keep the water boiling rapidly during the\r\n            entire cooking.\r\n\r\n        (4) If extra water be needed, only boiling\r\n            water should be added, as quickly and as gently\r\n            as possible.\r\n\r\n        (5) Continue the cooking according to the time\r\n            required by the recipe, or test as in boiling,\r\n            if the food permits.\r\n\r\n3. Effects of steaming:\r\n\r\n        (1) It makes vegetable food tender.\r\n\r\n        (2) It makes the protein of animal food harder\r\n            than simmering, but not so hard as boiling\r\n            does.\r\n\r\n        (3) It does not break up the food.\r\n\r\n        (4) It does not dissolve out the food\r\n            substance.\r\n\r\n        (5) It causes little loss of flavour if closely\r\n            covered.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEEPING\r\n\r\n1. Definition:\r\n\r\nSteeping is a method of cooking, by pouring boiling water over food, and\r\nletting it stand in a moderately warm place.\r\n\r\n2. Rules for steeping:\r\n\r\n        (1) Heat the steeping dish.\r\n\r\n        (2) Use water freshly boiled.\r\n\r\n        (3) Put the food in the hot dish, pour water\r\n            over, cover closely, and set in a warm place.\r\n\r\n        (4) Let the food remain in the liquid until you\r\n            have extracted what is desired.\r\n\r\n        (5) Strain off the liquid and use as required.\r\n\r\n3. Effects of steeping:\r\n\r\n        (1) To heat and soften the food.\r\n\r\n        (2) To extract the flavour and, sometimes, the\r\n            substance of the food.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOASTING\r\n\r\n1. Definition:\r\n\r\nToasting is a method of cooking in which the heat reaches the food\r\ndirectly from the fire. It is used mainly for bread.\r\n\r\n2. Rules for toasting:\r\n\r\n        (1) Have a clear, hot fire.\r\n\r\n        (2) Cut bread in slices from one third to one\r\n            half an inch thick.\r\n\r\n        (3) Hold the food at some distance from the\r\n            fire, in a gentle heat at first, to dry and\r\n            heat the surfaces. This drying may be done in\r\n           the oven.\r\n\r\n        (4) Then hold the dried, hot surfaces in a\r\n            strong heat, to brown and crisp them.\r\n\r\n        (5) Serve so that the surfaces will not become\r\n            steamed from the moisture still contained in\r\n            the slices. Put the toast in a toast-rack or\r\n            stack it on a hot plate. Buttered toast may be\r\n            piled.\r\n\r\n3. Effects of toasting:\r\n\r\n        (1) To heat and dry the surface of the food.\r\n\r\n        (2) To brown and crisp the surface.\r\n\r\n        (3) To change the flavour.\r\n\r\n        (4) To change the starch of the surface into a\r\n            brown substance, which is a form of sugar, and\r\n            more digestible than starch.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROILING\r\n\r\n1. Definition:\r\n\r\nBroiling is a method of cooking in which the heat reaches the food\r\ndirectly. It is used mainly for meat and fish in slices or thin\r\nportions.\r\n\r\n2. Rules for broiling:\r\n\r\n        (1) Have a clear, hot fire.\r\n\r\n        (2) Grease the broiler and trim the food.\r\n\r\n        (3) Lay the food in the broiler compactly.\r\n\r\n        (4) Hold the broiler in a very strong heat to\r\n            seal the tubes of the food which hold the\r\n            juices, and turn frequently.\r\n\r\n        (5) When the surface is seared, hold in a\r\n            gentler heat to cook the food to the centre,\r\n            and turn occasionally while doing this.\r\n\r\n        (6) Time the cooking to the thickness of the\r\n            food--one inch of thickness cooks rare in eight\r\n            minutes.\r\n\r\n        (7) Serve at once on a hot dish, and spread\r\n            with butter, salt, and pepper.\r\n\r\n3. Effects of broiling:\r\n\r\n        (1) To sear the surface.\r\n\r\n        (2) To cook to the centre while browning the\r\n            surface.\r\n\r\n        (3) To change the flavour and develop a very\r\n            delicious one in the browned surface.\r\n\r\n        (4) To make the browned surface hard to digest.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAN-BROILING\r\n\r\n1. Definition:\r\n\r\nPan-broiling is an imitation of broiling and is a method of cooking on a\r\nhissing-hot, metal surface.\r\n\r\n2. Rules for pan-broiling:\r\n\r\n        (1) Have a hot fire.\r\n\r\n        (2) Heat the pan or metal surface until it\r\n            hisses when touched with water.\r\n\r\n        (3) Lay the food in compactly, and turn\r\n            constantly until the entire surface is seared.\r\n\r\n        (4) Place the pan in a gentle heat and cook the\r\n            food to the centre, turning occasionally.\r\n\r\n        (5) Time the cooking to the thickness of the\r\n            food--one inch cooks rare in ten minutes.\r\n\r\n        (6) Serve at once, as in broiling.\r\n\r\n3. Effects of pan-broiling:\r\n\r\nThe same as in broiling.\r\n\r\n\r\nSAUT\xc3\x89ING\r\n\r\n1. Definition:\r\n\r\nSaut\xc3\xa9ing is a method of cooking in which the heat reaches the food\r\nthrough a smoking-hot, greased surface.\r\n\r\n2. Rules for saut\xc3\xa9ing:\r\n\r\n        (1) Heat the pan enough to melt the fat.\r\n\r\n        (2) Put in just enough fat to keep the food\r\n            from sticking, and let it run over the surface\r\n            of the pan, and get smoking hot.\r\n\r\n        (3) Put in the food and let it brown on one\r\n            side, then turn it and brown the other side.\r\n\r\n        (4) Serve on a hot dish.\r\n\r\n3. Effects of saut\xc3\xa9ing:\r\n\r\n        (1) To sear the surface of the food.\r\n\r\n        (2) To brown the surface and develop a\r\n            delicious flavour, while cooking to the centre.\r\n\r\n        (3) To make the surface slightly fat-soaked\r\n            with fat which has been very highly heated.\r\n\r\n        (4) To make the surface indigestible.\r\n\r\n\r\nBAKING\r\n\r\n1. Definition:\r\n\r\nBaking is a method of cooking in which the heat is brought to the food\r\nthrough the confined heat of an oven.\r\n\r\n2. Kinds of ovens:\r\n\r\n        (1) Slow.\r\n\r\n        (2) Moderate--white paper browns in ten minutes.\r\n\r\n        (3) Hot--white paper browns in five minutes.\r\n\r\n        (4) Very hot--white paper browns in one minute.\r\n\r\n3. Rules for baking:\r\n\r\n        (1) Heat the oven according to the recipe.\r\n\r\n        (2) Put the food in the oven, usually on the\r\n            lower shelf, to get an under heat first, then\r\n            toward the last of the cooking, set it on the\r\n            top shelf to brown.\r\n\r\n        (3) Watch carefully during the baking, but in\r\n            opening the oven door, be gentle and quick.\r\n\r\n        (4) If the oven gets too hot, set a pan of cold\r\n            water in it, or leave the door slightly open.\r\n            If browning too quickly, cover the surface with\r\n            brown paper.\r\n\r\n        (5) Cook the food according to the time\r\n            required by the recipe, or until it is done, as\r\n            shown by some test.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRYING\r\n\r\n1. Definition:\r\n\r\nFrying is a method of cooking in which the heat is brought to the food\r\nby immersing it in smoking-hot fat.\r\n\r\n2. Temperature for frying:\r\n\r\n        (1) For cooked foods which have only to brown\r\n            and warm through--about 400 degrees.\r\n\r\n        (2) For raw foods which have to cook--about 350\r\n            degrees.\r\n\r\n3. Rules for frying:\r\n\r\n        (1) Use a deep iron, steel, or granite kettle,\r\n            which will hold the heat.\r\n\r\n        (2) Put in sufficient fat to cover the food\r\n            well, but never fill the kettle more than\r\n            two-thirds full.\r\n\r\n        (3) Heat the fat to the desired temperature.\r\n\r\n        (4) Have the food as dry as possible and not\r\n            very cold.\r\n\r\n        (5) When the fat begins to give off a small\r\n            quantity of _white_ vapour, test it for the\r\n            required heat, as follows:\r\n            (_a_) For raw food, put in a small square of\r\n                  bread, and allow it sixty seconds to brown.\r\n            (_b_) For cooked food, allow a square of bread\r\n                  forty seconds to brown.\r\n\r\n        (6) Put the food carefully into the hot fat, and\r\n            only an amount which will not cool it too much.\r\n\r\n        (7) When the food is nicely browned, lift it\r\n            from the fat with an open spoon or lifter and\r\n            drain over the pot until it stops dripping.\r\n\r\n        (8) Lay the food on crumpled brown paper or\r\n            blotting paper, to absorb any fat still clinging\r\n            to the surface.\r\n\r\n        (9) Strain the fat through cheesecloth and set\r\n            it away to cool.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. Effects of frying:\r\n\r\n        (1) To sear the surface and prevent it from\r\n            absorbing fat.\r\n\r\n        (2) To cook or heat the food to the centre.\r\n\r\n        (3) To brown the surface of the food and make\r\n            it crisp.\r\n\r\n        (4) To develop a delicious flavour in the\r\n            browned surface.\r\n\r\n        (5) To make the browned surface indigestible,\r\n            because it has absorbed highly-heated fat.\r\n\r\n        NOTE.--As frying requires the fat used to be at\r\n        a very high temperature, it is dangerous to let\r\n        young children take the responsibility in this\r\n        method of cooking. For this reason, it may be\r\n        wise to defer lessons on frying until the\r\n        Fourth Form, or even later.\r\n\r\nFor practice in the methods of cooking, the following is suggestive:\r\n\r\nBoiling.--Cooking of any vegetable or fruit in season or rice, macaroni,\r\neggs, coffee\r\n\r\nSimmering.--Dried fruit, such as prunes, peaches, apricots, apples;\r\nstrong-smelling vegetables, such as cabbage, onions; porridge; stew\r\n\r\nSteaming.--Potatoes, cauliflower, apples, peaches, cup-puddings,\r\ndumplings, fish\r\n\r\nSteeping.--Tea, coffee, lemon rind for sauce\r\n\r\nToasting.--Bread, rolls\r\n\r\nBroiling.--Steak, fish\r\n\r\nPan-broiling.--Steak\r\n\r\nSaut\xc3\xa9ing.--Sliced potatoes, potato cakes, hash cakes, griddle-cakes\r\n(teacher prepares the batter)\r\n\r\nBaking.--Apples, bananas, potatoes, scalloped potatoes, scalloped\r\ntomatoes, cheese crackers, drop biscuits, beef-loaf\r\n\r\nFrying.--Potatoes, cod-fish balls, doughnuts (teacher prepares the\r\ndough).\r\n\r\nThe lessons which give practice in the methods of cooking will also\r\nafford excellent drills in _measuring_, _manipulation_, and _cleaning_.\r\nThroughout all these, the weak points of individual members of the class\r\nshould receive careful attention. In the case of typical defects, much\r\ntime may be saved by calling the attention of the class to these,\r\ninstead of correcting them individually.\r\n\r\nAfter the pupils have considered and practised the methods of cooking,\r\nthey should be able to prepare any simple dish of one main ingredient,\r\nfor which recipes should be given. If these cannot be used at school,\r\nthey may be of service in the homes of the pupils.\r\n\r\nEconomy should be emphasized by suggesting simple ways of using\r\nleft-overs, and definite recipes should be written for these. Fancy\r\ncooking should be discouraged. The teacher should aim to show how the\r\nnecessary common foods may be prepared in a nutritious and attractive\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nIn this first year of practical work, _the main point is the formation\r\nof correct habits of work_. Cleanliness, neatness, and accuracy should\r\nbe insisted on in every lesson, and deftness should be encouraged.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIONS FOR THE USE OF LEFT-OVERS\r\n\r\n\r\nBREAD\r\n\r\n1.

If the\r\nsubject be not taken as a whole, each beverage may be taught\r\nincidentally, when a recipe requiring little time is useful. The\r\nfollowing will suggest an outline of facts for a formal lesson:\r\n\r\n\r\nMEANING OF BEVERAGES\r\n\r\nA beverage is a liquid suitable for drinking. Water is the natural\r\nbeverage; other beverages are water with ingredients added to supply\r\nfood, flavour, stimulant, or colour. Since water is tasteless in itself\r\nand also an excellent solvent, it is especially useful in making\r\nbeverages.\r\n\r\n\r\nKINDS OF BEVERAGES\r\n\r\n1. Refreshing.--Pure cold water, all cold fruit drinks\r\n\r\n2. Stimulating.--All hot drinks, tea, coffee, beef-tea, alcoholic drinks\r\n\r\n3. Nutritious.--Milk, cocoa, chocolate, oatmeal and barley water, tea\r\nand coffee with sugar and cream.\r\n\r\n        NOTE.--As tea, coffee, and cocoa are ordinary\r\n        household beverages, they should be specially\r\n        studied. Their sources and manufacture will\r\n        have been learned in Form III Junior, but their\r\n        use as beverages may now be discussed and\r\n        practised. It is desirable that the pupils be\r\n        led to reason out correct methods of cooking\r\n        each.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEA\r\n\r\n1. Description.--The leaves contain, beside a stimulant and flavour, an\r\nundesirable substance known as tannin, which is injurious to the\r\ndelicate lining of the stomach. If the tea be properly made, the tannin\r\nis not extracted.\r\n\r\n2. Method of cooking.--Steep the tea from three to five minutes, then\r\nseparate the leaves from the liquid (suggest ways of doing this).\r\nBoiling is not a correct method to use for making tea, as it extracts\r\nthe tannin and causes loss of flavour in the steam.\r\n\r\n        NOTE.--Because of the stimulant, young people\r\n        should not drink tea or coffee.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOFFEE\r\n\r\n1. Description.--The beans, or seeds, of coffee also contain tannin as\r\nwell as a stimulant and flavour. This beverage is more expensive than\r\ntea, since a much larger amount must be used for one cup of liquid.\r\nAfter the beans are broken by grinding, the air causes the flavour to\r\ndeteriorate, so that the housekeeper should grind the beans as required,\r\nor buy in small quantities and keep in tightly covered cans.\r\n\r\n2. Method of cooking.--Coffee may be cooked in different ways, according\r\nto the size of the pieces into which the roasted beans are broken. These\r\npieces are much harder than the leaves of tea, hence coffee may be given\r\na higher temperature and a longer time in cooking than tea. Small pieces\r\nof beans are apt to float in the liquid, making it cloudy; this may be\r\novercome by the use of egg-white or by careful handling.\r\n\r\nCoarsely ground coffee must be boiled gently. Finely ground coffee may\r\nbe boiled gently or steeped. Very finely ground, or powdered coffee\r\nshould be steeped or filtered with boiling water.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOCOA\r\n\r\n1. Description.--This contains a stimulant, but differs from tea and\r\ncoffee in being nutritious. It makes a desirable drink for children.\r\n\r\n2. Method of cooking.--Cocoa contains starch and should be simmered or\r\ngently boiled.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHOCOLATE\r\n\r\nThis substance is the same as cocoa, except that it contains a much\r\nlarger amount of fat.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE SETTING\r\n\r\nThe serving of food is incidentally a necessary part of nearly every\r\nlesson in cookery, as the pupils usually eat what they prepare. In\r\nregular class work the bare work table is used, and each pupil prepares\r\na place for herself only. The dishes soiled during the lesson should be\r\nplaced on the section covered with metal or glass at the back of the\r\ntable, and the front, or wooden part, cleared to be used as a dining\r\ntable. The teacher should insist on this part being clean and neatly\r\narranged. The few dishes used should be the most suitable selected from\r\nthe individual equipments, and they should be as carefully placed as for\r\na meal. From the very first, the pupils should be trained to habits of\r\nneatness in setting the table, and in serving the food; and, what is\r\nmost important, they should be trained to eat in a refined manner. Lack\r\nof time is sometimes given as an excuse for neglecting this training in\r\nthe usual cookery lessons; but if the teacher insists upon neatness in\r\nwork and good table manners, the pupils will soon learn to comply\r\nwithout loss of time.\r\n\r\nLaying a table may be formally taught at any stage of the work of Form\r\nIII, but it is most suitable after the class is capable of preparing the\r\nfood for a simple home meal. The topics of the lesson may be presented\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARATION\r\n\r\n1. See that the dining-room is well aired and in order.\r\n\r\n2. See that the linen is clean and carefully laundered.\r\n\r\n3. See that the glass, silver, and steel are polished.\r\n\r\n4. Decide on the number to be served.\r\n\r\n\r\nARRANGEMENT\r\n\r\n1. Place a silence cloth of felt, woollen, or thick cotton:\r\n\r\n        (1) To prevent the dishes from making a noise\r\n\r\n        (2) To give the table a better appearance\r\n\r\n        (3) To preserve the table top.\r\n\r\n2. Lay the cloth, placing the centre of the cloth in the centre of the\r\ntable and spreading it smoothly, having its folds parallel with the\r\nedges of the table.\r\n\r\n3. Arrange a centre-piece, using a vase or basket of flowers, a small\r\nplant or a dish of fruit.\r\n\r\n4. Put a plate at each person\'s place and lay the cutlery and silver\r\nbeside it about one inch from the edge of the table, in the order of\r\nuse, those used first on the outside, or farthest from the plate. At\r\ndinner these plates are usually placed before the one who serves.\r\n\r\n        (1) Place the knives at the right side, with\r\n            the sharp edges toward the plate.\r\n\r\n        (2) Place the forks at the left side, with the\r\n            tines up.\r\n\r\n        (3) Place the soup spoons at the right of the\r\n            knife, bowl up.\r\n\r\n        (4) Place the dessert spoons in front of the\r\n            plates, the handle to the right, the bowl up.\r\n\r\n        (5) Place the dessert forks with the other\r\n            forks, or in front of the plates with the\r\n            dessert spoons.\r\n\r\n5. Place the water glasses at the end of the knife blades, top up.\r\n\r\n6. Place the bread and butter plates at the left of the forks. (These\r\nare not necessary at dinner.)\r\n\r\n7. Place the napkins at the left, neatly folded; discourage fancy\r\nfolding.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Table laid for a home dinner]\r\n\r\n8. Place the salt and pepper so that they are convenient to every one.\r\n\r\n9. Place the dishes that are to be served at table directly in front of\r\nthe one who is to serve them.\r\n\r\n10. Place the carving set in front of the host, and the tablespoons as\r\non page 89, or where food is to be served.\r\n\r\n11. Place a chair for each person.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Individual section of table laid for dinner]\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE MANNERS\r\n\r\nIn Form III, the children are too young to serve at table, so the lesson\r\non Preparing and Serving Meals, page 136, has been reserved for the work\r\nof Form IV, Junior Grade. The class should, however, be carefully\r\ntrained in table manners from the first. In their usual class work this\r\nwill be incidentally taught. A regular lesson should include the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n\r\nRULES FOR CORRECT TABLE MANNERS\r\n\r\nThese are based upon the accepted customs of well-bred people, and have\r\nin view the convenience and comfort of all who are at the table.\r\n\r\nThey may be stated as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Stand behind the seat assigned you.\r\n\r\n2. Wait until the hostess is seated, before taking a seat.\r\n\r\n3. Sit naturally erect, without any support from the elbows, placing the\r\nfeet on the floor.\r\n\r\n4. Do not begin to eat until others are served.\r\n\r\n5. Eat and drink quietly, taking small mouthfuls; keep the mouth closed\r\nwhile eating.\r\n\r\n6. Do not drink with food in the mouth.\r\n\r\n7. Do not talk with food in the mouth.\r\n\r\n8. Use a fork preferably, whenever it will serve the purpose; and never\r\nput a knife into the mouth.\r\n\r\n9. Take soup from the side of the spoon.\r\n\r\n10. Wipe the mouth before drinking from a glass.\r\n\r\n11. Be attentive to the needs of others.\r\n\r\n12. If it be necessary to leave the table, ask the hostess to excuse\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n13. If a guest for one meal only, leave the napkin unfolded beside the\r\nplate.\r\n\r\n14. Never use a toothpick at the table, or in any company.\r\n\r\n15. Wait for the hostess to rise, then stand, and replace the chair in\r\nposition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nFORM IV: JUNIOR GRADE\r\n\r\nTHE KITCHEN\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the year\'s work in Form IV, several lessons should\r\nbe spent in reviewing the methods of cooking and cleaning taught in the\r\nprevious year. This may be done by reviewing former recipes and by using\r\nnew ones which require a knowledge of these methods. As the pupils work,\r\nthey should be closely observed, and, without the teacher giving undue\r\nassistance, their weak points should be carefully strengthened. The\r\nlength of time spent on the review will vary according to the ability of\r\nthe class. This can be plainly judged by their habits of work. The new\r\nrecipes given them should be such as they are likely to use at home, so\r\nas to encourage home practice. These recipes will also enlarge their\r\ncollection in their special recipe books. Some of the following may be\r\nuseful: creamed potatoes, potato omelet, stuffed potatoes, stuffed\r\nonions, corn oysters, baked tomatoes, spaghetti with tomato sauce,\r\nmacaroni and cheese, scalloped apples, plain rice pudding, ginger\r\npudding, sago pudding, tapioca cream.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KITCHEN FIRE\r\n\r\nUp to this time the pupils have been allowed to manage their individual\r\ntable stoves or a gas range. They should now be taught to understand and\r\nto use an ordinary coal or wood range. Two lessons will be necessary for\r\nthis purpose. After each lesson has been taught, the remainder of the\r\nperiod should be spent in some kind of practical work which can be\r\naccomplished in the time. Some cookery which requires only a few minutes\r\nmay be reviewed, such as tea, cocoa, coffee, toast, bacon, apple sauce;\r\ndrawers and cupboards may be cleaned; silver and steel may be polished;\r\ndesigns for wall-paper, dishes, curtains, and dress materials may be\r\ndrawn; household accounts may be computed; sewing may be finished.\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON I\r\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS OF A KITCHEN FIRE\r\n\r\nIn introducing a lesson on the kitchen fire, ask the pupils to imagine\r\nthat they have built a new house, which the workmen have just vacated.\r\nBefore they can move in it must be cleaned. What kind of water is best\r\nfor cleaning? Hot water. What is necessary to provide hot water? A fire.\r\n\r\nFind out from the pupils and then write on the black-board what is\r\nnecessary for a fire. What is the first requisite? Something to burn.\r\nWhat do we call such a substance? _Fuel._ Where shall we put the fuel?\r\nIn a _stove_. Why is a stove necessary? To confine the fire.\r\n\r\nUsing a candle as fuel and a lamp chimney as a stove, light the candle\r\nand place it in the chimney. It burns only a short time and then dies\r\nout. Why? Because the oxygen of the air in the chimney is all exhausted.\r\nThen what is another requisite for a fire? _Oxygen._\r\n\r\nImagine the room to be a stove and the chairs, books, tables, etc., to\r\nbe fuel. The air in the room also contains much oxygen, so that in this\r\nroom we have three requisites for a fire. It is very fortunate for us\r\nthat something else is needed. We shall try to find out what it is.\r\n\r\nWatch while I hold these strips of paper over this lighted gas stove\r\nhigh enough to be out of reach of the flame. What happened to them? They\r\nburst into a flame. What did the paper that I held receive that it did\r\nnot get when it was lying on the table? Heat. We shall try a match in\r\nthe same way, also some thin shavings. They also burn when they receive\r\nheat from the fire. Then what is another requisite for a fire? _Heat._\r\nName all of the requisites for a kitchen fire. _Fuel_, _stove_,\r\n_oxygen_, and _heat_.\r\n\r\n        NOTE.--Just here it is a good thing to impress\r\n        the care that is necessary in regard to\r\n        gasolene, coal-oil, benzine, etc., or any\r\n        substance that burns at a low temperature.\r\n        Bring out the fact very clearly that it is the\r\n        heat that makes fuel burn, that a flame is not\r\n        necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEAT\r\n\r\nExperiments to show on what the amount of heat required depends:\r\n\r\n1. Heat together two strips of paper of the same size but of different\r\nthicknesses and observe which burns first.\r\n\r\n2. Heat together a strip of very thin paper and a match which is much\r\nthicker than the paper, and observe which burns first.\r\n\r\n3. Rub a match vigorously on some surface and observe the result.\r\n\r\nConclusions.--1. The amount of heat required to make fuel burn depends\r\non:\r\n\r\n        (1) The thickness of the fuel.\r\n\r\n        (2) The substance composing the fuel.\r\n\r\n2. Some substances burn at a very low temperature.\r\n\r\n        NOTE.--This will explain the order of laying\r\n        the fuel for a fire and the use of a match in\r\n        lighting it.\r\n\r\n\r\nOXYGEN\r\n\r\nExperiments to show the means of obtaining oxygen:\r\n\r\n1. Light a candle, set the lamp chimney over it and observe the result.\r\n\r\n2. Raise the chimney by supporting it on two small pieces of wood. Note\r\nthe result.\r\n\r\n3. Cover the raised chimney with a piece of cardboard. Note the result.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Experiments to show the necessity for oxygen]\r\n\r\nConclusions.--1. A fresh supply of oxygen is constantly required.\r\n\r\n2. Two openings are required to ensure a constant supply of oxygen, one\r\nbelow the fuel and one above it.\r\n\r\n3. Oxygen is obtained from the surrounding air.\r\n\r\n4. The passage of air through these openings creates a draught.\r\n\r\nIt will be necessary next to lead the class to see that the supply of\r\noxygen can be controlled:\r\n\r\n1. By the relation of the openings:\r\n\r\n        (1) Openings directly opposite each other cause\r\n            a rapid circulation of air or a "direct\r\n            draught".\r\n\r\n        (2) Indirect openings cause a slower\r\n            circulation of air or an "indirect draught".\r\n\r\n2. By a cross current of air which tends to check the draught.\r\n\r\n\r\nFUELS\r\n\r\nA discussion of the fuels may next be taken. With pupils of Form IV it\r\nwill not be wise to go into too many details regarding these. Besides\r\nthe classification of the commonest ones, they may be compared from the\r\nstandpoints of cost, and of the time and labour required in their use.\r\n\r\nClasses of Fuels:\r\n\r\n        Liquid--coal-oil, gasolene, alcohol\r\n\r\n        Solid--coal (coke), wood (charcoal)\r\n\r\n        Gaseous--natural gas, coal gas.\r\n\r\n        NOTE.--Electricity is a means of producing\r\n        heat, but cannot be called a fuel.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KITCHEN STOVE\r\n\r\nLESSON II\r\n\r\nIn developing the construction of a practical coal or wood range, it is\r\na good idea to use the black-board and make a rough drawing to\r\nillustrate the details, as they are given by the pupils. These details\r\nshould be evolved from the knowledge gained in the preceding lessons,\r\nand the drawing should not be an illustration of any particular stove.\r\n\r\nAfter the best practical stove, according to the pupils\' ideas, has been\r\nthought out and represented on the black-board, they should examine and\r\ncriticise the school range and the stoves at home. They are then ready\r\nto be given the responsibility of managing any ordinary range.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe following are the necessary details to be considered regarding a\r\nkitchen stove:\r\n\r\nMaterial.--(1) Iron, (2) steel\r\n\r\nShape.--Rectangular.\r\n\r\nCompartments.--(1) Fire-box, (2) ash-box, (3) oven, (4) passage for hot\r\nair, (5) other compartments if desired, such as water tank, warming\r\ncloset, etc.\r\n\r\nDampers.--(1) Front damper--below the fuel, to control the entrance of\r\noxygen to the fuel. (2) Oven damper--above the fuel at the entrance to\r\nthe pipe, to control the heat for the oven, and also to control the\r\ndraught. (3) Check damper--at the front of the stove above the fuel, to\r\nadmit a cross current of air to check the draught.\r\n\r\nManagement of the stove.--(1) Lighting the fire, (2) heating the oven,\r\n(3) arranging for over night, (4) cleaning and care.\r\n\r\n        NOTE.--Openings below the level of the fire\r\n        increase the draught, and those above the level\r\n        check it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A kitchen coal or wood range, showing, (_a_) oven damper\r\nopen]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A kitchen coal or wood range, showing, (_b_) oven damper\r\nclosed]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRELESS COOKER\r\n\r\nThroughout the training given in Household Management, the teacher\r\nshould emphasize the value of labour-saving devices and aids in the\r\nhome. How to economize time and energy should be a prominent feature of\r\nevery practical lesson. If time permit, a lesson may be taken to\r\nconsider specially such aids as are readily procurable, together with\r\ntheir average cost. In this lesson the fireless cooker is considered.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A fireless cooker]\r\n\r\nThe principles of the fireless cooker are based on a knowledge of the\r\nlaws governing the conduction and radiation of heat. For this reason, an\r\nelementary science lesson relating to these laws should precede this\r\nlesson. Such a science lesson is part of the regular grade work of Form\r\nIV, so if a specialist teaches the Household Management of that grade,\r\nshe and the regular teacher should arrange to co-ordinate their\r\nlessons.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCIPLES OF THE FIRELESS COOKER\r\n\r\n1. It furnishes no heat, but conserves the heat which is in the food\r\nwhen it is put into the cooker.\r\n\r\n2. It conserves the heat in the food, by surrounding it with substances\r\nwhich are poor conductors of heat.\r\n\r\n3. Extra heat may be given the food, after it is put in the cooker, by\r\nplacing heated stone plates above and below the dish that contains the\r\nfood. The stone used for this purpose must be a good absorbent of heat.\r\n\r\n\r\nREASONS FOR THE USE OF THE FIRELESS COOKER\r\n\r\n        1. It saves fuel and is therefore economical.\r\n\r\n        2. It saves time, because it requires no\r\n        watching.\r\n\r\n        3. It conserves the flavour of the food.\r\n\r\n        4. It obviates all danger of burning the food.\r\n\r\n        5. It does not heat the room.\r\n\r\n\r\nWAYS OF USING THE FIRELESS COOKER\r\n\r\n1. Food cooked in liquid:\r\n\r\nIn all cookers where stone plates are not used, only such foods as are\r\ncooked in liquids can be prepared. Examples of foods cooked in this way\r\nare, meat soup, beef-tea, meat stews, vegetables, fruit, porridge,\r\ncereal, puddings, etc.\r\n\r\nThe prepared food is put into one of the food receptacles belonging to\r\nthe cooker and is placed over a fire, until it has boiled for a few\r\nminutes. The cover is then tightly adjusted, and the dish quickly locked\r\nin the cooker, to conserve the heat that the food and liquid have\r\nabsorbed.\r\n\r\n2. Food cooked in dry heat by the use of stone plates:\r\n\r\nIn this method the food is cold when it is placed in the cooker, and all\r\nthe heat is supplied by stone plates placed above and below the utensil\r\ncontaining the food. These plates are heated for about twenty minutes\r\nover a fire, before they are used in the cooker.\r\n\r\nExamples of food cooked in this way are, roasts of meat; baked fruit,\r\nsuch as apples; baked vegetables, such as potatoes or beans; cakes, such\r\nas plain cake or fruit cake; quick bread, such as corn-bread and\r\nbiscuits.\r\n\r\n3. Food cooked in liquid, aided by the heat of one stone plate:\r\n\r\nIn cases where the original heat absorbed by the food is not sufficient\r\nto complete the cooking as desired, a heated stone plate may be placed\r\nin the cooker below the utensil containing the hot food. The stone may\r\nbe necessary for one of the following reasons--\r\n\r\n        (1) Because the amount of food put into the\r\n            cooker is too small to contain much heat. It is\r\n            always better to have the food nearly fill the\r\n            dish.\r\n\r\n        (2) Because the time required is so long that\r\n            the heat of the food and liquid becomes\r\n            exhausted before the cooking is completed.\r\n\r\n        (3) Because it is desirable to finish the\r\n            cooking in less time.\r\n\r\n\r\nA HOME-MADE FIRELESS COOKER\r\n\r\nUse a large wooden box or a small trunk with a close-fitting cover. Make\r\nit as air-tight as possible by pasting thick paper all over the inside.\r\n\r\nPack it level with clean sawdust or excelsior (the latter preferably),\r\nuntil just enough height is left to set in a covered granite pail, which\r\nis to be used for holding the food. Place the pail in the centre, so\r\nthat its top edge is just about half an inch below the top of the box.\r\nThen pack in more excelsior very tightly around the pail, until level\r\nwith it. This will shape the "nest" for the pail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A home-made fireless cooker]\r\n\r\nMake a thick cushion, or mat, of excelsior to fit in the space between\r\nthe level of the excelsior and the inside of the cover. Cover the\r\ncushion with cheesecloth or denim to keep it intact.\r\n\r\n        NOTE.--Only food cooked in a liquid can be\r\n        prepared in a home-made cooker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nFORM IV: JUNIOR GRADE (Continued)\r\n\r\nSTUDY OF FOOD\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pupils have been working with some of the well-known foods in all of\r\ntheir recipes and should have a fair knowledge of how to prepare them in\r\nsimple ways for the table. It is now time for them to learn what these\r\nfoods contain for the use of their bodies. Much of this part of the work\r\ncan be taught in rooms without special equipment. An earnest teacher,\r\nwith a few articles from home, can make the study interesting and\r\nvaluable.\r\n\r\nA series of lessons will be necessary for this purpose. The amount of\r\nwork to be taken at one time is suggested, but this should be judged by\r\nthe teacher. As in other lessons on theory, the remaining time of the\r\nlesson period should be used in practical work. Suggestions for such\r\npractical work are given under the lesson on "The Kitchen Fire", page\r\n92.\r\n\r\nPractice lessons, to give variety and sustain interest, should be\r\ninterspersed between these lessons as desired.\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON I\r\n\r\nUSES OF FOOD\r\n\r\nThe lesson may be introduced by asking the class to think in what way\r\nthe body of a healthy baby, who is fed regularly, will have changed at\r\nthe end of six months. It will be larger; it will have more flesh, more\r\nbone, more hair, etc. We want to get a name that will apply to any part\r\nof the body. No matter which part we examine through a microscope we\r\nfind the same fine and beautiful texture, and to this we give a name\r\nsimilar to that given to fine, thin paper. We call it _tissue_--hair\r\ntissue, bone tissue, flesh tissue.\r\n\r\nWhat has food done to the baby\'s tissues? It has enlarged its tissues;\r\nthe child has grown larger. To the enlargement, or growth, of the\r\ntissues, we may apply the term, _build_, suggested by the building of a\r\nhouse. Then what may we say food does for the tissues of the body? We\r\nmay say that _food builds the tissues of the body_.\r\n\r\nThink of some persons who have taken food every day, and yet as long as\r\nyou have known them they have not increased in size. What has food done\r\nfor their tissues? The class must be told that the tissues of our bodies\r\nwear out through use, and that food has furnished the material to\r\nreplace the worn-out parts. What do we say we are doing to clothes when\r\nwe replace the worn parts? We are mending or repairing them. What does\r\nfood do for our worn-out tissues? _Food repairs the tissues of the\r\nbody._\r\n\r\nDo not think any more about the tissues of the body. Suppose you had not\r\nbeen able to get any food for several days. In what way would you be\r\ndifferent from what you are now? You would not be as strong. Food gives\r\nstrength or energy by being burned inside the body. There is a fire\r\nburning in our bodies all the time we are alive, the fuel being food.\r\nWhat do we require from the fire in our homes? We require heat. The\r\nfires in our bodies give us heat also. Any fire gives off both heat and\r\nenergy. State another use of food to the body. _Food produces heat and\r\nenergy in the body._\r\n\r\nBut food does more for the body; it contains substances to keep our\r\nbodies in order. Suppose the clock gets out of order and does not keep\r\ngood time, what does the watchmaker do to it? He regulates it. That is\r\nwhat certain kinds of food do for us. What then is another use of food?\r\n_Food regulates the body._\r\n\r\nName the uses of food to the body.\r\n\r\n1. It builds the tissues.\r\n\r\n2. It repairs the tissues.\r\n\r\n3. It produces heat and energy.\r\n\r\n4. It regulates the body.\r\n\r\nHow then can we judge if a substance be a food? By deciding that it\r\nperforms one of these duties in the body.\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON II\r\n\r\nNECESSARY SUBSTANCES IN FOOD\r\n\r\nThe names of the substances in food which supply the material for the\r\ndifferent uses of the body should be taken next.\r\n\r\n1. _For building and repairing._--(1) Mineral matter--used largely in\r\nhard tissues. (2) Nitrogenous matter, or protein--used largely for\r\nflesh. (3) Water--used in all tissues.\r\n\r\n2. _For fuel._--Carbonaceous matter (starch, sugar, fat).\r\n\r\n3. _For regulating._--Mineral matter, water.\r\n\r\n        NOTE.--The teacher should call attention to the\r\n        fact that few foods contain all these\r\n        substances, some have nearly all, some have\r\n        only one, some two or more. In order to get\r\n        all, we must eat a variety of foods. The class\r\n        is now ready to consider the well-known foods,\r\n        in order to find out which of these necessary\r\n        substances each food contains, and to obtain a\r\n        general idea of their comparative food values.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOURCES OF FOOD\r\n\r\nAll nature supplies us with food. The three great divisions of nature\r\nare animal, vegetable, and mineral, and from each we obtain food, though\r\nmost largely from the animal and vegetable kingdoms.\r\n\r\nAnimal food is some part of an animal\'s body or some product of an\r\nanimal: examples--meat or fish, milk, eggs.\r\n\r\nVegetable food is some part of a plant: examples--vegetables, fruit,\r\nseeds.\r\n\r\nMineral food is some constituent of the earth\'s crust used as food. This\r\nmineral food is obtained by drinking water which in coursing through the\r\nearth has absorbed certain minerals, by eating plants which have\r\nabsorbed the minerals from the soil, or by eating animal food which was\r\nbuilt from plant food.\r\n\r\nThis preliminary survey of the sources of all our food gives the pupils\r\na basis for classifying the foods with which they are familiar. They may\r\nbe given exercises in doing this, and will not only find them\r\ninteresting, but most useful as nature study.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUDY OF THE COMMON FOODS\r\n\r\nIn beginning the analysis of the common foods, it must be remembered\r\nthat the pupils have no knowledge of chemistry, and that what is found\r\nin each food must be discovered through the senses (seeing, smelling,\r\ntasting, feeling), or through a process of reasoning.\r\n\r\nThe pupils should also feel quite sure of what they are setting out to\r\ndo; they are going to examine some particular, well-known food, to find\r\nwhich of the necessary food substances it contains. The food substances\r\nfor which they are looking are water, mineral matter, nitrogenous\r\nmatter, and carbonaceous matter (sugar, starch, fat).\r\n\r\nIt is better to provide each pupil with a sample of the food to be\r\nstudied, but where conditions make this difficult, the one used by the\r\nteacher will suffice.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUDY OF MILK\r\n\r\nLESSON I\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITION\r\n\r\nMilk is the best food to examine first, because it contains all the food\r\nelements except starch and because these can be easily found.\r\n\r\nThe pupils may each be asked to bring a half cup of milk from home. It\r\nmay be allowed to stand in glasses while other work is taken.\r\n\r\nWhen ready for the lesson, ask the pupils to look at the contents of the\r\nglass, and they will observe a difference of colour where the cream has\r\nrisen. Nature itself has divided the milk into two parts. Pour off the\r\ntop part and feel it. It feels greasy. Butter is made from this part. We\r\nhave found _fat_--a carbonaceous food.\r\n\r\nMove the milk around in the glass and let the pupils see that it is a\r\nliquid. Tell them that all liquid in a natural food is mostly water. We\r\nhave, therefore, another food substance--_water_, a builder and\r\nregulator.\r\n\r\nLet the pupils compare a glass of water with a glass of skimmed milk,\r\nand they see that something is dissolved in the water of the milk,\r\ngiving it the white colour. Show them a glass of sour milk, where the\r\nwhite substance is separate from the water. Get the names curd and whey.\r\nTell them how the cheesemaker separates sweet milk into curd and whey.\r\nIf advisable, let them do it, but in any case show them some sweet milk\r\nseparated by rennet. Examine the sweet whey. It tastes sweet, denoting\r\nthe presence of _sugar_--another carbonaceous food.\r\n\r\nNotice the greenish-yellow colour. Recall this same colour in water in\r\nwhich potatoes, cabbage, or other vegetables have been cooked. Tell the\r\npupils that this colour is given by _mineral matter_ being dissolved in\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\nThere is still the curd of milk to examine. The use of the senses does\r\nnot allow us to definitely decide what food substance the curd is. Tell\r\nthe pupils it is protein, or find the name by a process of reasoning,\r\nthus: Recall the fact that babies live for several months on milk alone\r\nand during that time build all tissues of the body. Milk, therefore,\r\nmust contain all tissue-building substances. Review the food substances\r\nwhich are necessary to build all body tissues--mineral matter, protein,\r\nand water. We have found the mineral matter and water in milk, but not\r\nthe protein. Since curd is the only remaining part of milk, it must be\r\nlargely protein.\r\n\r\nTell the pupils that the scum which comes on the top of milk, when it is\r\nboiled, is another kind of protein of which there is a small amount in\r\nsolution in milk.\r\n\r\nLead the pupils to see that if starch were present, it would be in a raw\r\nform, and in this form is indigestible.\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON II\r\n\r\nFOOD VALUE\r\n\r\nThe analysis of milk gives a key to the food value of milk and each of\r\nits by-products (cream, butter, butter-milk, sour milk, skim milk, curd,\r\nwhey, cheese, junket). These may now be briefly discussed as to\r\ncomposition, food value, and cost.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARE\r\n\r\nMilk readily absorbs odours, bacteria, etc., and should be kept in\r\ncovered, sterilized dishes in a pure, cool atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF HEAT\r\n\r\nExperiments should be made to show the effect of simmering and boiling\r\ntemperatures. To save time, a different experiment may be given to each\r\npupil, and the results reported.\r\n\r\n1. Simmer sweet milk and note the flavour.\r\n\r\n2. Boil sweet milk and note the flavour.\r\n\r\n3. Simmer the curd of milk. Examine its texture.\r\n\r\n4. Boil the curd of milk. Examine its texture and compare it with the\r\nsimmered curd.\r\n\r\n5. Boil skim milk and note the scum.\r\n\r\n6. Simmer skim milk and note the absence of scum.\r\n\r\n        NOTE.--From the above experiments deduce the\r\n        effect of heat on protein.\r\n\r\nPractice lessons may now be given in preparing simple dishes in which\r\nmilk is the main ingredient, or, at least, recipes may be given for\r\nthese to be made at home. The following would be suitable: cream sauce,\r\ncream soups, custard, junket, cottage cheese, albuminized milk.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUDY OF EGGS\r\n\r\nLESSON I\r\n\r\nPARTS\r\n\r\n(1) Shell, (2) thick membrane, (3) white, (4) thin membrane, (5) yolk.\r\n\r\nThese parts are easily seen. Attention should be called to the pores in\r\nthe shell, and it should be explained that these allow the entrance of\r\nbacteria which spoil the egg. Any means of closing these pores helps to\r\npreserve the egg.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF PRESERVING\r\n\r\nCover the holes in the shell as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Pack in salt, bran, sawdust, brine, or water-glass.\r\n\r\n2. Coat the shells with fat or wax.\r\n\r\n3. Wrap the eggs in paper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Testing eggs by floating: (1) slightly stale, (2) stale,\r\n(3) very stale]\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTS\r\n\r\n1. In the shell:\r\n\r\n        After an egg is laid, the liquid which it\r\n        contains begins to evaporate through the pores\r\n        of the shell and, as this continues, a\r\n        noticeable space is left inside.\r\n\r\n        (1) Shake the egg, holding it near the ear. If\r\n            the contents rattle, it is somewhat stale.\r\n\r\n        (2) Drop the egg in cold water. If it sinks, it\r\n            is fresh.\r\n\r\n        (3) Hold the egg between your eye and the\r\n            light. If clear, it is fresh.\r\n\r\n        (4) A rough appearance of the shell denotes\r\n            freshness.\r\n\r\n2. Out of the shell:\r\n\r\n        White--this should be clear and cling to the\r\n            yolk.\r\n\r\n        Yolk--this should round up like a ball.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARE\r\n\r\n1. If eggs are to be used in the near future, they should be washed and\r\nput in a pure, cool atmosphere. The lower shelf of the refrigerator is\r\nbest, as odours rise, and eggs readily absorb these.\r\n\r\n2. If eggs are to be preserved, they should not be washed unless their\r\ncondition compels it, as washing removes the natural covering of the\r\npores. They should be stored in a clean, cool place, and packed as soon\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON II\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITION\r\n\r\nIt is wiser to develop the food substances in an egg by reasoning,\r\nrather than by examining the different parts. The shell is not used for\r\nfood, so it is the contents that should be studied. The class should be\r\nguided in the following sequence of thought:\r\n\r\n1. An egg is designed by nature to become a chicken, so it must contain\r\nall of the substances necessary to build a chicken.\r\n\r\n2. A chicken is an animal, and all animal bodies are made of the same\r\nsubstances. These we have seen to be mineral matter, protein, and water.\r\n\r\n3. An egg therefore contains these three substances.\r\n\r\n4. An egg must also contain three weeks\' food for the chicken, therefore\r\nmust have fuel food as well. This fuel food is found in the yolk, in the\r\nform of fat.\r\n\r\n5. The yolk therefore contains water, mineral matter, protein, and fat.\r\n\r\n6. The white contains water, mineral matter, and protein.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECT OF HEAT ON EGGS\r\n\r\nThe following experiments will show the effect on both yolk and white of\r\nthe usual methods of applying heat to eggs:\r\n\r\n1. Boil an egg for three minutes and note the effect.\r\n\r\n2. Boil an egg for twenty minutes and note the effect.\r\n\r\n3. Put an egg in boiling water, remove from the fire, and let it stand\r\ncovered from eight to ten minutes.\r\n\r\n4. Fry an egg and note the effect.\r\n\r\n        NOTE.--The eggs may be put to boil and simmer\r\n        at the beginning of the lesson, and pupils\r\n        designated to take them from the heat at proper\r\n        times. The eggs will then be ready to examine\r\n        when required.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS\r\n\r\n1. Boiling an egg for three minutes does not allow time for the heat to\r\nreach the yolk. The white is hard and tough just next the shell, but\r\nsoft and liquid as it approaches the yolk.\r\n\r\n2. Boiling an egg for twenty minutes hardens and toughens the white, so\r\nthat it all becomes hard to dissolve or digest. It also gives the heat\r\ntime to reach the centre and hardens the yolk, but does not toughen it\r\nor make it hard to dissolve or digest.\r\n\r\n3. Allowing the egg to stand in the hot water coagulates the white to a\r\njelly-like consistency without toughening it; it also cooks the yolk.\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSONS III, IV, ETC.\r\n\r\nUSES OF EGGS\r\n\r\nTo give practice in preparing eggs and to show their special uses the\r\nfollowing dishes would be suitable:\r\n\r\n1. White:\r\n\r\n        For food--poached eggs on toast, simmered eggs\r\n\r\n        For cohesive (sticky) property--potato balls,\r\n        fish balls\r\n\r\n        For clearing liquids--coffee\r\n\r\n        For holding air--foamy omelet\r\n\r\n        For decoration--hard-boiled eggs cut in fancy\r\n        shapes for garnishing, meringue on lemon\r\n        pudding, etc.\r\n\r\n2. Yolk:\r\n\r\n        For food--egg-nog, scrambled eggs\r\n\r\n        For thickening liquids--custard, salad\r\n        dressing, lemon pudding\r\n\r\n        For colouring foods--tapioca cream\r\n\r\n        For decoration--hard boiled and grated over\r\n        salads.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUDY OF VEGETABLE FOOD\r\n\r\nBefore beginning this part of the work, it would be most helpful if the\r\nclass had one or two nature study lessons on the structure and organs of\r\nplants. With the pupils in possession of some knowledge thus acquired,\r\nthe Household Management teacher has only to lead up to ideas of the\r\npreparation and value of these parts as food. These ideas should, as far\r\nas possible, follow in such a natural order that the pupils may even\r\nanticipate the sequence.\r\n\r\nThe outline may be as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON I\r\n\r\nSOURCE\r\n\r\nAll vegetable food is obtained from plants; it is some part of a plant\r\nused as food.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARTS OF PLANTS USED AS FOOD\r\n\r\n1. Root--carrot, radish\r\n\r\n2. Tuber--potato, artichoke\r\n\r\n3. Bulb--onion\r\n\r\n4. Stem--rhubarb, asparagus\r\n\r\n5. Leaf--spinach, cabbage\r\n\r\n6. Flower--cauliflower\r\n\r\n7. Fruit--apple, orange\r\n\r\n8. Seed--(1) Of trees (nuts)--beechnut, almond\r\n\r\n         (2) Of grasses (cereals)--wheat, corn, rice\r\n\r\n         (3) Of vines (legumes)--peas, beans, lentils.\r\n\r\nIn asking for examples of the different parts, there will be more\r\ninterest and value if the questions correlate other subjects, for\r\ninstance: For what fruit is Canada noted? What fruit does she import?\r\nName a nut the squirrels gather.\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON II\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITION OF ANY PART OF A PLANT\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing, the pupils may infer that there are eight different\r\nfoods to study. They should be led to see that in reality there is only\r\none, as all parts of plants are, generally speaking, the same in\r\nstructure. Referring to the animal body, they will know that a bone from\r\nthe foot is of much the same structure as one from the face; that a\r\npiece of flesh from the leg is the same as a piece from any other part\r\nof the body. In the same way, if we study one part of a plant, it will\r\nbe a type of all parts. In general the structure is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. A framework, in cellular form, made of a substance called\r\n_cellulose_.\r\n\r\n2. Material filling the cells:\r\n\r\n        (1) A juice in the cells of all parts of plants\r\n            except seeds\r\n\r\n        (2) A solid in the cells of seeds.\r\n\r\nTo show the framework, some vegetable food having a white colour should\r\nbe chosen, such as potato, parsnip, or apple.\r\n\r\nIt must be explained that all plants are made of a framework of numerous\r\ncells, something like a honey-comb. The cells in plants are of many\r\ndifferent shapes, according to the plant, or the part of the plant, in\r\nwhich they are found. They are usually so small that they cannot be\r\ndistinguished without a microscope; but occasionally they are large\r\nenough to be seen without one. Pass sections of orange or lemon, where\r\nthe cells are visible. Make a drawing on the black-board of the cellular\r\nformation of a potato. Lead the class to understand that, in every case,\r\nthe cell walls must be broken to get out the cell contents. To\r\nillustrate this, they may use potatoes, and break the cell walls by\r\ngrating the potatoes. After they have broken up the framework, the cell\r\ncontents should be strained through cheesecloth into a glass. They have\r\nnow two parts to examine--cell walls and cell contents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cellular structure of a potato]\r\n\r\nWash the framework to free it of any cell juice and study it first. Give\r\nits name, and note its colour and texture. Compare the framework of\r\npotatoes, strawberries, lettuce, trees, etc. Tell the class that in some\r\ncases part of the cellulose is so fibrous that it is used to make\r\nthread, cloth, or twine; for instance, _flax_ and _hemp_.\r\n\r\nCellulose is most difficult to dissolve, so that practically little of\r\nit is digested. It serves a mechanical purpose in the digestive tract by\r\nhelping to fill the organs and dilute the real food. If fibrous, it acts\r\nas an irritant and overcomes sluggishness of the intestines known as\r\nconstipation. The outer coats of cereals are an example of coarse\r\ncellulose, as used in brown bread and some kinds of porridge.\r\n\r\nExamine next the juice which was contained in the cells of the potato.\r\nThe liquid shows much water; the colour indicates mineral matter in\r\nsolution; the odour suggests a flavour; the white sediment is starch.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITION OF POTATO JUICE\r\n\r\nWater, mineral matter, flavouring matter, starch.\r\n\r\nDraw attention to the fact that the potato is the part of the plant\r\nwhich acts as a storehouse. In such parts, starch is always found as the\r\nstored form of sugar; but, in parts which are not storehouses, sugar\r\nwill be found in its stead. In rare cases both are found, as in the\r\nparsnip.\r\n\r\n        NOTE.--This is a good time to impress the fact\r\n        that plants are the source of starch for\r\n        manufacturing purposes. In England, potatoes\r\n        are largely used; in Canada, corn. It will be\r\n        interesting to state that the early settlers\r\n        obtained their starch for laundry purposes at\r\n        home from potatoes, by chopping or grinding\r\n        them.\r\n\r\nThe insolubility of starch in cold liquids may be effectively reviewed\r\nat this part of the lesson. The starch has been lying in the water of\r\nthe potato cells for several months, yet has not dissolved. Let two or\r\nthree of the class gradually heat the potato juice with its starch\r\nsediment, stirring all the time to distribute the sediment evenly. They\r\nwill find that a little less than boiling temperature dissolves the\r\nstarch. This will show them that heat is necessary for the solution of\r\nstarch, and a heat much greater than that in the body, hence raw starch\r\nis indigestible. Recall the milk lesson and the uselessness of starch as\r\na component of milk, unless the milk be cooked.\r\n\r\nSqueeze the juice from a sour apple or lemon, and note the taste.\r\nExplain that all fruit juices contain more or less acid. The effects of\r\nthis acid in the body are similar to those of mineral matter.\r\n\r\nProtein is also found in plant juices; but in such small quantities that\r\nit may be disregarded as a source of food supply.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL COMPOSITION OF PLANT JUICE\r\n\r\nWater; mineral matter; flavouring matter; starch or sugar, or both; acid\r\n(in fruit juice).\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON III\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITION OF SOLID MATERIAL IN CELLS OF SEEDS\r\n\r\nThis part of the lesson may be developed as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Seeds contain the building material for new plants, as well as their\r\nfood for a short time.\r\n\r\n2. Plants and animals require much the same material to build and feed\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n3. Animals require water, mineral matter, protein, sugar, starch, and\r\nfat.\r\n\r\n4. Plants require the same; but the seed being a storehouse part of the\r\nplant, it will not have sugar, and water has to be supplied when the new\r\nplant is to be formed.\r\n\r\n5. Seeds contain, therefore, mineral matter, protein, starch, and fat.\r\n\r\n        NOTE 1.--Seeds will grow in water until their\r\n        stored food is used: they must then be planted\r\n        in soil, to get further nourishment.\r\n\r\n        NOTE 2.--The two fuel foods, starch and fat,\r\n        are not found together in abundance in seeds;\r\n        one or the other will be much in excess. For\r\n        instance, in walnuts there is a great deal of\r\n        fat, while in peas and beans there is scarcely\r\n        a trace of fat, but the starch is abundant.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARATIVE FOOD VALUE OF DIFFERENT PARTS OF PLANTS\r\n\r\nOnly a very general idea of this should be attempted. The food value of\r\nany part of a plant can be roughly estimated by considering the office\r\nof that particular part in plant structure. Nature study will assist in\r\nthis. The root collects the food to send it to the parts above; the stem\r\nis a hallway through which the food is carried in a more diluted form.\r\nThe leaves serve the purpose of lungs and will not contain much food,\r\nthough they naturally have a good deal of flavour; parsley, sage, and\r\ntea are examples of this. The fruit is a house to protect the seeds, and\r\nis made most attractive and delicious, so that animals will be tempted\r\nto eat this part, and thus assist in the dispersal of the seeds. The\r\nfruit has comparatively little food value as building material. The seed\r\ncontains the stored material to build new plants, and therefore is the\r\nmost nutritive part of all. It is the only part of the plant which\r\ncontains an appreciable supply of building food, that is, which can take\r\nthe place of eggs or meat in the diet. Baked beans are sometimes called\r\n"nuggets of nourishment" or "the poor man\'s beef".\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON IV\r\n\r\nAfter discussing the food value of the different parts in this broad\r\nway, the pupils may be asked to consider the plant foods used in their\r\ndiet and to compare their nutritive value.\r\n\r\nThe facts concerning these may be summed up as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Green vegetables:\r\n\r\n        These generally contain much water, hardly any\r\n        protein or fat, and a small amount of sugar.\r\n        They are valuable mainly for their mineral\r\n        matter and cellulose.\r\n\r\n2. Root vegetables and tubers:\r\n\r\n        These are more nutritious than green\r\n        vegetables, because they contain much more\r\n        sugar and starch.\r\n\r\n3. Ripe seeds (cereals, legumes, and nuts):\r\n\r\n        These are highly nutritious, because of the\r\n        large amount of protein and building mineral\r\n        matter they contain, and also the amount of\r\n        fuel food.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRIED VEGETABLES AND FRUIT\r\n\r\nIt is important that the value of these be pointed out. Dried foods\r\ncontain all of the constituents of fresh food excepting water and a\r\nlittle flavour lost in evaporation, yet they are often much cheaper.\r\nAttention should be directed to the best means of restoring the water\r\nand, if necessary, of giving an additional flavour by the use of cloves,\r\ncinnamon, etc.\r\n\r\nCanning is a better means of preserving food for export or for use when\r\nout of season, but where the expense prohibits this method, drying is a\r\ngood substitute. In districts where fruit and vegetables cannot be grown\r\nor in seasons when they cannot be obtained fresh, the dried forms are\r\ncheap and have excellent food value.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COOKING OF VEGETABLE FOOD\r\n\r\nAs vegetable food is eaten both raw and cooked, the pupils should be\r\nasked to decide when cooking is necessary and what they wish it to\r\naccomplish.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere are only two substances in vegetable food which will require\r\ncooking, and these are:\r\n\r\n1. Cellulose, if it be hard or tough\r\n\r\n2. Starch, if it be present.\r\n\r\nThe pupils have found in their experiment with the potato water, that\r\nstarch cooks quickly, hence the time of cooking will depend altogether\r\non the texture of the cellulose. When the cellulose is softened at the\r\ncentre, the last part which the heat reaches, the vegetable or fruit\r\nwill be cooked.\r\n\r\nIf the food is cooked in water by boiling or simmering, much of the\r\nsubstance will pass into the cooking water. As the cell walls become\r\nsoftened, they allow the cell contents to partially pass out and the\r\ncooking water to pass in to fill the space. If the food is long in\r\ncooking, the water may have more value than the vegetable, and it should\r\nnot be thrown away. It may be used in two ways--as a basis for a sauce\r\nor a soup.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL RULES FOR COOKING VEGETABLES\r\n\r\n        NOTE.--As the principles in the general rules\r\n        have been taught, these rules may be dictated\r\n        to the class.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARATION\r\n\r\n1. Wash, pare, peel, or scrape the vegetable, and cut it into convenient\r\nsizes.\r\n\r\n2. Unless green vegetables are freshly gathered, soak them in cold water\r\nfor an hour before cooking.\r\n\r\n3. Soak dried vegetables at least twelve hours.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOOKING\r\n\r\n1. Put all vegetables on to cook in boiling water, except dried\r\nvegetables, which should be put on in cold water.\r\n\r\n2. Strong-smelling vegetables should be cooked at simmering point, the\r\nothers may boil gently.\r\n\r\n3. For vegetables that grow above ground (including onions), salt the\r\nwater (one tsp. to a quart).\r\n\r\n4. For underground vegetables, do not salt the water.\r\n\r\n\r\nVEGETABLE RECIPE\r\n\r\nPrepare and cook the vegetables until tender, according to the rules\r\ngiven above. Drain off and measure the vegetable water. For each 1/2 cup\r\nof vegetable, take 1/4 cup of the water and make into a sauce. Re-heat\r\nthe vegetable in the sauce and serve in a hot dish.\r\n\r\n        NOTE 1.--For potatoes and tomatoes do not\r\n        follow this recipe.\r\n\r\n        NOTE 2.--The sauce is made by thickening each\r\n        cup of vegetable water with two tablespoonfuls\r\n        of flour, and seasoning as desired with salt,\r\n        pepper, and butter.\r\n\r\n        NOTE 3.--Another method of saving and using the\r\n        valuable vegetable water is to make it into a\r\n        soup.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL RULES FOR COOKING FRUIT\r\n\r\n\r\nFRESH FRUIT\r\n\r\n1. Stewed.--Put the prepared fruit in a saucepan with enough water to\r\nkeep it from burning. Cover closely, and stew until tender, stirring\r\noften. Add the sugar and let the mixture boil a minute more.\r\n\r\n2. Cooked in syrup.--Make a syrup of one part sugar to two or three\r\nparts water. Put the prepared fruit in the hot syrup, cover closely, and\r\nsimmer until tender.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRIED FRUIT\r\n\r\nWash the fruit thoroughly. Cover with cold water and soak twenty-four\r\nhours. Put on to cook in the same water in which it has soaked. Add\r\nspices if desired. Cover closely and simmer until tender. Add the sugar\r\nand simmer ten minutes longer. Take out the fruit, and, if necessary,\r\nboil down the syrup, then pour it over the fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSONS V, VI, ETC.\r\n\r\nWhile studying vegetable food, practice will be given in nearly every\r\nlesson in the preparation and cooking of vegetables or fruit, but after\r\nthe completion of this series of lessons, these foods should be prepared\r\nand cooked with more intelligence and interest. For this reason, there\r\nmay be, at the last, one general practical lesson devoted to vegetables\r\nand fruit, to review and impress the facts that have been taught. As\r\npotatoes, on account of their large amount of starch, require special\r\ncare, an extra lesson may be given to this vegetable.\r\n\r\nIn the lesson on potatoes the attention of the class should be directed\r\nto the following:\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS IN COOKING POTATOES\r\n\r\n1. Be sure to soften the cellulose thoroughly.\r\n\r\n2. After the potatoes are cooked, get rid of all possible moisture, that\r\nthey may be white and mealy.\r\n\r\n        (1) If potatoes are cooked in water, drain them\r\n            thoroughly, remove the cover, and shake over\r\n            the heat to dry out the starch.\r\n\r\n        (2) If potatoes are baked, break the skins and\r\n            allow the moisture to escape as steam.\r\n\r\n3. When serving mashed potatoes, pile them lightly without smoothing.\r\n\r\n\r\nUSE OF STARCH TO THICKEN LIQUIDS\r\n\r\nA lesson on the use of starch for thickening purposes should be given\r\nbefore lessons on the making of a sauce or a soup from the water in\r\nwhich vegetables have been cooked. The necessity of separating the\r\nstarch grains should be shown by experiments.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENTS IN USING STARCH FOR THICKENING\r\n\r\n(Any powdered starch may be used)\r\n\r\n1. Boil 1/4 cup of water in a small saucepan. While boiling, stir into\r\nit 1/2 tsp. of cornstarch and let it boil one minute. Observe the\r\nresult. Break open a lump and examine it.\r\n\r\n2. Mix 1 tsp. of cornstarch with 2 tsp. of cold water, and stir into 1/4\r\ncup of boiling water. Note the result.\r\n\r\n3. Mix 1 tsp. of cornstarch with 2 tsp. of sugar and stir into 1/4 cup\r\nof boiling water. Note the result.\r\n\r\n4. Mix 1 tsp. of cornstarch with 2 tsp. of melted fat in a small\r\nsaucepan and stir into it 1/4 cup of boiling water. Note the result.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSIONS BASED ON THE FOREGOING EXPERIMENTS\r\n\r\n1. Starch granules must be separated before being used to thicken a\r\nliquid:\r\n\r\n        (1) By adding a double quantity of cold liquid\r\n\r\n        (2) By adding a double quantity of sugar\r\n\r\n        (3) By adding a double quantity of melted fat.\r\n\r\n2. The liquid which is being thickened must be constantly stirred, to\r\ndistribute evenly the starch grains until they are cooked.\r\n\r\n\r\nBASIC RECIPE FOR LIQUIDS THICKENED WITH FLOUR.\r\n\r\n                           Milk       Flour        Butter\r\n    Thin cream sauce       1 cup      1 tbsp.      1 tbsp.\r\n    Thick cream sauce      1 cup      2 tbsp.      2 tbsp.\r\n\r\n        NOTE.--Use thick cream sauce to pour over a\r\n        food. Use thin cream sauce when solid food\r\n        substance is mixed with the sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIATIONS OF BASIC RECIPE\r\n\r\n1. Tomato sauce.--Use strained tomato juice instead of milk.\r\n\r\n2. Vegetable sauce.--Use vegetable water in place of the milk.\r\n\r\n3. Cheese sauce.--Use 1/3 to 1/2 cup of grated cheese in 1 cup of thick\r\ncream sauce.\r\n\r\n\r\nCREAM OF VEGETABLE SOUPS\r\n\r\nAt least one practice lesson should be given on the making of these\r\nsoups. The value of the vegetable water should be impressed upon the\r\npupils, and it may be pointed out that these soups are an excellent way\r\nof using the cooking water and any left-over vegetable.\r\n\r\nThe difference between tomatoes and other vegetables should be noted.\r\nTomatoes are a fruit and, as such, contain an acid. The acid would\r\ncurdle milk and must be neutralized by the use of soda, before milk can\r\nbe added.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Utensils used for cream soups]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRINCIPLES OF CREAM SOUPS\r\n\r\n1. The liquid may be all milk, part vegetable water and milk, or all\r\nvegetable water.\r\n\r\n2. The amount of flour used for thickening depends on the vegetable.\r\nStarchy vegetables need only 1/2 tbsp. to one cup of liquid; non-starchy\r\nvegetables need 1 tbsp. to a cup.\r\n\r\n3. The ingredients are combined as follows:\r\n\r\n        (1) The liquid is heated and thickened with\r\n            flour.\r\n\r\n        (2) The seasonings of butter, salt, and pepper\r\n            are added.\r\n\r\n        (3) The vegetable pulp is added in any desired\r\n            quantity, usually about two tbsp. to one cup of\r\n            liquid.\r\n\r\nA special recipe should be given for cream of tomato soup, so that the\r\nproportion of soda may be correct.\r\n\r\n        NOTE.--If flavours of onion, bay-leaf, parsley,\r\n        etc., are desired, these should be cooked with\r\n        the vegetables, so as to be extracted in the\r\n        vegetable water.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUTLINE OF LESSONS ON COOKING SEEDS\r\n\r\n\r\nCEREALS: WHEAT, OATS, CORN, RICE, RYE, BARLEY\r\n\r\n1. Forms in which used:\r\n\r\n        (1) Whole or cracked grains--rice, cracked\r\n            wheat, coarse oatmeal, etc.\r\n\r\n        (2) Granular--corn meal, cream of wheat, fine\r\n            oatmeal, etc.\r\n\r\n        (3) Rolled or flaked grains--wheat, oats, corn,\r\n            rice, etc.\r\n\r\n        (4) Powdered--wheat flour, rice flour, etc.\r\n\r\n2. Cooking cereals for breakfast:\r\n\r\n        For 1 cup of water use 1/4 tsp. of salt and the\r\n            following cereal--\r\n\r\n        Whole or cracked--1/4 cup of cereal\r\n\r\n        Granular--3 tbsp. of cereal\r\n\r\n        Rolled or flaked--1/2 cup of cereal.\r\n\r\nPut salt and water in the inner part of a double boiler, and set\r\ndirectly over the fire. When steaming hot, gradually stir in the dry\r\ncereal, and keep stirring until the starch has thickened and boiled.\r\nStir carefully, so as not to break the flakes of rolled cereals. Then\r\nset the inner dish inside the outer part of the double boiler, in which\r\nthere should be boiling water, and cook from two to four hours.\r\n\r\n        NOTE 1.--Rice has very tender cellulose and\r\n        cooks in 3/4 hr.\r\n\r\n        NOTE 2.--Rolled or flaked cereals have been\r\n        steamed an hour or more to soften them for\r\n        rolling, so require less cooking.\r\n\r\n        NOTE 3.--Cereals may be cooked for breakfast\r\n        the day before, but _should not be stirred\r\n        while being re-heated_.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEGUMES: PEAS, BEANS, LENTILS\r\n\r\n1. Forms in which used:\r\n\r\n        (1) Ripe seeds\r\n\r\n        (2) Meals--pea meal, etc.\r\n\r\n2. Cooking of dried legumes:\r\n\r\n        (1) Soak in cold, soft water for twelve hours\r\n            or more, and then drain and rinse. Hard water\r\n            may be softened by boiling, or by the addition\r\n            of soda (1/8 tsp. of soda to 1 pt. of water).\r\n\r\n        (2) Cook by _simmering_ in softened water until\r\n            they are soft.\r\n\r\n        (3) After simmering, the beans may be baked.\r\n\r\n\r\nNUTS\r\n\r\nForms in which used:\r\n\r\n1. Whole or broken nuts--used as dessert or in cakes, salads, etc.\r\n\r\n2. Butters--ground and mixed with other ingredients to make a paste.\r\n\r\n3. Meals--ground and used to thicken soups.\r\n\r\n\r\nSALADS\r\n\r\nThe series of lessons on vegetable foods being finished, it is a good\r\ntime to take a salad lesson. All salads were originally made from fresh\r\nyoung plants or salad greens, and though any food material is now used\r\nfor the purpose, the subject seems to follow naturally the lessons on\r\nplant food.\r\n\r\nThe pupils should derive unusual pleasure from this work. The dishes\r\nmade are most attractive and appetizing, besides affording an\r\nopportunity for each member of the class to display individual artistic\r\nskill. None of the principles are new, so that the lesson will be really\r\na review.\r\n\r\nThe outline of notes for the class will be:\r\n\r\n\r\nINGREDIENTS OF SALADS\r\n\r\n1. Salad plants _proper_, such as lettuce, water-cress, celery, cabbage\r\n\r\n2. Cooked vegetables, such as peas, beans, asparagus, carrots, beets\r\n\r\n3. Meat--cold, of any kind\r\n\r\n4. Fish--cold, of any kind\r\n\r\n5. Eggs--hard-boiled\r\n\r\n6. Fruit\r\n\r\n7. Combinations of the above in great variety.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOD VALUES OF SALADS\r\n\r\nThis depends on the ingredients. If salad greens only are used, the food\r\nvalue is mainly the mineral matter, but the dish will be refreshing and\r\nappetizing, and the oil, butter, or egg used in the dressing adds\r\nnutriment.\r\n\r\nSalads are prepared with little trouble and with no expense for fuel.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARATION OF SALAD INGREDIENTS\r\n\r\n1. Have everything cold before combining.\r\n\r\n2. Freshen the greens in cold water until crisp.\r\n\r\n3. Meat, fish, and solid ingredients should be seasoned some time before\r\nusing, so that they may absorb the flavours of the seasoning.\r\n\r\n4. In most cases do not combine the ingredients with the dressing until\r\njust before serving.\r\n\r\n        (1) Salad greens.--Wash thoroughly, and put in\r\n            cold water until crisp, drain on a towel, wrap\r\n            in a damp cloth, and put in a cool place.\r\n            Cabbage and lettuce may be finely shredded.\r\n\r\n        (2) Fruit and cooked vegetables.--Cut into\r\n            cubes or suitable pieces. Chill and mix with\r\n            the dressing, to absorb it.\r\n\r\n        (3) Meats.--Remove the fat, skin, and gristle.\r\n            Cut in cubes and chill.\r\n\r\n        (4) Fish.--Remove the bones, flake, chill, and\r\n            pour dressing over; but do not mix.\r\n\r\n\r\nDRESSINGS FOR SALADS\r\n\r\n1. Cooked salad dressing:\r\n\r\n        2 tbsp. sugar\r\n        1/2 tsp. mustard\r\n        1/2 tsp. salt\r\n        1/4 cup vinegar\r\n        2 eggs\r\n        2 tbsp. butter.\r\n\r\n        (1) Mix the first four ingredients in a\r\n            saucepan and heat until dissolved.\r\n\r\n        (2) Beat the eggs very light in a\r\n            round-bottomed bowl, using a Dover egg beater.\r\n\r\n        (3) Beat the vinegar mixture into the eggs.\r\n\r\n        (4) Set the bowl, with its contents, over a\r\n            dish of boiling water, then beat slowly and\r\n            constantly until the mixture is thickened.\r\n\r\n        (5) Lift the bowl from the heat _at once_.\r\n\r\n        (6) Beat in the butter and set away to cool.\r\n\r\n        (7) If desired, a half cup of whipped or plain\r\n            cream may be added just before the dressing is\r\n            used.\r\n\r\n2. Uncooked salad dressing:\r\n\r\n        1/4 tsp. salt\r\n        1/8 tsp. pepper\r\n        4 tbsp. olive oil\r\n        2 tbsp. vinegar.\r\n\r\n        (1) Stir the salt and pepper into the oil.\r\n\r\n        (2) Add the vinegar slowly and stir vigorously\r\n            until well blended and slightly thickened.\r\n\r\n        (3) Serve with any salad made of salad greens.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUDY OF MINERAL FOOD\r\n\r\nAs the study of mineral food involves a knowledge of chemistry, little\r\nmore can be done in Junior classes than to teach that certain mineral\r\ncompounds are required for the body, to point out their two main uses,\r\nand to lead the pupils to know the foods which generally supply these.\r\n\r\nTheir attention should be directed to the fact that all mineral matter\r\nis found, in the first place, in the earth\'s crust, but that, with the\r\nexception of salt, animals cannot use it in that form. Plants can use\r\nit, and they absorb it from the soil; then we eat the plants, and in\r\nthat way obtain the mineral substance, or we may obtain it by eating the\r\nanimals which have eaten the plants. Water also, in making its way\r\nthrough the earth, may dissolve certain minerals and, by drinking the\r\nwater, we obtain these.\r\n\r\nIt will not be necessary to teach the names of the minerals which our\r\nfood must supply, as most of these will mean nothing to the pupils. They\r\nmight be asked to name one or two which are very familiar; for instance,\r\nthe lime in bone and the iron in blood. They may be told that there are\r\na few others which they will learn when they study chemistry in the high\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nThe pupils have already learned that mineral matter serves two main\r\nfunctions in the body: that is, _building_ and _regulating_, and it is a\r\ngood plan to classify the well-known foods under these two headings.\r\nWith a little guidance the pupils can do most of this for themselves.\r\nThey know that milk serves all building purposes in a child\'s body, and\r\nmust, therefore, contain mineral matter. Eggs build animal bodies, and\r\nmust contain this substance also. Meat is the animal body that has been\r\nbuilt, therefore meat has this substance; but we shall find in the meat\r\nlessons that there is no mineral matter in fat and that the cook cannot\r\ndissolve it out of bone, therefore muscle or lean meat must be eaten to\r\nobtain it. Seeds, too, contain building material for new plants;\r\ntherefore, the building mineral matter must be stored in their cells.\r\nHard water is known by the lime it contains, therefore this, if drunk,\r\nassists in the formation of bone.\r\n\r\nThe class must be told that the mineral in the juices of plants is\r\nmainly for regulating purposes; that is, to keep our bodies in order, or\r\nas we say, healthy. When they get out of order, we usually go to a\r\ndoctor to be regulated or made well. The medicine which he prescribes\r\noften contains some mineral in solution, perhaps iron. The mineral\r\nmatter which is in the juices of plants, being a more natural form than\r\nthe mineral matter in the medicine, is more easily made use of in the\r\nbodily processes. This is one reason why people should eat plenty of\r\nvegetables and fruit.\r\n\r\nMany springs also furnish water with large quantities of mineral matter\r\nin solution, which is used mainly for medicinal purposes. The pupils may\r\nknow some places where we find such springs, and these should be\r\nmentioned, such as Preston Springs, Banff, and Mount Clemens, which have\r\nbecome health resorts through the presence of these waters. When the\r\nsprings are in a distant country and their waters are known to contain a\r\ncertain mineral which our bodies need, the water is bottled and shipped\r\nto us, and may be obtained from a druggist. Hunyadi Janos, Apenta,\r\nVichy, and Apollinaris are well-known medicinal waters shipped from\r\nEuropean springs.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY OF SOURCES OF MINERAL FOODS\r\n\r\n1. Building mineral matter.--Milk, eggs, lean meat, seeds, hard water\r\n\r\n2. Regulating mineral matter.--Fruit, vegetables, mineral waters, salt.\r\n\r\n        NOTE.--This classification will be most useful\r\n        to the pupils in preparing well-balanced meals\r\n        in their diet lessons.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIET\r\n\r\nAfter studying in this elementary way the composition of the animal and\r\nvegetable foods, the pupils will be ready for simple lessons on diet.\r\nThe class may now be said to have a working knowledge of the well-known\r\nfoods, and they should be given a chance to use this knowledge, by\r\ncombining and serving these foods for simple meals.\r\n\r\n\r\nREFERENCE TABLES OF FOOD CONSTITUENTS\r\n\r\nIt will be helpful in this work, to guide the pupils in making out a\r\nreference table of the food constituents. This will give lists of food\r\nin which each constituent predominates, as follows:\r\n\r\n        1. Water:\r\n\r\n    Beverages (water, milk, tea, coffee, cocoa), fruit, vegetables.\r\n\r\n2. Mineral matter:\r\n\r\n        (1) For building--milk, eggs (yolk and white),\r\n            lean meat or fish, seeds, hard water\r\n\r\n        (2) For regulating--fruit, vegetables, mineral\r\n        waters.\r\n\r\n3. Protein:\r\n\r\n        Milk (curd), eggs (yolk and white), lean meat\r\n        or fish, seeds.\r\n\r\n4. Sugar:\r\n\r\n        Fruit (juice), non-starchy vegetables (juice),\r\n        milk (whey), commercial sugar.\r\n\r\n5. Starch:\r\n\r\n        Parts of plants which serve as storehouses:\r\n\r\n        Tubers--potatoes, artichokes\r\n\r\n        Roots--parsnip, tapioca, arrowroot\r\n\r\n        Stem--sago\r\n\r\n        Seeds--cereals, legumes, some nuts (peanuts,\r\n        chestnuts).\r\n\r\n6. Fat:\r\n\r\n        Milk (cream), egg-yolk, meat or fish (fat),\r\n        fruit, as the olive (oil), most nuts (walnut,\r\n        butternut, pecan, peanut, etc.).\r\n\r\nBesides the necessary substances in food, the pupils must be told that\r\nthere are other points for the housekeeper to consider when preparing\r\nthe meals, namely:\r\n\r\n        1. The amount of each food substance required\r\n            daily.\r\n\r\n        2. Special requirements of individuals\r\n            according to: (1) age, (2) occupation, (3)\r\n            climate, (4) season.\r\n\r\nUnder 1, above, it may be explained, that when a meal is prepared which\r\ngives the body a correct proportion of each food substance, it is said\r\nto be well balanced. From numerous experiments the "Dietary Standard"\r\nfor one day for a grown person has been calculated to be:\r\n\r\n        Water--about 5 pints, two of which are taken in\r\n        solid food\r\n\r\n        Mineral matter--1 ounce\r\n\r\n        Protein--3 to 4 1/2 ounces\r\n\r\n        Fat--2 ounces\r\n\r\n        Sugar and starch (together)--14 to 18 ounces.\r\n\r\nAlthough the pupils cannot be expected to follow this table accurately,\r\nfrom lack of sufficient knowledge, it will be of some assistance to them\r\nin choosing a combination of food for the home meals.\r\n\r\nUnder 2, above, some of the variations of food are obvious, but some\r\nmust be taught. Children require simple, nourishing food, which will\r\ncontain plenty of protein and mineral matter for tissue building as well\r\nas much fuel food. Their diet should be varied and abundant.\r\n\r\nIn old age the diet should also be simple, because of the lack of vigour\r\nin the digestive organs, but the amount of building material should be\r\ndecreased. The food of old people should contain proportionately more\r\ncarbonaceous material.\r\n\r\nBrain workers require less food than those engaged in active muscular\r\nwork, and it should be less stimulating and less bulky. Their diet\r\nshould be in a form that is easily digested.\r\n\r\nWith the foregoing general ideas in mind, the pupils may be asked to\r\nprepare menus for simple home meals. These should be assigned as home\r\nwork, so that plenty of time can be given to their consideration, and\r\nthen they may be brought to the class for criticism. The best of these\r\nshould be chosen for actual practice in school work.\r\n\r\n        NOTE.--It is intended that this part of the\r\n        work shall be presented in a very rudimentary\r\n        way. The teacher should feel satisfied if she\r\n        succeeds in implanting ideas of the importance\r\n        of these food considerations, so that the\r\n        pupils will be ready for more specific\r\n        instruction to be gained in higher schools or\r\n        from their own reading. Cheap bulletins on\r\n        _Human Nutrition_, published by Cornell\r\n        University, will be excellent reading on this\r\n        subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARING AND SERVING MEALS\r\n\r\nBefore the pupils are given a meal to prepare and serve, table setting\r\nshould be reviewed, and the rules of table service taught as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nRULES FOR SERVING\r\n\r\n1. The hostess serves the soup, salad, dessert, tea, and coffee; the\r\nhost serves the meat and fish.\r\n\r\n2. Vegetables and side dishes may be served by some one at the table or\r\npassed by the waitress.\r\n\r\n3. Dishes are served at the left of each person, commencing with the\r\nchief guest.\r\n\r\n4. Guests are served first; ladies before gentlemen.\r\n\r\n5. In each course, remove the dishes containing the food before removing\r\nthe soiled plates.\r\n\r\n6. When one course is finished, take the tray in the left hand, stand on\r\nthe left side of the person, and remove the individual soiled dishes\r\nwith the right hand, never piling them.\r\n\r\n7. Before dessert is served, if necessary, remove the crumbs from the\r\ncloth with a brush, crumb knife, or napkin.\r\n\r\n8. Tea or coffee may be poured at table or served from a side table by\r\nthe waitress.\r\n\r\n        NOTE.--Extra cutlery and napkins should be\r\n        conveniently placed on a side table, in case of\r\n        accident.\r\n\r\nWhere the class consists of twelve or more pupils, it must be divided\r\nfor the preparation and serving of a meal. Each section should prepare\r\nand serve a meal for the others, until all have had experience. As\r\nbreakfast and luncheon are the simpler meals, they should be taken first\r\nin the order of lessons. The duties of the cooking and serving should be\r\ndefinitely settled, and each girl given entire responsibility for a\r\ncertain part of the work.\r\n\r\nThose who are served should represent a family. Members should be chosen\r\nto act as father, mother, lady guest, gentleman guest, and children of\r\nvarying ages, so that the duties and serving of each may be typified.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nFORM IV: JUNIOR GRADE (Continued)\r\n\r\nCARE OF THE HOUSE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pupils of Form IV Junior should be urged to take entire care of\r\ntheir own bed-rooms. The Household Management teacher can do much to\r\nencourage them in this. She may include such work as part of the week\'s\r\npractice.\r\n\r\nThe order of work should be discussed and planned by the pupils, the\r\nteacher guiding the class by her questioning. In lessons of this kind,\r\nthe main work of the teacher is to ascertain what the pupil knows and to\r\nsystematize her knowledge.\r\n\r\nA typewritten sheet of directions may be given each pupil to hang in her\r\nroom, and may serve as an incentive to her to perform the duties\r\noutlined.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS FOR THE DAILY CARE OF A BED-ROOM\r\n\r\n1. Open the window, if it has been closed during dressing.\r\n\r\n2. Throw the bed-clothing over the foot of the bed, using a chair to\r\nhold it from the floor, or place it over two chairs near the window.\r\n\r\n3. Put night clothing to air.\r\n\r\n4. Put away any other clothing in drawers and closet.\r\n\r\n5. Tidy and dust the top of the dressing-table.\r\n\r\n6. Make the bed, after it has been aired at least half an hour.\r\n\r\nOnce a week the following work should be added:\r\n\r\n1. The blankets and comforter should be hung outside to air.\r\n\r\n2. The mattress should be turned, and fresh bed-linen placed on the bed.\r\n\r\n3. The room should be thoroughly swept and dusted.\r\n\r\nAfter the pupils have had training in the care of their bed-rooms, this\r\nexperience, together with their lessons in cleaning, should enable them\r\nto keep any of the other rooms in the house in good order.\r\n\r\nIt should be pointed out that, in these days of sanitary building and\r\nfurnishing, there is no necessity for the semi-annual "housecleaning" of\r\nformer times. Each week the house can be thoroughly gone over, with the\r\nexception of laundering curtains and washing wood-work, and these duties\r\nmight be taken in turn, a room at a time every week, so that the work\r\nwill not accumulate.\r\n\r\nThe class should be taught to consider the economy of time and energy\r\nand encouraged to provide themselves with all the latest aids they can\r\nafford.\r\n\r\nThe cleaning methods which are necessary for this work and which have\r\nnot been formally taught, should now be definitely outlined. These are\r\nthe weekly sweeping, weekly dusting, and cleaning special metals.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS FOR WEEKLY SWEEPING\r\n\r\n1. Dust and put away all small articles.\r\n\r\n2. Lift the small rugs, sweep them on both sides, out-of-doors if\r\npossible, and leave them to air. Rugs too large to take out should be\r\nbrushed and folded over to allow of sweeping the under side and wiping\r\nthe floor beneath.\r\n\r\n3. Cover the furniture with dust sheets.\r\n\r\n4. Shut the doors and open a window.\r\n\r\n5. Begin at the side of the room farthest from the door and sweep toward\r\nthe centre; sweep from the other side toward the centre; gather the dust\r\nin a dust-pan and empty it into the garbage pail or fire.\r\n\r\n6. Put away the broom and dust-pan.\r\n\r\n7. Leave the room shut up for a few minutes, in order to allow the dust\r\nto settle.\r\n\r\n8. Use a "dustless" mop to dust the floor.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS FOR WEEKLY DUSTING\r\n\r\n1. Use a soft cotton or cheesecloth duster very slightly dampened.\r\n\r\n2. Roll up the covers that are over the furniture and carry them\r\noutside, in order to shake off the dust.\r\n\r\n3. Wipe the dust from the furniture, pictures, window-sills, ledges,\r\ndoors, and baseboard, being careful not to scatter it in the air.\r\n\r\n4. Change the duster when necessary.\r\n\r\n5. Replace the small articles.\r\n\r\n6. Wash and dry the dusters.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARE AND CLEANING OF METALS\r\n\r\nIRON OR STEEL\r\n\r\nUtensils made of these are heavy, but strong and durable, and hold the\r\nheat well.\r\n\r\n1. Care:\r\n\r\n        They must be kept dry and smooth. Moisture\r\n        causes rust, roughens the surfaces of the\r\n        utensils, and makes them more difficult to\r\n        clean. If they are not to be used for some\r\n        time, the surfaces should be greased or coated\r\n        with paraffin.\r\n\r\n2. Cleaning:\r\n\r\n        (1) Wash in hot soap-suds, rinse in hot water,\r\n            and dry thoroughly.\r\n\r\n        (2) If food is burned on, scour with some\r\n            gritty material or boil in a solution of\r\n            washing soda, rinse in hot water, and dry\r\n            thoroughly.\r\n\r\n\r\nTIN\r\n\r\nUtensils made of this are light and inexpensive; they are good\r\nconductors of heat, but they are also good radiators and lose heat\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\n1. Care:\r\n\r\n        As tinware is steel or iron coated with liquid\r\n        tin, the grades vary according to the\r\n        "base-metal" used and the thickness of the\r\n        coating. Utensils made of this metal must be\r\n        carefully kept from scratches, since deep\r\n        scratches expose the base-metal and allow the\r\n        formation of rust.\r\n\r\n2. Cleaning:\r\n\r\n        (1) Wash in hot soap-suds, rinse, and dry\r\n            thoroughly.\r\n\r\n        (2) If food is burned on, boil in a weak\r\n            solution of washing soda, rinse in hot water,\r\n            and dry thoroughly.\r\n\r\n        NOTE.--Whiting may be used to brighten the tin,\r\n        but scouring is not recommended, as it wears\r\n        off the coating.\r\n\r\n\r\nGRANITE AND ENAMEL WARE\r\n\r\nUtensils made of this are attractive, not heavy, and they do not tarnish\r\nor rust.\r\n\r\n1. Care:\r\n\r\n        These wares are made by coating steel or\r\n        sheet-iron with a specially prepared glassy\r\n        substance called enamel or glaze. Two or three\r\n        coats are applied. The durability depends on\r\n        the ingredients used in the glaze and on the\r\n        number of coats applied.\r\n\r\n        Such utensils should be heated gradually,\r\n        scraped carefully, and handled without\r\n        knocking, to avoid "chipping".\r\n\r\n2. Cleaning:\r\n\r\n        (1) Wash in hot soap-suds.\r\n\r\n        (2) If stained, use some scouring powder; wash\r\n            and dry.\r\n\r\n        (3) If food is burned on, boil in a solution of\r\n            washing soda and then scour; wash and dry.\r\n\r\n\r\nALUMINIUM\r\n\r\nUtensils made of this are very light in weight and, as they have no\r\ncrevices, are easily cleaned. They are also good conductors of heat.\r\n\r\n1. Care:\r\n\r\n        This metal warps under a high temperature, and\r\n        should, therefore, be used with care. Do not\r\n        turn the gas on full, or, if used over wood or\r\n        coal fires, be sure to leave the stove lid on.\r\n\r\n        Some foods injure the metal, if they are\r\n        allowed to remain in it very long.\r\n\r\n2. Cleaning:\r\n\r\n        (1) Wash in hot water, with mild soap. Alkalies\r\n            should not be used, as they darken the surface.\r\n\r\n        (2) If food is burned on, the dish should be\r\n            soaked in water and then scoured with bathbrick\r\n            or emery powder.\r\n\r\n        (3) Whiting may be used to brighten it.\r\n\r\n\r\nZINC\r\n\r\nThis is not used for utensils, but for table tops and for placing under\r\nstoves, etc.\r\n\r\nCleaning:\r\n\r\n        (1) Use hot water and mild soap. Alkalies and\r\n            acids affect zinc and should be used with care.\r\n\r\n        (2) If stained, rub with coal-oil or a paste\r\n            made of coal-oil and soda, and then wash in hot\r\n            water.\r\n\r\n\r\nGALVANIZED IRON\r\n\r\nThis is used for garbage pails, ash pans, stove pipes, etc. It is made\r\nby dipping sheet-iron into melted zinc.\r\n\r\nCleaning:\r\n\r\n        The same as for zinc.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOPPER OR BRASS\r\n\r\nUtensils made of these are heavy but durable and are good conductors of\r\nheat. They are dangerous, if not properly cleaned.\r\n\r\nCleaning:\r\n\r\n        (1) Wash in hot water, using a little washing\r\n            soda to remove any grease, rinse well, and dry.\r\n\r\n        (2) If stained or tarnished, scour with salt\r\n            and vinegar, then rinse thoroughly, and dry.\r\n\r\n\r\nSILVER\r\n\r\nThis is used for spoons, knives, forks, and serving dishes, but never\r\nfor cooking utensils, on account of its cost. It is the best conductor\r\nof heat among the house metals.\r\n\r\nCleaning:\r\n\r\n        (1) Wash in hot soap-suds.\r\n\r\n        (2) If stained or tarnished, use whiting or\r\n            silver polish, wash, and dry.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPE FOR SILVER POLISH\r\n\r\n        2 tbsp. borax\r\n        1 cup boiling water\r\n        1/2 cup alcohol whiting.\r\n\r\n        1. Dissolve the borax in the water.\r\n\r\n        2. When cold, add the alcohol and enough\r\n        whiting to make a thin cream.\r\n\r\n        3. Bottle, and shake when used.\r\n\r\n        NOTE.--The care and cleaning of the metals out\r\n        of which ordinary utensils are made, such as\r\n        granite ware, tin, and steel, may be taught\r\n        incidentally as the utensils are used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nFORM IV: JUNIOR GRADE (Continued)\r\n\r\nLAUNDRY WORK\r\n\r\n\r\nThis work is but a continuation of the lessons on cleaning. It is the\r\nprocess of removing foreign matter from cotton, linen, woollen, or silk\r\nfabrics by the use of water and additional cleansing agents. It also\r\nincludes the finishing of these materials by the use of blueing, starch,\r\nand heated irons, to restore as far as possible their original\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\nThe principles of laundry work have been taught in the washing of dish\r\ncloths and towels, and now these principles have only to be extended to\r\nwhite cotton and linen clothes of any kind.\r\n\r\nThe pupils may be asked to bring soiled articles of white linen or\r\ncotton from home for use at school in exemplifying the necessary\r\nprocesses. In schools which lack an equipment, these processes may be\r\ndiscussed in class and then practised at home. The teacher should choose\r\nfrom the following outline what is most suitable to the class:\r\n\r\n\r\nOUTLINE OF LESSONS ON THE WASHING OF WHITE COTTON AND LINEN CLOTHES\r\n\r\nLESSON I\r\n\r\n\r\nMATERIALS\r\n\r\n1. Water:\r\n\r\n        (1) Use:\r\n            (_a_) To soften and dissolve certain foreign\r\n                  substances in the clothes.\r\n            (_b_) To carry away all the foreign matter that\r\n                  has been dissolved or rubbed out of the\r\n                  clothes.\r\n\r\n        (_2_) Kinds:\r\n            (_a_) _Hard water_\r\n            (_b_) _Soft water_\r\n\r\n        For laundry purposes, the water should be soft.\r\n        The quality known as hardness, which some water\r\n        has, is due to the lime which it has dissolved\r\n        in making its way through the earth.\r\n\r\n        Water is said to be temporarily or permanently\r\n        hard according to the kind of lime it has in\r\n        solution. Temporarily hard water may be\r\n        softened by boiling; the lime will be\r\n        deposited, as may be seen in the "furring" of\r\n        tea-kettles. Boiling has no effect in softening\r\n        permanently hard water, so a substance known as\r\n        an _alkali_ is used for this purpose.\r\n\r\n       (3) Methods of softening water by alkalies.--For\r\n           each gallon of water use one of the following:\r\n           (_a_) One tablespoonful of borax or ammonia\r\n                 dissolved in one cup of water.\r\n           (_b_) Two tablespoonfuls of a solution made by\r\n                 dissolving one pound of washing soda in one\r\n                 quart of boiling water.\r\n           (_c_) One fourth tablespoonful of lye dissolved\r\n                in one cup of water.\r\n\r\n2. Alkalies (borax, ammonia, washing soda, lye):\r\n\r\n        (1) Use:\r\n            (_a_) To soften hard water\r\n            (_b_) To assist in dissolving greasy\r\n                  substances.\r\n\r\n        (2) Kinds:\r\n            (_a_) _Borax._--This alkali is one of the\r\n                  mildest, and for this reason is less harmful to\r\n                  the clothing. It is useful when an alkali is\r\n                  required to soften water for coloured clothes\r\n                  or woollens. It also has a tendency to keep\r\n                  white clothes a good colour.\r\n            (_b_) _Ammonia._--This also is a mild alkali,\r\n                  but is apt to "yellow" white materials. As it\r\n                  is very volatile, it should not be used unless\r\n                  the washing can be done quickly.\r\n            (_c_) _Washing soda._--This is a cheap\r\n                  substance and stronger than borax or ammonia.\r\n                  It should be made into a solution before it is\r\n                  used, for fear of too great strength.\r\n\r\n            (_d_) _Lye, or caustic soda._--This alkali is\r\n                  very strong and should be employed with great\r\n                  care. It must not be used except in weak\r\n                  solutions, otherwise it would entirely dissolve\r\n                  fabrics. It is not advisable for home laundry\r\n                  work.\r\n\r\n3. Soap:\r\n\r\n        (1) Use.--To act on greasy matter.\r\n\r\n        Soap-suds penetrate fabrics more completely\r\n        than water alone, and when the soap comes in\r\n        contact with fatty material, it _emulsifies_\r\n        it, that is, very finely divides it into minute\r\n        particles, so that it can be easily removed. If\r\n        a soap is used that contains free alkali, this\r\n        substance unites with the greasy impurities to\r\n        form new soap which has cleansing value.\r\n\r\n        (2) Kinds.--(_a_) Neutral, (_b_) medium, (_c_)\r\n            strong.\r\n\r\n        All soap is a compound of an alkali and fat,\r\n        and according as one or the other of these\r\n        substances predominates, the kind of soap is\r\n        determined.\r\n\r\n        When just enough alkali is used to completely\r\n        _saponify_ the amount of fat, the product is\r\n        called a neutral, or mild, soap. When an excess\r\n        of alkali is present, the soap is termed medium\r\n        or strong, according to the amount of free\r\n        alkali it contains.\r\n\r\n        A mild soap should be used when free alkali\r\n        would be injurious, as in washing woollens or\r\n        fabrics that have delicate colours.\r\n\r\n4. Soap substitutes, or adjuncts:\r\n\r\n        (1) Use.--To act alone or with soap in exerting\r\n            a solvent action on greasy impurities, so that\r\n            the cleansing process may be facilitated.\r\n\r\n        (2) Kinds:\r\n            (_a_) _Alkalies._--These must be used in excess\r\n                  of the amount needed for softening the water.\r\n            (_b_) _Harmless solvents, such as turpentine,\r\n                  paraffin, coal-oil, gasolene._--The clothing\r\n                  must be well rinsed to get rid of any odour.\r\n            (_c_) _Washing powders._--These are prepared\r\n                  mixtures of soap and some other solvent of\r\n                  greasy matter.\r\n\r\n5. Blueing:\r\n\r\n        (1) Use.--To make clothes which have a yellow\r\n            tinge appear whiter in colour.\r\n\r\n        (2) Kinds.--There are several kinds on the\r\n            market, but the names of these will be of no\r\n            value to the class.\r\n\r\n        NOTE.--Sufficient blueing should be used to\r\n        make the blueing water a pale sky-blue colour\r\n        when a little of it is lifted in the hand.\r\n\r\n6. Starch:\r\n\r\n        (1) Use:\r\n            (_a_) To stiffen fabrics and thus improve their\r\n                  appearance.\r\n            (_b_) To give fabrics a glazed surface, so that\r\n                  they will shed dust and other impurities.\r\n\r\n        (2) Kinds.--(_a_) Cold starch, (_b_) boiled starch.\r\n\r\n        Raw starch does not give as durable a finish as\r\n        cooked starch, but it does give greater\r\n        stiffness. A fabric will take up more starch in\r\n        the raw form, and the heat of the iron cooks\r\n        the starch, thus producing the stiffness. The\r\n        "body", or stiffness, produced by cooked starch\r\n        is usually preferable, though on account of its\r\n        preparation, it is not so convenient to use.\r\n\r\n        (3) Recipes for starch--\r\n            (_a_) Cold Starch\r\n\r\n          2   tbsp. laundry starch\r\n          1/2 tsp. borax\r\n          2   cups cold water.\r\n\r\nDissolve the borax in a little boiling water. Add the cold water\r\ngradually to the starch and mix thoroughly. Add the dissolved borax and\r\nstir well before using.\r\n\r\n            (_b_) Boiled Starch\r\n\r\n          2   tbsp. starch\r\n          4   tbsp. cold water\r\n          1/2 tsp. lard, butter, or paraffin\r\n          1   qt. boiling water.\r\n\r\nMix the starch with the cold water until free from lumps. Add the lard,\r\nthen gradually stir in the boiling water, and keep stirring until\r\nthickened. Cook fifteen minutes and use hot.\r\n\r\n        NOTE.--Borax in starch gives greater gloss and\r\n        increases the stiffness. It also gives more\r\n        lasting stiffness. Lard, butter, or wax is used\r\n        to give a smoother finish and to prevent the\r\n        starch from sticking to the iron.\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON II\r\n\r\nPREPARATION FOR WASHING WHITE LINEN OR COTTON CLOTHES\r\n\r\n        1. Sort the clothes:  (1) Table linen and clean towels\r\n                              (2) Bed and body linen\r\n                              (3) Handkerchiefs\r\n                              (4) Soiled towels and cloths.\r\n        2. Mend the clothes.\r\n        3. Remove stains.\r\n        4. Look after necessary materials.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROCESS OF WASHING WHITE LINEN OR COTTON CLOTHES\r\n\r\n  _Steps_               _Method_\r\n\r\n1. Soaking:\r\n\r\n        Wet the clothes; rub the soiled parts with soap\r\n        and roll each article separately; pack in a\r\n        tub, placing the clothing most soiled at the\r\n        bottom; cover with warm soapy water and soak\r\n        from one hour to over night.\r\n\r\n        The soaking softens and loosens the fibres of\r\n        fabrics, so that the foreign matter in them can\r\n        be more easily separated. It also dissolves the\r\n        soluble impurities in the fabrics.\r\n\r\n2. Rubbing:\r\n\r\n        Wring the clothes out of the soaking water, and\r\n        place them in a tub of clean warm water or\r\n        soap-suds; rub the soiled parts first on one\r\n        side and then on the other, using the knuckles,\r\n        a washboard, or a washing-machine. When each\r\n        piece is clean, wring it tightly.\r\n\r\n        The rubbing scrapes or rubs out the foreign\r\n        matter which has been loosened by the soaking.\r\n\r\n3. Rinsing:\r\n\r\n        Shake out each piece and put it into a tub of\r\n        clear water; rub, and move about in the water\r\n        to get rid of any soiled water that the clothes\r\n        may contain; wring tightly.\r\n\r\n4. Boiling:\r\n\r\n        Shake out each piece and place it in a boiler\r\n        of cold water with or without soap; bring to\r\n        boiling heat, and boil briskly for twenty\r\n        minutes.\r\n\r\n        The boiling kills any germs and assists in\r\n        whitening the clothes.\r\n\r\n5. Rinsing:\r\n\r\n        Lift the clothes from the boiling water by\r\n        means of a clothes stick and place them in a\r\n        tub of clear, cold water; proceed as in the\r\n        first rinsing.\r\n\r\n6. Blueing:\r\n\r\n        Open out each piece and place one or two at a\r\n        time in a tub of blueing water for just a\r\n        moment; wring tightly, and shake out each\r\n        piece.\r\n\r\n        The blueing tends to counteract any yellow\r\n        tinge in the clothes, making them appear\r\n        whiter.\r\n\r\n7. Starching:\r\n\r\n        Dip one piece at a time into the starch mixture\r\n        until well saturated; then wring.\r\n\r\n        Only certain articles or parts of articles will\r\n        require this part of the process, to give them\r\n        body or stiffness and, it may be, glossiness.\r\n\r\n8. Hanging:\r\n\r\n        Shake out each piece thoroughly; fasten to a\r\n        clothes-line or hang on a rack to allow the\r\n        moisture to evaporate. This should be\r\n        out-of-doors in the sunlight if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nREMOVAL OF STAINS\r\n\r\nForeign matter which is difficult or impossible to remove by the\r\nordinary washing process is called a _stain_. Such matter is not\r\ndissolved by the usual cleansing agents used in laundry work, such as\r\nwater and soap, but requires some special solvent to act on it. The\r\nchoice of the agent to be used will depend on the nature of the foreign\r\nmatter to be removed. In some cases it is difficult to find an agent\r\nwhich will not act also on the colour of the fabric; in other cases to\r\nfind one which does not injure the fibre of the goods.\r\n\r\nThe pupils should be asked to give instances from their own experience\r\nwhere special solvents were used to remove stains, and be required to\r\nmake a list of these. If necessary, the teacher should supplement this\r\nlist with the names of other agents and the methods of using them.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUTLINE OF LESSONS ON THE WASHING OF WOOLLENS\r\n\r\nThe washing of woollen materials is part of the Course for the work of\r\nthe Senior Grade of Form IV, but, for the sake of convenience, the\r\nlaundry lessons of both Grades of Form IV are outlined in one section of\r\nthis Manual.\r\n\r\nBefore allowing the class any practice in this branch of laundry work,\r\nit will be necessary for the teacher to make certain principles very\r\nclear:\r\n\r\n1. That wool is an animal product. As such it tends to be shrunken and\r\nhardened by (1) heat, (2) alkalies.\r\n\r\n2. That the surface of each wool fibre woven into woollen materials is\r\nseen under the microscope to be covered with notches, or scales. If\r\nthese notches in any way become entangled, the material is thereby drawn\r\nup, or "shrunken".\r\n\r\n3. That these notches may be entangled by:\r\n\r\n        (1) Wetting the woollen material and then\r\n            rubbing or twisting it. When the fibres are\r\n            wet, they expand somewhat and the projecting\r\n            scales, or notches, are loosened. If the\r\n            material is rubbed at this time, the notched\r\n            edges interlock.\r\n\r\n        (2) The use of strong soaps or alkalies. These\r\n            act chemically on the fibres and soften and\r\n            expand them, causing the notched edges to\r\n            become so prominent that they catch in one\r\n            another.\r\n\r\n        NOTE.--The structure of woollen fibres may be\r\n        sketched on the black-board and compared with\r\n        those of cotton and linen.\r\n\r\nTo impress the foregoing principles, a few experiments will be found\r\nmost useful.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPERIMENTS WITH CLOTH MADE OF WOOL FIBRE\r\n\r\n1. Boil a piece of new woollen cloth for five minutes. Dry, and compare\r\nwith an original piece.\r\n\r\n2. Saturate a piece of new woollen cloth with a strong solution of\r\nwashing soda. Dry, and compare with an original piece.\r\n\r\n3. Wash a piece of new woollen cloth in each of the following ways:\r\n\r\n        (1) By rubbing soap directly on the cloth and\r\n            then sousing the goods in the water.\r\n\r\n        (2) By using a soap solution instead of the\r\n            soap, as in (1).\r\n\r\n        (3) By rubbing on a wash-board.\r\n\r\nIn each case dry the cloth and compare with an original piece.\r\n\r\nAfter the results of the experiments have been discussed, the pupils may\r\nformulate a series of "points" to be observed in the washing of woollen\r\nfabrics.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cotton fibres magnified]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Linen fibres magnified]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Woollen fibres magnified]\r\n\r\n\r\nPOINTS IN WASHING WOOLLENS\r\n\r\n1. Use lukewarm, soft water.\r\n\r\n2. Do not use strong soaps or alkalies.\r\n\r\n3. Do not rub soap directly on the woollen material, but use soap\r\nsolutions.\r\n\r\n4. Do not rub or twist woollen cloth when it is wet.\r\n\r\n5. Do not boil to sterilize.\r\n\r\n6. Do not dry in extreme heat.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEPS IN WASHING WOOLLEN MATERIALS\r\n\r\n1. Shake or brush the clothing to free it from dust.\r\n\r\n2. Put it into lukewarm, soapy water to soak for a few minutes.\r\n\r\n3. Wash on both sides by squeezing and sousing in the water.\r\n\r\n4. Rinse in clear, lukewarm water; use several waters, if necessary, to\r\nremove the soap.\r\n\r\n5. Pass through a loosely set wringer or squeeze the water out by hand.\r\n\r\n6. Shake, in order to raise the woolly fibres.\r\n\r\n7. Dry in a moderate temperature, in a wind, if possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nFORM IV: SENIOR GRADE\r\n\r\nFOODS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Senior Fourth class is the preparatory class for entrance into the\r\nhigh school, and for many girls it is the final school year. For this\r\nreason the Course of this year should cover as many of the remaining\r\nhousehold operations as possible.\r\n\r\nThe training of the previous years should have formed good habits of\r\nwork and have given experience in ordinary cleaning, and in the cooking\r\nand serving of the simple food materials. Through this training the\r\npupils should also have been impressed with the value of food, and\r\nshould have learned the sources of food and of all well-known household\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\nThe training of this last year, while continuing the Junior work, should\r\nalso emphasize the household processes that require greater mental\r\ndevelopment to understand and greater practical skill to carry out. It\r\nis the border year between the public school and the high school, and\r\nmust necessarily anticipate the elementary science of the latter. In\r\nthis year more responsibility should be given to the pupils and more\r\noriginality should be expected of them. Where they have hitherto\r\nfollowed recipes and been given rules, they should now follow principles\r\nand deduce rules.\r\n\r\nOf the several topics outlined in the Course for Form IV Senior, it is\r\nadvisable to start with the preservation of food. Fruit and vegetables\r\nare most plentiful when the school year opens, and September is the\r\nmost opportune month to preserve these for winter use. Facts concerning\r\nfood preservation may have been taken incidentally in previous lessons,\r\nbut now the subject should be systematically taught, so that canning,\r\npreserving, and pickling may be intelligently practised.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESERVATION OF FOOD\r\n\r\nCAUSE OF DECAY\r\n\r\nThe lesson may be introduced by referring to the unusual attention given\r\nto fruit at the time of ripening. The economical housekeeper takes\r\ncertain foods when they are most plentiful and preserves them for use\r\nwhen they are not in season. Some foods require special care to keep\r\nthem from decaying. The decay is caused by the action of microscopic\r\nplants called "bacteria", which get into the food.\r\n\r\n\r\nBACTERIA\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for any one to get a correct conception of bacteria;\r\nespecially is it so for children. The teacher should be most careful not\r\nto attempt to give the class unimportant details, but the few necessary\r\nfacts should be made very clear and real. The following points should be\r\nimpressed:\r\n\r\n1. Bacteria are plants. (This fact should be kept clearly in mind.)\r\n\r\n2. They are microscopic in size and hence the more difficult to deal\r\nwith.\r\n\r\n3. They are found everywhere that there is life--in the air, in water,\r\nin the soil.\r\n\r\n4. They multiply very rapidly under favourable conditions.\r\n\r\n5. Some bacteria are useful to the housekeeper; many kinds are her\r\nenemies.\r\n\r\n6. Some of these enemies get into food and, growing there, cause a\r\nchange in it--then we say the food is spoiled.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONDITIONS OF BACTERIAL GROWTH\r\n\r\nAll plants have the same requirements. Any well-known plant may be put\r\nbefore the class to help them to think of these. They must be told that\r\nmicroscopic plants differ from other plants in one respect; they do not\r\nneed light. Hence bacterial requirements are as follows: (1) water, (2)\r\nfood, (3) air (oxygen), (4) heat.\r\n\r\nThe class should be led to see that if any one of these conditions is\r\nremoved, the remaining ones are insufficient for the plant\'s activity.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEANS OF OVERCOMING BACTERIA\r\n\r\nTo the housekeeper, preserving food means overcoming bacteria. There are\r\nonly two ways of doing this, either of which may be chosen:\r\n\r\n1. Kill the bacteria in the food and exclude others.\r\n\r\n2. Subject the food to conditions which are unfavourable for bacterial\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\nIn the first way, extreme heat is used to kill the bacteria in the food,\r\nand then while hot, the food is sealed to keep out other bacteria:\r\nExample, canning.\r\n\r\nIn the second way, conditions are made unfavourable to the bacteria in\r\nthe food, as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The bacteria are deprived of water; the food is dried.\r\n\r\n2. The bacteria are deprived of sufficient heat to be active; cold\r\nstorage is used.\r\n\r\n3. Large quantities of certain substances which are detrimental to the\r\ngrowth of bacteria are put into the food, and the bacteria become\r\ninactive. Examples: salt, sugar, spices, vinegar, smoke, or certain\r\nchemicals.\r\n\r\nWhen the lesson is finished, the class is ready to practise the\r\nprinciples it involves. The lessons on the special preservation of fruit\r\nmay follow at once.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Utensils used in canning]\r\n\r\n\r\nCANNING\r\n\r\nAs canning is the method of preservation most commonly used, practice\r\nshould be given in this method. In rural schools with a limited\r\nequipment, it may be that only one jar can be prepared. In other\r\nschools, it may be impossible to provide each pupil with material for\r\nwork, on account of the expense. In the latter case, the materials may\r\nall be brought from home, or each pupil may bring her own jar and fruit,\r\nand the school supply the sugar.\r\n\r\nInstruction on the care of jars and the preparation of fruit and syrup\r\nmust precede the practical work.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARE OF JARS\r\n\r\n1. See that the jars are air-tight; partly fill the jar with water;\r\nplace rubbers, covers, and rims; screw tightly, and invert. If any water\r\noozes out, the jar is not air-tight. Often an extra rubber will correct\r\nthe trouble.\r\n\r\n2. Wash the jars thoroughly with the aid of a small brush.\r\n\r\n3. Sterilize the jars in every part; dip them in boiling water, or place\r\nthem on a rest (folded paper or wooden slats) in a kettle, to prevent\r\nthe jars from touching the bottom. Fill and surround them with tepid\r\nwater, then place them over heat until the water boils. Keep them in the\r\nboiling water until ready to fill with fruit. Dip the rubber bands in\r\nboiling water, but do not allow them to remain in it. Use new rubbers\r\neach season.\r\n\r\n4. When filling the jars, place them on a folded cloth wrung out of warm\r\nwater, then seal, and invert until cool.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARATION OF FRUIT\r\n\r\nUse fresh, sound fruit, not too ripe.\r\n\r\n1. Berries.--Pick over, wash in a strainer, and hull.\r\n\r\n2. Currants, gooseberries.--Pick over, wash, remove ends and stems.\r\n\r\n3. Cherries.--Pick over, wash, remove stones and stems.\r\n\r\n4. Plums.--Pick over, wash, remove stems, and prick three or four times\r\nwith a silver fork, in order to prevent the steam bursting the skin.\r\n\r\n5. Pears, apples.--Pick over, wash, pare, and, to prevent discoloration,\r\nkeep in cold water until used.\r\n\r\n6. Peaches.--Pick over, plunge into boiling water a few seconds (using a\r\nwire basket), then into cold water; peel; drop into cold water to\r\nprevent discoloration.\r\n\r\n\r\nSYRUP FOR CANNING\r\n\r\nUse about 1 cup of water for each pint can.\r\n\r\nNo. 1 Syrup.--Equal parts of sugar and water, or 1 cup of water and 1\r\ncup of sugar.\r\n\r\nNo. 2 Syrup.--1 1/2 cups of water and 1 cup of sugar.\r\n\r\n1. Use No. 1 syrup for watery fruits and acid fruits.\r\n\r\n2. Use No. 2 syrup for pears, peaches, sweet plums, sweet cherries, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF CANNING\r\n\r\n1. Fruit cooked in a steamer:\r\n\r\n        Fill the sterilized jars with prepared fruit,\r\n        with or without syrup. Place the covers, but do\r\n        not fasten them down. Stand the jars in a\r\n        steamer over cold water. Cover the steamer and\r\n        heat to the boiling point. Steam at least\r\n        fifteen minutes, or until the fruit is tender.\r\n        Remove from the steamer, fill to overflowing\r\n        with boiling syrup, and seal at once. Invert.\r\n\r\n2. Fruit cooked in a boiler:\r\n\r\n        Put a false bottom in the boiler, to prevent\r\n        the jars from being broken. Fill the jars with\r\n        fruit, and add syrup if desired. Cover and\r\n        place the jars in the boiler without touching\r\n        one another. Pour in tepid water to within an\r\n        inch of the top of the jars and bring gradually\r\n        to boiling heat. Cook and finish as directed in\r\n        1, above.\r\n\r\n3. Fruit cooked in an oven:\r\n\r\n        Fill sterilized, hot jars with prepared raw\r\n        fruit and cover with hot syrup. Place the jars\r\n        in a moderate oven, in a baking dish containing\r\n        about an inch or two of hot water. Cook and\r\n        finish as in 1, above.\r\n\r\n4. Fruit cooked in a kettle:\r\n\r\n        Make a syrup in a fairly deep kettle. Put the\r\n        prepared fruit into it and cook gently until\r\n        tender. When the fruit is cooked, lift\r\n        carefully into hot, sterilized jars, and fill\r\n        to overflowing with boiling syrup. Seal at once\r\n        and invert.\r\n\r\n        NOTE.--By Methods 1, 2, and 3 the fruit is kept\r\n        more perfect in shape and loses less flavour\r\n        than by Method 4. Methods 2 and 4 are best to\r\n        choose for class practice.\r\n\r\nAfter the lesson in Canning, it may not be wise to take the school time\r\nfor further practice in the preservation of fruit. When such is the\r\ncase, the theory of jam and jelly making may be discussed in class for\r\nhome practice. The notes of these lessons may appear as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nJAMS AND PRESERVES\r\n\r\nPOINTS IN MAKING JAM\r\n\r\n1. In this method sugar is the preservative, therefore the amount used\r\nmust be large.\r\n\r\n2. The quantity of sugar used is from three quarters to one pound of\r\nsugar to each pound of fruit. Little or no water is used.\r\n\r\n3. The natural shape and appearance of the fruit is not kept.\r\n\r\n4. The flavour of the fruit is not so natural, on account of the\r\nexcessive sweetness.\r\n\r\n5. The jar need not be sealed, but merely covered.\r\n\r\n\r\nJELLY\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITION OF JELLY\r\n\r\n1. Jelly is made from certain fruit juices and sugar.\r\n\r\n2. The fruit juice must contain a certain amount of _pectin_, or\r\njellying principle, and also a certain amount of acid.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARTS OF FRUIT CONTAINING MOST PECTIN\r\n\r\n    (1) Skin, (2) core, (3) pits and seeds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Utensils used in making jelly]\r\n\r\n\r\nFRUITS CONTAINING MOST PECTIN\r\n\r\n1. Currants\r\n\r\n2. Crab-apples, apples\r\n\r\n3. Quinces\r\n\r\n4. Cranberries, blackberries, raspberries\r\n\r\n5. Grapes, if rather green.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHOD OF MAKING JELLY\r\n\r\n1. Cut up the prepared fruit if necessary, and add barely enough water\r\nfor cooking.\r\n\r\n2. Set over the heat and simmer gently until the cellulose is very soft.\r\n\r\n3. Turn into a jelly-bag, and drain for a number of hours or over night,\r\nin order to get rid of the cellulose.\r\n\r\n4. Measure the drained juice and take the same quantity of sugar.\r\n\r\n5. Heat the sugar in the oven.\r\n\r\n6. Boil the juice gently and steadily for twenty minutes, skimming when\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n7. Add the hot sugar and boil very gently from three to five minutes, or\r\nuntil the mixture will jelly when tested.\r\n\r\n8. Empty at once into hot glasses and set to cool.\r\n\r\n9. When cold and firm, cover and set in a cool, dark place.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF COVERING JAM OR JELLY\r\n\r\n1. Melt paraffin and pour a layer on each glass, cover with a tin cover\r\nor paper pasted with egg-white.\r\n\r\n2. Cut clean, white paper to fit the glass, and lay on the jelly when it\r\nis firm and cold. Place the cover or paper as in 1, above.\r\n\r\n\r\nPICKLING\r\n\r\nWhere the teacher finds it desirable, a lesson should now be given on\r\npickling, with or without class practice. At least one or two good\r\nrecipes may be given for home use.\r\n\r\nThere are no new principles to teach. The use of vinegar, salt, and\r\nspices as preservatives should be reviewed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nFORM IV: SENOR GRADE (Continued)\r\n\r\nCOOKERY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first work in cookery, for this Form, should consist of practice\r\nlessons, which will test the ability of the class in cooking the simple\r\nanimal and vegetable foods. The recipes used for these should be such as\r\nto attract the interest of the pupils, and each may be a combination of\r\nseveral food materials. Cream soups, custards, scalloped dishes, and\r\nshepherd\'s pie, would be useful for this purpose.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable that this test shall be made in as few lessons as\r\npossible, because nearly all the time in cookery for this year will be\r\nrequired for the new work, namely, a series of lessons on flour\r\nmixtures.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUTLINE OF LESSON ON FLOUR\r\n\r\nFlour is a food substance ground into a powder.\r\n\r\n1. Sources of flour:\r\n\r\n        (1) Certain cereals--wheat, rye, barley,\r\n            buckwheat, rice\r\n\r\n        (2) Potatoes.\r\n\r\n2. Kinds of flour made from wheat:\r\n\r\n        (1) Graham flour--the entire wheat seed is\r\n            ground.\r\n\r\n        (2) Whole wheat flour--the first outer coat of\r\n            cellulose with its valuable mineral contents is\r\n            removed before the seed is ground.\r\n\r\n        (3) White flour--only the central white part of\r\n            the seed is ground.\r\n\r\n        NOTE.--The pupils should be given specimens of\r\n        fall wheat to examine, so as to compare the\r\n        outer coat of cellulose with the central white\r\n        part of the grain.\r\n\r\n3. Composition of white flour:\r\n\r\n        (1) Starch--a fine, granular, white substance\r\n\r\n        (2) Gluten--a sticky, yellowish, elastic\r\n            substance (a protein food).\r\n\r\nTo find the substances in white flour, each pupil should mix half a cup\r\nof bread flour with enough cold water to make a dough. She must then be\r\ntaught to knead it. This knowledge will be of use later in the bread\r\nlessons. After it is thoroughly kneaded until it is smooth and well\r\nblended, the dough should be washed in several waters. The first washing\r\nwater should be poured into a glass and allowed to settle, to show the\r\nstarch. After all the starch is washed away, the gluten will remain.\r\n\r\nThe gluten may then be put into a greased pan and baked, to demonstrate\r\nthat it admits of distention, and also to show that it may be stiffened\r\npermanently by heat into any distended shape. The baked gluten should be\r\nreserved to be used as a specimen in succeeding lessons.\r\n\r\n4. Kinds of wheat flour:\r\n\r\n        (1) Bread flour--contains much gluten.\r\n\r\n        (2) Pastry flour--contains little gluten.\r\n\r\n        NOTE.--Macaroni is a paste made from wheat\r\n        flour which contains much gluten.\r\n\r\n5. Tests for bread flour:\r\n\r\n        (1) The colour is a deeper cream than pastry\r\n            flour, on account of the larger amount of\r\n            gluten which it contains.\r\n\r\n        (2) When squeezed, it will not hold the impress\r\n            of the hand.\r\n\r\n        (3) When the flour is made into a dough and\r\n            washed, about one fourth of the original\r\n            quantity remains as gluten.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUTLINE OF SERIES OF LESSONS ON FLOUR MIXTURES\r\n\r\nLESSON I\r\n\r\n1. Meaning of flour mixtures:\r\n\r\n        A lightened mixture of flour and liquid, with\r\n        or without other ingredients, is called a flour\r\n        mixture.\r\n\r\n2. Kinds of flour mixtures:\r\n\r\n  (1) Batters.--(_a_) Pour batters--pancakes, popovers\r\n                (_b_) Drop batters--cake\r\n\r\n  (2) Doughs.-- (_a_) Soft dough--cookies, baking-powder\r\n                           biscuits, doughnuts\r\n                (_b_) Stiff dough--pastry.\r\n\r\n3. Methods of mixing flour mixtures:\r\n\r\n        (1) Stirring.--A roundabout movement which\r\n            simply mixes the ingredients.\r\n\r\n        (2) Beating.--An upright, circular movement,\r\n            which incorporates air into the ingredients\r\n            while being mixed.\r\n\r\n        (3) Folding.--A slow, careful beating, which\r\n            blends the ingredients without loss of the air\r\n            they contain.\r\n\r\n        (4) Kneading.--A movement of the hands to blend\r\n            the ingredients and also to incorporate air.\r\n\r\n        (5) Cutting.--A hacking movement of a knife to\r\n            mix fat through flour.\r\n\r\n4. Framework of flour mixtures:\r\n\r\n        (1) Gluten\r\n\r\n        (2) Gluten and egg-white.\r\n\r\nTo show the framework, the gluten baked in the flour lessons should be\r\nused. It should be pointed out as the skeleton of the mixture which\r\nupholds the entire structure and on which the other ingredients depend.\r\nTo have light mixtures, this framework must admit of being expanded and\r\nalso of being stiffened permanently into the stretched shape. Since\r\negg-white has both of these necessary qualities, it may be used for a\r\nframework either alone or in combination with gluten.\r\n\r\nIt should also be observed that a mixture of ingredients light in weight\r\ndoes not prevent the framework from rising as much as heavy ones do.\r\n\r\nThe pupils will see that the framework of a mixture must increase in\r\nsize in order to make the mixture light, but it must be made very clear\r\nthat, while heat stiffens any framework, it will not distend it. Some\r\nother agency is required for this.\r\n\r\n5. Lightening agents used in flour mixtures:\r\n\r\n        (1) Air.--Incorporated by beating, kneading,\r\n            and sifting.\r\n\r\n        (2) Steam.--Incorporated in the form of a\r\n            liquid which, when heated, changes to steam.\r\n\r\n        (3) Carbonic acid gas.--Formed in the mixture\r\n            by the chemical union of soda with some acid.\r\n            Examples: soda and sour milk; soda, cream of\r\n            tartar and water; soda and molasses.\r\n\r\nThe lightening agents, air and steam, may be taught from the samples of\r\nbaked gluten. Experiments will show how to produce the carbonic acid\r\ngas.\r\n\r\nExperiments:\r\n\r\n        1. Put into a thick glass 1/8 tsp. of soda and\r\n        1/4 tsp. of cream of tartar. Mix, and note the\r\n        result. Stir in 1/8 cup of cold water, and note\r\n        the result.\r\n\r\n        2. In No. 1, use hot water in place of cold,\r\n        and note the result.\r\n\r\n        3. Put 1/4 cup of sour milk in a glass. Stir\r\n        into the milk 1/4 tsp. of soda, and note the\r\n        result.\r\n\r\n        4. Put 1 tbsp. of molasses in a glass. Stir\r\n        into the molasses a pinch of soda, and note the\r\n        result.\r\n\r\nBaking-powder:\r\n\r\nIt may now be explained that, for the sake of convenience, soda and\r\ncream of tartar may be obtained already mixed, in accurate proportions\r\nof two parts of acid to one of the soda. This mixture is known as\r\nbaking-powder. As very little moisture is necessary to start the action\r\nof the powder, a little cornstarch is added to it to keep it dry. For\r\nthe same reason, it should always be kept tightly covered.\r\n\r\nSoda is made from common salt and is cheap, but the source of cream of\r\ntartar makes it expensive, so that good baking-powder cannot be low\r\npriced. If such be advertised, it is usually adulterated.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the foregoing principles of flour mixtures are understood,\r\nthey should be put into practice. The lessons on cake, bread, and pastry\r\nshould follow in the order named, with as much practical work in\r\nconnection with each as the time will allow.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAKE MAKING\r\n\r\nLESSONS II AND III\r\n\r\n1. Classes of cake:\r\n\r\n        (1) Cakes without butter.--These mixtures\r\n            contain no heavy ingredients and have little\r\n            weight depending on the framework. They are\r\n            lightened by air and steam only. Examples:\r\n            sponge cake, angel cake.\r\n\r\n        (2) Cakes with butter.--These are mixtures\r\n            having ingredients of greater weight; and the\r\n            three lightening agents--air, steam, and\r\n            carbonic acid gas are used to raise them.\r\n            Examples: pound cake, chocolate cake, nut cake,\r\n            etc.\r\n\r\n        NOTE.--Practice should be given in making at\r\n        least one of each kind of cake, to demonstrate\r\n        the method of mixing employed.\r\n\r\n2. General directions for making cake:\r\n\r\n        (1) Attend to the fire, so as to have the oven\r\n            at a proper heat.\r\n\r\n        (2) Grease the pans thoroughly; greased paper\r\n            may be used to line the bottom of the tin, but,\r\n            in the case of fruit cake, the whole tin should\r\n            be lined.\r\n\r\n        (3) Have everything ready, so that the mixing\r\n            may be quickly done.\r\n\r\n        (4) Use pastry flour.\r\n\r\n        (5) Use fine granulated sugar to ensure its\r\n            being dissolved.\r\n\r\n        (6) Blend the ingredients thoroughly, and at\r\n            the same time incorporate as large an amount of\r\n            air as possible.\r\n\r\n        (7) Fill the pan about two-thirds full, pushing\r\n            the mixture well to the corners and sides, so\r\n            as to leave a depression in the centre.\r\n\r\n        (8) Attend carefully to the baking.\r\n\r\n3. General rules for mixing cake:\r\n\r\n        (1) Cake without butter--\r\n            (_a_) Separate the yolks and whites of the\r\n                  eggs.\r\n            (_b_) Beat the yolks until thick and\r\n                  lemon-coloured.\r\n            (_c_) Add sugar to the yolks gradually and\r\n                  continue beating; add the flavouring.\r\n            (_d_) Beat the whites until stiff and dry, then\r\n                  _fold_ them into the first mixture.\r\n            (_e_) Gradually sift and fold in the flour\r\n                  until well mixed.\r\n\r\n        (2) Cake with butter--\r\n            (_a_) Cream the butter by working it with a\r\n                  wooden spoon.\r\n            (_b_) Add the sugar gradually by stirring it\r\n                  in.\r\n            (_c_) Beat the eggs until light, and add to the\r\n                  first mixture. (The eggs may be separated and\r\n                  the whites added later.)\r\n            (_d_) Add the liquid and beat until the sugar\r\n                  is thoroughly dissolved.\r\n            (_e_) Mix the flour and baking-powder in a\r\n                  sifter and gradually sift and beat it into the\r\n                  mixture until it is thoroughly blended.\r\n                  (Liquid and flour may be added alternately.)\r\n            (_f_) Fold in the stiffly beaten whites, if the\r\n                  eggs have been separated.\r\n            (_g_) If fruit, peel, nuts, etc., are used,\r\n                  they should be floured out of the quantity\r\n                  allowed for the cake and added last.\r\n\r\n4. General directions for baking cake:\r\n\r\n        (1) Small, thin cakes should be baked in a hot\r\n            oven.\r\n\r\n            Examples: cookies, layer cake.\r\n\r\n        (2) All loaf cakes require a moderate oven.\r\n\r\n        (3) In baking cakes, divide the time stated in\r\n            the recipe into quarters as follows:\r\n\r\n                First quarter--mixture should begin to rise.\r\n\r\n                Second quarter--mixture should continue rising.\r\n\r\n                Third quarter--mixture should begin to brown\r\n                    and to stiffen into shape.\r\n\r\n                Fourth quarter--mixture should finish browning\r\n                    and stiffening and shrink slightly from the\r\n                    sides of the pan.\r\n\r\n        (4) Mixture is cooked when a slight pressure\r\n            leaves no dent, or when a small skewer or fine\r\n            knitting-needle put into the centre comes out\r\n            clean and dry.\r\n\r\nTo the inexperienced minds of the girls in the Fourth Form, to whom the\r\nstudy of flour mixtures is new, the number and variety of these seems\r\nvery large. All cook books give an almost endless collection of recipes\r\nfor cakes, cookies, muffins, etc., and to the pupils each of these seems\r\nan entirely new mixture. In reality, many of them are but slight\r\nvariations of the same type. A certain mixture of materials is used for\r\na foundation, and numerous varieties are made from this by addition,\r\nsubtraction, or substitution of ingredients. The original mixture is\r\ncalled a _basic recipe_. Instead of teaching isolated mixtures, it will\r\nbe found an excellent idea to give the class the basic ingredients for a\r\nrecipe and encourage them to suggest variations, either original or from\r\nmemory.\r\n\r\nTypical basic recipes for cake and biscuits are given below:\r\n\r\n\r\nBASIC RECIPE FOR CAKE\r\n\r\n        1/4 cup butter\r\n        3/4 cup sugar\r\n        2 eggs\r\n        1/2 cup milk\r\n        1 1/2 cup flour\r\n        1/4 tsp. salt\r\n        2 tsp. baking-powder\r\n        1/2 tsp. vanilla.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIATIONS OF BASIC RECIPE FOR CAKE\r\n\r\n1. Spice cake:\r\n\r\n        To the basic recipe add 1 tbsp. of spice. Sift\r\n        in the spice with the flour.\r\n\r\n2. Nut cake:\r\n\r\n        Add 1/2 cup of chopped nuts. Increase the\r\n        baking-powder by one third. Put a little of the\r\n        flour on the nuts and beat them in at the last.\r\n\r\n3. Fruit cake:\r\n\r\n        Add 3/4 cup of currants, raisins, figs, or\r\n        dates, or a mixture of all. Increase the\r\n        baking-powder by one third. Flour the fruit and\r\n        add it last.\r\n\r\n4. Chocolate cake:\r\n\r\n        Add 1/2 cup grated chocolate. Increase the milk\r\n        by 2 tbsp. Heat the chocolate in the milk just\r\n        enough to dissolve it. Cool the mixture and use\r\n        in place of milk.\r\n\r\n\r\nBASIC RECIPE FOR BISCUITS, ETC.\r\n\r\n        2 cups flour\r\n        1/2 tsp. salt\r\n        4 tsp. baking-powder\r\n        2 tbsp. fat (butter, lard, or dripping)\r\n        About 2/3 cup milk.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIATIONS OF BASIC RECIPE FOR BISCUITS\r\n\r\n1. Sweet biscuit:\r\n\r\n        Add 2 tbsp. of sugar after the fat is added.\r\n\r\n2. Fruit biscuit:\r\n\r\n        Add 2 tbsp. of sugar and 1/2 cup of fruit,\r\n        (currants, raisins, peel, or a mixture of all)\r\n        after the fat is added.\r\n\r\n3. Scones:\r\n\r\n        Add 2 tbsp. of sugar, and use one egg and only\r\n        1/2 cup of milk. Beat the egg until light, add\r\n        to milk, and use this for liquid. Form into\r\n        round cakes about eight inches in diameter, and\r\n        cut into quarters.\r\n\r\n4. Fruit scones:\r\n\r\n        Add 1/2 cup of fruit to the scone recipe.\r\n\r\n5. Short cake for fruit:\r\n\r\n        Same as scones, but double the amount of fat.\r\n\r\n6. Dumplings for stews:\r\n\r\n        Use the basic recipe, leaving out the fat.\r\n\r\n7. Steamed fruit pudding:\r\n\r\n        Use the basic recipe to make the dough that\r\n        incases the fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\nBREAD MAKING\r\n\r\nIn beginning the bread lessons, it will be found that there are no new\r\nprinciples to teach. It will, however, be necessary to explain the new\r\nmeans of producing gas which is used in this particular mixture, namely,\r\nyeast.\r\n\r\nFrom their lessons on the "Preservation of Food" and "Canning", the\r\npupils are already acquainted with one class of microscopic plants. The\r\nlittle plants, in that case, were a source of great inconvenience to the\r\nhousekeeper. Yeast may be introduced as another family of one-celled\r\nplants, but one which is most useful. Under good conditions these tiny\r\nplants will produce a large amount of carbon dioxide gas, provided they\r\nare given sufficient time. If, however, the gas be required quickly,\r\nsoda and acid must be used. For this reason, plain flour mixtures, in\r\nwhich the carbon dioxide is quickly made, are called quick breads, to\r\ndistinguish them from breads in which yeast is used. Examples of these\r\nare baking-powder biscuits, gems, corn-bread, etc.\r\n\r\nThe use of yeast is the simplest and cheapest way of obtaining carbonic\r\nacid gas, and mixtures so made remain moist longer than those in which\r\nbaking-powder is used.\r\n\r\nThroughout the introductory lesson, this fact must be kept prominently\r\nbefore the class, that yeast is a plant and, as such, requires plant\r\nconditions. The necessary conditions will be known from the lesson on\r\n"Bacteria", so that they have only to be reviewed. The pupils may be\r\ntold that although they cannot see the plants, they can very plainly see\r\nthe bubbles of gas which the plants give off when the latter are made\r\nactive under favourable conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON I\r\n\r\nOUTLINE OF LESSONS ON YEAST\r\n\r\n1. Description of yeast:\r\n\r\nYeast is a one-celled plant which can be seen only with a microscope.\r\nUnder good conditions it becomes very active and multiplies rapidly by a\r\nprocess called _budding_. It is used by the housekeeper for the carbonic\r\nacid gas it gives off.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Yeast plants magnified]\r\n\r\n2. Conditions necessary for the activity of yeast:\r\n\r\n        (1) Oxygen\r\n\r\n        (2) Water\r\n\r\n        (3) Food.--This must be sugar, or starch which\r\n            it will change into sugar. Potato starch is\r\n            more easily used by yeast than flour starch. It\r\n            uses also some nitrogenous food and mineral\r\n            matter.\r\n\r\n        (4) Heat.--The yeast plant thrives in a heat of\r\n            about the same temperature as our bodies. A\r\n            little extra heat will only make it grow\r\n            faster; but excessive heat will kill it.\r\n\r\n            Freezing will not kill the plant, though cold\r\n                makes yeast inactive.\r\n\r\n3. Sources of yeast:\r\n\r\nYeast was first found as _wild yeast_ in the air, but now it may be\r\nobtained at grocery stores, in three forms:\r\n\r\n        (1) Liquid yeast.--The plants are put into a\r\n            starchy liquid. This will keep only a few days,\r\n            as the starch sours.\r\n\r\n        (2) Dry yeast.--The plants are put into a\r\n            starchy paste and the mixture is dried. This\r\n            form will keep for months, because it is\r\n            perfectly dry but, for the same reason, it\r\n            takes the plants a long time to become active\r\n            when used.\r\n\r\n        (3) Compressed yeast.--The plants are put into\r\n            cakes of a starchy mixture and left moist. They\r\n            will keep only a few days. Good compressed\r\n            yeast is a pale fawn colour, smells sweet,\r\n            breaks clean, and crumbles easily.\r\n\r\n4. Experiments with yeast:\r\n\r\nMake a _yeast garden_ by using the plants obtained at the grocery store\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\nTake half a cup of lukewarm water to give the plants moisture, a\r\nteaspoonful of sugar for immediate food, and the same of wheat starch\r\n(flour) for a reserve food. Beat the mixture to infold oxygen, and then\r\nput in one-quarter cake of yeast plants.\r\n\r\nDivide the mixture among a number of test-tubes, so that each group of\r\nfour pupils has three.\r\n\r\n        (1) Place one test-tube in warm water and heat\r\n            to boiling.\r\n\r\n        (2) Place one test-tube in water which feels\r\n            warm to the hand.\r\n\r\n        (3) Place one test-tube in cracked ice and\r\n            freeze the mixture. Afterwards thaw, and place\r\n            the same test-tube in lukewarm water.\r\n\r\nObserve the results, and compare the amount of gas formed under the\r\ndifferent conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON II\r\n\r\nPRACTICAL BREAD-MAKING\r\n\r\nIngredients of plain bread:\r\n\r\n  1. Liquid.--(1) It wets the mixture and causes the\r\n                  ingredients to adhere.\r\n\r\n              (2) It furnishes steam for a lightening\r\n                  agent.\r\n\r\n              (3) It allows the gluten to become sticky\r\n                  and elastic.\r\n\r\n              (4) It furnishes moisture for yeast plants.\r\n\r\n  2. Yeast.--It gives off carbonic acid gas, which lightens\r\n     the mixture.\r\n\r\n  3. Salt.--(1) It gives a flavour.\r\n\r\n            (2) It retards the growth of the yeast\r\n                plant.\r\n\r\n  4. Flour.--(1) It thickens the mixture.\r\n\r\n             (2) It supplies food for the yeast plant.\r\n\r\n             (3) It supplies gluten for a framework for\r\n                 the mixture.\r\n\r\nAmount of ingredients for one small loaf:\r\n\r\n    Liquid--1 cup or 1/2 pt.\r\n    Salt--1/2 tsp.\r\n    Flour--About three times the amount of liquid\r\n\r\nYeast--Amount depends on the time given the bread to rise, as follows:\r\n\r\n    12 hr. to rise      5 hr. to rise       3 hr. to rise\r\n    1/4 yeast cake      1/2 yeast cake      1 yeast cake\r\n\r\n        NOTE.--One cake of compressed yeast contains\r\n        about the same number of yeast plants as one\r\n        cake of dry yeast or one cup of liquid yeast.\r\n\r\nProcess in making bread:\r\n\r\n        (1) Mixing (stirring, beating, and kneading).--\r\n            (_a_) This mixes the ingredients. (_b_) It\r\n                  incorporates air to aid the yeast plant and to\r\n                  act as a lightening agent. (_c_) It makes the\r\n                  gluten elastic.\r\n\r\n        (2) First rising.--This allows the yeast plants\r\n            conditions and time to produce carbonic acid\r\n            gas, until the dough is distended to twice its\r\n            original size.\r\n\r\n        (3) Moulding.--(_a_) This distributes the gas\r\n            evenly throughout the loaf. (_b_) It shapes the\r\n            loaf.\r\n\r\n        (4) Second rising.--This again allows the yeast\r\n            plants time to produce gas which will distend\r\n            the dough to twice its size.\r\n\r\n        (5) Baking.--(_a_) The heat of the oven expands\r\n            the air and gas in the dough, which causes the\r\n            gluten framework to distend. (_b_) The water\r\n            changes to steam, which becomes another agent\r\n            in distending the gluten. (_c_) The starch on\r\n            the outside of the loaf becomes brown in the\r\n            dry heat of the oven, while the inside starch\r\n            is made soluble in the moist heat of the\r\n            mixture. (_d_) The gluten stiffens into the\r\n            distended shape. (_e_) The yeast plants are\r\n            killed.\r\n\r\nIn this lesson, after deciding on the necessary ingredients, the pupils\r\nmay be told the amount of each to use for their class work. They should\r\nthen measure and mix these ingredients and set the dough away for the\r\nfirst rising. While the bread is rising, the kitchen may be put in order\r\nand the other steps of the process reasoned out and written.\r\n\r\nOther school work must be taken then, until the dough has fully risen,\r\nwhen the process may be completed. After each stage of the process has\r\nbeen carried out, the notes on it may be written.\r\n\r\nWith the foregoing principles of bread-making in mind, the class should\r\nbe able to make any bread mixture. Each pupil should have entire\r\nresponsibility for the process of making one small loaf of plain bread.\r\nAbout half a cup of liquid, mixed with the other necessary ingredients,\r\nmakes a good-sized loaf for practice. Smaller loaves than this give\r\nlittle chance for manipulation.\r\n\r\nIn Household Management centres, where the pupils come from other\r\nschools for the lesson period only, the process will have to be divided\r\ninto two lessons. The first lesson may include the first two\r\nstages--mixing and first rising--each pupil using small quantities, say\r\nfor one eighth of a loaf of the ordinary size. At the end of the lesson,\r\nthey may carry their dough home for completion, or it may be used by\r\nanother class which is ready for the later steps of the process.\r\n\r\nThe second lesson will include the last three steps--moulding, second\r\nrising, and baking--and it will be necessary for the teacher to have\r\ndough prepared for the moulding stage when the class arrives.\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON III\r\n\r\nFANCY BREADS\r\n\r\nThese mixtures are but variations of plain bread. The extra ingredients,\r\nsuch as milk, eggs, butter, spices, sugar, currants, raisins, peel,\r\netc., are added at the most convenient stage of the process.\r\n\r\n        NOTE.--If there is not time to have one fancy\r\n        bread, such as Parker House rolls or currant\r\n        bread, made in school, recipes for these may be\r\n        discussed in class and the work done at home.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BREAD-MIXER\r\n\r\n1. This utensil mixes and beats the bread by means of a large beater\r\nturned with a handle, thus avoiding the use of the hands for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n2. It does this work with less energy and in a much shorter time than if\r\nthe hands were used.\r\n\r\n3. It can be used only for the first two steps of bread-making, namely,\r\n_mixing_ and _first rising_.\r\n\r\n4. The ingredients must all be put in at once; hence, they must be\r\naccurately measured.\r\n\r\n5. The amount of ingredients may be learned by calculation from previous\r\nbread-making done in the old way, or by using the book of recipes\r\naccompanying each mixer.\r\n\r\n        NOTE.--There are several good kinds of\r\n        bread-mixers which may be bought in three\r\n        sizes. Small size makes 1 to 2 loaves and costs\r\n        $1.35 (about). Medium size makes 2 to 6 loaves\r\n        and costs $2.00 (about). Large size makes 4 to\r\n        10 loaves and costs $2.50 (about).\r\n\r\n\r\nPASTRY\r\n\r\nPastry is one of the simplest flour mixtures, and one that has the\r\nlowest food value. The intimate blending of butter or lard with the\r\nflour envelopes the starch grains with fat, and makes the mixture\r\ndifficult to digest. The same thing occurs in frying food and in\r\nbuttering hot toast; so the idea is not a new one to the class.\r\n\r\nIn introducing the lesson on pastry, this principle of digestion should\r\nbe reviewed, and it should be made plain that delicate pudding and\r\nseasonable fruits are a much better form of dessert.\r\n\r\nThere are no new principles to teach, but some old ones to impress. The\r\nobject of the housekeeper should be to make a mixture that is light and\r\none that will fall to pieces easily. To ensure the latter, anything that\r\nwould toughen the gluten must be avoided.\r\n\r\nFrom the bread lesson, the pupils have learned that working the water\r\ninto the gluten or much handling of flour after it is wet, makes a\r\nmixture firm and tough. In pastry there must be enough gluten to stick\r\nthe ingredients together, but its elastic quality is undesirable. For\r\nthe latter reason also, a small amount of water is used.\r\n\r\nIn the cake mixtures, it was found that the use of fat in the "butter\r\ncakes" made the framework tender and easily broken, so in pastry the\r\nsame means may be employed. Fat of some kind is mixed with the flour to\r\nact on the gluten and destroy its toughness.\r\n\r\nAir and steam are the only lightening agents commonly used in pastry.\r\nSince cold air occupies less room than warm air and admits of more\r\nexpansion, it is desirable that the mixture be kept very cold. The low\r\ntemperature also prevents the fat melting; hence, the necessity for the\r\nuse of cold utensils and materials throughout the process.\r\n\r\n\r\nOUTLINE OF LESSON ON PASTRY\r\n\r\n1. Ingredients:\r\n\r\n        (1) Flour, (2) salt, (3) fat, (4) water.\r\n\r\n2. Notes on flour:\r\n\r\n        (1) Use only pastry flour, which will have a\r\n            small amount of gluten.\r\n\r\n        (2) After the flour is wet, handle the mixture\r\n            as little as possible, to avoid working the\r\n            water into the gluten and making it tough.\r\n\r\n3. Notes on fat:\r\n\r\n        (1) Fat is used to destroy the elasticity of\r\n            the gluten, so that it will not be tough when\r\n            cooked.\r\n\r\n        (2) Butter, lard, or dripping may be used.\r\n\r\n        (3) Lard makes more tender pastry than butter.\r\n\r\n        (4) Butter gives the best flavour.\r\n\r\n        (5) Half butter and half lard makes a good\r\n            mixture.\r\n\r\n        (6) Layers of fat may be put in between layers\r\n            of pastry, to separate it into flakes.\r\n\r\n        (7) If two fats are used, the softer is cut\r\n            into the flour, and the harder one laid on the\r\n            paste and folded in.\r\n\r\n4. Notes on water:\r\n\r\n        (1) Use the water as cold as possible.\r\n\r\n        (2) Use the least amount of water necessary to\r\n            make the ingredients adhere.\r\n\r\n5. Lightening agents used in pastry:\r\n\r\n        (1) Air.--(_a_) This should be as cold as\r\n        possible. (_b_) The air may he folded in,\r\n        between layers of pastry.\r\n\r\n        (2) Steam.\r\n\r\n6. Kinds of pastry:\r\n\r\n        (1) Plain pastry.--In this, one quarter to one\r\n            third as much fat as flour is used, and it is\r\n            all "cut in".\r\n\r\n        (2) Flaky pastry.--In this, the same amount of\r\n            fat is used as in plain pastry, but half of it\r\n            is "laid on" and folded in.\r\n\r\n        (3) Puff pastry.--In this, one half as much fat\r\n            as flour, up to equal parts of each is used;\r\n            one quarter of the fat is cut in, and the\r\n            remainder is laid on and folded in.\r\n\r\n7. Amount of ingredients for plain pastry for one pie:\r\n\r\n        1 1/2 cup pastry flour; 1/4 tsp. salt; 1/2 cup\r\n        fat (lard and butter); ice water.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nFORM IV: SENIOR GRADE (Continued)\r\n\r\nMEAT\r\n\r\n\r\nAs meat is rather a complex food the teaching of which involves a good\r\nmany lessons, and as it does not lend itself as well as other foods to\r\nthe making of dishes useful in practice work, it seems wise to defer the\r\nstudy of it until the Senior Form is reached; the ability and home needs\r\nof the pupils should decide this. The season of the year should also be\r\nconsidered. It is wiser to take meat lessons in cold weather because it\r\nis then more pleasant to handle and easier to keep. The latter\r\nconsideration is important in some rural districts, where shops are not\r\nconvenient.\r\n\r\nMore preparation is needed for the first meat lesson than for most\r\nfoods. Some days before, thin bones such as leg or wing bones of fowl,\r\nor rib bones of lamb should be soaked in diluted hydrochloric or nitric\r\nacid (one part acid to ten of water), to dissolve the mineral substance\r\nwhich gives the bone its rigidity.\r\n\r\nAny time before the lesson, a large solid bone of an old animal, such as\r\na knee or hip joint of beef, should be burned for hours to get rid of\r\nthe connective tissue which holds the mineral substance in shape. This\r\nshould be carefully done, in order to retain the shape of the bone and\r\nto show the porous formation of the mineral substance. If the bone is\r\nnot blackened by the fire, its white colour will also indicate the lime\r\nof which it is formed.\r\n\r\nOn the day of the lesson it will be necessary to have a piece of meat\r\nshowing the three parts--fat, bone, and muscle. A lower cut of the round\r\nof beef has all these parts, and the muscle is sufficiently tough to\r\nshow its connective tissue plainly. For the study of fat, a piece of\r\nsuet is best, as it can be easily picked apart to show its formation.\r\n\r\nIn examining fat meat and lean meat it is essential that, at least,\r\nevery two pupils have a piece, as close scrutiny is necessary. One or\r\ntwo samples of bone will suffice for the class.\r\n\r\nNo definite amount of work can be laid down for any one lesson. The\r\ninterest and ability of the class must be the guide. In rural schools,\r\nthe time of each lesson must be comparatively short, though no Household\r\nManagement teacher should spend more than forty minutes on purely\r\ntheoretical work without a change of some kind.\r\n\r\nThe following is an outline of the facts to be considered in this\r\nparticular study:\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON I\r\n\r\n1. Names of meat:\r\n\r\n        (1) Beef, from the ox or cow. The best meat\r\n            comes from an animal about four years old.\r\n\r\n        (2) Veal, from the calf. It should be at least\r\n            six weeks old.\r\n\r\n        (3) Mutton, from the sheep. Spring lamb is from\r\n            six to eight weeks old; yearling is one year\r\n            old.\r\n\r\n        (4) Pork, from the pig.\r\n\r\n        (5) Fowl, poultry--chicken, turkey, duck,\r\n            goose.\r\n\r\n        (6) Game, wild animals--deer, wild duck,\r\n            partridge, etc.\r\n\r\n2. Parts of meat:\r\n\r\n        (1) Fat.--(_a_) Inside fat, around the internal\r\n            organs, usually called kidney fat, or suet.\r\n            (_b_) Outside fat, next the skin, called caul\r\n                  fat.\r\n\r\n        (2) Bone, (3) muscle, or lean meat.\r\n\r\n3. Composition of fat:\r\n\r\n        (1) Connective tissue, (2) true fat, (3) water.\r\n\r\nFat should be the first part studied, because it is the simplest tissue\r\nand the parts are most plainly seen. Pick the specimen apart, and the\r\ntissue that holds it together is found. Its name is easily developed\r\nfrom its use.\r\n\r\nThe water may be shown by heating pieces of fat in a small saucepan and,\r\nwhen it becomes hot, covering the dish with a cold plate. Remove the\r\nplate before it gets heated, and moisture will be condensed on its\r\nsurface. The presence of water in fat may also be reasoned out by\r\nremembering that water enters into the composition of all body tissues.\r\n\r\n4. Composition of bone:\r\n\r\n        (1) Mineral matter (lime), (2) connective\r\n        tissue, (3) water.\r\n\r\nNeither the mineral substance nor the connective tissue in bone can be\r\nseen until either one or the other is eliminated.\r\n\r\nStrike the fresh bone with a steel knife, and it shows the quality of\r\nhardness. Bones are built from food, and the only food substance that is\r\nso hard is mineral matter. Show the burned bone, with only the mineral\r\nmatter left, and let each pupil examine it. Its formation indicates the\r\nspaces which the part burned out of it occupied. Let it fall or crush\r\npart of it in the fingers, to show how easily it is broken. Such bones\r\nwould be no use as a framework to support the body. The bones of very\r\nold persons get too much like this, and we are afraid to have such\r\npeople fall. The burned bone needs something to hold it together--a\r\nconnective tissue. Such a tissue was in the spaces before the bone was\r\nburned.\r\n\r\nShow the bone after it has been prepared in an acid solution, with only\r\nthe connective tissue left. Explain how it was prepared. Bend it to show\r\nits pliability. To be of use in the body it needs some substance to make\r\nit hard and rigid--the mineral matter which was dissolved out.\r\n\r\n        NOTE.--This is an excellent time to show the\r\n        necessity for bone-building mineral in the diet\r\n        of babies and young children. If they do not\r\n        get this mineral substance during the growth\r\n        period, they cannot have hard, rigid bones, and\r\n        their bodies are apt to become misshapen--bow\r\n        legs, curved spines, etc. This substance is\r\n        also necessary for hard, sound teeth.\r\n\r\nDraw attention to the fact that the mineral matter in milk and eggs is\r\nin solution, and therefore ready to be used by the body. Mineral matter\r\nis not in solution in bone, and cannot be dissolved by the digestive\r\nprocess, therefore it is practically of no use as food.\r\n\r\nCompare the connective tissue of bone with that of fat, and let the\r\npupils account for the difference in thickness. Lead them to see that\r\nconnective tissue can be dissolved in hot water, and in this way may be\r\nextracted from the mineral part of bone. The housekeeper may do this\r\nherself, or she may buy it already extracted, as gelatine.\r\n\r\n5. Composition of muscle:\r\n\r\n        (1) Connective tissue\r\n\r\n        (2) Red part, made up of microscopic tubes\r\n            holding a red juice. The juice contains: (_a_)\r\n            Water (_b_) Red colour (_c_) Flavour (_d_)\r\n            Muscle albumen--a protein substance similar to\r\n            egg-white (_e_) Mineral matter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Muscle fibres highly magnified\r\n\r\nBundle of fibres. Tubes of one fibre. Proper carving of fibres--across\r\nthe grain.]\r\n\r\nIt should be made clear that the walls of such tiny tubes can never be\r\nthick enough to be tough. Attention should be called to the real cause\r\nof toughness--the thick connective tissue.\r\n\r\n        NOTE.--Very small pieces of meat will serve for\r\n        specimens. Tough meat is better, because it\r\n        shows the connective tissue more plainly. When\r\n        the muscle is being examined, it should be\r\n        carefully scraped with a knife, until a layer\r\n        of connective tissue is laid bare. The red part\r\n        that is scraped off should be explained, and a\r\n        drawing should be made to illustrate it.\r\n\r\nMinced lean beef should he soaked in a little cold water for at least\r\ntwenty minutes, to extract the muscle juice for examination. The juice\r\nshould be strained through a cheesecloth and poured into a glass. It\r\nshows nothing but water and a red colour.\r\n\r\nIn order to find the other substances, pour part of the juice into a\r\nsmall saucepan and heat it gradually until it boils gently. The red\r\ncolour will disappear, and the albumen which is dissolved in the juice\r\nwill coagulate and become plainly visible. The pupils will recall that\r\negg-white was affected in the same way by heat, and may be told that\r\nthis coagulated substance is similar to egg-white, and is called muscle\r\nalbumen. The odour given off by heating suggests that the flavour is\r\nalso in the muscle juice, hence the importance of conserving this juice\r\nin the cooking process.\r\n\r\nStrain the boiled juice to get rid of the coagulated albumen and then\r\nexamine the liquid that is left. Its colour plainly denotes mineral\r\nmatter in solution.\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON II\r\n\r\n6. Meat experiments:\r\n\r\nIf time permit, the following experiments may be taken. The facts which\r\nthese experiments prove may, however, be developed in a much shorter\r\ntime by questioning:\r\n\r\n        (1) Cut lean meat into small pieces, cover them\r\n            with cold water and let them stand. Note the\r\n            colour of the water.\r\n\r\n        (2) Cover a piece of lean meat with boiling\r\n            water and let it stand. Note the colour of the\r\n            water.\r\n\r\n        (3) Sprinkle a piece of meat with salt. What\r\n            happens?\r\n\r\n        (4) Wrap a piece of meat for a few minutes in\r\n            ordinary brown wrapping-paper. What happens?\r\n\r\n        (5) Simmer a small piece of very tough meat for\r\n            about an hour and then examine the connective\r\n            tissue.\r\n\r\n        (6) Boil or bake a small piece of very tough\r\n            meat and then examine the connective tissue.\r\n\r\n7. Selection of meat:\r\n\r\n        (1) All flesh should be uniform in colour, of a\r\n            fine grain, and firm and springy to the touch.\r\n\r\n        (2) Beef should be bright red in colour, well\r\n            mottled, and surrounded with fat.\r\n\r\n        (3) Mutton should be a dull red, and its fat\r\n            white, hard, and flaky.\r\n\r\n        (4) Lamb is lighter in colour than mutton, and\r\n            the bone is redder.\r\n\r\n        (5) Veal has pinkish-coloured flesh and white\r\n            fat. Very pale veal is not good.\r\n\r\n        (6) Pork should have firm flesh of a pale red\r\n            colour. The skin should be white and clear, the\r\n            fat white.\r\n\r\n        (7) Poultry: (_a_) Chickens.--Young chickens\r\n            have thin, sharp nails; smooth legs; soft, thin\r\n            skin; and soft cartilage at the end of the\r\n            breastbone. Long hairs denote age. (_b_)\r\n            Turkeys.--These should be plump, have smooth,\r\n            dark legs, and soft cartilage. (_c_)\r\n            Geese.--These should be plump and have many pin\r\n            feathers; they should also have pliable bills\r\n            and soft feet.\r\n\r\n8. Care of meat:\r\n\r\n        (1) Remove the meat from the wrapping paper as\r\n            soon as it arrives, to prevent the loss of\r\n            juices. The butcher should use waxed paper next\r\n            to the meat.\r\n\r\n        (2) Wipe the meat all over with a damp cloth,\r\n            but do not put it into water.\r\n\r\n        (3) Place the meat on an earthen or enamel\r\n            dish, and set it in a cool place until\r\n            required.\r\n\r\n        (4) Frozen meat should be thawed in a warm room\r\n            before being cooked.\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON III\r\n\r\n9. General ways of preparing meat:\r\n\r\n        (1) Extracting certain substances.--(_a_)\r\n            Soup--substances extracted in water from lean\r\n            meat, bone, and fat. (_b_) Beef-tea--substances\r\n            extracted in water from lean meat. (_c_)\r\n            Bouillon--substances extracted in water from\r\n            lean meat and flavoured with vegetable. (_d_)\r\n            Beef juice--juices extracted from lean meat by\r\n            heat only, or by pressure.\r\n\r\n        (2) Retaining all substances.--Roasts, boiling\r\n            pieces, steaks, chops, cutlets.\r\n\r\n        (3) Retaining part and extracting part.--Stews.\r\n\r\n10. Notes on tough meat:\r\n\r\n        (1) The toughness of meat depends on the\r\n            thickness of the connective tissue holding the\r\n            muscle tubes together.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cuts of beef\r\n\r\n1.

Digestibility of meat:\r\n\r\n        (1) The less muscle juice is coagulated by\r\n            heat, the more easily it is digested.\r\n\r\n        (2) Because of their close texture, the liver,\r\n            kidney, and heart of animals are more difficult\r\n            to digest.\r\n\r\n        (3) Mutton and lamb, because of their shorter\r\n            fibres, are more easily digested than beef.\r\n\r\n        (4) Veal is difficult to digest, owing to its\r\n            stringy fibres.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cuts of veal]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cuts of lamb]\r\n\r\n        (5) Pork has a large amount of fat intermingled\r\n            with its fibres, and is, therefore, difficult\r\n            to digest.\r\n\r\n        (6) Chicken and turkey are easily digested, but\r\n            goose and duck are indigestible, because of the\r\n            fat through the muscle fibres.\r\n\r\n        (7) Game is easy of digestion.\r\n\r\nThe practical work, besides the experiments, in connection with the meat\r\nlessons, should consist of at least three preparations of this food: (1)\r\nthe cooking of tender meat, (2) the cooking of tough meat, (3) the\r\nmaking of soup.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cuts of pork]\r\n\r\nThe object of each preparation should be made plain, so that the pupils\r\nmay fully understand what they are trying to accomplish.\r\n\r\n1. Object in cooking tender meat:\r\n\r\n        (1) To change the flavour and appearance.\r\n\r\n        (2) To seal the tubes to keep in the juices.\r\n\r\n        (3) To cook the meat without densely\r\n            coagulating the protein of the muscle juice, so\r\n            as to keep it digestible.\r\n\r\n2. Object in cooking tough meat:\r\n\r\n        (1) To change the flavour and appearance.\r\n\r\n        (2) To soften and partially dissolve the\r\n            connective tissue, making it easy to cut.\r\n\r\n        (3) To avoid making the muscle juice\r\n            indigestible.\r\n\r\n3. Object in making soup:\r\n\r\n        (1) To extract the connective tissue from the\r\n            bone.\r\n\r\n        (2) To extract the muscle juice from the tubes.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL RULES FOR COOKING MEAT\r\n\r\n1. Baking:\r\n\r\n        Place the meat in a very hot oven with pieces\r\n        of the fat or some dripping in the pan. Baste\r\n        every ten minutes. Keep the oven very hot for a\r\n        small roast. For a large roast, check the fire\r\n        after the first fifteen minutes. Bake fifteen\r\n        minutes to each pound.\r\n\r\n2. Broiling:\r\n\r\n        (1) Over the coals.--Put the meat between the\r\n            hot greased wires of a broiler. Place over a\r\n            very hot, clear fire. Turn the broiler every\r\n            ten seconds. Beef one inch thick cooks rare in\r\n            eight minutes.\r\n\r\n        (2) Pan Broiling.--Heat a frying-pan smoking\r\n            hot. Lay the meat in flat; turn constantly\r\n            until seared, then frequently, as in broiling,\r\n            but do not pierce the muscle part with a fork.\r\n            Beef one inch thick cooks rare in ten minutes.\r\n\r\n3. Boiling:\r\n\r\n        Cover the meat with boiling water. Boil five\r\n        minutes. Then simmer until done. Tender meat\r\n        takes twenty minutes to the pound; tough meat\r\n        takes from three to five hours.\r\n\r\n4. Stewing:\r\n\r\n        Cut the meat in pieces of a suitable size.\r\n        Cover with cold water. Bring gradually to the\r\n        simmering point and simmer until tender,\r\n        usually three or four hours. Keep the pot\r\n        closely covered.\r\n\r\n5. Beef juice:\r\n        Take one pound of steak from the top of the round. Wipe the\r\n        steak, remove all fat, and cut the lean meat in small pieces.\r\n        Place in canning jar, and cover; place on a rest in the kettle\r\n        and surround with cold water. Allow the water to heat slowly,\r\n        care being taken not to have it reach a higher temperature than\r\n        130 degrees. Let stand two hours; strain and press the meat to\r\n        obtain all the juices. Salt to taste.\r\n\r\n        NOTE.--These rules may be dictated to the\r\n        class, as all of the principles which they\r\n        involve have been previously discussed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFISH\r\n\r\nSince fish is the flesh of sea animals, there will be little new to\r\nlearn concerning it.\r\n\r\nMain points of difference between this flesh and ordinary meat are:\r\n\r\n1. Fish is less stimulating and nourishing than meat, as it contains\r\nmore water and less protein than an equal quantity of lean meat.\r\n\r\n2. Oysters, and the class called white-fish, are more easily digested\r\nthan meat, hence they should be chosen for invalids or those having weak\r\ndigestions.\r\n\r\nKinds of fish:\r\n\r\n1. White-fish.--The fat is stored mostly in the liver, making the flesh\r\neasy to digest. Examples: cod, halibut, haddock, white-fish.\r\n\r\n2. Oily fish.--The fat is distributed throughout the flesh, making it\r\nmore difficult to digest. Examples: salmon, herring, mackerel.\r\n\r\n3. Shell-fish.--Because of their close fibres, these are difficult to\r\ndigest, with the exception of oysters. Examples: clams, scallops, and\r\noysters.\r\n\r\n4. Crustaceous.--The flesh is tough and hard to digest. Examples:\r\nlobsters, crabs.\r\n\r\nSelection of fish:\r\n\r\nFresh fish may be recognized by the following:\r\n\r\n        1. The eyes should be full and bright.\r\n\r\n        2. The flesh should be firm and elastic.\r\n\r\n        3. The gills should be bright red.\r\n\r\n        4. There should be no unpleasant odour.\r\n\r\nCooking of fish:\r\n\r\nFish may be cooked in any way similar to meat. As the flesh of fish\r\ncontains food substances which are very easily dissolved in water,\r\nboiling is not a good method of cooking to choose for this food.\r\nSteaming, baking, and frying are more suitable.\r\n\r\n\r\nGELATINE\r\n\r\nA lesson on gelatine naturally follows the lessons on meat and fish. The\r\nstudy of bone and the making of soup have explained the source of this\r\nsubstance, and only a few additional facts are necessary.\r\n\r\nThe gelatine practice dishes are sure to prove attractive to the class,\r\nand the common use of this food in sickness, and in salads and desserts,\r\nmakes it important that its food value be understood.\r\n\r\n1. Source of gelatine:\r\n\r\nGelatine is obtained from the bones, cartilage, and skin of animals. It\r\nis the connective tissue dissolved out of these parts.\r\n\r\nThe housekeeper may obtain it for herself or she may buy it already\r\nextracted; both are equally good.\r\n\r\n2. Commercial forms:\r\n\r\n        (1) Sheet gelatine\r\n\r\n        (2) Shredded gelatine\r\n\r\n        (3) Granulated gelatine.\r\n\r\n3. Properties of gelatine:\r\n\r\n        (1) It softens in cold water, but will not\r\n            dissolve.\r\n\r\n        (2) It dissolves in hot water.\r\n\r\n        (3) It jellies when cold, if the solution be\r\n            sufficiently strong.\r\n\r\n        (4) Good gelatine has little taste, colour, or\r\n            odour, and no sediment when dissolved.\r\n\r\n4. Steps in dissolving gelatine:\r\n\r\n        (1) Put a small amount of cold water or any\r\n            cold liquid on gelatine, and let it stand until\r\n            the liquid is absorbed.\r\n\r\n        (2) Add a boiling liquid and stir thoroughly\r\n            until dissolved.\r\n\r\n5. Value in the diet:\r\n\r\n        (1) Gelatine is a nitrogenous substance, but\r\n            cannot of itself build tissues, as most protein\r\n            foods do. When eaten, it will save the tissues\r\n            already making up the body, hence is called a\r\n            _protein-sparer_.\r\n\r\n        (2) It is very easily digested, and for this\r\n            reason it gives a pleasant variety to the diet\r\n            of an invalid.\r\n\r\n        (3) It makes an attractive dessert at the end\r\n            of a substantial meal, without adding much\r\n            nutriment.\r\n\r\n6. Ways of using gelatine:\r\n\r\n        (1) It may assist in making soup.\r\n\r\n        (2) Any liquid may be used to dissolve this\r\n            substance to make a plain jelly. Examples:\r\n            coffee jelly, tomato jelly, wine jelly.\r\n\r\n        (3) Plain jelly may be varied as follows:\r\n\r\n            Allow the plain jelly mixture to cool until it\r\n            is as thick as cream, and then beat in whipped\r\n            egg-white, or fruit, or chopped vegetables, and\r\n            set away until firm. Examples: snow pudding,\r\n            orange charlotte, vegetable salad.\r\n\r\n        (4) Strain off the juice from a can of fruit,\r\n            heat it, and use it for dissolving the\r\n            gelatine. When almost set, add the fruit, and\r\n            set away to become firm.\r\n\r\n\r\nFROZEN DISHES\r\n\r\nA lesson on frozen dishes may be taken at any time, but it seems\r\nspecially opportune after the gelatine lesson. It may be impossible to\r\nmake these dishes in school, but the facts of the lesson may be\r\ndiscussed and recipes furnished, after which a Form IV pupil should find\r\nno difficulty in carrying out these recipes at home.\r\n\r\nElementary science should be correlated, to explain the use of salt in\r\nthe freezing process.\r\n\r\n\r\nVALUE OF FROZEN DISHES\r\n\r\n1. They are cooling, refreshing, and nourishing when properly taken;\r\nthey are not good as a final course at a meal, as cold mixtures reduce\r\nthe temperature of the stomach and thus retard digestion.\r\n\r\n2. They are appetizing in appearance and flavour.\r\n\r\n3. They are economical as regards cost of ingredients, fuel, time, and\r\nenergy.\r\n\r\n\r\nKINDS OF FROZEN DISHES\r\n\r\n1. Water ice.--Fruit juice diluted with water, sweetened and frozen;\r\nstirred about every five minutes while freezing.\r\n\r\n2. Frapp\xc3\xa9.--Water ice frozen to the consistency of mush; in freezing,\r\nequal parts of ice and salt are used to make the mixture granular.\r\n\r\n3. Sherbet.--Water ice to which is added a small quantity of dissolved\r\ngelatine or beaten egg-white; stirred constantly while freezing.\r\n\r\n4. Ice cream.--Thin cream, sweetened, flavoured, and frozen; stirred\r\nconstantly while freezing.\r\n\r\n5. Plain ice cream.--Same as ice cream with custard added.\r\n\r\n6. Mousse.--Thick cream, beaten until stiff, sweetened, flavoured,\r\nplaced in a mould, packed in ice and salt (two parts ice to one part\r\nsalt), and allowed to stand three hours. A small quantity of dissolved\r\ngelatine may be added to the mixture.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRACTICAL WORK\r\n\r\n1. Freezing:\r\n\r\n        (1) Scald the can and dasher and cool just\r\n            before using.\r\n\r\n        (2) See that all parts of the freezer are\r\n            properly adjusted.\r\n\r\n        (3) Empty the mixture into the can; never fill\r\n            the can more than three-quarters full, to allow\r\n            for expansion when freezing.\r\n\r\n        (4) Prepare ice by chipping finely or by\r\n            crushing in a canvas bag by means of a mallet.\r\n\r\n        (5) Allow three measures of ice to one of\r\n            coarse rock salt and pack this mixture solidly\r\n            around the can.\r\n\r\n        (6) Turn the crank slowly and steadily until\r\n            the mixture begins to freeze, then turn more\r\n            rapidly until frozen.\r\n\r\n        (7) Add more ice and salt as needed, but do not\r\n            draw off the salt water except to keep it from\r\n            getting inside the can.\r\n\r\n2. Packing:\r\n\r\n        (1) When the mixture is frozen, draw off the\r\n            water, remove the dasher, and pack the contents\r\n            of the can down solidly with a spoon.\r\n\r\n        (2) Replace the cover, using a cork for the\r\n            opening, then repack in ice and salt (four\r\n            parts ice to one part salt).\r\n\r\n        (3) Cover with newspapers, blanket, or carpet,\r\n            and let it stand for at least one hour before\r\n            serving.\r\n\r\n2. Moulding:\r\n\r\n        (1) Wet the mould and pack the frozen mixture\r\n            in solidly.\r\n\r\n        (2) Place the cover on the mould and bind\r\n            strips of greased cotton or waxed paper around\r\n            all the crevices.\r\n\r\n        (3) Imbed the mould in ice and salt (four parts\r\n            ice to one part salt).\r\n\r\n        (4) Wrap a cloth wrung from hot water around\r\n            the mould for an instant, before removing the\r\n            mixture.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLANNING AND PREPARATION OF MEALS\r\n\r\nThe food work of the previous Forms, from constant reference and use,\r\nshould be so well known that it may be reviewed in one lesson, under the\r\nfollowing heads:\r\n\r\n1. Uses of food\r\n\r\n2. Necessary substances in food\r\n\r\n3. Composition of the common foods--milk, eggs, meat, vegetables, fruit,\r\nseeds\r\n\r\n4. General sources of each food substance.\r\n\r\nAfter the review, the class may be asked to prepare menus for one day\'s\r\nmeals, keeping in mind the following:\r\n\r\n1. Daily balance of food substances\r\n\r\n2. Appetizing appearance and flavour of the food\r\n\r\n3. Economy of time, labour, and money in providing the food.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of menus may be continued, even while other work is\r\nbeing studied, until the teacher feels satisfied with the ability of the\r\nclass to prepare menus intelligently.\r\n\r\nThe planning of menus should, if time permit, be extended to actual\r\npractice in preparing and serving the meals called for by some of the\r\nmenus. In this Form there should be a limit set to the number of people\r\nserved and the cost of the food.\r\n\r\nSince breakfast and luncheon were prepared in the Junior Form, a dinner\r\nshould be taken in this. The entire responsibility of the meal should be\r\ngiven to the pupils, each being appointed to perform definite duties.\r\nThe teacher may advise while the class is planning the work, but not\r\nassist while it is being carried out.\r\n\r\nEach member of the class may be asked to prepare a menu to suit the\r\nspecial conditions which have been made as to number and cost. These may\r\nbe planned at home and brought to the teacher for criticism. At the\r\nfirst lesson, three or four of the best may be written on the\r\nblack-hoard for comparison and choice.\r\n\r\nWhen the selection is made, members of the class should be chosen for\r\nthe following duties: (1) marketing, (2) preparation of food, (3) laying\r\nthe table, (4) serving, (5) representing members of the family to eat\r\nthe meal.\r\n\r\n        NOTE.--To prevent any suspicion of favouritism,\r\n        the duties may be written on slips of paper and\r\n        the pupils allowed to draw these.\r\n\r\nAt the second lesson the meal will be prepared, served, and eaten. In\r\nschools lacking an equipment, the meal may be planned and selected in\r\nthe same way as above, but the entire responsibility of carrying it out\r\nmust rest on one pupil, as it will be necessary for each to prepare and\r\nserve it in her own home.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nFORM IV: SENIOR GRADE (Continued)\r\n\r\nINFANT FEEDING\r\n\r\n\r\nThis subject is more suitable for older students than for those\r\nattending the public and separate schools, but, because of its\r\nimportance and the fact that many girls never go beyond the Entrance\r\nclass, it is deemed wise to present, to the pupils of Form IV, the main\r\nfacts relating to the feeding of infants. Each teacher must however use\r\nher judgment in the choice of these facts for her class and in the\r\nmethod of presenting them. The instruction given may include the\r\nfollowing ideas:\r\n\r\nThe natural food of an infant is its mother\'s milk, and too much stress\r\ncannot be placed on the necessity of nursing by the mother.\r\n\r\nEven if the mother has but a small supply, the baby should not be\r\nweaned; the supply should be supplemented by modified milk. In the rare\r\ncases where a mother cannot nurse her baby, a physician should prescribe\r\nthe food. In such a case the best substitute is cow\'s milk.\r\n\r\nIf cow\'s milk be used, it will have to be changed or "modified" to make\r\nit as far as possible like mother\'s milk. Cow\'s milk differs in the\r\nfollowing respects: It has (1) less water and therefore more solids; (2)\r\na larger proportion of protein and mineral compounds; (3) less sugar;\r\n(4) a different combination of fats.\r\n\r\nCow\'s milk cannot be made like mother\'s milk, but it is better food for\r\na little baby if cream, milk sugar, and barley water, are added in\r\ncertain proportions, varying according to the age of the child.\r\n\r\n\r\nRECIPE FOR MODIFIED MILK\r\n\r\nMilk 7 ounces\r\n\r\nMilk sugar 1/2 ounce\r\n\r\nCream (18%) 1 ounce, if ordinary milk be used or 1/2 ounce if Jersey\r\nmilk be used.\r\n\r\nBarley water Dilute with barley water to make 20 ounces for the first\r\ntwo or three weeks, then reduce to 16 ounces up to about three months of\r\nage. The volume may then be reduced to 14 ounces, and at five or six\r\nmonths to 12 ounces.\r\n\r\nMixed milk, and not one cow\'s milk, should be used, for the reason that\r\na better average of milk is secured from several cows than from one. The\r\nsupply should be fresh and clean. To make sure of the latter, scrupulous\r\ncare should be given to the cleanliness of the cows\' bodies and stables,\r\nthe utensils, and the clothing and hands of the milkers. If there is any\r\ndoubt of the cleanliness, the milk should be pasteurized. The\r\npasteurization greatly reduces the bacterial life in the milk by a\r\ntemperature which does not change its composition and digestibility, as\r\nis the case in sterilizing it.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS FOR PASTEURIZING MILK\r\n\r\nSterilize bottles as for canning. Nearly fill the bottles with milk and\r\ncork them with absorbent cotton which has been sterilized (by being\r\nbaked a delicate brown). Place the bottles on a rest in a deep kettle\r\nand surround them with cold water as high as the milk. Heat the water\r\ngradually to 155 degrees Fahrenheit, or until tiny bubbles show in the\r\nmilk next the glass. Remove the kettle and contents to where the\r\ntemperature of the milk will remain the same for half an hour. Then\r\ncool the milk quickly by putting the bottles first in lukewarm water and\r\nthen in cold water. Keep in a cool place and do not remove the cotton\r\nuntil ready to use. Pasteurized milk should not be kept more than a\r\ncouple of days.\r\n\r\nThe utmost care and cleanliness should be observed in preparing the\r\ninfant\'s food. All utensils which come in contact with the food should\r\nbe sterilized each time they are used. Bottles with rubber tubes should\r\n_never_ be used, as they cannot be thoroughly cleaned. The bottle should\r\nbe plain and graduated without a neck, and the nipple should admit of\r\nbeing turned inside out.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARE OF BOTTLES\r\n\r\nAfter the nursing, the bottles should at once be rinsed with cold water.\r\nLater, the bottles and nipples should be carefully washed in hot, soapy\r\nwater, then rinsed in clear, hot water. They should then be sterilized\r\nby boiling in water for twenty minutes, after which they may be placed\r\nin boric acid solution (1 tsp. to 1 qt. water), or the bottles may be\r\nemptied and plugged with sterilized absorbent cotton until again\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARE OF FOOD\r\n\r\nIt saves much time to make sufficient food to last for twenty-four\r\nhours. This may be put into a large bottle, or what is better, into the\r\nseveral nursing bottles, and each plugged with sterilized absorbent\r\ncotton. After cooling, the bottles should be put on the ice or in some\r\ncool place until required. Where there is no refrigerator, an ice-box\r\nmade on the principle of the home-made fireless cooker will do\r\nexcellent service. When the food is to be used, it should be warmed\r\nslightly above body heat by placing the bottle in warm water.\r\n\r\nThe following table is taken from _The Care and Feeding of Children_ by\r\nL.

Description of bacteria\r\n\r\n        2. Occurrence of bacteria\r\n\r\n        3. Favourable conditions for bacteria\r\n\r\n        4. Multiplication of bacteria\r\n\r\n        5. Useful bacteria\r\n\r\n        6. Harmful bacteria.\r\n\r\nIt is with the harmful bacteria that our lesson on sanitation deals. The\r\npupils already know that some kinds belonging to this class cause the\r\ndecay of food, and now they are ready to be told that other harmful\r\nkinds of microscopic plants gain entrance to our bodies and cause\r\ndisease. Concerning these, the following outline of facts should be\r\ntaken:\r\n\r\n1. MEANS OF BACTERIA ENTERING THE BODY\r\n\r\n        (1) Through the respiratory organs\r\n\r\n        (2) Through the digestive tract\r\n\r\n        (3) Through the broken skin.\r\n\r\n2. COMMON DISEASE-PRODUCING BACTERIA\r\n\r\n        (1) Those entering the respiratory\r\n            organs.--Mumps, scarlet fever, whooping-cough,\r\n            diphtheria, measles, pneumonia\r\n\r\n        (2) Those entering the digestive\r\n            tract.--Typhoid, cholera, tuberculosis\r\n\r\n        (3) Those coming through cuts, etc.--Skin\r\n            diseases like ringworm, blood poisoning,\r\n            lockjaw (tetanus).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sink and sewer connection T--Trap. W--Waste Pipe.\r\nH.D.--House drain. S.--Sewer.]\r\n\r\nIf housekeepers do not exercise care, these disease-producing bacteria\r\nmay enter the home, and finding there all the conditions which they\r\nrequire, they will multiply, and become a menace to the family.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. METHODS OF SANITATION\r\n\r\nSince bacteria are too small to be seen, it is very hard to deal with\r\nthem. The housekeeper has the following ways of protecting the\r\nhousehold:\r\n\r\n        (1) By having all drain pipes trapped:\r\n\r\n        (2) By keeping the house free from lodging\r\n            places for bacteria:\r\n            (_a_) Keep the house clean and free of dust.\r\n            (_b_) Wash garbage pails and sinks daily and\r\n                  scald them and drain pipes at least once a\r\n                  week.\r\n            (_c_) Keep the refrigerators, cupboards, and\r\n                  receptacles for food clean, and allow no\r\n                  spoiled food to remain in them.\r\n            (_d_) Wash and sterilize the soiled clothing\r\n                  once a week.\r\n            (_e_) Keep the cellar well aired and clean;\r\n                  allow no decaying material to remain in it.\r\n            (_f_) Keep the door-yards clean; allow no\r\n                  scraps of food, cleaning water, or sweepings to\r\n                  be thrown near the house.\r\n\r\n        (3) By keeping the supply of food from disease-producing bacteria:\r\n            (_a_) Use screens to keep out flies, which\r\n                  transfer bacteria from their bodies to food.\r\n            (_b_) Wash fresh fruit and vegetables before\r\n                  using.\r\n            (_c_) Boil for twenty minutes water of doubtful\r\n                  purity.\r\n\r\n        (4) By keeping the bodies of the family strong and healthy, so\r\n            that if bacteria gain an entrance they will be resisted and\r\n            overcome:\r\n            (_a_) Provide well-balanced, nutritious food.\r\n            (_b_) Supply suitable clothing to protect the\r\n                  body.\r\n            (_c_) See that there is an abundant supply of\r\n                  fresh air, night and day.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. DISPOSAL OF WASTE IN VILLAGES AND RURAL DISTRICTS\r\n\r\n        (1) Burn all combustible material.\r\n\r\n        (2) Bury tins, broken dishes, etc.\r\n\r\n        (3) Feed refuse food to animals or empty it\r\n            into a pit dug for the purpose, and cover with\r\n            a layer of earth from time to time.\r\n\r\n        (4) Throw slop water at a distance from the\r\n            house and well, and plant stalky growths like\r\n            sunflowers, which absorb the waste.\r\n\r\n5. METHODS OF DISINFECTING\r\n\r\nWhere bacterial disease is known to exist, the utmost care should be\r\ntaken to subject everything that has come in contact with the patient to\r\na process which will kill the disease-producing plants. Only two ways of\r\ndoing this are known:\r\n\r\n        (1) Subject the bacteria to extreme heat which\r\n            will kill them--\r\n            (_a_) Burn everything that can be burned.\r\n            (_b_) Boil bed and body linen.\r\n            (_c_) Scald dishes.\r\n            (_d_) Scald or bake utensils.\r\n\r\n        (2) Use chemicals to destroy the germs--\r\n           (_a_) Use chemical solutions to wash surfaces,\r\n                 materials, or utensils.\r\n           (_b_) Seal the rooms and burn chemicals to\r\n                 produce vapours which will destroy bacteria.\r\n\r\n        NOTE.--Directions for the use of chemicals are\r\n        given under the lesson on "Home Nursing".\r\n\r\n\r\nHOME NURSING\r\n\r\nThis part of the work does not require a special equipment, though it is\r\nan advantage to have one. An ingenious teacher, with the co-operation of\r\nher pupils, will invent plans for providing whatever is necessary for\r\ndemonstration. Pupils living near the school can supply many of the\r\nneeded materials.\r\n\r\nA doll and doll\'s bed may be used to teach bed making and the changing\r\nof bed-clothing while the patient is in bed. The doll may also be used\r\nto illustrate the method of giving a patient a bath in bed and of\r\nchanging the body clothing, if such information is desired.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, a manual training pupil might construct the bed, and the\r\nsewing class the mattress, bed-clothing, and doll\'s underwear. If this\r\nwere the property of the school, the girls could take turns in making\r\nthe bed every day and in laundering the clothing at home once a week.\r\n\r\nIt is desirable that the instruction in home nursing be given in two\r\nlessons. These may be outlined as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON I\r\n\r\nTHE SICK ROOM\r\n\r\n1. Location.--The room should be on the sunny side of the house and be\r\nas large and airy as possible. The top floor is quieter, but\r\nnecessitates many steps.\r\n\r\n2. Furniture.--All furniture should admit of easy cleaning. Small rugs\r\nare better than a carpet, as they can be easily removed for cleaning. In\r\ninfectious diseases, only bare necessities should be kept in the room.\r\n\r\nThe bed should be single and placed so as to be accessible from both\r\nsides. It should be high enough to prevent the nurse stooping. The\r\nbed-clothing should be of light weight and washable.\r\n\r\nA bedside table should be provided, also a couch for the nurse. A screen\r\nwill be found useful to prevent draughts and to shade the light.\r\n\r\n3. Ventilation.--A thermometer should be used, and the temperature kept\r\nat 65 degrees to 68 degrees, or, in special diseases, according to the\r\ndoctor\'s orders.\r\n\r\nAn abundant supply of fresh air should be provided day and night. To\r\nsecure this, there must be two openings, one to admit pure, fresh air,\r\nand the other to let out the impure air. These openings are preferably\r\non opposite sides of the room and at different heights. If there is only\r\none window, it should be made to open at both top and bottom. In extreme\r\ncases, an adjoining room may be aired and, after the fresh air is warm,\r\nit may be admitted to the sick room.\r\n\r\n4. Care.--The room should be kept very clean and neat. All cleaning\r\nshould be quietly done, so as not to annoy or disturb the patient. The\r\nfloor, wood-work, and furniture should be dusted with a damp cloth.\r\n\r\nFlowers should be removed at night and should have fresh water daily.\r\n\r\nNo food or medicine should he left in the room. Soiled dishes or\r\nclothing should be removed as soon as possible and, in cases of\r\ninfectious diseases, placed in water containing a disinfectant.\r\n\r\nAll excreta should be taken away immediately and, if necessary,\r\ndisinfected before being emptied.\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF DISINFECTING\r\n\r\n1. Dishes or clothing.--(1) Make a solution using one part of carbolic\r\nacid to twenty parts of water (six teaspoonfuls to a pint of water) and\r\nlet it stand for half an hour. Soak the articles in this for two hours.\r\n(2) Use formalin according to directions. (3) Use bichloride tablets\r\naccording to directions. (This turns clothes yellow.)\r\n\r\n        NOTE.--These solutions must be renewed every\r\n        twenty-four hours, if exposed to the air.\r\n\r\n2. Excreta.--Cover the excreta with one of the above solutions and allow\r\nit to stand for half an hour before emptying.\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON II\r\n\r\nTHE PATIENT\r\n\r\n1. Care of the bed.--The bed of a sick person should be kept specially\r\nclean and fresh. The linen should be changed every day, or oftener if\r\nsoiled. Where the supply of linen is limited, or where there is pressure\r\nof work, a good airing and sunning may occasionally take the place of\r\nlaundering.\r\n\r\nIn making the bed, it should be kept in mind that the under sheet\r\nrequires unusual tucking in at the head, to prevent its slipping down\r\nand becoming wrinkled. The upper sheet should receive extra attention at\r\nthe foot, as it is apt to pull up.\r\n\r\nWhen changing the sheets with the patient in bed, work as deftly and\r\nquietly as possible. Have the clean sheets warmed and the room\r\ncomfortably heated. Begin with the under sheet as follows:\r\n\r\n        (1) To change the under sheet.--Turn the\r\n            patient over on the side away from you and fold\r\n            the soiled sheet in flat folds close to the\r\n            body. Lay the clean sheet on the side of the\r\n            bed near you, tuck it in, and fold half of it\r\n            against the roll of soiled sheet, so that both\r\n            can be slipped under the body at once. Turn the\r\n            patient back to the opposite side, on the clean\r\n            sheet, pull out the soiled sheet, and tuck the\r\n            clean one smoothly in place.\r\n\r\n        (2) To change the upper sheet.--Loosen all the\r\n            clothes at the foot of the bed. Spread a clean\r\n            sheet and blanket, wrong side up, on top of the\r\n            other bedclothes. Pin the clean clothes at the\r\n            head of the bed or get the patient to hold\r\n            them. Gradually slip down and draw out the\r\n            soiled sheet and blanket. Tuck all in place.\r\n\r\n2. Care of the diet.--Recovery from sickness in many cases depends more\r\nupon the right kind of food than on medicine. The importance of proper\r\ndiet should have been impressed on the minds of the pupils by their\r\nlessons on food, in the Junior Grade of Form IV. They may now be shown\r\nthat, in sickness, the responsibility of the choice of food is\r\ntransferred from the patient to the doctor or nurse. Hence it is most\r\nimportant that a person acting as nurse should be trained in food values\r\nand proper methods of cooking. She should also be capable of exercising\r\ndaintiness and artistic skill in serving, so that the appearance of the\r\nfood may tempt the patient to eat it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Invalid\'s tray]\r\n\r\nIt should not be necessary to review the comparative values of the\r\nwell-known foods or the best methods of applying heat to make and keep\r\nthese foods digestible; it may be taken for granted that the class\r\nremembers these facts. The time may be more profitably used in naming\r\nand discussing special dishes which are included in invalid cookery.\r\nRecipes may be given for any of these which the pupils desire or the\r\nteacher chooses, and one or two of the dishes which require very little\r\ntime to make, may be prepared.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of convenience, diets for the sick may be classified as\r\n_Milk_, _Liquid_, _Light_, and _Full_. These terms are an easy way of\r\nindicating a certain range of foods.\r\n\r\nMilk Diet.--Milk, butter-milk, koumyss, kephyr.\r\n\r\n        NOTE.--Lime-water may be given with sweet milk,\r\n        one part to three of milk.\r\n\r\nLiquid Diet.--Milk diet, beef juice or beef-tea, broths, gruels, and\r\nsometimes jelly.\r\n\r\nLight Diet.--Soup, white meat of fowl, white fish, oysters, soft-cooked\r\neggs, custard, milk puddings, fruit, gelatine jellies.\r\n\r\nFull Diet.--Any food that is not particularly hard to digest.\r\n\r\n        NOTE.--Plenty of water should be given in all\r\n        diets.\r\n\r\n\r\nPOULTICES\r\n\r\nA poultice is used to reduce inflammation and should be as large as the\r\naffected part.\r\n\r\nThe kinds in ordinary use are:\r\n\r\n1. Mustard poultice, used as a counter irritant.\r\n\r\n2. Linseed, bread, or potato poultice, used to soothe.\r\n\r\nDirections for a mustard poultice:\r\n\r\n1. For a very strong poultice, mix pure mustard to a paste with warm\r\nwater; spread on a piece of cheesecloth or muslin, leaving a margin of\r\nan inch; fold over the margin, and cover with thicker cotton or paper.\r\n\r\n2. For milder poultices use flour to reduce the mustard as follows:\r\n\r\n        (1) 1 part flour to 1 part mustard\r\n\r\n        (2) 2 parts flour to 1 part mustard\r\n\r\n        (3) 3 parts flour to 1 part mustard.\r\n\r\nDirections for linseed, bread, or potato poultices:\r\n\r\n        Use boiling water to mix the above to the\r\n        consistency of thick porridge, and spread as in\r\n        the mustard poultice, excepting that the layer\r\n        of poultice is made much thicker, in order to\r\n        retain the moisture and heat.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOMENTATIONS\r\n\r\nThese are much the same in their effects as poultices, but are sometimes\r\nmore convenient.\r\n\r\nDirections for fomentations:\r\n\r\n        Spread a towel over a large basin, place a\r\n        flannel in the towel and pour boiling hot water\r\n        over it. Fold the towel over the flannel,\r\n        gather the dry ends of the towel in either\r\n        hand, and wring. Carry to the patient, shake\r\n        out the flannel, and apply.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following books are recommended for reference, the more useful being\r\nmarked with an asterisk:\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOME\r\n\r\nFurnishing of a Modest Home.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Its 501(c)(3) letter is posted at\r\nhttp://pglaf.org/fundraising.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
