EDWIN A. ABBOTT, M.A.,\r\n\r\n  HEAD MASTER OF THE CITY OF LONDON SCHOOL.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: QUI LEGIT REGIT]\r\n\r\n\r\n  THE AUTHOR\'S COPYRIGHT EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\n  BOSTON:\r\n  ROBERTS BROTHERS.\r\n  1883.\r\n\r\n  UNIVERSITY PRESS: JOHN WILSON & SON.\r\n  CAMBRIDGE.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlmost every English boy can be taught to write clearly, so far at\r\nleast as clearness depends upon the arrangement of words. Force,\r\nelegance, and variety of style are more difficult to teach, and far\r\nmore difficult to learn; but clear writing can be reduced to rules. To\r\nteach the art of writing clearly is the main object of these Rules and\r\nExercises.\r\n\r\nAmbiguity may arise, not only from bad arrangement, but also from\r\nother causes--from the misuse of single words, and from confused\r\nthought. These causes are not removable by definite rules, and\r\ntherefore, though not neglected, are not prominently considered in\r\nthis book. My object rather is to point out some few continually\r\nrecurring causes of ambiguity, and to suggest definite remedies in\r\neach case. Speeches in Parliament, newspaper narratives and articles,\r\nand, above all, resolutions at public meetings, furnish abundant\r\ninstances of obscurity arising from the monotonous neglect of some\r\ndozen simple rules.\r\n\r\nThe art of writing forcibly is, of course, a valuable\r\nacquisition--almost as valuable as the art of writing clearly. But\r\nforcible expression is not, like clear expression, a mere question of\r\nmechanism and of the manipulation of words; it is a much higher power,\r\nand implies much more.\r\n\r\nWriting clearly does not imply thinking clearly. A man may think and\r\nreason as obscurely as Dogberry himself, but he may (though it is not\r\nprobable that he will) be able to write clearly for all that. Writing\r\nclearly--so far as arrangement of words is concerned--is a mere matter\r\nof adverbs, conjunctions, prepositions, and auxiliary verbs, placed\r\nand repeated according to definite rules.[1] Even obscure or illogical\r\nthought can be clearly expressed; indeed, the transparent medium of\r\nclear writing is not least beneficial when it reveals the illogical\r\nnature of the meaning beneath it.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if a man is to write forcibly, he must (to use a\r\nwell-known illustration) describe Jerusalem as "sown with salt," not\r\nas "captured," and the Jews not as being "subdued" but as "almost\r\nexterminated" by Titus. But what does this imply? It implies\r\nknowledge, and very often a great deal of knowledge, and it implies\r\nalso a vivid imagination. The writer must have eyes to see the vivid\r\nside of everything, as well as words to describe what he sees. Hence\r\nforcible writing, and of course tasteful writing also, is far less a\r\nmatter of rules than is clear writing; and hence, though forcible\r\nwriting is exemplified in the exercises, clear writing occupies most\r\nof the space devoted to the rules.\r\n\r\nBoys who are studying Latin and Greek stand in especial need of help\r\nto enable them to write a long English sentence clearly. The periods\r\nof Thucydides and Cicero are not easily rendered into our idiom\r\nwithout some knowledge of the links that connect an English sentence.\r\n\r\nThere is scarcely any better training, rhetorical as well as logical,\r\nthan the task of construing Thucydides into genuine English; but the\r\nflat, vague, long-winded Greek-English and Latin-English imposture\r\nthat is often tolerated in our examinations and is allowed to pass\r\ncurrent for genuine English, diminishes instead of increasing the\r\npower that our pupils should possess over their native language. By\r\ngetting marks at school and college for construing good Greek and\r\nLatin into bad English, our pupils systematically unlearn what they\r\nmay have been allowed to pick up from Milton and from Shakespeare.\r\n\r\nI must acknowledge very large obligations to Professor Bain\'s treatise\r\non "English Composition and Rhetoric," and also to his English\r\nGrammar. I have not always been able to agree with Professor Bain as\r\nto matters of taste; but I find it difficult to express my admiration\r\nfor the systematic thoroughness and suggestiveness of his book on\r\nComposition. In particular, Professor Bain\'s rule on the use of "that"\r\nand "which" (see Rule 8) deserves to be better known.[2] The ambiguity\r\nproduced by the confusion between these two forms of the Relative is\r\nnot a mere fiction of pedants; it is practically serious. Take, for\r\ninstance, the following sentence, which appeared lately in one of our\r\nablest weekly periodicals: "There are a good many Radical members in\r\nthe House _who_ cannot forgive the Prime Minister for being a\r\nChristian." Twenty years hence, who is to say whether the meaning is\r\n"_and they_, i.e. _all the Radical_ members in the House," or "there\r\nare a good many Radical members of the House _that_ cannot &c."?\r\nProfessor Bain, apparently admitting no exceptions to his useful rule,\r\namends many sentences in a manner that seems to me intolerably harsh.\r\nTherefore, while laying due stress on the utility of the rule, I have\r\nendeavoured to point out and explain the exceptions.\r\n\r\nThe rules are stated as briefly as possible, and are intended not so\r\nmuch for use by themselves as for reference while the pupil is working\r\nat the exercises. Consequently, there is no attempt to prove the rules\r\nby accumulations of examples. The few examples that are given, are\r\ngiven not to prove, but to illustrate the rules. The exercises are\r\nintended to be written out and revised, as exercises usually are; but\r\nthey may also be used for _viv\xc3\xa2 voce_ instruction. The books being\r\nshut, the pupils, with their written exercises before them, may be\r\nquestioned as to the reasons for the several alterations they have\r\nmade. Experienced teachers will not require any explanation of the\r\narrangement or rather non-arrangement of the exercises. They have been\r\npurposely mixed together unclassified to prevent the pupil from\r\nrelying upon anything but his own common sense and industry, to show\r\nhim what is the fault in each case, and how it is to be amended.\r\nBesides references to the rules, notes are attached to each sentence,\r\nso that the exercises ought not to present any difficulty to a\r\npainstaking boy of twelve or thirteen, provided he has first been\r\nfairly trained in English grammar.\r\n\r\nThe "Continuous Extracts" present rather more difficulty, and are\r\nintended for boys somewhat older than those for whom the Exercises are\r\nintended. The attempt to modernize, and clarify, so to speak, the\r\nstyle of Burnet, Clarendon, and Bishop Butler,[3] may appear\r\nambitious, and perhaps requires some explanation. My object has, of\r\ncourse, not been to _improve upon_ the style of these authors, but to\r\nshow how their meaning might be expressed more clearly in modern\r\nEnglish. The charm of the style is necessarily lost, but if the loss\r\nis recognized both by teacher and pupil, there is nothing, in my\r\nopinion, to counterbalance the obvious utility of such exercises.\r\nProfessor Bain speaks to the same effect:[4] "For an English exercise,\r\nthe matter should in some way or other be supplied, and the pupil\r\ndisciplined in giving it expression. I know of no better method than\r\nto prescribe passages containing good matter, but in some respects\r\nimperfectly worded, to be amended according to the laws and the\r\nproprieties of style. Our older writers might be extensively, though\r\nnot exclusively, drawn upon for this purpose."\r\n\r\nTo some of the friends whose help has been already acknowledged in\r\n"English Lessons for English People," I am indebted for further help\r\nin revising these pages. I desire to express especial obligations to\r\nthe Rev. J. H. Lupton, late Fellow of St. John\'s College, Cambridge,\r\nand Second Master of St. Paul\'s School, for copious and valuable\r\nsuggestions; also to several of my colleagues at the City of London\r\nSchool, among whom I must mention in particular the Rev. A. R. Vardy,\r\nFellow of Trinity College, Cambridge.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBefore electrotyping the Fourth and Revised Edition, I wish to say one\r\nword as to the manner in which this book has been used by my highest\r\nclass, as a collection of Rules for reference in their construing\r\nlessons. In construing, from Thucydides especially, I have found Rules\r\n5, 30, 34, 36, 37, and 40_a_, of great use. The rules about Metaphor\r\nand Climax have also been useful in correcting faults of taste in\r\ntheir Latin and Greek compositions. I have hopes that, used in this\r\nway, this little book may be of service to the highest as well as to\r\nthe middle classes of our schools.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Punctuation is fully discussed in most English Grammars, and is\r\ntherefore referred to in this book only so far as is necessary to\r\npoint out the slovenly fault of trusting too much to punctuation, and\r\ntoo little to arrangement.\r\n\r\n[2] Before meeting with Professor Bain\'s rule, I had shown that the\r\ndifference between the Relatives is generally observed by Shakespeare.\r\nSee "Shakespearian Grammar," paragraph 259.\r\n\r\n[3] Sir Archibald Alison stands on a very different footing. The\r\nextracts from this author are intended to exhibit the dangers of\r\nverbosity and exaggeration.\r\n\r\n[4] "English Composition and Rhetoric," p. vii.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n                                                  PAGE\r\n\r\n  INDEX OF RULES                                 11-13\r\n\r\n  RULES                                          14-40\r\n\r\n  SHORT EXERCISES                                41-63\r\n\r\n  CONTINUOUS EXERCISES--CLARENDON                64-70\r\n\r\n       "        "       BURNET                   70-73\r\n\r\n       "        "       BUTLER                   74-75\r\n\r\n       "        "       SIR ARCHIBALD ALISON     76-78\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX OF RULES.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. CLEARNESS AND FORCE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWORDS.\r\n\r\n1. Use words in their proper sense.\r\n\r\n2. Avoid exaggerations.\r\n\r\n3. Avoid useless circumlocution and "fine writing."\r\n\r\n4. Be careful in the use of "not ... and," "any," "but," "only," "not\r\n... or," "that."\r\n\r\n4 _a_. Be careful in the use of ambiguous words, _e.g._ "certain."\r\n\r\n5. Be careful in the use of "he," "it," "they," "these," &c.\r\n\r\n6. Report a speech in the First Person, where necessary to avoid\r\nambiguity.\r\n\r\n6 _a_. Use the Third Person where the exact words of the speaker are\r\nnot intended to be given.\r\n\r\n6 _b_. Omission of "that" in a speech in the Third Person.\r\n\r\n7. When you use a Participle implying "when," "while," "though," or\r\n"that," show clearly by the context what is implied.\r\n\r\n8. When using the Relative Pronoun, use "who" or "which," if the\r\nmeaning is "and he" or "and it," "for he" or "for it." In other cases\r\nuse "that," if euphony allows. Exceptions.\r\n\r\n9. Do not use "and which" for "which."\r\n\r\n10. Equivalents for the Relative: (_a_) Participle or Adjective; (_b_)\r\nInfinitive; (_c_) "Whereby," "whereto," &c.; (_d_) "If a man;" (_e_)\r\n"And he," "and this," &c.; (_f_) "what;" (_g_) omission of Relative.\r\n\r\n10 _a\'_. Repeat the Antecedent before the Relative, where the\r\nnon-repetition causes any ambiguity. See 38.\r\n\r\n11. Use particular for general terms. Avoid abstract Nouns.\r\n\r\n11 _a_. Avoid Verbal Nouns where Verbs can be used.\r\n\r\n12. Use particular persons instead of a class.\r\n\r\n13. Use metaphor instead of literal statement.\r\n\r\n14. Do not confuse metaphor.\r\n\r\n14 _a_. Do not mix metaphor with literal statement.\r\n\r\n14 _b_. Do not use poetic metaphor to illustrate a prosaic subject.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER OF WORDS IN A SENTENCE.\r\n\r\n15. Emphatic words must stand in emphatic positions; _i.e._, for the\r\nmost part, at the beginning or the end of the sentence.\r\n\r\n15 _a_. Unemphatic words must, as a rule, be kept from the end.\r\nExceptions.\r\n\r\n15 _b_. An interrogation sometimes gives emphasis.\r\n\r\n16. The Subject, if unusually emphatic, should often be transferred\r\nfrom the beginning of the sentence.\r\n\r\n17. The Object is sometimes placed before the Verb for emphasis.\r\n\r\n18. Where several words are emphatic, make it clear which is the most\r\nemphatic. Emphasis can sometimes be given by adding an epithet, or an\r\nintensifying word.\r\n\r\n19. Words should be as near as possible to the words with which they\r\nare grammatically connected.\r\n\r\n20. Adverbs should be placed next to the words they are intended to\r\nqualify.\r\n\r\n21. "Only"; the strict rule is that "only" should be placed before the\r\nword it affects.\r\n\r\n22. When "not only" precedes "but also," see that each is followed by\r\nthe same part of speech.\r\n\r\n23. "At least," "always," and other adverbial adjuncts, sometimes\r\nproduce ambiguity.\r\n\r\n24. Nouns should be placed near the Nouns that they define.\r\n\r\n25. Pronouns should follow the Nouns to which they refer, without the\r\nintervention of any other Noun.\r\n\r\n26. Clauses that are grammatically connected should be kept as close\r\ntogether as possible. Avoid parentheses. But see 55.\r\n\r\n27. In conditional sentences, the antecedent or "if-clauses" must be\r\nkept distinct from the consequent clauses.\r\n\r\n28. Dependent clauses preceded by "that" should be kept distinct from\r\nthose that are independent.\r\n\r\n29. Where there are several infinitives, those that are dependent on\r\nthe same word must be kept distinct from those that are not.\r\n\r\n30. The principle of Suspense.\r\n\r\n30 _a_. It is a violation of the principle of suspense to introduce\r\nunexpectedly at the end of a long sentence, some short and unemphatic\r\nclause beginning with (_a_) "not," (_b_) "which."\r\n\r\n31. Suspense must not be excessive.\r\n\r\n32. In a sentence with "if," "when," "though," &c., put the\r\n"if-clause," antecedent, or protasis, first.\r\n\r\n33. Suspense is gained by placing a Participle or Adjective, that\r\nqualifies the Subject, before the Subject.\r\n\r\n34. Suspensive Conjunctions, _e.g._ "either," "not only," "on the one\r\nhand," &c., add clearness.\r\n\r\n35. Repeat the Subject, where its omission would cause obscurity or\r\nambiguity.\r\n\r\n36. Repeat a Preposition after an intervening Conjunction, especially\r\nif a Verb and an Object also intervene.\r\n\r\n37. Repeat Conjunctions, Auxiliary Verbs, and Pronominal Adjectives.\r\n\r\n37 _a_. Repeat Verbs after the Conjunctions "than," "as," &c.\r\n\r\n38. Repeat the Subject, or some other emphatic word, or a summary of\r\nwhat has been said, if the sentence is so long that it is difficult to\r\nkeep the thread of meaning unbroken.\r\n\r\n39. Clearness is increased, when the beginning of the sentence\r\nprepares the way for the middle, and the middle for the end, the whole\r\nforming a kind of ascent. This ascent is called "climax."\r\n\r\n40. When the thought is expected to ascend, but descends, feebleness,\r\nand sometimes confusion, is the result. The descent is called\r\n"bathos."\r\n\r\n40 _a_. A new construction should not be introduced unexpectedly.\r\n\r\n41. Antithesis adds force and often clearness.\r\n\r\n42. Epigram.\r\n\r\n43. Let each sentence have one, and only one, principal subject of\r\nthought. Avoid heterogeneous sentences.\r\n\r\n44. The connection between different sentences must be kept up by\r\nAdverbs used as Conjunctions, or by means of some other connecting\r\nwords at the beginning of the sentence.\r\n\r\n45. The connection between two long sentences or paragraphs sometimes\r\nrequires a short intervening sentence showing the transition of\r\nthought.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. BREVITY.\r\n\r\n46. Metaphor is briefer than literal statement.\r\n\r\n47. General terms are briefer, though less forcible, than particular\r\nterms.\r\n\r\n47 _a_. A phrase may sometimes be expressed by a word.\r\n\r\n48. Participles may often be used as brief (though sometimes\r\nambiguous) equivalents of phrases containing Conjunctions and Verbs.\r\n\r\n49. Participles, Adjectives, Participial Adjectives, and Nouns may be\r\nused as equivalents for phrases containing the Relative.\r\n\r\n50. A statement may sometimes be briefly implied instead of being\r\nexpressed at length.\r\n\r\n51. Conjunctions may be omitted. Adverbs, _e.g._ "very," "so."\r\nExaggerated epithets, _e.g._ "incalculable," "unprecedented."\r\n\r\n51 _a_. The imperative may be used for "if &c."\r\n\r\n52. Apposition may be used, so as to convert two sentences into one.\r\n\r\n53. Condensation may be effected by not repeating (1) the common\r\nSubject of several Verbs; (2) the common Object of several Verbs or\r\nPrepositions.\r\n\r\n54. Tautology. Repeating what may be implied.\r\n\r\n55. Parenthesis maybe used with advantage to brevity. See 26.\r\n\r\n56. Brevity often clashes with clearness. Let clearness be the first\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLEARNESS AND FORCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Numbers in brackets refer to the Rules._\r\n\r\n\r\nWORDS.\r\n\r\n*1. Use words in their proper sense.*\r\n\r\nWrite, not "His _apparent_ guilt justified his friends in disowning\r\nhim," but "his _evident_ guilt." "Conscious" and "aware," "unnatural"\r\nand "supernatural," "transpire" and "occur," "circumstance" and\r\n"event," "reverse" and "converse," "eliminate" and "elicit," are often\r\nconfused together.\r\n\r\nThis rule forbids the use of the same word in different senses. "It is\r\nin my _power_ to refuse your request, and since I have _power_ to do\r\nthis, I may lawfully do it." Here the second "power" is used for\r\n"authority."\r\n\r\nThis rule also forbids the slovenly use of "nice," "awfully,"\r\n"delicious," "glorious," &c. See (2).\r\n\r\n\r\n*2. Avoid exaggerations.*\r\n\r\n"The _boundless_ plains in the heart of the empire furnished\r\n_inexhaustible_ supplies of corn, that would have almost sufficed for\r\ntwice the population."\r\n\r\nHere "inexhaustible" is inconsistent with what follows. The words\r\n"unprecedented," "incalculable," "very," and "stupendous" are often\r\nused in the same loose way.\r\n\r\n\r\n*3. Avoid useless circumlocution and "fine writing."*\r\n\r\n"Her Majesty here _partook of lunch_." Write "_lunched_."\r\n\r\n"Partook of" implies sharing, and is incorrect as well as lengthy.\r\n\r\nSo, do not use "apex" for "top," "species" for "kind," "individual"\r\nfor "man," "assist" for "help," &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n*4. Be careful how you use the following words: "not ... and," "any,"\r\n"only," "not ... or," "that."*[5]\r\n\r\n*And.* See below, "Or."\r\n\r\n*Any.*--"I am not bound to receive _any_ messenger that you send."\r\nDoes this mean _every_, or _a single_? Use "every" or "a single."\r\n\r\n*Not.*--(1) "I do _not_ intend to help you, because you are my enemy\r\n&c." ought to mean (2), "I intend not to help you, and my reason for\r\nnot helping you is, because you are my enemy." But it is often wrongly\r\nused to mean (3), "I intend to help you, not because you are my enemy\r\n(but because you are poor, blind, &c.)." In the latter case, _not_\r\nought to be separated from _intend_. By distinctly marking the limits\r\nto which the influence of _not_ extends, the ambiguity may be removed.\r\n\r\n*Only* is often used ambiguously for _alone_. "The rest help me to\r\nrevenge myself; you _only_ advise me to wait." This ought to mean,\r\n"you only _advise_, instead of _helping_;" but in similar sentences\r\n"you only" is often used for "you alone." But see 21.\r\n\r\n*Or.*--When "or" is preceded by a negative, as "I do not want butter\r\n_or_ honey," "or" ought not, strictly speaking, to be used like "and,"\r\nnor like "nor." The strict use of "not ... or" would be as follows:--\r\n\r\n"You say you don\'t want both butter _and_ honey--you want butter _or_\r\nhoney; I, on the contrary, _do not want butter or honey_--I want them\r\nboth."\r\n\r\nPractically, however, this meaning is so rare, that "I don\'t want\r\nbutter _or_ honey" is regularly used for "I want neither butter nor\r\nhoney." But where there is the slightest danger of ambiguity, it is\r\ndesirable to use _nor_.\r\n\r\nThe same ambiguity attends "not ... and." "I do not see Thomas _and_\r\nJohn" is commonly used for "I see neither Thomas nor John;" but it\r\nmight mean, "I do not see them both--I see only one of them."\r\n\r\n*That.*--The different uses of "that" produce much ambiguity, _e.g._\r\n"I am so much surprised by this statement _that_ I am desirous of\r\nresigning, _that_ I scarcely know what reply to make." Here it is\r\nimpossible to tell, till one has read past "resigning," whether the\r\nfirst "that" depends upon "so" or "statement." Write: "The statement\r\nthat I am desirous of resigning surprises me so much that I scarcely\r\nknow &c."\r\n\r\n*4 a. Be careful in the use of ambiguous words, e.g. "certain."*\r\n\r\n"Certain" is often used for "some," as in "Independently of his\r\nearnings, he has a _certain_ property," where the meaning might be\r\n"unfailing."\r\n\r\nUnder this head may be mentioned the double use of words, such as\r\n"left" in the same form and sound, but different in meaning. Even\r\nwhere there is no obscurity, the juxtaposition of the same word twice\r\nused in two senses is inelegant, _e.g._ (Bain), "He turned to the\r\n_left_ and _left_ the room."\r\n\r\nI have known the following slovenly sentence misunderstood: "Our\r\nobject is that, with the aid of practice, we may sometime arrive at\r\nthe point where we think eloquence in its most praiseworthy form _to\r\nlie_." "To lie" has been supposed to mean "to deceive."\r\n\r\n\r\n*5. Be careful how you use "he," "it," "they," "these," &c.* (For\r\n"which" see 8.) The ambiguity arising from the use of _he_ applying to\r\ndifferent persons is well known.\r\n\r\n"He told his friend that if _he_ did not feel better in half an hour\r\nhe thought _he_ had better return." See (6) for remedy.\r\n\r\nMuch ambiguity is also caused by excessive use of such phrases as _in\r\nthis way_, _of this sort_, &c.\r\n\r\n"God, foreseeing the disorders of human nature, has given us certain\r\npassions and affections which arise from, or whose objects are, these\r\ndisorders. _Of this sort_ are fear, resentment, compassion."\r\n\r\nRepeat the noun: "Among these passions and affections are fear &c."\r\n\r\nTwo distinct uses of _it_ may be noted. _It_, when referring to\r\nsomething that precedes, may be called "retrospective;" but when to\r\nsomething that follows, "prospective." In "Avoid indiscriminate\r\ncharity: _it_ is a crime," "it" is retrospective.[6] In "_It_ is a\r\ncrime to give indiscriminately," "it" is prospective.\r\n\r\nThe prospective "it," if productive of ambiguity, can often be omitted\r\nby using the infinitive as a subject: "To give indiscriminately is a\r\ncrime."\r\n\r\n\r\n*6. Report a speech in the First, not the Third Person, where\r\nnecessary to avoid ambiguity.* Speeches in the third person afford a\r\nparticular, though very common case, of the general ambiguity\r\nmentioned in (5). Instead of "He told his friend that if _he_ did not\r\nfeel better &c.," write "He said to his friend, \'If, _I_ (or _you_)\r\ndon\'t feel better &c.\'"\r\n\r\n*6 a. Sometimes, where the writer cannot know the exact words, or\r\nwhere the exact words are unimportant, or lengthy and uninteresting,\r\nthe Third Person is preferable.* Thus, where Essex is asking Sir\r\nRobert Cecil that Francis Bacon may be appointed Attorney-General, the\r\ndialogue is (as it almost always is in Lord Macaulay\'s writings) in\r\nthe First Person, _except where it becomes tedious and uninteresting\r\nso as to require condensation_, and then it drops into the Third\r\nPerson:\r\n\r\n"Sir Robert _had nothing to say but_ that he thought his own abilities\r\nequal to the place which he hoped to obtain, and that his father\'s\r\nlong services deserved such a mark of gratitude from the Queen."\r\n\r\n*6 b. Omission of "that" in a speech reported in the Third\r\nPerson.*--Even when a speech is reported in the third person, "that"\r\nneed not always be inserted before the dependent verb. Thus, instead\r\nof "He said that he took it ill that his promises were not believed,"\r\nwe may write, "\'He took it ill,\' he said, \'that &c.\'" This gives a\r\nlittle more life, and sometimes more clearness also.\r\n\r\n\r\n*7. When you use a Participle, as "walking," implying "when," "while,"\r\n"though," "that," make it clear by the context what is implied.*\r\n\r\n"Republics, in the first instance, are never desired for their own\r\nsakes. I do not think they will finally be desired at all,\r\n_unaccompanied_ by courtly graces and good breeding."\r\n\r\nHere there is a little doubt whether the meaning is "_since_ they are,\r\nor, _if_ they are, unaccompanied."\r\n\r\n*That or when.*--"Men _walking_ (_that_ walk, or _when_ they walk) on\r\nice sometimes fall."\r\n\r\nIt is better to use "men walking" to mean "men _when_ they walk." If\r\nthe relative is meant, use "men that walk," instead of the participle.\r\n\r\n  (1) "_While_   he was } _Walking_ on { (1) the road, } he fell."\r\n  (2) "_Because_ he was }              { (2) the ice,  }\r\n\r\nWhen the participle precedes the subject, it generally implies a\r\ncause: "_Seeing_ this, he retired." Otherwise it generally has its\r\nproper participial meaning, _e.g._ "He retired, _keeping_ his face\r\ntowards us." If there is any ambiguity, write "_on_ seeing,"--"_at the\r\nsame time_, or _while_, keeping."\r\n\r\n (1) "_Though_ he was}                       {(1) he nevertheless stood\r\n                     }                       {    his ground."\r\n (2) "_Since_ he was } _Struck_ with terror, {(2) he rapidly retreated."\r\n (3) "_If_ he is     }                       {(3) he will soon retreat."\r\n\r\n\r\n*8. When using the Relative Pronoun, use "who" and "which" where the\r\nmeaning is "and he, it, &c.," "for he, it, &c." In other cases use\r\n"that," if euphony allows.*\r\n\r\n"I heard this from the inspector, _who_ (and he) heard it from the\r\nguard _that_ travelled with the train."\r\n\r\n"Fetch me (all) the books _that_ lie on the table, and also the\r\npamphlets, _which_ (and these) you will find on the floor."\r\n\r\nAn adherence to this rule would remove much ambiguity. Thus: "There\r\nwas a public-house next door, _which_ was a great nuisance," means\r\n"_and this_ (_i.e._ the fact of its being next door) was a great\r\nnuisance;" whereas _that_ would have meant "Next door was a\r\npublic-house _that_ (_i.e._ the public-house) was a great nuisance."\r\n*"Who," "which," &c. introduce a new fact about the antecedent,\r\nwhereas "that" introduces something without which the antecedent is\r\nincomplete or undefined.* Thus, in the first example above,\r\n"inspector" is complete in itself, and "who" introduces a new _fact_\r\nabout him; "guard" is incomplete, and requires "_that_ travelled with\r\nthe train" to complete the meaning.\r\n\r\nIt is not, and cannot be, maintained that this rule, though observed\r\nin Elizabethan English, is observed by our best modern authors.\r\n(Probably a general impression that "that" cannot be used to refer to\r\npersons has assisted "who" in supplanting "that" as a relative.) But\r\nthe convenience of the rule is so great that beginners in composition\r\nmay with advantage adhere to the rule. The following are some of the\r\ncases where _who_ and _which_ are mostly used, contrary to the rule,\r\ninstead of _that_.\r\n\r\n*Exceptions:*--\r\n\r\n(_a_) When the antecedent is defined, _e.g._ by a possessive case,\r\nmodern English uses _who_ instead of _that_. It is rare, though it\r\nwould be useful,[7] to say "His English friends _that_ had not seen\r\nhim" for "the English friends, or those of his English friends, that\r\nhad not seen him."\r\n\r\n(_b_) _That_ sounds ill when separated from its verb and from its\r\nantecedents, and emphasized by isolation: "There are many persons\r\n_that_, though unscrupulous, are commonly good-tempered, and _that_,\r\nif not strongly incited by self-interest, are ready for the most part\r\nto think of the interest of their neighbours." Shakespeare frequently\r\nuses _who_ after _that_ when the relative is repeated. See\r\n"Shakespearian Grammar," par. 260.\r\n\r\n(_c_) If the antecedent is qualified by _that_, the relative must not\r\nbe _that_. Besides other considerations, the repetition is\r\ndisagreeable. Addison ridicules such language as "_That_ remark _that_\r\nI made yesterday is not _that_ _that_ I said _that_ I regretted _that_\r\nI had made."\r\n\r\n(_d_) _That_ cannot be preceded by a preposition, and hence throws the\r\npreposition to the end. "This is the rule _that_ I adhere _to_." This\r\nis perfectly good English, though sometimes unnecessarily avoided.\r\nBut, with some prepositions, the construction is harsh and\r\nobjectionable, _e.g._ "This is the mark _that_ I jumped _beyond_,"\r\n"Such were the prejudices _that_ he rose _above_." The reason is that\r\nsome of these disyllabic prepositions are used as adverbs, and, when\r\nseparated from their nouns, give one the impression that they are used\r\nas adverbs.\r\n\r\n(_e_) After pronominal adjectives used for personal pronouns, modern\r\nEnglish prefers _who_. "There are many, others, several, those, _who_\r\ncan testify &c."\r\n\r\n(_f_) After _that_ used as a conjunction there is sometimes a dislike\r\nto use _that_ as a relative. See (_c_).\r\n\r\n\r\n*9. Do not use redundant "and" before "which."[8]*\r\n\r\n"I gave him a very interesting book for a present, _and which_ cost me\r\nfive shillings."\r\n\r\nIn short sentences the absurdity is evident, but in long sentences it\r\nis less evident, and very common.\r\n\r\n"A petition was presented for rescinding that portion of the bye-laws\r\nwhich permits application of public money to support sectarian\r\nschools over which ratepayers have no control, this being a violation\r\nof the principle of civil and religious liberty, _and which_ the\r\nmemorialists believe would provoke a determined and conscientious\r\nresistance."\r\n\r\nHere _which_ ought grammatically to refer to "portion" or "schools."\r\nBut it seems intended to refer to "violation." Omit "and," or repeat\r\n"a violation" before "which," or turn the sentence otherwise.\r\n\r\n\r\n*10. Equivalents for Relative.*\r\n\r\n*(_a_) Participle.*--"Men _thirsting_ (for \'men _that thirst_\') for\r\nrevenge are not indifferent to plunder." The objection to the\r\nparticiple is that here, as often, it creates a little ambiguity. The\r\nabove sentence may mean, "men, _when_ they thirst," or "_though_ they\r\nthirst," as well as "men _that_ thirst." Often however there is no\r\nambiguity: "I have documents _proving_ this conclusively."\r\n\r\n*(_b_) Infinitive.*--Instead of "He was the first _that_ entered" you\r\ncan write "_to_ enter;" for "He is not a man _who_ will act\r\ndishonestly," "_to_ act." This equivalent cannot often be used.\r\n\r\n*(_c_) Whereby, wherein, &c.,* can sometimes be used for "by _which_,"\r\n"in _which_," so as to avoid a harsh repetition of "_which_." "The\r\nmeans _whereby_ this may be effected." But this use is somewhat\r\nantiquated.\r\n\r\n*(_d_) If.*--"The man _that_ does not care for music is to be pitied"\r\ncan be written (though not so forcibly), "_If_ a man does not care for\r\nmusic, he is to be pitied." It is in long sentences that this\r\nequivalent will be found most useful.\r\n\r\n*(_e_) And this.*--"He did his best, _which_ was all that could be\r\nexpected," can be written, "_and this_ was all that, &c."\r\n\r\n*(_f_) What.*--"Let me repeat _that which_[9] you ought to know, that\r\n_that which_ is worth doing is worth doing well." "Let me repeat,\r\n_what_ you ought to know, that _what_ is worth doing is worth doing\r\nwell."\r\n\r\n*(_g_) Omission of Relative.*--It is sometimes thought ungrammatical\r\nto omit the relative, as in "The man (that) you speak of." On the\r\ncontrary, _that_ when an object (not when a subject) may be omitted,\r\nwherever the antecedent and the subject of the relative sentence are\r\nbrought into juxtaposition by the omission.\r\n\r\n*10 a\'. Repeat the Antecedent in some new form, where there is any\r\nambiguity.* This is particularly useful after a negative: "He said\r\nthat he would not even hear me, _which_ I confess I had expected."\r\nHere the meaning may be, "I had expected that he would," or "that he\r\nwould not, hear me." Write, "_a refusal_, or, _a favour_, that I\r\nconfess I had expected." See (38).\r\n\r\n\r\n*11. Use particular for general terms.*--This is a most important\r\nrule. Instead of "I have neither the necessaries of life nor the means\r\nof procuring them," write (if you can _with truth_), "I have not a\r\ncrust of bread, nor a penny to buy one."\r\n\r\nCAUTION.--There is a danger in this use. The meaning is vividly\r\nexpressed but sometimes may be exaggerated or imperfect. _Crust of\r\nbread_ may be an exaggeration; on the other hand, if the speaker is\r\ndestitute not only of bread, but also of shelter and clothing, then\r\n_crust of bread_ is an imperfect expression of the meaning.\r\n\r\nIn philosophy and science, where the language ought very often to be\r\ninclusive and brief, general and not particular terms must be used.\r\n\r\n*11 a. Avoid Verbal Nouns where Verbs can be used instead.* The\r\ndisadvantage of the use of Verbal Nouns is this, that, unless they are\r\nimmediately preceded by prepositions, they are sometimes liable to be\r\nconfounded with participles. The following is an instance of an\r\nexcessive use of Verbal Nouns:\r\n\r\n"The pretended confession of the secretary was only collusion to lay\r\nthe jealousies of the king\'s _favouring_ popery, which still hung upon\r\nhim, notwithstanding his _writing_ on the Revelation, and _affecting_\r\nto enter on all occasions into controversy, _asserting_ in particular\r\nthat the Pope was Antichrist."\r\n\r\nWrite "notwithstanding that he wrote and affected &c."\r\n\r\n\r\n*12. Use a particular Person instead of a class.*\r\n\r\n"What is the splendour of _the greatest monarch_ compared with the\r\nbeauty of _a flower_?" "What is the splendour of Solomon compared with\r\nthe beauty of a daisy?"\r\n\r\nUnder this head may come the forcible use of Noun for Adjective: "This\r\nfortress is _weakness_ itself."\r\n\r\nAn excess of this use is lengthy and pedantically bombastic, _e.g._,\r\nthe following paraphrase for "in every British colony:"--"under Indian\r\npalm-groves, amid Australian gum-trees, in the shadow of African\r\nmimosas, and beneath Canadian pines."\r\n\r\n\r\n*13. Use Metaphor instead of literal statement.*\r\n\r\n"The ship _ploughs_ the sea" is clearer than "the ship _cleaves_ the\r\nsea," and shorter than "the ship _cleaves_ the sea _as a plough\r\ncleaves the land_."\r\n\r\nOf course there are some subjects for which Metaphor should not be\r\nused. See (14 _a_) and (14 _b_).\r\n\r\n\r\n*14. Do not confuse Metaphor.*\r\n\r\n"In a moment the thunderbolt was upon them, _deluging_ their country\r\nwith invaders."\r\n\r\nThe following is attributed to Sir Boyle Roche: "Mr. Speaker, I smell\r\na rat, I see him brewing in the air; but, mark me, I shall yet nip him\r\nin the bud."\r\n\r\nSome words, once metaphorical, have ceased to be so regarded. Hence\r\nmany good writers say "_under_ these _circumstances_" instead of "_in_\r\nthese circumstances."\r\n\r\nAn excessive regard for disused metaphor savours of pedantry:\r\ndisregard is inelegant. Write, not, "_unparalleled_ complications,"\r\nbut "_unprecedented_ complications;" and "_he threw light on_\r\nobscurities," instead of "_he unravelled_ obscurities."\r\n\r\n*14 a. Do not introduce literal statement immediately after Metaphor.*\r\n\r\n"He was the father of Chemistry, and brother to the Earl of Cork."\r\n\r\n    "He was a very thunderbolt of war,\r\n    And was lieutenant to the Earl of Mar."\r\n\r\n*14 b. Do not use poetic metaphor to illustrate a prosaic subject.*\r\nThus, we may say "a poet _soars_," or even, though rarely, "a nation\r\n_soars_ to greatness," but you could not say "Consols _soared to_\r\n94-1/2." Even commonplace subjects may be illustrated by metaphor: for\r\nit is a metaphor, and quite unobjectionable, to say "Consols\r\n_mounted_, or _jumped_ to 94-1/2." But commonplace subjects must be\r\nillustrated by metaphor that is commonplace.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER OF WORDS IN A SENTENCE.\r\n\r\n*15. Emphatic words must stand in emphatic positions; i.e. for the\r\nmost part, at the beginning or at the end of the sentence.* This rule\r\noccasionally supersedes the common rules about position. Thus, the\r\nplace for an adverb, as a rule, should be between the subject and\r\nverb: "He _quickly_ left the room;" but if _quickly_ is to be\r\nemphatic, it must come at the beginning or end, as in "I told him to\r\nleave the room slowly, but he left _quickly_."\r\n\r\nAdjectives, in clauses beginning with "if" and "though," often come at\r\nthe beginning for emphasis: "_Insolent_ though he was, he was silenced\r\nat last."\r\n\r\n*15 a. Unemphatic words must, as a rule, be kept from the end of the\r\nsentence.* It is a common fault to break this rule by placing a short\r\nand unemphatic predicate at the end of a long sentence.\r\n\r\n"To know some Latin, even if it be nothing but a few Latin roots, _is\r\nuseful_." Write, "It is useful, &c."\r\n\r\nSo "the evidence proves how kind to his inferiors _he is_."\r\n\r\nOften, where an adjective or auxiliary verb comes at the end, the\r\naddition of an emphatic adverb justifies the position, _e.g._ above,\r\n"is _very_ useful," "he has _invariably_ been."\r\n\r\nA short "chippy" ending, even though emphatic, is to be avoided. It is\r\nabrupt and unrhythmical, _e.g._ "The soldier, transfixed with the\r\nspear, _writhed_." We want a _longer_ ending, "fell writhing to the\r\nground," or, "writhed in the agonies of death." A "chippy" ending is\r\ncommon in bad construing from Virgil.\r\n\r\n*Exceptions.*--Prepositions and pronouns attached to emphatic words\r\nneed not be moved from the end; _e.g._ "He does no harm that I hear\r\n_of_." "Bear witness how I loved _him_."\r\n\r\n*N.B. In all styles, especially in letter-writing, a final emphasis\r\nmust not be so frequent as to become obtrusive and monotonous.*\r\n\r\n*15 b. An interrogation sometimes gives emphasis.* "No one can doubt\r\nthat the prisoner, had he been really guilty, would have shown some\r\nsigns of remorse," is not so emphatic as "Who can doubt, Is it\r\npossible to doubt, &c.?"\r\n\r\nContrast "No one ever names Wentworth without thinking of &c." with\r\n"But Wentworth,--who ever names him without thinking of those harsh\r\ndark features, ennobled by their expression into more than the majesty\r\nof an antique Jupiter?"\r\n\r\n\r\n*16. The subject, if unusually emphatic, should often be removed from\r\nthe beginning of the sentence.* The beginning of the sentence is an\r\nemphatic position, though mostly not so emphatic as the end. Therefore\r\nthe principal subject of a sentence, being emphatic, and being wanted\r\nearly in the sentence to tell us what the sentence is about, comes as\r\na rule, at or near the beginning: "_Thomas_ built this house."\r\n\r\nHence, since the beginning is the _usual_ place for the subject, if we\r\nwant to emphasize "Thomas" _unusually_, we must remove "Thomas" from\r\nthe beginning: "This house was built by _Thomas_," or "It was _Thomas_\r\nthat built this house."\r\n\r\nThus, the emphasis on "conqueror" is not quite so strong in "_A mere\r\nconqueror_ ought not to obtain from us the reverence that is due to\r\nthe great benefactors of mankind," as in "We ought not to bestow the\r\nreverence that is due to the great benefactors of mankind, _upon a\r\nmere conqueror_." Considerable, but less emphasis and greater\r\nsmoothness (19) will be obtained by writing the sentence thus: "We\r\nought not to bestow upon a mere conqueror &c."\r\n\r\nWhere the same subject stands first in several consecutive sentences,\r\nit rises in emphasis, and need not be removed from the beginning, even\r\nthough unusual emphasis be required:\r\n\r\n"The captain was the life and soul of the expedition. _He_ first\r\npointed out the possibility of advancing; _he_ warned them of the\r\napproaching scarcity of provisions; _he_ showed how they might\r\nreplenish their exhausted stock &c."\r\n\r\n\r\n*17. The object is sometimes placed before the verb for emphasis.*\r\nThis is most common in antithesis. "_Jesus_ I know, and _Paul_ I know;\r\nbut who are ye?" "_Some_ he imprisoned, _others_ he put to death."\r\n\r\nEven where there is no antithesis the inversion is not uncommon:\r\n\r\n"Military _courage_, the boast of the sottish German, of the frivolous\r\nand prating Frenchman, of the romantic and arrogant Spaniard, he\r\nneither possesses nor values."\r\n\r\nThis inversion sometimes creates ambiguity in poetry, _e.g._ "The son\r\nthe father slew," and must be sparingly used in prose.\r\n\r\nSometimes the position of a word may be considered appropriate by\r\nsome, and inappropriate by others, according to different\r\ninterpretations of the sentence. Take as an example, "Early in the\r\nmorning the nobles and gentlemen who attended on the king assembled in\r\nthe great hall of the castle; and here they began to talk of what a\r\ndreadful storm it had been the night before. But Macbeth could\r\nscarcely understand what they said, for he was thinking of something\r\nworse." The last sentence has been amended by Professor Bain into\r\n"_What they said_, Macbeth could scarcely understand." But there\r\nappears to be an antithesis between the guiltless nobles who can think\r\nabout the weather, and the guilty Macbeth who cannot. Hence, "what\r\nthey said" ought not, and "Macbeth" ought, to be emphasized: and\r\ntherefore "Macbeth" ought to be retained at the beginning of the\r\nsentence.\r\n\r\nThe same author alters, "The praise of judgment Virgil has justly\r\ncontested with him, but his invention remains yet unrivalled," into\r\n"Virgil has justly contested with him the praise of judgment, but no\r\none has yet rivalled his invention"--an alteration which does not seem\r\nto emphasize sufficiently the antithesis between what had been\r\n\'contested,\' on the one hand, and what remained as yet \'unrivalled\' on\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\nMore judiciously Professor Bain alters, "He that tells a lie is not\r\nsensible how great a task he undertakes; for he must be forced to\r\ninvent twenty more to maintain one," into "for, to maintain one, he\r\nmust invent twenty more," putting the emphatic words in their emphatic\r\nplace, at the end.\r\n\r\n\r\n*18. Where several words are emphatic, make it clear which is the most\r\nemphatic.* Thus, in "The state was made, under the pretence of serving\r\nit, in reality the prize of their contention to each of these opposite\r\nparties," it is unpleasantly doubtful whether the writer means (1)\r\n_state_ or (2) _parties_ to be emphatic.\r\n\r\nIf (1), "As for the _state_, these two parties, under the pretence of\r\nserving it, converted it into a prize for their contention." If (2),\r\nwrite, "Though served in profession, the state was in reality\r\nconverted into a prize for their contention by these two _parties_."\r\nIn (1) _parties_ is subordinated, in (2) _state_.\r\n\r\nSometimes the addition of some intensifying word serves to emphasize.\r\nThus, instead of "To effect this they used all devices," we can write\r\n"To effect this they used _every conceivable device_." So, if we want\r\nto emphasize fidelity in "The business will task your skill and\r\nfidelity," we can write "Not only your skill _but also_ your\r\nfidelity." This, however, sometimes leads to exaggerations. See (2).\r\n\r\nSometimes antithesis gives emphasis, as in "You _do_ not know this,\r\nbut you _shall_ know it." Where antithesis cannot be used, the\r\nemphasis must be expressed by turning the sentence, as "I _will make\r\nyou_ know it," or by some addition, as "You shall _hereafter_ know\r\nit."\r\n\r\n\r\n*19. Words should be as near as possible to the words with which they\r\nare grammatically connected.* See Paragraphs 20 to 29. For exceptions\r\nsee 30.\r\n\r\n\r\n*20. Adverbs should be placed next to the words they are intended to\r\naffect.* When unemphatic, adverbs come between the subject and the\r\nverb, or, if the tense is compound, between the parts of the compound\r\ntense: "He _quickly_ left the room;" "He has _quickly_ left the room;"\r\nbut, when emphatic, after the verb: "He left, or has left, the room\r\n_quickly_."[10] When such a sentence as the latter is followed by a\r\npresent participle, there arises ambiguity. "I told him to go slowly,\r\nbut he left the room _quickly_, dropping the purse on the floor." Does\r\n_quickly_ here modify _left_ or _dropping_? The remedy[11] is, to give\r\nthe adverb its unemphatic place, "He _quickly_ left the room, dropping\r\n&c.," or else to avoid the participle, thus: "He _quickly_ dropped the\r\npurse and left the room," or "He dropped the purse and _quickly_ left\r\nthe room."\r\n\r\n\r\n*21. "Only" requires careful use. The strict[12] rule is, that "only"\r\nshould be placed before the word affected by it.*\r\n\r\nThe following is ambiguous:\r\n\r\n"The heavens are not open to the faithful _only_ at intervals."\r\n\r\nThe best rule is to avoid placing "only" between two emphatic words,\r\nand to avoid using "only" where "alone" can be used instead.\r\n\r\nIn strictness perhaps the three following sentences:\r\n\r\n(1) He _only_ beat three,\r\n\r\n(2) He beat _only_ three,\r\n\r\n(3) He beat three _only_, ought to be explained, severally, thus:\r\n\r\n(1) He did no more than beat, did not kill, three.\r\n\r\n(2) He beat no more than three.\r\n\r\n(3) He beat three, and that was all he did. (Here _only_ modifies the\r\nwhole of the sentence and depreciates the action.)\r\n\r\nBut the best authors sometimes transpose the word. "He _only_ lived"\r\nought to mean "he did not die or make any great sacrifice;" but "He\r\n_only_ lived but till he was a man" (_Macbeth_, v. 8. 40) means "He\r\nlived _only_ till he was a man." Compare also, "Who _only_ hath\r\nimmortality."\r\n\r\n_Only_ at the beginning of a statement = _but_. "I don\'t like to\r\nimportune you, _only_ I know you\'ll forgive me." Before an imperative\r\nit diminishes the favour asked: "_Only_ listen to me." This use of\r\n_only_ is mostly confined to letters.\r\n\r\nVery often, _only_ at the beginning of a sentence is used for _alone_:\r\n"_Only_ ten came," "_Only_ C\xc3\xa6sar approved." _Alone_ is less ambiguous.\r\nThe ambiguity of _only_ is illustrated by such a sentence as, "Don\'t\r\nhesitate to bring a few friends of yours to shoot on my estate at any\r\ntime. _Only_ five (fifteen) came yesterday," which might mean, "I\r\ndon\'t mind a _few_; _only_ don\'t bring so many as _fifteen_;" or else\r\n"Don\'t hesitate to bring a few _more_; no more than _five_ came\r\nyesterday." In conversation, ambiguity is prevented by emphasis; but\r\nin a letter, _only_ thus used might cause unfortunate mistakes. Write\r\n"Yesterday _only_ five came," if you mean "no more than five."\r\n\r\n\r\n*22. When "not only" precedes "but also," see that each is followed by\r\nthe same part of speech.*\r\n\r\n"He _not only_ gave me advice _but also_ help" is wrong. Write "He\r\ngave me, _not only_ advice, _but also_ help." On the other hand, "He\r\n_not only_ gave me a grammar, _but also_ lent me a dictionary," is\r\nright. Take an instance. "He spoke _not only_ forcibly _but also_\r\ntastefully (adverbs), and this too, _not only_ before a small\r\naudience, _but also_ in (prepositions) a large public meeting, and his\r\nspeeches were _not only_ successful, _but also_ (adjective) worthy of\r\nsuccess."\r\n\r\n\r\n*23. "At least," "always," and other adverbial adjuncts, sometimes\r\nproduce ambiguity.*\r\n\r\n"I think you will find my Latin exercise, _at all events_, as good as\r\nmy cousin\'s." Does this mean (1) "my Latin exercise, though not\r\nperhaps my other exercises;" or (2), "Though not very good, yet, at\r\nall events, as good as my cousin\'s"? Write for (1), "My Latin\r\nexercise, at all events, you will find &c." and for (2), "I think you\r\nwill find my Latin exercise as good as my cousin\'s, at all events."\r\n\r\nThe remedy is to avoid placing "at all events" between two emphatic\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nAs an example of the misplacing of an adverbial adjunct, take "From\r\nabroad he received most favourable reports, but in the City he heard\r\nthat a panic had broken out on the Exchange, and that the funds were\r\nfast falling." This ought to mean that the "hearing," and not (as is\r\nintended) that the "breaking out of the panic," took place in the\r\nCity.\r\n\r\nIn practice, an adverb is often used to qualify a remote word, where\r\nthe latter is _more emphatic than any nearer word_. This is very\r\ncommon when the Adverbial Adjunct is placed in an emphatic position at\r\nthe beginning of the sentence: "_On this very spot_ our guide declared\r\nthat Claverhouse had fallen."\r\n\r\n\r\n*24. Nouns should be placed near the nouns that they define.* In the\r\nvery common sentence "The death is announced of Mr. John Smith, an\r\nauthor whose works &c.," the transposition is probably made from a\r\nfeeling that, if we write "The death of Mr. John Smith is announced,"\r\nwe shall be obliged to begin a new sentence, "He was an author whose\r\nworks &c." But the difficulty can be removed by writing "We regret to\r\nannounce, or, we are informed of, the death of Mr. John Smith, an\r\nauthor, &c."\r\n\r\n\r\n*25. Pronouns should follow the nouns to which they refer without the\r\nintervention of another noun.* Avoid, "John Smith, the son of Thomas\r\nSmith, _who_ gave me this book," unless _Thomas Smith_ is the\r\nantecedent of _who_. Avoid also "John supplied Thomas with money: _he_\r\n(John) was very well off."\r\n\r\nWhen, however, one of two preceding nouns is decidedly superior to the\r\nother in emphasis, the more emphatic may be presumed to be the noun\r\nreferred to by the pronoun, even though the noun of inferior emphasis\r\nintervenes. Thus: "At this moment the colonel came up, and took the\r\nplace of the wounded general. _He_ gave orders to halt." Here _he_\r\nwould naturally refer to _colonel_, though _general_ intervenes. A\r\n_conjunction_ will often show that a pronoun refers to the subject of\r\nthe preceding sentence, and not to another intervening noun. "The\r\nsentinel at once took aim at the approaching soldier, and fired. He\r\n_then_ retreated to give the alarm."\r\n\r\nIt is better to adhere, in most cases, to Rule 25, which may be called\r\n(Bain) the Rule of Proximity. The Rule of Emphasis, of which an\r\ninstance was given in the last paragraph, is sometimes misleading. A\r\ndistinction might be drawn by punctuating thus:\r\n\r\n"David the father of Solomon, who slew Goliath." "David, the father of\r\nSolomon who built the Temple." But the propriety of omitting a comma\r\nin each case is questionable, and it is better to write so as not to\r\nbe at the mercy of commas.\r\n\r\n\r\n*26. Clauses that are grammatically connected should be kept as close\r\ntogether as possible.* (But see 55.) The introduction of parentheses\r\nviolating this rule often produced serious ambiguity. Thus, in the\r\nfollowing: "The result of these observations appears to be in\r\nopposition to the view now generally received in this country, that\r\nin muscular effort the substance of the muscle itself undergoes\r\ndisintegration." Here it is difficult to tell whether the theory of\r\n"disintegration" is (1) "the result," or, as the absence of a comma\r\nafter "be" would indicate, (2) "in opposition to the result of these\r\nobservations." If (1) is intended, add "and to prove" after "country;"\r\nif (2), insert "which is" after "country."\r\n\r\nThere is an excessive complication in the following:--"It cannot, at\r\nall events, if the consideration demanded by a subject of such\r\nimportance from any one professing to be a philosopher, be given, be\r\ndenied that &c."\r\n\r\nWhere a speaker feels that his hearers have forgotten the connection\r\nof the beginning of the sentence, he should repeat what he has said;\r\n_e.g._ after the long parenthesis in the last sentence he should\r\nrecommence, "it cannot, I say, be denied." In writing, however, this\r\nlicence must be sparingly used.\r\n\r\nA short parenthesis, or modifying clause, will not interfere with\r\nclearness, especially if antithesis he used, so as to show the\r\nconnection between the different parts of the sentence, _e.g._ "A\r\nmodern newspaper statement, _though probably true_, would be laughed\r\nat if quoted in a book as testimony; but the letter of a court gossip\r\nis thought good historical evidence if written some centuries ago."\r\nHere, to place "though probably true" at the beginning of the sentence\r\nwould not add clearness, and would impair the emphasis of the contrast\r\nbetween "a modern newspaper statement" and "the letter of a court\r\ngossip."\r\n\r\n\r\n*27. In conditional sentences, the antecedent clauses must be kept\r\ndistinct from the consequent clauses.*--There is ambiguity in "The\r\nlesson intended to be taught by these manoeuvres will be lost, if the\r\nplan of operations is laid down too definitely beforehand, and the\r\naffair degenerates into a mere review." Begin, in any case, with the\r\nantecedent, "If the plan," &c. Next write, according to the meaning:\r\n(1) "If the plan is laid down, and the affair degenerates &c., then\r\nthe lesson will be lost;" or (2) " ... then the lesson ... will be\r\nlost, and the affair degenerates into a mere review."\r\n\r\n\r\n*28. Dependent clauses preceded by "that" should be kept distinct from\r\nthose that are independent.*\r\n\r\nTake as an example:\r\n\r\n(1) "He replied that he wished to help them, and intended to make\r\npreparations accordingly."\r\n\r\nThis ought not to be used (though it sometimes is, for shortness) to\r\nmean:\r\n\r\n(2) "He replied ..., and he intended."\r\n\r\nIn (1), "intended," having no subject, must be supposed to be\r\nconnected with the nearest preceding verb, in the same mood and tense,\r\nthat has a subject, _i.e._ "wished." It follows that (1) is a\r\ncondensation of:\r\n\r\n(3) "He replied that he wished ..., and that he intended."\r\n\r\n(2), though theoretically free from ambiguity, is practically\r\nambiguous, owing to a loose habit of repeating the subject\r\nunnecessarily. It would be better to insert a conjunctional word or a\r\nfull stop between the two statements. Thus:\r\n\r\n(4) "He replied that he wished to help them, and _indeed_ he\r\nintended," &c., or "He replied, &c. He intended, &c."\r\n\r\nWhere there is any danger of ambiguity, use (3) or (4) in preference\r\nto (1) or (2).\r\n\r\n\r\n*29. When there are several infinitives, those that are dependent on\r\nthe same word must be kept distinct from those that are not.*\r\n\r\n"He said that he wished _to_ take his friend with him _to_ visit the\r\ncapital and _to_ study medicine." Here it is doubtful whether the\r\nmeaning is--\r\n\r\n"He said that he wished to take his friend with him,\r\n\r\n(1) _and also_ to visit the capital and study medicine," or\r\n\r\n(2) "that his friend might visit the capital _and might also_ study\r\nmedicine," or\r\n\r\n(3) "on a visit to the capital, _and that he also_ wished to study\r\nmedicine."\r\n\r\nFrom the three different versions it will be perceived that this\r\nambiguity must be met (_a_) by using "that" for "to," which allows us\r\nto repeat an auxiliary verb [_e.g._ "might" in (2)], and (_b_) by\r\ninserting conjunctions. As to insertions of conjunctions, see (37).\r\n\r\n"In order to," and "for the purpose of," can be used to distinguish\r\n(wherever there is any ambiguity) between an infinitive that\r\n_expresses a purpose_, and an infinitive that does not, _e.g._ "He\r\ntold his servant to call upon his friend, _to_ (in order to) give him\r\ninformation about the trains, and not to leave him till he started."\r\n\r\n\r\n*30. The principle of suspense.* Write your sentence in such a way\r\nthat, until he has come to the full stop, the reader may feel the\r\nsentence to be incomplete. In other words, keep your reader in\r\n_suspense_. _Suspense_ is caused (1) by placing the "if-clause" first,\r\nand not last, in a conditional sentence; (2) by placing participles\r\nbefore the words they qualify; (3) by using suspensive conjunctions,\r\n_e.g._ _not only_, _either_, _partly_, _on the one hand_, _in the\r\nfirst place_, &c.\r\n\r\nThe following is an example of an _unsuspended_ sentence. The sense\r\n_draggles_, and it is difficult to keep up one\'s attention.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Pym was looked upon as the man of greatest experience in\r\nparliaments, | where he had served very long, | and was always a man\r\nof business, | being an officer in the Exchequer, | and of a good\r\nreputation generally, | though known to be inclined to the Puritan\r\nparty; yet not of those furious resolutions (_Mod. Eng._ so furiously\r\nresolved) against the Church as the other leading men were, | and\r\nwholly devoted to the Earl of Bedford,--who had nothing of that\r\nspirit."\r\n\r\nThe foregoing sentence might have ended at any one of the eight points\r\nmarked above. When suspended it becomes:--\r\n\r\n"Mr. Pym, owing to his long service in Parliament in the Exchequer,\r\nwas esteemed above all others for his Parliamentary experience and for\r\nhis knowledge of business. He had also a good reputation generally;\r\nfor, though openly favouring the Puritan party, he was closely devoted\r\nto the Earl of Bedford, and, like the Earl, had none of the fanatical\r\nspirit manifested against the Church by the other leading men."\r\n\r\n*30 a. It is a violation of the principle of Suspense to introduce\r\nunexpectedly, at the end of a long sentence, some short and unemphatic\r\nclause beginning with (a) " ... not" or (b) " ... which."*\r\n\r\n(_a_) "This reform has already been highly beneficial to all classes\r\nof our countrymen, and will, I am persuaded, encourage among us\r\nindustry, self-dependence, and frugality, _and not, as some say,\r\nwastefulness_."\r\n\r\nWrite "not, as some say, wastefulness, but industry, self-dependence,\r\nand frugality."\r\n\r\n(_b_) "After a long and tedious journey, the last part of which was a\r\nlittle dangerous owing to the state of the roads, we arrived safely at\r\nYork, _which is a fine old town_."\r\n\r\n*Exception.*--When the short final clause is intended to be\r\nunexpectedly unemphatic, it comes in appropriately, with something of\r\nthe sting of an epigram. See (42). Thus:\r\n\r\n"The old miser said that he should have been delighted to give the\r\npoor fellow a shilling, but most unfortunately he had left his purse\r\nat home--_a habit of his_."\r\n\r\nSuspense naturally throws increased emphasis on the words for which we\r\nare waiting, _i.e._ on the end of the sentence. It has been pointed\r\nout above that *a monotony of final emphasis is objectionable,\r\nespecially in letter writing and conversation*.\r\n\r\n\r\n*31. Suspense must not be excessive.* _Excess of suspense_ is a common\r\nfault in boys translating from Latin. "Themistocles, having secured\r\nthe safety of Greece, the Persian fleet being now destroyed, when he\r\nhad unsuccessfully attempted to persuade the Greeks to break down the\r\nbridge across the Hellespont, hearing that Xerxes was in full flight,\r\nand thinking that it might be profitable to secure the friendship of\r\nthe king, wrote as follows to him." The more English idiom is: "When\r\nThemistocles had secured the safety of Greece by the destruction of\r\nthe Persian fleet, he made an unsuccessful attempt to persuade the\r\nGreeks to break down the bridge across the Hellespont. Soon\r\nafterwards, hearing &c."\r\n\r\nA long suspense that would be intolerable in prose is tolerable in the\r\nintroduction to a poem. See the long interval at the beginning of\r\n_Paradise Lost_ between "Of man\'s first disobedience" and "Sing,\r\nheavenly Muse." Compare also the beginning of _Paradise Lost_, Book\r\nII.:\r\n\r\n    "_High on a throne of royal state, which far\r\n    Outshone the wealth of Ormuz and of Ind,\r\n    Or where the gorgeous East with richest hand\r\n    Showers on her kings barbaric pearl and gold--\r\n    Satan exalted sat._"\r\n\r\nwith the opening of Keats\' _Hyperion_:\r\n\r\n    "_Deep in the shady sadness of a vale,\r\n    Far sunken from the healthy breath of morn,\r\n    Far from the fiery noon and eve\'s one star--\r\n    Sat grey-haired Saturn, quiet as a stone._"\r\n\r\n\r\n*32. In a long conditional sentence put the "if-clause," antecedent,\r\nor protasis, first.*\r\n\r\nEveryone will see the flatness of "Revenge thy father\'s most unnatural\r\nmurder, if thou didst ever love him," as compared with the suspense\r\nthat forces an expression of agony from Hamlet in--\r\n\r\n  "_Ghost._ If thou didst ever thy dear father love--\r\n  _Hamlet._ O, God!\r\n  _Ghost._ Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder."\r\n\r\nThe effect is sometimes almost ludicrous when the consequent is long\r\nand complicated, and when it precedes the antecedent or "if-clause."\r\n"I should be delighted to introduce you to my friends, and to show you\r\nthe objects of interest in our city, and the beautiful scenery in the\r\nneighbourhood, if you were here." Where the "if-clause" comes last, it\r\nought to be very emphatic: "if you were _only_ here."\r\n\r\nThe introduction of a clause with "if" or "though" in the middle of a\r\nsentence may often cause ambiguity, especially when a great part of\r\nthe sentence depends on "that:" "His enemies answered that, for the\r\nsake of preserving the public peace, they would keep quiet for the\r\npresent, though he declared that cowardice was the motive of the\r\ndelay, and that for this reason they would put off the trial to a more\r\nconvenient season." See (27).\r\n\r\n\r\n*33. Suspense[13] is gained by placing a Participle or Adjective that\r\nqualifies the Subject, before the Subject.*\r\n\r\n"_Deserted_ by his friends, he was forced to have recourse to those\r\nthat had been his enemies." Here, if we write, "He, deserted by his\r\nfriends, was forced &c.," _he_ is unduly emphasized; and if we write,\r\n"He was forced to have recourse to his enemies, having been deserted\r\nby his friends," the effect is very flat.\r\n\r\nOf course we might sometimes write "He was deserted and forced &c."\r\nBut this cannot be done where the "desertion" is to be not stated but\r\nimplied.\r\n\r\nOften, when a participle qualifying the subject is introduced late in\r\nthe sentence, it causes positive ambiguity: "With this small force the\r\ngeneral determined to attack the foe, _flushed_ with recent victory\r\nand _rendered_ negligent by success."\r\n\r\nAn excessive use of the _suspensive participle_ is French and\r\nobjectionable: _e.g._ "_Careless_ by nature, and too much _engaged_\r\nwith business to think of the morrow, _spoiled_ by a long-established\r\nliberty and a fabulous prosperity, _having_ for many generations\r\nforgotten the scourge of war, we allow ourselves to drift on without\r\ntaking heed of the signs of the times." The remedy is to convert the\r\nparticiple into a verb depending on a conjunction: "Because we are by\r\nnature careless, &c.;" or to convert the participle into a verb\r\nco-ordinate with the principal verb, _e.g._ "_We are_ by nature\r\ncareless, &c., and therefore we _allow_ ourselves, &c."\r\n\r\n\r\n*34. Suspensive Conjunctions, e.g. "either," "not only," "on the one\r\nhand," add clearness.*--Take the following sentence:--"You must take\r\nthis extremely perilous course, in which success is uncertain, and\r\nfailure disgraceful, as well as ruinous, or else the liberty of your\r\ncountry is endangered." Here, the meaning is liable to be\r\nmisunderstood, till the reader has gone half through the sentence.\r\nWrite "_Either_ you must," &c., and the reader is, from the first,\r\nprepared for an alternative. Other suspensive conjunctions or phrases\r\nare _partly_, _for our part_; _in the first place_; _it is true_;\r\n_doubtless_; _of course_; _though_; _on the one hand_.\r\n\r\n\r\n*35. Repeat the Subject when the omission would cause ambiguity or\r\nobscurity.*--The omission is particularly likely to cause obscurity\r\nafter a Relative standing as Subject:--\r\n\r\n"He professes to be helping the nation, which in reality is suffering\r\nfrom his flattery, and (he? or it?) will not permit anyone else to\r\ngive it advice."\r\n\r\nThe Relative should be repeated when it is the Subject of several\r\nVerbs. "All the pleasing illusions _which_ made power gentle and\r\nobedience liberal, _which_ harmonized the different shades of life,\r\nand _which_, by a bland assimilation, incorporated into politics the\r\nsentiments that beautify and soften private society, are to be\r\ndissolved by this new conquering empire of light and reason."\r\n\r\n\r\n*36. Repeat a Preposition after an intervening Conjunction, especially\r\nif a Verb and an Object also intervene.*\r\n\r\n"He forgets the gratitude that he owes to those that helped all his\r\ncompanions when he was poor and uninfluential, and (_to_) John Smith\r\nin particular." Here, omit _to_, and the meaning may be "that helped\r\nall his companions, and John Smith in particular." The intervention of\r\nthe verb and object, "helped" and "companions," causes this ambiguity.\r\n\r\n\r\n*37. When there are several Verbs at some distance from a Conjunction\r\non which they depend, repeat the Conjunction.*[14]\r\n\r\n"When we look back upon the havoc that two hundred years have made in\r\nthe ranks of our national authors--and, above all, (_when_) we refer\r\ntheir rapid disappearance to the quick succession of new\r\ncompetitors--we cannot help being dismayed at the prospect that lies\r\nbefore the writers of the present day."\r\n\r\nHere omit "when," and we at once substitute a parenthetical statement\r\nfor what is really a subordinate clause.\r\n\r\nIn reporting a speech or opinion, "that" must be continually repeated,\r\nto avoid the danger of confusing what the writer says with what others\r\nsay.\r\n\r\n"We might say that the C\xc3\xa6sars did not persecute the Christians;\r\n(_that_) they only punished men who were charged, rightly or wrongly,\r\nwith burning Rome, and committing the foulest abominations in secret\r\nassemblies; and (_that_) the refusal to throw frankincense on the\r\naltar of Jupiter was not the crime, but only evidence of the crime."\r\nBut see (6 _b_).\r\n\r\n*37 a. Repeat Verbs after the conjunctions "than," "as," &c.*\r\n\r\n"I think he likes me better _than_ you;" _i.e._ either "than you like\r\nme," or "he likes you."\r\n\r\n"Cardinal Richelieu hated Buckingham as sincerely as _did_ the\r\nSpaniard Olivares." Omit "did," and you cause ambiguity.\r\n\r\n*38. If the sentence is so long that it is difficult to keep the\r\nthread of meaning unbroken, repeat the subject, or some other emphatic\r\nword, or a summary of what has been said.*\r\n\r\n"Gold and cotton, banks and railways, crowded ports, and populous\r\ncities--_these_ are not the elements that constitute a great nation."\r\n\r\nThis repetition (though useful and, when used in moderation, not\r\nunpleasant) is more common with speakers than with writers, and with\r\nslovenly speakers than with good speakers.\r\n\r\n"The country is in such a condition, that if we delay longer some fair\r\nmeasure of reform, sufficient at least to satisfy the more moderate,\r\nand much more, if we refuse all reform whatsoever--I say, if _we adopt\r\nso unwise a policy, the country is in such a condition_ that we may\r\nprecipitate a revolution."\r\n\r\nWhere the relative is either implied (in a participle) or repeated,\r\nthe antecedent must often be repeated also. In the following sentence\r\nwe have the Subject repeated not only in the final summary, but also\r\nas the antecedent:--\r\n\r\n"But if there were, in any part of the world, a national church\r\nregarded as heretical by four-fifths of the nation committed to its\r\ncare; a _church_ established and maintained by the sword; a _church_\r\nproducing twice as many riots as conversions; a _church_ which, though\r\npossessing great wealth and power, and though long backed by\r\npersecuting laws, had, in the course of many generations, been found\r\nunable to propagate its doctrines, and barely able to maintain its\r\nground; a _church_ so odious that fraud and violence, when used\r\nagainst its clear rights of property, were generally regarded as fair\r\nplay; a _church_ whose ministers were preaching to desolate walls, and\r\nwith difficulty obtaining their lawful subsistence by the help of\r\nbayonets,--_such a church_, on our principles, could not, we must own,\r\nbe defended."\r\n\r\n\r\n*39. It is a help to clearness, when the first part of the sentence\r\nprepares the way for the middle and the middle for the end, in a kind\r\nof ascent. This ascent is called "climax."*\r\n\r\nIn the following there are two climaxes, each of which has three\r\nterms:--\r\n\r\n"To gossip(a) is a fault(b); to _libel_(a\'), a _crime_(b\'); to\r\nslander(a\'\'), a _sin_(b\'\')."\r\n\r\nIn the following, there are several climaxes, and note how they\r\ncontribute to the clearness of a long sentence:--\r\n\r\n"Man, working, has _contrived_(a) the Atlantic Cable, but I declare\r\nthat it _astonishes_(b) me far more to think _that for his mere\r\namusement_(c), that to _entertain a mere idle hour_(c\'), he has\r\n_created_(a\') \'Othello\' and \'Lear,\' and I am more than astonished, I\r\nam _awe-struck_(b\'), at that inexplicable elasticity of his nature\r\nwhich enables him, instead of _turning away_(d) from _calamity and\r\ngrief_(e), or instead of merely _defying_(d\') them, actually to _make\r\nthem the material of his amusement_(d\'\'), and to draw from the\r\n_wildest agonies of the human spirit_(e\') a pleasure which is not\r\nonly _not cruel_(f), but is in the highest degree _pure and\r\nennobling_(f\')."\r\n\r\nThe neglect of climax produces an abruptness that interferes with the\r\neven flow of thought. Thus, if Pope, in his ironical address to\r\nmankind, had written--\r\n\r\n    "Go, wondrous creature, mount where science guides;\r\n    Go, measure earth, weigh air, and state the tides;\r\n    Go, teach Eternal Wisdom how to rule"--\r\n\r\nthe ascent would have been too rapid. The transition from earth to\r\nheaven, and from investigating to governing, is prepared by the\r\nintervening climax--\r\n\r\n    "Instruct the planets in what orbs to run;\r\n    Correct old Time, and regulate the Sun;\r\n    Go, soar with Plato to th\' empyreal sphere,\r\n    To the first good, first perfect, and first fair."\r\n\r\n\r\n*40. When the thought is expected to ascend and yet descends,\r\nfeebleness and sometimes confusion is the result. The descent is\r\ncalled "bathos."*\r\n\r\n"What pen can describe the tears, the lamentations, the agonies, the\r\n_animated remonstrances_ of the unfortunate prisoners?"\r\n\r\n"She was a woman of many accomplishments and virtues, graceful in her\r\nmovements, winning in her address, a kind friend, a faithful and\r\nloving wife, a most affectionate mother, and she _played beautifully\r\non the pianoforte_."\r\n\r\nINTENTIONAL BATHOS has a humorous incongruity and abruptness that is\r\nsometimes forcible. For example, after the climax ending with the\r\nline--\r\n\r\n    "Go, teach Eternal Wisdom how to rule,"\r\n\r\nPope adds--\r\n\r\n    "Then drop into thyself, and be a _fool_."\r\n\r\n*40 a. A new construction should not be introduced without cause.*--A\r\nsudden and apparently unnecessary change of construction causes\r\nawkwardness and roughness at least, and sometimes breaks the flow of\r\nthe sentence so seriously as to cause perplexity. Thus, write\r\n"virtuous and accomplished," or "of many virtues and accomplishments,"\r\nnot "of many virtues and accomplished;" "riding or walking" or "on\r\nfoot or horseback," not "on foot or riding." In the same way, do not\r\nput adjectives and participles, active and passive forms of verbs, in\r\ntoo close juxtaposition. Avoid such sentences as the following:--\r\n\r\n"He had good reason _to believe_ that the delay was not _an accident_\r\n(accidental) but _premeditated_, and _for supposing_ (to suppose, or\r\nelse, for believing, above) that the fort, though strong both _by art_\r\nand _naturally_ (nature), would be forced by the _treachery of the_\r\ngovernor and the _indolent_ (indolence of the) general to capitulate\r\nwithin a week."\r\n\r\n"They accused him of being _bribed_ (receiving bribes from) by the\r\nking and _unwilling_ (neglecting) to take the city."\r\n\r\n\r\n*41. Antithesis adds force, and often clearness.*--The meaning of\r\n_liberal_ in the following sentence is ascertained by the\r\nantithesis:--\r\n\r\n"All the pleasing illusions which made _power_(a) _gentle_(b) and\r\n_obedience_(a\') _liberal_(b\') ... are now to be destroyed."\r\n\r\nThere is a kind of proportion. As _gentleness_ is to _power_, so\r\n_liberality_ (in the sense here used) is to _obedience_. Now\r\n_gentleness_ is the check on the excess of power; therefore _liberal_\r\nhere applies to that which checks the excess of obedience, _i.e._\r\nchecks servility. Hence _liberal_ here means "free."\r\n\r\nThe contrast also adds force. "They aimed at the _rule_(a), not at the\r\n_destruction_(a\'), of their country. They were men of great _civil_(b)\r\nand great _military_(b\') talents, and, if the _terror_(c), the\r\n_ornament_(c\') of their age."\r\n\r\nExcessive antithesis is unnatural and wearisome:--\r\n\r\n"Who can persuade where _treason_(a) is above _reason_(a\'), and\r\n_might_(b) ruleth _right_(b\'), and it is had for _lawful_(c)\r\nwhatsoever is _lustful_(c\'), and _commotioners_(d) are better than\r\n_commissioners_(d\'), and _common woe_(e) is named common\r\n_wealth_(e\')?"\r\n\r\n*42. Epigram.*--It has been seen that the neglect of climax results in\r\nlameness. Sometimes the suddenness of the descent produces amusement:\r\nand when the descent is intentional and very sudden, the effect is\r\nstriking as well as amusing. Thus:--\r\n\r\n(1) "You are not only not vicious, you are virtuous," is a _climax_.\r\n\r\n(2) "You are not vicious, you are vice," is not _climax_, nor is it\r\n_bathos_: it is _epigram_.[15]\r\n\r\nEpigram may be defined as a "short sentence expressing truth under an\r\namusing appearance of incongruity." It is often antithetical.\r\n\r\n  "The Russian grandees came to { and diamonds," _climax_.\r\n     court dropping pearls      { and vermin," _epigram_.\r\n\r\n  "These two nations were divided  { and the bitter remembrance\r\n     by mutual fear                { of recent losses," _climax_.\r\n                                   { and mountains," _epigram_.\r\n\r\nThere is a sort of implied antithesis in:--\r\n\r\n"He is full of information--(but flat also) like yesterday\'s _Times_."\r\n\r\n"Verbosity is cured (not by a small, but) by a large vocabulary."\r\n\r\nThe name of epigram may sometimes be given to a mere antithesis;\r\n_e.g._ "An educated man should know something of everything, and\r\neverything of something."\r\n\r\n\r\n*43. Let each sentence have one, and only one, principal subject of\r\nthought.*\r\n\r\n"This great and good man died on the 17th of September, 1683, leaving\r\nbehind him the memory of many noble actions, and a numerous family, of\r\nwhom three were sons; one of them, George, the eldest, heir to his\r\nfather\'s virtues, as well as to his principal estates in Cumberland,\r\nwhere most of his father\'s property was situate, and shortly\r\nafterwards elected member for the county, which had for several\r\ngenerations returned this family to serve in Parliament." Here we have\r\n(1) the "great and good man," (2) "George," (3) "the county,"\r\ndisputing which is to be considered the principal subject. Two, if not\r\nthree sentences should have been made, instead of one. Carefully avoid\r\na long sentence like this, treating of many different subjects on one\r\nlevel. It is called _heterogeneous_.\r\n\r\n\r\n*44. The connection between different sentences must be kept up by\r\nAdverbs used as Conjunctions, or by means of some other connecting\r\nwords at the beginning of each sentence.*--Leave out the conjunctions\r\nand other connecting words, and it will be seen that the following\r\nsentences lose much of their meaning:--\r\n\r\n"Pitt was in the army for a few months in time of peace. His\r\nbiographer (_accordingly_) insists on our confessing, that, if the\r\nyoung cornet had remained in the service, he would have been one of\r\nthe ablest commanders that ever lived. (_But_) this is not all. Pitt\r\n(, _it seems_,) was not merely a great poet _in esse_ and a great\r\ngeneral _in posse_, but a finished example of moral excellence....\r\n(_The truth is, that_) there scarcely ever lived a person who had so\r\nlittle claim to this sort of praise as Pitt. He was (_undoubtedly_) a\r\ngreat man. (_But_) his was not a complete and well-proportioned\r\ngreatness. The public life of Hampden or of Somers resembles a regular\r\ndrama which can be criticised as a whole, and every scene of which is\r\nto be viewed in connection with the main action. The public life of\r\nPitt (, _on the other hand_,) is," &c.\r\n\r\nThe following are some of the most common connecting adverbs, or\r\nconnecting phrases: (1) expressing consequence, similarity,\r\nrepetition, or resumption of a subject--_accordingly_, _therefore_,\r\n_then_, _naturally_, _so that_, _thus_, _in this way_, _again_, _once\r\nmore_, _to resume_, _to continue_, _to sum up_, _in fact_, _upon\r\nthis_; (2) expressing opposition--_nevertheless_, _in spite of this_,\r\n_yet_, _still_, _however_, _but_, _on the contrary_, _on the other\r\nhand_; (3) expressing suspension--_undoubtedly ... but_; _indeed ...\r\nyet_; _on the one hand ... on the other_; _partly ... partly_; _some\r\n... others_.\r\n\r\nAvoid a style like that of Bishop Burnet, which strings together a\r\nnumber of sentences with "and" or "so," or with no conjunction at all:\r\n\r\n"Blake with the fleet happened to be at Malaga, before he made war\r\nupon Spain; _and_ some of his seamen went ashore, _and_ met the Host\r\ncarried about; _and_ not only paid no respect to it, but laughed at\r\nthose who did." Write "_When_ Blake &c."\r\n\r\n\r\n*45. The connection between two long sentences sometimes requires a\r\nshort intervening sentence, showing the transition of thought.*\r\n\r\n"Without force or opposition, it (chivalry) subdued the fierceness of\r\npride and power; it obliged sovereigns to submit to the soft\r\ncollar[16] of social esteem, compelled stern authority to submit to\r\nelegance, and gave a dominating vanquisher of laws to be subdued by\r\nmanners. But now (_all is to be changed_:) all the pleasing illusions\r\nwhich made power gentle and obedience liberal, which harmonized the\r\ndifferent shades of life, and which, by a bland assimilation,\r\nincorporated into politics the sentiments that beautify and soften\r\nprivate society, are to be dissolved by this new conquering empire of\r\nlight and reason." If the words italicized were omitted, the\r\ntransition would be too abrupt: the conjunction _but_ alone would be\r\ninsufficient.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[5] _For_, at the beginning of a sentence, sometimes causes temporary\r\ndoubt, while the reader is finding out whether it is used as a\r\nconjunction or preposition.\r\n\r\n[6] _It_ should refer (1) either to the Noun immediately preceding, or\r\n(2) to some Noun superior to all intervening Nouns in emphasis. See\r\n(25).\r\n\r\n[7] So useful that, on mature consideration, I am disposed to adopt\r\n"that" here and in several of the following exceptional cases.\r\n\r\n[8] Of course "and which" may be used where "which" precedes.\r\n\r\n[9] "That which," where _that_ is an _object_, _e.g._ "then (set\r\nforth) _that which_ is worse," _St. John_ ii. 10, is rare in modern\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\n[10] Sometimes the emphatic Adverb comes at the beginning, and causes\r\nthe transposition of an Auxiliary Verb, "_Gladly_ do I consent."\r\n\r\n[11] Of course punctuation will remove the ambiguity; but it is better\r\nto express oneself clearly, as far as possible, independently of\r\npunctuation.\r\n\r\n[12] Professor Bain.\r\n\r\n[13] See (30).\r\n\r\n[14] The repetition of Auxiliary Verbs and Pronominal Adjectives is\r\nalso conducive to clearness.\r\n\r\n[15] Professor Bain says: "In the epigram the mind is roused by a\r\nconflict or contradiction between the form of the language and the\r\nmeaning really conveyed."\r\n\r\n[16] This metaphor is not recommended for imitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nBREVITY.\r\n\r\n*46. Metaphor is briefer than literal statement.* See (13).\r\n\r\n"The cares and responsibilities of a sovereign often disturb his\r\nsleep," is not so brief as "Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown,"\r\nwhere the effect of care on the mind is assimilated to the effect of a\r\nheavy crown pressing on the head.\r\n\r\n\r\n*47. General terms are briefer, though less forcible, than particular\r\nterms.* Thus: "He devours _literature_, no matter of what kind," is\r\nshorter than, "Novels or sermons, poems or histories, no matter what,\r\nhe devours them all."\r\n\r\n*47 a. A phrase may be expressed by a word.*\r\n\r\n"These impressions _can never be forgotten_, i.e. are _indelible_."\r\n\r\n"The style of this book is _of such a nature that it cannot be\r\nunderstood_, i.e. _unintelligible_."\r\n\r\nThe words "of such a nature that" are often unnecessarily inserted.\r\nSee the extract from Sir Archibald Alison.\r\n\r\n\r\n*48. Participles can often be used as brief (though sometimes\r\nambiguous) equivalents of phrases containing Conjunctions and Verbs.*\r\n\r\n"Hearing (when he heard) this, he advanced." See (7) for more\r\ninstances. So "phrases _containing_ conjunctions" means "phrases _that\r\ncontain_ conjunctions." "_This done_, (for, _when this was done_) he\r\nretired."\r\n\r\nSometimes the participle "being" is omitted. "France at our doors, he\r\nsees no danger nigh," for "France being" or "though France is."\r\n\r\n\r\n*49. Participles and participial adjectives may be used like\r\nAdjectives, as equivalents for phrases containing the Relative.*\r\n\r\n"The never-_ceasing_ wind," "the _clamouring_ ocean," "the _drenching_\r\nrain," are instances. The licence of inventing participial adjectives\r\nby adding _-ing_ to a noun, is almost restricted to poetry. You could\r\nnot write "the _crannying_ wind" in prose.\r\n\r\n\r\n*50. A statement may sometimes be briefly implied instead of being\r\nexpressed at length.* Thus, instead of "The spirit of Christianity was\r\nhumanizing, and therefore &c.," or "Christianity, since it was (or\r\nbeing) of a humanizing spirit, discouraged &c.," we can write more\r\nbriefly and effectively, "Gladiatorial shows were first discouraged,\r\nand finally put down, by the _humanizing spirit of Christianity_." So\r\ninstead of "The nature of youth is thoughtless and sanguine, and\r\ntherefore &c.," we can write, "The danger of the voyage was\r\ndepreciated and the beauty of the island exaggerated by _the\r\nthoughtless nature of youth_."\r\n\r\nSometimes a mere name or epithet implies a statement. "It was in vain\r\nthat he offered the Swiss terms: war was deliberately preferred by the\r\n_hardy mountaineers_," _i.e._ "by the Swiss, _because they were\r\nmountaineers and hardy_." "The deed was applauded by all honest men,\r\nbut the Government affected to treat it as murder, and set a price\r\nupon the head of (him whom they called) the _assassin." "The conqueror\r\nof Austerlitz_ might be expected to hold different language from _the\r\nprisoner of St. Helena_," _i.e._ "Napoleon when elated by the victory\r\nof Austerlitz," and "Napoleon when depressed by his imprisonment at\r\nSt. Helena."\r\n\r\nCAUTION.--Different names must not be used for the same person unless\r\neach of them derives an appropriateness from its context. Thus, if we\r\nare writing about Charles II., it would be in very bad taste to avoid\r\nrepeating "he" by using such periphrases as the following: "The third\r\nof the Stewarts hated business," "the Merry Monarch died in the\r\nfifty-fourth year of his age," &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n*51. Conjunctions may be omitted.* The omission gives a certain\r\nforcible abruptness, _e.g._ "You say this: I (on the other hand) deny\r\nit."\r\n\r\nWhen sentences are short, as in Macaulay\'s writings, conjunctions may\r\nbe advantageously omitted.\r\n\r\nWhere a contrast is intended, the conjunction _but_ usually prepares\r\nthe way for the second of the two contrasted terms: "He is good _but_\r\ndull." Where _and_ is used instead of _but_, the incongruity savours\r\nof epigram: "He always talks truthfully _and_ prosily." "He is always\r\namusing _and_ false."\r\n\r\n*51 a. The Imperative Mood may be used for "if."*\r\n\r\n"_Strip_ (for, _if you strip_) Virtue of the awful authority she\r\nderives from the general reverence of mankind, and you rob her of half\r\nher majesty."\r\n\r\n\r\n*52. Apposition may be used so as to convert two sentences into one.*\r\n\r\n"We called at the house of a person to whom we had letters of\r\nintroduction, _a musician_, and, what is more, a _good friend_ to all\r\nyoung students of music." This is as clear as, and briefer than, "He\r\nwas a musician, &c."\r\n\r\n\r\n*53. Condensation may be effected by not repeating (1) the common\r\nsubject of several verbs, (2) the common object of several verbs or\r\nprepositions.*\r\n\r\n(1) "He resided here for many years, and, after he had won the esteem\r\nof all the citizens, (_he_) died," &c. So, (2) "He came to, and was\r\ninduced to reside in, this city," is shorter than "He came to this\r\ncity, and was induced to reside in it."\r\n\r\nSuch condensation often causes obscurity, and, even where there is no\r\nobscurity, there is a certain harshness in pausing on light,\r\nunemphatic words, such as _to_, _in_, &c., as in the first example.\r\n\r\n\r\n*54. Tautology.*--The fault of repeating the same word several times\r\nunnecessarily is called _tautology_, e.g.:\r\n\r\n"This is a painful _circumstance_; it is a _circumstance_ that I much\r\n_regret_, and he also will much _regret_ the _circumstance_." But the\r\nfault is not to be avoided by using different words to mean the same\r\nthing, as, "This is a painful _event_; it is a _circumstance_ that I\r\n_much regret_, and he also will _greatly lament_ the _occurrence_."\r\nThe true remedy is to arrange the words in such a manner that there\r\nmay be no unnecessary repetition, thus: "This is a painful\r\ncircumstance, a circumstance that causes me, and will cause him, deep\r\nregret."\r\n\r\nThe repetition of the same meaning in slightly different words is a\r\nworse fault than the repetition of the same word. See, for examples,\r\nthe extract from Sir Archibald Alison, at the end of the book. Thus\r\n"_A burning thirst_ for conquests is a characteristic of this nation.\r\nIt is an _ardent passion_ that &c." Other instances are--"The\r\n_universal_ opinion of _all_ men;" "His judgment is so _infallible_\r\nthat it is _never deceived_," &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n*55. Parenthesis may be used with advantage to brevity.*\r\n\r\n"We are all (and who would not be?) offended at the treatment we have\r\nreceived," is shorter and more forcible than the sentence would have\r\nbeen if the parenthesis had been appended in a separate sentence:\r\n"Who, indeed, would not be offended?"\r\n\r\nExtreme care must, however, be taken that a parenthesis may not\r\nobscure the meaning of a long sentence.\r\n\r\n*56. Caution: let clearness be the first consideration.* It is best,\r\nat all events for beginners, not to aim so much at being brief, or\r\nforcible, as at being perfectly clear. Horace says, "While I take\r\npains to be brief, I fall into obscurity," and it may easily be seen\r\nthat several of the rules for brevity interfere with the rules for\r\nclearness.\r\n\r\nForcible style springs from (1) vividness and (2) exactness of\r\nthought, and from a corresponding (1) vividness and (2) exactness in\r\nthe use of words.\r\n\r\n(1) When you are describing anything, endeavour to _see_ it and\r\ndescribe it as you see it. If you are writing about a man who was\r\nkilled, _see_ the man before you, and ask, was he _executed_, _cut\r\ndown_, _run through the body_, _butchered_, _shot_, or _hanged_? If\r\nyou are writing about the capture of a city, was the city _stormed_,\r\n_surprised_, _surrendered_, _starved out_, or _demolished before\r\nsurrender_? Was an army _repelled_, _defeated_, _routed_, _crushed_,\r\nor _annihilated_?\r\n\r\n(2) Exactness in the use of words requires an exact knowledge of their\r\nmeanings and differences. This is a study by itself, and cannot be\r\ndiscussed here.[17]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[17] See _English Lessons for English People_, pp. 1-53.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISES\r\n\r\n\r\n_For an explanation of the manner in which these Exercises are\r\nintended to be used, see the Preface._\r\n\r\n_A number in brackets by itself, or followed by a letter,_ e.g. _(43),\r\n(40 a), refers to the Rules._\r\n\r\n_Letters_ by themselves _in brackets_, e.g. _(b), refer to the\r\nexplanations or hints appended to each sentence._\r\n\r\n_N.B..--(10 a) refers to the first section of Rule (10); (10 a\') to\r\nthe Rule following Rule (10)._\r\n\r\n1.

The modernized version will necessarily be inferior to the\r\noriginal in unity of style, and in some other respects. The charm of\r\nthe author\'s individuality, and the pleasant ring of the old-fashioned\r\nEnglish, are lost. It is highly necessary that the student should\r\nrecognize this, and should bear in mind that the sole object is to\r\nshow how the meaning in each case might have been more _clearly_\r\nexpressed.\r\n\r\nOccasionally expressions have been altered, not as being in themselves\r\nobscure or objectionable, but as indicating a habit of which beginners\r\nshould beware. For example, in the extract from Burnet, _he_ is often\r\naltered, not because, in the particular context, the pronoun presents\r\nany obscurity, but because Burnet\'s habit of repeating _he_ is faulty.\r\n\r\nThese exercises can be used in two ways. The pupil may either have his\r\nbook open and be questioned on the reasons for each alteration, or,\r\nafter studying the two versions, he may have the original version\r\ndictated to him, and then he may reproduce the parallel version, or\r\nsomething like it, on paper.\r\n\r\n                         LORD CLARENDON.\r\n\r\nThe principal faults in this style are, long heterogeneous sentences\r\n(43), use of phrases for words (47 _a_), ambiguous use of pronouns\r\n(5), excessive separation of words grammatically connected together\r\n(19).\r\n\r\n        ORIGINAL VERSION.

A man\r\n  state, and (40 _a_) _life so_       might as reasonably assert that we\r\n  completely (40 _a_) _happy_, that   are so entirely at ease and so\r\n  (5) _it_ is a contradiction to      completely happy in this present\r\n  suppose (40 _a_) our condition      life that our condition cannot\r\n  capable of _being in any respect_   without contradiction be supposed\r\n  (47 _a_) _better_.--(_Analogy of    capable of being in any way\r\n  Religion_, part ii. chap. 1.)       improved.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[33] "To pretend" once meant "to put forward," "maintain."\r\n\r\n[34] It has been suggested, however, that by "in its very notion\r\nincredible," is meant "inconceivable."\r\n\r\n[35] "Wanting" is used for modern "wanted."\r\n\r\n[36] This use of the particular for the general would be out of place\r\nin Butler\'s style, but it adds clearness.\r\n\r\n\r\nBREVITY.\r\n\r\n                         SIR ARCHIBALD ALISON.\r\n\r\nThe following extract exhibits examples of tautology and lengthiness.\r\nThe "implied statement" (50) can often be used as a remedy, but, more\r\noften, the best remedy is omission.\r\n\r\n       ORIGINAL VERSION.

G. F. W. MORTIMER, D.D.,\r\n\r\n_Prebendary of St. Paul\'s Cathedral, late Head Master of the City of\r\nLondon School_.\r\n\r\nDEAR DOCTOR MORTIMER,\r\n\r\nWe have other motives, beside the respect and gratitude which must be\r\nfelt for you by all those of your old pupils who are capable of\r\nappreciating the work you did at the City of London School, for asking\r\nyou to let us dedicate to you a little book which we have entitled\r\n"English Lessons for English People."\r\n\r\nLooking back upon our school life, we both feel that among the many\r\neducational advantages which we enjoyed under your care, there was\r\nnone more important than the study of the works of Shakspeare, to\r\nwhich we and our school-fellows were stimulated by the special prizes\r\nof the Beaufoy Endowment.\r\n\r\nWe owe you a debt of gratitude not always owed by pupils to their\r\nteachers. Many who have passed into a life of engrossing activity\r\nwithout having been taught at school to use rightly, or to appreciate\r\nthe right use of, their native tongue, feeling themselves foreigners\r\namid the language of their country, may turn with some point against\r\ntheir teachers the reproach of banished Bolingbroke:--\r\n\r\n            My tongue\'s use is to me no more\r\n    Than an unstringed viol or a harp,\r\n    Or like a cunning instrument cased up,\r\n    Or, being open, put into his hands\r\n    That knows no touch to tune the harmony;\r\n    Within my mouth you have engaoled my tongue,\r\n    Doubly portcullis\'d with my teeth and lips,\r\n    And dull, unfeeling, barren ignorance\r\n    Is made my gaoler to attend on me.\r\n    I am too old to fawn upon a nurse,\r\n    Too far in years to be a pupil now.\r\n\r\nIt is our pleasant duty, on the contrary, to thank you for encouraging\r\nus to study the "cunning instrument" of our native tongue.\r\n\r\nOur sense of the benefits which we derived from this study, and our\r\nrecollection that the study was at that time optional, and did not\r\naffect more than a small number of the pupils, lead us to anticipate\r\nthat when once the English language and literature become recognized,\r\nnot as an optional but as a regular part of our educational course,\r\nthe advantages will be so great as to constitute nothing short of a\r\nnational benefit.\r\n\r\nThe present seems to be a critical moment for English instruction. The\r\nsubject has excited much attention of late years; many schools have\r\nalready taken it up; others are on the point of doing so; it forms an\r\nimportant part of most Government and other examinations. But there is\r\na complaint from many teachers that they cannot teach English for want\r\nof text-books and manuals; and, as the study of English becomes year\r\nby year more general, this complaint makes itself more and more\r\ndistinctly heard. To meet this want we have written the following\r\npages. If we had had more time, we might perhaps have been tempted to\r\naim at producing a more learned and exhaustive book on the subject;\r\nbut, setting aside want of leisure, we feel that a practical\r\ntext-book, and not a learned or exhaustive treatise, is what is wanted\r\nat the present crisis.\r\n\r\nWe feel sure that you will give a kindly welcome to our little book,\r\nas an attempt, however imperfect, to hand on the torch which you have\r\nhanded to us; we beg you also to accept it as a token of our sincere\r\ngratitude for more than ordinary kindnesses, and to believe us\r\n\r\n  Your affectionate pupils,\r\n\r\n                 J.

Price $1.50.\r\n\r\n_From the London Athen\xc3\xa6um._\r\n\r\n     The object of this book is evidently a practical one. It is\r\n     intended for ordinary use by a large circle of readers; and\r\n     though designed principally for boys, may be read with advantage\r\n     by many of more advanced years. One of the lessons which it\r\n     professes to teach, "to use the right word in the right place,"\r\n     is one which no one should despise. The accomplishment is a rare\r\n     one, and many of the hints here given are truly admirable.\r\n\r\n_From the Southern Review._\r\n\r\n     The study of Language can never be exhausted. Every time it is\r\n     looked at by a man of real ability and culture, some new phase\r\n     starts into view. The origin of Language; its relations to the\r\n     mind; its history; its laws; its development; its struggles; its\r\n     triumphs; its devices; its puzzles; its ethics,--every thing\r\n     about it is full of interest.\r\n\r\n     Here is a delightful book, by two men of recognized\r\n     authority,--the head Master of London School, and the Professor\r\n     of Modern History in the University of Cambridge, the notable\r\n     author of "Ecce Homo." The book is so comprehensive in its scope\r\n     that it seems almost miscellaneous. It treats of the vocabulary\r\n     of the English Language; Diction as appropriate to this or that\r\n     sort of composition; selection and arguments of topics; Metre,\r\n     and an Appendix on Logic. All this in less than three hundred\r\n     pages. Within this space so many subjects cannot be treated\r\n     exhaustively; and no one is, unless we may except Metre, to which\r\n     about eighty pages are devoted, and about which all seems to be\r\n     said that is worth saying,--possibly more. But on each topic some\r\n     of the best things are said in a very stimulating way. The\r\n     student will desire to study more thoroughly the subject into\r\n     which such pleasant openings are here given; and the best\r\n     prepared teacher will be thankful for the number of striking\r\n     illustrations gathered up to his hand.\r\n\r\n     The abundance and freshness of the quotations makes the volume\r\n     very attractive reading, without reference to its didactic value.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sold by all booksellers. Mailed, postpaid, by the Publishers_,\r\n\r\nROBERTS BROTHERS, BOSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis book is not intended to supply the place of an English Grammar.\r\nIt presupposes a knowledge of Grammar and of English idiom in its\r\nreaders, and does not address itself to foreigners, but to those who,\r\nhaving already a familiar knowledge of English, need help to write it\r\nwith taste and exactness. Some degree of knowledge is presumed in the\r\nreader; nevertheless we do not presume that he possesses so much as to\r\nrender him incapable of profiting from _lessons_. Our object is, if\r\npossible, not merely to interest, but to _teach_; to write lessons,\r\nnot essays,--lessons that may perhaps prove interesting to some who\r\nhave passed beyond the routine of school life, but still lessons, in\r\nthe strictest sense, adapted for school classes.\r\n\r\nAiming at practical utility, the book deals only with those\r\ndifficulties which, in the course of teaching, we have found to be\r\nmost common and most serious. For there are many difficulties, even\r\nwhen grammatical accuracy has been attained, in the way of English\r\npersons attempting to write and speak correctly. First, there is the\r\ncramping restriction of an insufficient vocabulary; not merely a loose\r\nand inexact apprehension of many words that are commonly used, and a\r\nconsequent difficulty in using them accurately, but also a total\r\nignorance of many other words, and an inability to use them at all;\r\nand these last are, as a rule, the very words which are absolutely\r\nnecessary for the comprehension and expression of any thought that\r\ndeals with something more than the most ordinary concrete notions.\r\nThere is also a very common inability to appreciate the differences\r\nbetween words that are at all similar. Lastly, where the pupil has\r\nstudied Latin, and trusts too much for his knowledge of English words\r\nto his knowledge of their Latin roots, there is the possibility of\r\nmisderiving and misunderstanding a word, owing to ignorance of the\r\nchanges of letters introduced in the process of derivation; and, on\r\nthe other hand, there is the danger of misunderstanding and\r\npedantically misusing words correctly derived, from an ignorance of\r\nthe changes of meaning which a word almost always experiences in\r\npassing from one language to another. The result of all this\r\nnon-understanding or slovenly half-understanding of words is a habit\r\nof slovenly reading and slovenly writing, which when once acquired is\r\nvery hard to shake off.\r\n\r\nThen, following on the difficulties attending the use of words, there\r\nare others attending the choice and arrangement of words. There is the\r\ndanger of falling into "poetic prose," of thinking it necessary to\r\nwrite "steed" or "charger" instead of "horse," "ire" instead of\r\n"anger," and the like; and every teacher, who has had much experience\r\nin looking over examination papers, will admit that this is a danger\r\nto which beginners are very liable. Again, there is the temptation to\r\nshrink with a senseless fear from using a plain word twice in the same\r\npage, and often from using a plain word at all. This unmanly dread of\r\nsimplicity, and of what is called "tautology," gives rise to a\r\npatchwork made up of scraps of poetic quotations, unmeaning\r\nperiphrases, and would-be humorous circumlocutions,--a style of all\r\nstyles perhaps the most objectionable and offensive, which may be\r\nknown and avoided by the name of _Fine Writing_. Lastly, there is the\r\ndanger of _obscurity_, a fault which cannot be avoided without extreme\r\ncare, owing to the uninflected nature of our language.\r\n\r\nAll these difficulties and dangers are quite as real, and require as\r\nmuch attention, and are fit subjects for practical teaching in our\r\nschools, quite as much as many points which, at present, receive\r\nperhaps an excessive attention in some of our text-books. To use the\r\nright word in the right place is an accomplishment not less valuable\r\nthan the knowledge of the truth (carefully recorded in most English\r\nGrammars, and often inflicted as a task upon younger pupils) that the\r\nplural of _cherub_ is _cherubim_, and the feminine of _bull_ is _cow_.\r\n\r\nTo smooth the reader\'s way through these difficulties is the object of\r\nthe first three Parts of this book. Difficulties connected with\r\nVocabulary are considered first. The student is introduced, almost at\r\nonce, to _Synonyms_. He is taught how to _define_ a word, with and\r\nwithout the aid of its synonyms. He is shown how to _eliminate_ from a\r\nword whatever is not essential to its meaning. The processes of\r\n_Definition_ and _Elimination_ are carefully explained: a system or\r\nscheme is laid down which he can exactly follow; and examples are\r\nsubjoined, worked out to illustrate the method which he is to pursue.\r\nA system is also given by which the reader may enlarge his vocabulary,\r\nand furnish himself easily and naturally with those general or\r\nabstract terms which are often misunderstood and misused, and still\r\nmore often not understood and not used at all. Some information is\r\nalso given to help the reader to connect words with their roots, and\r\nat the same time to caution him against supposing that, because he\r\nknows the roots of a word, he necessarily knows the meaning of the\r\nword itself. Exercises are interspersed throughout this Part which can\r\nbe worked out with, or without, an English Etymological\r\nDictionary,[44] as the nature of the case may require. The exercises\r\nhave not been selected at random; many of them have been subjected to\r\nthe practical test of experience, and have been used in class\r\nteaching.\r\n\r\nThe Second Part deals with Diction. It attempts to illustrate with\r\nsome detail the distinction--often ignored by those who are beginning\r\nto write English, and sometimes by others also--between the Diction of\r\nProse, and that of Poetry. It endeavors to dissipate that excessive\r\nand vulgar dread of tautology which, together with a fondness for\r\nmisplaced pleasantry, gives rise to the vicious style described above.\r\nIt gives some practical rules for writing a long sentence clearly and\r\nimpressively; and it also examines the difference between slang,\r\nconversation, and written prose. Both for translating from foreign\r\nlanguages into English, and for writing original English composition,\r\nthese rules have been used in teaching, and, we venture to think, with\r\nencouraging results.\r\n\r\nA Chapter on Simile and Metaphor concludes the subject of Diction. We\r\nhave found, in the course of teaching, that a great deal of confusion\r\nin speaking and writing, and still more in reading and attempting to\r\nunderstand the works of our classical English authors, arises from the\r\ninability to express the literal meaning conveyed in a Metaphor. The\r\napplication of the principle of Proportion to the explanation of\r\nMetaphor has been found to dissipate much of this confusion. The\r\nyoungest pupils readily learn how to "expand a Metaphor into its\r\nSimile;" and it is really astonishing to see how many difficulties\r\nthat perplex young heads, and sometimes old ones too, vanish at once\r\nwhen the key of "expansion" is applied. More important still, perhaps,\r\nis the exactness of thought introduced by this method. The pupil knows\r\nthat, if he cannot expand a metaphor, he does not understand it. All\r\nteachers will admit that to force a pupil to see that he does not\r\nunderstand any thing is a great stride of progress. It is difficult\r\nto exaggerate the value of a process which makes it impossible for a\r\npupil to delude himself into the belief that he understands when he\r\ndoes not understand.\r\n\r\nMetre is the subject of the Third Part. The object of this Part (as\r\nalso, in a great measure, of the Chapter just mentioned belonging to\r\nthe Second Part) is to enable the pupil to read English Poetry with\r\nintelligence, interest, and appreciation. To teach any one how to read\r\na verse so as to mark the metre on the one hand, without on the other\r\nhand converting the metrical line into a monotonous doggerel, is not\r\nso easy a task as might be supposed. Many of the rules stated in this\r\nPart have been found of practical utility in teaching pupils to hit\r\nthe mean. Rules and illustrations have therefore been given, and the\r\ndifferent kinds of metre and varieties of the same metre have been\r\nexplained at considerable length.\r\n\r\nThis Chapter may seem to some to enter rather too much into detail. We\r\ndesire, however, to urge as an explanation, that in all probability\r\nthe study of English metre will rapidly assume more importance in\r\nEnglish schools. At present, very little is generally taught, and\r\nperhaps known, about this subject. In a recent elaborate edition of\r\nthe works of Pope, the skill of that consummate master of the art of\r\nepigrammatic versification is impugned because in one of his lines he\r\nsuffers _the_ to receive the metrical accent. When one of the\r\ncommonest customs (for it is in no sense a license) of English\r\npoets--a custom sanctioned by Shakspeare, Dryden, Milton, Wordsworth,\r\nByron, Shelley, and Tennyson--can be censured as a fault, and this in\r\na leading edition of a leading poet of our literature, it must be\r\nevident that much still remains to be done in teaching English Metre.\r\nAt present this Part may seem too detailed. Probably, some few years\r\nhence, when a knowledge of English Metre has become more widely\r\ndiffused, it will seem not detailed enough.\r\n\r\nThe Fourth Part (like the Chapter on Metaphor) is concerned not more\r\nwith English than with other languages. It treats of the different\r\nStyles of Composition, the appropriate subjects for each, and the\r\narrangement of the subject-matter. We hope that this may be of some\r\ninterest to the general reader, as well as of practical utility in the\r\nhigher classes of schools. It seems desirable that before pupils begin\r\nto write essays, imaginary dialogues, speeches, and poems, they should\r\nreceive some instruction as to the difference of arrangement in a\r\npoem, a speech, a conversation, and an essay.\r\n\r\nAn Appendix adds a few hints on some Errors in Reasoning. This\r\naddition may interfere with the symmetry of the book; but if it is\r\nfound of use, the utility will be ample compensation. In reading\r\nliterature, pupils are continually meeting instances of false\r\nreasoning, which, if passed over without comment, do harm, and, if\r\ncommented upon, require some little basis of knowledge in the pupil to\r\nenable him to understand the explanation. Without entering into the\r\ndetails of formal Logic, we have found it possible to give pupils some\r\nfew hints which have appeared to help them. The hints are so\r\nelementary, and so few, that they cannot possibly delude the youngest\r\nreader into imagining that they are any thing more than hints. They\r\nmay induce him hereafter to study the subject thoroughly in a complete\r\ntreatise, when he has leisure and opportunity; but, in any case, a boy\r\nwill leave school all the better prepared for the work of life,\r\nwhatever that work may be, if he knows the meaning of _induction_, and\r\nhas been cautioned against the error, _post hoc, ergo propter hoc_. No\r\nlesson, so far as our experience in teaching goes, interests and\r\nstimulates pupils more than this; and our experience of debating\r\nsocieties, in the higher forms of schools, forces upon us the\r\nconviction that such lessons are not more interesting than necessary.\r\n\r\nQuestions on the different paragraphs have been added at the end of\r\nthe book, for the purpose of enabling the student to test his\r\nknowledge of the contents, and also to serve as home lessons to be\r\nprepared by pupils in classes.[45]\r\n\r\nA desire, expressed by some teachers of experience, that these lessons\r\nshould be published as soon as possible, has rather accelerated the\r\npublication. Some misprints and other inaccuracies may possibly be\r\nfound in the following pages, in consequence of the short time Which\r\nhas been allowed us for correcting them. Our thanks are due to several\r\nfriends who have kindly assisted us in this task, and who have also\r\naided us with many valuable and practical suggestions. Among these we\r\ndesire to mention Mr. Joseph Payne, whose labors on Norman French are\r\nwell known; Mr. T.G. Philpotts, late Fellow of New College, Oxford,\r\nand one of the Assistant Masters of Rugby School; Mr. Edwin Abbott,\r\nHead Master of the Philological School; Mr. Howard Candler,\r\nMathematical Master of Uppingham School; and the Rev. R. H. Quick, one\r\nof the Assistant Masters of Harrow School.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we repeat that we do not wish our book to be regarded\r\nas an exhaustive treatise, or as adapted for the use of foreigners. It\r\nis intended primarily for boys, but, in the present unsatisfactory\r\nstate of English education, we entertain a hope that it may possibly\r\nbe found not unfit for some who have passed the age of boyhood; and in\r\nthis hope we have ventured to give it the title of _English Lessons\r\nfor English People_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[44] An Etymological Dictionary is necessary for pupils studying the\r\nFirst Part. Chambers\'s or Ogilvie\'s will answer the purpose.\r\n\r\n[45] Some of the passages quoted to illustrate style are intended to\r\nbe committed to memory and used as repetition-lessons.--See pp. 180,\r\n181, 212, 237, 238, etc.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nON THE RIGHT USE OF BOOKS.\r\n\r\nA LECTURE.

It is the\r\n     easiest thing in the world to waste time over books, which are\r\n     merely tools of knowledge like any other tools.... It is the\r\n     function of a good book not only to fructify, but to inspire, not\r\n     only to fill the memory with evanescent treasures, but to enrich\r\n     the imagination with forms of beauty and goodness which leave a\r\n     lasting impression on the character."--_N. Y.

Though it makes only a slight\r\n     volume, its quality in thought and style is so admirable that all\r\n     who are interested in the subject of good education will give to\r\n     it a prominent and honorable position among the many books upon\r\n     education which have recently been published. For it takes only a\r\n     brief reading to perceive that in this single lecture the results\r\n     of wide experience in teaching and of long study of the true\r\n     principles of education are generalized and presented in a few\r\n     pages, each one of which contains so much that it might be easily\r\n     expanded into an excellent chapter."--_The Library Table._\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nREADING AS A FINE ART.\r\n\r\nBy ERNEST LEGOUV\xc3\x89, of the Acad\xc3\xa9mie Fran\xc3\xa7aise.

Pupils to-day, to-morrow you\r\n     will be teachers; to-morrow, generation after generation of youth\r\n     will pass through your guardian hands.

LEGOUV\xc3\x89.\r\n\r\n     We commend this valuable little book to the attention of teachers\r\n     and others interested in the instruction of the pupils of our\r\n     public schools. It treats of the "First Steps in Reading,"\r\n     "Learning to Read," "Should we read as we talk," "The Use and\r\n     Management of the Voice," "The Art of Breathing,"\r\n     "Pronunciation," "Stuttering," "Punctuation," "Readers and\r\n     Speakers," "Reading as a Means of Criticism," "On Reading\r\n     Poetry," &c., and makes a strong claim as to the value of reading\r\n     aloud, as being the most wholesome of gymnastics, for to\r\n     strengthen the voice is to strengthen the whole system and\r\n     develop vocal power.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHOW TO PARSE.\r\n\r\nAN ATTEMPT TO APPLY THE PRINCIPLES OF SCHOLARSHIP TO ENGLISH GRAMMAR.\r\nWith Appendixes in Analysis, Spelling, and Punctuation. By EDWIN A.\r\nABBOTT, M.A., Head Master of the City of London School. 16mo. Cloth.\r\nPrice $1.00.\r\n\r\n     "We recommend this little book to the careful attention of\r\n     teachers and others interested in instruction. In the hands of an\r\n     able teacher, the book should help to relieve parsing from the\r\n     reproach of being the bane of the school-room. The Etymological\r\n     Glossary of Grammatical Terms will also supply a long-felt want."\r\n     _N.Y. Nation._\r\n\r\n     "\'How to Parse\' is likely to prove to teachers a valuable, and to\r\n     scholars an agreeable, substitute for most of the grammars in\r\n     common use."--_Boston Daily Advertiser._\r\n\r\n     "The Rev. E.A. Abbott, whose books, \'English Lessons for English\r\n     People,\' and \'How to Write Clearly,\' have been accepted as\r\n     standard text-books on both sides of the ocean, has added another\r\n     work to his list of sensible treatises on the use of English. It\r\n     is called \'How to Parse,\' and is best described by the further\r\n     title, \'An Attempt to apply the Principles of Scholarship to\r\n     English Grammar, with Appendices on Analysis, Spelling, and\r\n     Punctuation.\' The little book is so sensible and so simple that\r\n     the greater number of its readers will perhaps forget to observe\r\n     that it is profoundly philosophical also, but it is so in the\r\n     best sense of the term."--_N. Y. Evening Post._\r\n\r\n     "Of all subjects of study, it may be safely admitted that grammar\r\n     possesses as a rule the fewest attractions for the youthful mind.\r\n     To prepare a work capable of imparting a thorough knowledge of\r\n     this important part of education in an attractive and\r\n     entertaining form, to many may appear extremely difficult, if not\r\n     impossible; nevertheless, the task has been accomplished in a\r\n     highly successful manner by Edwin A. Abbott, Head Master of the\r\n     City of London School, in a neat little volume entitled \'How to\r\n     Parse.\' The author has succeeded admirably in combining with the\r\n     exercises a vast amount of useful information, which impacts to\r\n     the principles and rules of the main subject a degree of interest\r\n     that renders the study as attractive as history or fiction. The\r\n     value of the book is greatly increased by an excellent glossary\r\n     of grammatical forms and a nicely arranged index. The work\r\n     deserves the attention and consideration of teachers and pupils,\r\n     and will doubtless prove a highly popular addition to the list of\r\n     school-books."--_N.Y.

It is not a poem which\r\n     could be profitably used in an argument for the enlargement of\r\n     the sphere of woman: it teaches her subjection, indeed, from the\r\n     lips of a beautiful girl, which are always so fatally convincing;\r\n     but it has its charm, nevertheless, and will serve at least for\r\n     an agreeable picture of an age when the ideal woman was a\r\n     creature around which grew the beauty and comfort and security of\r\n     home."--_Atlantic Monthly._\r\n\r\n     "The poem itself is bewitching. Of the same metre as Longfellow\'s\r\n     \'Evangeline,\' its sweet and measured cadences carry the reader\r\n     onward with a real pleasure as he becomes more and more absorbed\r\n     in this descriptive wooing song. It is a sweet volume to read\r\n     aloud in a select circle of intelligent friends."--_Providence\r\n     Press._\r\n\r\n     "Miss Frothingham has done a good service, and done it well, in\r\n     translating this famous idyl, which has been justly called \'one\r\n     of the most faultless poems of modern times.\' Nothing can surpass\r\n     the simplicity, tenderness, and grace of the original, and these\r\n     have been well preserved in Miss Frothingham\'s version. Her\r\n     success is worthy of the highest praise, and the mere English\r\n     reader can scarcely fail to read the poem with the same delight\r\n     with which it has always been read by those familiar with the\r\n     German. Its charming pictures of domestic life, the strength and\r\n     delicacy of its characterization, the purity of tone and ardent\r\n     love of country which breathe through it, must always make it one\r\n     of the most admired of Goethe\'s works."--_Boston Christian\r\n     Register._\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sold everywhere.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
