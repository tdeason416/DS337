The moral tone is plain.\r\n"She is kind to the old blind man."\r\n\r\nThe exercises are still suitable, and perhaps more helpful than some\r\ncontemporary alternatives. Much is left to the teacher. Explanations given\r\nin the text are enough to get started teaching a child to read and write.\r\nCounting in Roman numerals is included as a bonus in the form of lesson\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\nThe form of contractions includes a space. The contemporary word "don\'t"\r\nwas rendered as "do n\'t".\r\n\r\nThe author, not listed in the text, is William Holmes McGuffey.\r\n\r\nPassages using non-ASCI characters are approximately rendered in this text\r\nversion. See the PDF or DOC versions for the original images.\r\n\r\nThe section numbers are decimal in the Table of Contents but are in\r\nRoman Numerals in the body.\r\n\r\nPage headings are removed, but section titles are followed by the page on\r\nwhich they appear.\r\n\r\nDon Kostuch\r\nend transcriber\'s note]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECLECTIC EDUCATIONAL SERIES.\r\n\r\nMCGUFFEY\'S (Registered)\r\nFOURTH ECLECTIC READER.\r\n\r\nREVISED EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\nMcGuffey Edition and Colophon are Trademarks of\r\n\r\nJohn Wiley & Sons, Inc.\r\n\r\nNew York-Chichester-Weinheim-Brisbane-Toronto\r\n\r\n\r\nIn revising the FOURTH READER, the aim has been--as it has with the other\r\nbooks of the Series--to preserve unimpaired all the essential\r\ncharacteristics of MCGUFFEY\'S READERS. New articles have been substituted\r\nfor old ones only where the advantage was manifest.\r\n\r\nThe book has been considerably enlarged, and has been liberally\r\nillustrated by the first artists of the country.\r\n\r\nIt can not be presumed that every pupil has at hand all the works of\r\nreference necessary for the proper preparation of each lesson; hence all\r\nthe aids that seem requisite to this purpose have been given. Brief\r\nnotices concerning the various authors represented have been inserted; the\r\nmore difficult words have been defined, and their pronunciation has been\r\nindicated by diacritical marks; and short explanatory notes have been\r\ngiven wherever required for a full understanding of the text.\r\n\r\nEspecial acknowledgment is due to Messrs. Houghton, Osgood & Co. for their\r\npermission to make liberal selections from their copyright editions of\r\nmany of the foremost American author whose works they publish.\r\n\r\nCOPYRIGHT, 1879, by VAN ANTWERP, BRAGG & Co.\r\nCOPYRIGHT, 1896, by AMERICAN BOOK COMPANY.\r\nCOPYRIGHT, 1907 and 1920, by H.

(7)\r\n\r\n1. The Hyphen (-) is used between syllables and between the parts of a\r\ncompound word; as, No-ble, col-o-ny, and text- book, easy-chair.\r\n\r\n2. The Comma (,), the Semicolon (;), and the Colon (:) denote grammatical\r\ndivisions.\r\n\r\nNOTE--These marks do not indicate the comparative length of the pauses to\r\nbe made where they occur.\r\n\r\n3. The Period (.) is placed at the end of a sentence. It is also used\r\nafter an abbreviation; as, God is love. Dr. Eben Goodwin.\r\n\r\n4. The Interrogation point (?) denotes a question; as, Has he come? Who\r\nare you?\r\n\r\n5. The Exclamation point (!) denotes strong feeling; as, Oh Absaom! my\r\nson! my son!\r\n\r\n6. Quotation marks (" ") denote the words of another; as, God said, "Let\r\nthere be light."\r\n\r\n7. The Apostrophe (\') denotes that a letter or letters are left out; as,\r\nO\'er, for over; \'t is, for it is. It also denotes the possessive case; as,\r\nJohn\'s hat.\r\n\r\n8. The Curves ( ) include what, if omitted, would not obscure the sense.\r\nThe parenthesis, or words included by the curves, should be read in a low\r\nkey, and with greater rapidity than the rest of the sentence.\r\n\r\n9. Brackets [ ] include something intended to exemplify what goes before,\r\nor to supply some deficiency, or rectify some mistake.\r\n\r\n10. A Dash (-) denotes a long or significant pause, or an abrupt change or\r\ntransition in a sentence.\r\n\r\n11. Marks of Ellipsis (***) indicate the omission of\r\nletters of a word, or words of a sentence; as, P * * * * e\r\nJ**n, for Prince John; the ******* was hung, for the traitor was hung.\r\n\r\nSometimes a long line, or a succession of dots is used instead of stars;\r\nas, J--n A---s, for John Adams; the D..e W.....m, for the Duke William.\r\n\r\n12. A Brace (}) is used to connect several lines or words together.\r\n\r\n13. A Diaeresis  is put over the latter of two vowels, to show that they\r\nbelong to two distinct syllables; thus, cooperate.\r\n\r\n14. A Section is used to divide a discourse or chapter into parts.\r\n\r\n15. An Index points out something that requires particular attention.\r\n\r\n16. A Paragraph denotes a new subject. It is used in the common version of\r\nthe Bible.\r\n\r\n17. Certain marks and sometimes figures and letters are used to refer to\r\nsome remark in the margin.\r\n\r\n18. A Caret (^) is used in writing, to show that some-thing is omitted;\r\nas,  Manner. I love her for her modesty and virtue.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTICULATION. (9)\r\n\r\nELEMENTARY SOUNDS\r\n\r\nArticulation is the utterance of the elementary sounds of a language, and\r\nof their combinations.\r\n\r\nAn Elementary Sound is a simple, distinct sound made by the organs of\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\nThe Elementary Sounds of the English language are divided into Vocals,\r\nSubvocals, and Aspirates.\r\n\r\nVocals are those sounds which consist of pure tone only. They are the most\r\nprominent elements of speech. A diphthong is a union of two vocals,\r\ncommencing with one and ending with the other.\r\n\r\nSubvocals are those sounds in which the vocalized breath is more or less\r\nobstructed.\r\n\r\nAspirates consist of breath only, modified by the vocal organs.\r\n\r\n\r\nVOCALS.\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS FOR ARTICULATION.\r\n\r\n1. Let the mouth be open, and the teeth, tongue, and palate in their\r\nproper position.\r\n\r\n2. Pronounce the word in the CHART forcibly, and with the falling\r\ninflection, several times in succession; then drop the subvocal or\r\naspirate sounds which precede or follow the vocal, and repeat the vocals\r\nalone.\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE.\r\n\r\nLong Vocals.\r\n\r\nSound   Word    Sound   Word\r\na       hate    e       err\r\na       hare    i       pine\r\na       far     o       no\r\na       pass    u       tube\r\na       fall    u       burn\r\ne       eve     oo      cool\r\n\r\nShort Vocals.\r\n\r\nSound   Word    Sound   Word\r\n\r\na       mat     o       not\r\ne       met     u       us\r\ni       it      oo      book\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARK.--In this table, the short sounds, except u, are nearly or quite\r\nthe same, in quality, as certain of the long sounds. The difference\r\nconsists chiefly in quantity. As a rule, the long vocals should be\r\nprolonged with a full, clear utterance; but the short vocals should be\r\nuttered sharply and almost explosively.\r\n\r\nDiphthongs.\r\n\r\noi, oy, as in coin, boy.        ou, ow, as in noun, now.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBVOCALS AND ASPIRATES.\r\n\r\nDIRECTIONS FOR ARTICULATION.\r\n\r\nPronounce distinctly and forcibly, several times in succession, words in\r\nwhich these sounds occur as elements; then drop the other sounds, and\r\nrepeat the subvocals and aspirates alone. Each subvocal in the first table\r\nshould be practiced in connection with its cognate sound.\r\n\r\nLet the class repeat the words and elements, at first in concert; then\r\nseparately.\r\n\r\nSelect words ending with subvocal sounds for practice on subvocals; words\r\nbeginning or ending with aspirate sounds, for practice on aspirates.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOGNATE SOUNDS.\r\n\r\nSubvocals               Aspirates\r\nSound  Example          Sound   Example\r\nb      babe             p       rap\r\nd      rod              t       at\r\ng      fog              k       book\r\nj      judge            ch      chat\r\nv      live             f       file\r\nth     them             th      myth\r\nz      buzz             s       sink\r\nzh     azure            sh      shine\r\nw      win              wh      when\r\n\r\n\r\nREMARK.--These eighteen sounds make nine pairs of cognate sounds. In\r\narticulating the aspirates, the vocal organs are put in the position as\r\nrequired for the articulation of the corresponding subvocals; but the\r\nbreath is expelled with some force, without the utterance of any vocal\r\nsound. Let the pupil verify this by experiment, and then practice on these\r\ncognates.\r\n\r\nThe following sounds are not cognates.\r\n\r\nSUB VOCALS.\r\nSound        Example\r\n\r\nl            mill\r\nm            him\r\nn            tin\r\nng           sing, think\r\nr (rough)    rule\r\nr (smooth)   car\r\n\r\nASPIRATE.\r\n\r\nh, as in hat.\r\n\r\nSUBSTITUTES.\r\n\r\nSubstitutes are characters used to represent sounds ordinarily represented\r\nby other characters.

"Will you give my kite a lift?" said my little nephew to his sister,\r\nafter trying in vain to make it fly by dragging it along the ground. Lucy\r\nvery kindly took it up and threw it into the air, but, her brother\r\nneglecting to run off at the same moment, the kite fell down again.\r\n\r\n2. "Ah! now, how awkward you are!" said the little fellow. "It was your\r\nfault entirely," answered his sister. "Try again, children," said I.\r\n\r\n3. Lucy once more took up the kite. But now John was in too great a hurry;\r\nhe ran off so suddenly that he twitched the kite out of her hand, and it\r\nfell flat as before. "Well, who is to blame now?" asked Lucy. "Try again,"\r\nsaid I.\r\n\r\n4. They did, and with more care; but a side wind coming suddenly, as Lucy\r\nlet go the kite, it was blown against some shrubs, and the tail became\r\nentangled in a moment, leaving the poor kite hanging with its head\r\ndownward.\r\n\r\n5. "There, there!" exclaimed John, "that comes of your throwing it all to\r\none side." "As if I could make the wind blow straight," said Lucy. In the\r\nmeantime, I went to the kite\'s assistance; and having disengaged the long\r\ntail, I rolled it up, saying, "Come, children, there are too many trees\r\nhere; let us find a more open space, and then try again."\r\n\r\n6. We presently found a nice grassplot, at one side of which I took my\r\nstand; and all things being prepared, I tossed the kite up just as little\r\nJohn ran off. It rose with all the dignity of a balloon, and promised a\r\nlofty flight; but John, delighted to find it pulling so hard at the\r\nstring, stopped short to look upward and admire. The string slackened, the\r\nkite wavered, and, the wind not being very favorable, down came the kite\r\nto the grass. "O John, you should not have stopped," said I. "However, try\r\nagain."\r\n\r\n7. "I won\'t try any more," replied he, rather sullenly. "It is of no use,\r\nyou see. The kite won\'t fly, and I don\'t want to be plagued with it any\r\nlonger." "Oh, fie, my little man! would you give up the sport, after all\r\nthe pains we have taken both to make and to fly the kite? A few\r\ndisappointments ought not to discourage us. Come, I have wound up your\r\nstring, and now try again."\r\n\r\n8. And he did try, and succeeded, for the kite was carried upward on the\r\nbreeze as lightly as a feather; and when the string was all out, John\r\nstood in great delight, holding fast the stick and gazing on the kite,\r\nwhich now seemed like a little white speck in the blue sky. "Look, look,\r\naunt, how high it flies! and it pulls like a team of horses, so that I can\r\nhardly hold it. I wish I had a mile of string: I am sure it would go to\r\nthe end of it."\r\n\r\n9. After enjoying the sight as long as he pleased, little John proceeded\r\nto roll up the string slowly; and when the kite fell, he took it up with\r\ngreat glee, saying that it was not at all hurt, and that it had behaved\r\nvery well. "Shall we come out to-morrow, aunt, after lessons, and try\r\nagain?"\r\n\r\n10. "I have no objection, my dear, if the weather is fine. And now, as we\r\nwalk home, tell me what you have learned from your morning\'s sport." "I\r\nhave learned to fly my kite properly." "You may thank aunt for it,\r\nbrother," said Lucy, "for you would have given it up long ago, if she had\r\nnot persuaded you to try again."\r\n\r\n11. "Yes, dear children, I wish to teach you the value of perseverance,\r\neven when nothing more depends upon it than the flying of a kite. Whenever\r\nyou fail in your attempts to do any good thing, let your motto be,--try\r\nagain."\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--In defining words, that meaning is given which is\r\nappropriate to them in the connection in which they are used.\r\n\r\n\r\n4.

She wrote many\r\ncharming stories for children in prose and verse, and also translated many\r\nfrom Swedish, Danish, and German authors. This story is arranged from one\r\nin a collection named "Peter Drake\'s Dream, and Other Stories." She died\r\nin 1888.\r\n\r\n1. There were, in very ancient times, two brothers, one of whom was rich,\r\nand the other poor. Christmas was approaching, but the poor man had\r\nnothing in the house for a Christmas dinner; so he went to his brother and\r\nasked him for a trifling gift.\r\n\r\n2. The rich man was ill-natured, and when he heard his brother\'s request\r\nhe looked very surly. But as Christmas is a time when even the worst\r\npeople give gifts, he took a fine ham down from the chimney, where it was\r\nhanging to smoke, threw it at his brother, and bade him begone and never\r\nto let him see his face again.\r\n\r\n3. The poor man thanked his brother for the ham, put it under his arm, and\r\nwent his way. He had to pass through a great forest on his way home. When\r\nhe had reached the thickest part of it, he saw an old man, with a long,\r\nwhite beard, hewing timber. "Good evening," said he to him.\r\n\r\n4. "Good evening," returned the old man, raising himself up from his work,\r\nand looking at him. "That is a fine ham you are carrying." On this, the\r\npoor man told him all about it.\r\n\r\n5. "It is lucky for you," said the old man, "that you have met with me. If\r\nyou will take that ham into the land of the dwarfs, the entrance to which\r\nlies just under the roots of this tree, you can make a capital bargain\r\nwith it; for the dwarfs are very fond of ham, and rarely get any. But mind\r\nwhat I say: you must not sell it for money, but demand for it the \'old\r\nhand mill which stands behind the door.\' When you come back, I\'ll show you\r\nhow to use it."\r\n\r\n6. The poor man thanked his new friend, who showed him the door under a\r\nstone below the roots of the tree, and by this door he entered into the\r\nland of the dwarfs. No sooner had he set his foot in it, than the dwarfs\r\nswarmed about him, attracted by the smell of the ham. They offered him\r\nqueer, old-fashioned money and gold and silver ore for it; but he refused\r\nall their tempting offers, and said that he would sell it only for the old\r\nhand mill behind the door.\r\n\r\n7. At this, the dwarfs held up their little old hands, and looked quite\r\nperplexed. "We can not make a bargain, it seems," said the poor man, "so\r\nI\'ll bid you all a good day."\r\n\r\n8. The fragrance of the ham had by this time reached the remote parts of\r\ndwarf land. The dwarfs came flocking around in little troops, leaving\r\ntheir work of digging out precious ores, eager for the ham.\r\n\r\n9. "Let him have the old mill," said some of the newcomers; "it is quite\r\nout of order, and he don\'t know how to use it. Let him have it, and we\r\nwill have the ham."\r\n\r\n10. So the bargain was made. The poor man took the old hand mill, which\r\nwas a little thing not half so large as the ham, and went back to the\r\nwoods. Here the old man showed him how to use it. All this had taken up a\r\ngreat deal of time, and it was midnight before he reached home.\r\n\r\n11. "Where in the world have you been?" said his wife. "Here I have been\r\nwaiting and waiting, and we have no wood to make a fire, nor anything to\r\nput into the porridge pot for our Christmas supper."\r\n\r\n12. The house was dark and cold; but the poor man bade his wife wait and\r\nsee what would happen. He placed the little hand mill on the table, and\r\nbegan to turn the crank. First, out there came some grand, lighted wax\r\ncandles, and a fire on the hearth, and a porridge pot boiling over it,\r\nbecause in his mind he said they should come first. Then he ground out a\r\ntablecloth, and dishes, and spoons, and knives and forks.\r\n\r\n13. He was himself astonished at his good luck, as you may believe; and\r\nhis wife was almost beside herself with joy and astonishment. Well, they\r\nhad a capital supper; and after it was eaten, they ground out of the mill\r\nevery possible thing to make their house and themselves warm and\r\ncomfortable. So they had a merry Christmas eve and morning.\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--l. Tri\'-fling, of small value. 5. Hand \'mill, a mill turned\r\nby hand. 6. At-tract\'ed, drawn to, allured. 7. Perplexed\', puzzled. 8.\r\nFra\'grance, sweetness of smell.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. WHY THE SEA IS SALT. (32)\r\n(Concluded.)\r\n\r\n1. When the people went by the house to church, the next day, they could\r\nhardly believe their eyes. There was glass in the windows instead of a\r\nwooden shutter, and the poor man and his wife, dressed in nice new\r\nclothes, were seen devoutly kneeling in the church.\r\n\r\n2. "There is something very strange in all this," said everyone.\r\n"Something very strange indeed," said the rich man, when three days\r\nafterwards he received an invitation from his once poor brother to a grand\r\nfeast. And what a feast it was! The table was covered with a cloth as\r\nwhite as snow, and the dishes were all of silver or gold. The rich man\r\ncould not, in his great house, and with all his wealth, set out such a\r\ntable.\r\n\r\n3. "Where did you get all these things?" exclaimed he. His brother told\r\nhim all about the bargain he had made with the dwarfs, and putting the\r\nmill on the table, ground out boots and shoes, coats and cloaks,\r\nstockings, gowns, and blankets, and bade his wife give them to the poor\r\npeople that had gathered about the house to get a sight of the grand feast\r\nthe poor brother had made for the rich one.\r\n\r\n4. The rich man, was very envious of his brother\'s good fortune, and\r\nwanted to borrow the mill, intending--for he was not an honest man--never\r\nto return it again. His brother would not lend it, for the old man with\r\nthe white beard had told him never to sell or lend it to anyone.\r\n\r\n5. Some years went on, and, at last, the possessor of the mill built\r\nhimself a grand castle on a rock by the sea, facing the west. Its windows,\r\nreflecting the golden sunset, could be seen far out from the shore. It\r\nbecame a noted landmark for sailors. Strangers from foreign parts often\r\ncame to see this castle and the wonderful mill of which the most\r\nextraordinary tales were told.\r\n\r\n6. At length, a great foreign merchant came, and when he had seen the\r\nmill, inquired whether it would grind salt. Being told that it would, he\r\nwanted to buy it; for he traded in salt, and thought that if he owned it\r\nhe could supply all his customers without taking long and dangerous\r\nvoyages.\r\n\r\n7. The man would not sell it, of course. He was so rich now that he did\r\nnot want to use it for himself; but every Christmas he ground out food and\r\nclothes and coal for the poor, and nice presents for the little children.\r\nSo he rejected all the offers of the rich merchant. The merchant, however,\r\ndetermined to have it; he bribed one of the man\'s servants to let him go\r\ninto the castle at night, and he stole the mill and sailed away with it in\r\ntriumph.\r\n\r\n8. He had scarcely got out to sea, before he determined to set the mill to\r\nwork. "Now, mill, grind salt," said he; "grind salt with all your\r\nmight!--salt, salt, and nothing but salt!" The mill began to grind and the\r\nsailors to fill the sacks; but these were soon full, and in spite of all\r\nthat could be done, it began to fill the ship.\r\n\r\n9. The dishonest merchant was now very much frightened. What was to be\r\ndone? The mill would not stop grinding; and at last the ship was\r\noverloaded, and down it went, making a great whirlpool where it sank. The\r\nship soon went to pieces; but the mill stands on the bottom of the sea,\r\nand keeps grinding  out "salt, salt, nothing but salt!" That is the\r\nreason, say the peasants of Denmark and Norway, why the sea is salt.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--l. De-vout\'ly, in a reverent manner. 5. Re--flect\'ing,\r\nthrowing back light, heat, etc., as a mirror. Land\'-mark, an object on\r\nland serving as a guide to seamen. Ex-traor\'--di-na-ry, wonderful. 9.\r\nWhirl\'-pool, a gulf in which the water moves round in a circle. Peas\'ents,\r\nthose belonging to the lowest class of tillers of the soil in Europe.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISES.--What is a "fairy tale"?  What fairy people are told about in\r\nthis story? How did the poor man find the way to the land of the dwarfs?\r\nDo you think the old man would have told him if the poor man had not been\r\nso polite? How did the poor man treat his rich brother in return for his\r\nunkindness? How was the greed of the dishonest merchant punished? What is\r\nmeant by "strangers from foreign parts"? Where are Denmark and Norway?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV. POPPING CORN. (34)\r\n\r\n1. One autumn night, when the wind was high,\r\n     And the rain fell in heavy plashes,\r\n   A little boy sat by the kitchen fire,\r\n     A-popping corn in the ashes;\r\n   And his sister, a curly-haired child of three,\r\n   Sat looking on, just close to his knee.\r\n\r\n2. Pop! pop! and the kernels, one by one,\r\n     Came out of the embers flying;\r\n   The boy held a long pine stick in his hand,\r\n     And kept it busily plying;\r\n   He stirred the corn and it snapped the more,\r\n   And faster jumped to the clean-swept floor.\r\n\r\n3. Part of the kernels flew one way,\r\n     And a part hopped out the other;\r\n   Some flew plump into the sister\'s lap,\r\n     Some under the stool of the brother;\r\n   The little girl gathered them into a heap,\r\n   And called them a flock of milk-white sheep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI. SMILES. (35)\r\n\r\n1. Poor lame Jennie sat at her window, looking out upon the dismal, narrow\r\nstreet, with a look of pain and weariness on her face. "Oh, dear," she\r\nsaid with a sigh, "what a long day this is going to be," and she looked\r\nwishfully up the street.\r\n\r\n2. Suddenly she leaned forward and pressed her pale face against the\r\nglass, as a rosy-checked boy came racing down the street, swinging his\r\nschoolbooks by the strap. Looking up to the window, he took off his hat\r\nand bowed with a bright, pleasant smile.\r\n\r\n3. "What a nice boy he is," said Jennie to herself, as he ran out of\r\nsight. "I am so glad he goes by here on his way to school. When he smiles,\r\nit seems like having the sun shine. I wish everybody who goes by would\r\nlook up and smile."\r\n\r\n4. "Mamma," said George West, as he came from school, "I can\'t help\r\nthinking about that poor little girl I told you of the other day. She\r\nlooks so tired. I took off my hat and bowed to her to-day. I wish I could\r\ndo something for her,"\r\n\r\n5. "Suppose you should carry her a handful of pretty flowers some time\r\nwhen you go to school," said Mrs. West. "I\'ll do that to-morrow morning,"\r\nsaid George, "if I can find my way into that rickety old house."\r\n\r\n6. The next morning, as Jennie sat leaning her head wearily against the\r\nwindow, watching the raindrops chasing one another down the glass, she\r\nspied George with a handful of beautiful flowers carefully picking his way\r\nacross the street. He stopped in front of her window, and, smiling very\r\npleasantly, said, "How shall I find the way to your room?"\r\n\r\n7. Jennie pointed to an alley near by, where he turned in, and with some\r\ndifficulty found his way to the dingy staircase. Opening the door to\r\nJennie\'s gentle "Come in," he said, "I have brought you a handful of\r\nflowers to look at this rainy day."\r\n\r\n8. "Are they for me?" exclaimed Jennie, clapping her hands in delight.\r\n"How kind you are," she continued, as George laid them in her lap. "I have\r\nnot had a flower since we live in the city."\r\n\r\n9. "Did you use to live in the country?" asked George. "Oh, yes," answered\r\nJennie, "we used to live in a beautiful cottage, and there were trees and\r\nflowers and green grass, and the air was so sweet."\r\n\r\n10. "Well, what made you move here?" "Oh," said Jennie, softly, "papa\r\ndied, and mamma was sick so long that the money was all gone. Then mamma\r\nhad to sell the cottage, and she moved here to try to get work to do."\r\n\r\n11. "Do you have to sit here all day?" asked George, glancing around the\r\nbare room and out into the dismal street. "Yes," said Jennie, "because I\r\nam lame; but I would not care for that, if I could only help mamma."\r\n\r\n12. "I declare, it\'s too had!" said George, who dreaded nothing so much as\r\nbeing obliged to stay in the house. "Oh, no, it isn\'t," said Jennie,\r\npleasantly; "mamma says maybe we should forget the Lord if we had\r\neverything we wanted, and He never forgets us, you know."\r\n\r\n13. "Well, I must rush for school," said George, not knowing exactly what\r\nto say next; and he was soon out of Jennie\'s sight, but had a happy little\r\ncorner in his heart, because he had tried to do a kind act. He did not\r\nknow how much good he had done in making a pleasant day out of a dreary\r\none for a little sick girl.\r\n\r\n14. "Mamma," said George, that evening, after he had told her what Jennie\r\nsaid, "papa must give them some money, so they can go back to their home."\r\n\r\n15. "No," said his mother; "he can not do that, and they would not wish\r\nhim to do so; but perhaps he can help us contrive some way to assist them,\r\nso that they can live more comfortably."\r\n\r\n16. "I am going to carry Jennie some of the grapes grandpa sent me,\r\nto-morrow," said George, turning over the leaves of his geography. "I will\r\nput some of my pears into your basket, and go with you," said his mother;\r\n"but there is one thing we can always give, and sometimes it does more\r\ngood than nice things to eat, or even money."\r\n\r\n17. "What is that, mamma,--smiles?" asked George, looking up. "Yes,"\r\nanswered his mother; "and it is a good plan to throw in a kind word or two\r\nwith them when you can."\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.-l. Dis\'mal, gloomy, cheerless. Wish\'ful-ly, with desire. 5.\r\nRick\'et-y, imperfect, worn out. 7. Din\'gy, dark. 11. Glan\'cing, looking\r\nabout quickly. 13. Drear\'y, comfortless, gloomy. 15. Con-trive\', to plan.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISES.--What is the subject of this lesson? How did George West make\r\nthe day pleasant for Jennie? What did his mother suggest? What happened\r\nnext day? What did Jennie tell George about her life? Relate what happened\r\nat George\'s home that evening. What does the lesson teach?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII. LAZY NED. (38)\r\n\r\n1. "\'T is royal fun," cried lazy Ned,\r\n   "To coast, upon my fine, new sled,\r\n     And beat the other boys;\r\n   But then, I can not bear to climb\r\n   The tiresome hill, for every time\r\n     It more and more annoys."\r\n\r\n2. So, while his schoolmates glided by,\r\n   And gladly tugged uphill, to try\r\n     Another merry race,\r\n   Too indolent to share their plays,\r\n   Ned was compelled to stand and gaze,\r\n     While shivering in his place.\r\n\r\n3. Thus, he would never take the pains\r\n   To seek the prize that labor gains,\r\n     Until the time had passed;\r\n   For, all his life, he dreaded still\r\n   The silly bugbear of uphill,\r\n     And died a dunce at last.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.-l. Roy\'al, excellent, noble. Coast, to slide. An--noys\',\r\ntroubles. 2. In\'do-lent, lazy. 3. Prize, a reward. Bug-bear, something\r\nfrightful. Dunce, a silly fellow.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISES.--What did Ned like? What did he not like?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII. THE MONKEY. (39)\r\n\r\n1. The monkey is a very cunning little animal, and is found in many parts\r\nof the world.\r\n\r\n2. A lady once had a monkey, which had been brought to her as a present.\r\nThis monkey, like all others, was very fond of mischief and of doing\r\nwhatever he saw others do.\r\n\r\n3. His mistress found him one day sitting on her toilet table, holding in\r\none hand a little china mug with water in it, and in the other her\r\ntoothbrush, with which he was cleaning his teeth, looking all the time in\r\nthe glass.\r\n\r\n4. Her little daughter, Maria, had a large doll with a very handsome head\r\nand face. She one day left this doll in the cradle, and went out of the\r\nroom. The monkey came in, took the doll in his arms, and jumping upon the\r\nwashstand, he began to wash its face.\r\n\r\n5. He first rubbed it all over with soap. Then seizing the towel, he\r\ndipped it in the wash bowl, and rubbed it so hard that the doll\'s face was\r\nentirely spoiled, the paint being all washed off.\r\n\r\n6. There have been many tales of monkeys who, armed with sticks, have\r\njoined together and made war or resisted their enemies with great effect.\r\nThese are not true, as it is known that in their native state monkeys have\r\nno idea of weapons.\r\n\r\n7. The sticks and other missiles said to be thrown at travelers as they\r\npass under the branches of trees, are usually the dead branches, etc.,\r\naccidentally broken off, as the monkeys, with the natural curiosity of\r\ntheir tribe, pass along the tops of trees to watch the actions of the\r\npeople below.\r\n\r\n8. They can, however, be taught to use a stick, and to use it well. Some\r\ntime ago, two Italians together owned an organ and a monkey, by means of\r\nwhich they earned their living. During one of their exhibitions, a dog\r\nflew at the little monkey, which made its owners very angry.\r\n\r\n9. They and the owner of the dog quarreled about it, and at last it was\r\nagreed that the dog and the monkey should fight it out; the monkey,\r\nbecause he was smaller, was to be allowed a stick.\r\n\r\n10. The monkey was taught what he was to do in the following manner: One\r\nof the Italians crawled on his hands and knees, barking like a dog, while\r\nthe other got on his back, grasped his hair, and beat him about the head\r\nwith a stick.\r\n\r\n11. The monkey looked on with great gravity, and, when the instruction was\r\nover, received the stick with the air of a man who knew his work and meant\r\nto do it.\r\n\r\n12. Everything being settled the dog flew at the monkey with open month.\r\nThe monkey immediately leaped on his back, and, grasping the dog\'s ear,\r\nbeat away at his head with such good will that his adversary speedily gave\r\nin. The monkey, however, was not content with a mere victory, but\r\ncontinued pounding at the dog\'s head until he left him senseless on the\r\nground.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Cun\'ning, sly. 3. Toi\'let ta\'ble, dressing table. 6.\r\nRe-sist\'ed, opposed. 7. Mis\'siles, weapons thrown. 8. Ex-hi-bi\'tions,\r\npublic shows. 11. Grav\'i-ty, seriousness. In-struc\'-tion, lesson, 12.\r\nSense\'less, without apparent life.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISES.--What kind of an animal is a monkey? Where did the lady find\r\nthe monkey one day? What was he doing? What did he do with Maria\'s doll?\r\nDo monkeys in their native state know how to use sticks as weapons? Can\r\nthey be taught to use them? Relate the story of the two Italians. What is\r\nthe meaning of "etc." in the seventh paragraph?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIX. MEDDLESOME MATTY. (42)\r\n\r\n1. Oh, how one ugly trick has spoiled\r\n     The sweetest and the best!\r\n   Matilda, though a pleasant child,\r\n     One grievous fault possessed,\r\n   Which, like a cloud before the skies,\r\n   Hid all her better qualities.\r\n\r\n2. Sometimes, she\'d lift the teapot lid\r\n     To peep at what was in it;\r\n   Or tilt, the kettle, if you did\r\n     But turn your back a minute.\r\n   In vain you told her not to touch,\r\n   Her trick of meddling grew so much.\r\n\r\n3. Her grand mamma went out one day,\r\n     And, by mistake, she laid\r\n   Her spectacles and snuffbox gay,\r\n     Too near the little maid;\r\n   "Ah! well," thought she, "I\'ll try them on,\r\n   As soon as grand mamma is gone."\r\n\r\n4. Forthwith, she placed upon her nose\r\n     The glasses large and wide;\r\n   And looking round, as I suppose,\r\n     The snuffbox, too, she spied.\r\n   "Oh, what a pretty box is this!\r\n   I\'ll open it," said little miss.\r\n\r\n5. "I know that grandmamma would say,\r\n     \'Don\'t meddle with it, dear;\'\r\n   But then she\'s far enough away,\r\n     And no one else is near;\r\n   Beside, what can there be amiss\r\n   In opening such a box as this?"\r\n\r\n6. So, thumb and finger went to work\r\n     To move the stubborn lid;\r\n   And, presently, a mighty jerk\r\n     The mighty mischief did;\r\n   For all at once, ah! woeful case!\r\n   The snuff came puffing in her face.\r\n\r\n7. Poor eyes, and nose, and mouth, and chin\r\n     A dismal sight presented;\r\n   And as the snuff got further in,\r\n     Sincerely she repented.\r\n   In vain she ran about for ease,\r\n   She could do nothing else but sneeze.\r\n\r\n8. She dashed the spectacles away,\r\n     To wipe her tingling eyes;\r\n   And, as in twenty bits they lay,\r\n     Her grandmamma she spies.\r\n   "Heyday! and what\'s the matter now?"\r\n   Cried grandmamma, with angry brow.\r\n\r\n9. Matilda, smarting with the pain,\r\n     And tingling still, and sore,\r\n   Made many a promise to refrain\r\n     From meddling evermore;\r\n   And \'t is a fact, as I have heard,\r\n   She ever since has kept her word.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.-l. Qual\'i-ties, traits of character. 2. Med\'-dling,\r\ninterfering without right. 4. Forth-with\', at once. Spied, saw. 5.\r\nA-miss\', wrong, faulty. 6. Woe\'ful, sad, sorrowful 8. Tin\'gling, smarting.\r\n9. Re-frain\', to keep from.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISES.--What did Matilda do? How was she punished?  What effect did it\r\nhave on her?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX. THE GOOD SON. (44)\r\n\r\n1. There was once a jeweler, noted for many virtues. One day, the Jewish\r\nelders came to him to buy some diamonds, to put upon that part of the\r\ndress of their high priest, which the Bible calls an ephod.\r\n\r\n2. They told him what they wanted, and offered him a fair price for the\r\ndiamonds. He replied that he could not let them see the jewels at that\r\nmoment, and requested them to call again.\r\n\r\n3. As they wanted them without delay, and thought that the object of the\r\njeweler was only to increase the price of the diamonds, the elders offered\r\nhim twice, then three times, as much as they were worth. But he still\r\nrefused, and they went away in very bad humor.\r\n\r\n4. Some hours after, he went to them, and placed before them the diamonds,\r\nfor which they again offered him the last price they had named; but he\r\nsaid, "I will only accept the first one you offered to me this morning."\r\n\r\n5. "Why, then, did you not close with us at once?" asked they in surprise.\r\n"When you came," replied he, "my father had the key of the chest, in which\r\nthe diamonds were kept, and as he was asleep, I should have been obliged\r\nto wake him to obtain them.\r\n\r\n6. "At his age, a short hour of sleep does him a great deal of good; and\r\nfor all the gold in the world, I would not be wanting in respect to my\r\nfather, or take from him a single comfort."\r\n\r\n7. The elders, affected by these feeling words, spread their hands upon\r\nthe jeweler\'s head, and said, "Thou shalt be blessed of Him who has said,\r\n\'Honor thy father and thy mother;\' and thy children shall one day pay thee\r\nthe same respect and love thou hast shown to thy father."\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--l. Jew\'el-er, one who buys and sells precious stones.\r\nNot\'ed, well known. Eld\'er, an officer of the Jewish church. Eph\'od, part\r\nof the dress of a Jewish priest, made of two pieces, one covering the\r\nchest and the other the back, united by a girdle. 2. Di\'a-monds, precious\r\nstones. 3. Hu\'mor, state of mind, temper. 5. Close, come to an agreement.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISES.--Relate the story of the jeweler and his\r\ndiamonds. What did the elders say to him, when they heard\r\nhis reason for not giving them the diamonds at first?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXI. TO-MORROW. (45)\r\n\r\nMrs. M. B. Johnson is the authoress of  "To-morrow," one of a collection\r\nof poems; entitled "Poems of Home Life."\r\n\r\n1. A bright, merry boy, with laughing face,\r\n   Whose every motion was full of grace,\r\n   Who knew no trouble and feared no care,\r\n   Was the light of our household--the youngest there.\r\n\r\n2. He was too young, this little elf,\r\n   With troublesome questions to vex himself;\r\n   But for many days a thought would rise,\r\n   And bring a shade to his dancing eyes.\r\n\r\n3. He went to one whom he thought more wise\r\n   Than any other beneath the skies;\r\n   "Mother,"--O word that makes the home!--\r\n   "Tell me, when will to-morrow come?"\r\n\r\n4. "It is almost night," the mother said,\r\n   "And time for my boy to be in bed;\r\n   When you wake up and it\'s day again,\r\n   It will be to-morrow, my darling, then."\r\n\r\n5. The little boy slept through all the night,\r\n   But woke with the first red streak of light;\r\n   He pressed a kiss to his mother\'s brow,\r\n   And whispered, "Is it to-morrow now?"\r\n\r\n6. "No, little Eddie, this is to-day:\r\n   To-morrow is always one night away."\r\n   He pondered a while, but joys came fast,\r\n   And this vexing question quickly passed.\r\n\r\n7. But it came again with the shades of night;\r\n   "Will it be to-morrow when it is light?"\r\n   From years to come he seemed care to borrow,\r\n   He tried so hard to catch to-morrow.\r\n\r\n8. "You can not catch it, my little Ted;\r\n   Enjoy to-day," the mother said;\r\n   "Some wait for to-morrow through many a year\r\n   It is always coming, but never is here."\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1. House\'hold,  family, those living in the same house. 2.\r\nElf, a small fairy-like person. Vex, worry, trouble. Pon\'dered, thought\r\nanxiously. A-while\', for a short time.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISES.--What is meant by "dancing eyes" in the second stanza? What is\r\nmeant by "the shades of night," in the seventh stanza? Of what name are\r\n"Eddie" and "Ted" nicknames? What troubled Eddie? Can you define tomorrow?\r\nWhat did Eddie\'s mother advise him to do?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXII. WHERE THERE IS A WILL THERE IS A WAY. (47)\r\n\r\n1. Henry Bond was about ten years old when his father died. His mother\r\nfound it difficult to provide for the support of a large family, thus left\r\nentirely in her care. By good management, however, she contrived to do so,\r\nand also to send Henry, the oldest, to school, and to supply him, for the\r\nmost part, with such books as he needed.\r\n\r\n2. At one time, however, Henry wanted a grammar, in order to join a class\r\nin that study, and his mother could not furnish him with the money to buy\r\nit. He was very much troubled about it, and went to bed with a heavy\r\nheart, thinking what could be done.\r\n\r\n3. On waking in the morning, he found that a deep snow had fallen, and the\r\ncold wind was blowing furiously. "Ah," said he, "it is an ill wind that\r\nblows nobody good."\r\n\r\n4. He rose, ran to the house of a neighbor, and offered his service to\r\nclear a path around his premises. The offer was accepted. Having completed\r\nthis work, and received his pay, he went to another place for the same\r\npurpose, and then to another, until he had earned enough to buy a grammar.\r\n\r\n5. When school commenced, Henry was in his seat, the happiest boy there,\r\nready to begin the lesson in his new book.\r\n\r\n6. From that time, Henry, was always the first in all his classes. He knew\r\nno such word as fail, but always succeeded in all he attempted. Having the\r\nwill, he always found the way.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--l. Man\'age-ment, manner of directing things. 2. Fur\'nish, to\r\nsupply. 3. Fu\'ri-ous-ly, violently. 4. Serv\'ice, labor. Prem\'i-ses,\r\ngrounds around a house.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIII. PICCOLA. (48)\r\n\r\nBy Celia Laighton Thaxter, who was born at Portsmouth, N. H., June 29,\r\n1836. Much of her childhood was passed at White Island, one of the Isles\r\nof Shoals, off the coast of New Hampshire. "Among the Isles of Shoals," is\r\nher most noted work in prose. She published a volume of poems, many of\r\nwhich are favorites with children. She died in 1894.\r\n\r\n1. Poor, sweet Piccola! Did you hear\r\n   What happened to Piccola, children dear?\r\n   \'T is seldom Fortune such favor grants\r\n   As fell to this little maid of France.\r\n\r\n2. \'T was Christmas time, and her parents poor\r\n   Could hardly drive the wolf from the door,\r\n   Striving with poverty\'s patient pain\r\n   Only to live till summer again.\r\n\r\n3. No gift for Piccola! sad were they\r\n   When dawned the morning of Christmas day!\r\n   Their little darling no joy might stir;\r\n   St. Nicholas nothing would bring to her!\r\n\r\n4. But Piccola never doubted at all\r\n   That something beautiful must befall\r\n   Every child upon Christmas day,\r\n   And so she slept till the dawn was gray.\r\n\r\n5. And full of faith, when at last she woke,\r\n   She stole to her shoe as the morning broke;\r\n   Such sounds of gladness filled all the air,\r\n   \'T was plain St. Nicholas had been there.\r\n\r\n6. In rushed Piccola, sweet, half wild--\r\n   Never was seen such a joyful child--\r\n   "See what the good saint brought!" she cried,\r\n   And mother and father must peep inside.\r\n\r\n7. Now such a story I never heard!\r\n   There was a little shivering bird!\r\n   A sparrow, that in at the window flew,\r\n   Had crept into Piccola\'s tiny shoe!\r\n\r\n8. "How good poor Piccola must have been!"\r\n   She cried, as happy as any queen,\r\n   While the starving sparrow she fed and warmed,\r\n   And danced with rapture, she was so charmed.\r\n\r\n9. Children, this story I tell to you\r\n   Of Piccola sweet and her bird, is true.\r\n   In the far-off land of France, they say,\r\n   Still do they live to this very day.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--3.

Charmed, greatly.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISES.--What is meant by "driving the wolf from the door"? In the\r\nthird stanza, what does "St." before Nicholas mean? Who is St. Nicholas?\r\nWhat did Piccola find in her shoe on Christmas morning?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIV. TRUE MANLINESS. (50)\r\n\r\nBy MRS. M. O. JOHNSON.--(ADAPTED.)\r\n\r\n1. "Please, mother, do sit down and let me try my hand," said Fred Liscom,\r\na bright, active boy twelve years old. Mrs. Liscom, looking pale and worn,\r\nwas moving languidly about, trying to clear away the breakfast she had\r\nscarcely tasted.\r\n\r\n2. She smiled, and said, "You, Fred, you wash dishes?" "Yes, indeed,\r\nmother," replied Fred; "I should be a poor scholar if I couldn\'t, when\r\nI\'ve seen you do it so many times. Just try me."\r\n\r\n3. A look of relief came over his mother\'s face as she seated herself in\r\nher low rocking-chair. Fred washed the dishes, and put them in the closet.\r\nHe then swept the kitchen, brought up the potatoes from the cellar for\r\nthe dinner and washed them, and then set out for school.\r\n\r\n4. Fred\'s father was away from home, and as there was some cold meat in\r\nthe pantry, Mrs. Liscom found it an easy task to prepare dinner. Fred\r\nhurried home from school, set the table, and again washed the dishes.\r\n\r\n5. He kept on in this way for two or three days, till his mother was able\r\nto resume her usual work, and he felt amply rewarded when the doctor, who\r\nhappened in one day, said, "Well, madam, it\'s my opinion that you would\r\nhave been very sick if you had not kept quiet."\r\n\r\n6. The doctor did not know how the "quiet" had been secured, nor how the\r\nboy\'s heart bounded at his words. Fred had given up a great deal of what\r\nboys hold dear, for the purpose of helping his mother, coasting and\r\nskating being just at this time in perfection.\r\n\r\n7. Besides this, his temper and his patience had been severely tried. He\r\nhad been in the habit of going early to school, and staying to play after\r\nit was dismissed.\r\n\r\n8. The boys missed him, and their curiosity was excited when he would give\r\nno other reason for not coming to school earlier, or staying after school,\r\nthan that he was a "wanted at home." "I\'ll tell you," said Tom Barton,\r\n"I\'ll find him out, boys--see if I don\'t!"\r\n\r\n9. So he called for Fred to go to school, and on his way to the side door\r\nwalked lightly and somewhat nearer the kitchen window than was absolutely\r\nneedful. Looking in, he saw Fred standing at the table with a dishcloth in\r\nhis hand.\r\n\r\n10. Of course he reported this at school, and various were the greetings\r\npoor Fred received at recess. "Well, you\'re a brave one to stay at home\r\nwashing dishes." "Girl boy!" "Pretty Bessie!" "Lost your apron, have n\'t\r\nyou, Polly!"\r\n\r\n11. Fred was not wanting either in spirit or courage, and he was strongly\r\ntempted to resent these insults and to fight some of his tormentors. But\r\nhis consciousness of right and his love for his mother helped him.\r\n\r\n12. While he was struggling for self mastery, his teacher appeared at the\r\ndoor of the schoolhouse. Fred caught his eye, and it seemed to look, if it\r\ndid not say, "Don\'t give up! Be really brave!" He knew the teacher had\r\nheard the insulting taunts of his thoughtless schoolmates.\r\n\r\n13. The boys received notice during the day that Fred must not be taunted\r\nor teased in any manner. They knew that the teacher meant what he said;\r\nand so the brave little boy had no farther trouble.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Lan\'guid-ly, feebly. 5. Am\'ply, fully. O-pin\'ion,\r\njudgment, belief. 9. Ab\'so-lute-ly, wholly, entirely. 11. Re-sent\', to\r\nconsider as an injury. Con\'scious-ness, inward feeling, knowledge of what\r\npasses in one\'s own mind.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISES.--Why did Fred offer to wash the dishes?\r\nWas it a disgraceful thing to do? How was he rewarded?\r\nHow did his schoolmates show their lack of manliness?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXV. TRUE MANLINESS. (52)\r\n(Concluded.)\r\n\r\n1. "Fire! fire!" The cry crept out on the still night air, and the fire\r\nbells began to ring. Fred was wakened by the alarm and the red light\r\nstreaming into his room. He dressed himself in a moment, almost, and\r\ntapped at the door of his mother\'s bedroom.\r\n\r\n2. "It is Mr. Barton\'s house, mother. Do let me go," he said in eager,\r\nexcited tones. Mrs. Liscom thought a moment. He was young, but she could\r\ntrust him, and she knew how much his heart was in the request.\r\n\r\n3. "Yes, you may go," she answered; "but be careful, my boy. If you can\r\nhelp, do so; but do nothing rashly." Fred promised to follow her advice,\r\nand hurried to the fire.\r\n\r\n4. Mr. and Mrs. Barton were not at home. The house had been left in charge\r\nof the servants. The fire spread with fearful speed, for there was a high\r\nwind, and it was found impossible to save the house. The servants ran\r\nabout, screaming and lamenting, but doing nothing to any purpose.\r\n\r\n5. Fred found Tom outside, in safety. "Where is Katy?" he asked. Tom,\r\ntrembling with terror, seemed to have had no thought but of his own\r\nescape. He said, "Katy is in the house!" "In what room?" asked Fred. "In\r\nthat one," pointing to a window in the upper story.\r\n\r\n6. It was no time for words, but for instant, vigorous action. The\r\nstaircase was already on fire; there was but one way to reach Katy, and\r\nthat full of danger. The second floor might fall at any moment, and Fred\r\nknew it. But he trusted in an arm stronger than his own, and silently\r\nsought help and guidance.\r\n\r\n7. A ladder was quickly brought, and placed against the house. Fred\r\nmounted it, followed by the hired man, dashed in the sash of the window,\r\nand pushed his way into the room where the poor child lay nearly\r\nsuffocated with smoke.\r\n\r\n8. He roused her with some difficulty, carried her to the window, and\r\nplaced her upon the sill. She was instantly grasped by strong arms, and\r\ncarried down the ladder, Fred following as fast as possible. They had\r\nscarcely reached the ground before a crash of falling timbers told them\r\nthat they had barely escaped with their lives.\r\n\r\n9. Tom Barton never forgot the lesson of that night; and he came to\r\nbelieve, and to act upon the belief, in after years, that true manliness\r\nis in harmony with gentleness, kindness, and self-denial.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISES.--Relate the story of the fire. What is meant\r\nby "to any purpose," in paragraph four? Did Fred show any\r\nlack of manliness when tested? What does this lesson teach?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVI. THE BROWN THRUSH. (54)\r\n\r\nLucy Larcom, the author of the following poem, was born in 1826, and\r\npassed many years of her life as a factory girl at Lowell, Mass. She died\r\nin 1893.\r\n\r\n1. There\'s a merry brown thrush sitting up in a tree;\r\n     "He\'s singing to me! he\'s singing to me!"\r\n   And what does he say, little girl, little boy?\r\n     "Oh, the world\'s running over with joy!\r\n       Don\'t You hear? Don\'t you see?\r\n         Hush! look! In my tree\r\n   I\'m as happy as happy can be!"\r\n\r\n2. And the brown thrush keeps singing, "A nest do you see,\r\n     And five eggs hid by me in the juniper tree?\r\n   Don\'t meddle! don\'t touch! little girl, little boy,\r\n     Or the world will lose some of its joy!\r\n       Now I\'m glad! now I\'m free!\r\n         And I always shall be,\r\n   If you never bring sorrow to me."\r\n\r\n3. So the merry brown thrush sings away in the tree,\r\n     To you and to me, to you and to me;\r\n   And he sings all the day, little girl, little boy,\r\n     "Oh, the world\'s running over with joy!\r\n       But long it won\'t be,\r\n         Don\'t you know? Don\'t you see?\r\n   Unless we\'re as good as can be."\r\n\r\nEXERCISES.--What is a thrush? Why was the thrush so\r\nhappy? Do you think he would have been happy if the little\r\nboy or girl had robbed the nest?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVII. A SHIP IN A STORM. (55)\r\n\r\n1. Did you ever go far out upon the great ocean?  How beautiful it is to\r\nbe out at sea, when the sea is smooth and still!\r\n\r\n2. Let a storm approach, and the scene is changed. The heavy, black clouds\r\nappear in the distance, and throw a deep, deathlike shade over the world\r\nof waters.\r\n\r\n3. The captain and sailors soon see in the clouds the signs of evil. All\r\nhands are then set to work to take in sail.\r\n\r\n4. The hoarse notes of the captain, speaking through his trumpet, are\r\nechoed from lip to lip among the rigging. Happy will it be, if all is made\r\nsnug before the gale strikes the vessel.\r\n\r\n5. At last, the gale comes like a vast moving mountain of air. It strikes\r\nthe ship. The vessel heaves and groans under the dreadful weight, and\r\nstruggles to escape through the foaming waters.\r\n\r\n6. If she is far out at sea, she will be likely to ride out the storm in\r\nsafety. But if the wind is driving her upon the shore, the poor sailors\r\nwill hardly escape being dashed upon the rocks, and drowned.\r\n\r\n7. Once there was a ship in a storm. Some of her masts were already\r\nbroken, and her sails lost. While the wind was raging, and the billows\r\nwere dashing against her, the cry was heard, "A man has fallen overboard!"\r\n\r\n8. Quickly was the boat lowered, and she was soon seen bounding on her way\r\nover the mountain waves. At one moment, the boat seemed lifted to the\r\nskies, and the next, it sank down, and appeared to be lost beneath the\r\nwaves!\r\n\r\n9. At length, the man was found. He was well nigh drowned; but he was\r\ntaken on board, and now they made for the ship. But the ship rolled so\r\ndreadfully, that it seemed certain death to go near her. And now, what\r\nshould they do?\r\n\r\n10. The captain told one of the men to go aloft and throw down a rope.\r\nThis was made fast to the boat, and when the sea was somewhat calm it was\r\nhoisted, and all fell down into the ship with a dreadful crash. It was a\r\ndesperate way of getting on board; but fortunately no lives were lost.\r\n\r\n11. On the dangerous points along our seacoast are lighthouses, which can\r\nbe seen far out at sea, and serve as guides to ships. Sometimes the fog is\r\nso dense that these lights can not be seen, but most lighthouses have\r\ngreat fog bells or fog horns; some of the latter are made to sound by\r\nsteam, and can be heard for a long distance. These bells and horns are\r\nkept sounding as long as the fog lasts.\r\n\r\n12. There are also many life-saving stations along the coast where trained\r\nmen are ready with lifeboats. "When a ship is driven ashore they at once\r\ngo to the rescue of those on board, and thus many valuable lives are\r\nsaved.\r\n\r\n13. Take it all in all, a sailor\'s life is a very hard one. Our young\r\nfriends owe a debt of gratitude to those whose home is upon the great\r\nwaters, and who bring them the luxuries of other countries.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--4. Ech\'oed, sounded again. Gale, a wind storm. 5. Heaves,\r\npitches up and down. 7. Bil\'lows, waves. 10. Des\'-per-ate, hopeless. 11.\r\nFog, watery vapor, mist. 13. Grat\'i-tude, thankfulness. Lux\'u-ries, nice\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISES.--What is this lesson about? When is it dangerous to be at sea?\r\nWhat do sailors then do? In what situation are they most likely to be\r\nsaved? Relate the story of the man overboard. Tell about the lighthouses.\r\nHow are vessels warned of danger in a fog? What about the life-saving\r\nstations? What is said of a sailor\'s life?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVIII. THE SAILOR\'S CONSOLATION. (58)\r\n\r\nCharles Dibdin, the author, was born at Southampton, England, in 1745. He\r\nwrote a number of fine sea songs. He died in 1814.\r\n\r\n1. One night came on a hurricane,\r\n   The sea was mountains rolling,\r\n   When Barney Buntline turned his quid,\r\n   And said to Billy Bowling:\r\n   "A strong norwester\'s blowing, Bill;\r\n   Hark! don\'t ye hear it roar now?\r\n   Lord help \'em, how I pities all\r\n   Unhappy folks on shore now!\r\n\r\n2. "Foolhardy chaps who live in town,\r\n   What danger they are all in,\r\n   And now are quaking in their beds,\r\n   For fear the roof shall fall in;\r\n   Poor creatures, how they envy us,\r\n   And wish, as I\'ve a notion,\r\n   For our good luck, in such a storm,\r\n   To be upon the ocean.\r\n\r\n3. "But as for them who\'re out all day,\r\n   On business from their houses,\r\n   And late at night are coming home,\r\n   To cheer the babes and spouses;\r\n   While you and I, Bill, on the deck,\r\n   Are comfortably lying,\r\n   My eyes! what tiles and chimney pots\r\n   About their heads are flying!\r\n\r\n4. "And very often have we heard\r\n   How men are killed and undone\r\n   By overturns of carriages,\r\n   By thieves, and fires in London.\r\n   We know what risks all landsmen run,\r\n   From noblemen to tailors;\r\n   Then, Bill, let us thank Providence\r\n   That you and I are sailors."\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.-l. Hur\'ri-cane, a violent windstorm. Quid, a small piece of\r\ntobacco. 2. Fool\'har\'dy, reckless. Quak\'ing, shak-ing with fear. No\'tion,\r\nidea. 3. Spous\'es, wives. Tiles, thin pieces of baked clay used in roofing\r\nhouses. Chim\'ney pots, earthenware tops of chimneys. 4. Un-done\', injured,\r\nruined.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--l. "Barney Buntline" and "Billy Bowling" are supposed to be two\r\nsailors. "Norwester" is a sailor\'s name for a northwest storm. 4.\r\n"Landsmen" is a term applied by sailors to all who live on shore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXIX. TWO WAYS OF TELLING A STORY. (60)\r\nBy HENRY K. OLIVER.\r\n\r\n1. In one of the most populous cities of New England, a few years ago, a\r\nparty of lads, all members of the same school, got up a grand sleigh ride.\r\nThe sleigh was a very large one, drawn by six gray horses.\r\n\r\n2. On the following day, as the teacher entered the schoolroom, he found\r\nhis pupils in high glee, as they chattered about the fun and frolic of\r\ntheir excursion. In answer to some inquiries, one of the lads gave him an\r\naccount of their trip and its various incidents.\r\n\r\n3. As he drew near the end of his story, he exclaimed: "Oh, sir! there was\r\none thing I had almost forgotten. As we were coming home, we saw ahead of\r\nus a queer looking affair in the road. It proved to be a rusty old sleigh,\r\nfastened behind a covered wagon, proceeding at a very slow rate, and\r\ntaking up the whole road.\r\n\r\n4. "Finding that the owner was not disposed to turn out, we determined\r\nupon a volley of snowballs and a good hurrah. They produced the right\r\neffect, for the crazy machine turned out into the deep snow, and the\r\nskinny old pony started on a full trot.\r\n\r\n5. "As we passed, some one gave the horse a good crack, which made him run\r\nfaster than he ever did before, I\'ll warrant.\r\n\r\n6. "With that, an old fellow in the wagon, who was buried up under an old\r\nhat, bawled out, \'Why do you frighten my horse?\'  \'Why don\'t you turn out,\r\nthen?\' says the driver. So we gave him three rousing cheers more. His\r\nhorse was frightened again, and ran up against a loaded wagon, and, I\r\nbelieve, almost capsized the old creature--and so we left him."\r\n\r\n7. "Well, boys," replied the teacher, "take your seat", and I will tell\r\nyou a story, and all about a sleigh ride, too. Yesterday afternoon a very\r\nvenerable old clergyman was on his way from Boston to Salem, to pass the\r\nrest of the winter at the house of his son. That he might be prepared for\r\njourneying in the following spring he took with him his wagon, and for the\r\nwinter his sleigh, which he fastened behind the wagon.\r\n\r\n8. "His sight and hearing were somewhat blunted by age, and he was\r\nproceeding very slowly; for his horse was old and feeble, like his owner.\r\nHe was suddenly disturbed by loud hurrahs from behind, and by a furious\r\npelting of balls of snow and ice upon the top of his wagon.\r\n\r\n9. "In his alarm he dropped his reins, and his horse began to run away. In\r\nthe midst of the old man\'s trouble, there rushed by him, with loud shouts,\r\na large party of boys, in a sleigh drawn by six horses. \'Turn out! turn\r\nout, old fellow!\' \'Give us the road!\' \'What will you take for your pony?\'\r\n\'What\'s the price of oats, old man?\' were the various cries that met his\r\ncars.\r\n\r\n10. "\'Pray, do not frighten my horse!\' exclaimed the infirm driver. \'Turn\r\nout, then! turn out!\' was the answer, which was followed by repeated\r\ncracks and blows from the long whip of the \'grand sleigh,\' with showers of\r\nsnowballs, and three tremendous hurrahs from the boys.\r\n\r\n11. "The terror of the old man and his horse was increased, and the latter\r\nran away with him, to the great danger of his life. He contrived, however,\r\nto stop his horse just in season to prevent his being dashed against a\r\nloaded wagon. A short distance brought him to the house of his son. That\r\nson, boys, is your instructor, and that \'old fellow,\' was your teacher\'s\r\nfather!"\r\n\r\n12. When the boys perceived how rude and unkind their conduct appeared\r\nfrom another point of view, they were very much ashamed of their\r\nthoughtlessness, and most of them had the manliness to apologize to their\r\nteacher for what they had done.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.-l. Pop\'u-lous, full of inhabitants. 2. Ex-cur\'-sion, a\r\npleasure trip. In\'ci-dents, things that happen, events. 5. War\'rant, to\r\ndeclare with assurance. 6. Cap-sized\', upset. 7. Ven\'er-a-ble, deserving\r\nof honor and respect. 8. Blunt\'ed, dulled.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISES.--Repeat the boys\' story of the sleigh ride. The teacher\'s\r\nstory. Were the boys ill-natured or only thoughtless? Is thoughtlessness\r\nany excuse for rudeness or unkindness?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXX. FREAKS OF THE FROST. (63)\r\n\r\nBy Hannah Flagg Gould, who was born at Lancaster, Vermont, in 1789. She\r\npublished several volumes of poems (one for children) and one collection\r\nof prose articles, entitled "Gathered Leaves." She died in 1865.\r\n\r\n1. The Frost looked forth one still, clear night,\r\n   And whispered, "Now I shall be out of sight;\r\n   So through the valley and over the height\r\n     In silence I\'ll take my way;\r\n   I will not go on, like that blustering train,\r\n   The wind and the snow, the hail and the rain,\r\n   Who make so much bustle and noise in vain,\r\n     But I\'ll be as busy as they."\r\n\r\n2. Then he flew to the mountain, and powdered its crest;\r\n   He lit on the trees, and their boughs he dressed\r\n   In diamond beads; and over the breast\r\n     Of the quivering lake, he spread\r\n   A coat of mail, that it need not fear\r\n   The downward point of many a spear,\r\n   That he hung on its margin, far and near,\r\n     Where a rock could rear its head.\r\n\r\n3. He went to the windows of those who slept,\r\n   And over each pane, like a fairy, crept;\r\n   Wherever he breathed, wherever he stepped,\r\n     By the light of the morn were seen\r\n   Most beautiful things; there were flowers and trees;\r\n   There were bevies of birds, and swarms of bees;\r\n   There were cities with temples and towers, and these\r\n     All pictured in silver sheen.\r\n\r\n4. But he did one thing that was hardly fair;\r\n   He peeped in the cupboard, and, finding there\r\n   That all had forgotten for him to prepare,\r\n     "Now just to set them a-thinking,\r\n   I\'ll bite this basket of fruit," said he,\r\n   "This costly pitcher I\'ll burst in three;\r\n   And the glass of water they\'ve left for me\r\n     Shall \'tchick!\' to tell them I\'m drinking."\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--l. Blus\'ter-ing, being noisy and loud. Bus\'tle, stir. 2.\r\nCrest, the top. Quiv\'er-ing, trembling, shaking. Mar\'gin, edge, border. 3.\r\nBev\'ies, flocks. Pic\'tured, painted. Sheen, brightness, splendor of\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISES.--What did the frost say? What did he do to the mountain? The\r\ntrees? The lake? What is a "coat of mail"? What did he do to the window?\r\nThe pitcher?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXI. WASTE NOT, WANT NOT. (64)\r\n\r\n1. Mr. Jones. Boys, if you have nothing to do, will you unpack these\r\nparcels for me?\r\n\r\n2. The two parcels were exactly alike, both of them well tied up with good\r\nwhipcord. Ben took his parcel to the table, and began to examine the knot,\r\nand then to untie it.\r\n\r\n3. John took the other parcel, and tried first at one corner, and then at\r\nthe other, to pull off the string. But the cord had been too well secured,\r\nand he only drew the knots tighter.\r\n\r\n4. John. I wish these people would not tie up their parcels so tightly, as\r\nif they were never to be undone. Why, Ben, how did you get yours undone?\r\nWhat is in your parcel? I wonder what is in mine! I wish I could get the\r\nstring off. I will cut it.\r\n\r\n5. Ben. Oh, no, do not cut it, John! Look, what a nice cord this is, and\r\nyours is the same. It is a pity to cut it.\r\n\r\n6. John. Pooh! what signifies a bit of pack thread?\r\n\r\n7. Ben. It is whipcord.\r\n\r\n8. John. Well, whipcord then! what signifies a bit of whipcord? You can\r\nget a piece of whipcord twice as long as that for three cents; and who\r\ncares for three cents? Not I, for one. So, here it goes.\r\n\r\n9. So he took out his knife, and cut it in several places.\r\n\r\n10. Mr. Jones. Well, my boys, have you undone the parcels for me?\r\n\r\n11. John. Yes, sir; here is the parcel.\r\n\r\n12. Ben. And here is my parcel, father, and here is also the string.\r\n\r\n13. Mr. Jones. You may keep the string, Ben.\r\n\r\n14. Ben. Thank you, sir. What excellent whipcord it is!\r\n\r\n15. Mr. Jones. And you, John, may keep your string, too, if it will be of\r\nany use to you.\r\n\r\n16. John. It will be of no use to me, thank you, sir.\r\n\r\n17.  Mr. Jones. No, I am afraid not, if this is it.\r\n\r\n18. A few weeks after this, Mr. Jones gave each of his sons a new top.\r\n\r\n19. John. How is this, Ben? These tops have no strings. What shall we do\r\nfor strings?\r\n\r\n20. Ben. I have a string that will do very well for mine. And he pulled it\r\nout of his pocket.\r\n\r\n21. John. Why, if that is not the whipcord! I wish I had saved mine.\r\n\r\n22. A few days afterward, there was a shooting match, with bows and\r\narrows, among the lads. The prize was a fine bow and arrows, to be given\r\nto the best marksman. "Come, come," said Master Sharp, "I am within one\r\ninch of the mark. I should like to see who will go nearer."\r\n\r\n23. John drew his bow, and shot. The arrow struck within a quarter of an\r\ninch of Master Sharp\'s. "Shoot away," said Sharp; "but you must understand\r\nthe rules. We settled them before you came. You are to have three shots\r\nwith your own arrows. Nobody is to borrow or lend. So shoot away."\r\n\r\n24. John seized his second arrow; "If I have any luck," said he;--but just\r\nas he pronounced the word "luck," the string broke, and the arrow fell\r\nfrom his hands.\r\n\r\n25.  Master Sharp. There! It is all over with you.\r\n\r\n26.  Ben. Here is my bow for him, and welcome.\r\n\r\n27. Master Sharp. No, no, sir; that is not fair.  Did you not hear the\r\nrules? There is to be no lending.\r\n\r\n28. It was now Ben\'s turn to make his trial. His first arrow missed the\r\nmark; the second was exactly as near as John\'s first. Before venturing the\r\nlast arrow, Ben very prudently examined the string of his bow; and, as he\r\npulled it to try its strength, it snapped.\r\n\r\n29. Master Sharp clapped his hands and danced for joy. But his dancing\r\nsuddenly ceased, when careful Ben drew out of his pocket an excellent\r\npiece of cord, and began to tie it to the bow.\r\n\r\n30. "The everlasting whipcord, I declare!" cried John. "Yes," said Ben, "I\r\nput it in my pocket today, because I thought I might want it."\r\n\r\n31. Ben\'s last arrow won the prize; and when the bow and arrows were\r\nhanded to him, John said, "How valuable that whipcord has been to you,\r\nBen. I\'ll take care how I waste anything hereafter."\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS,--2. Ex-am\'ine, to look at carefully. 6. Sig\'ni--fies, to be\r\nimportant. 22. Marks\'man, one who shoots well. 28. Pru\'dent-ly, with\r\nproper caution. 29. Ceased, stopped. 30. Ev--er-last\'ing, lasting always.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISES.--What is this lesson designed to teach? Which of the boys\r\npreserved his whipcord? What good did it do him? What did the other boy do\r\nwith his? What was the consequence? What did he learn from it?\r\n\r\nXXII. JEANNETTE AND JO. (67)\r\n\r\nBy Mary Mapes Dodge, who was born in New York City in 1838. She is the\r\neditor of the "St. Nicholas" magazine, and has written many stories for\r\nchildren.\r\n\r\n1. Two girls I know--Jeannette and Jo,\r\n   And one is always moping;\r\n   The other lassie, come what may,\r\n   Is ever bravely hoping.\r\n\r\n2. Beauty of face and girlish grace\r\n   Are theirs, for joy or sorrow;\r\n   Jeannette takes brightly every day,\r\n   And Jo dreads each to-morrow.\r\n\r\n3. One early morn they watched the dawn--\r\n   I saw them stand together;\r\n   Their whole day\'s sport, \'t was very plain,\r\n   Depended on the weather.\r\n\r\n4. "\'T will storm!" cried Jo. Jeannette spoke low;\r\n   "Yes, but \'t will soon be over."\r\n   And, as she spoke, the sudden shower\r\n   Came, beating down the clover.\r\n\r\n5. "I told you so!" cried angry Jo:\r\n   "It always is a-raining!"\r\n   Then hid her face in dire despair,\r\n   Lamenting and complaining.\r\n\r\n6. But sweet Jeannette, quite hopeful yet,--\r\n   I tell it to her honor,--\r\n   Looked up and waited till the sun\r\n   Came streaming in upon her.\r\n\r\n7. The broken clouds sailed off in crowds,\r\n   Across a sea of glory.\r\n   Jeannette and Jo ran, laughing, in--\r\n   Which ends my simple story.\r\n\r\n8. Joy is divine. Come storm, come shine,\r\n   The hopeful are the gladdest;\r\n   And doubt and dread, children, believe\r\n   Of all things are the saddest.\r\n\r\n9. In morning\'s light, let youth be bright;\r\n   Take in the sunshine tender;\r\n   Then, at the close, shall life\'s decline\r\n   Be full of sunset splendor.\r\n\r\n10. And ye who fret, try, like Jeannette,\r\n    To shun all weak complaining;\r\n   And not, like Jo, cry out too soon--\r\n   "It always is a-raining!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIII. THE LION. (69)\r\n\r\n1. The lion is often called the "king of beasts," His height varies from\r\nthree to four feet, and he is from six to nine feet long. His coat is of\r\nit yellowish brown or tawny color, and about his neck is a great shaggy\r\nmane which gives his head a majestic appearance.\r\n\r\n2. The strength of the lion is so great that he can easily crush the\r\nskulls of such animals as the horse or ox with one blow of his paw. No one\r\nwho has not seen the teeth of a full grown lion taken out of their sockets\r\ncan have any idea of their real size; one of them forms a good handful,\r\nand might easily be mistaken for a small elephant\'s tooth.\r\n\r\n3. The home of the lion is in the forests of Asia and Africa, where he is\r\na terror to man and beast. He generally lies concealed during the day, but\r\nas darkness comes on he prowls about where other animals are accustomed to\r\ngo for food or drink, and springs upon them unawares, with a roar that\r\nsounds like the rumble of thunder.\r\n\r\n4. The lion sometimes lives to a great age. One by the name of Pompey died\r\nat London, in the year 1760, at the age of seventy years. If taken when\r\nyoung the lion can be tamed, and will even show marks of kindness to his\r\nkeeper.\r\n\r\n5. In a menagerie at Brussels, there was a cell where a large lion, called\r\nDanco, used to be kept. The cell happened to be in need of repair, and the\r\nkeeper, whose name was William, desired a carpenter to come and mend it.\r\nThe carpenter came, but was so afraid of the lion, that he would not go\r\nnear the cell alone.\r\n\r\n6. So William entered the cell, and led the lion to the upper part of it,\r\nwhile the other part was refitting. He played with the lion for some time;\r\nbut, at last, being wearied, both he and the lion fell asleep. The\r\ncarpenter went on with his work, and when he had finished he called out\r\nfor William to come and see it.\r\n\r\n7. He called again and again, but no William answered. The poor carpenter\r\nbegan to be frightened, lest the lion had made his dinner of the keeper,\r\nor else crushed him with his great paws. He crept round to the upper part\r\nof the cell, and there, looking through the railing, he saw the lion and\r\nWilliam sleeping side by side as contentedly as two little brothers.\r\n\r\n8. He was so astonished that he uttered a loud cry. The lion, awakened by\r\nthe noise, stared at the carpenter with an eye of fury, and then placing\r\nhis paw on the breast of his keeper, as if to say, "Touch him if you\r\ndare," the heroic beast lay down to sleep again. The carpenter was\r\ndreadfully alarmed, and, not knowing how he could rouse William, he ran\r\nout and related what he had seen.\r\n\r\n9. Some people came, and, opening the door of the cell, Contrived to\r\nawaken the keeper, who, rubbing his eyes, quietly looked around him, and\r\nexpressed himself very well satisfied with his nap. He took the lion\'s\r\npaw, shook it kindly, and then retired uninjured from the cell.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--l. Ma-jes\'tic, royal, noble. 3. Prowls, wanders in search of\r\nprey.  Un-a-wares\', unexpectedly. Rum\'ble, a low heavy sound. 5.\r\nMen-ag\'er-ie, a collection of wild animals. 6. Re-fit\'ting, repairing. 8.\r\nHe-ro\'-ic, bold.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISES.--Describe the lion\'s appearance. What is said of his strength?\r\nHis teeth? Describe the lion\'s home and habits. To what age do lions live?\r\nCan they be tamed? Relate the story about the lion Danco.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIV. STRAWBERRIES. (71)\r\n\r\nBy John Townsend Trowbridge, who was born at Ogden, N. Y., in 1827. He is\r\na well-known author, and has written much for children both in poetry and\r\nprose.\r\n\r\n1. Little Pearl Honeydew, six years old,\r\n   From her bright ear parted the curls of gold;\r\n   And laid her head on the strawberry bed,\r\n   To hear what the red-cheeked berries said.\r\n\r\n2. Their cheeks were blushing, their breath was sweet,\r\n   She could almost hear their little hearts beat;\r\n   And the tiniest, lisping, whispering sound\r\n   That ever you heard, came up from the ground.\r\n\r\n3. "Little friends," she said, "I wish I knew\r\n   How it is you thrive on sun and dew!"\r\n   And this is the story the berries told\r\n   To little Pearl Honeydew, six years old.\r\n\r\n4. "You wish you knew? And so do we.\r\n   But we can\'t tell you, unless it be\r\n   That the same Kind Power that cares for you\r\n   Takes care of poor little berries, too.\r\n\r\n5. "Tucked up snugly, and nestled below\r\n   Our coverlid of wind-woven snow,\r\n   We peep and listen, all winter long,\r\n   For the first spring day and the bluebird\'s song.\r\n\r\n6. "When the swallows fly home to the old brown shed,\r\n   And the robins build on the bough overhead,\r\n   Then out from the mold, from the darkness and cold,\r\n   Blossom and runner and leaf unfold.\r\n\r\n7. "Good children, then, if they come near,\r\n   And hearken a good long while, may hear\r\n   A wonderful tramping of little feet,--\r\n   So fast we grow in the summer heat.\r\n\r\n8. "Our clocks are the flowers; and they count the hours\r\n   Till we can mellow in suns and showers,\r\n   With warmth of the west wind and heat of the south,\r\n   A ripe red berry for a ripe red month.\r\n\r\n9. "Apple blooms whiten, and peach blooms fall,\r\n   And roses are gay by the garden wall,\r\n   Ere the daisy\'s dial gives the sign\r\n   That we may invite little Pearl to dine.\r\n\r\n10. "The days are longest, the month is June,\r\n    The year is nearing its golden noon,\r\n    The weather is fine, and our feast is spread\r\n    With a green cloth and berries red.\r\n\r\n11. "Just take us betwixt your finger and thumb,\r\n    And quick, oh, quick! for, see! there come\r\n    Tom on all fours, and Martin the man,\r\n    And Margaret, picking as fast as they can.\r\n\r\n12. "Oh, dear! if you only knew how it shocks\r\n    Nice berries like us to be sold by the box,\r\n    And eaten by strangers, and paid for with pelf,\r\n    You would surely take pity, and eat us yourself!"\r\n\r\n13. And this is the story the small lips told\r\n    To dear Pearl Honeydew, six years old,\r\n    When she laid her head on the strawberry bed\r\n    To hear what the red-cheeked berries said.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--3. Thrive, to grow well, to flourish. 5. Nes\'tled, gathered\r\nclosely together. 6. Mold, fine, soft earth. Run\'ner, a slender branch\r\nrunning along the ground. 8. Mel\'low, to ripen. 9. Di\'al, the face of a\r\ntimepiece. 10. Feast, a festive or joyous meal, a banquet. 12. Pelf,\r\nmoney.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISES.--What did little Pearl ask of the strawberries? What did they\r\nreply? Can you tell what name is given to this kind of story?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXVV. HARRY\'S RICHES. (74)\r\n\r\n1. One day, our little Harry spent the morning with his young playmate,\r\nJohnny Crane, who lived in a fine house, and on Sundays rode to church in\r\nthe grandest carriage to be seen in all the country round.\r\n\r\n2. When Harry returned home, he said, "Mother, Johnny has money in both\r\npockets!"\r\n\r\n3.  "Has he, dear?"\r\n\r\n4. "Yes, ma\'am; and he says he could get ever so much more if he wanted\r\nit."\r\n\r\n5. "Well, now, that\'s very pleasant for him," I returned, cheerfully, as a\r\nreply was plainly expected. "Very pleasant; don\'t you think so?"\r\n\r\n6.  "Yes, ma\'am; only--"\r\n\r\n7.  "Only what, Harry?"\r\n\r\n8. "Why, he has a big popgun, and a watch, and a hobbyhorse, and lots of\r\nthings." And Harry looked up at my face with a disconsolate stare.\r\n\r\n9. "Well, my boy, what of that?"\r\n\r\n10. "Nothing, mother," and the telltale tears sprang to his eyes, "only I\r\nguess we are very poor, aren\'t we?"\r\n\r\n11. "No, indeed, Harry, we are very far from being poor. We are not so\r\nrich as Mr. Crane\'s family, if that is what you mean."\r\n\r\n12. "O mother!" insisted the little fellow, "I do think we are very poor;\r\nanyhow, I am!"\r\n\r\n13.  "O Harry!" I exclaimed, reproachfully.\r\n\r\n14. "Yes, ma\'am I am," he sobbed; "I have scarcely any thing--I mean\r\nanything that\'s worth money--except things to eat and wear, and I\'d have\r\nto have them anyway."\r\n\r\n15. "Have to have them?" I echoed, at the same time laying my sewing upon\r\nthe table, so that I might reason with him on that point; "do you not\r\nknow, my son--"\r\n\r\n16. Just then Uncle Ben looked up from the paper he had been reading:\r\n"Harry," said he, "I want to find out something about eyes; so, if you\r\nwill let me have yours, I will give you a dollar apiece for them."\r\n\r\n17. "For my eyes!" exclaimed Harry, very much astonished.\r\n\r\n18. "Yes," resumed Uncle Ben, quietly, "for your eyes. I will give you\r\nchloroform, so it will not hurt you in the least, and you shall have a\r\nbeautiful glass pair for nothing, to wear in their place. Come, a dollar\r\napiece, cash down! What do you say? I will take them out as quick as a\r\nwink."\r\n\r\n19. "Give you my eyes, uncle!" cried Harry, looking wild at the very\r\nthought, "I think not." And the startled little fellow shook his head\r\ndefiantly.\r\n\r\n20. "Well, five, ten, twenty dollars, then." Harry shook his head at every\r\noffer.\r\n\r\n21. "No, sir! I wouldn\'t let you have them for a thousand dollars! What\r\ncould I do without my eyes? I couldn\'t see mother, nor the baby, nor the\r\nflowers, nor the horses, nor anything," added Harry, growing warmer and\r\nwarmer.\r\n\r\n22. "I will give you two thousand," urged Uncle Ben, taking a roll of bank\r\nnotes out of his pocket. Harry, standing at a respectful distance, shouted\r\nthat he never would do any such thing.\r\n\r\n23. "Very well," continued the uncle, with a serious air, at the same time\r\nwriting something in his notebook, "I can\'t afford to give you more than\r\ntwo thousand dollars, so I shall have to do without your eyes; but," he\r\nadded, "I will tell you what I will do, I will give you twenty dollars if\r\nyou will let me put a few drops from this bottle in your ears. It will not\r\nhurt, but it will make you deaf. I want to try some experiments with\r\ndeafness, you see. Come quickly, now! Here are the twenty dollars all\r\nready for you."\r\n\r\n24. "Make me deaf!" shouted Harry, without even looking at the gold pieces\r\ntemptingly displayed upon the table. "I guess you will not do that,\r\neither. Why, I couldn\'t hear a single word if I were deaf, could I?"\r\n\r\n25. "Probably not," replied Uncle Ben. So, of course, Harry refused again.\r\nHe would never give up his hearing, he said, "no, not for three thousand\r\ndollars."\r\n\r\n26. Uncle Ben made another note in his book, and  then came out with large\r\nbids for "a right arm," then "left arm," "hands," "feet," "nose," finally\r\nending with an offer of ten thousand dollars for "mother," and five\r\nthousand for "the baby."\r\n\r\n27. To all of these offers Harry shook his head, his eyes flashing, and\r\nexclamations of surprise and indignation bursting from his lips. At last,\r\nUncle Ben said he must give up his experiments, for Harry\'s prices were\r\nentirely too high.\r\n\r\n28. "Ha! ha!" laughed the boy, exultingly, and he folded his dimpled arms\r\nand looked as if to say, "I\'d like to see the man who could pay them!"\r\n\r\n29. "Why, Harry, look here!" exclaimed Uncle Ben, peeping into his\r\nnotebook, "here is a big addition sum, I tell you!" He added the numbers,\r\nand they amounted to thirty-two thousand dollars.\r\n\r\n30. "There, Harry," said Uncle Ben, "don\'t you think you are foolish not\r\nto accept some of my offers?" "No, sir, I don\'t," answered Harry,\r\nresolutely. "Then," said Uncle Ben, "you talk of being poor, and by your\r\nown showing you have treasures for which you will not take thirty-two\r\nthousand dollars. What do you say to that?"\r\n\r\n31. Harry didn\'t know exactly what to say. So he blushed for a second, and\r\njust then tears came rolling down his cheeks, and he threw his chubby arms\r\naround my neck. "Mother," he whispered, "isn\'t God good to make everybody\r\nso rich?"\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--8. Dis-con\'so-late, filled with grief. 13.\r\nRe-proach\'ful-ly, with censure or reproof. 18. Chlo\'re-form, an oily\r\nliquid, the vapor of which causes insensibility. 19. Startled, shocked.\r\nDe-fi\'ant-ly, daringly. 23. Af-ford\', to be able to pay for.\r\nEx-per\'i-ments, acts performed to discover some truth. 27.\r\nEx-cla-ma\'tions, expressions of surprise, anger, etc. 28. Ex-ult\'ing-ly,\r\nin a triumphant manner. 30. Treas\'ures, things which are very much valued.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVI. IN TIME\'S SWING. (77)\r\n\r\nBy Lucy Larcom.\r\n\r\n1. Father Time, your footsteps go\r\n   Lightly as the falling snow.\r\n   In your swing I\'m sitting, see!\r\n   Push me softly; one, two; three,\r\n   Twelve times only. Like a sheet,\r\n   Spread the snow beneath my feet.\r\n   Singing merrily, let me swing\r\n   Out of winter into spring.\r\n\r\n2. Swing me out, and swing me in!\r\n   Trees are bare, but birds begin\r\n   Twittering to the peeping leaves,\r\n   On the bough beneath the eaves.\r\n   Wait,--one lilac bud I saw.\r\n   Icy hillsides feel the thaw.\r\n   April chased off March to-day;\r\n   Now I catch a glimpse of May.\r\n\r\n3. Oh, the smell of sprouting grass!\r\n   In a blur the violets pass.\r\n   Whispering from the wildwood come\r\n   Mayflower\'s breath and insect\'s hum.\r\n   Roses carpeting the ground;\r\n   Thrushes, orioles, warbling sound:--\r\n   Swing me low, and swing me high,\r\n   To the warm clouds of July.\r\n\r\n4. Slower now, for at my side\r\n   White pond lilies open wide.\r\n   Underneath the pine\'s tall spire\r\n   Cardinal blossoms burn like fire.\r\n   They are gone; the golden-rod\r\n   Flashes from the dark green sod.\r\n   Crickets in the grass I hear;\r\n   Asters light the fading year.\r\n\r\n5. Slower still! October weaves\r\n   Rainbows of the forest leaves.\r\n   Gentians fringed, like eyes of blue,\r\n   Glimmer out of sleety dew.\r\n   Meadow green I sadly miss:\r\n   Winds through withered sedges hiss.\r\n   Oh, \'t is snowing, swing me fast,\r\n   While December shivers past!\r\n\r\n6. Frosty-bearded Father Time,\r\n   Stop your footfall on the rime!\r\n   Hard you push, your hand is rough;\r\n   You have swung me long enough.\r\n   "Nay, no stopping," say you? Well,\r\n   Some of your best stories tell,\r\n   While you swing me--gently, do!--\r\n   From the Old Year to the New.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--2. Twit\'ter-ing, making a succession of small, chirping\r\nnoises. Glimpse, a short, hurried view. 3. Blur, a dim, confused\r\nappearance. 6. Rime, whitefrost, hoarfrost.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVII. HARRY AND HIS DOG. (79)\r\n\r\n1. "Beg, Frisk, beg," said little Harry, as he sat on an inverted basket,\r\nat his grandmother\'s door, eating, with great satisfaction, a porringer of\r\nbread and milk. His little sister Annie, who had already dispatched her\r\nbreakfast, sat on the ground opposite to him, now twisting her flowers\r\ninto garlands, and now throwing them away.\r\n\r\n2. "Beg, Frisk, beg!" repeated Harry, holding a bit of bread just out of\r\nthe dog\'s reach; and the obedient Frisk squatted himself on his hind legs,\r\nand held up his fore paws, waiting for master Harry to give him the\r\ntempting morsel.\r\n\r\n3. The little boy and the little dog were great friends. Frisk loved him\r\ndearly, much better than he did anyone else; perhaps, because he\r\nrecollected that Harry was his earliest and firmest friend during a time\r\nof great trouble.\r\n\r\n4. Poor Frisk had come as a stray dog to Milton, the place where Harry\r\nlived. If he could have told his own story, it would probably have been a\r\nvery pitiful one, of kicks and cuffs, of hunger and foul weather.\r\n\r\n5. Certain it is, he made his appearance at the very door where Harry was\r\nnow sitting, in miserable plight, wet, dirty, and half starved; and that\r\nthere he met Harry, who took a fancy to him, and Harry\'s grandmother, who\r\ndrove him off with a broom.\r\n\r\n6. Harry, at length, obtained permission for the little dog to remain as a\r\nsort of outdoor pensioner, and fed him with stray bones and cold potatoes,\r\nand such things as he could get for him. He also provided him with a\r\nlittle basket to sleep in, the very same which, turned up, afterward\r\nserved Harry for a seat.\r\n\r\n7. After a while, having proved his good qualities by barking away a set\r\nof pilferers, who were making an attack on the great pear tree, he was\r\nadmitted into the house, and became one of its most vigilant and valued\r\ninmates. He could fetch or carry either by land or water; would pick up a\r\nthimble or a ball of cotton, if little Annie should happen to drop them;\r\nor take Harry\'s dinner to school for him with perfect honesty.\r\n\r\n8. "Beg, Frisk, beg!" said Harry, and gave him, after long waiting, the\r\nexpected morsel. Frisk was satisfied, but Harry was not. The little boy,\r\nthough a good-humored fellow in the main, had turns of naughtiness, which\r\nwere apt to last him all day, and this promised to prove one of his worst.\r\nIt was a holiday, and in the afternoon his cousins, Jane and William, were\r\nto come and see him and Annie; and the pears were to be gathered, and the\r\nchildren were to have a treat.\r\n\r\n9. Harry, in his impatience, thought the morning would never be over. He\r\nplayed such pranks--buffeting Frisk, cutting the curls off of Annie\'s\r\ndoll, and finally breaking his grandmother\'s spectacles--that before his\r\nvisitors arrived, indeed, almost immediately after dinner, he contrived to\r\nbe sent to bed in disgrace.\r\n\r\n10. Poor Harry! there he lay, rolling and kicking, while Jane, and\r\nWilliam, and Annie were busy about the fine, mellow Windsor pears. William\r\nwas up in the tree, gathering and shaking; Annie and Jane catching them in\r\ntheir aprons, and picking them up from the ground; now piling them in\r\nbaskets, and now eating the nicest and ripest; while Frisk was barking\r\ngayly among them, as if he were catching Windsor pears, too!\r\n\r\n11. Poor Harry! He could hear all this glee and merriment through the open\r\nwindow as he lay in bed. The storm of passion having subsided, there he\r\nlay weeping and disconsolate, a grievous sob bursting forth every now and\r\nthen, as he heard the loud peals of childish laughter, and as he thought\r\nhow he should have laughed, and how happy he should have been, had he not\r\nforfeited all this pleasure by his own bad conduct.\r\n\r\n12. He wondered if Annie would not be so good-natured as to bring him a\r\npear. All on a sudden, he heard a little foot on the stair, pitapat, and\r\nhe thought she was coming. Pitapat came the foot, nearer and nearer, and\r\nat last a small head peeped, half afraid, through the half-open door.\r\n\r\n13. But it was not Annie\'s head; it was Frisk\'s--poor Frisk, whom Harry\r\nhad been teasing and tormenting all the morning, and who came into the\r\nroom wagging his tail, with a great pear in his mouth; and, jumping upon\r\nthe bed, He laid it in the little boy\'s hand.\r\n\r\n14. Is not Frisk a fine, grateful fellow? and does he not deserve a share\r\nof Harry\'s breakfast, whether he begs for it or not? And little Harry will\r\nremember from the events of this day that kindness, even though shown to a\r\ndog, will always be rewarded; and that ill nature and bad temper are\r\nconnected with nothing but pain and disgrace.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--l. In-vert\'ed, turned upside down. Por\'rin-ger, a small\r\nmetallic dish. 3. Rec-ol-lect\'ed, brought back to mind. 5. Plight,\r\ncondition. 6. Pen\'sion-er, one who is supported by others. 7. Pil\'fer-ers,\r\nthose who steal little things. Vig\'i-lant, watchful. Intimates, those\r\nliving in the same house. 8. Holiday, a day of amusement. 9. Buf\'fet-ing,\r\nstriking with the hand. 11. Sub-sid\'ed, become quiet. For\'feit-ed, lost.\r\n14. Con-nect\'ed, united, have a close relation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXVIII. THE VOICE OF THE GRASS. (83)\r\nBy Sarah Roberts.\r\n\r\n1. Here  I come, creeping, creeping, everywhere;\r\n       By the dusty roadside,\r\n       On the sunny hillside,\r\n       Close by the noisy brook,\r\n       In every shady nook,\r\n   I come creeping, creeping, everywhere.\r\n\r\n2. Here I come, creeping, creeping everywhere;\r\n       All round the open door,\r\n       Where sit the aged poor,\r\n       Here where the children play,\r\n       In the bright and merry May,\r\n   I come creeping, creeping, everywhere.\r\n\r\n3. Here I come, creeping, creeping, everywhere;\r\n       You can not see me coming,\r\n       Nor hear my low, sweet humming,\r\n       For in the starry night,\r\n       And the glad morning light,\r\n   I come, quietly creeping, everywhere.\r\n\r\n4. Here I come, creeping, creeping, everywhere;\r\n       More welcome than the flowers,\r\n       In summer\'s pleasant hours;\r\n       The gentle cow is glad,\r\n       And the merry birds not sad,\r\n   To see me creeping, creeping, everywhere.\r\n\r\n5. Here I come, creeping, creeping, everywhere;\r\n       When you\'re numbered with the dead,\r\n       In your still and narrow bed,\r\n       In the happy spring I\'ll come,\r\n       And deck your narrow home,\r\n   Creeping, silently creeping, everywhere.\r\n\r\n6. Here I come, creeping, creeping, everywhere;\r\n       My humble song of praise,\r\n       Most gratefully I raise,\r\n       To Him at whose command\r\n       I beautify the land,\r\n   Creeping, silently creeping, everywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXIX. THE EAGLE. (84)\r\n\r\n1. The eagle seems to enjoy a kind of supremacy over the rest of the\r\ninhabitants of the air. Such is the loftiness of his flight, that he often\r\nsoars in the sky beyond the reach of the naked eye, and such is his\r\nstrength that he has been known to carry away children in his talons. But\r\nmany of the noble qualities imputed to him are rather fanciful than true.\r\n\r\n2. He has been described as showing a lofty independence, which makes him\r\ndisdain to feed on anything that is not slain by his own strength. But\r\nAlexander Wilson, the great naturalist, says that he has seen an eagle\r\nfeasting on the carcass of a horse. The eagle lives to a great age. One at\r\nVienna is stated to have died after a confinement of one hundred and four\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n3. There are several species of the eagle. The golden eagle, which is one\r\nof the largest, is nearly four feet from the point of the beak to the end\r\nof the tail. He is found in most parts of Europe, and is also met with in\r\nAmerica. High rocks and ruined and lonely towers are the places which he\r\nchooses for his abode. His nest is composed of sticks and rushes. The tail\r\nfeathers are highly valued as ornaments by the American Indians.\r\n\r\n4. The most interesting species is the bald eagle, as this is an American\r\nbird, and the adopted emblem of our country. He lives chiefly upon fish,\r\nand is found in the neighborhood of the sea, and along the shores and\r\ncliffs of our large lakes and rivers.\r\n\r\n5. According to the description given by Wilson, he depends, in procuring\r\nhis food, chiefly upon the labors of others. He watches the fish hawk as\r\nhe dives into the sea for his prey, and darting down upon him as he rises,\r\nforces him to relinquish his victim, and then seizes it before it again\r\nreaches the water.\r\n\r\n6. One of the most notable species is the harpy eagle. This is said to be\r\nbold and strong, and to attack beasts, and even man himself. He is fierce,\r\nquarrelsome, and sullen, living alone in the deepest forests. He is found\r\nchiefly in South America.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXX. THE OLD EAGLE TREE. (86)\r\n\r\n1. In a distant field, stood a large tulip tree, apparently of a century\'s\r\ngrowth, and one of the most gigantic. It looked like the father of the\r\nsurrounding forest. A single tree of huge dimensions, standing all alone,\r\nis a sublime object.\r\n\r\n2. On the top of this tree, an old eagle, commonly called the "Fishing\r\nEagle," had built her nest every year, for many years, and, undisturbed,\r\nhad raised her young. A remarkable place to choose, as she procured her\r\nfood from the ocean, and this tree stood full ten miles from the seashore.\r\nIt had long been known as the "Old Eagle Tree."\r\n\r\n3. On a warm, sunny day, the workmen were hoeing corn in an adjoining\r\nfield. At a certain hour of the day, the old eagle was known to set off\r\nfor the seaside, to gather food for her young. As she this day returned\r\nwith a large fish in her claws, the workmen surrounded the tree, and, by\r\nyelling and hooting, and throwing stones, so scared the poor bird that she\r\ndropped her fish, and they carried it off in triumph.\r\n\r\n4. The men soon dispersed, but Joseph sat down under a hush near by, to\r\nwatch, and to bestow unavailing pity. The bird soon returned to her nest,\r\nwithout food. The eaglets at once set up a cry for food, so shrill, so\r\nclear, and so clamorous that the boy was greatly moved.\r\n\r\n5. The parent bird seemed to try to soothe them; but their appetites were\r\ntoo keen, and it was all in vain. She then perched herself on a limb near\r\nthem, and looked down into the nest in a manner that seemed to say, "I\r\nknow not what to do next."\r\n\r\n6. Her indecision was but momentary; again she poised herself, uttered one\r\nor two sharp notes, as if telling them to a "lie still," balanced her\r\nbody, spread her wings, and was away again for the sea.\r\n\r\n7. Joseph was determined to see the result. His eye followed her till she\r\ngrew small, smaller, a mere speck in the sky, and then disappeared. What\r\nboy has not thus watched the flight of the bird of his country!\r\n\r\n8. She was gone nearly two hours, about double her usual time for a\r\nvoyage, when she again returned, on a slow, weary wing, flying uncommonly\r\nlow, in order to have a heavier atmosphere to sustain her, with another\r\nfish in her talons.\r\n\r\n9. On nearing the field, she made a circuit round it, to see if her\r\nenemies were again there. Finding the coast clear, she once more reached\r\nthe tree, drooping, faint, and weary, and evidently nearly exhausted.\r\nAgain the eaglets set up their cry, which was soon hushed by the\r\ndistribution of a dinner, such as, save the cooking, a king might admire.\r\n\r\n10. "Glorious bird!" cried the boy, "what a spirit!" Other birds can fly\r\nmore swiftly, others can sing more sweetly, others scream more loudly; but\r\nwhat other bird, when persecuted and robbed, when weary, when discouraged,\r\nwhen so far from the sea, would do this?\r\n\r\n11. "Glorious bird! I will learn a lesson from thee to-day. I will never\r\nforget, hereafter, that when the spirit is determined it can do almost\r\nanything. Others would have drooped, and hung the head, and mourned over\r\nthe cruelty of man, and sighed over the wants of the nestlings; but thou,\r\nby at once recovering the loss, hast forgotten all."\r\n\r\n12. "I will learn of thee, noble bird! I will remember this. I will set my\r\nmark high. I will try to do something, and to be something in the world; I\r\nwill never yield to discouragements."\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--l. Cen\'tu-ry, the space of a hundred years.

ALPINE SONG. (88)\r\nWilliam W. Story, the author, was born in Salem, Mass.,\r\n\r\nIn 1819. His writings in poetry and prose are well known, and he also\r\ngained distinction in his profession as a sculptor. He died in 1895.\r\n\r\n1. With alpenstock and knapsack light,\r\n     I wander o\'er hill and valley;\r\n   I climb the snow peak\'s flashing height,\r\n     And sleep in the sheltered chalet,--\r\n   Free in heart--happy and free--\r\n   This is the summer life for me.\r\n\r\n2. The city\'s dust I leave behind\r\n     For the keen, sweet air of the mountain,\r\n   The grassy path by the wild rose lined,\r\n     The gush of the living fountain,--\r\n   Free in heart--happy and free--\r\n   This is the summer life for me.\r\n\r\n3. High above me snow clouds rise,\r\n     In the early morning gleaming;\r\n   And the patterned valley beneath me lies\r\n     Softly in sunshine dreaming,--\r\n   Free in heart--happy and free--\r\n   This is the summer life for me.\r\n\r\n4. The bells of wandering herds I list,\r\n     Chiming in upland meadows;\r\n   How sweet they sound, as I lie at rest\r\n     Under the dark pine shadows--\r\n   Glad in heart--happy and free--\r\n   This is the summer life for me.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--l.

(89)\r\n\r\n1. Derby. Good morning, neighbor Scrapewell. I have half a dozen miles to\r\nride to-day, and shall be extremely obliged if you will lend me your gray\r\nmare.\r\n\r\n2. Scrapewell. It would give me great pleasure to oblige you, friend\r\nDerby; but I am under the necessity of going to the mill this very\r\nmorning, with a bag of corn. My wife wants the meal to-day, and you know\r\nwhat a time there\'ll be if I disappoint her.\r\n\r\n3. D. Then she must want it still, for I can assure you the mill does not\r\ngo to-day. I heard the miller tell Will Davis that the water was too low.\r\n\r\n4. S. You don\'t say so! That is bad, indeed; for in that case I shall be\r\nobliged to gallop off to town for the meal. My wife would comb my head for\r\nme if I should neglect it.\r\n\r\n5. D. I can save you this journey, for I have plenty of meal at home, and\r\nwill lend your wife as much as she wants.\r\n\r\n6. S. Ah! neighbor Derby, I am sure your meal would never suit my wife.\r\nYou can\'t conceive how whimsical she is.\r\n\r\n7. D. If she were ten times more whimsical than she is, I\r\nam certain she would like it; for you sold it to me yourself,\r\nand you assured me it was the best you ever had.\r\n\r\n8. S. Yes, yes! that\'s true, indeed; I always have the best of\r\neverything. You know, neighbor Derby, that no one is more\r\nready to oblige a friend than I am; but I must tell you the\r\nmare this morning refused to eat hay; and, truly, I am afraid\r\nshe will not carry you.\r\n\r\n9. D. Oh, never fear! I will feed her well with oats on the road.\r\n\r\n10.  S. Oats! neighbor; oats are very dear.\r\n\r\n11. D. Never mind that. When I have a good job in view, I never stand for\r\ntrifles.\r\n\r\n12. S. But it is very slippery; and I am really afraid she will fall and\r\nbreak your neck.\r\n\r\n13. D. Give yourself no uneasiness about that. The mare is certainly\r\nsure-footed; and, besides, you were just now talking of galloping her to\r\ntown.\r\n\r\n14. S. Well, then, to tell you the plain truth, though I wish to oblige\r\nyou with all my heart, my saddle is torn quite in pieces, and I have just\r\nsent my bridle to be mended.\r\n\r\n15. D. Luckily, I have both a bridle and a saddle hanging up at home.\r\n\r\n16. S. Ah! that may be; but I am sure your saddle will never fit my mare.\r\nShe\'s very notional.\r\n\r\n17. D. Why, then I\'ll borrow neighbor Clodpole\'s.\r\n\r\n18. S. Clodpole\'s! his will no more fit than yours.\r\n\r\n19. D. At the worst, then, I will go to my good friend, Squire Jones. He\r\nhas half a score of them; and I am sure he will lend me one that will fit\r\nher.\r\n\r\n20. S. You know, friend Derby, that no one is more willing to oblige his\r\nneighbors than I am. I do assure you the beast should be at your service,\r\nwith all my heart; but she has not been curried, I believe, for three\r\nweeks past. Her foretop and mane want combing and cutting very much. If\r\nanyone should see her in her present plight, it would ruin the sale of\r\nher.\r\n\r\n21. D. Oh, a horse is soon curried, and my son Sam shall attend to it at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\n22. S. Yes, very likely; but I this moment recollect the creature has no\r\nshoes on.\r\n\r\n23. D. Well, is there not a blacksmith hard by?\r\n\r\n24. S. What, that tinker, Dobson? I would not trust such a bungler to\r\nshoe a goat. No, no; none but uncle Tom Thumper shall shoe my mare.\r\n\r\n25. D. As good luck will have it, then, I shall pass right by his door.\r\n\r\n26. S. [Calling to his son.] Tim, Tim! here\'s neighbor Derby, who wants\r\nthe loan of the gray mare, to ride to town to-day. You know the skin was\r\nrubbed off her back, last week, a hand\'s breadth or more. [Gives Tim a\r\nwink.] However, I believe she is well enough by this time. You know, Tim,\r\nhow ready I am to oblige my neighbors; indeed, we ought to do all the good\r\nwe can in this world. We must certainly let neighbor Derby have her if she\r\nwill possibly answer his purpose. Yes, yes; I see plainly by Tim\'s\r\ncountenance, neighbor Derby, that he\'s disposed to oblige you. I would not\r\nhave refused you the mare for the worth of her. If I had, I should have\r\nexpected you to refuse me in turn. None of my neighbors can accuse me of\r\nbeing backward in doing them a kindness whenever it is possible. Come,\r\nTim, what do you say?\r\n\r\n27. Tim. What do I say, father? Why, sir, I say that I am no less ready\r\nthan you are to do a neighborly kindness. But the mare is by no means\r\ncapable of performing the journey. About a hand\'s breadth, did you say?\r\nWhy, sir, the skin is torn from the poor creature\'s back the bigness of\r\nyour broad-brimmed hat! And, besides, I have promised her, so soon as she\r\nis able to travel, to Ned Saunders, to carry a load of apples to market.\r\n\r\n28. S. Do you hear that, neighbor? I am very sorry matters are thus. I\r\nwould not have disobliged you for the price of two such mares. Believe me,\r\nneighbor Derby, I am really sorry, for your sake, that matters turn out\r\nthus.\r\n\r\n29. D. And I as much for yours, neighbor Scrapewell; for to tell you the\r\ntruth I received a letter this morning from Mr. Griffin, who tells me if I\r\nwill be in town to-day he will give me the refusal of all that lot of\r\ntimber, which he is about cutting down, on the side of the hill; and I had\r\nintended you should have shared half of it, which would have been not less\r\nthan fitly dollars in your pocket. But, as your--\r\n\r\n30.  S. Fifty dollars, did you say?\r\n\r\n31. D. Ay, truly, did I; but as your mare is out of order, I\'ll go and see\r\nif I can get old Roan, the blacksmith\'s horse.\r\n\r\n32. S. Old Roan! My mare is at your service, neighbor, Here, Tim, tell Ned\r\nSaunders he can\'t have the mare: neighbor Derby wants her; and I won\'t\r\nrefuse so good a friend anything he asks for.\r\n\r\n33. D. But what are you to do for meal?\r\n\r\n34. S. My wife can do without it for a week if you want the mare so long.\r\n\r\n35. D. But, then, your saddle is all in pieces.\r\n\r\n36. S. I meant the old one. I have bought a new one since, and you shall\r\nhave the first use of it.\r\n\r\n37. D. And shall I call at Thumper\'s and get the mare shod?\r\n\r\n38. S. No, no; I had forgotten to tell you that I let neighbor Dobson shoe\r\nher, last week, by way of trial; and, to do him justice, he shoes\r\nextremely well.\r\n\r\n39. D. But, if the poor creature has lost so much skin from off her back--\r\n\r\n40. S. Poh, poh! That is just one of Tim\'s large stories. I do assure you\r\nit was not, at first, bigger than my thumb nail, and I am certain it has\r\nnot grown any since.\r\n\r\n41. D. At least, however, let her have something she will eat, since she\r\nrefuses hay.\r\n\r\n42. S. She did, indeed, refuse hay this morning; but the only reason was\r\nthat she was crammed full of oats. You have nothing to fear, neighbor; the\r\nmare is in perfect trim; and she will skim you over the ground like a\r\nbird. I wish you a good journey and a profitable job.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--l. Ex-treme\'ly, very much. 6. Whim\'si-cal, full of whims.\r\n20. Cur\'ried, cleaned. Fore\'top, hair on the forepart of the head. 24.\r\nBun\'gler, a clumsy workman. 26.

Crammed, stuffed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIII. THE NOBLEST REVENGE. (94)\r\n\r\n1. "I will have revenge on him, that I will, and make him heartily repent\r\nit," said Philip to himself, with a countenance quite red with anger. His\r\nmind was so engaged that he did not see Stephen, who happened at that\r\ninstant to meet him.\r\n\r\n2. "Who is that," said Stephen, "on whom you intend to be revenged?"\r\nPhilip, as if awakened from a dream, stopped short, and looking at his\r\nfriend, soon resumed a smile that was natural to his countenance. "Ah,"\r\nsaid he, "you remember my bamboo, a very pretty cane which was given me by\r\nmy father, do you not? Look! there it is in pieces. It was farmer\r\nRobinson\'s son who reduced it to this worthless state."\r\n\r\n3. Stephen very coolly asked him what had induced young Robinson to break\r\nit. "I was walking peaceably along," replied he, "and was playing with my\r\ncane by twisting it round my body. By accident, one of the ends slipped\r\nout of my hand, when I was opposite the gate, just by the wooden bridge,\r\nwhere the ill natured fellow had put down a pitcher of water, which he was\r\ntaking home from the well."\r\n\r\n4. "It so happened that my cane, in springing back, upset the pitcher, but\r\ndid not break it. He came up close to me, and began to call me names, when\r\nI assured him that what I had done had happened by accident, and that I\r\nwas sorry for it. Without regarding what I said, he instantly seized my\r\ncane, and twisted it, as you see; but I will make him repent of it."\r\n\r\n5. "To be sure," said Stephen, "he is a very wicked boy, and is already\r\nvery properly punished for being such, since nobody likes him or will have\r\nanything to do with him. He can scarcely find a companion to play with\r\nhim; and is often at a loss for amusement, as he deserves to be. This,\r\nproperly considered, I think will appear sufficient revenge for you."\r\n\r\n6. "All this is true," replied Philip, "but he has broken my cane. It was\r\na present from my father, and a very pretty cane it was. I offered to fill\r\nhis pitcher for him again, as I knocked it down by accident. I will be\r\nrevenged."\r\n\r\n7. "Now, Philip;" said Stephen, "I think you will act better in not\r\nminding him, as your contempt will be the best punishment you can inflict\r\nupon him. Be assured, he will always be able to do more mischief to you\r\nthan you choose to do to him. And, now I think of it, I will tell you what\r\nhappened to him not long since."\r\n\r\n8. "Very unluckily for him, he chanced to see a bee hovering about a\r\nflower which he caught, and was going to pull off its wings out of sport,\r\nwhen the animal stung him, and flew away in safety to the hive. The pain\r\nput him into a furious passion, and, like you, he vowed revenge. He\r\naccordingly procured a stick, and thrust it into the beehive."\r\n\r\n9. "In an instant the whole swarm flew out, and alighting upon him stung\r\nhim in a hundred different places. He uttered the most piercing cries, and\r\nrolled upon the ground in the excess of his agony. His father immediately\r\nran to him, but could not put the bees to flight until they had stung him\r\nso severely that he was confined several days to his bed."\r\n\r\nl0. "Thus, you see, he was not very successful in his pursuit of revenge.\r\nI would advise you, therefore, to pass over his insult. He is a wicked\r\nboy, and much stronger than you; so that your ability to obtain this\r\nrevenge may be doubtful."\r\n\r\n11. "I must own," replied Philip, "that your advice seems very good. So\r\ncome along with me, and I will tell my father the whole matter, and I\r\nthink he will not be angry with me." They went, and Philip told his father\r\nwhat had happened. He thanked Stephen for the good advice he had given his\r\nson, and promised Philip to give him another cane exactly like the first.\r\n\r\n12. A few days afterward, Philip saw this ill-natured boy fall as he was\r\ncarrying home a heavy log of wood, which he could not lift up again.\r\nPhilip ran to him, and helped him to replace it on his shoulder. Young\r\nRobinson was quite ashamed at the thought of this unmerited kindness, and\r\nheartily repented of his behavior. Philip went home quite satisfied.\r\n"This," said he, "is the noblest vengeance I could take, in returning good\r\nfor evil. It is impossible I should repent of it."\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--l. Re-venge\', return for an injury.  Re-pent\', to feel sorry\r\nfor. Coun\'te-nance, the face. 2. Re-sumed\', took again. 3. In-duced\',\r\ncaused. 4. As-sured, declared positively.

How should we treat such persons?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIV. EVENING HYMN. (97)\r\n\r\n1. Come to the sunset tree,\r\n     The day is past and gone;\r\n   The woodman\'s ax lies free,\r\n     And the reaper\'s work is done;\r\n   The twilight star to heaven,\r\n     And the summer dew to flowers,\r\n   And rest to us is given,\r\n     By the soft evening hours.\r\n\r\n2. Sweet is the hour of rest,\r\n     Pleasant the woods\' low sigh,\r\n   And the gleaming of the west,\r\n     And the turf whereon we lie,\r\n   When the burden and the heat\r\n     Of the laborer\'s task is o\'er,\r\n   And kindly voices greet\r\n     The tired one at the door.\r\n\r\n3. Yes, tuneful is the sound\r\n     That dwells in whispering boughs:\r\n   Welcome the freshness round,\r\n     And the gale that fans our brows;\r\n   But rest more sweet and still\r\n     Than ever the nightfall gave,\r\n   Our yearning hearts shall fill,\r\n     In the world beyond the grave.\r\n\r\n4. There, shall no tempests blow,\r\n     Nor scorching noontide heat;\r\n   There, shall be no more snow,\r\n     No weary, wandering feet;\r\n   So we lift our trusting eyes\r\n     From the hills our fathers trod,\r\n   To the quiet of the skies,\r\n     To the Sabbath of our God.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXV. HOW MARGERY WONDERED. (99)\r\nBy Lucy Larcom.\r\n\r\n1. One bright morning late in March, little Margery put on her hood and\r\nher Highland plaid shawl, and went trudging across the beach. It was the\r\nfirst time she had been trusted out alone, for Margery was a little girl;\r\nnothing about her was large, except her round gray eyes, which had yet\r\nscarcely opened upon half a dozen springs and summers.\r\n\r\n2. There was a pale mist on the far-off sea and sky, and up around the sun\r\nwere white clouds edged with the hues of pinks and violets. The sunshine\r\nand the mild air made Margery\'s very heart feel warm, and she let the soft\r\nwind blow aside her Highland shawl, as she looked across the waters at the\r\nsun, and wondered! For, somehow, the sun had never looked before as it did\r\nto-day;--it seemed like a great golden flower bursting out of its\r\npearl-lined calyx,--a flower without a stem. Or was there a strong stem\r\naway behind it in the sky, that reached down below the sea, to a root,\r\nnobody could guess where?\r\n\r\n3. Margery did not stop to puzzle herself about the answer to her\r\nquestion, for now the tide, was coming in, and the waves, little at first,\r\nbut growing larger every moment, were crowding up along the sand and\r\npebbles, laughing, winking, and whispering, as they tumbled over each\r\nother, like thousands of children hurrying home from somewhere, each with\r\nits own precious little secret to tell.\r\n\r\n4. Where did the waves come from? Who was down there under the blue wall\r\nof the horizon, with the hoarse, hollow voice, urging and pushing them\r\nacross the beach at her feet? And what secret was it they were lisping to\r\neach other with their pleasant voices? Oh, what was there beneath the sea,\r\nand beyond the sea, so deep, so broad, and so dim, too, away off where the\r\nwhite ships, that looked smaller than sea birds, were gliding out and in?\r\n\r\n5. But while Margery stood still for a moment on a dry rock, and wondered,\r\nthere came a low, rippling warble to her ear from a cedar tree on the\r\ncliff above her. It had been a long winter, and Margery had forgotten that\r\nthere were birds, and that birds could sing. So she wondered again what\r\nthe music was.\r\n\r\n6. And when she saw the bird perched on a yellow-brown bough, she wondered\r\nyet more. It was only a bluebird, but then it was the first bluebird\r\nMargery had ever seen. He fluttered among the prickly twigs, and looked as\r\nif he had grown out of them, as the cedar berries had, which were dusty\r\nblue, the color of his coat. But how did the music get in his throat? And\r\nafter it was in his throat, how could it untangle itself, and wind itself\r\noff so evenly? And where had the bluebird flown from, across the snow\r\nbanks down to the shore of the blue sea?\r\n\r\n7. The waves sang a welcome to him, and he sang a welcome to the waves;\r\nthey seemed to know each other well; and the ripple and the warble sounded\r\nso much alike, the bird and the wave must have both learned their music of\r\nthe same teacher. And Margery kept on wondering as she stepped between the\r\nsong of the bluebird and the echo of the sea, and climbed a sloping bank,\r\njust turning faintly green in the spring sunshine.\r\n\r\n8. The grass was surely beginning to grow! There were fresh, juicy shoots\r\nrunning up among the withered blades of last year, as if in hopes of\r\nbringing them back to life; and closer down she saw the sharp points of\r\nnew spears peeping from their sheaths. And scattered here and there were\r\nsmall, dark green leaves folded around buds shut up so tightly that only\r\nthose who had watched them many seasons could tell what flowers were to be\r\nlet out of their safe prisons by and by. So no one could blame Margery for\r\nnot knowing that they were only common things, nor for stooping over the\r\ntiny buds, and wondering.\r\n\r\n9. What made the grass come up so green out of the black earth? And how\r\ndid the buds know when it was time to take off their little green hoods,\r\nand see what there was in the world around them? And how came they to be\r\nbuds at all? Did they bloom in another world before they sprung up\r\nhere?--and did they know, themselves, what kind of flowers they should\r\nblossom into? Had flowers souls, like little girls, that would live in\r\nanother world when their forms had faded away in this?\r\n\r\n10. Margery thought she would like to sit down on the bank, and wait\r\nbeside the buds until they opened; perhaps they would tell her their\r\nsecret if the very first thing they saw was her eyes watching them. One\r\nbud was beginning to unfold; it was streaked with yellow in little stripes\r\nthat she could imagine became wider every minute. But she would not touch\r\nit, for it seemed almost as much alive as herself. She only wondered, and\r\nwondered!\r\n\r\n11. Margery heard her mother calling her, and she trudged home across the\r\nshells and pebbles with a pleasant smile dimpling her cheeks; for she felt\r\nvery much at home in this large, wonderful world, and was happy to be\r\nalive, although she neither could have told, nor cared to know, the reason\r\nwhy. But when her mother unpinned the little girl\'s Highland shawl, and\r\ntook off her hood, she said, "O mother, do let me live on the doorstep! I\r\ndon\'t like houses to stay in. What makes everything so pretty and so glad?\r\nDon\'t you like to wonder?"\r\n\r\n12. Margery\'s mother was a good woman. But then there was all the\r\nhousework to do, and, if she had thoughts, she did not often let them\r\nwander outside of the kitchen door. And just now she was baking some\r\ngingerbread, which was in danger of getting burned in the oven. So she\r\npinned the shawl around the child\'s neck again, and left her on the\r\ndoorstep, saying to herself, as she returned to her work, "Queer child! I\r\nwonder what kind of a woman she will be!"\r\n\r\n13. But Margery sat on the doorstep, and wondered, as the sea sounded\r\nlouder, and the sunshine grew warmer around her. It was all so strange,\r\nand grand, and beautiful! Her heart danced with joy to the music that went\r\nechoing through the wide world from the roots of the sprouting grass to\r\nthe great golden blossom of the sun.\r\n\r\n14. And when the round, gray eyes closed that night, at the first peep of\r\nthe stars, the angels looked down and wondered over Margery. For the\r\nwisdom of the wisest being God has made, ends in wonder; and there is\r\nnothing on earth so wonderful as the budding soul of a little child.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.-l. Trudg\'ing, walking sturdily. 2. Hues, colors. Ca\'lyx, the\r\nouter covering of a flower. 4. Ho-ri\'zon, the line where the sky and earth\r\nseem to meet. 5. War\'ble, a trill of the voice. Spears, shoots of grass.\r\nSheaths, coverings.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISES.--Name the things about which Margery\r\nwondered. What did she wonder about each? What is still\r\nmore wonderful than all that at which Margery wondered?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVI. THE CHILD\'S WORLD. (103)\r\n\r\n1. "Great, wide, beautiful, wonderful world,\r\n   With the wonderful water round you curled,\r\n   And the wonderful grass upon your breast,--\r\n   World, you are beautifully drest."\r\n\r\n2. "The wonderful air is over me,\r\n   And the wonderful wind is shaking the tree;\r\n   It walks on the water, and whirls the mills,\r\n   And talks to itself on the tops of the hills."\r\n\r\n3. "You friendly Earth! how far do you go\r\n   With the wheat fields that nod, and the rivers that flow;\r\n   With cities and gardens, and cliffs and isles,\r\n   And people upon you for thousands of miles?"\r\n\r\n4. "Ah, you are so great, and I am so small,\r\n   I tremble to think of you, World, at all:\r\n   And yet, when I said my prayers, to-day,\r\n   A whisper inside me seemed to say,\r\n   You are more than the Earth, though you are such a dot:\r\n   You can love and think, and the Earth can not!\'"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVII. SUSIE\'S COMPOSITION. (104)\r\n\r\n1. Susie Smith came home from school one day, and had no sooner entered\r\nthe sitting room than she burst into tears. "What is the matter, my dear\r\nchild?" said her mother, drawing her daughter to her side and smiling.\r\n\r\n2. "O mother, matter enough," sobbed Susie. "All our class must bring in\r\ncompositions to-morrow morning, and I never, never can write one. We must\r\nwrite twelve lines at least, and I have written only a few words after\r\ntrying nearly all the afternoon. See what work I have made of it!"\r\n\r\n3. Mrs. Smith took the rumpled, tear-stained paper which Susie held in her\r\nhand, and glanced at what she had written. In a careful hand she had tried\r\nto write upon three themes: "Time," "Temperance," and "Industry."\r\n\r\n4. "Time is short. We should all improve our time." "Temperance is a very\r\nuseful thing." "We should all be industrious if we wish to do anything in\r\nthe world." These sentences were all she had written.\r\n\r\n5. "Now," said Susie, "I can\'t think of another word to say upon any of\r\nthese subjects, and I know I shall have to go to school without a\r\ncomposition, for I won\'t be so mean as to copy one from a book, or to ask\r\nyou or papa to write one for me."\r\n\r\n6. "That is right, my dear," said her mother. "You will be far happier\r\nwith a poor composition, if it is all your own, than with a fine one\r\nwritten by somebody else. But cheer up. You have not begun right--you have\r\nbeen trying to write upon subjects that you know nothing about. Run into\r\nthe garden and play. I will call you in half an hour."\r\n\r\n7. "But my composition," began Susie. "Don\'t think about your composition\r\nwhile you are gone," said Mrs. Smith, "but have as pleasant a time as you\r\ncan."\r\n\r\n8. It seemed but a few minutes to Susie before she heard her mother\'s\r\nvoice calling her. She went into the house at once--her hands full of\r\nsweet flowers, and her cheeks rosy with exercise.\r\n\r\n9. "Now, Susie," said her mother, "I want you to sit by the window with\r\nthis nice sheet of paper and a pencil, and write something about what you\r\ncan see." "But my composition, mother," said Susie; "when shall I begin\r\nthat?" "Never mind your composition, my dear; do this to please me, and we\r\nwill talk about that by and by."\r\n\r\n10. Susie thought her mother\'s request was a strange one; but she knew\r\nthat she always had a good reason for everything she did: so she took the\r\npaper and pencil, and sat by the window.\r\n\r\n11. "Do not talk to me at all," said her mother. "Look out of the window,\r\nand then write down your thoughts about everything you see."\r\n\r\n12. Susie could not help laughing, it seemed such a funny thing to be\r\ndoing. As she looked out, she first saw the western sky and some bright,\r\nsunset clouds. "O mother!" she exclaimed, "what a splendid sunset!" "Don\'t\r\ntalk," said her mother, "but write."\r\n\r\n13. "I\'ll write about the sunset, then," said she, and the pencil began to\r\nmove rapidly across the paper. In a few moments she said, "Mother, shall I\r\nread you what I have written?" "No, not now," answered her mother; "I am\r\ngoing into the dining room. You may sit and write until I return."\r\n\r\n14. As Susie went on writing, she became very much interested in her\r\noccupation, and for a time forgot all about the dreaded composition. She\r\nwrote about the sunset clouds, the appearance of the distant hills, the\r\ntrees, the river, the garden with its gay flowers, and the birds flying\r\npast the window.\r\n\r\n15. Just as she had reached the bottom of the page, her mother came in.\r\n"Well, Susie," said she, with a smile, "how does that composition come\r\non?" "Composition!" exclaimed Susie; "you told me not to think about my\r\ncomposition, and I have not thought of it once; I have had such a nice\r\ntime writing about what I could see from the window."\r\n\r\n16. Mrs. Smith took the paper and read aloud what Susie had written: "I am\r\nsitting on a low seat at the bay window, one half of which is open, so\r\nthat I can smell the sweet flowers in the garden. The sky is all bright\r\nwith sunset; I can see purple, and pink, and golden. I do not believe that\r\nanyone on earth has a paint box with such lovely colors in it."\r\n\r\n17. "I can see one cloud, far above the rest, that looks like a ship\r\nsailing in the blue sea. I should like to sail on a cloud, if it would not\r\nmake me dizzy. Now, while I have been writing, the clouds have changed in\r\ncolor and form, but they are just as beautiful as they were before."\r\n\r\n18. "The green hills are tipped with light, and look as if they were\r\nwearing golden crowns. I can see a river a great way off, and it looks\r\nquite still, although I know it is running as fast as it can to get to the\r\nocean."\r\n\r\n19. "The birds are flying past the window to go home and take care of\r\ntheir little ones. I am glad the birds are not afraid to live in our\r\ngarden, and to build nests in our trees."\r\n\r\n20. "Our garden is full of flowers--pinks, lilies, and roses. Mother calls\r\nthis the month of roses. My birthday will come in a week, and we can have\r\nall the flowers we wish for wreaths and bouquets."\r\n\r\n21. "There, Susie," said Mrs. Smith, "that is a very nice composition,\r\nindeed." "A composition!" exclaimed Susie, "is that a composition?" "Yes,\r\nmy dear, and a very good one, too," replied her mother. "When it hasn\'t\r\neven a subject?"\r\n\r\n22. "We can find one for it, and I do not doubt it will please your\r\nteacher, as it does me. You see, my dear," continued her mother, "that it\r\nis easy enough to write if you have anything interesting to write about."\r\n\r\n23. The next morning Susie copied her composition very neatly, and started\r\nto school with a happy heart, saying, as she gave her mother a kiss, "Just\r\nthink how funny it is, dear mother, that I should have written so long a\r\ncomposition without knowing it."\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--Com-po-si\'tion, that which is thought out and arranged, a\r\nwritten or literary work. 3. Rum\'pled, wrinkled, creased. Themes, subjects\r\nor topics on which a person writes. 10. Re-quest\', that which is asked.\r\n14. Oc-cu-pa\'tion, that which employs the time. 20. Bou-quets\' (pro.\r\nboo-kas\'), bunches of flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISES.--What is a composition? Why was Susie so troubled? Why could\r\nshe not write about "Time," "Temperance," or "Industry"? What did her\r\nmother have her do? What did Susie write? Was it a composition? Did she\r\nknow, at the time, that it was? What fault did she find with it? Can you\r\ngive her composition a proper subject?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXVIII. THE SUMMER SHOWER. (109)\r\n\r\nThe author, Thomas Buchanan Read, was born in Chester Co., Pa., March 12,\r\n1822. His life was devoted to the fine arts, and he attained a high\r\nreputation both as artist and poet. He died in New York, May 11, 1872.\r\n\r\n1. Before the stout harvesters falleth the grain,\r\n   As when the strong stormwind is reaping the plain,\r\n   And loiters the boy in the briery lane;\r\n   But yonder aslant comes the silvery rain,\r\nLike a long line of spears brightly burnished and tall.\r\n\r\n2. Adown the white highway like cavalry fleet,\r\n   It dashes the dust with its numberless feet.\r\n   Like a murmurless school, in their leafy retreat,\r\n   The wild birds sit listening the drops round them beat;\r\nAnd the boy crouches close to the blackberry wall.\r\n\r\n3. The swallows alone take the storm on the wing,\r\n   And, taunting the tree-sheltered laborers, sing.\r\n   Like pebbles the rain breaks the face of the spring,\r\n   While a bubble darts up from each widening ring;\r\nAnd the boy in dismay hears the loud shower fall.\r\n\r\n4. But soon are the harvesters tossing their sheaves;\r\n   The robin darts out from his bower of leaves;\r\n   The wren peereth forth from the moss-covered eaves;\r\n   And the rain-spattered urchin now gladly perceives\r\nThat the beautiful bow bendeth over them all.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--l. A-slant\', toward one side. 2. High\'way, a public road.\r\nRe-treat\', a place of refuge or safety, Crouch\'es, stoops low. 3.\r\nTaunt\'ing, deriding, mocking. 4. Ur\'chin, a child.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXXXIX. CONSEQUENCES OF IDLENESS. (110)\r\n\r\n1. Many young persons seem to think it of not much consequence if they do\r\nnot improve their time well in youth, vainly expecting that they can make\r\nit up by diligence when they are older. They also think it is disgraceful\r\nfor men and women to be idle, but that there can be no harm for persons\r\nwho are young to spend their time in any manner they please.\r\n\r\n2. George Jones thought so. When he was twelve years old, he went to an\r\nacademy to prepare to enter college. His father was at great expense in\r\nobtaining books for him, clothing him, and paying his tuition. But George\r\nwas idle. The preceptor of the academy would often tell him that if he did\r\nnot study diligently when young he would never succeed well.\r\n\r\n3. But George thought of nothing but present pleasure. He would often go\r\nto school without having made any preparation for his morning lesson; and,\r\nwhen called to recite with his class, he would stammer and make such\r\nblunders that the rest of the class could not help laughing at him. He was\r\none of the poorest scholars in the school, because he was one of the most\r\nidle.\r\n\r\n4. When recess came, and all the boys ran out of the academy upon the\r\nplayground, idle George would come moping along. Instead of studying\r\ndiligently while in school, he was indolent and half asleep. When the\r\nproper time for play came, he had no relish for it. I recollect very well,\r\nthat, when "tossing up" for a game of ball, we used to choose everybody on\r\nthe playground before we chose George; and if there were enough without\r\nhim we used to leave him out. Thus he was unhappy in school and out of\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n5. There is nothing which makes a person enjoy play so well as to study\r\nhard. When recess was over, and the rest of the boys returned, fresh and\r\nvigorous, to their studies, George might be seen lagging and moping along\r\nto his seat. Sometimes he would be asleep in school; sometimes he would\r\npass his time in catching flies, and penning them up in little holes,\r\nwhich he cut in his seat; and sometimes, when the preceptor\'s back was\r\nturned, he would throw a paper ball across the room.\r\n\r\n6. When the class was called up to recite, George would come drowsily\r\nalong, looking as mean and ashamed as though he were going to be whipped.\r\nThe rest of the class stepped up to the recitation with alacrity, and\r\nappeared happy and contented. When it came George\'s turn to recite, he\r\nwould be so long in doing it, and make such blunders, that all most\r\nheartily wished him out of the class.\r\n\r\n7. At last, George went with his class to enter college. Though he passed\r\na very poor examination, he was admitted with the rest; for those who\r\nexamined him thought it was possible that the reason why he did not answer\r\nquestions better was because he was frightened. Now came hard times for\r\npoor George. In college there is not much mercy shown to bad scholars; and\r\nGeorge had neglected his studies so long that he could not now keep up\r\nwith his class, let him try ever so hard.\r\n\r\n8. He could, without much difficulty, get along in the academy, where\r\nthere were only two or three boys of his own class to laugh at him. But\r\nnow he had to go into a large recitation room, filled with students from\r\nall parts of the country. In the presence of all these, he must rise and\r\nrecite to a professor. Poor fellow! He paid dearly for his idleness.\r\n\r\n9. You would have pitied him if you could have seen him trembling in his\r\nscat, every moment expecting to be called upon to recite. And when he was\r\ncalled upon, he would stand up and take what the class called a "dead\r\nset;" that is, he could not recite at all. Sometimes he would make such\r\nludicrous blunders that the whole class would burst into a laugh. Such are\r\nthe applauses an idler gets. He was wretched, of course. He had been idle\r\nso long that he hardly knew how to apply his mind to study. All the good\r\nscholars avoided him; they were ashamed to be seen in his company. He\r\nbecame discouraged, and gradually grew dissipated.\r\n\r\n10. The officers of the college were soon compelled to suspend him. He\r\nreturned in a few months, but did no better; and his father was then\r\nadvised to take him from college. He left college, despised by everyone. A\r\nfew months ago, I met him, a poor wanderer, without money and without\r\nfriends. Such are the wages of idleness. I hope every reader will, from\r\nthis history, take warning, and "stamp improvement on the wings of time."\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Con\'se-quence, importance, influence. 2. A-cad\'e-my, a\r\nschool of high order. Col\'lege, a seminary of learning of the highest\r\norder. Pre-cep\'tor, a teacher. 3. Prep-a-ra\'-tion, a making ready. 5.\r\nVig\'or-ous, full of activity and strength. 6. A-lac\'ri-ty, cheerfulness,\r\nsprightliness. 8. Pro-fess\'or, a teacher in a college. 9. Lu\'di-crous,\r\nadapted to raise laughter. Ap--plaus\'es, praises. Dis\'-si-pa-ted, given up\r\nto bad habits. 10. Im-prove\'ment, increase of knowledge.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXL. ADVANTAGES OF INDUSTRY. (113)\r\n\r\n1. I gave you, in the last lesson, the history of George Jones, an idle\r\nboy, and showed you the consequences of his idleness. I shall now give you\r\nthe history of Charles Bullard, a classmate of George. Charles was about\r\nthe same age as George, and did not possess superior talents. Indeed, I\r\ndoubt whether he was equal to him in natural powers of mind.\r\n\r\n2. But Charles was a hard student. When quite young, he was always careful\r\nand diligent in school. Sometimes, when there was a very hard lesson,\r\ninstead of going out to play during recess, he would stay in to study. He\r\nhad resolved that his first object should be to get his lessons well, and\r\nthen he could play with a good conscience. He loved play as well as\r\nanybody, and was one of the best players on the ground. I hardly ever saw\r\nany boy catch a ball better than he could. When playing any game, everyone\r\nwas glad to get Charles on his side.\r\n\r\n3. I have said that Charles would sometimes stay in at recess. This,\r\nhowever, was very seldom; it was only when the lessons were very hard\r\nindeed. Generally, he was among the first on the playground, and he was\r\nalso among the first to go into school when called. Hard study gave him a\r\nrelish for play, and play again gave him a relish for hard study; so he\r\nwas happy both in school and out. The preceptor could not help liking him,\r\nfor he always had his lessons well committed, and never gave him any\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\n4. When he went to enter college, the preceptor gave him a good\r\nrecommendation. He was able to answer all the questions which were put to\r\nhim when he was examined. He had studied so well when he was in the\r\nacademy, and was so thoroughly prepared for college, that he found it very\r\neasy to keep up with his class, and had much time for reading interesting\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\n5. But he would always get his lesson well before he did anything else,\r\nand would review it just before recitation. When called upon to recite, he\r\nrose tranquil and happy, and very seldom made mistakes. The officers of\r\nthe college had a high opinion of him, and he was respected by all the\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\n6. There was, in the college, a society made up of all the best scholars.\r\nCharles was chosen a member of that society. It was the custom to choose\r\nsome one of the society to deliver a public address every year. This honor\r\nwas conferred on Charles; and he had studied so diligently, and read so\r\nmuch, that he delivered an address which was very interesting to all who\r\nheard it.\r\n\r\n7. At last he graduated, as it is called; that is, he finished his\r\ncollegiate course, and received his degree. It was known by all that he\r\nwas a good scholar, and by all that he was respected. His father and\r\nmother, brothers and sisters, came on the commencement day to hear him\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n8. They all felt gratified, and loved Charles more than ever. Many\r\nsituations of usefulness and profit were opened to him; for Charles was\r\nnow an intelligent man, and universally respected. He is still a useful\r\nand a happy man. He has a cheerful home, and is esteemed by all who know\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n9. Such are the rewards of industry. How strange it is that any person\r\nshould be willing to live in idleness when it will certainly make him\r\nunhappy! The idle boy is almost invariably poor and miserable; the\r\nindustrious boy is happy and prosperous.\r\n\r\n10. But perhaps some child who reads this, asks, "Does God notice little\r\nchildren in school?" He certainly does. And if you are not diligent in the\r\nimprovement of your time, it is one of the surest evidences that your\r\nheart is not right with God. You are placed in this world to improve your\r\ntime. In youth you must be preparing for future usefulness. And if you do\r\nnot improve the advantages you enjoy, you sin against your Maker.\r\n\r\n  With books, or work, or healthful play,\r\n  Let your first years be passed;\r\n  That you may give, for every day,\r\n  Some good account, at last.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--l. His\'to-ry, a description or a narration of events. 2.\r\nCon\'science, our own knowledge of right and wrong. Game, play, sport. 3.\r\nCom-mit\'ted, fixed in mind. 4. Rec-om-men-da\'tion, what is said in praise\r\nof anyone. 5. Re view\', to examine again. Tran\'quil, quiet, calm. 6.\r\nCon-ferred\', given to or bestowed upon anyone. 7. Grad\'u-a-ted, received a\r\ndegree from a college. Com-mence\'ment, the day when students receive their\r\ndegree. 8. U-ni-ver\'sal-ly, by all, without exception. 9. In-va\'ri-a-bly,\r\nalways, uniformly. 10. Ev\'i-den-ces, proofs. Ad-van\'ta-ges, opportunities\r\nfor improvement.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISES.--What was the character of George Jones? Of Charles Bullard?\r\nHow did George appear in the class at school? How did he behave at recess?\r\nHow did Charles differ from him in these respects? Relate what happened\r\nwhen George went to college. What became of him? Did Charles succeed at\r\ncollege? Which of them do you think more worthy of imitation? What is said\r\nof the idle? What is said of the industrious? Who watches all our actions\r\nwherever we may be? For what are we placed in this world? Should you not\r\nthen be diligent in your studies?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLI. THE FOUNTAIN. (116)\r\n\r\nBy James Russell Lowell, one of the most noted of American poets; also\r\nwell known as an essayist and lecturer.

The coffee tree is a native of eastern Africa, but it was in Arabia\r\nthat it first became known to the people of Europe, and until about the\r\nyear 1700 A. D. that country afforded the entire supply.\r\n\r\n2. Then the coffee seeds found their way to Java, by means of some\r\ntraders, and one of the first plants grown on that island was sent as a\r\npresent to the governor of the Dutch East India Company, who lived in\r\nHolland.\r\n\r\n3. It was planted in the Botanical Gardens at Amsterdam, and in a few\r\nyears seeds taken from it were sent to South America, where the\r\ncultivation of coffee has steadily increased, extending to the West\r\nIndies, until now the offspring of this one plant produce more coffee than\r\nis obtained from all the other plants in the world.\r\n\r\n4. The plant is an evergreen, and is from six to twelve feet high, the\r\nstem being from ten to fifteen inches in diameter. The lower branches bend\r\ndown when the tree begins to grow old, and extend themselves into a round\r\nform somewhat like an umbrella; and the wood is so pliable that the ends\r\nof the largest branches may be bent down to within two or three feet of\r\nthe earth.\r\n\r\n5. The bark is whitish and somewhat rough. A tree is never without leaves,\r\nwhich are at small distances from one another, and on almost opposite\r\nsides of a bough. Blossoms and green and ripe fruit may be seen on the\r\nsame tree at the same time. When the blossom falls off, there grows in its\r\nplace a small green fruit, which becomes dark red as it ripens.\r\n\r\n6. This fruit is not unlike a cherry, and is very good to eat. Under the\r\npulp of this cherry is found the bean or berry we call coffee, wrapped in\r\na fine, thin skin. The berry is at first very soft, and has a bad taste;\r\nbut as the cherry ripens the berry grows harder, and the dried-up fruit\r\nbecomes a shell or pod of a deep brown color.\r\n\r\n7. The berry is now solid, and its color is a translucent green. Each\r\nshell contains two seeds, rounded on one side and flat on the other. The\r\nseeds lie with the flat sides together, and, in one highly prized variety,\r\nthe two seeds grow together, forming one: this is known as the pea berry.\r\nWhen the fruit is so ripe that it can be shaken from the tree, the husks\r\nare separated from the berries, and are used, in Arabia, by the natives,\r\nwhile the berries are sold.\r\n\r\n8. The young plants are inserted in holes from twelve to eighteen inches\r\ndeep, and six or eight feet apart. If left to themselves, they would grow\r\nto the height of eighteen or twenty feet; but they are usually dwarfed by\r\npruning, so that the fruit may be easily got at by the gatherer.\r\n\r\n9. Thus dwarfed, they extend their branches until they cover the whole\r\nspace about them. They begin to yield fruit the third year. By the sixth\r\nor seventh year they are at full bearing, and continue to bear for twenty\r\nyears or more.\r\n\r\nl0. Before the berry can be used, it undergoes a process of roasting. The\r\namount of aromatic oil brought out in roasting has much to do with the\r\nmarket value of coffee, and it has been found that the longer the raw\r\ncoffee is kept, the richer it becomes in this peculiar oil, and so the\r\nmore valuable. But after the coffee is roasted, and especially after it is\r\nground, it loses its aroma rapidly.\r\n\r\n11. Arabia produces the celebrated Mocha, or "Mokha," coffee, which is the\r\nfinest in the world; but little or none of the best product is ever taken\r\nout of that country. The Java coffee from the East Indies is next prized,\r\nbut the best quality of this kind is also quite difficult to obtain, and\r\nmany, therefore, prefer the finest grades of Rio coffee from South America\r\nto such Mocha and Java as can be had in our country.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--l. Af-ford\'ed, yielded, produced. 3. Off\'spring,\r\ndescendants, however remote, from, the stock. 4. Pli\'a-ble, easily bent.\r\n7. Trans-lu\'cent, permitting the passage of light. 8. Prun\'-ing, trimming.\r\n10. Ar-o-mat\'ic, containing aroma, fragrant.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISES.--What country first supplied coffee? How did the plant come to\r\nbe grown in other countries? Describe the plant. What is said of the\r\nfruit? How are the plants cultivated? What is said about the roasting of\r\ncoffee? What are the three principal kinds of coffee used, and how are\r\nthey valued?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIII. THE WINTER KING. (120)\r\n\r\n1. Oh! what will become of thee, poor little bird?\r\n   The muttering storm in the distance is heard;\r\n   The rough winds are waking, the clouds growing black,\r\n   They\'ll soon scatter snowflakes all over thy back!\r\n   From what sunny clime hast thou wandered away?\r\n   And what art thou doing this cold winter day?\r\n\r\n2. "I\'m picking the gum from the old peach tree;\r\n   The storm doesn\'t trouble me. Pee, dee, dee!"\r\n\r\n3. But what makes thee seem so unconscious of care?\r\n   The brown earth is frozen, the branches are bare:\r\n   And how canst thou be so light-hearted and free,\r\n   As if danger and suffering thou never should\'st see,\r\n   When no place is near for thy evening nest,\r\n   No leaf for thy screen, for thy bosom no rest?\r\n\r\n4. "Because the same Hand is a shelter for me,\r\n   That took off the summer leaves. Pee, dee, dee!"\r\n\r\n5. But man feels a burden of care and of grief,\r\n   While plucking the cluster and binding the sheaf:\r\n   In the summer we faint, in the winter we\'re chilled,\r\n   With ever a void that is yet to be filled.\r\n   We take from the ocean, the earth, and the air,\r\n   Yet all their rich gifts do not silence our care.\r\n\r\n6. "A very small portion sufficient will be,\r\n   If sweetened with gratitude. Pee, dee, dee!"\r\n\r\n7. But soon there\'ll be ice weighing down the light bough,\r\n   On which thou art flitting so playfully now;\r\n   And though there\'s a vesture well fitted and warm,\r\n   Protecting the rest of thy delicate form,\r\n   What, then, wilt thou do with thy little bare feet,\r\n   To save them from pain, mid the frost and the sleet?\r\n\r\n8. "I can draw them right up in my feathers, you see,\r\n   To warm them, and fly away. Pee, dee, dee!"\r\n\r\n9. I thank thee, bright monitor; what thou hast taught\r\n   Will oft be the theme of the happiest thought;\r\n   We look at the clouds; while the birds have an eye\r\n   To Him who reigns over them, changeless and high.\r\n   And now little hero, just tell me thy name,\r\n   That I may be sure whence my oracle came.\r\n\r\n10. "Because, in all weather, I\'m merry and free,\r\n    They call me the Winter King. Pee, dee, dee!"\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--l. Mut\'ter-ing, murmuring, rumbling. 3. Un-con\'scious, not\r\nknowing, not perceiving. 5. Clus\'ter, a bunch. 7. Flit\'ing, moving about\r\nin a lively manner. Ves\'ture, clothing, covering. 9. Mon\'i-tor, one who\r\nwarns of faults. Or\'a-cle, a wise sentence or decision.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIV. THE NETTLE. (121)\r\n\r\n1. Anna. O papa! I have stung my hand with that nettle.\r\n\r\n2. Father. Well, my dear, I am sorry for it; but pull up that large dock\r\nleaf you see near it; now bruise the juice out of it on the part which is\r\nstung. Well, is the pain lessened?\r\n\r\n3. A. Oh, very much indeed, I hardly feel it now. But I wish there was not\r\na nettle in the world. I am sure I do not know what use there can be in\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n4. F. If you knew anything of botany, Nanny, you would not say so.\r\n\r\n5.  A. What is botany, papa?\r\n\r\n6.  F. Botany, my dear, is the knowledge of plants.\r\n\r\n7.  A. Some plants are very beautiful. If the lily were growing in our\r\nfields, I should not complain. But this ugly nettle! I do not know what\r\nbeauty or use there can be in that.\r\n\r\n8. F. And yet, Nanny, there is more beauty, use, and instruction in a\r\nnettle, than even in a lily.\r\n\r\n9. A. O papa, how can you make that out?\r\n\r\n10. F. Put on your gloves, pluck up that nettle, and let us examine it.\r\nFirst, look at the flower.\r\n\r\n11. A. The flower, papa? I see no flower, unless those little ragged knobs\r\nare flowers, which have neither color nor smell, and are not much larger\r\nthan the heads of pins.\r\n\r\n12. F. Here, take this magnifying glass and examine them.\r\n\r\n13. A. Oh, I see now; every little knob is folded up in leaves, like a\r\nrosebud. Perhaps there is a flower inside.\r\n\r\n14. F. Try; take this pin and touch the knob. Well, what do you see?\r\n\r\n15.  A. Oh, how curious!\r\n\r\n16.  F. What is curious?\r\n\r\n17. A. The moment I touched it, it flew open. A little cloud rose out like\r\nenchantment, and four beautiful little stems sprung up as if they were\r\nalive; and, now that I look again with the glass, I see an elegant little\r\nflower as nice and perfect as a lily itself.\r\n\r\n18. F. Well, now examine the leaves.\r\n\r\n19. A. Oh, I see they are all covered over with little bristles; and when\r\nI examine them with the glass, I see a little bag, filled with a juice\r\nlike water, at the bottom of each. Ha! these are the things which stung\r\nme.\r\n\r\n20. F. Now touch the little bag with the point of the pin.\r\n\r\n21. A. When I press the bag, the juice runs up and comes out at the small\r\npoint at the top; so I suppose the little thorn must be hollow inside,\r\nthough it is finer than the point of my cambric needle.\r\n\r\n22.  F. Have all the leaves those stings?\r\n\r\n23. A. No, papa; some of the young ones are quite green and soft, like\r\nvelvet, and I may handle them without any danger.\r\n\r\n24.  F. Now look at the stem, and break it.\r\n\r\n25. A. I can easily crack it, but I can not break it asunder, for the bark\r\nis so strong that it holds it together.\r\n\r\n26. F. Well, now you see there are more curious things in\r\nthe nettle than you expected.\r\n\r\n27. A. Yes, indeed, I see that. But you have often told me that God makes\r\nnothing without its use; and I am sure I can not see any use in all these\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n28. F. That we will now consider. You saw the little flower burst open,\r\nand a cloud rose, you say, like enchantment. Now all this is necessary for\r\nthe nature of the plant. There are many thousand plants in the world, and\r\nit has pleased God, in his wisdom, to make them all different. Now look at\r\nthis other nettle, which grew on the opposite side of the road; you see\r\nthat it is not exactly like the one you have just examined.\r\n\r\n29. A. No, papa; this has little flat seeds instead of flowers.\r\n\r\n30. F. Very right, my dear. Now, in order to make those seeds grow, it is\r\nnecessary that the little flower of this plant and the seed of that should\r\nbe together, as they are in most others. But plants can not walk, like\r\nanimals. The wisdom of God, therefore, has provided a remedy for this.\r\nWhen the little flower bursts open it throws out a fine powder, which you\r\nsaw rise like a cloud; this is conveyed by the air to the other plant, and\r\nwhen it falls upon the seed of that plant it gives it power to grow, and\r\nmakes it a perfect seed, which, in its turn, when it falls to the ground,\r\nwill produce a new plant. Were it not for this fine powder, that seed\r\nwould never be perfect or complete.\r\n\r\n31. A. That is very curious, indeed; and I see the use of the little cloud\r\nand the flower; but the leaf that stung me, of what use can that be?\r\nThere, dear papa, I am afraid I puzzle you to tell me that.\r\n\r\n32. P. Even these stings are made useful to man. The poor people in some\r\ncountries use them instead of blisters, when they are sick. Those leaves\r\nwhich do not sting are used by some for food, and from the stalk others\r\nget a stringy bark, which answers the purpose of flax. Thus you see that\r\neven the despised nettle is not made in vain; and this lesson may serve to\r\nteach you that we only need to understand the works of God to see that "in\r\ngoodness and wisdom he has made them all."\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--12. Mag\'ni-fy-ing glass, an instrument used to make objects\r\nappear larger. 17. En-chant\'ment, magic art, witch-craft. 5. A-sun\'der,\r\napart, into parts. 30. Rem\'e-dy, that which removes an evil. Con-veyed\',\r\ncarried. 32. String\'y,  full of strings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLV. THE TEMPEST. (125)\r\n\r\nBy James T. Fields (born 1817, died 1881), who was born at Portsmouth, N.\r\nH. He was a poet, and the author, also, of some well known prose works. Of\r\nthese, his "Yesterdays with Authors" is the most noted.\r\n\r\n1. We were crowded in the cabin;\r\n     Not a soul would dare to sleep:\r\n   It was midnight on the waters,\r\n     And a storm was on the deep.\r\n\r\n2. \'T is a fearful thing in winter\r\n     To be shattered by the blast,\r\n   And to hear the rattling trumpet\r\n     Thunder, "Cut away the mast!"\r\n\r\n3. So we shuddered there in silence,\r\n     For the stoutest held his breath,\r\n   While the hungry sea was roaring,\r\n     And the breakers threatened death.\r\n\r\n4. And as thus we sat in darkness,\r\n     Each one busy in his prayers,\r\n   "We are lost!" the captain shouted,\r\n     As he staggered down the stairs.\r\n\r\n5. But his little daughter whispered,\r\n     As she took his icy hand,\r\n   "Is n\'t God upon the ocean,\r\n     Just the same as on the land?"\r\n\r\n6. Then we kissed the little maiden,\r\n     And we spoke in better cheer;\r\n   And we anchored safe in harbor\r\n     When the morn was shining clear.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--l. Deep, the ocean. 2. Blast, tempest. 3. Break\'ers, waves\r\nof the sea broken by rocks. 6. Cheer, state of mind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVI. THE CREATOR. (126)\r\n\r\nThe poetry at the close of this selection is by John Keble, a celebrated\r\nEnglish clergyman, born in 1792. He held for some years the professorship\r\nof Poetry at Oxford University. He died in 1866.\r\n\r\n1. Come, and I will show you what is beautiful. It is a rose fully blown.\r\nSee how she sits upon her mossy stem, the queen of flowers. Her leaves\r\nglow like fire. The air is filled with her sweet odor. She is the delight\r\nof every eye.\r\n\r\n2. But there is one fairer than the rose. He that made the rose is more\r\nbeautiful than the rose. He is altogether lovely. He is the delight of\r\nevery heart.\r\n\r\n3. I will show you what is strong. The lion is strong. When he raiseth\r\nhimself up from his lair, when he shaketh his mane, when the voice of his\r\nroaring is heard, the cattle of the field fly, and the wild beasts of the\r\ndesert hide themselves; for he is terrible.\r\n\r\n4. But He who made the lion is stronger than the lion. He can do all\r\nthings. He gave us life, and in a moment can take it away, and no one can\r\nsave us from his hand.\r\n\r\n5. I will show you what is glorious. The sun is glorious. When he shineth\r\nin the clear sky, when he sitteth on his throne in the heavens, and\r\nlooketh abroad over the earth, he is the most glorious and excellent\r\nobject the eye can behold.\r\n\r\n6. But He who made the sun is more glorious than the sun. The eye cannot\r\nlook on his dazzling brightness. He seeth all dark places, by night as\r\nwell as by day. The light of his countenance is over all the world.\r\n\r\n7. This great Being is God. He made all things, but He is more excellent\r\nthan all that He has made. He is the Creator, they are the creatures. They\r\nmay be beautiful, but He is Beauty. They may be strong, but He is\r\nStrength. They may be perfect, but He is Perfection.\r\n\r\n8. There is a book, who runs may read,\r\nWhich heavenly truth imparts,\r\nAnd all the lore its scholars need--\r\nPure eyes and loving hearts.\r\n\r\n9.  The works of God, above, below,\r\n      Within us, and around,\r\n    Are pages in that book, to show\r\n      How God himself is found.\r\n\r\n10. The glorious sky, embracing all,\r\n      Is like the Father\'s love;\r\n    Wherewith encompassed, great and small\r\n      In peace and order move.\r\n\r\n11. Thou who hast given me eyes to see\r\n      And love this sight so fair,\r\n    Give me a heart to find out Thee\r\n      And read Thee everywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Blown, blossomed, bloomed. O\'dor, smell, scent. 3. Lair,\r\nbed of a wild beast. Des\'ert, a wilderness, a place where no one lives. 5.\r\nEx\'cel-lent, surpassing others in worth, su-perior. 6. Daz\'zling,\r\noverpowering with light. 7. Per-fec\'tion, the state of being perfect, so\r\nthat nothing is wanting. 8. Im-parts\', makes known. Lore, learning. 10.\r\nEn-com\'passed, surrounded.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISES.--What is described as beautiful? As strong? As glorious? Who is\r\nmore beautiful than the rose, stronger than the lion, and more glorious\r\nthan the sun? What is the book which we may all read? What should it teach\r\nus?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVII. THE HORSE. (128)\r\n\r\n1. Uncle Thomas. Well, boys, I am glad to see you again. Since I last saw\r\nyou I have made quite a tour, and at some future time will describe to you\r\nwhat I have seen. I promised at this meeting, however, to tell you\r\nsomething about animals, and I propose to begin with the horse. But I know\r\nthat you like stories better than lecturing, so I will proceed at once to\r\ntell you some which I have gathered for you.\r\n\r\n2. Frank. We never feel tired of listening to you, Uncle Thomas. We know\r\nyou always have something curious to tell us.\r\n\r\n3. Uncle Thomas. Well then, Frank, to begin at once with the horse.\r\n\r\n4. In several parts of the world there are to be found large herds of wild\r\nhorses. In South America the immense plains are inhabited by them, and it\r\nis said that ten thousand are sometimes found in a single herd. These\r\nherds are always preceded by a leader, who directs their motions; and such\r\nis the regularity with which they perform their movements, that it seems\r\nas if they could hardly be surpassed by the best trained cavalry.\r\n\r\n5. It is extremely dangerous for travelers to meet a herd of this\r\ndescription. When they are unaccustomed to the sight of such a mass of\r\ncreatures, they can not help feeling greatly alarmed at their rapid and\r\napparently irresistible approach. The trampling of the animals sounds like\r\ndistant thunder; and such is the rapidity and impetuosity of their\r\nadvance, that it seems to threaten instant destruction.\r\n\r\n6. Sometimes, however, they suddenly stop short, utter a loud and piercing\r\nneigh, and, with a rapid wheel, take an opposite course, and altogether\r\ndisappear. On such occasions it requires great care in the traveler to\r\nprevent his horses from breaking loose and escaping with the wild herd.\r\n\r\n7. In those countries where wild horses are so plentiful, the inhabitants\r\ndo not take the trouble to raise others, but whenever they want one they\r\nmount upon an animal accustomed to the sport, and gallop over the plain\r\ntoward a herd, which is readily found at no great distance.\r\n\r\n8. The rider gradually approaches some stragglers from the main body, and,\r\nhaving selected the one he wishes, he dexterously throws the lasso (which\r\nis a long rope with a running noose, and is firmly fixed to his saddle)\r\neither over the wild horse\'s head or in such a manner as to entangle his\r\nhind legs; and by the sudden checking of his own horse, he throws the\r\ncaptured animal over on its side.\r\n\r\n9. In an instant he jumps off his horse, wraps his cloak round the head of\r\nthe captive, forces a bit into his mouth, and straps a saddle on his back.\r\nHe then removes the cloak, and the animal starts to his feet. With equal\r\nquickness the hunter leaps into his saddle; and, in spite of the kicking\r\nof the captive, keeps his seat, till, being wearied out with his efforts,\r\nthe horse submits to the guidance of his new master, and is reduced to\r\ncomplete obedience.\r\n\r\n10. Frank. But, Uncle Thomas, are all horses originally wild? I have heard\r\nthat Arabia is famous for raising horses.\r\n\r\n11. Uncle Thomas. Arabia has, for a long time, been noted for the beauty\r\nand speed of its horses. It is not strange, however, that the Arabian\r\nhorse should be the most excellent, when we consider the care and kindness\r\nwith which it is treated. One of the best stories which I have ever heard\r\nof the love of an Arabian for his steed, is that related of an Arab, from\r\nwhom an English officer wished to purchase his horse.\r\n\r\n12. The animal was a bright bay mare, of fine form and great beauty; and\r\nthe owner, proud of her appearance and qualities, paraded her before the\r\nEnglishman\'s tent until she attracted his attention. On being asked if he\r\nwould sell her, "What will you give me?" was the reply. "That depends upon\r\nher age. I suppose she is past five?" "Guess again," said he. "Four?"\r\n"Look at her mouth," said the Arab, with a smile. On examination she was\r\nfound to be about three. This, from her size and symmetry, greatly\r\nincreased her value.\r\n\r\n13. The gentleman said, "I will give you eighty tomans," (nearly two\r\nhundred and fifty dollars). "A little more, if you please," said the\r\nfellow, somewhat entertained. "Ninety--a hundred." He shook his head and\r\nsmiled. The officer at last came to three hundred tomans, (nearly one\r\nthousand dollars). "Well," said the Arab, "you need not tempt me further.\r\nYou are a rich nobleman, and, I am told, have loads of silver and gold.\r\nNow," added he, "you want my mare, but you shall not have her for all you\r\nhave got." He put spurs to his horse, and was soon out of the reach of\r\ntemptation.\r\n\r\n14. The horse can swim, when necessary, as well as most other animals,\r\nalthough he is not very fond of the water. Some years ago a vessel was\r\ndriven upon the rocks, on the coast of the Cape of Good Hope, and most of\r\nthe crew fell an immediate sacrifice to the waves. Those who were left\r\nwere seen from the shore, clinging to the different pieces of the wreck.\r\nThe sea ran so high that no boat could venture off to their assistance.\r\n\r\n15. Meanwhile, a planter had come from his farm to be a spectator of the\r\nshipwreck. His heart was melted at the sight of the unhappy seamen, and,\r\nknowing the bold spirit of his horse and his excellence as a swimmer, he\r\ndetermined to make a desperate effort for their deliverance. Having blown\r\na little Brandy into his horse\'s nostrils, he pushed into the midst of the\r\nbreakers. At first both horse and rider disappeared, but it was not long\r\nbefore they floated to the surface, and swam up to the wreck; when, taking\r\ntwo men with him, each of whom held on by one of his boots, the planter\r\nbrought them safe to shore.\r\n\r\n16. This was repeated no less than seven times, and he saved fourteen\r\nlives; but on his return the eighth time, being much fatigued, and meeting\r\na tremendous wave, he lost his balance and sank in a moment. His horse\r\nswam safely to land, but its gallant rider sank, to rise no more.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--4. Im-mense\', very large. In-hab\'it-ed, occupied as a home.\r\nCav\'al-ry, a body of military troops on horses. 5. Im--pet-u-os\'i-ty,\r\nfury, violence. 8. Dex\'ter-ous-ly, skillfully. 9. Re--duced\', brought\r\ninto. 10. O-rig\'i-nal-ly, at first. 12. Pa-rad\'ed, showed off.\r\n8. Sym\'me-try, a proper proportion of the several parts. 13. To-man\', a\r\nPersian coin valued at about three dollars. 15. Des\'per-ate, without care\r\nof safety. De-liv\'er-ance, release from danger. 16. Gal\'lant, brave,\r\nheroic.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISES.--Where are wild horses found? How are they taken? For what\r\npurpose are they taken? In what country are the finest horses raised? Why\r\nare the horses so excellent there? Are not animals always made better by\r\nkind treatment? Why would not the Arab sell his horse? Relate the anecdote\r\nof the planter and the shipwrecked seamen.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLVIII. EMULATION. (132)\r\n\r\n1. Frank\'s father was speaking to a friend, one day, on the subject of\r\ncompetition at school. He said that he could answer for it that envy is\r\nnot always connected with it.\r\n\r\n2. He had been excelled by many, but did not recollect ever having felt\r\nenvious of his successful rivals; "nor did my winning many a prize from my\r\nfriend Birch," said he, "ever lessen his friendship for me."\r\n\r\n3. In support of the truth of this, a friend who was present related an\r\nanecdote which had fallen under his own notice in a school in his\r\nneighborhood.\r\n\r\n4. At this school the sons of several wealthy farmers, and others, who\r\nwere poorer, received instruction. Frank listened with great attention\r\nwhile the gentleman gave the following account of the two rivals:\r\n\r\n5. It happened that the son of a rich farmer and the son of a poor widow\r\ncame in competition for the head of their class. They were so nearly equal\r\nthat the teacher could scarcely decide between them; some days one, and\r\nsome days the other, gained the head of the class. It was determined by\r\nseeing who should be at the head of the class for the greater number of\r\ndays in the week.\r\n\r\n6. The widow\'s son, by the last day\'s trial, gained the victory, and kept\r\nhis place the following week, till the school was dismissed for the\r\nholidays.\r\n\r\n7. When they met again the widow\'s son did not appear, and the farmer\'s\r\nson, being next to him, might now have been at the head of his class.\r\nInstead of seizing the vacant place, however, he went to the widow\'s house\r\nto inquire what could be the cause of her son\'s absence.\r\n\r\n8. Poverty was the cause; the poor woman found that she was not able, with\r\nher utmost efforts, to continue to pay for the tuition and books of her\r\nson, and so he, poor fellow! had been compelled to give up his schooling,\r\nand to return to labor for her support.\r\n\r\n9. The farmer\'s son, out of the allowance of pocket money which his father\r\ngave him, bought all the necessary books and paid for the tuition of his\r\nrival. He also permitted him to be brought back again to the head of his\r\nclass, where he continued for some time, at the expense of his generous\r\nrival.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--Em-u-la\'tion, rivalry, contest. 1. Com-pe-ti\'tion, rivalry.\r\n2. Ex-celled\', surpassed, exceeded in good qualities. Ri\'vals, those who\r\npursue the same thing. 3. An\'ec-dote, a short story. 8. Tu-i\'tion, payment\r\nfor teaching.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISES.--What is the subject of this lesson? What do you mean by\r\nemulation? What is envy? What story is told about the two rivals? Is it\r\nright to envy any person?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXLIX. THE SANDPIPER. (134)\r\nBy CELIA THAXTER.\r\n\r\n1. Across the lonely beach we flit,\r\n     One little sandpiper and I,\r\n   And fast I gather, bit by bit,\r\n     The scattered driftwood, bleached and dry.\r\n   The wild waves reach their hands for it,\r\n     The wild wind raves, the tide runs high,\r\n   As up and down the beach we flit,\r\n     One little sandpiper and I.\r\n\r\n2. Above our heads the sullen clouds\r\n     Scud, black and swift, across the sky;\r\n   Like silent ghosts in misty shrouds\r\n     Stand out the white lighthouses high.\r\n   Almost as far as eye can reach\r\n     I see the close-reefed vessels fly,\r\n   As fast we flit across the beach,\r\n     One little sandpiper and I.\r\n\r\n3. I watch him as he skims along,\r\n     Uttering his sweet and mournful cry;\r\n   He starts not at my fitful song,\r\n     Nor flash of fluttering drapery.\r\n   He has no thought of any wrong,\r\n     He scans me with a fearless eye;\r\n   Stanch friends are we, well-tried and strong,\r\n     The little sandpiper and I.\r\n\r\n4. Comrade, where wilt thou be to-night,\r\n     When the loosed storm breaks furiously?\r\n   My driftwood fire will burn so bright!\r\n     To what warm shelter canst thou fly?\r\n   I do not fear for thee, though wroth\r\n     The tempest rushes through the sky;\r\n   For are we not God\'s children both,\r\n     Thou, little sandpiper, and I?\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--l. Sand\'pi-per, a bird of the snipe family, found along the\r\nseacoast. Drift\'wood. wood tossed on shore by the waves. Bleached,\r\nwhitened. Tide, the regular rise and fall of the ocean which occurs twice\r\nin a little over twenty-four hours. 2. Scud, fly hastily. Shrouds, Winding\r\nsheets, dresses of the dead. Close\'reefed, with sails contracted as much\r\nas possible. 3. Fit\'ful, irregularly variable. Draper-y, garments. Scans,\r\nlooks at care-fully. Stanch, firm. 4. Wroth, angry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nL. THE RIGHT WAY. (136)\r\n\r\nAdapted from a story by Frank H. Stockton. He was born at Philadelphia,\r\nApril 5, 1834, and when quite a young boy used to write stories for his\r\nown pleasure. He was once a designer and engraver on wood, and afterwards\r\nan editor; but he now devotes himself entirely to writing, not only for\r\nyoung but also for grown people.\r\n\r\n1. "O Andy!" said little Jenny Murdock, "I\'m so glad you came along this\r\nway. I can\'t get over."\r\n\r\n2. "Can\'t get over?" said Andrew. "Why what\'s the matter?"\r\n\r\n3. "The bridge is gone," said Jenny. "When I came across after breakfast\r\nit was there, and now it\'s over on the other side, and how can I get back\r\nhome?"\r\n\r\n4. "Why, so it is," said Andrew. "It was all right when I came over a\r\nlittle while ago, but old Donald pulls it on the other side every morning\r\nafter he has driven his cows across, and I don\'t think he has any right to\r\ndo it. I suppose he thinks the bridge was made for him and his cows."\r\n\r\n5. "Now I must go down to the big bridge, Andy, and I want you to go with\r\nme. I\'m afraid to go through all those dark woods by myself," said Jenny.\r\n\r\n6. "But I can\'t go, Jenny," said Andrew, "it\'s nearly school time now."\r\n\r\n7. Andrew was a Scotch boy, and a fine fellow. He was next to the head of\r\nhis school, and he was as good at play as he was at his book.\r\n\r\n8. Jenny Murdock, his most particular friend, was a little girl who lived\r\nvery near Andrew\'s home. She had no brothers or sisters, but Andrew had\r\nalways been as good as a brother to her; and, therefore, when she stood by\r\nthe water\'s edge that morning, just ready to burst into tears, she thought\r\nall her troubles over when she saw Andrew coming along the road.\r\n\r\n9. He had always helped her out of her troubles before, and she saw no\r\nreason why he should not do it now. She had crossed the creek in search of\r\nwild flowers, and when she wished to return had found the bridge removed,\r\nas Andrew supposed, by old Donald McKensie, who pastured his cows on this\r\nside of the creek.\r\n\r\n10. This stream was not very wide, nor very deep at its\r\nedges, but the center it was four or five feet deep; and in the\r\nspring the water ran very swiftly, so that wading across it,\r\neither by cattle or men, was quite a difficult undertaking. As\r\nfor Jenny, she could not get across at all without a bridge,\r\nand there was none nearer than the wagon bridge, a mile and\r\na half below.\r\n\r\n11. "You will go with me, Andy, won\'t you?" said the little girl.\r\n\r\n12. "And be late to school?" said he. "I have not been late yet, you know,\r\nJenny."\r\n\r\n13. "Perhaps Dominie Black will think you have been sick or had to mind\r\nthe cows," said Jenny.\r\n\r\n14. "He won\'t think so unless I tell him," said Andrew, "and you know I\r\nwon\'t do that."\r\n\r\n15. "If we were to run all the way, would you be too late?" said Jenny.\r\n\r\n16. "If we were to run all the way to the bridge, and I were to run all\r\nthe way back, I should not get to school till after copy time. I expect\r\nevery minute to hear the school bell ring," said Andrew.\r\n\r\n17. "But what can I do, then?" said poor little Jenny. "I can\'t wait here\r\ntill school\'s out, and I don\'t want to go up to the schoolhouse, for all\r\nthe boys to laugh at me."\r\n\r\n18. "No," said Andrew, reflecting very seriously, "I must take you home\r\nsome way or other. It won\'t do to leave you here, and, no matter where you\r\nmight stay, your mother would be very much troubled about you."\r\n\r\n19. "Yes," said Jenny, "she would think I was drowned."\r\n\r\n20. Time pressed, and Jenny\'s countenance became more and more overcast,\r\nbut Andrew could think of no way in which he could take the little girl\r\nhome without being late and losing his standing in the school.\r\n\r\n21. It was impossible to get her across the stream at any place nearer\r\nthan the "big bridge;" he would not take her that way, and make up a false\r\nstory to account for his lateness at school, and he could not leave her\r\nalone or take her with him.\r\n\r\n22. What was to be done? While several absurd and impracticable plans were\r\npassing through his brain, the school bell began to ring, and he must\r\nstart immediately to reach the schoolhouse in time.\r\n\r\n23. And now his anxiety and perplexity became more intense than ever; and\r\nJenny, looking up into his troubled countenance, began to cry.\r\n\r\n24. Andrew, who had never before failed to be at the school door before\r\nthe first tap of the bell, began to despair. Was there nothing to be done?\r\n\r\n25. Yes! a happy thought passed through his mind. How strange that he\r\nshould not have thought of it before! He would ask Dominie Black to let\r\nhim take Jenny home. What could be more sensible and straightforward than\r\nsuch a plan?\r\n\r\n26. Of course, the good old schoolmaster gave Andrew the desired\r\npermission, and everything ended happily. But the best thing about the\r\nwhole affair was the lesson that the young Scotch boy learned that day.\r\n\r\n27. The lesson was this: when we are puzzling our brains with plans to\r\nhelp ourselves out of trouble, let us always stop a moment in our\r\nplanning, and try to think if there is not some simple way out of the\r\ndifficulty, which shall be in every respect perfectly right. If we do\r\nthis, we shall probably find a way more easy and satisfactory than any\r\nwhich we can devise.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--8. Par-tic\'u-lar, not ordinary, worthy of partic-ular\r\nattention, chief. 13. Dom\'i-nie, the Scotch name for school-master. 18.\r\nRe-flect\'ing, thinking earnestly. 20 Over-cast\', cov-ered with gloom. 21.\r\nAc-count\', to state the reasons. 22. Im--prac\'ti-ca-ble, not possible. 23.\r\nAnx-i\'e-ty, care, trouble of mind. 27. De-vise\', plan, contrive.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISES.--Why could not Jenny cross the stream? Whom did she ask to help\r\nher? What can you tell about Andrew? Who was Jenny Murdock? What did Jenny\r\nwish Andrew to do? Why could he not go with her? Would it have been right\r\nfor Andrew to have told an untruth even to help Jenny out of trouble? What\r\ndid he finally do? What does this lesson teach us to do in case of\r\ntrouble?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLI. THE GOLDEN RULE. (139)\r\n\r\n1. To act with integrity and good faith was such a habit with Susan that\r\nshe had never before thought of examining the Golden Rule: "All things\r\nwhatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so to them." But\r\nthe longer she reflected upon it, the stronger was her conviction that she\r\ndid not always obey the precept; at length, she appealed to her mother for\r\nits meaning.\r\n\r\n2. "It implies," said her mother, "in the first place, a total destruction\r\nof all selfishness: for a man who loves himself better than his neighbors,\r\ncan never do to others as he would have others do to him. We are bound not\r\nonly to do, but to feel, toward others as we would have others feel toward\r\nus. Remember, it is much easier to reprove the sin of others than to\r\novercome temptation when it assails ourselves.\r\n\r\n3. "A man may be perfectly honest and yet very selfish; but the command\r\nimplies something more than mere honesty; it requires charity as well as\r\nintegrity. The meaning of the command is fully explained in the parable of\r\nthe Good Samaritan. The Levite, who passed by the wounded man without\r\noffering him assistance, may have been a man of great honesty; but he did\r\nnot do unto the poor stranger as he would have wished others to do unto\r\nhim."\r\n\r\n4. Susan pondered carefully and seriously on what her mother had said.\r\nWhen she thought over her past conduct, a blush of shame crept to her\r\ncheeks, and a look of sorrow into her eyes, as many little acts of\r\nselfishness and unkindness came back to her memory. She resolved that for\r\nthe future, both in great things and small, she would remember and follow\r\nthe Golden Rule.\r\n\r\n5. It was not long after this that an opportunity occurred of trying\r\nSusan\'s principles. One Saturday evening when she went, as usual, to\r\nfarmer Thompson\'s inn, to receive the price of her mother\'s washing for\r\nthe boarders, which amounted to five dollars, she found the farmer in the\r\nstable yard.\r\n\r\n6. He was apparently in a terrible rage with some horse dealers with whom\r\nhe had been bargaining. He held in his hand an open pocketbook, full of\r\nbills; and scarcely noticing the child as she made her request, except to\r\nswear at her, as usual, for troubling him when he was busy, he handed her\r\na bank note.\r\n\r\n7. Glad to escape so easily, Susan hurried out of the gate, and then,\r\npausing to pin the money safely in the folds of her shawl, she discovered\r\nthat he had given her two bills instead of one. She looked around; nobody\r\nwas near to share her discovery; and her first impulse was joy at the\r\nunexpected prize.\r\n\r\n8. "It is mine, all mine," said she to herself; "I will buy\r\nmother a new cloak with it, and she can give her old one to\r\nsister Mary, and then Mary can go to the Sunday school with\r\nme next winter. I wonder if it will not buy a pair of shoes for\r\nbrother Tom, too."\r\n\r\n9. At that moment she remembered that he must have given it to her by\r\nmistake; and therefore she had no right to it. But again the voice of the\r\ntempter whispered, "He gave it, and how do you know that he did not intend\r\nto make you a present of it? Keep it; he will never know it, even if it\r\nshould be a mistake; for he had too many such bills in that great\r\npocketbook to miss one."\r\n\r\n10. While this conflict was going on in her mind between good and evil,\r\nshe was hurrying homeward as fast as possible. Yet, before she came in\r\nsight of her home, she had repeatedly balanced the comforts which the\r\nmoney would buy against the sin of wronging her neighbor.\r\n\r\n11. As she crossed the little bridge over the narrow creek before her\r\nmother\'s door, her eye fell upon a rustic seat which they had occupied\r\nduring the conversation I have before narrated. Instantly the words of\r\nScripture, "Whatsoever ye would that men should do to you, do ye even so\r\nto them," sounded in her ears like a trumpet.\r\n\r\n12. Turning suddenly round, as if flying from some unseen peril, the child\r\nhastened along the road with breathless speed until she found herself once\r\nmore at farmer Thompson\'s gate. "What do you want now?" asked the gruff\r\nold fellow, as he saw her again at his side.\r\n\r\n13. "Sir, you paid me two bills, instead of one," said she, trembling in\r\nevery limb. "Two bills? did I? let me see; well, so I did; but did you\r\njust find it out? Why did you not bring it back sooner?" Susan blushed and\r\nhung her head.\r\n\r\n14. "You wanted to keep it, I suppose," said he. "Well, I am glad your\r\nmother was more honest than you, or I should have been five dollars poorer\r\nand none the wiser." "My mother knows nothing about it, sir," said Susan;\r\n"I brought it back before I went home."\r\n\r\n15. The old man looked at the child, and, as he saw the tears rolling down\r\nher checks, he seemed touched by her distress. Putting his band in his\r\npocket, he drew out a shilling and offered it to her.\r\n\r\n16. "No, sir, I thank you," sobbed she; "I do not want to be paid for\r\ndoing right; I only wish you would not think me dishonest, for, indeed, it\r\nwas a sore temptation. Oh! sir, if you had ever seen those you love best\r\nwanting the common comforts of life, you would know how hard it is for us\r\nalways to do unto others as we would have others do unto us,"\r\n\r\n17. The heart of the selfish man was touched. "There be things which are\r\nlittle upon the earth, but they are exceeding wise," murmured he, as he\r\nbade the little girl good night, and entered his house a sadder, and, it\r\nis to be hoped, a better man. Susan returned to her humble home with a\r\nlightened heart, and through the course of a long and useful life she\r\nnever forgot her first temptation.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1. In-teg\'ri-ty, honesty, uprightness. Con-vic\'tion, strong\r\nbelief. Ap-pealed\', referred to. 2. Temp-ta\'tion, that which has a\r\ntendency to induce one to do wrong. As-sails\', attacks. 10. Con\'flict,\r\nstruggle. Bal\'anced, weighed, compared. 12. Gruff, rough. 17. Mur\'mured,\r\nspoke in a low voice. Light\'ened, made cheerful or lighter.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISES.--What is the Golden Rule? What does it imply? Can a man be\r\nperfectly honest and still not follow the Golden Rule? What parable is a\r\nperfect illustration of its meaning? How was Susan tempted? What did she\r\nfirst think of doing? What changed her intention? Relate what happened\r\nwhen she returned the money. What effect did her action have?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLII. THE SNOW MAN. (143)\r\nBy Marian Douglas.\r\n\r\n1. Look! how the clouds are flying south!\r\n     The winds pipe loud and shrill!\r\n   And high above the white drifts stands\r\n     The snow man on the hill.\r\n\r\n2. Blow, wild wind from the icy north!\r\n     Here\'s one who will not fear\r\n   To feel thy coldest touch, or shrink\r\n     Thy loudest blast to hear.\r\n\r\n3. Proud triumph of the schoolboy\'s skill!\r\n     Far rather would I be\r\n   A winter giant, ruling o\'er\r\n     A frosty realm, like thee,\r\n\r\n4. And stand amid the drifted snow,\r\n     Like thee, a thing apart,\r\n   Than be a man who walks with men,\r\n     But has a frozen heart!\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--l. Pipe, whistle. 2. Shrink, to draw back on account of\r\nfear. 3. Triumph, success causing exultation. Realm, the territory over\r\nwhich authority is used, dominion.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISES.--With what is the snow man compared in this poem? What is meant\r\nby a man with "a frozen heart"? Do you think such a man would follow the\r\nGolden Rule?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIII. ROBINSON CRUSOE\'S HOUSE. (144)\r\n\r\nDaniel DeFoe, the author of "Robinson Crusoe" (from which these selections\r\nare adapted), was born in London, England, in 1661, and died in 1731. He\r\nwrote a number of books; but his "Robinson Crusoe" is the only one that\r\nattained great notoriety.\r\n\r\n1. I have already described my habitation, which was a tent under the side\r\nof a rock, surrounded with a strong pale of posts and cables, but I might\r\nnow rather call it a wall, for I raised a kind of wall up against it of\r\nturf, about two feet thick on the outside; and, after some time (I think\r\nit was a year and a half) I raised rafters from it, leaning to the rock,\r\nand thatched or covered it with boughs of trees and such things as I could\r\nget to keep out the rain, which I found at some times of the year very\r\nviolent.\r\n\r\n2. I have already observed how I brought all my goods into this pale, and\r\ninto the cave which I had made behind me; but I must observe, too, that at\r\nfirst this was a confused heap of goods, which, as they lay in no order,\r\ntook up all my place, so that I had no room to turn myself. So I set to\r\nwork to enlarge my cave and work farther into the earth; for it was a\r\nloose, sandy rock, which yielded easily to the labor I bestowed upon it.\r\n\r\n3. And so when I found that I was pretty safe as to beasts of prey, I\r\nworked sideways into the rock; and then, turning to the right again,\r\nworked quite out, and made me a door to come out on the outside of my pale\r\nor fortification. This gave me not only egress and regress, as it was a\r\nback way to my tent and to my storehouse, but gave me room to stow my\r\ngoods.\r\n\r\n4. And now I began to apply myself to make such necessary things as I\r\nfound I most wanted, particularly a chair and a table; for without these I\r\nwas not able to enjoy the few comforts I had in the world. I could not\r\nwrite or eat, or do several things with so much pleasure without a table.\r\n\r\n5. So I went to work. I had never handled a tool in my life; and yet in\r\ntime by labor, application, and contrivance, I found that I wanted nothing\r\nbut I could have made it, especially if I had had tools; however, I made\r\nabundance of things, even without tools, and some with no more tools than\r\nan adz and a hatchet, which perhaps were never made that way before, and\r\nthat with infinite labor.\r\n\r\n6. For example, if I wanted a board, I had no other way but to cut down a\r\ntree, set it before me, and hew it flat on either side with my ax till I\r\nhad brought it to be as thin as a plank, and then dub it smooth with my\r\nadz.\r\n\r\n7. It is true, by this method I could make but one board out of a whole\r\ntree; but this I had no remedy for but patience, any more than I had for\r\nthe prodigious deal of time and labor which it took me to make a plank or\r\nboard; but my time or labor was little worth, and so it was as well\r\nemployed one way as another.\r\n\r\n8. However, I made me a table and a chair, as I observed above; and this I\r\ndid out of the short pieces of boards which I brought on my raft from the\r\nship; but when I had wrought out some boards, as above, I made large\r\nshelves, of the breadth of a foot and a half, one over another, all along\r\none side of my cave, to lay all my tools, nails, and ironwork on, and, in\r\na word, to separate everything at large in their places, that I might come\r\neasily at them.\r\n\r\n9. I knocked pieces into the wall of the rock to hang my guns and all\r\nthings that would hang up. So that, had my cave been seen, it would have\r\nlooked like a general magazine of all necessary things; and I had\r\neverything so ready at my hand that it was a great pleasure to me to see\r\nall my goods in such order, and especially to find my stock of all\r\nnecessaries so great.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--l. Hab-i-ta\'tion, a dwelling place. Pale, a fence. Ca\'bles,\r\nlarge ropes. Turf, sod. 3. For-ti-fi-ca\'tion, a place built for defense\r\nagainst attack. E\'gress, going out. Re\'gress, coming back, return. Stow,\r\nto arrange compactly. 4. Ap-ply\', to employ diligently. 6. Dub, to cut\r\ndown or bring to an even surface. 7. Pro-di\'gious, very great. Deal, part,\r\namount. 9. Mag-a-zine\', a storehouse,\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISES.--How did Robinson Crusoe make a house? Of what did he make a\r\nchair and table? How did he obtain boards? What does this lesson teach us\r\nin regard to perseverance?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIV. ROBINSON CRUSOE\'S DRESS. (147)\r\n\r\n1. But had any man in England met such a man as I was, it must either have\r\nfrightened him or raised a great deal of laughter; and, as I frequently\r\nstood still to look at myself, I could not but smile at the notion of my\r\ntraveling through Yorkshire in such a dress.\r\n\r\n2. I had a great, high, shapeless cap, made of a goat\'s skin, with a flap\r\nhanging down behind, as well to keep the sun from me as to shoot the rain\r\noff from running into my neck; nothing being so hurtful in these climates\r\nas the rain upon the flesh under the clothes.\r\n\r\n3. I had a short jacket of goatskin, the skirts coming down to about the\r\nmiddle of the thighs, and a pair of open-kneed breeches of the same; the\r\nbreeches were made of the skin of an old goat, and the hair hung down such\r\na length on either side that it reached to the middle of my legs like\r\npantaloons.\r\n\r\n4. Stockings and shoes I had none; but I made a pair of something, I\r\nscarce know what to call them, like buskins, to flap over my legs, and\r\nlace on either side like spatterdashes; but they were of a most barbarous\r\nshape, as indeed were all the rest of my clothes.\r\n\r\n5. I had on a broad belt of goatskin dried, which I drew together with two\r\nthongs of the same, instead of buckles; and, in a kind of frog on each\r\nside of this, instead of a sword and dagger, hung a little saw and\r\nhatchet; one on one side, and one on the other. I had another belt not so\r\nbroad, and fastened in the same manner, which hung over my shoulder; and\r\nat the end of it, under my left arm, hung two pouches, both made of\r\ngoatskin, too; in one of which hung my powder, in the other my shot.\r\n\r\n6. At my back I carried my basket, on my shoulder my gun, and over my head\r\na great, clumsy, ugly, goatskin umbrella, but which, after all, was the\r\nmost necessary thing I had about me, next to my gun.\r\n\r\n7. As for my face, the color of it was really not so dark as one might\r\nexpect from a man not at all careful of it, and living within nine or ten\r\ndegrees of the equator. My beard I had once suffered to grow till it was\r\nabout a quarter of a yard long; but, as I had both scissors and razors\r\nsufficient, I had cut it pretty short, except what grew on my upper lip,\r\nwhich I had trimmed into a large pair of Mahometan whiskers, such as I had\r\nseen worn by some Turks.\r\n\r\n8. Of these mustaches or whiskers, I will not say that they were long\r\nenough to hang my hat upon them, but they were of a length and shape\r\nmonstrous enough, and such as in England would have passed for frightful.\r\nBut all this is by the bye; for, as to my figure, I had so few to observe\r\nme that it was of no manner of consequence; so I say no more on that part.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--4. Bus\'kins, coverings for the feet coming some distance up\r\nthe leg, and fit for a defense against thorns, etc. Spat\'-ter-dash-es,\r\ncoverings for the legs to keep them clean from water and mud. Bar\'ba-rous,\r\nuncouth, clumsy. 5. Thongs, strips of leather. Frog, a loop similar to\r\nthat sometimes used in fastening a cloak or coat. Pouch\'es bags. 8.\r\nMon\'strous, very large, enormous.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--The novel, "Robinson Crusoe," was first published in 1719. It was\r\nfounded on the adventures of Alexander Selkirk, a Scotch buccaneer, who\r\nwas cast on the island of Juan Fernandez, west of South America, in 1704,\r\nand remained there for more than four years, before he was rescued.\r\n\r\n1. Yorkshire. This was the district of England where, according to the\r\nstory, Robinson Crusoe was born and passed his early life.\r\n\r\n3. Open-kneed breeches. At this period knee breeches were worn almost\r\naltogether in England. Those referred to here appear to have been loose\r\nabout the knee, and not close, as usual.\r\n\r\n5. Instead of sword and dagger. It was then the fashion in England for\r\ngentlemen to wear such weapons.\r\n\r\n8. Such as in England would have passed for frightful. It was not the\r\ncustom in England, in DeFoe\'s time, to wear a full beard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLV. SOMEBODY\'S DARLING. (150)\r\n\r\n1. Into a ward of the whitewashed halls,\r\n     Where the dead and dying lay,\r\n   Wounded by bayonets, shells, and balls,\r\n     Somebody\'s darling was borne one day;\r\n\r\n2. Somebody\'s darling, so young and brave,\r\n     Wearing yet on his pale, sweet face,\r\n   Soon to be hid by the dust of the grave,\r\n     The lingering light of his boyhood\'s grace.\r\n\r\n3. Matted and damp are the curls of gold,\r\n     Kissing the snow of that fair young brow;\r\n   Pale are the lips of delicate mold\r\n     Somebody\'s darling is dying now.\r\n\r\n4. Back from his beautiful, blue-veined brow,\r\n     Brush all the wandering waves of gold;\r\n   Cross his hands on his bosom now;\r\n     Somebody\'s darling is still and cold.\r\n\r\n5. Kiss him once for somebody\'s sake,\r\n     Murmur a prayer soft and low;\r\n   One bright curl from its fair mates take;\r\n     They were somebody\'s pride, you know;\r\n\r\n6. Somebody\'s hand has rested there;\r\n     Was it a mother\'s, soft and white?\r\n   And have the lips of a sister fair\r\n     Been baptized in the waves of light?\r\n\r\n7. God knows best! he was somebody\'s love:\r\n     Somebody\'s heart enshrined him there;\r\n   Somebody wafted his name above,\r\n     Night and morn, on the wings of prayer.\r\n\r\n8. Somebody wept when he marched away,\r\n     Looking so handsome, brave, and grand;\r\n   Somebody\'s kiss on his forehead lay;\r\n     Somebody clung to his parting hand.\r\n\r\n9. Somebody\'s watching and waiting for him,\r\n     Yearning to hold him again to her heart;\r\n   And there he lies, with his blue eyes dim,\r\n     And the smiling, childlike lips apart.\r\n\r\n10. Tenderly bury the fair young dead,\r\n      Pausing too drop on his grave a tear;\r\n    Carve on the wooden slab at his head,\r\n     "Somebody\'s darling slumbers here."\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Bay\'o-net, a short, pointed iron weapon, fitted to the\r\nmuzzle of a gun. Dar\'ling, one dearly loved. 2. Lin\'ger-ing, protracted.\r\n3. Mat\'ted, twisted together. Del\'i-cate, soft and fair. Mold, shape. 4.\r\nWan\'der-ing, straying. 7. En-shrined\', cherished. Waft\'ed, caused to\r\nfloat. 9. Yearn\'ing, being eager, longing. 10. Ten\'der-ly, gently, kindly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLVI. KNOWLEDGE IS POWER. (151)\r\n\r\n1. "What an excellent thing is knowledge," said a sharp-looking, hustling\r\nlittle man, to one who was much older than himself. "Knowledge is an\r\nexcellent thing," repeated he. "My boys know more at six and seven years\r\nold than I did at twelve. They can read all sorts of books, and talk on\r\nall sorts of subjects. The world is a great deal wiser than it used to he.\r\nEverybody knows something of everything now. Do you not think, sir, that\r\nknowledge is all excellent thing?"\r\n\r\n2. "Why, sir," replied the old man, looking grave, "that depends entirely\r\nupon the use to which it is applied. It may be a blessing or a curse.\r\nKnowledge is only an increase of power, and power may be a bad, as well as\r\na good thing." "That is what I can not understand," said the bustling\r\nlittle man. "How can power he a bad thing?"\r\n\r\n3. "I will tell you," meekly replied the old man; and thus he went on:\r\n"When the power of a horse is under restraint, the animal is useful in\r\nbearing burdens, drawing loads, and carrying his master; but when that\r\npower is unrestrained, the horse breaks his bridle, dashes to pieces the\r\ncarriage that he draws, or throws his rider." "I see!" said the little\r\nman.\r\n\r\n4. "When the water of a large pond is properly conducted by trenches, it\r\nrenders the fields around fertile; but when it bursts through its banks,\r\nit sweeps everything before it and destroys the produce of the fields." "I\r\nsee!" said the little man, "I see!"\r\n\r\n5. "When the ship is steered aright, the sail that she hoists enables her\r\nsooner to get into port; but if steered wrong, the more sail she carries\r\nthe further will she go out of her course." "I see!" said the little man,\r\n"I see clearly!"\r\n\r\n6. "Well, then," continued the old man, "if you see these things so\r\nclearly, I hope you can see, too, that knowledge, to be a good thing, must\r\nbe rightly applied. God\'s grace in the heart will render the knowledge of\r\nthe head a blessing; but without this, it may prove to us no better than a\r\ncurse." "I see! I see!" said the little man, "I see!"\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--l. Bus\'tling, very active, stirring. Sub\'ject, the thing\r\ntreated of. 3. Meek\'ly, mildly, quietly, gently. Re-straint\', anything\r\nwhich hinders. Bur\'dens, loads. 4. Con-duct\'ed, led, guided. Trench\'es,\r\nditches. Fer\'tile, producing much fruit, rich. Prod\'uce, that which is\r\nyielded or produced. 5. Steered\', guided, directed. Hoists, raises. 6.\r\nAp-plied\', directed, made use of.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISES--What is the subject of this lesson? Is knowledge always a\r\npower? Is it always blessing? Relate the several examples of power wrongly\r\nused. If we use the powers that God has given us for bad purposes, what\r\nwill our knowledge prove to be?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLVII. GOOD WILL. (153)\r\nBy J. T. Trowbridge.--(Adapted)\r\n\r\n1. I suppose you all, my boys, are looking for some sort of success in\r\nlife; it is right that you should; but what are your notions of success?\r\nTo get rich as soon as possible, without regard to the means by which your\r\nwealth is acquired?\r\n\r\n2. There is no true success in that: when you have gained millions, you\r\nmay yet be poorer than when you had nothing; and it is that same reckless\r\nambition which has brought many a bright and capable boy, not to great\r\nestate at last, but to miserable failure and disgrace; not to a palace,\r\nbut to a prison.\r\n\r\n3. Wealth rightly got and rightly used, rational enjoyment, power,\r\nfame,--these are all worthy objects of ambition; but they are not the\r\nhighest objects, and you may acquire them all without achieving true\r\nsuccess. But if, whatever you seek, you put good will into all your\r\nactions, you are sure of the best success at last; for whatever else you\r\ngain or miss, you are building up a noble and beautiful character, which\r\nis not only the best of possessions in this world, but also is about all\r\nyou can expect to take with you into the next.\r\n\r\n4. I say, good will in all your actions. You are not simply to be kind and\r\nhelpful to others; but, whatever you do, give honest, earnest purpose to\r\nit. Thomas is put by his parents to learn a business. But Thomas does not\r\nlike to apply himself very closely. "What\'s the use?" he says. "I\'m not\r\npaid much, and I\'m not going to work much. I\'ll get along just as easily\r\nas I can, and have as good times as I can."\r\n\r\n5. So he shirks his tasks; and instead of thinking about his employer\'s\r\ninterests, or his own self improvement, gives his mind to trifles,--often\r\nto evil things, which in their ruinous effects upon his life are not\r\ntrifles. As soon as he is free from his daily duties, he is off with his\r\ncompanions, having what they call a good time; his heart is with them even\r\nwhile his hands are employed in the shop or store.\r\n\r\n6. He does nothing thoroughly well,--not at all for want of talent, but\r\nsolely for lack of good will. He is not preparing himself to be one of\r\nthose efficient clerks or workmen who are always in demand, and who\r\nreceive the highest wages.\r\n\r\n7. There is a class of people who are the pest of every community, workmen\r\nwho do not know their trade, men of business ignorant of the first\r\nprinciples of business. They can never be relied upon to do well anything\r\nthey undertake. They are always making blunders which other people have to\r\nsuffer for, and which react upon themselves. They are always getting out\r\nof employment, and failing in business.\r\n\r\n8. To make up for what they lack in knowledge and thoroughness, they often\r\nresort to trick and fraud, and become not merely contemptible but\r\ncriminal. Thomas is preparing himself to be one of this class. You can\r\nnot, boys, expect to raise a good crop from evil seed.\r\n\r\n9. By Thomas\'s side works another boy, whom we will call James,--a lad of\r\nonly ordinary capacity, very likely. If Thomas and all the other boys did\r\ntheir best, there would be but small chance for James ever to become\r\neminent. But he has something better than talent: he brings good will to\r\nhis work. Whatever he learns, he learns so well that it becomes a part of\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\n10. His employers find that they can depend upon Jim. Customers soon learn\r\nto like and trust him. By diligence, self-culture, good habits, cheerful\r\nand kindly conduct, he is laying the foundation of a generous manhood and\r\na genuine success.\r\n\r\n11. In short, boys, by slighting your tasks you hurt yourself more than\r\nyou wrong your employer. By honest service you benefit yourself more than\r\nyou help him. If you were aiming at mere worldly advancement only, I\r\nshould still say that good will was the very best investment you could\r\nmake in business.\r\n\r\n12. By cheating a customer, you gain only a temporary and unreal\r\nadvantage. By serving him with right good will,--doing by him as you\r\nwould be done by,--you not only secure his confidence but also his good\r\nwill in return. But this is a sordid consideration compared with the\r\ninward satisfaction, the glow and expansion of soul which attend a good\r\naction done for itself alone. If I were to sum up all I have to say to you\r\nin one last word of love and counsel, that one word should be--Good will.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--3. Char\'ac-ter, the sum of qualities which distin-guish one\r\nperson from another. 4. Purpose, intention, aim. 7. Prin\'ci-ples, fixed\r\nrules. 9. Ca-pac\'i-ty, ability, the power of re-ceiving ideas. 12.\r\nSor\'did, base, meanly avaricious.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISES.--What is meant by the phrase "to apply himself," in the fourth\r\nparagraph? What is meant by "a generous manhood," tenth paragraph? By\r\n"expansion of soul," twelfth paragraph? Tell what is meant by "good will,"\r\nas taught by this lesson. How did Tom and James differ in character?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLVIII. A CHINESE STORY. (156)\r\n\r\nBy Christopher Pearse Cranch, who was born at Alexandria, Va. (then D.\r\nC.), in 1813. He has written some well-known children\'s stories, besides\r\nnumerous poems; but his greatest literary work is "The AEneid of Vergil,\r\ntranslated into English blank verse." He died in Cambridge Mass., 1892.\r\n\r\n1. Two young, near-sighted fellows, Chang and Ching,\r\n   Over their chopsticks idly chattering,\r\n   Fell to disputing which could see the best;\r\n   At last, they agreed to put it to the test.\r\n   Said Chang, "A marble tablet, so I hear,\r\n   Is placed upon the Bo-hee temple near,\r\n   With an inscription on it. Let us go\r\n   And read it (since you boast your optics so),\r\n   Standing together at a certain place\r\n   In front, where we the letters just may trace;\r\n   Then he who quickest reads the inscription there,\r\n   The palm for keenest eyes henceforth shall bear."\r\n   "Agreed," said Ching, "but let us try it soon:\r\n   Suppose we say to-morrow afternoon."\r\n\r\n2. "Nay, not so soon," said Chang; "I\'m bound to go\r\n   To-morrow a day\'s ride from Hoang-Ho,\r\n   And sha\'n\'t be ready till the following day:\r\n   At ten A. M., on Thursday, let us say."\r\n\r\n3. So \'twas arranged; but Ching was wide-awake:\r\n   Time by the forelock he resolved to take;\r\n   And to the temple went at once, and read,\r\n   Upon the tablet, "To the illustrious dead,\r\n   The chief of mandarins, the great Goh-Bang."\r\n   Scarce had he gone when stealthily came Chang,\r\n   Who read the same; but peering closer, he\r\n   Spied in a corner what Ching failed to see--\r\n   The words, "This tablet is erected here\r\n   By those to whom the great Goh-Bang was dear."\r\n\r\n4. So on the appointed day--both innocent\r\n   As babes, of course--these honest fellows went,\r\n   And took their distant station; and Ching said,\r\n   "I can read plainly, \'To the illustrious dead,\r\n   The chief of mandarins, the great Goh-Bang.\'"\r\n   "And is that all that you can spell?" said Chang;\r\n   "I see what you have read, but furthermore,\r\n   In smaller letters, toward the temple door,\r\n   Quite plain, \'This tablet is erected here\r\n   By those to whom the great Goh-Bang was dear.\'"\r\n\r\n5. "My sharp-eyed friend, there are no such words!" said Ching.\r\n   "They\'re there," said Chang, "if I see anything,\r\n   As clear as daylight." "Patent eyes, indeed,\r\n   You have!" cried Ching; "do you think I can not read?"\r\n   "Not at this distance as I can," Chang said,\r\n   "If what you say you saw is all you read."\r\n\r\n6. In fine, they quarreled, and their wrath increased,\r\n   Till Chang said, "Let us leave it to the priest;\r\n   Lo! here he comes to meet us," "It is well,"\r\n   Said honest Ching; "no falsehood he will tell."\r\n\r\n7. The good man heard their artless story through,\r\n   And said, "I think, dear sirs, there must be few\r\n   Blest with such wondrous eyes as those you wear:\r\n   There\'s no such tablet or inscription there!\r\n   There was one, it is true; \'t was moved away\r\n   And placed within the temple yesterday."\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Near-sight\'ed, seeing at a short distance only.\r\nChop\'sticks, small sticks of wood, ivory, etc., used in pairs by Chinese\r\nto carry food to the mouth. Tab\'let, a small, flat piece of anything on\r\nwhich to write or engrave.  In-scrip\'tion, something written or engraved\r\non a solid substance. Op\'tics, eyes. Palm, the reward of victory, prize.\r\n2. A. M., an abbreviation for the Latin ante meridian, meaning before\r\nnoon. 3. Man-da-rin\', a Chinese public officer. 5. Pat\'ent, secured from\r\ngeneral use, peculiar to one person.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXX. THE WAY TO BE HAPPY. (159)\r\n\r\n1. Every child must observe how much more happy and beloved some children\r\nare than others. There are some children you always love to be with. They\r\nare happy themselves, and they make you happy.\r\n\r\n2. There are others whom you always avoid. They seem to have no friends.\r\nNo person can be happy without friends. The heart is formed for love, and\r\ncan not be happy without it.\r\n\r\n        3. "\'Tis not in titles nor in rank,\r\n           \'Tis not in wealth like London bank,\r\n             To make us truly blest.\r\n           If happiness have not her seat\r\n             And center in the breast,\r\n           We may be wise, or rich, or great,\r\n             But never can be blest."\r\n\r\n4. But you can not receive affection unless you will also give it. You can\r\nnot find others to love you unless you will also love them. Love is only\r\nto be obtained by giving love in return. Hence the importance of\r\ncultivating a good disposition. You can not be happy without it.\r\n\r\n5. I have sometimes heard a girl say, "I know that I am very unpopular at\r\nschool." Now, this plainly shows that she is not amiable.\r\n\r\n6. If your companions do not love you, it is your own fault. They can not\r\nhelp loving you if you will be kind and friendly. If you are not loved, it\r\nis a good proof that you do not deserve to be loved. It is true that a\r\nsense of duty may, at times, render it necessary for you to do that which\r\nwill displease your companions.\r\n\r\n7. But if it is seen that you have a noble spirit, that you are above\r\nselfishness, that you are willing to make sacrifices to promote the\r\nhappiness of others, you will never be in want of friends.\r\n\r\n8. You must not regard it as your misfortune that others do not love you,\r\nbut your fault. It is not beauty, it is not wealth, that will give you\r\nfriends. Your heart must glow with kindness, if you would attract to\r\nyourself the esteem and affection of those around you.\r\n\r\n9. You are little aware how much the happiness of your whole life depends\r\nupon the cultivation of a good disposition. If you will adopt the\r\nresolution that you will confer favors whenever you can, you will\r\ncertainly be surrounded by ardent friends. Begin upon this principle in\r\nchildhood, and act upon it through life, and you will make yourself happy,\r\nand promote the happiness of all within your influence.\r\n\r\n10. You go to school on a cold winter morning. A bright fire is blazing in\r\nthe stove, surrounded with boys struggling to get near it to warm\r\nthemselves. After you are slightly warmed, a schoolmate comes in suffering\r\nwith cold. "Here, James," you pleasantly call out to him, "I am almost\r\nwarm; you may have my place."\r\n\r\n11. As you slip aside to allow him to take your place at the fire, will he\r\nnot feel that you are kind? The worst boy in the world can not help\r\nadmiring such generosity; and, even though he be so ungrateful as not to\r\nreturn the favor, you may depend upon it that he will be your friend as\r\nfar as he is capable of friendship. If you will always act upon this\r\nprinciple, you will never want for friends.\r\n\r\n12. Suppose, some day, you are out with your companions playing ball.\r\nAfter you have been playing for some time, another boy comes along. He can\r\nnot be chosen upon either side, for there is no one to match him. "Henry,"\r\nyou say, "you may take my place a little while, and I will rest."\r\n\r\n13. You throw yourself down upon the grass, while Henry, fresh and\r\nvigorous, takes your bat and engages in the game. He knows that you give\r\nup to oblige him, and how can he help liking you for it? The fact is, that\r\nneither man nor child can cultivate such a spirit of generosity and\r\nkindness without attracting affection and esteem.\r\n\r\n14. Look and see which of your companions have the most friends, and you\r\nwill find that they are those who have this noble spirit; who are willing\r\nto deny themselves, that they may make others happy. There is but one way\r\nto make friends; and that is, by being friendly to others.\r\n\r\n15. Perhaps some child who reads this feels conscious of being disliked,\r\nand yet desires to have the affection of his companions. You ask me what\r\nyou shall do. I will tell you. I will give you an infallible rule: Do all\r\nin your power to make others happy. Be willing to make sacrifices, that\r\nyou may promote the happiness of others.\r\n\r\n16. This is the way to make friends, and the only way. When you are\r\nplaying with your brothers and sisters at home, be always ready to give\r\nthem more than their share of privileges. Manifest an obliging\r\ndisposition, and they can not but regard you with affection. In all your\r\nintercourse with others, at home or abroad, let these feelings influence\r\nyou, and you will receive a rich reward.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--4. Cul\'ti-vat-ing, cherishing,  encouraging. 5.\r\nUn-pop\'u-lar, not pleasing others. 6. Com-pan\'ions, those who keep company\r\nwith anyone. 7. Sac\'ri-fic-es, things given up to oblige others.\r\nPro-mote\', advance, forward. 10. Suf\'fer-ing, undergoing pain. 11.\r\nGen-er-os\'i-ty, kindness, nobleness of soul. 15. In-fal\'li-ble, certain,\r\nthat can not fail. 16. Man\'i-fest, to show plainly. In\'ter-course,\r\ncommunication, mutual dealings.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISES.--What is this lesson about? Can we be happy without friends?\r\nHow can we win the love of those about us? Whose fault is it if we are not\r\nloved? What rule will surely gain us love and friendship if we always\r\nfollow it?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLX. THE GIRAFFE, OR CAMELOPARD. (162)\r\n\r\n1. The giraffe is a native of Africa. It is of singular shape and size,\r\nand bears some resemblance both to the camel and the deer. The mouth is\r\nsmall; the eyes are full and brilliant; the tongue is rough, very long,\r\nand ending in a point. The neck is long and slender, and, from the\r\nshoulder to the top of the head, it measures between seven and eight feet;\r\nfrom the ground to the top of the shoulder, it is commonly ten or eleven\r\nfeet; so that the height of a full-grown giraffe is seventeen or eighteen\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\n2. The hair is of a deep brown color in the male, and of a light or\r\nyellowish brown in the female. The skin is beautifully diversified with\r\nwhite spots. They have short, blunt horns, and hoofs like those of the ox.\r\nIn their wild state, they feed on the leaves of a gum-bearing tree\r\npeculiar to warm climates.\r\n\r\n3. The giraffe, like the horse and other hoofed animals, defends itself by\r\nkicking; and its hinder limbs are so light, and its blows so rapid, that\r\nthe eye can not follow them. They are sufficient for its defense against\r\nthe lion. It never employs its horns in resisting the attack of an enemy.\r\nIts disposition is gentle, and it flees to its native forest upon the\r\nleast alarm.\r\n\r\n4. Le Vaillant (the celebrated French traveler and naturalist) was the\r\nfirst who gave us any exact account of the form and habits of the giraffe.\r\nWhile he was traveling in South Africa, he happened one day to discover a\r\nhut covered with the skin of one of those animals; and learned to his\r\nsurprise that he was now in a part of the country where the creature was\r\nfound. He could not rest contented until he had seen the animal alive, and\r\nhad secured a specimen.\r\n\r\n5. Having on several days obtained sight of some of them, he, with his\r\nattendants, on horseback and accompanied with dogs, gave chase; but they\r\nbaffled all pursuit. After a chase of a whole day, which effected nothing\r\nbut the fatigue of the party, he began to despair of success.\r\n\r\n6. "The next day," says he, "by sunrise, I was in pursuit of game, in the\r\nhope of obtaining some provisions for my men. After several hours\'\r\nfatigue, we saw, at the turn of a hill, seven giraffes, which my pack of\r\ndogs instantly pursued. Six of them went off together; but the seventh,\r\ncut off by my dogs, took another way.\r\n\r\n7. "I followed the single one at full speed, but, in spite of the efforts\r\nof my horse, she got so much ahead of me, that, in turning a little hill,\r\nI lost sight of her altogether, and I gave up the pursuit. My dogs,\r\nhowever, were not so easily exhausted. They were soon so close upon her\r\nthat she was obliged to stop and defend herself. From the noise they made,\r\nI conjectured that they had got the animal into a corner, and I again\r\npushed forward.\r\n\r\n8. "I had scarcely got round the hill, when I perceived her surrounded by\r\nthe dogs, and endeavoring to drive them away by heavy kicks. In a moment I\r\nwas on my feet, and a shot from my carbine brought her to the earth. I was\r\ndelighted with my victory, which enabled me to add to the riches of\r\nnatural history. I was now able, also, to destroy the romance which\r\nattached to this animal, and to establish the truth of its existence."\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--l. Bril\'liant, sparkling, shining. 2. Di-ver\'si-fied, made\r\nvarious. Pe-cul\'iar, especially belonging to. 4. Le Vaillant (pro. leh va\r\nyon\'). Nat\'u-ral-ist, one who is acquainted with objects of nature.\r\nSpec\'i-men, a sample. 5. Baf \'fled, defeated, escaped from. Fa-tigue\',\r\nweariness. 7. Con-jec\'tured, guessed. 8. Car\'bine, a short gun. Ro-mance\',\r\na story without truth.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISES.--Of what country is the giraffe a native? To what height does\r\nit attain when full grown? On what does it live? How does it defend\r\nitself? Relate the story of Le Vaillant\'s giraffe hunt.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXI. THE LOST CHILD. (165)\r\n\r\n1. A few years since, a child was lost in the woods. He was out with his\r\nbrothers and sisters gathering berries, and was accidentally separated\r\nfrom them, and lost. The children, after looking in vain for some time in\r\nsearch of the little wanderer, returned, just in the dusk of the evening,\r\nto inform their parents that their brother was lost and could not be\r\nfound.\r\n\r\n2. The woods, at that time, were full of bears. The darkness of a cloudy\r\nnight was rapidly coming on, and the alarmed father, gathering a few of\r\nhis neighbors, hastened in search of the lost child. The mother remained\r\nat home, almost distracted with suspense.\r\n\r\n3. As the clouds gathered, and the darkness increased, the father and the\r\nneighbors, with highly excited fears, traversed the woods in all\r\ndirections, and raised loud shouts to attract the attention of the child.\r\nBut their search was in vain. They could find no trace of the wanderer;\r\nand, as they stood under the boughs of the lofty trees, and listened, that\r\nif possible they might hear his feeble voice, no sound was borne to their\r\nears but the melancholy moaning of the wind as it swept through the thick\r\nbranches of the forest.\r\n\r\n4. The gathering clouds threatened an approaching storm, and the deep\r\ndarkness of the night had already enveloped them. It is difficult to\r\nconceive what were the feelings of that father. And who could imagine how\r\ndeep the distress which filled the bosom of that mother, as she heard the\r\nwind, and beheld the darkness in which her child was wandering!\r\n\r\n5. The search was continued in vain till nine o\'clock in the evening.\r\nThen, one of the party was sent back to the village, to collect the\r\ninhabitants for a more extensive search. The bell rung the alarm, and the\r\ncry of fire resounded through the streets. It was ascertained, however,\r\nthat it was not fire which caused the alarm, but that the bell tolled the\r\nmore solemn tidings of a lost child.\r\n\r\n6. Every heart sympathized in the sorrows of the distracted parents. Soon,\r\nmultitudes of the people were seen ascending the hill, upon the declivity\r\nof which the village stood, to aid in the search. Ere long, the rain began\r\nto fall, but no tidings came back to the village of the lost child. Hardly\r\nan eye was that night closed in sleep, and there was not a mother who did\r\nnot feel for the parents.\r\n\r\n7. The night passed away, and the morning dawned, and yet no tidings came.\r\nAt last, those engaged in the search met together and held a consultation.\r\nThey made arrangements for a more minute search, and agreed that, in case\r\nthe child was found, a gun should be fired, to give a signal to the rest\r\nof the party.\r\n\r\n8. As the sun arose, the clouds were scattered, and the whole landscape\r\nglittered in the rays of the bright morning. But that village was deserted\r\nand still. The stores were closed, and business was hushed. Mothers were\r\nwalking the streets, with sympathizing countenances and anxious hearts.\r\nThere was but one thought in every mind: "What has become of the lost\r\nchild?"\r\n\r\n9. All the affections and interest of the neighborhood were flowing in one\r\ndeep and broad channel toward the little wanderer. About nine in the\r\nmorning, the signal gun was fired, which announced that the child was\r\nfound; and, for a moment, how dreadful was the suspense! Was it found a\r\nmangled corpse? or was it alive and well?\r\n\r\n10. Soon, a joyful shout proclaimed the safety of the child. The shout was\r\nborne from tongue to tongue, till the whole forest rang again with the\r\njoyful sound. A messenger rapidly bore the tidings to the distracted\r\nmother. A procession was immediately formed by those engaged in the\r\nsearch. The child was placed upon a platform, hastily formed from the\r\nboughs of trees, and borne in triumph at the head of the procession. When\r\nthey arrived at the brow of the hill, they rested for a moment, and\r\nproclaimed their success with three loud and animated cheers.\r\n\r\n11. The procession then moved on till they arrived in front of the\r\ndwelling where the parents of the child resided. The mother, who stood at\r\nthe door, with streaming eyes and throbbing heart, could no longer\r\nrestrain herself or her feelings.\r\n\r\n12. She rushed into the street, clasped her child to her bosom, and wept\r\naloud. Every eye was filled with tears, and, for a moment, all were\r\nsilent. But suddenly some one gave a signal for a shout. One loud, and\r\nlong, and happy note of joy rose from the assembled multitude, and they\r\nwent to their business and their homes.\r\n\r\n13. There was more joy over the one child that was found than over the\r\nninety and nine that went not astray. Likewise, there is joy in the\r\npresence of the angels of God over one sinner that repenteth. But still,\r\nthis is a feeble representation of the love of our Father in heaven for\r\nus, and of the joy with which the angels welcome the returning wanderer.\r\n\r\n14. The mother can not feel for her child that is lost as God feels for\r\nthe unhappy wanderer in the paths of sin. If a mother can feel so much,\r\nwhat must be the feelings of our Father in heaven for those who have\r\nstrayed from his love? If man can feel so deep a sympathy, what must be\r\nthe emotions which glow in the bosom of angels?\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--l. Sep\'a-rat-ed, parted. 2. Dis-tract\'ed, made crazy.\r\nSus-pense\', doubt, uncertainty. 3. Trav\'ersed, passed over and examined.\r\n5. As-cer-tained\', made certain. 6. Sym\'pa-thized, felt for.\r\nDe-cliv\'i-ty, descent of land. 7. Con-sul-ta\'tion, a meeting of persons to\r\nadvise together. 8. Land\'scape, a portion of territory which the eye can\r\nsee in a single view. 10.

(168)\r\nBy MRS. E. L. BEERS.\r\n\r\n1. Which shall it be? Which shall it be?\r\n   I looked at John--John looked at me;\r\n   Dear, patient John, who loves me yet\r\n   As well as though my locks were jet.\r\n   And when I found that I must speak,\r\n   My voice seemed strangely low and weak:\r\n   "Tell me again what Robert said!"\r\n   And then I, listening, bent my head.\r\n   "This is his letter:"\r\n\r\n2.                         "\'I will give\r\n   A house and land while you shall live,\r\n   If, in return, from out your seven,\r\n   One child to me for aye is given.\'"\r\n   I looked at John\'s old garments worn,\r\n   I thought of all that John had borne\r\n   Of poverty, and work, and care,\r\n   Which I, though willing, could not share;\r\n   I thought of seven mouths to feed,\r\n   Of seven little children\'s need,\r\n   And then of this.\r\n\r\n3.                 "Come, John," said I,\r\n   "We\'ll choose among them as they lie\r\n   Asleep;" so, walking hand in hand,\r\n   Dear John and I surveyed our band.\r\n   First to the cradle light we stepped,\r\n   Where Lilian the baby slept,\r\n   A glory \'gainst the pillow white.\r\n   Softly the father stooped to lay\r\n   His rough hand down in loving way,\r\n   When dream or whisper made her stir,\r\n   And huskily he said: "Not her!"\r\n\r\n4. We stooped beside the trundle-bed,\r\n   And one long ray of lamplight shed\r\n   Athwart the boyish faces there,\r\n   In sleep so pitiful and fair;\r\n   I saw on Jamie\'s rough, red cheek,\r\n   A tear undried. Ere John could speak,\r\n   "He\'s but a baby, too," said I,\r\n   And kissed him as we hurried by.\r\n\r\n5. Pale, patient Robbie\'s angel face\r\n   Still in his sleep bore suffering\'s trace:\r\n   "No, for a thousand crowns, not him,"\r\n   He whispered, while our eyes were dim.\r\n\r\n6. Poor Dick! bad Dick! our wayward son,\r\n   Turbulent, reckless, idle one--\r\n   Could he be spared? "Nay, He who gave,\r\n   Bade us befriend him to the grave;\r\n   Only a mother\'s heart can be\r\n   Patient enough for such as he;\r\n   And so," said John, "I would not dare\r\n   To send him from her bedside prayer."\r\n\r\n7. Then stole we softly up above\r\n   And knelt by Mary, child of love.\r\n   "Perhaps for her \'t would better be,"\r\n   I said to John. Quite silently\r\n   He lifted up a curl that lay\r\n   Across her cheek in willful way,\r\n   And shook his head. "Nay, love, not thee,"\r\n   The while my heart beat audibly.\r\n\r\n8. Only one more, our eldest lad,\r\n   Trusty and truthful, good and glad\r\n   So like his father. "No, John, no--\r\n   I can not, will not let him go."\r\n\r\n9. And so we wrote in courteous way,\r\n   We could not drive one child away.\r\n   And afterward, toil lighter seemed,\r\n   Thinking of that of which we dreamed;\r\n   Happy, in truth, that not one face\r\n   We missed from its accustomed place;\r\n   Thankful to work for all the seven,\r\n   Trusting the rest to One in heaven!\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--2. Aye, always, 3. Sur-veyed\', took a view of. 5. Crown, an\r\nEnglish silver coin worth about $1.20. 6. Way-ward, willful. Tur\'bu-lent,\r\ndisposed to disorder. 9. Cour\'te-ous, polite. Ac-cus\'tomed, usual.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXIII. THE PET FAWN. (172)\r\n\r\n1. A pretty little fawn had been brought in from the woods, when very\r\nyoung, and nursed and petted by a lady in the village until it had become\r\nas tame as possible. It was graceful, as those little creatures always\r\nare, and so gentle and playful that it became a great favorite, following\r\nthe different members of the family about, being caressed by the\r\nneighbors, and welcome everywhere.\r\n\r\n2. One morning, after playing about as usual until weary, it lay down in\r\nthe sunshine, at the feet of one of its friends, upon the steps of a\r\nstore. There came along a countryman, who for several years had been a\r\nhunter by pursuit, and who still kept several hounds, one of which was now\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\n3. The dog, as it approached the spot where the fawn lay, suddenly\r\nstopped. The little animal saw him, and started to its feet. It had lived\r\nmore than half its life among the dogs of the village, and had apparently\r\nlost all fear of them; but it seemed now to know that an enemy was near.\r\nIn an instant, its whole nature seemed changed; all its past habits were\r\nforgotten; every wild impulse was awake; its head erect, its nostrils\r\ndilated, its eyes flashing.\r\n\r\n4. In another instant, before the spectators had thought of the danger,\r\nand before its friends could secure it, the fawn was bounding away through\r\nthe street, and the hound in full chase. The bystanders were eager to save\r\nit; several persons immediately followed its track; the friends who had\r\nlong fed and fondled it, calling the name it had hitherto known, in vain.\r\n\r\n5. The hunter endeavored to whistle back his dog, but with no success. In\r\nhalf a minute the fawn had turned the first corner, dashed onward toward\r\nthe lake, and thrown itself into the water. But if for a moment the\r\nstartled creature believed itself safe in the cool bosom of the lake, it\r\nwas soon undeceived; for the hound followed in hot and eager chase, while\r\na dozen village dogs joined blindly in the pursuit.\r\n\r\n6. A large crowd collected on the bank--men, women, and children--anxious\r\nfor the fate of the little animal so well known to them all. Some threw\r\nthemselves into boats, hoping to intercept the hound before he reached his\r\nprey. The plashing of the oars, the eager voices of men and boys, and the\r\nbarking of the dogs, must have filled the heart of the poor fawn with\r\nterror and anguish,--as though every creature on the spot where it had\r\nonce been caressed and fondled, had suddenly turned into a deadly foe.\r\n\r\n7. It was soon seen that the little animal was directing its course across\r\na bay toward the nearest borders of the forest. Immediately the owner of\r\nthe hound crossed the bridge, and ran at full speed, hoping to stop his\r\ndog as he landed. On swam the fawn, as it never swam before; its delicate\r\nhead scarcely seen above the water, but leaving a disturbed track, which\r\nbetrayed its course alike to its friends and foes.\r\n\r\n8. As it approached the land, the interest became intense. The hunter was\r\nalready on the same side of the lake, calling loudly and angrily to his\r\ndog; but the hound seemed to have quite forgotten his master\'s voice in\r\nthe pitiless pursuit. The fawn reached the shore. With a leap it had\r\ncrossed the narrow strip of beach, and in another instant it would reach\r\nthe cover of the woods.\r\n\r\n9. The hound followed true to the scent, pointing to the same spot on the\r\nshore; his master, anxious to meet him, had run at full speed, and was now\r\ncoming up at the same critical moment. Will the dog listen to his voice?\r\nor can the hunter reach him in time to seize and control him? A shout from\r\nthe bank told that the fawn had passed out of sight into the forest. At\r\nthe same instant, the hound, as he touched the land, felt the hunter\'s\r\nstrong arm clutching his neck. The worst was believed to be over; the fawn\r\nwas leaping up the mountain side, and its enemy was restrained. The other\r\ndogs, seeing their leader cowed, were easily managed.\r\n\r\n10. A number of persons, men and boys, dispersed themselves through the\r\nwoods in search of the little creature, but without success; they all\r\nreturned to the village, reporting that the fawn had not been seen. Some\r\nthought that after its fright had passed it would return of its own\r\naccord. It wore a pretty collar with its owner\'s name engraved upon it, so\r\nthat it could be easily known from any other fawn that might be straying\r\nabout the woods.\r\n\r\n11. Before many hours had passed, a hunter presented himself to the lady\r\nwhose pet the little creature had been, and showed a collar with her name\r\nupon it. He said that he was out hunting in the morning, and saw a fawn in\r\nthe distance. The little pet, instead of bounding away, as he expected,\r\nmoved toward him; he took aim, fired, and shot it through the heart.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--l. Fawn, a young deer. Ca-ressed\', fondled, petted. 3.\r\nDi-lat\'ed, extended, spread out. 4. Spec-ta\'tors, those who look on. 6.\r\nIn-ter-cept\', to stop, to seize. 7. Be-trayed\', showed. 8. In-tense\',\r\nextreme. 9. Scent, track followed by the sense of smell. Cowed, made\r\nafraid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXIV.  ANNIE\'S DREAM. (175)\r\n\r\n1. It was a clear, cold, winter evening, and all the Sinclairs but Annie\r\nhad gone out for a neighborly visit. She had resolved to stay at home and\r\nstudy a long, difficult lesson in Natural Philosophy.\r\n\r\n2. Left to herself, the evening passed quickly, but the lesson was learned\r\na full half hour before the time set for the family to come home.\r\n\r\n3. Closing her book, she leaned back in the soft armchair in which she was\r\nsitting, soon fell asleep, and began to dream. She dreamed that it was a\r\nvery cold morning, and that she was standing by the dining-room stove,\r\nlooking into the glass basin which was every day filled with water for\r\nevaporation.\r\n\r\n4. "Oh, dear," she sighed, "it is nearly school time. I don\'t want to go\r\nout in the cold this morning. Then there is that long lesson. I wonder if\r\nI can say it. Let me see--it takes two hundred and twelve degrees of heat,\r\nI believe, for water to evaporate--"\r\n\r\n5. "Nonsense!" "Ridiculous!" shouted a chorus of strange little voices\r\nnear by; "Look here! is this water boiling? What an idea; two hundred and\r\ntwelve degrees before we can fly, ha, ha!"\r\n\r\n6. "Who are you?" asked Annie, in amazement. "Where must I look?" "In the\r\nbasin, of course." 7. Annie looked, and saw a multitude of tiny forms\r\nmoving swiftly around, their numbers increasing as the heat of the fire\r\nincreased. "Why you dear little things!" said she, "what are you doing\r\ndown there?"\r\n\r\n8. "We are water sprites," answered one, in the clearest voice that can be\r\nimagined, "and when this delightful warmth comes all about us, we become\r\nso light that we fly off, as you see."\r\n\r\n9. In another moment he had joined a crowd of his companions that were\r\nspreading their wings and flying off in curling, white clouds over Annie\'s\r\nhead. But they were so light and thin that they soon disappeared in the\r\nair.\r\n\r\n10. She could not see where they went, so she again turned to the basin.\r\n"Does n\'t it hurt you," she asked one, "to be heated--?" "Not always to\r\ntwo hundred and twelve," said the sprite, mischievously.\r\n\r\n11. "No, no," replied Annie, half-vexed; "I remember, that is boiling\r\npoint--but I mean, to be heated as you all are, and then to fly off in the\r\ncold?"\r\n\r\n12. "Oh, no," laughed the little sprite; "we like it. We are made to\r\nchange by God\'s wise laws, and so it can\'t hurt us. We are all the time at\r\nwork, in our way, taking different shapes. It is good for us. If you will\r\ngo to the window, you will find some of my brothers and sisters on the\r\nglass."\r\n\r\n13. Annie went to the window, and at first could see nothing but some\r\nbeautiful frostwork on it. Soon, however, the panes seemed to swarm with\r\nlittle folks. Their wings were as white as snow, and sparkled with ice\r\njewels.\r\n\r\n14. "Oh," cried Annie, "this is the prettiest sight I ever saw. What is\r\nyour name, darling?" she asked one that wore a crown of snow roses. The\r\nlittle voice that replied was so sharp and fine that Annie thought it\r\nseemed like a needle point of sound, and she began to laugh.\r\n\r\n15. "Fine Frost is our family name," it said. "I have a first name of my\r\nown, but I shall not tell you what it is, for you are so impolite as to\r\nlaugh at me."\r\n\r\n16. "I beg your pardon, dear," said Annie; "I could not help it. I will\r\nnot laugh at you any more if you will tell me how you came here. I have\r\nbeen talking with one of your brothers over there in the basin."\r\n\r\n17. The little sprite then folded her wings in a dignified manner, and\r\nsaid, "I will tell you all I know about it, since you promise to be\r\npolite. It is a very short story, however.\r\n\r\n18. "Last evening we all escaped from the glass basin, as you have seen\r\nour companions do this morning. Oh, how light and free we felt! But we\r\nwere so very delicate and thin that no one saw us as we flew about in the\r\nair of the room.\r\n\r\n19. "After a while I flew with these others to this window, and, as we\r\nalighted on the glass, the cold changed us from water sprites into sprites\r\nof the Fine Frost family." "It is very wonderful," said Annie. "Is it nice\r\nto be a sprite?"\r\n\r\n20. "Oh, yes, we are very gay. All last night we had a fine time sparkling\r\nin the moonlight. I wore a long wreath full of ice pearls and diamonds.\r\nHere is a piece of it. Before long we shall be water sprites again. I see\r\nthe sun is coming this way."\r\n\r\n21. "Shall you dread to be melted?" inquired Annie. "No, indeed," answered\r\nthe sprite. "I like to change my form now and then."\r\n\r\n22. A thought flashed across Annie\'s brain. What if she should breathe on\r\nthe frost and not wait for the sun to melt it. In a moment more she had\r\ndone so. Down fell a great number of the tiny mountains and castles,\r\ncarrying with them a multitude of frost sprites, and all that could be\r\nseen was a drop of water on the window sill.\r\n\r\n23. "Oh, dear! have I hurt them?" she exclaimed. "No, no," replied a\r\nchorus of many small voices from the drop of water, "we are only water\r\nsprites again. Nothing hurts us; we merely change." "But you are always\r\npretty little things," said Annie. "I wish--"\r\n\r\n24. Here a ring at the doorbell woke Annie. She started up to find the\r\nfamily had returned from their visit, which all declared was a delightful\r\none. But Annie said she did not believe they had enjoyed their visit\r\nbetter than she had her half hour\'s dream.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1. Nat\'u-ral Phi-los\'o-phy, the study which teaches about\r\nthe laws of matter in nature. 3. E-vap-o-ra\'tion, the act of turning into\r\nvapor. 4. De-gree\', a division of space marked on an instrument such as a\r\nthermometer. 8. Wa\'ter sprite, a spirit or fairy living in the water. 10.\r\nMis\'chie-vous-ly, in a teasing manner. 13. Swarm, to be crowded. 18,\r\nEs-caped\', got away, fled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXV. MY GHOST. (178)\r\n\r\nBy Mrs. S. M. B. Piatt, who was born near Lexington, Ky., in 1836. Among\r\nher published works may be mentioned "The Nests at Washington, and Other\r\nPoems," and "A Woman\'s Poems."\r\n\r\n1. Yes, Katie, I think you are very sweet,\r\n     Now that the tangles are out of your hair,\r\n   And you sing as well as the birds you meet,\r\n     That are playing, like you, in the blossoms there.\r\n   But now you are coming to kiss me, you say:\r\n     Well, what is it for? Shall I tie your shoe?\r\n   Or loop up your sleeve in a prettier way?\r\n     "Do I know about ghosts?" Indeed I do.\r\n\r\n2. "Have I seen one?" Yes; last evening, you know,\r\n     We were taking a walk that you had to miss,\r\n   (I think you were naughty, and cried to go,\r\n     But, surely, you\'ll stay at home after this!)\r\n   And, away in the twilight, lonesomely,\r\n     ("What is the twilight?" It\'s--getting late!)\r\n   I was thinking of things that were sad to me!--\r\n     There, hush! you know nothing about them, Kate.\r\n\r\n3. Well, we had to go through the rocky lane,\r\n     Close to that bridge where the water roars,\r\n   By a still, red house, where the dark and rain\r\n     Go in when they will at the open doors.\r\n   And the moon, that had just waked up, looked through\r\n     The broken old windows, and seemed afraid,\r\n   And the wild bats flew, and the thistles grew\r\n     Where once in the roses the children played.\r\n\r\n4. Just across the road by the cherry trees\r\n     Some fallen white stones had been lying so long,\r\n   Half hid in the grass, and under these\r\n     There were people dead. I could hear the song\r\n   Of a very sleepy dove as I passed\r\n     The graveyard near, and the cricket that cried;\r\n   And I look\'d (ah! the Ghost is coming at last!)\r\n     And something was walking at my side.\r\n\r\n5. It seemed to be wrapped in a great dark shawl\r\n     (For the night was a little cold, you know,);\r\n   It would not speak. It was black and tall;\r\n     And it walked so proudly and very slow.\r\n   Then it mocked me everything I could do:\r\n     Now it caught at the lightning flies like me;\r\n   Now it stopped where the elder blossoms grew;\r\n     Now it tore the thorns from a gray bent tree.\r\n\r\n6. Still it followed me under the yellow moon,\r\n     Looking back to the graveyard now and then,\r\n   Where the winds were playing the night a tune--\r\n     But, Kate, a Ghost doesn\'t care for men,\r\n   And your papa could n\'t have done it harm.\r\n     Ah! dark-eyed darling, what is it you see?\r\n   There, you needn\'t hide in your dimpled arm--\r\n     It was only my shadow that walk\'d with me!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXVI. THE ELEPHANT. (180)\r\n\r\n1. The elephant is the largest of quadrupeds; his height is from eight to\r\nfourteen feet, and his length, from ten to fifteen feet. His form is that\r\nof a hog; his eyes are small and lively; his ears are long, broad and\r\npendulous. He has two large tusks, which form the ivory of commerce, and a\r\ntrunk, or proboscis, at the end of the nose, which he uses to take his\r\nfood with, and for attack or defense. His color is a dark ash-brown.\r\n\r\n2. Elephants often assemble in large troops; and, as they march in search\r\nof food, the forests seem to tremble under them. They eat the branches of\r\ntrees, together with roots, herbs, leaves, grain, and fruit, but will not\r\ntouch fish nor flesh. In a state of nature, they are peaceable, mild, and\r\nbrave; exerting their power only for their own protection or in defense of\r\ntheir own species.\r\n\r\n3. Elephants are found both in Asia and Africa, but they are of different\r\nspecies, the Asiatic elephant having five toes, and the African, three.\r\nThese animals are caught by stratagem, and, when tamed, they are the most\r\ngentle, obedient, and patient, as well as the most docile and sagacious of\r\nall quadrupeds. They are used to carry burdens, and for traveling. Their\r\nattachment to their masters is remarkable; and they seem to live but to\r\nserve and obey them. They always kneel to receive their riders; or the\r\nloads they have to carry.\r\n\r\n4. The anecdotes illustrating the character of the elephant are numerous.\r\nAn elephant which was kept for exhibition at London, was often required,\r\nas is usual in such exhibitions, to pick up with his trunk a piece of\r\nmoney thrown upon the floor for this purpose. On one occasion a sixpence\r\nwas thrown, which happened to roll a little out of his reach, not far from\r\nthe wall. Being desired to pick it up, he stretched out his proboscis\r\nseveral times to reach it; failing in this, he stood motionless a few\r\nseconds, evidently considering how to act.\r\n\r\n5. He then stretched his proboscis in a straight line as far as he could,\r\na little distance above the coin, and blew with great force against the\r\nwall. The angle produced by the opposition of the wall, made the current\r\nof air act under the coin, as he evidently supposed it would, and it was\r\ncurious to observe the sixpence traveling toward the animal till it came\r\nwithin his reach, when he picked it up.\r\n\r\n6. A soldier in India, who had frequently carried an elephant some arrack,\r\nbeing one day intoxicated, and seeing himself pursued by the guard whose\r\norders were to conduct him to prison, took refuge under the elephant. The\r\nguard soon finding his retreat, attempted in vain to take him from his\r\nasylum; for the elephant vigorously defended him with his trunk.\r\n\r\n7. As soon as the soldier became sober, and saw himself placed under such\r\nan unwieldy animal, he was so terrified that he scarcely durst move either\r\nhand or foot; but the elephant soon caused his fears to subside by\r\ncaressing him with his trunk, and thus tacitly saying, "Depart in peace."\r\n\r\n8. A pleasing anecdote is related of an elephant which was the property of\r\nthe nabob of Lucknow. There was in that city an epidemic disorder, making\r\ndreadful havoc among the inhabitants. The road to the palace gate was\r\ncovered with the sick and dying, lying on the ground at the moment the\r\nnabob was about to pass.\r\n\r\n9. Regardless of the suffering he must cause, the nabob held on his way,\r\nnot caring whether his beast trod upon the poor helpless creatures or not.\r\nBut the animal, more kind-hearted than his master, carefully cleared the\r\npath of the poor, helpless wretches as he went along. Some he lifted with\r\nhis trunk, entirely out of the road. Some he set upon their feet, and\r\namong the others he stepped so carefully that not an individual was\r\ninjured.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--l. Quad\'ru-ped, an animal having four feet.

(183)\r\n\r\nAdapted from "School Days at Rugby," by Thomas Hughes, an English writer\r\nwell known through this book, and its sequel, "Tom Brown at Oxford." The\r\nauthor was born in 1823, and died in 1896.\r\n\r\n1. The little schoolboys went quietly to their own beds, and began\r\nundressing and talking to one another in whispers: while the elder,\r\namongst whom was Tom, sat chatting about on one another\'s beds, with their\r\njackets and waistcoats off.\r\n\r\n2. Poor little Arthur was overwhelmed with the novelty of his position.\r\nThe idea of sleeping in the room with strange boys had clearly never\r\ncrossed his mind before, and was as painful as it was strange to him. He\r\ncould hardly bear to take his jacket off; however, presently, with an\r\neffort, off it came, and then he paused and looked at Tom, who was sitting\r\nat the bottom of his bed, talking and laughing.\r\n\r\n3. "Please, Brown," he whispered, "may I wash my face and hands?" "Of\r\ncourse, if you like," said Tom, staring: "that\'s your wash-hand stand\r\nunder the window, second from your bed. You\'ll have to go down for more\r\nwater in the morning if you use it all."\r\n\r\n4. And on he went with his talk, while Arthur stole timidly from between\r\nthe beds out to his wash-hand stand, and began his ablutions, thereby\r\ndrawing for a moment on himself the attention of the room.\r\n\r\n5. On went the talk and laughter. Arthur finished his washing and\r\nundressing, and put on his nightgown. He then looked round more nervously\r\nthan ever. Two or three of the little boys were already in bed, sitting up\r\nwith their chins on their knees. The light burned clear, the noise went\r\non.\r\n\r\n6. It was a trying moment for the poor, little, lonely boy; however, this\r\ntime he did not ask Tom what he might or might not do, but dropped all his\r\nknees by his bedside, as he had done every day from his childhood, to open\r\nhis heart to Him who heareth the cry and beareth the sorrows of the tender\r\nchild, and the strong man in agony.\r\n\r\n7. Tom was sitting at the bottom of his bed unlacing his boots, so that\r\nhis back was towards Arthur, and he did not see what had happened, and\r\nlooked up in wonder at the sudden silence. Then two or three boys laughed\r\nand sneered, and a big, brutal fellow, who was standing in the middle of\r\nthe room, picked up a slipper and shied it at the kneeling boy, calling\r\nhim a sniveling young shaver.\r\n\r\n8. Then Tom saw the whole, and the next moment the boot he had just pulled\r\noff flew straight at the head of the bully, who had just time to throw up\r\nhis arm and catch it on his elbow. "Confound you, Brown; what\'s that for?"\r\nroared he, stamping with pain. "Never mind what I mean," said Tom,\r\nstepping on to the floor, every drop of blood in his body tingling: "if\r\nany fellow wants the other boot, he knows how to get it."\r\n\r\n9. What would have been the result is doubtful, for at this moment the\r\nsixth-form boy came in, and not another word could be said. Tom and the\r\nrest rushed into bed and finished their unrobing there, and the old\r\njanitor had put out the candle in another minute, and toddled on to the\r\nnext room, shutting the door with his usual, "Good night, gen\'l\'m\'n."\r\n\r\n10. There were many boys in the room by whom that little scene was taken\r\nto heart before they slept. But sleep seemed to have deserted the pillow\r\nof poor Tom. For some time his excitement and the flood of memories which\r\nchased one another though his brain, kept him from thinking or resolving.\r\nHis head throbbed, his heart leapt, and he could hardly keep himself from\r\nspringing out of bed and rushing about the room.\r\n\r\n11. Then the thought of his own mother came across him, and the promise he\r\nhad made at her knee, years ago, never to forget to kneel by his bedside\r\nand give himself up to his Father before he laid his head on the pillow,\r\nfrom which it might never rise; and he lay down gently, and cried as if\r\nhis heart would break. He was only fourteen years old.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--l. Waist\'coat, a vest. 2. O-ver-whelmed\', over-come, cast\r\ndown. 3. Nov\'el-ty, newness. 4. Ab-lu\'tion, the act of washing. 7.\r\nSneered, showed contempt. 8. Bul\'ly, a noisy, blustering fellow, more\r\ninsolent than courageous. Tin\'gling, having a thrilling feeling.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--"Rugby," the scene of this story, is a celebrated grammar school\r\nwhich was established at the town of Rugby, England, in 1567.\r\n\r\n9. Sixth-form boy. The school was graded into six classes or  "forms," and\r\nthe boys of the highest, or sixth, form were expected to keep the smaller\r\nboys under them in order. EXERCISES.--What were Arthur\'s feelings the\r\nfirst night at Rugby? Relate what happened when he said his prayers. What\r\ndo you think of the boy who threw the slipper? Was Tom right in defending\r\nArthur from insult?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXVIII. DARE TO DO RIGHT. (Concluded.) (186)\r\n\r\n1. It was no light act of courage in those days for a little fellow to say\r\nhis prayers publicly, even at Rugby. A few years later, when Arnold\'s\r\nmanly piety had begun to leaven the school, the tables turned: before he\r\ndied, in the Schoolhouse at least, and I believe in the other houses, the\r\nrule was the other way.\r\n\r\n2. But poor Tom had come to school in other times. The first few nights\r\nafter he came he did not kneel down because of the noise, but sat up in\r\nbed till the candle was out, and then stole out and said his prayers, in\r\nfear lest some one should find him out. So did many another poor little\r\nfellow.\r\n\r\n3. Then he began to think that he might just as well say his prayers in\r\nbed, and then that it did not matter whether he was kneeling, or sitting,\r\nor lying down. And so it had come to pass with Tom, as with all who will\r\nnot confess their Lord before men; and for the last year he had probably\r\nnot said his prayers in earnest a dozen times.\r\n\r\n4. Poor Tom! the first and bitterest feeling, which was like to break his\r\nheart, was the sense of his own cowardice. The vice of all others which he\r\nloathed was brought in and burned in on his own soul. He had lied to his\r\nmother, to his conscience, to his God. How could he bear it? And then the\r\npoor, little, weak boy, whom he had pitied and almost scorned for his\r\nweakness, had done that which he, braggart as he was, dared not do.\r\n\r\n5. The first dawn of comfort came to him in vowing to himself that he\r\nwould stand by that boy through thick and thin, and cheer him, and help\r\nhim, and bear his burdens, for the good deed done that night. Then he\r\nresolved to write home next day and tell his mother all, and what a coward\r\nher son had been. And then peace came to him as he resolved, lastly, to\r\nbear his testimony next morning.\r\n\r\n6. The morning would be harder than the night to begin with, but he felt\r\nthat he could not afford to let one chance slip. Several times he\r\nfaltered, for the Devil showed him, first, all his old friends calling him\r\n"Saint," and "Squaretoes" and a dozen hard names, and whispered to him\r\nthat his motives would be misunderstood, and he would be left alone with\r\nthe new boy; whereas, it was his duty to keep all means of influence, that\r\nhe might do good to the largest number.\r\n\r\n7. And then came the more subtle temptation, "shall I not be showing\r\nmyself braver than others by doing this? Have I any right to begin it now?\r\nOught I not rather to pray in my own study, letting other boys know that I\r\ndo so, and trying to lead them to it, while in public, at least, I should\r\ngo on as I have done?" However, his good angel was too strong that night,\r\nand he turned on his side and slept, tired of trying to reason, but\r\nresolved to follow the impulse which had been so strong, and in which he\r\nhad found peace.\r\n\r\n8. Next morning he was up and washed and dressed, all but his jacket and\r\nwaistcoat, just as the ten minutes\' bell began to ring, and then in the\r\nface of the whole room he knelt down to pray. Not five words could he\r\nsay,--the bell mocked him; he was listening for every whisper in the\r\nroom,--what were they all thinking of him?\r\n\r\n9. He was ashamed to go on kneeling, ashamed to rise from his knees. At\r\nlast, as it were from his inmost heart, a still, small voice seemed to\r\nbreathe forth the words of the publican, "God be merciful to me a sinner!"\r\nHe repeated them over and over, clinging to them as for his life, and rose\r\nfrom his knees comforted and humbled, and ready to face the whole world.\r\n\r\n10. It was not needed: two other boys besides Arthur had already followed\r\nhis example, and he went down to the great school with a glimmering of\r\nanother lesson in his heart,--the lesson that he who has conquered his own\r\ncoward spirit has conquered the whole outward world; and that other one\r\nwhich the old prophet learned in the cave at Mount Horeb, when he hid his\r\nface, and the still, small voice asked, "What doest thou here,\r\nElijah?"--that however we may fancy ourselves alone on the side of good,\r\nthe King and Lord of men is nowhere without his witnesses; for in every\r\nsociety, however seemingly corrupt and godless, there are those who have\r\nnot bowed the knee to Baal.\r\n\r\n[Transcriber\'s Footnote: Baal--Various fertility and nature gods of the\r\nancient Semitic peoples considered to be false gods by the Hebrews.]\r\n\r\n11. He found, too, how greatly he had exaggerated the effect to be\r\nproduced by his act. For a few nights there was a sneer or a laugh when he\r\nknelt down, but this passed off soon, and one by one all the other boys\r\nbut three or four followed the lead.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--l. Leav\'en, to make a general change, to imbue. 4. Loathed,\r\nhated, detested. Brag\'gart, a boaster. 5. Vow\'ing, making a solemn promise\r\nto God. Tes\'ti-mo-ny, open declaration. 6. Fal\'tered, hesitated. Mo\'tive,\r\nthat which causes action, cause, reason. 7. Sub\'tle (pro. sut\'l), artful,\r\ncunning. Stud\'y, a private room devoted to study. 10. Glim\'mer-ing, a\r\nfaint view.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.--1. Arnold\'s. Dr. Thomas Arnold was head master at Rugby nearly\r\nfifteen years. His influence on the character of the boys was very marked,\r\nand soon made the school celebrated throughout England. The Schoolhouse\r\nwas the name of one of the numerous buildings belonging to Rugby.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISES.--Relate Tom\'s early experience at Rugby. Was it courageous in\r\nhim to stop saying his prayers? How did he feel over it? What did he\r\nresolve to do? Did he carry out his resolve? What two lessons was he\r\ntaught?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXIX. THE WRECK OF THE HESPERUS. (190)\r\n\r\nBy Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, one of the greatest of American poets. He\r\nwas born in Portland, Me., in 1807. For some years he held the\r\nprofessorship of Modern Languages in Bowdoin College, and later a similar\r\nprofessorship in Harvard College. He died March 21th, 1882.\r\n\r\n1. It was the schooner Hesperus,\r\n     That sailed the wintry sea;\r\n   And the skipper had taken his little daughter,\r\n     To bear him company.\r\n\r\n2. Blue were her eyes as the fairy flax,\r\n     Her checks like the dawn of day,\r\n   And her bosom white as the hawthorn buds,\r\n     That ope in the month of May.\r\n\r\n3. The skipper, he stood beside the helm,\r\n     His pipe was in his mouth,\r\n   And he watched how the veering flaw did blow\r\n     The smoke now west, now south.\r\n\r\n4. Then up and spake an old sailor,\r\n     Had sailed to the Spanish Main,\r\n   "I pray thee, put into yonder port,\r\n     For I fear the hurricane.\r\n\r\n5. "Last night, the moon had a golden ring,\r\n     And to-night no moon we see!"\r\n   The skipper, he blew a whiff from his pipe,\r\n     And a scornful laugh laughed he.\r\n\r\n6. Colder and louder blew the wind,\r\n     A gale from the northeast;\r\n   The snow fell hissing in the brine,\r\n     And the billows frothed like yeast.\r\n\r\n7. Down came the storm, and smote amain\r\n     The vessel in its strength;\r\n   She shuddered and paused, like a frighted steed,\r\n     Then leaped her cable\'s length.\r\n\r\n8. "Come hither! come hither! my little daughter,\r\n     And do not tremble so;\r\n   For I can weather the roughest gale\r\n     That ever wind did blow."\r\n\r\n9. He wrapped her warm in his seaman\'s coat,\r\n     Against the stinging blast:\r\n   He cut a rope from a broken spar,\r\n     And bound her to the mast.\r\n\r\n10. "O father! I hear the church bells ring,\r\n      Oh say, what may it be?"\r\n    "\'Tis a fog bell on a rock-bound coast!"\r\n      And he steered for the open sea.\r\n\r\n11. "O father! I hear the sound of guns,\r\n      Oh say, what may it be?"\r\n    "Some ship in distress, that can not live\r\n      In such an angry sea!"\r\n\r\n12. "O father! I see a gleaming light,\r\n      Oh say, what may it be?"\r\n    But the father answered never a word,\r\n      A frozen corpse was he.\r\n\r\n13. Lashed to the helm, all stiff and stark,\r\n      With his face turned to the skies,\r\n    The lantern gleamed through the gleaming snow\r\n      On his fixed and glassy eyes.\r\n\r\n14. Then the maiden clasped her hands, and prayed\r\n      That saved she might be;\r\n    And she thought of Christ, who stilled the wave\r\n      On the lake of Galilee.\r\n\r\n15. And fast through the midnight dark and drear,\r\n      Through the whistling sleet and snow,\r\n    Like a sheeted ghost, the vessel swept\r\n      Tow\'rds the reef of Norman\'s Woe.\r\n\r\n16. And ever the fitful gusts between\r\n      A sound came from the land:\r\n    It was the sound of the trampling surf\r\n      On the rocks and the hard sea sand.\r\n\r\n17. The breakers were right beneath her bows,\r\n      She drifted a dreary wreck,\r\n    And a whooping billow swept the crew\r\n      Like icicles from her deck.\r\n\r\n18. She struck where the white and fleecy waves\r\n      Looked soft as carded wool,\r\n    But the cruel rocks, they gored her side\r\n      Like the horns of an angry bull.\r\n\r\n19. Her rattling shrouds, all sheathed in ice,\r\n      With the masts, went by the board;\r\n    Like a vessel of glass, she stove and sank,\r\n      Ho! ho! the breakers roared!\r\n\r\n20. At day break, on the bleak seabeach,\r\n      A fisherman stood aghast,\r\n    To see the form of a maiden fair\r\n      Lashed close to a drifting mast.\r\n\r\n21. The salt sea was frozen on her breast,\r\n      The salt tears in her eyes;\r\n    And he saw her hair, like the brown seaweed,\r\n      On the billows fall and rise.\r\n\r\n22. Such was the wreck of the Hesperus\r\n      In the midnight and the snow:\r\n    Heav\'n save us all from a death like this\r\n      On the reef of Norman\'s Woe!\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--l. Skip\'per, the master of a small merchant ves-sel. 3.\r\nVeer\'ing, changing. Flaw, a sudden gust of wind. 4. Port, harbor. 6.\r\nBrine, the sea. 7. A-main\', with sudden force. 8. Weath\'er, to endure, to\r\nresist. 9. Spar, a long beam. 13. Helm, the instrument by which a ship is\r\nsteered. 18. Card\'ed, cleaned by combing. 19.

The\r\nsyllables marked (\') have a peculiar accent not usually allowed.\r\n\r\n4. The Spanish Main was the name formerly applied to the northern coast of\r\nSouth America from the Mosquito Territory to the Leeward Islands.\r\n\r\n15. The reef of Norman\'s Woe. A dangerous ledge of rocks on the\r\nMassachusetts coast, near Gloucester harbor.\r\n\r\n19. Went by the board. A sailor\'s expression, meaning "fell over the side\r\nof the vessel."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXX. ANECDOTES OF BIRDS. (193)\r\n\r\n1. I had once a favorite black hen, "a great beauty," as she was called by\r\neveryone, and so I thought her; her feathers were so jetty, and her\r\ntopping so white and full! She knew my voice as well as any dog, and used\r\nto run cackling and bustling to my hand to receive the fragments that I\r\nnever failed to collect from the breakfast table for "Yarico," as she was\r\ncalled.\r\n\r\n2. Yarico, by the time she was a year old, hatched a respectable family of\r\nchickens; little, cowering, timid things at first, but, in due time, they\r\nbecame fine chubby ones; and old Norah said, "If I could only keep Yarico\r\nout of the copse, it would do; but the copse is full of  weasels and of\r\nfoxes.\r\n\r\n3. "I have driven her back twenty times; but she watches till some one\r\ngoes out of the gate, and then she\'s off again. It is always the case with\r\nyoung hens, Miss; they think they know better than their keepers; and\r\nnothing cures them but losing a brood or two of chickens." I have often\r\nthought since that young people, as well as young hens, buy their\r\nexperience equally dear.\r\n\r\n4. One morning; after breakfast, I went to seek my favorite in the poultry\r\nyard; plenty of hens were there, but no Yarico. The gate was open, and, as\r\nI concluded she had sought the forbidden copse, I proceeded there,\r\naccompanied by the yard mastiff; a noble fellow, steady and sagacious as a\r\njudge.\r\n\r\n5. At the end of a lane, flanked on one side by a quickset hedge, on the\r\nother by a wild common, what was called the copse commenced; but before I\r\narrived near the spot I heard a loud and tremendous cackling, and met two\r\nyoung, long-legged pullets, running with both wings and feet toward home.\r\nJock pricked up his sharp ears, and would have set off at full gallop to\r\nthe copse; but I restrained him, hastening onward, however, at the top of\r\nmy speed, thinking I had as good a right to see what was the matter as\r\nJock.\r\n\r\n6. Poor Yarico! An impertinent fox cub had attempted to carry off one of\r\nher children; but she had managed to get them behind her in the hedge, and\r\nventuring boldly forth had placed herself in front, and positively kept\r\nthe impudent animal at bay. His desire for plunder had prevented his\r\nnoticing our approach, and Jock soon made him feel the superiority of an\r\nEnglish mastiff over a cub fox.\r\n\r\n7. The most interesting portion of my tale is to come. Yarico not only\r\nnever afterward ventured to the copse, but formed a strong friendship for\r\nthe dog which had preserved her family. Whenever he appeared in the yard,\r\nshe would run to meet him, prating and clucking all the time, and impeding\r\nhis progress by walking between his legs, to his no small annoyance. If\r\nany other dog entered the yard, she would fly at him most furiously,\r\nthinking, perhaps, that he would injure her chickens; but she evidently\r\nconsidered Jock her especial protector, and treated him accordingly.\r\n\r\n8. It was very droll to see the peculiar look with which he regarded his\r\nfeathered friend; not knowing exactly what to make of her civilities, and\r\ndoubting how they should be received. When her family were educated, and\r\nable to do without her care, she was a frequent visitor at Jock\'s kennel,\r\nand would, if permitted, roost there at night, instead of returning with\r\nthe rest of the poultry to the henhouse. Yarico certainly was a most\r\ngrateful and interesting bird. * *\r\n\r\n9. One could almost believe a parrot had intellect, when he keeps up a\r\nconversation so spiritedly; and it is certainly singular to observe how\r\naccurately a well-trained bird will apply his knowledge. A friend of mine\r\nknew one that had been taught many sentences; thus, "Sally, Poll wants her\r\nbreakfast!" "Sally, Poll wants her tea!" but she never mistook the one for\r\nthe other; breakfast was invariably demanded in the morning, and tea in\r\nthe afternoon; and she always hailed her master, but no one else, by "How\r\ndo you do, Mr. A?"\r\n\r\n10. She was a most amusing bird, and could whistle dogs, which she had\r\ngreat pleasure in doing. She would drop bread out of her cage as she hung\r\nat the street door, and whistle a number about her, and then, just as they\r\nwere going to possess themselves of her bounty, utter a shrill scream of\r\n"Get out, dogs!" with such vehemence and authority as dispersed the\r\nassembled company without a morsel, to her infinite delight. * * *\r\n\r\n11. How wonderful is that instinct by which the bird of passage performs\r\nits annual migration! But how still more wonderful is it when the bird,\r\nafter its voyage of thousands of miles has been performed, and new lands\r\nvisited, returns to the precise window or eaves where, the summer before,\r\nit first enjoyed existence! And yet, such is unquestionably the fact.\r\n\r\n12. Four brothers had watched with indignation the felonious attempts of a\r\nsparrow to possess himself of the nest of a house martin, in which lay its\r\nyoung brood of four unfledged birds.\r\n\r\n13. The little fellows considered themselves as champions for the bird\r\nwhich had come over land and sea, and chosen its shelter under their\r\nmother\'s roof. They therefore marshaled themselves with blowguns, to\r\nexecute summary vengeance; but their well-meant endeavors brought\r\ndestruction upon the mud-built domicile they wished to defend. Their\r\nartillery loosened the foundations, and down it came, precipitating its\r\nfour little inmates to the ground. The mother of the children, Good\r\nSamaritan-like, replaced the little outcasts in their nest, and set it in\r\nthe open window of an unoccupied chamber.\r\n\r\n14. The parent birds, after the first terror was over, did not appear\r\ndisconcerted by the change of situation, but hourly fed their young as\r\nusual, and testified, by their unwearied twitter of pleasure, the\r\nsatisfaction and confidence they felt. There the young birds were duly\r\nfledged, and from that window they began their flight, and entered upon\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n15. The next spring, with the reappearance of the martins, came four,\r\nwhich familiarly flew into the chamber, visited all the walls, and\r\nexpressed their recognition by the most clamorous twitterings of joy. They\r\nwere, without question, the very birds that had been bred there the\r\npreceding year.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--2. Copse, a grove of small trees or bushes. 4. Sa-ga\'cious,\r\nquick in discernment. 6. Im-per\'ti-nent, rude, intru-sive. 8. Ken\'nel, a\r\nplace for dogs. 10. Ve\'he-mence, force. 11. Mi-gra\'tion, change of place,\r\nremoval. 12. Fe-lo\'ni-ous, criminal. 13. Dom\'i-cile, the home or residence\r\nof anyone. Ar-til\'er-y, weapons of warfare. 14. Dis-con-cert\'ed,\r\ninterrupted, confused. 15.

Y., in 1823, of New England\r\nparentage. Under the name of "Grace Greenwood" she has written many\r\ncharming stories for children. Some of her best sketches are in "Records\r\nof Five Years."\r\n\r\n1. One summer afternoon, when I was about eight years of age, I was\r\nstanding at an eastern window, looking at a beautiful rainbow that,\r\nbending from the sky, seemed to be losing itself in a thick, swampy wood\r\nabout a quarter of a mile distant.\r\n\r\n2. It happened that no one was in the room with me then but my brother\r\nRufus, who was just recovering from a severe illness, and was sitting,\r\npropped up with pillows, in an easy-chair, looking out, with me, at the\r\nrainbow.\r\n\r\n3. "See, brother," I said, "it drops right down among the cedars, where we\r\ngo in the spring to find wintergreens!"\r\n\r\n4. "Do you know, Gracie," said my brother, with a very serious face, "that\r\nif you should go to the end of the rain how, you would find there purses\r\nfilled with money, and great pots of gold and silver?"\r\n\r\n5. "Is it truly so?" I asked.\r\n\r\n6. "Truly so," answered my brother, with a smile. Now, I was a\r\nsimple-hearted child who believed everything that was told me, although I\r\nwas again and again imposed upon; so, without another word, I darted out\r\nof the door, and set forth toward the wood. My brother called after me as\r\nloudly as he was able, but I did not heed him.\r\n\r\n7. I cared nothing for the wet grass, which was sadly drabbling my clean\r\nfrock,--on and on I ran: I was so sure that I knew just where that rainbow\r\nended. I remember how glad and proud I was in my thoughts, and what fine\r\npresents I promised to all my friends out of my great riches.\r\n\r\n8. So thinking, and laying delightful plans, almost before I knew it I had\r\nreached the cedar grove, and the end of the rainbow was not there! But I\r\nsaw it shining down among the trees a little farther off; so on and on I\r\nstruggled, through the thick bushes and over logs, till I came within the\r\nsound of a stream which ran through the swamp. Then I thought, "What if\r\nthe rainbow should come down right in the middle of that deep, muddy\r\nbrook!"\r\n\r\n9. Ah! but I was frightened for my heavy pots of gold and silver, and my\r\npurses of money. How should I ever find them there? and what a time I\r\nshould have getting them out! I reached the bank of the stream, and "the\r\nend was not yet." But I could see it a little way off on the other side. I\r\ncrossed the creek on a fallen tree, and still ran on, though my limbs\r\nseemed to give way, and my side ached with fatigue.\r\n\r\n10. The woods grew thicker and darker, the ground more wet and swampy, and\r\nI found, as many grown people had found before me, that there was rather\r\nhard traveling in a journey after, riches. Suddenly I met in my way a\r\nlarge porcupine, who made himself still larger when he saw me, as a cross\r\ncat raises its back and makes tails at a dog. Fearing that he would shoot\r\nhis sharp quills at me, I ran from him as fast as my tired feet would\r\ncarry me.\r\n\r\n11. In my fright and hurry I forgot to keep my eye on the rainbow, as I\r\nhad done before; and when, at last, I remembered and looked for it, it was\r\nnowhere in sight! It had quite faded away. When I saw that it was indeed\r\ngone, I burst into tears; for I had lost all my treasures, and had nothing\r\nto show for my pilgrimage but muddy feet and a wet and torn frock. So I\r\nset out for home.\r\n\r\n12. But I soon found that my troubles had only begun; I could not find my\r\nway: I was lost! I could not tell which was east or west, north or south,\r\nbut wandered about here and there, crying and calling, though I knew that\r\nno one could hear me.\r\n\r\n13. All at once I heard voices shouting and hallooing; but, instead of\r\nbeing rejoiced at this, I was frightened, fearing that the Indians were\r\nupon me! I crawled under some bushes, by the side of a large log, and lay\r\nperfectly still. I was wet, cold, scared, altogether very miserable\r\nindeed; yet, when the voices came near, I did not start up and show\r\nmyself.\r\n\r\n14. At last I heard my own name called; but I remembered that Indians were\r\nvery cunning, and thought they might have found it out some way, so I did\r\nnot answer. Then came a voice near me, that sounded like that of my eldest\r\nbrother, who lived away from home, and whom I had not seen for many\r\nmonths; but I dared not believe that the voice was his.\r\n\r\n15. Soon some one sprang up on the log by which I lay, and stood there\r\ncalling. I could not see his face; I could only see the tips of his toes,\r\nbut by them I saw that he wore a nice pair of boots, and not moccasins.\r\nYet I remembered that some Indians dressed like white folks; so I still\r\nkept quiet, till I heard shouted over me a pet name, which this brother\r\nhad given me. It was the funniest name in the world.\r\n\r\n16. I knew that no Indian knew of the name, as it was a little family\r\nsecret; so I sprang up, and caught my brother about the ankles. I hardly\r\nthink that an Indian could have given a louder yell than he gave then; and\r\nhe jumped so that he fell off the log down by my side. But nobody was\r\nhurt; and, after kissing me till he had kissed away all my tears, he\r\nhoisted me on to his shoulder, called my other brothers, who were hunting\r\nin different directions, and we all set out for home.\r\n\r\n17. I had been gone nearly three hours, and had wandered a number of\r\nmiles. My brother Joseph\'s coming and asking for me, had first set them to\r\ninquiring and searching me out. When I went into the room where my brother\r\nRufus sat, he said, "Why, my poor little sister! I did not mean to send\r\nyou off on such a wild-goose chase to the end of the rainbow. I thought\r\nyou would know I was only quizzing you."\r\n\r\n18. Then my eldest brother took me on his knee, and told me what the\r\nrainbow really is: that it is only painted air, and does not rest on the\r\nearth, so nobody could ever find the end; and that God has set it in the\r\ncloud to remind him and us of his promise never again to drown the world\r\nwith a flood. "Oh, I think God\'s Promise would be a beautiful name for the\r\nrainbow!" I said.\r\n\r\n19. "Yes," replied my mother, "but it tells us something more than that he\r\nwill not send great floods upon the earth,--it tells us of his beautiful\r\nlove always bending over us from the skies. And I trust that when my\r\nlittle girl sets forth on a pilgrimage to find God\'s love, she will be led\r\nby the rainbow of his promise through all the dark places of this world to\r\n\'treasures laid up in heaven,\' better, far better, than silver or gold."\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--2.

(202)\r\n\r\nBy Samuel Woodworth, who was born in Massachusetts in 1785. He was both\r\nauthor and editor. This is his best known poem. He died in 1842.\r\n\r\n1. How dear to this heart are the scenes of my childhood,\r\n     When fond recollection presents them to view!\r\n   The orchard, the meadow, the deep tangled wildwood,\r\n     And every loved spot which my infancy knew;\r\n   The wide-spreading pond, and the mill that stood by it:\r\n     The bridge and the rock where the cataract fell:\r\n   The cot of my father, the dairy house nigh it,\r\n     And e\'en the rude bucket which hung in the well:\r\n   The old oaken bucket, the ironbound bucket,\r\n     The moss-covered bucket which hung in the well.\r\n\r\n2. That moss-covered vessel I hail as a treasure;\r\n     For often, at noon, when returned from the field,\r\n   I found it the source of an exquisite pleasure,\r\n     The purest and sweetest that nature can yield.\r\n   How ardent I seized it, with hands that were glowing,\r\n     And quick to the white-pebble bottom it fell;\r\n   Then soon, with the emblem of truth overflowing,\r\n     And dripping with coolness, it rose from the well:\r\n   The old oaken bucket, the ironbound bucket,\r\n     The moss-covered bucket arose from the well.\r\n\r\n3. How sweet from the green mossy brim to receive it,\r\n     As poised on the curb, it inclined to my lips!\r\n   Not a full blushing goblet could tempt me to leave it,\r\n     Though filled with the nectar which Jupiter sips;\r\n   And now, far removed from thy loved situation,\r\n     The tear of regret will intrusively swell,\r\n   As fancy reverts to my father\'s plantation,\r\n     And sighs for the bucket which hangs in the well:\r\n   The old oaken bucket, the ironbound bucket,\r\n     The moss-covered bucket, which hangs in the well.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--l. Cat\'a-ract, a great fall of water. 2. O-ver--flow\'ing,\r\nrunning over. Ex\'qui-site, exceeding, extreme. 3. Poised\', balanced.\r\nGoblet, a kind of cup or drinking vessel. Nec\'tar, the drink of the gods.\r\nIn-tru\'sive-ly, without right or welcome. Re-verts\', returns.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISES.--Who was the author of "The Old Oaken Bucket"? What is said of\r\nthis piece? What does the poem describe? and what feeling does it express?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXIII. THE SERMON ON THE MOUNT. (204)\r\n\r\n1. And seeing the multitudes, he went up into a mountain: and when he was\r\nset, his disciples came unto him; and he opened his mouth and taught them,\r\nsaying,\r\n\r\n2. Blessed are the poor in spirit; for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.\r\nBlessed are they that mourn; for they shall be comforted. Blessed are the\r\nmeek; for they shall inherit the earth.\r\n\r\n3. Blessed are they which do hunger and thirst after righteousness; for\r\nthey shall be filled. Blessed are the merciful; for they shall obtain\r\nmercy. Blessed are the pure in heart; for they shall see God.\r\n\r\n4. Blessed are the peacemakers; for they shall be called the children of\r\nGod. Blessed are they which are persecuted for righteousness\' sake; for\r\ntheirs is the kingdom of heaven.\r\n\r\n5. Blessed are ye when men shall revile you, and persecute you, and shall\r\nsay all manner of evil against you falsely, for my sake. Rejoice and be\r\nexceeding glad; for great is your reward in heaven. * * *\r\n\r\n6. Ye have heard that it hath been said by them of old time, Thou shalt\r\nnot forswear thyself, but shalt perform unto the Lord thine oaths: but I\r\nsay unto you, Swear not at all; neither by heaven; for it is God\'s throne:\r\nnor by the earth; for it is his footstool: neither by Jerusalem; for it is\r\nthe city of the great King.\r\n\r\n7. Neither shalt thou swear by thy head, because thou canst not make one\r\nhair white or black. But let your communication be, Yea, yea; Nay, nay:\r\nfor whatsoever is more than these cometh of evil.\r\n\r\n8. Ye have heard that it hath been said, An eye for an eye, and a tooth\r\nfor a tooth: but I say unto you, That ye resist not evil; but whosoever\r\nshall smite thee on thy right cheek, turn to him the other also. And if\r\nany man will sue thee at the law, and take away thy coat, let him have thy\r\ncloak also. And whosoever shall compel thee to go a mile, go with him\r\ntwain. Give to him that asketh thee, and from him that would borrow of\r\nthee turn not thou away.\r\n\r\n9. Ye have heard that it hath been said, Thou shalt love thy neighbor and\r\nhate thine enemy: but I say unto you, Love your enemies; bless them that\r\ncurse you, do good to them that hate you, and pray for them which\r\ndespitefully use you and persecute you; that ye may be the children of\r\nyour Father which is in heaven: for he maketh his sun to rise on the evil\r\nand on the good, and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust.\r\n\r\n10. For if ye love them which love you, what reward have ye? do not even\r\nthe publicans the same? And if ye salute your brethren only, what do ye\r\nmore than others? do not even the publicans so? Be ye, therefore, perfect,\r\neven as your Father which is in heaven is perfect. * * *\r\n\r\n11. Judge not, that ye be not judged. For with what judgment ye judge, ye\r\nshall be judged: and with what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to\r\nyou again. And why beholdest thou the mote that is in thy brother\'s eye,\r\nbut considerest not the beam that is in thine own eye?\r\n\r\n12. Or how wilt thou say to thy brother, Let me pull out the mote out of\r\nthine eye; and, behold, a beam is in thine own eye? Thou hypocrite, first\r\ncast out the beam out of thine own eye; and then shalt thou see clearly to\r\ncast out the mote out of thy brother\'s eye. * * *\r\n\r\n13. Ask, and it shall be given you; seek, and ye shall find; knock, and it\r\nshall be opened unto you: for everyone that asketh, receiveth; and he that\r\nseeketh, findeth; and to him that knocketh, it shall be opened. Or what\r\nman is there of you, whom if his son ask bread, will he give him a stone?\r\nOr if he ask a fish, will he give him a serpent?\r\n\r\n14. If ye then, being evil, know how to give good gifts unto your\r\nchildren, how much more shall your Father which is in heaven give good\r\nthings to them that ask him? Therefore all things whatsoever ye would that\r\nmen should do to you, do ye even so to them; for this is the law and the\r\nprophets. * * *\r\n\r\n15. Whosoever heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them, I will liken\r\nhim unto a wise man, which built his house upon a rock: and the rain\r\ndescended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat upon that\r\nhouse; and it fell not; for it was founded upon a rock.\r\n\r\n16. And everyone that heareth these sayings of mine, and doeth them not,\r\nshall be likened unto a foolish man, which built his house upon the sand:\r\nand the rain descended, and the floods came, and the winds blew, and beat\r\nupon that house; and it fell: and great was the fall of it.\r\n\r\n17. And it came to pass, when Jesus had ended these sayings, the people\r\nwere astonished at his doctrine: for he taught them as one having\r\nauthority, and not as the scribes.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--l. Dis-ci\'ple, one who receives instruction from another. 2.\r\nBless\'ed, happy. In-her\'it, to come into possession of. 5. Re-vile\', to\r\nspeak against without cause. Per\'se-cute, to punish on account of\r\nreligion. 6. For-swear\', to swear falsely. 9. De-spite\'ful-ly,\r\nmaliciously, cruelly. 10. Pub\'li-cans, tax collectors (they were often\r\noppressive and were hated by the Jews). 11. Mete, to measure. Mote, a\r\nsmall particle. 12. Hyp\'o-crite, a false pretender. 17. Scribes, men among\r\nthe Jews who read and explained the law to the people.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISES.--Who delivered this sermon? Who are blessed? and why? Is it\r\nright to swear? How should we treat our enemies? Should we judge others\r\nharshly? What does Jesus say of him who finds faults in his neighbor, but\r\ndoes not see his own? What is said about prayer? About our conduct to\r\nothers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXIV. THE YOUNG WITNESS. (207)\r\nBy S. H. HAMMOND.\r\n\r\n1. A little girl nine years of age was brought into court, and offered as\r\na witness against a prisoner who was on trial for a crime committed in her\r\nfather\'s house.\r\n\r\n2. "Now, Emily," said the counsel for the prisoner, "I wish to know if you\r\nunderstand the nature of an oath?"\r\n\r\n3. "I don\'t know what you mean," was the simple answer.\r\n\r\n4. "Your Honor," said the counsel, addressing the judge, "it is evident\r\nthat this witness should be rejected. She does not understand the nature\r\nof an oath."\r\n\r\n5. "Let us see," said the judge. "Come here, my daughter."\r\n\r\n6. Assured by the kind tone and manner of the judge, the child stepped\r\ntoward him, and looked confidingly in his face, with a calm, clear eye,\r\nand in a manner so artless and frank that it went straight to the heart.\r\n\r\n7. "Did you ever take an oath?" inquired the judge.\r\n\r\n8. The little girl stepped back with a look of horror; and the red blood\r\nrose and spread in a blush all over her face and neck, as she answered,\r\n"No, sir." She thought he intended to ask if she had ever used profane\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\n9. "I do not mean that," said the judge, who saw her mistake; "I mean were\r\nyou ever a witness?"\r\n\r\n10. "No, sir; I never was in court before," was the answer.\r\n\r\n11. He handed her the Bible open. "Do you know that book, my daughter?"\r\n\r\n12. She looked at it and answered, "Yes, sir; it is the Bible."\r\n\r\n13. "Do you ever read in it?" he asked.\r\n\r\n14. "Yes, sir; every evening."\r\n\r\n15. "Can you tell me what the Bible is?" inquired the judge.\r\n\r\n16. "It is the word of the great God," she answered.\r\n\r\n17. "Well," said the judge, "place your hand upon this Bible, and listen\r\nto what I say;" and he repeated slowly and solemnly the following oath:\r\n"Do you swear that in the evidence which you shall give in this case, you\r\nwill tell the truth, and nothing but the truth; and that you will ask God\r\nto help you?"\r\n\r\n18. "I do," she replied.\r\n\r\n19. "Now," said the judge, "you have been sworn as a witness; will you\r\ntell me what will befall you if you do not tell the truth?"\r\n\r\n20. "I shall be shut up in the state prison," answered the child.\r\n\r\n21. "Anything else?" asked the judge.\r\n\r\n22. "I shall never go to heaven," she replied.\r\n\r\n23. "How do you know this?" asked the judge again.\r\n\r\n24. The child took the Bible, turned rapidly to the chapter containing the\r\ncommandments, and, pointing to the one which reads, "Thou shalt not bear\r\nfalse witness against thy neighbor," said, "I learned that before I could\r\nread."\r\n\r\n25. "Has anyone talked with you about being a witness in court here\r\nagainst this man?" inquired the judge.\r\n\r\n26. "Yes, sir," she replied, "my mother heard they wanted me to be a\r\nwitness; and last night she called me to her room, and asked me to tell\r\nher the Ten Commandments; and then we kneeled down together, and she\r\nprayed that I might understand how wicked it was to bear false witness\r\nagainst my neighbor, and that God would help me, a little child, to tell\r\nthe truth as it was before him.\r\n\r\n27. "And when I came up here with father, she kissed me, and told me to\r\nremember the Ninth Commandment, and that God would hear every word that I\r\nsaid."\r\n\r\n28. "Do you believe this?" asked the judge, while a tear glistened in his\r\neye, and his lip quivered with emotion.\r\n\r\n29. "Yes, sir," said the child, with a voice and manner which showed that\r\nher conviction of the truth was perfect.\r\n\r\n30. "God bless you, my child," said the judge, "you have a good mother.\r\nThe witness is competent," he continued. "Were I on trial for my life, and\r\ninnocent of the charge against me, I would pray God for such a witness as\r\nthis. Let her be examined."\r\n\r\n31. She told her story with the simplicity of a child, as she was; but her\r\nvoice and manner carried conviction of her truthfulness to every heart.\r\n\r\n32. The lawyers asked her many perplexing questions, but she did not vary\r\nin the least from her first statement.\r\n\r\n33. The truth, as spoken by a little child, was sublime. Falsehood and\r\nperjury had preceded her testimony; but before her testimony, falsehood\r\nwas scattered like chaff.\r\n\r\n34. The little child, for whom a mother had prayed for strength to be\r\ngiven her to speak the truth as it was before God, broke the cunning\r\ndevice of matured villainy to pieces, like a potter\'s vessel. The strength\r\nthat her mother prayed for was given her; and the sublime and terrible\r\nsimplicity,--terrible to the prisoner and his associates,--was like a\r\nrevelation from God himself.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--l. Wit\'ness, one who gives testimony. Com--mit\'ted, done,\r\nperformed. 2. Coun\'sel, a lawyer. 4. Re-ject\'ed, refused. 6. As-sured\',\r\nmade bold. Con-fid\'ing-ly, with trust. 8. Pro-fane\', irreverent, taking\r\nthe name of God in vain. 33. Per\'ju-ry, the act of willfully making a\r\nfalse oath. Chaff, the light dry husk of grains or grasses. 34. Ma-tured\',\r\nperfected, fully developed. Pot\'ter, one whose occupation is to make\r\nearthen vessels. Rev--e-la\'tion, the act of disclosing or showing what was\r\nbefore unknown.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISES.--What is this story about? Why did the counsel wish to have\r\nEmily refused as a witness? Was she a fit person to be a witness? How was\r\nthis shown? Which commandment forbids us to bear false witness? What was\r\nthe result of Emily\'s testimony?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXV. KING SOLOMON AND THE ANTS. (211)\r\n\r\nBy John Greenleaf Whittier, born near Haverhill, Mass., In 1807, and died\r\nat Hampton Falls, N. H., In 1892. Until he was eighteen years old he\r\nworked on the farm, and during that time learned the trade at a shoemaker.\r\nHe afterwards became an editor and one of the first poets of America.\r\n\r\n1. Out from Jerusalem\r\n     The king rode with his great\r\n     War chiefs and lords of state,\r\n   And Sheba\'s queen with them.\r\n\r\n2. Proud in the Syrian sun,\r\n     In gold and purple sheen,\r\n     The dusky Ethiop queen\r\n   Smiled on King Solomon.\r\n\r\n3. Wisest of men, he knew\r\n     The languages of all\r\n     The creatures great or small\r\n   That trod the earth or flew.\r\n\r\n4. Across an ant-hill led\r\n     The king\'s path, and he heard\r\n     Its small folk, and their word\r\n   He thus interpreted:\r\n\r\n5. "Here comes the king men greet\r\n     As wise and good and just,\r\n     To crush us in the dust\r\n   Under his heedless feet."\r\n\r\n6. The great king bowed his head,\r\n     And saw the wide surprise\r\n     Of the Queen of Sheba\'s eyes\r\n   As he told her what they said.\r\n\r\n7. "O king!" she whispered sweet,\r\n     "Too happy fate have they\r\n     Who perish in thy way\r\n   Beneath thy gracious feet!\r\n\r\n8. "Thou of the God-lent crown,\r\n     Shall these vile creatures dare\r\n     Murmur against thee where\r\n   The knees of kings kneel down?"\r\n\r\n9. "Nay," Solomon replied,\r\n     "The wise and strong should seek\r\n     The welfare of the weak;"\r\n   And turned his horse aside.\r\n\r\n10. His train, with quick alarm,\r\n      Curved with their leader round\r\n      The ant-hill\'s peopled mound,\r\n    And left it free from harm.\r\n\r\n11. The jeweled head bent low;\r\n      "O king!" she said, "henceforth\r\n      The secret of thy worth\r\n    And wisdom well I know.\r\n\r\n12. "Happy must be the State\r\n      Whose ruler heedeth more\r\n      The murmurs of the poor\r\n    Than flatteries of the great."\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--4. In-ter\'pret-ed, explained the meaning of. 5. Greet,\r\nAddress, salute. 9. Wel\'fare, happiness. 10. Train, a body of followers.\r\n12. Flat\'ter-ies, praises for the purpose of gratifying vanity or gaining\r\nfavor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXVI. RIVERMOUTH THEATER. (213)\r\n\r\nFrom "The Story of a Bad Boy," by Thomas Bailey Aldrich. The author was\r\nborn at Portsmouth, N. H., in 1836. When quite young his family moved to\r\nLouisiana, but he was sent back to New England to be educated, and later\r\nhe located at New York. He is a well-known writer of both prose and\r\npoetry.\r\n\r\n1. "Now, boys, what shall we do?" I asked, addressing a thoughtful\r\nconclave of seven, assembled in our barn one dismal, rainy afternoon.\r\n"Let\'s have a theater," suggested Binny Wallace.\r\n\r\n2. The very thing! But where? The loft of the stable was ready to burst\r\nwith hay provided for Gypsy, but the long room over the carriage house was\r\nunoccupied. The place of all places! My managerial eye saw at a glance its\r\ncapabilities for a theater.\r\n\r\n3. I had been to the play a great many times in New Orleans, and was wise\r\nin matters pertaining to the drama. So here, in due time, was set up some\r\nextraordinary scenery of my own painting. The curtain, I recollect, though\r\nit worked smoothly enough on other occasions, invariably hitched during\r\nthe performances.\r\n\r\n4. The theater, however, was a success, as far as it went. I retired from\r\nthe business with no fewer than fifteen hundred pins, after deducting the\r\nheadless, the pointless, and the crooked pins with which our doorkeeper\r\nfrequently got "stuck." From first to last we took in a great deal of this\r\ncounterfeit money. The price of admission to the "Rivermouth Theater" was\r\ntwenty pins. I played all the principal characters myself--not that I was\r\na finer actor than the other boys, but because I owned the establishment.\r\n\r\n5. At the tenth representation, my dramatic career was brought to a close\r\nby an unfortunate circumstance. We were playing the drama of "William\r\nTell, the Hero of Switzerland." Of course I was William Tell, in spite of\r\nFred Langdon, who wanted to act that character himself. I wouldn\'t let\r\nhim, so he withdrew from the company, taking the only bow and arrow we had.\r\n\r\n6. I made a crossbow out of a piece of whalebone, and did very well\r\nwithout him. We had reached that exciting scene where Gesler, the Austrian\r\ntyrant, commands Tell to shoot the apple from his son\'s head. Pepper\r\nWhitcomb, who played all the juvenile and women parts, was my son.\r\n\r\n7. To guard against mischance, a piece of pasteboard was fastened by a\r\nhandkerchief over the upper portion of Whitcomb\'s face, while the arrow to\r\nbe used was sewed up in a strip of flannel. I was a capital marksman, and\r\nthe big apple, only two yards distant, turned its russet cheek fairly\r\ntowards me.\r\n\r\n8. I can see poor little Pepper now, as he stood without flinching,\r\nwaiting for me to perform my great feat. I raised the crossbow amid the\r\nbreathless silence of the crowded audience--consisting of seven boys and\r\nthree girls, exclusive of Kitty Collins, who insisted on paying her way in\r\nwith a clothespin. I raised the crossbow, I repeat. Twang! went the\r\nwhipcord; but, alas! instead of hitting the apple, the arrow flew right\r\ninto Pepper Whitcomb\'s mouth, which happened to be open at the time, and\r\ndestroyed my aim.\r\n\r\n9. I shall never be able to banish that awful moment from my memory.\r\nPepper\'s roar, expressive of astonishment, indignation, and pain, is still\r\nringing in my ears. I looked upon him as a corpse, and, glancing not far\r\ninto the dreary future, pictured myself led forth to execution in the\r\npresence of the very same spectators then assembled.\r\n\r\n10. Luckily, poor Pepper was not seriously hurt; but Grandfather Nutter,\r\nappearing in the midst of the confusion (attracted by the howls of young\r\nTell), issued an injunction against all theatricals thereafter, and the\r\nplace was closed; not, however, without a farewell speech from me, in\r\nwhich I said that this would have been the proudest moment of my life if I\r\nhadn\'t hit Pepper Whitcomb in the mouth. Whereupon the audience (assisted,\r\nI am glad to state, by Pepper) cried, "Hear! hear!"\r\n\r\n11. I then attributed the accident to Pepper himself, whose mouth, being\r\nopen at the instant I fired, acted upon the arrow much after the fashion\r\nof a whirlpool, and drew in the fatal shaft. I was about to explain how a\r\ncomparatively small maelstrom could suck in the largest ship, when the\r\ncurtain fell of its own accord, amid the shouts of the audience.\r\n\r\n12. This was my last appearance on any stage. It was some time, though,\r\nbefore I heard the end of the William Tell business. Malicious little boys\r\nwho hadn\'t been allowed to buy tickets to my theater used to cry out after\r\nme in the street,-"\'Who killed Cock Robin?\'"\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--l.

More than a thousand years ago, (in the year 849), a prince was born in\r\nEngland, who afterwards became one of the most celebrated and best loved\r\nkings in the world. His name was Alfred--afterwards called Alfred the\r\nGreat--and he was the favorite son both of the king and queen.\r\n\r\n2. In those days the common people were very ignorant; few of them could\r\neven read and write. There were no schools, and the monasteries, where\r\nalmost the only teaching had been done, were nearly all destroyed in the\r\nwars which were continually going on. Only the higher classes had any\r\nchance to study, and even they paid much more attention to fighting than\r\nto studying.\r\n\r\n3. But Alfred was different from most persons of his time. Even when a\r\nlittle boy, he delighted in listening to poems and to the ballads which\r\nharpers used to sing, and he learned many of them by heart. When he was\r\ntwelve years old, his mother, the queen, offered to give a volume of poems\r\nto that one of her four sons who would first learn to read it. Alfred was\r\nthe youngest of them all, yet he easily won the prize of which his\r\nbrothers thought so little.\r\n\r\n4. But, as has been said, these were stirring times, and Alfred was soon\r\ncalled on to show his great abilities as a soldier. The Danes, a warlike\r\npeople, were continually swooping down in their vessels upon the coast of\r\nEngland. Often they spread over the entire country, plundering and burning\r\nthe towns, and killing the people.\r\n\r\n5. In the midst of these invasions Alfred became king, when he was only\r\ntwenty-two years old. He proved as good a warrior as he was a student. He\r\nthought that whatever is worth doing at all is worth doing well. He was\r\ngenerally successful against the Danes, but at one time they seemed to\r\nhave the country entirely in their power, and Alfred was compelled to hide\r\nfor his life.\r\n\r\n6. For some time he dressed as a peasant, and lived in the cottage of a\r\ncowherd, who was so careful of his king\'s safety that he did not even tell\r\nhis wife who he was. So she treated the king as a common peasant, and one\r\nday gave him a sharp scolding because he allowed some cakes to burn on the\r\ngriddle, after she had left him to watch them. She told him he was clever\r\nenough at eating cakes though he managed so badly at baking them.\r\n\r\n7. When the search for him grew less active, Alfred gradually collected\r\nsome of his followers, with whom he encamped on a small spot of firm\r\nground in the center of a bog. It was surrounded by almost impassable\r\nforests, and Alfred fortified the place so that it could not well be\r\ntaken. Then he made frequent sudden and successful attacks on the enemy\r\nuntil his troops and the people became encouraged.\r\n\r\n8. One victory in particular, when they captured a banner which the Danes\r\nthought enchanted, led Alfred to take bolder steps. He wished to find out\r\nthe exact condition of the enemy, and, for this purpose, disguised himself\r\nas a harper and entered their camp. He was so successful in his disguise\r\nthat he remained there some days, even being admitted to the tent of the\r\nDanish leader Guthrum.\r\n\r\n9. He found their entire army living in careless security, and so he\r\ndetermined to make a sudden and bold attack on them, to try and rid his\r\ncountry once more of these cruel invaders. He summoned his people about\r\nhim from far and wide. Many of them had long thought their beloved king\r\ndead, but now all eagerly obeyed his call.\r\n\r\n10. He at once led them against that part of the camp which he had seen to\r\nbe most unguarded. The attack was entirely unexpected; and, although the\r\nDanes were greater in numbers, they were defeated with great slaughter.\r\nSome of them, with their leader, fled to a fortified place, but were soon\r\nobliged to surrender.\r\n\r\n11. Alfred granted them their lives, and settled them in a part of his\r\nkingdom where nearly all his own people had been destroyed. He hoped by\r\nthis to change obstinate enemies into useful friends who would protect\r\nEngland from further attacks of their own countrymen. However, some years\r\nlater, when the Danes made another invasion, these people joined them in\r\nfighting against Alfred, but he soon succeeded in driving them all out of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\n12. Much as Alfred did for his people in war, he did more in time of\r\npeace. Above all else he gave careful attention to their education. He\r\nrebuilt the monasteries and aided the young University of Oxford. He also\r\nfounded many schools, to which every owner of a certain portion of land\r\nwas compelled to send his children.\r\n\r\n13. But he did as much good by the example that he set as by these acts.\r\nHis time was divided into three parts. One was given to business, one to\r\nrefreshment by sleep and food, and the third to study and devotion. Clocks\r\nand watches, and probably even sundials, were then unknown, so these\r\ndivisions were marked by burning candles of equal lengths.\r\n\r\n14. Alfred did not study for his own pleasure merely, but translated and\r\nwrote many works for the good of his people, using the simple language\r\nwhich they could easily understand and enjoy. His person was handsome and\r\ndignified, full of grace and activity. But the more noble beauty was\r\nwithin, in the enlightened mind and virtuous heart of the king. After his\r\nname, which has its place on an ancient record of English kings, is\r\nwritten the noble title of "Truth Teller."\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--2. Mon\'as-ter-y, a religious house where monks live. 5.\r\nIn-va\'sion, the warlike entrance of an army. 8. Dis-guised\', hidden by an\r\nunusual dress and appearance. 12.

En-light\'ened, well informed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXVII. LIVING ON A FARM. (220)\r\n\r\n1. How brightly through the mist of years,\r\n   My quiet country home appears!\r\n   My father busy all the day\r\n   In plowing corn or raking hay;\r\n   My mother moving with delight\r\n   Among the milk pans, silver-bright;\r\n   We children, just from school set free,\r\n   Filling the garden with our glee.\r\n   The blood of life was flowing warm\r\n   When I was living on a farm.\r\n\r\n2. I hear the sweet churchgoing bell,\r\n   As o\'er the fields its music fell,\r\n   I see the country neighbors round\r\n   Gathering beneath the pleasant sound;\r\n   They stop awhile beside the door,\r\n   To talk their homely matters o\'er\r\n   The springing corn, the ripening grain,\r\n   And "how we need a little rain;"\r\n   "A little sun would do no harm,\r\n   We want good weather for the farm."\r\n\r\n3. When autumn came, what joy to see\r\n   The gathering of the husking bee,\r\n   To hear the voices keeping tune,\r\n   Of girls and boys beneath the moon,\r\n   To mark the golden corn ears bright,\r\n   More golden in the yellow light!\r\n   Since I have learned the ways of men,\r\n   I often turn to these again,\r\n   And feel life wore its highest charm.\r\n   When I was living on the farm.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXIX. HUGH IDLE AND MR. TOIL. (221)\r\n\r\nAdapted from the story of "Little Daffydowndilly," by Nathaniel Hawthorne.\r\nThe author was born at Salem, Mass., in 1804, and ranks among the first of\r\nAmerican novelists. He died in 1864.\r\n\r\n1. Hugh Idle loved to do only what was agreeable, and took no delight in\r\nlabor of any kind. But while Hugh was yet a little boy, he was sent away\r\nfrom home, and put under the care of a very strict schoolmaster, who went\r\nby the name of Mr. Toil.\r\n\r\n2. Those who knew him best, affirmed that Mr. Toil was a very worthy\r\ncharacter, and that he had done more good, both to children and grown\r\npeople, than anybody else in the world. He had, however, a severe and ugly\r\ncountenance; his voice was harsh; and all his ways and customs were\r\ndisagreeable to our young friend, Hugh Idle.\r\n\r\n3. The whole day long this terrible old schoolmaster sulked about among\r\nhis scholars, with a big cane in his hand; and unless a lad chose to\r\nattend constantly and quietly to his book, he had no chance of enjoying a\r\nsingle quiet moment. "This will never do for me," thought Hugh; "I\'ll run\r\noff, and try to find my way home."\r\n\r\n4. So the very next morning off he started, with only some bread and\r\ncheese for his breakfast, and very little pocket money to pay his\r\nexpenses. He had gone but a short distance, when he overtook a man of\r\ngrave and sedate appearance trudging at a moderate pace along the road.\r\n\r\n5. "Good morning, my fine lad!" said the stranger; and his voice seemed\r\nhard and severe, yet had a sort of kindness in it; "whence do you come so\r\nearly, and whither are you going?"\r\n\r\n6. Now Hugh was a boy of very frank disposition, and had never been known\r\nto tell a lie in all his life. Nor did he tell one now, but confessed that\r\nhe had run away from school on account of his great dislike to Mr. Toil.\r\n"Oh, very well, my little friend!" answered the stranger; "then we will go\r\ntogether; for I likewise have had a good deal to do with Mr. Toil, and\r\nshould be glad to find some place where he was never heard of." So they\r\nwalked on very sociably side by side.\r\n\r\n7. By and by their road led them past a field, where some haymakers were\r\nat work. Hugh could not help thinking how much pleasanter it must be to\r\nmake hay in the sunshine, under the blue sky, than to learn lessons all\r\nday long, shut up in a dismal schoolroom, continually watched by Mr. Toil.\r\n\r\n8. But in the midst of these thoughts, while he was stopping to peep over\r\nthe stone wall, he started back and caught hold of his companion\'s hand.\r\n"Quick, quick!" cried he; "let us run away, or he will catch us!"\r\n\r\n9. "Who will catch us?" asked the stranger.\r\n\r\n10. "Mr. Toil, the old schoolmaster," answered Hugh; "don\'t you see him\r\namong the haymakers?" and Hugh pointed to an elderly man, who seemed to be\r\nthe owner of the field.\r\n\r\n11. He was busily at work in his shirt sleeves. The drops of sweat stood\r\nupon his brow; and he kept constantly crying out to his work people to\r\nmake hay while the sun shone. Strange to say, the features of the old\r\nfarmer were precisely the same as those of Mr. Toil, who at that very\r\nmoment must have been just entering the schoolroom.\r\n\r\n12. "Don\'t be afraid," said the stranger; "this is not Mr. Toil, the\r\nschoolmaster, but a brother of his, who was bred a farmer. He won\'t\r\ntrouble you, unless you become a laborer on his farm."\r\n\r\n13. Hugh believed what his companion said, but was glad when they were out\r\nof sight of the old farmer who bore such a singular resemblance to Mr.\r\nToil. The two travelers came to a spot where some carpenters were building\r\na house. Hugh begged his companion to stop awhile, for it was a pretty\r\nsight to see how neatly the carpenters did their work with their saws,\r\nplanes, and hammers; and he was beginning to think he too should like to\r\nuse the saw, and the plane, and the hammer, and be a carpenter himself.\r\nBut suddenly he caught sight of something that made him seize his friend\'s\r\nhand, in a great fright.\r\n\r\n14. "Make haste! quick, quick!" cried he; "there\'s old Mr. Toil again."\r\nThe stranger cast his eyes where Hugh pointed his finger, and saw an\r\nelderly man, who seemed to be overseeing the carpenters, as he went to and\r\nfro about the unfinished house, marking out the work to be done, and\r\nurging the men to be diligent; and wherever he turned his hard and\r\nwrinkled visage, they sawed and hammered as if for dear life.\r\n\r\n15. "Oh, no! this is not Mr. Toil, the schoolmaster," said the stranger;\r\n"it is another brother of his who follows the trade of carpenter."\r\n\r\n16. "I am very glad to hear it," quoth Hugh; "but if you please, sir, I\r\nshould like to get out of his way as soon as possible."\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1. A-gree\'a-ble, pleasing. 2. Af-firmed\', declared. 4.\r\nEx-pens\'es, costs.  Se-date\', calm. Mod\'er-ate, neither fast nor slow,\r\nDis-po-si\'tion, natural state of mind. Con-fessed\', ac-knowledged.\r\nSo\'cia-bly, in a friendly way. 11. Fea\'tures, the distinctive marks of the\r\nface. 13. Re-sem\'blance, likeness. 14. Dil\'i-gent, industrious. Vis\'age,\r\nthe face. 16. Quoth, said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXX. HUGH IDLE AND MR. TOIL. (Concluded.) (224)\r\n\r\n1. Now Hugh and the stranger had not gone much further, when they met a\r\ncompany of soldiers, gayly dressed, with feathers in their caps, and\r\nglittering muskets on their shoulders. In front marched the drummers and\r\nfifers, making such merry music that Hugh would gladly have followed them\r\nto the end of the world. If he were only a soldier, he said to himself,\r\nold Mr. Toil would never venture to look him in the face.\r\n\r\n2. "Quickstep! forward! march!" shouted a gruff voice.\r\n\r\n3. Little Hugh started in great dismay; for this voice sounded precisely\r\nlike that which he had heard every day in Mr. Toil\'s schoolroom. And\r\nturning his eyes to the captain of the company, what should he see but the\r\nvery image of old Mr. Toil himself, in an officer\'s dress, to be sure, but\r\nlooking as ugly and disagreeable as ever.\r\n\r\n4. "This is certainly old Mr. Toil," said Hugh, in a trembling voice. "Let\r\nus away, for fear he should make us enlist in his company."\r\n\r\n5. "You are mistaken again, my little friend," replied the stranger very\r\ncomposedly. "This is only a brother of Mr. Toil\'s, who has served in the\r\narmy all his life. You and I need not be afraid of him."\r\n\r\n6. "Well, well," said Hugh, "if you please, sir, I don\'t want to see the\r\nsoldiers any more." So the child and the stranger resumed their journey;\r\nand, after awhile, they came to a house by the roadside, where a number of\r\nyoung men and rosy-cheeked girls, with smiles on their faces, were dancing\r\nto the sound of a fiddle.\r\n\r\n7. "Oh, let us stop here," cried Hugh; "Mr. Toil will never dare to show\r\nhis face where there is a fiddler, and where people are dancing and making\r\nmerry."\r\n\r\n8. But the words had scarcely died away on the little boy\'s tongue, when,\r\nhappening to cast his eyes on the fiddler, whom should he behold again but\r\nthe likeness of Mr. Toil, armed with a fiddle bow this time, and\r\nflourishing it with as much ease and dexterity as if he had been a fiddler\r\nall his life.\r\n\r\n9. "Oh, dear me!" whispered he, turning pale; "it seems as if there were\r\nnobody but Mr. Toil in the world."\r\n\r\n10. "This is not your old schoolmaster," observed the stranger, "but\r\nanother brother of his, who has learned to be a fiddler. He is ashamed of\r\nhis family, and generally calls himself Master Pleasure; but his real name\r\nis Toil, and those who know him best think him still more disagreeable\r\nthan his brothers."\r\n\r\n11. "Pray, let us go on," said Hugh.\r\n\r\n12. Well, thus the two went wandering along the highway and in shady lanes\r\nand through pleasant villages, and wherever they went, behold! there was\r\nthe image of old Mr. Toil. If they entered a house, he sat in the parlor;\r\nif they peeped into the kitchen, he was there! He made himself at home in\r\nevery cottage, and stole, under one disguise or another, into the most\r\nsplendid mansions. Everywhere they stumbled on some of the old\r\nschoolmaster\'s innumerable brothers.\r\n\r\n13. At length, little Hugh found himself completely worn out with running\r\naway from Mr. Toil. "Take me back! take me back!" cried the poor fellow,\r\nbursting into tears. "If there is nothing but Toil all the world over, I\r\nmay just as well go back to the schoolhouse."\r\n\r\n14. "Yonder it is; there is the schoolhouse!" said the stranger; for\r\nthough he and little Hugh had taken a great many steps, they had traveled\r\nin a circle instead of a straight line. "Come, we will go back to the\r\nschool together."\r\n\r\n15. There was something in his companion\'s voice that little Hugh now\r\nremembered; and it is strange that he had not remembered it sooner.\r\nLooking up into his face, behold! there again was the likeness of old Mr.\r\nToil, so that the poor child had been in company with Toil all day, even\r\nwhile he had been doing his best to run away from him.\r\n\r\n16. Little Hugh Idle, however, had learned a good lesson, and from that\r\ntime forward was diligent at his task, because he now knew that diligence\r\nis not a whit more toilsome than sport or idleness. And when he became\r\nbetter acquainted with Mr. Toil, he began to think his ways were not so\r\ndisagreeable, and that the old schoolmaster\'s smile of approbation made\r\nhis face sometimes appear almost as pleasant as even that of Hugh\'s\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--l. Ven\'ture, to dare, to risk. 3. Dis-may\', fright, terror.\r\nPre-cise\'ly, exactly. 4. En-list\', to put one\'s name on a roll, to join.\r\n5. Com-pos\'ed-ly, calmly, quietly. 6. Re--sumed\', recommenced. 10.\r\nOb-served\', remarked. 12. In-nu\'mer--a-ble, not to be counted. 16.\r\nAp-pro-ba\'tion, the act of regarding with pleasure.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXERCISES.--To whose school was Hugh Idle sent?

(227)\r\n\r\nAdapted from "Roughing it in the Bush," a story by Mrs. Susanna Moodie\r\n(sister of Agnes Strickland), who was born in Suffolk, England, in 1803.\r\nShe died in 1885.\r\n\r\n1. The day was sultry, and towards noon a strong wind sprang up that\r\nroared in the pine tops like the dashing of distant billows, but without\r\nin the least degree abating the heat. The children were lying listlessly\r\nupon the floor, and the girl and I were finishing sunbonnets, when Mary\r\nsuddenly exclaimed, "Bless us, mistress, what a smoke!"\r\n\r\n2. I ran immediately to the door, but was not able to distinguish ten\r\nyards before me. The swamp immediately below us was on fire, and the heavy\r\nwind was driving a dense black cloud of smoke directly towards us.\r\n\r\n3. "What can this mean?" I cried. "Who can have set fire to the fallow?"\r\nAs I ceased speaking, John Thomas stood pale and trembling before me.\r\n"John, what is the meaning of this fire?"\r\n\r\n4. "Oh, ma\'am, I hope you will forgive me; it was I set fire to it, and I\r\nwould give all I have in the world if I had not done it."\r\n\r\n5. "What is the danger?"\r\n\r\n6. "Oh, I\'m afraid that we shall all be burnt up," said John, beginning to\r\nwhimper. "What shall we do?"\r\n\r\n7. "Why, we must get out of it as fast as we can, and leave the house to\r\nits fate."\r\n\r\n8. "We can\'t get out," said the man, in a low, hollow tone, which seemed\r\nthe concentration of fear; "I would have got out of it if I could; but\r\njust step to the back door, ma\'am, and see."\r\n\r\n9. Behind, before, on every side, we were surrounded by a wall of fire,\r\nburning furiously within a hundred yards of us, and cutting off all\r\npossibility of retreat; for, could we have found an opening through the\r\nburning heaps, we could not have seen our way through the dense canopy of\r\nsmoke; and, buried as we were in the heart of the forest, no one could\r\ndiscover our situation till we were beyond the reach of help.\r\n\r\n10. I closed the door, and went back to the parlor. Fear was knocking\r\nloudly at my heart, for our utter helplessness destroyed all hope of our\r\nbeing able to effect our escape. The girl sat upon the floor by the\r\nchildren, who, unconscious of the peril that hung over them, had both\r\nfallen asleep. She was silently weeping; while the boy who had caused the\r\nmischief was crying aloud.\r\n\r\n11. A strange calm succeeded my first alarm. I sat down upon the step of\r\nthe door, and watched the awful scene in silence. The fire was raging in\r\nthe cedar swamp immediately below the ridge on which the house stood, and\r\nit presented a spectacle truly appalling.\r\n\r\n12. From out of the dense folds of a canopy of black smoke--the blackest I\r\never saw--leaped up red forks of lurid flame as high as the tree tops,\r\nigniting the branches of a group of tall pines that had been left for saw\r\nlogs. A deep gloom blotted out the heavens from our sight. The air was\r\nfilled with fiery particles, which floated even to the doorstep--while the\r\ncrackling and roaring of the flames might have been heard at a great\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\n13. To reach the shore of the lake, we must pass through the burning\r\nswamp, and not a bird could pass over it with unscorched wings. The fierce\r\nwind drove the flames at the sides and back of the house up the clearing;\r\nand our passage to the road or to the forest, on the right and left, was\r\nentirely obstructed by a sea of flames. Our only ark of safety was the\r\nhouse, so long as it remained untouched by the fire.\r\n\r\n14. I turned to young Thomas, and asked him how long he thought that would\r\nhe. "When the fire clears this little ridge in front, ma\'am. The Lord have\r\nmercy on us then, or we must all go."\r\n\r\n15. I threw myself down on the floor beside my children, and pressed them\r\nto my heart, while inwardly I thanked God that they were asleep,\r\nunconscious of danger, and unable by their cries to distract our attention\r\nfrom adopting any plan which might offer to effect their escape.\r\n\r\n16. The heat soon became suffocating. We were parched with thirst, and\r\nthere was not a drop of water in the house, and none to be procured nearer\r\nthan the lake. I turned once more to the door, hoping that a passage might\r\nhave been burnt through to the water. I saw nothing but a dense cloud of\r\nfire and smoke--could hear nothing but the crackling and roaring of\r\nflames, which was gaining so fast upon us that I felt their scorching\r\nbreath in my face.\r\n\r\n17. "Ah," thought I--and it was a most bitter thought--"what will my\r\nbeloved husband say when he returns and finds that his poor wife and his\r\ndear girls have perished in this miserable manner? But God can save us\r\nyet."\r\n\r\n18. The thought had scarcely found a voice in my heart before the wind\r\nrose to a hurricane, scattering the flames on all sides into a tempest of\r\nburning billows. I buried my head in my apron, for I thought that all was\r\nlost, when a most terrific crash of thunder burst over our heads, and,\r\nlike the breaking of a waterspout, down came the rushing torrent of rain\r\nwhich had been pent up for so many weeks.\r\n\r\n19. In a few minutes the chip yard was all afloat, and the fire\r\neffectually checked. The storm which, unnoticed by us, had been gathering\r\nall day, and which was the only one of any note we had that summer,\r\ncontinued to rage all night, and before morning had quite subdued the\r\ncruel enemy whose approach we had viewed with such dread.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.-l.

A waste of land, a sodden plain,\r\n     A lurid sunset sky,\r\n   With clouds that fled and faded fast\r\n     In ghostly phantasy;\r\n   A field upturned by trampling feet,\r\n     A field uppiled with slain,\r\n   With horse and rider blent in death\r\n     Upon the battle plain.\r\n\r\n2. The dying and the dead lie low;\r\n     For them, no more shall rise\r\n   The evening moon, nor midnight stars,\r\n     Nor day light\'s soft surprise:\r\n   They will not wake to tenderest call,\r\n     Nor see again each home,\r\n   Where waiting hearts shall throb and break,\r\n     When this day\'s tidings come.\r\n\r\n3. Two soldiers, lying as they fell\r\n     Upon the reddened clay--\r\n   In daytime, foes; at night, in peace\r\n     Breathing their lives away!\r\n   Brave hearts had stirred each manly breast;\r\n     Fate only, made them foes;\r\n   And lying, dying, side by side,\r\n     A softened feeling rose.\r\n\r\n4. "Our time is short," one faint voice said;\r\n     "To-day we\'ve done our best\r\n   On different sides: what matters now?\r\n     To-morrow we shall rest!\r\n   Life lies behind. I might not care\r\n     For only my own sake;\r\n   But far away are other hearts,\r\n     That this day\'s work will break.\r\n\r\n5. "Among New Hampshire\'s snowy hills,\r\n     There pray for me to-night\r\n   A woman, and a little girl\r\n     With hair like golden light;"\r\n   And at the thought, broke forth, at last,\r\n     The cry of anguish wild,\r\n   That would not longer be repressed\r\n     "O God, my wife, my child!"\r\n\r\n6. "And," said the other dying man,\r\n     "Across the Georgia plain,\r\n   There watch and wait for me loved ones\r\n     I ne\'er shall see again:\r\n   A little girl, with dark, bright eyes,\r\n     Each day waits at the door;\r\n   Her father\'s step, her father\'s kiss,\r\n     Will never greet her more.\r\n\r\n7. "To-day we sought each other\'s lives:\r\n     Death levels all that now;\r\n   For soon before God\'s mercy seat\r\n     Together we shall bow.\r\n   Forgive each other while we may;\r\n     Life\'s but a weary game,\r\n   And, right or wrong, the morning sun\r\n     Will find us, dead, the same."\r\n\r\n8. The dying lips the pardon breathe;\r\n     The dying hands entwine;\r\n   The last ray fades, and over all\r\n     The stars from heaven shine;\r\n   And the little girl with golden hair,\r\n     And one with dark eyes bright,\r\n   On Hampshire\'s hills, and Georgia\'s plain,\r\n     Were fatherless that night!\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--l.

(233)\r\n\r\nFrom "The History of the United Netherlands," by John Lothrop Motley, who\r\nwas born in 1814, at Dorchester, Mass. He graduated at Harvard in 1831,\r\nand afterwards lived many years In Europe, writing the histories which\r\nmade him famous. He died in 1877.\r\n\r\n1. On the evening of the 10th of August, 1589, there was a wedding feast\r\nin one of the splendid mansions of the stately city. The festivities were\r\nprolonged until deep in the midsummer\'s night, and harp and viol were\r\nstill inspiring the feet of the dancers, when on a sudden, in the midst of\r\nthe holiday groups, appeared the grim visage of Martin Schenk, the man who\r\nnever smiled.\r\n\r\n2. Clad in no wedding garment, but in armor of proof, with morion on head,\r\nand sword in hand, the great freebooter strode heavily through the\r\nballroom, followed by a party of those terrible musketeers who never gave\r\nor asked for quarter, while the affrighted revelers fluttered away before\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n3. Taking advantage of a dark night, he had just dropped down the river\r\nfrom his castle, with five and twenty barges, had landed with his most\r\ntrusted soldiers in the foremost vessels, had battered down the gate of\r\nSt. Anthony, and surprised and slain the guard.\r\n\r\n4. Without waiting for the rest of his boats, he had then stolen with his\r\ncomrades through the silent streets, and torn away the latticework, and\r\nother slight defenses on the rear of the house which they had now entered,\r\nand through which they intended to possess themselves of the market place.\r\n\r\n5. Martin had long since selected this mansion as a proper position for\r\nhis enterprise, but he had not been bidden to the wedding, and was\r\nsomewhat disconcerted when he found himself on the festive scene which he\r\nhad so grimly interrupted.\r\n\r\n6. Some of the merrymakers escaped from the house, and proceeded to alarm\r\nthe town; while Schenk hastily fortified his position, and took possession\r\nof the square. But the burghers and garrison were soon on foot, and he was\r\ndriven back into the house.\r\n\r\n7. Three times he recovered the square by main strength of his own arm,\r\nseconded by the handful of men whom he had brought with him, and three\r\ntimes he was beaten back by overwhelming numbers into the wedding mansion.\r\n\r\n8. The arrival of the greater part of his followers, with whose assistance\r\nhe could easily have mastered the city in the first moments of surprise,\r\nwas mysteriously delayed. He could not account for their prolonged\r\nabsence, and was meanwhile supported only by those who had arrived with\r\nhim in the foremost barges.\r\n\r\n9. The truth--of which he was ignorant--was, that the remainder of the\r\nflotilla, borne along by the strong and deep current of the Waal, then in\r\na state of freshet, had shot past the landing place, and had ever since\r\nbeen vainly struggling against wind and tide to force their way back to\r\nthe necessary point.\r\n\r\n10. Meantime Schenk and his followers fought desperately in the market\r\nplace, and desperately in the house which he had seized. But a whole\r\ngarrison, and a town full of citizens in arms proved too much for him, and\r\nhe was now hotly besieged in the mansion, and at last driven forth into\r\nthe streets.\r\n\r\n11. By this time day was dawning, the whole population, soldiers and\r\nburghers, men, women, and children, were thronging about the little band\r\nof marauders, and assailing them with every weapon and every missile to be\r\nfound. Schenk fought with his usual ferocity, but at last the musketeers,\r\nin spite of his indignant commands, began rapidly to retreat toward the\r\nquay.\r\n\r\n12. In vain Martin stormed and cursed, in vain with his own hand he struck\r\nmore than one of his soldiers dead. He was swept along with the\r\npanic-stricken band, and when, shouting and gnashing his teeth with\r\nfrenzy, he reached the quay at last, he saw at a glance why his great\r\nenterprise had failed.\r\n\r\n13. The few empty barges of his own party were moored at the steps; the\r\nrest were half a mile off, contending hopelessly against the swollen and\r\nrapid Waal. Schenk, desperately wounded, was left almost alone upon the\r\nwharf, for his routed followers had plunged helter-skelter into the boats,\r\nseveral of which, overladen in the panic, sank at once, leaving the\r\nsoldiers to drown or struggle with the waves.\r\n\r\n14. The game was lost. Nothing was left the freebooter but retreat.\r\nReluctantly turning his back on his enemies, now in full cry close behind\r\nhim, Schenk sprang into the last remaining boat just pushing from the\r\nquay. Already overladen, it foundered with his additional weight, and\r\nMartin Schenk, encumbered with his heavy armor, sank at once to the bottom\r\nof the Waal.\r\n\r\n15. Some of the fugitives succeeded in swimming down the stream, and were\r\npicked up by their comrades in the barges below the town, and so made\r\ntheir escape. Many were drowned with their captain. A few days afterward,\r\nthe inhabitants of Nymwegen fished up the body of the famous partisan. He\r\nwas easily recognized by his armor, and by his truculent face, still\r\nwearing the scowl with which he had last rebuked his followers.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--2. Mo\'ri-on, a kind of helmet.

BRANDYWINE FORD. (239)\r\n\r\nBayard Taylor was born at Kennett Square, Penn., in 1825. He received a\r\nlimited school education, but at an early age displayed great energy and\r\ntalent. He was a great traveler, and a fluent, graceful writer, both of\r\nprose and verse. Mr. Taylor held high official positions under the\r\ngovernment. The following selection is adapted from "The Story of\r\nKennett," He died in 1878.\r\n\r\n1. The black, dreary night, seemed interminable. He could only guess, here\r\nand there, at a landmark, and was forced to rely more upon Roger\'s\r\ninstinct of the road than upon the guidance of his senses. Toward\r\nmidnight, as he judged, by the solitary crow of a cock, the rain almost\r\nentirely ceased.\r\n\r\n2. The wind began to blow sharp and keen, and the hard vault of the sky to\r\nlift a little. He fancied that the hills on his right had fallen away, and\r\nthat the horizon was suddenly depressed towards the north. Roger\'s feet\r\nbegan to splash in constantly deepening water, and presently a roar,\r\ndistinct from that of the wind, filled the air.\r\n\r\n3. It was the Brandywine. The stream had overflowed its broad meadow\r\nbottoms, and was running high and fierce beyond its main channel. The\r\nturbid waters made a dim, dusky gleam around him; soon the fences\r\ndisappeared, and the flood reached to his horse\'s body.\r\n\r\n4. But he knew that the ford could be distinguished by the break in the\r\nfringe of timber; moreover, that the creek bank was a little higher than\r\nthe meadows behind it, and so far, at least, he might venture. The ford\r\nwas not more than twenty yards across, and he could trust Roger to swim\r\nthat distance.\r\n\r\n5. The faithful animal pressed bravely on, but Gilbert soon noticed that\r\nhe seemed at fault. The swift water had forced him out of the road, and he\r\nstopped from time to time, as if anxious and uneasy. The timber could now\r\nbe discerned, only a short distance in advance, and in a few minutes they\r\nwould gain the bank.\r\n\r\n6. What was that? A strange, rustling, hissing sound, as of cattle\r\ntrampling through dry reeds,--a sound which quivered and shook, even in\r\nthe breath of the hurrying wind! Roger snorted, stood still, and trembled\r\nin every limb; and a sensation of awe and terror struck a chill through\r\nGilbert\'s heart. The sound drew swiftly nearer, and became a wild,\r\nseething roar, filling the whole breadth of the valley.\r\n\r\n7. "The dam! the dam!" cried Gilbert, "the dam has given way!" He turned\r\nRoger\'s head, gave him the rein, struck, spurred, cheered, and shouted.\r\nThe brave beast struggled through the impeding flood, but the advance wave\r\nof the coming inundation already touched his side. He staggered; a line of\r\nchurning foam bore down upon them, the terrible roar was all around and\r\nover them, and horse and rider were whirled away.\r\n\r\n8. What happened during the first few seconds, Gilbert could never\r\ndistinctly recall. Now they were whelmed in the water, now riding its\r\ncareering tide, torn through the tops of brushwood, jostled by floating\r\nlogs and timbers of the dam, but always, as it seemed, remorselessly held\r\nin the heart of the tumult and the ruin.\r\n\r\n[Transcriber\'s Footnote: careering--Path or course, as the moon through\r\nthe sky.]\r\n\r\n9. He saw at last that they had fallen behind the furious onset of the\r\nflood, but Roger was still swimming with it, desperately throwing up his\r\nhead from time to time, and snorting the water from his nostrils. All his\r\nefforts to gain a foothold failed; his strength was nearly spent, and\r\nunless some help should come in a few minutes it would come in vain. And\r\nin the darkness, and the rapidity with which they were borne along, how\r\nshould help come?\r\n\r\n10. All at once Roger\'s course stopped. He became an obstacle to the\r\nflood, which pressed him against some other obstacle below, and rushed\r\nover horse and rider. Thrusting out his hand, Gilbert felt the rough bark\r\nof a tree. Leaning towards it, and clasping the log in his arms, he drew\r\nhimself from the saddle, while Roger, freed from his burden, struggled\r\ninto the current and instantly disappeared. 11. As nearly as Gilbert could\r\nascertain, several timbers, thrown over each other, had lodged, probably\r\nupon a rocky islet in the stream, the uppermost one projecting slantingly\r\nout of the flood. It required all his strength to resist the current which\r\nsucked, and whirled, and tugged at his body, and to climb high enough to\r\nescape its force, without overbalancing his support. At last, though still\r\nhalf immerged, he found himself comparatively safe for a time, yet as far\r\nas ever from a final rescue.\r\n\r\n12. Yet a new danger now assailed him, from the increasing cold. There was\r\nalready a sting of frost, a breath of ice, in the wind. In another hour\r\nthe sky was nearly swept bare of clouds, and he could note the lapse of\r\nthe night by the sinking of the moon. But he was by this time hardly in a\r\ncondition to note anything more.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--1. In-ter\'mi-na-ble, endless. 2. De-pressed\', low-ered. 3.\r\nTur\'bid, muddy. 5. Dis-cerncd\' (pro. diz-zerned\'), made out,\r\ndistinguished. 6. Seeth\'ing, boiling, bubbling. 7. Im-ped\'ing, hindering,\r\nobstucting. In-un-da\'tion, a flood. 9. On\'set, a rushing upon, attack. 11.\r\nIm-merged\', plunged under a liquid. 12. Lapse, a gradual passing away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXVI. BRANDYWINE FORD. (Concluded.) (242)\r\n\r\n1. The moon was low in the west, and there was a pale glimmer of the\r\ncoming dawn in the sky, when Gilbert Potter suddenly raised his head.\r\nAbove the noise of the water and the whistle of the wind, he heard a\r\nfamiliar sound,--the shrill, sharp neigh of a horse. Lifting himself with\r\ngreat exertion, to a sitting posture, he saw two men, on horseback, in the\r\nflooded meadow, a little below him. They stopped, seemed to consult, and\r\npresently drew nearer.\r\n\r\n2. Gilbert tried to shout, but the muscles of his throat were stiff, and\r\nhis lungs refused to act. The horse neighed again. This time there was no\r\nmistake; it was Roger that he heard! Voice came to him, and he cried\r\naloud,--a hoarse, strange, unnatural cry.\r\n\r\nThe horsemen heard it, and rapidly pushed up the bank, until they reached\r\na point directly opposite to him. The prospect of escape brought a thrill\r\nof life to his frame; he looked around and saw that the flood had indeed\r\nfallen.\r\n\r\n3. "We have no rope," he heard one of the men say. "How shall we reach\r\nhim?"\r\n\r\n"There is no time to get one now," the other answered. "My horse is\r\nstronger than yours. I\'ll go into the creek just below, where it\'s broader\r\nand not so deep, and work my way up to him,"\r\n\r\n"But one horse can\'t carry both."\r\n\r\n"His will follow, be sure, when it sees me."\r\n\r\n4. As the last speaker moved away, Gilbert saw a led horse plunging\r\nthrough the water beside the other. It was a difficult and dangerous\r\nundertaking. The horseman and the loose horse entered the main stream\r\nbelow, where its divided channel met and broadened, but it was still above\r\nthe saddle girths, and very swift.\r\n\r\n5. Sometimes the animals plunged, losing their foothold; nevertheless,\r\nthey gallantly breasted the current, and inch by inch worked their way to\r\na point about six feet below Gilbert. It seemed impossible to approach\r\nnearer.\r\n\r\n"Can you swim?" asked the man.\r\n\r\nGilbert shook his head. "Throw me the end of Roger\'s bridle!" he then\r\ncried.\r\n\r\n6. The man unbuckled the bridle and threw it, keeping the end of the rein\r\nin his hand. Gilbert tried to grasp it, but his hands were too numb. He\r\nmanaged, however, to get one arm and his head through the opening, and\r\nrelaxed his hold on the log.\r\n\r\n7. A plunge, and the man had him by the collar. He felt himself lifted by\r\na strong arm and laid across Roger\'s saddle. With his failing strength and\r\nstiff limbs, it was no slight task to get into place; and the return,\r\nthough less laborious to the horses, was equally dangerous, because\r\nGilbert was scarcely able to support himself without help.\r\n\r\n"You\'re safe now," said the man, when they reached the bank, "but it\'s a\r\ndownright mercy of God that you\'re alive!"\r\n\r\n8. The other horseman joined them, and they rode slowly across the flooded\r\nmeadow. They had both thrown their cloaks around Gilbert, and carefully\r\nsteadied him in the saddle, one on each side. He was too much exhausted to\r\nask how they had found him, or whither they were taking him,--too numb\r\nfor curiosity, almost for gratitude.\r\n\r\n9. "Here\'s your savior!" said one of the men, patting Roger\'s shoulder.\r\n"It was through him that we found you. Do you wish to know how?\r\nWell--about three o\'clock it was, maybe a little earlier, maybe a little\r\nlater, my wife woke me up. \'Do you hear that?\' she said.\r\n\r\n10. "I listened and heard a horse in the lane before the door,\r\nneighing,--I can\'t tell you exactly how it was,--as though he would call\r\nup the house. It was rather queer, I thought, so I got up and looked out\r\nof the window, and it seemed to me he had a saddle on. He stamped, and\r\npawed, and then he gave another neigh, and stamped again.\r\n\r\n11. "Said I to my wife, \'There is something wrong here,\' and I dressed and\r\nwent out. When he saw me, he acted in the strangest way you ever saw;\r\nthought I, if ever an animal wanted to speak, that animal does. When I\r\ntried to catch him, he shot off, ran down the lane a bit, and then came\r\nback acting as strangely as ever.\r\n\r\n12. "I went into the house and woke up my brother, here, and we saddled\r\nour horses and started. Away went yours ahead, stopping every minute to\r\nlook around and see if we followed. When we came to the water I rather\r\nhesitated, but it was of no use; the horse would have us go on and on,\r\ntill we found you. I never heard of such a thing before, in all my life."\r\nGilbert did not speak, but two large tears slowly gathered in his eyes,\r\nand rolled down his cheeks. The men saw his emotion, and respected it.\r\n\r\n13. In the light of the cold, keen dawn, they reached a snug farmhouse, a\r\nmile from the Brandywine. The men lifted Gilbert from the saddle, and\r\nwould have carried him immediately into the house, but he first leaned\r\nupon Roger\'s neck, took the faithful creature\'s head in his arms, and\r\nkissed it.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--2. Pros\'pect, ground or reason for hoping, antic-ipation. 5.\r\nBreast\'ed (pro. brest\'ed), opposed courageously. 6. Numb, without the\r\npower of feeling or motion. Re-laxed\', loosened. 12. E-mo\'tion, excited\r\nfeeling, agitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXVII. THE BEST CAPITAL (245)\r\n\r\nLouisa May Alcott was born at Germantown, Pa., in 1833, and, among other\r\nworks, wrote many beautiful stories for children. During the Civil War she\r\nwas a hospital nurse at Washington. The following selection is adapted\r\nfrom "Little Men." She died in 1888.\r\n\r\n1. One would have said that modest John Brooke, in his busy, quiet, humble\r\nlife, had had little time to make friends; but now they seemed to start up\r\neverywhere,--old and young, rich and poor, high and low; for all\r\nunconsciously his influence had made itself widely felt, his virtues were\r\nremembered, and his hidden charities rose up to bless him.\r\n\r\n2. The group about his coffin was a far more eloquent eulogy than any that\r\nman could utter. There were the rich men whom he had served faithfully for\r\nyears; the poor old women whom he cherished with his little store, in\r\nmemory of his mother; the wife to whom he had given such happiness that\r\ndeath could not mar it utterly; the brothers and sisters in whose hearts\r\nhe had made a place forever; the little son and daughter who already felt\r\nthe loss of his strong arm and tender voice; the young children, sobbing\r\nfor their kindest playmate, and the tall lads, watching with softened\r\nfaces a scene which they never could forget.\r\n\r\n3. That evening, as the Plumfield boys sat on the steps, as usual, in the\r\nmild September moonlight, they naturally fell to talking of the event of\r\nthe day.\r\n\r\nEmil began by breaking out in his impetuous way, "Uncle Fritz is the\r\nwisest, and Uncle Laurie the jolliest, but Uncle John was the best; and\r\nI\'d rather be like him than any man I ever saw."\r\n\r\n4. "So would I. Did you hear what those gentlemen said to Grandpa to-day?\r\nI would like to have that said of me when I was dead;" and Franz felt with\r\nregret that he had not appreciated Uncle John enough.\r\n\r\n"What did they say?" asked Jack, who had been much impressed by the scenes\r\nof the day.\r\n\r\n5. "Why, one of the partners of Mr. Laurence, where Uncle John has been\r\never so long, was saying that he was conscientious almost to a fault as a\r\nbusiness man, and above reproach in all things. Another gentleman said no\r\nmoney could repay the fidelity and honesty with which Uncle John had\r\nserved him, and then Grandpa told them the best of all.\r\n\r\n6. "Uncle John once had a place in the office of a man who cheated, and\r\nwhen this man wanted uncle to help him do it, uncle wouldn\'t, though he\r\nwas offered a big salary. The man was angry, and said, \'You will never get\r\non in business with such strict principles;\' and uncle answered back, \'I\r\nnever will try to get on without them,\' and left the place for a much\r\nharder and poorer one."\r\n\r\n7. "Good !" cried several of the boys warmly, for they were in the mood to\r\nunderstand and value the little story as never before.\r\n\r\n"He wasn\'t rich, was he?" asked Jack.\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"He never did anything to make a stir in the world, did he?"\r\n\r\n"No."\r\n\r\n"He was only good?"\r\n\r\n"That\'s all;" and Franz found himself wishing that Uncle John had done\r\nsomething to boast of, for it was evident that Jack was disappointed by\r\nhis replies.\r\n\r\n8. "Only good. That is all and everything," said Uncle Fritz, who had\r\noverheard the last few words, and guessed what was going on in the minds\r\nof the lads.\r\n\r\n"Let me tell you a little about John Brooke, and you will see why men\r\nhonor him, and why he was satisfied to be good rather than rich or famous.\r\nHe simply did his duty in all things, and did it so cheerfully, so\r\nfaithfully, that it kept him patient, brave, and happy, through poverty\r\nand loneliness and years of hard work.\r\n\r\n9. "He was a good son, and gave up his own plans to stay and live with his\r\nmother while she needed him. He was a good friend, and taught your Uncle\r\nLaurie much beside his Greek and Latin, did it unconsciously, perhaps, by\r\nshowing him an example of an upright man.\r\n\r\n10. "He was a faithful servant, and made himself so valuable to those who\r\nemployed him that they will find it hard to fill his place. He was a good\r\nhusband and father, so tender, wise, and thoughtful, that Laurie and I\r\nlearned much of him, and only knew how well he loved his family when we\r\ndiscovered all he had done for them, unsuspected and unassisted."\r\n\r\n11. Uncle Fritz stopped a minute, and the boys sat like statues in the\r\nmoonlight until he went on again, in a subdued and earnest voice: "As he\r\nlay dying, I said to him, \'Have no care for your wife and the little ones;\r\nI will see that they never want.\' Then he smiled and pressed my hand, and\r\nanswered, in his cheerful way, \'No need of that; I have cared for them.\'\r\n\r\n12. "And so he had, for when we looked among his papers, all was in\r\norder,--not a debt remained; and safely put away was enough to keep his\r\nwife comfortable and independent. Then we knew why he had lived so\r\nplainly, denied himself so many pleasures, except that of charity, and\r\nworked so hard that I fear he shortened his good life.\r\n\r\n13. "He never asked help for himself, though often for others, but bore\r\nhis own burden and worked out his own task bravely and quietly. No one can\r\nsay a word of complaint against him, so just and generous and kind was he;\r\nand now, when he is gone, all find so much to love and praise and honor,\r\nthat I am proud to have been his friend, and would rather leave my\r\nchildren the legacy he leaves his than the largest fortune ever made.\r\n\r\n14. "Yes! simple, genuine goodness is the best capital to found the\r\nbusiness of this life upon. It lasts when fame and money fail, and is the\r\nonly riches we can take out of this world with us. Remember that, my boys;\r\nand, if you want to earn respect and confidence and love, follow in the\r\nfootsteps of John Brooke."\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--2.

THE INCHCAPE ROCK.\r\n\r\nRobert Southey was a celebrated English poet, born 1774, who once held the\r\nhonorable position of poet laureate. He wrote a great deal both in prose\r\nand verse. He died in 1843.\r\n\r\n1. No stir in the air, no stir in the sea,\r\n   The ship was as still as she could be,\r\n   Her sails from heaven received no motion,\r\n   Her keel was steady in the ocean.\r\n\r\n2. Without either sign or sound of their shock\r\n   The waves flowed over the Inchcape Rock;\r\n   So little they rose, so little they fell,\r\n   They did not move the Inchcape Bell.\r\n\r\n3. The good old Abbot of Aberbrothok\r\n   Had placed that bell on the lnchcape Rock;\r\n   On a buoy in the storm it floated and swung,\r\n   And over the waves its warning rung.\r\n\r\n4. When the Rock was hid by the surges\' swell,\r\n   The mariners heard the warning bell;\r\n   And then they knew the perilous Rock,\r\n   And blest the Abbot of Aberbrothok.\r\n\r\n5. The sun in heaven was shining gay,\r\n   All things were joyful on that day;\r\n   The sea birds screamed as they wheeled round,\r\n   And there was joyance in their sound.\r\n\r\n6. The buoy of the Inchcape Bell was seen\r\n   A darker speck on the ocean green;\r\n   Sir Ralph the Rover walked his deck,\r\n   And he fixed his eye on the darker speck.\r\n\r\n7. He felt the cheering power of spring,\r\n   It made him whistle, it made him sing;\r\n   His heart was mirthful to excess,\r\n   But the Rover\'s mirth was wickedness.\r\n\r\n8. His eye was on the Inchcape float;\r\n   Quoth he, "My men put out the boat,\r\n   And row me to the Inchcape Rock,\r\n   And I\'ll plague the Abbot of Aberbrothok."\r\n\r\n9. The boat is lowered, the boatmen row,\r\n   And to the Inchcape Rock they go;\r\n   Sir Ralph bent over from the boat,\r\n   And he cut the bell from the Inchcape float.\r\n\r\n10. Down sunk the bell, with a gurgling sound,\r\n    The bubbles rose and burst around;\r\n    Quoth Sir Ralph, "The next who comes to the Rock,\r\n    Won\'t bless the Abbot of Aberbrothok."\r\n\r\n11. Sir Ralph the Rover sailed away,\r\n    He scoured the seas for many a day;\r\n    And now grown rich with plundered store,\r\n    He steers his course for Scotland\'s shore.\r\n\r\n12. So thick a haze o\'erspreads the sky\r\n    They can not see the sun on high;\r\n    The wind hath blown a gale all day,\r\n    At evening it hath died away.\r\n\r\n13. On the deck the Rover takes his stand,\r\n    So dark it is they see no land.\r\n    Quoth Sir Ralph, "It will be lighter soon,\r\n    For there is the dawn of the rising moon."\r\n\r\n14. "Canst hear," said one, "the breakers roar?\r\n    For methinks we should be near the shore."\r\n    "Now where we are I can not tell,\r\n    But I wish I could hear the Inchcape Bell."\r\n\r\n15. They hear no sound, the swell is strong;\r\n    Though the wind hath fallen, they drift along,\r\n    Till the vessel strikes with a shivering shock:\r\n    Cried they, "It is the Inchcape Rock!"\r\n\r\n16. Sir Ralph the rover tore his hair,\r\n    He curst himself in his despair;\r\n    The waves rush in on every side,\r\n    The ship is sinking beneath the tide.\r\n\r\n17. But even in his dying fear\r\n    One dreadful sound could the Rover hear,\r\n    A sound as if with the Inchcape Bell\r\n    The fiends below were ringing his knell.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--l. Keel, the principal timber in a ship, extending from bow\r\nto stern, at the bottom. 3. Buoy (pro. bwoi) a float-ing mark to point out\r\nthe position of rocks, etc., beneath the water. 4.

The Inchcape Rock is at the entrance of the\r\nFrith of Tay, Scotland, about fifteen miles from shore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLXXXIX. MY MOTHER\'S GRAVE. (253)\r\n\r\n1. It was thirteen years since my mother\'s death, when, after a long\r\nabsence from my native village, I stood beside the sacred mound beneath\r\nwhich I had seen her buried. Since that mournful period, a great change\r\nhad come over me. My childish years had passed away, and with them my\r\nyouthful character. The world was altered, too; and as I stood at my\r\nmother\'s grave, I could hardly realize that I was the same thoughtless,\r\nhappy creature, whose checks she so often kissed in an excess of\r\ntenderness.\r\n\r\n2. But the varied events of thirteen years had not effaced the remembrance\r\nof that mother\'s smile. It seemed as if I had seen her but yesterday--as\r\nif the blessed sound of her well-remembered voice was in my ear. The gay\r\ndreams of my infancy and childhood were brought back so distinctly to my\r\nmind that, had it not been for one bitter recollection, the tears I shed\r\nwould have been gentle and refreshing.\r\n\r\n3. The circumstance may seem a trifling one, but the thought of it now\r\npains my heart; and I relate it, that those children who have parents to\r\nlove them may learn to value them as they ought. My mother had been ill a\r\nlong time, and I had become so accustomed to her pale face and weak voice,\r\nthat I was not frightened at them, as children usually are. At first, it\r\nis true, I sobbed violently; but when, day after day, I returned from\r\nschool, and found her the same, I began to believe she would always be\r\nspared to me; but they told me she would die.\r\n\r\n4. One day when I had lost my place in the class, I came home discouraged\r\nand fretful. I went to my mother\'s chamber. She was paler than usual, but\r\nshe met me with the same affectionate smile that always welcomed my\r\nreturn. Alas! when I look back through the lapse of thirteen years, I\r\nthink my heart must have been stone not to have been melted by it. She\r\nrequested me to go downstairs and bring her a glass of water. I pettishly\r\nasked her why she did not call a domestic to do it. With a look of mild\r\nreproach, which I shall never forget if I live to be a hundred years old,\r\nshe said, "Will not my daughter bring a glass of water for her poor, sick\r\nmother?"\r\n\r\n5. I went and brought her the water, but I did not do it kindly. Instead\r\nof smiling, and kissing her as I had been wont to do, I set the glass down\r\nvery quickly, and left the room. After playing a short time, I went to bed\r\nwithout bidding my mother good night; but when alone in my room, in\r\ndarkness and silence, I remembered how pale she looked, and how her voice\r\ntrembled when she said, "Will not my daughter bring a glass of water for\r\nher poor, sick mother?" I could not sleep. I stole into her chamber to ask\r\nforgiveness. She had sunk into an easy slumber, and they told me I must\r\nnot waken her.\r\n\r\n6. I did not tell anyone what troubled me, but stole back to my bed,\r\nresolved to rise early in the morning and tell her how sorry I was for my\r\nconduct. The sun was shining brightly when I awoke, and, hurrying on my\r\nclothes, I hastened to my mother\'s chamber. She was dead! She never spoke\r\nmore--never smiled upon me again; and when I touched the hand that used to\r\nrest upon my head in blessing, it was so cold that it made me start.\r\n\r\n7. I bowed down by her side, and sobbed in the bitterness of my heart. I\r\nthen wished that I might die, and be buried with her; and, old as I now\r\nam, I would give worlds, were they mine to give, could my mother but have\r\nlived to tell me she forgave my childish ingratitude. But I can not call\r\nher back; and when I stand by her grave, and whenever I think of her\r\nmanifold kindness, the memory of that reproachful look she gave me will\r\nbite like a serpent and sting like an adder.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nXC. A MOTHER\'S GIFT-THE BIBLE. (255)\r\n\r\n1. Remember, love, who gave thee this,\r\n     When other days shall come,\r\n   When she who had thine earliest kiss,\r\n     Sleeps in her narrow home.\r\n   Remember! \'twas a mother gave\r\n   The gift to one she\'d die to save!\r\n\r\n2. That mother sought a pledge of love,\r\n     The holiest for her son,\r\n   And from the gifts of God above,\r\n     She chose a goodly one;\r\n   She chose for her beloved boy,\r\n     The source of light, and life, and joy.\r\n\r\n3. She bade him keep the gift, that, when\r\n     The parting hour should come,\r\n   They might have hope to meet again\r\n     In an eternal home.\r\n   She said his faith in this would be\r\n     Sweet incense to her memory.\r\n\r\n4. And should the scoffer, in his pride,\r\n     Laugh that fond faith to scorn,\r\n   And bid him cast the pledge aside,\r\n     That he from youth had borne,\r\n   She bade him pause, and ask his breast\r\n     If SHE or HE had loved him best.\r\n\r\n5. A parent\'s blessing on her son\r\n     Goes with this holy thing;\r\n   The love that would retain the one,\r\n     Must to the other cling.\r\n   Remember! \'tis no idle toy:\r\n     A mother\'s gift! remember, boy.\r\n\r\nDEFINITIONS.--2. Pledge, proof, evidence. 3. In\'cense, some-thing offered\r\nin honor of anyone. Faith, belief  4. Scoff\'er, one who laughs at what is\r\ngood.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of McGuffey\'s Fourth Eclectic Reader\r\nby William Holmes McGuffey\r\n\r\n*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK MCGUFFEY\'S FOURTH ECLECTIC READER ***\r\n\r\n***** This file should be named 14880.txt or 14880.zip *****\r\nThis and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n        http://www.gutenberg.net/1/4/8/8/14880/\r\n\r\nProduced by Don Kostuch\r\n\r\nUpdated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\nwill be renamed.\r\n\r\nCreating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\none owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\npermission and without paying copyright royalties.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
