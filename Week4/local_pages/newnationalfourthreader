Nothing being done\r\nfor the learner that he could do for himself.\r\n\r\n_Directions for Reading_, which accompany the lessons--specific in their\r\ntreatment and not of that general character which young teachers and\r\npupils are unable to apply.\r\n\r\n_All new words of special difficulty, at the heads of the lessons_,\r\nhaving their syllabication, accent, and pronunciation indicated\r\naccording to Webster. Other new words are placed in a vocabulary at the\r\nclose of the book.\r\n\r\n_The type of this book, like that of the previous books of the series,\r\nis much larger than that generally used_, for a single reason. Parents,\r\nevery-where, are complaining that the eye-sight of their children is\r\nbeing ruined by reading from small, condensed type. It is confidently\r\nexpected that this large, clear style will obviate such unfortunate\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n_The illustrations have been prepared regardless of expense_, and will\r\ncommend themselves to every person of taste and refinement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSONS IN PROSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n 1.--"I\'M GOING TO" (Part I) _Charlotte Daly_.\r\n\r\n 2.--"I\'M GOING TO" (Part II) _Charlotte Daly_.\r\n\r\n 3.--THE BEAN AND THE STONE\r\n\r\n 5.--AN ADVENTURE WITH DUSKY WOLVES (I) _Mayne Reid_.\r\n\r\n 6.--AN ADVENTURE WITH DUSKY WOLVES (II) _Mayne Reid_.\r\n\r\n 7.--THE SAILOR CAT _David Ker_.\r\n\r\n 9.--THE LION\r\n\r\n10.--ADVENTURE WITH A LION _Livingstone_.\r\n\r\n11.--THE NOBLEST DEED OF ALL\r\n\r\n13.--THE STORY OF INDIAN SPRING (I) _Aunt Mary_.\r\n\r\n14.--THE STORY OF INDIAN SPRING (II)\r\n\r\n15.--AN ADVENTURE WITH A SHARK\r\n\r\n17.--A FUNNY HORSESHOE "_Christian Union_."\r\n\r\n18.--THE GIRAFFE\r\n\r\n19.--THE TRADER\'S TRICK\r\n\r\n21.--ALI, THE CAMEL DRIVER (I)\r\n\r\n22.--ALI, THE CAMEL DRIVER (II)\r\n\r\n23.--A QUEER PEOPLE\r\n\r\n25.--WATER\r\n\r\n26.--THE HIDDEN TREASURE (I)\r\n\r\n27.--THE HIDDEN TREASURE (II)\r\n\r\n28.--THE HIDDEN TREASURE (III)\r\n\r\n30.--AIR _J.

Houghton, Mifflin & Co., the\r\nCentury Co., Roberts Brothers, and Charles Scribner\'s Sons, for\r\npermission to use and adapt some of their valuable copyright matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSUGGESTIONS\r\n\r\nTo Teachers\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following suggestions are submitted for the benefit of young\r\nteachers.\r\n\r\nIn order that pupils may learn how to define words at the heads of the\r\nlessons, let the teacher read the sentences containing such words and\r\nhave pupils copy them upon slate or paper.\r\n\r\nThen indicate what words are to be defined, and insist upon the proper\r\nsyllabication, accent, marking of letters, etc.\r\n\r\nIn this way the pupil learns the meaning of the word as it is used, and\r\nnot an abstract definition that may be meaningless.\r\n\r\nHave pupils study their reading lessons carefully before coming to\r\nrecitation.\r\n\r\nThe position of pupils while reading should be erect, easy, and\r\ngraceful.\r\n\r\nGive special attention to the subject of articulation, and insist upon a\r\nclear and distinct enunciation.\r\n\r\nIn order to develop a clear tone of voice, let pupils practice, in\r\nconcert, upon some of the open vowel sounds, using such words as _arm,\r\nall, old_.\r\n\r\nIn this exercise, the force of utterance should be gentle at first, and\r\nthe words repeated a number of times; then the force should be increased\r\nby degrees, until "calling tones" are used.\r\n\r\nEncourage a natural use of the voice, with such modulations as may be\r\nproper for a correct rendering of the thoughts which are read.\r\n\r\nIt should, be remembered that the development of a good tone of voice is\r\nthe result of careful and constant practice.\r\n\r\nConcert reading is recommended as a useful exercise, inasmuch as any\r\nfeeling of restraint or timidity disappears while reading with others.\r\n\r\nQuestion individual pupils upon the manner in which lessons should be\r\nread. In this way they will learn to think for themselves.\r\n\r\nDo not interrupt a pupil while reading until a thought or sentence is\r\ncompleted, since such a course tends to make reading mechanical and\r\ndeprive it of expression.\r\n\r\nErrors in time, force of utterance, emphasis, and inflection should be\r\ncarefully corrected, and then the passage read over again.\r\n\r\nThe "Directions for Reading" throughout the book are intended to be\r\nsuggestive rather than exhaustive, and can be added to as occasion\r\nrequires.\r\n\r\nThe "Language Lessons" in this book, should not be neglected. They\r\ncontain only such matter as is necessary to meet the requirements of\r\npupils.\r\n\r\nWords and expressions not readily understood, must be made intelligible\r\nto pupils. This has been done in part by definitions, and in part by\r\ninterpreting some of the difficult phrases.\r\n\r\nAfter the habit of acquiring the usual meaning has been formed, the\r\noriginal meaning of those words which are made up of stems modified by\r\nprefixes or affixes should be shown.\r\n\r\nThe real meaning of such words can be understood far better by a study\r\nof their formation, than by abstract definitions. It will be found,\r\nalso, that pupils readily become interested in this kind of work.\r\n\r\nAs the capabilities of classes of the same grade will differ, it may\r\nsometimes occur that a greater amount of language work can be done\r\neffectively than is laid down in this book. When this happens, more time\r\ncan be devoted to such special kinds of work as the needs of the classes\r\nsuggest.\r\n\r\nConstant drill upon the analysis of lessons, varied at times by the\r\nanalysis of short stories taken from other sources and read to the\r\nclass, will develop the reasoning faculties of pupils and render the\r\nwriting of original compositions a comparatively easy exercise.\r\n\r\nEncourage the habit of self-reliance on the part of pupils. Original\r\ninvestigation, even if followed at first by somewhat crude results, is\r\nin the end more satisfactory than any other course.\r\n\r\nThe Definitions (pages 373-382) and the List of Proper Names (pages\r\n383 and 384) may be used in the preparation of the lessons.[01]\r\n\r\nWhen exercises are written, particular care should be required in regard\r\nto penmanship, correct spelling, punctuation, and neatness.\r\n\r\n\r\n[01] "The Definitions" are found at the end of the text, however "the\r\nList of Proper Names" has not been included in this production.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPHONIC CHART.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVOWELS.\r\n\r\n\r\na as in  lake\r\na "  "   at\r\na "  "   far\r\na "  "   all\r\na "  "   care\r\na "  "   ask\r\na as in  what\r\ne "  "   be\r\ne "  "   let\r\ni "  "   ice\r\ni "  "   in\r\no "  "   so\r\no as in  box\r\nu  "  "  use\r\nu  "  "  up\r\nu  "  "  fur\r\noo "  "  too\r\noo "  "  look\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIPHTHONGS.\r\n\r\n\r\noi, oy (unmarked), as in oil, boy\r\nou, ow     "       "  "  out, now\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSONANTS\r\n\r\n\r\n b  as in bad\r\n d  "  "  do\r\n f  "  "  fox\r\n g  "  "  go\r\n h  "  "  he\r\n j  "  "  just\r\n k  "  "  kite\r\n l  "  "  let\r\n m  as in me\r\n n  "  "  no\r\n p  "  "  put\r\n r  "  "  rat\r\n s  "  "  so\r\n t  "  "  too\r\n v  "  "  very\r\n w  "  "  we\r\n y  as in yes\r\n z  "  "  froze\r\nng  "  "  sing\r\nch  "  "  chick\r\nsh  "  "  she\r\nth  "  "  think\r\nth  "  "  the\r\nwh(hw),"  what\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEQUIVALENTS.\r\n\r\nVOWELS.\r\n\r\n\r\na    like o  as in what\r\ne     "   a  "  "  where\r\ne     "   a  "  "  they\r\ne     "   u  "  "  her\r\ni     "   u  "  "  girl\r\ni     "   e  "  "  police\r\no, u like oo as in to, rule\r\no     "   u  "  "  come\r\no     "   a  "  "  for\r\nu, o  "   oo "  "  put, could\r\ny     "   i  "  "  by\r\ny     "   i  "  "  kit\'ty\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSONANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nc like  s    as in   race\r\nc  "    k    "  "    cat\r\ng  "    j    "  "    cage\r\nn like ng    as in   think\r\ns  "    z    "  "    has\r\nx  "   ks, or gz "   box, exist\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOURTH READER\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON I\r\n\r\n\r\nspokes\'man, _one who speaks for others_.\r\n\r\ncho\'rus, _a number of speakers or singers_.\r\n\r\napt, _likely; ready_.\r\n\r\nfolks, _people; family_.\r\n\r\nmis\'er a ble, _very unhappy; very poor_.\r\n\r\nlone\'some, _without friends; lonely_.\r\n\r\nscore, _twenty_.\r\n\r\nwretch\'ed, _unhappy; very sad_.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"I\'M GOING TO."\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce upon a time, there was a little boy, whose name was Johnny.\r\n"Johnny," said his mamma, one day, "will you bring me an armful of\r\nwood?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Johnny, "I\'m going to"; but just then he heard Carlo, the\r\ndog, barking at a chipmunk over in the meadow, so he ran off as fast as\r\nhe could go.\r\n\r\nNow this was not the first time that Johnny had said to his mamma, "Yes,\r\nI\'m going to." He never thought of that wood again until about\r\ndinner-time, when he began to feel hungry.\r\n\r\nWhen he got back, he found that dinner was over, and papa and mamma had\r\ngone to ride. He found a piece of bread and butter, and sat down on a\r\nLarge rock, with his back against the stump of a tree, to eat it.\r\n\r\nWhen it was all gone, Johnny began to think what he should do next. He\r\nclosed his eyes as people are apt to do when they think.\r\n\r\nPresently he heard a score of voices about him. One was saying, "Wait a\r\nbit"; another, "Pretty soon"; another, "In a minute"; another, "By and\r\nby"; and still another, louder than the rest, kept screaming as loud as\r\nit could, "Going to, going to, going to," till Johnny thought they were\r\ncrazy.\r\n\r\n"Who in the world are you?" said he, in great surprise, "and what are\r\nyou making such a noise about?"\r\n\r\n"We are telling our names," said they; "didn\'t you ask us to tell our\r\nnames?"\r\n\r\n"No," said Johnny, "I didn\'t."\r\n\r\n"O what a story!" cried they all in a breath.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"Let\'s shake him for it," said one.\r\n\r\n"No, let us carry him to the king," said another.\r\n\r\nSo they began to spin about him like so many spiders; for each one of\r\nthem carried a long web, and when that gets wound around a boy or a\r\ngirl, it is a very difficult thing to get rid of.\r\n\r\nIn a few minutes they had him all wound up--hands and feet, nose and\r\neyes, all tied up tight. Then they took him among them, and flew away\r\nwith him, miles and miles, over the hills, and up to a big cave in the\r\nmountain. There he heard ever so many more voices, and it was noisier\r\nthan ever.\r\n\r\n"Where am I?" he said, as soon as he could speak.\r\n\r\n"O you\'re safe at home," answered Wait-a-bit, for he seemed to be the\r\nspokesman; "and they have been expecting you for some time."\r\n\r\n"This isn\'t my home," said Johnny, feeling very miserable and beginning\r\nto cry.\r\n\r\n"O yes, it is," said a chorus of voices. "This is just where such folks\r\nas you belong. There are many of your fellows here, and you won\'t be\r\nlonesome a bit."\r\n\r\nThey had begun to unwind the web from his eyes now, so he opened them\r\nand looked about him. O what a wretched place it was!\r\n\r\nAgainst the sides of the cave, stood long rows of boys and girls, with\r\nvery sorry faces, all of them saying over as fast as they could speak,\r\n"Going to, going to!" "Wait a bit, wait a bit!" "Pretty soon, pretty\r\nsoon!" "In a minute, in a minute!" studying the names just as hard as if\r\nthey were lessons.\r\n\r\nThere were Delays, and Tardys, and Put-offs, with ever so many more; and\r\nin a corner by themselves, and looking more unhappy than all the rest,\r\nwere the poor little fellows whose names were "Too late."\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDirections for Reading.--Pupils should read loud enough for all the\r\nclass to hear them.\r\n\r\nThe words forming a _quotation_ should usually be spoken in a louder\r\ntone than the other words in the lesson, as--\r\n\r\n_"Johnny,"_ said his mamma, one day, _"will you bring me an armful of\r\nwood?"_\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage Lesson.--Divide into syllables, accent, and mark the sounds\r\nof the letters in the following words: _Carlo, armful, mountain,\r\nunwind_.\r\n\r\nWhat two words can be used for each of the following: _I\'m, didn\'t,\r\nlet\'s, you\'re, isn\'t, won\'t?_\r\n\r\nWhat other words could be used instead of _got_ (page 16, line 4)?[02]\r\n\r\nProper names should begin with capital letters: as, _Johnny, Carlo_.\r\n\r\nGive three other words used as proper names in this lesson.\r\n\r\n\r\n[02] paragraph 4 of this lesson\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON II.\r\n\r\n\r\nde spair\', _loss of hope_.\r\n\r\npro cras\' ti na tor, _one who puts off doing any thing_.\r\n\r\nres o lu\'tions, _promises made to one\'s self; resolves_.\r\n\r\nyon\'der, _there; in that place_.\r\n\r\nmon\'strous, _of great size_.\r\n\r\ngi\'ant, _an unreal person, supposed to be of great size_.\r\n\r\nhor\'rid, _causing great fear or alarm_.\r\n\r\nex pect\'ed, _thought; looked for_.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"I\'M GOING TO."\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\n\r\n"O dear, dear! Where am I?" said Johnny in despair. "Please let me out!\r\nI want my mamma!"\r\n\r\n"No, you don\'t," said Wait-a-bit. "You don\'t care much about her, and\r\nthis is really where you belong. This is the kingdom of Procrastination,\r\nand yonder comes the king."\r\n\r\n"The kingdom of what?" said Johnny, who had never heard such a long word\r\nin his life before.\r\n\r\nBut just then he heard a heavy foot-fall, and a great voice that sounded\r\nlike a roar, saying, "Has he come? Did you get him?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, here he is," said Wait-a-bit, "and he\'d just been saying it a\r\nlittle while before we picked him up."\r\n\r\nJohnny looked up and saw a monstrous giant, with a bright green body and\r\nred legs, and a yellow head and two horrid coal-black eyes.\r\n\r\n"Let me have him," said the giant. So he took him up just as if he had\r\nbeen a rag-baby, and looked him all over, turning him from side to side,\r\nand from head to feet.\r\n\r\nO but Johnny was frightened, and expected every moment to be swallowed!\r\n\r\n"Let\'s see," said the giant; "he always says \'Pretty soon.\' No, that\r\nisn\'t it. What is it, my fine fellow, that you always say to your mamma\r\nwhen she asks you to do any thing for her?\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t \'Pretty soon,\' nor \'In a minute.\' What is it? They all mean\r\nabout the same thing, to be sure, and bring every body to me in the end;\r\nbut I must know exactly, or I can\'t put you in the right place."\r\n\r\nJohnny hung his head, and did not want to tell; but an extra hard poke\r\nof the giant\'s big finger made him open his mouth and say with shame,\r\nthat he always said, "I\'m going to."\r\n\r\n"O that\'s it!" said the giant. "Well, then, you stand there."\r\n\r\nSo he unwound a bit of the web from his fingers--just enough so that he\r\ncould hold the Procrastinator\'s Primer--and stood him at the end of a\r\nlong row of children, who were saying over and over again, just as fast\r\nas they could speak, "Going to, going to, going to, going to," just\r\nthat, and nothing else in the world.\r\n\r\nJohnny was tired and hungry by this time, and longed to see his mamma,\r\nthinking that, if he could only get back: to her, he would always mind\r\nthe very moment she told him to do any thing.\r\n\r\nHe made a great many good resolutions while he stood there. At last the\r\ngiant called him to come and say his lesson.\r\n\r\n"You shall have a short one to-day," said he, "and need say it only a\r\nthousand times, because it is your first day here. To-morrow, you must\r\nsay it a million."\r\n\r\nJohnny tried to step forward, but the web was still about his feet, so\r\nhe fell with, a bang to the floor.\r\n\r\nJust then he opened his eyes to find that he had rolled from the rock\r\nto the grass, and that mamma was calling him in a loud voice to come to\r\nsupper, and this time he didn\'t say, "I\'m going to."\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDirections for Reading.--The words in quotation marks should be read in\r\nthe same manner as in Lesson I.\r\n\r\nRead words in dark type in the following sentences with more force than\r\nthe other words:\r\n\r\n    "Has he _come?_ Did you _get_ him?"\r\n\r\nWords that are read more forcibly than other words in a sentence are\r\ncalled _emphatic words_.\r\n\r\nWhich are the _emphatic words_ in the following sentences?\r\n\r\n    "You shall have a short one to-day."\r\n\r\n    "I must know exactly."\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage Lesson.--Divide into syllables, accent, and mark the sounds\r\nof the letters in the following words: _extra, primer, moment,\r\ncoal-black_.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON III.\r\n\r\n\r\nremark\'able, _worthy of notice; unusual_.\r\n\r\nmoist\'ure, _wetness; that which makes wet_.\r\n\r\nabsorbed\', _sucked up; drunk up_.\r\n\r\nwith\'er, _lose freshness_.\r\n\r\nstarched, _stiffened, as starch_.\r\n\r\ngerm, _that from which the plant grows; bud_.\r\n\r\nhand\'some, _pleasing in appearance; very pretty_.\r\n\r\nclasped, _surrounded; inclosed_.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEAN AND THE STONE.\r\n\r\n\r\n"I think I ought to be doing something in the world!" said a little\r\nvoice out in the garden.\r\n\r\n"Pray, what can you do?" asked another and somewhat stronger voice.\r\n\r\n"I think I can grow," answered the little voice.\r\n\r\nIf you had seen the owner of the little voice, perhaps you would not\r\nhave thought him any thing remarkable.\r\n\r\nIt is true he had on a clean white coat, so smooth and shining that it\r\nlooked as if it had been newly starched and ironed, and inside of this,\r\nhe hugged two stout packages.\r\n\r\nThe coat had only one fastening; but that fastening extended down the\r\nback, and was a curious thing to see.\r\n\r\nIt looked just as if the coat had been cut with a knife, and had\r\nafterward grown together again. It was like a scar on your hand; and a\r\nscar it is called.\r\n\r\n"Yes, I ought to be growing," said the little voice, "for I am a bean,\r\nand in the spring a bean ought to grow."\r\n\r\nNow you know how the coat came by its scar, for the scar was the spot\r\nwhich showed where the bean had been broken from the pod.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean by growing?" said the other voice, which came from a\r\nlarge red stone.\r\n\r\n"Why," said the bean, "don\'t you know what growing means? I thought\r\nevery thing knew how to grow. You see, when I grow, my root goes down\r\ninto the soil to get moisture, and my stem goes up into the light to\r\nfind heat. Heat and moisture are my food and drink.\r\n\r\n"By and by, I shall be a full-grown plant, and that is wonderful! In the\r\nground, my roots will travel far and wide.\r\n\r\n"In the air, how happy my stem will be! I shall learn a great deal, and\r\nsee beautiful things every day. O how I long for that time to come!"\r\n\r\n"What you say is very strange," said the red stone. "Here I have been in\r\nthis same place for many years, and I have not grown at all. I have no\r\nroot; I have no stem; or, if I have, they never move upward nor\r\ndownward, as you say. Are you sure you are not mistaken?"\r\n\r\n"Why, of course I\'m not mistaken," cried the bean. "I feel within myself\r\nthat I can grow; and I have absorbed so much moisture that I must soon\r\nbegin."\r\n\r\nJust then the bean\'s coat split from end to end, and for one or two\r\nminutes neither the stone nor the bean spoke. The stone was astonished,\r\nand the bean was a little frightened. However, he soon recovered his\r\ncourage.\r\n\r\n"There!" said he, showing the two packages he had been carrying; "these\r\nare my seed-leaves. In them is the food on which I intend to live when I\r\nbegin growing.\r\n\r\n"When my stem is strong enough to do without them, they will wither away.\r\nMy coat is all worn-out, too. I shall not need it any longer. Look\r\ninside the seed-leaves, and you will see the germ. Part of it is root,\r\nand part of it is stem. Do you see?"\r\n\r\n"I see two little white lumps," replied the stone; "but I can not\r\nunderstand how they will ever be a root and a stem."\r\n\r\n"I do believe you are a poor, dull mineral, after all," said the bean;\r\n"and if so, of course you can not understand what pleasure a vegetable\r\nhas in growing.\r\n\r\n"I wouldn\'t be a mineral for the world! I would not lie still and do\r\nnothing, year after year. I would rather spread my branches in the\r\nsunshine, and drink in the sweet spring air through my leaves."\r\n\r\n"What you say must be all nonsense," said the stone. "I can\'t understand\r\nit."\r\n\r\nBut the bean grew on without minding him. The roots pushed down into the\r\nsoil and drank up the moisture from the ground. Then this moisture went\r\ninto the stem, and the stem climbed bravely up into the light.\r\n\r\n"How happy I am!" cried the bean.\r\n\r\nIt ran over the red stone, and clasped it with long green branches,\r\ncovered with white bean flowers.\r\n\r\n"O indeed!" said the stone. "Is this what you call growing? I thought\r\nyou were only in fun. How handsome you are!"\r\n\r\n"May I hang my pods on you, so that they can ripen in the sun?" said the\r\nbean.\r\n\r\n"Certainly, friend," said the stone.\r\n\r\nHe was very polite, now that he saw the bean was a full-grown vine.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDirections for Reading.--Read in a conversational tone of voice, as in\r\nLessons I and II.\r\n\r\nWhat word is emphatic in the third paragraph?\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage Lesson.--Syllabify, accent, and mark sounds of letters in the\r\nwords, _broken, packages, courage, polite_.\r\n\r\nTell in your own words how the bean grew.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON IV.\r\n\r\n\r\nelf, _a very small person; an unreal being_.\r\n\r\nvex, _make angry; trouble_.\r\n\r\npon\'dered, _thought about with care_.\r\n\r\nstreak, _line; long mark_.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO-MORROW.\r\n\r\n\r\n  A bright little boy with laughing face,\r\n  Whose every motion was full of grace,\r\n  Who knew no trouble and feared no care,\r\n  Was the light of our household--the youngest there.\r\n\r\n  He was too young--this little elf--\r\n  With troublesome questions to vex himself;\r\n  But for many days a thought would rise,\r\n  And bring a shade to the dancing eyes.\r\n\r\n  He went to one whom he thought more wise\r\n  Than any other beneath the skies:\r\n  "Mother,"--O word that makes the home!--\r\n  "Tell me, when will to-morrow come?"\r\n\r\n  "It is almost night," the mother said,\r\n  "And time for my boy to be in bed;\r\n  When you wake up and it\'s day again,\r\n  It will be to-morrow, my darling, then."\r\n\r\n  The little boy slept through all the night,\r\n  But woke with the first red streak of light;\r\n  He pressed a kiss on his mother\'s brow,\r\n  And whispered, "Is it to-morrow now?"\r\n\r\n  "No, little Eddie, this is to-day;\r\n  To-morrow is always one night away."\r\n  He pondered awhile, but joys came fast,\r\n  And this vexing question quickly passed.\r\n\r\n  But it came again with the shades of night:\r\n  "Will it be to-morrow when it is light?"\r\n  From years to come, he seemed care to borrow,\r\n  He tried so hard to catch to-morrow.\r\n\r\n  "You can not catch it, my little Ted;\r\n  Enjoy to-day," the mother said;\r\n  "Some wait for to-morrow through many a year--\r\n  It always is coming, but never is here."\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDirections for Reading.--In reading poetry, pupils should notice the\r\nemphatic words, and give them proper force.\r\n\r\nExample.\r\n\r\n    "_Mother_,"--O word that makes the home!--\r\n\r\n    "_Tell_ me, when will _to-morrow_ come?"\r\n\r\nThe two dashes in the first line of the preceding example are used\r\ninstead of a parenthesis, and have the same value.\r\n\r\nWhen there is no pause at the end of a line (see first line, third\r\nstanza), it should be closely joined in reading to the line which\r\nfollows it, thus making the two lines read as one.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON V.\r\n\r\n\r\nap\'pe tite, _wish for food_.\r\n\r\na muse\'ment, _play; enjoyment_.\r\n\r\ngaunt, _lean; hungry looking_.\r\n\r\nspe\'cies, _kind_.\r\n\r\noc curred\', _took place; happened_.\r\n\r\nen cour\'age ment, _hope given by another\'s words or actions_.\r\n\r\ndi rec\'tion, _way; course_.\r\n\r\ndusk\'y, _very dark; almost black_.\r\n\r\nsin\'gu lar, _unusual; strange_.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ADVENTURE WITH DUSKY WOLVES.\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\n\r\n"During the summer and winter, we had several adventures in the\r\ntrapping and killing of wild animals. One of them was of such a\r\nsingular and dangerous kind, that you may feel interested in hearing\r\nit.\r\n\r\n"It occurred in the dead of winter, when there was snow upon the ground.\r\nThe lake was frozen over, and the ice was as smooth as glass. We spent\r\nmuch of our time in skating about over its surface, as the exercise\r\ngave us health and a good appetite.\r\n\r\n"Even Cudjo, our colored servant, had taken a fancy for this amusement,\r\nand was a very good skater. Frank was fonder of it than the rest of us,\r\nand was, in fact, the best skater among us.\r\n\r\n"One day, however, neither Cudjo nor I had gone out, but only Frank and\r\nHarry. The rest of us were busy at some carpenter work within doors.\r\n\r\n"We could hear the merry laugh of the boys, and the ring of their skates\r\nas they glided over the smooth ice. All at once, a cry reached our\r\nears, which we knew meant the presence of some danger.\r\n\r\n"\'O Robert!\' cried my wife, \'they have broken through the ice!\'\r\n\r\n"We all dropped what we held in our hands, and rushed to the door. I\r\nseized a rope as I ran, while Cudjo took his long spear, thinking it\r\nmight be of use to us. This was the work of a moment, and the next we\r\nwere outside the house.\r\n\r\n"What was our astonishment to see both the boys, away at the farthest\r\nend of the lake, but skating toward us as fast as they could!\r\n\r\n"At the same time, our eyes rested upon a terrible sight. Close behind\r\nthem upon the ice, and following at full gallop, was a pack of wolves!\r\n\r\n"They were not the small prairie wolves, which either of the boys might\r\nhave chased with a stick, but of a species known as the \'Great Dusky\r\nWolf\' of the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\n"There were six of them in all. Each of them was twice the size of the\r\nprairie wolf, and their long, dark bodies, gaunt with hunger, and\r\ncrested from head to tail with a high, bristling mane, gave them a most\r\nfearful appearance.\r\n\r\n"They ran with their ears set back and their jaws apart, so that we\r\ncould see their red tongues and white teeth.\r\n\r\n"We did not stop a moment, but rushed toward the lake. I threw down the\r\nrope, and seized hold of a large rail as I ran, while Cudjo hurried\r\nforward armed with a spear. My wife, with presence of mind, turned back\r\ninto the house for my rifle.\r\n\r\n"I saw that Harry was foremost, and that the fierce wolves were fast\r\nclosing upon Frank. This was strange, for we knew that Frank was by far\r\nthe better skater. We all called out to him, uttering loud shouts of\r\nencouragement. Both were bearing themselves manfully, but Frank was\r\nmost in danger.\r\n\r\n"The wolves were upon his heels! \'O they will kill him!\' I cried,\r\nexpecting the next moment to see him thrown down upon the ice. What was\r\nmy joy at seeing him suddenly wheel and dart off in a new direction."\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDirections for Reading.--This lesson should be read with spirit, and\r\nin a full, clear tone of voice.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage Lesson.--_Presence of mind_ is the power to act quickly when\r\nsudden danger threatens.\r\n\r\n_Upon his heels_ means very close to.\r\n\r\n_Dead of winter_ is the middle of winter, as that is supposed to be\r\nthe quietest or most lifeless time.\r\n\r\nSyllabify, accent, and mark sounds of letters in the following words:\r\n_fancy, gallop, prairie, bristling, rifle_.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON VI.\r\n\r\n\r\ne lud\'ed, _got away from; avoided_.\r\n\r\nex cit\'ing, _causing deep interest_.\r\n\r\nmarks\'man, _one who shoots well_.\r\n\r\nre treat\'ing, _going away from_.\r\n\r\nen a\'bled, _helped; made able_.\r\n\r\nsim\'i lar, _like; nearly the same_.\r\n\r\npur suit\', _following after_.\r\n\r\nnim\'bly, _with a quick motion_.\r\n\r\ncom menced\', _began_.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN ADVENTURE WITH DUSKY WOLVES.\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\n\r\n"The wolves, thus nimbly eluded, now kept on after Harry, who, in turn,\r\nbecame the object of our anxiety.\r\n\r\n"In a moment they were close upon him; but he, already warned by his\r\nbrother, wheeled in a similar manner, while the fierce brutes, swept\r\nalong by the force of their running, were carried a long distance upon\r\nthe ice before they could turn themselves.\r\n\r\n"Their long, bushy tails, however, soon enabled them to turn about and\r\nfollow in the new direction, and they galloped after Harry, who was now\r\nthe nearest to them.\r\n\r\n"Frank, in the meantime, had again turned, and came sweeping past behind\r\nthem, at the same time shouting loudly, as if to tempt them away from\r\ntheir pursuit of Harry.\r\n\r\n"They heeded him not, and again he changed his direction, and, as though\r\nhe was about to skate into their midst, followed the wolves.\r\n\r\n"This time he skated up close behind them, just at the moment when Harry\r\nhad turned again, and thus made his second escape.\r\n\r\n"At this moment, we heard Frank calling out to his brother to make for\r\nthe shore, while, instead of retreating himself, he stopped until Harry\r\nhad passed, and then dashed off, followed closely by the whole pack.\r\n\r\n"Another slight turn brought him nearly in our direction; but there was\r\na large hole broken through the ice close by the shore, and we saw\r\nthat, unless he turned again, he would skate into it.\r\n\r\n"We thought he was watching the wolves too intently to see it, and we\r\nshouted to warn him. Not so; he knew better than we what he was about.\r\n\r\n"When he had reached within a few feet of the hole, he wheeled sharply\r\nto the left, and came dashing up to the point where we stood to receive\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"The wolves, too intent upon their chase to see any thing else, went\r\nsweeping past the point where he had turned, and the next moment\r\nplunged through the broken ice into the water.\r\n\r\n"Then Cudjo and I ran forward, shouting loudly, and, with the heavy rail\r\nand the long spear, commenced dealing death among them.\r\n\r\n"It was but a short, though exciting scene. Five of them were speared\r\nand drowned, while the sixth crawled out upon the ice and was rapidly\r\nmaking off, frightened enough at his cold ducking.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"At that moment I heard the crack of a rifle and saw the wolf tumble\r\nover.\r\n\r\n"On turning round I saw Harry with, my rifle, which my wife had brought\r\ndown and handed to him, as a better marksman than herself.\r\n\r\n"The wolf, only wounded, was kicking furiously about on the ice; but\r\nCudjo now ran out, and, after a short struggle, finished the business\r\nwith his spear.\r\n\r\n"This was, indeed, a day of great excitement in our forest home. Frank,\r\nwho was the hero of the day, although he said nothing, was no doubt not\r\na little proud of his skating feat.\r\n\r\n"And well he might be, as, but for his skill, poor Harry would no doubt\r\nhave fallen a prey to the fierce wolves."\r\n\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage Lesson.--Let pupils use other words to express the meaning of\r\nwhat is given below in dark type.\r\n\r\n    Again he _changed his direction_.\r\n\r\n    He then _dashed off_.\r\n\r\n    He wheeled _sharply_ to the left.\r\n\r\n    Cudjo and I commenced _dealing death among them_.\r\n\r\n    Cudjo _finished the business_ with his spear.\r\n\r\n    Harry would have _fallen a prey to_ the fierce wolves.\r\n\r\nTell the story in your own words, using the points in the following\r\n\r\nAnalysis.--1.

She was very poor and thin, and her\r\nlittle furry coat was sadly soiled with dirt and grease.\r\n\r\nBut she had not lost all her fun, for she was making play with her tiny\r\nfore-paws at the ends of the sailor\'s red beard, to honest Jack\'s great\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\n"Where did you pick that up, Jack?" asked the third officer.\r\n\r\n"Well, your honor," said Jack Harmon, touching his cap with a grin,\r\n"seems to me she must have left her ship and gone to look for another,\r\nfor I found her tramping along the pier there, and mewing as if she was\r\ncalling out for somebody to show her the road.\r\n\r\n"So I thought that, as we have many rats aboard the old craft, she would\r\nbe able to pick up a good living there; and I called to her, and she\r\ncame at once, and here she is."\r\n\r\nHere she was, sure enough; and as Jack ended his story, she chimed in\r\nwith a plaintive little "Me-ow," which said, as plainly as ever any cat\r\nspoke yet, "I\'m very cold and hungry, and I do wish somebody would take\r\nme below and give me some food!"\r\n\r\nShe had not long to wait. Half an hour later she was the best-fed cat in\r\nthat part of New York City, and that night she lay snugly curled up with\r\na good warm blanket over her.\r\n\r\nOf course, the first thing to do with an adopted cat is to give it a\r\nname, and Jack Harmon, who was a bit of a wag in his way, and a great\r\nadmirer of the monster elephant which was just then making such a stir\r\nin New York, called his new pet "Jumbo."\r\n\r\nJumbo soon became the pet of the whole crew, and of the passengers, too,\r\nwhen they came on board, a few days later, for the voyage back to\r\nEngland.\r\n\r\nBefore we were half-way across the ocean, the bits of meat or cake, and\r\nbits of white bread soaked in milk, which were being constantly given\r\nher by one and another, had made her look as round as an apple.\r\n\r\nThe ladies were never tired of stroking her soft fur and admiring her\r\ndainty white paws, which were now as spotless as snow. The children\r\nromped all day with this new playmate, who seemed to enjoy the sport\r\nquite as much as themselves.\r\n\r\nBut Jumbo was not content with mere play. She seemed to think herself\r\nbound to do something to "work her passage." Whenever any of the crew\r\nwent aloft to take in sail, Jumbo would always climb up, too, as if to\r\nhelp them.\r\n\r\nJack Harmon was still her favorite, and whenever it came his turn to\r\nstand at the bow and keep watch, there was Jumbo going backward and\r\nforward.\r\n\r\nOn the eighth night of the voyage, the stars looked dim and\r\nwatery, and a low bank of clouds began to rise to windward of us, just\r\nbetween sea and sky.\r\n\r\nThe old sailors shook their heads and looked grave, as if they expected\r\nan unusual storm. Suddenly the wind began to blow strongly upon the\r\nstarboard quarter, stirring up a cross-sea which tossed the great ship\r\nlike a toy.\r\n\r\nNearly all the passengers had gone below, and the few who remained on\r\ndeck buttoned their water-proof coats, and held tightly on by any thing\r\nthey could seize.\r\n\r\nJack Harmon had shut up his cat below, but poor puss escaped somehow,\r\nfor all at once a shrill cry was heard, and there was Jumbo clinging to\r\na rail, with a great mountain of a wave coming right down upon her.\r\n\r\nSeveral men sprang toward the spot, but Jack was foremost, and he had\r\njust reached his little pet when down came the great wave upon them\r\nboth.\r\n\r\nInstantly the whole after-deck was one roaring, foaming waterfall, the\r\nflying spray of which blinded one for a moment. But when it cleared,\r\nthere stood our brave Jack--dripping, bruised, and bleeding from a cut\r\non the head.\r\n\r\nBut his little favorite was safe in his arms, and as he came back with\r\nher, such a cheer went up from all who were on deck, as the old ship had\r\nnot heard for many a day.\r\n\r\n"Let\'s send round the hat for him," said one of the passengers.\r\n\r\nAnd the hat was sent around, so successfully that Jack got enough money\r\nto give his poor old mother a happy Christmas, and still have something\r\nleft over for himself and Jumbo, who was his mother\'s pet ever after.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDirections for Reading.--Should this lesson be read with the same tone\r\nof voice as Lessons V. and VI.?\r\n\r\nIn the first paragraph, do not say _pier rin_ for _pier in; dir\' tand_\r\nfor _dirt and_.\r\n\r\nPoint out two other places in the lesson where mistakes similar to those\r\njust given might occur.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage Lesson.--Syllabify, accent, and mark the sounds of letters in\r\nthe following words: _cargo, officer, blanket, passengers, instantly,\r\nbleeding_.\r\n\r\n_Work her passage_ means to pay her fare by making herself useful.\r\n\r\nMake out an _analysis_ in six parts for this lesson, and use it in\r\ntelling the story in your own words.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON VIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nloi\'ter ing, _going slowly, lingering_.\r\n\r\npro tect\'or, _one who keeps another from harm_.\r\n\r\nthrong\'ing, _gathering in large numbers_.\r\n\r\nwrecked, _dashed to pieces_.\r\n\r\nthatched, _covered with straw or twigs_.\r\n\r\nbronzed, _brown, darked-colored_.\r\n\r\nbleach\'ing, _whitening_.\r\n\r\nvan\'ished, _gone out of sight; departed suddenly_.\r\n\r\nrapt\'ure, _great joy; delight_.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRESCUED.\r\n\r\n\r\n  "Little lad, slow wandering across the sands so yellow,\r\n  Leading safe a lassie small--O tell me, little fellow,\r\n  Whither go you, loitering in the summer weather,\r\n  Chattering like sweet-voiced birds on a bough together?"\r\n\r\n  "I am Robert, if you please, and this is Rose, my sister,\r\n  Youngest of us all"--he bent his curly head and kissed her,\r\n  "Every day we come and wait here till the sun is setting,\r\n  Watching for our father\'s ship, for mother dear is fretting.\r\n\r\n  "Long ago he sailed away, out of sight and hearing,\r\n  Straight across the bay he went, into sunset steering.\r\n  Every day we look for him, and hope for his returning,\r\n  Every night my mother keeps the candle for him burning.\r\n\r\n  "Summer goes, and winter comes, and spring returns but never\r\n  Father\'s step comes to the gate.

Nature has given him wonderful strength and beauty.\r\n\r\nHis body, when full grown, is only about seven feet long and less than\r\nfour feet high; but his large and shapely head, with its powerful jaws,\r\nhis glaring eye, and long, flowing mane, give him an air of majesty that\r\nshows him worthy of the name--"King of Beasts."\r\n\r\nYet we are told that a lion will not willingly attack man, unless first\r\nattacked himself or driven by hunger to forget his habits.\r\n\r\nOn meeting man suddenly, he will turn, retreat slowly for a short\r\ndistance, and then run away.\r\n\r\nThe lion belongs to the cat family, and his teeth and claws are similar\r\nin form and action to those of the house cat.\r\n\r\nHis food is the flesh of animals; and so great is his appetite, that it\r\nmust require several thousand other animals to supply one lion with food\r\nduring his life-time.\r\n\r\nHis strength is so enormous that he can crush the skull of an ox with a\r\nsingle blow of his powerful paw, and then grasp it in his jaws and bound\r\naway.\r\n\r\nUnless driven by hunger to bolder measures, he will hide in the bushes,\r\nor in the tall reeds along the banks of rivers, and spring suddenly upon\r\nthe unlucky animal that chances to come near him.\r\n\r\nMany lions have been captured, and their habits and appearance carefully\r\nstudied. Although there is a difference in color--some being of a\r\nyellowish brown, others of a deep red, and a few silvery gray--the\r\ngeneral form and appearance of all lions is the same.\r\n\r\nThe mane is of a dark brown, or of a dusky color, and the tail nearly\r\nthree feet long, with a bunch of hair at the tip.\r\n\r\nThe lioness, or female lion, is smaller in every way than the male and\r\nhas no mane.\r\n\r\nIt is in the night-time that the lion goes out from his den to seek for\r\nfood, and his color is so dark and his movements so silent, that his\r\npresence is not known even at the distance of a few yards.\r\n\r\nThese dangerous beasts are no longer found in Europe, although they\r\nlived there in numbers many hundred years ago. It is only in the deserts\r\nand rocky hills of Asia and Africa that they are met with.\r\n\r\nThose who have visited a menagerie, and have seen a lion within the\r\nlimits of a narrow iron cage, can form no idea of the majesty of the\r\nbrute when roaming about freely on his native soil.\r\n\r\nThe voice of the lion is loud and strong. It is likely to strike terror\r\nto the bravest heart.\r\n\r\n"It consists," says a well-known writer, "at times of a low, deep\r\nmoaning, repeated five or six times, and ending in scarcely audible\r\nsighs; at other times, the forest is startled with loud, deep-toned,\r\nsolemn roars, increasing in loudness to the third or fourth, and then\r\ndying away in sounds like distant thunder."\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDirections for Reading.--This lesson should be read a little more\r\nslowly than conversation.

The men circled the\r\nhill, and slowly edged in closer and closer, so that the lions might be\r\ncompletely surrounded.\r\n\r\n"Presently one of the natives spied a lion sitting on a piece of rock,\r\nand fired at him, the ball missing the beast and striking the rock.\r\n\r\n"The lion turned, bit like a dog at the spot where the bullet had\r\nstruck, and then bounded off to the shelter of the brushwood.\r\n\r\n"Soon I saw another lion in much the same situation as the former, and,\r\nbeing not more than thirty yards from it, let fly with both barrels.\r\n\r\n"As the lion was still on its legs, I hastened to reload my gun; but\r\nhearing a sudden and frightful cry from the natives, I looked up and\r\nsaw the wounded lion springing upon me.\r\n\r\n"I was caught by the shoulder and hurled to the ground. Growling\r\nterribly in my ear, the lion shook me as a dog does a rat.\r\n\r\n"The shock produced a stupor, similar to that which seems to be felt by\r\na mouse after the first shake of a cat.\r\n\r\n"The lion then leaped upon one of the natives who had tried to shoot at\r\nhim, and then sprang at the neck of a second native who, armed with a\r\nspear, was rushing to the rescue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"The exertion was too much for the wounded beast, and so, with his claws\r\nbedded in the spearman\'s shoulder, he rolled over and died.\r\n\r\n"I had escaped, but with a shoulder so broken as to need an artificial\r\njoint, and with eleven teeth wounds in my arm.\r\n\r\n"These wounds were less severe than they would have been, had not a\r\nheavy jacket which I had on, cleansed the teeth of the lion in their\r\npassage.

When this\r\nimportant business was thus finished, the father addressed the sons in\r\nthe following words:\r\n\r\n"My sons, there is one thing which I have not included in the share of\r\nany one of you. It is this costly diamond which you see in my hand. I\r\nwill give it to that one of you who shall earn it by the noblest deed.\r\n\r\n"Go, therefore, and travel for three months; at the end of that time,\r\nwe will meet here again, and you shall tell me what you have done."\r\n\r\nThe sons thereupon departed, and traveled for three months, each in a\r\ndifferent direction. At the end of that time they returned; and all came\r\ntogether to their father to give an account of their journey. The eldest\r\nson spoke first.\r\n\r\n"Father, on my journey a stranger entrusted to me a great number of\r\nvaluable jewels, without taking any account of them. Indeed, I was well\r\naware that he did not know how many the package contained.\r\n\r\n"One or two of them would never have been missed, and I might easily\r\nhave enriched myself without fear of detection. But I gave back the\r\npackage exactly as I had received it. Was not this a noble deed?"\r\n\r\n"My son," replied the father, "simple honesty cannot be called noble.\r\nYou did what was right, and nothing more. If you had acted otherwise,\r\nyou would have been dishonest, and your deed would have shamed you. You\r\nhave done well, but not nobly."\r\n\r\nThe second son now spoke. He said: "As I was riding along on my\r\njourney, I one day saw a poor child playing by the shore of a lake; and\r\njust as I rode by, it fell into the water, and was in danger of being\r\ndrowned.\r\n\r\n"I at once dismounted from my horse, and plunging into the water,\r\nbrought it safe to land. All the people of the village where this\r\nhappened will tell you that what I say is true. Was it not a noble\r\naction?"\r\n\r\n"My son," replied the old man, "you did only what was your duty. You\r\ncould hardly have left the child to die without exerting yourself to\r\nsave it. You, too, have acted well, but not nobly."\r\n\r\nThen the third son came forward to tell his tale. He said: "Father, I\r\nhad an enemy, who for years had done me much harm and tried to take my\r\nlife.\r\n\r\n"One evening during my journey, I was passing along a dangerous road\r\nwhich ran beside the summit of a cliff. As I rode along, my horse\r\nstarted at sight of something in the road.\r\n\r\n"I dismounted to see what it was, and found my enemy lying fast asleep\r\non the very edge of the cliff. The least movement in his sleep and he\r\nmust have rolled over and been dashed to pieces on the rocks below.\r\n\r\n"His life was in my hands. I drew him away from the edge and then woke\r\nhim, and told him to go on his way in peace."\r\n\r\nThen the old Persian cried out with great joy, "Dear son, the diamond is\r\nyours, for it is a noble and godlike thing to help an enemy and return\r\ngood for evil."\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDirections for Reading.--Read this lesson in a conversational tone of\r\nvoice, and somewhat more slowly than Lesson III.\r\n\r\nRead what is said by each one of the four different persons, as you\r\nthink each one of them would speak.\r\n\r\nHow would you read the third and fourth paragraphs?--the last paragraph?\r\n\r\nPoint out the _emphatic words_ in the last paragraph.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage Lesson.--Syllabify, accent, and mark sounds of letters in the\r\nfollowing words: _Persian, therefore, valuable, account, jewels, aware,\r\ncontained, dishonest, duty, enemy_.\r\n\r\nLet pupils use other words, to express the following:\r\n\r\n     To go on his way in peace.

There were five of us: father, mother, Mary, our dear nurse\r\nLizzie, and I.\r\n\r\n"Lizzie was a colored woman, who had lived with us a long time. She was\r\nvery handsome, and straight as an arrow. She was a few years older than\r\nmother.\r\n\r\n"Grandfather Thorpe, your great grandfather, boys, gave her to mother\r\nwhen she was married. Your grandfather was a miller. The old mill that\r\nI went to see to-day, was his. It was the first mill built in this part\r\nof Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n"O, this was a beautiful country! my eyes never were tired of looking\r\nout over these mountains and valleys. But I saw that mother\'s face was\r\ngetting thinner and whiter every day; they said she was homesick, and\r\nbefore we had been in the colony a year, a grave was made under an\r\nelm-tree close by, and that grave was mother\'s.\r\n\r\n"I thought my heart was broken then, but I soon forgot my sorrow: I\r\nstill had father, sister Mary, and Lizzie.\r\n\r\n"In this part of Pennsylvania at that time there were very few white\r\npeople, and besides our own, there was no other colony within ten\r\nmiles. But our people being so near together, and well armed, felt\r\nquite safe.\r\n\r\n"Ten miles away on the Susquehanna, was a small village established by a\r\ncolony from the north, which was used as a trading-post. There the\r\nfriendly Indians often came to trade.\r\n\r\n"Father went twice a year to this village to get supplies that came up\r\nthe river. He often spoke of Red Feather, an old Indian warrior. Father\r\nliked Red Feather, and he learned to trust him almost as he would have\r\ntrusted a white man.\r\n\r\n"Time passed on until I was thirteen years old, a tall, strong girl, and\r\nvery brave for a girl. I could shoot almost as well as father.\r\n\r\n"Little Mary was very quiet and shy, not like me at all. I loved\r\nfishing, and often went out hunting with father, but she staid at home\r\nwith Lizzie, or sat down under the trees by the spring, watching the\r\nshadow of the trees moving in it.\r\n\r\n"Our colony had by this time become quite prosperous. A good many of the\r\nsettlers had built houses for themselves more like those they had left\r\nbehind on the Delaware.\r\n\r\n"The spring that I was fourteen, father built this house. The mill had\r\nalready been grinding away for two years. We were very happy when we\r\nmoved out of our little log cabin into this pleasant house.\r\n\r\n"We had but little furniture, but we had plenty of room. Up to this\r\ntime, there had not been much trouble with the Indians, and though we\r\nhad often dreaded it, and lived in fear many days at a time, only four\r\nof our men had been killed by them.\r\n\r\n"We had trusted many of the friendly Indians, and Red Feather had\r\nfrequently spent days at our settlement. He seemed to like the mill.\r\n\r\n"I became quite attached to the old man; but Mary was always afraid of\r\nhim, and Lizzie kept her sharp eyes on him whenever he came into the\r\nhouse. She hated him, and he knew it.\r\n\r\n"One beautiful clear morning in August of that year, father went down to\r\nthe mill as usual. Lizzie was busy with her work, and little Mary was\r\nplaying with some tame doves, when looking up, I saw Lizzie start\r\nsuddenly.\r\n\r\n"She had seen something in the woods that frightened her. Without\r\nspeaking, she went to the door, closed and fastened it, then turned and\r\nlooked out of the window. She never told mo what she saw.\r\n\r\n"Father came home early that day; he looked anxious, and I knew that\r\nsomething troubled him. Without waiting to eat his supper, he went out,\r\nand very soon most of the men of the colony had gathered round him at\r\nthe spring."\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDirections for Reading.--With what tone of voice should this lesson be\r\nread?\r\n\r\nWhat other lessons before this, have been read with the same tone of\r\nvoice?\r\n\r\nName two _emphatic words_ in the following _exclamation_:\r\n\r\n    "O, this was a beautiful country!"\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage Lesson.--Change the _exclamation_ given above to a\r\n_statement_.

But a quiet night passed by and the sun shone\r\nagain over the hills in wonderful beauty.\r\n\r\n"Suddenly, there sounded from the forest a scream. I had never heard it\r\nbefore, but I knew it. It was the terrible war-whoop. Then all was\r\nconfusion and horror.\r\n\r\n"I saw Nanito, an Indian that I knew, who had eaten at our table. I saw\r\nhim strike down our father, while Lizzie fought to save him.\r\n\r\n"But it was no use, there was no mercy in the heart of the Indian. They\r\ncarried Lizzie away from us, and we never saw her again.\r\n\r\n"Poor little frightened Mary and I were tied together, our hands\r\nfastened behind us, and we were given, to--whom do you think,\r\nRobbie?--to Red Feather. Then I hated him, and resolved that I would\r\nkill him if I could.\r\n\r\n"After a while he took us out of the house, and then I saw that most of\r\nthe houses in the little village were burning. The women and children\r\nwere saved alive, but nearly all the men were killed.\r\n\r\n"I was very quiet, for I wanted my hands untied, and I thought perhaps\r\nRed Feather would pity me and unfasten them.\r\n\r\n"Little Mary was frightened nearly to death. She had not spoken since\r\nshe saw the Indian strike father down,--when she screamed and fell\r\nsenseless.\r\n\r\n"For a good while I thought she was dead. She had revived a great deal,\r\nbut had not spoken.\r\n\r\n"About sundown Red Feather led us down past the spring, out into the\r\nwoods, but not far away. We could still see the smoke rising from the\r\nburning houses. The Indians had gone some distance farther and camped\r\nwith the white prisoners.\r\n\r\n"Red Feather could speak English, so I told him if he would untie my\r\nhands, I would make his fire, and bake his corn cake for him.\r\n\r\n"He was old and feeble, and had lost much of his natural cunning. He\r\nknew me, and trusted me; so without speaking, he took his hunting knife\r\nfrom his belt, cut the cords, and I was free.\r\n\r\n"I took the hatchet that he gave me to cut some branches for a fire, and\r\nwent to work very meekly, with my head down.\r\n\r\n"I dared not speak to Mary, for fear he might see me, for his eyes were\r\nfixed on me every moment. I baked his corn cake in the ashes, and gave\r\nit to him. By this time it was dark, but the light from our fire shone\r\nfar out into the woods.\r\n\r\n"I noticed Red Feather did not watch me so closely, and his eyes would\r\nnow and then shut, for he was very tired.\r\n\r\n"He leaned forward to light his pipe in the ashes, when instantly,\r\nalmost without thinking, I seized the hatchet, and struck him with all\r\nmy might.\r\n\r\n"With a loud scream, I plunged into the woods toward home. Turning an\r\ninstant, I saw Mary spring up, totter, and fall. With another sharp\r\nreport came a twinge of pain in my side. Suddenly I fell, and in the\r\ndarkness of the woods, they passed on, leaving me stunned and nearly\r\ndead.\r\n\r\n"I will not tell you now, my dear Robbie, how I was cared for, and who\r\nbrought home little Mary and laid her to rest under the elm, beside\r\nmother--but the bullet that struck me then, I still carry in my side,\r\nand shall as long as I live.\r\n\r\n"Many years have passed since that terrible day, but I can never forget\r\nit. As long as the history of this country lasts, Indian Spring will be\r\nremembered, and other boys will listen, with eyes as wide open as\r\nyours, to the tale it has to tell."\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDirections for Reading.--Should the second or third paragraph of the\r\nlesson be read the faster?\r\n\r\nWhen do we speak more rapidly--in telling an exciting story, or in\r\ncommon conversation?\r\n\r\nDo our feelings guide us when we speak slowly or rapidly?--when, we\r\nspeak quietly or forcibly?\r\n\r\nPoint out three paragraphs in the lesson that you would read as slowly\r\nas Lesson XIII.; three that you would read more rapidly.\r\n\r\nIn reading rapidly, be careful not to omit syllables, and not to run\r\nwords together.

Toward the close of the day the sea-breeze died\r\naway, and hot, sultry breathings came from the great, sunburnt desert of\r\nSahara.\r\n\r\nHalf an hour before sundown, the captain gave the cheering order to call\r\nthe hands to "go in swimming"; and, in less than five minutes, the forms\r\nof our sailors were seen leaping from the arms of the lower yards into\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\nOne of the sails, with its corners fastened from the main yard-arm and\r\nthe swinging boom, had been lowered into the water, and into this most\r\nof the swimmers made their way.\r\n\r\nAmong those who seemed to be enjoying the sport most heartily were two\r\nboys, one of whom was the son of our old gunner; and, in a laughing\r\nmood, they started out from the sail on a race.\r\n\r\nThere was a loud ringing shout of joy on their lips as they put off;\r\nthey darted through the water like fishes. The surface of the sea was\r\nsmooth as glass, though its bosom rose in long, heavy swells that set in\r\nfrom the ocean.\r\n\r\nOne of the buoys which was attached to the anchor, to show where it lay,\r\nwas far away on the starboard quarter, where it rose and fell with the\r\nlazy swell of the waves.\r\n\r\nTowards this buoy the two lads made their way, the old gunner\'s son\r\ntaking the lead; but, when they were within about sixty yards of the\r\nbuoy, the other boy shot ahead and promised to win the race.\r\n\r\nThe old gunner had watched the progress of his son with great pride; and\r\nwhen he saw him drop behind, he leaped upon the quarter-deck, and was\r\njust upon the point of urging him on by a shout, when a cry was heard\r\nthat struck him with instant horror.\r\n\r\n"A shark! a shark!" shouted the officer of the deck; and, at the sound\r\nof those terrible words, the men who were in the water, leaped and\r\nplunged toward the ship.\r\n\r\nThree or four hundred yards away, the back of a monster shark was seen\r\ncleaving the water. Its course was for the boys.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the gunner stood like one who had lost his reason; then he\r\nshouted at the top of his voice for the boys to turn; but they heard him\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nStoutly the two swimmers strove, knowing nothing of the danger from the\r\nshark. Their merry laughter still rang over the waters, as they were\r\nboth nearing the buoy.\r\n\r\nO, what anxiety filled the heart of the gunner! A boat had put off, but\r\nhe knew it could not reach the boys in time to prevent the shark from\r\novertaking them.\r\n\r\nEvery moment he expected to see the monster sink from sight,--then he\r\nknew all hope would be gone. At this moment a cry was heard on board\r\nthe ship, that reached every heart,--the boys had discovered their\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nThe cry startled the old gunner, and, quicker than thought, he sprung\r\nfrom the quarter-deck. The guns were all loaded and shotted, fore and\r\naft, and none knew their temper better than he.\r\n\r\nWith steady hand, made strong by sudden hope, the old gunner pricked the\r\ncartridge of one of the quarter guns; then he took from his pocket a\r\npercussion cap, fixed it on its place, and set back the hammer of the\r\ngun-lock.\r\n\r\nWith great exertions, the old man turned the heavy gun to its bearing,\r\nand then seizing the string of the lock, he stood back and watched for\r\nthe next swell that would bring the shark in range. He had aimed the\r\npiece some distance ahead of his mark; but yet a moment would settle his\r\nhopes and fears.\r\n\r\nEvery breath was hushed, and every heart in that old ship beat\r\npainfully. The boat was yet some distance from the boys, while the\r\nhorrid sea-monster was fearfully near.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSuddenly the silence was broken by the roar of the gun; and, as the old\r\nman knew his shot was gone, he covered his face with his hands, as if\r\nafraid to see the result. If he had failed, he knew that his boy was\r\nlost.\r\n\r\nFor a moment after the report of the gun had died away upon the air,\r\nthere was an unbroken silence; but, as the thick smoke arose from the\r\nsurface of the water, there was, at first, a low murmur breaking from\r\nthe lips of the men,--that murmur grew louder and stronger, till it\r\nswelled to a joyous, deafening shout.\r\n\r\nThe old gunner sprung to his feet, and gazed off on the water, and the\r\nfirst thing that met his sight was the huge body of the shark floating\r\non its back, the shot aimed by him having instantly killed it.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments the boat reached the daring swimmers, and, greatly\r\nfrightened, they were brought on board. The old man clasped his boy in\r\nhis arms, and then, overcome by the powerful excitement, he leaned upon\r\na gun for support.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDirections for Reading.--What paragraphs should be read rapidly?

"It\'s a magnet."\r\n\r\n"Magnet! What\'s that?"\r\n\r\nCharlie turned it over in his hands, and pulled the bar a little. The\r\nbar slipped so that it hung only by a corner.\r\n\r\n"Never mind," I said, as he looked up with a scared expression. "It\r\nisn\'t broken. Put the bar back."\r\n\r\nCharlie put it back, and it sprung into place with a sharp click.\r\n\r\n"That\'s funny!" he cried again. "What made it jump so? And what makes it\r\nstick? It doesn\'t feel sticky."\r\n\r\n"We call it magnetism," I said. "Now, take hold of the bar, and see if\r\nyou can pull it straight off."\r\n\r\n"I can\'t. It sticks fast."\r\n\r\n"Pull harder."\r\n\r\nCharlie braced himself for a strong pull. Suddenly the bar came off, and\r\nhe went tumbling backward.\r\n\r\n"What did you say makes it hold so hard?" said he, getting up.\r\n\r\n"Magnetism," said I again.\r\n\r\n"But what is magnetism?"\r\n\r\n"I couldn\'t tell you if I tried; but I think you could learn a great\r\ndeal about it with that magnet. You will find a lot of things in that\r\nbox that may help you."\r\n\r\nSaying this, I left him to pursue his studies as best he could. When I\r\ncame back, I found him more puzzled than when I left him.\r\n\r\n"That\'s the queerest thing I ever saw," he said. "Some things just jump\r\nat it as though they were alive; some things it pulls; and some things\r\nit doesn\'t pull a bit."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a very long lesson you have learned," I said. "What does it\r\npull?"\r\n\r\n"These," he said, pointing to a pile of things on one side of the box.\r\n"And these things it doesn\'t pull."\r\n\r\n"Let us see what you have in this pile," I said, looking at the first\r\nlittle heap; "keys?"\r\n\r\n"Trunk keys," said Charlie. "It doesn\'t pull door keys. I tried ever so\r\nmany."\r\n\r\n"Try this key," said I, taking one from my pocket. "This is a trunk key.\r\nSee if the magnet pulls it."\r\n\r\n"No-o," said Charlie, thoughtfully, "it doesn\'t; but it pulled all the\r\nrest of the trunk keys I could find."\r\n\r\n"Try this key to my office door."\r\n\r\nCharlie tried it, and to his great amazement the key stuck fast to the\r\nmagnet.\r\n\r\n"Surely," said I, "it pulls some door keys, and fails to pull some trunk\r\nkeys."\r\n\r\nCharlie was more puzzled than ever. He looked at the keys, thought a\r\nmoment, then picked up my trunk key, and said: "This key is brass; the\r\nrest are iron."\r\n\r\n"That\'s so," I said.\r\n\r\n"And all these door keys that the magnet didn\'t pull," he continued,\r\n"are brass, too. Perhaps it can\'t pull brass things."\r\n\r\n"Suppose you try. But first see if there are any brass things that the\r\nmagnet pulled."\r\n\r\nCharlie looked them over. Then we tried the casters of my chair, and all\r\nthe other brass things we could find, none of which the magnet would\r\npull.\r\n\r\n"There\'s no use in trying any longer," said Charlie. "It won\'t pull\r\nbrass."\r\n\r\n"Then, there\'s another matter settled," I said. "The magnet does not\r\npull brass. Is there any thing else it does not pull?"\r\n\r\n"Wood," said Charlie. "I tried lots of pieces."\r\n\r\n"Any thing else?"\r\n\r\n"Stones," said Charlie, eagerly.\r\n\r\n"What are these?" I asked, holding up a couple of heavy stones he had\r\nput among the things the magnet pulled.\r\n\r\n"I guess I put those there by mistake," said Charlie, testing with, the\r\nmagnet a number of stones in the other pile.\r\n\r\n"Try them," I said.\r\n\r\n"O!" he said, as the magnet lifted them; "I forgot. It does lift some\r\nstones."\r\n\r\n"Well, what else have you in that pile of things the magnet did not\r\npull?"\r\n\r\n"Glass, leather, lead, bone, cloth, tin, zinc, corn, and a lot of\r\nthings."\r\n\r\n"Very well. Now let us see what the magnet does pull."\r\n\r\n"Iron keys," said Charlie, "and nails."\r\n\r\n"Here\'s a nail in this other pile."\r\n\r\n"That\'s a brass nail. The magnet pulls only iron nails."\r\n\r\n"What else have we in this pile?"\r\n\r\n"Needles, hair-pins, screws, wire--iron wire," he added quickly. "Brass\r\nwire doesn\'t stick, you know."\r\n\r\n"How about this?" I asked, taking a small coil of copper wire from my\r\ndesk.\r\n\r\n"I guess that won\'t stick," said Charlie. "Because that\'s copper wire,\r\nand the magnet doesn\'t seem to pull any thing that isn\'t iron."\r\n\r\nMuch to Charlie\'s satisfaction, the magnet did not pull the copper wire.\r\nThen I took up two stones, one rusty red, the other black, and said:\r\n"What about these?"\r\n\r\n"I guess they must have iron in them too," said Charlie. "Have they?"\r\n\r\n"They have," I replied. "They are iron ores from which iron is made. Why\r\ndid you think there was iron in them?"\r\n\r\n"Because they wouldn\'t have stuck to the magnet if there wasn\'t."\r\n\r\n"Quite true. So you have learned another very important fact. Can you\r\ntell me what it is?"\r\n\r\n"The magnet pulls iron," said Charlie.\r\n\r\n"Good," said I; "and it is also true that the magnet does not pull--"\r\n\r\n"Things that are not iron," said Charlie.\r\n\r\n"True again," I said. "So far as our experiments go, the magnet pulls\r\niron always, and never any thing else."\r\n\r\n"But what makes it pull iron?"\r\n\r\n"That I can not tell. We see it does pull, but just how the pulling is\r\ndone, or what makes it, no one has yet found out.\r\n\r\n"For convenience we call the pulling power magnetism. You may keep the\r\nmagnet, and at some other time, I will tell you more about it."\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage Lesson.--Name six words in the lesson, each of which is made\r\nup of two words by leaving out letters.\r\n\r\nWrite out the two words in each case.\r\n\r\nWhat is the name of the mark which shows the omission of letters?\r\n\r\nPoint out the _statement, command, question_, and _exclamation_ in\r\nthe sentences given below.\r\n\r\n    "O, isn\'t it a funny horseshoe!"\r\n\r\n    "Put the bar back."\r\n\r\n    "What made it jump so?"\r\n\r\n    "The magnet pulls iron."\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nex pos\'es, _shows_.\r\n\r\nmi mo\'sa, _a tree that grows in Africa_.\r\n\r\nmot\'tled, _marked with spots of different color_.\r\n\r\nre sem\'bling, _looking like_.\r\n\r\nap proach\', _coming near_.\r\n\r\npub\'lic, _open to all; free_.\r\n\r\nva\'ri ous,  _different; unlike in kind_.\r\n\r\nde fend\', _take care of; protect_.\r\n\r\ngait, _manner of stepping_.\r\n\r\npre vents\', _keeps from; stops_.\r\n\r\nca\' pa ble, _having power; able_.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GIRAFFE OR CAMELOPARD.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are few sights more pleasing than a herd of tall and graceful\r\ngiraffes.\r\n\r\nWith, their heads reaching a height of from twelve to eighteen feet,\r\nthey move about in small herds on the open plains of Africa, eating the\r\ntender twigs and leaves of the mimosa and other trees.\r\n\r\nThe legs of a large giraffe are about nine feet long, and its neck\r\nnearly six feet; while its body measures only seven feet in length and\r\nslopes rapidly from the neck to the tail.\r\n\r\nThe graceful appearance of the giraffe is increased by the beauty of its\r\nskin, which is orange red in color and mottled with dark spots.\r\n\r\nIts long tail has at the end a tuft of thick hair which serves the\r\npurpose of keeping off the flies and stinging insects, so plentiful in\r\nthe hot climate of Africa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIts tongue is very wonderful. It is from thirteen to seventeen inches in\r\nlength, is slender and pointed, and is capable of being moved in various\r\nways. It is almost as useful to the giraffe as the trunk is to the\r\nelephant.\r\n\r\nThe horns of the giraffe are very short and covered with skin. At the\r\nends there are tufts of short hair. The animal has divided hoofs\r\nsomewhat resembling those of the ox.\r\n\r\nThe head of the giraffe is small, and its eyes, large and mild looking.\r\nThese eyes are set in such a way that the animal can see a great deal of\r\nwhat is behind it without turning its head.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its wonderful power of sight, the giraffe can scent\r\ndanger from a great distance; so there is no animal more difficult of\r\napproach.\r\n\r\nStrange to relate, the giraffe has no voice. In London, some years ago,\r\ntwo giraffes were burned to death in their stables, when the slightest\r\nsound would have given notice of their danger, and saved their lives.\r\n\r\nThe giraffe is naturally both gentle and timid, and he will always try\r\nto avoid danger by flight. It is when running that he exposes his only\r\nungraceful point.\r\n\r\nHe runs swiftly, but as he moves the fore and hind legs on each side at\r\nthe same time, it gives him a very displeasing and awkward gait.\r\n\r\nBut though timid, he will, when overtaken, turn even upon the lion or\r\npanther, and defend himself successfully by powerful kicks with his\r\nstrong legs.\r\n\r\nThe natives of Africa capture the giraffe in pitfalls, which are deep\r\nholes covered over with branches of trees and dirt. When captured, he\r\ncan be tamed, and gives scarcely any trouble during captivity.\r\n\r\nFifty years ago, but little was known about giraffes in Europe or\r\nAmerica. Now we can find them in menageries and the public gardens of\r\nour large cities.\r\n\r\nThe giraffe thrives in captivity and seems to be well satisfied with a\r\ndiet of corn and hay. It is a source of great satisfaction to those who\r\nadmire this beautiful animal, that there is no reason which prevents him\r\nfrom living in a climate so different from that of his African home.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage Lesson.--Write statements containing each of the following\r\nwords, used in such a manner as to show their proper meaning: _feet,\r\nfeat; red, read; fore, four; gait, gate_.\r\n\r\n    Model.--\r\n\r\n    We are coming to _see_ you to-morrow.\r\n\r\n    He stood watching the ships sailing on the _sea_.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nex pert\', _skillful_.\r\n\r\nad vise\', _offer advice; give notice of what has happened_.\r\n\r\nciv\'il ized, _having laws, learning, and good manners_.\r\n\r\nquan\'ti ty, _a large amount; part_.\r\n\r\nin duce\', _lead one to think or act_.\r\n\r\npre pared\', _made ready for use_.\r\n\r\nde part\'ed, _went away_.\r\n\r\nhence forth\', _from this time forward_.\r\n\r\npart\'ner, _one who shares with another, as a partner in business_.\r\n\r\nar riv\'ing, _coming to; reaching a point_.\r\n\r\ncon vince\', _make one believe_.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRADER\'S TRICK.\r\n\r\n\r\nOut in the West, where many Indians live, there are white men who go\r\namong them to trade for furs and skins of animals.\r\n\r\nThese furs and skins are collected and prepared by the Indians, and\r\nserve the purpose of money when the traders visit them to dispose of\r\nvarious kinds of goods.\r\n\r\nIn old times, before the white men came to this country, the Indians had\r\nonly bows and arrows, and spears with which to hunt.\r\n\r\nBut the white men soon taught them to use guns, and to-day, nearly all\r\nthe tribes in America are well supplied with rifles or shotguns.\r\n\r\nThey are very expert with these fire-arms, and as they use them a great\r\ndeal, must have a large and constant supply of gunpowder.\r\n\r\nA story is told of how, at one time, a tribe of Indians tried to raise\r\ngunpowder by planting seed. This shows how little they knew of civilized\r\nlife and habits.\r\n\r\nA trader went to a certain Indian nation to dispose of a stock of goods.\r\nAmong other things he had a quantity of gunpowder.\r\n\r\nThe Indians traded for his cloths, hats, axes, beads, and other things,\r\nbut would not take the powder, saying: "We do not wish for the powder;\r\nwe have plenty."\r\n\r\nThe trader did not like to carry all the powder back to his camp; so\r\nthought he would play a trick on the Indians, and induce them to buy it.\r\n\r\nGoing to an open piece of ground near the Indian camp, he dug some\r\nlittle holes in the soft, rich soil; then mixing a quantity of onion\r\nseed with his powder, he began to plant it.\r\n\r\nThe Indians were curious to know what he was doing, and stood by greatly\r\ninterested.\r\n\r\n"What are you doing?" said one. "Planting gunpowder," replied the\r\ntrader.\r\n\r\n"Why do you plant it?" inquired another.\r\n\r\n"To raise a crop of powder. How could I raise it without planting?" said\r\nthe trader. "Do you not plant corn in the ground?"\r\n\r\n"And will gunpowder grow like corn?" exclaimed half a dozen at once.\r\n\r\n"Certainly it will," said the trader. "Did you not know it? As you do\r\nnot want my powder, I thought I would plant it, and raise a crop which I\r\ncould gather and sell to the Crows."\r\n\r\nNow the Crows were another tribe of Indians, which was always at war\r\nwith this tribe. The idea of their enemies having a large supply of\r\npowder increased the excitement, and one of the Indians said:\r\n\r\n"Well, well, if we can raise powder like corn, we will buy your stock\r\nand plant it."\r\n\r\nBut some of the Indians thought best to wait, and see if the seed would\r\ngrow. So the trader agreed to wait a few days.\r\n\r\nIn about a week the tiny sprouts of the onion seed began to appear above\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nThe trader calling the Indians to the spot, said: "You see now for\r\nyourselves. The powder already begins to grow, just as I told you it\r\nwould."\r\n\r\nThe fact that some small plants appeared where the trader had put the\r\ngunpowder, was enough to convince the Indians.\r\n\r\nEvery one of them became anxious to raise a crop of gunpowder.\r\n\r\nThe trader sold them his stock, in which there was a large mixture of\r\nonion seeds, at a very high price, and then left.\r\n\r\nFrom this time, the Indians gave no attention to their corn crop. If\r\nthey could raise gunpowder, they would be happy.\r\n\r\nThey took great care of the little plants as they came up out of the\r\nground, and watched every day for the appearance of the gunpowder\r\nblossoms.\r\n\r\nThey planned a buffalo hunt which was to take place after the powder\r\nharvest.\r\n\r\nAfter a while the onions bore a plentiful crop of seeds, and the Indians\r\nbegan to gather and thresh it.\r\n\r\nThey believed that threshing the onion seeds would produce the powder.\r\nBut threshing failed to bring it. Then they discovered that they had\r\nbeen cheated.\r\n\r\nOf course the dishonest trader avoided these Indians, and did not make\r\nthem a second visit.\r\n\r\nAfter some time, however, he sent his partner to them for the purpose of\r\ntrading goods for furs and skins.\r\n\r\nBy chance they found out that this man was the partner of the one who\r\nhad cheated them.\r\n\r\nThey said nothing to him about the matter; but when he had opened his\r\ngoods and was ready to trade, they coolly helped themselves to all he\r\nhad, and walked off.\r\n\r\nThe trader did not understand this. He became furiously angry, and went\r\nto make his complaint to the chief of the nation.\r\n\r\n"I am an honest man," said he to the chief. "I came here to trade\r\nhonestly. But your people are thieves; they have stolen all my goods."\r\n\r\nThe old chief looked at him some time in silence, and then said: "My\r\nchildren are all honest. They have not stolen your goods. They will pay\r\nyou as soon as they gather their gunpowder harvest."\r\n\r\nThe man had heard of the trick played upon the Indians; but did not know\r\nbefore this, that his partner was the one who had cheated them. He could\r\nnot say a word. He departed at once. Arriving at his home, he said to\r\nhis partner:\r\n\r\n"We must separate. I have learned a lesson. I can not remain in business\r\nwith a dishonest man. You cheated the Indians for a little gain. You\r\nhave lost it, and I advise you, henceforth, to deal honestly with all\r\nmen."\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDirections for Reading.--In the first paragraph of the lesson, notice\r\nthe places marked below (__) where words are likely to be run together\r\nin reading, and avoid making such errors.\r\n\r\n    "Out__in the West, there__are men who trade for furs__and skins__of\r\n    animals."\r\n\r\nPoint out similar places in the second paragraph.\r\n\r\nName four _emphatic words_ occurring in the last sentence of the\r\nlesson.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage Lesson.

It was his business to go\r\nwith caravans, backwards and forwards, across the desert to Suez, to\r\ntake care of the camels. He had a wife and one young son, called Ali.\r\n\r\nHassan had been, absent for many weeks, when his wife received from him\r\na message, brought by another camel-driver, who had returned with a\r\ncaravan from Suez.\r\n\r\nIt said: "Send the boy with the camel to Suez with the next caravan. I\r\nhave some merchandise to bring home, and I will stop at Suez till he\r\ncomes."\r\n\r\nAli\'s mother was pained at the thought of sending her young son away to\r\nsuch a distance for the first time; but she said to herself that Ali\r\nwas now quite old enough to be helping his father, and she at once set\r\nabout doing what was required for his journey.\r\n\r\nAli got out the trappings for the camel, and looked to the water-bottles\r\nto see that they did not leak. His mother did all that was needed to\r\nmake him quite ready to join the next caravan that started.\r\n\r\nAli was delighted to think that he was to go to his father, and that at\r\nlast the day was come when, he too was to be a camel-driver, and to take\r\na journey with the dear old camel which he was so fond of.\r\n\r\nHe had long wanted to ride on its back across the desert, and to lie\r\ndown by its side to rest at night. He had no fear.\r\n\r\nThe camel, of which Ali was so fond, had been bought by his father with\r\nthe savings of many a year\'s hard work, and formed the sole riches of\r\nthe family.\r\n\r\nHassan was looked upon as quite a rich man by the other camel-drivers,\r\nand Ali, besides having a great love for the animal, was proud of his\r\nfather being a camel owner.\r\n\r\nThough it was a great creature by the side of the young boy, it would\r\nobey the voice of Ali, and come and go at his bidding, and lie down and\r\nrise up just as he wished. Hassan called his camel by an Arabian word,\r\nwhich meant "Meek-eye."\r\n\r\nAt last, there was a caravan about to start for Suez which Ali could\r\njoin. The party met near the gates of the city, where there were some\r\nwells, at which the water-bottles could be filled. Ali\'s mother\r\nattended, and bid her son a loving farewell.\r\n\r\nThe caravan started. The camels which were to lead the way, had around\r\ntheir necks jingling bells, which the others hearing, followed without\r\nother guidance.\r\n\r\nAli looked about and saw his mother standing near the city gate. He took\r\nhis cap off and waved it above his head, and his mother took off the\r\nlinen cloth which she wore over her head, and waved it.\r\n\r\nTramp, tramp, tramp went the camels, their soft spongy feet making a\r\nnoise as they trod the ground. The camel-drivers laughed, and talked to\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nAli was the only boy in the caravan, and no one seemed to notice him. He\r\nhad a stout heart, and tried not to care.\r\n\r\nHe could talk to Meek-eye, and this he did, patting the creature\'s back,\r\nand telling him they would soon see his father.\r\n\r\nThe sun rose higher and higher, and the day grew hotter and hotter. The\r\nmorning breeze died away, and the noon was close and sultry.\r\n\r\nThe sand glowed like fire. There was nothing to be seen but sand and\r\nsky. At mid-day a halt was made at one of the places well known to the\r\ndrivers, where shade and water could be had.\r\n\r\nThe water-bottles were not to be touched that day, for at this place a\r\nlittle stream, which gushed from a rock, supplied enough for the men,\r\nwhile the camels needed no water for many days.\r\n\r\nAfter resting a short time, the kneeling camels were made to rise, the\r\nriders first placing themselves on their backs, and the caravan then\r\nmoved on.\r\n\r\nAt night the party encamped for rest, the camels lying down, while fires\r\nwere lighted and food was prepared.\r\n\r\nSeveral days were thus passed, and Ali found that he liked this kind of\r\nlife as well as he thought he should.\r\n\r\nNo Arabs were met with, nor even seen; but a danger of the desert, worse\r\nthan a party of Arabs, came upon them.\r\n\r\nThere arose one day at noon, one of those fearful burning winds which do\r\nsuch mischief to the traveler and his camel. The loose sand was raised\r\nlike a cloud. It filled the nostrils and blinded the eyes.\r\n\r\nThe only thing to be done, was for the men to get off the backs of the\r\ncamels, and lie down with their faces to the earth.\r\n\r\nAfter the storm had passed, they arose to continue their journey. But\r\nthe sand had been so blown as to cover the beaten track, and thus all\r\ntrace of the road was lost.\r\n\r\nThe camel-drivers who led the way stood still, and said that they did\r\nnot know which way to turn.\r\n\r\nNo distant rock or palm-tree was to be seen, and no one could say which\r\nwas the south, towards which their faces ought to be turned.\r\n\r\nThey wandered on, now turning to the right, and now to the left; and\r\nsometimes, when they had gone some distance in one direction, retracing\r\ntheir steps and trying another.\r\n\r\nThe caravan made a halt, and it was now decided to journey towards the\r\nsetting sun, in hopes of finding once more the right track.\r\n\r\nNight came on, however, and they had not found it, nor had they reached\r\nany place where they could fill their water-bottles, which were empty.\r\n\r\nOnce or twice, some one of the party fancied that he saw in the distance\r\nthe top of a palm-tree; but no, it turned out to be but a little cloud\r\nupon the horizon.\r\n\r\nThey had not yet found the old track; neither had they supplied\r\nthemselves with water to cool their parched lips.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDirections for Reading.--Always take breath before beginning to read a\r\nsentence.

He drank the last\r\ndrop of water from his water-bottle, and thought of the morrow with\r\nfear.\r\n\r\nHe was so tired when night came, he was glad to lie down by the side of\r\nMeek-eye and go to sleep. Ali slept, but before morning, was awakened by\r\nthe sound of voices.\r\n\r\nHe listened, and heard the chief driver tell one of the merchants that,\r\nif they did not find water very soon, the next day a camel must be\r\nkilled, in order to get the water contained in its stomach.\r\n\r\nThis is often done in cases of great need in the desert, the stomach of\r\nthe camel being so formed as to hold a great quantity of water.\r\n\r\nAli was not surprised to hear such a thing spoken of; but what was his\r\ndistress and alarm, when he heard the merchant propose that it should be\r\n"the boy\'s camel" that should be killed!\r\n\r\nThe merchant said the other camels were of too good a kind, and of too\r\nmuch value; while, as to this young boy, what business had he to have a\r\ncamel of his own?\r\n\r\nIt would be better far, they said, for him to lose his camel than for\r\nhim to die, like the rest, of thirst. And so it was decided that\r\nMeek-eye should be killed, unless water were found the next morning.\r\n\r\nAli slept no more. His heart was full of grief; but his grief was mixed\r\nwith courage and resolution. He said to himself that Meek-eye should not\r\ndie.\r\n\r\nHis father had trusted him to bring the camel, and what would he say if\r\nhe should arrive at Suez without it? He would try to find his way alone,\r\nand leave the caravan as soon as possible.\r\n\r\nThat night when all was quiet, and the merchant and camel-driver had\r\ngone to sleep, Ali arose, and gently patting the neck of Meek-eye, awoke\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nHe placed his empty bag and water-bottles on his back, and seating\r\nhimself on him, made signs for the creature to rise, and then suddenly\r\nstarted off.\r\n\r\nTramp, tramp, tramp, went Meek-eye over the soft sand. The night was\r\ncool and refreshing, and Ali felt stronger and braver with every tramp.\r\nThe stars were shining brightly, and they were his only guides.\r\n\r\nHe knew the star which was always in the north, and the one which was in\r\nthe west after the sun had gone down. He must keep that star to the\r\nright, and he would be sure to be going towards the south.\r\n\r\nHe journeyed on till day began to dawn. The sun came up on the edge of\r\nthe desert, and rose higher and higher. Ali felt faint, weary, and\r\nthirsty, and could scarcely hold himself on to Meek-eye. When he thought\r\nof his father and mother, he took courage again, and bore up bravely.\r\n\r\nThe sun was now at its height. Ali fancied he saw a palm-tree in the\r\ndistance. It seemed as if Meek-eye saw it also, for he raised his head\r\nand quickened his step.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before Ali found himself at one of those pleasant green\r\nislands which are found throughout the desert, and are called oases.\r\n\r\nHe threw himself from the camel\'s back, and hunted out the pool of water\r\nthat he knew he should find in the midst of the reeds and long grass\r\nwhich grew there.\r\n\r\nHe dipped in his water-bottle and drank, while Meek-eye, lying down,\r\nstretched out his long neck, and greedily sucked up great draughts of\r\nthe cool water.\r\n\r\nHow sweet was the sleep which crept over them as they lay down in the\r\nshade of the great palm-tree, now that they had quenched their thirst!\r\n\r\nRefreshed and rested, Ali was able to satisfy his hunger on some ripe\r\ndates from the palm-tree, while Meek-eye began to feed upon the grass\r\nand leaves around.\r\n\r\nAli noticed, while eating his dates, that other travelers had been there\r\nrecently: as the grass at the side of the pool was trampled down. This\r\ngreatly cheered him. He quickly followed in their track, still going in\r\na southerly direction.\r\n\r\nHe kept the setting sun to his right, and when it had gone down, he\r\nnoticed the bright star that had guided him before.\r\n\r\nHe traveled on, tired and faint with hunger for many a mile, till at\r\nlast he saw, a long way off, the fires of a caravan which had halted for\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\nAli soon came up to them. He got down, from Meek-eye, and leading him by\r\nthe bridle, came towards a group of camel-drivers, who were sitting in a\r\ncircle.\r\n\r\nHe told them his story, and asked permission to join the party, and\r\nbegged a little rice, for which he was ready to pay with the piece of\r\nmoney that his mother had given him when he left home.\r\n\r\nAli was kindly received by them, and allowed to partake of their supper.\r\nThe men admired the courage with which he had saved his favorite camel.\r\nAfter supper Ali soon closed his weary eyes, and slept soundly by the\r\nside of Meek-eye.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of a pleasant dream, Ali was suddenly aroused by the sound\r\nof tinkling bells, and on waking up he saw that another caravan had\r\narrived, which had come from the south.\r\n\r\nThe merchants sat down to wait until their supper was brought to them,\r\nand a party of camel-drivers drew round the fire near which Ali had\r\nbeen sleeping. They raked up its ashes, put on fresh fuel, and then\r\nprepared to boil their rice.\r\n\r\nWhat voice was that which roused Ali just as he was falling asleep\r\nagain? He listened, he started to his feet, he looked about him, and\r\nwaited for a flash of flame from the fire to fall on the faces of the\r\ncamel-drivers who stood around it.\r\n\r\nIt came flickering up at first, and then all at once blazing out,\r\nflashed upon the camel-driver who stood stooping over it, and lighted up\r\nthe face of Ali\'s father!\r\n\r\nThe father had waited at Suez many days, wondering why Ali did not come;\r\nand then, thinking there had been some mistake, determined to return\r\nhome with the caravan, which was starting for Gaza.\r\n\r\nWe need hardly describe the joy of both father and son at thus meeting,\r\nnor the pleasure with which the father listened to the history of Ali\r\nthe fears and dangers to which his young son had been exposed. He was\r\nglad, too, that their precious Meek-eye had been saved.\r\n\r\nThere was no one in the whole caravan so happy as Hassan, when, the next\r\nmorning, he continued, his journey to Gaza in company with Meek-eye and\r\nhis beloved son Ali.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage Lesson.--Syllabify, accent, and mark sounds of letters in the\r\nfollowing words: _suffered, permission, partake, merchants, beloved_.\r\n\r\nLet pupils use other words to express the meaning of what is given below\r\nin dark type.\r\n\r\n    Ali _bore up bravely_.\r\n\r\n    Meek-eye _quickened his step_.\r\n\r\n    _The sun_ was now _at its height_.\r\n\r\nWrite statements containing each of the following words, used in such a\r\nmanner as to show their proper meaning: _herd, heard; need, knead; no,\r\nknow; way, weigh; knew, new_.\r\n\r\nMake out an _analysis_ of the two lessons, and use it in telling the\r\nstory in your own words.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nob served\', _saw; noticed_.\r\n\r\ntrans par\'ent, _clear; easily seen through_.\r\n\r\nma te\'ri al, _that of which any thing is made or to be made_.\r\n\r\nob tained\', _taken from; received_.\r\n\r\ngar\'ments, _articles of clothing_.\r\n\r\nverd\'ure, _any green growth_.\r\n\r\na dorn\', _dress with taste; beautify_.\r\n\r\npar tic\'ular, _of an unusual kind_.\r\n\r\nva ri\'e ty, _a number of different kinds_.\r\n\r\ndel\'i cate, _gentle; tender_.\r\n\r\nca ressed\', _treated with fondness_.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA QUEER PEOPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne evening, as Captain Perry was sitting by the fireside at his home in\r\nLiverpool, his children asked him to tell them a story.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"What shall it be about?" said the captain.\r\n\r\n"O," said Harry, "tell us about other countries, and the curious people\r\nyou have seen in them."\r\n\r\n"Yes, yes!" exclaimed Mary. "We were much interested, while you were\r\naway the last time, in reading \'Gulliver\'s Travels\' and \'Sindbad the\r\nSailor.\'"\r\n\r\n"You have seen as wonderful things as they did, haven\'t you, father?"\r\nsaid Harry.\r\n\r\n"No, my dears," said the captain. "I never met such wonderful people as\r\nthey tell about, I assure you; nor have I seen the \'Black Loadstone\r\nMountain\' or the \'Valley of Diamonds.\'"\r\n\r\n"But," said Mary, "you have seen a great many people, and their\r\ndifferent manners and ways of living."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said the captain, "and if it will interest you, I will tell you\r\nsome of the curious things that I have observed."\r\n\r\n"Pray, do so!" cried Harry, as both the children drew close to him.\r\n\r\n"Well, then," began the captain, "I was once in a country where it was\r\nvery cold, and the poor people could scarcely keep themselves from\r\nstarving.\r\n\r\n"They were clothed partly in the skins of beasts, made smooth and soft\r\nby some particular art; but chiefly in garments made from the outer\r\ncovering of an animal cruelly stripped off its back while alive.\r\n\r\n"They lived in houses partly sunk below the ground. These houses were\r\nmostly built of stones or of earth hardened by fire.\r\n\r\n"The walls of the houses had holes to let in light; but to prevent the\r\ncold air and rain from coming in, they were covered with a sort of\r\ntransparent stone, made of melted sand.\r\n\r\n"As wood was rather scarce, they used for fuel a certain kind of stone\r\nwhich they dug out of the earth, and which, when put among burning\r\nwood, catches fire and makes a bright flame."\r\n\r\n"Dear me!" said Harry. "What a wonderful stone! Why didn\'t you\r\nbring a piece home with you, father?"\r\n\r\n"I have a piece, which I will show you some time," replied the captain.\r\n"But to go on with my story.\r\n\r\n"What these people eat is remarkable, too. Some of the poor people eat\r\nfish which had been hung up and smoked until quite dry and hard, and\r\nalong with it they eat the roots of plants, or coarse, black cake made\r\nof powdered seeds.\r\n\r\n"The rich people have a whiter kind of cake upon which they spread a\r\ngreasy matter that is obtained from a large animal. They eat also the\r\nflesh of many birds and beasts when they can get it, and the leaves and\r\nother parts of a variety of vegetables--some raw and others cooked.\r\n\r\n"For drink they use the water in which certain dry leaves have been\r\nsteeped. These leaves, I was told, came from a country a great distance\r\naway.\r\n\r\n"I was glad to leave this country because it was so very cold; but about\r\nsix months after, I was obliged to go there again. What was my surprise\r\nto find that great changes had taken place!\r\n\r\n"The climate was mild and warm, and the country was full of beauty and\r\nverdure. The trees and shrubs bore a great variety of fruits, which,\r\nwith other vegetable products, were used largely as food.\r\n\r\n"The people were gentle and civilized. Their dress was varied. Many wore\r\ncloth woven from a sort of wool grown in pods on bushes.\r\n\r\n"Another singular material was a fine, glossy stuff used chiefly by the\r\nrich people. I was told that it was made out of the webs of\r\ncaterpillars, which to me seemed quite wonderful, as it must have taken\r\na great number of caterpillars to produce the large quantity of the\r\nstuff that I saw.\r\n\r\n"These people have queer ideas about their dress.

Steam-boats\r\nply along the rivers, carrying people and merchandise to and fro, going\r\nsometimes as far as three thousand miles from their starting point.\r\n\r\nIt is by water that men float their rafts of logs or lumber to distant\r\nplaces. Water turns the great wheels of many of our mills, and thus\r\nharnessed to mighty machines, does more work than thousands of men and\r\nhorses.\r\n\r\nThese machines produce paper, cloth, flour, lumber, and many other\r\nuseful articles.\r\n\r\nWhen water is heated and turned into steam, it moves powerful engines.\r\nThese engines propel our great steam-ships and steam-boats and drive\r\nmachines of all kinds in mills and factories.\r\n\r\nMany of you have seen water, clear and cool, trickling from the rocks in\r\nthe side of a hill. This water first forms a spring.\r\n\r\nFrom this spring, the water escapes in a tiny stream, called a rivulet\r\nor creek, and flows along until it enters a river. Many springs make\r\nmany rivulets; many rivulets make large rivers.\r\n\r\nRivers sometimes receive such great quantities of water that they\r\noverflow their banks, and destroy much valuable property. This is called\r\na freshet or a flood.\r\n\r\nMany people who live near some of our rivers have lost their houses,\r\nfurniture, and cattle, which were all swept away by these floods.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1883, the Ohio River received so much water from the\r\nthousands of rivulets flowing into it, that it overflowed its banks.\r\n\r\nThe result of this overflow was one of the greatest floods ever known,\r\nand many, no doubt, who read this, were there to see its terrible\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nBut where does all this water come from? you may ask.\r\n\r\nLet me see if I can explain it to you. The water in all these rivers,\r\nlakes, and oceans is constantly rising into the air in what is called\r\nmoisture or vapor. We can not see this moisture, neither can we see the\r\nair.\r\n\r\nIf the air is cold, moisture does not rise rapidly; but, as the air\r\nbecomes heated, it takes up more moisture, so that the more heat there\r\nis in the air, the more moisture rises.\r\n\r\nHeated air is light, and rises higher and higher from the ground, taking\r\nthe moisture with it, until it reaches a point where it begins to cool.\r\n\r\nThen as the air cools, the moisture forms into clouds, and these clouds\r\nare, in a certain sense, floating water.\r\n\r\nFloating water! How can water float! do you ask?\r\n\r\nWell, I will tell you. Cold air is heavier than heated air, and until\r\nthe clouds become so full of moisture as to return some of it to the\r\nearth, in the shape of rain, they float because they are lighter than\r\nthe air underneath them.\r\n\r\nThe winds, by the flapping of their mighty wings, drive the clouds over\r\nthe land to the hills and the mountains and the thirsty fields; and\r\nthere they pour their blessings on the farms, pastures, orchards, and\r\nthe dusty roads and way-side grass, bringing greenness and gladness\r\nevery-where.\r\n\r\nWithout water nothing would grow; every thing would dry up and wither.\r\n\r\nAll animals drink water, for it forms a part of their blood and thus\r\nhelps to keep them alive. All trees and plants drink it by drawing it\r\nthrough their roots or leaves, for it helps to form their sap.\r\n\r\nSometimes on a summer morning you will see drops of clear sparkling\r\nwater on flowers and grass.\r\n\r\nTo look at them you would think it had rained during the night; but,\r\nnoticing that the ground is dry, you know that no rain has fallen.\r\n\r\nWhat then are these glittering drops of water? Where do they come from?\r\n\r\nI will tell you. These drops are called dew. As night comes on, the\r\ngrass and the leaves of flowers and plants become cool.\r\n\r\nWhen the warm air touches them, it becomes chilled, and as the air can\r\nnot then carry so much moisture as before, it leaves some of its\r\nmoisture on the flowers and grass.\r\n\r\nA moisture like dew sometimes collects in the house. Did you ever\r\nobserve it in drops on the outside of a pitcher of cold water? Some\r\npeople suppose that the water comes through the pitcher, but it does\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nThe water being cold makes the pitcher cold, and as the warm air of the\r\nroom strikes it, a moisture like dew is left on the pitcher, in the same\r\nmanner as dew is left on grass, leaves, and flowers.\r\n\r\nIn cold weather, when the dew gathers on plants and flowers, it\r\nsometimes freezes and forms frost, and when the clouds throw off their\r\nmoisture in rain drops, the rain becomes sleet, hail, or snow.\r\n\r\nSo you see that dew, rain, frost, sleet, snow, and hail are only\r\ndifferent forms of water.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\ntreas\'ure, _a large quantity of money; valuable things_.\r\n\r\nfor\'mer ly, _in time past; heretofore_.\r\n\r\nmod\'er ate, _not great; limited in quantity_.\r\n\r\nor\'phan, _a child whose father and mother are dead_.\r\n\r\nat tract\'ive, _inviting; having power to draw toward_.\r\n\r\nem\'er y, _a kind of hard, sharp sand_.\r\n\r\nex treme\', _last point or limit_.\r\n\r\nrub\'bish, _things of no value_.\r\n\r\nfit\'tings, _things needed in making an article ready for use_.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HIDDEN TREASURE.\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\n\r\nOn a pleasant street in the old town of Fairfield, stands a neat, little\r\ncottage. This was formerly the home of Mrs. Reed, an old lady respected\r\nby her neighbors and loved by all the young people of the place.\r\n\r\nThere was about Mrs. Reed a kindly manner which pleased all who knew\r\nher. Although very poor, she took much interest in her young friends and\r\ntried to make them happy.\r\n\r\nMrs. Reed had not always been poor. Her husband when alive was supposed\r\nto be rich; but after his death, it was found that nothing was left to\r\nhis widow but two small cottages.\r\n\r\nIn one of these cottages, Mrs. Reed lived; the other, she rented. But\r\nthe rent received was no more than enough to enable her to live with\r\nmoderate comfort. She had little or nothing left with which to do for\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nOne cold winter morning, two persons were talking together in the cozy\r\nsitting-room of the cottage. One was Mrs. Reed, and the other, Alice\r\nBrown, a poor orphan girl, who lived with some distant relatives in\r\nFairfield.\r\n\r\n"You are very kind to come to see me so often, Alice," said Mrs. Reed.\r\n"I wonder why you do; because there is nothing attractive here."\r\n\r\n"Why, Mrs. Reed!" replied Alice; "how can you talk so? are you not here?\r\ndo I not always receive a kind word and a welcome smile from you?"\r\n\r\n"Well, you know I love you, Alice, and am always delighted to have you\r\ncome," said Mrs. Reed; "I am sure that were it in my power to do so, I\r\nwould have you here all the time.\r\n\r\n"I would like to give you books, have you attend school, and do every\r\nthing to make you happy. But alas! Alice, you know I am too poor to do\r\nwhat I wish, and at times it makes me feel very sad."\r\n\r\n"O, indeed you are too good, Mrs. Reed! My greatest pleasure is to come\r\nand see you, and I hope you will always love me.\r\n\r\n"I wish I could stay here all day; but you know that the day after\r\nto-morrow will be Christmas, and I must hurry home now, as auntie wants\r\nme to help her prepare for it. So good-by."\r\n\r\n"But, Alice, you will come to see me Christmas morning, will you not?"\r\nasked Mrs. Reed.\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied Alice, "for a little while." And with a kiss and another\r\ngood-by, she left Mrs. Reed alone.\r\n\r\n"What a dear good girl she is," said Mrs. Reed to herself, as she\r\nwatched Alice tripping down the street toward her home.\r\n\r\n"She was so good to me last summer when I was ill! and here is Christmas\r\nand I have no money with which to buy her a present.\r\n\r\n"O dear, dear! why was I left so poor! I am sure my husband had some\r\nmoney; what could he have done with it!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Reed sat down in her rocking-chair and for a full half hour looked\r\nthoughtfully into the fire. Starting up suddenly, she again exclaimed to\r\nherself:\r\n\r\n"I do really believe that if I go up into the garret, I can find,\r\nsomething for a Christmas present, that will please Alice.\r\n\r\n"I remember a curious old box that Mr. Reed had, that was sent to him\r\nfrom India. If I can find some bits of ribbon, and silk, I will line it\r\nand make it into a nice little work-box for Alice."\r\n\r\nThen Mrs. Reed climbed up the narrow stairway into the garret, and,\r\nafter searching some time among the rubbish that lay around in all the\r\nnooks and corners, discovered the box.\r\n\r\nTaking it down-stairs and finding some pieces of silk, she spent the\r\nrest of the day in making it into a work-box.\r\n\r\nShe made a pretty needle-book, a tiny pincushion, and an emery bag like\r\na big strawberry. Then from her own scanty stock she added needles,\r\npins, thread, and her only pair of small scissors, scoured to the last\r\nextreme of brightness.\r\n\r\nOne thing only she had to buy--a thimble; and that she bought for a\r\npenny. The thimble was of brass and so bright that it was quite as\r\nhandsome as gold.\r\n\r\nWhen full, the little box was very pretty. In the bottom lay a quilted\r\nlining, which had always been there, and upon which she had placed the\r\nfittings.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDirections for Reading.--The conversational parts of this lesson may\r\nbe read as a dialogue by two pupils.\r\n\r\nWhich is the most _emphatic word_ in the following sentence?\r\n\r\n    "O dear, dear!

Mrs. Reed," said Alice.\r\n\r\n"Thank you, my dear," replied Mrs. Reed; "it will indeed be a \'Merry\r\nChristmas\' if you can remain with me this forenoon."\r\n\r\n"Well, I can stay till dinner-time," said Alice. "See what a pretty\r\npresent cousin John sent me!" and Alice held up a new pocket-book.\r\n\r\n"That is very nice, Alice," said Mrs. Reed; "now if you had some one to\r\nfill it with money, it would be better still."\r\n\r\n"Yes, indeed," cried Alice, laughingly; "but as I was not so fortunate\r\nas to receive any money, and have none of my own to put in it, the\r\npocket-book is not likely to be worn out for a long time."\r\n\r\n"Well, well, Alice," replied Mrs. Reed, "it is always handy to have\r\nthings in the house; for some time they may be needed.\r\n\r\n"Excuse me a moment, Alice," continued Mrs. Reed; "sit down here by the\r\nfire and warm yourself."\r\n\r\nAlice took a seat by the fire and warmed her fingers; for, although it\r\nwas a bright sunshiny day, it was very cold.\r\n\r\nMrs. Reed stepped into the adjoining room, and with a light heart and\r\nan expression on her face that no one had seen for many a day, took up\r\nthe little work-box she had prepared for Alice.\r\n\r\nReturning again to the sitting-room with the box in her hand, she\r\napproached Alice and said;\r\n\r\n"Here, my dear, is a little Christmas present I have for you. I\r\nsincerely wish it were something better. It will be useful, I know, and\r\nI hope it will please you."\r\n\r\n"O how beautiful!" exclaimed Alice, as she caught sight of the curious\r\ncarvings on the outside of the box. "And a work-box, too!" she\r\ncontinued, as she took it in her hands and lifted the cover; "is it\r\nreally for me?"\r\n\r\n"For no one else, I assure you," replied Mrs. Reed, as her face lighted\r\nup with joy, at seeing Alice so happy.\r\n\r\n"O how can I ever thank you enough!" exclaimed Alice, as she threw her\r\narms around Mrs. Reed\'s neck and kissed her again and again.\r\n\r\nThen taking a seat by Mrs. Reed, Alice began to examine the contents of\r\nthe new work-box, lifting out the articles one by one, and placing them\r\nin her lap.\r\n\r\nShe then admired the beautiful lining which. Mrs. Reed had put in the\r\nbox, asking her where she got such pretty pieces of silk.\r\n\r\n"That piece of silk at the top, Alice, is a bit of my wedding-dress; and\r\nthat on the sides, is a part of my wedding-sash. Those remind me of\r\nhappy days, Alice.\r\n\r\n"I had plenty then: a good husband, a happy home, and never thought that\r\nI should come to poverty."\r\n\r\n"What is this from?" asked Alice, touching the silk lining at the\r\nbottom of the box.\r\n\r\n"O that was always in the box, Alice. It was there when my husband\r\nreceived it, and must be a piece of India silk.\r\n\r\n"Is any thing the matter with it?" continued Mrs. Reed, as she noticed\r\nAlice picking at one corner of it.\r\n\r\n"O nothing is the matter," replied Alice; "it only seemed to me to be a\r\nlittle loose."\r\n\r\n"Let me look," said Mrs. Reed. "I don\'t think it can be loose, or I\r\nshould have seen it when I was lining the box."\r\n\r\n"It is actually quite loose," said Alice, as she examined it further,\r\nand picked up one corner with, a pin; "and here is a little piece of\r\npaper underneath it."\r\n\r\n"That is remarkable," said Mrs. Reed, as she put on her spectacles and\r\ndrew up her chair a little closer to Alice.\r\n\r\n"And there is some writing on it too," said Alice, as she drew it from\r\nits hiding-place and handed it to Mrs. Reed.\r\n\r\n"Why, it\'s my husband\'s writing!" exclaimed Mrs. Reed, as she closely\r\nexamined the faded letters. "What can it mean? I never saw it before.\r\nRead it, Alice; your eyes are younger than mine."\r\n\r\nAlice read: "\'Look and ye shall find,\' and underneath this," continued\r\nAlice, "is a picture of a mantel-piece, and underneath that, it reads:\r\n\'A word to the wise is sufficient.\'"\r\n\r\nMrs. Reed again took the paper. Her hand trembled and her face became a\r\nlittle pale.\r\n\r\n"Alice," said she, "this is a picture of the old tile mantel-piece in\r\nthe other room. There is some mystery about this. What can it mean?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Alice, "the tiles in that mantel have quotations on them."\r\n\r\nIn an instant, Alice was on her feet and sprung into the other room,\r\nleaving Mrs. Reed in a state of wonderment.\r\n\r\nHastily examining the tiles in the mantel, Alice cried out: "O Mrs.\r\nReed, do come! here is a tile with exactly the same words on it!"\r\n\r\nMrs. Reed hurried into the room, and had scarcely passed the threshold,\r\nwhen the tile fell to the hearth and broke into a dozen pieces.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDirections for Reading.--Point out breathing-places in the last\r\nparagraph.\r\n\r\nPronounce carefully the following words: _fortunate, adjoining,\r\nclothes, hearth, sitting-room, wedding-dress_.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage Lesson.--Let pupils use other words to express the meaning of\r\nthe following sentences.\r\n\r\n    _Alice received a warm welcome_.\r\n\r\n    _Mrs. Reed stepped into the adjoining room with a light heart_.\r\n\r\n    _Her face lighted up with joy_.\r\n\r\n    _Those things remind me of happy days_.\r\n\r\n    "_A word, to the wise is sufficient_."\r\n\r\nChange the _statements_ given above to _questions_.\r\n\r\nChange the following _exclamations_ to complete _statements_.\r\n\r\n    Do come!

"O Mrs. Reed, I\'m\r\nso sorry--I have broken the tile!"\r\n\r\n"How did it happen, Alice? Was it loose?"\r\n\r\n"Why yes," replied Alice; "I put my hand on it, and thought it appeared\r\nto move a little. Having my scissors with, me, I, through curiosity, ran\r\nthe points in between that tile and the next one."\r\n\r\n"Never mind, child," said Mrs. Reed kindly, seeing that Alice was\r\nfeeling sad over the mishap; "perhaps the tile can be mended--let us\r\nsee."\r\n\r\nAs they both stooped down to pick up the pieces, Alice noticed that\r\nthere was a hollow space back of where the tile had been, and that it\r\ncontained something of a dingy white color.\r\n\r\n"O Mrs. Reed!" cried she; "there is something in there! See, it looks\r\nlike a bag tied up! May I take it out?"\r\n\r\nMrs. Reed turned deadly pale. "Yes," she replied, scarcely knowing what\r\nshe expected or dared hope.\r\n\r\nAlice thrust her hand into the hole to pull the hag out, but as it was\r\nvery old, it fell apart, and O wonder of wonders! as many as a hundred\r\npieces of gold coin fell with a jingle on the hearth and rolled every\r\nway.\r\n\r\n"My husband\'s money!" exclaimed Mrs. Reed, as she leaned on Alice to\r\nkeep from falling.\r\n\r\nAlice was nearly wild and talked like a crazy person.\r\n\r\n"O goody, goody!" she cried, clapping her hands and jumping up and down.\r\n"Now you can have everything you want! you won\'t be poor any longer!"\r\n\r\nBut Mrs. Reed was too much overcome to hear what Alice said.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nShe could scarcely realize the good fortune that had so suddenly\r\nbefallen her.\r\n\r\nPresently, however, with the tenderness of a mother, she placed her arms\r\naround Alice and said: "O you precious child! but for you, I should\r\nnever have known this!"\r\n\r\n"And if you had not given me the work-box," said Alice, "perhaps no one\r\nwould ever have found it out.\r\n\r\n"But," continued she, excitedly, "let us see if there is any thing more\r\nin there."\r\n\r\nAgain reaching into the hole in the mantel-piece, she sprung back with a\r\nlook of amazement that frightened Mrs. Reed.\r\n\r\n"Why, Alice, what is the matter?" inquired the old lady.\r\n\r\n"Matter!" exclaimed Alice. "Why, dear me! Mrs. Reed, there are lots and\r\nlots of bags in there yet!"\r\n\r\n"Is it possible!" said Mrs. Reed hoarsely. Then reaching her hand into\r\nthe hole, she drew out bag after bag, handling them very carefully, so\r\nthat they would not fall to pieces as the first one had done.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Alice had pushed a table up near the fire-place. The\r\nbags were emptied upon it, until the glittering gold made a heap that\r\nstruck Mrs. Reed and Alice with greater amazement than ever.\r\n\r\n"Alice," said Mrs. Reed, "this is a blessing from Heaven that I do not\r\ndeserve. I can not tell you how thankful I am for it. My happiness now\r\nwill be in doing for others."\r\n\r\nAlice said nothing; her heart was too full. A look of sadness came over\r\nher face.\r\n\r\nShe was wondering whether Mrs. Reed would continue to love her, and\r\nthinking, with a mingled feeling of fear and dread, that now her friend\r\nwas rich, perhaps she, the poor orphan girl, might not be so welcome at\r\nthe cottage as before.\r\n\r\nMrs. Reed seemed to understand somewhat the nature of Alice\'s thoughts.\r\n"Cheer up, Alice," said she; "this is not a time to be sad! Come, help\r\nme put away this gold.\r\n\r\n"By the way, Alice, now is the time to use your pocket-book; you know I\r\ntold you it was handy to have things in the house, they might be\r\nneeded," she continued, smilingly.\r\n\r\n"Why, certainly, Mrs. Reed; do you want to borrow my pocket-book? here\r\nit is."\r\n\r\n"Yes, my dear," replied Mrs. Reed, "I shall want a new one myself, and I\r\nwant to see yours. I wonder how many pieces of gold it will hold."\r\n\r\nThen Mrs. Reed crammed the pocket-book full of gold pieces.\r\n\r\n"There!" said she, handing it to Alice; "that is the Christmas present I\r\nwanted to give you this morning, but did not have it."\r\n\r\n"What! this for me! O no, no! I do not deserve it!" cried Alice.\r\n\r\n"But you must take it, Alice, and listen; for I have something to tell\r\nyou. I want you to be my daughter now. I will have abundant means to\r\nmake both of us comfortable and happy."\r\n\r\n"O Mrs. Reed," said Alice, bursting into tears; "I would love to be your\r\ndaughter, nothing could make me happier."\r\n\r\nIn a very short time every thing was changed in the little cottage. Mrs.\r\nReed had legally adopted Alice as her daughter and was sending her to\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nFresh paint, inside and out, and many new comforts, made the old house\r\ncharming and bright. But nothing could change the happy relations\r\nbetween the two friends, and a more contented and cheerful household\r\ncould not be found anywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage Lesson.--Tell the story in your own words, using the points\r\ngiven in the following\r\n\r\nAnalysis.--1.

We are apt to take it for granted that any air\r\nwill do for us; stale air, dirty air, even poisonous air.\r\n\r\nWhat makes the matter worse is, that we can not help spoiling air\r\nourselves by the very act of breathing.\r\n\r\nIf people are shut up in rooms where the bad air can not get out and the\r\ngood air can not get in at all, they are sure to be made ill.\r\n\r\nSome people in Scotland thought they would have a merry Christmas party,\r\nand invited their friends to come to a dance.\r\n\r\nAs it was very cold weather, they shut all the doors and windows tight,\r\nand then they began to dance.\r\n\r\nIt was a small room with a low ceiling, and there were thirty-six people\r\ndancing in it all night. By the time morning came the air was so bad\r\nthat it was really like poison; and very soon seven of the poor dancers\r\nwere seized with a terrible fever, and two of them actually died.\r\n\r\nThe air we breathe out is different from the air we take in. We send\r\naway some things with our breath which were not in the air when we took\r\nit in.\r\n\r\nOne of these is water. Sometimes you can see this for yourself. On a\r\ncold, frosty day, you know we can see the clouds of steam coming out of\r\nour mouths. This steam is only very fine particles of water.\r\n\r\nIn warm weather we do not see the steam, but the water is there all the\r\nsame; if you will breathe on a looking-glass at any time, you will make\r\nit dim and damp directly with the water that is contained in your\r\nbreath.\r\n\r\nWe also breathe out animal matter, little particles of our own bodies\r\njust ready to decay. We can not see them, but they soon give the air a\r\nclose, disagreeable smell. Good air has no smell at all.\r\n\r\nAnd now I have something to say to you about the use of noses.\r\n\r\nI dare say you can not see much use in the sense of smell. Seeing,\r\nhearing, touching, are very needful to us, we all know; but as to\r\nsmelling, that does not seem to have any particular value.\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to smell a sweet rose or violet; and, I believe, smelling\r\nreally forms a good part of what we call tasting.\r\n\r\nOf all our senses, smell is the one that soonest gets out of practice.\r\nIf people would always accustom themselves to use their noses, they\r\nnever would consent to live in the horrid air they do.\r\n\r\nIf you go from the fresh air into a close room, you will notice the\r\nsmell at once. Then, if you remain there, you will soon get accustomed\r\nto the smell and not notice it; but it will still be there, and will be\r\ndoing you a great deal of harm.\r\n\r\nIn good air there are, mainly, two sorts of gas.\r\n\r\nThe first is a very lively sort of gas, called oxygen; it is very fond\r\nof joining itself with other things, and burning them, and things burn\r\nvery fast indeed in oxygen.\r\n\r\nThe second is a very slow, dull gas, called nitrogen; and nothing will\r\nburn in it at all. Pure oxygen would be too active for us to live in, so\r\nit is mixed with nitrogen.\r\n\r\nWhen we breathe, the air goes down into our lungs, which are something\r\nlike sponges, inside our chests.\r\n\r\nThese sponges have in them an immense quantity of little blood-vessels,\r\nand great numbers of little air-vessels; so that the blood almost\r\ntouches the air; there is only a very, very thin skin between them.\r\n\r\nThrough that skin, the blood sends away the waste and useless things it\r\nhas collected from all parts of the body, and takes in the fresh oxygen\r\nwhich the body wants.\r\n\r\nYou have often heard man\'s life compared to a candle. I will show you\r\nsome ways in which they are much alike.\r\n\r\nWhen a candle or lamp burns, if we keep it from getting any new air, it\r\nsoon uses all the lively gas, or oxygen, and then it goes out. This is\r\neasily shown by placing a glass jar over a lighted candle.\r\n\r\nIf the candle gets only a little fresh air, it burns dim and weak. If we\r\nget only a little fresh air, we are sickly and weak.\r\n\r\nThe candle makes another kind of gas. It is called carbonic acid gas,\r\nwhich, is unhealthy and not fit for breathing. The heat of our bodies\r\nalso makes this gas, and we throw it off in our breath.\r\n\r\nOxygen and carbon, in a separate condition, make up a good part of our\r\nflesh, blood, and bones; but when they are joined together, and make\r\ncarbonic acid gas, they are of no further use to us.\r\n\r\nYou might go to a store and buy sand and sugar; but if they became mixed\r\ntogether as you brought them home, you would not be able to use either\r\none of them, unless some clever fairy could pick them apart for you.\r\n\r\nYou see now one great way of spoiling the air. How are we to get rid of\r\nthis bad air, and obtain fresh air, without being too cold?\r\n\r\nIn summer time this is quite simple, but in winter it is more difficult;\r\nbecause it is a very bad thing to be cold, and a thin, cold draught of\r\nair is especially bad.\r\n\r\nThe bad air loaded with carbonic acid gas, when we first breathe it out,\r\nis warm. Warm gases are much lighter than cold ones, therefore the bad\r\nair at first goes up to the ceiling.\r\n\r\nIf there is an opening near the top of the room, the bad air goes out;\r\nbut if there is no opening, it by and by grows cold and heavy, and comes\r\ndown again. Then we have to breathe it.\r\n\r\nIf you open the window at the top, it will let out the bad air, and you\r\nwill not feel a draught. It is not often so very cold that you cannot\r\nbear the window open, even a little way from the top, and that is the\r\nbest way of airing a room.\r\n\r\nThis is just as necessary by night as by day. People who shut in the bad\r\nair, and shut out the good air, all night long, can never expect to\r\nawake refreshed, feeling better for their sleep.\r\n\r\nWhat becomes of the carbonic acid gas which the body throws off through\r\nour breath? Can any thing pick the carbon and oxygen in it apart, and\r\nmake them fit for us to use again?\r\n\r\nYes. Every plant, every green leaf, every blade of grass, does that for\r\nus. When the sun shines on them, they pick the carbon out and send back\r\nthe oxygen for us to breathe. They keep the carbon and make that fit\r\nfor us and animals to eat.\r\n\r\nThe grass makes the carbon fit for sheep and cows, and then we eat their\r\nflesh or drink their milk; and the corn makes the carbon fit to eat; so\r\ndo potatoes, and all the other vegetables and fruits which we eat. Is\r\nnot this a wonderful arrangement?\r\n\r\nBut perhaps you think, considering what an amazing number of people\r\nthere are in the world, besides all the animals--for all creatures that\r\nbreathe, spoil the air just as we do--there can hardly be trees and\r\nplants enough to set all the air right again.\r\n\r\nRound about cities and large towns there are certainly more people than\r\nthere are trees, but in many other parts of the world there are a great\r\nmany more trees than there are people.\r\n\r\nI have heard of forests in South America so thick and so large, that the\r\nmonkeys might run along the tops of the trees for a hundred miles. So\r\nyou see there are plenty of trees in the world to do the work.\r\n\r\nBut then, how does all the bad air leave the towns and cities where men\r\nlive, and get to the forests and meadows?\r\n\r\nThe air is constantly moving about; rising and falling, sweeping this\r\nway or that way, and traveling from place to place.\r\n\r\nNot only the little particles out of our breath, but any thing that\r\ngives the air any smell, does it some harm. Even nice smells, like those\r\nof roses, are unhealthy, if shut up in a room for some time.\r\n\r\nDirty walls, ceilings, and floors give the air a musty, close, smell; so\r\ndo dirty clothes, muddy boots, cooking, and washing. Some of these ought\r\nnot to be in the house at all; others remind us to open our windows\r\nwide.\r\n\r\nAll the things I have been saying to you about pure air, apply still\r\nmore to sick people than to healthy ones.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDirections for Reading.--Read the following sentences carefully, and\r\navoid running the words together.\r\n\r\n    The good__air can not get__in at__all.\r\n\r\n    We are__apt to take__it for granted.\r\n\r\n    It__is sure to make them__ill.\r\n\r\nPoint out three other places in the lesson where similar errors are\r\nlikely to occur.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage Lesson.--Add _ment_ to each of the following words, and then\r\ngive the meaning of the words so formed.\r\n\r\n    _arrange    move    settle    encourage_\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXXI.\r\n\r\n\r\ndis tinct\'ly, _clearly; plainly_.\r\n\r\na roused\', _wakened_.\r\n\r\nre ced\'ing, _going backward or away from_\r\n\r\nvig\'i lant, _watchful; careful_.\r\n\r\nex haust\'ed, _tired out with work_.\r\n\r\npre ced\'ing, _going before_.\r\n\r\nfort\'night, _two weeks\' time_.\r\n\r\ncon vul\'sive, _irregular in movement_.\r\n\r\ntar\'ried, _delayed; remained_.\r\n\r\ngrad\'u al ly, _step by step; slowly_.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA TIMELY RESCUE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was in the month of February, 1831, a bright moonlight night, and\r\nextremely cold, that the little brig I commanded lay quietly at her\r\nanchors inside the bay.\r\n\r\nWe had had a hard time of it, beating about for eleven days, with\r\ncutting north-easters blowing, and snow and sleet falling for the\r\ngreater part of the time.\r\n\r\nWhen at length we made the port, all hands were almost exhausted, and we\r\ncould not have held out two days longer without relief.\r\n\r\n"A bitter cold night, Mr. Larkin," I said to my mate, as I tarried for a\r\nmoment on deck to finish my pipe. "The tide is running out swift and\r\nstrong; it will be well to keep a sharp look-out for this floating ice,\r\nMr. Larkin."\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay, sir," answered the mate, and I went below.\r\n\r\nTwo hours afterwards I was aroused from a sound sleep by the vigilant\r\nofficer. "Excuse me for disturbing you, captain," said he, as he\r\ndetected an expression of vexation on my face; "but I wish you would\r\nturn out, and come on deck as soon as possible."\r\n\r\n"Why--what\'s the matter, Mr. Larkin?"\r\n\r\n"Why, sir, I have been watching a cake of ice that swept by at a little\r\ndistance a moment ago; I saw something black upon it--something that I\r\nthought moved."\r\n\r\nWe were on deck before either spoke another word. The mate pointed out,\r\nwith no little difficulty, the cake of ice floating off to leeward, and\r\nits white, glittering surface was broken by a black spot.\r\n\r\n"Get me a spy-glass, Mr. Larkin--the moon will be out of that cloud in a\r\nmoment, and then we can see distinctly." I kept my eye on the receding\r\nmass of ice, while the moon was slowly working its way through a heavy\r\nbank of clouds.\r\n\r\nThe mate stood by with a spy-glass. When the full light fell at last\r\nupon the water, I put the glass to my eye. One glance was enough..\r\n\r\n"Forward, there!" I shouted at the top of my voice; and with, one bound\r\nI readied the main hatch, and began to clear away the ship\'s cutter. Mr.\r\nLarkin had received the glass from my hand to take a look for himself.\r\n\r\n"O, pitiful sight!" he said in a whisper, as he set to work to aid me in\r\ngetting out the boat; "there are two children on that cake of ice!"\r\n\r\nIn a very short space of time we launched the cutter, into which Mr.\r\nLarkin and myself jumped, followed by two men, who took the oars. I held\r\nthe tiller, and the mate sat beside me.\r\n\r\n"Do you see that cake of ice with something black upon it, lads?" I\r\ncried; "put me alongside of that, and I will give you a month\'s extra\r\nwages when you are paid off."\r\n\r\nThe men were worn out by the hard duty of the preceding fortnight; and,\r\nthough they did their best, the boat made little more way than the tide.\r\nThis was a long chase; and Mr. Larkin, who was suffering as he saw how\r\nlittle we gained, cried out--\r\n\r\n"Pull, lads--I\'ll double the captain\'s prize. Pull, lads, for the sake\r\nof mercy, pull!"\r\n\r\nA convulsive effort at the oars told how willing the men were to obey,\r\nbut their strength was gone. One of the poor fellows splashed us twice\r\nin recovering his oar, and then gave out; the other was nearly as far\r\ngone. Mr. Larkin sprung forward and seized the deserted oar.\r\n\r\n"Lie down in the bottom of the boat," said he to the man; "and, captain,\r\ntake the other oar; we must row for ourselves." I took the second man\'s\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nLarkin had stripped to his Guernsey shirt; as he pulled the bow I waited\r\nthe signal stroke. It came gently, but firmly; and the next moment we\r\nwere pulling a long, steady stroke, gradually increasing in rapidity\r\nuntil the wood seemed to smoke in the oar-locks.\r\n\r\nWe kept time with each other by our long, deep breathing. Such a pull!\r\nAt every stroke the boat shot ahead like an arrow. Thus we worked at the\r\noars for fifteen minutes--it seemed to me as many hours.\r\n\r\n"Have we almost come to it, Mr. Larkin?" I asked.\r\n\r\n"Almost, captain,--don\'t give up: for the love of our dear little ones\r\nat home, don\'t give up, captain," replied Larkin.\r\n\r\nThe oars flashed as the blades turned up to the moonlight. The men who\r\nplied them were fathers, and had fathers\' hearts; the strength which\r\nnerved them at that moment was more than human.\r\n\r\nSuddenly Mr. Larkin stopped pulling, and my heart for a moment almost\r\nceased its beating; for the terrible thought that he had given out\r\ncrossed my mind. But I was quickly reassured by his saying--\r\n\r\n"Gently, captain, gently--a stroke or two more--there, that will\r\ndo"--and the next moment the boat\'s side came in contact with something.\r\n\r\nLarkin sprung from the boat upon the ice. I started up, and, calling\r\nupon the men to make fast the boat to the ice, followed.\r\n\r\nWe ran to the dark spot in the centre of the mass, and found two little\r\nboys--the head of the smaller nestling in the bosom of the larger. Both\r\nwere fast asleep!\r\n\r\nThey were benumbed with cold, and would surely have frozen to death, but\r\nfor our timely rescue.\r\n\r\nMr. Larkin grasped one of the lads, cut off his shoes, tore off his\r\njacket; and then, loosening his own garments to the skin, placed the\r\nchilled child in contact with his own warm body, carefully wrapping over\r\nhim his great-coat.\r\n\r\nI did the same with the other child; and we then returned to the boat;\r\nand the men having partly recovered, pulled slowly back.\r\n\r\nThe children, as we learned when we afterwards had the delight of\r\nreturning them to their parents, were playing on the ice, and had\r\nventured on the cake.\r\n\r\nA movement of the tide set the ice in motion, and the little fellows\r\nwere borne away on that cold night, and would certainly have perished,\r\nhad not Mr. Larkin seen them as the ice was sweeping out to sea.\r\n\r\n"How do you feel?" I said to the mate, the next morning after this\r\nadventure.\r\n\r\n"A little stiff in the arms, captain," the noble fellow replied, while\r\nthe big tears of grateful happiness gushed from his eyes--"a little\r\nstiff in the arms, captain, but very easy here," and he laid his hand on\r\nhis manly heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage Lesson.--Change the following _commands_ to _statements_.\r\n\r\n    Take the other oar.

As the towns-people had not expected him, no preparation had\r\nbeen made to receive him with honor; and the merchants stood in little\r\ngroups, and consulted together with, a look of anxiety upon their faces.\r\n\r\n"What is to be done?" asked one.\r\n\r\n"I do not know," replied another. "If his Royal Highness does not give\r\nus notice of his coming, how can we entertain him in a proper manner?"\r\n\r\n"Would it be well to ask him to come to one of our homes?" inquired a\r\nthird.\r\n\r\n"No, no!" cried another. "We could not ask him to partake of our humble\r\nfare, or even come to our homes, after the splendor to which he has been\r\naccustomed. For my part, I shall go home to dinner."\r\n\r\n"And I also," said the first one. "I do not care to remain here, and\r\nstare at the Prince, when we have nothing to offer."\r\n\r\nThen one by one, the merchants slipped away, afraid or ashamed to ask\r\nthe great Prince to their homes.\r\n\r\nPrince George and the officer wondered at seeing the merchants\r\ndisappear. At last there was but one man left, and as he walked toward\r\nthe Prince, he bowed low, and said--\r\n\r\n"Excuse me, sir; are you the husband of our Queen Anne, as folks here\r\nsay you are?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, I am," was the answer; "and have come for a few hours to see the\r\nsights of the good town of Bristol."\r\n\r\n"Sir," said the man, "I have seen with much distress that none of our\r\ngreat merchants have invited you to their homes. Think not, sir, that it\r\nis because they are wanting in love and loyalty. They doubtless were all\r\nafraid to ask one so high as yourself to dine with them.\r\n\r\n"I am one John Duddlestone, sir, only a bodice-maker, and I pray you not\r\nto take it amiss if I ask you and the gentleman who is with, you, to\r\ncome to my humble home, where you will be most welcome."\r\n\r\n"Indeed," answered the Prince, laughing, "I am only too delighted to\r\naccept your kind invitation, and I thank you for it very heartily. If\r\nyou lead the way, we will follow at once."\r\n\r\nSo Prince George, the officer, and Duddlestone, passed out of the\r\nExchange together.\r\n\r\n"Ours is but humble fare," said Duddlestone; "for, sir, I can offer you\r\nonly roast beef and plum-pudding."\r\n\r\n"Very good, very good indeed!" exclaimed the Prince; "it is food to\r\nwhich I bring a hearty appetite."\r\n\r\nThey stopped before a small house. John pulled the latch, and, walking\r\nin, looked for his wife; but she was upstairs.\r\n\r\n"Here, wife, wife!" he called in a loud whisper, as he put his head up\r\nthe narrow staircase; "put on a clean apron, and make haste and come\r\ndown, for the Queen\'s husband and a soldier-gentleman have come to dine\r\nwith, us."\r\n\r\nAs you may think, Mrs. Duddlestone was strangely surprised at the news;\r\nbut she did not become excited; she very seldom did, I believe.\r\n\r\n"Ay, ay!" she called. "I\'m coming;" and then muttered, "The Queen\'s\r\nhusband! the Queen\'s husband! Sure, that can never be--however, I\'ll go\r\ndown and see."\r\n\r\nShe ran to her closet, and pulled out a nice, clean apron and cap, and\r\ntied, the one round her waist, and the other round her comely face,\r\nsaying all the time, "Dear me, dear me, to think of it!" and away she\r\nran down stairs, where stood her husband and the two gentlemen.\r\n\r\nThe good woman bowed low, first to one and then to the other.\r\n\r\n"Indeed, but I\'m proud," she said, turning to Prince George, "to welcome\r\nyou to our home. \'Tis but poor and humble, but we shall think more of it\r\nafter this. I\'ll hurry and get dinner at once. I dare say you are\r\nhungry, gentlemen."\r\n\r\nPrince George laughed gayly, as he thanked her for her kind welcome, and\r\nsat down.\r\n\r\nThe table was soon spread, and the Prince ate well, and appeared to\r\nenjoy himself so much, that Mrs. Duddlestone could scarcely believe he\r\nhad always been accustomed to lords and ladies and footmen, and had\r\nnever before sat down in such an humble way.\r\n\r\nPrince George inquired about their business and pleasures.\r\n\r\n"Do you never come up to London?" he asked; "I think you would find it\r\nworth your while to take a holiday some time, and see the great city."\r\n\r\n"Ah well," said Mrs. Duddlestone, "if that is not just the thing I long\r\nfor. I\'ve never been yet, nor am I likely to go, but John has been once\r\nor twice."\r\n\r\n"And why, John, have you never taken your wife as well, to see the great\r\nsights?"\r\n\r\n"Well, to say the truth," answered John, "I do not go to see the sights;\r\nfor though I\'ve been two or three times, I don\'t think I\'ve seen any.\r\n\r\n"I must needs go sometimes to buy whalebone, and other trifles which I\r\nmust have for my business here. So I just go and come back, and meddle\r\nwith none."\r\n\r\n"Well, well," said the Prince, "the next time you come to London, you\r\nmust bring your wife with you, and pay me a visit."\r\n\r\nMrs. Duddlestone clasped her fat little hands with delight.\r\n\r\n"And shall I see the Queen?" she exclaimed.\r\n\r\n"And see both the Queen and myself," answered the Prince. "Come, John,\r\nsay you will do so!"\r\n\r\n"Surely, sir," said John, "I should like to give the good woman a bit of\r\npleasure in that way, but your grand servants would shut the doors\r\nbefore us, and never let us in, perhaps."\r\n\r\n"I can soon set that right!" and taking a card from his pocket, Prince\r\nGeorge wrote a few words on it, and gave it to them.\r\n\r\n"That will gain you ready admission," he said, "and now I must leave\r\nyou. Next time we meet, I shall entertain and care for you. For the\r\npresent, I thank you for your kind welcome and good dinner, which I have\r\nheartily enjoyed."\r\n\r\nThen rising, he and the officer bade farewell to the good people and\r\ntook their leave.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage Lesson--Let pupils use other words to express what is given\r\nbelow in dark type.\r\n\r\n    I _must needs go_.\r\n\r\n    Indeed, _but I\'m proud_.\r\n\r\n    Ours is _but humble fare_.\r\n\r\n    He _pulled the latch_.\r\n\r\n    So I _meddle with none_.\r\n\r\n    To see _the great sights_.\r\n\r\nNotes.--Queen Anne ruled over England from 1702 to 1714.

"Haven\'t I\r\nwatched every bit as you\'ve used it? and haven\'t I pretty near cried to\r\nsee it go so slowly?"\r\n\r\n"Pooh! you foolish woman!" he cried.\r\n\r\n"But, John, you\'ll take me, and go to see the King and Queen?" she\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\n"Why, you silly woman, do you think I should leave you behind, when I\r\nknow you\'re nearly crazed to go?"\r\n\r\n"O John, John, you dear, good man! I\'ve mended all my dresses, and made\r\nmyself trim and neat. I\'ve seen to your coats; and all\'s done; and I\r\nfeel as if I could scarcely live till I see the Queen."\r\n\r\n"You\'d best keep alive," said her husband; "and if all goes well we\'ll\r\nstart by the coach on Monday."\r\n\r\nMonday was as lovely a day as heart could wish; and John and his wife\r\nwalked down the Bristol streets to the public-house from which the coach\r\nwas to start.\r\n\r\nIt was a great event in Mrs. Duddlestone\'s life, for she had never been\r\nbeyond her own town, except for a drive into the country in a neighbor\'s\r\ncart.\r\n\r\nThey were quiet people; but it had got about the town, that they were\r\ngoing to London to visit the Queen, and numbers came out to see them go.\r\n\r\nPerhaps some of the great merchants wished they had been simple and\r\nhumble enough to offer to entertain Prince George when he had visited\r\ntheir town.\r\n\r\nThey journeyed straight to London, where John bought his whalebone, and\r\nthen found their way to St. James\' Palace, where, presenting the\r\nPrince\'s card, they gained ready admittance.\r\n\r\nThey were shown into a room, more beautiful than any that they had ever\r\nseen. Very shortly the door opened, and the well-remembered face of\r\ntheir guest appeared. Almost before he had greeted them, a quiet-looking\r\nlady followed him, and came smilingly to greet them.\r\n\r\n"This is the Queen," said Prince George; and then, turning to her, he\r\nadded, "These are the good people who showed me such kindness in\r\nBristol."\r\n\r\nThe Queen was so gentle and courteous that neither John nor his wife\r\nfelt confused in her presence. She talked kindly to them, asking after\r\ntheir trade, and how they had fared in their journey.\r\n\r\nShe then asked them to dine with her that evening, and said dresses\r\nwould be provided for them, so that they should not feel strange by\r\nseeing that they were dressed differently from all her other guests.\r\n\r\nShe then called an attendant, and desired that refreshment should be\r\ngiven them, and that they should be well cared for, and shown all that\r\nmight interest them until dinner time.\r\n\r\nIt was a long, wonderful day to them, as they walked about from place to\r\nplace. Before dinner they were taken to the room that was prepared for\r\nthem, and there they found elegant court dresses of purple velvet ready\r\nto put on.\r\n\r\n"Surely, John, they can not be for us!" cried Mrs. Duddlestone.\r\n\r\n"Yes, but they must be! Did not the Queen say she would give us dresses?\r\nand do not these dresses look as if they had been given by a queen?"\r\n\r\n"John, I shall feel very strange before all the grand ladies!"\r\n\r\n"Then you need not, wife, for the Queen and Prince will be there; and\r\nthe others will not trouble you; but this is a queer dress. It\'s like\r\nbeing somebody else."\r\n\r\nAnd very queer they felt, as for the first time they walked down the\r\ngrand stairs, in such, splendid dresses, to dine at the Queen\'s table,\r\nwith the Queen\'s servants to wait on them.\r\n\r\n"You must go first, John," said his wife, for shyness came over her.\r\n\r\n"Be not so foolish, wife," whispered John; and, though feeling rather\r\nawkward in his new dress, he walked simply forward, as he might have\r\ndone in a friend\'s house.\r\n\r\nThe Queen met them at the door, and, turning to her other guests, who\r\nwere assembled, she said, "Gentlemen, I have to introduce to you, with\r\ngreat pleasure, the most loyal people in the town of Bristol."\r\n\r\nAt these words they all rose and bowed low, while John and his wife did\r\nthe same, and then sat down, and ate a good dinner.\r\n\r\nAfter the dinner was over, the Prince summoned John Duddlestone to the\r\nQueen.\r\n\r\nAt her command John knelt before her, and she laid a sword lightly on\r\nhis shoulder, with the words, "Rise up, Sir John Duddlestone"; and the\r\nsimple, kind-hearted bodice-maker of Bristol rose up a knight.\r\n\r\nHis wife stood by, watching with eagerness, and could hardly believe\r\nthat from plain Mistress Duddlestone she had become Lady Duddlestone.\r\n\r\nShe would, have been very proud if the Queen had laid the sword upon her\r\nalso; but she heard that was not needed. However, she was made very\r\nhappy by being called to the Queen\'s side.\r\n\r\n"Lady Duddlestone," said Her Majesty, "allow me to present you with my\r\ngold watch, in remembrance of your visit to St. James\' Palace, and of\r\nthe Prince\'s visit to Bristol, which led to our knowing two such loyal\r\nand courteous subjects."\r\n\r\nLady Duddlestone bowed lower and lower, almost unable to find any words\r\nin which to express her gratitude.\r\n\r\nA gold watch! Was it possible? Watches were not common in those times.\r\nShe had heard of watches, and had even seen some; but had never dreamt\r\nof possessing one.\r\n\r\nSuch a big beauty it was! She was glad to fall back behind the other\r\nguests, and get time to think quietly, and realize that all was true,\r\nand not a dream from which she would wake, and find herself in her\r\nlittle attic bed-room at Bristol.\r\n\r\nQueen Anne then spoke to Sir John, offering to give him a position under\r\nGovernment; but he begged to be excused.\r\n\r\n"It would be strange, your Majesty, very strange, up in London, and my\r\nwork at Bristol suits me far the best. We want for nothing, and should\r\nnever feel so well and home-like as in our little house at Bristol."\r\n\r\nThe Queen understood him, and did not press him; and in another day or\r\ntwo the couple were again on their way home.\r\n\r\n"You\'re glad, wife, that we\'re going home?" John asked; "and you think I\r\ndid well not to take some office in London?"\r\n\r\n"Well! You could have clone no better. It\'s been grand to see, and grand\r\nto hear; but it would be very strange and uncomfortable to live always\r\nlike that, and I\'ll be right glad to be back once more.\r\n\r\n"I\'m more than proud of it all. But I should never like our own room, in\r\nwhich Prince George sat so home-like with us, to belong to another."\r\n\r\n"No, no--we will keep our own snug home," replied John with earnestness.\r\n\r\nAnd so they did, living on quietly as of old; and the only display ever\r\nmade by Lady Duddlestone was, that whenever she went to church or to\r\nmarket, she always wore the Queen\'s big gold watch.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage Lesson.--Let pupils use other words to express the meaning of\r\nwhat is given below in dark type.\r\n\r\n    You\'d _best keep_ alive.\r\n\r\n    It\'s been _grand_ to see.\r\n\r\n    _Then you need not_.\r\n\r\n    You\'re _nearly crazed to go_.\r\n\r\n_Attendant_ is made up of two parts--the stem, _attend_, and the\r\nending, _ant_ (meaning one who).\r\n\r\nThe meaning of the word _attendant_ is _one who attends_.\r\n\r\nMake out an _analysis_ of the last two lessons, and use it in telling\r\nthe story in your own words.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXXV.\r\n\r\n\r\npre sume\', _suppose; think without being sure_.\r\n\r\nmus\'cles, _those parts of the body which give us\r\n  motion, and by which we exert our strength_.\r\n\r\nex tent\', _space; distance_.\r\n\r\nor\'di na ry, _common; usual_.\r\n\r\nknowl\'edge, _that which is known through study_.\r\n\r\nde gree\', _measure, as of space or time_.\r\n\r\nspent, _used up; exhausted_.\r\n\r\nsnapped, _broken off_.\r\n\r\nde tached\', _taken away from_.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHY AN APPLE FALLS.\r\n\r\n\r\n"Father," said Lucy, "I have been reading to-day that Sir Isaac Newton\r\nwas led to make a great discovery, by seeing an apple fall from a tree.\r\nWhat was there wonderful about the apple falling?"\r\n\r\n"Nothing very wonderful in that," replied her father; "but it set him to\r\nthinking of what made it fall."\r\n\r\n"Why, I could have told him that," said Lucy; "because the stem snapped\r\nand there was nothing to support it."\r\n\r\n"And what then?" asked her father.\r\n\r\n"Why, then, of course it must fall."\r\n\r\n"Ah!" said her father, "that is the point: why must it fall?"\r\n\r\n"I am sure I don\'t know," said Lucy. "I presume it was because there was\r\nnothing to keep it up."\r\n\r\n"Well, Lucy, suppose there was not--does it follow that it must come to\r\nthe ground?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, certainly," replied Lucy, wonderingly.\r\n\r\n"Let us see," said her father; "but first answer this question: What is\r\nan animate object?"\r\n\r\n"Any thing that has animal life, and power to move at will," replied\r\nLucy.\r\n\r\n"Very good," said her father; "now, what is an inanimate object?"\r\n\r\n"Any thing that does not possess animal life, or can not move at will."\r\n\r\n"Very good again," said her father. "Now an apple is, of course, an\r\ninanimate object; and therefore it could not move itself, and Sir Isaac\r\nNewton thought that he would try to find out what power moved it."\r\n\r\n"Well, then," said Lucy; "did he find that the apple fell, because it\r\nwas forced to fall?"\r\n\r\n"Yes," replied her father; "he found that there was some force outside\r\nof the apple itself that acted upon it, otherwise it would have remained\r\nforever where it was, no matter if it were detached from the tree."\r\n\r\n"Would it, indeed?" asked Lucy.\r\n\r\n"Yes, without doubt," replied her father, "for there are only two ways\r\nin which it could be moved--by its own power of motion, or the power of\r\nsomething else moving it. Now the first power, you know it does not\r\nhave; so the cause of its motion must be the second."\r\n\r\n"But every thing falls to the ground as well as an apple, when there is\r\nnothing to keep it up," said Lucy.\r\n\r\n"True. There must therefore be some power or force which causes things\r\nto fall," said her father.\r\n\r\n"And what is it?" asked Lucy.\r\n\r\n"If things away from the earth can not move themselves to it," said her\r\nfather, "there can be no other cause of their falling than that the\r\nearth pulls them."\r\n\r\n"But," said Lucy, "the earth is no more animate than they are; so how\r\ncan it pull?"\r\n\r\n"That is not an ordinary question, but I will try an explanation," said\r\nher father. "Sir Isaac Newton discovered that there was a law in nature\r\ncalled attraction, and that all bodies exert this force upon each\r\nother. The greater the body, the greater is its power of attraction.\r\n\r\n"Now, the earth is an immense mass of matter, with which nothing near it\r\ncan compare in size. It draws therefore with mighty force all things\r\nwithin its reach, which is the cause of their falling. Do you understand\r\nthis?"\r\n\r\n"I think that I do," said Lucy; "the earth is like a great magnet."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said her father; "but the attraction of the magnet is of a\r\nparticular kind and is only over iron, while the attraction of the earth\r\nacts upon every thing alike."\r\n\r\n"Then it is pulling you and me at this moment!" said Lucy.\r\n\r\n"Certainly it is," replied her father; "and as I am the larger, it is\r\npulling me with more force than it is pulling you. This attraction is\r\nwhat gives every thing weight.\r\n\r\n"If I lift up any thing, I am acting against this force, for which\r\nreason the article seems heavy; and the more matter it contains, the\r\ngreater is the force of attraction and the heavier it appears to me."\r\n\r\n"Then," said Lucy, "if this attraction is so powerful, why do we not\r\nstick to the ground?"\r\n\r\n"Because," replied her father, "we are animate beings, and have the\r\npower of motion, by which, to a limited degree, we overcome the\r\nattraction of the earth."\r\n\r\n"Well then, father," said Lucy, "if our power of motion can overcome the\r\nattraction, why can not we jump a mile high as well as a foot?"\r\n\r\n"Because," replied her father, "as I said before, we can only overcome\r\nthe attraction to a certain extent. As soon as the force our muscles\r\ngive to the jump is spent, the attraction of the earth pulls us back."\r\n\r\n"Did Sir Isaac Newton think of all these things, because he saw the\r\napple fall?" inquired Lucy.\r\n\r\n"Yes; of all these and many more. He was a man of great knowledge. The\r\nname by which the force he discovered is generally known, is the\r\nAttraction of Gravitation, and some time you will learn how this force\r\nkeeps the earth, and the sun, moon, and stars, all in their places."\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nen\'vy, _wish one\'s self in another\'s place_.\r\n\r\ndoffed, _took off, as an article of dress_.\r\n\r\nblithe, _very happy; gay_.\r\n\r\nfee, _what is received as pay for service done_.\r\n\r\nboast, _object of pride_.\r\n\r\nquoth, _spoke_.\r\n\r\nhale, _in good health; strong_.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MILLER OF THE DEE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  There dwelt a miller, hale and bold,\r\n    Beside the river Dee;\r\n  He worked and sang from morn till night--\r\n    No lark so blithe as he;\r\n  And this the burden of his song\r\n    Forever used to be:\r\n  "I envy nobody--no, not I,\r\n    And nobody envies me!"\r\n\r\n  "Thou\'rt wrong, my friend," said good King Hal;\r\n    "As wrong as wrong can be;\r\n  For could my heart be light as thine,\r\n    I\'d gladly change with thee.\r\n  And tell me now, what makes thee sing,\r\n    With voice so loud and free.\r\n  While I am sad, though I\'m a king,\r\n    Beside the river Dee?"\r\n\r\n  The miller smiled and doffed his cap:\r\n    "I earn my bread," quoth he;\r\n  "I love my wife, I love my friend,\r\n    I love my children three;\r\n  I owe no penny I can not pay;\r\n    I thank the river Dee,\r\n  That turns the mill that grinds the corn\r\n    That feeds my babes and me."\r\n\r\n  "Good friend," said Hal, and sighed the while,\r\n    "Farewell! and happy be!\r\n  But say no more, if thou\'dst be true,\r\n    That no one envies thee.\r\n  Thy mealy cap is worth my crown;\r\n    Thy mill, my kingdom\'s fee;\r\n  Such men as thou are England\'s boast,\r\n    O miller of the Dee!"\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDirections for Reading.--In the second stanza of the lesson, _wrong_\r\nbecomes very _emphatic_ on account of _repetition_ (being repeated a\r\nnumber of times). _My_ and _thine_, in the same stanza, are\r\n_emphatic_ on account of _contrast_ (contrary meaning of the words).\r\n\r\nPoint out an example of _emphasis_ by _repetition_, and an example\r\nof _emphasis_ by _contrast_, in the third stanza.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage Lesson.--Hal = Harry = Henry.\r\n\r\nLet pupils place _un_ before each of the following words, and give\r\ntheir meaning.\r\n\r\n    changed    burdened    envied\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nfero\'cious, _savage; fierce_.\r\n\r\nrosette\', _an article made to resemble a rose_.\r\n\r\naban\'doned, _left forever; given up_.\r\n\r\nencoun\'ter, _meet face to face_.\r\n\r\nin\'fluence, _power over others_.\r\n\r\nkeen, _sharp; piercing_.\r\n\r\nreputa\'tion, _what is known of a person_.\r\n\r\nwit\'ness, _see or know by personal presence_.\r\n\r\ntrail, _track; footsteps_.\r\n\r\nalert\', _on the watch; careful_.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE JAGUAR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe jaguar, or as he is sometimes called, the American tiger, is the\r\nlargest and most ferocious of the cat family found on this continent.\r\n\r\nSome jaguars have been seen equal in size to the Asiatic tiger; but in\r\nmost cases the American, animal is smaller. He is strong enough,\r\nhowever, to drag a horse or an ox to his den--sometimes to a long\r\ndistance; and this feat has been frequently observed.\r\n\r\nThe jaguar is found in all the tropical parts of North and South\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nWhile he bears a considerable likeness to the tiger, both in shape and\r\nhabits, the markings of his skin are quite different. Instead of being\r\nstriped like the tiger, the skin of the jaguar is beautifully spotted.\r\n\r\nEach spot resembles a rosette, and consists of a black ring with a\r\nsingle dark-colored spot in the middle.\r\n\r\nJaguars are not always of the same color; some have skins of an orange\r\ncolor, and these are the most beautiful. Others are lighter colored; and\r\nsome few have been seen that were very nearly white.\r\n\r\nThere, is a "black jaguar," which is thought to be of a different\r\nspecies. It is larger and fiercer than the other kinds, and is found\r\nonly in South America.\r\n\r\nThis animal is more dreaded by the inhabitants than the other kinds and\r\nis said always to attack man wherever it may encounter him. All the\r\nother beasts fear it.\r\n\r\nIts roar produces terror and confusion among them and causes them to\r\nflee in every direction. It is never heard by the natives without a\r\nfeeling of fear, and no wonder; for a year does not pass without a\r\nnumber of these people falling victims to its ferocity.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult for one living in a country where such fierce animals\r\nare unknown, to believe that they have an influence over man, to such\r\nan extent as to prevent his settling in a particular place; yet such is\r\nthe fact.\r\n\r\nIn many parts of South America, not only plantations, but whole\r\nvillages, have been abandoned solely from fear of the jaguars.\r\n\r\nThere are men, however, who can deal single-handed with the jaguar; and\r\nwho do not fear to attack the brute in its own haunts.\r\n\r\nThey do not trust to fire-arms, but to a sharp spear. On their left arm\r\nthey carry a strong shield.\r\n\r\nThis shield is held forward and is usually seized by the jaguar. While\r\nit is busied with this, the hunter thrusts at the animal with his sharp\r\nspear, and generally with deadly effect.\r\n\r\nA traveler in South America relates the following incident as having\r\ncome under his observation:\r\n\r\n"Desiring to witness a jaguar hunt, I employed two well-known Indian\r\nhunters, and set out for the forest. The names of these hunters were\r\nNi\xc3\xb1o and Guapo. Both of them had long been accustomed to hunt the\r\njaguar, and I felt perfectly safe in their company.\r\n\r\n"Guapo, the larger of the two, was a man of wonderful muscular power,\r\nand had the reputation of having at one time killed a black jaguar with\r\nonly a stout club.\r\n\r\n"When all the preparations had been made for our start, we looked as if\r\nwe might capture all the jaguars that came in our way.\r\n\r\n"Some hours after we had entered the forest, the quick eye of Guapo\r\ndiscovered the trail of a large jaguar which he assured me was recently\r\nmade.\r\n\r\n"Stopping for a moment, both Guapo and Ni\xc3\xb1o looked carefully about in\r\nevery direction, and listened attentively, in order that they might see\r\nor hear the animal if he were near.\r\n\r\n"Then motioning me to follow at a little distance behind them, they\r\nstepped off quietly in the direction of the trail, Guapo being about\r\nthirty feet in advance of Ni\xc3\xb1o.\r\n\r\n"We went forward in this manner several hundred yards, not a word being\r\nspoken, and the keen eyes of both the hunters constantly on the alert.\r\n\r\n"Guapo, in the meantime, who seemed to have no fear and became more and\r\nmore excited as he approached to where he thought the animal must be,\r\nhad increased the distance between himself and Ni\xc3\xb1o considerably.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"Suddenly a terrific roar, and at the same time a cry of pain and a\r\nshout, warned us that Guapo had met the jaguar.\r\n\r\n"Ni\xc3\xb1o bounded forward, and I followed as quickly as I could. A fearful\r\nsight met our eyes!\r\n\r\n"The jaguar, which had been hiding in the branches of a large tree, had\r\nsprung down upon Guapo and fastened its terrible teeth in his thigh.\r\n\r\n"With a shout filled with fury and determination, Ni\xc3\xb1o at once sprung\r\nforward and savagely attacked the beast with his spear.\r\n\r\n"This caused the jaguar to let go its hold of Guapo, who, made furious\r\nfrom the pain of the wound the animal had given him, turned, and with\r\nhis spear attacked it with a mad ferocity as savage as that of the\r\nbeast itself.\r\n\r\n"In a moment all was over, and the jaguar lay dead at our feet. I\r\ndressed Guapo\'s wound the best I could, while Ni\xc3\xb1o took the skin from\r\nthe body of the animal, which proved to be nearly eight feet long.\r\n\r\n"We returned very slowly to the village with the wounded man and our\r\nprize. In a few weeks Guapo had entirely recovered from his wounds, and\r\nwas ready for another hunt."\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDirections for Reading.--Let pupils pronounce in concert, and singly,\r\nthe following words: _O, most, ferocious, only, whole, hold, slowly,\r\nover, both, roar_.\r\n\r\nWhat tone of voice should be used in reading this lesson?\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage Lesson.--Place _re_ before each of the following words, and\r\nthen give the meaning of each.\r\n\r\n    turned    told    join    capture    call\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXXVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\ndikes, _high banks of earth_.\r\n\r\ncon\'tra ry, _quite different from what is usual_.\r\n\r\ndis as\'trous, _causing great loss or suffering_.\r\n\r\nkeels, _strong timbers extending along the bottom of boats_.\r\n\r\nstork, _a kind of bird_.\r\n\r\nbus\'tle, _quick and excited motion_.\r\n\r\nmire, _soft and wet earth_.\r\n\r\nscorn\'ing, _turning from any thing as if of no value_.\r\n\r\nsat\'u rat ed, _wet through and through_.\r\n\r\nmoored, _tied fast, as a ship to land_.\r\n\r\nslouched, _hung down_.\r\n\r\nmim\'ic, _copied in a smaller form_.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOLLAND.\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\n\r\nHolland is one of the queerest countries under the sun. It should be\r\ncalled Odd-land, or Contrary-land; for, in nearly every thing, it is\r\ndifferent from other parts of the world.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, a large portion of the country is lower than the\r\nlevel of the sea. Great dikes have been built at a heavy cost of money\r\nand labor, to keep the ocean where it belongs.\r\n\r\nOn certain parts of the coast it sometimes leans with all its weight\r\nagainst the land, and it is as much as the poor country can do to stand\r\nthe pressure.\r\n\r\nSometimes the dikes give way, or spring a leak, and the most disastrous\r\nresults follow. They are high and wide, and the tops of some of them are\r\ncovered with buildings and trees. They have even fine public roads upon\r\nthem, from which horses may look down upon wayside cottages.\r\n\r\nOften the keels of floating ships are higher than the roofs of the\r\ndwellings. The stork, on the house-peak, may feel that her nest is\r\nlifted far out of danger, but the croaking frog in the neighboring\r\nbulrushes is nearer the stars than she.\r\n\r\nWater-bugs dart backward and forward above the heads of the chimney\r\nswallows; and willow-trees seem drooping with shame, because they can\r\nnot reach so high as the reeds near by.\r\n\r\nDitches, canals, ponds, rivers, and lakes are every-where to be seen.\r\nHigh, but not dry, they shine in the sunlight, catching nearly all the\r\nbustle and the business, quite scorning the tame fields, stretching\r\ndamply beside them. One is tempted to ask: "Which is Holland--the shores\r\nor the water?"\r\n\r\nThe very verdure that should be confined to the land has made a mistake\r\nand settled upon the fish ponds. In fact the entire country is a kind of\r\nsaturated sponge, or, as the English poet Butler called it--\r\n\r\n    "A land that rides at anchor, and is moored,\r\n    In which they do not live, but go aboard."\r\n\r\nPersons are born, live, and die, and even have their gardens on\r\ncanal-boats. Farmhouses, with roofs like great slouched hats pulled over\r\ntheir eyes, stand on wooden legs, with a tucked up sort of air, as if to\r\nsay, "We intend to keep dry if we can."\r\n\r\nEven the horses wear a wide stool on each hoof to lift them out of the\r\nmire.\r\n\r\nIt is a glorious country in summer for bare-footed girls and boys. Such\r\nwadings! Such mimic ship sailing! Such rowing, fishing, and swimming!\r\nOnly think of a chain of puddles where one can launch chip boats all\r\nday long, and never make a return trip!\r\n\r\nBut enough. A full recital would set all Young America rushing in a body\r\ntoward the Zuyder Zee.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDirections for Reading.--In reading the first line of page 187, there\r\nwill be a slight rising of the voice after each of the words,\r\n_ditches\', canals\', ponds\', rivers\'_, and a slight falling of the voice\r\nafter _lakes\'_.[11]\r\n\r\nThis rising or falling of the voice is called _inflection_, and may be\r\nindicated as above.\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage Lesson.--What is the meaning of "Young America"?\r\n\r\n\r\n[11] See paragraph 7.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXXIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nfreight, _cargo; that which forms a load_.\r\n\r\nconvey\'ance, _the act of carrying_.\r\n\r\njum\'ble, _a number of things crowded together without order_.\r\n\r\nbobbed, _cut off short_.\r\n\r\nbewil\'dering, _confusing_.\r\n\r\ngild\'ed, _covered with a thin, surface of gold_.\r\n\r\nyoked, _joined together with harness_.\r\n\r\nrare\'ly, _not often_.\r\n\r\nimpris\'oned, _shut up or confined, as in a prison_.\r\n\r\nclat\'tering, _making a loud noise_.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOLLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\nDutch cities seem, at first sight, to be a bewildering jumble of\r\nhouses, bridges, churches, and ships, sprouting into masts, steeples,\r\nand trees. In some cities boats are hitched, like horses, to their\r\nowners\' door-posts, and receive their freight from the upper windows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMothers scream to their children not to swing on the garden gate for\r\nfear they may be drowned. Water roads are more frequent there than\r\ncommon roads and railroads; water-fences, in the form of lazy green\r\nditches, inclose pleasure-ground, farm, and garden.\r\n\r\nSometimes fine green hedges are seen; but wooden fences, such as we\r\nhave in America, are rarely met with in Holland. As for stone fences, a\r\nHollander would lift his hands with astonishment at the very idea.\r\n\r\nThere is no stone there excepting those great masses of rock that have\r\nbeen brought from other lands to strengthen and protect the coast.\r\n\r\nAll the small stones or pebbles, if there ever were any, seem to be\r\nimprisoned in pavements, or quite melted away. Boys, with strong, quick\r\narms, may grow from aprons to full beards without ever finding one to\r\nstart the water-rings, or set the rabbits flying.\r\n\r\nThe water roads are nothing less than canals crossing the country in\r\nevery direction. These are of all sizes, from the great North Holland\r\nShip Canal, which is the wonder of the world, to those which a boy can\r\nleap.\r\n\r\nWater-omnibuses constantly ply up and down these roads for the\r\nconveyance of passengers; and water-drays are used for carrying fuel and\r\nmerchandise.\r\n\r\nInstead of green country lanes, green canals stretch from field to barn,\r\nand from barn to garden; and the farms are merely great lakes pumped\r\ndry. Some of the busiest streets are water, while many of the country\r\nroads are paved with brick.\r\n\r\nThe city boats, with their rounded sterns, gilded bows, and gayly-painted\r\nsides, are unlike any others under the sun; a Dutch wagon with its\r\nfunny little crooked pole is a perfect mystery of mysteries.\r\n\r\nOne thing is clear, you may think that the inhabitants need never be\r\nthirsty. But no, Odd-land is true to itself still. With the sea pushing\r\nto get in, and the lakes struggling to get out, and the overflowing\r\ncanals, rivers, and ditches, in many districts there is no water that is\r\nfit to swallow.\r\n\r\nOur poor Hollanders must go dry, or send far inland for that precious\r\nfluid, older than Adam, yet young as the morning dew.\r\n\r\nSometimes, indeed, the inhabitants can swallow a shower, when they are\r\nprovided with any means of catching it; but generally they are like the\r\nsailors told of in a famous poem, who saw\r\n\r\n    "Water, water, every-where,\r\n    Nor any drop to drink!"\r\n\r\nGreat flapping windmills all over the country make it look as if flocks\r\nof huge sea birds were just settling upon it.

Now for a leap!\r\n  Now for a madcap galloping chase!\r\n  I\'ll make a commotion in every place!"\r\n\r\n  So it swept with a bustle right through a great town,\r\n  Creaking the signs and scattering down\r\n  Shutters, and whisking with merciless squalls,\r\n  Old women\'s bonnets and gingerbread stalls.\r\n  There never was heard a much lustier shout,\r\n  As the apples and oranges tumbled about.\r\n\r\n  Then away to the fields it went blustering and humming,\r\n  And the cattle all wondered whatever was coming.\r\n  It pulled by their tails the grave, matronly cows,\r\n  And tossed the colts\' manes all about their brows,\r\n  Till, offended at such a familiar salute,\r\n  They all turned their backs and stood silently mute.\r\n\r\n  So on it went, capering and playing its pranks;\r\n  Whistling with  reeds on  the broad  river banks;\r\n  Puffing the birds, as they sat on  the spray,\r\n  Or the traveler grave on the king\'s highway.\r\n  It was not too nice to hustle the bags\r\n  Of the beggar, and flutter his dirty rags.\r\n  \'Twas so bold that it feared not to play its joke\r\n  With the doctor\'s wig, and the gentleman\'s cloak.\r\n\r\n  Through the forest it roared, and cried gayly, "Now\r\n  You sturdy old oaks, I\'ll make you bow!"\r\n  And it made them bow without more ado,\r\n  Or it cracked their great branches through and through.\r\n\r\n  Then it rushed like a monster o\'er cottage and farm,\r\n  Striking their inmates with sudden alarm;\r\n  And they ran out like bees in a midsummer swarm.\r\n  There were dames with their kerchiefs tied over their caps,\r\n  To see if their poultry were free from mishaps;\r\n  The turkeys they gobbled, the geese screamed aloud,\r\n  And the hens crept to roost in a terrified crowd;\r\n  There was raising of ladders, and logs laying on,\r\n  Where the thatch from the roof threatened soon to be gone.\r\n\r\n  But the wind had passed on, and had met in a lane\r\n  With a school-boy, who panted and struggled in vain;\r\n  For it tossed him, and whirled him, then passed, and he stood\r\n  With his hat in a pool, and his shoe in the mud.\r\n\r\n  Then away went the wind in its holiday glee,\r\n  And now it was far on the billowy sea;\r\n  And the lordly ships felt its powerful blow,\r\n  And the little boats darted to and fro.\r\n\r\n  But, lo! it was night, and it sunk to rest\r\n  On the sea-birds\' rock in the gleaming west,\r\n  Laughing to think, in its frolicsome fun,\r\n  How little of mischief it really had done.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDirections for Reading.--Let some pupil in the class state the manner\r\nin which the lesson should be read.\r\n\r\nPoint out four lines that should be read more quietly than the rest of\r\nthe lesson.\r\n\r\nVary the reading by having parts of lesson read as a concert exercise.\r\n\r\nWhat effect has the repetition of the word _now_, in the second and\r\nthird lines?\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage Lesson.--Let pupils write six sentences, each containing one\r\nof the following words, used in such a manner as to show its proper\r\nmeaning: _right, write; reed, read; tied, tide_.\r\n\r\nLet pupils make out an _analysis_ of the lesson, and use it in\r\ngiving the story in their own words.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XLI.\r\n\r\n\r\nveg e ta\'tion, _every thing that grows out of the ground_.\r\n\r\nmeth\'od, _way; manner_.\r\n\r\nta\'per ing, _growing smaller toward the end_.\r\n\r\nmen\'tioned, _spoken of_.\r\n\r\nstruct\'ure, _arrangement of parts; a building of any kind_.\r\n\r\nmarsh\'y, _wet_.\r\n\r\nswamp, _low ground filled with water_.\r\n\r\nsprung, _started; begun_.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOMETHING ABOUT PLANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe name plant belongs in a general way to all vegetation, from the\r\ntiniest spear of grass or creeping flower one sees on the rocks by the\r\nbrook-side, to the largest and tallest of forest trees.\r\n\r\nPlants are divided into numerous groups of families, and the study of\r\nthe many species belonging to each family, is very interesting.\r\n\r\nThere are thousands of kinds of grasses, shrubs, and trees, scattered\r\nover the different parts of the earth, and the larger portion of them\r\nare in some way useful to mankind.\r\n\r\nIn speaking of grasses, we are apt to think only of the grass in the\r\nmeadows, which is the food for our horses and cattle; but there are\r\nother kinds of grasses which are just as important to man as the grass\r\nof the meadow is to the beast. These are oats, rye, barley, wheat, corn,\r\nand others, all of which belong to the grass family.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it appears strange to you to hear wheat and corn called grass,\r\nand you ask how can that be.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, all plants that have the same general form and\r\nmethod of growth, belong to the same family.\r\n\r\nNow, if you will pull up a stalk of grass and a stalk of wheat or rye\r\nand compare them, you will find that they are alike in all important\r\nrespects.\r\n\r\nThe roots of each look like a little bundle of strings or fibers, and\r\nare therefore called fibrous; the stalks you will find jointed and\r\nhollow; and the leaves are long and narrow, tapering to a point at their\r\nends.\r\n\r\nThen, if you examine the seeds, you will see that they are placed near\r\ntogether and form what we call an ear or head, as in an ear of corn, or\r\na head of wheat.\r\n\r\nThis same general form or structure applies to every one of the plants\r\nbelonging to the grass family; and in this family are included all the\r\ndifferent kinds of canes and reeds that grow in swamps and marshy\r\nplaces, as well as the bamboo of the tropics.\r\n\r\nShrubs are those plants which have woody stems and branches. They are\r\ngenerally of small size, rarely reaching over twenty feet in height.\r\nSmall shrubs are usually called bushes.\r\n\r\nIn this class of plants, the branches generally start close to the\r\nground, and in some cases, a little below the surface of the ground,\r\nrising and spreading out in all directions.\r\n\r\nThe common currant bushes, blackberry bushes, and rose bushes which we\r\nsee in gardens, are shrubs.\r\n\r\nSo also are grape-vines, honeysuckles, ivy, and all other creeping\r\nvines. These are called climbing plants, because little tendrils or\r\nclaspers which grow out of their branches, wind around and fasten\r\nthemselves to any thing in their way.\r\n\r\nTrees are the largest and strongest of all plants.\r\n\r\nThey have woody stems or trunks, and branches. These branches do not, as\r\nin shrubs, start close to the ground, but at some distance above, from\r\nwhich height they extend in different directions.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to believe that some of the large trees we see, sprung\r\nfrom small seeds; yet it is true that all trees started in this manner.\r\n\r\nThe seeds are scattered about by birds and tempests, and falling on the\r\nsoft ground, where they become covered with, leaves and earth, they take\r\nroot and grow.\r\n\r\nThus the little acorn sprouts, and from it springs the sturdy oak, which\r\nis not only the noblest of trees, but lives hundreds of years.\r\n\r\nThe trunks and branches of trees are protected by a covering called\r\nbark. This bark is thicker near the base or root of the tree than it is\r\nhigher up among the branches.\r\n\r\nOn some trees, the bark is very rough and shaggy looking, as on the oak,\r\nash, walnut, and pine; on others, the bark is smooth, as on the beech,\r\napple, and birch.\r\n\r\nSome trees live for only a few years, rapidly reaching their full\r\ngrowth, and rapidly decaying. The peach-tree is one of this kind.\r\n\r\nOther trees live to a great age. An elm-tree has been known to live for\r\nthree hundred years; a chestnut-tree, six hundred years; and oaks, eight\r\nhundred years.\r\n\r\nThe baobab-tree of Africa lives to be many hundred years old. There is a\r\nyew-tree in England that is known to be over two thousand years old.\r\n\r\nThe "big trees" of California are the largest in the world, although not\r\nof so great an age as some that have been mentioned. The tallest of\r\nthese trees that has yet been discovered, measures over three hundred\r\nand fifty feet in height, and the distance around it near the ground is\r\nalmost one hundred feet. The age of this tree must be between one\r\nthousand five hundred and two thousand years.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDirections for Reading.--Let, pupils pronounce in concert and singly,\r\nthe following words: _corn, stalks, important, form, tall, walnut,\r\nhorses_.\r\n\r\nIn the fifth paragraph on page 199, why are _some_ and _others_\r\nemphatic?[12]\r\n\r\nMark _inflections_ of _oak, ash, walnut_, and _pine_; and of _beech,\r\napple_, and _birch_.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage Lesson.--Place _dis_ before each of the following words,\r\nand then give the meaning of each of the words so formed.\r\n\r\n    appear    covered    able    like    believe\r\n\r\n[12] See fifth paragraph from the end of the lesson.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XLII.\r\n\r\n\r\nflush, _bright red color_.\r\n\r\nlow\'ing, _the bellowing or cry of cattle_.\r\n\r\nrang\'ing, _wandering_.\r\n\r\nin tent\', _determined_.\r\n\r\nstriv\'ing, _making great efforts_.\r\n\r\npre serve\', _keep in safety_.\r\n\r\nre flect\'ed, _shining back; thrown back, as by a looking-glass_.\r\n\r\npro ceed\'ed, _went forward_.\r\n\r\nchecked, _stopped_.\r\n\r\nblasts, _sounds made by blowing_.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FOREST ON FIRE.\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe were sound asleep one night, when, about two hours before day, the\r\nsnorting of our horses and lowing of our cattle, which were ranging in\r\nthe woods, suddenly awoke us.\r\n\r\nI took my rifle and went to the door to see what beast had caused the\r\nhubbub, when I was struck by the glare of light reflected on all the\r\ntrees before me, as far as I could see through the woods.\r\n\r\nMy horses were leaping about, snorting loudly, and the cattle ran among\r\nthem in great confusion.\r\n\r\nOn going to the back of the house I plainly heard the crackling made by\r\nthe burning brushwood, and saw the flames coming toward us in a\r\nfar-extended line.\r\n\r\nI ran to the house, told my wife to dress herself and the child as\r\nquickly as possible, and take the little money we had, while I managed\r\nto catch and saddle two of the best horses.\r\n\r\nAll this was done in a very short time, for I felt that every moment was\r\nprecious to us.\r\n\r\nWe then mounted our horses, and made off from the fire. My wife, who is\r\nan excellent rider, kept close to me; and my daughter, who was then a\r\nsmall child, I took in one arm.\r\n\r\nWhen making off, I looked back and saw that the frightful blaze was\r\nclose upon us, and had already laid hold of the house.\r\n\r\nBy good luck there was a horn attached to my hunting-clothes, and I blew\r\nit, to bring after us, if possible, the remainder of my live-stock, as\r\nwell as the dogs.\r\n\r\nThe cattle followed for a while; but before an hour had passed they all\r\nran, as if mad, through the woods, and that was the last we saw of them.\r\n\r\nMy dogs, too, although at all other times easily managed, ran after the\r\ndeer that in great numbers sprung before us as if fully aware of the\r\ndeath, that was so rapidly approaching.\r\n\r\nWe heard blasts from the horns of our neighbors as we proceeded, and\r\nknew that they were in the same unfortunate condition that we were in\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\nIntent on striving to the utmost to preserve our lives, I thought of a\r\nlarge lake, some miles off, where the flames might possibly be checked,\r\nand we might find a place of safety.\r\n\r\nUrging my wife to whip up her horse, we set off at full speed, making\r\nthe best way we could over the fallen trees and the brush heaps, which\r\nlay like so many articles placed on purpose to keep up the terrific\r\nfires that advanced with a broad front upon us.\r\n\r\nBy this time we were suffering greatly from the effects of the heat, and\r\nwe were afraid that our horses would be overcome and drop down at any\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nA singular kind of breeze was passing over our heads, and the glare of\r\nthe burning trees shone more brightly than the daylight. I was sensible\r\nof a slight faintness, and my wife looked pale.\r\n\r\nThe heat had produced such a flush in the child\'s face that, when she\r\nturned toward either of us, our grief and anxiety were greatly\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDirections for Reading.--What tone of voice should be used in reading\r\nthe lesson?\r\n\r\nShould the rate of reading be slow or rapid?\r\n\r\nPoint out two paragraphs requiring a somewhat different rate.\r\n\r\nShould the feelings expressed in the lesson be rendered in a quiet or\r\nloud tone?\r\n\r\nDifferent inflections are sometimes used, simply to give variety to the\r\nreading and not for emphasis.\r\n\r\nIn the first paragraph, mark _inflection_ of _night, day, horses,\r\ncattle, woods, us_.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XLIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nde voured\', _eaten up greedily, as by wild animals_.\r\n\r\npor\'cu pine, _a kind of animal_.\r\n\r\nsmold\'der ing,  _burning slowly; smoking_.\r\n\r\nin suf\'fer a ble, _not to be borne_.\r\n\r\nshift\'ed, _moved about; changed position_.\r\n\r\nsti\'fling, _stopping the breath_.\r\n\r\ndismal, _gloomy; cheerless_.\r\n\r\nun grate\'ful, _not thankful_.\r\n\r\nrem\'e died, _relieved; cured_.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA FOREST ON FIRE.\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\n\r\nTen miles are soon gone over on swift horses; but yet, when we reached\r\nthe borders of the lake we were quite exhausted, and our hearts failed\r\nus. The heat of the smoke was insufferable, and sheets of blazing fire\r\nflew over us in a manner beyond belief.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWe reached the shore, however, coasted the lake for a while, and got\r\nround to the sheltered side. There we gave up our horses, which we never\r\nsaw again.\r\n\r\nWe plunged down among the rushes, by the edge of the water, and laid\r\nourselves down flat, to await the chance of escaping from being burned\r\nor devoured. The water greatly refreshed us, and we enjoyed the\r\ncoolness.\r\n\r\nOn went the fire, rushing and crashing through the woods. Such a morning\r\nmay we never again see! The heavens themselves, I thought, were\r\nfrightened.\r\n\r\nAll above us was a bright, red glare, mingled with, dark, threatening\r\nclouds and black smoke, rolling and sweeping away in the distance.\r\n\r\nOur bodies were cool enough, but our heads were scorching; and the\r\nchild, who now seemed to understand the matter, cried so as nearly to\r\nbreak our hearts.\r\n\r\nThe day passed on, and we became hungry. Many wild beasts came plunging\r\ninto the water beside us, and others swam across to our side, and stood\r\nstill. Although faint and weary, I managed to shoot a porcupine, and we\r\nall tasted its flesh.\r\n\r\nThe night passed, I cannot tell you how. Smoldering fires covered the\r\nground, and the trees stood like pillars of fire, or fell across each\r\nother.\r\n\r\nThe stifling and sickening smoke still rushed over us, and the burnt\r\ncinders and ashes fell thick around us.\r\n\r\nWhen morning came, every thing about us was calm; but a dismal smoke\r\nstill filled the air, and the smell seemed worse than ever. What was to\r\nbecome of us I did not know.\r\n\r\nMy wife hugged the child to her breast, and wept bitterly; but God had\r\npreserved us through the worst of the danger, and the flames had gone\r\npast, so I thought it would be both ungrateful to Him and unmanly to\r\ndespair now.\r\n\r\nHunger once more pressed upon us, but this was soon remedied. Several\r\ndeer were standing in the water, up to the head, and I shot one of them.\r\nSome of its flesh was soon roasted, and after eating it we felt\r\nwonderfully strengthened.\r\n\r\nBy this time the blaze of the burning forest was beyond our sight,\r\nalthough the remains of the fires of the night before were still burning\r\nin many places, and it was dangerous to go among the burnt trees.\r\n\r\nAfter resting for some time, we prepared to commence our march. Taking\r\nup the child in my arms, I led the way over the hot ground and rocks;\r\nand after two weary days and nights of suffering, during which we\r\nshifted in the best manner we could, we at last succeeded in reaching\r\nthe hard woods, which had been free from the fire.\r\n\r\nSoon after we came to a house, where we were kindly treated.

It\'s all in order; and next\r\nweek it will be full, for many folks prefer it because of the quiet."\r\n\r\nAt the end of a very steep path, which offered every chance for\r\naccidents of all sorts, from a sprained ankle to a broken neck, stood\r\nthe cottage--a little white building, with a pretty vine over the door,\r\ngay flowers in the garden, and the blue Atlantic rolling up at the foot\r\nof the cliff.\r\n\r\n"A regular \'Cottage by the Sea.\' It will suit me exactly if I can have\r\nthe upper front room. I don\'t mind being alone; so have my trunk taken\r\ndown, please, and I\'ll get ready for tea," said I, feeling very happy on\r\naccount of my good luck.\r\n\r\nAlas, how little I knew what a night of terror I was to pass in that\r\npretty white cottage!\r\n\r\nAn hour later, refreshed by my tea and the coolness of the place, I\r\nplunged into the pleasures of the season, and accepted two invitations\r\nfor the evening--one to a, walk on Sunset Hill, the other to a clam-bake\r\non the beach.\r\n\r\nThe stroll came first, and on the hill-top we met an old gentleman with\r\na spy-glass, who welcomed me with the remark--\r\n\r\n"Pretty likely place for a prospect."\r\n\r\nAfter replying to what he said, I asked the old gentleman if he knew any\r\nlegend or stories about the old houses all around us.\r\n\r\n"Yes, many of them," he replied; "and it isn\'t always the old places\r\nthat have the most stories about \'em.\r\n\r\n"Why, that cottage down yonder isn\'t more\'n fifty years old, and they do\r\nsay there\'s been a lot of ghosts seen there, owin\' to a man\'s killin\' of\r\nhimself in the back bed-room."\r\n\r\n"What! that house at the end of the lane?" I asked, with sudden\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n"Just so; nice place, but lonesome and dampish. Ghosts and toadstools\r\nare apt to locate in houses of that sort," was his mild reply.\r\n\r\nThe dampness scared me more than the ghosts, for I had never seen a\r\nghost yet; but I had been haunted by rheumatism, and found it a hard\r\nthing to get rid of.\r\n\r\n"I\'ve taken a room there, so I\'m rather interested in knowing what\r\ncompany I\'m to have."\r\n\r\n"Taken a room, have you? Well, I dare say you won\'t be troubled. Some\r\nfolks have a knack of seeing spirits, and then again some haven\'t.\r\n\r\n"My wife is uncommon powerful that way, but I an\'t; my sight\'s dreadful\r\npoor for that sort."\r\n\r\nThere was such a sly look in the starboard eye of the old fellow as he\r\nspoke, that I laughed outright, and asked, sociably--\r\n\r\n"Has she ever seen the ghosts of the cottage? I think I have rather a\r\nknack that way, and I\'d like to know what to expect."\r\n\r\n"No, her sort is the rapping kind. Down yonder, the only ghost I take\r\nmuch stock in is old Bezee Tucker\'s. Some folks say they\'ve heard him\r\ngroaning there nights, and a dripping sound; he bled to death, you know.\r\n\r\n"It was kept quiet at the time, and is forgotten now by all but a few\r\nold fellows like me. Bezee was always polite to the ladies, so I guess\r\nhe won\'t bother you, ma\'am;" and the old fellow laughed.\r\n\r\n"If he does, I\'ll let you know;" and with that I left him, for I was\r\ncalled and told that the beach party was anxious for my company.\r\n\r\nIn the delights of that happy hour, I forgot the warning of the old\r\ngentleman on the hill, for I was about to taste a clam for the first\r\ntime in my life, and it was a most absorbing moment.\r\n\r\nPerched about on the rocks like hungry birds, we sat and watched the\r\nhappy cooks with breathless interest, as they struggled with\r\nfrying-pans, fish that refused to brown, steaming sea-weed, and hot\r\nashes.\r\n\r\nLittle Margie Grant waited upon me so prettily, that I should have been\r\ntempted to try a sea porcupine if she had offered it, so charming was\r\nher way of saying, "O here\'s a perfectly lovely one! Do take him by his\r\nlittle black head and eat him quick!"\r\n\r\nI indulged without thought, in clams, served hot between two shells,\r\nlittle dreaming what a price I was to pay for that banquet.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage Lesson--Let pupils use other words to express the meaning of\r\nthe parts given below in dark type.\r\n\r\n    "Right down there--_just a step_, you see."\r\n\r\n    "_Pretty likely_ place for a prospect."\r\n\r\n    "The only one I _take much stock in_."\r\n\r\nWrite out in full the words for which _\'em_ and _an\'t_ are used.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XLVI.\r\n\r\n\r\nquaked, _shook, as with fear_.\r\n\r\ncha\'os, _a great number of things without order_.\r\n\r\ngi gan\'tic, _of very great size_.\r\n\r\nstealth\'y, _very quiet, so as to escape notice_.\r\n\r\nfa\'tal, _causing great harm_.\r\n\r\nmis\'sion, _what one is sent to do_.\r\n\r\nin\'ter vals, _spaces of time_.\r\n\r\nthrill, _feeling, as of pain or pleasure_.\r\n\r\naf fect\'ing, _making a show of_.\r\n\r\na pol\'o gize, _express sorrow for an act_.\r\n\r\nret ri bu\'tion, _paying back for one\'s acts; punishment_.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA GHOST STORY.\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe staid up till late, and then I was left, at my own door by my\r\nfriends, who informed me that York was a very quiet, safe place, where\r\npeople slept with unlocked doors, and nothing ever went amiss o\' nights.\r\n\r\nI said nothing of ghosts, being ashamed to own that I quaked, a little\r\nat the idea of the "back bed-room," as I shut out the friendly faces and\r\nfastened myself in.\r\n\r\nA lamp and matches stood in the hall, and lighting the lamp, I whisked\r\nup stairs with suspicious rapidity, locking my door, and went to bed,\r\nfirmly refusing to own even to myself that I had ever heard the name of\r\nBezee Tucker.\r\n\r\nBeing very tired, I soon fell asleep; but fried potatoes and a dozen or\r\ntwo of hot clams are not kinds of food best fitted to bring quiet sleep,\r\nso a fit of nightmare brought me to a realizing sense of my foolishness.\r\n\r\nFrom a chaos of wild dreams was finally brought forth a gigantic clam,\r\nwhose mission it was to devour me as I had devoured its relatives. The\r\nsharp shells were open before me, and a solemn voice said, "Take her by\r\nher little head and eat her quick."\r\n\r\nRetribution was at hand, and, with a despairing effort to escape by\r\ndiving, I bumped my head smartly against the wall, and woke up feeling\r\nas if there was an earthquake under the bed.\r\n\r\nCollecting my scattered wits, I tried to go to sleep again; but alas!\r\nthat fatal feast had destroyed sleep, and I vainly tried to quiet my\r\nwakeful senses with the rustle of leaves about the window and the\r\nbreaking waves upon the beach.\r\n\r\nIn one of the pauses between the sounds of the waves, I heard a curious\r\nnoise in the house--a sort of moan, coming at regular intervals.\r\n\r\nAnd, as I sat up to make out where it was, another sound caught my\r\nattentive ear. Drip, drip, drip, went something out in the hall, and in\r\nan instant the tale told me on Sunset Hill came back with unpleasant\r\nreality.\r\n\r\n"Nonsense! It is raining, and the roof leaks," I said to myself, while\r\nan unpleasant thrill went through me, and fancy, aided by indigestion,\r\nbegan to people the house with ghostly inmates.\r\n\r\nNo rain had fallen for weeks, and peeping through my curtain, I saw the\r\nbig, bright stars shining in a cloudless sky; so that explanation\r\nfailed, and still the drip, drip, drip went on.\r\n\r\nLikewise the moaning--so distinctly now that it was clear that the\r\nlittle back bed-room was next the chamber in which I was quaking at that\r\nvery moment.\r\n\r\n"Some one is sleeping there," I said, and then remembered that all the\r\nrooms were locked, and all the keys but mine in Mrs. Grant\'s pocket, up\r\nat the house.\r\n\r\n"Well, let the ghosts enjoy themselves; I won\'t disturb them if they let\r\nme alone. Some of the ladies thought me brave to dare to sleep here,\r\nand it never will do to own I was scared by a foolish story and an odd\r\nsound."\r\n\r\nSo down I lay, and said the multiplication table with great\r\ndetermination for several minutes, trying to turn a deaf ear to the\r\noutside world and check my unruly thoughts.\r\n\r\nBut it was a failure; and when I found myself saying over and over "Four\r\ntimes twelve is twenty-four," I gave up affecting courage, and went in\r\nfor a good, honest scare.\r\n\r\nAs a cheerful subject for midnight consideration, I kept thinking of B.\r\nTucker, in spite of every effort to give it up. In vain I remembered the\r\nfact that the departed gentleman was "always polite to ladies."\r\n\r\nI still was in great fear lest he might think it necessary to come and\r\napologize in person for "bothering" me.\r\n\r\nPresently a clock struck three, and I gave a moan that beat the ghost\'s\r\nall hollow, so full of deep suffering was I at the thought of several\r\nhours of weary waiting.\r\n\r\nI was not sure at what time the daylight would appear, and I was\r\nbitterly sorry for not gathering useful information about sunrise,\r\ntides, and such things, instead of listening to the foolish gossip of\r\nUncle Peter on the hill-top.\r\n\r\nMinute after minute dragged slowly on, and I was just thinking that I\r\nshould be obliged to shout "Fire!" as the only means of relief in my\r\npower, when, a stealthy step under the window gave me a new feeling.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDirections for Reading.--To give greater effect to certain parts of\r\nthe lesson, read them very slowly.\r\n\r\nThe first line of the last paragraph is a good example of adding\r\n_emphasis_ by reading slowly.\r\n\r\nPoint oat two other places in the lesson where slow reading would be\r\nbest.\r\n\r\nWhat word in the last paragraph may be made very emphatic, even to the\r\nextent of using the _calling tone_ of voice?\r\n\r\nLet pupils pronounce in concert, and singly, the following words:\r\n_soon, do, two, foolish, roof, food, room_.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage Lesson.--Let pupils write statements, each containing one of\r\nthe following words, used in such a manner as to show its proper\r\nmeaning: _beech, beach; sense, scents; fourth, forth; hear, here_.\r\n\r\nGive rules for the capital letters in the first three paragraphs of the\r\nlesson.\r\n\r\nLet pupils place _un_ before each of the following words, and then\r\ndefine them.\r\n\r\n    safe    lock    heard    pleasant    fit\r\n\r\nDefine each of the following words formed from _please_, and state in\r\neach case what change of meaning occurs.\r\n\r\n    please    pleasant    pleasantly    unpleasantly\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XLVII.\r\n\r\n\r\ndag\'ger, _a short sword_.\r\n\r\nspell, _a feeling which prevents one from moving_.\r\n\r\nbran\'dished, _raised, and moved in different directions_.\r\n\r\nin spir\'ing, _making one feel_.\r\n\r\nawe, _deep fear_.\r\n\r\nde mand\'ed, _asked as a right_.\r\n\r\npunct\'u al, _always on time_.\r\n\r\nro mance, _a story of surprising adventures_.\r\n\r\nbur\'glar, _one who breaks into a house at night_.\r\n\r\ncus\'tom, _a way or a manner of doing things_.\r\n\r\nreigned, _ruled; held power_.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA GHOST STORY.\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis was a start, not a scare--for the new visitor was a human foe, and\r\nI had little fear of such, being possessed of good lungs, strong arms,\r\nand a Roman dagger nearly as big as a carving-knife.\r\n\r\nThe step that I had just heard broke the spell, and creeping noiselessly\r\nto the window, I peeped out to see a dark figure coming up the stem of\r\nthe tall tree close by, hand-over-hand, like a sailor or a monkey.\r\n\r\n"Two can play at that game, my friend; you scare me, and I\'ll scare\r\nyou." And with an actual sense of relief in breaking the silence, I\r\nsuddenly flung up the curtain, and leaned out.\r\n\r\nI brandished my dagger with what I intended to be an awe-inspiring\r\nscreech; but, owing to the flutter of my breath, the effort ended in a\r\ncurious mixture of howl and bray.\r\n\r\nA most effective sound, nevertheless; for the burglar dropped to the\r\nground as if he had been shot, and, with one upward glance at the white\r\nfigure dimly seen in the starlight, fled as if a thousand ghosts were at\r\nhis heels.\r\n\r\n"What next?" thought I, wondering whether this eventful night would ever\r\ncome to a close.\r\n\r\nI sat and waited, chilly but brave, while the strange sounds went on\r\nwithin the house and silence reigned without, till the cheerful crow of\r\nthe punctual "cockadoo," as Margie called him, told me that it was\r\nsunrise and laid the ghosts.\r\n\r\nA red glow in the east drove away my last fear, and I soon lay down and\r\nslept quietly, quite worn out.\r\n\r\nThe sun shining upon my face waked me, and a bell ringing warned me to\r\nhurry. A childish voice calling out, "Betfast is most weady, Miss Wee,"\r\nassured me that sweet little spirits haunted the cottage as well as\r\nghostly ones.\r\n\r\nAs I left my room to join Margie, who was waiting for me, I saw two\r\nthings which caused me to feel that the horrors of the night were not\r\nall unreal.\r\n\r\nJust outside the back bed-room door was a damp place, as if that part of\r\nthe floor had been newly washed; and when led by curiosity, I peeped\r\nthrough the keyhole of the haunted chamber, my eye distinctly saw an\r\nopen razor lying on a dusty table.\r\n\r\nMy seeing was limited to that one object, but it was quite enough. I\r\nwent up the hill thinking over the terrible secret hidden in my breast.\r\n\r\nI longed to tell some one, but was ashamed; and, when asked why I was so\r\npale and absent-minded, I answered with a gloomy smile--\r\n\r\n"It is the clams."\r\n\r\nAll day I hid my sufferings pretty well, but as night approached and I\r\nthought of sleeping again in that haunted cottage, my heart began to\r\nfail. As we sat telling stories in the dusk, a bright idea came into my\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nI would relate my ghost story, and rouse the curiosity of my hearers, so\r\nthat some of them would offer to stay at the cottage in hopes of seeing\r\nthe spirit of the restless Tucker.\r\n\r\nCheered by this fancy, when my turn came I made a thrilling tale about\r\nBezee Tucker and my night\'s adventure. After my hearers were worked up\r\nto a proper state of excitement, I paused for applause.\r\n\r\nIt came in a most unexpected form, however, for Mrs. Grant burst out\r\nlaughing, and the two boys--Johnny and Joe--rolled about in convulsions\r\nof merriment.\r\n\r\nMuch displeased, I demanded the cause of their laughter, and then joined\r\nin the general shout when Mrs. Grant informed me that Bezee Tucker\r\nlived, died in, and haunted the tumble-down house at the other end of\r\nthe lane, and not the cottage where I was staying.\r\n\r\n"Then who or what made those mysterious noises?" I asked, relieved but\r\nrather displeased at the downfall of my romance.\r\n\r\n"My brother Seth," replied Mrs. Grant, still laughing. "I thought you\r\nmight be afraid to be there all alone, so he slipped into the bed-room,\r\nand I forgot to tell you. He\'s a powerful snorer, and that\'s one of the\r\nawful sounds.\r\n\r\n"The other was the dripping of salt water; for you wanted some, and the\r\ngirl got it in a leaky pail. Seth swept out the water when he left the\r\ncottage early in the morning."\r\n\r\nI said nothing about having seen through the keyhole the harmless razor;\r\nbut wishing to get some praise for my heroic encounter with the burglar,\r\nI mildly asked if it was the custom in York for men as well as turkeys\r\nto roost in trees.\r\n\r\nAnother burst of laughter from the boys did away with my last hope of\r\nglory. As soon as he could speak, Joe answered--\r\n\r\n"Johnny planned to be up early to pick the last cherries off that tree.\r\nI wanted to get ahead of him, and as I was going a-fishing, I went off\r\nquietly before daylight."\r\n\r\n"Did you get the cherries?"

There are several species of the rhinoceros, some of which\r\nare found in Asia, and others in different parts of Africa.\r\n\r\nIn the latter country there are four varieties--the black rhinoceros,\r\nhaving a single horn; the black species having two horns; the\r\nlong-horned white rhinoceros; and the common white species, which has a\r\nshort, stubby horn.\r\n\r\nThe largest of the African species is the long-horned, white, or\r\nsquare-nosed rhinoceros. When full-grown, it sometimes measures eighteen\r\nfeet in length, and about the same around the body. Its horn frequently\r\nreaches a length of thirty inches.\r\n\r\nThe black rhinoceros, although much, smaller than the white, and seldom\r\nhaving a horn over eighteen inches long, is far more ferocious than the\r\nwhite species, and possesses a wonderful degree of strength.\r\n\r\nThe form of the rhinoceros is clumsy, and its appearance dull and heavy.\r\nThe limbs are thick and powerful, and each, foot has three toes, which\r\nare covered with broad, hoof-like nails.\r\n\r\nThe tail is small; the head very long and large. Taken altogether, there\r\nare few--if any--animals that compare with the rhinoceros in ugliness.\r\n\r\nThe eyes are set in such a manner that the animal can not see any thing\r\nexactly in front of it; but the senses of hearing and smelling are so\r\nkeen that sight is not required to detect an enemy, whether it be man or\r\nbeast.\r\n\r\nThe skin of the African rhinoceros is smooth, and has only a few\r\nscattering hairs here and there. It is, however, very thick and tough,\r\nand can resist the force of a rifle-ball unless it is fired from a very\r\nshort distance.\r\n\r\nThe largest known species of the rhinoceros is found in Asia. It lives\r\nchiefly in the marshy jungles, and on the banks of lakes and rivers in\r\nIndia. Some of this species are over live feet in height, and have horns\r\nthree feet in length and eighteen inches around the base.\r\n\r\nUnlike the African rhinoceros, the skin of the Asiatic species is not\r\nsmooth, but lies in thick folds upon the body, forming flaps which can\r\nbe lifted with the hand.\r\n\r\nThe food of the rhinoceros consists of roots, and the young branches and\r\nleaves of trees and shrubs.\r\n\r\nIt plows up the roots with the aid of its horn, and gathers the branches\r\nand leaves with the upper lip which is long and pointed, and with which\r\nthe food is rolled together before placing it in the mouth.\r\n\r\nThe flesh of the rhinoceros is good to eat; and its strong, thick skin\r\nis made by the natives, into shields, whips, and other articles.\r\n\r\nThough clumsy and apparently very stupid, the rhinoceros is a very\r\nactive animal when attacked or otherwise alarmed, dashing about with\r\nwonderful rapidity.\r\n\r\nIt is very fierce and savage--so much so that the natives dread it more\r\nthan they do the lion. In hunting the animal, it is dangerous for a man\r\nto fire at one unless he is mounted upon a swift horse, and can easily\r\nreach some place of safety.\r\n\r\nWhen attacking an enemy, the rhinoceros lowers its head and rushes\r\nforward like an angry goat. Though it may not see the object of its\r\nattack, the sense of smell is so acute that it knows about when the\r\nenemy is reached.\r\n\r\nThen begins a furious tossing of the head, and if the powerful horn\r\nstrikes the foe, a terrible wound is the result.\r\n\r\nWhen wounded itself, the rhinoceros loses all sense of fear, and charges\r\nagain and again with such desperate fury that the enemy is almost always\r\novercome.\r\n\r\nA famous traveler in South Africa relates the following incident that\r\nhappened during one of his hunting excursions:\r\n\r\n"Having proceeded about two miles, I came upon a black rhinoceros,\r\nfeeding on some Wait-a-bit thorns within fifty yards of me.\r\n\r\n"I fired from the saddle, and sent a bullet in behind his shoulder, when\r\nhe rushed forward, blowing like a grampus, and then stood looking about\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n"Presently he started off, and I followed. I expected that he would come\r\nto bay, but it seems a rhinoceros never does that--a fact I did not\r\nknow at that time.\r\n\r\n"Suddenly he fell flat upon the ground; but soon recovering his feet, he\r\nresumed his course as if nothing had happened.\r\n\r\n"I spurred on my horse, dashed ahead, and rode right in his path. Upon\r\nthis, the hideous monster charged me in the most resolute manner,\r\nblowing loudly through his nostrils.\r\n\r\n"Although I quickly turned about, he followed me at such a furious pace\r\nfor several hundred yards, with his horrid horny snout within a few\r\nyards of my horse\'s tail, that I thought my destruction was certain.\r\n\r\n"The animal, however, suddenly turned and ran in another direction. I\r\nhad now become so excited with the incident, that I determined to give\r\nhim one more shot any way.\r\n\r\n"Nerving my horse again, I made another dash, after the rhinoceros, and\r\ncoming up pretty close to him, I again fired, though with little\r\neffect, the ball striking some thick portion of his skin and doing no\r\nharm.\r\n\r\n"Feeling that I did not care to run the chance of the huge brute again\r\ncharging me, and believing that my rifle-ball was not powerful enough\r\nto kill him, I determined to give up the pursuit, and accordingly let\r\nhim run off while I returned to the camp."\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n      *      *      *      *      *\r\n\r\n\r\nDirections for Reading.--Let pupils mark _inflections_ in the first\r\nsentence of the lesson.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage Lesson.--Let pupils express in other words the meaning of\r\nwhat is given below in dark type.\r\n\r\n    "I expected that he would _come to bay_."\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON L.\r\n\r\n\r\nper\'il, _great danger that is near one_.\r\n\r\npru\'dent, _careful in regard to what may happen_.\r\n\r\ncon\'fi dence, _courage; freedom from doubt_.\r\n\r\noc ca\'sion, _a chance event; an incident_.\r\n\r\ntor\'rents, _violent streams, as of water_.\r\n\r\nford, _a place to cross a river_.\r\n\r\nper suad\'ed, _influenced by advice_.\r\n\r\nop\'po site, _on the other side; in front of_.\r\n\r\nfran\'tic, _without power to act properly_.\r\n\r\nher\'o ism, _great courage, which makes one willing to face\r\n    danger of any kind_.\r\n\r\nres\'o lute, _decided; firm_.\r\n\r\naf fec\'tion ate, _kind and loving_.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESENCE OF MIND.\r\n\r\n\r\nMany years ago, there lived on the banks of the Naugatuck River, in\r\nConnecticut, a family by the name of Bishop.\r\n\r\nThe father was not wealthy, but a good man, and respected by all who\r\nknew him. He had fought in the battles of his country during the\r\nRevolutionary War, and was familiar with scenes of danger and peril.\r\n\r\nHe had learned that it is always more prudent to preserve an air of\r\nconfidence in danger, than to show signs of fear, and especially so,\r\nsince his conduct might have a great influence upon the minds of those\r\nabout him.\r\n\r\nOn one occasion he sent his son James, a boy twelve years old, across\r\nthe river to the house of a relative, on an errand. As there was no\r\nbridge or ferry, all who crossed the river were obliged to ford it.\r\n\r\nJames was familiar with every part of the fording-place, and when the\r\nwater was low, which was the case at this time, there was no danger in\r\ncrossing.\r\n\r\nMounted on one of his father\'s best horses, James set out. He crossed\r\nthe river, and soon reached the house of his relatives.\r\n\r\nHe was ready to start on his return, when suddenly the heavens became\r\nblack with clouds, the wind blew with great violence, and the rain fell\r\nin torrents.\r\n\r\nIt was late in the afternoon, and as his relatives feared to have him\r\nattempt to reach home in such a storm, they persuaded him to remain over\r\nnight and wait until daylight before starting for home.\r\n\r\nHis father suspected the cause of James\' delay, and was not over anxious\r\non his account. He knew that the boy was prudent, and did not fear that\r\nany accident would happen to him during the night.\r\n\r\nBut he knew that he had taught James to obey his commands in every\r\nparticular, and as the boy possessed, a daring and fearless spirit, that\r\nhe would attempt to ford the river as soon as it was light enough in the\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nHe knew, also, that the immense quantity of water that appeared to be\r\nfalling, would cause the river to rise to a considerable height by\r\nmorning, and make it very dangerous even for a strong man to attempt to\r\ncross it.\r\n\r\nThe thought of what might befall his child caused Mr. Bishop to pass a\r\nsleepless night; for although he was very strict with his children, he\r\npossessed an affectionate nature and loved them dearly.\r\n\r\nThe day dawned; the storm had ceased; the wind was still, and nothing\r\nwas to be heard but the roar of the river.\r\n\r\nThe rise of the river was even greater than Mr. Bishop expected, and as\r\nsoon as it was light enough, for him to see objects across it, he took\r\nup a position on the bank to watch for the approach of his son.\r\n\r\nJames arrived on the opposite shore at the same time, and his horse was\r\nbeginning to enter the stream.\r\n\r\nAll his father\'s feelings were roused into action, for he knew that his\r\nson was in fearful danger. James had already proceeded too far to\r\nreturn--in fact, to go forward or back was equally dangerous.\r\n\r\nHis horse had arrived at the deepest part of the river, and was\r\nstruggling against the current. The animal was being hurried down the\r\nstream, and apparently making but little progress toward the shore.\r\n\r\nJames became very much alarmed. Raising his eyes toward the\r\nlanding-place, he discovered his father. Almost frantic with fear, he\r\nexclaimed, "O father, father! I shall drown! I shall drown!"\r\n\r\n"No," replied his father, in a stern and resolute tone of voice,\r\ndismissing for a moment his feelings of tenderness; "if you do, I will\r\nwhip you severely. Cling to your horse! Cling to your horse!"\r\n\r\nThe son, who feared his father more than he did the raging river, obeyed\r\nthe command; and the noble animal on which he was mounted, struggling\r\nfor some time, carried him safe to shore.\r\n\r\n"My son!" exclaimed the glad father, bursting into tears, "remember,\r\nhereafter, that in danger you must possess courage, and being determined\r\nto save your life, cling to the last hope!\r\n\r\n"If I had replied to you with the tenderness and fear which I felt, you\r\nmight have lost your life; you would have lost your presence of mind,\r\nbeen carried away by the current, and I should have seen you no more."\r\n\r\nWhat a noble example is this! The heroism of this father and his\r\npresence of mind saved the life of his boy.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDirections for Reading.--In _calling tones_, as on pages 237 and 238,\r\nnotice that the falling inflections only can be used.[14]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage Lesson.--Let pupils make out an _analysis_, and use it in\r\ntelling the story in their own words.\r\n\r\n\r\n[14] See the last six paragraphs.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON LI.\r\n\r\n\r\nrug\'ged, _full of rough places_.\r\n\r\ncon cealed\', _covered over; hidden_.\r\n\r\nra vines\', _deep and narrow hollow places_.\r\n\r\nprec\'i pice, _a very steep place_.\r\n\r\ndis\'lo cate ed, _thrown out of joint_.\r\n\r\nmis\'er y, _great unhappiness_.\r\n\r\nev\'i dence, _signs; that which is shown_.\r\n\r\nde scent\', _going down_.\r\n\r\nhaz\'ards, _dangers; difficulties_.\r\n\r\ntoil, _hard work_.\r\n\r\npro ject\'ing, _hanging over_.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHALBERT AND HIS DOG.\r\n\r\n\r\nFar up in the Highlands of Scotland lived Malcolm, a shepherd, with his\r\nwife and his son Halbert.\r\n\r\nTheir little cottage was far from any village, and could only be reached\r\nby a rugged path through the mountains.\r\n\r\nOne evening Halbert\'s mother was taken very ill, and Malcolm made\r\npreparations to go to the village to obtain some medicine for her.\r\n\r\n"Father," said Halbert, "I know the path through the dark glen better\r\nthan you. Shag will walk before me, and I will be quite safe. Let me go\r\nfor the doctor, and you stay at home and comfort mother."\r\n\r\nOld Shag, the dog, stood by, wagging his tail and looking up into\r\nMalcolm\'s face as if to say, "Yes, master, I will take good care of\r\nHalbert. Let him go."\r\n\r\nMalcolm did not like to have his boy undertake a journey of so much\r\nperil, as the snow was falling in heavy flakes, and it was growing very\r\ndark. But the boy again repeated his request, and Malcolm gave his\r\nconsent.\r\n\r\nHalbert had been accustomed to the mountains from his earliest boyhood,\r\nand Shag set out with his young master, not seeming to care for wind,\r\nsnow, or storm.\r\n\r\nThey reached the village safely. Halbert saw the doctor, received some\r\nmedicine for his mother, and then started on his return home with a\r\ncheerful heart.\r\n\r\nShag trotted along before him to see that all was right. Suddenly,\r\nhowever, in one of the most dangerous parts of the rocky path, he\r\nstopped and began snuffing and smelling about.\r\n\r\n"Go on, Shag," said Halbert.\r\n\r\nShag would not stir.\r\n\r\n"Shag, go on, sir," repeated the boy. "We are nearly at the top of the\r\nglen. Look through the dark, and you can see the candle shining through\r\nour window."\r\n\r\nShag disobeyed for the first time in his life, and Halbert advanced\r\nahead of him, heedless of the warning growl of his companion.\r\n\r\nHe had proceeded but a few steps when he fell over a precipice, the\r\napproach to which had been concealed by the snow.\r\n\r\nIt was getting late in the night, and Malcolm began to be alarmed at the\r\nlong absence of Halbert. He placed the candle so as to throw the light\r\nover his boy\'s path, piled wood on the great hearth fire, and often went\r\nto the door.\r\n\r\nBut no footstep sounded on the crackling ice; no figure darkened the\r\nwide waste of snow.\r\n\r\n"Perhaps the doctor is not at home, and he is waiting for him," said\r\nHalbert\'s mother. She felt so uneasy at her boy\'s absence, that she\r\nalmost forgot her own pain.\r\n\r\nIt was midnight when Malcolm heard the well-known bark of the faithful\r\nShag.\r\n\r\n"O there is Halbert!" cried both parents at the same moment. Malcolm\r\nsprang to the door and opened it, expecting to see his son.\r\n\r\nBut alas! Halbert was not there. Shag was alone. The old dog entered\r\nthe door, and began to whine in a piteous manner.\r\n\r\n"O Malcolm, Malcolm, my brave son has perished in the snow!" exclaimed\r\nthe mother.\r\n\r\nMalcolm stood wondering. His heart beat rapidly. A fear that the worst\r\nhad happened almost overcame him. At that moment he saw a small package\r\naround the dog\'s neck.\r\n\r\nSeizing it in his hands, he exclaimed, "No, wife; look! Our boy lives!\r\nHere is the medicine, tied with his handkerchief; he has fallen into one\r\nof the deep ravines, but he is safe.\r\n\r\n"I will go out, and Shag shall go with me. He will conduct me safely to\r\nthe rescue of my child."\r\n\r\nIn an instant Shag was again on his feet, and gave evidence of great joy\r\nas he left the cottage with his old master.\r\n\r\nYou may imagine the misery and grief the poor mother suffered--alone in\r\nher mountain dwelling; the certainty of her son\'s danger, and the fear\r\nthat her husband also might perish.\r\n\r\nShag went on straight and steadily for some distance after he left the\r\ncottage. Suddenly he turned down a path which led to the foot of the\r\nprecipice over which Halbert had fallen.\r\n\r\nThe descent was steep and dangerous, and Malcolm was frequently obliged\r\nto support himself by clinging to the frozen branches of the trees.\r\n\r\nAt last Malcolm stood on the lower and opposite edge of the pit into\r\nwhich his son had fallen. He called to him, "Halbert! Halbert!" He\r\nlooked in every direction, but could not see or hear any thing.\r\n\r\nShag was making his way down a very steep and dangerous ledge of rocks,\r\nand Malcolm resolved at all hazards to follow him.\r\n\r\nAfter getting to the bottom, Shag scrambled to a projecting rock, which\r\nwas covered with snow, and commenced whining and scratching in a violent\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nMalcolm followed, and after some search found what appeared to be the\r\ndead body of his son. He hastily tore off the jacket, which was soaked\r\nwith blood and snow, and wrapping Halbert in his great cloak, took him\r\nupon his shoulders, and with much toil and difficulty reached the path\r\nagain, and soon had his boy at home.\r\n\r\nHalbert was placed in his mother\'s bed, and by using great exertion,\r\nthey aroused him from his dangerous sleep.\r\n\r\nHe was much bruised and had his ankle dislocated, but was not otherwise\r\nhurt. When he recovered his senses, he fixed his eyes on his mother, and\r\nhis first words were, "Did you get the medicine, mother?"\r\n\r\nWhen he fell, Shag had descended after him. The affectionate son used\r\nwhat little strength he had left to tie the medicine that he had\r\nreceived from the doctor around the dog\'s neck, and then sent him home\r\nwith it.\r\n\r\nYou may be sure that Shag was well taken care of after this incident.\r\nEven after Halbert became a man Shag was his constant companion, and he\r\nlived to a good old age.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage Lesson--Let pupils add _ship_ to each of the following\r\nwords, and then give their meaning.\r\n\r\n    friend    hard    relation    partner    fellow\r\n\r\nMake out an _analysis_ of the lesson, and use it in telling the story\r\nin your own words.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON LII.\r\n\r\n\r\nebb\'ing, _flowing out; falling_.\r\n\r\nbreak\'ers, _waves breaking into foam against_\r\n     the shore_.\r\n\r\nmain, _the great sea; the ocean_.\r\n\r\nreef, _a row or chain of rocks_.\r\n\r\ndis mayed\', _having lost courage_.\r\n\r\nstrand, _beach; shore_.\r\n\r\ntreach\'er ous, _likely to do harm_.\r\n\r\nvic\'tor, _a successful warrior_.\r\n\r\nshroud\'ing, _covering over_.\r\n\r\nmurk\'y, _gloomy; dark_.\r\n\r\nbea\'con, _a signal fire or light_.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LIGHT-HOUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\n  The tide comes up, and the tide goes down,\r\n  Over the rocks, so rugged and brown,\r\n  And the cruel sea,  with a hungry roar,\r\n  Dashes its breakers along the shore;\r\n  But steady and clear, with a constant ray,\r\n  The star of the light-house shines alway.\r\n\r\n  The ships come sailing across the main,\r\n  But the harbor mouth is hard to gain,\r\n  For the treacherous reef lies close beside,\r\n  And the rocks are bare at the ebbing tide,\r\n  And the blinding fog comes down at night,\r\n  Shrouding and hiding the harbor light.\r\n\r\n  The sailors, sailing their ships along,\r\n  Will tell you a tale of the light-house strong;\r\n  How once, when the keeper was far away,\r\n  A terrible storm swept down the bay,\r\n  And two little children were left to keep\r\n  Their awesome watch with the angry deep.\r\n\r\n  The fair little sister wept, dismayed,\r\n  But the brother said, "I am not afraid;\r\n  There\'s One who ruleth on sea and land,\r\n  And holds the sea in His mighty hand;\r\n  For mercy\'s sake I will watch to-night,\r\n  And feed, for the sailors, the beacon light."\r\n\r\n  So the sailors heard through the murky shroud\r\n  The fog-bell sounding its warning loud!\r\n  While the children, up in the lonely tower,\r\n  Tended the lamp in the midnight hour,\r\n  And prayed for any whose souls might be\r\n  In deadly peril by land or sea.\r\n\r\n  Ghostly and dim, when the storm was o\'er,\r\n  The ships rode safely, far off the shore,\r\n  And a boat shot out from the town that lay\r\n  Dusk and purple, across the bay,\r\n  She touched her keel to the light-house strand,\r\n  And the eager keeper leaped to land.\r\n\r\n  And swiftly climbing the light-house stair,\r\n  He called to his children, young and fair;\r\n  But, worn with their toilsome watch, they slept,\r\n  While slowly o\'er their foreheads crept,\r\n  The golden light of the morning sun,\r\n  Like a victor\'s crown, when his palm is won.\r\n\r\n  "God bless you, children!" the keeper cried;\r\n  "God bless thee, father!" the boy replied.\r\n  "I dreamed that there stood beside my bed\r\n  A beautiful angel, who smiled and said,\r\n  \'Blessed are they whose love can make\r\n  Joy of labor, for mercy\'s sake!\'"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDirections for Reading.--Mark the _inflection_ of the following lines.\r\n\r\n    The tide comes up, and the tide goes down.\r\n\r\n    The fair little sister wept, dismayed,\r\n    But the brother said, "I am not afraid."\r\n\r\nName the _emphatic words_ in the lines just quoted.

It seemed to live only\r\nfor eating.\r\n\r\nAs autumn came on, it quite lost its appetite; so much so, that even the\r\ntenderest and most juicy leaves could not tempt it to eat any more. It\r\ngrew dull and stiff, and lost all interest in life.\r\n\r\nFeeling that some change was about to happen, it crawled into a little\r\nhole in the old garden wall. It wrapped itself up in a cobweb, and fell\r\ninto a long sleep, during which it became changed from a caterpillar\r\ninto a dried-up, dead-looking grub or chrysalis.\r\n\r\nIt remained in this state through all the long winter, till the snow and\r\nfrost had gone, and the cold March winds were over.\r\n\r\nIn April the trees burst forth with their bright green leaves, and the\r\ngrass looked fresh under the power of the warm rains.\r\n\r\nIn May the many-tinted flowers appeared, filling the air with their\r\nsweetness, and brightening the fields and gardens with their gay colors.\r\n\r\nAt this time another great change came over the old grub. It showed\r\nsigns of life again; but it was now no longer a caterpillar--it was\r\nsomething else.\r\n\r\nIt wriggled and turned in its narrow little home, and seemed anxious to\r\nget out and look at the sunshine and flowers. It bumped its head up and\r\ndown until it succeeded in pushing off a little door.\r\n\r\nWhen the door was off, and the bright sunlight shone in, this little\r\noccupant of the chrysalis took a look at itself.\r\n\r\nIt saw that during its long winter\'s nap, it had acquired a pair of\r\nbeautiful wings, and its legs had grown longer and stronger than they\r\nwere before.\r\n\r\nCrawling out of the chrysalis, and taking a position on a branch of the\r\ntree, it discovered that instead of a caterpillar, it was now a\r\nbeautiful butterfly.\r\n\r\nIt was a kind that is called the swallow-tail butterfly, because each of\r\nits wings tapered to a point, something like the tail of a swallow. We\r\nwill call the butterfly, Miss Swallow-tail, and now let us see what her\r\nnext move was.\r\n\r\nHer wings were damp and heavy, and she stood shivering and trembling;\r\nfor although she had six legs, they were weak, having never before borne\r\nsuch a weight.\r\n\r\nBut fresh air brings strength; so she soon felt like trying to walk. At\r\nfirst her movements were sluggish, but she finally reached a sunny spot\r\nwhere she dried and warmed herself, giving her wings a little shake now\r\nand then, until they opened grandly above her back.\r\n\r\nAnd how beautiful they were! Dark brown, bordered with two rows of\r\nyellow spots; and there were seven blue spots on each of the hind\r\nwings.\r\n\r\nAs she stood there in the sun, a little wind came along and raised Miss\r\nSwallow-tail off her feet. She spread her wings to keep from falling,\r\nand found herself floating in the air.\r\n\r\nThis proved to be such a delightful way of traveling, that she lifted\r\nher wings occasionally, and so kept herself floating; and in a short\r\ntime she learned to turn in any direction she chose.\r\n\r\nAs she flew along, growing stronger every minute, she was attracted by\r\nthe bright colors of a flower, and stopped to admire it.\r\n\r\nThe sweet perfume tempted her to taste, and unrolling her long tongue\r\nfrom under her chin, where she carried it, she put it down into the\r\nflower and drew up the honey hidden there.\r\n\r\nMiss Swallow-tail had wonderful eyes. All butterflies have wonderful\r\neyes. If you will look at them through a microscope you will find that\r\neach eye is composed of a great many smaller ones, that can see in all\r\ndirections.\r\n\r\nThey have great need of such eyes, because there are so many birds and\r\nother hungry creatures, that want to eat them.\r\n\r\nOne day a whiff of celery coming from a garden near by, reminded Miss\r\nSwallow-tail of the time when she was a baby and liked to eat celery.\r\n\r\nSo she flew over into the garden, and fastened her eggs to a celery bush\r\nwith some glue that she carried with her. Then she left them, and never\r\nthought of them again.\r\n\r\nIn about ten days the babies that had been growing inside of the eggs,\r\nbroke open the shells and crawled out. And what do you think they were?\r\nButterflies? like their mamma, only very much smaller?\r\n\r\nNo, indeed! for you know butterflies never grow any larger. They were\r\nthe smallest green and black worms you ever saw!\r\n\r\nAs soon as they were out of the shells, they began eating the celery,\r\nand grew so fast that in a week they were quite large worms.\r\n\r\nThey were covered with green rings and black rings dotted with yellow.\r\nThey each had sixteen short legs, and they had a flesh-colored, Y-shaped\r\nhorn hidden away under a ring above the head, that they would show when\r\nthey were disturbed.\r\n\r\nOne morning the gardener discovered that something was eating his\r\ncelery. Searching among the leaves he found all but one of the little\r\nworms, and put them where they could do no more mischief.\r\n\r\nSoon the little worm that had escaped his notice, had grown so fat that\r\nhe was too stupid to eat any more; so he crawled away to a dark place on\r\nthe fence and fastened himself there.\r\n\r\nBut first he covered a small spot of the fence with a white, silken\r\ncarpet, that he wove from a web which he drew from his under lip.\r\n\r\nHe then glued the end of a web to the carpet, carried the rest of it up\r\nover his breast, and down on the other side and fastened it there.\r\n\r\nHe then bent his head down under it, letting it pass over his head, and\r\nby bending forward and backward worked it down near the middle of his\r\nback. After inspecting his work, he bent his head upon his breast, and\r\nleaned against the fence.\r\n\r\nAfter resting two days, he began a series of twistings and turnings\r\nthat burst open his skin from the corners of his mouth down a short way,\r\nand worked it all off himself.\r\n\r\nHe drew his head in out of sight, and sent out a stubbed horn on each\r\nside of it, and lo! no worm was to be seen!--but a chrysalis, like the\r\none his mother was sleeping in when we first found her.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDirections for Reading.--Let pupils read the following lines, and then\r\nmark the _inflection_.\r\n\r\n\r\n    "And what do you think they were?

It is a very strong\r\nbraided thong, half an inch thick, and forty feet long, made of many\r\nstrips of rawhide, braided like a whip-thong, and made soft and pliable\r\nby rubbing with grease.\r\n\r\n"It has at one end an iron ring, about an inch and a half in diameter,\r\nthrough which the thong is passed, forming a running noose.\r\n\r\n"The herdsmen--gauchos, as they are called--are generally mounted on\r\nhorseback when they use the lasso. One end of the thong is attached to\r\nthe saddle; the remainder is coiled in the left hand, except about\r\ntwelve feet belonging to the noose end, which is held in a coil in the\r\nright hand.\r\n\r\n"This long noose is then swung around the head, the weight of the iron\r\nring at the end of the noose assisting in giving to it, by a continued\r\ncircular motion, a sufficient force to project it the whole length of\r\nthe line.\r\n\r\n"The gauchos drive the wild horses into a corral, which is a circular\r\nspace surrounded by rough posts firmly driven into the ground. The\r\ncorral," relates Miers, "was quite full of horses, most of which were\r\nyoung ones about two or three years old.\r\n\r\n"The chief gaucho, mounted on a strong, steady horse, rode into the\r\ncorral, and threw his lasso over the neck of a young horse and dragged\r\nhim to the gate.\r\n\r\n"For some time he was very unwilling to lose his companions; but the\r\nmoment he was forced out of the corral his first idea was to gallop\r\naway; however, a timely jerk of the lasso checked him.\r\n\r\n"Some of the gauchos now ran after him on foot, and threw a lasso over\r\nhis fore legs, and jerking it, they pulled his legs from under him so\r\nsuddenly that I really thought the fall had killed him.\r\n\r\n"In an instant a gaucho was seated on his head. They then put a piece of\r\nhide in his mouth to serve for a bit, and a strong hide halter on his\r\nhead, and allowed him to get on his feet.\r\n\r\n"While two men held the horse by his ears, the gaucho who was to mount\r\nhim fastened on the saddle, and then quickly sprung into it.\r\n\r\n"The horse instantly began to jump in a manner which made it very\r\ndifficult for the rider to keep his seat; however, the gaucho\'s spurs\r\nsoon set him going, and off he galloped, doing every thing in his power\r\nto throw his rider.\r\n\r\n"Then another horse was brought from the corral; and so quickly was\r\nevery thing done that twelve gauchos were mounted in less than an hour.\r\n\r\n"It was wonderful to see the different manner in which different horses\r\nbehaved. Some would actually scream while the gauchos were fastening\r\nthe saddle upon their backs, and some would instantly lie down and roll\r\nupon it.\r\n\r\n"Others would stand without being held, their legs stiff and in\r\nunnatural positions, their necks half bent towards their tails, and\r\nlooking vicious and obstinate.\r\n\r\n"It was now curious to look around and see the gauchos trying to bring\r\ntheir horses back to the corral, which is the most difficult part of\r\ntheir work, for the poor creatures had been so scared there that they\r\nwere unwilling to return to the place.\r\n\r\n"At last they brought the horses back, apparently subdued and broken in.\r\nThe saddles and bridles were taken off, and the young horses trotted\r\noff towards the corral, neighing to one another.\r\n\r\n"When a gaucho wishes to take a wild horse, he mounts a horse that has\r\nbeen used to the sport, and gallops over the plain.\r\n\r\n"As soon as he comes near his victim, the lasso is thrown round the two\r\nhind-legs, and as the gaucho rides a little on one side, the jerk\r\nthrows the wild horse without doing injury to his knees or his face.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n"Before the horse can recover from the shock, the rider dismounts, and\r\nsnatching his cloak from his shoulders, wraps it round the fallen\r\nanimal\'s head.\r\n\r\n"He then forces into his mouth one of the powerful bridles of the\r\ncountry, fastens a saddle on his back, and, mounting him, removes the\r\ncloak.\r\n\r\n"Upon this the astonished horse springs to his feet, and attempts to\r\nthrow off his new master, who sits calmly on his back.\r\n\r\n"By a treatment which never fails, the gaucho brings the horse to such\r\ncomplete obedience that he is soon trained to give his whole speed and\r\nstrength to the capture of his companions."\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDirections for Reading.--Let pupils pronounce in concert, and singly,\r\nthe following words: _I, hide, side, rides, flight, wild, finds,\r\nretire, describe_.\r\n\r\nMark the inflection of the last six lines of poetry on page 256.[15]\r\n\r\nWhat _inflection_ is used (1) to keep up the interest?--(2) to show\r\nhesitation?--(3) to express a decided opinion?--(4) to give the\r\nconclusion of a story?--(5) to ask a question that may be answered by\r\n_yes_ or _no_?--(6) to ask a question that can not be answered by\r\n_yes_ or _no_?\r\n\r\nLet pupils state the special uses of _inflection_ shown in the\r\nfollowing examples.\r\n\r\n    I, I think perhaps you may go.\r\n\r\n    I know that you may go.\r\n\r\n    They silently went away.\r\n\r\nYesterday, about three o\'clock, just as we were preparing to go home,\r\nsuddenly we heard a band of music.\r\n\r\n\r\n[15] This lesson.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON LV.\r\n\r\n\r\ncareer\', _course of life_.\r\n\r\ngen\'erous, _free in giving aid to others_.\r\n\r\nchar\'ity, _goodwill; desire to aid others_.\r\n\r\nin her\'ited, _came into possession of_.\r\n\r\nin jus\'tice, _wrong-doing_.\r\n\r\nac cused\', _charged with a fault_.\r\n\r\nhes i ta\'tion, _delay_.\r\n\r\npre scrip\'tion, _an order for medicine_.\r\n\r\nflor\'ins, _pieces of money, each valued at about fifty cents_.\r\n\r\npen\'sion, _money paid for service in war_.\r\n\r\nre stor\'ing, _giving back_.\r\n\r\nphy si\'cian, _doctor of medicine_.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN EMPEROR\'S KINDNESS.\r\n\r\n\r\nJoseph II., Emperor of Austria, was a generous, warm-hearted man, who\r\ntook great delight in doing acts of kindness and charity.\r\n\r\nOne time, as he was passing through the streets of Vienna, dressed as a\r\nprivate gentleman, his attention was attracted to a boy about twelve\r\nyears old, who timidly approached, and seemed, anxious to speak to him.\r\n\r\n"What do you wish, my little friend?" said the gentleman. His voice was\r\nso tender, and he had such a kindly look in his eyes, that the boy had\r\ncourage to say:\r\n\r\n"O sir, you are very good to speak to me so kindly. I believe you will\r\nnot refuse to do something for me."\r\n\r\n"I should be sorry to refuse you," replied the gentleman; "but why are\r\nyou begging? You appear to be something better than a beggar; your voice\r\nand your manner show it."\r\n\r\n"I am not a beggar, sir," replied the boy, as a tear trickled down his\r\ncheek. "My father was a brave officer in the army. Owing to illness, he\r\nwas obliged to leave the service, and was granted a pension by the\r\nemperor.\r\n\r\n"With this pension he supported our family; but a few months ago he\r\ndied, and we are left very poor indeed."\r\n\r\n"Poor child!" said the gentleman. "Is your mother living?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, she is; and I have two brothers who are at home with her now.\r\nShe has been unable to leave her bed for weeks, and one of us must watch\r\nbeside her, while the others go out to beg."\r\n\r\nSaying this, the poor boy tried very hard to keep back the great tears,\r\nbut they would come in spite of all he could do to stop them.\r\n\r\n"Well, well, my boy," said the gentleman, "do not feel so unhappy; I\r\nwill see what can be done to help you. Is there a physician to be found\r\nnear you?"\r\n\r\n"There are two, sir, only a little way from where we live."\r\n\r\n"That is well. Now you go at once and have one of them visit your\r\nmother. Here is money, not only for the physician, but for other things\r\nto feed you and make you comfortable."\r\n\r\n"O sir," said the boy, as he looked upon the gentleman in amazement,\r\n"how can I thank you enough? This money will save my mother\'s life, and\r\nkeep my brothers from want."\r\n\r\n"Never mind, my child; go and get the physician."\r\n\r\nThe boy obeyed, and the good emperor having learned the situation of the\r\nhouse where the boy\'s mother lived, bent his steps in that direction,\r\nand soon arrived there.\r\n\r\nThe room in which he found the poor woman gave evidence of great misery.\r\n\r\nShe was lying on a low bedstead, and though still young, her face was\r\npale and thin from sickness and want. Very little furniture of any kind\r\nwas to be seen, for the mother had disposed of nearly all she possessed\r\nto obtain bread for her children.\r\n\r\nWhen the emperor entered the room, the widow and her children looked at\r\nhim in astonishment. They did not know he was their emperor.\r\n\r\n"I am a physician, madam," said he, bowing respectfully; "your neighbors\r\nhave informed me of your illness, and I am come to offer what service\r\nmay be in my power."\r\n\r\n"Alas! sir," she answered with some hesitation, "I have no means of\r\npaying you for your attention."\r\n\r\n"Do not distress yourself on that account; I shall be fully repaid if I\r\nhave the happiness of restoring you to health."\r\n\r\nWith these words, the emperor approached the bed and inquired all about\r\nher illness, after which he wrote a few lines and placed them on the\r\nchimney-piece.\r\n\r\n"I will leave you this prescription, madam; and on my next visit, I hope\r\nto find you much better." He then withdrew. Almost immediately after\r\nthis, the eldest son of the widow came in with a medical man.\r\n\r\n"O mother!" cried the boy, "a kind, good gentleman has given me all\r\nthis!" and he placed in his mother\'s hand, the money which the emperor\r\nhad given him. "There now, don\'t cry, mother; this money will pay the\r\ndoctor and buy every thing till you are well and strong again."\r\n\r\n"A physician has already been here, my child, and has left his\r\nprescription. See, there it is." and she pointed to the paper on the\r\nchimney-piece. The boy took the paper, and no sooner had he glanced at\r\nits contents, than he uttered an exclamation of joyful surprise.\r\n\r\n"O mother! It\'s the best prescription a physician ever wrote; it\'s an\r\norder for a pension, mother--a pension for you--signed by the emperor\r\nhimself; listen, mother; hear what he says:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    "\'_Madam:_--Your son was fortunate enough to meet me in the city,\r\n    and informed me of the fact that the widow of one of my bravest\r\n    officers was suffering from poverty and sickness, without any means\r\n    of assistance.

We had moved to\r\nMinnesota three years before, the main object of my parents being to\r\nrestore their health; for they were feeble and needed a change of\r\nclimate.\r\n\r\nThe first year, both father and mother were much benefited; but not long\r\nafter, father began to fail.\r\n\r\nI remember that he used to take his chair out in front of the house in\r\npleasant weather and sit there, with his eyes turned toward the blue\r\nhorizon, or into the depths of the vast wilderness which was not more\r\nthan a stone\'s throw from our door.\r\n\r\nMother would sometimes go out and sit beside father, and they would talk\r\nlong and earnestly in low tones. I was too young to understand all this\r\nat the time, but it was not long afterward that I learned the truth.\r\n\r\nFather was steadily and surely declining in health; but mother had\r\nbecome strong and robust, and her disease seemed to have left her\r\naltogether. She tried to encourage father, and really believed his\r\nweakness was only temporary.\r\n\r\nScarcely a day passed that I did not see some of the Sioux Indians who\r\nwere scattered through that portion of the State. In going to, and\r\ncoming from the agency, they would sometimes stop at our house.\r\n\r\nFather was very quick in picking up languages, and he was able to\r\nconverse quite easily with the red men.\r\n\r\nHow I used to laugh to hear them talk in their odd language, which\r\nsounded to me just as if they were grunting at each other.\r\n\r\nBut the visits used to please father and mother, and I was always glad\r\nto see some of the rather ragged and not over-clean warriors stop at the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nI remember one hot day in June, when father was sitting under a tree in\r\nfront of the house, and I was inside helping mother, we heard the\r\npeculiar noises which told us that father had an Indian visitor. We both\r\nwent to the door, and I passed outside to laugh at their queer talk.\r\n\r\nSure enough, an Indian was seated in the other chair, and he and father\r\nwere talking with great animation.\r\n\r\nThe Indian was of a stout build, and wore a straw hat with a broad, red\r\nband around it; he had on a fine, black broad-cloth coat, but his\r\ntrousers were shabby and his shoes were pretty well worn.\r\n\r\nHis face was bright and intelligent, and I watched it very closely as he\r\ntalked in his earnest way with father, who was equally animated in\r\nanswering him.\r\n\r\nThe Indian carried a rifle and a revolver--the latter being in plain\r\nsight at his waist--but I never connected the thought of danger with\r\nhim as he sat there talking with father.\r\n\r\nI describe this Indian rather closely, as he was no other than the\r\nwell-known chief, Little Crow, who was at the head of the frightful\r\nSioux war, which broke out within sixty days from that time.\r\n\r\nThe famous chieftain staid until the sun went down. Then he started up\r\nand walked away rapidly in the direction of Lac Qui Parle. Father called\r\ngood-by to him, but he did not reply and soon disappeared in the woods.\r\n\r\nThe sky was cloudy, and it looked as if a storm was coming; so, as it\r\nwas dark and blustering, we remained within doors the rest of the\r\nevening. A fine drizzling rain began to fall, and the darkness was\r\nintense.\r\n\r\nThe evening was well advanced, and father was reading to us, when there\r\ncame a rap upon the door.\r\n\r\nIt was so gentle and timid that it sounded like the pecking of a bird,\r\nand we all looked in the direction of the door, uncertain what it\r\nmeant.\r\n\r\n"It is a bird, scared by the storm," said father, "and we may as well\r\nadmit it."\r\n\r\nI sat much nearer the door than either of my parents, and instantly\r\nstarted up and opened it. As I did so, I looked out into the gloom, but\r\nsprung back the next moment with a low cry of alarm.\r\n\r\n"What\'s the matter?" asked father, hastily laying down his book and\r\nwalking rapidly toward me.\r\n\r\n"It isn\'t a bird; it\'s a person." As I spoke, a little Indian girl,\r\nabout my own age, walked into the room, and looking in each of our\r\nfaces, asked in the Sioux language whether she could stay all night.\r\n\r\nI closed the door and we gathered around her. She had the prettiest,\r\ndaintiest moccasins, but her limbs were bare from the knee downward. She\r\nwore a large shawl about her shoulders, while her coarse, black hair\r\nhung loosely below her waist.\r\n\r\nHer face was very pretty, and her eyes were as black as coal and seemed\r\nto flash fire whenever she looked upon any one.\r\n\r\nOf course, her clothing was dripping with moisture, and her call filled\r\nus all with wonder. She could speak only a few words of English, so her\r\nface lighted up with pleasure when father addressed her in the Sioux\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nAs near as we could find out, her name was Chitto, and she lived with\r\nher parents at Lac Qui Parle. She told us that there were several\r\nfamilies in a spot by themselves, and that day they had secured a\r\nquantity of strong drink, of which they were partaking very freely.\r\n\r\nAt such times Indians are dangerous, and Little Chitto was terrified\r\nalmost out of her senses. She fled through the storm and the darkness,\r\nnot caring where she went, but only anxious to get away from the\r\ndreadful scene.\r\n\r\nEntering, without any intention on her part, the path in the woods, she\r\nfollowed it until she saw in the distance the glimmer of the light in\r\nour window, when she hastened to the house and asked for admission.\r\n\r\nI need scarcely say it was gladly granted. My mother removed the damp\r\nclothes from the little Sioux girl, and replaced them with some warm,\r\ndry ones belonging to me. At the same time she gave her hot, refreshing\r\ntea, and did every thing to make her comfortable.\r\n\r\nI removed the little moccasins from the wondering Chitto\'s feet, kissed\r\nher dark cheeks, and, as I uttered expressions of pity, though in an\r\nunknown tongue, I am quite sure that they were understood by Chitto, who\r\nlooked the gratitude she could not express.\r\n\r\nShe soon began to show signs of drowsiness and was put to bed with me,\r\nfalling asleep as soon as her head touched the pillow.\r\n\r\nI lay awake a little longer and noticed that the storm had ceased. The\r\npatter of the rain was heard no more upon the roof, and the wind blew\r\njust as it sometimes does late in the fall. At last I sunk into a sound\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage Lesson.--Let pupils write a short letter to some friend,\r\ntaking as a subject, "A Visit from Little Crow," as given on pages 272\r\nand 273.[16]\r\n\r\nLet pupils add _y_ to each of the following words, make such other\r\nchanges as may be necessary, and then define them.\r\n\r\n    earth    air    fire    water    sleep\r\n\r\n    rain    rust    fun    fur    stick\r\n\r\nWhat two words double their final letter before adding _y_? _Fiery_,\r\nfrom _fire_, is irregular in spelling.\r\n\r\n\r\n[16] This lesson.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON LVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nde\'mons, _spirits; evil spirits_.\r\n\r\ngroped, _found one\'s way by feeling with the hands_.\r\n\r\npre\'vi ous, _going before in time; preceding_.\r\n\r\nin clined\', _leaning towards; disposed_.\r\n\r\ndis tract\'ed, _confused by grief_.\r\n\r\nex pired\', _died_.\r\n\r\nstat\'ue, _a figure carved to represent a living being_.\r\n\r\nstag\'gered, _walked with trembling steps_.\r\n\r\nas cer tained\', _found out by inquiring_.\r\n\r\nre tain\', _keep possession of_.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA STORY OF THE SIOUX WAR.\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\n\r\nI awoke in the morning and saw the rays of the sun entering the window.\r\nRecalling the incidents of the previous evening, I turned to speak to my\r\nyoung friend.\r\n\r\nTo my surprise she was gone, and supposing she had risen a short time\r\nbefore, I hurriedly dressed myself and went down stairs to help keep her\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nBut she was not there, and father and mother had seen nothing of her.\r\nShe had no doubt risen in the night and gone quietly away.\r\n\r\nThere was something curious and touching in the fact that she had groped\r\nabout in the darkness, until she found her own clothing, which she put\r\non and departed without taking so much as a pin that belonged to us.\r\n\r\nWe all felt a strong interest in Chitto, and father took me with him a\r\nfew days later when he visited Lac Qui Parle. He made many inquiries for\r\nthe little girl, but could learn nothing about her.\r\n\r\nI felt very much disappointed, for I had built up strong hopes of taking\r\nher out home with me to spend several days.\r\n\r\nFather and I went a number of times afterward, and always made an effort\r\nto discover Chitto; but we did not gain any knowledge of her.\r\n\r\nOn the afternoon of August 19, father was sitting in his accustomed seat\r\nin front of the house, and mother was engaged, as usual about her\r\nhousehold duties. I was playing and amusing myself as a girl of my age\r\nis inclined to do at all times.\r\n\r\nThe day was sultry and close, and I remember that father was unusually\r\npale and weak. He coughed a great deal, and sat for a long time so still\r\nthat I thought he must be asleep.\r\n\r\n"Mother," said I, "what is that smoke yonder?"\r\n\r\nI pointed in the direction of Lac Qui Parle. She saw a dark column of\r\nsmoke floating off in the horizon, its location being such, that there\r\ncould be no doubt that it was at the Agency.\r\n\r\n"There is a fire of some kind there," she said, while she shaded her\r\neyes with her hand and gazed long and earnestly in that direction.\r\n\r\n"The Indians are coming, Edward," she called to father; "they will be\r\nhere in a few minutes!"\r\n\r\nSuddenly, a splendid black horse came galloping from the woods, and with\r\ntwo or three powerful bounds, halted directly in front of me. As it did\r\nso, I saw that the bareback rider was a small girl, and she was our\r\nlittle Sioux friend, Chitto.\r\n\r\nShe made a striking picture, with her long, black hair streaming over\r\nher shoulders, and her dress fluttering in the wind.\r\n\r\n"Why, Chitto," said I, in amazement, "where did you come from?"\r\n\r\n"Must go--must go--must go!" she exclaimed, in great excitement. "Indian\r\nsoon be here!"\r\n\r\nSo it seemed that, in the few weeks since she had been at our house,\r\nshe had picked up enough of the English language to make herself\r\nunderstood.\r\n\r\n"What do you mean?" asked mother, as she and I advanced to the side of\r\nthe black steed upon which the little Sioux sat; "what are the Indians\r\ndoing?"\r\n\r\n"They burn buildings--have killed people--coming this way!"\r\n\r\nChitto spoke the truth, for the Sioux were raging like demons at that\r\nvery hour at Lac Qui Parle.\r\n\r\n"What shall we do, Chitto?" asked my mother.\r\n\r\n"Get on horse--he carry you."\r\n\r\n"But my husband; the horse can not carry all three of us."\r\n\r\nMy poor distracted mother scarcely knew what to do. All this time father\r\nsat like a statue in his chair. A terrible suspicion suddenly entered\r\nher mind, and she ran to him.\r\n\r\nPlacing her hand upon his shoulder, she addressed him in a low tone, and\r\nthen uttered a fearful shriek, as she staggered backward, saying: "He is\r\ndead! he is dead!"\r\n\r\nSuch was the fact. The shock of the news brought by the little Indian\r\ngirl was too much, and he had expired in his chair without a struggle.\r\nThe wild cry which escaped my mother was answered by several whoops from\r\nthe woods, and Chitto became frantic with terror.\r\n\r\n"Indian be here in minute!" said she.\r\n\r\nMother instantly helped me upon the back of the horse and then followed\r\nherself. She was a skillful rider, but she allowed Chitto to retain the\r\nbridle, and we started off.\r\n\r\nLooking back I saw a half-dozen Sioux horsemen come out of the woods and\r\nstart on a trot toward us.\r\n\r\nJust then Chitto spoke to the horse, and he bounded off at a terrible\r\nrate, never halting until he had gone two or three miles.\r\n\r\nThen, when we looked back, we saw nothing of the Indians, and the horse\r\nwas brought down to a walk; and finally, when the sun went down, we\r\nentered a dense wood, where we staid all night.\r\n\r\nI shall not attempt to describe those fearful hours. Not one of us slept\r\na wink. Mother sat weeping over the loss of father, while I was\r\nheart-broken, too.\r\n\r\nChitto, like the Indian she was, kept on the move continually. Here and\r\nthere she stole as noiselessly through the wood as a shadow, while\r\nplaying the part of sentinel.\r\n\r\nAt daylight we all fell into a feverish slumber, which lasted several\r\nhours. When we awoke, we were hungry and miserable.\r\n\r\nSeeing a settler\'s house in the distance, Chitto offered to go to it for\r\nfood. We were afraid she would get into trouble, but she was sure there\r\nwas no danger and went.\r\n\r\nIn less than an hour she was back again with an abundance of bread. She\r\nsaid there was no one in the house, and we supposed the people had\r\nbecome alarmed and escaped.\r\n\r\nWe staid where we were for three days, during which time we saw a party\r\nof Sioux warriors burn the house where Chitto had obtained the food for\r\nus.\r\n\r\nIt seemed to mother that the Indians would not remain at Lac Qui Parle\r\nlong, and that we would be likely to find safety there. Accordingly, she\r\ninduced Chitto to start on the return.\r\n\r\nWhen we reached our house nothing was to be seen of father\'s body; but\r\nwe soon, discovered a newly-made grave, where we had reason to believe\r\nhe was buried.\r\n\r\nAs was afterward ascertained, he had been given a decent burial by\r\norders of Little Crow himself, who, doubtless, would have protected us,\r\nhad we awaited his coming.\r\n\r\nWe rode carefully through the woods, and when we came out on the other\r\nside, our hearts were made glad by the sight of the white tents of\r\nUnited States soldiers. Colonel Sibley was encamped at Lac Qui Parle,\r\nand we were safe at last.\r\n\r\nChitto disappeared from this post in the same sudden manner as before;\r\nbut I am happy to say that I have seen her several times since. Mother\r\nand I were afraid her people would punish her for the part she took in\r\nhelping us, but they did not.\r\n\r\nProbably the friendship which Little Crow showed toward our family, may\r\nhave had something to do with the gentle treatment which the Indians\r\nshowed her.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage Lesson.--Supply the words omitted from the following\r\nsentences.\r\n\r\n    "Must go!

These are\r\nlarge, hollow, circular openings, from which the smoke and fire escape.\r\n\r\nNearly all volcanoes emit smoke constantly. This smoke proceeds from\r\nfires that are burning far down in the depths of the earth.\r\n\r\nSometimes these fires burst forth from the crater of the volcano with\r\ntremendous force. The smoke becomes thick and black, and lurid flames\r\nshoot up to a height of hundreds of feet, making a scene of amazing\r\ngrandeur.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWith the flames there are thrown out stones, ashes, and streams of\r\nmelted rock, called lava. This lava flows down the sides of the\r\nmountain, and, being red-hot, destroys every thing with which it comes\r\nin contact. At such times, a volcano is said to be in eruption.\r\n\r\nA volcanic eruption is generally preceded by low, rumbling sounds, and\r\ntrembling of the earth\'s surface. Then follows greater activity of the\r\nvolcano, from which dense volumes of smoke and steam issue, and fire and\r\nmolten lava make their appearance.\r\n\r\nSuch is the force of some of these eruptions, that large rocks have been\r\nhurled to great distances from the crater, and towns and cities have\r\nbeen buried under a vast covering of ashes and lava.\r\n\r\nThe quantity of lava and ashes which sometimes escapes from volcanoes\r\nduring an eruption, is almost beyond comprehension.\r\n\r\nIn 1772, a volcano in the island of Java, threw out ashes and cinders\r\nthat covered the ground fifty feet deep, for a distance of seven miles\r\nall around the mountain. This eruption destroyed nearly forty towns and\r\nvillages.\r\n\r\nIn 1783, a volcano in Iceland sent out two streams of lava; one forty\r\nmiles long and seven miles wide, and the other fifty miles long and\r\nfifteen miles wide. These streams were from one hundred to six hundred\r\nfeet deep.\r\n\r\nNear the city of Naples, Italy, is situated the volcano Mt. Vesuvius.\r\nThis fiery monster has probably caused more destruction than any other\r\nvolcano known.\r\n\r\nIn the year 79 A.D., it suddenly burst forth in a violent eruption, that\r\nresulted in one of the most appalling disasters that ever happened.\r\n\r\nSuch immense quantities of ashes, stones, and lava were poured forth\r\nfrom its crater, that within the short space of twenty hours, two large\r\ncities were completely destroyed. These cities were Herculaneum and\r\nPompeii.\r\n\r\nAt this eruption of Vesuvius, the stream of lava flowed directly through\r\nand over the city of Herculaneum into the sea. The quantity was so great\r\nthat, as it cooled and became hardened, it gradually filled up all the\r\nstreets and ran over the tops of the houses.\r\n\r\nWhile the lava was thus turning the city into a mass of solid stone,\r\nthe inhabitants were fleeing from it along the shore toward Naples, and\r\nin boats on the sea.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, too, the wind carried the ashes and cinders in such a\r\ndirection as to deluge the city of Pompeii.\r\n\r\nSlowly and steadily the immense volume of ashes and small stones,\r\nblocked up the streets and settled on the roofs of houses.\r\n\r\nThe light of the flames that burst out from the awful crater, aided the\r\npeople in their escape; but many who for some reason could not get away,\r\nperished.\r\n\r\nPompeii was so completely covered that, nothing could be seen of it.\r\nThus it remained buried under the ground until the year 1748, when it\r\nwas discovered by accident.\r\n\r\nSince that time much of the city has been uncovered, and now one can\r\nwalk along the streets, look into the houses, and form some idea how the\r\npeople lived there eighteen hundred years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n_Language Lesson_.--Let pupils write an account of a supposed journey\r\nfrom their homes to Naples, telling about the route they would take, and\r\nthe particulars as to time and distance.

Apart from the group\r\nwalked a young man of a tall and compact frame, who moved with the firm\r\nand steady tread of one accustomed to constant exercise in the open air.\r\n\r\nHis face wore a look of decision and manliness not usually found in one\r\nso young, for he was but little over eighteen years of age.\r\n\r\nSuddenly there was a shriek, then another, and then several more in\r\nrapid succession. The voice was that of a woman, and seemed to proceed\r\nfrom the other side of a small piece of wooded land.\r\n\r\nAt the first scream, the youth turned his head in the direction of the\r\nsound; but when it was repeated, he pushed aside the undergrowth and\r\nsoon dashed into an open space on the banks of the stream, where stood a\r\nsmall log-cabin.\r\n\r\nAs the young man broke from the undergrowth, he saw his companions\r\ncrowded together on the banks of the river, while in their midst stood a\r\nwoman, from whom proceeded the shrieks he had heard. She was held by two\r\nof the men, but was struggling to free herself.\r\n\r\nThe instant the woman saw the young man, she exclaimed, "O sir, you will\r\ndo something for me! Make them release me. My boy--my poor boy is\r\ndrowning, and they will not let me go!"\r\n\r\n"It would be madness; she will jump into the river," said one of the\r\nmen, "and the rapids would dash her to pieces in a moment!"\r\n\r\nThe youth had scarcely waited for these words; for he remembered the\r\nchild, a bold little boy four years of age, whose beautiful blue eyes\r\nand flaxen ringlets made him a favorite with every one.\r\n\r\nHe had been accustomed to play in the little inclosure before the cabin;\r\nbut the gate having been left open, he had stolen out, reached the edge\r\nof the bank, and was in the act of looking over, when his mother saw\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThe shriek she uttered only hastened the accident she feared; for the\r\nchild, frightened at the cry of his mother, lost his balance and fell\r\ninto the stream, which here went foaming and roaring along among rocks\r\nand dangerous rapids.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the men approached the edge of the river, and were on the\r\npoint of springing in after the boy. But the sight of the sharp rocks\r\ncrowding the channel, the rush and whirl of the waters, and the want of\r\nany knowledge where to look for the child, deterred them, and they gave\r\nup the enterprise.\r\n\r\nNot so with the noble youth. His first act was to throw off his coat;\r\nnext to spring to the edge of the bank. Here he stood for a moment,\r\nrunning his eyes rapidly over the scene below, taking in with a glance\r\nthe different currents and the most dangerous of the rocks, in order to\r\nshape his course when in the stream.\r\n\r\nHe had scarcely formed his conclusion, when he saw in the water a white\r\nobject, which he knew was the boy\'s dress; and then he plunged into the\r\nwild and roaring rapids.\r\n\r\n"Thank God, he will save my child!" cried the mother; "there he is!--O\r\nmy boy, my darling boy! How could I leave you!"\r\n\r\nEvery one had rushed to the brink of the precipice and were now\r\nfollowing with eager eyes the progress of the youth, as the current bore\r\nhim onward, like a feather in the power of a hurricane.\r\n\r\nNow it seemed as if he would be dashed against a projecting rock, over\r\nwhich the water flew in foam, and a whirlpool would drag him in, from\r\nwhose grasp escape would appear impossible.\r\n\r\nAt times, the current bore him under, and he would be lost to sight;\r\nthen in a few seconds he would come to the surface again, though his\r\nposition would be far from where he had disappeared.\r\n\r\nThus struggling amid the rocks and angry waters, was the noble youth\r\nborne onward, eager to succeed in his perilous undertaking. Those on\r\nshore looked on with breathless interest.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDirections for Reading.--Point out the _emphatic words_ and mark\r\n_inflection_ in the third paragraph on page 295.[17]\r\n\r\nWhat effect has very strong _emphasis_ upon _inflection_?

How\r\nher heart sunk when he went under, and with what joy she saw him emerge\r\nagain from the waters, and, flinging the waves aside with his strong\r\narms, struggle on in pursuit of her boy!\r\n\r\nBut it seemed as if his generous efforts were not to succeed; for,\r\nthough the current was bearing off the boy before his eyes, scarcely ten\r\nfeet distant, he could not overtake the drowning child.\r\n\r\nTwice the boy went out of sight; and a suppressed shriek escaped the\r\nmother\'s lips; but twice he reappeared, and then, with hands wrung\r\nwildly together, and breathless anxiety, she followed his progress, as\r\nhis form was hurried onward.\r\n\r\nThe youth now appeared to redouble his exertions, for they were\r\napproaching the most dangerous part of the river.\r\n\r\nThe rush of waters at this spot was tremendous, and no one ventured to\r\napproach it, even in a canoe, lest he should be dashed to pieces.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, would be the youth\'s fate, unless he soon overtook the\r\nchild? He seemed fully sensible of the increasing peril, and now urged\r\nhis way through the foaming current with a desperate strength. Three\r\ntimes he was on the point of grasping the child, when the water\'s\r\nwhirled the prize from him.\r\n\r\nThe third effort was made just as they were entering within the\r\ninfluence of the current above the falls; and when it failed, the\r\nmother\'s heart sunk within her, and she groaned, fully expecting the\r\nyouth to give up his task.\r\n\r\nBut no; he only pressed forward the more eagerly; and, as they\r\nbreathlessly watched, amid the boiling waters, they saw the form of the\r\nyouth following close after that of the boy.\r\n\r\nAnd now both pursuer and pursued shot to the brink of the falls. An\r\ninstant they hung there, distinctly visible amid the foaming waters.\r\nEvery brain grew dizzy at the sight.\r\n\r\nBut a shout burst from the spectators, when they saw the child held\r\naloft by the right arm of the youth--a shout that was suddenly changed\r\nto a cry of horror, when they both vanished into the raging waters\r\nbelow!\r\n\r\nThe mother ran forward, and then stood gazing with fixed eyes at the\r\nfoot of the falls. Suddenly she gave the glad cry, "There they are! See!\r\nthey are safe! Great God, I thank Thee!"\r\n\r\nAnd, sure enough, there was the youth still unharmed. He had just\r\nemerged from the boiling vortex below the falls. With, one hand he held\r\naloft the child, and with the other he was making for the shore.\r\n\r\nThey ran, they shouted, they scarcely knew what they did, until they\r\nreached his side, just as he was struggling to the bank. They drew him\r\nout almost exhausted.\r\n\r\nThe boy was senseless; but his mother declared that he still lived, as\r\nshe pressed him to her bosom. The youth could scarcely stand, so faint\r\nwas he from his exertions.\r\n\r\nWho can describe the scene that followed--the mother\'s calmness while\r\nstriving to bring her boy to life, and her wild gratitude to his\r\npreserver, when the child was out of danger, and sweetly sleeping in her\r\narms?\r\n\r\n"God will give you a reward," said she. "He will do great things for you\r\nin return for this day\'s work, and the blessings of thousands besides\r\nmine will attend you."\r\n\r\nAnd so it was: for, to the hero of that hour were afterward confided the\r\ndestinies of a mighty nation. Throughout his long career, what tended to\r\nmake him honored and respected beyond all men, was the spirit of\r\nself-sacrifice which, in the rescue of that mother\'s child, as in the\r\nmore important events of his life, characterized George Washington.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDirections for Reading.--Read the first two pages of the lesson\r\nquietly, but not slowly.

Its eyes are large and bright, and the sense of sight so keen\r\nthat it can readily see a distance of from four to six miles. It hears\r\nand sees equally well, and can only be approached by stratagem.\r\n\r\nThe feathers of the male ostrich are of a glossy black, with the\r\nexception of the large plumes of the wing-feathers, which in both the\r\nmale and female are snowy white.\r\n\r\nTo procure these beautiful white plumes is the chief object in hunting\r\nthe ostrich. Those plumes when plucked are sent to foreign countries,\r\nand used to adorn ladies\' hats, and for various other purposes.\r\n\r\nThe ostrich feeds on vegetable substances; but as an aid to digestion,\r\nit sometimes swallows stones, glass, paper, nails, and pieces of wood.\r\n\r\nAn incident is related of an ostrich on exhibition in Paris, swallowing\r\na gold watch and chain. A gentleman approached within reach of the beak\r\nof the bird, and, in the twinkling of an eye, the watch and chain were\r\nsnatched from his pocket and swallowed.\r\n\r\nAlthough the ostrich has wings, it can not fly--it depends upon its\r\nstrong legs and feet for speed, and can run much faster than a horse.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the ostrich is marvelous. Its only weapon of defence is\r\nits long and muscular leg.\r\n\r\n[Illustration.]\r\n\r\nIt is accustomed to kick directly forward, and it is said by those who\r\nhave observed this habit, that a single blow from its gigantic two-toed\r\nfoot is sufficient to kill a panther, a jackal, or a hyena.\r\n\r\nNo better idea of its strength can be given than the fact of its being\r\nemployed for riding. A traveler, writing about two ostriches he saw in a\r\nvillage in Africa, says:\r\n\r\n"These gigantic birds were so tame that two boys mounted together the\r\nlarger one. The ostrich no sooner felt their weight, than it started\r\noff at full speed and carried them several times around the village.\r\n\r\n"This trial pleased me so much that I wished to have it repeated; and in\r\norder to test their strength, I had a full-grown man mount the smaller\r\nbird, and two men the larger bird.\r\n\r\n"At first, they started with caution; but presently they spread their\r\nwings and went off at such a speed that they seemed scarcely to touch\r\nthe ground."\r\n\r\nThe voice of the ostrich is deep and hollow, and is said to resemble at\r\ntimes the roar of the lion. The bird frequently makes a kind of cackling\r\nnoise, and when enraged at an enemy, it hisses very loudly.\r\n\r\nOstriches make their nests in the sand. One female will, in a single\r\nseason, lay from twenty to thirty eggs, weighing about three pounds\r\neach.\r\n\r\nMost of these she places in the nest, standing them on one end; but some\r\nof them are left outside of the nest as food for her young when they are\r\nhatched.\r\n\r\nThe natives of Africa are very fond of ostrich eggs, using them for\r\nfood. In taking the eggs, they exercise great caution; for should the\r\nbirds discover them, they would break all the eggs and leave the nest.\r\n\r\nYoung ostriches are readily tamed. Some families in Africa keep them as\r\nwe do chickens. They play with children, sleep in the houses, and when a\r\nfamily moves, the ostriches follow the camels, frequently carrying the\r\nchildren on their backs.\r\n\r\nWithin the past few years, ostriches have been brought to this country;\r\nand places called ostrich farms have been established in California and\r\nother States, for the purpose of raising them for their feathers.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage Lesson.--Let pupils point out any points that are omitted from\r\nthe following\r\n\r\nAnalysis.--1.

Passing through an orchard, he encountered a\r\nyoung girl about twelve years old. She was watching some pieces of\r\nlinen cloth which were stretched out on the grass for the purpose of\r\nbleaching.\r\n\r\nHetty--that was the girl\'s name--was seated under a tree with her\r\nknitting, and had near her a pail of water, from which she occasionally\r\nsprinkled the cloths to keep them damp.\r\n\r\nShe started up and was somewhat frightened when she saw a man leaping\r\nover the fence; but soon recognized him to be her cousin.\r\n\r\n"O, is it you, cousin!" exclaimed Hetty; "you frightened me--where are\r\nyou going?"\r\n\r\n"Hetty," he replied, "the soldiers are seeking for me, and I shall lose\r\nmy life, unless I can reach the boat before they come. I want you to\r\nrun down toward the shore and meet them."\r\n\r\n"They will surely ask for me; and then you must tell them that I have\r\ngone up the road to catch the mail-cart, and they will turn off the\r\nother way."\r\n\r\n"But, cousin, how can I say so?--it would not be true. O, why did you\r\ntell me which way you were going?"\r\n\r\n"Would you betray me, Hetty, and see me put to death? Hark! they are\r\ncoming. I hear the clink of their horses\' feet. Tell them I have gone\r\nup the road and Heaven will bless you."\r\n\r\n"Those who speak false words will never be happy," said Hetty. "But\r\nthey shall not compel me to tell which way you go, even if they kill\r\nme--so run as fast as you can."\r\n\r\n"I am afraid it is too late to run, Hetty; where can I hide myself?"\r\n\r\n"Be quick, cousin. Get down and lie under this cloth; I will throw it\r\nover you and go on sprinkling the linen."\r\n\r\n"I will do it, for it is my last chance."\r\n\r\nHe was soon concealed under the heavy folds of the long cloth. A few\r\nminutes afterward, a party of cavalry dashed along the road. An officer\r\nsaw the girl and called out to her in a loud voice--\r\n\r\n"Have you seen a man run this way?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir," replied Hetty.\r\n\r\n"Which way did he go?"\r\n\r\n"I promised not to tell, sir."\r\n\r\n"But you must tell me this instant; or it will be worse for you."\r\n\r\n"I will not tell, for I must keep my word."\r\n\r\n"Let me question her, for I think I know the child," said a man who was\r\nguide to the party. "Is your name Hetty Marvin?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"Perhaps the man who ran past you was your cousin?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir, he was."\r\n\r\n"Well, we wish to speak with him. What did he say to you when, he came\r\nby?"\r\n\r\n"He told me that he had to run to save his life."\r\n\r\n"Just so--that was quite true. I hope he will not have far to run. Where\r\nwas he going to hide himself?"\r\n\r\n"My cousin said that he would go to the river to find a boat, and he\r\nwanted me to tell the men in search of him that he had gone the other\r\nway to meet the mail-cart."\r\n\r\n"You are a good girl, Hetty, and we know you speak the truth. What did\r\nyour cousin say when he heard that you could not tell a lie to save his\r\nlife?"\r\n\r\n"He asked, would I betray him and see him put to death?"\r\n\r\n"And you said you would not tell, if you were killed for it."\r\n\r\nPoor Hetty\'s tears fell fast as she responded, "Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"Those were brave words, and I suppose he thanked you and ran down the\r\nroad as fast as he could?"\r\n\r\n"I promised not to tell which way he went, sir."\r\n\r\n"O yes, I forgot; but tell me his last words, and I will not trouble you\r\nany more."\r\n\r\n"He said, \'I will do it, for it is my last chance.\'"\r\n\r\nHetty was now oppressed with great fear; she sobbed aloud, and hid her\r\nface in her apron. The soldiers thought they had obtained all the\r\ninformation they could, and rode off toward the river-side.\r\n\r\nWhile Griswold lay hidden at the farm, he had agreed upon a signal with\r\nhis boatmen, that if in trouble he would put a white cloth by day, or a\r\nlight at night, in the attic window of his place of concealment. When\r\neither signal was seen, the men were to be on the watch, ready to render\r\nhim assistance in case of need.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had the soldiers ridden away, than Griswold\'s friends in the\r\nhouse hung out a white cloth from the window, to warn the boatmen, who\r\nthen pulled out to sea.\r\n\r\nThe boat, with two men in it, was nearly out of sight by the time the\r\nsoldiers reached the shore, and this caused them to conclude that\r\nGriswold had effected his escape.\r\n\r\nMeantime he lay safe and quiet until the time came for Hetty to go home\r\nto supper. Then he requested her to go and ask her mother to put the\r\nsignal-lamp in the window as it grew dark, and send him clothes and\r\nfood. The signal was seen, the boat returned, and Griswold made his way\r\nto it in safety.\r\n\r\nIn better days, when the war was over, and peace declared, he named one\r\nof his daughters Hetty Marvin, that he might daily think of the brave\r\nyoung cousin whose sense and truth-speaking had saved his life.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON LXVI.\r\n\r\n\r\ncon sume\', _use entirely; exhaust_.\r\n\r\ncul ti va\'tion, _attending to the growth of plants_.\r\n\r\nex\'ports, _the products of a country which are sold to other countries_\r\n\r\ntrans por ta\'tion, _carrying_.\r\n\r\no\'val, _shaped like an egg_.\r\n\r\nprin\'ci pal, _chief; that which is most important_.\r\n\r\nes\'ti mat ed, _stated in regard to quantity_.\r\n\r\nse lect\'ed, _chosen; picked out_.\r\n\r\nter\'mi nates, _comes to an end_.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTROPICAL FRUITS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThose who have not visited tropical countries, can scarcely imagine the\r\nwonders of their vegetation. There is nothing in the northern half of\r\nthe United States, with which to compare the richness of the vegetable\r\ngrowth of the tropics.\r\n\r\nIn the Southern States of our Union, as well as in Mexico and Central\r\nAmerica, there are found many of the same plants and trees that grow in\r\ncountries lying still nearer the equator.\r\n\r\nThe various kinds of fruits which grow in these countries, form a very\r\nlarge portion of the exports. Among those that are most commonly sent to\r\nus, are bananas, oranges, lemons, dates, cocoa-nuts, and figs.\r\n\r\nIn countries where the banana grows most abundantly, no article of food\r\nwhich the natives can obtain, requires so little trouble in its\r\ncultivation.\r\n\r\nOne has only to set out a few banana sprouts, and await the result. In a\r\nshort time, a juicy stem shoots up to the height of fifteen or twenty\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nIt is formed of nothing more than a number of leaf stalks rolled one\r\nover the other, and grows sometimes to a thickness of two feet.\r\n\r\nTwo gigantic leaves grow out from the top, ten feet long and two feet\r\nbroad. They are so very thin and tender that a light wind splits them\r\ninto ribbons.\r\n\r\nFrom the center of the leaves a very strong stalk rises up, which\r\nsupports the cluster of bananas. There are sometimes over one hundred\r\nbananas to a single stalk.\r\n\r\nA cluster of ripe bananas will weigh from sixty to seventy pounds, and\r\nrepresents a large amount of food. When a stalk has produced and ripened\r\nits fruit, it begins to wither and soon dies.\r\n\r\nIn a very short time, however, new sprouts spring up from the old root,\r\nand ere long the native has another cluster. So rapidly do they follow\r\neach other, that one cluster is scarcely consumed before another one is\r\nready to ripen.\r\n\r\nBananas ripened on the stalk will not bear transportation to any great\r\ndistance; therefore, when selected for export, the clusters are cut off\r\nwhile the bananas are very green.\r\n\r\nAnother valuable fruit of the tropics is the date. This fruit grows on a\r\ntree called the date-palm, that is found in both Asia and Africa.\r\n\r\nThe date-palm is a majestic tree, rising to the height of sixty feet or\r\nmore, without branches, and with a trunk of uniform thickness throughout\r\nits entire length.\r\n\r\nIt begins to bear fruit about eight years after it has been planted, and\r\ncontinues to be productive from seventy to one hundred years.\r\n\r\nDates are oval in shape, and have a long solid stone. They form the\r\nprincipal food of the inhabitants of some of the eastern countries, and\r\nare an important article of commerce.\r\n\r\nWhen they are perfectly ripe, they possess a delightful perfume, and are\r\nvery agreeable to the taste.\r\n\r\nIn preparing dates to be sent to distant countries, they are gathered a\r\nshort time before they are quite ripe, dried in the sun on mats, and\r\nfinally packed in boxes or straw sacks.\r\n\r\nTravelers in the deserts of Africa, often carry dried dates with them\r\nfor their chief food, during a journey of hundreds of miles.\r\n\r\nThe Arabs grind dried dates into a powder which they call date flour. If\r\nthis is packed away in a dry place, it will keep for years, and only has\r\nto be moistened with a little water to prepare it for eating.\r\n\r\nOne of the most valuable and productive of tropical trees is the\r\ncocoa-nut palm. It grows largely in both the East and West Indies, and\r\nelsewhere throughout the torrid zone.\r\n\r\nIt rises to a height of from sixty to one hundred feet, and terminates\r\nin a crown, of graceful, waving leaves. Some of these leaves reach a\r\nlength of twenty feet, and have the appearance of gigantic feathers.\r\n\r\nThe fruit consists of a thick outward husk of a fibrous structure, and\r\nwithin this, is the ordinary cocoa-nut of commerce.\r\n\r\nThe shell of the nut is hard and woody, and a little over a quarter of\r\nan inch in thickness. Next to this shell is the kernel, which is also a\r\nshell about half an inch thick, and composed of a white substance very\r\npleasant to the taste. Within this white eatable shell, is a milky\r\nliquid, called cocoa-nut milk.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe cocoa-nut is very useful to the natives of the regions in which it\r\ngrows. The nuts supply a large portion of their food, and the milky\r\nfluid inclosed within, forms a pleasant and refreshing drink.\r\n\r\nThe shell of the nut is made into cups, and from the kernel, cocoa-nut\r\noil is pressed out and largely used in making soap and for other\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nIn Ceylon, the tree is cultivated extensively. It is estimated that\r\nthere are twenty million trees in that island, and that each tree\r\nproduces about sixty nuts yearly. The wealth of a native is based upon\r\nthe number of cocoa-nut palms he owns.\r\n\r\nAnother well-known tropical fruit is the fig, which grows on a bush or\r\nsmall tree about eighteen or twenty feet high.\r\n\r\nThe fig-tree is now cultivated in all the Mediterranean countries, but\r\nthe larger portion of the American supply comes from western Asia and\r\nthe south of France.\r\n\r\nThe varieties are extremely numerous, and the fruit is of various\r\ncolors, from deep purple to yellow, or nearly white.\r\n\r\nThe trees usually bear two crops--one in the early summer, the other in\r\nthe autumn.\r\n\r\nWhen ripe, the figs are picked and spread out to dry in the sun. Thus\r\nprepared, the fruit is packed closely in barrels, baskets, or wooden\r\nboxes, for commerce.\r\n\r\nOranges and lemons are cultivated in nearly all warm countries. They\r\ngrow on trees somewhat smaller than apple trees, and must be picked for\r\nexport while they are hard and green.\r\n\r\nThey ripen during transportation, so that green oranges put up and sent\r\nto us from Sicily or other distant points, change to a golden yellow\r\ncolor by the time they reach us.\r\n\r\nOranges are grown largely in Florida and Louisiana, extensive orange\r\norchards being frequently met with in traveling through those States.\r\nThe oranges grown there are considered very choice, and are generally\r\nsweeter than those brought from Italy.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage Lesson.--Define the following words, giving the meaning of\r\neach part as indicated by hyphens: _ex-port-ing, un-common-ly,\r\ndis-trust-ful, pro-vid-ing, un-bear-able, un-hope-ful_.\r\n\r\nThe syllables _placed before_ a stem are called _prefixes_; those\r\n_placed after_ a stem, _suffixes_.\r\n\r\nThe words _shall_ and _will_ are used to indicate _future time_; as, I\r\nshall go; you will go; he will go.\r\n\r\nThe three tenses of an action may in a general way be represented by the\r\nwords _yesterday, to-day_, and _to-morrow_.\r\n\r\nLet pupils fill blanks in the following statements, and state the tense\r\nof each action.\r\n\r\n    We ---- go to see them next week.\r\n\r\n    John ---- last night.\r\n\r\n    You and I ---- in school at the present time.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON LXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nfound\'ed, _established; placed_.\r\n\r\ngar\'ri son, _soldiers stationed in a fort or town_.\r\n\r\nstrode, _walked with long steps_.\r\n\r\ncoun\'cil, _a number of men called together for advice_.\r\n\r\nin cit\'ing, _moving to action_.\r\n\r\nde vot\'ed, _very much attached_.\r\n\r\nde feat\'ed, _overcome_.\r\n\r\ncul\'ture, _a high state of knowledge_.\r\n\r\nor\'na ment ed, _adorned_.\r\n\r\nwam\'pum, _shells used by the Indians as money or for ornament_.\r\n\r\nfan tas\'tic, _wild; irregular_.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STORY OF DETROIT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe early history of Detroit is highly romantic. It was founded in 1701\r\nas a military colony.\r\n\r\nIt soon became one of the most important of the western outposts of\r\nCanada, and as the French and Indians were usually on the most friendly\r\nterms, the colony for a long time existed in a state of happiness and\r\ncontentment.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the French War, Detroit contained over two thousand\r\ninhabitants. Canadian dwellings with their lovely gardens lined the\r\nbanks of the river for miles.\r\n\r\nWithin the limits of the settlement were several Indian villages. Here\r\nthe light-hearted French-Canadian smoked his pipe and told his story,\r\nand the friendly Indian supplied him with game and joined in his\r\nmerry-making.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1760, Detroit was taken possession of by the English. The\r\nIndians hated the English, as much as they had loved the French.\r\n\r\nPontiac, the ruling spirit of the forests at this time, was a most\r\npowerful and statesmanlike chief. When he found that his friends, the\r\nFrench, had lost their power, he sought to unite the Indian tribes\r\nagainst the English colonies, and to destroy the English garrison at\r\nDetroit by strategy.\r\n\r\nHe was chief of the Ottawas, but possessed great influence over several\r\nother tribes. Pontiac believed, and that truly, that the establishment\r\nof English colonies would be fatal to the interests of the Indian race.\r\n\r\nHe strode through the forests like a giant, inciting the tribes to war.\r\nHe urged a union of all the Indian nations from the lakes to the\r\nMississippi for the common defense of the race.\r\n\r\nThere lived near Detroit a beautiful Indian girl, called Catharine. The\r\nEnglish commander, Gladwyn, was pleased with her, and showed her many\r\nfavors, and she formed a warm friendship for him.\r\n\r\nOne lovely day in May, this girl came to the fort and brought Gladwyn a\r\npair of elk-skin moccasins. She appeared very sad.\r\n\r\n"Catharine," said Gladwyn, "what troubles you to-day?"\r\n\r\nShe did not answer at once. There was a silent struggle going on in her\r\nheart. She had formed a strong attachment for the white people, and she\r\nwas also devoted to her own race.\r\n\r\n"To-morrow," she said at length, "Pontiac will come to the fort with\r\nsixty of his chiefs. Each will be armed with a gun, which will be cut\r\nshort and hidden under his blanket. The chief will ask to hold a\r\ncouncil. He will then make a speech, and offer a belt of wampum as a\r\npeace-offering.\r\n\r\n"As soon as he holds up the belt, the chiefs will spring up and shoot\r\nthe officers, and the Indians outside will attack the English. Every\r\nEnglishman will be killed. The French inhabitants will be spared."\r\n\r\nGladwyn made immediate preparations to avoid the danger which threatened\r\nthem. The soldiers were put under arms. Orders were given to have them\r\ndrawn up in line on the arrival of the Indians the following day.\r\n\r\nThe next morning Indian canoes approached the fort from the eastern\r\nshores. They contained Pontiac and his sixty chiefs. At ten o\'clock the\r\nchiefs marched to the fort, in fantastic procession. Each wore a colored\r\nblanket, and was painted, plumed, or in some way gaily ornamented.\r\n\r\nAs Pontiac entered the fort, a glance showed him that his plot was\r\ndiscovered. He passed in amazement through glittering rows of steel, he\r\nmade a speech, expressing friendship; but he did not dare to lift the\r\nwampum belt which was to have been the signal for attack. He was allowed\r\nto depart peaceably.\r\n\r\nWhen he found that his plot had been discovered, his anger knew no\r\nbounds. He gathered his warriors from every hand and laid siege to\r\nDetroit. He was defeated, and with his defeat ended the power of the\r\nIndian tribes in the region of the Upper Lakes.\r\n\r\nDetroit became an English town, and afterward an American city. She has\r\ngathered to herself the wealth of the fertile regions which lie around\r\nher, as well as the commerce of the broad inland seas on either hand.\r\nTo-day she has more than one hundred and twenty thousand inhabitants,\r\nand is famous for her wealth and culture.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage Lesson.--Let pupils review, as a written exercise, the\r\nspelling of the following words.\r\n\r\n\r\n    treasure   rheumatism    group         desperate\r\n    release    mischievous   courtesy      separate\r\n    weary      approach      redoubled     vegetable\r\n    stealthy   caution       mighty        stratagem\r\n    peasants   exhausted     fortnight     spectator\r\n    concealed  draughts      knowledge     necessary\r\n    freight    guidance      flickering    particular\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the sentences given below, change the verbs so as to represent the\r\naction as completed.\r\n\r\n"The chiefs march to the fort in fantastic procession.

It is a sort of work in which he can appear to be very active, and\r\nyet not do much.\r\n\r\nIn my day maple-sugar-making used to be something between picnicking and\r\nbeing shipwrecked on a fertile island, where one should save from the\r\nwreck, tubs and augers, and great kettles and pork, and hen\'s-eggs and\r\nrye-and-indian bread, and begin at once to lead the sweetest life in the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nI am told that it is something different nowadays, and that there is\r\nmore desire to save the sap, and make good, pure sugar, and sell it for\r\na large price.\r\n\r\nI am told that it is the custom to carefully collect the sap and bring\r\nit to the house, where there are built brick arches, over which it is\r\nevaporated in shallow pans, and that pains are taken to keep the leaves,\r\nsticks, ashes and coals out of it, and that the sugar is clarified.\r\n\r\nIn short, that it is a money-making business, in which there is very\r\nlittle fun, and that the boy is not allowed to dip his paddle into the\r\nkettle of boiling sugar and lick off the delicious syrup.\r\n\r\nAs I remember, the country boy used to be on the lookout in the spring\r\nfor the sap to begin running. I think he discovered it as soon as\r\nanybody.\r\n\r\nPerhaps he knew it by a feeling of something starting in his own\r\nveins--a sort of spring stir in his legs and arms, which tempted him to\r\nstand on his head, or throw a handspring, if he could find a spot of\r\nground from which the snow had melted.\r\n\r\nThe sap stirs early in the legs of a country boy, and shows itself in\r\nuneasiness in the toes, which, get tired of boots, and want to come out\r\nand touch the soil just as soon as the sun has warmed it a little.\r\n\r\nThe country boy goes barefoot just as naturally as the trees burst their\r\nbuds, which were packed and varnished over in the fall to keep the water\r\nand the frost out.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the boy has been out digging into the maple-trees with his\r\njack-knife; at any rate, he is pretty sure to announce the discovery as\r\nhe comes running into the house in a state of great excitement, with\r\n"Sap\'s runnin\'!"\r\n\r\nAnd then, indeed, the stir and excitement begin. The sap-buckets, which\r\nhave been stored in the wood-house, are brought down and set out on the\r\nsouth side of the house and scalded.\r\n\r\nThe snow is still a foot or more deep in the woods, and the ox-sled is\r\ngot out to make a road to the sugar camp. The boy is every-where\r\npresent, superintending every thing, asking questions, and filled with a\r\ndesire to help the excitement.\r\n\r\nIt is a great day when the cart is loaded with the buckets, and the\r\nprocession starts into the woods. The sun shines brightly; the snow is\r\nsoft and beginning to sink down; the snow-birds are twittering about,\r\nand the noise of shouting and of the blows of the axe echoes far and\r\nwide.\r\n\r\nIn the first place the men go about and tap the trees, drive in the\r\nspouts, and hang the buckets under. The boy watches all these operations\r\nwith the greatest interest.\r\n\r\nHe wishes that some time when a hole is bored into a tree that the sap\r\nwould spout out in a stream, as it does when a cider-barrel is tapped.\r\n\r\nBut it never does, it only drops, sometimes almost in a stream, but on\r\nthe whole slowly, and the boy learns that the sweet things of the world\r\nhave to be patiently waited for, and do not usually come otherwise than\r\ndrop by drop.\r\n\r\nThen the camp is to be cleared of snow. The shanty is re-covered with\r\nboughs. In front of it two enormous logs are rolled nearly together, and\r\na fire is built between them.\r\n\r\nForked sticks are set at each end, and a long pole is laid on them, and\r\non this are hung the great iron kettles. The huge hogsheads are turned\r\nright side up, and cleaned out to receive the sap that is gathered.\r\n\r\nThe great fire that is kindled is never allowed to go out, night or day,\r\nso long as the season lasts. Somebody is always cutting wood to feed it;\r\nsomebody is busy most of the time gathering in the sap.\r\n\r\nSomebody is required to watch the kettles that they do not boil over,\r\nand to fill them. It is not the boy, however; he is too busy with things\r\nin general to be of any use in details.\r\n\r\nHe has his own little sap-yoke and small pails, with which he gathers\r\nthe sweet liquid. He has a little boiling-place of his own, with small\r\nlogs and a tiny kettle.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDirections for Reading.--In the second line of the lesson, after the\r\nword _more_, a pause should be made for the purpose of giving special\r\neffect to the words which follow.

This is the grand event, and is only done once\r\nin two or three days.\r\n\r\nBut the boy\'s desire is to "sugar off" all the time. He boils his kettle\r\ndown as rapidly as possible; he is not particular about chips, scum, or\r\nashes.\r\n\r\nHe is apt to burn his sugar; but if he can get enough to make a little\r\nwax on the snow, or to scrape from the bottom of the kettle with his\r\nwooden paddle, he is happy.\r\n\r\nA great deal is wasted on his hands, and the outside of his face, and on\r\nhis clothes, but he does not care; he is not stingy.\r\n\r\nTo watch the operations of the big fire gives him constant pleasure.\r\nSometimes he is left to watch the boiling kettles, with a piece of pork\r\ntied on the end of a stick, which he dips into the boiling mass when it\r\nthreatens to go over.\r\n\r\nHe is constantly tasting of it, however, to see if it is not almost\r\nsyrup. He has a long, round stick, whittled smooth at one end, which he\r\nuses for this purpose, at the constant risk of burning his tongue.\r\n\r\nThe smoke blows in his face; he is grimy with ashes; he is altogether\r\nsuch a mass of dirt, stickiness, and sweetness, that his own mother\r\nwouldn\'t know him.\r\n\r\nHe likes to boil eggs with the hired man in the hot sap; he likes to\r\nroast potatoes in the ashes, and he would live in the camp day and night\r\nif he were permitted.\r\n\r\nTo sleep there with the men, and awake in the night and hear the wind in\r\nthe trees, and see the sparks fly up to the sky, is a perfect\r\nrealization of all the stories of adventures he has ever read.\r\n\r\nHe tells the other boys afterward that he heard something in the night\r\nthat sounded very much like a bear. The hired man says that he was very\r\nmuch scared by the hooting of an owl.\r\n\r\nThe great occasions for the boy, though, are the times of "sugaring\r\noff." Sometimes this used to be done in the evening, and it was made the\r\nexcuse for a frolic in the camp.\r\n\r\nThe neighbors were invited; sometimes even the pretty girls from the\r\nvillage, who filled all the woods with their sweet voices and merry\r\nlaughter, were there, too.\r\n\r\nThe tree branches all show distinctly in the light of the fire, which\r\nlights up the bough shanty, the hogsheads, the buckets on the trees, and\r\nthe group about the boiling kettles, until the scene is like something\r\ntaken out of a fairy play.\r\n\r\nAt these sugar parties every one was expected to eat as much sugar as\r\npossible; and those who are practiced in it can eat a great deal.\r\n\r\nIt is a peculiar fact about eating warm maple sugar, that though you\r\nmay eat so much of it one day as to be sick, you will want it the next\r\nday more than ever.\r\n\r\nAt the "sugaring off" they used to pour the hot sugar upon the snow,\r\nwhere it congealed into a sort of wax, which I suppose is the most\r\ndelicious substance that was ever invented. And it takes a great while\r\nto eat it.\r\n\r\nIf you should close your teeth firmly on a lump of it, you would be\r\nunable to open your mouth until it dissolved. The sensation while it is\r\nmelting is very pleasant, but it will not do to try to talk, for you can\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nThe boy used to make a big lump of it and give it to the dog, who seized\r\nit with great avidity, and closed his jaws on it, as dogs will on any\r\nthing.\r\n\r\nIt was funny the next moment to see the expression of perfect surprise\r\non the dog\'s face when he found that he could not open his jaws.\r\n\r\nHe shook his head; he sat down in despair; he ran round in a circle; he\r\ndashed into the woods and back again.\r\n\r\nHe did every thing except climb a tree, and howl. It would have been\r\nsuch a relief to him if he could have howled. But that was the one thing\r\nhe could not do.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage Lesson.--Let pupils change the verbs in the following lines,\r\nso that they will indicate _present time_.\r\n\r\n"He shook his head; he sat down in despair; he ran around in a circle;\r\nhe dashed into the woods and back again."\r\n\r\nSuggestion.--Let the teacher, from time to time, select stories, and\r\nhave them read before the class.

She was built about the beginning of\r\nthe present century, and owing to her good fortune in many engagements,\r\nher seamen gave her the name of "Old Ironsides."\r\n\r\nShe was in active service throughout the entire war, and captured five\r\nships of war from the British, two of which were frigates.\r\n\r\nIn all her service, her success was remarkable. She never lost her\r\nmasts, never went ashore, and though so often in battle, no very serious\r\nloss of life ever occurred on her decks. Her entire career was that of\r\nwhat is called in the navy "a lucky ship."\r\n\r\nPerhaps this may be explained by the fact that she always had excellent\r\ncommanders, and that she probably possessed as fine a ship\'s company as\r\never manned a frigate.\r\n\r\nIn 1829, the Government ordered the Constitution to be dismantled and\r\ntaken to pieces, because she had become unfit for service.\r\n\r\nAt that time, Oliver Wendell Holmes, who has since become famous as a\r\nwriter, was a young man twenty years of age, about completing his\r\nstudies at Harvard College.\r\n\r\nWhen he heard of the intended destruction of "Old Ironsides," he went\r\ndirectly to his room, and, inspired by patriotic feelings, wrote the\r\nfollowing poem.\r\n\r\n\r\nOLD IRONSIDES.\r\n\r\n  Ay, tear her tattered ensign down!\r\n    Long has it waved on high,\r\n  And many an eye has danced to see\r\n    That banner in the sky;\r\n  Beneath it rung the battle shout\r\n    And burst the cannons\' roar:\r\n  The meteor of the ocean air\r\n    Shall sweep the clouds no more.\r\n\r\n  Her deck, once red with heroes\' blood,\r\n    Where knelt the vanquished foe,\r\n  When winds were hurrying o\'er the flood\r\n    And waves were white below,\r\n  No more shall feel the victors\' tread,\r\n    Or know the conquered knee:\r\n  The harpies of the shore shall pluck\r\n    The eagle of the sea!\r\n\r\n  O, better that her shattered hulk\r\n    Should sink beneath the wave!--\r\n  Her thunders shook the mighty deep,\r\n    And there should be her grave.\r\n  Nail to the mast her holy flag,\r\n    Set every threadbare sail,\r\n  And give her to the god of storms,\r\n    The lightning, and the gale!\r\n\r\n\r\nThe effect of this poem upon the people was so great that a general\r\noutcry arose against the destruction of the gallant old ship.\r\n\r\nThe Government was induced to reconsider its determination. The old ship\r\nwas saved, repaired, and for many years has delighted the eyes of\r\nthousands of people who have visited her.\r\n\r\nAt present, she is used as a receiving-ship at the United States Navy\r\nYard, Portsmouth, New Hampshire.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDirections for Reading.--With what tone of voice should the prose part\r\nof the lesson be read?\r\n\r\nRead the poetry--first, slowly and quietly; then, in a loud tone of\r\nvoice, expressing the feeling of anger.\r\n\r\nWhich method of reading the poem do the pupils prefer?\r\n\r\nWhich do they think represents the poet\'s feelings?\r\n\r\nLet pupils pronounce in concert, and singly, the following words: _hero,\r\nyear, people, deep, eagle, knee, serious, meteor, complete, pieces_.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage Lesson.--Let pupils point out and explain the unusual\r\nexpressions found in the first two stanzas, writing out a list of the\r\nchanges made.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON LXXII.\r\n\r\n\r\nver\'tic al, _upright_.\r\n\r\ncat\'a ract, _a great fall of water over a precipice_.\r\n\r\npro vis\'ions, _stock of food_.\r\n\r\ncon struct\'ed, _made; formed_.\r\n\r\nin cred\'i ble, _not easily believed_.\r\n\r\nsta\'tion a ry, _not moving; fixed_.\r\n\r\nex tinct\', _inactive; dead_.\r\n\r\nde pos\'it, _that which is laid or thrown down_.\r\n\r\nap\'er ture, _an opening_.\r\n\r\ndi am\'e ter, _distance across or through_.\r\n\r\ncom pris\'es, _includes; contains_.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURAL WONDERS OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin the vast extent of territory belonging to the United States,\r\nthere are many wonderful natural curiosities which attract visitors from\r\nall parts of the world.\r\n\r\nA short description of some of the principal attractions is here given,\r\nwith the hope that many who read this lesson, may at some time visit a\r\npart or all that are noticed.\r\n\r\n\r\nGEYSERS OF THE YELLOWSTONE PARK.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Yellowstone Park is a tract of country fifty-five by sixty-five\r\nmiles in extent, lying mainly in the northwest corner of the Territory\r\nof Wyoming, but including a narrow belt in southern Montana. It\r\ncontains nearly thirty-six hundred square miles, and is nearly three\r\ntimes as large as the State of Rhode Island. No equal extent of country\r\non the globe comprises such a union of grand and wonderful scenery.\r\n\r\nNumerous hot springs, steam jets, and extinct geyser cones exist in the\r\nYellowstone basin. Just beyond the western rim of the basin, lies the\r\ngrand geyser region of Fire-Hole River.\r\n\r\nScattered along both banks of this stream are boiling springs from two\r\nto twelve feet across, all in active operation.\r\n\r\nOne of the most noted geysers of this district is "Old Faithful." It\r\nstands on a mound thirty feet high, the crater rising some six feet\r\nhigher still.\r\n\r\nThe eruptions take place about once an hour, and continue fifteen or\r\ntwenty minutes, the column of water shooting upward with terrific force,\r\nfrom one hundred to one hundred and fifty feet.\r\n\r\nThe great mass of water falls directly back into the basin, flowing over\r\nthe edges and down the sides in large streams. When the action ceases,\r\nthe water recedes from sight, and nothing is heard but an occasional\r\nescape of steam until another eruption occurs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nJust across the river and close to the margin, a small conical mound is\r\nobserved, about three feet high, and five feet in diameter at the base.\r\n\r\nNo one would suspect it to be an active geyser. But in 1871, a column of\r\nwater entirely filling the crater shot from it, which by actual\r\nmeasurement was found to be two hundred and nineteen feet high.\r\n\r\nNot more than a hundred yards from the river, there is a large oval\r\naperture eighteen feet wide and twenty-five feet long. The sides are\r\ncovered with a grayish-white deposit which is distinctly visible at a\r\ndepth of a hundred feet below the surface.\r\n\r\nThis geyser is known as the "Giantess," and a visitor in describing it\r\nstates that "no water could be discovered on the first approach, but it\r\ncould be distinctly heard gurgling and boiling at a great distance\r\nbelow. Suddenly it began to rise, spluttering and sending out huge\r\nvolumes of steam, causing a general scattering of our company.\r\n\r\n"When within about forty feet of the surface, it became stationary, and\r\nwe returned to look upon it. All at once it rose with incredible\r\nrapidity, the hot water bursting from the opening with terrific force,\r\nrising in a column the full size of this immense aperture to the height\r\nof sixty feet.\r\n\r\n"Through, and out of the top of this mass, five or six lesser jets or\r\nround columns of water, varying in size from six to fifteen inches in\r\ndiameter, were projected to the marvelous height of two hundred and\r\nfifty feet."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: View in the Grand Ca\xc3\xb1on]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CA\xc3\x91ONS OF THE COLORADO RIVER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe length of the Colorado River, from the sources of the Green River,\r\nis about two thousand miles.\r\n\r\nFor five hundred miles of this distance, the river has worn deep cuts or\r\ngorges through the soft rock, called ca\xc3\xb1ons.\r\n\r\nThe rocky sides of these ca\xc3\xb1ons form lofty vertical walls, which, in\r\nsome places, rise to a height of more than a mile above the surface of\r\nthe water.\r\n\r\nThe largest and most noted of these vast gorges is the Grand Ca\xc3\xb1on,\r\nwhich extends a distance of more than two hundred miles. The height of\r\nthe walls of this ca\xc3\xb1on varies from four thousand to seven thousand\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nThe river, as it runs through it, is from fifty to three hundred feet\r\nwide. So swift is the current, that it is almost impossible to float a\r\nboat down the stream without having it dashed to pieces against the\r\nrocky walls on either side.\r\n\r\nThe first descent through these ca\xc3\xb1ons was made in 1867, from a point on\r\nGrand River, about thirty miles above its junction with Green River.\r\n\r\nThree men were prospecting for gold, and being attacked by Indians and\r\none of their number killed, the other two decided to attempt the descent\r\nof the river, rather than retrace their steps through a country where\r\nIndians were numerous.\r\n\r\nThey constructed a raft of a few pieces of drift-wood, and having\r\nsecured their arms and provisions, commenced their journey down the\r\nstream.\r\n\r\nA few days afterward, while the raft was descending a cataract, one of\r\nthe men was drowned and all the provisions were washed overboard.\r\n\r\nThe third man, hemmed in by the walls of the ca\xc3\xb1on, continued the\r\njourney alone amid great perils from cataracts, rocks, and whirlpools.\r\n\r\nFor ten days he pursued, his lonely way, tasting food but twice during\r\nthe whole time. Once he obtained a few green pods and leaves from bushes\r\ngrowing along the stream, and the second time from some friendly\r\nIndians.\r\n\r\nAt last he succeeded in reaching Callville in safety, after having\r\nfloated several hundred miles.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON LXXIII.\r\n\r\n\r\npro por\'tions, _relations of parts to each other_.\r\n\r\nin te\'ri or, _the inside_.\r\n\r\nal a bas\'ter, _a kind of whitish stone_.\r\n\r\nchasm, _a deep opening_.\r\n\r\na\'re a, _any surface, as the floor of a room_.\r\n\r\nan\'cient, _belonging to past ages_.\r\n\r\nun ex am\'pled, _without a similar case_.\r\n\r\nco los\'sal, _of great size_.\r\n\r\nfeat\'ure, _any thing worthy of notice_.\r\n\r\ndra\'per y, _hangings of any kind_.\r\n\r\no ver awed\', _held in a state of fear_.\r\n\r\nsur pass\'ing, _exceeding others_.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNATURAL WONDERS OF AMERICA.\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAMMOTH CAVE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1809, a hunter named Hutchins, while pursuing a bear in\r\nEdmondson County, Kentucky, was surprised to see the animal disappear\r\ninto a small opening in the side of a hill.\r\n\r\nUpon examining the spot, Hutchins found that the opening led into a\r\ncave. Following up the examination soon after, it was discovered that\r\nthe cave was immense in its proportions.\r\n\r\nOn account of its great size, it was named Mammoth Cave. It has an area\r\nof several hundred square miles, and two hundred and twenty-three known\r\nand numbered avenues, with a united length of from one hundred and\r\nfifty to two hundred miles.\r\n\r\nThe interior of this cave is divided by huge columns and walls of stone\r\ninto chambers of various shapes and sizes. Some of these are large\r\nenough to afford standing room for thousands of people.\r\n\r\nOne of the largest of these chambers is called Mammoth Dome. This room\r\nis four hundred feet long, one hundred and fifty feet wide, and two\r\nhundred and fifty feet in height.\r\n\r\nThe walls of this grand room are curtained by alabaster drapery in\r\nvertical folds and present to the eye a scene of unexampled beauty and\r\ngrandeur.\r\n\r\nA large gateway at one end of this room opens into another room, in\r\nwhich the position of the huge stone pillars, reminds one of the ruins\r\nof some ancient temple.\r\n\r\nSix colossal columns, or pillars, eighty feet high and twenty-five feet\r\nin diameter, standing in a half circle, are among the imposing\r\nattractions of this wonderful room.\r\n\r\nAnother striking feature of Mammoth Cave is what is called the Dead Sea.\r\nThis body of water is four hundred feet long, forty feet wide, and very\r\ndeep.\r\n\r\nA curious fish is found in this dark lake. It is without eyes, and, in\r\nform and color, is different from any fish found outside the cave.\r\n\r\nThere are found also a blind grasshopper, without wings, and a blind\r\ncrayfish of a whitish color, both of which are very curious and\r\ninteresting.\r\n\r\nThe fact that these living creatures are blind would seem to indicate\r\nthat nature had produced them for the distinct purpose of inhabiting\r\nthis dark cave.\r\n\r\n\r\nNIAGARA FALLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the sights to be seen on this continent, there is none that\r\nequals the great Falls of Niagara River, situated about twelve miles\r\nnorth of Buffalo, in the State of New York.\r\n\r\nOn first beholding this most wonderful of all known cataracts, one is\r\noverawed by its surpassing grandeur, "and stunned by the sound of the\r\nfalling waters as by a roar of thunder."\r\n\r\nFor quite a distance above the falls, the Niagara River is about one\r\nmile wide, and flows with great swiftness.\r\n\r\nJust at the edge of the cataract stands Goat Island, which divides the\r\nwaters of the river, and makes two distinct cataracts; one on the\r\nCanadian side, and one on the American side of the river.\r\n\r\nThe one on the Canadian side, called from its shape the Horse-shoe Fall,\r\nis eighteen hundred feet wide, and one hundred, and fifty-eight feet\r\nhigh. The other, called the American Fall, is six hundred feet wide, and\r\none hundred and sixty-four feet high.\r\n\r\nAs the immense body of water leaps over this vast precipice, it breaks\r\ninto a soft spray, which waves like a plume in the wind. At times, when\r\nthe rays of the sun strike this spray, a rainbow is formed which\r\nstretches itself across the deep chasm, and produces a beautiful effect.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter, much of the water and spray freezes, and as each\r\nmoment adds to the frozen mass, some curious and wonderful ice\r\nformations are produced.\r\n\r\nSometimes, during a very cold winter, the ice at the foot of the falls\r\nforms a complete bridge from one shore to the other.\r\n\r\nAn interesting feature of a visit to these falls is a descent to the\r\nlevel of the foot of the cataract behind the great sheet of water.\r\n\r\nA long flight of steps leads down to a secure footing between the rocky\r\nprecipice and the falling torrent. By a narrow footpath, it is possible\r\nfor the visitor to pass between this column of water and the wall of\r\nrock.\r\n\r\nOnce behind the sheet of water, the roar is deafening. One can only\r\ncling to the narrow railing or his guide, as he picks his way for more\r\nthan a hundred feet behind the roaring torrent.\r\n\r\nA single misstep, a slip, or a fall, and nothing remains but a horrible\r\ndeath by being dashed to pieces upon the jagged rocks below.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDirections for Reading.--Point out four places in the lesson where\r\nwords would likely be run together by a careless reader.\r\n\r\nThe word _ca\xc3\xb1on_ is pronounced _can\'yon_.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage Lesson.--Give rules for marks of punctuation and capital\r\nletters used in the first paragraph of the account of Niagara Falls.\r\n\r\nLet pupils make out an _analysis_ in five or six parts, treating some\r\nwell-known scene.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON LXXIV.\r\n\r\n\r\nvo ra\'cious, _greedy; very hungry_.\r\n\r\no ver whelmed\', _overcome by force of numbers_.\r\n\r\na bound\'ing, _existing in large numbers_.\r\n\r\nas cend\'ing, _going up_.\r\n\r\nher\'ald ed, _gave notice of_.\r\n\r\nim pet\'u ous, _furious; without care for what happens_.\r\n\r\ncrim\'i nals, _those who have broken the law_.\r\n\r\ncon\'cen trate, _gather in a large mass_.\r\n\r\nin tol\'er a ble, _not to be borne_.\r\n\r\nir re sist\'i ble, _can not be opposed_.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAFRICAN ANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nA strange kind of ant is very abundant in the whole region I have\r\ntraveled over in Africa, and is the most voracious creature I ever met.\r\nIt is the dread of all living animals, from the leopard to the smallest\r\ninsect.\r\n\r\nI do not think that these ants build nests or homes of any kind. At any\r\nrate they carry nothing away, but eat all their prey on the spot. It is\r\ntheir habit to march through the forests in a long, regular line--a line\r\nabout two inches broad and often several miles in length. All along this\r\nline are larger ants, who act as officers, stand outside the ranks, and\r\nkeep this singular army in order.\r\n\r\nIf they come to a place where there are no trees to shelter them from\r\nthe sun, whose heat they can not bear, they immediately build\r\nunderground tunnels, through which the whole army passes in columns to\r\nthe forest beyond. These tunnels are four or five feet underground, and\r\nare used only in the heat of the day, or during a storm.\r\n\r\nWhen, they grow hungry the long file spreads itself through the forest\r\nin a front line, and attacks and devours all it overtakes with a fury\r\nwhich is quite irresistible. The elephant and gorilla fly before this\r\nattack. The black men run for their lives. Every animal that lives in\r\ntheir line of march is chased.\r\n\r\nThey seem to understand and act upon the tactics of Napoleon, and\r\nconcentrate with great speed their heaviest forces upon the point of\r\nattack. In an incredibly short space of time the mouse, or dog, or\r\nleopard, or deer, is overwhelmed, killed, eaten, and the bare skeleton\r\nonly remains.\r\n\r\nThey seem to travel night and day. Many a time have I been awakened out\r\nof a sleep, and obliged to rush from the hut and into the water to save\r\nmy life, and after all suffered intolerable agony from the bites of the\r\nadvance-guard, that had got into my clothes.\r\n\r\nWhen they enter a house they clear it of all living things. Cockroaches\r\nare devoured in an instant. Rats and mice spring round the room in vain.\r\nAn overwhelming force of ants kill a strong rat in less than a minute,\r\nin spite of the most frantic struggles, and in less than another minute\r\nits bones are stripped. Every living thing in the house is devoured.\r\n\r\nThey will not touch vegetable matter. Thus they are in reality very\r\nuseful, as well as dangerous, to the natives, who have their huts\r\ncleaned of all the abounding vermin, such as immense cockroaches and\r\ncentipedes, at least several times a year.\r\n\r\nWhen on their march the insect world flies before them, and I have often\r\nhad the approach of an ant-army heralded to me by this means. Wherever\r\nthey go they make a clean sweep, even ascending to the tops of the\r\nhighest trees in pursuit of their prey.\r\n\r\nTheir manner of attack is an impetuous leap. Instantly the strong\r\npincers are fastened, and they let go only when the piece gives way.\r\n\r\nAt such times this little animal seems animated by a kind of fury which\r\ncauses it to disregard entirely its own safety, and to seek only the\r\nconquest of its prey. The bite of these ants is very painful.\r\n\r\nThe natives relate that in former times it was the custom to expose\r\ncriminals in the path of these ants, as the most cruel way that was\r\nknown of putting them to death.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDirections for Reading.--Name the _emphatic words_ in the last\r\nparagraph of the lesson, and mark the _inflections_.\r\n\r\nIn determining upon the _emphasis_ to be given to the words of a\r\nsentence, the only guide we have to follow is the _meaning_.

For many centuries, it was a thickly populated country, and at one\r\ntime possessed great influence and wealth, and had reached an advanced\r\nstate of civilization.\r\n\r\nThe history of Egypt extends through a period of about six thousand\r\nyears. During this time great cities were built which flourished for\r\nhundreds of years.\r\n\r\nOwing to wars and changes of government many of these cities were\r\ndestroyed, and nothing of them now remains but massive and extensive\r\nruins.\r\n\r\nPyramids were built, obelisks erected, canals projected, and many other\r\nvast enterprises were carried out.\r\n\r\nRemains of these are to be seen to-day, some in ruins, some fairly\r\npreserved, and, altogether, they give present generations an idea of the\r\nwealth and power of the different dynasties under which they were built.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNot far from Cairo, which is now the principal city of Egypt, are the\r\nfamous pyramids. These are of such immense proportions, that from a\r\ndistance their tops seem to reach the clouds.\r\n\r\nThey are constructed of blocks of stone. Some of these blocks are of\r\ngreat size, and how the builders ever put them into their places, is a\r\nquestion we can not answer.\r\n\r\nIt is supposed that the construction of one of these pyramids required\r\nmore than twenty years\' labor from thousands of men.\r\n\r\nThe largest pyramid is four hundred and sixty-one feet high, seven\r\nhundred and forty-six feet long at the base, and covers more than twelve\r\nacres of ground. In all, sixty-seven of these pyramids have been\r\ndiscovered and explored.\r\n\r\nThey are the tombs in which the ancient kings and their families were\r\nburied. In the interior of these pyramids, many chambers were\r\nconstructed to contain their stone coffins.\r\n\r\nIt has been calculated that one of the principal pyramids could contain\r\nthree thousand seven hundred rooms of large size.\r\n\r\nThe bodies of those who were buried in the pyramids were preserved from\r\ndecay by a secret process, known only to the priests.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAfter the bodies were prepared, they were wrapped in bands of fine\r\nlinen, and on the inside of these was spread a peculiar kind of gum.\r\nThere were sometimes a thousand yards of these bands on a single body.\r\n\r\nAfter they were thus prepared, a soft substance was placed around the\r\nbandaged body. This covering, when it hardened, kept the body in a\r\ncomplete state of preservation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThese coverings are now called mummy-cases, and the bodies they inclose,\r\nmummies.\r\n\r\nThese bodies were finally placed, in huge stone coffins, many of which\r\nwere covered with curious carvings.\r\n\r\nSome of these mummies have been found, that are said to be over three\r\nthousand years old. However, when the wrappings are removed from them,\r\nmany of the bodies have been so well preserved, as to exhibit the\r\nappearance of the features as in life.\r\n\r\nLarge numbers of these mummies have been carried to other countries and\r\nplaced on exhibition in museums.\r\n\r\nAmong the mummies brought to this country, are some of the best\r\nspecimens which have yet been discovered.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDirections for Reading.--Let pupils mark the _inflection_ and point out\r\n_emphatic words_ in the first two paragraphs of the lesson.\r\n\r\nShow positions of the _rhetorical pauses_ in the first paragraph on\r\npage 363.[20]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage Lesson.--Let pupils review, as a written exercise, the\r\nspelling of the following words.\r\n\r\n\r\n    receding     principal     rubbish      punctual\r\n    precipice    council       orphan       microscope\r\n    justice      civilized     threshold    muscles\r\n    precious     merchandise   especially   traveler\r\n    physician    recognize     anecdote     marvelous\r\n    sufficient   apologize     character    benefited\r\n    vicious      poisonous     tremendous   intelligent\r\n\r\n\r\nLet pupils select a subject and make out an _analysis_ for its\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\nEach point in the _analysis_ will require a separate paragraph\r\nfor its treatment.\r\n\r\nBe careful to use capital letters and marks of punctuation correctly.\r\n\r\n\r\n[20] Paragraph beginning, "Remains of these are to be seen to-day...."\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON LXXVII.\r\n\r\n\r\nde vic\'es, _curious marks or shapes_.\r\n\r\nin scrip\'tion, _any thing cut or written on a solid substance_.\r\n\r\ntrans lat\'ing, _expressing in another language_.\r\n\r\nmem\'o ra ble, _worthy of being remembered_.\r\n\r\nspec\'i mens, _small portions of things_.\r\n\r\nin ge nu\'i ty, _skill in inventing_.\r\n\r\ntour\'ists, _travelers; sight-seers_.\r\n\r\nded\'i cat ed, _set apart for a special purpose_.\r\n\r\ncer\'e mo nies, _forms; special customs_.\r\n\r\nsite, _the place where any thing is fixed_.\r\n\r\nmon\'o lith, _a column consisting of a single stone_.\r\n\r\no rig\'i nal ly, _in the first place_.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEGYPT AND ITS RUINS.\r\n\r\nPART II.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe ancient Egyptians erected many obelisks in various parts of their\r\ncountry. These were monuments made from single pieces of hard stone, and\r\nin some cases reached a height of more than a hundred feet.\r\n\r\nThey were placed before gateways leading to the principal temples and\r\npalaces, and were covered with curious carvings in the stone, which\r\nrepresented the language of the people at that time.\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that their written language was not composed of letters\r\nand words alone, like our own; but that they used pictures of animals,\r\nincluding birds, human figures, and other devices of a singular nature,\r\nto express their thoughts and ideas.\r\n\r\nUntil the year 1799, it was impossible for the scholars of modern\r\nnations to read this strange language. In that year, however, a stone\r\ntablet was discovered by a French engineer, containing an inscription\r\nwritten in three languages.\r\n\r\nOne of these was in the characters of the ancient Egyptian and another\r\nin those of the Greek. Upon translating the Greek writing, it was\r\ndiscovered to be a copy of the inscription in the Egyptian language.\r\n\r\nBy comparing the words of these inscriptions with many others, the\r\nformation of this peculiar language was ascertained. It was then learned\r\nthat the inscriptions on these obelisks were the records of memorable\r\nevents, and the heroic deeds of their kings and heroes.\r\n\r\nMany of these obelisks have been taken from their positions in Egypt and\r\ntransported with great labor to other countries. Nearly two thousand\r\nyears ago the Roman emperors began to carry them to the city of Rome.\r\nAltogether, nearly fifty of these remarkable monuments were taken away\r\nand set up in that city. They were then, as now, regarded as curious\r\nexamples of the ingenuity of the ancients who first made them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Obelisk in Central Park, New York, and as it appeared\r\nin Egypt.]\r\n\r\nIn later years, specimens were taken to Paris and London, and more\r\nrecently one was brought to America, and set up in the Central Park, New\r\nYork City.\r\n\r\nThis one belongs to the largest class, being nearly seventy feet high\r\nand about eight feet square at the base.\r\n\r\nThe accompanying cut shows the position of this obelisk as it appeared\r\nwhen standing near the city of Alexandria, Egypt.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of transporting one of these huge stone columns is so\r\ngreat, that for a long time it was thought impossible to remove it from\r\nEgypt to this country.\r\n\r\nIn their large cities, the Egyptians built massive temples which were\r\ndedicated to religious ceremonies. Some of them, although now in ruins,\r\nare considered to be among the most remarkable productions of the\r\nancients.\r\n\r\nTourists who nowadays sail up the River Nile and visit the site of the\r\ncity of Thebes, the ancient capital of Egypt, are struck with amazement\r\nat the vast ruins surrounding them.\r\n\r\nOn the eastern side of the Nile lies what is left of the temple of\r\nKarnak.\r\n\r\nImagine a long line of courts, gateways, and halls; here and there an\r\nobelisk rising above the ruins, and shutting off the view of the forest\r\nof columns!\r\n\r\nThis mass of ruins, some lying in huge heaps of stone, others perfect\r\nand pointed as when they were first built, is approached on every side\r\nby avenues and gateways of colossal grandeur.\r\n\r\nThe temple originally covered an area of two hundred and seventy acres,\r\ninclosed within a wall of brick. Parts of this wall are still visible,\r\nwhile the rest lies crumbled and broken.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to realize the grand appearance of the thirty rows of\r\nstone columns standing within the wall. Some of them that are still\r\nperfect, are capped with enormous monolith capitals, and it is said that\r\none hundred men could stand on one of them without crowding.\r\n\r\nThe hall itself is four hundred and twenty-two feet long by one hundred\r\nand sixty-five feet broad. The stones of the ceiling are supported by\r\none hundred and thirty-four columns, which are still standing, and of\r\nwhich the largest measures ten feet in diameter, and more than\r\nseventy-two feet in height. They are covered with carvings and\r\npaintings whose colors are still bright, even after a lapse of forty\r\ncenturies.\r\n\r\nGazing on what he sees around, the traveler becomes lost in an effort to\r\nform some idea of the grandeur and vastness of the original.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nDirections for Reading.--Let pupils read one or more of the paragraphs\r\nin a whisper, so as to improve _articulation_.\r\n\r\nMark _rhetorical pauses_ in the last paragraph of the lesson.\r\n\r\nName _emphatic words_ in the same paragraph, and state whether the\r\n_rhetorical pauses _occur before or after these words.\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nLanguage Lesson.--Let pupils write _statements_, each containing one\r\nof the following words, used in such a manner as to show its proper\r\nmeaning: _haul, hall; site, sight; piece, peace; our, hour; sum,\r\nsome_.\r\n\r\nRules for the Analysis of a Subject.--Select such points as are\r\nnecessary to make the treatment of the subject complete.\r\n\r\nAdd such points as will increase the interest felt in the subject.\r\n\r\nArrange the points in a natural and easy order.\r\n\r\nNote.--In treating an historical subject, it is necessary to arrange\r\nthe points in the order in which they occurred.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
