School agrees with you."\r\n\r\nTom wished he had looked rather ill.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t think I _am_ well, father," said Tom; "I wish you\'d ask Mr.\r\nStelling not to let me do Euclid--it brings on the toothache, I think."\r\n\r\n(The toothache was the only malady to which Tom had ever been subject.)\r\n\r\n"Euclid, my lad; why, what\'s that?" said Mr. Tulliver.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I don\'t know. It\'s definitions, and axioms, and triangles, and\r\nthings. It\'s a book I\'ve got to learn in; there\'s no sense in it."\r\n\r\n"Go, go!" said Mr. Tulliver, reprovingly, "you mustn\'t say so. You must\r\nlearn what your master tells you. He knows what it\'s right for you to\r\nlearn."\r\n\r\n"_I\'ll_ help you now, Tom," said Maggie, with a little air of\r\npatronizing consolation. "I\'m come to stay ever so long, if Mrs.\r\nStelling asks me. I\'ve brought my box and my pinafores, haven\'t I,\r\nfather?"\r\n\r\n"_You_ help me, you silly little thing!" said Tom, in such high spirits\r\nat this announcement that he quite enjoyed the idea of confounding\r\nMaggie by showing her a page of Euclid. "I should like to see you doing\r\none of _my_ lessons! Why, I learn Latin too! Girls never learn such\r\nthings. They\'re too silly."\r\n\r\n"I know what Latin is very well," said Maggie, confidently. "Latin\'s a\r\nlanguage. There are Latin words in the Dictionary. There\'s \'bonus, a\r\ngift.\'"\r\n\r\n"Now, you\'re just wrong there, Miss Maggie!" said Tom, secretly\r\nastonished. "You think you\'re very wise. But \'bonus\' means \'good,\' as it\r\nhappens--\'bonus, bona, bonum.\'"\r\n\r\n"Well, that\'s no reason why it shouldn\'t mean \'gift,\'" said Maggie,\r\nstoutly. "It may mean several things--almost every word does.\r\nThere\'s \'lawn\'--it means the grass-plot, as well as the stuff\r\npocket-handkerchiefs are made of."\r\n\r\n"Well done, little \'un," said Mr. Tulliver, laughing, while Tom felt\r\nrather disgusted with Maggie\'s knowingness, though beyond measure\r\ncheerful at the thought that she was going to stay with him. Her conceit\r\nwould soon be overawed by the actual inspection of his books.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stelling, in her pressing invitation, did not mention a longer time\r\nthan a week for Maggie\'s stay; but Mr. Stelling, who took her between\r\nhis knees, and asked her where she stole her dark eyes from, insisted\r\nthat she must stay a fortnight. Maggie thought Mr. Stelling was a\r\ncharming man, and Mr. Tulliver was quite proud to leave his little wench\r\nwhere she would have an opportunity of showing her cleverness to\r\nappreciating strangers. So it was agreed that she should not be fetched\r\nhome till the end of the fortnight.\r\n\r\n"Now, then, come with me into the study, Maggie," said Tom, as their\r\nfather drove away. "What do you shake and toss your head now for, you\r\nsilly?" he continued; for, though her hair was now under a new\r\ndispensation, and was brushed smoothly behind her ears, she seemed still\r\nin imagination to be tossing it out of her eyes. "It makes you look as\r\nif you were crazy."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I can\'t help it," said Maggie, impatiently. "Don\'t tease me, Tom.\r\nOh, what books!" she exclaimed, as she saw the book-cases in the study.\r\n"How I should like to have as many books as that!"\r\n\r\n"Why, you couldn\'t read one of \'em," said Tom, triumphantly. "They\'re\r\nall Latin."\r\n\r\n"No, they aren\'t," said Maggie. "I can read the back of this ...\r\n\'History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire.\'"\r\n\r\n"Well, what does that mean? _You_ don\'t know," said Tom, wagging his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\n"But I could soon find out," said Maggie, scornfully.\r\n\r\n"Why, how?"\r\n\r\n"I should look inside, and see what it was about."\r\n\r\n"You\'d better not, Miss Maggie," said Tom, seeing her hand on the\r\nvolume. "Mr. Stelling lets nobody touch his books without leave, and I\r\nshall catch it if you take it out."\r\n\r\n"Oh, very well! Let me see all _your_ books, then," said Maggie, turning\r\nto throw her arms round Tom\'s neck, and rub his cheek with her small,\r\nround nose.\r\n\r\nTom, in the gladness of his heart at having dear old Maggie to dispute\r\nwith and crow over again, seized her round the waist, and began to jump\r\nwith her round the large library table. Away they jumped with more and\r\nmore vigour, till Maggie\'s hair flew from behind her ears, and twirled\r\nabout like an animated mop. But the revolutions round the table became\r\nmore and more irregular in their sweep, till at last reaching Mr.\r\nStelling\'s reading-stand, they sent it thundering down with its heavy\r\nlexicons to the floor. Happily it was the ground-floor, and the study\r\nwas a one-storied wing to the house, so that the downfall made no\r\nalarming resonance, though Tom stood dizzy and aghast for a few minutes,\r\ndreading the appearance of Mr. or Mrs. Stelling.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I say, Maggie," said Tom at last, lifting up the stand, "we must\r\nkeep quiet here, you know. If we break anything, Mrs. Stelling\'ll make\r\nus cry peccavi."\r\n\r\n"What\'s that?" said Maggie.\r\n\r\n"Oh, it\'s the Latin for a good scolding," said Tom, not without some\r\npride in his knowledge.\r\n\r\n"Is she a cross woman?" said Maggie.\r\n\r\n"I believe you!" said Tom, with an emphatic nod.\r\n\r\n"I think all women are crosser than men," said Maggie. "Aunt Glegg\'s a\r\ngreat deal crosser than Uncle Glegg, and mother scolds me more than\r\nfather does."\r\n\r\n"Well, _you\'ll_ be a woman some day," said Tom, "so _you_ needn\'t\r\ntalk."\r\n\r\n"But I shall be a _clever_ woman," said Maggie, with a toss.\r\n\r\n"Oh, I daresay, and a nasty, conceited thing. Everybody\'ll hate you."\r\n\r\n"But you oughtn\'t to hate me, Tom. It\'ll be very wicked of you, for I\r\nshall be your sister."\r\n\r\n"Yes, but if you\'re a nasty, disagreeable thing, I _shall_ hate you."\r\n\r\n"Oh but, Tom, you won\'t! I shan\'t be disagreeable. I shall be very good\r\nto you, and I shall be good to everybody. You won\'t hate me really, will\r\nyou, Tom?"\r\n\r\n"Oh, bother, never mind! Come, it\'s time for me to learn my lessons. See\r\nhere, what I\'ve got to do," said Tom, drawing Maggie towards him and\r\nshowing her his theorem, while she pushed her hair behind her ears, and\r\nprepared herself to prove her capability of helping him in Euclid. She\r\nbegan to read with full confidence in her own powers; but presently,\r\nbecoming quite bewildered, her face flushed with irritation. It was\r\nunavoidable: she must confess her incompetency, and she was not fond of\r\nhumiliation.\r\n\r\n"It\'s nonsense!" she said, "and very ugly stuff; nobody need want to\r\nmake it out."\r\n\r\n"Ah, there now, Miss Maggie!" said Tom, drawing the book away and\r\nwagging his head at her; "you see you\'re not so clever as you thought\r\nyou were."\r\n\r\n"Oh," said Maggie, pouting, "I daresay I could make it out if I\'d\r\nlearned what goes before, as you have."\r\n\r\n"But that\'s what you just couldn\'t, Miss Wisdom," said Tom. "For it\'s\r\nall the harder when you know what goes before; for then you\'ve got to\r\nsay what definition 3 is, and what axiom V is. But get along with you\r\nnow; I must go on with this. Here\'s the Latin Grammar. See what you can\r\nmake of that."\r\n\r\nMaggie found the Latin Grammar quite soothing after her mathematical\r\nmortification, for she delighted in new words, and quickly found that\r\nthere was an English Key at the end, which would make her very wise\r\nabout Latin, at slight expense. It was really very interesting--the\r\nLatin Grammar that Tom had said no girls could learn, and she was proud\r\nbecause she found it interesting.\r\n\r\n"Now, then, Magsie, give us the Grammar!"\r\n\r\n"Oh, Tom, it\'s such a pretty book!" she said, as she jumped out of the\r\nlarge arm-chair to give it him; "it\'s much prettier than the Dictionary.\r\nI could learn Latin very soon. I don\'t think it\'s at all hard."\r\n\r\n"Oh, I know what you\'ve been doing," said Tom; "you\'ve been reading the\r\nEnglish at the end. Any donkey can do that."\r\n\r\nTom seized the book and opened it with a determined and business-like\r\nair, as much as to say that he had a lesson to learn which no donkeys\r\nwould find themselves equal to. Maggie, rather piqued, turned to the\r\nbook-cases to amuse herself with puzzling out the titles.\r\n\r\nGeorge Eliot: "The Mill on the Floss."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINGRATITUDE\r\n\r\n\r\n    Blow, blow, thou winter wind,\r\n    Thou art not so unkind\r\n      As man\'s ingratitude;\r\n    Thy tooth is not so keen\r\n    Because thou art not seen,\r\n      Although thy breath be rude.\r\n\r\n    Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,\r\n    Thou dost not bite so nigh\r\n      As benefits forgot;\r\n    Though thou the waters warp,\r\n    Thy sting is not so sharp\r\n      As friend remembered not.\r\n\r\nShakespeare\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: H.

But, in a voyage of such expectation and importance, every\r\ncircumstance was the object of attention.\r\n\r\nAs they proceeded, the indications of approaching land seemed to be more\r\ncertain, and excited hope in proportion. The birds began to appear in\r\nflocks, making towards the south-west. Columbus, in imitation of the\r\nPortuguese navigators, who had been guided in several of their\r\ndiscoveries by the motion of birds, altered his course from due west\r\ntowards that quarter whither they pointed their flight. But, after\r\nholding on for several days in this new direction, without any better\r\nsuccess than formerly, having seen no object during thirty days but the\r\nsea and the sky, the hopes of his companions subsided faster than they\r\nhad risen; their fears revived with additional force; impatience, rage,\r\nand despair appeared in every countenance. All sense of subordination\r\nwas lost. The officers, who had hitherto concurred with Columbus in\r\nopinion, and supported his authority, now took part with the private\r\nmen; they assembled tumultuously on the deck, expostulated with their\r\ncommander, mingled threats with their expostulations, and required him\r\ninstantly to tack about and return to Europe. Columbus perceived that it\r\nwould be of no avail to have recourse to any of his former arts, which,\r\nhaving been tried so often, had lost their effect; and that it was\r\nimpossible to rekindle any zeal for the success of the expedition among\r\nmen in whose breasts fear had extinguished every generous sentiment. He\r\nsaw that it was no less vain to think of employing either gentle or\r\nsevere measures to quell a mutiny so general and so violent. It was\r\nnecessary, on all these accounts, to soothe passions which he could no\r\nlonger command, and to give way to a torrent too impetuous to be\r\nchecked. He promised solemnly to his men that he would comply with\r\ntheir request, provided they would accompany him and obey his command\r\nfor three days longer, and if, during that time, land were not\r\ndiscovered, he would then abandon the enterprise, and direct his course\r\ntowards Spain.\r\n\r\nEnraged as the sailors were, and impatient to turn their faces again\r\ntowards their native country, this proposition did not appear to them\r\nunreasonable; nor did Columbus hazard much in confining himself to a\r\nterm so short. The presages of discovering land were now so numerous and\r\npromising that he deemed them infallible. For some days the\r\nsounding-line reached the bottom, and the soil which it brought up\r\nindicated land to be at no great distance. The flocks of birds\r\nincreased, and were composed not only of sea-fowl, but of such\r\nland-birds as could not be supposed to fly far from the shore. The crew\r\nof the Pinta observed a cane floating, which seemed to have been newly\r\ncut, and likewise a piece of timber artificially carved. The sailors\r\naboard the Nigna took up the branch of a tree with red berries perfectly\r\nfresh. The clouds around the setting sun assumed a new appearance; the\r\nair was more mild and warm, and during night the wind became unequal\r\nand variable. From all these symptoms, Columbus was so confident of\r\nbeing near land, that on the evening of the eleventh of October, after\r\npublic prayers for success, he ordered the sails to be furled, and the\r\nships to lie to, keeping strict watch lest they should be driven ashore\r\nin the night. During this interval of suspense and expectation, no man\r\nshut his eyes, all kept upon deck, gazing towards that quarter where\r\nthey expected to discover the land, which had so long been the object of\r\ntheir wishes.\r\n\r\nAbout two hours before midnight, Columbus, standing on the forecastle,\r\nobserved a light in the distance, and privately pointed it out to Pedro\r\nGuttierez, a page of the Queen\'s wardrobe. Guttierez perceived it, and\r\ncalling to Salcedo, comptroller of the fleet, all three saw it in\r\nmotion, as if it were carried from place to place. A little after\r\nmidnight, the joyful sound of "Land! Land!" was heard from the Pinta,\r\nwhich kept always ahead of the other ships. But, having been so often\r\ndeceived by fallacious appearances, every man was now become slow of\r\nbelief, and waited in all the anguish of uncertainty and impatience for\r\nthe return of day. As soon as morning dawned, all doubts and fears were\r\ndispelled. From every ship an island was seen about two leagues to the\r\nnorth, whose flat and verdant fields, well stored with wood, and watered\r\nwith many rivulets, presented the aspect of a delightful country.\r\n\r\nThe crew of the Pinta instantly began the _Te Deum_, as a hymn of\r\nthanksgiving to God, and were joined by those of the other ships with\r\ntears of joy and transports of congratulation. This office of gratitude\r\nto Heaven was followed by an act of justice to their commander. They\r\nthrew themselves at the feet of Columbus, with feelings of\r\nself-condemnation, mingled with reverence. They implored him to pardon\r\ntheir ignorance, incredulity, and insolence, which had created him so\r\nmuch unnecessary disquiet, and had so often obstructed the prosecution\r\nof his well-concerted plan; and passing, in the warmth of their\r\nadmiration, from one extreme to the other, they now pronounced the man\r\nwhom they had so lately reviled and threatened, to be a person inspired\r\nby Heaven with sagacity and fortitude more than human, in order to\r\naccomplish a design so far beyond the ideas and conceptions of all\r\nformer ages.\r\n\r\nWilliam Robertson: "The History of America."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST SPRING DAY\r\n\r\n\r\n    I wonder if the sap is stirring yet,\r\n    If wintry birds are dreaming of a mate,\r\n    If frozen snowdrops feel as yet the sun,\r\n    And crocus fires are kindled one by one:\r\n          Sing, robin, sing!\r\n    I still am sore in doubt concerning Spring.\r\n\r\n    I wonder if the spring-tide of this year\r\n    Will bring another spring both lost and dear;\r\n    If heart and spirit will find out their spring,\r\n    Or if the world alone will bud and sing:\r\n          Sing, hope, to me!\r\n    Sweet notes, my hope, sweet notes for memory.\r\n\r\n    The sap will surely quicken soon or late,\r\n    The tardiest bird will twitter to a mate;\r\n    So Spring must dawn again with warmth and bloom,\r\n    Or in this world, or in the world to come:\r\n          Sing, voice of Spring!\r\n    Till I, too, blossom and rejoice and sing.\r\n\r\nChristina Rossetti\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBe that which you would make others.\r\n\r\nAmiel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BATTLE OF THE PIPES\r\n\r\n\r\nA thing happened worth narrating at the close of a visit paid me by\r\nRobin Oig, one of the sons of the notorious Rob Roy. As he was leaving,\r\njust in the door, he met Alan coming in; and the two drew back and\r\nlooked at each other like strange dogs. They were neither of them big\r\nmen, but they seemed fairly to swell out with pride. Each wore a sword,\r\nand by a movement of his haunch, thrust clear the hilt of it, so that it\r\nmight be the more readily grasped and the blade drawn.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Stewart, I am thinking," says Robin.\r\n\r\n"Troth, Mr. Macgregor, it\'s not a name to be ashamed of," answered Alan.\r\n\r\n"I did not know ye were in my country, sir," says Robin.\r\n\r\n"It sticks in my mind that I am in the country of my friends, the\r\nMaclarens," says Alan.\r\n\r\n"That\'s a kittle point," returned the other. "There may be two words to\r\nsay to that. But I think I will have heard that you are a man of your\r\nsword?"\r\n\r\n"Unless ye were born deaf, Mr. Macgregor, ye will have heard a good\r\ndeal more than that," says Alan. "I am not the only man who can draw\r\nsteel in Appin; and when my kinsman and captain, Ardshiel, had a talk\r\nwith a gentleman of your name, not so many years back, I could never\r\nhear that the Macgregor had the best of it."\r\n\r\n"Do you mean my father, sir?" says Robin.\r\n\r\n"Well, I wouldnae wonder," says Alan. "The gentleman I have in my mind\r\nhad the ill-taste to clap Campbell to his name."\r\n\r\n"My father was an old man," returned Robin. "The match was unequal. You\r\nand me would make a better pair, sir."\r\n\r\n"I was thinking that," said Alan.\r\n\r\nI was half out of bed, and Duncan had been hanging at the elbow of these\r\nfighting cocks, ready to intervene upon the least occasion. But when\r\nthat word was uttered, it was a case of now or never; and Duncan, with\r\nsomething of a white face to be sure, thrust himself between.\r\n\r\n"Gentlemen," said he, "I will have been thinking of a very different\r\nmatter. Here are my pipes, and here are you two gentlemen who are baith\r\nacclaimed pipers. It\'s an auld dispute which one of ye\'s the best. Here\r\nwill be a braw chance to settle it."\r\n\r\n"Why, sir," said Alan, still addressing Robin, from whom indeed he had\r\nnot so much as shifted his eyes, nor yet Robin from him, "why, sir,"\r\nsays Alan, "I think I will have heard some sough of the sort. Have ye\r\nmusic, as folk say? Are ye a bit of a piper?"\r\n\r\n"I can pipe like a Maccrimmon!" cries Robin.\r\n\r\n"And that is a very bold word," quoth Alan.\r\n\r\n"I have made bolder words good before now," returned Robin, "and that\r\nagainst better adversaries."\r\n\r\n"It is easy to try that," says Alan.\r\n\r\nDuncan Dhu made haste to bring out the pair of pipes that was his\r\nprincipal possession, and to set before his guests a muttonham and a\r\nbottle of that drink which they call Athole brose. The two enemies were\r\nstill on the very breach of a quarrel; but down they sat, one upon each\r\nside of the peat fire, with a mighty show of politeness. Maclaren\r\npressed them to taste his muttonham and "the wife\'s brose," reminding\r\nthem the wife was out of Athole and had a name far and wide for her\r\nskill in that confection. But Robin put aside these hospitalities as bad\r\nfor the breath.\r\n\r\n"I would have ye to remark, sir," said Alan, "that I havenae broken\r\nbread for near upon ten hours, which will be worse for the breath than\r\nany brose in Scotland."\r\n\r\n"I will take no advantages, Mr. Stewart," replied Robin. "Eat and drink;\r\nI\'ll follow."\r\n\r\nEach ate a small portion of the ham and drank a glass of the brose to\r\nMrs. Maclaren; and then, after a great number of civilities, Robin took\r\nthe pipes and played a little spring in a very ranting manner.\r\n\r\n"Ay, ye can blow," said Alan; and, taking the instrument from his rival,\r\nhe first played the same spring in a manner identical with Robin\'s; and\r\nthen wandered into variations, which, as he went on, he decorated with a\r\nperfect flight of grace-notes, such as pipers love, and call the\r\n"warblers."\r\n\r\nI had been pleased with Robin\'s playing, Alan\'s ravished me.\r\n\r\n"That\'s no very bad, Mr. Stewart," said the rival, "but ye show a poor\r\ndevice in your warbler."\r\n\r\n"Me!" cried Alan, the blood starting to his face. "I give ye the lie."\r\n\r\n"Do ye own yourself beaten at the pipes, then," said Robin, "that ye\r\nseek to change them for the sword?"\r\n\r\n"And that\'s very well said, Mr. Macgregor," returned Alan; "and in the\r\nmeantime" (laying a strong accent on the word) "I take back the lie. I\r\nappeal to Duncan."\r\n\r\n"Indeed, ye need appeal to naebody," said Robin. "Ye\'re a far better\r\njudge than any Maclaren in Balwhidder: for it\'s a God\'s truth that\r\nyou\'re a very creditable piper for a Stewart. Hand me the pipes."\r\n\r\nAlan did as he asked; and Robin proceeded to imitate and correct some\r\npart of Alan\'s variations, which it seemed that he remembered perfectly.\r\n\r\n"Ay, ye have music," said Alan, gloomily.\r\n\r\n"And now be the judge yourself, Mr. Stewart," said Robin; and taking up\r\nthe variations from the beginning, he worked them throughout to so new a\r\npurpose, with such ingenuity and sentiment, and with so odd a fancy and\r\nso quick a knack in the grace-notes, that I was amazed to hear him.\r\n\r\nAs for Alan his face grew dark and hot, and he sat and gnawed his\r\nfingers, like a man under some deep affront. "Enough!" he cried. "Ye can\r\nblow the pipes--make the most of that." And he made as if to rise.\r\n\r\nBut Robin only held out his hand as if to ask for silence, and struck\r\ninto the slow music of a pibroch. It was a fine piece of music in\r\nitself, and nobly played; but, it seems besides, it was a piece peculiar\r\nto the Appin Stewarts and a chief favourite with Alan. The first notes\r\nwere scarce out, before there came a change in his face; when the time\r\nquickened, he seemed to grow restless in his seat; and long before that\r\npiece was at an end, the last signs of his anger died from him, and he\r\nhad no thought but for the music.\r\n\r\n"Robin Oig," he said, when it was done, "ye are a great piper. I am not\r\nfit to blow in the same kingdom with ye. Body of me! ye have more music\r\nin your sporran than I have in my head! And, though it still sticks in\r\nmy mind that I could show ye another of it with the cold steel, I warn\r\nye beforehand--it\'ll no be fair! It would go against my heart to haggle\r\na man that can blow the pipes as you can!"\r\n\r\nThereupon the quarrel was made up. All night long the pipes were\r\nchanging hands, and the day had come pretty bright before Robin as much\r\nas thought upon the road.\r\n\r\nRobert Louis Stevenson: "Kidnapped."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBEGA\r\n\r\n\r\n    From the clouded belfry calling\r\n    Hear my soft ascending swells,\r\n    Hear my notes like swallows falling:\r\n    I am Bega, least of bells.\r\n    When great Turkeful rolls and rings\r\n    All the storm-touched turret swings,\r\n    Echoing battle, loud and long.\r\n    When great Tatwin wakening roars\r\n    To the far-off shining shores,\r\n    All the seamen know his song.\r\n    I am Bega, least of bells;\r\n    In my throat my message swells.\r\n    I, with all the winds athrill,\r\n    Murmuring softly, murmuring still,\r\n      "God around me, God above me,\r\n      God to guard me, God to love me."\r\n\r\n    I am Bega, least of bells;\r\n    Weaving wonder, wind-born spells.\r\n    High above the morning mist,\r\n    Wreathed in rose and amethyst,\r\n    Still the dreams of music float\r\n    Silver from my silver throat,\r\n    Whispering beauty, whispering peace.\r\n    When great Tatwin\'s golden voice\r\n    Bids the listening land rejoice,\r\n    When great Turkeful rings and rolls\r\n    Thunder down to trembling souls,\r\n    Then my notes, like curlews flying,\r\n    Sinking, falling, lifting, sighing,\r\n    Softly answer, softly cease.\r\n    I, with all the airs at play,\r\n    Murmuring softly, murmuring say,\r\n      "God around me, God above me,\r\n      God to guard me, God to love me."\r\n\r\nMarjorie L.

Within two hours before daybreak thirty boats,\r\ncrowded with sixteen hundred soldiers, cast off from the vessels and\r\nfloated downward in perfect order with the current of the ebb-tide. To\r\nthe boundless joy of the army, Wolfe\'s malady had abated, and he was\r\nable to command in person. His ruined health, the gloomy prospect of the\r\nsiege, and the disaster at Montmorenci, had oppressed him with the\r\ndeepest melancholy, but never impaired for a moment the promptness of\r\nhis decisions, or the impetuous energy of his action.\r\n\r\nHe sat in the stern of one of the boats, pale and weak, but borne up to\r\na calm height of resolution. Every order had been given, every\r\narrangement made, and it only remained to face the issue. The ebbing\r\ntide sufficed to bear the boats along, and nothing broke the silence of\r\nthe night but the gurgling of the river, and the low voice of Wolfe, as\r\nhe repeated to the officers about him the stanzas of Gray\'s "Elegy in a\r\nCountry Churchyard," which had recently appeared, and which he had just\r\nreceived from England. Perhaps as he uttered those strangely\r\nappropriate words:--\r\n\r\n"The paths of glory lead but to the grave," the shadows of his own\r\napproaching fate stole with mournful prophecy across his mind.\r\n"Gentlemen," he said, as he closed his recital, "I would rather have\r\nwritten those lines than take Quebec to-morrow."\r\n\r\nAs they approached the landing-place, the boats edged closer in towards\r\nthe northern shore, and the woody precipices rose high on their left\r\nlike a wall of undistinguished blackness.\r\n\r\n"_Qui vive?_" shouted a French sentinel from out the impervious gloom.\r\n\r\n"_La France!_" answered a captain of Fraser\'s Highlanders from the\r\nforemost boat.\r\n\r\nAs boats were frequently passing down the river with supplies for the\r\ngarrison, and as a convoy from Bougainville was expected that very\r\nnight, the sentinel was deceived and allowed the English to proceed. A\r\nfew moments later, they were challenged again, and this time they could\r\ndiscern the soldier running close down to the water\'s edge, as if all\r\nhis suspicions were aroused; but the skilful replies of the Highlander\r\nonce more saved the party from discovery.\r\n\r\nThey reached the landing-place in safety,--an indentation in the shore\r\nabout a league above the city and now bearing the name of Wolfe\'s Cove.\r\nHere a narrow path led up the face of the heights, and a French guard\r\nwas posted at the top to defend the pass. By the force of the current\r\nthe foremost boats, including that which carried Wolfe himself, were\r\nborne a little below the spot. The general was one of the first on\r\nshore. He looked upward at the rugged heights which towered above him in\r\nthe gloom. "You can try it," he coolly observed to an officer near him;\r\n"but I don\'t think you\'ll get up."\r\n\r\nAt the point where the Highlanders landed, one of their captains, Donald\r\nMacdonald, apparently the same whose presence of mind had just saved the\r\nenterprise from ruin, was climbing in advance of his men, when he was\r\nchallenged by a sentinel. He replied in French, by declaring that he had\r\nbeen sent to relieve the guard, and ordering the soldier to withdraw.\r\nBefore the latter was undeceived, a crowd of Highlanders were close at\r\nhand, while the steeps below were thronged with eager climbers, dragging\r\nthemselves up by trees, roots, and bushes. The guard turned out and made\r\na brief though brave resistance. In a moment they were cut to pieces,\r\ndispersed, or made prisoners, while men after men came swarming up the\r\nheight and quickly formed upon the plains above. Meanwhile the vessels\r\nhad dropped downward with the current and anchored opposite the\r\nlanding-place. The remaining troops disembarked, and with the dawn of\r\nday, the whole were brought in safety to the shore.\r\n\r\nThe sun rose, and from the ramparts of Quebec the astonished people saw\r\nthe Plains of Abraham glittering with arms, and the dark-red lines of\r\nthe English forming in array of battle. Breathless messengers had borne\r\nthe evil tidings to Montcalm, and far and near his wide-extended camp\r\nresounded with the rolling of alarm-drums and the din of startled\r\npreparation. He, too, had had his struggles and his sorrows. The civil\r\npower had thwarted him; famine, discontent, and disaffection were rife\r\namong his soldiers; and no small portion of the Canadian militia had\r\ndispersed from sheer starvation. In spite of all, he had trusted to hold\r\nout till the winter frosts should drive the invaders from before the\r\ntown, when on that disastrous morning the news of their successful\r\ntemerity fell like a cannon-shot upon his ear. Still he assumed a tone\r\nof confidence. "They have got to the weak side of us at last," he is\r\nreported to have said, "and we must crush them with our numbers." With\r\nheadlong haste his troops were pouring over the bridge of St. Charles,\r\nand gathering in heavy masses under the western ramparts of the town.\r\nCould numbers give assurance of success, their triumph would have been\r\nsecure, for five French battalions and the armed colonial peasantry\r\namounted in all to more than seven thousand five hundred men. Full in\r\nsight before stretched the long, thin lines of the British forces--the\r\nHighlanders, the steady soldiery of England, and the hardy levies of the\r\nprovinces--less than five thousand in number, but all inured to battle,\r\nand strong in the full assurance of success.\r\n\r\nIt was nine o\'clock, and the adverse armies stood motionless, each\r\ngazing on the other. The clouds hung low, and at intervals warm light\r\nshowers descended besprinkling both alike. The coppice and corn-fields\r\nin front of the British troops were filled with French sharp-shooters,\r\nwho kept up a distant spattering fire. Here and there a soldier fell in\r\nthe ranks, and the gap was filled in silence.\r\n\r\nAt a little before ten the British could see that Montcalm was preparing\r\nto advance, and in a few moments all his troops appeared in rapid\r\nmotion. They came on in three divisions, shouting after the manner of\r\ntheir nation, and firing heavily as soon as they came within range. In\r\nthe British ranks not a trigger was pulled, not a soldier stirred, and\r\ntheir ominous composure seemed to damp the spirits of the assailants. It\r\nwas not till the French were within forty yards that the fatal word was\r\ngiven, and the British muskets blazed forth at once in one crashing\r\nexplosion. Like a ship at full career arrested with sudden ruin on a\r\nsunken rock, the ranks of Montcalm staggered, shivered, and broke before\r\nthat wasting storm of lead. The smoke rolling along the field for a\r\nmoment shut out the view, but, when the white wreaths were scattered on\r\nthe wind, a wretched spectacle was disclosed: men and officers tumbled\r\nin heaps, battalions resolved into a mob, order and obedience gone; and,\r\nwhen the British muskets were levelled for a second volley, the masses\r\nof the militia were seen to cower and shrink with uncontrollable panic.\r\nFor a few minutes the French regulars stood their ground, returning a\r\nsharp and not ineffectual fire. But now, echoing cheer on cheer,\r\nredoubling volley on volley, trampling the dying and the dead, and\r\ndriving the fugitives in crowds, the British troops advanced and swept\r\nthe field before them. The ardour of the men burst all restraint. They\r\nbroke into a run and with unsparing slaughter chased the flying\r\nmultitude to the gates of Quebec. Foremost of all, the light-footed\r\nHighlanders dashed along in furious pursuit, hewing down the Frenchmen\r\nwith their broadswords and slaying many in the very ditch of the\r\nfortifications. Never was victory more quick or more decisive.\r\n\r\nIn the short action and pursuit the French lost fifteen hundred men,\r\nkilled, wounded, and taken. Of the remainder some escaped within the\r\ncity, and others fled across the St. Charles to rejoin their comrades\r\nwho had been left to guard the camp. The pursuers were recalled by sound\r\nof trumpet, the broken ranks were formed afresh, and the English troops\r\nwithdrawn beyond reach of the cannon of Quebec. Townshend and Murray,\r\nthe only general officers who remained unhurt, passed to the head of\r\nevery regiment in turn and thanked the soldiers for the bravery they had\r\nshown; yet the triumph of the victors was mingled with sadness as\r\ntidings went from rank to rank that Wolfe had fallen.\r\n\r\nIn the heat of the action, as he advanced at the head of the grenadiers\r\nof Louisburg, a bullet shattered his wrist, but he wrapped his\r\nhandkerchief about the wound, and showed no sign of pain. A moment more\r\nand a ball pierced his side. Still he pressed forward waving his sword\r\nand cheering his soldiers to the attack, when a third shot lodged deep\r\nwithin his breast. He paused, reeled, and staggering to one side, fell\r\nto earth. Brown, a lieutenant of the grenadiers, Henderson, a volunteer,\r\nan officer of artillery, and a private soldier, raised him together in\r\ntheir arms, and bearing him to the rear laid him softly on the grass.\r\nThey asked if he would have a surgeon, but he shook his head and\r\nanswered that all was over with him. His eyes closed with the torpor of\r\napproaching death, and those around sustained his fainting form. Yet\r\nthey could not withhold their gaze from the wild turmoil before them,\r\nand the charging ranks of their companions rushing through fire and\r\nsmoke. "See how they run," one of the officers exclaimed, as the French\r\nfell in confusion before the levelled bayonets. "Who run?" demanded\r\nWolfe, opening his eyes like a man aroused from sleep. "The enemy, sir,"\r\nwas the reply; "they give way everywhere." "Then," said the dying\r\ngeneral, "tell Colonel Burton to march Webb\'s regiment down to Charles\r\nRiver, to cut off their retreat from the bridge. Now, God be praised, I\r\nshall die in peace," he murmured; and turning on his side he calmly\r\nbreathed his last.\r\n\r\nAlmost at the same moment fell his great adversary, Montcalm, as he\r\nstrove with vain bravery to rally his shattered ranks. Struck down with\r\na mortal wound, he was placed upon a litter and borne to the General\r\nHospital on the banks of the St. Charles. The surgeons told him that he\r\ncould not recover. "I am glad of it," was his calm reply. He then asked\r\nhow long he might survive, and was told that he had not many hours\r\nremaining. "So much the better," he said; "I am happy that I shall not\r\nlive to see the surrender of Quebec." Officers from the garrison came to\r\nhis bedside to ask his orders and instructions. "I will give no more\r\norders," replied the defeated soldier; "I have much business that must\r\nbe attended to, of greater moment than your ruined garrison and this\r\nwretched country. My time is very short, therefore, pray leave me."\r\n\r\nThe victorious army encamped before Quebec and pushed their\r\npreparations for the siege with zealous energy, but, before a single gun\r\nwas brought to bear, the white flag was hung out, and the garrison\r\nsurrendered. On the eighteenth of September, 1759, the rock-built\r\ncitadel of Canada passed for ever from the hands of its ancient masters.\r\n\r\nParkman: "The Conspiracy of Pontiac."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCANADA\r\n\r\n\r\n    Montcalm and Wolfe!

Never has any people been endowed with a nobler\r\nbirthright or blessed with prospects of a fairer future.\r\n\r\nLord Dufferin\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSCROOGE\'S CHRISTMAS\r\n\r\n(On Christmas Eve, Scrooge, "a squeezing, wrenching, grasping, scraping,\r\nclutching, covetous old sinner," is visited by three ghosts in\r\nsuccession--The Ghost of Christmas Past, the Ghost of Christmas Present,\r\nand the Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come. The first recalled the\r\nexperiences of Scrooge\'s youth, the second showed him Christmas as it\r\nmight be spent and incidentally, too, what some people thought of him.\r\nThe third showed him the "shadows of the things that have not happened,\r\nbut will happen in the time before us." He saw himself dead, uncared\r\nfor, unwept, unwatched, his effects plundered by the charwoman,\r\nlaundress, and undertaker\'s man and realized the end to which he must\r\ncome unless he led an altered life. Holding up his hands he prayed to\r\nhave his fate reversed and saw the Ghost shrink and dwindle down into a\r\nbedpost.)\r\n\r\n\r\nYes! and the bedpost was his own. The bed was his own, the room was his\r\nown. Best and happiest of all, the Time before him was his own to make\r\namends in.\r\n\r\n"I will live in the Past, the Present, and the Future!" Scrooge\r\nrepeated, as he scrambled out of bed. "The Spirits of all Three shall\r\nstrive within me. O Jacob Marley! Heaven and the Christmas Time be\r\npraised for this! I say it on my knees, old Jacob; on my knees!"\r\n\r\nHe was so fluttered and so glowing with his good intentions, that his\r\nbroken voice could scarcely answer to his call. He had been sobbing\r\nviolently in his conflict with the Spirit, and his face was wet with\r\ntears.\r\n\r\n"They are not torn down," cried Scrooge, folding one of his bed\r\ncurtains in his arms,--"they are not torn down, rings and all. They are\r\nhere,--I am here,--the shadows of the things that would have been may be\r\ndispelled. They will be. I know they will!"\r\n\r\nHis hands were busy with his garments all this time; turning them inside\r\nout, putting them on upside down, tearing them, mislaying them, making\r\nthem parties to every kind of extravagance.\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what to do!" cried Scrooge, laughing and crying in the\r\nsame breath; and making a perfect Laocoon of himself with his stockings.\r\n"I am as light as a feather, I am as happy as an angel, I am as merry as\r\na school-boy. I am as giddy as a drunken man. A Merry Christmas to\r\neverybody! A Happy New Year to all the world! Hallo here! Whoop! Hallo!"\r\n\r\nHe had frisked into the sitting-room, and was now standing there,\r\nperfectly winded.\r\n\r\n"There\'s the sauce-pan that the gruel was in!" cried Scrooge, starting\r\noff again, and going round the fireplace. "There\'s the door by which the\r\nGhost of Jacob Marley entered! There\'s the corner where the Ghost of\r\nChristmas Present sat! There\'s the window where I saw the wandering\r\nSpirits! It\'s all right, it\'s all true, it all happened. Ha, ha, ha!"\r\n\r\nReally, for a man who had been out of practice for so many years, it was\r\na splendid laugh, a most illustrious laugh. The father of a long, long\r\nline of brilliant laughs!\r\n\r\n"I don\'t know what day of the month it is," said Scrooge. "I don\'t know\r\nhow long I have been amongst the Spirits. I don\'t know anything. I\'m\r\nquite a baby. Never mind. I don\'t care. I\'d rather be a baby. Hallo!\r\nWhoop! Hallo here!"\r\n\r\nHe was checked in his transports by the churches ringing out the\r\nlustiest peals he had ever heard. Clang, clash, hammer; ding, dong,\r\nbell. Bell, dong, ding; hammer, clang, clash! O, glorious, glorious!\r\n\r\nRunning to the window, he opened it, and put out his head. No fog, no\r\nmist; clear, bright, jovial, stirring cold; cold, piping for the blood\r\nto dance to; golden sunlight; heavenly sky; sweet fresh air; merry\r\nbells. O, glorious, glorious!\r\n\r\n"What\'s to-day?" cried Scrooge, calling downward to a boy in Sunday\r\nclothes, who perhaps had loitered in to look about him.\r\n\r\n"Eh?" returned the boy, with all his might of wonder.\r\n\r\n"What\'s to-day, my fine fellow?" said Scrooge.\r\n\r\n"To-day!" replied the boy. "Why, CHRISTMAS DAY."\r\n\r\n"It\'s Christmas Day!" said Scrooge to himself. "I haven\'t missed it. The\r\nSpirits have done it all in one night. They can do anything they like.\r\nOf course they can. Of course they can. Hallo, my fine fellow?"\r\n\r\n"Hallo!" returned the boy.\r\n\r\n"Do you know the Poulterer\'s, in the next street but one, at the\r\ncorner?" Scrooge inquired.\r\n\r\n"I should hope I did," replied the lad.\r\n\r\n"An intelligent boy!" said Scrooge. "A remarkable boy! Do you know\r\nwhether they\'ve sold the prize turkey that was hanging up there?--Not\r\nthe little prize turkey, the big one?"\r\n\r\n"What, the one as big as me?" said the boy.\r\n\r\n"What a delightful boy!" said Scrooge. "It\'s a pleasure to talk to him.\r\nYes, my buck!"\r\n\r\n"It\'s hanging there now," replied the boy.\r\n\r\n"Is it?" said Scrooge. "Go and buy it."\r\n\r\n"WALK-ER!" exclaimed the boy.\r\n\r\n"No, no," said Scrooge, "I am in earnest. Go and buy it and tell \'em to\r\nbring it here, that I may give them the direction where to take it. Come\r\nback with the man, and I\'ll give you a shilling. Come back with him in\r\nless than five minutes, and I\'ll give you half-a-crown!"\r\n\r\nThe boy was off like a shot. He must have had a steady hand at the\r\ntrigger who could have got a shot off half so fast.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll send it to Bob Cratchit\'s," whispered Scrooge, rubbing his hands,\r\nand splitting with a laugh. "He shan\'t know who sends it. It\'s twice the\r\nsize of Tiny Tim. Joe Miller never made such a joke as sending it to\r\nBob\'s will be!"\r\n\r\nThe hand in which he wrote the address was not a steady one, but write\r\nhe did, somehow, and went down-stairs to open the street door, ready for\r\nthe coming of the Poulterer\'s man. As he stood there, waiting his\r\narrival, the knocker caught his eye.\r\n\r\n"I shall love it as long as I live!" cried Scrooge, patting it with his\r\nhand. "I scarcely ever looked at it before. What an honest expression it\r\nhas in its face! It\'s a wonderful knocker!--Here\'s the turkey. Hallo!\r\nWhoop! How are you? Merry Christmas!"\r\n\r\nIt _was_ a turkey! He could never have stood upon his legs, that bird.\r\nHe would have snapped \'em off short in a minute, like sticks of\r\nsealing-wax.\r\n\r\n"Why, it\'s impossible to carry that to Camden Town," said Scrooge. "You\r\nmust have a cab."\r\n\r\nThe chuckle with which he said this, and the chuckle with which he paid\r\nfor the turkey, and the chuckle with which he paid for the cab, and the\r\nchuckle with which he recompensed the boy, were only exceeded by the\r\nchuckle with which he sat down breathlessly in his chair again, and\r\nchuckled till he cried.\r\n\r\nShaving was not an easy task, for his hand continued to shake very much;\r\nand shaving requires attention, even when you don\'t dance while you are\r\nat it. But, if he had cut the end of his nose off, he would have put a\r\npiece of sticking-plaster over it, and been quite satisfied.\r\n\r\nHe dressed himself "all in his best," and at last got out into the\r\nstreets. The people were by this time pouring forth, as he had seen them\r\nwith the Ghost of Christmas Present; and, walking with his hands behind\r\nhim, Scrooge regarded everyone with a delighted smile. He looked so\r\nirresistibly pleasant, in a word, that three or four good-humoured\r\nfellows said: "Good-morning, sir! A Merry Christmas to you!" And Scrooge\r\nsaid often afterwards, that, of all the blithe sounds he had ever heard,\r\nthose were the blithest in his ears....\r\n\r\nHe went to church, and walked about the streets, and watched the people\r\nhurrying to and fro, and patted the children on the head, and questioned\r\nbeggars, and looked down into the kitchens of houses and up to the\r\nwindows, and found that every thing could yield him pleasure. He had\r\nnever dreamed that any walk--that anything--could give him so much\r\nhappiness. In the afternoon, he turned his steps towards his nephew\'s\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nHe passed the door a dozen times before he had the courage to go up and\r\nknock. But he made a dash and did it.\r\n\r\n"Is your master at home, my dear?" said Scrooge to the girl. "Nice girl!\r\nVery."\r\n\r\n"Yes, sir."\r\n\r\n"Where is he, my love?" said Scrooge.\r\n\r\n"He\'s in the dining-room, sir, along with mistress. I\'ll show you\r\nupstairs, if you please."\r\n\r\n"Thank\'ee. He knows me," said Scrooge, with his hand already on the\r\ndining-room lock. "I\'ll go in here, my dear."\r\n\r\nHe turned it gently, and sidled his face in, round the door. They were\r\nlooking at the table (which was spread out in great array); for these\r\nyoung housekeepers are always nervous on such points, and like to see\r\nthat everything is right.\r\n\r\n"Fred!" said Scrooge. Dear heart alive, how his niece by marriage\r\nstarted!...\r\n\r\n"Why, bless my soul!" cried Fred, "Who\'s that?"\r\n\r\n"It\'s I. Your uncle Scrooge. I have come to dinner. Will you let me in,\r\nFred?"\r\n\r\nLet him in! It is a mercy he didn\'t shake his arm off. He was at home in\r\nfive minutes. Nothing could be heartier. His niece looked just the same.\r\nSo did Topper when _he_ came. So did the plump sister when _she_ came.\r\nSo did everybody when _they_ came. Wonderful party, wonderful games,\r\nwonderful unanimity, won-der-ful happiness!\r\n\r\nBut he was early at the office next morning. Oh, he was early there. If\r\nhe could only be there first, and catch Bob Cratchit coming late! That\r\nwas the first thing he had set his heart upon.\r\n\r\nAnd he did it; yes, he did! The clock struck nine. No Bob. A quarter\r\npast. No Bob. He was full eighteen minutes and a half behind his time.\r\nScrooge sat with his door wide open, that he might see him come into the\r\nTank.\r\n\r\nHis hat was off, before he opened the door, his comforter, too. He was\r\non his stool in a jiffy, driving away with his pen, as if he were trying\r\nto overtake nine o\'clock.\r\n\r\n"Hallo!" growled Scrooge, in his accustomed voice, as near as he could\r\nfeign it. "What do you mean by coming here at this time of day?"\r\n\r\n"I am very sorry, sir," said Bob. "I _am_ behind my time."\r\n\r\n"You are!" repeated Scrooge. "Yes, I think you are. Step this way, sir,\r\nif you please."\r\n\r\n"It\'s only once a year, sir," pleaded Bob, appearing from the Tank. "It\r\nshall not be repeated. I was making rather merry yesterday, sir."\r\n\r\n"Now, I\'ll tell you what, my friend," said Scrooge, "I am not going to\r\nstand this sort of thing any longer. And therefore," he continued,\r\nleaping from his stool, and giving Bob such a dig in his waistcoat that\r\nhe staggered back into the Tank again,--"and, therefore, I am about to\r\nraise your salary!"\r\n\r\nBob trembled, and got a little nearer to the ruler. He had a momentary\r\nidea of knocking Scrooge down with it, holding him, and calling to the\r\npeople in the court for help and a strait-waistcoat.\r\n\r\n"A Merry Christmas, Bob!" said Scrooge, with an earnestness that could\r\nnot be mistaken, as he clapped him on the back. "A Merrier Christmas,\r\nBob, my good fellow, than I have given you for many a year! I\'ll raise\r\nyour salary, and endeavour to assist your struggling family, and we\'ll\r\ndiscuss your affairs this very afternoon, over a Christmas bowl of\r\nsmoking bishop. Bob! Make up the fires, and buy another scuttle of coal\r\nbefore you dot another i, Bob Cratchit!"\r\n\r\nScrooge was better than his word. He did it all, and infinitely more;\r\nand to Tiny Tim, who did NOT die, he was second father. He became as\r\ngood a friend, as good a master, and as good a man as the good old city\r\nknew, or any other good old city, town, or borough, in the good old\r\nworld. Some people laughed to see the alteration in him, but he let them\r\nlaugh, and little heeded them; for he was wise enough to know nothing\r\never happened on this globe, for good, at which some people did not have\r\ntheir fill of laughter in the outset; and knowing that such as these\r\nwould be blind any way, he thought it quite as well that they should\r\nwrinkle up their eyes in grins, as have the malady in less attractive\r\nforms. His own heart laughed, and that was quite enough for him.\r\n\r\nHe had no further intercourse with Spirits, but lived upon the Total\r\nAbstinence Principle ever afterwards; and it was always said of him,\r\nthat he knew how to keep Christmas well, if any man alive possessed the\r\nknowledge. May that be truly said of us, and all of us!

And Joseph said unto them, What\r\ndeed is this that ye have done? know ye not that such a man as I can\r\nindeed divine? And Judah said, What shall we say unto my lord? what\r\nshall we speak? or how shall we clear ourselves? God hath found out the\r\niniquity of thy servants: behold, we are my lord\'s bondmen, both we, and\r\nhe also in whose hand the cup is found. And he said, God forbid that I\r\nshould do so: the man in whose hand the cup is found, he shall be my\r\nbondman; but as for you, get you up in peace unto your father.\r\n\r\nThen Judah came near unto him, and said, Oh my lord, let thy servant, I\r\npray thee, speak a word in my lord\'s ears, and let not thine anger burn\r\nagainst thy servant: for thou art even as Pharaoh. My lord asked his\r\nservants, saying, Have ye a father, or a brother? And we said unto my\r\nlord, We have a father, an old man, and a child of his old age, a little\r\none; and his brother is dead, and he alone is left of his mother, and\r\nhis father loveth him. And thou saidst unto thy servants, Bring him\r\ndown unto me, that I may set mine eyes upon him. And we said unto my\r\nlord, The lad cannot leave his father: for if he should leave his\r\nfather, his father would die. And thou saidst unto thy servants, Except\r\nyour youngest brother come down with you, ye shall see my face no more.\r\nAnd it came to pass when we came up unto thy servant my father, we told\r\nhim the words of my lord. And our father said, Go again, buy us a little\r\nfood. And we said, We cannot go down: if our youngest brother be with\r\nus, then will we go down: for we may not see the man\'s face, except our\r\nyoungest brother be with us. And thy servant my father said unto us, Ye\r\nknow that my wife bare me two sons: and the one went out from me, and I\r\nsaid, Surely he is torn in pieces; and I have not seen him since: and if\r\nye take this one also from me, and mischief befall him, ye shall bring\r\ndown my gray hairs with sorrow to the grave. Now, therefore, when I come\r\nto thy servant my father, and the lad be not with us; seeing that his\r\nlife is bound up in the lad\'s life; it shall come to pass, when he seeth\r\nthat the lad is not with us, that he will die: and thy servants shall\r\nbring down the gray hairs of thy servant our father with sorrow to the\r\ngrave. For thy servant became surety for the lad unto my father, saying,\r\nIf I bring him not unto thee, then shall I bear the blame to my father\r\nfor ever. Now therefore, let thy servant, I pray thee, abide instead of\r\nthe lad a bondman to my lord; and let the lad go up with his brethren.\r\nFor how shall I go up to my father, and the lad be not with me? lest I\r\nsee the evil that shall come on my father.\r\n\r\nThen Joseph could not refrain himself before all them that stood by him;\r\nand he cried, Cause every man to go out from me. And there stood no man\r\nwith him, while Joseph made himself known unto his brethren. And he wept\r\naloud: and the Egyptians heard, and the house of Pharaoh heard. And\r\nJoseph said unto his brethren, I am Joseph; doth my father yet live? And\r\nhis brethren could not answer him; for they were troubled at his\r\npresence. And Joseph said unto his brethren, Come near to me, I pray\r\nyou. And they came near. And he said, I am Joseph your brother whom ye\r\nsold into Egypt. And now be not grieved, nor angry with yourselves, that\r\nye sold me hither: for God did send me before you to preserve life. For\r\nthese two years hath the famine been in the land; and there are yet five\r\nyears in the which there shall be neither ploughing nor harvest. And\r\nGod sent me before you to preserve you a remnant in the earth, and to\r\nsave you alive by a great deliverance. So now it was not you that sent\r\nme hither, but God: and he hath made me a father to Pharaoh, and lord of\r\nall his house, and ruler over all the land of Egypt. Haste ye, and go up\r\nto my father, and say unto him, Thus saith thy son Joseph, God hath made\r\nme lord of all Egypt: come down unto me, tarry not: and thou shalt dwell\r\nin the land of Goshen, and thou shalt be near unto me, thou, and thy\r\nchildren, and thy children\'s children, and thy flocks, and thy herds,\r\nand all that thou hast: and there will I nourish thee; for there are yet\r\nfive years of famine; lest thou come to poverty, thou, and thy\r\nhousehold, and all that thou hast. And, behold, your eyes see, and the\r\neyes of my brother Benjamin, that it is my mouth that speaketh unto you.\r\nAnd ye shall tell my father of all my glory in Egypt, and of all that ye\r\nhave seen; and ye shall haste and bring down my father hither. And he\r\nfell upon his brother Benjamin\'s neck, and wept; and Benjamin wept upon\r\nhis neck. And he kissed all his brethren, and wept upon them; and after\r\nthat his brethren talked with him.\r\n\r\nGenesis, XLIV-V.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMIRIAM\'S SONG\r\n\r\n(Read Exodus, XV.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    Sound the loud timbrel o\'er Egypt\'s dark sea!\r\n    Jehovah hath triumphed--His people are free.\r\n    Sing--for the pride of the tyrant is broken,\r\n    His chariots and horsemen all splendid and brave,\r\n    How vain was their boasting! the Lord hath but spoken,\r\n    And chariots and horsemen are sunk in the wave.\r\n    Sound the loud timbrel o\'er Egypt\'s dark sea!\r\n    Jehovah hath triumphed--His people are free.\r\n\r\n    Praise to the Conqueror, praise to the Lord!\r\n    His word was the arrow, His breath was our sword!\r\n    Who shall return to tell Egypt the story\r\n    Of those she sent forth in the power of her pride?\r\n    For the Lord hath looked out from His pillar of glory,\r\n    And all her brave thousands are dashed in the tide.\r\n    Sound the loud timbrel o\'er Egypt\'s dark sea!\r\n    Jehovah hath triumphed--His people are free.\r\n\r\nThomas Moore\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DESTRUCTION OF SENNACHERIB\r\n\r\n(Read II. Kings, XIX. 35)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold,\r\n    And his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold;\r\n    And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea,\r\n    When the blue wave rolls nightly on deep Galilee.\r\n\r\n    Like the leaves of the forest when Summer is green,\r\n    That host with their banners at sunset were seen:\r\n    Like the leaves of the forest when Autumn hath blown,\r\n    That host on the morrow lay withered and strown.\r\n\r\n    For the Angel of Death spread his wings on the blast,\r\n    And breathed in the face of the foe as he passed;\r\n    And the eyes of the sleepers waxed deadly and chill,\r\n    And their hearts but once heaved, and for ever grew still!\r\n\r\n    And there lay the steed with his nostril all wide,\r\n    But through it there rolled not the breath of his pride:\r\n    And the foam of his gasping lay white on the turf,\r\n    And cold as the spray of the rock-beating surf.\r\n\r\n    And there lay the rider, distorted and pale,\r\n    With the dew on his brow, and the rust on his mail;\r\n    And the tents were all silent, the banners alone,\r\n    The lances unlifted, the trumpet unblown.\r\n\r\n    And the widows of Ashur are loud in their wail,\r\n    And the idols are broke in the temple of Baal;\r\n    And the might of the Gentile, unsmote by the sword,\r\n    Hath melted like snow in the glance of the Lord!\r\n\r\nByron\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    The house of the wicked shall be overthrown:\r\n    But the tent of the upright shall flourish.\r\n    In the fear of the Lord is strong confidence:\r\n    And his children shall have a place of refuge.\r\n\r\nProverbs\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LARK AT THE DIGGINGS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe friends strode briskly on, and a little after eleven o\'clock they\r\ncame upon a small squatter\'s house and premises. "Here we are," cried\r\nGeorge, and his eyes glittered with innocent delight.\r\n\r\nThe house was thatched and whitewashed, and English was written on it\r\nand on every foot of ground round it. A furze-bush had been planted by\r\nthe door. Vertical oak palings were the fence, with a five-barred gate\r\nin the middle of them. From the little plantation, all the magnificent\r\ntrees and shrubs of Australia had been excluded with amazing resolution\r\nand consistency, and oak and ash reigned safe from overtowering rivals.\r\nThey passed to the back of the house, and there George\'s countenance\r\nfell a little, for on the oval grass-plot and gravel-walk he found from\r\nthirty to forty rough fellows, most of them diggers.\r\n\r\n"Ah, well," said he, on reflection, "we could not expect to have it all\r\nto ourselves, and indeed it would be a sin to wish it, you know. Now,\r\nTom, come this way; here it is, here it is,--there." Tom looked up, and\r\nin a gigantic cage was a light brown bird.\r\n\r\nHe was utterly confounded. "What, is it this we came twelve miles to\r\nsee?"\r\n\r\n"Ay! and twice twelve wouldn\'t have been much to me."\r\n\r\n"Well, but what is the lark you talked of?"\r\n\r\n"This is it."\r\n\r\n"This? This is a bird."\r\n\r\n"Well, and isn\'t a lark a bird?"\r\n\r\n"O, ay! I see! ha! ha! ha! ha!"\r\n\r\nRobinson\'s merriment was interrupted by a harsh remonstrance from\r\nseveral of the diggers, who were all from the other end of the camp.\r\n\r\n"Hold your--cackle," cried one, "he is going to sing;" and the whole\r\nparty had their eyes turned with expectation towards the bird.\r\n\r\nLike most singers, he kept them waiting a bit. But at last, just at\r\nnoon, when the mistress of the house had warranted him to sing, the\r\nlittle feathered exile began, as it were, to tune his pipes. The savage\r\nmen gathered round the cage that moment, and amidst a dead stillness the\r\nbird uttered some very uncertain chirps, but after awhile he seemed to\r\nrevive his memories, and call his ancient cadences back to him one by\r\none, and string them _sotto voce_.\r\n\r\nAnd then the same sun that had warmed his little heart at home came\r\nglowing down on him here, and he gave music back for it more and more,\r\ntill at last--amidst breathless silence and glistening eyes of the rough\r\ndiggers hanging on his voice--out burst in that distant land his English\r\nsong.\r\n\r\nIt swelled his little throat and gushed from him with thrilling force\r\nand purity, and every time he checked his song to think of its theme,\r\nthe green meadows, the quiet stealing streams, the clover he first\r\nsoared from, and the spring he sang so well, a loud sigh from many a\r\nrough bosom, many a wild and wicked heart, told how tight the listeners\r\nhad held their breath to hear him; and when he swelled with song again,\r\nand poured with all his soul the green meadows, the quiet brooks, the\r\nhoney clover, and the English spring, the rugged mouths opened and so\r\nstayed, and the shaggy lips trembled, and more than one drop trickled\r\nfrom fierce unbridled hearts down bronzed and rugged cheeks.\r\n\r\n_Dulce domum!_\r\n\r\nAnd these shaggy men, full of oaths and strife and cupidity, had once\r\nbeen white-headed boys, and had strolled about the English fields with\r\nlittle sisters and little brothers, and seen the lark rise, and heard\r\nhim sing this very song. The little playmates lay in the churchyard,\r\nand they were full of oaths and drink and lusts and remorses,--but no\r\nnote was changed in this immortal song. And so for a moment or two,\r\nyears of vice rolled away like a dark cloud from the memory, and the\r\npast shone out in the song-shine: they came back, bright as the immortal\r\nnotes that lighted them, those faded pictures and those fleeted days;\r\nthe cottage, the old mother\'s tears when he left her without one grain\r\nof sorrow; the village church and its simple chimes; the clover field\r\nhard by in which he lay and gambolled, while the lark praised God\r\noverhead; the chubby playmates that never grew to be wicked, the sweet\r\nhours of youth--and innocence--and home.\r\n\r\nCharles Reade: "It is Never Too Late to Mend."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ANCIENT MARINER\r\n\r\n\r\n    It is an ancient Mariner,\r\n      And he stoppeth one of three.\r\n    "By thy long gray beard and glittering eye,\r\n      Now wherefore stopp\'st thou me?\r\n\r\n    The Bridegroom\'s doors are opened wide,\r\n      And I am next of kin;\r\n    The guests are met, the feast is set:\r\n      May\'st hear the merry din."\r\n\r\n    He holds him with his skinny hand,\r\n      "There was a ship," quoth he.\r\n    "Hold off! unhand me, grey-beard, loon!"\r\n      Eftsoons his hand dropt he.\r\n\r\n    He holds him with his glittering eye--\r\n      The Wedding-Guest stood still,\r\n    And listens like a three years\' child:\r\n      The Mariner hath his will.\r\n\r\n    The Wedding-Guest sat on a stone:\r\n      He cannot choose but hear;\r\n    And thus spake on that ancient man,\r\n      The bright-eyed Mariner:\r\n\r\n    "The ship was cheered, the harbour cleared,\r\n      Merrily did we drop\r\n    Below the kirk, below the hill,\r\n      Below the lighthouse top.\r\n\r\n    The Sun came up upon the left,\r\n      Out of the sea came he!\r\n    And he shone bright, and on the right\r\n      Went down into the sea.\r\n\r\n    Higher and higher every day,\r\n      Till over the mast at noon--"\r\n    The Wedding-Guest here beat his breast,\r\n      For he heard the loud bassoon.\r\n\r\n    The Bride hath paced into the hall,\r\n      Red as a rose is she;\r\n    Nodding their heads before her goes\r\n      The merry minstrelsy.\r\n\r\n    The Wedding-Guest he beat his breast,\r\n      Yet he cannot choose but hear;\r\n    And thus spake on that ancient man,\r\n      The bright-eyed Mariner:\r\n\r\n    "And now the storm-blast came, and he\r\n      Was tyrannous and strong:\r\n    He struck with his o\'ertaking wings,\r\n      And chased us south along.\r\n\r\n    With sloping masts and dipping prow,\r\n      As who pursued with yell and blow\r\n    Still treads the shadow of his foe,\r\n      And forward bends his head,\r\n    The ship drove fast, loud roared the blast,\r\n      And southward aye we fled.\r\n\r\n    And now there came both mist and snow,\r\n      And it grew wondrous cold:\r\n    And ice, mast-high, came floating by,\r\n      As green as emerald.\r\n\r\n    And through the drifts the snowy clifts\r\n      Did send a dismal sheen:\r\n    Nor shapes of men nor beasts we ken--\r\n      The ice was all between.\r\n\r\n    The ice was here, the ice was there,\r\n      The ice was all around:\r\n    It cracked and growled, and roared and howled,\r\n      Like noises in a swound.\r\n\r\n    At length did cross an Albatross,--\r\n      Thorough the fog it came;\r\n    As if it had been a Christian soul,\r\n      We hailed it in God\'s name.\r\n\r\n    It ate the food it ne\'er had eat,\r\n      And round and round it flew.\r\n    The ice did split with a thunder-fit;\r\n      The helmsman steered us through!\r\n\r\n    And a good south wind sprung up behind;\r\n      The Albatross did follow,\r\n    And every day, for food or play,\r\n      Came to the mariners\' hollo!\r\n\r\n    In mist or cloud, on mast or shroud,\r\n      It perched for vespers nine;\r\n    Whiles all the night, through fog-smoke white,\r\n      Glimmered the white Moon-shine."\r\n\r\n    "God save thee, ancient Mariner,\r\n      From the fiends, that plague thee thus!--\r\n    Why look\'st thou so?"--"With my cross-bow\r\n      I shot the Albatross."\r\n\r\nColeridge\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAT THE CLOSE OF THE FRENCH PERIOD IN CANADA\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the flag of France departed from Canada, it left a people destined\r\nto find under the new rule a fuller freedom, an ampler political\r\ndevelopment, a far more abundant prosperity. It left a people destined\r\nto honour their new allegiance by loyalty and heroic service in the hour\r\nof trial.\r\n\r\nThis people, which thus became British by a campaign and a treaty, was\r\ndestined to form the solid core around which should grow the vast\r\nConfederation of Canada. But for them there would now, in all\r\nlikelihood, be no Canada. By their rejection of the proposals of the\r\nrevolted colonies, the northern half of this continent was preserved to\r\nGreat Britain. The debt which the empire owes to the French Canadians is\r\nimmeasurably greater than we at present realize. Let us examine the\r\ncharacteristics of the small and isolated people which was to exercise\r\nsuch a deep influence on the future of this continent.\r\n\r\nThe whole population of Canada when she came under the British flag was\r\nabout sixty thousand. This hardy handful was gathered chiefly at Quebec,\r\nThree Rivers, and Montreal. The rest trailed thinly along the shores of\r\nthe St. Lawrence and the Richelieu. The lands about the Great Lakes, and\r\nthe western country, were held only by a few scattered forts, buried\r\nhere and there in the green wilderness. At Detroit had sprung up a\r\nscanty settlement of perhaps one thousand souls. In these remote posts\r\nthe all-important question was still that of the fur-trade with the\r\nIndians. The traders and the soldiers, cut off from civilization,\r\nfrequently took wives from the Indian tribes about them, and settled\r\ndown to a life half barbarous. These men soon grew as lawless as their\r\nadopted kinsfolk. They were a weakness and a discredit to the country in\r\ntime of peace, but in war their skill and daring were the frontier\'s\r\nbest defence.\r\n\r\nQuebec had seven thousand inhabitants. Most of them dwelt between the\r\nwater\'s edge and the foot of the great cliff whose top was crowned by\r\nthe citadel. Where the shoulder of the promontory swept around toward\r\nthe St. Charles, the slope became more gentle, and there the houses and\r\nstreets began to clamber toward the summit. Streets that found\r\nthemselves growing too precipitous had a way, then as now, of changing\r\nsuddenly into flights of stairs. The city walls, grimly bastioned, ran\r\nin bold zigzags across the face of the steep in a way to daunt\r\nassailants. Down the hillside, past the cathedral and the college,\r\nthrough the heart of the city, clattered a noisy brook, which in time of\r\nfreshet flooded the neighbouring streets. Part of the city was within\r\nwalls, part without. Most of the houses were low, one-story buildings,\r\nwith large expanse of steep roof, and high dormer windows. Along the\r\nincline leading down to the St. Charles stretched populous suburbs. On\r\nthe high plateau where now lies the stately New Town, there was then but\r\na bleak pasture-land whose grasses waved against the city gates.\r\n\r\nMontreal, after its childhood of awful trial, had greatly prospered. Its\r\npopulation had risen to about nine thousand. The fur-trade of the\r\nmysterious Northwest, developed by a succession of daring and tireless\r\nwood-rangers, had poured its wealth into the lap of the city of\r\nMaisonneuve. The houses, some of which were built of the light gray\r\nstone which now gives dignity to the city, were usually of but one\r\nstory. They were arranged in three or four long lines parallel to the\r\nriver. The towers of the Seminary of St. Sulpicius and the spires of\r\nthree churches, standing out against the green of the stately mountain,\r\nwere conspicuous from afar to voyagers coming up the river from Quebec.\r\nThe city was inclosed by a stone wall and a shallow ditch, once useful\r\nas a defence against the Indians, but no protection in the face of\r\nserious assault. At the lower end of the city, covering the\r\nlanding-place, rose a high earthwork crowned with cannon.\r\n\r\nThe houses of the _habitants_, tillers of the soil, were small cabins,\r\nhumble but warm, with wide, overhanging eaves, and consisting at most of\r\ntwo rooms. The partition, when there was one, was of boards. Lath and\r\nplaster were unknown. The walls within, to the height of a man\'s\r\nshoulders, were worn smooth by the backs that leaned against them. Solid\r\nwooden boxes and benches usually took the place of chairs. A clumsy\r\nloom, on which the women wove their coarse homespuns of wool or flax,\r\noccupied one corner of the main room; and a deep, box-like cradle,\r\nalways rocking, stood beside the ample fireplace. Over the fire stood\r\nthe long, black arms of a crane, on which was done most of the cooking;\r\nthough the "bake-kettle" sometimes relieved its labours, and the brick\r\noven was a standby in houses of the rich _habitants_, as well as of the\r\ngentry. For the roasting of meats the spit was much in use; and there\r\nwas a gridiron with legs, to stand on the hearth, with a heap of hot\r\ncoals raked under it. The houses even of the upper classes were seldom\r\ntwo stories in height. But they were generally furnished with a good\r\ndeal of luxury; and in the cities they were sometimes built of stone.\r\n\r\nA typical country mansion, the dwelling of a seigneur on his own domain,\r\nwas usually of the following fashion. The main building, one story in\r\nheight but perhaps a hundred feet long, was surmounted by lofty gables\r\nand a very steep roof, built thus to shed the snow and to give a roomy\r\nattic for bed-chambers. The attic was lighted by numerous, high-peaked\r\ndormer windows, piercing the expanse of the roof. This main building was\r\nflanked by one or more wings. Around it clustered the wash-house\r\n(adjoining the kitchen), coach house, barns, stable, and woodsheds. This\r\nhomelike cluster of walls and roofs was sheltered from the winter storm\r\nby groves of evergreen, and girdled cheerily by orchard and\r\nkitchen-garden. On one side, and not far off, was usually a village with\r\na church-spire gleaming over it; on the other a circular stone mill,\r\nresembling a little fortress rather than a peaceful aid to industry.\r\nThis structure, where all the tenants of the seigneur were obliged to\r\ngrind their grain, had indeed been built in the first place to serve not\r\nonly as a mill, but as a place of refuge from the Iroquois. It was\r\nfurnished with loopholes, and was impregnable to the attacks of an enemy\r\nlacking cannon.\r\n\r\nThe dress of the upper classes was like that prevailing among the same\r\nclasses in France, though much less extravagant. The long, wide-frocked\r\ncoats were of gay-coloured and costly material, with lace at neck and\r\nwristbands. The waistcoat might be richly embroidered with gold or\r\nsilver. Knee-breeches took the place of our unsightly trousers, and were\r\nfastened with bright buckles at the knee. Stockings were of white or\r\ncoloured silk, and shoes were set off by broad buckles at the instep.\r\nThese, of course, were the dresses of ceremony, the dresses seen at\r\nballs and grand receptions. Out-of-doors, and in the winter especially,\r\nthe costumes of the nobility were more distinctly Canadian. Overcoats of\r\nnative cloth were worn, with large, pointed hoods. Their pattern is\r\npreserved to the present day in the blanket coats of our snow-shoers.\r\nYoung men might be seen going about in colours that brightened the\r\ndesolate winter landscape. Gay belts of green, blue, red, or yellow\r\nenriched the waists of their thick overcoats. Their scarlet leggings\r\nwere laced up with green ribbons. Their moccasins were gorgeously\r\nembroidered with dyed porcupine quills. Their caps of beaver or martin\r\nwere sometimes tied down over their ears with vivid handkerchiefs of\r\nsilk. The _habitants_ were rougher and more sombre in their dress. A\r\nblack homespun coat, gray leggings, gray woollen cap, heavy moccasins of\r\ncowhide,--this grave costume was usually brightened by a belt or sash of\r\nthe liveliest colours. The country-women had to content themselves with\r\nthe same coarse homespuns, which they wore in short, full skirts. But\r\nthey got the gay colours which they loved in kerchiefs for their necks\r\nand shoulders.\r\n\r\nIn war the regulars were sharply distinguished from those of the British\r\narmy by their uniforms. The white of the House of Bourbon was the colour\r\nthat marked their regiments, as scarlet marked those of the British. The\r\nmilitia and wood-rangers fought in their ordinary dress,--or,\r\noccasionally, with the object of terrifying their enemies, put on the\r\nwar-paint and eagle-quills of the Indians. The muskets of the day were\r\nthe heavy weapons known as flint-locks. When the trigger was pulled the\r\nflint came down sharply on a piece of steel, and the spark, falling into\r\na shallow "pan" of powder called the "priming," ignited the charge. The\r\nregulars carried bayonets on the ends of their muskets, but the militia\r\nand rangers had little use for these weapons. They depended on their\r\nmarksmanship, which was deadly. The regulars fired breast high in the\r\ndirection of their enemy, trusting to the steadiness and closeness of\r\ntheir fire; but the colonials did not waste their precious bullets and\r\npowder in this way. They had learned from the Indians, whom they could\r\nbeat at their own game, to fight from behind trees, rocks, or hillocks,\r\nto load and fire lying down, and to surprise their enemies by stealing\r\nnoiselessly through the underbrush. At close quarters they fought, like\r\nthe Indians, with knife and hatchet, both of which were carried in their\r\nbelts. From the ranger\'s belt, too, when on the march, hung the leathern\r\nbag of bullets, and the inevitable tobacco-pouch; while from his neck\r\nswung a powder-horn, often richly carved, together with his cherished\r\npipe inclosed in its case of skin. Very often, however, the ranger\r\nspared himself the trouble of a pipe by scooping a bowl in the back of\r\nhis tomahawk and fitting it with a hollow handle. Thus the same\r\nimplement became both the comfort of his leisure and the torment of his\r\nenemies. In winter, when the Canadians, expert in the use of the\r\nsnow-shoe and fearless of the cold, did much of their fighting, they\r\nwore thick peaked hoods over their heads, and looked like a procession\r\nof friars wending through the silent forest on some errand of piety or\r\nmercy. Their hands were covered by thick mittens of woollen yarn, and\r\nthey dragged their provisions and blankets on sleds or toboggans. At\r\nnight they would use their snow-shoes to shovel a wide, circular pit in\r\nthe snow, clearing it away to the bare earth. In the centre of the pit,\r\nthey would build their camp fire, and sleep around it on piles of spruce\r\nboughs, secure from the winter wind. The leaders, usually members of\r\nthe nobility, fared on these expeditions as rudely as their men, and\r\noutdid them in courage and endurance. Some of the most noted chiefs of\r\nthe wood-rangers were scions of the noblest families; and though living\r\nmost of the year the life of savages, were able to shine by their graces\r\nand refinement in the courtliest society of the day.\r\n\r\nCharles G.

G. Scott\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTORY OF ABSALOM\r\n\r\n\r\nSo the people went out into the field against Israel: and the battle was\r\nin the wood of Ephraim; where the people of Israel were slain before the\r\nservants of David, and there was there a great slaughter that day of\r\ntwenty thousand men. For the battle was there scattered over the face of\r\nall the country: and the wood devoured more people that day than the\r\nsword devoured.\r\n\r\nAnd Absalom met the servants of David. And Absalom rode upon a mule, and\r\nthe mule went under the thick boughs of a great oak, and his head caught\r\nhold of the oak, and he was taken up between the heaven and the earth;\r\nand the mule that was under him went away.\r\n\r\nAnd a certain man saw it, and told Joab, and said, Behold, I saw Absalom\r\nhanged in an oak.\r\n\r\nAnd Joab said unto the man that told him, And, behold, thou sawest him,\r\nand why didst thou not smite him there to the ground? and I would have\r\ngiven thee ten shekels of silver, and a girdle.\r\n\r\nAnd the man said unto Joab, Though I should receive a thousand shekels\r\nof silver in mine hand, yet would I not put forth mine hand against the\r\nking\'s son: for in our hearing the king charged thee and Abishai and\r\nIttai, saying, Beware that none touch the young man Absalom. Otherwise I\r\nshould have wrought falsehood against mine own life: for there is no\r\nmatter hid from the king, and thou thyself wouldest have set thyself\r\nagainst me.\r\n\r\nThen said Joab, I may not tarry thus with thee. And he took three darts\r\nin his hand, and thrust them through the heart of Absalom, while he was\r\nyet alive in the midst of the oak. And ten young men that bare Joab\'s\r\narmour compassed about and smote Absalom, and slew him.\r\n\r\nAnd Joab blew the trumpet, and the people returned from pursuing after\r\nIsrael: for Joab held back the people. And they took Absalom, and cast\r\nhim into a great pit in the wood, and laid a very great heap of stones\r\nupon him: and all Israel fled every one to his tent.\r\n\r\n     *       *       *      *       *\r\n\r\nAnd David sat between the two gates: and the watchman went up to the\r\nroof over the gate unto the wall, and lifted up his eyes, and looked,\r\nand behold a man running alone. And the watchman cried, and told the\r\nking. And the king said, If he be alone, there is tidings in his mouth.\r\nAnd he came apace, and drew near.\r\n\r\nAnd the watchman saw another man running: and the watchman called unto\r\nthe porter, and said, Behold another man running alone. And the king\r\nsaid, He also bringeth tidings. And the watchman said, Me thinketh the\r\nrunning of the foremost is like the running of Ahimaaz, the son of\r\nZadok. And the king said, He is a good man, and cometh with good\r\ntidings.\r\n\r\nAnd Ahimaaz called, and said unto the king, All is well. And he fell\r\ndown to the earth upon his face before the king, and said, Blessed be\r\nthe Lord thy God, which hath delivered up the men that lifted up their\r\nhand against my lord the king.\r\n\r\nAnd the king said, Is the young man Absalom safe? And Ahimaaz answered,\r\nWhen Joab sent the king\'s servant, and me thy servant, I saw a great\r\ntumult, but I knew not what it was. And the king said unto him, Turn\r\naside, and stand here. And he turned aside, and stood still.\r\n\r\nAnd, behold, Cushi came; and Cushi said, Tidings, my lord the king: for\r\nthe Lord hath avenged thee this day of all them that rose up against\r\nthee. And the king said unto Cushi, Is the young man Absalom safe? And\r\nCushi answered, The enemies of my lord the king, and all that rise\r\nagainst thee to do thee hurt, be as that young man is.\r\n\r\nAnd the king was much moved, and went up to the chamber over the gate,\r\nand wept: and as he went, thus he said, O my son Absalom, my son, my son\r\nAbsalom! would God I had died for thee, O Absalom, my son, my son!\r\n\r\n     *       *       *      *       *\r\n\r\nAnd the victory that day was turned into mourning unto all the people:\r\nfor the people heard say that day how the king was grieved for his son.\r\nAnd the people gat them by stealth that day into the city, as people\r\nbeing ashamed steal away when they flee in battle.\r\n\r\nBut the king covered his face, and the king cried with a loud voice, O\r\nmy son Absalom, O Absalom, my son, my son!\r\n\r\nII. Samuel, XVIII-XIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    I slept, and dreamed that life was beauty;\r\n    I woke, and found that life was duty.\r\n    Was my dream, then, a shadowy lie?\r\n    Toil on, brave heart, unceasingly,\r\n    And thou shalt find thy dream to be\r\n    A noonday light and truth to thee.\r\n\r\nHooper\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BURIAL OF MOSES\r\n\r\n(Read Deuteronomy, XXXII. 48-50)\r\n\r\n\r\n    By Nebo\'s lonely mountain,\r\n    On this side Jordan\'s wave,\r\n    In a vale in the land of Moab,\r\n    There lies a lonely grave;\r\n    And no man knows that sepulchre,\r\n    And no man saw it e\'er;\r\n    For the angels of God upturned the sod,\r\n    And laid the dead man there.\r\n\r\n    That was the grandest funeral\r\n    That ever passed on earth;\r\n    But no man heard the trampling,\r\n    Or saw the train go forth:\r\n    Noiselessly as the daylight\r\n    Comes when the night is done,\r\n    And the crimson streak on ocean\'s cheek\r\n    Grows into the great sun;\r\n\r\n    Noiselessly as the spring-time\r\n    Her crown of verdure weaves,\r\n    And all the trees on all the hills\r\n    Open their thousand leaves:\r\n    So, without sound of music,\r\n    Or voice of them that wept,\r\n    Silently down from the mountain\'s crown\r\n    The great procession swept.\r\n\r\n    Perchance the bald old eagle,\r\n    On gray Beth-peor\'s height,\r\n    Out of his lonely eyry\r\n    Looked on the wondrous sight;\r\n    Perchance the lion stalking\r\n    Still shuns that hallowed spot;\r\n    For beast and bird have seen and heard\r\n    That which man knoweth not.\r\n\r\n    But, when the warrior dieth,\r\n    His comrades in the war,\r\n    With arms reversed and muffled drums,\r\n    Follow his funeral car;\r\n    They show the banners taken,\r\n    They tell his battles won,\r\n    And after him lead his masterless steed,\r\n    While peals the minute-gun.\r\n\r\n    Amid the noblest of the land\r\n    We lay the sage to rest,\r\n    And give the bard an honoured place,\r\n    With costly marble dressed,\r\n    In the great minster transept\r\n    Where lights like glories fall,\r\n    And the sweet choir sings, and the organ rings\r\n    Along the emblazoned wall.\r\n\r\n    This was the bravest warrior\r\n    That ever buckled sword;\r\n    This the most gifted poet\r\n    That ever breathed a word;\r\n    And never earth\'s philosopher\r\n    Traced, with his golden pen,\r\n    On the deathless page, truths half so sage\r\n    As he wrote down for men.\r\n\r\n    And had he not high honour,--\r\n    The hillside for his pall;\r\n    To lie in state, while angels wait,\r\n    With stars for tapers tall;\r\n    And the dark rock pines, like tossing plumes,\r\n    Over his bier to wave;\r\n    And God\'s own hand, in that lonely land,\r\n    To lay him in the grave;--\r\n\r\n    In that strange grave, without a name,\r\n    Whence his uncoffined clay\r\n    Shall break again--O wondrous thought!--\r\n    Before the judgment-day,\r\n    And stand, with glory wrapped around,\r\n    On the hills he never trod,\r\n    And speak of the strife that won our life\r\n    With the incarnate Son of God.\r\n\r\n    O lonely grave in Moab\'s land!\r\n    O dark Beth-peor\'s hill!\r\n    Speak to these curious hearts of ours,\r\n    And teach them to be still:\r\n    God hath His mysteries of grace,\r\n    Ways that we cannot tell;\r\n    He hides them deep, like the hidden sleep\r\n    Of him He loved so well.\r\n\r\nCecil Frances Alexander\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CRUSADER AND THE SARACEN\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the Knight of the Couchant Leopard continued to fix his eyes\r\nattentively on the yet distant cluster of palm trees, it seemed to him\r\nas if some object was moving among them. The distant form separated\r\nitself from the trees, which partly hid its motions, and advanced\r\ntowards the knight with a speed which soon showed a mounted horseman,\r\nwhom his turban, long spear, and green caftan floating in the wind, on\r\nhis nearer approach, showed to be a Saracen cavalier.\r\n\r\n"In the desert," saith an Eastern proverb, "no man meets a friend." The\r\nCrusader was totally indifferent whether the infidel, who now approached\r\non his gallant barb, as if borne on the wings of an eagle, came as\r\nfriend or foe; perhaps, as a vowed champion of the Cross, he might\r\nrather have preferred the latter. He disengaged his lance from his\r\nsaddle, seized it with the right hand, placed it in rest with its point\r\nhalf-elevated, gathered up the reins in the left, waked his horse\'s\r\nmettle with the spur, and prepared to encounter the stranger with the\r\ncalm self-confidence belonging to the victor in many contests.\r\n\r\nThe Saracen came on at the speedy gallop of an Arab horseman, managing\r\nhis steed more by his limbs and the inflection of his body than by any\r\nuse of the reins, which hung loose in his left hand; so that he was\r\nenabled to wield the light round buckler of the skin of the rhinoceros,\r\nornamented with silver loops, which he wore on his arm, swinging it as\r\nif he meant to oppose its slender circle to the formidable thrust of the\r\nWestern lance. His own long spear was not couched or levelled like that\r\nof his antagonist, but grasped by the middle with his right hand, and\r\nbrandished at arm\'s length above his head.\r\n\r\nAs the cavalier approached his enemy at full career, he seemed to expect\r\nthat the Knight of the Leopard should put his horse to the gallop to\r\nencounter him. But the Christian knight, well acquainted with the\r\ncustoms of Eastern warriors, did not mean to exhaust his good horse by\r\nany unnecessary exertion; and, on the contrary, made a dead halt,\r\nconfident that, if the enemy advanced to the actual shock, his own\r\nweight, and that of his powerful charger, would give him sufficient\r\nadvantage, without the additional momentum of rapid motion. Equally\r\nsensible and apprehensive of such a probable result, the Saracen\r\ncavalier, when he had approached towards the Christian within twice the\r\nlength of his lance, wheeled his steed to the left with inimitable\r\ndexterity, and rode twice around his antagonist, who, turning without\r\nquitting his ground, and presenting his front constantly to his enemy,\r\nfrustrated his attempts to attack him on an unguarded point; so that the\r\nSaracen, wheeling his horse, was fain to retreat to the distance of a\r\nhundred yards.\r\n\r\nA second time, like a hawk attacking a heron, the Heathen renewed the\r\ncharge, and a second time was fain to retreat without coming to a close\r\nstruggle. A third time he approached in the same manner, when the\r\nChristian knight, desirous to terminate this illusory warfare, in which\r\nhe might at length have been worn out by the activity of his foeman,\r\nsuddenly seized the mace which hung at his saddle-bow, and, with a\r\nstrong hand and unerring aim, hurled it against the head of the Emir,\r\nfor such and not less his enemy appeared. The Saracen was just aware of\r\nthe formidable missile in time to interpose his light buckler betwixt\r\nthe mace and his head; but the violence of the blow forced the buckler\r\ndown on his turban, and though that defence also contributed to deaden\r\nits violence, the Saracen was beaten from his horse. Ere the Christian\r\ncould avail himself of this mishap, his nimble foeman sprang from the\r\nground, and, calling on his steed, which instantly returned to his side,\r\nhe leaped into his seat without touching the stirrup, and regained all\r\nthe advantage of which the Knight of the Leopard hoped to deprive him.\r\nBut the latter had in the meanwhile recovered his mace, and the Eastern\r\ncavalier, who remembered the strength and dexterity with which his\r\nantagonist had aimed it, seemed to keep cautiously out of the reach of\r\nthat weapon, of which he had so lately felt the force, while he showed\r\nhis purpose of waging a distant warfare with missile weapons of his\r\nown. Planting his long spear in the sand at a distance from the scene of\r\ncombat, he strung, with great address, a short bow, which he carried at\r\nhis back, and, putting his horse to the gallop, once more described two\r\nor three circles of a wider extent than formerly, in the course of which\r\nhe discharged six arrows at the Christian with such unerring skill that\r\nthe goodness of his harness alone saved him from being wounded in as\r\nmany places. The seventh shaft apparently found a less perfect part of\r\nthe armour, and the Christian dropped heavily from his horse. But what\r\nwas the surprise of the Saracen, when, dismounting to examine the\r\ncondition of his prostrate enemy, he found himself suddenly within the\r\ngrasp of the European, who had had recourse to this artifice to bring\r\nhis enemy within his reach! Even in this deadly grapple the Saracen was\r\nsaved by his agility and presence of mind. He unloosed the sword-belt,\r\nin which the Knight of the Leopard had fixed his hold, and, thus eluding\r\nhis fatal grasp, mounted his horse, which seemed to watch his motions\r\nwith the intelligence of a human being, and again rode off. But in the\r\nlast encounter the Saracen had lost his sword and his quiver of arrows,\r\nboth of which were attached to the girdle, which he was obliged to\r\nabandon. He had also lost his turban in the struggle. These\r\ndisadvantages seemed to incline the Moslem to a truce: he approached the\r\nChristian with his right hand extended, but no longer in a menacing\r\nattitude.\r\n\r\n"There is truce betwixt our nations," he said, in the _lingua franca_\r\ncommonly used for the purpose of communication with the Crusaders;\r\n"Wherefore should there be war betwixt thee and me? Let there be peace\r\nbetwixt us."\r\n\r\n"I am well contented," answered he of the Couchant Leopard; "but what\r\nsecurity dost thou offer that thou wilt observe the truce?"\r\n\r\n"The word of a follower of the Prophet was never broken," answered the\r\nEmir. "It is thou, brave Nazarene, from whom I should demand security,\r\ndid I not know that treason seldom dwells with courage."\r\n\r\nThe Crusader felt that the confidence of the Moslem made him ashamed of\r\nhis own doubts.\r\n\r\n"By the cross of my sword," he said, laying his hand on the weapon as he\r\nspoke, "I will be true companion to thee, Saracen, while our fortune\r\nwills that we remain in company together."\r\n\r\n"By Mohammed, Prophet of God, and by Allah, God of the Prophet," replied\r\nhis late foeman, "there is not treachery in my heart towards thee. And\r\nnow wend we to yonder fountain, for the hour of rest is at hand, and the\r\nstream had hardly touched my lip when I was called to battle by thy\r\napproach."\r\n\r\nThe Knight of the Couchant Leopard yielded a ready and courteous assent;\r\nand the late foes, without an angry look or gesture of doubt, rode side\r\nby side to the little cluster of palm trees.\r\n\r\nScott: "The Talisman."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    The quality of mercy is not strained;\r\n    It droppeth, as the gentle rain from heaven\r\n    Upon the place beneath: it is twice blessed;\r\n    It blesseth him that gives, and him that takes:\r\n    \'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes\r\n    The thron\xc3\xa8d monarch better than his crown;\r\n    His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,--\r\n    The attribute to awe and majesty,\r\n    Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings,--\r\n    But mercy is above this sceptred sway;\r\n    It is enthron\xc3\xa8d in the hearts of kings,\r\n    It is an attribute to God himself;\r\n    And earthly power doth then shew likest God\'s\r\n    When mercy seasons justice.\r\n\r\nShakespeare\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_From_ "AN AUGUST REVERIE"\r\n\r\n\r\n    The ragged daisy starring all the fields,\r\n      The buttercup abrim with pallid gold,\r\n    The thistle and burr-flowers hedged with prickly shields,\r\n      All common weeds the draggled pastures hold,\r\n    With shrivelled pods and leaves, are kin to me,\r\n    Like-heirs of earth and her maturity.\r\n\r\n    They speak a silent speech that is their own,\r\n      These wise and gentle teachers of the grass;\r\n    And when their brief and common days are flown,\r\n      A certain beauty from the year doth pass:--\r\n    A beauty of whose light no eye can tell,\r\n    Save that it went; and my heart knew it well.\r\n\r\n    I may not know each plant as some men know them,\r\n      As children gather beasts and birds to tame;\r\n    But I went \'mid them as the winds that blow them,\r\n      From childhood\'s hour, and loved without a name.\r\n    There is more beauty in a field of weeds\r\n    Than in all blooms the hothouse garden breeds.\r\n\r\n    For they are nature\'s children; in their faces\r\n      I see that sweet obedience to the sky\r\n    That marks these dwellers of the wilding places,\r\n      Who with the season\'s being live and die;\r\n    Knowing no love but of the wind and sun,\r\n    Who still are nature\'s when their life is done.\r\n\r\n    They are a part of all the haze-filled hours,\r\n      The happy, happy world all drenched with light,\r\n    The far-off, chiming click-clack of the mowers,\r\n      And yon blue hills whose mists elude my sight;\r\n    And they to me will ever bring in dreams\r\n    Far mist-clad heights and brimming rain-fed streams.\r\n\r\nW. Wilfred Campbell\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWORK AND WAGES\r\n\r\n\r\nThere will always be a number of men who would fain set themselves to\r\nthe accumulation of wealth as the sole object of their lives.\r\nNecessarily, that class of men is an uneducated class, inferior in\r\nintellect, and, more or less, cowardly. It is physically impossible for\r\na well-educated, intellectual, or brave man to make money the chief\r\nobject of his thoughts; just as it is for him to make his dinner the\r\nprincipal object of them. All healthy people like their dinners, but\r\ntheir dinner is not the main object of their lives. So all\r\nhealthily-minded people like making money--ought to like it, and to\r\nenjoy the sensation of winning it: but the main object of their life is\r\nnot money; it is something better than money. A good soldier, for\r\ninstance, mainly wishes to do his fighting well. He is glad of his\r\npay--very properly so, and justly grumbles when you keep him ten years\r\nwithout it--still, his main notion of life is to win battles, not to be\r\npaid for winning them. So of clergymen. They like pew-rents, and\r\nbaptismal fees, of course; but yet, if they are brave and well-educated,\r\nthe pew-rent is not the sole object of their lives, and the baptismal\r\nfee is not the sole purpose of the baptism; the clergyman\'s object is\r\nessentially to baptize and preach, not to be paid for preaching. So of\r\ndoctors. They like fees no doubt,--ought to like them; yet if they are\r\nbrave and well-educated, the entire object of their lives is not fees.\r\nThey, on the whole, desire to cure the sick; and,--if they are good\r\ndoctors, and the choice were fairly put to them--would rather cure their\r\npatient, and lose their fee, than kill him, and get it. And so with all\r\nother brave and rightly-trained men; their work is first, their fee\r\nsecond--very important always, but still _second_. But in every nation,\r\nas I said, there are a vast class who are ill-educated, cowardly, and\r\nmore or less stupid. And with these people, just as certainly the fee is\r\nfirst, and the work second, as with brave people the work is first, and\r\nthe fee second. And this is no small distinction. It is the whole\r\ndistinction in a man; distinction between life and death _in_ him,\r\nbetween heaven and hell _for_ him. You cannot serve two masters:--you\r\n_must_ serve one or other. If your work is first with you, and your fee\r\nsecond, work is your master, and the lord of work, who is God. But, if\r\nyour fee is first with you, and your work second, fee is your master,\r\nand the lord of fee, who is the Devil; and not only the Devil but the\r\nlowest of devils--the \'least erected fiend that fell.\' So there you have\r\nit in brief terms; Work first--you are God\'s servants; Fee first--you\r\nare the Fiend\'s. And it makes a difference, now and ever, believe me,\r\nwhether you serve Him who has on His vesture and thigh written, \'King of\r\nKings,\' and whose service is perfect freedom; or him on whose vesture\r\nand thigh the name is written, \'Slave of Slaves,\' and whose service is\r\nperfect slavery.\r\n\r\nRuskin\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNTRODDEN WAYS\r\n\r\n\r\n    Where close the curving mountains drew\r\n      To clasp the stream in their embrace,\r\n    With every outline, curve, and hue,\r\n      Reflected in its placid face,\r\n\r\n    The ploughman stopped his team, to watch\r\n      The train, as swift it thundered by;\r\n    Some distant glimpse of life to catch,\r\n      He strains his eager, wistful eye.\r\n\r\n    His glossy horses mildly stand\r\n      With wonder in their patient eyes,\r\n    As through the tranquil mountain land\r\n      The snorting monster onward flies.\r\n\r\n    The morning freshness is on him,\r\n      Just wakened from his balmy dreams;\r\n    The wayfarers, all soiled and dim,\r\n      Think longingly of mountain streams:--\r\n\r\n    O for the joyous mountain air!\r\n      The long, delightful autumn day\r\n    Among the hills!--the ploughman there\r\n      Must have perpetual holiday!\r\n\r\n    And he, as all day long he guides\r\n      His steady plough with patient hand,\r\n    Thinks of the flying train that glides\r\n      Into some fair, enchanted land;\r\n\r\n    Where day by day no plodding round\r\n      Wearies the frame and dulls the mind;\r\n    Where life thrills keen to sight and sound,\r\n      With plough and furrows left behind!\r\n\r\n    Even so to each the untrod ways\r\n      Of life are touched by fancy\'s glow,\r\n    That ever sheds its brightest rays\r\n      Upon _the page we do not know_!\r\n\r\nAgnes Maule Machar\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRST PLOUGHING\r\n\r\n\r\n    Calls the crow from the pine-tree top\r\n    When the April air is still.\r\n    He calls to the farmer hitching his team\r\n    In the farmyard under the hill.\r\n    "Come up," he cries, "come out and come up,\r\n    For the high field\'s ripe to till.\r\n    Don\'t wait for word from the dandelion\r\n    Or leave from the daffodil."\r\n\r\n    Cheeps the flycatcher--"Here old earth\r\n    Warms up in the April sun;\r\n    And the first ephemera, wings yet wet,\r\n    From the mould creep one by one.\r\n    Under the fence where the flies frequent\r\n    Is the earliest gossamer spun.\r\n    Come up from the damp of the valley lands,\r\n    For here the winter\'s done."\r\n\r\n    Whistles the high-hole out of the grove\r\n    His summoning loud and clear:\r\n    "Chilly it may be down your way\r\n    But the high south field has cheer.\r\n    On the sunward side of the chestnut stump\r\n    The woodgrubs wake and appear.\r\n    Come out to your ploughing, come up to your ploughing,\r\n    The time for ploughing is here."\r\n\r\n    Then dips the coulter and drives the share,\r\n    And the furrows faintly steam.\r\n    The crow drifts furtively down from the pine\r\n    To follow the clanking team.\r\n    The flycatcher tumbles, the high-hole darts\r\n    In the young noon\'s yellow gleam;\r\n    And wholesome sweet the smell of the sod\r\n    Upturned from its winter\'s dream.\r\n\r\nCharles G. D. Roberts\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARCHERY CONTEST\r\n\r\n\r\n"The day," said Waldemar, "is not yet very far spent--let the archers\r\nshoot a few rounds at the target, and the prize be adjudged."\r\n\r\nOne by one the archers, stepping forward, delivered their shafts\r\nyeomanlike and bravely. Of the ten shafts which hit the target, two\r\nwithin the inner ring were shot by Hubert, a forester in the service of\r\nMalvoisin, who was accordingly pronounced victorious.\r\n\r\n"Now, Locksley," said Prince John with a bitter smile, "wilt thou try\r\nconclusions with Hubert?"\r\n\r\n"Sith it be no better," said Locksley, "I am content to try my fortune;\r\non condition that when I have shot two shafts at yonder mark of\r\nHubert\'s, he shall be bound to shoot one at that which I shall propose."\r\n\r\n"That is but fair," answered Prince John, "and it shall not be refused\r\nthee. If thou dost beat this braggart, Hubert, I will fill the bugle\r\nwith silver pennies for thee."\r\n\r\n"A man can but do his best," answered Hubert; "but my grandsire drew a\r\ngood long bow at Hastings, and I trust not to dishonour his memory."\r\n\r\nThe former target was now removed, and a fresh one of the same size\r\nplaced in its room. Hubert took his aim with great deliberation, long\r\nmeasuring the distance with his eye, while he held in his hand his\r\nbended bow, with the arrow placed on the string. At length he made a\r\nstep forward, and raising the bow at the full stretch of his left arm,\r\ntill the centre or grasping-place was nigh level with his face, he drew\r\nhis bow-string to his ear. The arrow whistled through the air, and\r\nlighted within the inner ring of the target, but not exactly in the\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\n"You have not allowed for the wind, Hubert," said his antagonist,\r\nbending his bow, "or that had been a better shot."\r\n\r\nSo saying, and without showing the least anxiety to pause upon his aim,\r\nLocksley stepped to the appointed station, and shot his arrow as\r\ncarelessly in appearance as if he had not even looked at the mark. He\r\nwas speaking almost at the same instant that the shaft left the\r\nbow-string, yet it alighted in the target two inches nearer to the white\r\nspot which marked the centre than that of Hubert.\r\n\r\n"By the light of heaven!" said Prince John to Hubert, "an thou suffer\r\nthat runagate knave to overcome thee, thou art worthy of the gallows!"\r\n\r\n"An your highness were to hang me," said Hubert, "a man can but do his\r\nbest. Nevertheless, my grandsire drew a good bow----"\r\n\r\n"The foul fiend on thy grandsire and all his generation!" interrupted\r\nJohn; "shoot, knave, and shoot thy best, or it shall be the worse for\r\nthee!"\r\n\r\nThus exhorted, Hubert resumed his place, and making the necessary\r\nallowance for a very light air of wind, which had just arisen, shot so\r\nsuccessfully that his arrow alighted in the very centre of the target.\r\n\r\n"Thou canst not mend that shot, Locksley," said the Prince with an\r\ninsulting smile.\r\n\r\n"I will notch his shaft for him, however," replied Locksley.\r\n\r\nAnd letting fly his arrow with a little more precaution than before, it\r\nlighted right upon that of his competitor, which it split to shivers.\r\n\r\n"And now," said Locksley, "I will crave your Grace\'s permission to plant\r\nsuch a mark as is used in the North Country, and welcome every brave\r\nyeoman who shall try a shot at it."\r\n\r\nHe then turned to leave the lists. "Let your guards attend me," he said,\r\n"if you please--I go but to cut a rod from the next willow-bush."\r\n\r\nLocksley returned almost instantly with a willow wand about six feet in\r\nlength, perfectly straight, and rather thicker than a man\'s thumb. He\r\nbegan to peel this, observing that to ask a good woodman to shoot at a\r\ntarget so broad as had hitherto been used, was to put shame upon his\r\nskill. "For my own part," he said, "and in the land where I was bred,\r\nmen would as soon take for their mark King Arthur\'s round table, which\r\nheld sixty knights around it. A child of seven years old," he said,\r\n"might hit yonder target with a headless shaft; but," added he, walking\r\ndeliberately to the other end of the lists, and sticking the willow wand\r\nupright in the ground, "he that hits that rod at five-score yards, I\r\ncall him an archer fit to bear bow and quiver before a king."\r\n\r\n"My grandsire," said Hubert, "drew a good bow at the battle of Hastings,\r\nand never shot at such a mark in his life--and neither will I. If this\r\nyeoman can cleave that rod, I give him the bucklers--or rather, I yield\r\nto the devil that is in his jerkin, and not to any human skill; a man\r\ncan but do his best, and I will not shoot where I am sure to miss. I\r\nmight as well shoot at a sunbeam, as at a twinkling white streak which I\r\ncan hardly see."\r\n\r\n"Cowardly dog!" said Prince John--"Sirrah Locksley, do thou shoot; but,\r\nif thou hittest such a mark, I will say thou art the first man ever did\r\nso. Howe\'er it be, thou shalt not crow over us with a mere show of\r\nsuperior skill."\r\n\r\n"I will do my best, as Hubert says," answered Locksley; "no man can do\r\nmore."\r\n\r\nSo saying, he again bent his bow, but on the present occasion looked\r\nwith attention to his weapon, and changed the string, which he thought\r\nwas no longer truly round, having been a little frayed by the two former\r\nshots. He then took his aim with some deliberation, and the multitude\r\nawaited the event in breathless silence. The archer vindicated their\r\nopinion of his skill: his arrow split the willow rod against which it\r\nwas aimed. A jubilee of acclamations followed; and even Prince John, in\r\nadmiration of Locksley\'s skill, lost for an instant his dislike to his\r\nperson. "These twenty nobles," he said, "which, with the bugle, thou\r\nhast fairly won, are thine own; we will make them fifty, if thou wilt\r\ntake livery and service with us as a yeoman of our body-guard, and be\r\nnear to our person. For never did so strong a hand bend a bow, or so\r\ntrue an eye direct a shaft."\r\n\r\n"Pardon me, noble Prince," said Locksley; "but I have vowed, that, if\r\never I take service, it should be with your royal brother, King Richard.\r\nThese twenty nobles I leave to Hubert, who has this day drawn as brave a\r\nbow as his grandsire did at Hastings. Had his modesty not refused the\r\ntrial, he would have hit the wand as well as I."\r\n\r\nHubert shook his head as he received with reluctance the bounty of the\r\nstranger; and Locksley, anxious to escape further observation, mixed\r\nwith the crowd, and was seen no more.\r\n\r\nScott: "Ivanhoe."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN NOVEMBER\r\n\r\n\r\n    The hills and leafless forests slowly yield\r\n      To the thick-driving snow. A little while\r\n      And night shall darken down. In shouting file\r\n    The woodmen\'s carts go by me homeward-wheeled,\r\n    Past the thin fading stubbles, half-concealed,\r\n      Now golden-gray, sowed softly through with snow,\r\n      Where the last ploughman follows still his row,\r\n    Turning black furrows through the whitening field.\r\n\r\nArchibald Lampman\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAUTUMN WOODS\r\n\r\n\r\n      Ere, in the northern gale,\r\n    The summer tresses of the trees are gone,\r\n    The woods of Autumn, all around our vale,\r\n      Have put their glory on.\r\n\r\n      The mountains that infold,\r\n    In their wide sweep, the coloured landscape round,\r\n    Seem groups of giant kings, in purple and gold,\r\n      That guard the enchanted ground.\r\n\r\n      I roam the woods that crown\r\n    The upland, where the mingled splendours glow,\r\n    Where the gay company of trees look down\r\n      On the green fields below.\r\n\r\n      My steps are not alone\r\n    In these bright walks; the sweet south-west, at play\r\n    Flies, rustling, where the painted leaves are strown\r\n      Along the winding way.\r\n\r\n      And far in heaven, the while,\r\n    The sun, that sends that gale to wander here,\r\n    Pours out on the fair earth his quiet smile,--\r\n      The sweetest of the year.\r\n\r\n      Where now the solemn shade,\r\n    Verdure and gloom where many branches meet:\r\n    So grateful, when the noon of summer made\r\n      The valleys sick with heat?\r\n\r\n      Let in through all the trees\r\n    Come the strange rays; the forest depths are bright,\r\n    Their sunny-coloured foliage, in the breeze,\r\n      Twinkles, like beams of light.\r\n\r\n      The rivulet, late unseen,\r\n    Where bickering through the shrubs its waters run,\r\n    Shines with the image of its golden screen\r\n      And glimmerings of the sun.\r\n\r\n      Oh, Autumn! why so soon\r\n    Depart the hues that make thy forests glad,\r\n    Thy gentle wind and thy fair sunny noon,\r\n      And leave thee wild and sad!\r\n\r\n      Ah! \'twere a lot too blest\r\n    Forever in thy coloured shades to stray;\r\n    Amid the kisses of the soft south-west\r\n      To rove and dream for aye;\r\n\r\n      And leave the vain low strife\r\n    That makes men mad--the tug for wealth and power,\r\n    The passions and the cares that wither life,\r\n      And waste its little hour.\r\n\r\nBryant\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN A CANOE\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong all the modes of progression hitherto invented by restless man,\r\nthere is not one that can compare in respect of comfort and luxury with\r\ntravelling in a birch-bark canoe. It is the poetry of progression. Along\r\nthe bottom of the boat are laid blankets and bedding; a sort of\r\nwicker-work screen is sloped against the middle thwart, affording a\r\ndelicious support to the back; and indolently, in your shirt sleeves if\r\nthe day be warm, or well covered with a blanket if it is chilly, you sit\r\nor lie on this most luxurious of couches, and are propelled at a rapid\r\nrate over the smooth surface of a lake or down the swift current of some\r\nstream. If you want exercise, you can take a paddle yourself. If you\r\nprefer to be inactive, you can lie still and placidly survey the\r\nscenery, rising occasionally to have a shot at a wild duck; at\r\nintervals reading, smoking, and sleeping. Sleep, indeed, you will enjoy\r\nmost luxuriously, for the rapid bounding motion of the canoe as it leaps\r\nforward at every impulse of the crew, the sharp quick beat of the\r\npaddles on the water, and the roll of their shafts against the gunwale,\r\nwith the continuous hiss and ripple of the stream cleft by the curving\r\nprow, combine to make a most soothing soporific.\r\n\r\nDreamily you lie side by side--you and your friend--lazily gazing at the\r\npine-covered shores and wooded islands of some unknown lake, the open\r\nbook unheeded on your knee; the half-smoked pipe drops into your lap;\r\nyour head sinks gently back; and you wander into dreamland, to awake\r\npresently and find yourself sweeping round the curve of some majestic\r\nriver, whose shores are blazing with the rich crimson, brown, and gold\r\nof the maple and other hardwood trees in their autumn dress.\r\n\r\nPresently the current quickens. The best man shifts his place from the\r\nstern to the bow, and stands ready with his long-handled paddle to twist\r\nthe frail boat out of reach of hidden rocks. The men\'s faces glow with\r\nexcitement. Quicker and quicker flows the stream, breaking into little\r\nrapids, foaming round rocks, and rising in tumbling waves over the\r\nshallows. At a word from the bowman the crew redouble their efforts, the\r\npaddle shafts crash against the gunwale, the spray flies beneath the\r\nbending blades. The canoe shakes and quivers through all its fibres,\r\nleaping bodily at every stroke.\r\n\r\nBefore you is a seething mass of foam, its whiteness broken by horrid\r\nblack rocks, one touch against whose jagged sides would rip the canoe\r\ninto tatters and hurl you into eternity. Your ears are full of the roar\r\nof waters; waves leap up in all directions, as the river, maddened at\r\nobstruction, hurls itself through some narrow gorge. The bowman stands\r\nerect to take one look in silence, noting in that critical instant the\r\nline of deepest water; then bending to his work, with sharp, short words\r\nof command to the steersman, he directs the boat. The canoe seems to\r\npitch headlong into space. Whack! comes a great wave over the bow;\r\ncrash! comes another over the side. The bowman, his figure stooped, and\r\nhis knees planted firmly against the sides, stands, with paddle poised\r\nin both hands, screaming to the crew to paddle hard; and the crew cheer\r\nand shout with excitement in return. You, too, get wild, and feel\r\ninclined to yell defiance to the roaring, hissing flood that madly\r\ndashes you from side to side. After the first plunge you are in a\r\nbewildering whirl of waters. The shore seems to fly past you. Crash! You\r\nare right on that rock, and (I don\'t care who you are) you will feel\r\nyour heart jump into your mouth, and you will catch the side with a grip\r\nthat leaves a mark on your fingers afterwards. No! With a shriek of\r\ncommand to the steersman, and a plunge of his paddle, the bowman\r\nwrenches the canoe out of its course. Another stroke or two, another\r\nplunge forward, and with a loud exulting yell from the bowman, who\r\nflourishes his paddle round his head, you pitch headlong down the final\r\nleap, and with a grunt of relief from the straining crew glide rapidly\r\ninto still water.\r\n\r\nLord Dunraven: "The Great Divide."\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PARLIAMENT BUILDINGS.

A\r\nlady looked out of a bow-window where some fowls and joints of meat were\r\nhanging up, and said:\r\n\r\n"Is that the little gentleman from Blunder-stone?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, ma\'am," I said.\r\n\r\nThe lady then rang a bell and called out: "William! show the\r\ncoffee-room!" upon which a waiter came running out of a kitchen on the\r\nopposite side of the yard to show it, and seemed a good deal surprised\r\nwhen he found he was only to show it to me.\r\n\r\nIt was a large, long room with some large maps in it. I doubt if I could\r\nhave felt much stranger if the maps had been real foreign countries, and\r\nI cast away in the middle of them. I felt it was taking a liberty to sit\r\ndown, with my cap in my hand, on the corner of the chair nearest the\r\ndoor; and when the waiter laid a cloth on purpose for me, and put a set\r\nof casters on it, I think I must have turned red all over with modesty.\r\n\r\nHe brought me some chops, and vegetables, and took the covers off in\r\nsuch a bouncing manner that I was afraid I must have given him some\r\noffence. But he greatly relieved my mind by putting a chair for me at\r\nthe table, and saying, very affably: "Now, six-foot! come on!"\r\n\r\nI thanked him, and took my seat at the board; but found it extremely\r\ndifficult to handle my knife and fork with anything like dexterity, or\r\nto avoid splashing myself with the gravy, while he was standing\r\nopposite, staring so hard, and making me blush in the most dreadful\r\nmanner every time I caught his eye. After watching me into the second\r\nchop, he said:\r\n\r\n"There\'s half a pint of ale for you. Will you have it now?"\r\n\r\nI thanked him and said "Yes." Upon which he poured it out of a jug into\r\na large tumbler, and held it up against the light, and made it look\r\nbeautiful.\r\n\r\n"My eye!" he said. "It seems a good deal, don\'t it?"\r\n\r\n"It does seem a good deal," I answered with a smile. For it was quite\r\ndelightful to me to find him so pleasant. He was a twinkling-eyed,\r\npimple-faced man, with his hair standing upright all over his head; and\r\nas he stood with one arm a-kimbo, holding up the glass to the light with\r\nthe other hand, he looked quite friendly.\r\n\r\n"There was a gentleman here, yesterday," he said--"a stout gentleman, by\r\nthe name of Topsawyer--perhaps you know him."\r\n\r\n"No," I said, "I don\'t think--"\r\n\r\n"In breeches and gaiters, broad-brimmed hat, gray coat, speckled\r\nchoker," said the waiter.\r\n\r\n"No," I said, bashfully, "I haven\'t the pleasure--"\r\n\r\n"He came in here," said the waiter, looking at the light through the\r\ntumbler, "ordered a glass of this ale--_would_ order it--I told him\r\nnot--drank it, and fell dead. It was too old for him. It oughtn\'t to be\r\ndrawn; that\'s the fact."\r\n\r\nI was very much shocked to hear of this melancholy accident, and said I\r\nthought I had better have some water.\r\n\r\n"Why, you see," said the waiter, still looking at the light through the\r\ntumbler, with one of his eyes shut up, "our people don\'t like things\r\nbeing ordered and left. It offends \'em. But _I\'ll_ drink it, if you\r\nlike. I\'m used to it, and use is everything. I don\'t think it\'ll hurt\r\nme, if I throw my head back, and take it off quick. Shall I?"\r\n\r\nI replied that he would much oblige me by drinking it, if he thought he\r\ncould do it safely, but by no means otherwise. When he did throw his\r\nhead back and take it off quick, I had a horrible fear, I confess, of\r\nseeing him meet the fate of the lamented Mr. Topsawyer, and fall\r\nlifeless on the carpet. But it didn\'t hurt him. On the contrary, I\r\nthought he seemed the fresher for it.\r\n\r\n"What have we got here?" he said, putting a fork into my dish. "Not\r\nchops?"\r\n\r\n"Chops," I said.\r\n\r\n"Bless my soul!" he exclaimed, "I didn\'t know they were chops. Why, a\r\nchop\'s the very thing to take off the bad effects of that beer! Ain\'t it\r\nlucky?"\r\n\r\nSo he took a chop by the bone in one hand, and a potato in the other,\r\nand ate away with a very good appetite, to my extreme satisfaction. He\r\nafterwards took another chop, and another potato; and after that another\r\nchop, and another potato. When he had done, he brought me a pudding, and\r\nhaving set it before me, seemed to ruminate, and to become absent in his\r\nmind for some moments.\r\n\r\n"How\'s the pie?" he said, rousing himself.\r\n\r\n"It\'s a pudding," I made answer.\r\n\r\n"Pudding!" he exclaimed. "Why, bless me, so it is! What!" looking at it\r\nnearer. "You don\'t mean to say it\'s a batter-pudding?"\r\n\r\n"Yes, it is indeed."\r\n\r\n"Why, a batter-pudding," he said, taking up a table-spoon, "it\'s my\r\nfavourite pudding! Ain\'t that lucky? Come on, little \'un, and let\'s see\r\nwho\'ll get most."\r\n\r\nThe waiter certainly got most. He entreated me more than once to come in\r\nand win, but what with his table-spoon to my tea-spoon, his despatch to\r\nmy despatch, and his appetite to my appetite, I was left far behind at\r\nthe first mouthful, and had no chance with him. I never saw any one\r\nenjoy a pudding so much, I think; and he laughed, when it was all gone,\r\nas if his enjoyment of it lasted still.\r\n\r\nFinding him so very friendly and companionable, it was then that I asked\r\nfor the pen and ink and paper, to write to Peggoty. He not only brought\r\nit immediately, but was good enough to look over me while I wrote the\r\nletter. When I had finished it, he asked me where I was going to school.\r\n\r\nI said: "Near London," which was all I knew.\r\n\r\n"Oh! my eye!" he said, looking very low-spirited, "I am sorry for that."\r\n\r\n"Why?" I asked him.\r\n\r\n"Oh!" he said, shaking his head, "that\'s the school where they broke the\r\nboy\'s ribs--two ribs--a little boy he was. I should say he was--let me\r\nsee--how old are you, about?"\r\n\r\nI told him between eight and nine.\r\n\r\n"That\'s just his age," he said. "He was eight years and six months old\r\nwhen they broke his first rib; eight years and eight months old when\r\nthey broke his second, and did for him."\r\n\r\nI could not disguise from myself, or from the waiter, that this was an\r\nuncomfortable coincidence, and inquired how it was done. His answer was\r\nnot cheering to my spirits, for it consisted of two dismal words, "With\r\nwhopping."\r\n\r\nThe blowing of the coach-horn in the yard was a seasonable diversion,\r\nwhich made me get up and hesitatingly inquire, in the mingled pride and\r\ndiffidence of having a purse (which I took out of my pocket), if there\r\nwere anything to pay.\r\n\r\n"There\'s a sheet of letter-paper," he returned. "Did you ever buy a\r\nsheet of letter-paper?"\r\n\r\nI could not remember that I ever had.\r\n\r\n"It\'s dear," he said, "on account of the duty. Threepence. That\'s the\r\nway we\'re taxed in this country. There\'s nothing else, except the\r\nwaiter. Never mind the ink! _I_ lose by that."\r\n\r\n"What should you--what should I--how much ought I to--what would it be\r\nright to pay the waiter, if you please?" I stammered, blushing.\r\n\r\n"If I hadn\'t a family, and that family hadn\'t the cowpock," said the\r\nwaiter, "I wouldn\'t take a sixpence. If I didn\'t support a aged pairint,\r\nand a lovely sister,"--here the waiter was greatly agitated--"I wouldn\'t\r\ntake a farthing. If I had a good place, and was treated well here, I\r\nshould beg acceptance of a trifle, instead of taking of it. But I live\r\non broken wittles--and I sleep on the coals"--here the waiter burst into\r\ntears.\r\n\r\nI was very much concerned for his misfortunes, and felt that any\r\nrecognition short of ninepence would be mere brutality and hardness of\r\nheart, Therefore I gave him one of my three bright shillings, which he\r\nreceived with much humility and veneration, and spun up with his thumb,\r\ndirectly afterwards, to try the goodness of.\r\n\r\nIt was a little disconcerting to me, to find, when I was being helped up\r\nbehind the coach, that I was supposed to have eaten all the dinner\r\nwithout any assistance. I discovered this, from overhearing the lady in\r\nthe bow-window say to the guard: "Take care of that child, George, or\r\nhe\'ll burst!" and from observing that the women-servants who were about\r\nthe place came out to look and giggle at me as a young phenomenon. My\r\nunfortunate friend, the waiter, who had quite recovered his spirits, did\r\nnot appear to be disturbed by this, but joined in the general admiration\r\nwithout being at all confused. If I had any doubt of him, I suppose this\r\nhalf-awakened it; but I am inclined to believe that, with the simple\r\nconfidence and natural reliance of a child upon superior years\r\n(qualities I am very sorry any children should prematurely change for\r\nworldly wisdom), I had no serious mistrust of him on the whole, even\r\nthen.\r\n\r\nDickens: "David Copperfield."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BAREFOOT BOY\r\n\r\n\r\n    Blessings on thee, little man,\r\n    Barefoot boy, with cheek of tan!\r\n    With thy turned-up pantaloons,\r\n    And thy merry whistled tunes;\r\n    With thy red lip, redder still\r\n    Kissed by strawberries on the hill;\r\n    With the sunshine on thy face,\r\n    Through thy torn brim\'s jaunty grace;\r\n    From my heart I give thee joy,--\r\n    I was once a barefoot boy!\r\n    Prince thou art,--the grown-up man\r\n    Only is republican.\r\n    Let the million-dollared ride!\r\n    Barefoot, trudging at his side,\r\n    Thou hast more than he can buy\r\n    In the reach of ear and eye,--\r\n    Outward sunshine, inward joy;\r\n    Blessings on thee, barefoot boy!\r\n\r\n    Oh for boyhood\'s painless play,\r\n    Sleep that wakes in laughing day,\r\n    Health that mocks the doctor\'s rules,\r\n    Knowledge never learned of schools,\r\n    Of the wild bee\'s morning chase,\r\n    Of the wild-flower\'s time and place,\r\n    Flight of fowl and habitude\r\n    Of the tenants of the wood;\r\n    How the tortoise bears his shell,\r\n    How the woodchuck digs his cell,\r\n    And the ground-mole sinks his well;\r\n    How the robin feeds her young,\r\n    How the oriole\'s nest is hung;\r\n    Where the whitest lilies blow,\r\n    Where the freshest berries grow,\r\n    Where the ground-nut trails its vine,\r\n    Where the wood-grape\'s clusters shine;\r\n    Of the black wasp\'s cunning way,\r\n    Mason of his walls of clay,\r\n    And the architectural plans\r\n    Of gray hornet artisans!--\r\n    For, eschewing books and tasks,\r\n    Nature answers all he asks;\r\n    Hand in hand with her he walks,\r\n    Face to face with her he talks,\r\n    Part and parcel of her joy,--\r\n    Blessings on the barefoot boy!\r\n\r\n    Oh for boyhood\'s time of June,\r\n    Crowding years in one brief moon,\r\n    When all things I heard or saw,\r\n    Me, their master, waited for.\r\n    I was rich in flowers and trees,\r\n    Humming-birds and honey-bees;\r\n    For my sport the squirrel played,\r\n    Plied the snouted mole his spade;\r\n    For my taste the blackberry cone\r\n    Purpled over hedge and stone;\r\n    Laughed the brook for my delight\r\n    Through the day and through the night,\r\n    Whispering at the garden wall,\r\n    Talked with me from fall to fall,\r\n    Mine the sand-rimmed pickerel pond,\r\n    Mine the walnut slopes beyond,\r\n    Mine, on bending orchard trees,\r\n    Apples of Hesperides!\r\n    Still, as my horizon grew,\r\n    Larger grew my riches, too;\r\n    All the world I saw or knew\r\n    Seemed a complex Chinese toy,\r\n    Fashioned for a barefoot boy!\r\n\r\n    Oh for festal dainties spread,\r\n    Like my bowl of milk and bread;--\r\n    Pewter spoon and bowl of wood,\r\n    On the door-stone, gray and rude!\r\n    O\'er me, like a regal tent,\r\n    Cloudy-ribbed, the sunset bent,\r\n    Purple-curtained, fringed with gold,\r\n    Looped in many a wind-swung fold;\r\n    While for music came the play\r\n    Of the pied frogs\' orchestra;\r\n    And, to light the noisy choir,\r\n    Lit the fly his lamp of fire.\r\n    I was monarch: pomp and joy\r\n    Waited on the barefoot boy!\r\n\r\n    Cheerily, then, my little man,\r\n    Live and laugh, as boyhood can!\r\n    Though the flinty slopes be hard,\r\n    Stubble-speared the new-mown sward,\r\n    Every morn shall lead thee through\r\n    Fresh baptisms of the dew;\r\n    Every evening from thy feet\r\n    Shall the cool wind kiss the heat;\r\n    All too soon these feet must hide\r\n    In the prison cells of pride,\r\n    Lose the freedom of the sod,\r\n    Like a colt\'s for work be shod,\r\n    Made to tread the mills of toil,\r\n    Up and down in ceaseless moil;\r\n    Happy if their track be found\r\n    Never on forbidden ground;\r\n    Happy if they sink not in\r\n    Quick and treacherous sands of sin.\r\n    Ah! that thou couldst know thy joy,\r\n    Ere it passes, barefoot boy!\r\n\r\nWhittier\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PARLIAMENT BUILDINGS. OTTAWA]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOUNTRY LIFE IN CANADA IN THE "THIRTIES"\r\n\r\n\r\nCountry life in Western Canada in the "Thirties" was very simple and\r\nuneventful. There were no lines of social division such as now exist.\r\nAll alike had to toil to win and maintain a home; and if, as was\r\nnatural, some were more successful in the rough battle of pioneer life\r\nthan others, they did not feel, on that account, disposed to treat their\r\nneighbours as their inferiors. Neighbours, they well knew, were too few\r\nand too desirable to be coldly and haughtily treated. Had not all the\r\nmembers of each community hewn their way side by side into the\r\nfastnesses of the Canadian bush? And what could a little additional\r\nwealth do for them, when the remoteness of the centres which might\r\nsupply luxuries, enforced simplicity and made superfluities almost\r\nimpossible?\r\n\r\nThe furnishings of their houses were plain, and the chief articles of\r\ndress, if substantial and comfortable, were of coarse homespun--the\r\nproduct of their own labour. The sources of amusement were limited. The\r\nday of the harmonium or piano had not come. Music, except in its\r\nsimplest vocal form, was not cultivated; only the occasional presence of\r\nsome fiddler afforded rare seasons of merriment to the delight both of\r\nold and young.\r\n\r\nThe motto of "Early to bed and early to rise" was, even in winter, the\r\nstrict rule of family life. In the morning all were up, and breakfast\r\nwas over usually before seven. As soon as the gray light of dawn\r\nappeared, men and boys were off to the barns, not merely to feed the\r\ncattle but to engage in the needful and tedious labour of threshing by\r\nhand. In the evenings, the family gathered together for lighter tasks\r\nand pleasant talk around a glowing fire. In firewood, at least, there\r\nwas, in those days, no need for economy.\r\n\r\nWe scarcely realize how largely little things may contribute to\r\nconvenience and comfort. There were no lucifer matches at that date. It\r\nwas needful to cover up carefully the live coals on the hearth before\r\ngoing to bed, so that there might be the means of starting the fire in\r\nthe morning. This precaution was rarely unsuccessful; but sometimes a\r\nmember of the family had to set out for a supply of fire from a\r\nneighbour\'s, in order that breakfast might be prepared. I remember well\r\nhaving to crawl out of my warm nest and run through the keen frosty air\r\nfor half a mile or more, to fetch live coals from a neighbour\'s. It was,\r\nhowever, my father\'s practice to keep bundles of finely split pine\r\nsticks tipped with brimstone. With the aid of these, the merest spark\r\nserved to start the fire.\r\n\r\nIn the spring, tasks of various kinds crowded rapidly upon us. The hams\r\nand beef that had been salted down in casks during the preceding autumn\r\nwere taken out of the brine, washed off, and hung in the smoke-house. On\r\nthe earthen floor beech or maple was burned; the oily smoke, given off\r\nby the combustion of these woods in a confined space, not only acted as\r\na preservative but also lent a special flavour to the meat. Then\r\nploughing, fencing, sowing, and planting followed in quick succession.\r\nNo hands could be spared. The children must drive the cows to and from\r\npasture. They must also take a hand at churning. It was a weary task, I\r\nwell remember, to stand, perhaps for an hour, and drive the dasher up\r\nand down through the thick cream. How often did we examine the handle\r\nfor evidence that the butter was forming, and what was the relief when\r\nthe monotonous task was at an end. As soon as my legs were long enough,\r\nI had to follow a team; indeed, I drove the horses, mounted on the back\r\nof one of them, when my nether limbs were scarcely sufficiently grown to\r\ngive me a grip.\r\n\r\nThe instruments for the agricultural operations were few and rough. Iron\r\nploughs with cast-iron mould-boards and shares were commonly employed.\r\nCompared with our modern ploughs, they were clumsy things, but a vast\r\nimprovement on the earlier wooden ploughs which, even at that date, had\r\nnot wholly gone out of use. For drags, tree-tops were frequently used.\r\n\r\nIn June came sheep-washing. The sheep were driven to the bay shore and\r\nsecured in a pen. One by one they were taken out, and the fleeces\r\ncarefully washed. Within a day or two, shearing followed in the barn.\r\nThe wool was sorted; some was reserved to be carded by hand; the\r\nremainder was sent to the mills to be turned into rolls. Then, day after\r\nday, for weeks, the noise of the spinning-wheel was heard, accompanied\r\nby the steady beat of the girls\' feet, as they walked forward and\r\nbackward drawing out and twisting the thread and running it on the\r\nspindle. This was work that required some skill, for on the fineness and\r\nevenness of the thread the character of the fabric largely depended.\r\nFinally, the yarn was carried to the weavers to be converted into cloth.\r\n\r\nThe women of the family found their hands very full in the "Thirties."\r\nBesides the daily round of housewifely cares, every season brought its\r\nspecial duties. There were wild strawberries and raspberries to be\r\npicked and prepared for daily consumption, or to be preserved for winter\r\nuse. Besides milking, there was the making both of butter and cheese.\r\nThere was no nurse to take care of the children, no cook to prepare the\r\ndinner. To be sure, in households when the work was beyond the powers of\r\nthe family, the daughter of some neighbour might come as a helper.\r\nThough hired, she was treated in all respects as one of the family, and\r\nin return was likely to take the same sort of interest in the work, as\r\nif the tie that bound her to the family was closer than wages. In truth,\r\nsuch help was regarded as a favour, and not as in any way affecting the\r\ngirl\'s social position.\r\n\r\nThe girls in those days were more at home in a kitchen than a\r\ndrawing-room. They did better execution at a tub than at a spinet, and\r\ncould handle a rolling-pin more satisfactorily than a sketch-book. At a\r\npinch, they could even use a rake or fork to good purpose in field or\r\nbarn. Their finishing education was received at the country school along\r\nwith their brothers. Of fashion books and milliners, few of them had any\r\nexperiences.\r\n\r\nCountry life in Canada was plodding in the "Thirties" and there was no\r\nvaried outlook. The girls\' training for future life was mainly at the\r\nhands of their mothers; the boys followed in the footsteps of their\r\nfathers. Neither sex felt that life was cramped or burdensome on that\r\naccount. They were content to live as their parents had done. And though\r\nwe can see that, as compared with later conditions, there may be\r\nsomething wanting in such an existence, this at least we know, that, in\r\nsuch a school and by such masters, the foundations of Canadian character\r\nand prosperity were laid.\r\n\r\nCanniff Haight: "Country Life in Canada in the \'Thirties\'."\r\n(Adapted)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHe who knows most grieves most for wasted time.\r\n\r\nDante\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHEAT\r\n\r\n\r\n    From plains that reel to southward, dim,\r\n      The road runs by me white and bare;\r\n    Up the steep hill it seems to swim\r\n      Beyond, and melt into the glare.\r\n    Upward half-way, or it may be\r\n      Nearer the summit, slowly steals\r\n    A hay-cart, moving dustily\r\n      With idly clacking wheels.\r\n\r\n    By his cart\'s side the wagoner\r\n      Is slouching slowly at his ease,\r\n    Half-hidden in the windless blur\r\n      Of white dust puffing to his knees.\r\n    This wagon on the height above,\r\n      From sky to sky on either hand,\r\n    Is the sole thing that seems to move\r\n      In all the heat-held land.\r\n\r\n    Beyond me in the fields the sun\r\n      Soaks in the grass and hath his will;\r\n    I count the marguerites one by one;\r\n      Even the buttercups are still.\r\n    On the brook yonder not a breath\r\n      Disturbs the spider or the midge.\r\n    The water-bugs draw close beneath\r\n      The cool gloom of the bridge.\r\n\r\n    Where the far elm-tree shadows flood\r\n      Dark patches in the burning grass,\r\n    The cows, each with her peaceful cud,\r\n      Lie waiting for the heat to pass.\r\n    From somewhere on the slope near by\r\n      Into the pale depths of the noon\r\n    A wandering thrush slides leisurely\r\n      His thin revolving tune.\r\n\r\n    In intervals of dreams I hear\r\n      The cricket from the droughty ground;\r\n    The grasshoppers spin into mine ear\r\n      A small innumerable sound.\r\n    I lift mine eyes sometimes to gaze:\r\n      The burning sky-line blinds my sight:\r\n    The woods far off are blue with haze:\r\n      The hills are drenched in light.\r\n\r\n    And yet to me not this or that\r\n      Is always sharp or always sweet;\r\n    In the sloped shadow of my hat\r\n      I lean at rest, and drain the heat;\r\n    Nay more, I think some bless\xc3\xa8d power\r\n      Hath brought me wandering idly here:\r\n    In the full furnace of this hour\r\n      My thoughts grow keen and clear.\r\n\r\nArchibald Lampman\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TWO PATHS\r\n\r\n\r\n    Hear, O my son, and receive my sayings;\r\n    And the years of thy life shall be many.\r\n    I have taught thee in the way of wisdom;\r\n    I have led thee in paths of uprightness.\r\n    When thou goest, thy steps shall not be straitened;\r\n    And if thou runnest, thou shalt not stumble.\r\n          Take fast hold of instruction;\r\n          Let her not go:\r\n          Keep her;\r\n          For she is thy life.\r\n\r\n    Enter not into the Path of the Wicked,\r\n    And walk not in the way of evil men.\r\n          Avoid it,\r\n          Pass not by it;\r\n          Turn from it,\r\n          And pass on.\r\n    For they sleep not, except they have done mischief;\r\n    And their sleep is taken away, unless they cause some to fall.\r\n    For they eat the bread of wickedness,\r\n    And drink the wine of violence.\r\n\r\n    But the Path of the Righteous is as the light of dawn,\r\n    That shineth more and more unto the perfect day.\r\n    The way of the wicked is as darkness:\r\n    They know not at what they stumble.\r\n\r\nProverbs, IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBERNARDO DEL CARPIO\r\n\r\n(The Spanish champion, Bernardo del Carpio, having made many ineffectual\r\nefforts to procure the release of his father, the Count Saldana, who had\r\nbeen imprisoned by King Alfonso, at last took up arms. The war proved so\r\ndestructive that the people demanded of the King, Saldana\'s liberty.\r\nAlfonso offered Bernardo possession of his father\'s person in exchange\r\nfor his castle. Bernardo accepted the offer, gave up his castle, and\r\nrode forth with the king to meet his father.)\r\n\r\n\r\n    The warrior bowed his crested head, and\r\n      tamed his heart of fire,\r\n    And sued the haughty king to free his\r\n      long-imprisoned sire:\r\n    "I bring thee here my fortress keys, I\r\n      bring my captive train,\r\n    I pledge thee faith, my liege, my lord!--oh,\r\n      break my father\'s chain!"\r\n\r\n    "Rise, rise! even now thy father comes\r\n      a ransomed man this day:\r\n    Mount thy good horse, and thou and I will\r\n      meet him on his way."\r\n    Then lightly rose that loyal son, and\r\n      bounded on his steed,\r\n    And urged, as if with lance in rest, the\r\n      charger\'s foamy speed.\r\n\r\n    And lo! from far, as on they pressed, there\r\n      came a glittering band,\r\n    With one that midst them stately rode, as\r\n      a leader in the land;\r\n    "Now haste, Bernardo, haste! for there,\r\n      in very truth, is he,\r\n    The father whom thy faithful heart hath\r\n      yearned so long to see."\r\n\r\n    His dark eye flashed, his proud breast\r\n      heaved, his cheek\'s blood came and went,\r\n    He reached that gray-haired chieftain\'s\r\n      side, and there, dismounting, bent:\r\n    A lowly knee to earth he bent, his father\'s\r\n      hand he took,--\r\n    What was there in its touch that all his\r\n      fiery spirit shook?\r\n\r\n    That hand was cold--a frozen thing--it\r\n      dropped from his like lead:\r\n    He looked up to the face above--the face\r\n      was of the dead!\r\n    A plume waved o\'er the noble brow--the\r\n      brow was fixed and white;\r\n    He met at last his father\'s eyes--but in\r\n      them was no sight!\r\n\r\n    Up from the ground he sprang, and gazed,\r\n      but who could paint that gaze?\r\n    They hushed their very hearts, that saw\r\n      its horror and amaze;\r\n    They might have chained him, as before\r\n      that stony form he stood,\r\n    For the power was stricken from his arm,\r\n      and from his lip the blood.\r\n\r\n    "Father!" at length he murmured low, and\r\n      wept like childhood, then--\r\n    Talk not of grief till thou hast seen\r\n      the tears of warlike men!--\r\n    He thought on all his glorious hopes,\r\n      and all his young renown,--\r\n    He flung the falchion from his side,\r\n      and in the dust sat down.\r\n\r\n    Then, covering with his steel-gloved\r\n      hands his darkly mournful brow,\r\n    "No more, there is no more," he said,\r\n      "to lift the sword for now.\r\n    My king is false, my hope betrayed, my\r\n      father--oh! the worth,\r\n    The glory and the loveliness, are passed\r\n      away from earth!\r\n\r\n    "I thought to stand where banners waved,\r\n      my sire! beside thee yet--\r\n    I would that _there_ our kindred\r\n      blood on Spain\'s free soil had met!\r\n    Thou wouldst have known my spirit then--for\r\n      thee my fields were won,--\r\n    And thou hast perished in thy chains, as\r\n      though thou hadst no son!"\r\n\r\n    Then, starting from the ground once more,\r\n      he seized the monarch\'s rein,\r\n    Amidst the pale and wildered looks of all\r\n      the courtier train;\r\n    And with a fierce, o\'ermastering grasp,\r\n      the rearing war-horse led,\r\n    And sternly set them face to face--the\r\n      king before the dead!--\r\n\r\n    "Came I not forth upon thy pledge, my\r\n      father\'s hand to kiss?--\r\n    Be still, and gaze thou on, false king!\r\n      and tell me what is this!\r\n    The voice, the glance, the heart I\r\n      sought--give answer, where are they?--\r\n    If thou wouldst clear thy perjured soul,\r\n      send life through this cold clay!\r\n\r\n    "Into these glassy eyes put light--be\r\n      still! keep down thine ire,--\r\n    Bid these white lips a blessing speak--this\r\n      earth is _not_ my sire!\r\n    Give me back him for whom I strove, for\r\n      whom my blood was shed,--\r\n    Thou canst not--and a king!

This\r\nat first I opposed stoutly; but it was as stoutly defended. However, as\r\nI weakened, my antagonists gained strength, till at last it was resolved\r\nto part with him.\r\n\r\nAs the fair happened on the following day, I had intentions of going\r\nmyself; but my wife persuaded me that I had got a cold, and nothing\r\ncould prevail upon her to permit me from home.\r\n\r\n"No, my dear," said she, "our son Moses is a discreet boy and can buy\r\nand sell to very good advantage; you know all our great bargains are of\r\nhis purchasing. He always stands out and higgles, and actually tires\r\nthem till he gets a bargain."\r\n\r\nAs I had some opinion of my son\'s prudence, I was willing enough to\r\nintrust him with this commission; and the next morning I perceived his\r\nsisters mighty busy in fitting out Moses for the fair--trimming his\r\nhair, brushing his buckles, and cocking his hat with pins.\r\n\r\nThe business of the toilet being over, we had at last the satisfaction\r\nof seeing him mounted upon the colt, with a deal box before him to bring\r\nhome groceries in. He had on a coat made of that cloth they call thunder\r\nand lightning, which, though grown too short, was much too good to be\r\nthrown away. His waistcoat was of gosling green, and his sisters had\r\ntied his hair with a broad black ribbon. We all followed him several\r\npaces from the door, bawling after him: "Good luck, good luck!" till we\r\ncould see him no longer.\r\n\r\nAs night came on, I began to wonder what could keep our son so long at\r\nthe fair.\r\n\r\n"Never mind our son," cried my wife, "depend upon it, he knows what he\r\nis about. I\'ll warrant we\'ll never see him sell his hen of a rainy day.\r\nI have seen him buy such bargains as would amaze one. I\'ll tell you a\r\ngood story about that, that will make you split your sides with\r\nlaughing. But, as I live, yonder comes Moses, without a horse, and the\r\nbox at his back."\r\n\r\nAs she spoke, Moses came slowly on foot, and sweating under the deal\r\nbox, which he had strapped round his shoulders like a pedlar.\r\n\r\n"Welcome, welcome, Moses; well, my boy, what have you brought us from\r\nthe fair?"\r\n\r\n"I have brought you myself," cried Moses, with a sly look, and resting\r\nthe box on the dresser.\r\n\r\n"Ah, Moses," cried my wife, "that we know, but where is the horse?"\r\n\r\n"I have sold him," cried Moses, "for three pounds, five shillings, and\r\ntwopence."\r\n\r\n"Well done, my good boy," returned she, "I knew you would touch them\r\noff. Between ourselves, three pounds, five shillings, and twopence is no\r\nbad day\'s work. Come, let us have it then."\r\n\r\n"I have brought back no money," cried Moses again. "I have laid it all\r\nout in a bargain, and here it is," pulling out a bundle from his breast:\r\n"here they are, a gross of green spectacles, with silver rims and\r\nshagreen cases."\r\n\r\n"A gross of green spectacles!" repeated my wife, in a faint voice. "And\r\nyou have parted with the colt and brought us back nothing but a gross of\r\ngreen paltry spectacles!"\r\n\r\n"Dear mother," cried the boy, "why won\'t you listen to reason? I had\r\nthem a dead bargain, or I should not have bought them. The silver rims\r\nwill sell for double the money."\r\n\r\n"A fig for the silver rims!" cried my wife, in a passion. "I dare swear\r\nthey won\'t sell for above half the money at the rate of broken silver,\r\nfive shillings an ounce."\r\n\r\n"You need be under no uneasiness," cried I, "about selling the rims; for\r\nthey are not worth sixpence, for I perceive they are only copper\r\nvarnished over."\r\n\r\n"What," cried my wife, "not silver, the rims not silver!"\r\n\r\n"No," cried I, "no more silver than your sauce-pan."\r\n\r\n"And so," returned she, "we have parted with the colt, and have only got\r\na gross of green spectacles, with copper rims and shagreen cases! A\r\nmurrain take such trumpery! The blockhead has been imposed upon, and\r\nshould have known his company better."\r\n\r\n"There, my dear," cried I, "you are wrong; he should not have known them\r\nat all."\r\n\r\n"Marry, hang the idiot," returned she, "to bring me such stuff; if I had\r\nthem, I would throw them into the fire."\r\n\r\n"There again you are wrong, my dear," cried I; "for though they be\r\ncopper, we will keep them by us, as copper spectacles, you know, are\r\nbetter than nothing."\r\n\r\nBy this time the unfortunate Moses was undeceived. He now saw that he\r\nhad been imposed upon by a prowling sharper, who, observing his figure,\r\nhad marked him for an easy prey. I therefore asked the circumstances of\r\nhis deception. He sold the horse, it seems, and walked the fair in\r\nsearch of another. A reverend-looking man brought him to a tent, under\r\npretence of having one to sell.\r\n\r\n"Here," continued Moses, "we met another man, very well dressed, who\r\ndesired to borrow twenty pounds upon these, saying that he wanted money\r\nand would dispose of them for a third of the value. The first gentleman,\r\nwho pretended to be my friend, whispered me to buy them, and cautioned\r\nme not to let so good an offer pass. I sent for Mr. Flamborough, and\r\nthey talked him up as finely as they did me, and so at last we were\r\npersuaded to buy the two gross between us."\r\n\r\nGoldsmith: "The Vicar of Wakefield."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAPLE\r\n\r\n\r\n    Oh, tenderly deepen the woodland glooms,\r\n      And merrily sway the beeches;\r\n    Breathe delicately the willow blooms,\r\n      And the pines rehearse new speeches;\r\n    The elms toss high till they reach the sky,\r\n      Pale catkins the yellow birch launches,\r\n    But the tree I love all the greenwood above\r\n      Is the maple of sunny branches.\r\n\r\n    Let who will sing of the hawthorn in spring,\r\n      Or the late-leaved linden in summer;\r\n    There\'s a word may be for the locust tree,\r\n      That delicate, strange new-comer;\r\n    But the maple it glows with the tint of the rose\r\n      When pale are the spring-time regions,\r\n    And its towers of flame from afar proclaim\r\n      The advance of Winter\'s legions.\r\n\r\n    And a greener shade there never was made\r\n      Than its summer canopy sifted,\r\n    And many a day, as beneath it I lay,\r\n      Has my memory backward drifted\r\n    To a pleasant lane I may walk not again,\r\n      Leading over a fresh, green hill,\r\n    Where a maple stood just clear of the wood--\r\n      And oh! to be near it still!\r\n\r\nCharles G.

It is worth looking at, for the world possesses not its equal.\r\nFour hundred English miles in length, one hundred and fifty miles in\r\nbreadth, six hundred feet above Atlantic level, nine hundred feet in\r\ndepth; one vast spring of purest crystal water, so cold that during\r\nsummer months its waters are like ice itself, and so clear that hundreds\r\nof feet below the surface the rocks stand out as distinctly as though\r\nseen through plate-glass. Follow in fancy the outpourings of this\r\nwonderful basin; seek its future course in Huron, Erie, and Ontario--in\r\nthat wild leap from the rocky ledge which makes Niagara famous through\r\nthe world. Seek it farther still--in the quiet loveliness of the\r\nThousand Isles, in the whirl and sweep of the Cedar Rapids, in the\r\nsilent rush of the great current under the rocks at the foot of Quebec.\r\nAy, and even farther away still--down where the lone Laurentian Hills\r\ncome forth to look again upon that water whose earliest beginnings they\r\ncradled along the shores of Lake Superior. There, close to the sounding\r\nbillows of the Atlantic, two thousand miles from Superior, these\r\nhills--the only ones that ever last--guard the great gate by which the\r\nSt. Lawrence seeks the sea.\r\n\r\nThere are rivers whose currents, running red with the silt and mud of\r\ntheir soft alluvial shores, carry far into the ocean the record of their\r\nmuddy progress; but this glorious river system, through its many lakes\r\nand various names, is ever the same crystal current, flowing pure from\r\nthe fountain-head of Lake Superior. Great cities stud its shores; but\r\nthey are powerless to dim the transparency of its waters. Steam-ships\r\ncover the broad bosom of its lakes and estuaries; but they change not\r\nthe beauty of the water, no more than the fleets of the world mark the\r\nwaves of the ocean. Any person looking at a map of the region bounding\r\nthe great lakes of North America will be struck by the absence of rivers\r\nflowing into Lakes Superior, Michigan, or Huron, from the south--in\r\nfact, the drainage of the States bordering these lakes on the south is\r\naltogether carried off by the valley of the Mississippi. It follows that\r\nthis valley of the Mississippi is at a much lower level than the surface\r\nof the lakes. These lakes, containing an area of some seventy-three\r\nthousand square miles, are therefore an immense reservoir held high over\r\nthe level of the great Mississippi valley, from which they are separated\r\nby a barrier of slight elevation and extent.\r\n\r\nMajor W. F. Butler: "The Great Lone Land."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RED RIVER PLAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe plain through which Red River flows is fertile beyond description.\r\nAt a little distance it seems one vast level plain, through which the\r\nwindings of the river are marked by a dark line of woods fringing the\r\nwhole length of the stream. Each tributary has also its line of\r\nforest,--a line visible many miles away over the great sea of grass. As\r\none travels on, there first rise above the prairie the tops of the\r\ntrees; these gradually grow larger, until finally, after many hours, the\r\nriver is reached. Nothing else breaks the uniform level. Standing upon\r\nthe ground, the eye ranges over many miles of grass; standing on a\r\nwagon, one doubles the area of vision; and to look over the plains from\r\nan elevation of twelve feet above the earth, is to survey at a glance a\r\nspace so vast that distance alone seems to bound its limits. The effect\r\nof sunset over these oceans of verdure is very beautiful. A thousand\r\nhues spread themselves upon the grassy plains, a thousand tints of gold\r\nare cast along the heavens, and the two oceans of the sky and of the\r\nearth intermingle in one great blaze of glory at the very gates of the\r\nsetting sun. But to speak of sunsets now is only to anticipate. Here, at\r\nthe Red River, we are only at the threshold of the sunset; its true home\r\nlies yet many days\' journey to the west--there, where the long shadows\r\nof the vast herds of bison (used to) trail slowly over the immense\r\nplains, huge and dark against the golden west--there, where the red man\r\nstill sees, in the glory of the setting sun, the realization of his\r\ndream of heaven.\r\n\r\nMajor W. F. Butler: "The Great Lone Land."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAs every action is capable of a peculiar dignity in the manner of it, so\r\nalso it is capable of dignity still higher in the motive of it. There is\r\nno action so slight, nor so mean, but it may be done to a great purpose,\r\nand ennobled therefore; nor is any purpose so great but that slight\r\nactions may help it, and may be so done as to help it much, most\r\nespecially that chief of all purposes, the pleasing of God.\r\n\r\nRuskin\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNNAMED LAKE\r\n\r\n\r\n    It sleeps among the thousand hills\r\n      Where no man ever trod,\r\n    And only nature\'s music fills\r\n      The silences of God.\r\n\r\n    Great mountains tower above its shore,\r\n      Green rushes fringe its brim,\r\n    And o\'er its breast for evermore\r\n      The wanton breezes skim.\r\n\r\n    Dark clouds that intercept the sun\r\n      Go there in Spring to weep,\r\n    And there, when Autumn days are done,\r\n      White mists lie down to sleep.\r\n\r\n    Sunrise and sunset crown with gold\r\n      The peaks of ageless stone,\r\n    Where winds have thundered from of old\r\n      And storms have set their throne.\r\n\r\n    No echoes of the world afar\r\n      Disturb it night or day,\r\n    But sun and shadow, moon and star,\r\n      Pass and repass for aye.\r\n\r\n    \'Twas in the gray of early dawn\r\n      When first the lake we spied,\r\n    And fragments of a cloud were drawn\r\n      Half down the mountain side.\r\n\r\n    Along the shore a heron flew,\r\n      And from a speck on high,\r\n    That hovered in the deepening blue,\r\n      We heard the fish-hawk\'s cry.\r\n\r\n    Among the cloud-capt solitudes,\r\n      No sound the silence broke,\r\n    Save when, in whispers down the woods,\r\n      The guardian mountains spoke.\r\n\r\n    Through tangled brush and dewy brake,\r\n      Returning whence we came,\r\n    We passed in silence, and the lake\r\n      We left without a name.\r\n\r\nF.

Beauty gave way to the needs of safety. Girdled with a green\r\nand slimy ditch, round the inner side of which ran a parapeted wall\r\npierced along the top with shot-holes, stood the buildings, spreading\r\noften over many acres.\r\n\r\nIf an enemy managed to cross the moat and force the gateway, in spite of\r\na portcullis crashing from above, and melted lead pouring in burning\r\nstreams from the perforated top of the rounded arch, but little of his\r\nwork was yet done; for the keep lifted its huge angular block of masonry\r\nwithin the inner bailey or courtyard, and from the narrow chinks in its\r\nten-foot wall rained a sharp incessant shower of arrows, sweeping all\r\napproaches to the high and narrow stair, by which alone access could be\r\nhad to its interior.\r\n\r\nThese loopholes were the only windows, except in the topmost story,\r\nwhere the chieftain, like a vulture in his rocky nest, watched all the\r\nsurrounding country. The day of splendid oriels had not yet come in\r\ncastle architecture. Thus a baron in his keep could defy, and often did\r\ndefy, the king upon his throne. Under his roof, eating daily at his\r\nboard, lived a throng of armed retainers; and around his castle lay\r\nfarms tilled by martial franklins, who at his call laid aside their\r\nimplements of husbandry, took up the sword and spear, which they could\r\nwield with equal skill, and marched beneath his banner to the war.\r\n\r\nThe furniture of a Norman keep was not unlike that of an English house.\r\nThere was richer ornament--more elaborate carving. A _faldestol_, the\r\noriginal of our arm-chair, spread its drapery and cushions for the\r\nchieftain in his lounging moods. His bed now boasted curtains and a\r\nroof, although, like the English lord, he still lay only upon straw.\r\nChimneys tunnelled the thick walls, and the cupboards glittered with\r\nglass and silver. Horn lanterns and the old spiked candle-sticks lit up\r\nhis evening hours, when the chess-board arrayed its clumsy men, carved\r\nout of walrus-tusk, then commonly called whale\'s-bone. But the baron had\r\nan unpleasant trick of breaking the chess-board on his opponent\'s head,\r\nwhen he found himself checkmated; which somewhat marred that player\'s\r\nenjoyment of the game. Dice of horn and bone emptied many a purse in\r\nNorman England. Draughts were also sometimes played.\r\n\r\nDance and music whiled away the long winter nights; and on summer\r\nevenings the castle courtyards resounded with the noise of football,\r\nwrestling, boxing, leaping, and the fierce joys of the bull-bait. But\r\nout of doors, when no fighting was on hand, the hound, the hawk, and the\r\nlance attracted the best energies and skill of the Norman gentleman.\r\n\r\nThe Normans probably dined at nine in the morning. When they rose they\r\ntook a light meal; and ate something also after their day\'s work,\r\nimmediately before going to bed. Goose and garlic formed a favourite\r\ndish. Their cookery was more elaborate, and, in comparison, more\r\ndelicate, than the preparations for an English feast; but the character\r\nfor temperance, which they brought with them from the continent, soon\r\nvanished.\r\n\r\nThe poorer classes hardly ever ate flesh, living principally on bread,\r\nbutter, and cheese; a fact in social life which seems to underlie that\r\nusage of our tongue by which the living animals in field or stall bore\r\nEnglish names--ox, sheep, calf, pig, deer; while their flesh, promoted\r\nto Norman dishes, rejoiced in names of French origin--beef, mutton,\r\nveal, pork, venison. Round cakes, piously marked with a cross, piled the\r\ntables, on which pastry of various kinds also appeared. In good houses\r\ncups of glass held the wine, which was borne from the cellar below in\r\njugs.\r\n\r\nSquatted around the door or on the stairs leading to the Norman\r\ndining-hall, which was often on an upper floor, was a crowd of beggars\r\nor gluttons, who grew so insolent in the days of Rufus, that ushers,\r\narmed with rods, were posted outside to beat back the noisy throng, who\r\nthought little of snatching the dishes as the cooks carried them to\r\ntable!\r\n\r\nThe juggler, who under the Normans filled the place of the English\r\ngleeman, tumbled, sang, and balanced knives in the hall; or, out in the\r\nbailey of an afternoon, displayed the acquirements of his trained monkey\r\nor bear. The fool, too, clad in coloured patchwork, cracked his ribald\r\njests and shook his cap and bells at the elbow of roaring barons, when\r\nthe board was spread and the circling of the wine began.\r\n\r\nMonasteries served many useful purposes at this time. Besides their\r\nmanifest value as centres of study and literary work, they gave alms to\r\nthe poor, a supper and a bed to travellers; their tenants were better\r\noff and better treated than the tenants of the nobles; the monks could\r\nstore grain, grow apples, and cultivate their flower-beds with little\r\nrisk of injury from war, because they had spiritual penalties at their\r\ncall, which usually awed even the most reckless of the soldiery into a\r\nrespect for sacred property.\r\n\r\nAs schools, too, the monasteries did no trifling service to society in\r\nthe Middle Ages. In addition to their influence as great centres of\r\nlearning, English law had enjoined every mass-priest to keep a school in\r\nhis parish church where all the young committed to his care might be\r\ninstructed. The youth of the middle classes, destined for the cloister\r\nor the merchant\'s stall, chiefly thronged these schools. The aristocracy\r\ncared little for book-learning. Very few indeed of the barons could read\r\nor write. But all could ride, fence, tilt, play at cards, and carve\r\nextremely well; for to these accomplishments many years of pagehood and\r\nsquirehood were given.\r\n\r\nW. F.

Among others, I met with one entitled, "_The\r\nVisions of Mirzah_," which I have read over with great pleasure. I\r\nintend to give it to the public when I have no other entertainment for\r\nthem; and shall begin with the first Vision, which I have translated\r\nword for word, as follows:--\r\n\r\n"On the fifth day of the moon, which, according to the custom of my\r\nforefathers, I always keep holy, after having washed myself, and offered\r\nup my morning devotions, I ascended the high hills of Bagdat, in order\r\nto pass the rest of the day in meditation and prayer. As I was here\r\nairing myself on the tops of the mountains, I fell into a profound\r\ncontemplation on the vanity of human life; and passing from one thought\r\nto another, \'Surely,\' said I, \'man is but a shadow, and life a dream.\'\r\n\r\n"Whilst I was thus musing, I cast my eyes towards the summit of a rock\r\nthat was not far from me, where I discovered one in the habit of a\r\nshepherd, with a little musical instrument in his hand. As I looked\r\nupon him, he applied it to his lips, and began to play upon it. The\r\nsound of it was exceeding sweet, and wrought into a variety of tunes\r\nthat were inexpressibly melodious, and altogether different from\r\nanything I had ever heard. They put me in mind of those heavenly airs\r\nthat are played to the departed souls of good men upon their first\r\narrival in paradise, to wear out the impressions of the last agonies,\r\nand qualify them for the pleasures of that happy place. My heart melted\r\naway in secret raptures.\r\n\r\n"I had been often told that the rock before me was the haunt of a\r\ngenius; and that several had been entertained with music who had passed\r\nby it, but never heard that the musician had before made himself\r\nvisible. When he had raised my thoughts by those transporting airs which\r\nhe played, to taste the pleasures of his conversation, as I looked upon\r\nhim like one astonished, thereupon he beckoned to me and, by the waving\r\nof his hand, directed me to approach the place where he sat.\r\n\r\n"I drew near with that reverence which is due to a superior nature; and\r\nas my heart was entirely subdued by the captivating strains I had heard,\r\nI fell down at his feet and wept. The Genius smiled upon me with a look\r\nof compassion and affability that familiarized him to my imagination,\r\nand at once dispelled all the fears and apprehensions with which I\r\napproached him. He lifted me from the ground, and taking me by the hand,\r\n\'Mirzah,\' said he, \'I have heard thee in thy soliloquies; follow me.\'\r\n\r\n"He then led me to the highest pinnacle of the rock, and placing me on\r\nthe top of it, \'Cast thy eyes eastward,\' said he, \'and tell me what thou\r\nseest.\' \'I see,\' said I, \'a huge valley, and a prodigious tide of water\r\nrolling through it.\' \'The valley that thou seest,\' said he, \'is the Vale\r\nof Misery, and the Tide of Water that thou seest is part of the great\r\nTide of Eternity,\' \'What is the reason,\' said I, \'that the tide I see\r\nrises out of a thick mist at one end, and again loses itself in a thick\r\nmist at the other?\' \'What thou seest,\' said he, \'is that portion of\r\neternity which is called Time, measured out by the sun, and reaching\r\nfrom the beginning of the world to its consummation.\'\r\n\r\n"\'Examine now,\' said he, \'this sea that is bounded with darkness at both\r\nends, and tell me what thou discoverest in it.\' \'I see a bridge,\' said\r\nI, \'standing in the midst of the tide.\' \'The bridge thou seest,\' said\r\nhe, \'is Human Life; consider it attentively.\' Upon a more leisurely\r\nsurvey of it, I found that it consisted of threescore and ten entire\r\narches, with several broken arches, which, added to those that were\r\nentire, made up the number about an hundred. As I was counting the\r\narches, the Genius told me that this bridge had consisted at first of a\r\nthousand arches; but that a great flood swept away the rest and left the\r\nbridge in the ruinous condition I now beheld it.\r\n\r\n"\'But tell me further,\' said he, \'what thou discoverest on it.\' \'I see\r\nmultitudes of people passing over it,\' said I, \'and a black cloud\r\nhanging on each end of it.\' As I looked more attentively, I saw several\r\nof the passengers dropping through the bridge, into the great tide that\r\nflowed underneath it; and, upon further examination, perceived that\r\nthere were innumerable trap-doors that lay concealed in the bridge,\r\nwhich the passengers no sooner trod upon, but they fell through them\r\ninto the tide and immediately disappeared.\r\n\r\n"These hidden pitfalls were set very thick at the entrance of the\r\nbridge, so that the throngs of people no sooner broke through the cloud,\r\nbut many of them fell into them. They grew thinner towards the middle,\r\nbut multiplied and lay closer together towards the end of the arches\r\nthat were entire.\r\n\r\n"There were indeed some persons, but their numbers were very small, that\r\ncontinued a kind of hobbling march on the broken arches, but fell\r\nthrough one after another, being quite tired and spent with so long a\r\nwalk.\r\n\r\n"I passed some time in the contemplation of this wonderful structure,\r\nand the great variety of objects which it presented. My heart was filled\r\nwith a deep melancholy to see several dropping unexpectedly in the midst\r\nof mirth and jollity, and catching at everything that stood by them to\r\nsave themselves.\r\n\r\n"Some were looking up towards the heavens in a thoughtful posture, and,\r\nin the midst of a speculation, stumbled and fell out of sight.\r\nMultitudes were very busy in the pursuit of bubbles that glittered in\r\ntheir eyes and danced before them; but often, when they thought\r\nthemselves within reach of them, their footing failed and down they\r\nsunk.\r\n\r\n"In this confusion of objects, I observed some with scymetars in their\r\nhands, who ran to and fro upon the bridge, thrusting several persons on\r\ntrap-doors which did not seem to lie in their way, and which they might\r\nhave escaped had they not been thus forced upon them.\r\n\r\n"The Genius, seeing me indulge myself on this melancholy prospect, told\r\nme that I had dwelt long enough upon it: \'Take thine eyes off the\r\nbridge,\' said he, \'and tell me if thou yet seest anything thou dost not\r\ncomprehend.\' Upon looking up, \'What mean,\' said I, \'those great flights\r\nof birds that are perpetually hovering about the bridge and settling\r\nupon it from time to time? I see vultures, harpies, ravens, cormorants,\r\nand, among many other feathered creatures, several little winged boys\r\nthat perch in great numbers upon the middle arches.\' \'These,\' said the\r\nGenius, \'are envy, avarice, superstition, despair, love, with the like\r\ncares and passions that infest human life.\'\r\n\r\n"I here fetched a deep sigh, \'Alas,\' said I, \'man was made in vain! How\r\nis he given away to misery and mortality! tortured in life, and\r\nswallowed up in death.\'\r\n\r\n"The Genius, being moved with compassion towards me, bid me quit so\r\nuncomfortable a prospect: \'Look no more,\' said he, \'on man in the first\r\nstage of his existence, in his setting out for eternity; but cast thine\r\neye on that thick mist into which the tide bears the several\r\ngenerations of mortals that fall into it.\'\r\n\r\n"I directed my sight as I was ordered, and (whether or no the good\r\nGenius strengthened it with any supernatural force, or dissipated part\r\nof the mist that was before too thick for the eye to penetrate) I saw\r\nthe valley opening at the farther end and spreading forth into an\r\nimmense ocean, that had a huge rock of adamant running through the midst\r\nof it and dividing it into two equal parts.\r\n\r\n"The clouds still rested on one half of it, insomuch that I could\r\ndiscover nothing in it; but the other appeared to me a vast ocean,\r\nplanted with innumerable islands that were covered with fruits and\r\nflowers and interwoven with a thousand little shining seas that ran\r\namong them. I could see persons dressed in glorious habits with garlands\r\nupon their heads, passing among the trees, lying down by the side of\r\nfountains, or resting on beds of flowers; and could hear a confused\r\nharmony of singing birds, falling waters, human voices, and musical\r\ninstruments.\r\n\r\n"Gladness grew in me upon the discovery of so delightful a scene. I\r\nwished for the wings of an eagle, that I might fly away to those happy\r\nseats; but the Genius told me there was no passage to them, except\r\nthrough the gates of Death, which I saw opening every moment upon the\r\nbridge.\r\n\r\n"\'The islands,\' said he, \'that lie so fresh and green before thee, and\r\nwith which the whole face of the ocean appears spotted as far as thou\r\ncanst see, are more in number than the sands on the sea-shore: there are\r\nmyriads of islands behind those which thou here discoverest, reaching\r\nfarther than thine eye or even thine imagination can extend itself.\r\nThese are the mansions of good men after death, who, according to the\r\ndegree and kinds of virtue in which they excelled, are distributed among\r\nthese several islands, which abound with pleasures of different kinds\r\nand degrees, suitable to the relishes and perfections of those who are\r\nsettled in them: every island is a paradise accommodated to its\r\nrespective inhabitants. Are not these, O Mirzah, habitations worth\r\ncontending for? Does life appear miserable, that gives thee\r\nopportunities of earning such a reward? Is death to be feared, that will\r\nconvey thee to so happy an existence? Think not man was made in vain,\r\nwho has such an eternity reserved for him.\'\r\n\r\n"I gazed with inexpressible pleasure on these happy islands. At length,\r\nI said: \'Show me now, I beseech thee, the secrets that lie hid under\r\nthose dark clouds which cover the ocean on the other side of the rock of\r\nadamant.\'\r\n\r\n"The Genius making me no answer, I turned about to address myself to him\r\na second time, but found that he had left me; I then turned again to the\r\nVision which I had been so long contemplating; but instead of the\r\nrolling tide, the arched bridge, and the happy islands, I saw nothing\r\nbut the long, hollow valley of Bagdat, with oxen, sheep, and camels\r\ngrazing upon the sides of it."\r\n\r\nAddison: "The Spectator, No. 159."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFORBEARANCE\r\n\r\n\r\n    Hast thou named all the birds without a gun?\r\n    Loved the wood-rose, and left it on its stalk?\r\n    At rich men\'s tables eaten bread and pulse?\r\n    Unarmed, faced danger with a heart of trust?\r\n    And loved so well a high behaviour,\r\n    In man or maid, that thou from speech refrained,\r\n    Nobility more nobly to repay?\r\n    O, be my friend, and teach me to be thine!\r\n\r\nEmerson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMERCY TO ANIMALS\r\n\r\n\r\n    I would not enter on my list of friends\r\n    (Though graced with polished manners and fine sense,\r\n    Yet wanting sensibility) the man\r\n    Who needlessly sets foot upon a worm.\r\n    An inadvertent step may crush the snail\r\n    That crawls at evening in the public path;\r\n    But he that has humanity, forewarned,\r\n    Will tread aside, and let the reptile live.\r\n    The creeping vermin, loathsome to the sight,\r\n    And charged perhaps with venom, that intrudes\r\n    A visitor unwelcome into scenes\r\n    Sacred to neatness and repose, the alcove,\r\n    The chamber, or refectory, may die.\r\n    A necessary act incurs no blame.\r\n    The sum is this: if man\'s convenience, health,\r\n    Or safety interfere, his rights and claims\r\n    Are paramount, and must extinguish theirs.\r\n    Else they are all--the meanest things that are--\r\n    As free to live, and to enjoy that life,\r\n    As God was free to form them at the first,\r\n    Who in His sovereign wisdom made them all.\r\n    Ye, therefore, who love mercy, teach your sons\r\n    To love it, too.\r\n\r\nCowper\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNITED EMPIRE LOYALISTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Americans inaugurated their Declaration of Independence by enacting\r\nthat all the United Empire Loyalists--that is the adherents to\r\nconnection with the mother country--were rebels and traitors; they\r\nfollowed the recognition of Independence by England with an order\r\nexiling such adherents from their territories. But while this policy\r\ndepleted the United States of some of their best blood, it laid the\r\nfoundation of the settlement and the institutions of the country which\r\nhas since become the great, free, and prosperous Dominion of Canada.\r\n\r\nUpper Canada was then unknown, or known only as a region of dense\r\nwilderness and swamps; of venomous reptiles and beasts of prey; of\r\nnumerous and fierce Indian tribes; of intense cold in winter; and with\r\nno redeeming feature except abundance of game and fish.\r\n\r\nAfter the war of Independence, many Loyalists went to Nova Scotia and\r\nNew Brunswick and settled there. The British Commander of New York,\r\nhaving found out that Upper Canada was capable of supporting a numerous\r\npopulation along the great river and the lakes, undertook to send\r\ncolonies of Loyalists there.\r\n\r\nFive vessels were procured and furnished to convey the first colony from\r\nNew York. They sailed round the coasts of Nova Scotia and New Brunswick,\r\nand up the St. Lawrence to Sorel, where they arrived in October, 1783.\r\nHere they wintered, having built themselves huts, or shanties, and in\r\nMay, 1784, they continued their voyage in boats, and reached their\r\ndestination, Cataraqui, afterwards Kingston, in the month of July.\r\n\r\nOther bands of Loyalists came by land over the military highway to Lower\r\nCanada, as far as Plattsburg, and then northward to Cornwall and up the\r\nSt. Lawrence, along the north side of which many of them settled.\r\n\r\nBut the most common route was by way of the Hudson and the Mohawk\r\nRivers, through Oneida Lake and down the Oswego River to Lake Ontario.\r\nFlat-bottomed boats, specially built or purchased for the purpose by the\r\nLoyalists, were used in this journey. The portages, over which the boats\r\nhad to be hauled and all their contents carried, are said to have been\r\nthirty miles long.\r\n\r\nOn reaching Oswego, some of the Loyalists coasted along the eastern\r\nshore of Lake Ontario to Kingston, and thence up the Bay of Quinte;\r\nothers went westward along the south shore of the lake to Niagara and\r\nQueenston. Some conveyed their boats over the portage of ten or twelve\r\nmiles to Chippewa, thence up the river and into Lake Erie, settling\r\nchiefly in what was called "Long Point Country," now the County of\r\nNorfolk.\r\n\r\nThis journey of hardship, privation, and exposure occupied from two to\r\nthree months. The obstacles encountered may readily be imagined in a\r\ncountry where the primeval forest covered the earth, and where the only\r\npath was the river or the lake. The parents and family of the writer of\r\nthis history were from the middle of May to the middle of July making\r\nthe journey in an open boat. Generally two or more families would unite\r\nin one company, and thus assist each other in carrying their boats and\r\ngoods over the portages.\r\n\r\n"These excellent men," wrote Sir Richard Bonnycastle, "were willing to\r\nsacrifice life and fortune rather than forego the enviable distinction\r\nof being British subjects." The stern adherence of the Pilgrim Fathers\r\nto their principles was quite equalled by the stern adherence of the\r\nLoyalists to their principles; but the privations and hardships\r\nexperienced by many of the Loyalist patriots for years after the first\r\nsettlement in Canada were much more severe than anything experienced by\r\nthe Puritans during the first years of their settlement in\r\nMassachusetts.\r\n\r\nCanada has, indeed, a noble parentage, the remembrance of which its\r\ninhabitants may well cherish with respect, affection, and pride.\r\n\r\nEgerton Ryerson: "The Loyalists of America and their Times."

From point to point, this end\r\nof the strait is forty-five miles wide. At the other end, the west side,\r\nbetween Digges\' Island and Nottingham Island, is a distance of\r\nthirty-five miles. From east to west, the straits are four hundred and\r\nfifty miles long--wider at the east where the south side is known as\r\nUngava Bay, contracting at the west, to the Upper Narrows. The south\r\nside of the strait is Labrador; the north, Baffin\'s Land. Both sides are\r\nlofty, rocky, cavernous shores lashed by a tide that rises in places as\r\nhigh as thirty-five feet and runs in calm weather ten miles an hour.\r\nPink granite islands dot the north shore in groups that afford\r\nharbourage, but all shores present an adamant front, edges sharp as a\r\nknife or else rounded hard to have withstood and cut the tremendous ice\r\njam of a floating world suddenly contracted to forty miles, which Davis\r\nStrait pours down at the east end and Fox Channel at the west.\r\n\r\nSeven hundred feet is considered a good-sized hill; one thousand feet, a\r\nmountain. Both the north and the south sides of the straits rise two\r\nthousand feet in places. Through these rock walls ice has poured and\r\ntorn and ripped a way since the ice age preceding history, cutting a\r\ngreat channel to the Atlantic. Here, the iron walls suddenly break to\r\nsecluded silent valleys, moss-padded, snow-edged, lonely as the day\r\nEarth first saw light. Down these valleys pour the clear streams of the\r\neternal snows, burnished as silver against the green, setting the\r\nsilence echoing with the tinkle of cataracts over some rock wall, or\r\nfilling the air with the voice of many waters at noontide thaw. One old\r\nnavigator--Coates--describes the beat of the angry tide at the rock base\r\nand the silver voice of the mountain brooks, like the treble and bass of\r\nsome great cathedral organ sounding its diapason to the glory of God in\r\nthis peopleless wilderness.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the kyacks of some solitary Eskimo, lashed abreast twos and\r\nthrees to prevent capsizing, may shoot out from some of these\r\nbog-covered valleys like sea-birds; but it is only when the Eskimos\r\nhappen to be hunting here, or the ships of the whalers and fur traders\r\nare passing up and down--that there is any sign of human habitation on\r\nthe straits.\r\n\r\nWalrus wallow on the pink granite islands in huge herds. Polar bears\r\nflounder from icepan to icepan. The arctic hare, white as snow but for\r\nthe great bulging black eye, bounds over the boulders. Snow buntings,\r\nwhistling swans, snow geese, ducks in myriads--flacker and clacker and\r\nhold solemn conclave on the adjoining rocks, as though this were their\r\nrealm from the beginning and for all time.\r\n\r\nOf a tremendous depth are the waters of the straits. Not for nothing has\r\nthe ice world been grinding through this narrow channel for billions of\r\nyears. No fear of shoals to the mariner. Fear is of another sort. When\r\nthe ice is running in a whirlpool and the incoming tide meets the ice\r\njam and the waters mount thirty-five feet high and a wind roars between\r\nthe high shores like a bellows--then it is that the straits roll and\r\npitch and funnel their waters into black troughs where the ships go\r\ndown. "Undertow," the old Hudson\'s Bay captains called the suck of the\r\ntide against the ice wall; and that black hole, where the lumpy billows\r\nseemed to part like a passage between wall of ice and wall of water, was\r\nwhat the mariners feared. The other great danger was just a plain crush,\r\ngetting nipped between two icepans rearing and plunging like fighting\r\nstallions, with the ice blocks going off like pistol shots or smashed\r\nglass.

AMBROSE CREW WIN THEIR FIRST RACE\r\n\r\n(The chief characters in this sketch are Miller, the tyrannical little\r\ncockswain of the crew; old Jervis, the captain; Tom Brown, number two,\r\nwho is rowing his first race; Hardy, a friend of Tom\'s and one of the\r\nbest oarsmen in the college--also Jack, the college dog. Though there\r\nare several crews in the race the real struggle is between the boats\r\nfrom St. Ambrose and Exeter Colleges. If St. Ambrose can drive the nose\r\nof its boat against the Exeter boat--"bump it"--it wins.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHark!--the first gun. The report sent Tom\'s heart into his mouth again.\r\nSeveral of the boats pushed off at once into the stream; and the crowds\r\nof men on the bank began to be agitated, as it were, by the shadow of\r\nthe coming excitement. The St. Ambrose fingered their oars, put a last\r\ndash of grease on their rowlocks, and settled their feet against the\r\nstretchers.\r\n\r\n"Shall we push her off?" asked Bow.\r\n\r\n"No; I can give you another minute," said Miller, who was sitting, watch\r\nin hand, in the stern; "only be smart when I give the word."\r\n\r\nThe captain turned on his seat, and looked up the boat. His face was\r\nquiet, but full of confidence, which seemed to pass from him into the\r\ncrew. Tom felt calmer and stronger, as he met his eye. "Now mind, boys,\r\ndon\'t quicken," he said, cheerily; "four short strokes to get way on\r\nher, and then, steady. Here, pass up the lemon."\r\n\r\nAnd he took a sliced lemon out of his pocket, put a small piece in his\r\nown mouth, and then handed it to Blake, who followed his example, and\r\npassed it on. Each man took a piece; and just as Bow had secured the\r\nend, Miller called out,--\r\n\r\n"Now, jackets off, and get her head out steadily."\r\n\r\nThe jackets were thrown on shore, and gathered up by the boatman in\r\nattendance. The crew poised their oars, Number Two pushing out her head,\r\nand the captain doing the same for the stern. Miller took the\r\nstarting-rope in his hand.\r\n\r\n"How the wind catches her stern," he said; "here, pay out the rope one\r\nof you. No, not you--some fellow with a strong hand. Yes, you\'ll do," he\r\nwent on, as Hardy stepped down the bank and took hold of the rope; "let\r\nme have it foot by foot as I want it. Not too quick; make the most of\r\nit--that\'ll do. Two and Three, just dip your oars in to give her way."\r\n\r\nThe rope paid out steadily, and the boat settled to her place. But now\r\nthe wind rose again, and the stern drifted in towards the bank.\r\n\r\n"You _must_ back her a bit, Miller, and keep her a little further out or\r\nour oars on stroke side will catch the bank."\r\n\r\n"So I see; curse the wind. Back her, one stroke all. Back her, I say!"\r\nshouted Miller.\r\n\r\nIt is no easy matter to get a crew to back her an inch just now,\r\nparticularly as there are in her two men who have never rowed a race\r\nbefore, except in the torpids, and one who has never rowed a race in his\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nHowever, back she comes; the starting-rope slackens in Miller\'s left\r\nhand, and the stroke, unshipping his oar, pushes the stern gently out\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThere goes the second gun! one short minute more, and we are off. Short\r\nminute, indeed! you wouldn\'t say so if you were in the boat, with your\r\nheart in your mouth and trembling all over like a man with the palsy.\r\nThose sixty seconds before the starting-gun in your first race--why,\r\nthey are a little lifetime.\r\n\r\n"By Jove, we are drifting in again," said Miller, in horror. The captain\r\nlooked grim but said nothing; it was too late now for him to be\r\nunshipping again. "Here, catch hold of the long boat-hook and fend her\r\noff."\r\n\r\nHardy, to whom this was addressed, seized the boat-hook, and, standing\r\nwith one foot in the water, pressed the end of the boat-hook against the\r\ngunwale, at the full stretch of his arm, and so, by main force, kept the\r\nstern out. There was just room for stroke oars to dip, and that was all.\r\nThe starting-rope was as taut as a harp-string; will Miller\'s left hand\r\nhold out?\r\n\r\nIt is an awful moment. But the coxswain, though almost dragged backwards\r\noff his seat, is equal to the occasion. He holds his watch in his right\r\nhand with the tiller rope. "Eight seconds more only. Look out for the\r\nflash. Remember, all eyes in the boat."\r\n\r\nThere it comes, at last--the flash of the starting-gun. Long before the\r\nsound of the report can roll up the river, the whole pent-up life and\r\nenergy which has been held in leash, as it were, for the last six\r\nminutes, is loose, and breaks away with a bound and a dash which he who\r\nhas felt it will remember for his life, but the like of which, will he\r\never feel again? The starting-ropes drop from the coxswains\' hands, the\r\noars flash into the water and gleam on the feather, the spray flies from\r\nthem, and the boats leap forward.\r\n\r\nThe crowds on the bank scatter and rush along, each keeping as near as\r\nmay be to its own boat. Some of the men on the towing-path, some on the\r\nvery edge of, often in, the water; some slightly in advance, as if they\r\ncould help to drag their boat forward; some behind, where they can see\r\nthe pulling better; but all at full speed, in wild excitement, and\r\nshouting at the top of their voices to those on whom the honour of the\r\ncollege is laid.\r\n\r\n"Well pulled, all!" "Pick her up there, Five!" "You\'re gaining every\r\nstroke!" "Time in the bows!" "Bravo, St. Ambrose!"\r\n\r\nOn they rushed by the side of the boats, jostling one another,\r\nstumbling, struggling, and panting along.\r\n\r\nFor a quarter of a mile along the bank the glorious, maddening\r\nhurly-burly extends, and rolls up the side of the stream.\r\n\r\nFor the first ten strokes Tom was in too great fear of making a mistake\r\nto feel or hear or see. His whole soul was glued to the back of the man\r\nbefore him, his one thought to keep time and get his strength into the\r\nstroke. But, as the crew settled down into the well-known long sweep,\r\nwhat we may call consciousness returned; and, while every muscle in his\r\nbody was straining, and his chest heaved, and his heart leaped, every\r\nnerve seemed to be gathering new life, and his senses to wake into\r\nunwonted acuteness. He caught the scent of wild thyme in the air, and\r\nfound room in his brain to wonder how it could have got there, as he had\r\nnever seen the plant near the river, or smelt it before. Though his eye\r\nnever wandered from the back of Diogenes, he seemed to see all things at\r\nonce. The boat behind, which seemed to be gaining;--it was all he could\r\ndo to prevent himself from quickening on the stroke as he fancied\r\nthat;--the eager face of Miller, with his compressed lips, and eyes\r\nfixed so earnestly ahead that Tom could almost feel the glance passing\r\nover his right shoulder; the flying banks and the shouting crowd; see\r\nthem with his bodily eyes he could not, but he knew, nevertheless, that\r\nGrey had been upset and nearly rolled down the bank into the water in\r\nthe first hundred yards, that Jack was bounding and scrambling and\r\nbarking along by the very edge of the stream; above all, he was just as\r\nwell aware as if he had been looking at it, of a stalwart form in cap\r\nand gown, bounding along, brandishing the long boat-hook, and always\r\nkeeping just opposite the boat; and amid all the Babel of voices, and\r\nthe dash and pulse of the stroke, and the labouring of his own\r\nbreathing, he heard Hardy\'s voice coming to him again and again, and\r\nclear as if there had been no other sound in the air, "Steady, Two!\r\nsteady! well pulled! steady, steady." The voice seemed to give him\r\nstrength and keep him to his work. And what work it was! he had had many\r\na hard pull in the last six weeks, but never aught like this.\r\n\r\nBut it can\'t last forever; men\'s muscles are not steel, or their lungs\r\nbulls\' hide, and hearts can\'t go on pumping a hundred miles an hour\r\nlong, without bursting. The St. Ambrose boat is well away from the boat\r\nbehind, there is a great gap between the accompanying crowds; and now,\r\nas they near the Gut, she hangs for a moment or two in hand, though the\r\nroar from the bank grows louder and louder, and Tom is already aware\r\nthat the St. Ambrose crowd is melting into the one ahead of them.\r\n\r\n"We must be close to Exeter!" The thought flashes into him, and, it\r\nwould seem, into the rest of the crew at the same moment; for, all at\r\nonce, the strain seems taken off their arms again; there is no more\r\ndrag; she springs to the stroke as she did at the start; and Miller\'s\r\nface, which had darkened for a few seconds, lightens up again.\r\n\r\nMiller\'s face and attitude are a study. Coiled up into the smallest\r\npossible space, his chin almost resting on his knees, his hands close to\r\nhis sides, firmly but lightly feeling the rudder, as a good horseman\r\nhandles the mouth of a free-going hunter; if a coxswain could make a\r\nbump by his own exertions, surely he will do it. No sudden jerks of the\r\nSt. Ambrose rudder will you see, watch as you will from the bank; the\r\nboat never hangs through fault of his, but easily and gracefully rounds\r\nevery point. "You\'re gaining! you\'re gaining!" he now and then mutters\r\nto the captain, who responds with a wink, keeping his breath for other\r\nmatters. Isn\'t he grand, the captain, as he comes forward like\r\nlightning, stroke after stroke, his back flat, his teeth set, his whole\r\nframe working from the hips with the regularity of a machine? As the\r\nspace still narrows, the eyes of the fiery little coxswain flash with\r\nexcitement, but he is far too good a judge to hurry the final effort\r\nbefore the victory is safe in his grasp.\r\n\r\nThe two crowds are mingled now, and no mistake; and the shouts come all\r\nin a heap over the water. "Now, St. Ambrose, six strokes more." "Now,\r\nExeter, you\'re gaining; pick her up." "Mind the Gut, Exeter." "Bravo,\r\nSt. Ambrose!" The water rushes by, still eddying from the strokes of\r\nthe boat ahead. Tom fancies now he can hear their oars and the workings\r\nof their rudder, and the voice of their coxswain. In another moment both\r\nboats are in the Gut, and a perfect storm of shouts reaches them from\r\nthe crowd, as it rushes madly off to the left to the footbridge, amidst\r\nwhich "Oh, well steered, well steered, St. Ambrose!" is the prevailing\r\ncry. Then Miller, motionless as a statue till now, lifts his right hand\r\nand whirls the tassel round his head. "Give it her now, boys; six\r\nstrokes and we\'re into them." Old Jervis lays down that great broad back\r\nand lashes his oar through the water with the might of a giant, the crew\r\ncatch him up in another stroke, the tight new boat answers to the spurt,\r\nand Tom feels a little shock behind him, and then a grating sound, as\r\nMiller shouts, "Unship oars, Bow and Three!" and the nose of the St.\r\nAmbrose boat glides quietly up the side of the Exeter till it touches\r\ntheir stroke oar.\r\n\r\n"Take care where you\'re coming to." It is the coxswain of the bumped\r\nboat who speaks.\r\n\r\nTom finds himself within a foot or two of him when he looks round; and,\r\nbeing utterly unable to contain his joy, and yet unwilling to exhibit\r\nit before the eyes of a gallant rival, turns away towards the shore, and\r\nbegins telegraphing to Hardy.\r\n\r\n"Now, then, what are you at there in the bows? Cast her off, quick.\r\nCome, look alive! Push across at once out of the way of the other\r\nboats."\r\n\r\n"I congratulate you, Jervis," says the Exeter stroke, as the St. Ambrose\r\nboat shoots past him. "Do it again next race and I shan\'t care."\r\n\r\nThomas Hughes: "Tom Brown at Oxford."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHUNTING SONG\r\n\r\n\r\n    Waken, lords and ladies gay,\r\n    On the mountain dawns the day;\r\n    All the jolly chase is here\r\n    With hawk and horse and hunting-spear;\r\n    Hounds are in their couples yelling,\r\n    Hawks are whistling, horns are knelling,\r\n    Merrily, merrily mingle they,\r\n    \'Waken, lords and ladies gay.\'\r\n\r\n    Waken, lords and ladies gay,\r\n    The mist has left the mountain gray,\r\n    Springlets in the dawn are steaming,\r\n    Diamonds on the brake are gleaming,\r\n    And foresters have busy been\r\n    To track the buck in thicket green;\r\n    Now we come to chant our lay,\r\n    \'Waken, lords and ladies gay.\'\r\n\r\n    Waken, lords and ladies gay,\r\n    To the greenwood haste away;\r\n    We can show you where he lies,\r\n    Fleet of foot and tall of size;\r\n    We can show the marks he made\r\n    When \'gainst the oak his antlers frayed;\r\n    You shall see him brought to bay:\r\n    \'Waken, lords and ladies gay.\'\r\n\r\n    Louder, louder chant the lay,\r\n    Waken, lords and ladies gay!\r\n    Tell them youth and mirth and glee\r\n    Run a course as well as we;\r\n    Time, stern huntsman! who can baulk,\r\n    Staunch as hound and fleet as hawk;\r\n    Think of this, and rise with day,\r\n    Gentle lords and ladies gay!\r\n\r\nScott\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not what he has, nor even what he does, which directly expresses\r\nthe worth of a man, but what he is.\r\n\r\nAmiel\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBORDER BALLAD\r\n\r\n\r\n    March, march, Ettrick and Teviotdale,\r\n      Why, my lads, dinna ye march forward in order!\r\n    March, march, Eskdale and Liddesdale,\r\n      All the Blue Bonnets are bound for the Border.\r\n        Many a banner spread\r\n        Flutters above your head,\r\n      Many a crest that is famous in story;\r\n        Mount and make ready then,\r\n        Sons of the mountain glen,\r\n    Fight for the Queen and our old Scottish glory!\r\n\r\n    Come from the hills where your hirsels[1] are grazing,\r\n      Come from the glen of the buck and the roe;\r\n    Come to the crag where the beacon is blazing,\r\n      Come with the buckler, the lance, and the bow;\r\n        Trumpets are sounding,\r\n        War-steeds are bounding,\r\n      Stand to your arms, and march in good order;\r\n        England shall many a day\r\n        Tell of the bloody fray\r\n    When the Blue Bonnets came over the Border.\r\n\r\nScott\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n[1] Cattle\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT NORTHERN DIVER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe weird, long call, or the shrill, demoniacal laugh coming out of the\r\nnight tells of the sleepless activity of the loon. The whip-poor-will in\r\nthe adjacent shrubbery seems companionable, and there is a friendly\r\nspirit in the short, shrill tremolo of the night-hawk from the invisible\r\nsky. Even the plaint of the screech-owl has a tone of human sympathy.\r\nBut the dreary cadence of the loon is the voice of the inhospitable\r\nnight, repelling every thought of human association. It does not\r\nentreat, it does not warn; yet there is a fascination in its\r\nexpressionless strength. Over the black water, under the lowering sky,\r\nor through the bright still moonlight, the same unfeeling tone fills the\r\near of night. And sometimes, when the lingering moon sheds a broad trail\r\nof light along the still waters of the lake, the graceful swimmer will\r\nglide across and disappear in the darkness, breaking the bright\r\nreflection into a multitude of chasing, quivering, trailing threads of\r\nsilver. Throughout the day, where the cedars come down to meet their\r\nshadows in the dark water, he swims ceaselessly about, sitting low, with\r\nblack, glossy neck gracefully curved and displaying its delicate white\r\nmarkings. Sometimes he stretches himself wearily, flapping his wings,\r\nand displaying his white breast and the handsome, showy markings of his\r\nsides. Though wary and aloof, and without a trace of animation in his\r\nloud, penetrating cries, he shows his kinship by the scrupulous care\r\nwith which he preens his handsome feathers--even lying on his back in\r\nthe water to comb out and smooth his glossy, white breast.\r\n\r\nA hurried cry from overhead may unexpectedly reveal the presence of a\r\npair of loons in another element, and it is always fascinating to watch\r\ntheir steady, strained, energetic flight above the tops of the pines,\r\ngenerally to curve down to some more attractive expanse in the\r\ncedar-girt lake. For the water is the loon\'s natural element. There is\r\nan amusing deliberateness in his graceful, silent dive. He does not make\r\nthe hurried dip of his smaller cousin, the grebe, but more calmly curves\r\nboth neck and body, disappearing under the surface in a graceful arch.\r\nSettling down and swimming with only head and neck exposed is an\r\nevidence of suspicion, and is generally followed by a long dive, with a\r\nbelated reappearance in some remote part of the lake.\r\n\r\nWhen the mother loon takes her two offspring out for a swim, it is a big\r\nevent in the domestic circle. The outing is announced by prolonged and\r\nunusual repetitions of the laughing call. For half an hour the echoes of\r\nthe lake are kept alive with sounds portentous of new departures in the\r\nloon world. Then a peculiar object is seen to emerge from the marshy bay\r\nand cross under the shadowy cedars toward the open water. A field-glass\r\nshows it to be the mother loon and her two offspring, the three huddled\r\nso closely together that they are almost indistinguishable. The mother\r\nis unceasing in her care and attention. She strokes the backs of the\r\nyoung birds with her bill, playing and fussing around and close to them,\r\nas if they could not exist without her constant attention. Now and then\r\nshe leans over and lifts a broad, black, webbed foot out of the water,\r\nholding it up distended, as if to endorse the modern theory that the\r\nparent loon teaches her young to swim. They cling to each other and\r\ncling to her, as if afraid of being lost in the great expanse of water\r\nto which they have been so recently introduced.\r\n\r\nA short distance away the father swims about in lordly indifference,\r\ndiving occasionally and regaling himself on the unsuspecting fish. A\r\nboat comes out from the shore, rowed by an industrious guide, with an\r\nangler, picturesquely protected by mosquito net, sitting in the stern.\r\nThe mother loon pushes and urges her indolent pair in the direction of\r\nsafety. How slow they must seem as she hurries and encourages them! The\r\ntrio moves at a snail\'s pace compared with her ordinary speed, but the\r\nyoung ones show no inclination to dive out of harm\'s way. Their\r\nclinging, crowding tendency serves but to incommode and obstruct her.\r\nAnd where is the male protector? Alas for the romance of chivalry! When\r\nthe boat comes near, he deliberately dives, and, after the usual\r\nprotracted wait, reappears in another part of the lake, away from the\r\ndanger that alarms and threatens the defenceless trio. But the mother\r\nremains and urges the encumbering young things to speed. They do make\r\nsome headway, though slowly, toward the marshy bay from which they\r\nrecently emerged with so much loud, wild laughter. The indifference of\r\nthe fisherman and the guide does not reassure them, and they never cease\r\ntheir entangled struggle till lost to sight in the winding lagoon.\r\n\r\nS. T. Wood\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO THE CUCKOO\r\n\r\n\r\n    O blithe New-comer! I have heard,\r\n    I hear thee and rejoice.\r\n    O Cuckoo! shall I call thee Bird,\r\n    Or but a wandering Voice?\r\n\r\n    While I am lying on the grass\r\n    Thy twofold shout I hear;\r\n    From hill to hill it seems to pass,\r\n    At once far off, and near.\r\n\r\n    Though babbling only to the Vale,\r\n    Of sunshine and of flowers,\r\n    Thou bringest unto me a tale\r\n    Of visionary hours.\r\n\r\n    Thrice welcome, darling of the Spring!\r\n    Even yet thou art to me\r\n    No bird, but an invisible thing,\r\n    A voice, a mystery;\r\n\r\n    The same whom in my school-boy days\r\n    I listened to; that Cry\r\n    Which made me look a thousand ways\r\n    In bush, and tree, and sky.\r\n\r\n    To seek thee did I often rove\r\n    Through woods and on the green;\r\n    And thou wert still a hope, a love;\r\n    Still longed for, never seen.\r\n\r\n    And I can listen to thee yet;\r\n    Can lie upon the plain\r\n    And listen, till I do beget\r\n    That golden time again.\r\n\r\n    O bless\xc3\xa8d Bird! the earth we pace\r\n    Again appears to be\r\n    An unsubstantial faery place,\r\n    That is fit home for Thee!\r\n\r\nWordsworth\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE GRASSHOPPER AND CRICKET\r\n\r\n\r\n    The poetry of earth is never dead:\r\n      When all the birds are faint with the hot sun,\r\n      And hide in cooling trees, a voice will run\r\n    From hedge to hedge about the new-mown mead;\r\n    That is the Grasshopper\'s--he takes the lead\r\n      In summer luxury--he has never done\r\n      With his delights; for when tired out with fun\r\n\r\n    He rests at ease beneath some pleasant weed.\r\n    The poetry of earth is ceasing never:\r\n      On a lone winter evening, when the frost\r\n      Has wrought a silence, from the stove there shrills\r\n    The Cricket\'s song, in warmth increasing ever,\r\n      And seems to one in drowsiness half-lost,\r\n      The Grasshopper\'s among some grassy hills.\r\n\r\nKeats\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT NORTHWEST\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd now let us turn our glance to this great Northwest, whither my\r\nwandering steps are about to lead me. Fully nine hundred miles as bird\r\nwould fly, and one thousand two hundred as horse can travel, west of Red\r\nRiver, an immense range of mountains eternally capped with snow rises in\r\nrugged masses from a vast stream-scarred plain. They who first beheld\r\nthese grand guardians of the central prairies named them the Montagnes\r\ndes Rochers (Rocky Mountains),--a fitting title for such vast\r\naccumulations of rugged magnificence. From the glaciers and ice-valleys\r\nof this great range of mountains, innumerable streams descend into the\r\nplains. For a time they wander, as if heedless of direction, through\r\ngroves and glades and green-spreading declivities; then, assuming\r\ngreater fixity of purpose, they gather up many a wandering rill and\r\nstart eastward upon a long journey. At length the many detached streams\r\nresolve themselves into two great water systems. Through hundreds of\r\nmiles these two rivers pursue their parallel courses, now approaching,\r\nnow opening out from each other. Suddenly the southern river bends\r\ntowards the north, and, at a point some six hundred miles from the\r\nmountains, pours its volume of water into the northern channel. Then the\r\nunited river rolls, in vast, majestic curves, steadily towards the\r\nnorth-east, turns once more towards the south, opens out into a great\r\nreed-covered marsh, sweeps on into a large cedar-lined lake, and\r\nfinally, rolling over a rocky ledge, casts its waters into the northern\r\nend of the great Lake Winnipeg, fully one thousand three hundred miles\r\nfrom the glacier cradle where it took its birth. This river, which has\r\nalong it every diversity of hill and vale, meadow-land and forest,\r\ntreeless plain and fertile hillside, is called by the wild tribes who\r\ndwell along its glorious shores, the Saskatchewan or "rapid-flowing\r\nriver." But this Saskatchewan is not the only river which drains the\r\ngreat central region between Red River and the Rocky Mountains. The\r\nAssiniboine or "stony river" drains the rolling prairie-lands five\r\nhundred miles west from Red River; and many a smaller stream, and\r\nrushing, bubbling brook, carries into its devious channel the waters of\r\nthat vast country which lies between the American boundary line and the\r\npine woods of the Lower Saskatchewan.\r\n\r\nSo much for the rivers; and now for the land through which they flow.\r\nHow shall we picture it? how shall we tell the story of that great,\r\nboundless, solitary waste of verdure? The old, old maps, which the\r\nnavigators of the sixteenth century formed from the discoveries of Cabot\r\nand Cartier, of Verrazanno and Hudson, played strange pranks with the\r\ngeography of the New World. The coast-line, with the estuaries of large\r\nrivers, was tolerably accurate; but the centre of America was\r\nrepresented as a vast inland sea, whose shores stretched far into the\r\nPolar North--a sea through which lay the much-coveted passage to the\r\nlong-sought treasures of the old realms of Cathay. Well, the geographers\r\nof that period erred only in the description of ocean which they placed\r\nin the centre of the continent; for an ocean there is--an ocean through\r\nwhich men seek the treasures of Cathay even in our own times. But the\r\nocean is one of grass, and the shores are the crests of mountain ranges\r\nand the dark pine forests of sub-Arctic regions. The great ocean itself\r\ndoes not present such infinite variety as does this prairie-ocean of\r\nwhich we speak:--in winter, a dazzling surface of purest snow; in early\r\nsummer, a vast expanse of grass and pale pink roses; in autumn, too\r\noften a wild sea of raging fire! No ocean of water in the world can vie\r\nwith its gorgeous sunsets; no solitude can equal the loneliness of a\r\nnight-shadowed prairie: one feels the stillness, and hears the silence:\r\nthe wail of the prowling wolf makes the voice of solitude audible; the\r\nstars look down through infinite silence upon a silence almost as\r\nintense. This ocean has no past;--time has been nought to it, and men\r\nhave come and gone, leaving behind them no track, no vestige of their\r\npresence. Some French writer, speaking of these prairies, has said that\r\nthe sense of this utter negation of life, this complete absence of\r\nhistory, has struck him with a loneliness, oppressive and sometimes\r\nterrible in its intensity. Perhaps so, but, for my part, the prairies\r\nhad nothing terrible in their aspect, nothing oppressive in their\r\nloneliness. One saw here the world, as it had taken shape and form from\r\nthe hands of the Creator. Nor did the scene look less beautiful because\r\nnature alone tilled the earth, and the unaided sun brought forth the\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\nOctober had reached its latest week; the wild geese and swans had taken\r\ntheir long flight to the south, and their wailing cry no more descended\r\nthrough the darkness; ice had settled upon the quiet pools and was\r\nsettling upon the quick-running streams; the horizon glowed at night\r\nwith the red light of moving prairie fires. It was the close of the\r\nIndian Summer, and Winter was coming quickly down, from his far northern\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nMajor W. F.

my\r\ninclination to make new voyages. I therefore bought goods, departed with\r\nthem for the best seaport, and there, that I might not be obliged to\r\ndepend upon a captain, but have a ship at my own command, I remained\r\ntill one was built on purpose at my own charge. When the ship was ready,\r\nI went on board with my goods: but not having enough to load her, I\r\nagreed to take with me several merchants of different nations, with\r\ntheir merchandise.\r\n\r\nWe sailed with the first fair wind, and after a long navigation the\r\nfirst place we touched at was a desert island, where we found an egg of\r\na roc, equal in size to that I saw on a former voyage, fifty paces\r\nround, and shining as a great white dome when seen even from afar. There\r\nwas a young roc in it, just ready to be hatched, and its bill had begun\r\nto appear.\r\n\r\nThe merchants whom I had taken on board, and who landed with me, broke\r\nthe egg with hatchets, and having made a hole in it, pulled out the\r\nyoung roc piecemeal and roasted it. I had earnestly entreated them not\r\nto meddle with the egg, but they would not listen to me.\r\n\r\nScarcely had they finished their repast, when there appeared in the air,\r\nat a considerable distance from us, two great clouds. The captain whom I\r\nhad hired to navigate my ship, knowing by experience what they meant,\r\nsaid they were the male and female roc that belonged to the young one,\r\nand pressed us to re-embark with all speed, to prevent the misfortune\r\nwhich he saw would otherwise befall us. We hastened on board and set\r\nsail with all possible expedition. In the meantime, the two rocs\r\napproached with a frightful noise, which they redoubled when they saw\r\nthe egg broken and their young one gone. They flew back in the direction\r\nthey had come, and disappeared for some time, while we made all the sail\r\nwe could to endeavour to prevent that which unhappily befell us.\r\n\r\nThey soon returned, and we observed that each of them carried between\r\nits talons, stones, or rather rocks, of a monstrous size. When they came\r\ndirectly over my ship they hovered, and one of them let fall a stone,\r\nbut by the dexterity of the steersman it missed us, and, falling into\r\nthe sea, divided the water so that we could almost see the bottom. The\r\nother roc, to our misfortune, threw his massy burden so exactly into the\r\nmiddle of the ship as to split it into a thousand pieces. The mariners\r\nand passengers were all crushed to death, or sunk. I myself was of the\r\nnumber of the latter, but, as I came up again, I fortunately caught hold\r\nof a piece of the wreck, and swimming, sometimes with one hand and\r\nsometimes with the other, but always holding fast my board, the wind and\r\ntide favouring me, I came to an island whose shore was very steep. I\r\novercame that difficulty, however, and got ashore.\r\n\r\nI sat down upon the grass to recover myself from my fatigue, after which\r\nI went into the island to explore it. It seemed to be a delicious\r\ngarden. I found trees everywhere, some of them bearing green, and others\r\nripe fruits; and there were streams of fresh, pure water running in\r\npleasant meanders. I ate of the fruits, which I found excellent; and\r\ndrank of the water, which was very light and good.\r\n\r\nWhen I was a little advanced into the island I saw an old man, who\r\nappeared very weak and infirm. He was sitting on the bank of a stream,\r\nand at first I took him to be one who had been shipwrecked like myself.\r\nI went towards him and saluted him, but he only slightly bowed his\r\nhead. I asked him why he sat so still; but instead of answering me, he\r\nmade a sign for me to take him upon my back and carry him over the\r\nbrook, signifying that it was to gather fruit.\r\n\r\nI believed him really to stand in need of my assistance, took him upon\r\nmy back, and having carried him over, bade him get down, and for that\r\nend stooped, that he might get off with ease; but instead of doing so\r\n(which I laugh at every time I think of it), the old man who appeared to\r\nme quite decrepit, threw his legs nimbly about my neck. He sat astride\r\nupon my shoulders, and held my throat so tight that I thought he would\r\nhave strangled me, the apprehension of which made me swoon and fall\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding my fainting, the ill-natured old fellow kept fast about\r\nmy neck. When I had recovered my breath, he thrust one of his feet\r\nagainst my stomach, and struck me so rudely on the side with the other,\r\nthat he forced me to rise up against my will. Having arisen, he made me\r\ncarry him under the trees, and forced me now and then to stop, to gather\r\nand eat fruit such as we found. He never left me all day, and when I lay\r\ndown to rest at night, he laid himself down with me, holding always\r\nfast about my neck. Every morning he pushed me to make me awake, and\r\nafterwards obliged me to get up and walk, and pressed me with his feet.\r\nYou may judge then, what trouble I was in to be loaded with such a\r\nburden of which I could not get rid.\r\n\r\nOne day I found in my way several dry calabashes that had fallen from a\r\ntree. I took a large one, and after cleaning it, pressed into it some\r\njuice of grapes, which abounded in the island. Having filled the\r\ncalabash, I put it by in a convenient place; and going thither again\r\nsome days after, I tasted it and found the wine so good that it soon\r\nmade me forget my sorrow, gave me new vigour, and so exhilarated my\r\nspirits, that I began to sing and dance as I walked along.\r\n\r\nThe old man, perceiving the effect which this liquor had upon me, and\r\nthat I carried him with more ease than before, made me a sign to give\r\nhim some of it. I handed him the calabash, and the liquor pleasing his\r\npalate, he drank it all off. There being a considerable quantity of it,\r\nand the fumes getting into his head, he began to sing and dance upon my\r\nshoulders, and to loosen his legs from about me by degrees. Finding\r\nthat he did not press me as before, I threw him upon the ground, where\r\nhe lay without motion; then I took up a great stone and crushed his\r\nhead.\r\n\r\nI was extremely glad to be thus freed for ever from this troublesome\r\nfellow. I now walked towards the beach, where I met the crew of a ship\r\nthat had cast anchor, to take water. They were surprised to see me, but\r\nmore so at the particulars of my adventures. "You fell," said they,\r\n"into the hands of the old man of the sea, and are the first who ever\r\nescaped strangling by his malicious tricks. He never quitted those he\r\nhad once made himself master of till he had destroyed them, and he has\r\nmade this island notorious by the number of men he has slain."\r\n\r\nAfter having informed me of these things, they carried me with them to\r\nthe ship; the captain received me with great kindness when they told him\r\nwhat had befallen me. He put out again to sea, and after some days\'\r\nsail, we arrived at the harbour of a great city, the houses of which\r\nwere built with hewn stone.\r\n\r\nOne of the merchants who had taken me into his friendship invited me to\r\ngo along with him and carried me to a place appointed for the\r\naccommodation of foreign merchants. He gave me a large bag, and having\r\nrecommended me to some people of the town, who used to gather\r\ncocoa-nuts, desired them to take me with them. "Go," said he, "follow\r\nthem, and act as you see them do; but do not part from them, otherwise\r\nyou may endanger your life." Having thus spoken, he gave me provisions\r\nfor the journey, and I went with them.\r\n\r\nWe came to a thick forest of cocoa trees, very lofty, with trunks so\r\nsmooth that it was not possible to climb to the branches that bore the\r\nfruit. When we entered the forest, we saw a great number of apes of\r\nseveral sizes, who fled as soon as they perceived us and climbed up to\r\nthe tops of the trees with surprising swiftness.\r\n\r\nThe merchants gathered stones and threw them at the apes in the trees. I\r\ndid the same, and the apes, out of revenge, threw cocoa-nuts at us so\r\nfast, and with such gestures, as sufficiently testified their anger and\r\nresentment. We gathered up the cocoa-nuts, and from time to time threw\r\nstones to provoke the apes; so that by this stratagem we filled our bags\r\nwith cocoa-nuts, which it had been impossible otherwise to have done. I\r\nthus gradually collected as many cocoa-nuts as produced me a\r\nconsiderable sum.\r\n\r\nWe sailed towards the islands, where pepper grows in great plenty. From\r\nthence we went to the isle of Comari, where the best species of wood of\r\naloes grows. I exchanged my cocoa in those islands for pepper and wood\r\nof aloes, and went with other merchants a-pearl-fishing. I hired divers,\r\nwho brought me up some that were very large and pure. I embarked in a\r\nvessel that happily arrived at Bussorah; from thence I returned to\r\nBagdat, where I made vast sums of my pepper, wood of aloes, and pearls.\r\nI gave the tenth of my gains in alms, as I had done upon my return from\r\nmy other voyages, and endeavoured to dissipate my fatigues by amusements\r\nof different kinds.\r\n\r\n"The Arabian Nights Entertainments."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    All are needed by each one;\r\n    Nothing is fair or good alone.\r\n    I thought the sparrow\'s note from heaven,\r\n    Singing at dawn on the alder bough;\r\n    I brought him home, in his nest, at even;\r\n    He sings the song, but it cheers not now,\r\n    For I did not bring home the river and sky;--\r\n    He sang to my ear,--they sang to my eye.\r\n\r\nEmerson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOCEAN\r\n\r\n\r\n      Roll on, thou deep and dark blue Ocean--roll!\r\n      Ten thousand fleets sweep over thee in vain;\r\n      Man marks the earth with ruin,--his control\r\n      Stops with the shore; upon the watery plain\r\n      The wrecks are all thy deed, nor doth remain\r\n      A shadow of man\'s ravage, save his own,\r\n      When for a moment, like a drop of rain,\r\n      He sinks into thy depths with bubbling groan--\r\n    Without a grave, unknelled, uncoffined, and unknown.\r\n\r\n      His steps are not upon thy paths,--thy fields,\r\n      Are not a spoil for him,--thou dost arise\r\n      And shake him from thee; the vile strength he wields\r\n      For earth\'s destruction, thou dost all despise,\r\n      Spurning him from thy bosom to the skies,\r\n      And send\'st him, shivering in thy playful spray,\r\n      And howling to his gods, where haply lies\r\n      His petty hope in some near port or bay,\r\n    And dashest him again to earth; there let him lay.\r\n\r\n      The armaments which thunderstrike the walls\r\n      Of rock-built cities, bidding nations quake,\r\n      And monarchs tremble in their capitals;\r\n      The oak leviathans, whose huge ribs make\r\n      Their clay creator the vain title take\r\n      Of lord of thee, and arbiter of war:\r\n      These are thy toys, and, as the snowy flake,\r\n      They melt into thy yeast of waves, which mar\r\n    Alike the Armada\'s pride or spoils of Trafalgar.\r\n\r\n      Thy shores are empires, changed in all save thee--\r\n      Assyria, Greece, Rome, Carthage, what are they?\r\n      Thy waters washed them power while they were free,\r\n      And many a tyrant since; their shores obey\r\n      The stranger, slave, or savage; their decay\r\n      Has dried up realms to deserts: not so, thou;\r\n      Unchangeable save to thy wild waves\' play.\r\n      Time writes no wrinkle on thine azure brow;\r\n    Such as creation\'s dawn beheld, thou rollest now.\r\n\r\n      Thou glorious mirror, where the Almighty\'s form\r\n      Glasses itself in tempests; in all time,\r\n      Calm or convulsed--in breeze or gale or storm,\r\n      Icing the pole, or in the torrid clime,\r\n      Dark-heaving, boundless, endless and sublime--\r\n      The image of eternity--the throne\r\n      Of the Invisible; even from out thy slime\r\n      The monsters of the deep are made; each zone\r\n    Obeys thee; thou goest forth, dread, fathomless, alone.\r\n\r\n      And I have loved thee, Ocean! and my joy\r\n      Of youthful sports was on thy breast to be\r\n      Borne, like thy bubbles onward: from a boy\r\n      I wantoned with thy breakers; they to me\r\n      Were a delight; and, if the freshening sea\r\n      Made them a terror--\'twas a pleasing fear;\r\n      For I was as it were a child of thee\r\n      And trusted to thy billows far and near,\r\n    And laid my hand upon thy mane--as I do here.\r\n\r\nByron: "Childe Harold\'s Pilgrimage."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Britain\'s myriad voices call\r\n    "Sons be welded each and all,\r\n    Into one imperial whole,\r\n    One with Britain, heart and soul!\r\n    One life, one flag, one fleet, one Throne!"\r\n        Britons, hold your own!\r\n\r\nTennyson\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HOMEWARD BOUND]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPONTIAC\'S ATTEMPT TO CAPTURE FORT DETROIT\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the year 1763, a celebrated chief of the Ottawas, called Pontiac,\r\nsucceeded in forming a confederacy of the Ottawas, Hurons, Chippewas,\r\nand some other tribes, with the avowed object of expelling the British\r\nfrom the lake regions of the country. With the craftiness peculiar to\r\nthe Indian race, an ingenious stratagem was devised, by means of which\r\nit was hoped that the allies would easily gain possession of the forts.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose a grand Lacrosse match was organized at each post, and\r\nthe officers of the garrison invited to become participators in the\r\ngame.\r\n\r\nPontiac and his attendant chiefs had, while the warriors and braves were\r\nengaged in the game of Lacrosse on the common, sought an audience of the\r\ngovernor of the fort. He received them in the mess-room, apparently not\r\nsuspecting any artifice on their part.\r\n\r\n"The pale warrior, the friend of the Ottawa chief, is not here," said\r\nthe governor, as he glanced his eye along the semi-circle of Indians.\r\n"How is this? Is his voice still sick, that he cannot come? or has the\r\ngreat chief of the Ottawas forgotten to tell him?"\r\n\r\n"The voice of the pale warrior is still sick, and he cannot speak,"\r\nreplied the Indian. "The Ottawa chief is very sorry; for the tongue of\r\nhis friend, the pale-face, is full of wisdom."\r\n\r\nScarcely had the last words escaped his lips when a wild, shrill cry\r\nfrom without the fort rang on the ears of the assembled council, and\r\ncaused a momentary commotion among the officers. It arose from a single\r\nvoice, and that voice could not be mistaken by any who had heard it once\r\nbefore. A second or two, during which the officers and chiefs kept their\r\neyes intently fixed on one another, passed anxiously away; and then\r\nnearer to the gate, apparently on the very drawbridge itself, was pealed\r\nforth the wild and deafening yell of a legion of fiendish voices. At\r\nthat sound, the Ottawa and the other chiefs sprang to their feet, and\r\ntheir own fierce cry responded to that yet vibrating on the ears of all.\r\nAlready were their gleaming tomahawks brandished wildly over their\r\nheads, and Pontiac had even bounded a pace forward to reach the governor\r\nwith the deadly weapon, when, at the sudden stamping of the foot of the\r\nlatter upon the floor, the scarlet cloth in the rear was thrown aside,\r\nand twenty soldiers, their eyes glancing along the barrels of their\r\nlevelled muskets, met the startled gaze of the astonished Indians.\r\n\r\nAn instant was enough to satisfy the keen chief of the true state of the\r\ncase. The calm, composed mien of the officers, not one of whom had even\r\nattempted to quit his seat amid the din by which his ears were so\r\nalarmingly assailed,--the triumphant, yet dignified, and even severe\r\nexpression of the governor\'s countenance; and, above all, the unexpected\r\npresence of the prepared soldiery,--all these at once assured him of the\r\ndiscovery of his treachery, and the danger that awaited him. The\r\nnecessity for an immediate attempt to join his warriors without was now\r\nobvious to the Ottawa; and scarcely had he conceived the idea before he\r\nsought to execute it. In a single spring he gained the door of the\r\nmess-room, and, followed eagerly and tumultuously by the other chiefs,\r\nto whose departure no opposition was offered, in the next moment stood\r\non the steps of the piazza that ran along the front of the building\r\nwhence he had issued. The surprise of the Indians on reaching this point\r\nwas now too powerful to be dissembled; and incapable either of\r\nadvancing or receding, they remained gazing on the scene before them\r\nwith an air of mingled stupefaction, rage, and alarm. Scarcely ten\r\nminutes had elapsed since they had proudly strode through the naked area\r\nof the fort, and yet even in that short space of time its appearance had\r\nbeen entirely changed. Not a part was there now of the surrounding\r\nbuildings that was not replete with human life and hostile preparation.\r\nThrough every window of the officers\' low rooms was to be seen the dark\r\nand frowning muzzle of a field-piece bearing upon the gateway, and\r\nbehind these were artillerymen holding their lighted matches, supported\r\nagain by files of bayonets that glittered in their rear. In the\r\nblock-houses the same formidable array of field-pieces and muskets was\r\nvisible; while from the four angles of the square as many heavy guns,\r\nthat had been artfully masked at the entrance of the chiefs, seemed\r\nready to sweep away everything that should come before them. The\r\nguard-room near the gate presented the same hostile front. The doors of\r\nthis, as well as of the other buildings, had been firmly secured within;\r\nand from every window affording cover to the troops gleamed a line of\r\nbayonets, rising above the threatening field-pieces, pointed, at a\r\ndistance of little more than twelve feet, directly upon the gateway. In\r\naddition to his musket, each man of the guard held a hand grenade,\r\nprovided with a short fuse that could be ignited in a moment from the\r\nmatches of the gunners, with immediate effect. The soldiers in the\r\nblock-houses were similarly provided.\r\n\r\nAlmost magical as was the change thus suddenly effected in the\r\nappearance of the garrison, it was not the most interesting feature in\r\nthe exciting scene. Choking up the gateway, in which they were\r\ncompletely wedged, and crowding the drawbridge, a dense mass of "husky"\r\nIndians were to be seen casting their fierce glances around, yet\r\nparalyzed in their movements by the unlooked-for display of resisting\r\nforce, threatening instant annihilation to those who should attempt\r\neither to advance or recede. Never, perhaps, were astonishment and\r\ndisappointment more forcibly depicted on the human countenance, than\r\nthey were now exhibited by these men, who had already in imagination\r\nsecured to themselves an easy conquest. They were the warriors who had\r\nso recently been engaged in the manly yet innocent exercise of the ball;\r\nbut, instead of the harmless hurdle, each now carried a short gun in\r\none hand and a gleaming tomahawk in the other.\r\n\r\nAfter the first general yelling heard in the council-room, not a sound\r\nwas uttered. Their burst of rage and triumph had evidently been checked\r\nby the unexpected manner of their reception; and they now stood on the\r\nspot on which the further advance of each had been arrested, so silent\r\nand motionless, that, but for the rolling of their dark eyes, as they\r\nkeenly measured the insurmountable barriers that were opposed to their\r\nprogress, they might almost have been taken for a wild group of\r\nstatuary. Conspicuous at the head of these was he who wore the blanket;\r\na tall warrior on whom rested the startled eye of every officer and\r\nsoldier who was so situated as to behold him. His face was painted black\r\nas death; and as he stood under the arch of the gateway, with his white\r\nturbaned head towering far above those of his companions, this\r\nformidable and mysterious enemy might have been likened to the spirit of\r\ndarkness presiding over his terrible legions.\r\n\r\nIn order to account for the extraordinary appearance of the Indians,\r\narmed in every way for death, at a moment when neither gun nor tomahawk\r\nwas apparently within miles of their reach, it was necessary to revert\r\nto the first entrance of the chiefs into the fort. The fall of Pontiac\r\nhad been the effect of design; and the yell pealed forth by him, on\r\nrecovering his feet, as if in taunting reply to the laugh of his\r\ncomrades, was in reality a signal intended for the guidance of the\r\nIndians without. These now following up their game with increasing\r\nspirit, at once changed the direction of their line, bringing the ball\r\nnearer to the fort. In their eagerness to effect this object, they had\r\noverlooked the gradual secession of the unarmed troops, spectators of\r\ntheir sport from the ramparts, until scarcely more than twenty\r\nstragglers were left. As they neared the gate, the squaws broke up their\r\nseveral groups, and, forming a line on either hand of the road leading\r\nto the drawbridge, appeared to separate solely with a view not to impede\r\nthe players. For an instant a dense group collected around the ball,\r\nwhich had been drawn to within a hundred yards of the gate, and fifty\r\nhurdles were crossed in their endeavour to secure it, when the warrior,\r\nwho formed the solitary exception to the multitude, in his blanket\r\ncovering, and who had been lingering in the extreme rear of the party,\r\ncame rapidly up to the spot where the well-affected struggle was\r\nmaintained. At his approach the hurdles of the other players were\r\nwithdrawn, when, at a single blow from his powerful arm, the ball was\r\nseen flying in an oblique direction and was for a moment lost altogether\r\nto the view. When it again met the eye, it was descending into the very\r\ncentre of the fort.\r\n\r\nWith the fleetness of thought now commenced a race which had ostensibly\r\nfor its object the recovery of the lost ball, and in which he who had\r\ndriven it with resistless force outstripped them all. Their course lay\r\nbetween the two lines of squaws; and scarcely had the head of the\r\nbounding Indians reached the opposite extremity of those lines, when the\r\nwomen suddenly threw back their blankets, and disclosed each a short gun\r\nand tomahawk. To throw away their hurdles and seize upon these, was the\r\nwork of an instant. Already, in imagination, was the fort their own;\r\nand, such, was the peculiar exaltation of the black and turbaned warrior\r\nwhen he felt the planks of the drawbridge bending beneath his feet, all\r\nthe ferocious joy of his soul was pealed forth in the terrible cry\r\nwhich, rapidly succeeded by that of the other Indians, had resounded so\r\nfearfully through the council-room.\r\n\r\nWhat their disappointment was, when, on gaining the interior, they found\r\nthe garrison prepared for their reception, has already been shown.\r\n\r\nMajor Richardson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMY NATIVE LAND\r\n\r\n\r\n    Breathes there the man, with soul so dead,\r\n    Who never to himself hath said,\r\n      This is my own, my native land!\r\n    Whose heart hath ne\'er within him burned,\r\n    As home his footsteps he hath turned,\r\n      From wandering on a foreign strand!\r\n    If such there breathe, go, mark him well;\r\n    For him no minstrel raptures swell;\r\n    High though his titles, proud his name,\r\n    Boundless his wealth as wish can claim:\r\n    Despite those titles, power, and pelf,\r\n    The wretch, concentred all in self,\r\n    Living, shall forfeit fair renown,\r\n    And, doubly dying, shall go down\r\n    To the vile dust, from whence he sprung,\r\n    Unwept, unhonoured, and unsung.\r\n\r\nScott: "The Lay of the Last Minstrel."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMORNING ON THE LIEVRE\r\n\r\n\r\n    Far above us where a jay\r\n    Screams his matins to the day,\r\n    Capped with gold and amethyst,\r\n    Like a vapour from the forge\r\n    Of a giant somewhere hid,\r\n    Out of hearing of the clang\r\n    Of his hammer, skirts of mist\r\n    Slowly up the woody gorge\r\n    Lift and hang.\r\n\r\n    Softly as a cloud we go,\r\n    Sky above and sky below,\r\n    Down the river; and the dip\r\n    Of the paddles scarcely breaks,\r\n    With the little silvery drip\r\n    Of the water as it shakes\r\n    From the blades, the crystal deep\r\n    Of the silence of the morn,\r\n    Of the forest yet asleep;\r\n    And the river reaches borne\r\n    In a mirror, purple gray,\r\n    Sheer away\r\n    To the misty line of light,\r\n    Where the forest and the stream\r\n    In the shadow meet and plight,\r\n    Like a dream.\r\n\r\n    From amid a stretch of reeds,\r\n    Where the lazy river sucks\r\n    All the water as it bleeds\r\n    From a little curling creek,\r\n    And the muskrats peer and sneak\r\n    In around the sunken wrecks\r\n    Of a tree that swept the skies\r\n    Long ago,\r\n    On a sudden seven ducks\r\n    With a splashy rustle rise,\r\n    Stretching out their seven necks,\r\n    One before, and two behind,\r\n    And the others all arow,\r\n    And as steady as the wind\r\n    With a swivelling whistle go,\r\n    Through the purple shadow led,\r\n    Till we only hear their whir\r\n    In behind a rocky spur,\r\n    Just ahead.\r\n\r\nArchibald Lampman\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI call, therefore, a complete and generous education, that which fits a\r\nman to perform justly, skilfully, and magnanimously, all the offices,\r\nboth private and public, of peace and war.\r\n\r\nMilton: "On Education."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEVENING\r\n\r\n\r\n    From upland slopes I see the cows file by,\r\n    Lowing, great-chested, down the homeward trail,\r\n    By dusking fields and meadows shining pale\r\n    With moon-tipped dandelions.

The\r\nwater runs deep all the way to it from the sea, and the largest vessels\r\nmay ride with safety within a stone\'s throw of the windows. In the\r\nlatter half of the sixteenth century there must have met, in the hall of\r\nthis mansion, a party as remarkable as could have been found anywhere in\r\nEngland. Humfrey and Adrian Gilbert, with their half-brother, Walter\r\nRaleigh, here, when little boys, played at sailors in the reaches of\r\nLong Stream, in the summer evenings doubtless rowing down with the tide\r\nto the port, and wondering at the quaint figure-heads and carved prows\r\nof the ships which thronged it; or climbing on board, and listening,\r\nwith hearts beating, to the mariners\' tales of the new earth beyond the\r\nsunset. And here in later life, matured men, whose boyish dreams had\r\nbecome heroic action, they used again to meet in the intervals of quiet,\r\nand the rock is shown underneath the house where Raleigh smoked the\r\nfirst tobacco. Another remarkable man could not fail to have made a\r\nfourth at these meetings. A sailor-boy of Sandwich, the adjoining\r\nparish, John Davis, showed early a genius which could not have escaped\r\nthe eye of such neighbours, and in the atmosphere of Greenaway he\r\nlearned to be as noble as the Gilberts, and as tender and delicate as\r\nRaleigh.\r\n\r\nIn 1585 John Davis left Dartmouth on his first voyage into the Polar\r\nSeas; and twice subsequently he went again, venturing in small,\r\nill-equipped vessels of thirty or forty tons into the most dangerous\r\nseas. These voyages were as remarkable for their success as for the\r\ndaring with which they were accomplished, and Davis\' epitaph is written\r\non the map of the world, where his name still remains to commemorate his\r\ndiscoveries. Brave as he was, he is distinguished by a peculiar and\r\nexquisite sweetness of nature, which, from many little facts of his\r\nlife, seems to have affected every one with whom he came in contact in a\r\nremarkable degree. We find men, for the love of Master Davis, leaving\r\ntheir firesides to sail with him, without other hope or motion; we find\r\nsilver bullets cast to shoot him in a mutiny; the hard, rude natures of\r\nthe mutineers being awed by something in his carriage which was not like\r\nthat of a common man. He has written the account of one of his northern\r\nvoyages himself; and there is an imaginative beauty in it, and a rich\r\ndelicacy of expression, which is called out in him by the first sight of\r\nstrange lands and things and people.\r\n\r\nWe have only space to tell something of the conclusion of his voyage\r\nnorth. In latitude sixty-three degrees, he fell in with a barrier of\r\nice, which he coasted for thirteen days without finding an opening. The\r\nvery sight of an iceberg was new to all his crew; and the ropes and\r\nshrouds, though it was midsummer, becoming compassed with ice,--\r\n\r\n"The people began to fall sick and faint-hearted--whereupon, very\r\norderly, and with good discretion, they entreated me to regard the\r\nsafety of mine own life, as well as the preservation of theirs; and that\r\nI should not, through over-boldness, leave their widows and fatherless\r\nchildren to give me bitter curses.\r\n\r\n"Whereupon, seeking counsel of God, it pleased His Divine Majesty to move\r\nmy heart to prosecute that which I hope shall be to His glory and to the\r\ncontentation of every Christian mind."\r\n\r\nHe had two vessels--one of some burden, the other a pinnace of thirty\r\ntons. The result of the counsel which he had sought was, that he made\r\nover his own large vessel to such as wished to return, and himself,\r\n"thinking it better to die with honour than to return with infamy," went\r\non with such volunteers as would follow him, in a poor leaky cutter, up\r\nthe sea now in commemoration of that adventure called Davis\' Strait. He\r\nascended four degrees north of the furthest known point, among storms\r\nand icebergs, when the long days and twilight nights alone saved him\r\nfrom being destroyed, and, coasting back along the American shore, he\r\ndiscovered Hudson Strait, supposed then to be the long desired entrance\r\ninto the Pacific. This exploit drew the attention of Walsingham, and by\r\nhim Davis was presented to Burleigh, "who was also pleased to show him\r\ngreat encouragement." If either these statesmen or Elizabeth had been\r\ntwenty years younger, his name would have filled a larger space in\r\nhistory than a small corner of the map of the world; but, if he was\r\nemployed at all in the last years of the century, no _vates sacer_ has\r\nbeen found to celebrate his work, and no clew is left to guide us. He\r\ndisappears; a cloud falls over him. He is known to have commanded\r\ntrading vessels in the Eastern seas, and to have returned five times\r\nfrom India. But the details are all lost, and accident has only parted\r\nthe clouds for a moment to show us the mournful setting with which he,\r\ntoo, went down upon the sea.\r\n\r\nIn taking out Sir Edward Michellthorne to India, in 1604, he fell in\r\nwith a crew of Japanese, whose ship had been burnt, drifting at sea,\r\nwithout provisions, in a leaky junk. He supposed them to be pirates, but\r\nhe did not choose to leave them to so wretched a death, and took them on\r\nboard; and in a few hours, watching their opportunity, they murdered\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nAs the fool dieth, so dieth the wise, and there is no difference; it was\r\nthe chance of the sea, and the ill reward of a humane action--a\r\nmelancholy end for such a man--like the end of a warrior, not dying\r\nEpaminondas-like on the field of victory, but cut off in some poor brawl\r\nor ambuscade. But so it was with all these men. They were cut off in the\r\nflower of their days, and few of them laid their bones in the sepulchres\r\nof their fathers. They knew the service which they had chosen, and they\r\ndid not ask the wages for which they had not laboured. Life with them\r\nwas no summer holiday, but a holy sacrifice offered up to duty, and\r\nwhat their Master sent was welcome. Beautiful is old age--beautiful is\r\nthe slow-dropping mellow autumn of a rich, glorious summer. In the old\r\nman, Nature has fulfilled her work; she loads him with her blessings;\r\nshe fills him with the fruits of a well-spent life; and, surrounded by\r\nhis children and his children\'s children, she rocks him softly away to a\r\ngrave, to which he is followed with blessings. God forbid we should not\r\ncall it beautiful. It is beautiful, but not the most beautiful. There is\r\nanother life, hard, rough, and thorny, trodden with bleeding feet and\r\naching brow; the life of which the cross is the symbol; a battle which\r\nno peace follows, this side the grave; which the grave gapes to finish,\r\nbefore the victory is won; and--strange that it should be so--this is\r\nthe highest life of man. Look back along the great names of history;\r\nthere is none whose life has been other than this. They to whom it has\r\nbeen given to do the really highest work in this earth--whoever they\r\nare, Jew or Gentile, Pagan or Christian, warriors, legislators,\r\nphilosophers, priests, poets, kings, slaves--one and all, their fate has\r\nbeen the same--the same bitter cup has been given them to drink. And so\r\nit was with the servants of England in the sixteenth century. Their\r\nlife was a long battle, either with the elements or with men; and it was\r\nenough for them to fulfil their work, and to pass away in the hour when\r\nGod had nothing more to bid them do.\r\n\r\nFroude: "Short Studies on Great Subjects."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SEA-KING\'S BURIAL\r\n\r\n\r\n    "My strength is failing fast,"\r\n      Said the sea-king to his men;\r\n    "I shall never sail the seas\r\n      As a conqueror again.\r\n    But while yet a drop remains\r\n    Of the life-blood in my veins,\r\n    Raise, O raise me from the bed;\r\n    Put the crown upon my head;\r\n    Put my good sword in my hand,\r\n    And so lead me to the strand,\r\n    Where my ship at anchor rides\r\n            Steadily;\r\n      If I cannot end my life\r\n      In the crimsoned battle-strife,\r\n    Let me die as I have lived,\r\n            On the sea."\r\n\r\n    They have raised King Balder up,\r\n      Put his crown upon his head;\r\n    They have sheathed his limbs in mail,\r\n      And the purple o\'er him spread;\r\n    And amid the greeting rude\r\n    Of a gathering multitude,\r\n    Borne him slowly to the shore--\r\n    All the energy of yore\r\n    From his dim eyes flashing forth--\r\n    Old sea-lion of the north--\r\n    As he looked upon his ship\r\n            Riding free,\r\n      And on his forehead pale\r\n      Felt the cold, refreshing gale,\r\n    And heard the welcome sound\r\n            Of the sea.\r\n\r\n    They have borne him to the ship\r\n      With a slow and solemn tread;\r\n    They have placed him on the deck\r\n      With his crown upon his head,\r\n    Where he sat as on a throne;\r\n    And have left him there alone,\r\n    With his anchor ready weighed\r\n    And his snowy sails displayed\r\n    To the favouring wind, once more\r\n    Blowing freshly from the shore;\r\n    And have bidden him farewell\r\n            Tenderly,\r\n       Saying, "_King of mighty men,\r\n       We shall meet thee yet again,\r\n    In Valhalla, with the monarchs\r\n            Of the sea_."\r\n\r\n    Underneath him in the hold\r\n      They have placed the lighted brand;\r\n    And the fire was burning slow\r\n      As the vessel from the land,\r\n    Like a stag-hound from the slips,\r\n    Darted forth from out the ships.\r\n    There was music in her sail\r\n    As it swelled before the gale,\r\n    And a dashing at her prow\r\n    As it cleft the waves below,\r\n    And the good ship sped along,\r\n            Scudding free;\r\n      As on many a battle morn\r\n      In her time she had been borne,\r\n    To struggle and to conquer\r\n            On the sea.\r\n\r\n    And the king, with sudden strength,\r\n      Started up and paced the deck,\r\n    With his good sword for his staff\r\n      And his robe around his neck:\r\n    Once alone, he raised his hand\r\n    To the people on the land;\r\n    And with shout and joyous cry\r\n    Once again they made reply,\r\n    Till the loud, exulting cheer\r\n    Sounded faintly on his ear;\r\n    For the gale was o\'er him blowing\r\n            Fresh and free;\r\n      And ere yet an hour had passed,\r\n      He was driven before the blast,\r\n    And a storm was on his path\r\n            On the sea.\r\n\r\n    "So blow, ye tempests, blow,\r\n      And my spirit shall not quail:\r\n    I have fought with many a foe,\r\n      I have weathered many a gale;\r\n    And in this hour of death,\r\n    Ere I yield my fleeting breath--\r\n    Ere the fire now burning slow\r\n    Shall come rushing from below,\r\n    And this worn and wasted frame\r\n    Be devoted to the flame--\r\n    I will raise my voice in triumph,\r\n            Singing free;--\r\n      To the great All-Father\'s home\r\n      I am driving through the foam,\r\n    I am sailing to Valhalla,\r\n            O\'er the sea.\r\n\r\n    "So blow, ye stormy winds--\r\n      And, ye flames, ascend on high;--\r\n    In the easy, idle bed\r\n      Let the slave and coward die!\r\n    But give me the driving keel,\r\n    Clang of shields and flashing steel;\r\n    Happy, happy, thus I\'d yield,\r\n    On the deck or in the field,\r\n    My last breath, shouting: \'On\r\n            To victory.\'\r\n      But since this has been denied,\r\n      They shall say that I have died\r\n    Without flinching, like a monarch\r\n            Of the sea."\r\n\r\n    And Balder spoke no more,\r\n      And no sound escaped his lip;--\r\n    Neither recked he of the roar,\r\n      The destruction of his ship,\r\n    Nor the fleet sparks mounting high,\r\n    Nor the glare upon the sky;\r\n    Scarcely heard the billows dash,\r\n    Nor the burning timber crash:\r\n    Scarcely felt the scorching heat\r\n    That was gathering at his feet,\r\n    Nor the fierce flames mounting o\'er him\r\n            Greedily.\r\n      But the life was in him yet,\r\n      And the courage to forget\r\n    All his pain, in his triumph\r\n            On the sea.\r\n\r\n    Once alone a cry arose,\r\n      Half of anguish, half of pride,\r\n    As he sprang upon his feet\r\n      With the flames on every side.\r\n    "I am coming!" said the king,\r\n    "Where the swords and bucklers ring--\r\n    Where the warrior lives again\r\n    With the souls of mighty men--\r\n    I am coming, great All-Father,\r\n            Unto Thee!\r\n      Unto Odin,

Many of them lie in the west, but the\r\ngreater part in Spain.\r\n\r\nYou may see my western possessions any evening at sunset when their\r\nspires and battlements flash against the horizon. But my finest castles\r\nare in Spain. It is a country famously romantic, and my castles are all\r\nof perfect proportions and appropriately set in the most picturesque\r\nsituations.\r\n\r\nI have never been in Spain myself, but I have naturally conversed much\r\nwith travellers to that country; although, I must allow, without\r\nderiving from them much substantial information about my property there.\r\n\r\nThe wisest of them told me that there were more holders of real estate\r\nin Spain than in any other region he had ever heard of, and they are all\r\ngreat proprietors.\r\n\r\nEvery one of them possesses a multitude of the stateliest castles. It is\r\nremarkable that none of the proprietors have ever been to Spain to take\r\npossession and report to the rest of us the state of our property there,\r\nand it is not easy for me to say how I know so much about my castles in\r\nSpain.\r\n\r\nThe sun always shines upon them. They stand lofty and fair in a\r\nluminous, golden atmosphere, a little hazy and dreamy, perhaps, like the\r\nIndian summer, but in which no gales blow and there are no tempests.\r\n\r\nAll the sublime mountains and beautiful valleys and soft landscapes that\r\nI have not yet seen are to be found in the grounds.\r\n\r\nI have often wondered how I should reach my castles. I have inquired\r\nvery particularly, but nobody seemed to know the way. It occurred to me\r\nthat Bourne, the millionaire, must have ascertained the safest and most\r\nexpeditious route to Spain; so I stole a few minutes one afternoon and\r\nwent into his office.\r\n\r\nHe was sitting at his desk, writing rapidly, and surrounded by files of\r\npapers and patterns, specimens, boxes,--everything that covers the\r\ntables of a great merchant.\r\n\r\n"A moment, please, Mr. Bourne." He looked up hastily, and wished me\r\ngood-morning, which courtesy I attributed to Spanish sympathy.\r\n\r\n"What is it, sir?" he asked blandly, but with wrinkled brow.\r\n\r\n"Mr. Bourne, have you any castles in Spain?" said I, without preface. He\r\nlooked at me for a few moments, without speaking and without seeming to\r\nsee me. His brow gradually smoothed, and his eyes apparently looking\r\ninto the street were really, I have no doubt, feasting upon the Spanish\r\nlandscape.\r\n\r\n"Too many, too many," said he, at length, musingly, shaking his head and\r\nwithout addressing me.\r\n\r\nHe feared, I thought, that he had too much impracticable property\r\nelsewhere to own so much in Spain: so I asked:--\r\n\r\n"Will you tell me what you consider the shortest and safest route\r\nthither, Mr. Bourne? for, of course, a man who drives such an immense\r\ntrade with all parts of the world will know all that I have come to\r\ninquire."\r\n\r\n"My dear sir," answered he, wearily, "I have been trying all my life to\r\ndiscover it; but none of my ships have ever been there--none of my\r\ncaptains have any report to make.\r\n\r\n"They bring me, as they brought my father, gold-dust from Guinea, ivory,\r\npearls, and precious stones from every part of the earth; but not a\r\nfruit, not a solitary flower, from one of my castles in Spain.\r\n\r\n"I have sent clerks, agents, and travellers of all kinds, philosophers,\r\npleasure hunters, and invalids, in all sorts of ships, to all sorts of\r\nplaces, but none of them ever saw or heard of my castles, except a young\r\npoet, and he died in a madhouse."\r\n\r\n"Mr. Bourne, will you take five thousand at ninety-seven?" hastily\r\ndemanded a man whom, as he entered, I recognized as a broker. "We\'ll\r\nmake a splendid thing of it."\r\n\r\nBourne nodded assent, and the broker disappeared.\r\n\r\n"Happy man!" muttered the merchant, as the broker went out; "he has no\r\ncastles in Spain."\r\n\r\n"I am sorry to have troubled you, Mr. Bourne," said I, retiring.\r\n\r\n"I\'m glad you came," returned he; "but, I assure you, had I known the\r\nroute you hoped to ascertain from me I should have sailed years and\r\nyears ago. People sail for the Northwest Passage, which is nothing when\r\nyou have found it. Why don\'t the English Admiralty fit out expeditions\r\nto discover all our castles in Spain?"\r\n\r\nYet I dream my dreams and attend to my castles in Spain. I have so much\r\nproperty there that I could not in conscience neglect it.\r\n\r\nAll the years of my youth and hopes of my manhood are stored away, like\r\nprecious stones, in the vaults; and I know that I shall find everything\r\nelegant, beautiful, and convenient when I come into possession.\r\n\r\nAs the years go by, I am not conscious that my interest diminishes.\r\n\r\nShall I tell a secret? Shall I confess that sometimes when I have been\r\nsitting reading to my Prue "Cymbeline," perhaps, or a "Canterbury Tale,"\r\nI have seemed to see clearly before me the broad highway to my castles\r\nin Spain, and, as she looked up from her work and smiled in sympathy, I\r\nhave even fancied that I was already there?\r\n\r\nGeorge William Curtis: "Prue and I."\r\n(Adapted)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nALADDIN\r\n\r\n\r\n    When I was a beggarly boy\r\n      And lived in a cellar damp,\r\n    I had not a friend or a toy,\r\n      But I had Aladdin\'s lamp;\r\n    When I could not sleep for cold,\r\n      I had fire enough in my brain,\r\n    And builded with roofs of gold\r\n      My beautiful castles in Spain!\r\n\r\n    Since then I have toiled day and night,\r\n      I have money and power good store,\r\n    But I\'d give all my lamps of silver bright\r\n      For the one that is mine no more;\r\n    Take, Fortune, whatever you choose,\r\n      You gave, and may snatch again;\r\n    I have nothing \'twould pain me to lose,\r\n      For I own no more castles in Spain!\r\n\r\nLowell\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDRAKE\'S VOYAGE ROUND THE WORLD\r\n\r\n\r\nFrancis Drake was born near Tavistock in the year 1545. He served his\r\ntime as an apprentice in a Channel coaster, and his master, who had been\r\nstruck with his character, left the vessel to him in his will when he\r\ndied. He was then twenty-one. His kinsman, John Hawkins, was fitting out\r\nhis third expedition to the Spanish Main, and young Drake, with a party\r\nof his Kentish friends, went to Plymouth and joined him. In 1572 "he\r\nmade himself whole with the Spaniards" by seizing a convoy of bullion at\r\nPanama, and on that occasion, having seen the South Pacific from the\r\nmountains, "he fell on his knees and prayed God that he might one day\r\nnavigate those waters," which no English keel as yet had furrowed.\r\n\r\nThe time and the opportunity had come. He was now in the prime of his\r\nstrength, thirty-two years old, of middle height, with crisp brown hair,\r\na broad high forehead; gray, steady eyes, unusually long; small ears\r\ntight to the head; the mouth and chin slightly concealed by the\r\nmoustache and beard, but hard, inflexible, and fierce. His dress, as he\r\nappears in his portrait, is a loose, dark, seaman\'s shirt, belted at the\r\nwaist. About his neck is a plaited cord with a ring attached to it, in\r\nwhich, as if the attitude was familiar, one of his fingers is slung,\r\ndisplaying a small, delicate, but long and sinewy hand. When at sea he\r\nwore a scarlet cap with a gold band, and was exacting in the respect\r\nwith which he required to be treated by his crew.\r\n\r\nSuch was Francis Drake when he stood on the deck of the Pelican in\r\nPlymouth harbour, in November, 1577. The squadron, with which he was\r\npreparing to sail into a chartless ocean and invade the dominions of the\r\nKing of Spain, consisted of his own ship, of a hundred and twenty tons,\r\nthe size of the smallest class of our modern Channel schooners, two\r\nbarques of fifty and thirty tons each, a second ship as it was called,\r\nthe Elizabeth, of eighty tons, not larger than a common revenue cutter,\r\nand a pinnace, hardly more than a boat, intended to be burnt if it\r\ncould not bear the seas. These vessels, with a hundred and sixty-four\r\nmen, composed the force. The object of the expedition was kept as far as\r\npossible secret. On the fifteenth of November the expedition sailed from\r\nPlymouth Sound. The vessels struck across the Atlantic and made the\r\ncoast of South America on the fifth of April in latitude thirty-three\r\ndegrees South.\r\n\r\nThe perils of the voyage were now about to commence. No Englishman had\r\nas yet passed Magellan\'s Strait. Cape Horn was unknown. Tierra del Fuego\r\nwas supposed to be part of a solid continent which stretched unbroken to\r\nthe Antarctic pole. A single narrow channel was the only access to the\r\nPacific then believed to exist. There were no charts, no records of past\r\nexperiences. It was known that Magellan had gone through, but that was\r\nall. It was the wildest and coldest season of the year, and the vessels\r\nin which the attempt was to be made were mere cockle-shells. They were\r\ntaken on shore, overhauled and scoured, the rigging looked to, and the\r\nsails new bent.\r\n\r\nOn the seventeenth of August, answering to the February of the northern\r\nhemisphere, all was once more in order. Drake sailed from Port St.\r\nJulian, and on the twentieth entered the Strait and felt his way between\r\nthe walls of mountain "in extreme cold with frost and cold continually."\r\nTo relieve the crews, who were tried by continual boat work and heaving\r\nthe lead in front of the ships, they were allowed occasional halts at\r\nthe islands, where they amused and provisioned themselves with killing\r\ninfinite seals and penguins. Everything which they saw, birds, beasts,\r\ntrees, climate, country, were strange, wild, and wonderful. After three\r\nweeks\' toil and anxiety, they had accomplished the passage and found\r\nthemselves in the open Pacific. But they found also that it was no\r\npeaceful ocean into which they had entered, but the stormiest they had\r\never encountered. Their vessels were now reduced to three; the pinnace\r\nhad been left behind at Port St. Julian, and there remained only the\r\nPelican, the Elizabeth, and the thirty-ton cutter. Instantly that they\r\nemerged out of the Strait, they were caught in a gale which swept them\r\nsix hundred miles to the south-west. For six weeks they were battered to\r\nand fro, in bitter cold and winds which seemed as if they blew in these\r\nlatitudes for ever. The cutter went down in the fearful seas, carrying\r\nher crew with her. The Elizabeth and the Pelican were separated. The\r\nbravest sailor might well have been daunted at such a commencement, and\r\nWinter, recovering the opening again and, believing Drake to be lost,\r\ncalled a council in his cabin and proposed to return to England. They\r\nhad agreed to meet, if they were parted, on the coast in the latitude of\r\nValparaiso. The men, with better heart than their commander, desired to\r\nkeep the appointment. But those terrible weeks had sickened Winter. He\r\noverruled the opinions of the rest, re-entered the Strait, and reached\r\nEngland in the following June.\r\n\r\nDrake, meanwhile, had found shelter among the islands of Tierra del\r\nFuego. At length spring brought fair winds and smooth seas, and running\r\nup the coast and looking about for her consort, the Pelican or Golden\r\nHind--for she had both names--fell in with an Indian fisherman, who\r\ninformed Drake that in the harbour of Valparaiso, already a small\r\nSpanish settlement, there lay a great galleon which had come from Peru.\r\nGalleons were the fruit that he was in search of. He sailed in, and the\r\nSpanish seamen, who had never yet seen a stranger in those waters, ran\r\nup their flags, beat their drums, and prepared a banquet for their\r\nsupposed countrymen. The Pelican shot up alongside. The English sailors\r\nleaped on board, and one "Thomas Moore," a lad from Plymouth, began the\r\nplay with knocking down the first man that he met, saluting him in\r\nSpanish as he fell, and crying out "Down, dog." The Spaniards,\r\noverwhelmed with surprise, began to cross and bless themselves. One\r\nsprang overboard and swam ashore; the rest were bound and stowed away\r\nunder the hatches while the ship was rifled. The beginning was not a bad\r\none. Wedges of gold were found weighing four hundred pounds, besides\r\nmiscellaneous plunder. The settlement, which was visited next, was less\r\nproductive, for the inhabitants had fled, taking their valuables with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAt Arica, the port of Potosi, fifty-seven blocks of precious metal were\r\nadded to the store; and from thence they made haste to Lima, where the\r\nlargest booty was looked for. They found that they had just missed it.\r\nTwelve ships lay at anchor in the port without arms, without crews, and\r\nwith their sails on shore. In all of these they discovered but a few\r\nchests of reals and some bales of silk and linen. A thirteenth, called\r\nby the seamen the Cacafuego, but christened in her baptism "Our Lady of\r\nthe Conception," had sailed for the Isthmus a few days before, taking\r\nwith her all the bullion which the mines had yielded for the season. She\r\nhad been literally ballasted with silver, and carried also several\r\nprecious boxes of gold and jewels.\r\n\r\nNot a moment was lost. The cables of the ships at Lima were cut, and\r\nthey were left to drive on shore to prevent pursuit; and then away sped\r\nthe Pelican due north, with every stitch of her canvas spread. A gold\r\nchain was promised to the first man who caught sight of the Cacafuego. A\r\nsail was seen the second day of the chase: it was not the vessel which\r\nthey were in pursuit of, but the prize was worth the having. They took\r\neighty pounds\' weight of gold in wedges, the purest which they yet had\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nFor eight hundred miles the Pelican flew on. At length, one degree to\r\nthe north of the line, off Quito, and close to the shore, a look-out on\r\nthe mast-head cried out that he saw the chase and claimed the promised\r\nchain; she was recognized by the peculiarities in her sails, of which\r\nthey had received exact information at Lima. There lay the Cacafuego; if\r\nthey could take her their work would be done, and they might go home in\r\ntriumph. She was several miles ahead of them; if she guessed their\r\ncharacter, she would run in under the land, and they might lose her. It\r\nwas afternoon: several hours remained of daylight, and Drake did not\r\nwish to come up with her till dark.\r\n\r\nThe Pelican sailed two feet to the Cacafuego\'s one, and dreading that\r\nher speed might rouse suspicion, he filled his empty wine casks with\r\nwater and trailed them astern. The chase meanwhile unsuspecting, and\r\nglad of company on a lonely voyage, slackened sail and waited for her\r\nslow pursuer. The sun sank low, and at last set into the ocean, and\r\nthen, when both ships had become invisible from the land, the casks were\r\nhoisted in, the Pelican was restored to her speed, and shooting up\r\nwithin a cable\'s length of the Cacafuego, hailed to her to run into the\r\nwind. The Spanish commander, not understanding the meaning of such an\r\norder, paid no attention to it. The next moment the corsair opened her\r\nports, fired a broadside, and brought his main-mast about his ears. His\r\ndecks were cleared by a shower of arrows, with one of which he was\r\nhimself wounded. In a few minutes more he was a prisoner, and his ship\r\nand all that it contained was in the hands of the English. The wreck\r\nwas cut away, the ship cleared, and her head turned to the sea; by\r\ndaybreak even the line of the Andes had become invisible, and at\r\nleisure, in the open ocean, the work of rifling began. The full value of\r\nthe plunder taken in this ship was never actually confessed. It remained\r\na secret between Drake and the Queen. In a schedule afterwards\r\npublished, he acknowledged to have found in the Cacafuego alone\r\ntwenty-six tons of silver bullion, thirteen chests of coined silver, and\r\nalmost a hundredweight of gold. But this was only so much as the\r\nSpaniards could prove to have been on board.\r\n\r\nDrake imagined, like most other English seamen, that there was a passage\r\nto the north corresponding to Magellan\'s Strait, of which Frobisher\r\nconceived that he had found the eastern entrance. He went on therefore\r\nat his leisure towards the coast of Mexico, intending to follow the\r\nshore till he found it. Another ship coming from China crossed him on\r\nhis way loaded with silks and porcelain. He took the best of the freight\r\nwith a golden falcon and a superb emerald. Then needing fresh water he\r\ntouched at the Spanish settlement of Guatulco.\r\n\r\nThe work of plunder was nearly over. Again sailing north, the Pelican\r\nfell in with a Spanish nobleman who was going out as Governor to the\r\nPhilippines. He was detained a few hours and relieved of his finery, and\r\nthen, says one of the party: "Our general, thinking himself both in\r\nrespect of his private injuries received from the Spaniards, as also\r\ntheir contempt and indignities offered to our country and prince in\r\ngeneral, sufficiently satisfied and revenged, and supposing her Majesty\r\nwould rest contented with this service, began to consider the best way\r\nfor his country."\r\n\r\nThe first necessity was a complete repair of the Pelican\'s hull. Before\r\nthe days of copper sheathing, the ships\' bottoms grew foul with weed;\r\nthe great barnacles formed in clusters and stopped their speed, and the\r\nsea-worms bored holes into the planking. Twenty thousand miles of\r\nunknown water lay between Drake and Plymouth Sound, and he was not a man\r\nto run idle risks. Running on till he had left the furthest Spanish\r\nstation far to the south, he put into the Bay of Canoa in Lower\r\nCalifornia. There he laid his ship on shore, set up forge and workshop,\r\nand refitted her with a month\'s labour from stem to stern.\r\n\r\nBy the sixteenth of April, 1579, the Pelican was once more in order, and\r\nstarted on her northern course in search of the expected passage. She\r\nheld on up the coast for eight hundred miles into latitude forty-three\r\ndegrees North, but no signs appeared of an opening. Though it was summer\r\nthe air grew colder, and the crew having been long in the tropics\r\nsuffered from the change. Not caring to run risks in exploring with so\r\nprecious a cargo, and finding by observation that the passage, if it\r\nexisted, must be of enormous length, Drake resolved to go no further,\r\nand expecting, as proved to be the case, that the Spaniards would be on\r\nthe look-out for him at Magellan\'s Strait, he determined on the\r\nalternative route by the Cape of Good Hope. The Portuguese had long\r\ntraded with China. In the ship going to the Philippines he had found a\r\nPortuguese chart of the Indian Archipelago, and with the help of this\r\nand his own skill he trusted to find his way.\r\n\r\nAt the little island of Ternate, south of the Celebes, the ship was\r\nagain docked and scraped. The crew were allowed another month\'s rest,\r\nwhen they feasted their eyes on the marvels of tropical life, then first\r\nrevealed to them in their luxuriance--vampires "as large as hens,"\r\ncrayfish a foot round, and fireflies lighting the midnight forest.\r\nStarting once more, they had now to feel their way among the rocks and\r\nshoals of the most dangerous waters in the world. They crept round\r\nCelebes among coral reefs and low islands scarcely visible above the\r\nwater-line. The Malacca Straits formed the only route marked in the\r\nPortuguese chart, and between Drake and his apparent passage lay the\r\nJava Sea and the channel between Borneo and Sumatra. But it was not\r\nimpossible that there might be some other opening, and the Pelican\r\ncrawled in search of it along the Java coast. Here, if nowhere else, her\r\nsmall size and manageableness were in her favour. In spite of all the\r\ncare that was taken, she was almost lost. One evening as the black\r\ntropical night was closing, a grating sound was heard under her keel:\r\nanother moment she was hard and fast upon an invisible reef. The breeze\r\nwas light and the water calm, or the world would have heard no more of\r\nFrancis Drake and the Pelican. She lay immovable till morning; "we were\r\nout of all hope to escape danger," but with the daylight the position\r\nwas seen not to be utterly desperate. "Our general, then as always,\r\nshowed himself most courageous, and of good confidence in the mercy and\r\nprotection of God; and as he would not seem to perish wilfully, so he\r\nand we did our best endeavour to save ourselves, and in the end cleared\r\nourselves of that danger."\r\n\r\nThe Pelican had no more adventures; and sweeping in clear fine weather\r\nclose to the Cape of Good Hope, and touching for water at Sierra Leone,\r\nshe sailed in triumph into Plymouth harbour in the beginning of October,\r\nhaving marked a furrow with her keel round the globe.\r\n\r\nFroude: "History of England."\r\n(Adapted)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Who, if he rise to station of command,\r\n    Rises by open means; and there will stand\r\n    On honourable terms, or else retire,\r\n    And in himself possess his own desire;\r\n    Who comprehends his trust, and to the same\r\n    Keeps faithful with a singleness of aim;\r\n    And therefore does not stoop, nor lie in wait\r\n    For wealth, or honours, or for worldly state:\r\n    Whom they must follow; on whose head must fall,\r\n    Like showers of manna, if they come at all.\r\n\r\nWordsworth: "The Happy Warrior."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOLITARY REAPER\r\n\r\n\r\n    Behold her, single in the field,\r\n      Yon solitary Highland Lass!\r\n    Reaping and singing by herself;\r\n      Stop here, or gently pass!\r\n    Alone she cuts and binds the grain,\r\n    And sings a melancholy strain;\r\n    O listen! for the Vale profound\r\n    Is overflowing with the sound.\r\n\r\n    No Nightingale did ever chaunt\r\n      More welcome notes to weary bands\r\n    Of travellers in some shady haunt\r\n      Among Arabian sands:\r\n    A voice so thrilling ne\'er was heard\r\n    In spring-time from the Cuckoo-bird,\r\n    Breaking the silence of the seas\r\n    Among the farthest Hebrides.\r\n\r\n    Will no one tell me what she sings?--\r\n      Perhaps the plaintive numbers flow\r\n    For old, unhappy, far-off things,\r\n      And battles long ago:\r\n    Or is it some more humble lay,\r\n    Familiar matter of to-day?\r\n    Some natural sorrow, loss, or pain,\r\n    That has been, and may be again?\r\n\r\n    Whate\'er the theme, the Maiden sang\r\n      As if her song could have no ending;\r\n    I saw her singing at her work,\r\n      And o\'er the sickle bending;--\r\n    I listened, motionless and still;\r\n    And, as I mounted up the hill,\r\n    The music in my heart I bore\r\n    Long after it was heard no more.\r\n\r\nWordsworth\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLOUDS, RAINS, AND RIVERS\r\n\r\n\r\nEvery occurrence in Nature is preceded by other occurrences which are\r\nits causes, and succeeded by others which are its effects. The human\r\nmind is not satisfied with observing and studying any natural occurrence\r\nalone, but takes pleasure in connecting every natural fact with what has\r\ngone before it, and with what is to come after it. Thus, when we enter\r\nupon the study of rivers, our interest will be greatly increased by\r\ntaking into account, not only their actual appearances but also their\r\ncauses and effects.\r\n\r\nLet us trace a river to its source. Beginning where it empties itself\r\ninto the sea, and following it backwards, we find it from time to time\r\njoined by tributaries which swell its waters. The river, of course,\r\nbecomes smaller as these tributaries are passed. It shrinks first to a\r\nbrook, then to a stream; this again divides itself into a number of\r\nsmaller streamlets, ending in mere threads of water. These constitute\r\nthe source of the river, and are usually found among hills. Thus, the\r\nSevern has its source in the Welsh Mountains; the Thames in the Cotswold\r\nHills; the Rhine and the Rhone in the Alps; the Missouri in the Rocky\r\nMountains; and the Amazon in the Andes of Peru.\r\n\r\nBut it is quite plain, that we have not yet reached the real beginning\r\nof the rivers. Whence do the earliest streams derive their water? A\r\nbrief residence among the mountains would prove to you that they are fed\r\nby rains. In dry weather you would find the streams feeble, sometimes\r\nindeed quite dried up. In wet weather you would see them foaming\r\ntorrents. In general these streams lose themselves as little threads of\r\nwater upon the hillsides; but sometimes you may trace a river to a\r\ndefinite spring. You may, however, very soon assure yourself that such\r\nsprings are also fed by rain, which has percolated through the rocks or\r\nsoil, and which, through some orifice that it has found or formed, comes\r\nto the light of day.\r\n\r\nBut we cannot end here. Whence comes the rain which forms the mountain\r\nstreams? Observation enables you to answer the question. Rain does not\r\ncome from a clear sky. It comes from clouds. But what are clouds? Is\r\nthere nothing you are acquainted with, which they resemble? You discover\r\nat once a likeness between them and the condensed steam of a locomotive.\r\nAt every puff of the engine, a cloud is projected into the air. Watch\r\nthe cloud sharply: you notice that it first forms at a little distance\r\nfrom the top of the funnel. Give close attention, and you will sometimes\r\nsee a perfectly clear space between the funnel and the cloud. Through\r\nthat clear space the thing which makes the cloud must pass. What, then,\r\nis this thing which at one moment is transparent and invisible, and at\r\nthe next moment visible as a dense opaque cloud?\r\n\r\nIt is the _steam_ or _vapour of water_ from the boiler. Within the\r\nboiler this steam is transparent and invisible; but to keep it in this\r\ninvisible state a heat would be required as great as that within the\r\nboiler. When the vapour mingles with the cold air above the hot funnel,\r\nit ceases to be vapour. Every bit of steam shrinks, when chilled, to a\r\nmuch more minute particle of water. The liquid particles thus produced\r\nform a kind of _water-dust_ of exceeding fineness, which floats in the\r\nair, and is called a _cloud_.\r\n\r\nWatch the cloud-banner from the funnel of a running locomotive; you see\r\nit growing gradually less dense. It finally melts away altogether; and\r\nif you continue your observations, you will not fail to notice that the\r\nspeed of its disappearance depends upon the character of the day. In\r\nhumid weather the cloud hangs long and lazily in the air; in dry weather\r\nit is rapidly licked up. What has become of it? It has been reconverted\r\ninto true invisible vapour.\r\n\r\nThe _drier_ the air, and the _hotter_ the air, the greater is the amount\r\nof cloud which can be thus dissolved in it. When the cloud first forms,\r\nits quantity is far greater than the air is able to maintain in an\r\ninvisible state. But, as the cloud mixes gradually with a larger mass of\r\nair, it is more and more dissolved, and finally passes altogether from\r\nthe condition of a finely-divided liquid into that of transparent vapour\r\nor gas.\r\n\r\nMake the lid of a kettle air-tight, and permit the steam to issue from\r\nthe spout; a cloud is formed in all respects similar to that issuing\r\nfrom the funnel of the locomotive. To produce the cloud, in the case of\r\nthe locomotive and the kettle, _heat_ is necessary. By heating the water\r\nwe first convert it into steam, and then by chilling the steam we\r\nconvert it into cloud. Is there any fire in Nature which produces the\r\nclouds of our atmosphere? There is: the fire of the sun.\r\n\r\nWhen the sunbeams fall upon the earth, they heat it, and also the water\r\nwhich lies on its surface, whether it be in large bodies, such as seas\r\nor rivers, or in the form of moisture. The water being thus warmed, a\r\npart of it is given off in the form of aqueous vapour, just as invisible\r\nvapour passes off from a boiler when the water in it is heated by fire.\r\nThis vapour mingles with the air in contact with the earth. The\r\nvapour-charged air, being heated by the warm earth, expands, becomes\r\nlighter, and rises. It expands also, as it rises, because the pressure\r\nof the air above it becomes less and less with the height it attains.\r\nBut an expanding body always becomes colder as the result of its\r\nexpansion. Thus the vapour-laden air is chilled by its expansion. It is\r\nalso chilled by coming in contact with the colder, higher air. The\r\nconsequence is that the invisible vapour which it contains is chilled,\r\nand forms into tiny water-drops, like the steam from a kettle or the\r\nfunnel of the locomotive. And so, as the air rises and becomes colder,\r\nthe vapour gathers into visible masses, which we call clouds.\r\n\r\nThis ascending moist air might become chilled, too, by meeting with a\r\ncurrent of cold, dry air, and then clouds would be formed; and should\r\nthis chilling process continue in either case until the water-drops\r\nbecome heavier than the surrounding air, they would fall to the earth as\r\nraindrops. Rain is, therefore, but a further stage in the condensation\r\nof aqueous vapour caused by the chilling of the air.\r\n\r\nMountains also assist in the formation of clouds. When a wind laden with\r\nmoisture strikes against a mountain, it is tilted and flows up its side.\r\nThe air expands as it rises, the vapour is chilled and becomes visible\r\nin the form of clouds, and if sufficiently chilled, it comes down to the\r\nearth in the form of rain, hail, or snow.\r\n\r\nThus, by tracing a river backwards, from its end to its real beginning,\r\nwe come at length to the sun; for it is the sun that produces aqueous\r\nvapour, from which, as we have seen, clouds are formed, and it is from\r\nclouds that water falls to the earth to become the sources of rivers.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, rivers which have sources somewhat different from\r\nthose just mentioned. They do not begin by driblets on a hillside, nor\r\ncan they be traced to a spring. Go, for example, to the mouth of the\r\nriver Rhone, and trace it backwards. You come at length to the Lake of\r\nGeneva, from which the river rushes, and which you might be disposed to\r\nregard as the source of the Rhone. But go to the head of the lake, and\r\nyou find that the Rhone there enters it; that the lake is, in fact, an\r\nexpansion of the river. Follow this upwards; you find it joined by\r\nsmaller rivers from the mountains right and left. Pass these, and push\r\nyour journey higher still. You come at length to a huge mass of ice--the\r\nend of a glacier--which fills the Rhone valley, and from the bottom of\r\nthe glacier the river rushes. In the glacier of the Rhone you thus find\r\nthe source of the river Rhone.\r\n\r\nBut whence come the glaciers? Wherever lofty mountains, like the Alps,\r\nrise into the high parts of the atmosphere where the temperature is\r\nbelow the freezing-point, the vapour condensed from the air falls upon\r\nthem, not as rain, but as snow. In such high mountainous regions, the\r\nheat of the summer melts the snow from the lower hills, but the higher\r\nparts remain covered, for the heat cannot melt all the snow which falls\r\nthere in a year. When a considerable depth of snow has accumulated, the\r\npressure upon the lower layers squeezes them into a firm mass, and after\r\na time the snow begins to slide down the slope of the mountain. It\r\npasses downward from one slope to another, joined continually by other\r\nsliding masses from neighbouring slopes, until they all unite into one\r\nlong tongue, which creeps slowly down some valley to a point where it\r\nmelts. This tongue from the snow-fields is called a glacier.\r\n\r\nWithout solar fire, therefore, we could have no atmospheric vapour,\r\nwithout vapour no clouds, without clouds no snow, and without snow no\r\nglaciers. Curious then as the conclusion may be, the cold ice of the\r\nAlps has its origin in this heat of the sun.\r\n\r\nTyndall: "The Forms of Water."\r\n(Adapted)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    For what are men better than sheep or goats\r\n    That nourish a blind life within the brain,\r\n    If, knowing God, they lift not hands of prayer\r\n    Both for themselves and those who call them friend?\r\n\r\nTennyson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFITZ-JAMES AND RODERICK DHU\r\n\r\n\r\n    The Chief in silence strode before,\r\n    And reached that torrent\'s sounding shore,\r\n    Which, daughter of three mighty lakes,\r\n    From Vennachar in silver breaks,\r\n    Sweeps through the plain, and ceaseless mines\r\n    On Bochastle the mouldering lines,\r\n    Where Rome, the Empress of the world,\r\n    Of yore her eagle wings unfurled.\r\n    And here his course the Chieftain staid,\r\n    Threw down his target and his plaid,\r\n    And to the Lowland warrior said--\r\n    "Bold Saxon! to his promise just,\r\n    Vich Alpine has discharged his trust.\r\n    This murderous Chief, this ruthless man,\r\n    This head of a rebellious clan,\r\n    Hath led thee safe, through watch and ward,\r\n    Far past Clan-Alpine\'s outmost guard.\r\n    Now, man to man, and steel to steel,\r\n    A Chieftain\'s vengeance thou shalt feel.\r\n    See here, all vantageless I stand,\r\n    Armed, like thyself, with single brand:\r\n    For this is Coilantogle ford,\r\n    And thou must keep thee with thy sword."\r\n\r\n    The Saxon paused:--"I ne\'er delayed,\r\n    When foeman bade me draw my blade;\r\n    Nay, more, brave Chief, I vowed thy death:\r\n    Yet sure thy fair and generous faith,\r\n    And my deep debt for life preserved,\r\n    A better meed have well deserved:\r\n    Can nought but blood our feud atone?\r\n    Are there no means?"--"No, Stranger, none;\r\n    And hear,--to fire thy flagging zeal,--\r\n    The Saxon cause rests on thy steel;\r\n    For thus spoke Fate, by prophet bred\r\n    Between the living and the dead:\r\n    \'Who spills the foremost foeman\'s life,\r\n    His party conquers in the strife.\'"--\r\n    "Then, by my word," the Saxon said,\r\n    "The riddle is already read.\r\n    Seek yonder brake beneath the cliff,--\r\n    There lies Red Murdoch, stark and stiff.\r\n    Thus Fate has solved her prophecy,\r\n    Then yield to Fate, and not to me.\r\n    To James, at Stirling, let us go,\r\n    When, if thou wilt be still his foe,\r\n    Or if the King shall not agree\r\n    To grant thee grace and favour free,\r\n    I plight mine honour, oath, and word,\r\n    That, to thy native strengths restored,\r\n    With each advantage shalt thou stand,\r\n    That aids thee now to guard thy land."\r\n\r\n    Dark lightning flashed from Roderick\'s eye--\r\n    "Soars thy presumption, then, so high,\r\n    Because a wretched kern ye slew,\r\n    Homage to name to Roderick Dhu?\r\n    He yields not, he, to man nor Fate!\r\n    Thou add\'st but fuel to my hate:--\r\n    My clansman\'s blood demands revenge.\r\n    Not yet prepared?--By heaven, I change\r\n    My thought, and hold thy valour light\r\n    As that of some vain carpet knight,\r\n    Who ill deserved my courteous care,\r\n    And whose best boast is but to wear\r\n    A braid of his fair lady\'s hair."--\r\n    "I thank thee, Roderick, for the word!\r\n    It nerves my heart, it steels my sword;\r\n    For I have sworn this braid to stain\r\n    In the best blood that warms thy vein.\r\n    Now, truce, farewell!

Squeers, a vulgar, crafty despot, is head of\r\nDotheboys Hall. Nicholas is an usher or undermaster in the school;\r\nSmike, a little, friendless, starved pupil who has run away to escape\r\nfrom drudgery and harshness.)\r\n\r\n\r\n"He is off," said Mrs. Squeers. "The cow-house and stable are locked up,\r\nso he can\'t be there; and he\'s not down-stairs anywhere, for the girl\r\nhas looked. He must have gone York way, and by a public road, too."\r\n\r\n"Why must he?" inquired Squeers.\r\n\r\n"Stupid!" said Mrs. Squeers, angrily. "He hadn\'t any money, had he?"\r\n\r\n"Never had a penny of his own in his whole life, that I know of,"\r\nreplied Squeers.\r\n\r\n"To be sure," rejoined Mrs. Squeers, "and he didn\'t take anything to eat\r\nwith him; that I\'ll answer for. Ha! ha! ha!"\r\n\r\n"Ha! ha! ha!" laughed Squeers.\r\n\r\n"Then, of course," said Mrs. S., "he must beg his way, and he could do\r\nthat nowhere but on the public road."\r\n\r\n"That\'s true," exclaimed Squeers, clapping his hands.\r\n\r\n"True! yes; but you would never have thought of it for all that, if I\r\nhadn\'t said so," replied his wife. "Now, if you take the chaise and go\r\none road, and I borrow Swallow\'s chaise and go the other, what with\r\nkeeping our eyes open, and asking questions, one or other of us is\r\npretty sure to lay hold of him."\r\n\r\nThe worthy lady\'s plan was adopted and put in execution without a\r\nmoment\'s delay. After a hasty breakfast, and the prosecution of some\r\ninquiries in the village, the result of which seemed to show that he was\r\non the right track, Squeers started forth in the pony-chaise, intent\r\nupon discovery and vengeance. Shortly afterwards, Mrs. Squeers, arrayed\r\nin the white topcoat and tied up in various shawls and handkerchiefs,\r\nissued forth in another chaise in another direction, taking with her a\r\ngood-sized bludgeon, several odd pieces of strong cord, and a stout\r\nlabouring man; all provided and carried upon the expedition with the\r\nsole object of assisting in the capture, and (once caught) insuring the\r\nsafe custody of the unfortunate Smike.\r\n\r\nNicholas remained behind, in a tumult of feeling, sensible that whatever\r\nmight be the upshot of the boy\'s flight, nothing but painful and\r\ndeplorable consequences were likely to ensue from it. Death, from want\r\nand exposure to the weather, was the best that could be expected from\r\nthe protracted wanderings of so poor and helpless a creature, alone and\r\nunfriended, through a country of which he was wholly ignorant. There was\r\nlittle, perhaps, to choose between this fate and a return to the tender\r\nmercies of the Yorkshire school: but the unhappy being had established a\r\nhold upon his sympathy and compassion, which made his heart ache at the\r\nprospect of the suffering he was destined to undergo. He lingered on in\r\nrestless anxiety, picturing a thousand possibilities, until the evening\r\nof the next day when Squeers returned alone and unsuccessful.\r\n\r\n"No news of the scamp!" said the schoolmaster, who had evidently been\r\nstretching his legs, on the old principle, not a few times during the\r\njourney. "I\'ll have consolation for this out of somebody, Nickleby, if\r\nMrs. Squeers don\'t hunt him down. So I give you fair warning."\r\n\r\n"It is not in my power to console you, sir," said Nicholas. "It is\r\nnothing to me."\r\n\r\n"Isn\'t it?" said Squeers, in a threatening manner. "We shall see!"\r\n\r\n"We shall," rejoined Nicholas.\r\n\r\n"Here\'s the pony run right off his legs, and me obliged to come home\r\nwith a hack cob, that\'ll cost fifteen shillings besides other expenses,"\r\nsaid Squeers; "who\'s to pay for that, do you hear?"\r\n\r\nNicholas shrugged his shoulders and remained silent.\r\n\r\n"I\'ll have it out of somebody, I tell you," said Squeers, his usual\r\nharsh, crafty manner changed to open bullying. "None of your whining\r\nvapourings here, Mr. Puppy: but be off to your kennel, for it\'s past\r\nyour bed-time! Come, get out!"\r\n\r\nNicholas bit his lip and knit his hands involuntarily, for his finger\r\nends tingled to avenge the insult; but remembering that the man was\r\ndrunk, and that it could come to little but a noisy brawl, he contented\r\nhimself with darting a contemptuous look at the tyrant and walked, as\r\nmajestically as he could, upstairs, and sternly resolved that the\r\noutstanding account between himself and Mr. Squeers should be settled\r\nrather more speedily than the latter anticipated.\r\n\r\nAnother day came, and Nicholas was scarcely awake when he heard the\r\nwheels of a chaise approaching the house. It stopped. The voice of Mrs.\r\nSqueers was heard, and in exultation, ordering a glass of spirits for\r\nsomebody, which was in itself a sufficient sign that something\r\nextraordinary had happened. Nicholas hardly dared to look out of the\r\nwindow; but he did so, and the very first object that met his eyes was\r\nthe wretched Smike; so bedabbled with mud and rain, so haggard and worn,\r\nand wild, that, but for his garments being such as no scarecrow was ever\r\nseen to wear, he might have been doubtful, even then, of his identity.\r\n\r\n"Lift him out," said Squeers, after he had literally feasted his eyes in\r\nsilence upon the culprit. "Bring him in; bring him in!"\r\n\r\n"Take care," cried Mrs. Squeers, as her husband proffered his\r\nassistance. "We tied his legs under the apron and made \'em fast to the\r\nchaise, to prevent him giving us the slip again."\r\n\r\nWith hands trembling with delight, Squeers unloosed the cord; and Smike,\r\nto all appearances more dead than alive, was brought into the house and\r\nsecurely locked up in a cellar, until such time as Mr. Squeers should\r\ndeem it expedient to operate upon him, in the presence of the assembled\r\nschool.\r\n\r\nThe news that Smike had been caught and brought back in triumph ran like\r\nwild fire through the hungry community, and expectation was on tiptoe\r\nall morning. On tiptoe it was destined to remain, however, until\r\nafternoon; when Squeers, having refreshed himself with his dinner and\r\nfurther strengthened himself by an extra libation or so, made his\r\nappearance (accompanied by his amiable partner) with a countenance of\r\nportentous import, and a fearful instrument of flagellation, strong,\r\nsupple, wax-ended, and new--in short, purchased that morning expressly\r\nfor the occasion.\r\n\r\n"Is every boy here?" asked Squeers, in a tremendous voice.\r\n\r\nEvery boy was there, but every boy was afraid to speak; so Squeers\r\nglared along the lines to assure himself; and every eye dropped, and\r\nevery head cowered down, as he did so.\r\n\r\n"Each boy keep his place," said Squeers, administering his favourite\r\nblow to the desk and regarding with gloomy satisfaction the universal\r\nstart it never failed to occasion.\r\n\r\n"Nickleby! to your desk, sir."\r\n\r\nIt was remarked by more than one small observer that there was a very\r\ncurious and unusual expression in the usher\'s face; but he took his seat\r\nwithout opening his lips in reply. Squeers, casting a triumphant glance\r\nat his assistant and a look of most comprehensive despotism on the boys,\r\nleft the room, and shortly afterward returned, dragging Smike by the\r\ncollar--or rather by that fragment of his jacket which was nearest to\r\nthe place where his collar would have been, had he boasted such a\r\ndecoration.\r\n\r\nIn any other place, the appearance of the wretched, jaded, spiritless\r\nobject would have occasioned a murmur of compassion and remonstrance. It\r\nhad some effect even there; for the lookers-on moved uneasily in their\r\nseats; and a few of the boldest ventured to steal looks at each other,\r\nexpressive of indignation and pity.\r\n\r\nThey were lost on Squeers, however, whose gaze was fastened on the\r\nluckless Smike, as he inquired, according to custom in such cases,\r\nwhether he had anything to say for himself.\r\n\r\n"Nothing, I suppose?" said Squeers, with a diabolical grin.\r\n\r\nSmike glanced round, and his eyes rested for an instant on Nicholas, as\r\nif he had expected him to intercede; but his look was riveted on his\r\ndesk.\r\n\r\n"Have you anything to say?" demanded Squeers again, giving his right arm\r\ntwo or three flourishes to try its power and suppleness.\r\n\r\n"Stand a little out of the way, Mrs. Squeers, my dear; I\'ve hardly got\r\nenough room."\r\n\r\n"Spare me, sir!" cried Smike.\r\n\r\n"Oh! that\'s all, is it?" said Squeers. "Yes, I\'ll flog you within an\r\ninch of your life, and spare you that."\r\n\r\n"Ha! ha! ha!" laughed Mrs. Squeers, "that\'s a good un!"\r\n\r\n"I was driven to it," said Smike, faintly; and casting another imploring\r\nlook about him.\r\n\r\n"Driven to it, were you?" said Squeers. "Oh! it wasn\'t your fault; it\r\nwas mine, I suppose--eh?"\r\n\r\n"A nasty, ungrateful, pig-headed, brutish, obstinate, sneaking dog,"\r\nexclaimed Mrs. Squeers, taking Smike\'s head under her arm and\r\nadministering a cuff at every epithet; "what does he mean by that?"\r\n\r\n"Stand aside, my dear," replied Squeers. "We\'ll try and find out."\r\n\r\nMrs. Squeers being out of breath with her exertions, complied. Squeers\r\ncaught the boy firmly in his grip; one desperate cut had fallen on his\r\nbody--he was wincing from the lash and uttering a scream of pain--it was\r\nraised again, and again about to fall--when Nicholas Nickleby, suddenly\r\nstarting up, cried "Stop!" in a voice that made the rafters ring.\r\n\r\n"Who cried stop?" asked Squeers, turning savagely round.\r\n\r\n"I," said Nicholas, stepping forward. "This must not go on."\r\n\r\n"Must not go on!" cried Squeers, almost in a shriek.\r\n\r\n"No!" thundered Nicholas.\r\n\r\nAghast and stupefied at the boldness of the interference, Squeers\r\nreleased his hold of Smike, and, falling back a pace, gazed upon\r\nNicholas with looks that were positively frightful.\r\n\r\n"I say must not," repeated Nicholas, nothing daunted; "shall not, I will\r\nprevent it."\r\n\r\nSqueers continued to gaze upon him with his eyes starting out of his\r\nhead; but astonishment had actually for the moment bereft him of\r\nspeech.\r\n\r\n"You have disregarded all my quiet interference in this miserable lad\'s\r\nbehalf," said Nicholas; "you have returned no answer to the letter in\r\nwhich I begged forgiveness for him and offered to be responsible that he\r\nwould remain quietly here. Don\'t blame me for this public interference.\r\nYou have brought it upon yourself; not I."\r\n\r\n"Sit down, beggar!" screamed Squeers, almost beside himself with rage,\r\nand seizing Smike as he spoke.\r\n\r\n"Wretch," rejoined Nicholas, fiercely, "touch him at your peril! I will\r\nnot stand by and see it done. My blood is up, and I have the strength of\r\nten such men as you. Look to yourself, for by Heaven I will not spare\r\nyou, if you drive me on!"\r\n\r\n"Stand back!" cried Squeers, brandishing his weapon.\r\n\r\n"I have a long series of insults to avenge," said Nicholas, flushed with\r\npassion; "and my indignation is aggravated by the dastardly cruelties\r\npractised on helpless infancy in this foul den. Have a care; for if you\r\ndo raise the devil within me, the consequences shall fall heavily upon\r\nyour own head!"\r\n\r\nHe had scarcely spoken, when Squeers in a violent outbreak of wrath,\r\nand with a cry like the howl of a wild beast, spat upon him and struck\r\nhim a blow across the face with his instrument of torture, which raised\r\na bar of livid flesh as it was inflicted. Smarting with the agony of the\r\nblow, and concentrating into that one moment all his feelings of rage,\r\nscorn, and indignation, Nicholas sprang upon him, wrested the weapon\r\nfrom his hand, and pinning him by the throat beat the ruffian till he\r\nroared for mercy.\r\n\r\nThe boys--with the exception of Master Squeers, who, coming to his\r\nfather\'s assistance, harassed the enemy in the rear--moved not hand or\r\nfoot; but Mrs. Squeers, with many shrieks for aid, hung on to the tail\r\nof her partner\'s coat and endeavoured to drag him from his infuriated\r\nadversary; while Miss Squeers, who had been peeping through the keyhole\r\nin the expectation of a very different scene, darted in at the very\r\nbeginning of the attack, and after launching a shower of inkstands at\r\nthe usher\'s head, beat Nicholas to her heart\'s content; animating\r\nherself, at every blow, with the recollection of his having refused her\r\nproffered love, and thus imparting additional strength to an arm which\r\n(as she took after her mother in this respect) was, at no time, of the\r\nweakest.\r\n\r\nNicholas, in the full strength of his violence, felt the blows no more\r\nthan if they had been dealt with feathers; but, becoming tired of the\r\nnoise and uproar, and feeling that his arm grew weaker besides, he threw\r\nall his remaining strength into half a dozen finishing cuts, and flung\r\nSqueers from him, with all the force he could muster. The violence of\r\nhis fall precipitated Mrs. Squeers completely over an adjacent form;\r\nSqueers, striking his head against it in his descent, lay at his full\r\nlength on the ground, stunned and motionless.\r\n\r\nHaving brought affairs to this happy termination, and ascertained, to\r\nhis thorough satisfaction, that Squeers was only stunned, and not dead\r\n(upon which point he had some unpleasant doubts at first), Nicholas left\r\nhis family to restore him, and retired to consider what course he had\r\nbetter adopt. He looked anxiously round for Smike, as he left the room,\r\nbut he was nowhere to be seen.\r\n\r\nAfter a brief consideration, he packed up a few clothes in a small\r\nvalise, and, finding that nobody offered to oppose his progress, marched\r\nboldly out by the front door, and, shortly afterward, struck into the\r\nroad which led to the Greta Bridge.\r\n\r\nDickens: "Nicholas Nickleby."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDICKENS IN THE CAMP\r\n\r\n\r\n    Above the pines the moon was slowly drifting,\r\n        The river sang below;\r\n    The dim Sierras, far beyond, uplifting\r\n        Their minarets of snow.\r\n\r\n    The roaring camp-fire, with rude humour, painted\r\n        The ruddy tints of health\r\n    On haggard face and form that drooped and fainted\r\n        In the fierce race for wealth;\r\n\r\n    Till one arose, and from his pack\'s scant treasure\r\n        A hoarded volume drew,\r\n    And cards were dropped from hands of listless leisure\r\n        To hear the tale anew.\r\n\r\n    And then, while round them shadows gathered faster,\r\n        And as the firelight fell,\r\n    He read aloud the book wherein the Master\r\n        Had writ of "Little Nell."\r\n\r\n    Perhaps \'twas boyish fancy,--for the reader\r\n        Was youngest of them all,--\r\n    But, as he read, from clustering pine and cedar\r\n        A silence seemed to fall;\r\n\r\n    The fir trees, gathering closer in the shadows,\r\n        Listened in every spray,\r\n    While the whole camp, with "Nell" on English meadows,\r\n        Wandered and lost their way.\r\n\r\n    And so in mountain solitudes--o\'ertaken\r\n        As by some spell divine--\r\n    Their cares dropped from them like the needles shaken\r\n        From out the gusty pine.\r\n\r\n    Lost is that camp and wasted all its fire:\r\n        And he who wrought that spell?--\r\n    Ah! towering pine and stately Kentish spire,\r\n        Ye have one tale to tell!\r\n\r\n    Lost is that camp, but let its fragrant story\r\n        Blend with the breath that thrills\r\n    With hopvines\' incense all the pensive glory\r\n        That fills the Kentish hills.\r\n\r\n    And on that grave where English oak, and holly,\r\n        And laurel wreaths entwine,\r\n    Deem it not all a too presumptuous folly,--\r\n        This spray of Western pine!\r\n\r\nBret Harte\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDOST THOU LOOK BACK ON WHAT HATH BEEN\r\n\r\n\r\n    Dost thou look back on what hath been,\r\n      As some divinely gifted man,\r\n      Whose life in low estate began\r\n    And on a simple village green;\r\n\r\n    Who breaks his birth\'s invidious bar,\r\n      And grasps the skirts of happy chance,\r\n      And breasts the blows of circumstance,\r\n    And grapples with his evil star;\r\n\r\n    Who makes by force his merit known,\r\n      And lives to clutch the golden keys,\r\n      To mould a mighty state\'s decrees,\r\n    And shape the whisper of the throne;\r\n\r\n    And moving up from high to higher,\r\n      Becomes on Fortune\'s crowning slope\r\n      The pillar of a people\'s hope,\r\n    The centre of a world\'s desire;\r\n\r\n    Yet feels, as in a pensive dream,\r\n      When all his active powers are still,\r\n      A distant dearness in the hill,\r\n    A secret sweetness in the stream,\r\n\r\n    The limit of his narrower fate,\r\n      While yet beside its vocal springs\r\n      He played at counsellors and kings,\r\n    With one that was his earliest mate;\r\n\r\n    Who ploughs with pain his native lea,\r\n      And reaps the labour of his hands,\r\n      Or in the furrow musing stands;\r\n    "Does my old friend remember me?"\r\n\r\nTennyson: "In Memoriam, LXIV."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PASSING OF ARTHUR\r\n\r\n\r\nAnd so both hosts dressed them together. And king Arthur took his horse,\r\nand said, Alas this unhappy day, and so rode to his party: and Sir\r\nMordred in like wise. And never was there seen a more dolefuller battle\r\nin any Christian land. For there was but rushing and riding, foining and\r\nstriking, and many a grim word was there spoken either to other, and\r\nmany a deadly stroke. But ever king Arthur rode throughout the battle\r\nof Sir Mordred many times, and did full nobly as a noble king should;\r\nand at all times he fainted never. And Sir Mordred that day put him in\r\ngreat peril. And thus they fought all the long day, and never stinted,\r\ntill the noble knights were laid to the cold ground, and ever they\r\nfought still, till it was near night, and by that time was there an\r\nhundred thousand laid dead upon the down.\r\n\r\nThen was Arthur wroth out of measure, when he saw his people so slain\r\nfrom him. Then the king looked about him, and then was he ware of all\r\nhis host, and of all his good knights, were left no more alive but two\r\nknights, that was Sir Lucan de Butlere, and his brother Sir Bedivere:\r\nand they full were sore wounded. Jesu mercy, said the king, where are\r\nall my noble knights becomen. Alas that ever I should see this doleful\r\nday. For now, said Arthur, I am come to mine end. But would to God that\r\nI wist where were that traitor Sir Mordred, that hath caused all this\r\nmischief. Then was king Arthur ware where Sir Mordred leaned upon his\r\nsword among a great heap of dead men. Now give me my spear, said Arthur\r\nunto Sir Lucan, for yonder I have espied the traitor that all this woe\r\nhath wrought.\r\n\r\nThen the king gat his spear in both his hands, and ran toward Sir\r\nMordred, crying, Traitor, now is thy death day come. And when Sir\r\nMordred heard Sir Arthur, he ran until him with his sword drawn in his\r\nhand. And then king Arthur smote Sir Mordred under the shield, with a\r\nfoin of his spear throughout the body more than a fathom. And when Sir\r\nMordred felt that he had his death\'s wound, he thrust himself, with the\r\nmight that he had, up to the bur of king Arthur\'s spear. And right so he\r\nsmote Arthur with his sword holden in both his hands, on the side of the\r\nhead, that the sword pierced the helmet and the brain-pan, and\r\ntherewithal Sir Mordred fell stark dead to the earth. And the noble\r\nArthur fell in a swoon to the earth, and there he swooned oft-times. And\r\nSir Lucan de Butlere and Sir Bedivere oft-times heaved him up, and so\r\nweakly they led him betwixt them both to a little chapel not far from\r\nthe sea side.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Lucan took up the king the one part, and Sir Bedivere the other\r\npart, and in the lifting, the king swooned, and Sir Lucan fell in a\r\nswoon with the lift and therewith the noble knight\'s heart burst. And\r\nwhen king Arthur came to himself again, he beheld Sir Lucan how he lay\r\nfoaming at the mouth. Alas, said the king, this is unto me a full heavy\r\nsight to see this noble duke so die for my sake, for he would have\r\nholpen me that had more need of help than I. Alas, he would not complain\r\nhim, his heart was so set to help me. Now Jesu have mercy upon his soul.\r\nThen Sir Bedivere wept for the death of his brother. Leave this mourning\r\nand weeping, said the king, for all this will not avail me: for, wit\r\nthou well, and I might live myself the death of Sir Lucan would grieve\r\nme evermore; but my time hieth fast, said the king.\r\n\r\nTherefore, said Arthur, take thou Excalibur, my good sword, and go with\r\nit to yonder water side, and when thou comest there, I charge thee throw\r\nmy sword in that water, and come again, and tell me what thou there\r\nseest. My lord, said Bedivere, your commandment shall be done, and\r\nlightly bring you word again. So Sir Bedivere departed, and by the way\r\nhe beheld that noble sword, that the pommel and haft were all of\r\nprecious stones, and then he said to himself, If I throw this rich sword\r\nin the water, thereof shall never come good, but harm and loss. And then\r\nSir Bedivere hid Excalibur under a tree. And as soon as he might he\r\ncame again unto the king, and said he had been at the water, and had\r\nthrown the sword into the water. What sawest thou there? said the king.\r\nSir, he said, I saw nothing but waves and winds. That is untruly said of\r\nthee, said the king; therefore go thou lightly again, and do my command\r\nas thou art to me lief and dear, spare not, but throw it in.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Bedivere returned again, and took the sword in his hand; and\r\nthen him thought sin and shame to throw away that noble sword; and so\r\neft he hid the sword, and returned again, and told to the king that he\r\nhad been at the water, and done his commandment. What sawest thou there?\r\nsaid the king. Sir, he said, I saw nothing but the waters wap and the\r\nwaves wan. Ah traitor, untrue, said king Arthur, now hast thou betrayed\r\nme twice. Who would have wend that thou that hast been to me so lief and\r\ndear, and thou art named a noble knight, and would betray me for the\r\nriches of the sword. But now go again lightly, for thy long tarrying\r\nputteth me in great jeopardy of my life, for I have taken cold. And\r\nunless if thou do now as I bid thee, if ever I may see thee, I shall\r\nslay thee with mine own hands, for thou wouldest for my rich sword see\r\nme dead.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Bedivere departed, and went to the sword, and lightly took it\r\nup, and went to the water side, and there he bound the girdle about the\r\nhilts, and then he threw the sword as far into the water as he might,\r\nand there came an arm and an hand above the water, and met it, and\r\ncaught it, and so shook it thrice and brandished, and then vanished away\r\nthe hand with the sword in the water. So Sir Bedivere came again to the\r\nking, and told him what he saw. Alas, said the king, help me hence, for\r\nI dread me I have tarried over long.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Bedivere took the king upon his back, and so went with him to\r\nthat water side. And when they were at the water side, even fast by the\r\nbank hoved a little barge, with many fair ladies in it, and among them\r\nall was a queen, and all they had black hoods, and all they wept and\r\nshrieked when they saw king Arthur. Now put me into the barge, said the\r\nking: and so he did softly. And there received him three queens with\r\ngreat mourning, and so they set him down, and in one of their laps king\r\nArthur laid his head, and then that queen said, Ah, dear brother, why\r\nhave ye tarried so long from me? Alas, this wound on your head hath\r\ncaught over much cold. And so then they rowed from the land; and Sir\r\nBedivere beheld all those ladies go from him.\r\n\r\nThen Sir Bedivere cried, Ah, my lord Arthur, what shall become of me now\r\nye go from me, and leave me here alone among mine enemies. Comfort\r\nthyself, said the king, and do as well as thou mayest, for in me is no\r\ntrust for to trust in. For I will into the vale of Avilion, to heal me\r\nof my grievous wound. And if thou hear never more of me, pray for my\r\nsoul. But ever the queens and the ladies wept and shrieked, that it was\r\npity to hear. And as soon as Sir Bedivere had lost the sight of the\r\nbarge, he wept and wailed, and so took the forest.\r\n\r\nSir Thomas Malory\r\nRead: Tennyson\'s Morte D\'Arthur.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ARMADA\r\n\r\n\r\n    Attend, all ye who list to hear our noble\r\n      England\'s praise;\r\n    I tell of the thrice famous deeds she wrought\r\n      in ancient days,\r\n    When that great fleet invincible against her\r\n      bore in vain\r\n    The richest spoils of Mexico, the stoutest\r\n      hearts of Spain.\r\n    It was about the lovely close of a warm summer\r\n      day,\r\n    There came a gallant merchant-ship full sail\r\n      to Plymouth Bay;\r\n    Her crew hath seen Castile\'s black fleet,\r\n      beyond Aurigny\'s isle,[2]\r\n    At earliest twilight, on the waves lie heaving\r\n      many a mile.\r\n    At sunrise she escaped their van, by God\'s\r\n      especial grace;\r\n    And the tall Pinta, till the noon, had held\r\n      her close in chase.\r\n    Forthwith a guard at every gun was placed\r\n      along the wall;\r\n    The beacon blazed upon the roof of Edgecumbe\'s\r\n      lofty hall;\r\n    Many a light fishing-bark put out to pry along\r\n      the coast,\r\n    And with loose rein and bloody spur rode inland\r\n      many a post.\r\n    With his white hair unbonneted, the stout old\r\n      sheriff comes;\r\n    Behind him march the halberdiers; before him\r\n      sound the drums;\r\n    His yeomen, round the market-cross, make clear\r\n      an ample space;\r\n    For there behoves him to set up the standard\r\n      of Her Grace.\r\n    And haughtily the trumpets peal, and gaily\r\n      dance the bells,\r\n    As slow upon the labouring wind the royal\r\n      blazon swells.\r\n    Look how the lion of the sea lifts up his\r\n      ancient crown,\r\n    And underneath his deadly paw treads the gay\r\n      lilies down.\r\n    So stalked he when he turned to flight on that\r\n      famed Picard field,[3]\r\n    Bohemia\'s plume, and Genoa\'s bow, and Caesar\'s\r\n      eagle shield:\r\n    So glared he when at Agincourt in wrath he\r\n      turned to bay,\r\n    And crushed and torn beneath his claws the\r\n      princely hunters lay.\r\n    Ho!

England has had many heroes, but never one who so entirely\r\npossessed the love of his fellow-countrymen as Nelson. All men knew that\r\nhis heart was as humane as it was fearless; that there was not in his\r\nnature the slightest alloy of selfishness or cupidity; but that, with\r\nperfect and entire devotion, he served his country with all his heart,\r\nand with all his soul, and with all his strength; and therefore, they\r\nloved him as truly and as fervently as he loved England. They pressed\r\nupon the parapet to gaze after him when his barge pushed off, and he\r\nreturned their cheers by waving his hat. The sentinels, who endeavoured\r\nto prevent them from trespassing upon this ground, were wedged among the\r\ncrowd; and an officer who, not very prudently upon such an occasion,\r\nordered them to drive the people down with their bayonets, was compelled\r\nspeedily to retreat; for the people would not be debarred from gazing\r\ntill the last moment upon the hero--the darling hero of England!\r\n\r\nIt had been part of Nelson\'s prayer, that the British fleet might be\r\ndistinguished by humanity in the victory which he expected. Setting an\r\nexample himself, he twice gave orders to cease firing on the\r\nRedoubtable, supposing that she had struck, because her guns were\r\nsilent; for, as she carried no flag, there was no means of instantly\r\nascertaining the fact. From this ship, which he had thus twice spared,\r\nhe received his death. A ball fired from her mizzen-top, which, in the\r\nthen situation of the two vessels, was not more than fifteen yards from\r\nthat part of the deck where he was standing, struck the epaulet on his\r\nleft shoulder, about a quarter after one, just in the heat of action. He\r\nfell upon his face, on the spot which was covered with his poor\r\nsecretary\'s blood. Hardy, who was a few steps from him, turning round,\r\nsaw three men raising him up. "They have done for me at last, Hardy,"\r\nsaid he. "I hope not," cried Hardy. "Yes," he replied, "my backbone is\r\nshot through." Yet even now, not for a moment losing his presence of\r\nmind, he observed, as they were carrying him down the ladder, that the\r\ntiller ropes, which had been shot away, were not yet replaced, and\r\nordered that new ones should be rove immediately: then, that he might\r\nnot be seen by the crew, he took out his handkerchief, and covered his\r\nface and his stars. Had he but concealed these badges of honour from the\r\nenemy, England, perhaps, would not have had cause to receive with sorrow\r\nthe news of the battle of Trafalgar.\r\n\r\nThe cockpit was crowded with wounded and dying men, over whose bodies he\r\nwas with some difficulty conveyed, and laid upon a pallet in the\r\nmidshipmen\'s berth. It was soon perceived, upon examination, that the\r\nwound was mortal. This, however, was concealed from all except Captain\r\nHardy, the chaplain, and the medical attendants. He himself being\r\ncertain, from the sensation in his back and the gush of blood he felt\r\nmomently within his breast, that no human care could avail him, insisted\r\nthat the surgeon should leave him and attend to those to whom he might\r\nbe useful; "for," said he, "you can do nothing for me." All that could\r\nbe done was to fan him with paper, and frequently to give him lemonade\r\nto alleviate his intense thirst.\r\n\r\nHe was in great pain, and expressed much anxiety for the event of the\r\naction, which now began to declare itself. As often as a ship struck,\r\nthe crew of the Victory hurrahed; and at each hurrah, a visible\r\nexpression of joy gleamed in the eyes and marked the countenance of the\r\ndying hero. But he became impatient to see Hardy; and as that officer,\r\nthough often sent for, could not leave the deck, Nelson feared that some\r\nfatal cause prevented him, and repeatedly cried, "Will no one bring\r\nHardy to me? He must be killed! He is surely dead!"\r\n\r\nAn hour and ten minutes elapsed from the time when Nelson received his\r\nwound, before Hardy could come to him. They shook hands in silence,\r\nHardy in vain struggling to suppress the feelings of that most painful\r\nand yet sublime moment. "Well, Hardy," said Nelson, "how goes the day\r\nwith us?" "Very well," replied Hardy: "ten ships have struck, but five\r\nof the van have tacked and show an intention to bear down upon the\r\nVictory. I have called two or three of our fresh ships round, and have\r\nno doubt of giving them a drubbing." "I hope," said Nelson, "none of our\r\nships have struck." Hardy answered, "There is no fear of that." Then,\r\nand not till then, Nelson spoke of himself. "I am a dead man, Hardy,"\r\nsaid he; "I am going fast; it will be all over with me soon." Hardy\r\nobserved that he hoped Mr. Beatty could yet hold out some prospect of\r\nlife. "Oh, no," he replied; "it is impossible. My back is shot through.\r\nBeatty will tell you so." Hardy then once more shook hands with him,\r\nand, with a heart almost bursting, hastened upon deck.\r\n\r\nBy this time all feeling below the breast was gone, and Nelson, having\r\nmade the surgeon ascertain this, said to him: "You know I am gone. I\r\nknow it. I feel something rising in my breast," putting his hand on his\r\nleft side, "which tells me so." And upon Beatty\'s inquiring whether his\r\npain was very great, he replied, it was so great that he wished he was\r\ndead. "Yet," he added in a lower voice, "one would like to live a little\r\nlonger, too!"\r\n\r\nCaptain Hardy, some fifty minutes after he had left the cockpit,\r\nreturned, and again taking the hand of his dying friend and commander,\r\ncongratulated him on having gained a complete victory. How many of the\r\nenemy were taken he did not know, as it was impossible to perceive them\r\ndistinctly, but fourteen or fifteen at least. "That\'s well," said\r\nNelson; "but I bargained for twenty." And then, in a stronger voice, he\r\nsaid, "Anchor, Hardy, anchor." Hardy, thereupon, hinted that Admiral\r\nCollingwood would take upon himself the direction of affairs. "Not while\r\nI live, Hardy," said the dying Nelson, ineffectually endeavouring to\r\nraise himself from the bed: "do you anchor." His previous orders for\r\npreparing to anchor had shown how clearly he foresaw the necessity for\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nPresently calling Hardy back, he said to him in a low voice, "Don\'t\r\nthrow me overboard:" and he desired that he might be buried beside his\r\nparents, unless it should please the king to order otherwise. Then\r\nreverting to private feelings,--"Kiss me, Hardy," said he. Hardy knelt\r\ndown and kissed his cheek; and Nelson said, "Now I am satisfied. Thank\r\nGod, I have done my duty!" Hardy stood over him in silence for a moment\r\nor two, then knelt again and kissed his forehead. "Who is that?" said\r\nNelson; and being informed, he replied, "God bless you, Hardy." And\r\nHardy then left him for ever.\r\n\r\nNelson now desired to be turned upon his right side, and said, "I wish I\r\nhad not left the deck, for I shall soon be gone." Death was, indeed,\r\nrapidly approaching. His articulation now became difficult, but he was\r\ndistinctly heard to say, "Thank God, I have done my duty!" These words\r\nhe repeatedly pronounced, and they were the last words which he uttered.\r\nHe expired at thirty minutes after four, three hours and a quarter after\r\nhe had received his wound.\r\n\r\nThe death of Nelson was felt in England as something more than a public\r\ncalamity: men started at the intelligence and turned pale, as if they\r\nhad heard of the loss of a near friend. An object of our admiration and\r\naffection, of our pride and of our hopes, was suddenly taken from us;\r\nand it seemed as if we had never till then known how deeply we loved and\r\nreverenced him. What the country had lost in its great naval hero--the\r\ngreatest of our own and of all former times--was scarcely taken into the\r\naccount of grief. So perfectly, indeed, had he performed his part, that\r\nthe maritime war, after the battle of Trafalgar, was considered at an\r\nend. The fleets of the enemy were not merely defeated--they were\r\ndestroyed: new navies must be built, and a new race of seamen reared for\r\nthem, before the possibility of their invading our shores could again\r\nbe contemplated. It was not, therefore, from any selfish reflection upon\r\nthe magnitude of our loss that we mourned for him; the general sorrow\r\nwas of a higher character.\r\n\r\nThe people of England grieved that the funeral ceremonies, and public\r\nmonuments, and posthumous rewards, were all that they could now bestow\r\nupon him whom the king, the legislature and the nation would have alike\r\ndelighted to honour; whom every tongue would have blessed; whose\r\npresence in every village through which he might have passed would have\r\nawakened the church bells, have given school-boys a holiday, have drawn\r\nchildren from their sports to gaze upon him, and "old men from the\r\nchimney-corner" to look upon Nelson ere they died.\r\n\r\nThe victory of Trafalgar was celebrated, indeed, with the usual forms of\r\nrejoicing, but they were without joy; for such already was the glory of\r\nthe British navy, through Nelson\'s surpassing genius, that it scarcely\r\nseemed to receive any addition from the most signal victory that ever\r\nwas achieved upon the seas. The destruction of this mighty fleet, by\r\nwhich all the maritime schemes of France were totally frustrated, hardly\r\nappeared to add to our security and strength; for while Nelson was\r\nliving to watch the combined squadrons of the enemy, we felt ourselves\r\nas secure as now, when they were no longer in existence.\r\n\r\nThere was reason to suppose, from the appearances upon opening his body,\r\nthat in the course of nature he might have attained, like his father, to\r\na good old age. Yet he cannot be said to have fallen prematurely whose\r\nwork was done; nor ought he to be lamented who died so full of honours,\r\nand at the height of human fame. The most triumphant death is that of\r\nthe martyr; the most awful, that of the martyred patriot; the most\r\nsplendid, that of the hero in the hour of victory; and if the chariot\r\nand the horses of fire had been vouchsafed for Nelson\'s translation, he\r\ncould scarcely have departed in a brighter blaze of glory. He has left\r\nus, not indeed a mantle of inspiration, but a name and an example which\r\nare at this moment inspiring thousands of the youth of England--a name\r\nwhich is our pride, and an example which will continue to be our shield\r\nand strength. Thus it is that spirits of the great and the wise continue\r\nto live and to act after them.\r\n\r\nSouthey\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEngland expects that every man will do his duty.\r\n\r\nNelson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWATERLOO\r\n\r\n\r\n    There was a sound of revelry by night,\r\n    And Belgium\'s capital had gathered then\r\n    Her Beauty and her Chivalry, and bright\r\n    The lamps shone o\'er fair women and brave men;\r\n    A thousand hearts beat happily; and when\r\n    Music arose with its voluptuous swell,\r\n    Soft eyes looked love to eyes which spake again,\r\n    And all went merry as a marriage bell;\r\n    But hush! hark! a deep sound strikes like a rising knell!\r\n\r\n    Did ye not hear it?--No; \'twas but the wind,\r\n    Or the car rattling o\'er the stony street;\r\n    On with the dance! let joy be unconfined;\r\n    No sleep till morn, when Youth and Pleasure meet\r\n    To chase the glowing Hours with flying feet.\r\n    But hark!--that heavy sound breaks in once more,\r\n    As if the clouds its echo would repeat;\r\n    And nearer, clearer, deadlier than before!\r\n    Arm! arm! it is--it is--the cannon\'s opening roar!\r\n\r\n    Within a windowed niche of that high hall\r\n    Sate Brunswick\'s fated chieftain; he did hear\r\n    That sound, the first amidst the festival,\r\n    And caught its tone with Death\'s prophetic ear;\r\n    And when they smiled because he deemed it near,\r\n    His heart more truly knew that peal too well\r\n    Which stretched his father on a bloody bier,\r\n    And roused the vengeance blood alone could quell:\r\n    He rushed into the field, and, foremost fighting, fell.\r\n\r\n    Ah! then and there was hurrying to and fro,\r\n    And gathering tears, and tremblings of distress,\r\n    And cheeks all pale, which but an hour ago\r\n    Blushed at the praise of their own loveliness;\r\n    And there were sudden partings, such as press\r\n    The life from out young hearts, and choking sighs\r\n    Which ne\'er might be repeated: who could guess\r\n    If ever more should meet those mutual eyes,\r\n    Since upon night so sweet such awful morn could rise!\r\n\r\n    And there was mounting in hot haste: the steed,\r\n    The mustering squadron, and the clattering car,\r\n    Went pouring forward with impetuous speed,\r\n    And swiftly forming in the ranks of war;\r\n    And the deep thunder peal on peal afar;\r\n    And near, the beat of the alarming drum\r\n    Roused up the soldier ere the morning star;\r\n    While thronged the citizens with terror dumb,\r\n    Or whispering, with white lips--"The foe!

The heavy\r\nbrigade in advance is drawn up in two lines. The light cavalry brigade\r\nis on their left, in two lines also. The silence is oppressive: between\r\nthe cannon bursts one can hear the champing of bits and the clink of\r\nsabres in the valley below.\r\n\r\nThe Russians on their left drew breath for a moment and then in one\r\ngrand line dashed at the Highlanders. The ground flies beneath their\r\nhorses\' feet. Gathering speed at every stride they dash on towards that\r\nthin red streak topped with a line of steel. The Turks fire a volley at\r\neight hundred yards and run. As the Russians come within six hundred\r\nyards, down goes that line of steel in front, and out rings a rolling\r\nvolley of Mini\xc3\xa9 musketry. The distance is too great: the Russians are\r\nnot checked, but still sweep onward through the smoke with the whole\r\nforce of horse and man, here and there knocked over by the shot of our\r\nbatteries above. With breathless suspense everyone awaits the bursting\r\nof the wave upon the line of Gaelic rock, but ere they come within a\r\nhundred and fifty yards another deadly volley flashes from the levelled\r\nrifles and carries death and terror into the Russians. They wheel about,\r\nopen files right and left, and fly back faster than they came. "Bravo,\r\nHighlanders! well done!" shout the excited spectators.\r\n\r\nBut events thicken. The Highlanders and their splendid front are soon\r\nforgotten; men scarcely have a moment to think of this fact, that they\r\nnever altered their formation to receive that tide of horsemen. "No,"\r\nsaid Sir Colin Campbell, "I did not think it worth while to form them\r\neven four deep!" The ordinary British line, two deep, was quite\r\nsufficient to repel the attack of these Muscovite cavaliers.\r\n\r\nOur eyes were, however, turned in a moment on our own cavalry. We saw\r\nBrigadier-General Scarlett ride along in front of his massive squadrons.\r\nThe Russians, evidently _corps d\'\xc3\xa9lite_, their light blue jackets\r\nembroidered with silver lace, were advancing on their left at an easy\r\ngallop towards the brow of the hill. A forest of lances glistened in\r\ntheir rear, and several squadrons of gray-coated dragoons moved up\r\nquickly to support them as they reached the summit. The instant they\r\ncame in sight the trumpets of our cavalry gave out the warning blast\r\nwhich told us all that in another moment we should see the shock of\r\nbattle beneath our very eyes. Lord Raglan, all his staff and escort and\r\ngroups of officers, the Zouaves, French generals and officers, and\r\nbodies of French infantry on the height were spectators of the scene as\r\nthough they were looking on the stage from the boxes of a theatre.\r\nNearly every one dismounted and sat down, and not a word was said.\r\n\r\nThe Russians advanced down the hill at a slow canter, which they changed\r\nto a trot, and at last nearly halted. Their first line was at least\r\ndouble the length of ours--it was three times as deep. Behind them was a\r\nsimilar line equally strong and compact. They evidently despised their\r\ninsignificant-looking enemy: but their time was come. The trumpets rang\r\nout again through the valley, and the Greys and the Enniskilleners went\r\nright at the centre of the Russian cavalry. The space between them was\r\nonly a few hundred yards; it was scarcely enough to let the horses\r\n"gather way," nor had the men quite space sufficient for the full play\r\nof their sword-arms.\r\n\r\nThe Russian line brings forward each wing as our cavalry advance, and\r\nthreatens to annihilate them as they pass on. Turning a little to their\r\nleft so as to meet the Russian right the Greys rush on with a cheer that\r\nthrills to every heart--the wild shout of the Enniskilleners rises\r\nthrough the air at the same instant. As lightning flashes through a\r\ncloud the Greys and Enniskilleners pierced through the dark masses of\r\nRussians. The shock was but for a moment. There was a clash of steel and\r\na light play of sword-blades in the air, and then the Greys and the\r\nRed-coats disappear in the midst of the shaken and quivering columns. In\r\nanother moment we see them emerging and dashing on with diminished\r\nnumbers and in broken order against the second line, which is advancing\r\nagainst them as fast as it can to retrieve the fortune of the charge. It\r\nwas a terrible moment. "God help them! they are lost!" was the\r\nexclamation of more than one man and the thought of many.\r\n\r\nWith unabated fire, the noble hearts dashed at their enemy. It was a\r\nfight of heroes. The first line of Russians--which had been smashed\r\nutterly by our charge and had fled off at one flank and towards the\r\ncentre--was coming back to swallow up our handful of men. By sheer\r\nsteel and sheer courage Enniskillener and Scot were winning their\r\ndesperate way right through the enemy\'s squadrons, and already gray\r\nhorses and red coats had appeared right at the rear of the second mass,\r\nwhen, with irresistible force like a bolt from a bow, the second line of\r\nthe heavy brigade rushed at the remnants of the first line of the enemy,\r\nwent through it as though it were made of paste-board and, dashing on\r\nthe second body of Russians as they were still disordered by the\r\nterrible assault of the Greys and their companions, put them to utter\r\nrout.\r\n\r\n     *       *       *      *       *\r\n\r\nAnd now occurred the melancholy catastrophe which fills us all with\r\nsorrow. It appears that the Quartermaster-General, Brigadier Airey,\r\nthinking that the light cavalry had not gone far enough in front when\r\nthe enemy\'s horse had fled, gave an order in writing to Captain Nolan to\r\ntake to Lord Lucan, directing his lordship "to advance" his cavalry\r\nnearer the enemy. Lord Lucan, with reluctance, gave the order to Lord\r\nCardigan to advance upon the guns, conceiving that his orders compelled\r\nhim to do so.\r\n\r\nIt is a maxim of war that "cavalry never act without a support," that\r\n"infantry should be close at hand when cavalry carry guns as the effect\r\nis only instantaneous," and that it is necessary to have on the flank of\r\na line of cavalry some squadrons in column--the attack on the flank\r\nbeing most dangerous. The only support our light cavalry had was the\r\nreserve of heavy cavalry at a great distance behind them, the infantry\r\nand guns being far in the rear. There were no squadrons in column at all\r\nand there was a plain to charge over before the enemy\'s guns could be\r\nreached, of a mile and a half in length!\r\n\r\nAt ten minutes past eleven our light cavalry brigade advanced. The whole\r\nbrigade scarcely made one effective regiment according to the numbers of\r\ncontinental armies, and yet it was more than we could spare. As they\r\nrushed towards the front the Russians opened on them from the guns in\r\nthe redoubt on the right with volleys of musketry and rifles. They swept\r\nproudly past, glittering in the morning sun in all the pride and\r\nsplendour of war.\r\n\r\nWe could scarcely believe the evidence of our senses. Surely that\r\nhandful of men are not going to charge an army in position? Alas! it\r\nwas but too true. Their desperate valour knew no bounds, and far indeed\r\nwas it removed from its so-called better part--discretion. They advanced\r\nin two lines, quickening their pace as they closed upon the enemy. A\r\nmore fearful spectacle was never witnessed than by those who beheld\r\nthese heroes rushing to the arms of Death.\r\n\r\nAt the distance of twelve hundred yards, the whole line of the enemy\r\nbelched forth from thirty iron mouths a flood of smoke and flame,\r\nthrough which hissed the deadly balls. Their flight was marked by\r\ninstant gaps in our ranks, by dead men and horses, by steeds flying\r\nwounded or riderless across the plain. The first line is broken--it is\r\njoined by the second--they never halt or check their speed an instant.\r\nWith diminished ranks thinned by those thirty guns which the Russians\r\nhad laid with the most deadly accuracy, with a halo of flashing steel\r\nabove their heads, and with a cheer which was many a noble fellow\'s\r\ndeath-cry, they flew into the smoke of the batteries, but ere they were\r\nlost from view the plain was strewn with their bodies and with the\r\ncarcasses of horses. They were exposed to an oblique fire from the\r\nbatteries on the hills on both sides, as well as to a direct fire of\r\nmusketry. Through the clouds of smoke we could see their sabres flashing\r\nas they rode up to the guns and dashed into their midst, cutting down\r\nthe gunners where they stood. We saw them riding through the guns, as I\r\nhave said: to our delight we saw them returning after breaking through a\r\ncolumn of Russian infantry and scattering it like chaff, when the flank\r\nfire of the battery on the hill swept them down scattered and broken as\r\nthey were. Wounded men and riderless horses flying towards us told the\r\nsad tale. Demi-gods could not have done what they had failed to do.\r\n\r\nAt the very moment when they were about to retreat an enormous mass of\r\nLancers was hurled on their flank. Colonel Shewell saw the danger and\r\nrode his few men straight to them, cutting his way through with fearful\r\nloss. The other regiments turned and engaged in a desperate encounter.\r\n\r\nWith courage too great almost for credence, they were breaking their way\r\nthrough the columns which enveloped them, when there took place an act\r\nof atrocity without parallel in the modern warfare of civilized nations.\r\nThe Russian gunners, when the storm of cavalry passed, returned to their\r\nguns. They saw their own cavalry mingled with the troopers who had just\r\nridden over them, and, to the eternal disgrace of the Russian name, the\r\nmiscreants poured a murderous volley of grape and canister on the mass\r\nof struggling men and horses, mingling friend and foe in one common\r\nruin!\r\n\r\nIt was as much as our heavy cavalry could do to cover the retreat of the\r\nmiserable remnants of the band of heroes as they returned to the place\r\nthey had so lately quitted. At thirty-five minutes past eleven not a\r\nBritish soldier, except the dead and the dying, was left in front of\r\nthose guns.\r\n\r\nWilliam Howard Russell\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFUNERAL OF WELLINGTON\r\n\r\n\r\n    Who is he that cometh, like an honour\'d guest,\r\n    With banner and with music, with soldier and with priest,\r\n    With a nation weeping, and breaking on my rest?\r\n      Mighty Seaman, this is he\r\n      Was great by land as thou by sea.\r\n    Thine island loves thee well, thou famous man,\r\n    The greatest sailor since our world began.\r\n    Now, to the roll of muffled drums,\r\n    To thee the greatest soldier comes;\r\n    For this is he\r\n    Was great by land as thou by sea;\r\n    His foes were thine; he kept us free;\r\n    O give him welcome, this is he\r\n    Worthy of our gorgeous rites,\r\n    And worthy to be laid by thee;\r\n    For this is England\'s greatest son,\r\n    He that gain\'d a hundred fights,\r\n    Nor ever lost an English gun;\r\n\r\n         *       *       *      *       *\r\n\r\n    Remember him who led your hosts;\r\n    He bad you guard the sacred coasts.\r\n    Your cannons moulder on the seaward wall;\r\n    His voice is silent in your council-hall\r\n    For ever; and whatever tempests lour\r\n    For ever silent; even if they broke\r\n    In thunder, silent; yet remember all\r\n    He spoke among you, and the Man who spoke;\r\n    Who never sold the truth to serve the hour,\r\n    Nor palter\'d with Eternal God for power;\r\n    Who let the turbid streams of rumour flow\r\n    Thro\' either babbling world of high and low;\r\n    Whose life was work, whose language rife\r\n    With rugged maxims hewn from life;\r\n    Who never spoke against a foe:\r\n    Whose eighty winters freeze with one rebuke\r\n    All great self-seekers trampling on the right:\r\n    Truth-teller was our England\'s Alfred named;\r\n    Truth-lover was our English Duke;\r\n    Whatever record leap to life,\r\n    He never shall be shamed.\r\n\r\nTennyson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN A CAVE WITH A WHALE\r\n\r\n\r\nJust when the delightful days were beginning to pall upon us, a real\r\nadventure befell us, which, had we been attending strictly to business,\r\nwe should not have encountered. For a week previous we had been cruising\r\nconstantly without ever seeing a spout, except those belonging to whales\r\nout at sea, whither we knew it was folly to follow them. At last, one\r\nafternoon as we were listlessly lolling (half-asleep, except the\r\nlook-out man) across the thwarts, we suddenly came upon a gorge between\r\ntwo cliffs that we must have passed before several times unnoticed. At a\r\ncertain angle it opened, disclosing a wide sheet of water extending a\r\nlong distance ahead. I put the helm up, and we ran through the passage,\r\nfinding it about a boat\'s length in width and several fathoms deep,\r\nthough overhead the cliffs nearly came together in places. The place was\r\nnew to us, and our languor was temporarily dispelled, and we paddled\r\nalong, taking in every feature of the shores with keen eyes that let\r\nnothing escape. After we had gone on in this placid manner for maybe an\r\nhour, we suddenly came to a stupendous cliff--that is, for those\r\nparts--rising almost sheer from the water for about a thousand feet. Of\r\nitself it would not have arrested our attention, but at its base was a\r\nsemicircular opening, like the mouth of a small tunnel. This looked\r\nalluring, so I headed the boat for it, passing through a deep channel\r\nbetween two reefs which led straight to the opening. There was ample\r\nroom for us to enter, as we had lowered the mast; but just as we were\r\npassing through, a heave of the unnoticed swell lifted us unpleasantly\r\nnear the crown of this natural arch. Beneath us, at a great depth, the\r\nbottom could be dimly discerned, the water being of the richest blue\r\nconceivable, which the sun, striking down through, resolved into some\r\nmost marvellous colour-schemes in the path of its rays. A delicious\r\nsense of coolness, after the fierce heat outside, saluted us as we\r\nentered a vast hall, whose roof rose to a minimum height of forty feet,\r\nbut in places could not be seen at all. A sort of diffused light, weak,\r\nbut sufficient to reveal the general contour of the place, existed, let\r\nin, I supposed, through some unseen crevices in the roof or walls. At\r\nfirst, of course, to our eyes, fresh from the fierce glare outside, the\r\nplace seemed wrapped in impenetrable gloom, and we dared not stir lest\r\nwe should run into some hidden danger. Before many minutes, however, the\r\ngloom lightened as our pupils enlarged, so that, although the light was\r\nfaint, we could find our way about with ease. We spoke in low tones, for\r\nthe echoes were so numerous and resonant that even a whisper gave back\r\nfrom those massy walls in a series of recurring hisses, as if a colony\r\nof snakes had been disturbed.\r\n\r\nWe paddled on into the interior of this vast cave, finding everywhere\r\nthe walls rising sheer from the silent, dark waters, not a ledge or a\r\ncrevice where one might gain foothold. Indeed, in some places there was\r\na considerable overhang from above, as if a great dome whose top was\r\ninvisible sprang from some level below the water. We pushed ahead until\r\nthe tiny semi-circle of light through which we had entered was only\r\nfaintly visible; and then, finding there was nothing to be seen except\r\nwhat we were already witnessing, unless we cared to go on into the thick\r\ndarkness, which extended apparently into the bowels of the mountain, we\r\nturned and started to go back. Do what we would, we could not venture to\r\nbreak the solemn hush that surrounded us, as if we were shut within the\r\ndome of some vast cathedral in the twilight. So we paddled noiselessly\r\nalong for the exit, till suddenly an awful, inexplicable roar set all\r\nour hearts thumping fit to break our bosoms. Really, the sensation was\r\nmost painful, especially as we had not the faintest idea whence the\r\nnoise came or what had produced it. Again it filled that immense cave\r\nwith its thunderous reverberations; but this time all the sting was\r\ntaken out of it, as we caught sight of its author. A goodly\r\nbull-humpback had found his way in after us, and the sound of his spout,\r\nexaggerated a thousand times in the confinement of that mighty cavern,\r\nhad frightened us all so that we nearly lost our breath. So far so good;\r\nbut, unlike the old negro though we were "doin\' blame well," we did not\r\n"let blame well alone." The next spout that intruder gave, he was right\r\nalongside of us. This was too much for the semi-savage instincts of my\r\ngallant harpooner, and before I had time to shout a caution he had\r\nplunged his weapon deep into old Blowhard\'s broad back.\r\n\r\nI should like to describe what followed, but, in the first place, I\r\nhardly know; and, in the next, even had I been cool and collected, my\r\nrecollections would sound like the ravings of a fevered dream. For of\r\nall the hideous uproars conceivable, that was, I should think, about the\r\nworst. The big mammal seemed to have gone frantic with the pain of his\r\nwound, the surprise of the attack, and the hampering confinement in\r\nwhich he found himself. His tremendous struggles caused such a commotion\r\nthat our position could only be compared to that of men shooting Niagara\r\nin a cylinder at night. How we kept afloat, I do not know. Some one had\r\nthe gumption to cut the line, so that by the radiation of the\r\ndisturbance we presently found ourselves close to the wall, and trying\r\nto hold the boat in to it with our finger tips. Would he never be quiet?\r\nwe thought, as the thrashing, banging, and splashing still went on with\r\nunfailing vigour. At last, in, I suppose, one supreme effort to escape,\r\nhe leaped clear of the water like a salmon. There was a perceptible\r\nhush, during which we shrank together like unfledged chickens on a\r\nfrosty night; then, in a never-to-be-forgotten crash that ought to have\r\nbrought down the massy roof, that mountainous carcass fell. The\r\nconsequent violent upheaval of the water should have smashed the boat\r\nagainst the rocky walls, but that final catastrophe was mercifully\r\nspared us. I suppose the rebound was sufficient to keep us a safe\r\ndistance off.\r\n\r\nA perfect silence succeeded, during which we sat speechless, awaiting a\r\nresumption of the clamour. At last Abner broke the heavy silence by\r\nsaying: "I doan\' see the do\'way any mo\' at all, sir." He was right. The\r\ntide had risen, and that half-moon of light had disappeared, so that we\r\nwere now prisoners for many hours, it not being at all probable that we\r\nshould be able to find our way out during the night ebb. Well, we were\r\nnot exactly children, to be afraid of the dark, although there is\r\nconsiderable difference between the velvety darkness of a dungeon and\r\nthe clear, fresh night of the open air. Still, as long as that beggar of\r\na whale would only keep quiet or leave the premises, we should be fairly\r\ncomfortable. We waited and waited until an hour had passed, and then\r\ncame to the conclusion that our friend was either dead or had gone out,\r\nas he gave no sign of his presence.\r\n\r\nThat being settled, we anchored the boat, and lit pipes, preparatory to\r\npassing as comfortable a night as might be under the circumstances, the\r\nonly thing troubling me being the anxiety of the skipper on our behalf.\r\nPresently the blackness beneath was lit up by a wide band of phosphoric\r\nlight, shed in the wake of no ordinary-sized fish, probably an immense\r\nshark. Another and another followed in rapid succession, until the\r\ndepths beneath were all ablaze with brilliant foot-wide ribbons of green\r\nglare, dazzling to the eye and bewildering to the brain. Occasionally a\r\ngentle splash or ripple alongside, or a smart tap on the bottom of the\r\nboat, warned us how thick the concourse was that had gathered below.\r\nUntil that weariness which no terror is proof against set in, sleep was\r\nimpossible, nor could we keep our anxious gaze from that glowing inferno\r\nbeneath, where one would have thought all the population of Tartarus\r\nwere holding high revel. Mercifully, at last we sank into a fitful\r\nslumber, though fully aware of the great danger of our position. One\r\nupward rush of any of those ravening monsters, happening to strike the\r\nfrail shell of our boat, and a few fleeting seconds would have sufficed\r\nfor our obliteration as if we had never been.\r\n\r\nBut the terrible night passed away, and once more we saw the tender,\r\niridescent light stream into that abode of dread. As the day\r\nstrengthened, we were able to see what was going on below, and a grim\r\nvision it presented. The water was literally alive with sharks of\r\nenormous size, tearing with never-ceasing energy at the huge carcass of\r\nthe whale lying on the bottom, who had met his fate in a singular but\r\nnot unheard-of way. At that last titanic effort of his he had rushed\r\ndownward with such terrific force that, striking his head on the bottom,\r\nhe had broken his neck. I felt very grieved that we had lost the chance\r\nof securing him; but it was perfectly certain that before we could get\r\nhelp to raise him, all that would be left on his skeleton would be quite\r\nvalueless to us. So with such patience as we could command, we waited\r\nnear the entrance until the receding ebb made it possible for us to\r\nemerge once more into the blessed light of day.\r\n\r\nFrank T. Bullen: "The Cruise of the Cachalot."\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: IN GEORGIAN BAY]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    From toil he wins his spirits light,\r\n      From busy day the peaceful night,\r\n    Rich, from the very want of wealth,\r\n      In heaven\'s best treasures, peace and health.\r\n\r\nGray\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GLOVE AND THE LIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n    King Francis was a hearty king, and loved\r\n      a royal sport,\r\n    And one day, as his lions strove, sat\r\n      looking on the court;\r\n    The nobles filled the benches round, the\r\n      ladies by their side,\r\n    And \'mongst them Count de Lorge, with one\r\n      he hoped to make his bride;\r\n    And truly \'twas a gallant thing to see that\r\n      crowning show,\r\n    Valour and love, and a king above, and the\r\n      royal beasts below.\r\n\r\n    Ramped and roared the lions, with horrid\r\n      laughing jaws;\r\n    They bit, they glared, gave blows like beams,\r\n      a wind went with their paws.\r\n    With wallowing might and stifled roar, they\r\n      rolled one on another,\r\n    Till all the pit, with sand and mane, was in\r\n      a thunderous smother;\r\n    The bloody foam above the bars came whizzing\r\n      through the air;\r\n    Said Francis, then, "Good gentlemen, we\'re\r\n      better here than there!"\r\n\r\n    De Lorge\'s love o\'erheard the King, a\r\n      beauteous, lively dame,\r\n    With smiling lips, and sharp bright eyes,\r\n      which always seemed the same:\r\n    She thought, "The Count, my lover, is as\r\n      brave as brave can be;\r\n    He surely would do desperate things to show\r\n      his love of me!\r\n    King, ladies, lover, all look on; the chance\r\n      is wond\'rous fine;\r\n    I\'ll drop my glove to prove his love; great\r\n      glory will be mine!"\r\n\r\n    She dropped her glove to prove his love: then\r\n      looked on him and smiled;\r\n    He bowed and in a moment leaped among the\r\n      lions wild:\r\n    The leap was quick; return was quick; he soon\r\n      regained his place;\r\n    Then threw the glove, but not with love, right\r\n      in the lady\'s face!\r\n    "In truth!" cried Francis, "rightly done!" and\r\n      he rose from where he sat:\r\n    "No love," quoth he, "but vanity, sets love a\r\n      task like that!"\r\n\r\nLeigh Hunt\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHREE SCENES IN THE TYROL\r\n\r\n\r\nYou are standing on a narrow, thread-like road, which has barely room to\r\ndraw itself along between the rocky bank of the River Inn, and the base\r\nof a frowning buttress of the Solstein, which towers many hundred feet\r\nperpendicularly above you. You throw your head far back and look up; and\r\nthere you have a vision of a plumed hunter, lofty and chivalrous in his\r\nbearing, who is bounding heedlessly on after a chamois to the very verge\r\nof a precipice. Mark!--he loses his footing--he rolls helplessly from\r\nrock to rock! There is a pause in his headlong course. What is it that\r\narrests him? Ah! he puts forth his mighty strength, and clings, hand and\r\nfoot, with the grip of despair, to a narrow ledge of rock, and there he\r\nhangs over the abyss! It is the Emperor Maximilian! The Abbot of Wiltau\r\ncomes forth from his cell, sees an imperial destiny suspended between\r\nheaven and earth, and, crossing himself with awe, bids prayers be put up\r\nfor the welfare of a passing soul.\r\n\r\nHark! there is a wild cry ringing through the upper air! Ha! Zyps of\r\nZirl, thou hunted and hunting outlaw, art thou out upon the heights at\r\nthis fearful moment? Watch the hardy mountaineer! He binds his\r\n_crampons_ on his feet,--he is making his perilous way towards his\r\nfailing Emperor;--now bounding like a hunted chamois; now creeping like\r\nan insect; now clinging like a root of ivy; now dropping like a\r\nsquirrel:--he reaches the fainting monarch just as he relaxes his grasp\r\non the jutting rock. Courage, Kaiser!--there is a hunter\'s hand for\r\nthee, a hunter\'s iron-shod foot to guide thee to safety. Look! They\r\nclamber up the face of the rock, on points and ledges where scarce the\r\nsmall hoof of the chamois might find a hold; and the peasant-folk still\r\nmaintain that an angel came down to their master\'s rescue. We will,\r\nhowever, refer the marvellous escape to the interposing hand of a\r\npitying Providence.\r\n\r\nZyps, the outlaw, becomes Count Hallooer von Hohenfeldsen--"Lord of the\r\nwild cry of the lofty rock;" and in the old pension-list of the proud\r\nhouse of Hapsburg may still be seen an entry to this effect: that\r\nsixteen florins were paid annually to one "Zyps of Zirl." As you look up\r\nfrom the base of the Martinswand, you may, with pains, distinguish a\r\ncross, which has been planted on the narrow ledge where the Emperor was\r\nrescued by the outlaw.\r\n\r\nThere is another vision, an imperial one also. The night is dark and\r\nwild. Gusty winds come howling down from the mountain passes, driving\r\nsheets of blinding rain before them, and whirling them round in hissing\r\neddies. At intervals the clouds are rent asunder, and the moon takes a\r\nhurried look at the world below. What does _she_ see? and what do _we_\r\nhear? for there are other sounds stirring besides the ravings of the\r\ntempest, in that wild cleft of the mountains, which guard Innsbruck, on\r\nthe Carinthian side.\r\n\r\nThere is a hurried tramp of feet, a crowding and crushing up through the\r\nsteep and narrow gorge, a mutter of suppressed voices, a fitful glancing\r\nof torches, which now flare up bravely enough, now wither in a moment\r\nbefore the derisive laugh of the storm. At the head of the mel\xc3\xa9e there\r\nis a litter borne on the shoulders of a set of sure-footed hunters of\r\nthe hills; and around this litter is clustered a moving constellation of\r\nlamps, which are anxiously shielded from the rude wrath of the tempest.\r\nA group of stately figures, wrapped in rich military cloaks, with helms\r\nglistening in the torch-light, and plumes streaming on the wind,\r\nstruggle onward beside the litter.\r\n\r\nAnd who is this reclining there, his teeth firmly set to imprison the\r\nstifled groan of physical anguish? He is but fifty-three years of age,\r\nbut the lines of premature decay are ploughed deep along brow and cheek,\r\nwhile his yellow locks are silvered and crisped with care. Who can\r\nmistake that full, expansive forehead, that aquiline nose, that cold,\r\nstern blue eye, and that heavy, obstinate, Austrian underlip, for other\r\nthan those of the mighty Emperor Charles V? And can this suffering\r\ninvalid, flying from foes who are almost on the heels of his attendants,\r\njolted over craggy passes in midnight darkness, buffeted by the tempest,\r\nand withered by the sneer of adverse fortune--_can_ this be the Emperor\r\nof Germany, King of Spain, Lord of the Netherlands, of Naples, of\r\nLombardy, and the proud chief of the golden Western World? Yes, Charles,\r\nthou art reading a stern lesson by that fitful torch-light; but thy\r\nstrong will is yet unbent, and thy stern nature yet unsoftened.\r\n\r\nAnd who is the swift "avenger of blood" who is following close as a\r\nsleuth-hound on thy track? It is Maurice of Saxony--a match for thee in\r\nboldness of daring, and in strength of will. But Charles wins the\r\nmidnight race; and yet, instead of bowing before Him whose\r\n"long-suffering would lead to repentance," he ascribes his escape to the\r\n"star of Austria," ever in the ascendant, and mutters his favourite\r\nsaying, "Myself, and the lucky moment."\r\n\r\nOne more scene: it is the year 1809. Bonaparte has decreed in the secret\r\ncouncil chamber, where his own will is his sole adviser, that the Tyrol\r\nshall be cleared of its troublesome nest of warrior-hunters. Ten\r\nthousand French and Bavarian soldiers have penetrated as far as the\r\nUpper Innthal, and are boldly pushing on towards Prutz.\r\n\r\nBut the mountain-walls of this profound valley are closing gloomily\r\ntogether, as if they would forbid even the indignant river to force its\r\nwild way betwixt them. _Is_ there a path through the frowning gorge\r\nother than that rocky way which is fiercely held by the current? Yes,\r\nthere is a narrow road, painfully grooved by the hand of man out of the\r\nmountain side, now running along like a gallery, now dropping down to\r\nthe brink of the stream. But the glittering array winds on. There is the\r\nheavy tread of the foot-soldiers, the trampling of horse, the dull\r\nrumble of the guns, the waving and flapping of the colours, and the\r\nangry remonstrance of the Inn. But all else is still as a midnight\r\nsleep, except, indeed, when the eagles of the crag, startled from their\r\neyries, raise their shrill cry as they spread their living wings above\r\nthe gilded eagles of France.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a voice is heard far up amid the mists of the heights--not the\r\neagle\'s cry _this_ time--not the freak of a wayward echo--but human\r\nwords, which say "_Shall we begin?_" Silence! It is a host that holds\r\nits breath and listens. Was it a spirit of the upper air parleying with\r\nits kind? If so, it has its answer countersigned across the dark gulf.\r\n"_Noch nicht!_"--"_Not yet!_" The whole invading army pause: there is a\r\nwavering and writhing in the glittering serpent-length of that mighty\r\nforce which is helplessly uncoiled along the base of the mountain. But\r\nhark! the voice of the hills is heard again, and it says "_Now!_"\r\n\r\n_Now_, then, descends the wild avalanche of destruction, and all is\r\ntumult, dismay, and death. The very crags of the mountain side, loosened\r\nin preparation, come bounding, thundering down. Trunks and roots of pine\r\ntrees, gathering speed on their headlong way, are launched down upon the\r\npowerless foe, mingled with the deadly hail of the Tyrolese rifles. And\r\nthis fearful storm descends along the whole line at once. No marvel that\r\ntwo-thirds of all that brilliant invading army are crushed to death\r\nalong the grooved pathway, or are tumbled, horse and man, into the\r\nchoked and swollen river.\r\n\r\nEnough of horrors! Who would willingly linger on the hideous details of\r\nsuch a scene? Sorrowful that man should come, with his evil ambitions\r\nand his fierce revenges, to stain and to spoil such wonders of beauty as\r\nthe hand of the Creator has here moulded. Sorrowful that man, in league\r\nwith the serpent, should writhe into such scenes as these, and poison\r\nthem with the virus of sin.\r\n\r\nRichter\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    Who loves not Knowledge? Who shall rail\r\n      Against her beauty? May she mix\r\n      With men and prosper! Who shall fix\r\n    Her pillars? Let her work prevail.\r\n     ... Let her know her place;\r\n    She is the second, not the first,\r\n    A higher hand must make her mild,\r\n      If all be not in vain; and guide\r\n      Her footsteps, moving side by side\r\n    With wisdom, like the younger child.\r\n\r\nTennyson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARSTON MOOR\r\n\r\n(A Cavalier Song)\r\n\r\n\r\n    To horse! to horse!

M. Praed\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLONDON\r\n\r\n\r\nThe huge city perhaps never impressed the imagination more than when\r\napproaching it by night on the top of a coach you saw its numberless\r\nlights flaring, as Tennyson says "like a dreary dawn." The most\r\nimpressive approach is now by the river through the infinitude of docks,\r\nquays, and shipping. London is not a city, but a province of brick and\r\nstone. Hardly even from the top of St. Paul\'s or of the Monument can\r\nanything like a view of the city as a whole be obtained. It is\r\nindispensable, however, to make one or the other of those ascents when a\r\nclear day can be found, not so much because the view is fine, as because\r\nyou will get a sensation of vastness and multitude not easily to be\r\nforgotten. There is or was, not long ago, a point on the ridge that\r\nconnects Hampstead with Highgate from which, as you looked over London\r\nto the Surrey Hills beyond, the modern Babylon presented something like\r\nthe aspect of a city. The ancient Babylon may have vied with London in\r\ncircumference, but the greater part of its area was occupied by open\r\nspaces; the modern Babylon is a dense mass of humanity. London with its\r\nsuburbs has five millions of inhabitants, and still it grows. It grows\r\nthrough the passion which seems to be seizing mankind everywhere, on\r\nthis continent as well as in Europe, for emigration from the country\r\ninto the town, not only as the centre of wealth and employment, but as\r\nthe centre of excitement, and, as the people fondly fancy, of enjoyment.\r\nThe Empire and the commercial relations of England draw representatives\r\nof trading communities or subject races from all parts of the globe, and\r\nthe faces and costumes of the Hindoo, the Parsi, the Lascar, and the\r\nubiquitous Chinaman, mingle in the motley crowd with the merchants of\r\nEurope and America. The streets of London are, in this respect, to the\r\nmodern, what the great Place of Tyre must have been to the ancient\r\nworld. But pile Carthage on Tyre, Venice on Carthage, Amsterdam on\r\nVenice, and you will not make the equal, or anything near the equal, of\r\nLondon. Here is the great mart of the world, to which the best and\r\nrichest products are brought from every land and clime, so that if you\r\nhave put money in your purse you may command every object of utility or\r\nfancy which grows or is made anywhere, without going beyond the circuit\r\nof the great cosmopolitan city. Parisian, German, Russian, Hindoo,\r\nJapanese, Chinese industry is as much at your service here, if you have\r\nthe all-compelling talisman in your pocket, as in Paris, Berlin, St.\r\nPetersburg, Benares, Yokohama or Pekin. That London is the great\r\ndistributing centre of the world is shown by the fleets of the carrying\r\ntrade of which the countless masts rise along her wharves and in her\r\ndocks. She is also the bank of the world. But we are reminded of the\r\nvicissitudes of commerce and the precarious tenure by which its empire\r\nis held when we consider that the bank of the world in the middle of the\r\nlast century was Amsterdam.\r\n\r\nThe first and perhaps the greatest marvel of London is the commissariat.\r\nHow can the five millions be regularly supplied with food, and\r\neverything needful to life, even with such things as milk and those\r\nkinds of fruit which can hardly be left beyond a day? Here again we see\r\nreason for concluding that though there may be fraud and scamping in the\r\nindustrial world, genuine production, faithful service, disciplined\r\nenergy, and skill in organization cannot wholly have departed from the\r\nearth. London is not only well fed, but well supplied with water and\r\nwell drained. Vastly and densely peopled as it is, it is a healthy city.\r\nYet the limit of practicable extension seems to be nearly reached. It\r\nbecomes a question how the increasing multitude shall be supplied not\r\nonly with food and water but with air.\r\n\r\nThere is something very impressive in the roar of the vast city. It is a\r\nsound of a Niagara of human life. It ceases not except during the hour\r\nor two before dawn, when the last carriages have rolled away from the\r\nballs and the market carts have hardly begun to come in. Only in\r\nreturning from a very late ball is the visitor likely to have a chance\r\nof seeing what Wordsworth saw from Westminster Bridge:\r\n\r\n    "Earth has not anything to show more fair;\r\n    Dull would he be of soul who could pass by\r\n    A sight so touching in its majesty;\r\n    This City now doth, like a garment, wear\r\n    The beauty of the morning; silent, bare,\r\n    Ships, towers, domes, theatres, and temples lie\r\n    Open unto the fields, and to the sky;\r\n    All bright and glittering in the open air.\r\n    Never did sun more beautifully steep\r\n    In his first splendour, valley, rock or hill;\r\n    Ne\'er saw I, never felt, a calm so deep!\r\n    The river glideth at his own sweet will:\r\n    Dear God! the very houses seem asleep;\r\n    And all that mighty heart is lying still!"\r\n\r\nGoldwin Smith: "A Trip to England."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHOW THEY BROUGHT THE GOOD NEWS FROM GHENT TO AIX\r\n\r\n\r\n    I sprang to the stirrup, and Joris, and he;\r\n    I galloped, Dirck galloped, we galloped all three;\r\n    "Good speed!" cried the watch, as the gate-bolts undrew;\r\n    "Speed!" echoed the wall to us galloping through;\r\n    Behind shut the postern, the lights sank to rest,\r\n    And into the midnight we galloped abreast.\r\n\r\n    Not a word to each other; we kept the great pace\r\n    Neck by neck, stride by stride, never changing our place;\r\n    I turned in my saddle and made its girths tight,\r\n    Then shortened each stirrup, and set the pique right,\r\n    Rebuckled the cheek-strap, chained slacker the bit,\r\n    Nor galloped less steadily Roland a whit.\r\n\r\n    \'Twas moonset at starting; but while we drew near\r\n    Lokeren, the cocks crew, and twilight dawned clear;\r\n    At Boom, a great yellow star came out to see;\r\n    At D\xc3\xbcffeld, \'twas morning as plain as could be;\r\n    And from Mecheln church-steeple we heard the half-chime,\r\n    So, Joris broke silence with, "Yet there is time!"\r\n\r\n    At Aershot, up leaped of a sudden the sun,\r\n    And against him the cattle stood black every one,\r\n    To stare thro\' the mist at us galloping past,\r\n    And I saw my stout galloper Roland at last,\r\n    With resolute shoulders, each butting away\r\n    The haze, as some bluff river headland its spray:\r\n\r\n    And his low head and crest, just one sharp ear bent back\r\n    For my voice, and the other pricked out on his track;\r\n    And one eye\'s black intelligence--ever that glance\r\n    O\'er its white edge at me, his own master, askance!\r\n    And the thick heavy spume-flakes which aye and anon\r\n    His fierce lips shook upwards in galloping on.\r\n\r\n    By Hasselt, Dirck groaned; and cried Joris, "Stay spur!\r\n    Your Roos galloped bravely, the fault\'s not in her,\r\n    We\'ll remember at Aix"--for one heard the quick wheeze\r\n    Of her chest, saw the stretched neck, and staggering knees,\r\n    And sunk tail, and horrible heave of the flank,\r\n    As down on her haunches she shuddered and sank.\r\n\r\n    So we were left galloping, Joris and I,\r\n    Past Looz and past Tongres, no cloud in the sky;\r\n    The broad sun above laughed a pitiless laugh,\r\n    \'Neath our feet broke the brittle bright stubble like chaff;\r\n    Till over by Dalhem a dome-spire sprang white,\r\n    And "Gallop," gasped Joris, "for Aix is in sight!"\r\n\r\n    "How they\'ll greet us!"--and all in a moment his roan\r\n    Rolled neck and croup over, lay dead as a stone;\r\n    And there was my Roland to bear the whole weight\r\n    Of the news, which alone could save Aix from her fate,\r\n    With his nostrils like pits full of blood to the brim,\r\n    And with circles of red for his eye-sockets\' rim.\r\n\r\n    Then I cast loose my buff-coat, each holster let fall,\r\n    Shook off both my jack-boots, let go belt and all,\r\n    Stood up in the stirrup, leaned, patted his ear,\r\n    Called my Roland his pet-name, my horse without peer;\r\n    Clapped my hands, laughed and sang, any noise, bad or good,\r\n    Till at length into Aix Roland galloped and stood!\r\n\r\n    And all I remember is,--friends flocking round,\r\n    As I sat with his head \'twixt my knees on the ground;\r\n    And no voice but was praising this Roland of mine,\r\n    As I poured down his throat our last measure of wine,\r\n    Which (the burgesses voted by common consent)\r\n    Was no more than his due who brought good news from Ghent.\r\n\r\nBrowning\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAN INCIDENT OF THE FRENCH CAMP\r\n\r\n\r\n    You know, we French stormed Ratisbon:\r\n      A mile or so away,\r\n    On a little mound, Napoleon\r\n      Stood on our storming-day;\r\n    With neck out-thrust, you fancy how,\r\n      Legs wide, arms locked behind,\r\n    As if to balance the prone brow\r\n      Oppressive with its mind.\r\n\r\n    Just as perhaps he mused "My plans\r\n      That soar, to earth may fall,\r\n    Let once my army-leader Lannes\r\n      Waver at yonder wall,"--\r\n    Out \'twixt the battery-smokes there flew\r\n      A rider, bound on bound\r\n    Full-galloping; nor bridle drew\r\n      Until he reached the mound.\r\n\r\n    Then off there flung in smiling joy,\r\n      And held himself erect\r\n    By just his horse\'s mane, a boy:\r\n      You scarcely could suspect--\r\n    (So tight he kept his lips compressed,\r\n      Scarce any blood came through)\r\n    You looked twice ere you saw his breast\r\n      Was all but shot in two.\r\n\r\n    "Well," cried he, "Emperor, by God\'s grace\r\n      We\'ve got you Ratisbon!\r\n    The Marshal\'s in the market-place,\r\n      And you\'ll be there anon\r\n    To see your flag-bird flap his vans\r\n      Where I, to heart\'s desire,\r\n    Perched him!" The chief\'s eye flashed; his plans\r\n      Soared up again like fire.\r\n\r\n    The chief\'s eye flashed; but presently\r\n      Softened itself, as sheathes\r\n    A film the mother-eagle\'s eye\r\n      When her bruised eaglet breathes;\r\n    "You\'re wounded!" "Nay," the soldier\'s pride\r\n      Touched to the quick, he said:\r\n    "I\'m killed, Sire!" And his chief beside,\r\n      Smiling the boy fell dead.\r\n\r\nBrowning\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n    I made them lay their hands in mine and swear\r\n    To reverence the King, as if he were\r\n    Their conscience, and their conscience as their King,\r\n    To ride abroad redressing human wrongs,\r\n    To speak no slander, no, nor listen to it.\r\n\r\nTennyson\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBRITISH COLONIAL AND NAVAL POWER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe sagacity of England is in nothing more clearly shown than in the\r\nforesight with which she has provided against the emergency of war. Let\r\nit come when it may, it will not find her unprepared. So thickly are her\r\ncolonies and naval stations scattered over the face of the Earth, that\r\nher war-ships can speedily reach every commercial centre on the globe.\r\n\r\nThere is that great centre of commerce, the Mediterranean Sea. It was a\r\ngreat centre long ago, when the Phoenician traversed it, and, passing\r\nthrough the Pillars of Hercules, sped on his way to the distant, and\r\nthen savage, Britain. It was a great centre when Rome and Carthage\r\nwrestled in a death-grapple for its possession. But at the present day\r\nEngland is as much at home on the Mediterranean as if it were one of her\r\nown Canadian lakes.\r\n\r\nNor is it simply the number of the British colonies, or the evenness\r\nwith which they are distributed, that challenges our admiration. The\r\npositions which these colonies occupy, and their natural military\r\nstrength, are quite as important facts. There is not a sea or a gulf in\r\nthe world, which has any real commercial importance, but England has a\r\nstronghold on its shores. And wherever the continents tending southward\r\ncome to points, around which the commerce of nations must sweep, there\r\nis a British settlement; and the cross of St. George salutes you as you\r\nare wafted by. There is hardly a little desolate, rocky island or\r\npeninsula, formed apparently by Nature for a fortress, and nothing else,\r\nbut the British flag floats securely over it.\r\n\r\nThese are literal facts. Take, for example, the great Overland Route\r\nfrom Europe to Asia. Despite its name, its real highway is on the waters\r\nof the Mediterranean and Red Seas. It has three gates--three only.\r\nEngland holds the key to every one of these gates. Count\r\nthem--Gibraltar, Malta, Aden. But she commands the entrance to the Red\r\nSea, not by one, but by several strongholds. Midway in the narrow strait\r\nis the black, bare rock of Perim, sterile, precipitous, a perfect\r\ncounterpart of Gibraltar; and on either side, between it and the\r\nmainland, are the ship-channels which connect the Red Sea with the great\r\nIndian Ocean. This rock England holds.\r\n\r\nA little farther out is the peninsula of Aden, another Gibraltar, as\r\nrocky, as sterile, and as precipitous, connected with the mainland by a\r\nnarrow strait, and having a harbour safe in all winds, and a central\r\ncoal dep\xc3\xb4t. This England bought in 1839. And to complete her security,\r\nshe has purchased from some petty sultan the neighbouring islands of\r\nSocotra and Kouri, giving, as it were, a retaining fee, so that, though\r\nshe does not need them herself, no rival power may ever possess them.\r\n\r\nAs we sail a little farther on, we come to the China Sea. What a beaten\r\ntrack of commerce is this! What wealth of comfort and luxury is wafted\r\nover it by every breeze!--the teas of China; the silks of farther India;\r\nthe spices of the East. The ships of every clime and nation swarm on its\r\nwaters--the stately barques of England, France, and Holland; the swift\r\nships of America; and mingled with them, in picturesque confusion, the\r\nclumsy junk of the Chinaman, and the slender, darting canoe of the\r\nMalaysian islanders.\r\n\r\nAt the lower end of the China Sea, where it narrows into Malacca Strait,\r\nEngland holds the little island of Singapore--a spot of no use to her\r\nwhatever, except as a commercial dep\xc3\xb4t, but of inestimable value for\r\nthat; a spot which, under her fostering care, is growing up to take its\r\nplace among the great emporiums of the world. Half-way up the sea she\r\nholds the island of Labuan, whose chief worth is this, that beneath its\r\nsurface and that of the neighbouring mainland there lie inexhaustible\r\ntreasures of coal, which are likely to yield wealth and power to the\r\nhand that controls them. At the upper end of the sea she holds\r\nHong-Kong, a hot, unhealthy island, but an invaluable base from which to\r\nthreaten and control the neighbouring waters.\r\n\r\nEven in the broad, and as yet comparatively untracked Pacific, she is\r\nmaking silent advances towards dominion. The vast continent of\r\nAustralia, which she has secured, forms its south-western boundary. And\r\npushed out six hundred miles eastward from this lies New Zealand, like a\r\nstrong outpost, its shores so scooped and torn by the waves that it must\r\nbe a very paradise of commodious bays and safe havens for the mariner.\r\nThe soil, too, is of extraordinary fertility; and the climate, though\r\nhumid, deals kindly with the Englishman\'s constitution. Nor is this all;\r\nfor, advanced from it, north and south, like picket stations, are\r\nNorfolk Island, and the Auckland group, both of which have good\r\nharbours. And it requires no prophet\'s eye to see that, when England\r\nneeds posts farther eastward, she will find them among the green coral\r\nislets that stud the Pacific.\r\n\r\nTurn now your steps homeward, and pause a moment at the Bermudas, those\r\nbeautiful isles, with their fresh verdure--green gems in the ocean, with\r\nair soft and balmy as Eden\'s was! They have their home uses too. They\r\nfurnish arrow-root for the sick, and ample supplies of vegetables\r\nearlier than sterner climates will yield them. Is this all that can be\r\nsaid? Reflect a little more deeply. These islands possess a great\r\nmilitary and naval dep\xc3\xb4t; and a splendid harbour, landlocked, strongly\r\nfortified, and difficult of access to strangers;--and all within a few\r\ndays\' sail of the chief ports of the Atlantic shores of the New World.\r\nEngland therefore retains them as a station on the road to her West\r\nIndian possessions; and should America go to war with her, she would use\r\nit as a base for offensive operations, where she might gather and whence\r\nshe might hurl upon any unprotected port all her gigantic naval and\r\nmilitary power.\r\n\r\n"Atlantic Monthly."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENGLAND, MY ENGLAND\r\n\r\n\r\n    What have I done for you,\r\n      England, my England?\r\n    What is there I would not do,\r\n      England, my own?\r\n    With your glorious eyes austere,\r\n    As the Lord were walking near,\r\n    Whispering terrible things and dear\r\n      As the Song on your bugles blown, England--\r\n      Round the world on your bugles blown!\r\n\r\n    Where shall the watchful sun,\r\n      England, my England,\r\n    Match the master-work you\'ve done,\r\n      England, my own?\r\n    When shall he rejoice agen\r\n    Such a breed of mighty men\r\n    As come forward, one to ten,\r\n      To the Song on your bugles blown, England--\r\n      Down the years on your bugles blown?\r\n\r\n    Ever the faith endures,\r\n      England, my England:--\r\n    "Take and break us: we are yours,\r\n      England, my own!\r\n    Life is good, and joy runs high\r\n    Between English earth and sky:\r\n    Death is death; but we shall die\r\n      To the Song on your bugles blown, England--\r\n    To the stars on your bugles blown!"\r\n\r\n    They call you proud and hard,\r\n      England, my England:\r\n    You with worlds to watch and ward,\r\n      England, my own!\r\n    You whose mailed hand keeps the keys\r\n    Of such teeming destinies,\r\n    You could know nor dread nor ease\r\n      Were the Song on your bugles blown, England--\r\n      Round the Pit on your bugles blown!\r\n\r\n    Mother of Ships whose might,\r\n      England, my England,\r\n    Is the fierce old Sea\'s delight,\r\n      England, my own,\r\n    Chosen daughter of the Lord,\r\n    Spouse-in-Chief of the ancient Sword,\r\n    There\'s the menace of the Word\r\n      In the Song on your bugles blown, England--\r\n      Out of heaven on your bugles blown!\r\n\r\nW.

I believe that half the people that talk about war have not\r\nthe slightest idea what it is. In a short sentence it may be summed up\r\nto be the combination and concentration of all the horrors, atrocities,\r\ncrimes, and sufferings of which human nature on this globe is capable.\r\n\r\nIf you go into war now, you will have more banners to decorate your\r\ncathedrals and churches. Englishmen will fight now as well as they ever\r\ndid; and there is ample power to back them, if the country can be but\r\nsufficiently excited and deluded. You may raise up great generals. You\r\nmay have another Wellington, and another Nelson, too; for this country\r\ncan grow men capable of every enterprise. Then there may be titles, and\r\npensions, and marble monuments to eternize the men who have thus become\r\ngreat;--but what becomes of you, and your country, and your children?\r\n\r\nYou profess to be a Christian nation. You make it your boast\r\neven--though boasting is somewhat out of place in such questions--you\r\nmake it your boast that you are a Christian people, and that you draw\r\nyour rule of doctrine and practice, as from a well pure and undefiled,\r\nfrom the lively oracles of God, and from the direct revelation of the\r\nOmnipotent. You have even conceived the magnificent project of\r\nilluminating the whole earth, even to its remotest and darkest recesses,\r\nby the dissemination of the volume of the New Testament, in whose every\r\npage are written for ever the words of peace. Within the limits of this\r\nisland alone, every Sabbath-day, twenty thousand, yes, far more than\r\ntwenty thousand temples are thrown open, in which devout men and women\r\nassemble to worship Him who is the "Prince of Peace."\r\n\r\nIs this a reality? or is your Christianity a romance, and your\r\nprofession a dream? No; I am sure that your Christianity is not a\r\nromance, and I am equally sure that your profession is not a dream. It\r\nis because I believe this that I appeal to you with confidence, and that\r\nI have hope and faith in the future. I believe that we shall see, and at\r\nno very distant time, sound economic principles spreading much more\r\nwidely amongst the people; a sense of justice growing up in a soil which\r\nhitherto has been deemed unfruitful; and--which will be better than\r\nall--the churches of the United Kingdom, the churches of Britain,\r\nawaking as it were from their slumbers, and girding up their loins to\r\nmore glorious work, when they shall not only accept and believe in the\r\nprophecy, but labour earnestly for its fulfilment, that there shall come\r\na time--a blessed time--a time which shall last for ever--when "nation\r\nshall not lift up sword against nation, neither shall they learn war any\r\nmore."\r\n\r\nJohn Bright\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOMES OF ENGLAND\r\n\r\n\r\n    The stately homes of England!\r\n      How beautiful they stand,\r\n    Amidst their tall ancestral trees,\r\n      O\'er all the pleasant land!\r\n    The deer across their greensward bound,\r\n      Through shade and sunny gleam:\r\n    And the swan glides past them with the sound\r\n      Of some rejoicing stream.\r\n\r\n    The merry homes of England!\r\n      Around their hearths by night,\r\n    What gladsome looks of household love\r\n      Meet in the ruddy light!\r\n    There woman\'s voice flows forth in song,\r\n      Or childhood\'s tale is told,\r\n    Or lips move tunefully along\r\n      Some glorious page of old.\r\n\r\n    The blessed homes of England!\r\n      How softly on their bowers\r\n    Is laid the holy quietness\r\n      That breathes from Sabbath hours!\r\n    Solemn, yet sweet, the church-bell\'s chime\r\n      Floats through their woods at morn;\r\n    All other sounds, in that still time,\r\n      Of breeze and leaf are born.\r\n\r\n    The cottage homes of England!\r\n      By thousands on her plains,\r\n    They are smiling o\'er the silvery brooks,\r\n      And round the hamlet fanes.\r\n    Through glowing orchards forth they peep,\r\n      Each from its nook of leaves;\r\n    And fearless there the lowly sleep,\r\n      As the bird beneath the eaves.\r\n\r\n    The free, fair homes of England!\r\n      Long, long, in hut and hall,\r\n    May hearts of native proof be reared\r\n      To guard each hallowed wall!\r\n    And green for ever be the groves,\r\n      And bright the flowery sod,\r\n    Where first the child\'s glad spirit loves\r\n      Its country and its God!\r\n\r\nFelicia Hemans\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO A WATER-FOWL\r\n\r\n\r\n            Whither, midst falling dew,\r\n    While glow the heavens with the last steps of day\r\n    Far, through their rosy depths, dost thou pursue\r\n            Thy solitary way?\r\n\r\n            Vainly the fowler\'s eye\r\n    Might mark thy distant flight to do thee wrong,\r\n    As, darkly seen against the crimson sky,\r\n            Thy figure floats along.\r\n\r\n            Seek\'st thou the plashy brink\r\n    Of weedy lake, or marge of river wide,\r\n    Or where the rocking billows rise and sink\r\n            On the chafed ocean side?\r\n\r\n            There is a Power whose care\r\n    Teaches thy way along that pathless coast,--\r\n    The desert and illimitable air,--\r\n            Lone wandering, but not lost.\r\n\r\n            All day thy wings have fanned,\r\n    At that far height, the cold, thin atmosphere,\r\n    Yet stoop not, weary, to the welcome land,\r\n            Though the dark night is near.\r\n\r\n            And soon that toil shall end;\r\n    Soon shalt thou find a summer home, and rest,\r\n    And scream among thy fellows; reeds shall bend,\r\n            Soon, o\'er thy sheltered nest.\r\n\r\n            Thou\'rt gone; the abyss of heaven\r\n    Hath swallowed up thy form; yet, on my heart\r\n    Deeply hath sunk the lesson thou hast given,\r\n            And shall not soon depart.\r\n\r\n            He who, from zone to zone,\r\n    Guides through the boundless sky thy certain flight,\r\n    In the long way that I must tread alone,\r\n            Will lead my steps aright.\r\n\r\nBryant\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FASCINATION OF LIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe strange fascination of light takes hold of all animated creatures,\r\nand commands a subtle devotion that cannot be set forth in a confession\r\nof faith. The delight of a boy in a bonfire is a breath of the heaven\r\nthat is about us in our infancy. Though it be but a heap of rubbish,\r\nrevealed by the removal of the mantle of snow, lighting up with\r\nflickering, changing glow a rectangular door yard, the children stand\r\nand gaze into the dancing flame, their vast, distorted, ghostlike\r\nshadows lost in the night, their faces reflecting every evanescent\r\nglare, and their spirits charmed by the same spell that took form in the\r\nfire-worship of their ancestors. How they delight in stirring up the\r\nembers and sending up a fountain spray of sparks! What joy in seeing the\r\nbig sticks break into glowing coals, darting out new tongues of flame to\r\nlick up the escaping embers!\r\n\r\nFire is one of nature\'s universal fascinations. The wildest and most\r\nwary animals approach and gaze at it in the night, and though it\r\nsometimes warns them off, it always holds them by a spell. The night\r\nmigrating birds perish in scores against the plate-glass of coast\r\nlighthouses, swerving from the control of the all-powerful migratory\r\ninstinct toward the fascinating glare that is their destruction. It is\r\nnot sportsmanlike to hang a lantern in the marsh and shoot the duck that\r\ngather under it. But the night, the silent marsh, and the lantern have\r\ncharms that the sportsman, with his legal and mechanical paraphernalia,\r\ncan never understand. Fish are devoted fire-worshippers, and that boy\r\nwho has never speared by a jack-light is an object of compassion.\r\n\r\nThe earth and the waters under the earth have no more fascinating sight\r\nthan the gray, silent form of a pike, moving and motionless in the\r\nshallow water, a shadow more tangible than himself thrown by a\r\njack-light on the mottled yellow rocks and sands of the bottom. A\r\npassing breath of wind, even the slightest motion of the punt, breaks\r\nevery shadow and indentation into myriad fleeting ripples and waves of\r\nlight, transforming the slender, silent fish into a sheaf of wriggling\r\nglimmers. With the stilling of the surface, the waiting pike and all the\r\nshadows and lights of the bottom grow once more still and distinct.\r\nThere floats the greatest cannibal of the fishes, paying his devotion\r\nto the flame, and above him stands the greatest cannibal of all created\r\nbeings, pointing his deadly spear.\r\n\r\nThere is no moon. The stars cannot penetrate the thickening clouds. The\r\nbay is still and its shores invisible, the distant light of a farmhouse\r\nonly serving to intensify the lonely silence. The savage joy of that\r\nmoment repays the boy for all his laborious preparations. He brought two\r\nboards down the river from the mill, and toiled at them with all the\r\ntools in the woodshed till the ends and edges were made smooth. He\r\ncollected lumber from all available sources for the ends and bottom,\r\nfastening them on with a miscellaneous collection of nails and springs.\r\nThen he patiently picked an old piece of tarred rope into oakum, and\r\ncaulked it into the seams with a sharpened gate-hinge. He notched a pine\r\ntree, gathered the gum and boiled it into pitch to make the joints\r\ntight. That extraordinary pair of oars he sawed, chopped, and whittled\r\nfrom an old plank. The spear is a family relic which he dug up and\r\nfitted with a white-ash pole, and the anchor is a long stone, tied by\r\nthe slack of a clothes-line. The jack is a basket made of old\r\npail-hoops, and fastened to an upright stick to hold the burning pine\r\nknot. Yet we wonder why it is always the country boy who succeeds in the\r\ncity!\r\n\r\nWill he too, be lured by the seductive glimmer? Will he turn away from\r\nthe conquest of nature and embark in the conquest of his fellow-mortals?\r\nWill he go to a resort for his fishing and a preserve for his shooting?\r\nWill that bunch of hair protruding from under his hat be worn thin and\r\ngray in scrambling after the delights of the vain and the covetous? Will\r\nhe devote his superb strength of body and mind to outstripping and\r\ncircumventing his fellows in the pursuit of that transient glimmer, that\r\nall-alluring _ignis fatuus_ which the Babylon world calls success?\r\n\r\nS.

Lillo, a boy\r\nof fifteen, sat on the ground, with his back against the angle of the\r\ndoor-post, and his long legs stretched out, while he held a large book\r\nopen on his knee, and occasionally made a dash with his hand at an\r\ninquisitive fly, with an air of interest stronger than that excited by\r\nthe finely-printed copy of Petrarch which he kept open at one place, as\r\nif he were learning something by heart.\r\n\r\nRomola sat nearly opposite Lillo, but she was not observing him. Her\r\nhands were crossed on her lap, and her eyes were fixed absently on the\r\ndistant mountains: she was evidently unconscious of anything around her.\r\nAn eager life had left its marks upon her: the finely-moulded cheek had\r\nsunk a little, the golden crown was less massive; but there was a\r\nplacidity on Romola\'s face which had never belonged to it in youth. It\r\nis but once that we can know our worst sorrows, and Romola had known\r\nthem while life was new.\r\n\r\nAbsorbed in this way, she was not at first aware that Lillo had ceased\r\nto look at his book, and was watching her with a slightly impatient air,\r\nwhich meant that he wanted to talk to her, but was not quite sure\r\nwhether she would like that entertainment just now. But persevering\r\nlooks make themselves felt at last. Romola did presently turn away her\r\neyes from the distance and met Lillo\'s impatient dark gaze with a\r\nbrighter and brighter smile. He shuffled along the floor, still keeping\r\nthe book on his lap, till he got close to her and lodged his chin on\r\nher knee.\r\n\r\n"What is it, Lillo?" said Romola, pulling his hair back from his brow.\r\nLillo was a handsome lad, but his features were turning out to be more\r\nmassive and less regular than his father\'s. The blood of the Tuscan\r\npeasant was in his veins.\r\n\r\n"Mamma Romola, what am I to be?" he said, well contented that there was\r\na prospect of talking till it would be too late to con Petrarch any\r\nlonger.\r\n\r\n"What should you like to be, Lillo? You might be a scholar. My father\r\nwas a scholar, you know, and taught me a great deal. That is the reason\r\nwhy I can teach you."\r\n\r\n"Yes," said Lillo, rather hesitatingly. "But he is old and blind in the\r\npicture. Did he get a great deal of glory?"\r\n\r\n"Not much, Lillo. The world was not always very kind to him, and he saw\r\nmeaner men than himself put into higher places because they could\r\nflatter and say what was false. And then his dear son thought it right\r\nto leave him and become a monk; and after that, my father, being blind\r\nand lonely, felt unable to do the things that would have made his\r\nlearning of greater use to men, so that he might still have lived in\r\nhis works after he was in his grave."\r\n\r\n"I should not like that sort of life," said Lillo, "I should like to be\r\nsomething that would make me a great man, and very happy\r\nbesides--something that would not hinder me from having a good deal of\r\npleasure."\r\n\r\n"That is not easy, my Lillo. It is only a poor sort of happiness that\r\ncould ever come by caring very much about our own narrow pleasures. We\r\ncan have the highest happiness, such as goes along with being a great\r\nman, only by having wide thoughts, and much feeling for the rest of the\r\nworld as well as ourselves; and this sort of happiness often brings so\r\nmuch pain with it, that we can tell it from pain only by its being what\r\nwe would choose before everything, because our souls see it is good.\r\nThere are so many things wrong and difficult in the world, that no man\r\ncan be great--he can hardly keep himself from wickedness--unless he\r\ngives up thinking much about pleasure or rewards, and gets strength to\r\nendure what is hard and painful. My father had the greatness that\r\nbelongs to integrity; he chose poverty and obscurity rather than\r\nfalsehood. And so, my Lillo, if you mean to act nobly and seek to know\r\nthe best things God has put within reach of men, you must learn to fix\r\nyour mind on that end, and not on what will happen to you because of it.\r\nAnd remember, if you were to choose something lower, and make it the\r\nrule of your life to seek your own pleasure and escape from what is\r\ndisagreeable, calamity might come just the same; and it would be\r\ncalamity falling on a base mind, which is the one form of sorrow that\r\nhas no balm in it, and that may well make a man say, \'It would have been\r\nbetter for me if I had never been born.\' I will tell you something,\r\nLillo."\r\n\r\nRomola paused for a moment. She had taken Lillo\'s cheeks between her\r\nhands, and his young eyes were meeting hers.\r\n\r\n"There was a man to whom I was very near, so that I could see a great\r\ndeal of his life, who made almost everyone fond of him, for he was\r\nyoung, and clever, and beautiful, and his manners to all were gentle and\r\nkind. I believe, when I first knew him, he never thought of doing\r\nanything cruel or base. But because he tried to slip away from\r\neverything that was unpleasant, and cared for nothing else so much as\r\nhis own safety, he came at last to commit some of the basest deeds--such\r\nas make men infamous. He denied his father, and left him to misery; he\r\nbetrayed every trust that was reposed in him, that he might keep himself\r\nsafe and get rich and prosperous. Yet calamity overtook him."\r\n\r\nGeorge Eliot: "Romola."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRIVATE OF THE BUFFS\r\n\r\n\r\n    Last night among his fellows rough\r\n      He jested, quaffed, and swore:\r\n    A drunken private of the Buffs,\r\n      Who never looked before.\r\n    To-day, beneath the foeman\'s frown,\r\n      He stands in Elgin\'s place,\r\n    Ambassador from Britain\'s crown,\r\n      And type of all her race.\r\n\r\n    Poor, reckless, rude, low-born, untaught,\r\n      Bewildered and alone,\r\n    A heart, with English instinct fraught,\r\n      He yet can call his own.\r\n    Ay! tear his body limb from limb;\r\n      Bring cord, or axe, or flame!--\r\n    He only knows that not through him\r\n      Shall England come to shame.\r\n\r\n    Far Kentish hopfields round him seemed\r\n      Like dreams to come and go;\r\n    Bright leagues of cherry-blossom gleamed\r\n      One sheet of living snow:\r\n    The smoke above his father\'s door\r\n      In gray, soft eddyings hung:--\r\n    Must he then watch it rise no more,\r\n      Doomed by himself, so young?\r\n\r\n    Yes, Honour calls!--with strength like steel\r\n      He put the vision by:\r\n    Let dusky Indians whine and kneel;\r\n      An English lad must die!\r\n    And thus, with eyes that would not shrink,\r\n      With knee to man unbent,\r\n    Unfaltering on its dreadful brink\r\n      To his red grave he went.\r\n\r\n    Vain, mightiest fleets of iron framed;\r\n      Vain, those all-shattering guns;\r\n    Unless proud England keep, untamed,\r\n      The strong heart of her sons!\r\n    So, let his name through Europe ring--\r\n      A man of mean estate\r\n    Who died, as firm as Sparta\'s king,\r\n      Because his soul was great.\r\n\r\nF. H. Doyle\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHONOURABLE TOIL\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo men I honour, and no third. First, the toilworn Craftsman, that,\r\nwith earth-made Implement, laboriously conquers the Earth, and makes her\r\nman\'s. Venerable to me is the hard Hand; crooked, coarse; wherein,\r\nnotwithstanding, lies a cunning virtue, indefeasibly royal, as of the\r\nSceptre of this Planet. Venerable, too, is the rugged face, all\r\nweather-tanned, besoiled, with its rude intelligence; for it is the face\r\nof a Man living manlike. O, but the more venerable for thy rudeness, and\r\neven because we must pity as well as love thee! Hardly-entreated\r\nBrother! For us was thy back so bent, for us were thy straight limbs and\r\nfingers so deformed: thou wert our Conscript, on whom the lot fell, and\r\nfighting our battles wert so marred. For in thee, too, lay a god-created\r\nForm, but it was not to be unfolded; encrusted must it stand with the\r\nthick adhesions and defacements of Labour: and thy body, like thy soul,\r\nwas not to know freedom. Yet toil on, toil on: _thou_ art in thy duty,\r\nbe out of it who may; thou toilest for the altogether indispensable, for\r\ndaily bread.\r\n\r\nA second man I honour, and still more highly: him who is seen toiling\r\nfor the spiritually indispensable; not daily bread, but the bread of\r\nLife. Is not he, too, in his duty; endeavouring towards inward Harmony;\r\nrevealing this, by act or by word, through all his outward endeavours,\r\nbe they high or low? Highest of all, when his outward and his inward\r\nendeavour are one; when we can name him Artist; not earthly Craftsman\r\nonly, but inspired Thinker, who with heaven-made Implement conquers\r\nHeaven for us! If the poor and humble toil that we have Food, must not\r\nthe high and glorious toil for him in return, that he have Light, have\r\nGuidance, Freedom, Immortality?--These two, in all their degrees, I\r\nhonour: all else is chaff and dust, which let the wind blow whither it\r\nlisteth.\r\n\r\nUnspeakably touching is it, however, when I find both dignities united;\r\nand he, that must toil outwardly for the lowest of man\'s wants, is also\r\ntoiling inwardly for the highest. Sublimer in this world know I nothing\r\nthan a Peasant Saint, could such now anywhere be met with. Such a one\r\nwill take thee back to Nazareth itself; thou wilt see the splendour of\r\nHeaven spring forth from the humblest depths of Earth, like a light\r\nshining in great darkness.\r\n\r\nCarlyle: "Sartor Resartus."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON HIS BLINDNESS\r\n\r\n\r\n    When I consider how my light is spent\r\n      Ere half my days, in this dark world and wide,\r\n      And that one talent which is death to hide\r\n      Lodged with me useless, though my soul more bent\r\n    To serve therewith my Maker, and present\r\n      My true account, lest He returning chide;\r\n      "Doth God exact day labour, light denied?"\r\n      I fondly ask. But Patience, to prevent\r\n    That murmur, soon replies, "God doth not need\r\n      Either man\'s work, or His own gifts. Who best\r\n      Bear His mild yoke, they serve Him best: His state\r\n    Is kingly; thousands at His bidding speed,\r\n      And post o\'er land and ocean without rest:\r\n      They also serve who only stand and wait."\r\n\r\nMilton\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                So shall inferior eyes,\r\n    That borrow their behaviour from the great,\r\n    Grow great by your example and put on\r\n    The dauntless spirit of resolution.\r\n\r\nShakespeare\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMYSTERIOUS NIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\n    Mysterious Night!

Rise up, let us go; lo, he that\r\nbetrayeth me is at hand." Mark, XIV. 41, 42)\r\n\r\n\r\nThe words of Christ are not like the words of other men. His sentences\r\ndo not end with the occasion which called them forth: every sentence of\r\nChrist\'s is a deep principle of human life, and it is so with these\r\nsentences. The principle contained in "Sleep on now" is this, that the\r\npast is irreparable, and after a certain moment waking will do no good.\r\nYou may improve the future, the past is gone beyond recovery. As to all\r\nthat is gone by, so far as the hope of altering it goes, you may sleep\r\non and take your rest: there is no power in earth or heaven that can\r\nundo what has once been done.\r\n\r\nLet us proceed to give an illustration of this. This principle applies\r\nto a misspent youth. The young are by God\'s Providence, exempted in a\r\ngreat measure from anxiety; they are as the apostles were in relation to\r\ntheir Master: their friends stand between them and the struggles of\r\nexistence. They are not called upon to think for themselves: the burden\r\nis borne by others. They get their bread without knowing or caring how\r\nit is paid for: they smile and laugh without a suspicion of the anxious\r\nthoughts of day and night which a parent bears to enable them to smile.\r\nSo to speak, they are sleeping--and it is not a guilty sleep--while\r\nanother watches.\r\n\r\nMy young brethren--youth is one of the precious opportunities of\r\nlife--rich in blessing if you choose to make it so; but having in it the\r\nmaterials of undying remorse if you suffer it to pass unimproved. Your\r\nquiet Gethsemane is now. Do you know how you can imitate the apostles in\r\ntheir fatal sleep? You can suffer your young days to pass idly and\r\nuselessly away; you can live as if you had nothing to do but to enjoy\r\nyourselves: you can let others think for you, and not try to become\r\nthoughtful yourselves: till the business and difficulties of life come\r\nupon you unprepared, and you find yourselves like men waking from sleep,\r\nhurried, confused, scarcely able to stand, with all the faculties\r\nbewildered, not knowing right from wrong, led headlong to evil, just\r\nbecause you have not given yourselves in time to learn what is good. All\r\nthat is sleep.\r\n\r\nAnd now let us mark it. You cannot repair that in after-life. Oh!\r\nremember every period of human life has its own lesson, and you cannot\r\nlearn that lesson in the next period. The boy has one set of lessons to\r\nlearn, and the young man another, and the grown-up man another. Let us\r\nconsider one single instance. The boy has to learn docility, gentleness\r\nof temper, reverence, submission. All those feelings which are to be\r\ntransferred afterwards in full cultivation to God, like plants nursed in\r\na hotbed and then planted out, are to be cultivated first in youth.\r\nAfterwards, those habits which have been merely habits of obedience to\r\nan earthly parent, are to become religious submission to a heavenly\r\nparent. Our parents stand to us in the place of God. Veneration for our\r\nparents is intended to become afterwards adoration for something higher.\r\nTake that single instance; and now suppose that _that_ is not learned in\r\nboyhood. Suppose that the boy sleeps to the duty of veneration, and\r\nlearns only flippancy, insubordination, and the habit of deceiving his\r\nfather,--can that, my young brethren, be repaired afterwards? Humanly\r\nspeaking not. Life is like the transition from class to class in a\r\nschool. The school-boy who has not learned arithmetic in the earlier\r\nclasses, cannot secure it when he comes to mechanics in the higher: each\r\nsection has its own sufficient work. He may be a good philosopher or a\r\ngood historian, but a bad arithmetician he remains for life; for he\r\ncannot lay the foundation at the moment when he must be building the\r\nsuperstructure. The regiment which has not perfected itself in its\r\nmanoeuvres on the parade ground, cannot learn them before the guns of\r\nthe enemy. And just in the same way, the young person who has slept his\r\nyouth away, and become idle, and selfish, and hard, cannot make up for\r\nthat afterwards. He may do something, he may be religious--yes; but he\r\ncannot be what he might have been. There is a part of his heart which\r\nwill remain uncultivated to the end. The apostles could share their\r\nMaster\'s sufferings--they could not save him. Youth has its irreparable\r\npast.\r\n\r\nAnd therefore, my young brethren, let it be impressed upon\r\nyou,--now is a time, infinite in its value for eternity, which\r\nwill never return again. Sleep not; learn that there is a very solemn\r\nwork of heart which must be done while the stillness of the garden of\r\nGethsemane gives you time. Now, or Never. The treasures at your command\r\nare infinite. Treasures of time--treasures of youth--treasures of\r\nopportunity that grown-up men would sacrifice everything they have to\r\npossess. Oh for ten years of youth back again with the added experience\r\nof age! But it cannot be: they must be content to sleep on now and take\r\ntheir rest.\r\n\r\nRev. F. W. Robertson: "Sermons."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA CHRISTMAS HYMN, 1837\r\n\r\n\r\n    It was the calm and silent night:--\r\n      Seven hundred years and fifty-three\r\n    Had Rome been growing up to might,\r\n      And now was Queen of land and sea!\r\n    No sound was heard of clashing wars;\r\n      Peace brooded o\'er the hushed domain;\r\n    Apollo, Pallas, Jove, and Mars\r\n      Held undisturbed their ancient reign,\r\n        In the solemn midnight\r\n          Centuries ago!\r\n\r\n    \'Twas in the calm and silent night!\r\n      The senator of haughty Rome\r\n    Impatient urged his chariot\'s flight,\r\n      From lordly revel rolling home!\r\n    Triumphal arches gleaming swell\r\n      His breast with thoughts of boundless sway;\r\n    What recked the Roman what befell\r\n      A paltry province far away,\r\n        In the solemn midnight\r\n          Centuries ago!\r\n\r\n    Within that province far away\r\n      Went plodding home a weary boor:\r\n    A streak of light before him lay,\r\n      Fallen through a half-shut stable door\r\n    Across his path. He passed--for nought\r\n      Told what was going on within;\r\n    How keen the stars! his only thought;\r\n      The air, how calm and cold and thin,\r\n        In the solemn midnight\r\n          Centuries ago!\r\n\r\n    O strange indifference!--low and high\r\n      Drowsed over common joys and cares:\r\n    The earth was still--but knew not why;\r\n      The world was listening--unawares;\r\n    How calm a moment may precede\r\n      One that shall thrill the world for ever!\r\n    To that still moment none would heed,\r\n      Man\'s doom was linked no more to sever\r\n        In the solemn midnight\r\n          Centuries ago!\r\n\r\n    It is the calm and solemn night!\r\n      A thousand bells ring out, and throw\r\n    Their joyous peals abroad, and smite\r\n      The darkness, charmed and holy _now_!\r\n    The night that erst no name had worn,\r\n      To it a happy name is given;\r\n    For in that stable lay new-born\r\n      The peaceful Prince of Earth and Heaven,\r\n        In the solemn midnight\r\n          Centuries ago.\r\n\r\nA. Domett\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE QUARREL\r\n\r\n  _Enter_ Brutus _and_ Cassius\r\nCas. That you have wrong\'d me doth appear in this:\r\n  You have condemn\'d and noted Lucius Pella\r\n  For taking bribes here of the Sardians;\r\n  Wherein my letters, praying on his side,\r\n  Because I knew the man, were slighted off.\r\n\r\nBru. You wrong\'d yourself to write in such a case.\r\n\r\nCas. In such a time as this it is not meet\r\n  That every nice offence should bear his comment.\r\n\r\nBru. Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself\r\n  Are much condemn\'d to have an itching palm;\r\n  To sell and mart your offices for gold\r\n  To undeservers.\r\n\r\nCas.      I an itching palm!\r\n  You know that you are Brutus that speak this,\r\n  Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.\r\n\r\nBru. The name of Cassius honours this corruption,\r\n  And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.\r\n\r\nCas. Chastisement!\r\n\r\nBru. Remember March, the ides of March remember:\r\n  Did not great Julius bleed for justice\' sake?\r\n  What villain touch\'d his body, that did stab,\r\n  And not for justice? What, shall one of us,\r\n  That struck the foremost man of all this world\r\n  But for supporting robbers, shall we now\r\n  Contaminate our fingers with base bribes,\r\n  And sell the mighty space of our large honours\r\n  For so much trash as may be grasped thus?\r\n  I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,\r\n  Than such a Roman.\r\n\r\nCas.     Brutus, bay not me;\r\n  I\'ll not endure it: you forget yourself,\r\n  To hedge me in; I am a soldier, I,\r\n  Older in practice, abler than yourself\r\n  To make conditions.\r\n\r\nBru.   Go to; you are not, Cassius.\r\n\r\nCas. I am.\r\n\r\nBru. I say you are not.\r\n\r\nCas. Urge me no more, I shall forget myself;\r\n  Have mind upon your health, tempt me no farther.\r\n\r\nBru. Away, slight man!\r\n\r\nCas. Is\'t possible?\r\n\r\nBru.                       Hear me, for I will speak.\r\n  Must I give way and room to your rash choler?\r\n  Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?\r\n\r\nCas. O ye gods, ye gods! must I endure all this?\r\n\r\nBru. All this! ay, more: fret till your proud heart break;\r\n  Go show your slaves how choleric you are,\r\n  And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?\r\n  Must I observe you? must I stand and crouch\r\n  Under your testy humour? By the gods,\r\n  You shall digest the venom of your spleen,\r\n  Though it do split you; for, from this day forth,\r\n  I\'ll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,\r\n  When you are waspish.\r\n\r\nCas.     Is it come to this?\r\n\r\nBru. You say you are a better soldier:\r\n  Let it appear so; make your vaunting true,\r\n  And it shall please me well: for mine own part,\r\n  I shall be glad to learn of noble men.\r\n\r\nCas. You wrong me every way; you wrong me, Brutus;\r\n  I said, an elder soldier, not a better:\r\n  Did I say "better"?\r\n\r\nBru.      If you did, I care not.\r\n\r\nCas. When C\xc3\xa6sar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.\r\n\r\nBru. Peace, peace! you durst not so have tempted him.\r\n\r\nCas. I durst not!\r\n\r\nBru. No.\r\n\r\nCas. What, durst not tempt him!\r\n\r\nBru.      For your life you durst not.\r\n\r\nCas. Do not presume too much upon my love;\r\n  I may do that I shall be sorry for.\r\n\r\nBru. You have done that you should be sorry for.\r\n  There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,\r\n  For I am arm\'d so strong in honesty\r\n  That they pass by me as the idle wind,\r\n  Which I respect not. I did send to you\r\n  For certain sums of gold, which you denied me:\r\n  For I can raise no money by vile means:\r\n  By heaven, I had rather coin my heart,\r\n  And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring\r\n  From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash\r\n  By any indirection: I did send\r\n  To you for gold to pay my legions,\r\n  Which you denied me: was that done like Cassius?\r\n  Should I have answer\'d Caius Cassius so?\r\n  When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,\r\n  To lock such rascal counters from his friends,\r\n  Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts;\r\n  Dash him to pieces!\r\n\r\nCas.      I denied you not.\r\n\r\nBru. You did.\r\n\r\nCas. I did not: he was but a fool that brought\r\n  My answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart:\r\n  A friend should bear his friend\'s infirmities,\r\n  But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.\r\n\r\nBru. I do not, till you practise them on me.\r\n\r\nCas. You love me not.\r\n\r\nBru.      I do not like your faults.\r\n\r\nCas. A friendly eye could never see such faults.\r\n\r\nBru. A flatterer\'s would not, though they do appear\r\n  As huge as high Olympus.\r\n\r\nCas. Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,\r\n  Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,\r\n  For Cassius is aweary of the world;\r\n  Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;\r\n  Check\'d like a bondman; all his faults observ\'d,\r\n  Set in a note-book, learn\'d, and conn\'d by rote,\r\n  To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep\r\n  My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,\r\n  And here my naked breast; within, a heart\r\n  Dearer than Plutus\' mine, richer than gold;\r\n  If that thou be\'st a Roman, take it forth;\r\n  I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart;\r\n  Strike, as thou didst at C\xc3\xa6sar; for, I know,\r\n  When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better\r\n  Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.\r\n\r\nBru.     Sheath your dagger:\r\n  Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;\r\n  Do what you will, dishonour shall be humour.\r\n  O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb\r\n  That carries anger as the flint bears fire;\r\n  Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,\r\n  And straight is cold again.\r\n\r\nCas.      Hath Cassius lived\r\n  To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,\r\nWhen grief, and blood ill-temper\'d, vexeth him?\r\n\r\nBru. When I spoke that I was ill-temper\'d too.\r\n\r\nCas. Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.\r\n\r\nBru. And my heart too.\r\n\r\nCas.      O Brutus!\r\n\r\nBru.                        What\'s the matter?\r\n\r\nCas. Have not you love enough to bear with me,\r\n  When that rash humour which my mother gave me,\r\n  Makes me forgetful?\r\n\r\nBru.   Yes, Cassius; and, from henceforth,\r\n  When you are over-earnest with your Brutus,\r\n  He\'ll think your mother chides, and leave you so.\r\n\r\nShakespeare: "Julius C\xc3\xa6sar," IV. 3\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRECESSIONAL\r\n\r\n(1897)\r\n\r\n\r\n    God of our fathers, known of old,\r\n      Lord of our far-flung battle-line,\r\n    Beneath whose awful Hand we hold\r\n      Dominion over palm and pine--\r\n    Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,\r\n    Lest we forget--lest we forget!\r\n\r\n    The tumult and the shouting dies;\r\n      The captains and the kings depart:\r\n    Still stands Thine ancient sacrifice,\r\n      An humble and a contrite heart.\r\n    Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,\r\n    Lest we forget--lest we forget!\r\n\r\n    Far-called our navies melt away;\r\n      On dune and headland sinks the fire:\r\n    Lo, all our pomp of yesterday\r\n      Is one with Nineveh and Tyre!\r\n    Judge of the Nations, spare us yet,\r\n    Lest we forget--lest we forget!\r\n\r\n    If, drunk with sight of power, we loose\r\n      Wild tongues that have not Thee in awe,\r\n    Such boasting as the Gentiles use,\r\n      Or lesser breeds without the Law--\r\n    Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,\r\n    Lest we forget--lest we forget!\r\n\r\n    For heathen heart that puts her trust\r\n      In reeking tube and iron shard,\r\n    All valiant dust that builds on dust,\r\n      And guarding, calls not Thee to guard,\r\n    For frantic boast and foolish word--\r\n    Thy mercy on Thy People, Lord!

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive\r\nFoundation\r\n\r\nThe Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit\r\n501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the\r\nstate of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal\r\nRevenue Service.  The Foundation\'s EIN or federal tax identification\r\nnumber is 64-6221541.  Contributions to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent\r\npermitted by U.S. federal laws and your state\'s laws.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation\'s principal office is located at 4557 Melan Dr. S.\r\nFairbanks, AK, 99712., but its volunteers and employees are scattered\r\nthroughout numerous locations.  Its business office is located at\r\n809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887, email\r\nbusiness@pglaf.org.

Newby\r\n     Chief Executive and Director\r\n     gbnewby@pglaf.org\r\n\r\nSection 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.\r\nTo donate, please visit:\r\nhttp://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
