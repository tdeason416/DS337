To some extent this is both wise\r\nand necessary; but in following it in this instance the attempt has been\r\nmade to treat the colonial period as the childhood of the United States;\r\nto have it bear the same relation to our later career that the account\r\nof the youth of a great man should bear to that of his maturer years,\r\nand to confine it to the narration of such events as are really\r\nnecessary to a correct understanding of what has happened since 1776.\r\n\r\nThe story, therefore, has been restricted to the discoveries,\r\nexplorations, and settlements within the United States by the English,\r\nFrench, Spaniards, and Dutch; to the expulsion of the French by the\r\nEnglish; to the planting of the thirteen colonies on the Atlantic\r\nseaboard; to the origin and progress of the quarrel which ended with the\r\nrise of thirteen sovereign free and independent states, and to the\r\ngrowth of such political institutions as began in colonial times. This\r\nperiod once passed, the long struggle for a government followed till our\r\npresent Constitution--one of the most remarkable political instruments\r\never framed by man--was adopted, and a nation founded.\r\n\r\nScarcely was this accomplished when the French Revolution and the rise\r\nof Napoleon involved us in a struggle, first for our neutral rights, and\r\nthen for our commercial independence, and finally in a second war with\r\nGreat Britain. During this period of nearly five and twenty years,\r\ncommerce and agriculture flourished exceedingly, but our internal\r\nresources were little developed. With the peace of 1815, however, the\r\nera of industrial development commences, and this has been treated with\r\ngreat--though it is believed not too great--fullness of detail; for,\r\nbeyond all question, _the_ event of the world\'s history during the\r\nnineteenth century is the growth of the United States. Nothing like it\r\nhas ever before taken place.\r\n\r\nTo have loaded down the book with extended bibliographies would have\r\nbeen an easy matter, but quite unnecessary. The teacher will find in\r\nChanning and Hart\'s _Guide to the Study of American History_ the best\r\ndigested and arranged bibliography of the subject yet published, and\r\ncannot afford to be without it. If the student has time and disposition\r\nto read one half of the reference books cited in the footnotes of this\r\nhistory, he is most fortunate.\r\n\r\nJOHN BACH McMASTER.\r\n\r\nUNIVERSITY OF PENNSYLVANIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER\r\n\r\nI.

Nations that have owned our Soil.%--Before the United States\r\nbecame a nation, six European powers owned, or claimed to own, various\r\nportions of the territory now contained within its boundary. England\r\nclaimed the Atlantic coast from Maine to Florida. Spain once held\r\nFlorida, Texas, California, and all the territory south and west of\r\nColorado. France in days gone by ruled the Mississippi valley. Holland\r\nonce owned New Jersey, Delaware, and the valley of the Hudson in New\r\nYork, and claimed as far eastward as the Connecticut river. The Swedes\r\nhad settlements on the Delaware. Alaska was a Russian possession.\r\n\r\nBefore attempting to narrate the history of our country, it is\r\nnecessary, therefore, to tell\r\n\r\n1. How European nations came into possession of parts of it.\r\n\r\n2. How these parts passed from them to us.\r\n\r\n3. What effect the ownership of parts of our country by Europeans had on\r\nour history and institutions before 1776.\r\n\r\n%2. European Trade with the East; the Old Routes.%--For two hundred\r\nyears before North and South America were known to exist, a splendid\r\ntrade had been going on between Europe and the East Indies. Ships loaded\r\nwith metals, woods, and pitch went from European seaports to Alexandria\r\nand Constantinople, and brought back silks and cashmeres, muslins,\r\ndyewoods, spices, perfumes, ivory, precious stones, and pearls. This\r\ntrade in course of time had come to be controlled by the two Italian\r\ncities of Venice and Genoa. The merchants of Genoa sent their ships to\r\nConstantinople and the ports of the Black Sea, where they took on board\r\nthe rich fabrics and spices which by boats and by caravans had come up\r\nthe valley of the Euphrates and the Tigris from the Persian Gulf. The\r\nmen of Venice, on the other hand, sent their vessels to Alexandria, and\r\ncarried on their trade with the East through the Red Sea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Routes to India]\r\n\r\n%3. New Routes wanted.%--Splendid as this trade was, however, it was\r\ndoomed to destruction. Slowly, but surely, the Turks thrust themselves\r\nacross the caravan routes, cutting off one by one the great feeders of\r\nthe Oriental trade, till, with the capture of Constantinople in 1453,\r\nthey destroyed the commercial career of Genoa. As their power was\r\nspreading rapidly over Syria and toward Egypt, the prosperity of Venice,\r\nin turn, was threatened. The day seemed near when all trade between the\r\nIndies and Europe would be ended, and men began to ask if it were not\r\npossible to find an ocean route to Asia.\r\n\r\nNow, it happened that just at this time the Portuguese were hard at work\r\non the discovery of such a route, and were slowly pushing their way down\r\nthe western coast of Africa. But as league after league of that coast\r\nwas discovered, it was thought that the route to India by way of Africa\r\nwas too long for the purposes of commerce.[1] Then came the question, Is\r\nthere not a shorter route? and this Columbus tried to answer.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Read the account of Portuguese exploration in search of a\r\nway to India, in Fiske\'s _Discovery of America_, Vol. I., pp. 274-334.]\r\n\r\n%4. Columbus seeks the East and finds America.%[2]--Columbus was a\r\nnative of Genoa, in Italy. He began a seafaring life at fourteen, and in\r\nthe intervals between his voyages made maps and globes. As Portugal was\r\nthen the center of nautical enterprise, he wandered there about 1470,\r\nand probably went on one or two voyages down the coast of Africa. In\r\n1473 he married a Portuguese woman. Her father had been one of the King\r\nof Portugal\'s famous navigators, and had left behind him at his death a\r\nquantity of charts and notes; and it was while Columbus was studying\r\nthem that the idea of seeking the Indies by sailing due westward seems\r\nto have first started in his mind. But many a year went by, and many a\r\nhardship had to be borne, and many an insult patiently endured in\r\npoverty and distress, before the Friday morning in August, 1492, when\r\nhis three caravels, the _Santa Maria_ (sahn\'-tah mah-ree\'-ah), the\r\n_Pinta_ (peen\'-tah), and the _Ni\xc3\xb1a_ (neen\'-yah), sailed from the port of\r\nPalos (pah\'-los), in Spain.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: There is reason to believe that about the year 1000 A.D.\r\nthe northeast coast of America was discovered by a Norse voyager named\r\nLeif Ericsson. The records are very meager; but the discovery of our\r\ncountry by such a people is possible and not improbable. For an account\r\nof the pre-Columbian discoveries see Fiske\'s _Discovery of America_,\r\nVol. I., pp. 148-255.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Santa Maria]\r\n\r\nHis course led first to the Canary Islands, where he turned and went\r\ndirectly westward. The earth was not then generally believed to be\r\nround. Men supposed it to be flat, and the only parts of it known to\r\nEuropeans were Iceland, the British Isles, the continent of Europe, a\r\nsmall part of Asia, and a strip along the coast of the northern part of\r\nAfrica. The ocean on which Columbus was now embarked, and which in our\r\ntime is crossed in less than a week, was then utterly unknown, and was\r\nwell named "The Sea of Darkness." Little wonder, then, that as the\r\nshores of the last of the Canaries sank out of sight on the 9th of\r\nSeptember, many of the sailors wept, wailed, and loudly bemoaned their\r\ncruel fate. After sailing for what seemed a very long time, they saw\r\nsigns of land. But when no land appeared, their hopes gave way to fear,\r\nand they rose against Columbus in order to force him to return.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ni\xc3\xb1a]\r\n\r\nBut he calmed their fears, explained the sights they could not\r\nunderstand, hid from them the true distance sailed, and kept steadily on\r\nwestward till October 7, when a flock of land birds were seen flying to\r\nthe southwest. Pinzon (peen-thon\'), who commanded one of the vessels,\r\nbegged Columbus to follow the birds, as they seemed to be going toward\r\nland. Had the little fleet kept on its way, it would have brought up on\r\nthe coast of Florida. But Columbus yielded to Pinzon. The ships were\r\nheaded southwestward, and about ten o\'clock on the night of October 11,\r\nColumbus saw a light moving in the distance. It was made by the\r\ninhabitants going from hut to hut on a neighboring coast. At dawn the\r\nshore itself was seen by a sailor, and Columbus, followed by many of his\r\nmen, hastened to the beach, where, October 12, 1492, he raised a huge\r\ncross, and took possession of the country in the name of Ferdinand and\r\nIsabella, King and Queen of Spain, who had supplied him with caravels\r\nand men.[1] He had landed on one of a group of islands which we call the\r\nBahamas.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Columbus called the new land San Salvador (sahn\r\nsahl-vah-dor\', Holy Savior), because October 12, the day on which it was\r\ndiscovered, was so named in the Spanish calendar.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Three islands of this group, Cat, Turks, and Watlings, have\r\nrival claims as the landing place of Columbus. At present, Watlings\r\nIsland is believed to be the one on which he first set foot. Read an\r\naccount of the voyage in Fiske\'s _Discovery of America_, Vol. I., pp.\r\n408-442; Irving\'s _Life and Voyages of Columbus_, Vol. I., Book III.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Coat of arms of Columbus]\r\n\r\nDuring ten days he sailed among these islands. Then, turning southward,\r\nhe coasted along Cuba to the eastern end, and so to Haiti, which he\r\nnamed Hispaniola, or Little Spain. There the _Santa Maria_ was wrecked.\r\nThe _Pinta_ had by this time deserted him, and, as the _Ni\xc3\xb1a_ could not\r\ncarry all the men, forty were left at Hispaniola, to found the first\r\ncolony of Europeans in the New World. Giving the men food enough to last\r\na year, Columbus set sail for Spain on the 3d of January, 1493, and on\r\nMarch 15 was safe at Palos.\r\n\r\nOf the greatness of his discovery, Columbus had not the faintest idea.\r\nThat he had found a new world; that a continent was blocking his way to\r\nthe East, never entered his mind. He supposed he had landed on some\r\nislands off the east coast of Asia, and as that coast was called the\r\nIndies, and as the islands were reached by sailing westward, they came\r\nto be called the West Indies, and their inhabitants Indians; and the\r\nnative races of the New World have ever since been called Indians.\r\nAlthough Columbus in after years made three more voyages to the New\r\nWorld, he never found out his mistake, and died firm in the belief that\r\nhe had discovered a direct route to Asia.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Columbus began his second voyage in September, 1493, and\r\ndiscovered Jamaica, Porto Rico (por\'-to ree\'-co), and the islands of the\r\nCaribbean Sea. On his third voyage, in 1498, he discovered the island of\r\nTrinidad, off the coast of Venezuela, and saw South America at the mouth\r\nof the Orinoco River. During his fourth and last voyage, 1502-1504, he\r\nexplored the shores of Honduras and the Isthmus of Panama in search of a\r\nstrait leading to the Indian Ocean. Of course he did not find it, and,\r\ngoing back to Spain, he died poor and broken-hearted on May 20, 1506.]\r\n\r\n%5. The Atlantic Coast explored.%--And now that Columbus had shown\r\nthe way, others were quick to follow. In 1497 and 1498 came John and\r\nSebastian Cabot (cab\'-ot), sailing under the flag of England, and\r\nexploring our coast from Labrador to Cape Cod; and Pinzon and Solis,\r\nwith Vespucius[2] for pilot, sailing under the flag of Spain along the\r\nshores of the Gulf of Mexico, around the peninsula of Florida, and\r\nnorthward to Chesapeake Bay. Between 1500 and 1502 two Portuguese\r\nnavigators named Cortereal (cor-ta-ra-ahl\') went over much the same\r\nground as the Cabots. For the time being, however, these voyages were\r\nfruitless. It was not a new world, but China and Japan, the Indian\r\nOcean, and the spice islands, that Europe was seeking. When, therefore,\r\nin 1497, Vasco da Gama sailed from Lisbon, passed around the end of\r\nAfrica, reached India, and came back to Portugal in 1499 with his ship\r\nladen with the silks and spices of the East, all explorers turned\r\nsouthward, and for eleven years after the visit of the Cortereals no\r\nvoyages were made to North America.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: As this man was an Italian, his name was really Amerigo\r\nVespucci (ah-ma\'-ree-go ves-poot\'-chee), but it is usually given in its\r\nLatinized form, Americus Vespucius (a-mer\'-i-cus ves-pu\'-she-us).]\r\n\r\n%6. Why the Continent was called America.%--But some great voyages\r\nmeantime were made to South America. In 1500 a Portuguese fleet of\r\nthirteen vessels, commanded by Cabral, started from Portugal for the\r\nEast. In place of following the usual route and hugging the west coast\r\nof Africa, Cabral went off so far to the westward that one day in April,\r\n1500, he was amazed to see land. It proved to be what is now Brazil, and\r\nafter sailing along a little way he sent one of his vessels home to\r\nPortugal with the news.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: %DISCOVERY% ON THE EAST COAST OF %AMERICA%]\r\n\r\nHe did this because six years before, in June, 1494, Spain and Portugal\r\nmade a treaty and agreed that a meridian should be drawn 370 leagues\r\nwest of the Cape Verde Islands and be known as "The Line of Demarcation"\r\nAll heathen lands discovered, no matter by whom, to the east of this\r\nline, were to belong to Portugal; all to the west of it were to be the\r\nproperty of Spain. Now, as the strange coast seemed to be east of the\r\nline of demarcation, and therefore the property of Portugal, Cabral sent\r\nword to the King that he might explore it.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, in May, 1501, the King sent out three ships in charge of\r\nAmericus Vespucius. Vespucius sighted the coast somewhere about Cape St.\r\nRoque, and, finding that it was east of the line of demarcation,\r\nexplored it southward as far as the mouth of the river La Plata. As he\r\nwas then west of the line, and off a coast which belonged to Spain, he\r\nturned and sailed southeastward till he struck the island of South\r\nGeorgia, where the Antarctic cold and the fields of floating ice stopped\r\nhim and sent him back to Lisbon.\r\n\r\nThe results of this great voyage were many. In the first place, it\r\nsecured Brazil for Portugal. In the second place, it changed the\r\ngeographical ideas of the time. The great length of coast line explored\r\nproved that the land was not a mere island, but that Vespucius had found\r\na new continent in the southern hemisphere,--off the coast of Asia, as\r\nwas then supposed. This for a time was called the "Fourth Part" of the\r\nworld,--the other three parts being Europe, Asia, and Africa. But in\r\n1507 a German professor published a little book on geography, in which\r\nhe suggested that the new part of the world discovered by Americus, the\r\npart which we call Brazil, should be called America.\r\n\r\nAs Columbus was not supposed to have discovered a new world, but merely\r\na new route to Asia, this suggestion seemed very proper, and soon the\r\nword "America" began to appear on maps as the name of Brazil. After a\r\nwhile it was applied to all South America, and finally to North\r\nAmerica also.\r\n\r\n%7. The Pacific discovered; the Mexican Gulf Coast explored.%--A few\r\nyears after the publication of the little book which gave the New World\r\nthe name of America, a Spaniard named Balboa landed on the Isthmus of\r\nPanama, crossed it (1513), and from the mountains looked down on an\r\nendless expanse of blue water, which he called the South Sea, because\r\nwhen he first saw it he was looking south.\r\n\r\nMeantime another Spaniard, named Ponce de Leon (pon\'tha da la-on\'),\r\nsailed with three ships from Porto Rico, in March, 1513, and on the 27th\r\nof that month came in sight of the mainland. As the day was Easter\r\nSunday, which the Spaniards call Pascua (pas\'-coo-ah) Florida, he called\r\nthe country Florida.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map of 1515][1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Showing what was then supposed to be the shape and position\r\nof the newly discovered lands.]\r\n\r\nSix years later (1519) Pineda (pe-na\'-da) skirted the shores of the Gulf\r\nfrom Florida to Mexico.\r\n\r\n%8. Spaniards sail round the World.%--In the same year (1519) that\r\nPineda explored the Gulf coast, a Portuguese named Magellan (ma-jel\'-an)\r\nled a Spanish fleet across the Atlantic. He coasted along South America\r\nto Tierra del Fuego, entered the strait which now bears his name, passed\r\nwell up the western coast, and turning westward sailed toward India. He\r\nwas then on the ocean which Balboa had discovered and named the South\r\nSea. But Magellan found it so much smoother than the Atlantic that he\r\ncalled it the Pacific. Five ships and 254 men left Spain; but only one\r\nship and fifteen men returned to Spain by way of India and Cape of Good\r\nHope. Magellan himself was among the dead.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Magellan was killed by the natives of one of the Philippine\r\nIslands. The captain of the ship which made the voyage was greatly\r\nhonored. The King of Spain ennobled him, and on his coat of arms was a\r\nglobe representing the earth, and on it the motto "You first sailed\r\nround me."]\r\n\r\n%9. Importance of Magellan\'s Voyage.%--Of all the voyages ever made\r\nby man this was the greatest.[2] In the first place, it proved beyond\r\ndispute that the earth is round. In the second place, it proved that\r\nSouth America is a great continent, and that there is no short southwest\r\npassage to India.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: By all means read the account of this voyage by Fiske, in\r\nhis _Discovery of America_, Vol. II., pp. 190-211.]\r\n\r\n%10. Search for a Northwest Passage; our North Atlantic Coast\r\nexplored.%--All eyes, therefore, turned northward; the quest for a\r\nnorthwest passage began, and in that quest the Atlantic coast of the\r\nUnited States was examined most thoroughly.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\n1. Towards the close of the fifteenth century the Turks cut off the old\r\nroute of trade between Asia and Europe.\r\n\r\n2. In attempting to find a new way to Asia, the Portuguese then began to\r\nexplore the west coast of Africa.\r\n\r\n3. When at last they got well down the African coast it was thought that\r\nsuch a route was too long.\r\n\r\n4. Columbus (1492) then attempted to find a shorter way to Asia by\r\nsailing westward across the Atlantic Ocean, and landed on some islands\r\nwhich he supposed to be the East Indies.\r\n\r\n5. The explorations of men who followed Columbus proved that a new\r\ncontinent had been discovered and that it blocked the way to India.\r\n\r\n6. The attempts to find a southwest passage or a northwest passage\r\nthrough our continent led to the exploration of the Atlantic and\r\nPacific coasts.\r\n\r\n7. The new world was called America, after the explorer Americus.\r\n\r\n8. The voyage of Magellan proved that the earth is round.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPANIARDS IN THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\n%11. The Spaniards explore the Southwest.%--Now it must be noticed\r\nthat up to 1513 no European had explored the interior of either North or\r\nSouth America. They had merely touched the shores. In 1513 the work of\r\nexploration began. Balboa then crossed the Isthmus of Panama. In 1519\r\nCortes (cor\'-tez) landed on the coast of Mexico with a body of men, and\r\nmarched boldly into the heart of the country to the city where lived the\r\ngreat Indian chief or king, Montezuma. Cortes took the city and made\r\nhimself master of Mexico. This was most important; for the conquest of\r\nMexico turned the attention of the Spaniards from our country for many\r\nyears, and finally led to the exploration of the Southwest. But the\r\nfirst explorers of what is now the United States came from Cuba in 1528.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map of 1530, Sloane MS.[1]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Notice that the two continents begin to take shape, and\r\nthat as the result of Magellan\'s voyage is not generally known, North\r\nAmerica is placed very near to Java.]\r\n\r\nIn that year Narvaez (nar-vah-eth), excited by Pineda\'s accounts of the\r\nMississippi Indians and their golden ornaments, set forth with 400 men\r\nto conquer the north coast of the Gulf of Mexico. At Apalachee Bay he\r\nlanded, and made a raid inland. On returning to the shore, he missed his\r\nships, and after traveling westward on foot for a month, built five rude\r\nvessels, and once more put to sea. For six weeks the little fleet hugged\r\nthe shore, till it came to the mouth of the Mississippi, where two of\r\nthe boats were upset and Narvaez was drowned. The rest reached the coast\r\nof Texas in safety. But famine and the tomahawk soon reduced the number\r\nof the survivors to four. These were captured by bands of wandering\r\nIndians, were carried over eastern Texas and western Louisiana, till,\r\nafter many strange adventures and vicissitudes, they met beyond the\r\nSabine River.[1] Protected by the fame they had won for sorcery, and led\r\nby one Cabeza de Vaca, they now wandered westward to the Rio Grande[2]\r\n(ree\'-o grahn\'-da) and on by Chihuahua (chee-wah\'-wah) and Sonora to the\r\nGulf of California, and by this to Culiacan, a town near the west coast\r\nof Mexico, which they reached in 1536.

"The Seven Cities of Cibola."%--The story these men told of the\r\nstrange country through which they had passed, aroused a strong desire\r\nin the Spaniards to explore it, for somewhere in that direction they\r\nbelieved were the Seven Cities. According to an ancient legend, when the\r\nArabs invaded the Spanish peninsula, a bishop of Lisbon with many\r\nfollowers fled to a group of islands in the Sea of Darkness, and on them\r\nfounded seven cities. As one of the Indian tribes had preserved a story\r\nof Seven Caves in which their ancestors had once lived, the credulous\r\nand romantic Spaniards easily confounded the two legends. Firmly\r\nbelieving that the seven cities must exist in the north country\r\ntraversed by Vaca, Mendoza, the Spanish governor of Mexico, selected\r\nFray Marcos, a monk of great ability, and sent him forth with a few\r\nfollowers to search for them. Directed by the Indians through whose\r\nvillages he passed, he came at last in sight of the seven Zu\xc3\xb1i\r\n(zoo\'-nyee) pueblos (pweb\'-loz) of New Mexico, all of which were\r\ninhabited in his time. But he came no nearer than just within sight of\r\nthem. For one of the party, who went on in advance, having been killed\r\nby the Zu\xc3\xb1i, Fray Marcos hurried back to Culiacan. Understanding the\r\nname of the city he had seen to be Cibola (see\'-bo-la), he called the\r\npueblos the "Seven Cities of Cibola," and against them the next year\r\n(1540) Coronado marched with 1100 men. Finding the pueblos were not the\r\nrich cities for which he sought, Coronado pushed on eastward, and for\r\ntwo years wandered to and fro over the plains and mountains of the West,\r\ncrossing the state of Kansas twice.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Do not fail to read a delightful little book called _The\r\nSpanish Pioneers_, by Charles F. Lummis. In it the story of these great\r\njourneys is told on pp. 77-88, 101-143.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The kind of cities found by Marcos and Coronado in the\r\nRio Grande valley.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CORONADO\'S EXPEDITION 1540]\r\n\r\n%13. The Spaniards on the Mississippi.%--In 1537 De Soto was\r\nappointed governor of Cuba, with instructions to conquer and hold all\r\nthe country discovered by Narvaez. On this mission he set out in May,\r\n1539, and landed at Tampa Bay, on the west coast of our state of\r\nFlorida. He wandered over the swamps and marshes, the moss-grown\r\njungles, and the forests of the Gulf states, and spent the winter of\r\n1541 near the Yazoo River. Crossing the Mississippi in the spring of\r\n1542 at the Chickasaw Bluffs, he wandered about eastern Arkansas, till\r\nhe died of fever, and was buried in the Mississippi. His followers then\r\nbuilt rude boats, floated down the river to the Gulf, steered along the\r\ncoast of Texas, and in September, 1543, reached Tampico, in Mexico.\r\n\r\nMore than half a century had now gone by since the first voyage of\r\nColumbus. Yet not a settlement, great or small, had been established by\r\nSpain within our boundary. Between 1546 and 1561 missionaries twice\r\nattempted to found missions and convert the Indians in Florida, and\r\ntwice were driven away. In 1582 others entered the valleys of the Gila\r\nand the Rio Grande, took possession of the pueblos, established\r\nmissions, preached the Gospel to the Indians, and brought them under\r\nthe dominion of Spain. But when Santa F\xc3\xa9 (sahn\'-tah fa\') was founded, in\r\n1582, the only colony of Spain in the United States, besides the\r\nmissions in Arizona and New Mexico, was St. Augustine in Florida.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Spanish mission]\r\n\r\n%14. St. Augustine.%--St. Augustine was founded by the Spaniards in\r\norder to keep out the French, who made two attempts to occupy the south\r\nAtlantic coast. The first was that of John Ribault (ree-bo\'). He led a\r\ncolony of Frenchmen, in 1562, to what is now South Carolina, built a\r\nsmall fort on a spot which he called Port Royal, and left it in charge\r\nof thirty men while he went back to France for more colonists. The men\r\nwere a shiftless set, depended on the Indians till the Indians would\r\nfeed them no longer, and when famine set in, they mutinied, slew their\r\ncommander, built a crazy ship and went to sea, where an English vessel\r\nfound them in a starving condition, and took them to London.\r\n\r\nIn 1564 a second party, under Laudonni\xc3\xa8re (lo-do-ne-ar\'), landed at the\r\nSt. Johns River in Florida, and built a fort called Fort Caroline in\r\nhonor of Charles IX. of France. But the King of Spain, hearing that the\r\nFrench were trespassing, sent an expedition under Menendez\r\n(ma-nen\'-deth), who founded St. Augustine in 1565. There Ribault, who\r\nhad returned and joined Laudonni\xc3\xa8re, attempted to attack the Spaniards.\r\nBut a hurricane scattered his ships, and while it was still raging,\r\nMenendez fell suddenly on Fort Caroline and massacred men, women, and\r\nchildren. A few days later, falling in with Ribault and his men, who had\r\nbeen driven ashore south of St. Augustine, Menendez massacred 150\r\nmore.[1] For this foul deed a Frenchman named Gourgues (goorg) exacted a\r\nfearful penalty. With three small ships and 200 men, he sailed to the\r\nSt. Johns River, took and destroyed the fort which the Spaniards had\r\nbuilt on the site of Fort Caroline, and put to death every human being\r\nwithin it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The story of the French in Florida is finely told in\r\nParkman\'s _Pioneers of France in the New World_; also J. Sparks\'s _Life\r\nof Ribault_; Baird\'s _Huguenot Emigration_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Gateway at St. Augustine[2]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Remaining from the Spanish occupation of Florida.]\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\n1. From 1492 to 1513 the Europeans who came to America explored the\r\ncoasts of North and South America, but did not go inland.\r\n\r\n2. In 1513 exploration of the interior of the two continents began.\r\nBalboa crossed the Isthmus of Panama, 1513, and Cortes conquered\r\nMexico, 1519-21.\r\n\r\n3. In 1528 Narvaez made the first serious attempt to enter the\r\nMississippi valley. He died, and some of his followers, under Cabeza de\r\nVaca, crossed the continent.\r\n\r\n4. When the Spanish governor of Mexico heard their story, he sent Fray\r\nMarcos to find the "Seven Cities of Cibola"; and began the exploration\r\nof the southwestern part of the United States.\r\n\r\n5. In 1539-1541 De Soto and his band explored the southeastern part of\r\nthe United States from Florida to the Mississippi River.\r\n\r\n6.

The English Claim to the Seaboard.%--After the Spaniards had\r\nthus explored the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, and what is now Arizona,\r\nNew Mexico, and Texas, the English attempted to take possession of the\r\nAtlantic coast. The voyages of John and Sebastian Cabot in 1497 and 1498\r\nwere not followed up in the same way that Spain followed up those of\r\nColumbus, and for nearly eighty years the flag of England was not\r\ndisplayed in any of our waters.[1] At last, in 1576, Sir Martin\r\nFrobisher set out to find a northwest passage to Asia. Of course he\r\nfailed; but in that and two later voyages he cruised about the shores of\r\nour continent and gave his name to Frobisher\'s Bay.[2] Next came Sir\r\nFrancis Drake, the greatest seaman of his age. He left England in 1577,\r\ncrossed the Atlantic, sailed down the South American coast, passed\r\nthrough the Strait of Magellan, and turning northward coasted along\r\nSouth America, Mexico, and California, in search of a northeast passage\r\nto the Atlantic. When he had gone as far north as Oregon the weather\r\ngrew so cold that his men began to murmur, and putting his ship about,\r\nhe sailed southward along our Pacific coast in search of a harbor, which\r\nin June, 1579, he found near the present city of San Francisco. There he\r\nlanded, and putting up a post nailed to it a brass plate on which was\r\nthe name of Queen Elizabeth, and took possession of the country.[3]\r\nDespairing of finding a short passage to England, Drake finally crossed\r\nthe Pacific and reached home by way of the Cape of Good Hope. He had\r\nsailed around the globe.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: For Cabot\'s voyages read Fiske\'s _Discovery of America_,\r\nVol. II., pp. 2-15.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: See map of 1515.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The white cliffs reminded Drake strongly of the cliffs of\r\nDover, and as one of the old names of England was Albion (the country of\r\nthe white cliffs), he called the land New Albion.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: For Drake read E.T. Payne\'s _Voyages of Elizabethan\r\nSeamen_.]\r\n\r\n%16. Gilbert and Ralegh attempt to found a Colony.%--While Drake was\r\nmaking his voyage, another gallant seaman, Sir Humphrey Gilbert, was\r\ngiven (by Queen Elizabeth) any new land he might discover in America.\r\nHis first attempt (1579) was a failure, and while on his way home from a\r\nlanding on Newfoundland (1583), his ship, with all on board, went down\r\nin a storm at sea. The next year (1584) his half-brother, Sir Walter\r\nRalegh, one of the most accomplished men of his day and a great favorite\r\nwith Queen Elizabeth, obtained permission from the Queen to make a\r\nsettlement on any part of the coast of America not already occupied by a\r\nChristian power; and he at once sent out an expedition. The explorers\r\nlanded on Roanoke Island, off the coast of what is now North Carolina,\r\nand came home with such a glowing description of the "good land" they\r\nhad found that the Virgin Queen called it "Virginia," in honor of\r\nherself, and Ralegh determined to colonize it.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: For Ralegh read E. Gosse\'s _Raleigh_ (in English Worthies\r\nSeries); Louise Creighton\'s _Sir W. Ralegh_ (Historical\r\nBiographies Series).]\r\n\r\n%17. Roanoke Colony; the Potato and Tobacco.%--In 1585, accordingly,\r\n108 emigrants under Ralph Lane left England and began to build a town on\r\nRoanoke Island. They were ill suited for this kind of pioneer life, and\r\nwere soon in such distress that, had not Sir Francis Drake in one of his\r\nvoyages happened to touch at Roanoke, they would have starved to death.\r\nDrake, seeing their helplessness, carried them home to England. Yet\r\ntheir life on the island was not without results, for they took back\r\nwith them the potato, and some dried tobacco leaves which the Indians\r\nhad taught them to smoke.\r\n\r\nRalegh, of course, was greatly disappointed to see his colonists again\r\nin England. But he was not discouraged, and in 1587 sent forth a second\r\nband. The first had consisted entirely of men. The second band was\r\ncomposed of both men and women with their families, for it seemed likely\r\nthat if the men took their wives and children along they would be more\r\nlikely to remain than if they went alone. John White was the leader, and\r\nwith a charter and instructions to build the city of Ralegh somewhere on\r\nthe shores of Chesapeake Bay he set off with his colonists and landed on\r\nRoanoke Island. Here a little granddaughter was born (August 18, 1587),\r\nand named Virginia. She was the child of Eleanor Dare, and was the first\r\nchild born of English parents in America.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Roanoke Island and vicinity]\r\n\r\nGovernor White soon found it necessary to go back to England for\r\nsupplies, and, in consequence of the Spanish war, three years slipped by\r\nbefore he was able to return to the colony. He was then too late. Every\r\nsoul had perished, and to this day nobody knows how or where. Ralegh\r\ncould do no more, and in 1589 made over all his rights to a joint-stock\r\ncompany of merchants. This company did nothing, and the sixteenth\r\ncentury came to an end with no English colony in America.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Doyle\'s _English Colonies in America_, Virginia, pp. 56-74;\r\nBancroft\'s _History of the United States_, Vol. I., pp. 60-79;\r\nHildreth\'s _History of the United States_, Vol. I., pp. 80-87.]\r\n\r\n%18. Gosnold in New England.%--With the new century came better\r\nfortune. Ralegh\'s noble efforts to plant a colony aroused Englishmen to\r\nthe possibility of founding a great empire in the New World, and\r\nespecially one named Bartholomew Gosnold.\r\n\r\nInstead of following the old route to America by way of the Canary\r\nIslands, the West Indies, and Florida, he sailed due west across the\r\nAtlantic,[2] and brought up on the shore of a cape which he named Cape\r\nCod.[3] Following the shore southward, he passed through Nantucket Sound\r\nand Vineyard Sound, till he came to Cuttyhunk Island, at the entrance of\r\nBuzzards Bay. On this he landed, and built a house for the use of\r\ncolonists he intended to leave there. But when he had filled his ship\r\nwith sassafras roots and cedar logs, nobody would remain, and the whole\r\ncompany went back to England.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: By thus shortening the journey 3000 miles, he practically\r\nbrought America 3000 miles nearer to Europe.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Because the waters thereabout abounded in codfish. For a\r\ncomparison of Gosnold\'s route with those of the other early explorers\r\nsee the map on p. 15.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Bancroft\'s _United States_, Vol. I., pp. 70-83. Hildreth\'s\r\n_United States,_ Vol. I., p. 90.]\r\n\r\n%19. The Two Virginia Companies.%--As a result of this voyage,\r\nGosnold was more eager than ever to plant a colony in Virginia, and this\r\nenthusiasm he communicated so fully to others that, in 1606, King James\r\nI. created two companies to settle in Virginia, which was then the name\r\nfor all the territory from what is now Maine to Florida.\r\n\r\n1. Each company was to own a block of land 100 miles square; that is,\r\n100 miles along the coast,--50 miles each way from its first\r\nsettlement,--and 100 miles into the interior.\r\n\r\n2. The First Company, a band of London merchants, might establish its\r\nfirst settlement anywhere between 34\xc2\xb0 and 41\xc2\xb0 north latitude.\r\n\r\n3. The Second Company, a band of Plymouth merchants, might establish its\r\nfirst settlement anywhere between 38\xc2\xb0 and 45\xc2\xb0.\r\n\r\n4. These settlements were to be on the seacoast.\r\n\r\n5. In order to prevent the blocks from overlapping, it was provided that\r\nthe company which was last to settle should locate at least 100 miles\r\nfrom the other company\'s settlement.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Over the affairs of each company presided a council\r\nappointed by the King, with power to choose its own president, fill\r\nvacancies among its own members, and elect a council of thirteen to\r\nreside on the company\'s lands in America. Each company might coin money,\r\nraise a revenue by taxing foreign vessels trading at its ports, punish\r\ncrime, and make laws which, if bad, could be set aside by the King. All\r\nproperty was to be owned in common, and all the products of the soil\r\ndeposited in a public magazine from which the needs of the settlers were\r\nto be supplied. The surplus was to be sold for the good of the company.\r\nThe charter is given in full in Poore\'s _Charters and Constitutions_,\r\npp. 1888-1893.]\r\n\r\n%20. The Jamestown Colony.%--Thus empowered, the two companies made\r\nall haste to gather funds, collect stores and settlers, and fit out\r\nships. The London Company was the first to get ready, and on the 19th of\r\nDecember, 1606, 143 colonists set sail in three ships for America with\r\ntheir charter, and a list of the council sealed up in a strong box. The\r\nPlymouth Company soon followed, and before the year 1607 was far\r\nadvanced, two settlements were planted in our country: the one at\r\nJamestown, in Virginia, the other near the mouth of the Kennebec, in\r\nMaine. The latter, however, was abandoned the following year (see\r\nChapter IV).\r\n\r\nThe three ships which carried the Virginia colony reached the coast in\r\nthe spring of 1607, and entering Chesapeake Bay sailed up a river which\r\nthe colonists called the James, in honor of the King. When about thirty\r\nmiles from its mouth, a landing was made on a little peninsula, where a\r\nsettlement was begun and named Jamestown.[1] It was the month of May,\r\nand as the weather was warm, the colonists did not build houses, but,\r\ninside of some rude fortifications, put up shelters of sails and\r\nbranches to serve till huts could be built. But their food gave out, the\r\nIndians were hostile, and before September half of the party had died of\r\nfever. Had it not been for the energy and courage of John Smith, every\r\none of them would have perished. He practically assumed command, set the\r\nmen to building huts, persuaded the Indians to give them food, explored\r\nthe bays and rivers of Virginia, and for two dreary years held the\r\ncolony together. When we consider the worthless men he had to deal with,\r\nand the hardships and difficulties that beset him, his work is\r\nwonderful. The history which he wrote, however, is not to be trusted.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Nothing now remains of Jamestown but the ruined tower of\r\nthe church shown in the picture. Much of the land on which the town\r\nstood has been washed away by the river, so that its site is now\r\nan island.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Read the _Life and Writings of Captain John Smith_, by\r\nCharles Dudley Warner; also John Fiske in _Atlantic Monthly_, December,\r\n1895; Eggleston\'s _Beginners of a Nation_, pp. 31-38. Smith\'s _True\r\nRelation_ is printed in _American History Leaflets_, No. 27, and\r\n_Library of American Literature_ Vol. I.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: All that is left of Jamestown]\r\n\r\nBad as matters were, they became worse when a little fleet arrived with\r\nmany new settlers, making the whole number about 500. The newcomers were\r\na worthless set picked up in the streets of London or taken from the\r\njails, and utterly unfit to become the founders of a state in the\r\nwilderness of the New World. Out of such material Smith in time might\r\nhave made something, but he was forced by a wound to return to England,\r\nand the colony went rapidly to ruin. Sickness and famine did their work\r\nso quickly that after six months there were but sixty of the 500 men\r\nalive. Then two small ships, under Sir Thomas Gates and Sir George\r\nSomers, arrived at Jamestown with more settlers; but all decided to\r\nflee, and had actually sailed a few miles down the James, when, June 8,\r\n1610, they met Lord Delaware with three ships full of men and supplies\r\ncoming up the river. Delaware came out as governor under a new charter\r\ngranted in 1609.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Read "The Jamestown Experiments," in Eggleston\'s _Beginners\r\nof a Nation,_ pp. 25-72.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Vicinity of Jamestown]\r\n\r\n%21. The Virginia Charter of 1609% made a great change in the\r\nboundary of the company\'s property. By the 1606 charter the colony was\r\nlimited to 100 miles along the seaboard and 100 miles west from the\r\ncoast. In 1609 the company was given an immense domain reaching 400\r\nmiles along the coast,--200 miles each way from Old Point\r\nComfort,--and extending "up into the land throughout _from sea to sea_,\r\nwest and northwest." This description is very important, for it was\r\nafterwards claimed by Virginia to mean a grant of land of the shape\r\nshown on the map.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Read Hinsdale\'s _Old Northwest_, pp. 74, 75.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n%22. The First Representative Assembly in America.%--Under the new\r\ncharter and new governors Virginia began to thrive. More work and less\r\ngrumbling were done, and a few wise reforms were introduced. One\r\ngovernor, however, Argall, ruled the colony so badly that the people\r\nturned against him and sent such reports to England that immigration\r\nalmost ceased. The company, in consequence, removed Argall, and gave\r\nVirginia a better form of government. In future, the governor\'s power\r\nwas to be limited, and the people were to have a share in the making of\r\nlaws and the management of affairs. As the colonists, now numbering 4000\r\nmen, were living in eleven settlements, or "boroughs," it was ordered\r\nthat each borough should elect two men to sit in a legislature to be\r\ncalled the House of Burgesses. This house, the first representative\r\nassembly ever held by white men in America, met on July 30, 1619, in the\r\nchurch at Jamestown, and there began "government of the people, by the\r\npeople, for the people."\r\n\r\n%23. The Establishment of Slavery in America.%--It is interesting to\r\nnote that at the very time the men of Virginia thus planted free\r\nrepresentative government in America, another institution was planted\r\nbeside it, which, in the course of two hundred and fifty years, almost\r\ndestroyed free government. The Burgesses met in July, and a few weeks\r\nlater, on an August day, a Dutch ship entered the James and before it\r\nsailed away sold twenty negroes into slavery. The slaves increased in\r\nnumbers (there were 2000 in Virginia in 1671), and slavery spread to the\r\nother colonies as they were started, till, in time, it existed in every\r\none of them.\r\n\r\n%24. Virginia loses her Charter, 1624.%--The establishment of popular\r\ngovernment in Virginia was looked on by King James as a direct affront,\r\nand was one of many weighty reasons why he decided to destroy the\r\ncompany. To do this, he accused it of mismanagement, brought a suit\r\nagainst it, and in 1624 his judges declared the charter annulled, and\r\nVirginia became a royal colony.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: On the Virginia colony in general read Doyle\'s volume on\r\n_Virginia_, pp. 104-184; Lodge\'s _English Colonies in America_, pp.\r\n1-12; of course, Bancroft and Hildreth. For particular epochs or events\r\nconsult Channing and Hart\'s _Guide to American History_, pp. 248-253.]\r\n\r\n%25. Maryland begun.%--A year later James died, and Charles I. came\r\nto the throne. As Virginia was now a royal colony, the land belonged to\r\nthe King; and as he was at liberty to do what he pleased with it, he cut\r\noff a piece and gave it to Lord Baltimore. George Calvert, Lord\r\nBaltimore, was a Roman Catholic nobleman who for years past had been\r\ninterested in the colonization of America, and had tried to plant a\r\ncolony in Newfoundland. The severity of the climate caused failure, and\r\nin 1629 he turned his attention to Virginia and visited Jamestown. But\r\nreligious feeling ran as high there as it did anywhere. The colonists\r\nwere intolerantly Protestant, and Baltimore was ordered back to England.\r\n\r\nUndeterred by such treatment, Baltimore was more determined than ever to\r\nplant a colony, and in 1632 obtained his grant of a piece of Virginia.\r\nThe tract lay between the Potomac River and the fortieth degree of north\r\nlatitude, and extended from the Atlantic Ocean to a north and south\r\nline through the source of the Potomac.[1] It was called Maryland in\r\nhonor of the Queen, Henrietta Maria.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It thus included what is now Delaware, and pieces of\r\nPennsylvania and West Virginia.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ORIGINAL BOUNDARY OF MARYLAND]\r\n\r\nThe area of the colony was not large; but the authority of Lord\r\nBaltimore over it was almost boundless. He was to bring to the King each\r\nyear, in token of homage, two Indian arrowheads, and pay as rent one\r\nfifth of all the gold and silver mined. This done, the "lord\r\nproprietary," as he was called, was to all intents and purposes a king.\r\nHe might coin money, make war and peace, grant titles of nobility,\r\nestablish courts, appoint judges, and pardon criminals; but he was not\r\npermitted to tax his people without their consent. He must summon the\r\nfreemen to assist him in making the laws; but when made, they need not\r\nbe sent to the King for approval, but went into force as soon as the\r\nlord proprietary signed them. Of course they must not be contrary to the\r\nlaws of England.\r\n\r\n%26. Treatment of Catholics.%--The deed for Maryland had not been\r\nissued when Lord Baltimore died. It was therefore made out in the name\r\nof his son, Cecilius Calvert, the second Lord Baltimore, who, like the\r\nfirst, was a Roman Catholic, and was influenced in his attempts at\r\ncolonization by a desire to found a refuge for people of his own faith.\r\nAt that time in England no Roman Catholic was permitted to educate his\r\nchildren in a foreign land, or to employ a schoolmaster of his religious\r\nbelief; or keep a weapon; or have Catholic books in his house; or sit in\r\nParliament; or when he died be buried in a parish churchyard. If he did\r\nnot attend the parish church, he was fined \xc2\xa320 a month. But it is\r\nneedless to mention the ways in which he suffered for his religion. It\r\nis enough to know that the persecution was bitter, and that the purpose\r\nof Lord Baltimore was to make Maryland a Roman Catholic colony. Yet he\r\nset a noble example to other founders of colonies by freely granting to\r\nall sects full freedom of conscience. As long as the Catholics remained\r\nin control, toleration worked well. But in the year 1691 Lord Baltimore\r\nwas deprived of his colony because he had supported King James II., and\r\nin 1692 sharp laws were made in Maryland against Catholics by the\r\nProtestants. In 1716 the colony was restored to the proprietor.\r\n\r\nThe first settlement was made in 1634 at St. Marys. Annapolis was\r\nfounded about 1683; and Baltimore in 1729.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Read Scharf\'s _History of Maryland_; Doyle\'s _Virginia_;\r\nLodge\'s _English Colonies_; Eggleston\'s _Beginners of a Nation,_.]\r\n\r\n%27. The Dutch on the Hudson.%--Meantime great things had been\r\nhappening to the northward. In 1609 Henry Hudson, an English sailor in\r\nthe service of Holland, was sent to find a northwest passage to India.\r\nHe reached our coast not far from Portland, Maine, and abandoning all\r\nidea of finding a passage, he sailed alongshore to the southward as far\r\nas Cape Cod. Here he put to sea, and when he again sighted land was off\r\nDelaware Bay. In attempting to sail up it, his ship, the _Half-Moon,_\r\ngrounded, and Hudson turned about. Running along the Jersey coast, he\r\nentered New York Bay, and sailed  up the river which the Dutch called\r\nthe North River, but which we know as the Hudson. Hudson\'s voyage gave\r\nthe Dutch a claim to all the country drained by the Delaware or South\r\nRiver and the Hudson River, and some Dutch traders at once sent out\r\nvessels, and were soon trading actively with the Indians. By 1614 a rude\r\nfort had been erected near the site of Albany, and some trading huts had\r\nbeen put up on Manhattan Island. These ventures proved so profitable\r\nthat numbers of merchants began to engage in the trade, whereupon those\r\nalready in it, in order to shut out others, organized a company, and in\r\n1615 obtained a trading charter for three years from the States General\r\nof Holland, and carried on their operations from Albany to the\r\nDelaware River.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: View of New Amsterdam in 1656]\r\n\r\n%28. Dutch West India Company.%--On the expiration of the charter (in\r\n1618) it was not renewed, but a new corporation, the Dutch West India\r\nCompany (1621), was created with almost absolute political and\r\ncommercial power over all the Dutch domains in North America, which were\r\ncalled New Netherland. In 1623 the company began to send out settlers.\r\nSome went to Albany, or, as they called it, Fort Orange. Others were\r\nsent to the South or Delaware River, where a trading post, Fort Nassau,\r\nwas built on the site of Gloucester in New Jersey. A few went to the\r\nConnecticut River; some settled on Long Island; and others on Manhattan\r\nIsland, where they founded New Amsterdam, now called New York city.\r\n\r\nAll these little settlements were merely fur-trading posts. Nobody was\r\nengaged as yet in farming. To encourage this, the company (in 1629) took\r\nanother step, and offered a great tract of land, on any navigable river\r\nor bay, to anybody who would establish a colony of fifty persons above\r\nthe age of fifteen. If on a river, the domain was to be sixteen miles\r\nalong one bank or eight miles along each bank, and run back into the\r\ncountry as far "as the situation of the occupiers will admit." The\r\nproprietor of the land was to be called a "patroon," [1] and was absolute\r\nruler of whatever colonies he might plant, for he was at once owner,\r\nruler, and judge. It may well be supposed that such a tempting offer did\r\nnot go a-begging, and a number of patroons were soon settled along the\r\nHudson and on the banks of the Delaware (1631), where they founded a\r\ntown near Lewes. The settlements on the Delaware River were short-lived.\r\nThe settlers quarreled with the Indians, who in revenge massacred them\r\nand drove off the garrison at Fort Nassau; whereupon the patroons sold\r\ntheir rights to the Dutch West India Company.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The patroon bound himself to (1) transport the fifty\r\nsettlers to New Netherland at his own expense; (2) provide each of them\r\nwith a farm stocked with horses, cattle, and farming implements, and\r\ncharge a low rent; (3) employ a schoolmaster and a minister of the\r\nGospel. In return for this the emigrant bound himself (1) to stay and\r\ncultivate the land of the patroon for ten years; (2) to bring his grain\r\nto the patroon\'s mill and pay for grinding; (3) to use no cloth not made\r\nin Holland; (4) to sell no grain or produce till the patroon had been\r\ngiven a chance to buy it.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Lodge\'s _English Colonies_, pp. 295-311; Winsor\'s\r\n_Narrative and Critical History_, Vol. III., pp. 385-411; Bancroft\'s\r\n_History of the United States_, Vol. I., pp. 501-508.]\r\n\r\n%29. The Struggle for the Delaware; the Swedes on the Delaware.%--And\r\nnow began a bitter contest for the ownership of the country bordering\r\nthe Delaware. A few leading officials of the Dutch Company, disgusted at\r\nthe way its affairs were managed, formed a new company under the lead of\r\nWilliam Usselinx. As they could not get a charter from Holland, for she\r\nwould not create a rival to the Dutch Company, they sought and obtained\r\none from Sweden as the South Company, and (1638) sent out a colony to\r\nsettle on the Delaware River.[1] The spot chosen was on the site of\r\nWilmington. The country was named New Sweden, though it belonged to\r\nMaryland. The Dutch West India Company protested and rebuilt Fort\r\nNassau. The Swedes, in retaliation, went farther up the river and\r\nfortified an island near the mouth of the Schuylkill. Had they stopped\r\nhere, all would have gone well. But, made bold by the inaction of the\r\nDutch, they began to annoy the New Netherlanders, till (1655) Peter\r\nStuyvesant, the governor of New Netherland, unable to stand it any\r\nlonger, came over from New Amsterdam with a few hundred men, overawed\r\nthe Swedes, and annexed their territory west of the Delaware. New Sweden\r\nthen became part of New Netherland.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Sweden had no right to make such a settlement. She had no\r\nclaim to any territory in North America.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Lodge\'s _English Colonies_, pp. 205-210; Bancroft\'s\r\n_History of the United States_, Vol. I., pp. 509, 510; Hildreth\'s\r\n_History of the United States_, Vol. I., pp. 413-442.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\n1. After the discovery of the North American coast by the Cabots,\r\nEngland made no attempt to settle it for nearly eighty years; and even\r\nthen the colonies planted by Gilbert and Ralegh were failures.\r\n\r\n2. Successful settlement by the English began under the London Company\r\nin 1607.\r\n\r\n3. In 1609 the London Company obtained a grant of land from sea to sea,\r\nand extending 400 miles along the Atlantic; but in 1624 its charter was\r\nannulled, and in 1632 the King carved the proprietary colony of Maryland\r\nout of Virginia.\r\n\r\n4. Meantime Henry Hudson, in the employ of the Dutch, discovered the\r\nDelaware and Hudson rivers (1609), and the Dutch, ignoring the claims of\r\nEngland, planted colonies on these rivers and called the country New\r\nNetherland.\r\n\r\n5. Then a Swedish company began to colonize the Delaware Bay and River\r\ncoast of Virginia, which they called New Sweden.\r\n\r\n6. Conflicts between the Dutch and the Swedes followed, and in 1655 New\r\nSweden was made a part of New Netherland.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PLANTING OF NEW ENGLAND\r\n\r\n%30. The Beginnings of New England.%--When the Dutch put up their\r\ntrading posts where New York and Albany now stand, all the country east\r\nof New York, all of what is now New England, was a wilderness. As early\r\nas 1607 an attempt was made to settle it and a colony was planted on the\r\ncoast of Maine by two members of the Plymouth Company, Sir John Popham,\r\nLord Chief Justice of England, and Sir Ferdinando Gorges, governor of\r\nPlymouth. But the colonists were half starved and frozen, and in the\r\nspring of 1608 gladly went home to England.\r\n\r\nSix years later John Smith, the hero of Virginia, explored and mapped\r\nthe coast from the Penobscot to Cape Cod. He called the country New\r\nEngland; one of the rivers, the Charles; and two of the promontories,\r\nCape Elizabeth and Cape Ann. Three times he attempted to lead out a\r\ncolony; but that work was reserved for other men.\r\n\r\n%31. The Separatists.%--The reign of Queen Elizabeth had witnessed in\r\nEngland the rise of a religious sect which insisted that certain changes\r\nshould be made in the government and ceremonials of the Established or\r\nState Church of England. This they called purifying the Church, and in\r\nconsequence they were themselves called Puritans.[1] At first they did\r\nnot intend to form a new sect; but in 1580 one of their ministers, named\r\nRobert Brown, urged them to separate from the Church of England, and\r\nsoon gathered about him a great number of followers, who were called\r\nSeparatists or Brownists. They boldly asserted their right to worship as\r\nthey pleased, and put their doctrines into practice. So hot a\r\npersecution followed, that in 1608 a party, led by William Brewster and\r\nJohn Robinson, fled from Scrooby, a little village in northern England,\r\nto Amsterdam, in Holland; but soon went on to Leyden, where they dwelt\r\neleven years.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Read Fiske\'s _Beginnings of New England_, pp. 50-71. The\r\nteacher may read "Rise and Development of Puritanism" in Eggleston\'s\r\n_Beginners of a Nation_, pp. 98-140.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Read Eggleston\'s _Beginners of a Nation_, pp. 141-157;\r\nFiske\'s _Beginnings of New England_, pp. 71-80; Doyle\'s _Puritan\r\nColonies_, Vol. I., pp. 47-81; Palfrey\'s _New England_, Vol. I.,\r\npp. 176-232.]\r\n\r\n%32. Why the Separatists went to New England%.--They had come to\r\nHolland as an organized community, practicing English manners and\r\ncustoms. For a temporary residence this would do. But if they and their\r\nchildren\'s children after them were to remain and prosper, they must\r\nbreak up their organization, forget their native land, their native\r\nspeech, their national traditions, and to all intents and purposes\r\nbecome Dutch. This they could not bring themselves to do, and by 1617\r\nthey had fully determined to remove to some land where they might still\r\ncontinue to be Englishmen, and where they might lay the foundations of a\r\nChristian state. But one such land could then be found, and that was\r\nAmerica. To America, therefore, they turned their attention, and after\r\ninnumerable delays formed a company and obtained leave from the London\r\nCompany to settle on the coast of what is now New Jersey.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Eggleston\'s _Beginners of a Nation_, pp. 159-176.]\r\n\r\nThis done, Brewster and Bradford and Miles Standish, with a little band,\r\nsent out as an advance guard, set sail from the Dutch port of Delft\r\nHaven in July, 1620, in the ship _Speedwell_. The first run was to\r\nSouthampton, England, where some friends from London joined them in the\r\n_Mayflower_, and whence, August 5, they sailed for America. But the\r\n_Speedwell_ proved so unseaworthy that the two ships put back to\r\nPlymouth, where twenty people gave up the voyage. September 6, 1620,\r\nsuch as remained steadfast, just 102 in number, re\xc3\xabmbarked on the\r\n_Mayflower_ and began the most memorable of voyages. The weather was so\r\nfoul, and the wind and sea so boisterous, that nine weeks passed before\r\nthey beheld the sandy shores of Cape Cod. Having no right to settle\r\nthere, as the cape lay far to the northward of the lands owned by the\r\nLondon Company, they turned their ship southward and attempted to go on.\r\nBut head winds drove them back and forced them to seek shelter in\r\nProvincetown harbor, at the end of Cape Cod.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Mayflower[1]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: From the model in the National Museum, Washington.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MASSACHUSETTS COAST (map)]\r\n\r\n%33. The Mayflower Compact%.--Since it was then the 11th of November,\r\nthe Pilgrims, as they are now called, decided to get permission from\r\nthe Plymouth Company to remain permanently. But certain members of the\r\nparty, when they heard this, became unruly, and declared that as they\r\nwere not to land in Virginia, they were no longer bound by the contracts\r\nthey had made in England regarding their emigration to Virginia. To put\r\nan end to this, a meeting was held, November 21, 1620, in the cabin of\r\nthe _Mayflower_, and a compact was drawn up and signed.[1] It declared\r\n\r\n1. That they were loyal subjects of the King.\r\n\r\n2. That they had undertaken to found a colony in the northern parts of\r\nVirginia, and now bound themselves to form a "civil body politic."\r\n\r\n3. That they would frame such just and equal laws, from time to time, as\r\nmight be for the general good.\r\n\r\n4. And to these laws they promised "all due submission and obedience."\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The compact is in Poore\'s _Charters and Constitutions_, p.\r\n931, and in Preston\'s _Documents Illustrative of American History_, pp.\r\n29-31. Read, by all means, Webster\'s _Plymouth Oration_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Plymouth Rock]\r\n\r\n%34. The Founding of Plymouth%.--The selection of a site for their\r\nhome was now necessary, and five weeks were passed in exploring the\r\ncoast before Captain Standish with a boatload of men entered the harbor\r\nwhich John Smith had noted on his map and named Plymouth. On the sandy\r\nshore of that harbor, close to the water\'s edge, was a little granite\r\nbowlder, and on this, according to tradition, the Pilgrims stepped as\r\nthey came ashore, December 21, 1620. To this harbor the _Mayflower_ was\r\nbrought, and the work of founding Plymouth was begun. The winter was a\r\ndreadful one, and before spring fifty-one of the colonists had died.[1]\r\nBut the Pilgrims stood fast, and in 1621 obtained a grant of land[2]\r\nfrom the Council for New England, which had just succeeded the Plymouth\r\nCompany, under a charter giving it control between latitudes 40\xc2\xb0 and\r\n48\xc2\xb0, from sea to sea.[3] It was from the same Council that for fifteen\r\nyears to come all other settlers in New England obtained their rights\r\nto the soil.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In the trying times which followed, William Bradford was\r\nchosen governor and many times re\xc3\xablected. He wrote the so-called "Log of\r\nthe Mayflower,"--really a manuscript _History of the Plymouth\r\nPlantation_ from 1602 to 1647,--a fragment of which is reproduced on the\r\nopposite page.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: This grant had no boundary. Each settler might have 100\r\nacres. Fifteen hundred acres were set aside for public buildings.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Fiske\'s _Beginnings of New England_, pp. 80-87; Palfrey\'s\r\n_New England_, Vol. I, pp. 176-232; Thatcher\'s _History of the Town of\r\nPlymouth_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fragment of _History of the Plymouth Plantation_.]\r\n\r\n%35. A Puritan Colony proposed.%--Among those who obtained such\r\nrights was a company of Dorchester merchants who planted a town on Cape\r\nAnn. The enterprise failed, and the colonists went off and settled at a\r\nplace they called Naumkeag. But there was one man in Dorchester who was\r\nnot discouraged by failure. He was John White, a Puritan rector. What\r\nhad been done by the Separatists in a small way might be done, it seemed\r\nto White, on a great scale by an association of wealthy and influential\r\nPuritans. The matter was discussed by them in London, and in 1628 an\r\nassociation was formed, and a tract of land was bought from the Council\r\nfor New England.\r\n\r\n%36. The "Sea to Sea" Grant%.--Concerning the interior of our\r\ncontinent absolutely nothing was known. Nobody supposed it was more than\r\nhalf as wide as it really is. The grant to the association, therefore,\r\nstretched from three miles north of the Merrimac River to three miles\r\nsouth of the Charles River, along these rivers to their sources, and\r\nthen westward across the continent from sea to sea.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: You will notice that when this grant was made in 1628 the\r\nDutch had discovered the Hudson, and had begun to settle Albany. To this\r\nregion (the Hudson and Mohawk valleys) the English had no just claim.]\r\n\r\nAs soon as the grant was obtained, John Endicott came out with a company\r\nof sixty persons, and took up his abode at Naumkeag, which, being an\r\nIndian and therefore a pagan name, he changed to Salem, the Hebrew word\r\nfor "peace."\r\n\r\n%37. The Massachusetts Charter, 1629%.--The next step was to obtain\r\nthe right of self-government, which was secured by a royal charter\r\ncreating a corporation known as the Governor and Company of\r\nMassachusetts Bay in New England. Over the affairs of the company were\r\nto preside a governor, deputy governor, and a council of eighteen to be\r\nelected annually by the members of the company.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The charter is printed in Poore\'s _Charters and\r\nConstitutions_, pp. 932-942, and in Preston\'s _Documents_, pp. 36-61.]\r\n\r\nSix ships were now fitted out, and in them 406 men, women, and children,\r\nwith 140 head of cattle, set sail for Massachusetts. They reached Salem\r\nin safety and made it the largest colony in New England.\r\n\r\n%38. Why the Puritans came to New England.%--It was in 1625 that\r\nCharles I. ascended the throne of England. Under him the quarrel with\r\nthe Puritans grew worse each year. He violated his promises, he\r\ncollected illegal taxes, he quartered troops on the people, he threw\r\nthose into prison who would not contribute to his forced loans, or\r\npressed them into the army or the navy. His Archbishop Laud persecuted\r\nthe Puritans with shameful cruelty.\r\n\r\nLittle wonder then that in 1629 twelve leading Puritans met in\r\nconsultation and agreed to head a great migration to the New World,\r\nprovided the charter and the government of the Massachusetts Bay Company\r\nwere both removed to New England. This was agreed to, and in April,\r\n1630, John Winthrop sailed with nearly one thousand Puritans for Salem.\r\nFrom Salem he moved to Charlestown, and later in the year (1630) to a\r\nlittle three-hilled peninsula, which the English called Tri-mountain or\r\nTremont. There a town was founded and called Boston.\r\n\r\nThe departure of Winthrop was the signal, and before the year 1630\r\nended, seventeen ships, bringing fifteen hundred Puritans, reached\r\nMassachusetts. The newcomers settled Charlestown, Boston, Roxbury,\r\nDorchester, Watertown, and Newtown (now Cambridge). New England was\r\nplanted.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Read Fiske\'s _Beginnings of New England_, pp. 75-105.\r\nEggleston\'s _Beginners of a Nation_, pp. 188-219.]\r\n\r\n%39. New Hampshire and Maine.%--When it became apparent that the\r\nPlymouth colony was permanently settled, Sir Ferdinando Gorges, whose\r\ninterest in New England had never lagged, together with John Mason\r\nobtained (1622) from the Council for New England a grant of Laconia, as\r\nthey called the territory between the Merrimac and the Kennebec rivers,\r\nand from the Atlantic "to the great river of Canada." Seven years later\r\n(1629) they divided their property. Mason, taking the territory between\r\nthe Merrimac and Piscataqua rivers, called it New Hampshire because he\r\nwas Lord Lieutenant of Hampshire in England. Gorges took the region\r\nbetween the Piscataqua and the Kennebec, and called it Maine. After the\r\ndeath of Mason (1635) his colony was neglected and from 1641 to 1679 was\r\nannexed to Massachusetts. The King separated them in 1679, joined them\r\nagain in 1688, and finally parted them in 1691, making New Hampshire a\r\nroyal colony.\r\n\r\nGorges took better care of his part and (in 1639) was given a charter\r\nwith the title of Lord Proprietor of the Province or County of Maine,\r\nwhich extended, as before, from the Piscataqua to the Kennebec, and\r\nbackward 120 miles from the ocean. But after his death the province fell\r\ninto neglect, and the towns were gradually absorbed by Massachusetts,\r\nwhich, in 1677, bought the claims of the heir of Gorges for \xc2\xa31250 and\r\ngoverned Maine as lord proprietor under the Gorges charter.\r\n\r\n%40. Church and State in Massachusetts.%--Down to the moment of their\r\narrival in America the Puritans had not been Separatists. They were\r\nstill members of the Church of England who desired to see her form of\r\nworship purified. But the party under Endicott had no sooner reached\r\nSalem than they seceded, and the first Congregational Church in New\r\nEngland was founded.\r\n\r\nSome in Salem were not prepared for so radical a step, and attempted to\r\nestablish a church on the episcopal model; but Endicott promptly sent\r\ntwo of the leaders back to England. Thus were established two facts: 1.\r\nThe separation or secession of the Colonial Church from that of England.\r\n2. That the episcopal form of worship would not be tolerated in\r\nthe colony.\r\n\r\nIn 1631 another step was taken which united church and state, for it was\r\nthen ordered that "no man shall be admitted to the freedom of this body\r\npolitic, but such as are members of some of the churches within the\r\nlimits of the same."\r\n\r\nThis was intolerance of the grossest kind, and soon became the cause of\r\ntroubles which led to the founding of Rhode Island and Connecticut.\r\n\r\n%41. The Planting of Rhode Island.%--There came to Salem (from\r\nPlymouth), in 1633, a young minister named Roger Williams. He dissented\r\nheartily from the intolerance of the people of Massachusetts, and,\r\nthough a minister of the Salem church, insisted\r\n\r\n1. On the separation of church and state.\r\n\r\n2. On the toleration of all religious beliefs.\r\n\r\n3. On the repeal of all laws requiring attendance on religious worship.\r\n\r\nTo us, in this century, the justice of each of these principles is\r\nself-evident. But in the seventeenth century there was no country in the\r\nworld where it was safe to declare them. For doing so in some parts of\r\nEurope, a man would most certainly have been burned at the stake. For\r\ndoing so in England, he would have been put in the pillory, or had his\r\nears cut off, or been sent to jail. That Williams\'s teachings should\r\nseem rank heresy in New England was quite natural. But, to make matters\r\nworse, he wrote a pamphlet in which he boldly stated\r\n\r\n1. That the soil belonged to the Indians.\r\n\r\n2. That the settlers could obtain a valid title only by purchase from\r\nthe Indians.\r\n\r\n3. That accepting a deed for the land from a mere intruder like the King\r\nof England was a sin requiring public repentance.\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of the people of New England such doctrine could not fail\r\nto bring down on Massachusetts the wrath of the King. When, therefore, a\r\nlittle later, Endicott cut the red cross of St. George out of the colors\r\nof the Salem militia, the people considered his act a defiance of royal\r\nauthority, attributed it to the teachings of Williams, and proceeded to\r\npunish both. Endicott was rebuked by the General Court (or legislature)\r\nand forbidden to hold office for a year. Williams was ordered to go\r\nback to England. But he fled to the woods, and made his way through the\r\nsnow to the wigwam of the Indian chief, Massasoit, on Narragansett Bay,\r\nand there in the summer of 1636 he founded Providence. About the same\r\ntime another teacher of what was then thought heresy, Anne Hutchinson,\r\nwas driven from Massachusetts, and with some of her followers went\r\nsouthward and founded Portsmouth and Newport, on the island of Rhode\r\nIsland. For a while each of these settlements was independent, but in\r\n1643 Williams went to London and secured a patent from Parliament which\r\nunited them under the name of "The Incorporation of Providence\r\nPlantations on the Narragansett Bay in New England."\r\n\r\n%42. Connecticut begun.%--In the same year that Roger Williams began\r\nhis settlement at Providence, several hundred people from the towns near\r\nBoston went off and settled in the Connecticut valley. For a long time\r\npast there had been growing up in Massachusetts a strong feeling that\r\nthe law that none but church members should vote or hold office was\r\noppressive. This feeling became so strong that in 1635 some hardy\r\npioneers from Dorchester pushed through the wilderness and settled at\r\nWindsor. A party from Watertown went further and settled Wethersfield.\r\nThese were small movements. But in 1636 the Newtown congregation, led by\r\nits pastor, Thomas Hooker, walked to the Connecticut valley and founded\r\nHartford. The congregations of the Dorchester and Watertown churches\r\nsoon followed, while a party from Roxbury settled at Springfield. During\r\nthree years these four towns were part of Massachusetts. But in 1639,\r\nWindsor, Hartford, and Wethersfield adopted a constitution and formed a\r\nlittle republic which in time was called Connecticut. Their "Fundamental\r\nOrders of Connecticut" was the first written constitution made in\r\nAmerica. Their republic was the first in the history of the world to be\r\nfounded by a written constitution, and marks the beginning of democratic\r\ngovernment in our country.\r\n\r\n%43. The New Haven Colony.%--Just at the time these things were\r\nhappening in the Connecticut valley, the beginnings of another little\r\nrepublic were made on the shores of Long Island Sound. One day in the\r\nsummer of 1637 there came to Boston a company of rich London merchants\r\nunder the lead of an eloquent preacher named John Davenport. The people\r\nof Boston would gladly have kept the newcomers at that town. But the\r\nstrangers desired to found a state of their own, and so, after spending\r\nsome months in seeking for a spot with a good harbor, they left Boston\r\nin 1638 and founded New Haven. In 1639 Milford and Guilford were laid\r\nout, and Stamford was started in 1640. Three years later these four\r\ntowns joined in a sort of federal union and took the name of the New\r\nHaven colony.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Fiske\'s _Beginnings of New England_, pp. 134-137.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEW ENGLAND AND NEW NETHERLAND]\r\n\r\n%44. "The United Colonies of New England."%--There were now five\r\ncolonies in New England; namely, Plymouth, or the "Old Colony,"\r\nMassachusetts Bay, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New Haven.\r\nGeographically, they were near each other. But each was weak in numbers,\r\nand if left without the aid of its neighbors, might easily have fallen\r\na prey to some enemy. Of this the settlers were well aware, and in 1643\r\nfour of the colonies, Plymouth, Massachusetts Bay, Connecticut, and New\r\nHaven[1] united for defense against the Indians and the Dutch, who\r\nclaimed the Connecticut valley and so threatened the English colonies\r\non the west.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Rhode Island was not allowed to come in, for the feeling\r\nagainst the followers of Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson was still\r\nvery strong.]\r\n\r\nThe name of this league was "The United Colonies of New England," and it\r\nwas the first attempt in America at federal government. All its affairs\r\nwere managed by a board of eight commissioners,--two from each\r\ncolony,--who must be church members. They had no power to lay taxes or\r\nto meddle with the internal concerns of the colonies, but they had\r\nentire control over all dealings with Indians or with foreign powers.\r\n\r\n%45. The Year 1643.%--The year 1643 is thus an important one in\r\ncolonial history. It was in that year that the New Haven colony was\r\nfounded; that the league of The United Colonies of New England was\r\nformed; and that Roger Williams obtained the first charter of\r\nRhode Island.\r\n\r\n%46. New Charters.%--During the next twenty years no changes took\r\nplace in the boundaries of the colonies. This was the period of the\r\nCivil War in England, of the Commonwealth, of the rule of Cromwell and\r\nthe Puritans; and affairs in New England were left to take care of\r\nthemselves. But in 1660 Charles II. was restored to the throne of\r\nEngland, and a new era opens in colonial history. In 1661 the little\r\ncolony of Connecticut promptly acknowledged the restoration of Charles\r\nII. and applied for a charter. The application was more than granted;\r\nfor to Connecticut (1662) was given not only a charter and an immense\r\ntract of land, but also the colony of New Haven.[1] The land grant was\r\ncomprised in a strip that stretched across the continent from Rhode\r\nIsland to the Pacific and was as wide as the present state.[2] In 1663\r\nRhode Island was given a new charter.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In 1660, after the restoration of Charles II., Edward\r\nWhalley and William Goffe (the regicides, "king-killers," as they were\r\ncalled), two of the judges who had condemned Charles I. to be beheaded,\r\nfled to New Haven and were protected by the people. This act had much to\r\ndo with the annexation of New Haven to Connecticut.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Read Fiske\'s _Beginnings of New England_, pp. 192-196. Many\r\nof the New Haven colonists were disgusted by the union of their colony\r\nwith Connecticut, and in June, 1667, migrated to New Jersey, where they\r\nfounded "New-Ark" or Newark.]\r\n\r\nIn 1684 the King\'s judges declared the Massachusetts charter void, and\r\nJames II. was about to make New England one royal colony, when the\r\nEnglish people drove him from the throne. William and Mary in 1691\r\ngranted a new charter and united the Plymouth colony, Massachusetts,\r\nMaine, and Nova Scotia, in one colony called Massachusetts Bay. This\r\ncharter was in force when the Revolution opened.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\n1. The first colony established by the Plymouth Company (1607, on the\r\ncoast of Maine) was a failure.\r\n\r\n2. Captain John Smith explored the New England coast and mapped it\r\n(1613), but did not succeed in planting any colonies.\r\n\r\n3. The permanent settlement of New England began with the arrival of a\r\nbody of Separatists in the _Mayflower_ (1620), who founded the colony\r\nof Plymouth.\r\n\r\n4. The Separatist migration from England was followed in a few years by\r\na great exodus of Puritans, who planted towns along the coast to the\r\nnorth of Plymouth, and obtained a charter of government and a great\r\nstrip of land, and founded the colony of Massachusetts Bay.\r\n\r\n5. Religious disputes drove Roger Williams and Anne Hutchinson out of\r\nMassachusetts, and led to the founding of Rhode Island (1636).\r\n\r\n6. Other church wrangles led to an emigration from Massachusetts to the\r\nConnecticut valley, where a little confederacy of towns was created and\r\ncalled Connecticut.\r\n\r\n7. Some settlers from England went to Long Island Sound and there\r\nfounded four towns which, in their turn, joined in a federal union\r\ncalled the New Haven Colony.\r\n\r\n8. In time, New Haven was joined to Connecticut, and Plymouth and Maine\r\nto Massachusetts; New Hampshire was made a royal colony; and the four\r\nNew England colonies--Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, and\r\nConnecticut--were definitely established.\r\n\r\n9. The territory of Massachusetts and Connecticut stretched across the\r\ncontinent to the "South Sea," or Pacific Ocean.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MIDDLE AND SOUTHERN COLONIES\r\n\r\n%47. North and South Carolina.%--You remember that away back in the\r\nsixteenth century the French under Jean Ribault and the English under\r\nRalegh undertook to plant colonies on what is now the Carolina coast.\r\nThey failed, and the country remained a wilderness till 1653, when a\r\nband of emigrants from Virginia made the first permanent settlement on\r\nthe banks of the Chowan and the Roanoke. In 1663 some Englishmen from\r\nBarbados began to settle on the Cape Fear River, just at the time when\r\nCharles II. of England gave the region to eight English noblemen, who,\r\nout of compliment to the King, allowed the name of Carolina given it by\r\nRibault to remain. In 1665 the bounds were enlarged, and Carolina then\r\nextended from latitude 29\xc2\xb0 00\' to 36\xc2\xb0 30\', the present south boundary of\r\nVirginia, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAROLINA AS GRANTED BY King Charles II]\r\n\r\nThere was at first no intention of dividing the territory, although,\r\nafter Charleston was founded (1670), North Carolina and South Carolina\r\nsometimes had separate governors. But in 1729 the proprietors sold\r\nCarolina to the King, and it was then divided into two distinct and\r\nseparate royal provinces.\r\n\r\n%48. New York.%--An event of far greater importance than the\r\nchartering of Carolina was the seizure of New Netherland. After the\r\nconquest of New Sweden, in 1655, the possessions and claims of the Dutch\r\nin our country extended from the Connecticut River to the Delaware\r\nRiver, and from the Mohawk to Delaware Bay. Geographically, they cut the\r\nEnglish colonies in two, and hampered communication between New England\r\nand the South. To own this region was therefore of the utmost importance\r\nto the English; and to get it, King Charles II., in 1664, revived the\r\nold claim that the English had discovered the country before the Dutch,\r\nand he sent a little fleet and army, which appeared off New Amsterdam\r\nand demanded its surrender. The demand was complied with; and in 1664\r\nDutch rule in our country ended, and England owned the seaboard from the\r\nKennebec to the Savannah.\r\n\r\nThe King had already granted New Netherland to his brother the Duke of\r\nYork, in honor of whom the town of New Amsterdam was now renamed\r\nNew York.\r\n\r\n%49. New Jersey.%--The Duke of York no sooner received his province\r\nthan he gave so much of it as lay between the Delaware and the ocean to\r\nhis friends Lord Berkeley and Sir George Carteret, and called it New\r\nJersey, in honor of Sir George Carteret, who had been governor of the\r\nisland of Jersey in the English Channel. The two proprietors divided it\r\nbetween them by the line shown on the map (p. 56). In 1674 Berkeley sold\r\nWest Jersey to a company of Quakers, who settled near Burlington. A\r\nlittle later, 1676, William Penn and some other Quakers bought East\r\nJersey. There were then two colonies till 1702, when the proprietors\r\nsurrendered their rights, and New Jersey became one royal province.\r\n\r\n%50. The Beginnings of Pennsylvania.%--The part which Penn took in\r\nthe settlement of New Jersey suggested to him the idea of beginning a\r\ncolony which should be a refuge for the persecuted of all lands and of\r\nall religions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNow it so happened that Penn was the son of a distinguished admiral to\r\nwhom King Charles II. owed \xc2\xa316,000, and seeing no chance of its ever\r\nbeing paid, he proposed to the King, in 1680, that the debt be paid with\r\na tract of land in America. The King gladly agreed, and in 1681 Penn\r\nreceived a grant west of the Delaware. Against Penn\'s wish, the King\r\ncalled it Pennsylvania, or Penn\'s Woodland. It was given almost\r\nprecisely the bounds of the present state.[1] In 1683 Penn made a famous\r\ntreaty with the Indians, and laid out the city of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: There was a long dispute, however, with Lord Baltimore,\r\nover the south boundary line, which was not settled till 1763-67, when\r\ntwo surveyors, Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon, came over from England\r\nand located it as at present. In later years, when all the Atlantic\r\nseaboard states north of Maryland and Delaware had abolished slavery,\r\nthis "Mason and Dixon\'s Line" became famous as the dividing line between\r\nthe slave and the free Atlantic states.]\r\n\r\n%51. The Three Lower Counties: Delaware.%--If you look at the map of\r\nthe British Colonies in 1764, you will see that Pennsylvania was the\r\nonly English colony which did not have a seacoast. This was a cause of\r\nsome anxiety to Penn, who was afraid that the settlers in Delaware and\r\nNew Jersey might try to prevent his colonists from going in and out of\r\nDelaware Bay. To avoid this, he bought what is now Delaware from the\r\nDuke of York.\r\n\r\nThe three lower counties on the Delaware, as the tract was called, had\r\nno boundary. Lawfully it belonged to Lord Baltimore. But neither the\r\nDutch patroons who settled on the Delaware in 1631, nor the Swedes who\r\ncame later, nor the Dutch who annexed New Sweden to New Netherland, nor\r\nthe English who conquered the Dutch, paid any regard to Baltimore\'s\r\nrights. At last, after the purchase of Delaware, the heirs of Baltimore\r\nand of Penn (1732) agreed on what is the present boundary line. After\r\n1703 the people of the three lower counties were allowed to have an\r\nassembly or legislature of their own; but they had the same governor as\r\nPennsylvania and were a part of that colony till the Revolution.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: For Pennsylvania read Janney\'s _Life of William Penn_ or\r\nDixon\'s _History of William Penn_; Proud\'s or Gordon\'s _Pennsylvania_;\r\nLodge\'s _Colonies_, pp. 213-226.]\r\n\r\n%52. Georgia.%--The return of the Carolinas to the King in 1729 was\r\nvery soon followed by the establishment of the last colony ever planted\r\nby England in the United States. The founder was James Oglethorpe, an\r\nEnglish soldier and member of Parliament. Filled with pity for the poor\r\ndebtors with whom the English jails were then crowded, he formed a plan\r\nto pay the debts of the most deserving, send them to America, and give\r\nthem what hundreds of thousands of men have since found in our\r\ncountry,--a chance to begin life anew.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nGreat numbers of people became interested in his plan, and finally\r\ntwenty-two persons under Oglethorpe\'s lead formed an association and\r\nsecured a charter from King George II. for a colony, which they called\r\nGeorgia. The territory granted lay between the Savannah and the\r\nAltamaha rivers, and extended from their mouths to their sources and\r\nthen across the country to the Pacific Ocean. Oglethorpe had selected\r\nthis tract in order that his colonists might serve the patriotic purpose\r\nof protecting Charleston from the Spanish attacks to which it was\r\nthen exposed.\r\n\r\nMoney for the colony was easily raised,[1] and in November, 1732,\r\nOglethorpe, with 130 persons, set out for Charleston, and after a short\r\nstay there passed southward and founded the city of Savannah (1733). It\r\nmust not be supposed that all the colonists were poor debtors. In time,\r\nItalians from Piedmont, Moravians and Lutherans from Germany, and\r\nScotchmen from the Highlands, all made settlements in Georgia.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The House of Commons gave \xc2\xa310,000.]\r\n\r\n%53. The Thirteen English Colonies.%--Thus it came about that between\r\n1606 and 1733 thirteen English colonies were planted on the Atlantic\r\nseaboard of what is now the United States. Naming them from north to\r\nsouth, they were: 1. New Hampshire, with no definite western boundary;\r\n2. Massachusetts, which owned Maine and a strip of territory across the\r\ncontinent; 3. Rhode Island, with her present bounds; 4. Connecticut,\r\nwith a great tract of land extending to the Pacific; 5. New York, with\r\nundefined bounds; 6. New Jersey; 7. Pennsylvania and 8. Delaware, the\r\nproperty of the Penn family; 9. Maryland, the property of the heirs of\r\nLord Baltimore; 10. Virginia, with claims to a great part of North\r\nAmerica; 11. North Carolina, 12. South Carolina, and 13. Georgia, all\r\nwith claims to the Pacific.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\n1. The English seized New Netherland (1664), giving it to the Duke of\r\nYork; and the Duke, after establishing the province of New York, gave\r\nNew Jersey to two of his friends, and sold the three counties on the\r\nDelaware to William Penn.\r\n\r\n2. Meanwhile the King granted Penn what is now Pennsylvania (1681).\r\n\r\n3. The Carolinas were first chartered as one proprietary colony, but\r\nwere sold back to the King and finally separated in 1729.\r\n\r\n4. Georgia, the last of the thirteen English colonies, was granted to\r\nOglethorpe and others as a refuge for poor debtors (1732).\r\n\r\nBEGINNINGS OF THE THIRTEEN COLONIES\r\n\r\n_English_.\r\n\r\n   Failures:\r\n\r\n     1579.

The Early French Possessions% on our continent may be arranged\r\nin three great areas: 1. Acadia, 2. New France, 3. Louisiana, or the\r\nbasin of the Mississippi River.\r\n\r\nACADIA comprised what is now New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and a part of\r\nMaine. It was settled in the early years of the seventeenth century at\r\nPort Royal (now Annapolis, Nova Scotia), at Mount Desert Island, and on\r\nthe St. Croix River.\r\n\r\nNEW FRANCE was the drainage basin of the St. Lawrence and the Great\r\nLakes. As far back as 1535 Jacques Cartier explored the St. Lawrence\r\nRiver to the site of Montreal. But it was not till 1608 that a party\r\nunder Champlain made the first permanent settlement on the river,\r\nat Quebec.\r\n\r\nThe French settlers at once entered into an alliance with the Huron and\r\nAlgonquin Indians, who lived along the St. Lawrence River. But these\r\ntribes were the bitter enemies of the Iroquois, who dwelt in what is now\r\ncentral New York, and when, in consequence of this alliance, the French\r\nwere summoned to take the warpath, Champlain, with a few followers,\r\nwent, and on the shore of the lake which now bears his name, not far\r\nfrom the site of Ticonderoga, he met and defeated the Iroquois tribe of\r\nMohawks in July, 1609.\r\n\r\nThe battle was a small affair; but its consequences were serious and\r\nlasting, for the Iroquois were thenceforth the enemies of the French,\r\nand prevented them from ever coming southward and taking possession of\r\nthe Hudson and the Mohawk valleys. When, therefore, the French\r\nmerchants began to engage in the fur trade with the Indians, and the\r\nFrench priests began their efforts to convert the Indians to\r\nChristianity, they were forced to go westward further and further into\r\nthe interior.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: EUROPEAN CLAIMS AND EXPLORATIONS 1650]\r\n\r\nTheir route, instead of being up the St. Lawrence, was up the Ottawa\r\nRiver to its head waters, over the portage to Lake Nipissing, and down\r\nits outlet to Georgian Bay, where the waters of the Great Lakes lay\r\nbefore them (see map on p. 63). They explored these lakes, dotted their\r\nshores here and there with mission and fur-trading stations, and took\r\npossession of the country.\r\n\r\n%55. The French on the Mississippi.%--In the course of these\r\nexplorations the French heard accounts from the Indians of a great\r\nriver to the westward, and in 1672 Father Marquette (mar-ket\') and Louis\r\nJoliet (zho-le-a\') were sent by the governor of New France to search for\r\nit. They set out, in May, 1673, from Michilimackinac, a French trading\r\npost and mission at the foot of Lake Michigan. With five companions, in\r\ntwo birch-bark canoes, they paddled up the lake to Green Bay, entered\r\nFox River, and, dragging the boats through its boiling rapids, came to a\r\nvillage where lived the Miamis and the Kickapoos. These Indians tried to\r\ndissuade them from going on; but Marquette was resolute, and on the 10th\r\nof June, 1673, he led his followers over the swamps and marshes that\r\nseparated Fox River from a river which the Indian guides assured him\r\nflowed into the Mississippi. This westward-flowing river he called the\r\nWisconsin, and there the guides left him, as he says, "alone, amid that\r\nunknown country, in the hands of God."\r\n\r\nThe little band shoved their canoes boldly out upon the river, and for\r\nseven days floated slowly downward into the unknown. At last, on the\r\n17th of June, they paddled out on the bosom of the Mississippi, and,\r\nturning their canoes to the south, followed the bends and twists of the\r\nriver, past the mouth of the Missouri, past the Ohio, to a point not far\r\nfrom the mouth of the Arkansas. There the voyage ended, and the party\r\nwent slowly back to the Lakes.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Read Parkman\'s _La Salle and the Discovery of the Great\r\nWest_.]\r\n\r\n%56. La Salle finishes the Work of Marquette and Joliet.%--The\r\ndiscovery of Marquette and Joliet was the greatest of the age. Yet five\r\nyears went by before Robert de la Salle (lah sahl\') set forth with\r\nauthority from the French King "to labor at the discovery of the western\r\npart of New France," and began the attempt to follow the river to the\r\nsea. In 1678 La Salle and his companions left Canada, and made their way\r\nto the shore of Lake Erie, where during the winter they built and\r\nlaunched the _Griffin_, the first ship that ever floated on those\r\nwaters. In this they sailed to the mouth of Green Bay, and from there\r\npushed on to the Illinois River, to an Indian camp not far from the\r\nsite of Peoria, Ill. Just below this camp La Salle built Fort Cr\xc3\xa8vecoeur\r\n(cra\'v-ker, a word meaning heart-break, vexation).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: %FRENCH CLAIMS% MISSIONS AND TRADING POSTS IN\r\nMISSISSIPPI VALLEY %in 1700%]\r\n\r\nLeaving the party there in charge of Henri de Tonty to construct another\r\nship, he with five companions went back to Canada. On his return he\r\nfound that Fort Cr\xc3\xa8vecoeur was in ruins, and that Tonty and the few men\r\nwho had been faithful were gone, he knew not where. In the hope of\r\nmeeting them he pushed on down the Illinois to the Mississippi. To go on\r\nwould have been easy, but he turned back to find Tonty, and passed the\r\nwinter on the St. Joseph River.\r\n\r\nFrom there in November, 1681, he once more set forth, crossed the lake\r\nto the place where Chicago now is, went up the Chicago River and over\r\nthe portage to the Illinois, and early in February floated out on the\r\nMississippi. It was, on that day, a surging torrent full of trees and\r\nfloating ice; but the explorers kept on their way and came at last to\r\nthe shores of the Gulf of Mexico. There La Salle took formal possession\r\nof all the regions drained by the Mississippi, the Ohio, and their\r\ntributaries, claiming them in the name of France, and naming the country\r\nthus claimed "Louisiana." The iron will, the splendid courage, of La\r\nSalle had triumphed over every obstacle and made him one of the grandest\r\ncharacters in history.\r\n\r\nBut his work was far from ended. The valley he had explored, the\r\nterritory he had added to France, must be occupied, and to occupy it two\r\nthings were necessary: 1. A colony must be planted at the mouth of the\r\nMississippi, to control its navigation and shut out the Spaniards. 2. A\r\nstrong fort must be built on the Illinois, to overawe the Indians.\r\n\r\nIn order to overawe the Indians, La Salle now hurried back to the\r\nIllinois River, where, in December, 1682, near the present town of\r\nOttawa, on the summit of a cliff now known as "Starved Rock," he built a\r\nstockade which he called Fort St. Louis. In 1684, while on a voyage from\r\nFrance to plant a colony on the Mississippi, he missed the mouth and\r\nbrought up on the coast of Texas; and, landing on the sands of\r\nMatagorda Bay, the colonists built another Fort St. Louis. But death\r\nrapidly reduced their numbers, and, in their distress, they parted. Some\r\nremained at the fort and were killed by the Indians. Others, led by La\r\nSalle, started for the Illinois River and reached it; but without their\r\nleader, whom they had murdered on the way.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\n1. After the settlement of Quebec (1608) the French began to explore the\r\nregions lying to the west, discovered the Great Lakes, and heard of a\r\ngreat river--the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n2. This river Marquette and Joliet explored from the mouth of the\r\nWisconsin to the mouth of the Arkansas (1673).\r\n\r\n3. Then La Salle floated down the Mississippi from the Illinois to the\r\nGulf of Mexico, took formal possession of the valley in the name of his\r\nKing, and called it Louisiana (1682).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Starved Rock]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INDIANS\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A typical Indian]\r\n\r\n%57%. When Europeans first set foot on our shores, they found the\r\ncountry already inhabited, and, adopting the name given to the men of\r\nthe New World by Columbus, they called these people "Indians."\r\n\r\nThey were not "Indians," or natives of Asia, but a race by themselves,\r\nwhich ages before the time of Columbus was spread over all North and\r\nSouth America.\r\n\r\nLike their descendants in the West to-day, they had red or\r\ncopper-colored skins, their eyes and long straight hair were jet black,\r\ntheir faces beardless, and their cheek bones high.\r\n\r\n%58. The Villages.%---East of the Rocky Mountains the Indians lived\r\nin villages, often covering several acres in area, and surrounded by\r\nstockades of two and even three rows of posts. The stockade was pierced\r\nwith loopholes, and provided with platforms on which were piles of\r\nstones for the defenders to hurl on the heads of their enemies.\r\nSometimes the structures which formed the village were wigwams--rude\r\nstructures made by driving poles into the ground in a circle, drawing\r\ntheir tops near together, and then covering them with bark or skins.\r\nSometimes the dwellings had rudely framed sides and roofs covered with\r\nlayers of elm bark. Usually these structures were fifteen or twenty feet\r\nwide by 100 feet long. At each end was a door. Along each side were ten\r\nor twelve stalls, in each of which lived a family, so that one house\r\nheld twenty or more families. Down the middle at regular intervals were\r\nfire pits where the food was cooked, the smoke escaping through holes in\r\nthe roof.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Read Parkman\'s _Conspiracy of Pontiac_, Vol. I., pp. 17,\r\n18.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Buffalo-skin lodge]\r\n\r\n%59. Clans and Tribes.%--All the families living in such a house\r\ntraced descent from a common female ancestor, and formed a clan. Each\r\nclan had its own name,--usually that of some animal, as the Wolf, the\r\nBear, or the Turtle,--its own sachem or civil magistrate, and its own\r\nwar chiefs, and owned all the food and all the property, except weapons\r\nand ornaments, in common. A number of such clans made a tribe, which had\r\none language and was governed by a council of the clan sachems.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Seneca long house]\r\n\r\n%60. The Three Indian Races.%--With slight exceptions, the tribes\r\nliving east of the Mississippi are divided, by those who have studied\r\ntheir languages, into three great groups:\r\n\r\n1. The Muskhogees, who lived south of the Tennessee River and comprised\r\nthe Creek, the Seminole, the Choctaw, and the Chickasaw tribes.\r\n\r\n2. The Iroquoian group, which occupied the country from the Delaware and\r\nthe Hudson to and beyond the St. Lawrence and Lakes Ontario and Erie,\r\nbesides isolated tracts in North Carolina and Tennessee. The chief\r\ntribes were the Iroquois proper,--forming a confederacy in central New\r\nYork known as the Five Nations (Senecas, Cayugas, Onondagas, Oneidas,\r\nand Mohawks),--the Hurons, the Eries, the Cherokees, and the Tuscaroras.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Moccasin]\r\n\r\n3. The Algonquian group, which occupied the rest of what is now the\r\nUnited States east of the Mississippi, besides the larger part of\r\nCanada. In this group were the Mohegans, Pequots, and Narragansetts of\r\nNew England; the Delawares; the Powhatans of Virginia; the Shawnees of\r\nthe Ohio valley, and many others living around the Great Lakes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Flint Hatchet]\r\n\r\n%61. Weapons and Implements and Clothing.%--All of these tribes had\r\nmade some progress towards civilization. They used pottery and\r\nornamental pipes of clay. They raised beans and squashes, pumpkins,\r\ntobacco, and maize, or Indian corn, which they ground to meal by rubbing\r\nbetween two stones. For hunting they had bows, arrows with stone heads,\r\nhatchets of flint, and spears. In summer they went almost naked. In\r\nwinter they wore clothing made from the skins of fur-bearing animals and\r\nthe hides of buffalo and deer. For navigating streams and rivers, lakes\r\nand bays, they constructed canoes of birch bark sewed together with\r\nthongs of deerskin and smeared at the joints with spruce-tree gum.\r\n\r\n%62. Traits of Character.%--Living an outdoor life, and depending for\r\ndaily food not so much on the maize they raised as on the fish they\r\ncaught and the animals they killed, the Indians were most expert\r\nwoodsmen. They were swift of foot, quick-witted, keen-sighted, and most\r\npatient of hunger, fatigue, and cold. White men were amazed at the\r\nrapidity with which the Indian followed the most obscure trail over the\r\nmost difficult ground, at the perfection with which he imitated the bark\r\nof the wolf, the hoot of the owl, the call of the moose, and at the\r\ncatlike tread with which he walked over beds of autumn leaves the side\r\nof the grazing deer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Ornamental pipe]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Quiver, with bows and arrows]\r\n\r\nCourage and fortitude he possessed in the highest degree. Yet with his\r\nbravery were associated all the vices, all the dark and crooked ways,\r\nwhich are the resort of the cowardly and the weak. He was treacherous,\r\nrevengeful, and cruel beyond description. Much as he loved war (and war\r\nwas his chief occupation), the fair and open fight had no charm for him.\r\nTo his mind it was madness to take the scalp of an enemy at the risk of\r\nhis own, when he might waylay him in an ambush or shoot him with an\r\narrow from behind a tree. He was never so happy as when, at the dead of\r\nnight, he roused his sleeping victims with an unearthly yell and\r\nmassacred them by the light of their burning home.\r\n\r\n%63. The French and the Indians.%--The ways in which French and\r\nEnglish colonists acted towards the Indian are highly characteristic,\r\nand account for much in our history.\r\n\r\nFrom the day when Champlain, in 1609, joined his Huron-Algonquin\r\nneighbors and went with them on the warpath against the Iroquois, the\r\nFrench held to the policy of making friends with the Indians. No pains\r\nwere spared to win them to the cause of France. They were flattered,\r\npetted, treated with ceremonial respect, and became the companions, as\r\nthe women often became the wives, of the Frenchmen. Much was expected of\r\nthis mingling of races. It was supposed that the Indian would be won\r\nover to civilization and Christianity. But the Frenchmen were won over\r\nto the Indians, and adopted Indian ways of life. They lived in wigwams,\r\nwore Indian dress, decorated their long hair with eagle feathers, and\r\nmade their faces hideous with vermilion, ocher, and soot.\r\n\r\n%64. Coureurs de Bois.%--There soon grew up in this way a class of\r\nhalf-civilized vagrants, who ranged the woods in true Indian style, and\r\ngained a living by guiding the canoes of fur traders along the rivers\r\nand lakes of the interior. Stimulated by the profits of the fur trade,\r\nthese men pushed their traffic to the most distant tribes, spreading\r\nFrench guns, French hatchets, beads, cloth, tobacco and brandy, and\r\nFrench influence over the whole Northwest. Where the trader and the\r\n_coureur de bois_ went, the priest and the soldier followed, and soon\r\nmission houses and forts were established at all the chief passes and\r\nplaces suited to control the Indian trade.\r\n\r\n%65. The English and the Indians.%--How, meantime, did the English\r\nact toward the Indians? In the first place, nothing led them to form\r\nclose relationship with the tribes. The fur trade--the source of\r\nCanadian prosperity--and the zeal of priests eager for the conversion of\r\nthe heathen, which sent the traders, the _coureurs de bois_, and the\r\npriests from tribe to tribe and from the Atlantic halfway to the\r\nPacific, did not appeal to the English colonists. Farming and commerce\r\nwere the sources of their wealth. Their priests and missionaries were\r\ncontent to labor with the Indians near at hand.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, the policy of the French towards the Indians, while\r\nfounded on trade, was directed by one central government. The policy of\r\nthe English was directed by each colony, and was of as many kinds as\r\nthere were colonies. No English frontier exhibited such a mingling of\r\nwhite men and red as was common wherever the French went. Among the\r\nEnglish there were fur traders, but no _coureurs de bois_. Scorn on the\r\none side and hatred on the other generally marked the intercourse\r\nbetween the English and the Indians. One bright exception must indeed be\r\nmade. Penn was a broad-minded lover of his kind, a man of most\r\nenlightened views on government and human rights; and in the colony\r\nplanted by him there was made a serious effort to treat the Indian as an\r\nequal. But the day came when men not of his faith dealt with the Indians\r\nin true English fashion.\r\n\r\nRemembering this difference of treatment, we shall the better understand\r\nhow it happened that the French could sprinkle the West with little\r\nposts far from Quebec and surrounded by the fiercest of tribes, while\r\nthe English could only with difficulty defend their frontier.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A fine account of the Indians, and the French and English\r\nways of treating them, is given in Parkman\'s _Conspiracy of Pontiac_,\r\nVol. I., pp. 16-25, 41-45, 46-56, 64-80.]\r\n\r\n%66. Early Indian Wars.%--Again and again this frontier was attacked.\r\nIn 1636 the Pequots, who dwelt along the Thames River in Connecticut,\r\nmade war on the settlers in the Connecticut River valley towns. Men were\r\nwaylaid and scalped, or taken prisoners and burned at the stake.\r\nDetermined to put an end to this, ninety men from the Connecticut towns,\r\nwith twenty from Massachusetts and some Mohegan Indians, in 1637 marched\r\nagainst the marauders. They found the Pequots within a circular stockade\r\nnear the present town of Stonington, where of 400 warriors all save five\r\nwere killed.\r\n\r\n%67. King Philip\'s War.%--During nearly forty years not a tribe in\r\nall New England dared rise against the white men. But in 1675 trouble\r\nbegan again. The settlers were steadily crowding the Indians off their\r\nlands. No lands were taken without payment, yet the sales were far from\r\nbeing voluntary. A new generation of Indians, too, had grown up, and,\r\nheedless of the lesson taught their fathers, the Narragansetts,\r\nNipmucks, and Wampanoags, led by King Philip and Canonchet, rose upon\r\nthe English. A dreadful war followed. When it ended, in 1678, the three\r\ntribes were annihilated. Hardly any Indians save the friendly Mohawks\r\nwere left in New England. But of ninety English towns, forty had been\r\nthe scene of fire and slaughter, and twelve had been destroyed utterly.\r\n\r\n%68. The Iroquois.%--Elsewhere on the frontier a happier relation\r\nexisted with the Indians. The Iroquois of central New York were the\r\nfiercest and most warlike Indians of the Atlantic coast. But the fight\r\nwith Champlain, in 1609, by turning them into implacable enemies of the\r\nFrench, had rendered them all the more tolerant of the Dutch and the\r\nEnglish, while their complete conquest and subjugation of the Delawares,\r\nor Lenni Lenape, prepared the way for the easy settlement of New Jersey\r\nand Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n%69. Penn and the Lenni Lenape.%--These Indians were Algonquian, and\r\nlived along the Delaware River and its tributaries. But early in the\r\nseventeenth century they had been reduced to vassalage by the Five\r\nNations, had been forbidden to carry arms, and had been forced to take\r\nthe name of Women.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Read Parkman\'s _Conspiracy of Pontiac_, Vol. I., pp. 30-32,\r\n80-82.]\r\n\r\nWhen the Dutch and Swedes began their settlements on the South River,\r\nand when Penn, in 1683, made a treaty with the Delawares, the settlers\r\nhad to deal with peaceful Indians. No horrid wars mark the early history\r\nof Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n%70. The Powhatans in Virginia.%--Much the same may be said of the\r\nVirginia tribes. They were far from friendly, and had they been as\r\nfierce and warlike as the northern tribes, neither the skill of John\r\nSmith, nor the marriage of Pocahontas (the daughter of Powhatan) with\r\nJohn Rolfe, nor fear of the English muskets, would have saved Jamestown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Powhatan Indians at work[1]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: From a model.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the destruction of the tribes in New England and the\r\nfeud between the French and the Iroquois saved New England. For the time\r\nhad now come for the opening of the long struggle between the French and\r\nthe English for the ownership of the continent.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\n1. The inhabitants of the New World at the time of its discovery, by\r\nmistake called Indians, were barbarians, lived in rude, frail houses,\r\nand used weapons and implements inferior to those of the whites.\r\n\r\n2. The Indian tribes of eastern North America are mostly divided into\r\nthree great groups: Muskhogean, Iroquoian, and Algonquian.\r\n\r\n3. In general, the French made the Indians their friends, while the\r\nEnglish drove them westward and treated them as an inferior race.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BRITISH COLONIES AND EUROPEAN POSSESSIONS 1733]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STRUGGLE FOR NEW FRANCE AND LOUISIANA\r\n\r\n%71. Louisiana, or the Mississippi Basin.%--The landing of La Salle\r\non the coast of Texas, and the building of Fort St. Louis of Texas, gave\r\nthe French a claim to the coast as far southward as a point halfway\r\nbetween the fort and the nearest Spanish settlement, in Mexico. At that\r\npoint was the Rio Grande, a good natural boundary. On the French maps,\r\ntherefore, Louisiana extended from the Rocky Mountains and the Rio\r\nGrande on the west, to the Alleghany Mountains on the east, and from the\r\nGulf of Mexico on the south, to New France on the north. This confined\r\nthe English colonies to a narrow strip between the Alleghany Mountains\r\nand the Atlantic Ocean. As the colonies were growing in population, and\r\nas the charters of Massachusetts, Connecticut, Virginia, and Carolina\r\ngave them great stretches of territory in the Mississippi valley, it was\r\ninevitable that, sooner or later, a bitter contest for possession of the\r\ncountry should take place between the French and the English in America.\r\n\r\nThe contest began in 1689, and ended in 1763, and may easily be divided\r\ninto two periods: 1. That from 1689 to 1748, when the struggle was for\r\nAcadia and New France. 2. That from 1754 to 1763, when the struggle was\r\nnot only for New France, but for Louisiana also.\r\n\r\n%72. The Struggle for Acadia and New France; "King William\'s\r\nWar."%--In 1688-89 there was a revolution in England, in the course\r\nof which James II. was driven from his throne, and William and Mary, his\r\nnephew and daughter, were seated on it. James took refuge in France, and\r\nwhen Louis XIV. attempted to restore him, a great European war\r\nfollowed, and of course the colonists of the two countries were very\r\nsoon fighting each other. As the quarrel did not arise on this side of\r\nthe ocean, the English colonists called it "King William\'s War"; but on\r\nour continent it was really the beginning of a long struggle to\r\ndetermine whether France or England should rule North America.\r\n\r\nThe French recognized this at once, and sent over a very able\r\nsoldier--Count Frontenac--with orders to conquer New York; but the\r\ncolony was saved by the Iroquois, who in the summer of 1689 began a war\r\nof their own against the French, laid siege to Montreal, and roasted\r\nFrench captives under its walls. Frontenac was compelled to put off his\r\nattack till 1690, when in the dead of winter a band of French and\r\nIndians burned Schenectady, N.Y. Salmon Falls in New Hampshire was next\r\nlaid waste (1690), and Fort Loyal, where Portland, Me., is, was taken\r\nand destroyed. A little later Exeter, N.H., was attacked. The boldness\r\nand suddenness of these fearful massacres so alarmed the people exposed\r\nto them that in May, 1690, delegates from Massachusetts, Plymouth,\r\nConnecticut, and New York met at New York city to devise a plan of\r\nattack on the French. Now, at the opening of the war, there were three\r\nFrench strongholds in America. These were Montreal and Quebec in Canada,\r\nand Port Royal in Acadia. In 1690 a Massachusetts fleet led by Sir\r\nWilliam Phips destroyed Port Royal. It was decided, therefore, to send\r\nanother fleet under Phips to take Quebec, while troops from New York and\r\nConnecticut marched against Montreal. Both expeditions were failures,\r\nand for seven years the French and Indians ravaged the frontier. In 1692\r\nYork, in Maine, was visited and a third of the inhabitants killed. In\r\n1694 Castine was taken and a hundred persons scalped and tomahawked. At\r\nDurham, in New Hampshire, prisoners were burned alive. Groton, in\r\nMassachusetts, was next visited; but the boldest of all was the\r\nmassacre, in 1697, at Haverhill, a town not thirty-five miles from\r\nBoston. In 1696, Frontenac, at the head of a great array of Canadians,\r\n_coureurs de bois_, and Indians, invaded the country of the Onondagas,\r\nand leveled their fortified town to the earth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP OF PART OF ACADIA]\r\n\r\n%73. The Struggle for Acadia and New France; "Queen Anne\'s War."%--In\r\n1697 the war ended with the treaty of Ryswick, and "King William\'s War"\r\ncame to a close in America with nothing gained and much lost on each\r\nside. The peace, however, did not last long, for in 1701 England and\r\nFrance were again fighting. As William died in 1702, and was succeeded\r\nby his sister-in-law Anne, the struggle which followed in America was\r\ncalled "Queen Anne\'s War." Again Port Royal was captured (1710); again\r\nan expedition went against Quebec and failed (1711); and again, year\r\nafter year, the French and Indians swept along the frontier of New\r\nEngland, burning towns and slaughtering and torturing the inhabitants.\r\nAt last the treaty of Utrecht, in 1713, ended the strife, and the first\r\nsigns of English conquest in America were visible, for the French gave\r\nup Acadia and acknowledged the claims of the English to Newfoundland and\r\nthe country around Hudson Bay. The name Acadia was changed by the\r\nconquerors to Nova Scotia. Port Royal, never again to be parted with,\r\nthey called Annapolis, in honor of the Queen.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Read Parkman\'s _A Half-century of Conflict_, Vol. I., pp.\r\n1-149.]\r\n\r\n%74. The French take Possession of the Mississippi Valley; the Chain of\r\nForts.%--The peace made at Utrecht was unbroken for thirty years. But\r\nthis long period was, on the part of the French in America, at least, a\r\ntime of careful preparation for the coming struggle for possession of\r\nthe valleys of the Mississippi, the Ohio, and the Lakes. In the\r\nMississippi valley most elaborate preparations for defense were already\r\nunder way. No sooner did the treaty of Ryswick end the first French war\r\nthan a young naval officer named Iberville applied to the King for leave\r\nto take out an expedition and found a colony at the mouth of the\r\nMississippi, just as La Salle had attempted to do. Permission was\r\nreadily given, and in 1698 Iberville sailed with two ships from France,\r\nand in February, 1699, entered Mobile Bay. Leaving his fleet at anchor,\r\nhe set off with a party in small boats in search of the great river. He\r\ncoasted along the shore, entered the Mississippi through one of its\r\nthree mouths, and went up the river till he came to an Indian village,\r\nwhere the chief gave him a letter which Tonty, thirteen years before,\r\nwhen in search of La Salle, had written and left in the crotch of\r\na tree.\r\n\r\nIberville now knew that he was on the Mississippi; but having seen no\r\nspot along its low banks suitable for the site of a city, he went back\r\nand led his colony to Biloxi Bay, and there settled it. Thus when the\r\neighteenth century opened there were in all Louisiana but two French\r\nsettlements--that founded on the Illinois River by La Salle, and that\r\nbegun by Iberville at Biloxi. But the occupation of Louisiana was now\r\nthe established policy of France, and hardly a year went by without one\r\nor more forts appearing somewhere in the valley. Before 1725 came,\r\nMobile Bay was occupied, New Orleans was founded, and Forts Rosalie,\r\nToulouse, Tombeckbee, Natchitoches, Assumption, and Chartres were\r\nerected. Along the Lakes, Detroit had been founded, Niagara was built in\r\n1726, and in 1731 a band of Frenchmen, entering New York, put up\r\nCrown Point.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Parkman\'s _A Half-century of Conflict_, Vol. I., pp.\r\n288-314. For the French posts see map on pp. 74, 75.]\r\n\r\nThe meaning of this chain of forts stretching from New Orleans and\r\nMobile to Lake Champlain and Montreal, was that the French were\r\ndetermined to shut the English out of the valley of the Mississippi, and\r\nto keep them away from the shores of the Great Lakes. But they were also\r\ndetermined at the first chance to reconquer Annapolis and Nova Scotia,\r\nwhich they had lost by the treaty of Utrecht in 1713. As a very\r\nimportant step towards the accomplishment of this purpose, the French\r\nselected a harbor on the southeast coast of Cape Breton Island, and\r\nthere built Louisburg, a fortress so strong that the French officers\r\nboasted that it could be defended by a garrison of women.\r\n\r\n%75. The Struggle for New France; "King George\'s War."%--Such was the\r\nsituation in America when (in March, 1744) France declared war on\r\nEngland and began what in Europe was called the "War of the Austrian\r\nSuccession"; but in our country it was known as "King George\'s War,"\r\nbecause George II. was then King of England. The French, with their\r\nusual promptness, rushed down and burned the little English post of\r\nCanso, in Nova Scotia, carried off the garrison, and attacked Annapolis,\r\nwhere they were driven off. That Nova Scotia could be saved, seemed\r\nhopeless. Nevertheless, Governor Shirley of Massachusetts determined to\r\nmake the attempt, and that the King might know the exact situation he\r\nsent to London, with a dispatch, an officer named Captain Ryal, who had\r\nbeen taken prisoner at Canso and afterwards released on parole.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The reception of that officer well illustrates the gross\r\nignorance of America and American affairs which then existed in England.\r\nWhen the Duke of Newcastle, who was prime minister, read the dispatch,\r\nhe exclaimed: "Oh, yes--yes--to be sure. Annapolis must be\r\ndefended--troops must be sent to Annapolis. Pray where is Annapolis?\r\nCape Breton an island! Wonderful! Show it me on the map. So it is, sure\r\nenough. My dear sir [to Captain Ryal], you always bring us good news. I\r\nmust go and tell the King that Cape Breton is an island."]\r\n\r\nAlthough Shirley applied to the King for help with which to defend Nova\r\nScotia, he knew full well that the burden of defense would fall on the\r\ncolonies. And with that determination and persistence which always\r\nbrings success he labored hard to persuade New Hampshire, Connecticut,\r\nand Rhode Island to join with Massachusetts in an effort to capture\r\nLouisburg. It would be delightful to tell how he overcame all\r\ndifficulties; how the young men rallied on the call for troops; how at\r\nthe end of March, 1745, 4000 of them in a hundred transports and\r\naccompanied by fourteen armed ships set sail, followed by the prayers of\r\nall New England, and after a siege of six weeks took the fortress on the\r\n17th of June, 1745. But the story is too long.[1] It is enough to know\r\nthat the victory was hailed with delight on both sides of the Atlantic,\r\nbut that when peace came, in 1748, the British government was still so\r\nblind to the struggle for North America which had been going on for\r\nfifty years, that Louisburg was restored to the French.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Read Samuel Adams Drake\'s _Taking of Louisburg_; Parkman\'s\r\n_A Half-century of Conflict_, Vol. II., pp. 78-161.]\r\n\r\n%76. The French on the Allegheny River; the Buried Plates.%--With\r\nLouisburg back in their possession and no territory lost, the French\r\nwent on more vigorously than ever with their preparations to shut the\r\nBritish out of the Mississippi valley; and as but one highway to the\r\nvalley, the Ohio River, was still unguarded, the governor of Canada, in\r\n1749, dispatched C\xc3\xa9loron de Bienville with a band of men in twenty-three\r\nbirch-bark canoes to take formal possession of the valley. Paddling up\r\nthe St. Lawrence and Lake Ontario, they carried their canoes across to\r\nLake Erie, and, skirting the southeastern shore, they landed and crossed\r\nto Chautauqua Lake, down which and its outlet they floated to the\r\nAllegheny River. Once on the Allegheny, the ceremony of taking\r\npossession began. The men were drawn up, and Louis XV. was proclaimed\r\nking of all the region drained by the Ohio. The arms of France stamped\r\non a sheet of tin were nailed to a tree, at the foot of which a lead\r\nplate was buried in the ground. On the plate was an inscription claiming\r\nthe Ohio, and all the streams that run into it, in the name of the King\r\nof France.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: [1]Half of one of the lead plates]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Now owned by the American Antiquarian Society, Worcester,\r\nMass.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTRANSLATION OF THE ENTIRE INSCRIPTION\r\n\r\nIn the year 1749, during the reign of Louis XV., King of France, we,\r\nC\xc3\xa9leron, commander of a detachment sent by the Marquis de la\r\nGallissoni\xc3\xa8re, commander in chief of New France, to restore tranquillity\r\nin some savage villages of these districts, have buried this plate at\r\nthe confluence of the Ohio and ... this ... near the river Ohio, alias\r\nBeautiful River, as a monument of our having retaken possession of the\r\nsaid river Ohio and of those that fall into the same, and of all the\r\nlands on both sides as far as the sources of the said rivers, as well as\r\nof those of which preceding kings have enjoyed possession, partly by the\r\nforce of arms, partly by treaties, especially by those of Ryswick,\r\nUtrecht, and Aix-la-Chapelle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA second plate was buried below the mouth of French Creek; a third near\r\nthe mouth of Wheeling Creek; and a fourth at the mouth of the Muskingum,\r\nwhere half a century later it was found protruding from the river bank\r\nby a party of boys while bathing. Yet another was unearthed at the mouth\r\nof the Great Kanawha by a freshet, and was likewise found by a boy while\r\nplaying at the water\'s edge. The last plate was hidden where the Great\r\nMiami joins the Ohio; and this done, C\xc3\xa9loron crossed Ohio to Lake Erie\r\nand went back to Montreal.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Read T. J. Chapman\'s _The French in the Allegheny Valley_,\r\npp. 9-23, 187-197; Parkman\'s _Montcalm and Wolfe_, Vol. I., pp. 36-62;\r\nWinsor\'s _The Mississippi Basin_, pp. 252-255.]\r\n\r\n%77. The French build Forts on the Allegheny.%--This formal taking\r\npossession of the valleys of the Allegheny and the Ohio was all well\r\nenough in its way; but the French knew that if they really intended to\r\nkeep out the British they must depend on forts and troops, and not on\r\nlead plates. To convince the French King of this, required time; so that\r\nit was not till 1752 that orders were given to fortify the route taken\r\nby C\xc3\xa9loron in 1749. The party charged with this duty repaired to the\r\nlittle peninsula where is now the city of Erie, and there built a log\r\nfort which they called Presque Isle. Having done this, they cut a road\r\ntwenty miles long, to the site of Waterford, Pa., and built Fort Le\r\nBoeuf, and later one at Venango, the present site of the town\r\nof Franklin.\r\n\r\n%78. Washington\'s First Public Service.%--The arrival of the French\r\nin western Pennsylvania alarmed and excited no one so much as Governor\r\nRobert Dinwiddie of Virginia. He had two good reasons for his\r\nexcitement. In the first place, Virginia, because of the interpretation\r\nshe placed on her charter of 1609, claimed to own the Allegheny valley\r\n(see p. 33). In the second place, the governor and a number of Virginia\r\nplanters were deeply interested in a great land company called the Ohio\r\nCompany, to which the King of England had given 500,000 acres lying\r\nalong the Ohio River between the Monongahela and the Kanawha rivers, a\r\nregion which the French claimed, and toward which they were moving.\r\n\r\nAs soon, therefore, as Dinwiddie heard that the French were really\r\nbuilding forts in the upper Allegheny valley, he determined to make a\r\nformal demand for their withdrawal, and chose as his messenger George\r\nWashington, then a young man of twenty-one, and adjutant general of the\r\nVirginia militia.\r\n\r\nWashington\'s instructions bade him go to Logstown, on the Ohio, find out\r\nall he could as to the whereabouts of the French, and then proceed to\r\nthe commanding officer, deliver the letter of Dinwiddie, and demand an\r\nanswer. He was especially charged to ascertain how many French forts had\r\nbeen erected, how many soldiers there were in each, how far apart the\r\nposts were, and if they were to be supported from Quebec.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Read T.J. Chapman\'s _The, French in the Allegheny Valley_,\r\npp. 23-47; Parkman\'s _Montcalm and Wolfe_, Vol. I., pp. 128-161; Lodge\'s\r\n_George Washington_, pp. 62-69.]\r\n\r\nWith that promptness which distinguished him during his whole life,\r\nWashington set out on his perilous journey the very day he received his\r\ninstructions, and made his way first to Logstown, and then to Fort Le\r\nBoeuf, where he delivered Governor Dinwiddie\'s letter to the French\r\ncommandant. The reply of Saint-Pierre--for that was the name of the\r\nFrench commandant--was that he would send the letter of Dinwiddie to the\r\ngovernor of Canada, the Marquis Duquesne (doo-kan\'), and that, in the\r\nmeantime, he would hold the fort.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The French and the English Forts]\r\n\r\n%79. Fort Duquesne.%--When Dinwiddie read the answer of Saint-Pierre,\r\nhe saw clearly that the time had come to act. The French were in force\r\non the upper Allegheny. Unless something was done to drive them out,\r\nthey would soon be at the forks of the Ohio, and once they were there,\r\nthe splendid tract of the Ohio Company would be lost forever. Without a\r\nmoment\'s delay he decided to take possession of the forks of the Ohio,\r\nand raised two companies of militia of 100 men each. A trader named\r\nWilliam Trent was in command of one of the companies, and that no time\r\nshould be lost, he, with forty men, hurried forward, and, February 17,\r\n1754, drove the first stake of a stockade that was to surround a fort on\r\nthe site of the city of Pittsburg. While the English were still at work\r\non their fort, April 17, 1754, a body of French and Indians came down\r\nfrom Le Boeuf, and bade them leave the valley. Trent was away, and the\r\nworking party was in command of an ensign named Ward, who, as resistance\r\nwas useless, surrendered, and was allowed to march off with his men. The\r\nFrench then finished the fort Trent had begun, and called it Fort\r\nDuquesne, after the governor of Canada.\r\n\r\n%80. "Join or Die."%--Meantime the legislature of Virginia voted\r\n\xc2\xa310,000 for the defense of the Ohio valley, and promised a land bounty\r\nto every man who would volunteer to fight the French and Indians. Joshua\r\nFrye was made colonel, and Washington lieutenant colonel of the troops\r\nthus to be raised. As some time must elapse before the ranks could be\r\nfilled, Washington took seventy-five men and (in March, 1754) set off to\r\nhelp Trent; but he had not gone far on his way when Ensign Ward met him\r\n(where Cumberland, Md., now is) and told him all about the surrender.\r\nAccounts of the affair were at once sent to the governors of Maryland,\r\nPennsylvania, and Virginia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOIN, or DIE.]\r\n\r\nIn publishing one of these in the _Pennsylvania Gazette_, Franklin\r\ninserted the above picture at the top of the account.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: There is an old superstition, then very generally believed,\r\nthat if one cuts a snake in pieces and allows the pieces to touch, the\r\nsnake will not die, but will live and become whole again. By this\r\npicture Franklin meant that unless the colonies joined for defense\r\nagainst the French they would die; that is, be conquered.]\r\n\r\n%81. Albany Plan of Union.%--The picture was apt for the following\r\nreason. The Lords of Trade in London had ordered the colonies to send\r\ndelegates to Albany to make a treaty with the Iroquois Indians, and to\r\nthis congress Franklin purposed to submit a plan for union against the\r\nFrench. The plan drawn up by the congress was not approved by the\r\ncolonies, so the scheme of union came to naught.\r\n\r\n%82. Washington\'s Expedition.%--Meanwhile great events were happening\r\nin the west. When Washington met Ensign Ward at Cumberland and heard the\r\nstory of the surrender, he was at a loss just what to do; but knowing\r\nthat he was expected to do something, he decided to go to a storehouse\r\nwhich the Ohio Company had built at the mouth of a stream called\r\nRedstone Creek in southwestern Pennsylvania. Pushing along, cutting as\r\nhe went the first road that ever led down to the valley of the\r\nMississippi from the Atlantic slope, he reached a narrow glade called\r\nthe Great Meadows and there began to put up a breastwork which he named\r\nFort Necessity. While so engaged news came that the French were near.\r\nWashington thereupon took a few men, and, coming suddenly on the French,\r\nkilled or captured them all save one. Among the dead was Jumonville, the\r\nleader of the party. Well satisfied with this exploit, Washington pushed\r\non with his entire force towards the Ohio. But, hearing that the French\r\nwere advancing, he fell back to Fort Necessity, and there awaited them.\r\nHe did not wait long; for the French and Indians came down in great\r\nforce, and on July 4, 1754, forced him, after a brave resistance, to\r\nsurrender. He was allowed to march out with drums beating and flags\r\nflying.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Lodge\'s _George Washington_, pp. 69-74; Winsor\'s _The\r\nMississippi Basin_, pp. 294-315.]\r\n\r\n%83. The French and Indian War.%--Thus was begun what the colonists\r\ncalled the French and Indian War, but what was really a struggle\r\nbetween the French and the British for the possession of America.\r\nKnowing it to be such, both sides made great preparations for the\r\ncontest. The French stood on the defensive. The British made the attack,\r\nand early in 1755 sent over one of their ablest officers, Major General\r\nEdward Braddock, to be commander in chief in America. He summoned the\r\ncolonial governors to meet him at Alexandria, Va., where a plan for a\r\ncampaign was agreed on.\r\n\r\n%84. Plan for the War.%--Vast stretches of dense and almost\r\nimpenetrable forest then separated the colonies of the two nations, but\r\nthrough this forest were three natural highways of communication: 1.\r\nLake George, Lake Champlain, and the St. Lawrence River. 2. The Hudson,\r\nthe Mohawk, Lake Ontario, and the Niagara River. 3. The Potomac to Fort\r\nCumberland, and through the forest to Fort Duquesne.\r\n\r\nIt was decided, therefore, to have four expeditions.\r\n\r\n1. One was to go north from New York to Lake Champlain, take the French\r\nfort at Crown Point, and move against Quebec.\r\n\r\n2. Another was to sail from New England and make such a demonstration\r\nagainst the French towns to the northeast, as would prevent the French\r\nin that quarter going off to defend Quebec and Crown Point.\r\n\r\n3. The third was to start from Albany, go up the Mohawk, and down the\r\nOswego River to Lake Ontario, and along its shores to the Niagara River.\r\n\r\n4. The fourth was to go from Fort Cumberland across Pennsylvania to Fort\r\nDuquesne.\r\n\r\n%85. Braddock\'s Defeat, July 9, 1755.%--Braddock took command of this\r\nlast expedition and made Washington one of his aids. For a while he\r\nfound it impossible to move his army, for in Virginia horses and wagons\r\nwere very scarce, and without them he could not carry his baggage or\r\ndrag his cannon. At last Benjamin Franklin, then deputy\r\npostmaster-general of the colonies, persuaded the farmers of\r\nPennsylvania, who had plenty, to rent the wagons and horses to\r\nthe general.\r\n\r\nAll this took time, so that it was June before the army left Fort\r\nCumberland and literally began to cut its way through the woods to Fort\r\nDuquesne. The march was slow, but all went well till the troops had\r\ncrossed the Monongahela River and were but eight miles from the fort,\r\nwhen suddenly the advance guard came face to face with an army of\r\nIndians and French. The Indians and French instantly hid in the bushes\r\nand behind trees, and poured an incessant fire into the ranks of the\r\nBritish. They, too, would gladly have fought in Indian fashion. But\r\nBraddock thought this cowardly and would not allow them to get behind\r\ntrees, so they stood huddled in groups, a fine mark for the Indians,\r\ntill so many were killed that a retreat had to be ordered. Then they\r\nfled, and had it not been for Washington and his Virginians, who covered\r\ntheir flight, they would probably have been killed to a man.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Read Parkman\'s _Montcalm and Wolfe_, Vol. I., Chap. 7, pp.\r\n162-187; T.J. Chapman\'s _The French in the Allegheny Valley_, pp. 60-72;\r\nSargeant\'s _History of Braddock\'s Expedition_.]\r\n\r\nBraddock was wounded just as the retreat began, and died a few days\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n%86. The Other Expeditions.%--The expedition against Niagara was a\r\nfailure. The officer in command did not take his army further than\r\nOswego on Lake Ontario.\r\n\r\nThe expedition against Crown Point was partially successful, and a\r\nstubborn battle was fought and a victory won over the French on the\r\nshores of that beautiful sheet of water which the English ever after\r\ncalled Lake George in honor of the King.\r\n\r\n%87. War declared.%--Up to this time all the fighting had been done\r\nalong the frontier in America. But in May, 1756, Great Britain formally\r\ndeclared war against France. The French at once sent over Montcalm,[1]\r\nthe very ablest Frenchman that ever commanded on this continent, and\r\nthere followed two years of warfare disastrous to the British. Montcalm\r\ntook and burned Oswego, won over the Indians to the cause of France, and\r\nwas about to send a strong fleet to attack New England, when, toward the\r\nend of 1757, William Pitt was made virtually (though not in name) Prime\r\nMinister of England.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Read Parkman\'s _Montcalm and Wolfe_, Vol. I., pp. 318-380.]\r\n\r\nWilliam Pitt was one of the greatest Englishmen that ever lived. He\r\ncould see exactly what to do, and he could pick out exactly the right\r\nman to do it. No wonder, then, that as soon as he came into power the\r\nBritish began to gain victories.\r\n\r\n%88. The Victories of 1758.%--Once more the French were attacked at\r\ntheir three vulnerable points, and this time with success. In 1758\r\nLouisburg surrendered to Amherst and Boscawen. In that same year\r\nWashington captured Fort Duquesne, which, in honor of the great Prime\r\nMinister, was called Fort Pitt. A provincial officer named Bradstreet\r\ndestroyed Fort Frontenac on Lake Ontario. This was a heavy blow to the\r\nFrench; for with Fort Frontenac gone and Fort Duquesne in English hands,\r\nthe Ohio was cut off from Quebec.\r\n\r\nAn attack on Ticonderoga, however, was repulsed by Montcalm with\r\ndreadful loss to the English.\r\n\r\n%89. The Victories of 1759; Wolfe.%--But the defeat was only\r\ntemporary. At the siege of Louisburg a young officer named James Wolfe\r\nhad greatly distinguished himself, and in return for this was selected\r\nby Pitt to command an expedition to Quebec. The previous attempts to\r\nreach that city had been by way of Lake George. The expedition of Wolfe\r\nsailed up the St. Lawrence, and landed below the city.\r\n\r\nQuebec stands on the summit of a high hill with precipitous sides, and\r\nwas then the most strongly fortified city in America. To take it seemed\r\nalmost impossible. But the resolution of Wolfe overcame every obstacle:\r\non the night of September 12, 1759, he led his troops to the foot of the\r\ncliff, climbed the heights, and early in the morning had his army drawn\r\nup in battle array on the Plains of Abraham, as the plateau behind the\r\ncity was called. There a great battle was fought between the French, led\r\nby Montcalm, and the British, led by Wolfe. The British triumphed, and\r\nQuebec fell; but Wolfe and Montcalm were among the dead.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Parkman\'s _Montcalm and Wolfe_, Chaps. 25-27; A. Wright\'s\r\n_Life of Wolfe;_ Sloan\'s _French War and the Revolution_, Chaps. 6-9.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: European Possessions 1763]\r\n\r\nTiconderoga and Crown Point had been captured a few weeks before.\r\nMontreal was taken in 1760, and the long struggle between the French and\r\nthe English in America ended in the defeat of the French. The war\r\ndragged on in Europe till 1763, when peace was made at Paris.\r\n\r\n%90. France driven out of America.%--With all the details of the\r\ntreaty we are not concerned. It is enough for us to know that France\r\ndivided her possessions on this continent between Great Britain and\r\nSpain. To Great Britain she gave Canada and Cape Breton, and all the\r\nislands save two in the Gulf of St. Lawrence. Entering what is now the\r\nUnited States, she drew a line down the middle of the Mississippi River\r\nfrom its source to a point just north of New Orleans. To Great Britain\r\nshe surrendered all her territory east of this line. To Spain she gave\r\nall her possessions to the west of this line, together with the city of\r\nNew Orleans. But Great Britain, during the war, had taken Havana from\r\nSpain. To get this back, Spain now gave up Florida in exchange.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the war with France, Great Britain thus found herself in\r\npossession of Canada and all that part of the United States which lies\r\nbetween the Atlantic and the Mississippi, the little strip at the mouth\r\nof the river alone excepted.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\nWe have now come to the time when the third European power was driven\r\nfrom our country. The first was Sweden when New Sweden was captured by\r\nthe Dutch. The second was Holland when New Netherland was captured by\r\nthe English. The third was France.\r\n\r\n1. The struggle for the French possessions in America may be divided\r\ninto two periods: A. That from 1689 to 1748, when the contest was for\r\nAcadia and New France. B. That from 1754 to 1763, when the struggle was\r\nfor Louisiana as well as New France.\r\n\r\n2. The first war, "King William\'s," was indecisive, but the second,\r\n"Queen Anne\'s," ended (1713) in the transfer of Acadia to England.\r\n\r\n3. After the treaty of Utrecht, 1713, the French began seriously to take\r\npossession of the Mississippi valley, and began a chain of forts to\r\nstretch from New Orleans and Mobile to Montreal.\r\n\r\n4. "King George\'s War" interrupted this work for a few years\r\n(1744-1748), but in 1749 C\xc3\xa9leron was sent to bury plates in the valleys\r\nof the Allegheny and Ohio and claim them in the name of France.\r\n\r\n5. The next step after claiming the valleys was to take armed\r\npossession, and in 1752 the French began to build forts.\r\n\r\n6. This alarmed the governor of Virginia, who sent Washington to bid the\r\nFrench leave the Allegheny valley. When they refused, troops were sent\r\nto build a fort on the site of what is now Pittsburg; but these men,\r\nunder Trent and Ward, were driven away, as were also the reinforcements\r\nunder Washington (1764).\r\n\r\n7. Braddock (with Washington) was next sent against the French, who had\r\nbuilt Fort Duquesne. He was surprised by the Indians (July 9, 1755),\r\ndefeated, and killed.\r\n\r\n8. The "French and Indian War" thus opened was fought with varying\r\nsuccess till 1760, when the British held Quebec, Montreal, Fort\r\nDuquesne, and all the other French strongholds in America. In 1763 peace\r\nwas made, and nearly all the French possessions east of the Mississippi\r\nRiver were surrendered to the British.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\nTHE FRENCH DRIVEN FROM AMERICA:\r\n\r\nTHE STRUGGLE FOR NEW FRANCE AND ACADIA:\r\n\r\nKing William\'s War:\r\n\r\n     1690.

Things unknown in 1763.%--Had a traveler landed on our shores in\r\n1763 and made a journey through the English colonies in America, he\r\nwould have seen a country utterly unlike the United States of to-day.\r\nThe entire population, white man and black, freeman and slave, was not\r\nso great as that of New York or Philadelphia or Chicago in our time. If\r\nwe were to write a list of all the things we now consider as real\r\nnecessaries of daily life and mark off those unknown to the men of 1763,\r\nnot one quarter would remain. No man in the country had ever seen a\r\nstove, or a furnace, or a friction match, or an envelope, or a piece of\r\nmineral coal. From the farmer we should have to take the reaper, the\r\ndrill, the mowing machine, and every kind of improved rake and plow, and\r\ngive him back the scythe, the cradle, and the flail. From our houses\r\nwould go the sewing machine, the daily newspaper, gas, running water;\r\nand from our tables, the tomato, the cauliflower, the eggplant, and many\r\nvarieties of summer fruits. We should have to destroy every railroad,\r\nevery steamboat, every factory and mill, pull down every line of\r\ntelegraph, silence every telephone, put out every electric light, and\r\ntear up every telegraphic cable from the beds of innumerable rivers and\r\nseas. We should have to take ether and chloroform from the surgeon, and\r\ngalvanized iron and India rubber from the arts, and give up every sort\r\nof machine moved by steam.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Lamp and sadiron]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Postrider (Footnote: From an old print, 1760)]\r\n\r\n%92. State of the Arts, Sciences, and Industry.%--The appliances left\r\non the list, because in some form they were known to the men of 1763,\r\nwould now be thought crude and clumsy. There were printing presses in\r\nthose days,--perhaps fifty in all the colonies. But they were small,\r\nwere worked by hand, and were so slow that the most expert pressman\r\nusing one of them could not have printed so much in three working days\r\nas a modern steam press can run off in five minutes. There was a general\r\npost, and Benjamin Franklin was deputy postmaster-general for the\r\nnorthern district of the colonies. But the letters were carried thirty\r\nmiles a day by postriders on horseback, and there were never more than\r\nthree mails a week between even the great towns. Every Monday,\r\nWednesday, and Friday a postrider left New York city for Philadelphia.\r\nEvery Monday and Thursday another left New York for Boston. Once each\r\nweek a rider left for Albany on his way to Quebec. On the first\r\nWednesday of each month a packet boat sailed from New York for Falmouth,\r\nEngland, with the mail, and this was the only mail between Great Britain\r\nand her American colonies. We put electricity to a thousand uses; but in\r\n1763 it was a scientific toy. Franklin had just proved by his experiment\r\nwith the kite that lightning and electricity were one and the same, and\r\nseveral other men were amusing themselves and their hearers by ringing\r\nbells, exploding powder, and making colored sparks. But it was put to no\r\nother use. If we take up a daily newspaper published in one of our great\r\ncities and read the column of wants, we find in them twenty occupations\r\nnow giving a comfortable living to millions of men. Yet not one of these\r\ntwenty existed in 1763. The district messenger, the telegraph operator,\r\nthe typewriter, the stenographer, the bookkeeper, the canvasser, the\r\nsalesman, the commercial traveler, the engineer, the car driver, the\r\nhackman, the conductor, the gripman, the brakeman, the electrician, the\r\nlineman, the elevator boy, and a host of others, follow trades and\r\noccupations which had no existence in the middle of the\r\neighteenth century.\r\n\r\n     Run away, the 23d of this Instant _January_, from _Silas Crispin_\r\n     of _Burlington_, Taylor, a Servant Man named _Joseph Morris, _by\r\n     Trade a Taylor, aged about 22 Years, of a middle Stature, swarthy\r\n     Complexion, light gray Eyes, his Hair clipp\'d off, mark\'d with\r\n     a large pit of the Small Pox on one Cheek near his Eye, had on\r\n     when he went away a good Felt Hat, a yelowish Drugget Coat with\r\n     Pleits behind, an old Ozenbrigs Vest, two Ozenbrigs Shirts, a pair\r\n     of Leather Breeches handsomely worm\'d and flower\'d up the Knees,\r\n     yarn Stockings and good round toe\'d Shoes. Took with him a large\r\n     pair of Sheers crack\'d in one of the Bows & mark\'d with the Word\r\n     [_Savoy_]. Whoever takes up the said Servant, and secures him so\r\n     that his Matter may have him again, shall have _Three Pounds_\r\n     Reward besides reasonable Charges, paid by me _Silas Griffin._\r\n\r\n     From a Philadelphia newspaper\r\n\r\n%93. Labor.%--On the other hand, if we take up a newspaper of that\r\nday and read the advertisements, we find that a great deal of what\r\nexisted then does not exist now. The newspapers were published in a few\r\nof the large towns, and appeared not every day, but once a week. In the\r\nlargest of them would be from seventy-five to eighty advertisements,\r\nsetting forth that such a merchant had just received from England or the\r\nWest Indies a stock of new goods which he would sell for cash; that the\r\n_Charming Nancy_ would sail in a few weeks for Londonderry in Ireland,\r\nor for Barbados, or for Amsterdam in Holland, and wanted a cargo; that a\r\ntract of land or a plantation would be sold "at vendue," or, as we say,\r\nat auction; that a reward of five pistoles would be paid for the arrest\r\nof "a lusty negroe man" or an "indented servant" or an "apprentice lad,"\r\nwho had run away from his owner or master. Very rarely is a call made\r\nfor a mechanic or a workman of any sort.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From a Philadelphia newspaper]\r\n\r\nThe reason for this was two fold. In the first place, negro slavery\r\nexisted in all the thirteen colonies. In the second place, there were\r\nthousands of whites in many of the colonies in a state of temporary\r\nservitude, which was sometimes voluntary and sometimes involuntary.\r\n\r\nThose who served against their will were convicts and felons, not only\r\nmen and women who had been guilty of stealing, cheating, and the like,\r\nbut also forgers, counterfeiters, and murderers, who were transported by\r\nthousands from the English prisons to the colonies and sold into slavery\r\nor service for seven or fourteen years.[1] Advertisements are extant in\r\nwhich the masters from whom such servants have run away warn the people\r\nto beware of them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: One act of Parliament, for instance, provided that persons\r\nsentenced to be whipped or branded might, if they wished, escape the\r\npunishment by serving seven years in the colonies, and never returning\r\nto England. Another allowed convicts sentenced to death to commute the\r\nsentence by serving fourteen years.]\r\n\r\nBut all "indented" or bond servants were not criminals. Many were\r\nreputable persons who sold themselves into service for a term of years\r\nin return for transportation to America. Others, generally boys and\r\nyoung women, had been kidnaped and sold by the persons who stole them.\r\n\r\n%94. Indentured Servants.%--In the case of such as came voluntarily,\r\ncarefully drawn agreements called indentures would be made in writing.\r\nThe captain of the ship would agree to bring the emigrant to America.\r\nThe emigrant would agree in return to serve the captain three or five\r\nyears. When the ship reached port, the captain would advertise the fact\r\nthat he had carpenters, tailors, farmers, shoemakers, etc., for sale,\r\nand whoever wanted such labor would go on board the ship and for perhaps\r\nfifty dollars buy a man bound to serve him for several years in return\r\nfor food, clothes, and lodging. Not only men, but also women and\r\nchildren, were sold in this way, and were known as "indented servants,"\r\nor "redemptioners," because they redeemed their time of service with\r\nlabor. Their lot seems to have been a hard one; for the young men were\r\nconstantly running away, and the newspapers are full of advertisements\r\noffering rewards for their arrest.\r\n\r\nWhat we call the workingman, the day laborer, the mechanic, the mill\r\nhand, had no existence as classes. The great corporations, railroads,\r\nexpress companies, mills, factories of every sort, which now cover our\r\nland and give employment to five times as many men and women as lived in\r\nall the colonies in 1763, are the creatures of our own time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Wigs and wig bag]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Flax wheel]\r\n\r\n%95. No Manufacturers.%--For this state of things England was largely\r\nto blame. For one hundred years past every kind of manufacture that\r\ncould compete with the manufactures of the mother country had been\r\ncrushed by law. In order to help her iron makers, she forbade the\r\ncolonists to set up iron furnaces and slitting mills. That her cloth\r\nmanufacturers might flourish, she forbade the colonists to send their\r\nwoolen goods to any country whatever, or even from one colony to\r\nanother. Under this law it was a crime to knit a pair of mittens or a\r\npair of socks and send them from Boston to Providence or from New York\r\nto Newark, or from Philadelphia across the Delaware to New Jersey. In\r\nthe interest of English hatters the colonists were not allowed to send\r\nhats to any foreign country, nor from one colony to another, and a\r\nserious effort was made to prevent the manufacture of hats in America.\r\nPeople in this country were obliged to wear English-made hats. Taking\r\nthe country through, every saw, every ax, every hammer, every needle,\r\npin, tack, piece of tape, and a hundred other articles of daily use came\r\nfrom Great Britain.\r\n\r\nEvery farmhouse, however, was a little factory, and every farmer a\r\njack-of-all-trades. He and his sons made their own shoes, beat out nails\r\nand spikes, hinges, and every sort of ironmongery, and constructed much\r\nof the household furniture. The wife and her daughters manufactured the\r\nclothing, from dressing the flax and carding the wool to cutting the\r\ncloth; knit the mittens and socks; and during the winter made straw\r\nbonnets to sell in the towns in the spring.\r\n\r\nEven in such towns as were large enough to support a few artisans, each\r\nmade, with the help of an apprentice, and perhaps a journeyman, all the\r\narticles he sold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hand loom[1]]\r\n\r\n%96. The Cities.%--If we take a map of our country and run over the\r\ngreat cities of to-day, we find that except along the seacoast hardly\r\none existed, in 1765, even in name. Detroit was a little French\r\nsettlement surrounded with a high stockade. New Orleans existed, and St.\r\nLouis had just been founded, but they both belonged to Spain. Mobile and\r\nPensacola and Natchez and Vincennes consisted of a few huts gathered\r\nabout old French forts. There was no city, no town worthy of the name,\r\nin the English colonies west of the Alleghany Mountains. Along the\r\nAtlantic coast we find Portsmouth, Boston, Providence, New Haven, New\r\nYork, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Alexandria, Williamsburg, Charleston,\r\nSavannah, and others of less note. But the largest of these were mere\r\ncollections of a few hundred houses ranged along streets, none of which\r\nwere sewered and few of which were paved or lighted. The watchman went\r\nhis rounds at night with rattle and lantern, called out the hours and\r\nthe state of the weather, and stopped and demanded the name of every\r\nperson found walking the streets after nine o\'clock. To travel on Sunday\r\nwas a serious and punishable offense, as it was on any day to smoke in\r\nthe streets, or run from house to house with hot coals, which in those\r\ndays, when there were no matches, were often used instead of flint and\r\nsteel to light fires.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: From an old loom in the National Museum, Washington.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Colonial mansion in Charleston]\r\n\r\nTravel between the large towns was almost entirely by sailing vessel, or\r\non horseback. The first stagecoach-and-four in New England began its\r\ntrips in 1744. The first stage between New York and Philadelphia was not\r\nset up till 1756, and spent three days on the road.\r\n\r\n%97. The Three Groups of Colonies.%--It has always been usual to\r\narrange the colonies in three groups: 1. The Eastern or New England\r\nColonies (New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut).\r\n2. The Middle Colonies (New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and\r\nDelaware). 3. The Southern Colonies (Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina,\r\nSouth Carolina, and Georgia). Now, this arrangement is good not only\r\nfrom a geographical point of view, but also because the people, the\r\ncustoms, the manners, the occupations, in each of these groups were very\r\nunlike the people and the ways of living in the others.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: New England mansion]\r\n\r\n%98. Occupations in New England.%--In New England the colonists were\r\nalmost entirely English, though there were some Scotch, some\r\nScotch-Irish, a few Huguenot refugees from France, and, in Rhode Island,\r\na few Portuguese Jews. As the climate and soil did not admit of raising\r\nany great staple, such as rice or tobacco, the people "took to the sea."\r\nThey cut down trees, with which the land was covered, built ships, and\r\nsailed away to the Grand Banks off Newfoundland for cod, and to the\r\nwhale fisheries for oil. They went to the English, Dutch, and Spanish\r\nWest Indian Islands, with flour, salt meat, horses, oxen; with salted\r\nsalmon, cod, and mackerel; with staves for barrels; with onions and\r\nsalted oysters. In return, they came back with sugar, molasses, cotton,\r\nwool, logwood, and Spanish dollars with which the New England Colonies\r\npaid for the goods they took from England. They went to Spain, where\r\ntheir ships were often sold, the captains chartering English vessels and\r\ncoming home with cargoes of goods made in England. Six hundred ships are\r\nsaid to have been employed in the foreign trade of Boston, and more than\r\na thousand in the fisheries and the trade along the coast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dutch House at Albany[1]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: From an old print.]\r\n\r\nFarming, outside of Connecticut, yielded little more than a bare\r\nsubsistence. Manufactures in general were forbidden by English law.\r\nPaper and hats were made in small quantities, leather was tanned, lumber\r\nwas sawed, and rum was distilled from molasses; but it was on homemade\r\nmanufactures that the people depended.\r\n\r\n%99. Occupations in the Middle Colonies.%--In the Middle Colonies the\r\npopulation was a mixture of people from many European countries. The\r\nline of little villages which began at the west end of Long Island and\r\nstretched up the Hudson to Albany, and out the Mohawk to\r\nSchenectady---the settled part of New York--contained Englishmen,\r\nIrishmen, Dutchmen, French Huguenots, Germans from the Rhine countries,\r\nand negroes from Africa. The chief occupations of those people were\r\nfarming, making flour, and carrying on an extensive commerce with\r\nEngland, Spain, and the West Indian Islands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Shoes worn by Palatines in Pennsylvania]\r\n\r\nIn New Jersey the population was almost entirely English, but in\r\nPennsylvania it was as mixed as in New York. Around Philadelphia the\r\nEnglish predominated, but with them were mingled Swedes, Dutch, Welsh,\r\nGermans, and Scotch-Irish. Taken together, the Germans and the\r\nScotch-Irish far outnumbered the English, and made up the mass of the\r\npopulation between the Schuylkill and the Susquehanna rivers. Both were\r\nself-willed and stubborn, and they were utterly unable to get along\r\ntogether peaceably, so that their settlements ran across the state in\r\ntwo parallel bands, in one of which whole regions could be found in\r\nwhich not a word of English was spoken. Indeed, then, and long after the\r\nnineteenth century began, the laws of Pennsylvania were printed both in\r\nEnglish and in German. The chief occupation of the people was farming;\r\nand it is safe to say that no such farms, no such cattle, no such grain,\r\nflour, provisions, could be found in any other part of the country.\r\nLumber, too, was cut and sold in great quantities; and along the\r\nfrontier there was a lively fur trade with the Indians. At Philadelphia\r\nwas centered a fine trade with Europe and the West Indies. Had it not\r\nbeen for the action of the mother country, manufactures would have\r\nflourished greatly; even as it was, iron and paper were manufactured in\r\nconsiderable quantities.\r\n\r\n%100. Occupations in the Southern Colonies.%--South of Pennsylvania,\r\nand especially south of the Potomac River, lay a region utterly unlike\r\nanything to the north of it. In Virginia, there were no cities, no large\r\ntowns, no centers of population. At an early day in the history of the\r\ncolony the legislature had attempted to remedy this, and had ordered\r\ntowns to be built at certain places, had made them the only ports where\r\nships from abroad could be entered, had established tobacco warehouses\r\nin them, had offered special privileges to tradesmen who would settle in\r\nthem, and had provided that each should have a market and a fair. But\r\nthe success was small, and Fredericksburg and Alexandria and Petersburg\r\nwere straggling villages. Jamestown, the old capital, had by this time\r\nceased to exist. Williamsburg, the new capital, was a village of 200\r\nhouses. There was no business, no incentive in Virginia to build towns.\r\nThe planters owned immense plantations along the river banks, and raised\r\ntobacco, which, when gathered, cured, and packed into hogsheads, was\r\nrolled away to the nearest wharf for inspection and shipment to London.\r\nIn those early days, when good roads were unknown and wagons few, shafts\r\nwere attached to each hogshead by iron bolts driven into the heads, and\r\nthe cask was thus turned into a huge roller. With each year\'s crop would\r\ngo a long list of articles of every sort,--hardware, glass, crockery,\r\nclothing, furniture, household utensils, wines,--which the agent was\r\ninstructed to buy with the proceeds of the tobacco and send back to the\r\nplanter when the ships came a year later for another crop. The country\r\nabounded in trees, yet tables, chairs, boxes, cart wheels, bowls, birch\r\nbrooms, all came from the mother country. The wood used for building\r\nhouses was actually cut, sent to England as logs to be dressed, and then\r\ntaken back to Virginia for use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tobacco rolling[1]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: From a model in the National Museum, Washington.]\r\n\r\nMaryland was in the same condition. Her people raised tobacco, and with\r\nit bought their clothing, household goods, brass and copper wares, and\r\niron utensils in Great Britain.\r\n\r\nIn South Carolina rice was the great staple, just as tobacco was the\r\nstaple of Virginia, and there too were large plantations and no towns.\r\nAll the social, commercial, legal, and political life of the colony\r\ncentered in Charleston, from which a direct trade was carried on\r\nwith London.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: %An old Maryland manor house%]\r\n\r\nLabor on the plantations of Virginia, the two Carolinas, and Georgia was\r\nperformed exclusively by negro slaves and redemptioners.\r\n\r\n%101. Civil Government in the English Colonies.%--If we arrange the\r\ncolonies according to the kind of civil government in each, we find that\r\nthey fall into three classes:\r\n\r\n1. The charter colonies (Connecticut, Massachusetts, and Rhode Island).\r\n\r\n2. The proprietary colonies (Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland).\r\n\r\n3. The royal, or provincial, colonies (New Hampshire, New York, New\r\nJersey, Virginia, North and South Carolina, and Georgia).\r\n\r\nThe charters of the first group were written contracts between the King\r\nand the colonists, defined the share each should have in the government,\r\nand were not to be changed without the consent of both parties. In\r\ncolonies of the second group some individual, called the proprietary,\r\nwas granted a great tract of land by the King, and, under a royal\r\ncharter, was given power to sell the land to settlers, establish\r\ngovernment, and appoint the governors of his colony. In the third group,\r\nthe King appointed the governors and instructed them as to the way in\r\nwhich he wished his colonies to be ruled.\r\n\r\nWith these differences, all the colonies had the same form of\r\ngovernment. In each there was a legislature elected by the people; in\r\neach the right to vote was limited to men who owned land, paid taxes,\r\nhad a certain yearly income, and were members of some Christian church.\r\nThe legislature consisted of two branches: the lower house, to which the\r\npeople elected delegates; and the upper house, or council, appointed by\r\nthe governor. These legislatures could do many things, but their powers\r\nwere limited and their acts were subject to review: 1. They could do\r\nnothing contrary to the laws of England. 2. Whatever they did could be\r\nvetoed by the governors, and no bill could be passed over the veto. 3.\r\nAll laws passed by a colonial legislature (except in the case of\r\nConnecticut, Rhode Island, and Maryland), and approved by a governor,\r\nmust even then be sent to England to be examined by the King in Council,\r\nand could be "disallowed" or vetoed by the King at any time within three\r\nyears. This power was used so constantly that the colonial legislatures,\r\nin time, would pass laws to run for two years, and when that time\r\nexpired would re\xc3\xabnact them for two years more, and so on in order to\r\navoid the veto. In this way the colonists became used to three political\r\ninstitutions which were afterwards embodied in what is now the American\r\nsystem of state and national government: 1. The written constitution\r\ndefining the powers of government. 2. The exercise of the veto power by\r\nthe governor. 3. The setting aside of laws by a judicial body from whose\r\ndecision there is no appeal.\r\n\r\n%102. The Colonial Governors.%--The governor of a royal province was\r\nthe personal representative of the King, and as such had vast power.\r\nThe legislature could meet only when he called it. He could at any\r\nmoment prorogue it (that is, command it to adjourn to a certain day) or\r\ndissolve it, and, if the King approved, he need never call it together\r\nagain. He was the chief justice of the highest colonial court, he\r\nappointed all the judges, and, as commander in chief of the militia,\r\nappointed all important officers. Yet even he was subject to some\r\ncontrol, for his salary was paid by the colony over which he ruled, and,\r\nby refusing to pay this salary, the legislature could, and over and over\r\nagain did, force him to approve acts he would not otherwise have\r\nsanctioned. In Connecticut and Rhode Island the people elected the\r\ngovernors. This right once existed also in Massachusetts; but when the\r\nold charter was swept away in 1684, and replaced by a new one in 1691,\r\nthe King was given power to appoint the governor, who could summon,\r\ndissolve, and prorogue the legislature at his pleasure.\r\n\r\n%103. Lords of Trade and Plantations.%--That the King should give\r\npersonal attention to all the details of government in his colonies in\r\nAmerica, was not to be expected. In 1696, therefore, a body called the\r\nLords of the Board of Trade and Plantations was commissioned by the King\r\nto do this work for him. These Lords of Trade corresponded with the\r\ngovernors, made recommendations, bade them carry out this or that\r\npolicy, veto this or that class of laws, examined all the laws sent over\r\nby the legislatures, and advised the King as to which should be\r\ndisallowed, or vetoed.\r\n\r\nIn the early years of our colonial history the Parliament of England had\r\nno share in the direction of colonial affairs. It was the King who owned\r\nall the land, made all the grants, gave all the charters, created all\r\nthe colonies, governed many of them, and stoutly denied the right of\r\nParliament to meddle. But when Charles I. was beheaded, the Long\r\nParliament took charge of the management of affairs in this country, and\r\nalthough much of it went back to the King at the Restoration in 1660,\r\nParliament still continued to legislate for the colonies in a few\r\nmatters. Thus, for instance, Parliament by one act established the\r\npostal service, and fixed the rates of postage; by another it regulated\r\nthe currency, and by another required the colonists to change from the\r\nOld Style to the New Style--that is, to stop using the Julian calendar\r\nand to count time in future by the Gregorian calendar; by another it\r\nestablished a uniform law of naturalization; and from time to time it\r\npassed acts for the purpose of regulating colonial trade.\r\n\r\n%104. Acts of Trade and Navigation.%--The number of these acts is\r\nvery large; but their purpose was four fold:\r\n\r\n1. They required that colonial trade should be carried on in ships built\r\nand owned in England or in the colonies, and manned to the extent of two\r\nthirds of the crew by English subjects.\r\n\r\n2. They provided a long list of colonial products that should not be\r\nsent to any foreign ports other than a port of England. Goods or\r\nproducts not in the list might be sent to any other part of the world.\r\nThus tobacco, sugar, indigo, copper, furs, rice (if the rice was for a\r\nport north of Cape Finisterre), must go to England; but lumber, salt\r\nfish, and provisions might go (in English or colonial ships) to France,\r\nor Spain, or to other foreign countries.\r\n\r\n3. When trade began to spring up between the colonies, and the New\r\nEngland merchants were competing in the colonial markets with English\r\nmerchants, an act was passed providing that if a product which went from\r\none colony to another was of a kind that might have been supplied from\r\nEngland, it must either go to the mother country and then to the\r\npurchasing colony, or pay an export duty at the port where it was\r\nshipped, equal to the import duty it would have to pay in England.\r\n\r\n4. No goods were allowed to be carried from any place in Europe to\r\nAmerica unless they were first landed at a port in England.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Edward Eggleston\'s papers in the _Century Magazine_, 1884;\r\nScudder\'s _Men and Manners One Hundred Years Ago_; Lodge\'s _English\r\nColonies_.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\n1. The men who began the long struggle for the rights of Englishmen\r\nlived in a state of society very different from ours, and were utterly\r\nignorant of most of the commonest things we use in daily life.\r\n\r\n2. Labor was performed by slaves, by criminals sent over to the colonies\r\nand sold, and by "indented servants," or "redemptioners."\r\n\r\n3. Manufactures were forbidden by the laws of trade. Nobody was\r\npermitted to manufacture iron beyond the state of pig or bar iron, or\r\nmake woolen goods for export, or make hats.\r\n\r\n4. Taking the colonies in geographical groups, the Eastern were engaged\r\nin fishing, in commerce, and in farming; the Middle Colonies were\r\nagricultural and commercial; the Southern were wholly agricultural, and\r\nraised two great, staples--rice and tobacco.\r\n\r\n5. As a consequence, town life existed in the Eastern and Middle\r\nColonies, and was little known in the South, particularly in Virginia.\r\n\r\n6. Over the colonies, as a great governing body to aid the King, were\r\nthe Lords of Trade and Plantations in London. Under them in America were\r\nthe royal and proprietary governors, who with the local colonial\r\nlegislatures managed the affairs of the colonies.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIFE IN THE COLONIES IN 1763.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Social and Industrial Condition_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPopulation.\r\nImplements and inventions unknown.\r\nThe printing press.\r\nThe postal service.\r\nTrades and occupations then unknown.\r\n\r\nLabor.}The apprentice.\r\n      }The "indented servant."\r\n      }The redemptioner.\r\n      }The slave.\r\n\r\nNo manufactures.          }Iron making\r\nActs of trade regulating. }Cloth making.\r\nThe cities.               }Hat making.\r\n\r\nTravel.\r\nThe Navigation Acts.\r\nState of agriculture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Government_.\r\n\r\nThe charter colonies.\r\nThe proprietary colonies.\r\nThe royal colonies.\r\nThe colonial governor.\r\nThe Lords of Trade and Plantations.\r\nThe King.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\n"LIBERTY, PROPERTY, AND NO STAMPS"\r\n\r\n%105. The New Provinces.%--The acquisition of Canada and the\r\nMississippi valley made it necessary for England to provide for their\r\ndefense and government. To do this she began by establishing three new\r\nprovinces.\r\n\r\nIn Canada she marked out the province of Quebec, part of the south\r\nboundary of which is now the north boundary of New York, Vermont, New\r\nHampshire, and Maine.\r\n\r\nIn the South, out of the territory given by Spain, she made two\r\nprovinces, East and West Florida. The north boundary of West Florida was\r\n(1764) a parallel of latitude through the junction of the Yazoo and\r\nMississippi rivers. The north boundary of East Florida was part of the\r\nboundary of the present state. The territory between the Altamaha and\r\nthe St. Marys rivers was "annexed to Georgia."\r\n\r\n%106. The Proclamation Line.%--By the same proclamation which\r\nestablished these provinces, a line was drawn around the head waters of\r\nall the rivers in the United States which flow into the Atlantic Ocean,\r\nand the colonists were forbidden to settle to the west of it. All the\r\nvalley from the Great Lakes to West Florida, and from the proclamation\r\nline to the Mississippi, was set apart for the Indians.\r\n\r\n%107. The Country to be defended.%--Having thus provided for the\r\ngovernment of the newly acquired territory, it next became necessary to\r\nprovide for its defense; for nobody doubted that both France and Spain\r\nwould some day attempt to regain their lost possessions. Arrangements\r\nwere therefore made to bring over an army of 10,000 regular troops,\r\nscatter them over the country from Canada to Florida, and maintain\r\nthem partly at the expense of the colonies and partly at the expense of\r\nthe crown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BRITISH COLONIES IN 1764]\r\n\r\nThe share to be paid by the colonies was to be raised\r\n\r\n1. By enforcing the old trade and navigation laws.\r\n\r\n2. By a tax on sugar and molasses brought into the country.\r\n\r\n3. By a stamp tax.\r\n\r\n%108. Trial without Jury.%--In order to enforce the old laws, naval\r\nvessels were sent to sail up and down the coast and catch smugglers.\r\nOffenders when seized were to be tried in some vice-admiralty court,\r\nwhere they could not have trial by jury.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This is one of the things complained of in the Declaration\r\nof Independence.]\r\n\r\n%109. The Sugar Act and Stamp Tax.%--The Sugar Act was not a new\r\ngrievance. In 1733 Parliament laid a tax of 6_d_. a gallon on molasses\r\nand 5_s_. per hundredweight on sugar brought into this country from any\r\nother place than the British West Indies. This was to force the\r\ncolonists to buy their sugar and molasses from nobody but British sugar\r\nplanters. After having expired five times and been five times re\xc3\xabnacted,\r\nthe Sugar Act expired for the sixth time in 1763, and the colonies\r\nbegged that it might not be renewed. But Parliament merely reduced the\r\nmolasses duty to 3_d_. and laid new duties on coffee, French and East\r\nIndian goods, indigo, white sugar, and Spanish and Portuguese wines. It\r\nthen resolved that "for further defraying the expense of protecting the\r\ncolonists it would be necessary to charge certain stamp duties in the\r\ncolonies."\r\n\r\nAt that time, 1764, no such thing as an internal tax laid by Parliament\r\nfor the purpose of raising revenue existed, or ever had existed, in\r\nAmerica. Money for the use of the King had always been raised by taxes\r\nimposed by the legislatures of the colonies. The moment, therefore, the\r\npeople heard that this money was to be raised in future by parliamentary\r\ntaxation, they became much alarmed, and the legislatures instructed\r\ntheir business agents in London to protest.\r\n\r\nThis the agents did in February, 1765. But Grenville, the Prime\r\nMinister, was not to be persuaded, and on March 22, 1765, Parliament\r\npassed the Stamp Act[1].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The exact text of the Stamp Act has been reprinted in\r\n_American History Leaflets_, No. 21. For an excellent account of the\r\ncauses and consequences of the Stamp Act, read Lecky\'s _England in the\r\nEighteenth Century_, Vol. III., Chap. 12; Frothingham\'s _Rise of the\r\nRepublic of the United States_, Chap. 5; Channing\'s _The United States\r\nof America, 1765-1865_, pp. 41-50.]\r\n\r\n%110. The Stamp Distributors.%--That the collection of the new duty\r\nmight give as little offense to the colonists as possible, Grenville\r\ndesired that the stamps and the stamped paper should be sold by\r\nAmericans, and invited the agents of the colonies to name men to be\r\n"stamp distributors" in their colonies. The law was to go into effect on\r\nthe 1st of November, 1765. After that day every piece of vellum, every\r\npiece of paper, on which was written any legal document for use in any\r\ncourt, was to be charged with a stamp duty of from three pence to ten\r\npounds sterling. After that day, every license, bond, deed, warrant,\r\nbill of lading, indenture, every pamphlet, almanac, newspaper, pack of\r\ncards, must be written or printed on stamped paper to be made in England\r\nand sold at prices fixed by law. If any dispute arose under the law, the\r\ncase might be tried in the vice-admiralty courts without a jury.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote: The stamps were not the adhesive kind we are now accustomed\r\nto fasten on letters. Those used for newspapers and pamphlets and\r\nprinted documents consisted of a crown surmounting a circle in which\r\nwere the words, "One Penny Sheet" or "Nine Pence per Quire," and were\r\nstamped on each sheet in red ink by a hand stamp not unlike those used\r\nat the present day to cancel stamps on letters. Others, used on vellum\r\nand parchment, consisted of a square piece of blue paper, glued on the\r\nparchment, and fastened by a little piece of brass. A design was then\r\nimpressed on the blue paper by means of a little machine like that used\r\nby magistrates and notaries public to impress their seals on legal\r\ndocuments. When this was done, the parchment was turned over, and a\r\nlittle piece of white paper was pasted on the back of the stamp. On this\r\nwhite piece was engraved, in black, the design shown in the second\r\npicture on p. 113, the monogram "G. R." meaning Georgius Rex, or\r\nKing George.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Stamps used in 1765]\r\n\r\nThe money raised by this tax was not to be taken to England, but was to\r\nbe spent in America for the defense of the colonies. Nevertheless, the\r\ncolonists were determined that none should be raised. The question was\r\nnot, Shall America support an army? but, Shall Parliament tax America?\r\n\r\n%111. The Virginia Resolutions.%--In opposition to this, Virginia now\r\nled the way with a set of resolutions. In the House of Burgesses, as the\r\npopular branch of her legislature was called, was Patrick Henry, the\r\ngreatest orator in the colonies. By dint of his fiery words, he forced\r\nthrough a set of resolutions setting forth\r\n\r\n1. That the first settlers in Virginia brought with them "all the\r\nprivileges and immunities that have at any time been held" by "the\r\npeople of Great Britain."\r\n\r\n2. That their descendants held these rights.\r\n\r\n3. That by two royal charters the people of Virginia had been declared\r\nentitled to all the rights of Englishmen "born within the realm\r\nof England."\r\n\r\n4. That one of these rights was that of being taxed "by their own\r\nAssembly."\r\n\r\n5. That they were not bound to obey any law taxing them without consent\r\nof their Assembly.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: These resolutions, printed in full from Henry\'s manuscript\r\ncopy, are in Channing\'s _The United States of America, 1765-1865, _pp.\r\n51, 52. They were passed May 29, 1765.]\r\n\r\nMassachusetts followed with a call for a congress to meet at New York\r\ncity.\r\n\r\n%112. Stamp-act Congress.%--To the congress thus called came\r\ndelegates from all the colonies except New Hampshire, Virginia, North\r\nCarolina, and Georgia. The session began at New York, on the 5th of\r\nOctober, 1765; and after sitting in secret for twenty days, the\r\ndelegates from six of the nine colonies present (Massachusetts, New\r\nYork, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Maryland) signed a\r\n"Declaration of Rights and Grievances." [1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This declaration is printed in full in Preston\'s _Documents\r\nIllustrative of American History_, pp. 188-191.]\r\n\r\n%113. Declaration of Rights.%--The ground taken in the declaration\r\nwas:\r\n\r\n1. That the Americans were subjects of the British crown.\r\n\r\n2. That it was the natural right of a British subject to pay no taxes\r\nunless he had a voice in laying them.\r\n\r\n3. That the Americans were not represented in Parliament.\r\n\r\n4. That Parliament, therefore, could not tax them, and that an attempt\r\nto do so was an attack on the rights of Englishmen and the liberty of\r\nself-government.\r\n\r\n%114. Grievances.%--The grievances complained of were: 1. Taxation\r\nwithout representation. 2. Trial without jury (in the vice-admiralty\r\ncourts). 3. The Sugar Act. 4. The Stamp Act. 5. Restrictions on trade.\r\n\r\n%115. The English View of Representation.%--We, in this country, do\r\nnot consider a person represented in a legislature unless he can cast a\r\nvote for a member of that legislature. In Great Britain, not individuals\r\nbut classes were represented. Thus, the clergy were represented by the\r\nbishops who sat in the House of Lords; the nobility, by the nobles who\r\nhad seats in the House of Lords; and the mass of the people, the\r\ncommons, by the members of the House of Commons. At that time, very few\r\nEnglishmen could vote for a member of the House of Commons. Great cities\r\nlike Liverpool, Leeds, Manchester, did not send even one member. When\r\nthe colonists held that they were not represented in Parliament because\r\nthey did not elect any members of that body, Englishmen answered that\r\nthey were represented, because they were commoners.\r\n\r\n%116. Sons of Liberty.%--Meantime, the colonists had not been idle.\r\nTaking the name of "Sons of Liberty," a name given to them in a speech\r\nby a member of Parliament (named Barr\xc3\xa9) friendly to their cause, they\r\nbegan to associate for resistance to the Stamp Act. At first, they were\r\ncontent to demand that the stamp distributors named by the colonial\r\nagents in London should resign. But when these officers refused, the\r\npeople became violent; and at Boston, Newark, N.J., New Haven, New\r\nLondon, Conn., at Providence, at Newport, R.I., at Dover, N.H., at\r\nAnnapolis, Md., serious riots took place. Buildings were torn down, and\r\nmore than one unhappy distributor was dragged from his home, and forced\r\nto stand before the people and shout, "Liberty, property, and\r\nno stamps."\r\n\r\n%117. November 1, 1765.%--As the 1st of November, the day on which\r\nthe Stamp Act was to go into force, approached, the newspapers appeared\r\ndecorated with death\'s-heads, black borders, coffins, and obituary\r\nnotices. The _Pennsylvania Journal_ dropped its usual heading, and in\r\nplace of it put an arch with a skull and crossbones underneath, and this\r\nmotto, "Expiring in the hopes of a resurrection to life again." In one\r\ncorner was a coffin, and the words, "The last remains of the\r\n_Pennsylvania Journal_, which departed this life the 31st of October,\r\n1765, of a stamp in her vitals. Aged 23 years." The _Pennsylvania\r\nGazette_, on November 7, the day of its first issue after the Stamp Act\r\nbecame law, published a half sheet, printed on one side, without any\r\nheading, and in its place the words, "No stamped paper to be had."\r\nDuring the next six months, every scrap of stamped paper that was heard\r\nof was hunted up and given to the flames. Thus, when a vessel from\r\nBarbados, with a stamped newspaper published on that island, reached\r\nPhiladelphia, the paper was seized and burned, one evening, at the\r\ncoffeehouse, in the presence of a great crowd. A vessel having put in\r\nfrom Halifax, a rumor spread that the captain had brought stamped paper\r\nwith him, and was going to use it for his Philadelphia clearance. This\r\nso enraged the people that the vessel was searched, and a sheet of paper\r\nwith three stamps on it was found, and burned at the coffee-house.\r\n\r\n%118. Non-importation Agreements.%--Meantime, the merchants in the\r\nlarger towns, and the people all over the country, had been making\r\nwritten agreements not to import any goods from England for some\r\nmonths to come.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this measure was immense. Not a merchant nor a\r\nmanufacturer in Great Britain, engaged in the colonial trade, but found\r\nhis American orders canceled and his goods left on his hands. Not a ship\r\nreturned from this country but carried back English wares which it had\r\nbrought here to sell, but for which no purchaser could be found.\r\n\r\n%119. Stamp Act repealed.%--When Parliament met in December, 1765,\r\nsuch a cry of distress came up from the manufacturing cities of England,\r\nthat Parliament was forced to yield, and in March, 1766, the Stamp Act\r\nwas repealed. In the outburst of joy which followed in America, the\r\nintent and meaning of another act passed at the same time was little\r\nheeded. In it was the declaration that Parliament did have the right to\r\ntax the colonies "in all cases whatsoever."\r\n\r\n%120. The Townshend Acts.%--If the people thought this declaration\r\nhad no meaning, they were much mistaken, for next year (1767) Parliament\r\npassed what have since been called the Townshend Acts. There were three\r\nof them. One forbade the legislature of New York to pass any more laws\r\ntill it had provided the royal troops in the city with beds, candles,\r\nfire, vinegar, and salt, as required by what was called the Mutiny Act.\r\nThe second established at Boston a Board of Commissioners of the Customs\r\nto enforce the laws relating to trade. The third laid taxes on glass,\r\nred and white lead, painter\'s colors, paper, and tea. None of these\r\ntaxes was heavy. But again the right of Parliament to tax people not\r\nrepresented in it had been asserted, and again the colonists rose in\r\nresistance. The legislature of Massachusetts sent a letter to each of\r\nthe other colonial legislatures, urging them to unite and consult for\r\nthe protection of their rights. Pennsylvania sent protests to the King\r\nand to Parliament. The merchants all over the country renewed their old\r\nagreements not to import British goods, and many a shipload was sent\r\nback to England.\r\n\r\n%121. Colonial Legislatures dissolved.%[1]--The letter of\r\nMassachusetts to the colonial legislatures having given great offense to\r\nthe King, the governors were ordered to see to it that the legislatures\r\ndid not approve it. But the order came too late. Many had already done\r\nso, and as a punishment the assemblies of Maryland and Georgia were\r\ndismissed and the members sent home. To dissolve assemblies became of\r\nfrequent occurrence. The legislature of Massachusetts was dissolved\r\nbecause it refused to recall the letter. That of New York was repeatedly\r\ndissolved for refusing to provide the royal troops with provisions. That\r\nof Virginia was dismissed for complaining of the treatment of New York.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: One of the charges against the King in the Declaration of\r\nIndependence.]\r\n\r\n%122. Boston Riot of 1770.%--And now the troops intended for the\r\ndefense of the colonies began to arrive. But Massachusetts, North\r\nCarolina, and South Carolina followed the example of New York, and\r\nrefused to find them quarters. For this the legislature of North\r\nCarolina was dissolved. Everywhere the presence of the soldiers gave\r\ngreat offense; but in Boston the people were less patient than\r\nelsewhere. They accused the soldiers of corrupting the morals of the\r\ntown; of desecrating the Sabbath with fife and drum; of striking\r\ncitizens who insulted them; and of using language violent, threatening,\r\nand profane. In this state of feeling, an alarm of fire called the\r\npeople into the streets on the night of March 5, 1770. The alarm was\r\nfalse, and a crowd of men and boys, having nothing to do, amused\r\nthemselves by annoying a sentinel on guard at one of the public\r\nbuildings. He called for help, and a corporal and six men were soon on\r\nthe scene. But the crowd would not give way. Forty or fifty men came\r\narmed with sticks and pressed around the soldiers, shouting, "Rascals!\r\nLobsters! Bloody-backs!" throwing snowballs and occasionally a stone,\r\ntill in the excitement of the moment a soldier fired his gun. The rest\r\nfollowed his example, and when the reports died away, five of the\r\nrioters lay on the ground dead or dying, and six more dangerously\r\nwounded.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The soldiers were tried for murder and were defended by\r\nJohn Adams and Josiah Quincy. Two were found guilty of manslaughter. The\r\nrest were acquitted. On the massacre read Frothingham\'s _Life of\r\nWarren,_ Chaps. 6, 7; Kidder\'s _The Boston Massacre_; Joseph Warren\'s\r\nOration on March 6, 1775, in _Library of American Literature_, Vol.\r\nIII., p. 256.]\r\n\r\nThis riot, this "Boston Massacre," or, as the colonists delighted to\r\ncall it, "the bloody massacre," excited and aroused the whole land,\r\nforced the government to remove the soldiers from Boston to an island in\r\nthe bay, and did more than anything else which had yet happened, to help\r\non the Revolution.\r\n\r\n%123. Tea sent to America and not received.%--While these things were\r\ntaking place in America--indeed, on the very day of the Boston riot--a\r\nmotion was made in Parliament for the repeal of all the taxes laid by\r\nthe Townshend Acts except that on tea. The tea tax of 3d. a pound,\r\npayable in the colonies, was retained in order that the right of\r\nParliament to tax America might be vindicated. But the people held fast\r\nto their agreements not to consume articles taxed by Great Britain. No\r\ntea was drunk, save such as was smuggled from Holland, and at the end of\r\nthree years\' time the East India Company had 17,000,000 pounds of tea\r\nstored in its warehouses (1773). This was because the company was not\r\npermitted to send tea out of England. It might only bring tea to London\r\nand there sell it at public sale to merchants and shippers, who exported\r\nit to America. But now when the merchants could not find anybody to buy\r\ntea in the colonies, they bought less from the company, and the tea lay\r\nstored in its warehouses. To relieve the company, and if possible tempt\r\nthe people to use the tea, the exportation tax was taken off and the\r\ncompany was given leave to export tea to America consigned to\r\ncommissioners chosen by itself. Taking off the shilling a pound export\r\ntax in England, and charging but 3d. import tax in America, made it\r\npossible for the company to sell tea cheaper than could the merchants\r\nwho smuggled it. Yet even this failed. The people forced the tea\r\ncommissioners to resign or send the tea ships back to England. In\r\nCharleston, S.C., the tea was landed and stored for three years, when it\r\nwas sold by South Carolina. In Philadelphia the people met, and having\r\nvoted that the tea should not be landed, they stopped the ship as it\r\ncame up the Delaware, and sent it back to London.\r\n\r\n%124. The Boston Tea Party.%--At Boston also the people tried to send\r\nthe tea ships to England, but the authorities would not allow them to\r\nleave, whereupon a band of young men disguised as Indians boarded the\r\nvessels, broke open the boxes, and threw the tea into the water.\r\n\r\n%125. The Five Intolerable Acts.%--When Parliament heard of these\r\nevents, it at once determined to punish Massachusetts, and in order to\r\ndo this passed five laws which were so severe that the colonists called\r\nthem the "Intolerable Acts." They are generally known as\r\n\r\n1. The Boston Port Bill, which shut the port of Boston to trade and\r\ncommerce, forbade ships to come in or go out, and moved the customhouse\r\nto Marblehead.\r\n\r\n2. The Transportation Bill, which gave the governor power to send\r\nanybody accused of murder in resisting the laws, to another colony or to\r\nEngland for trial.\r\n\r\n3. The Massachusetts Bill, which changed the old charter of\r\nMassachusetts, provided for a military governor, and forbade the people\r\nto hold public meetings for any other purpose than the election of town\r\nofficers, without permission from the governor.\r\n\r\n4. The Quartering Act, which legalized the quartering of troops on the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n5. The Quebec Act, which enlarged the province of Quebec (pp. 111, 124)\r\nto include all the territory between the Great Lakes, the Ohio River,\r\nthe Mississippi River, and Pennsylvania. This territory was claimed by\r\nMassachusetts, Connecticut, and Virginia under their "sea to sea"\r\ncharters (pp. 33, 46, 52, 156).\r\n\r\n%126. A Congress called.%--When the Virginia legislature in May,\r\n1774, heard of the passage of the Boston Port Bill, it passed a\r\nresolution that the day on which the law went into effect in Boston\r\nshould be a day of "fasting, humiliation, and prayer" in Virginia. For\r\nthis the governor at once dissolved the legislature. But the members met\r\nand instructed a committee to correspond with the other colonies on the\r\nexpediency of holding another general congress of delegates. All the\r\ncolonies approved, and New York requested Massachusetts to name the time\r\nand place of meeting. This she did, selecting Philadelphia as the place,\r\nand September 1, 1774, as the time.\r\n\r\n%127. The First Continental Congress.%--From September 5 to October\r\n26, accordingly, fifty-five delegates, representing every colony except\r\nGeorgia, held meetings in Carpenter\'s Hall at Philadelphia, and issued:\r\n\r\n1. An address to the people of the colonies.\r\n2. An address to the Canadians.\r\n3. An address to the people of Great Britain.\r\n4. An address to the King.\r\n5. A declaration of rights.\r\n\r\n%128. The Declaration of Rights.%[1]--In this declaration the rights\r\nof the colonists were asserted to be:\r\n\r\n1. Life, liberty, and property.\r\n2. To tax themselves.\r\n3. To assemble peaceably to petition for the redress of grievances.\r\n4. To enjoy the rights of Englishmen and all the rights granted by the\r\ncolonial charters.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Printed in Preston\'s _Documents_, pp. 192-198. The best\r\naccount of the coming of the Revolution is Frothingham\'s _Rise of the\r\nRepublic of the United States,_ Chaps. 5-11.]\r\n\r\nThese rights it was declared had been violated:\r\n\r\n1. By taxing the people without their consent.\r\n2. By dissolving assemblies.\r\n3. By quartering troops on the people in time of peace.\r\n4. By trying men without a jury.\r\n5. By passing the five Intolerable Acts.\r\n\r\nBefore the Congress adjourned it was ordered that another Congress\r\nshould meet on May 10, 1775, in order to take action on the result of\r\nthe petition to the King.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\n1. As soon as Great Britain acquired Canada and the eastern part of the\r\nMississippi valley from France, and Florida from Spain, she did\r\nthree things:\r\n\r\nA. She established the provinces of Quebec, East Florida, West Florida,\r\nand the Indian country.\r\n\r\nB. She drew a line round the sources of all the rivers flowing into the\r\nAtlantic from the west and northwest, and commanded the colonial\r\ngovernors to grant no land and to allow no settlements to be made west\r\nof this line.\r\n\r\nC. She decided to send a standing or permanent army to America to take\r\npossession of the new territory and defend the colonies.\r\n\r\n2. A part of the cost of keeping up this army she decided to meet by\r\ntaxing the colonists. This she had never done before.\r\n\r\n3. The chief tax was the stamp duty on paper, vellum, etc. This the\r\ncolonists refused to pay, and Parliament repealed it.\r\n\r\n4. The colonists having denied the right of Parliament to tax them, that\r\nbody determined to establish its right and passed the "Townshend Acts."\r\nBut the colonists refused to buy British goods, and Parliament repealed\r\nall the Townshend duties except that on tea.\r\n\r\n5. As the Americans would not order tea from London, the East India\r\nCompany was allowed to send it. But the people in the five cities to\r\nwhich the tea was sent destroyed it or sent it back.\r\n\r\n6. Parliament thereupon attempted to punish Massachusetts and passed the\r\nIntolerable Acts.\r\n\r\n7. These acts led to the calling and the meeting of the First\r\nContinental Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\n         /---------------------------------------------\\\r\n      France                                         Spain\r\n /----------------\\                                /-------\\\r\n  Cape Breton.

When the 10th of May, 1775, came, the colonists had ceased to\r\npetition and had begun to fight. In accordance with the Massachusetts\r\nBill, General Thomas Gage had been appointed military governor of\r\nMassachusetts. He reached Boston in May, 1774, and summoned an assembly\r\nto meet him at Salem in October. But, alarmed at the angry state of the\r\npeople, he fortified Boston Neck,--the only land approach to the city,\r\nand countermanded the meeting. The members, claiming that an assembly\r\ncould not be dismissed before it met, gave no heed to the proclamation,\r\nbut gathered at Salem and adjourned to Concord and then to Cambridge. At\r\nCambridge a Committee of Safety was chosen and given power to call out\r\nthe troops, and steps were taken to collect ammunition and military\r\nstores. A month later at another meeting, 12,000 "minute men" were\r\nordered to be enrolled. These minute men were volunteers pledged to be\r\nready for service at a minute\'s notice, and lest 12,000 should not be\r\nenough, the neighboring colonies were asked to raise the number\r\nto 20,000.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map of Country around Boston]\r\n\r\n%130. Concord and Lexington.%--Meantime the arming and drilling went\r\nactively on, and powder was procured, and magazines of provisions and\r\nmilitary stores were collected at Concord, at Worcester, at Salem, and\r\nat many other towns. Aware of this, Gage, on the night of April 18,\r\n1775, sent off 800 regulars to destroy the stores at Concord, a town\r\nsome twenty miles from Boston. Gage wished to keep this expedition\r\nsecret, but he could not. The fact that the troops were to march became\r\nknown to the patriots in Boston, who determined to warn the minute men\r\nin the neighborhood. Messengers were accordingly stationed at\r\nCharlestown and told to ride in every direction and rouse the people,\r\nthe moment they saw lights displayed from the tower of the Old North\r\nChurch in Boston. The instant the British began to march, two lights\r\nwere hung out in the tower, and the messengers sped away to do\r\ntheir work.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The ride of one of these men, that of Paul Revere, has\r\nbecome best known because of Longfellow\'s poem, _Paul Revere\'s Ride._\r\nRead it. ]\r\n\r\nThe road taken by the British lay through the little village of\r\nLexington, and there (so well had the messengers done their work), about\r\nsunrise, on the morning of the 19th, the British came suddenly on a\r\nlittle band of minute men drawn up on the green before the meeting\r\nhouse. A call to disperse was not obeyed; whereupon the British fired a\r\nvolley, killing or wounding sixteen minute men, and passed on to\r\nConcord. There they spiked three cannon, threw some cannon balls and\r\npowder into the river, destroyed some flour, set fire to the courthouse,\r\nand started back toward Boston. But "the shot heard round the world" had\r\nindeed been fired.[2] The news had spread far and wide. The minute men\r\ncame hurrying in, and from farmhouses and hedges, from haystacks, and\r\nfrom behind trees and stone fences, they poured a deadly fire on the\r\nretreating British. The retreat soon became a flight, and the flight\r\nwould have ended in capture had they not been re\xc3\xabnforced by 900 men at\r\nLexington. With the help of these they reached Charlestown Neck by\r\nsundown and entered Boston.[3] All night long minute men came in from\r\nevery quarter, so that by the morning of April 20th great crowds were\r\ngathered outside of Charlestown and at Roxbury, and shut the British\r\nin Boston.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Read R. W. Emerson\'s fine poem, _Concord Hymn._ ]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Force\'s _American Archives,_ Vol. II.; Hudson\'s _History of\r\nLexington,_ Chaps. 6, 7; Phinney\'s _Battle of Lexington;_ Shattuck\'s\r\n_History of Concord,_ Chap. 7. ]\r\n\r\nWhen the news of Concord and Lexington reached the Green Mountain Boys\r\nof Vermont, they too took up arms, and, under Ethan Allen, captured Fort\r\nTiconderoga on May 10, 1775.\r\n\r\n%131. Congress becomes a Governing Body.%--The first Continental\r\nCongress had been chosen by the colonies in 1774, to set forth the views\r\nof the people, and remonstrate against the conduct of the King and\r\nParliament. This Congress, it will be remembered, having done so, fixed\r\nMay 10, 1775, as the day whereon a second Congress should meet to\r\nconsider the results of their remonstrance. But when the day came,\r\nLexington and Concord had been fought, all New England was in arms, and\r\nCongress was asked to adopt the army gathered around Boston, and assume\r\nthe conduct of the war. Congress thus unexpectedly became a governing\r\nbody, and began to do such things as each colony could not do by itself.\r\n\r\n%132. Origin of the Continental Army.%--After a month\'s delay it did\r\nadopt the little band of patriots gathered about Boston, made it the\r\nContinental Army, and elected George Washington, then a delegate in\r\nCongress, commander in chief. He was chosen because of the military\r\nskill he had displayed in the French and Indian War, and because it was\r\nthought necessary to have a Virginian for general, Virginia being then\r\nthe most populous of the colonies.\r\n\r\nWashington accepted the trust on June 16, and set out for Boston on June\r\n21; but he had not ridden twenty miles from Philadelphia when he was met\r\nby the news of Bunker Hill.\r\n\r\n%133. Bunker Hill, June 17, 1775.%--On a narrow peninsula to the\r\nnorth of Boston, and separated from it by a sheet of water half a mile\r\nwide, was the village of Charlestown; behind it were two small hills.\r\nThe nearer of the two to Charlestown was Breeds Hill. Just beyond it was\r\nBunker Hill, and as the two overlooked Boston and the harbor where the\r\nBritish ships lay at anchor, the possession of them was of much\r\nimportance. The Americans, learning of Gage\'s intention to fortify the\r\nhills, sent a force of 1200 men, under Colonel Prescott, on the night of\r\nJune 16, to take possession of Bunker Hill. By some mistake Prescott\r\npassed Bunker Hill, reached Breeds Hill, and before dawn had thrown up a\r\nlarge earthwork. The moment daylight enabled it to be seen, the British\r\nopened fire from their ships. But the Americans worked steadily on in\r\nspite of cannon shot, and by noon had constructed a line of\r\nintrenchments extending from the earthwork down the hill toward the\r\nwater. Gage might easily have landed men and taken this intrenchment in\r\nthe rear. He instead sent Howe[1] and 2500 men over in boats from\r\nBoston, to land at the foot of the hill and charge straight up its steep\r\nside toward the Americans on its summit. The Americans were bidden not\r\nto fire till they saw the whites of the enemy\'s eyes, and obeyed. Not a\r\nshot came from their line till the British were within a few feet. Then\r\na sheet of flames ran along the breastworks, and when the smoke blew\r\naway, the British were running down the hill in confusion. With great\r\neffort the officers rallied their men and led them up the hill a second\r\ntime, to be again driven back to the landing place. This fire exhausted\r\nthe powder of the Americans, and when the British troops were brought up\r\nfor the third attack, the Americans fell back, fighting desperately with\r\ngunstocks and stones. The results of this battle were two fold. It\r\nproved to the Americans that the British regulars were not invincible,\r\nand it proved to the British that the American militia would fight.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: General William Howe had come to Boston with more British\r\ntroops not long before. In October, 1775, he was given chief command.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOSTON, CHARLESTOWN, ETC.]\r\n\r\n%134. Washington takes Command.%--Two weeks after this battle\r\nWashington reached the army, and on July 3, 1775, took command beneath\r\nan elm still standing in Cambridge. Never was an army in so sorry a\r\nplight. There was no discipline, and not much more than a third as many\r\nmen as there had been a few weeks before. But the indomitable will and\r\nsublime patience of Washington triumphed over all difficulties, and for\r\neight months he kept the British shut up in Boston, while he trained\r\nand disciplined his army, and gathered ammunition and supplies.\r\n\r\n%135. Montreal taken.%--Meanwhile Congress, fearing that Sir Guy\r\nCarleton, who was governor of Canada, would invade New York by way of\r\nLake Champlain, sent two expeditions against him. One, under Richard\r\nMontgomery, went down Lake Champlain, and captured Montreal. Another,\r\nunder Benedict Arnold, forced its way through the dense woods of Maine,\r\nand after dreadful sufferings reached Quebec. There Montgomery joined\r\nArnold, and on the night of December 31, 1775, the two armies assaulted\r\nQuebec, the most strongly fortified city in America, and actually\r\nentered it. But Montgomery was killed, Arnold was wounded, the attack\r\nfailed, and, six months later, the Americans were driven from Canada.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bunker Hill Monument]\r\n\r\n%136. The British driven from Boston, March 17, 1776.%--After eight\r\nmonths of seeming idleness, Washington, early in March, 1776, seized\r\nDorchester Heights on the south side of Boston, fortified them, and so\r\ngave Howe his choice of fighting or retreating. Fight he could not; for\r\nthe troops, remembering the dreadful day at Bunker Hill, were afraid to\r\nattack intrenched Americans. Howe thereupon evacuated Boston and sailed\r\nwith his army for Halifax, March 17, 1776. Washington felt sure that the\r\nBritish would next attack New York, so he moved his army there in April,\r\n1776, and placed it on the Brooklyn hills.\r\n\r\n%137. Independence resolved on.%--Just one year had now passed since\r\nthe memorable fights at Concord and Lexington. During this year the\r\ncolonies had been solemnly protesting that they had no thought of\r\nindependence and desired nothing so much as reconciliation with the\r\nKing. But the King meantime had done things which prevented any\r\nreconciliation:\r\n\r\n1. He had issued a proclamation declaring the Americans to be rebels.\r\n\r\n2. He had closed their ports and warned foreign nations not to trade\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\n3. He had hired 17,000 Hessians[1] with whom to subdue them.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Hessians were soldiers from Hesse and other small\r\nGerman states.]\r\n\r\nThese things made further obedience to the King impossible, and May 15,\r\n1776, Congress resolved that it was "necessary to suppress every kind of\r\nauthority under the crown," and asked the colonies to form governments\r\nof their own and so become states.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th of June, Richard Henry Lee, acting under instructions from\r\nVirginia, offered this resolution:\r\n\r\n     Resolved\r\n\r\n     That these United Colonies are, and of\r\n     right ought to be, free and independent states, that\r\n     they are absolved from all allegiance to the British\r\n     Crown, and that all political connection between them\r\n     and the State of Great Britain is, and ought to be,\r\n     totally dissolved.\r\n\r\nPrompt action in so serious a matter was not to be expected, and\r\nCongress put it off till July 1. Meanwhile Thomas Jefferson, Benjamin\r\nFranklin, John Adams, Roger Sherman, and Robert R. Livingston were\r\nappointed to write a declaration of independence and have it ready in\r\ncase it was wanted. As Jefferson happened to be the chairman of the\r\ncommittee, the duty of writing the declaration was given to him. July\r\n2, Congress passed Lee\'s resolution, and what had been the United\r\nColonies became free and independent states.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Campaigns of 1775-1776]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: %The Pennsylvania Statehouse, or Independence Hall[1]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: From the _Columbian Magazine_ of July, 1787. The tower\r\nfaces the "Statehouse yard." The posts are along Chestnut Street. For\r\nthe history of the building, read F. M. Etting\'s _Independence Hall._]\r\n\r\n%138. Independence declared.%--Independence having thus been decreed,\r\nthe next step was to announce the fact to the world. As Jefferson says\r\nin the opening of his declaration, "When, in the course of human events,\r\nit becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands\r\nwhich have connected them with another ... a decent respect to the\r\nopinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which\r\nimpel them to the separation." It was this "decent respect to the\r\nopinions of mankind," therefore, which now led Congress, on July 4,\r\n1776, to adopt the Declaration of Independence, and to send copies to\r\nthe states. Pennsylvania got her copy first, and at noon on July 8 it\r\nwas read to a vast crowd of citizens in the Statehouse yard.[1] When\r\nthe reading was finished, the people went off to pull down the royal\r\narms in the court room, while the great bell in the tower, the bell\r\nwhich had been cast twenty-four years before with the prophetic words\r\nupon its side, "Proclaim liberty throughout the land unto all the\r\ninhabitants thereof," rang out a joyful peal, for then were announced to\r\nthe world the new political truths, "that all men are created equal,"\r\nand "that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable\r\nrights," and "that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of\r\nhappiness."\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The declaration was read from a wooden platform put up\r\nthere in 1769 to enable David Rittenhouse to observe a transit\r\nof Venus.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The royal arms]\r\n\r\n%139. The Retreat up the Hudson.%--A few days later the Declaration\r\nwas read to the army at New York. The wisdom of Washington in going to\r\nNew York was soon manifest, for in July General Howe, with a British\r\narmy of 25,000 men, encamped on Staten Island. In August he crossed to\r\nLong Island, and was making ready to besiege the army on Brooklyn\r\nHeights, when, one dark and foggy night, Washington, leaving his camp\r\nfires burning, crossed with his army to New York.\r\n\r\nHowe followed, drove him foot by foot up the Hudson from New York to\r\nWhite Plains; carried Fort Washington, on the New York shore, by storm\r\n(November 16, 1776); and sent a force across the Hudson under cover of\r\ndarkness and storm to capture Fort Lee. But the British were detected in\r\nthe very nick of time, and the Americans, leaving their fires burning\r\nand their tents standing, fled towards Newark, N. J.\r\n\r\n%140. The Retreat across the Jerseys.%--Washington, meanwhile, had\r\ngone from White Plains to Hackensack in New Jersey, leaving 7000 men\r\nunder Charles Lee in New York state at North Castle. These men he now\r\nordered Lee to bring over to Hackensack, but the jealous and mutinous\r\nLee refused to obey. This forced Washington to begin his famous retreat\r\nacross the Jerseys, going first to Newark, then to New Brunswick, then\r\nto Trenton, and then over the Delaware into Pennsylvania, with the\r\nBritish under Cornwallis in hot pursuit.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n%141. The Surprise at Trenton.%--Lee crossed the Hudson and went to\r\nMorristown, where a just punishment for his disobedience speedily\r\novertook him. One night while he was at an inn outside of his lines,\r\nsome British dragoons made him a prisoner of war. The capture of Lee\r\nleft Sullivan in command, and by him the troops were hurried off to join\r\nWashington. Thus re\xc3\xabnforced, Washington turned on the enemy, and on\r\nChristmas night in a blinding snowstorm he recrossed the Delaware,\r\nmarched nine miles to Trenton, surprised a force of Hessians, took 1000\r\nprisoners, and went back to Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this victory was tremendous. At first the people could not\r\nbelieve it, and, to convince them, the Hessians had to be marched\r\nthrough the streets of Philadelphia, and one of their flags was sent to\r\nBaltimore (whither Congress had fled from Philadelphia), and hung up in\r\nthe hall of Congress. When the people were convinced of the truth of the\r\nreport, their joy was unbounded; militia was hurried forward, the\r\nJerseymen gathered at Morristown, money was raised; the New England\r\ntroops, whose time of service was out, were persuaded to stay six weeks\r\nlonger, and, December 30, 1776, Washington again entered Trenton.\r\n\r\nMeantime Cornwallis, who had heard of the capture of the Hessians, came\r\nthundering down from New Brunswick with 8000 men and hemmed in the\r\nAmericans between his army and the Delaware. But on the night of January\r\n2, 1777, Washington slipped away, passed around Cornwallis, hurried to\r\nPrinceton, and there, on the morning of January 3, put to rout three\r\nregiments of British regulars. Cornwallis, who was not aware that the\r\nAmericans had left his front till he heard the firing in his rear, fell\r\nback to New Brunswick, while Washington marched unmolested to\r\nMorristown, where he spent the rest of the winter.\r\n\r\n%142. The Capture of Philadelphia.%--Late in May, 1777, Washington\r\nentered New York state. But Howe paid little attention to this movement,\r\nfor he had fully determined to attack and capture Philadelphia, and on\r\nJuly 23 set sail from New York. As the fleet moved southward, its\r\nprogress was marked by signal fires along the Jersey coast, and the news\r\nof its position was carried inland by messengers. At the end of a week\r\nthe fleet was off the entrance of Delaware Bay. But Lord Howe fearing to\r\nsail up the river, the fleet went to sea and was lost to sight.\r\nWashington, who had hurried southward to Philadelphia, was now at a loss\r\nwhat to do, and was just about to go back to New York when he heard\r\nthat the British were coming up Chesapeake Bay, and at once marched to\r\nWilmington, Del.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt was the 25th of August that Howe landed his men and began moving\r\ntoward Washington, who, lest the British should push by him, fell back\r\nfrom Wilmington, to a place called Chadds Ford on the Brandywine, where,\r\non September 11, 1777, a battle was fought.[1] The Americans were\r\ndefeated and retreated in good order to Chester, and the next day\r\nWashington entered Philadelphia. But public opinion demanded that\r\nanother battle should be fought before the city was given up, and after\r\na few days he recrossed the Schuylkill, and again faced the enemy. A\r\nviolent storm ruined the ammunition of both armies and prevented a\r\nbattle, and the Americans retreated across the Schuylkill at a point\r\nfarther up the stream.\r\n\r\n[Footnote: 1 Among the wounded in this battle was a brilliant young\r\nFrenchman, the Marquis de Lafayette, who, early in 1777, came to America\r\nand offered his services to Congress as a volunteer without pay.]\r\n\r\nCongress, which had returned to Philadelphia from Baltimore, now fled to\r\nLancaster and later to York, Pa., and (September 26, 1777) Howe entered\r\nPhiladelphia in triumph. October 4, Washington attacked him at\r\nGermantown, but was repulsed, and went into winter quarters at\r\nValley Forge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n%143. New York invaded.%--Though Washington had been defeated in the\r\nbattles around Philadelphia, and had been forced to give that city to\r\nthe British, his campaign made it possible for the Americans to win\r\nanother glorious victory in the north. At the beginning of 1777 the\r\nBritish had planned to conquer New York and so cut the Eastern States\r\noff from the Middle States. To accomplish this, a great army under John\r\nBurgoyne was to come up to Albany by way of Lake Champlain. Another,\r\nunder Colonel St. Leger, was to go up the St. Lawrence and Lake Ontario\r\nto Oswego and come down to Mohawk valley to Albany; while the third\r\narmy, under Howe, was to go up the Hudson from New York and meet\r\nBurgoyne at Albany. True to this plan, Burgoyne came up Lake Champlain,\r\ntook Ticonderoga (July 5), and, driving General Schuyler before him,\r\nreached Fort Edward late in July. There he heard that the Americans had\r\ncollected some supplies at Bennington, a little village in the\r\nsouthwestern corner of Vermont, whither he sent 1000 men. But Colonel\r\nJohn Stark met and utterly destroyed them on August 16. Meanwhile St.\r\nLeger, as planned, had landed at Oswego, and on August 3 laid siege to\r\nFort Stanwix, which then stood on the site of the present city of Rome,\r\nN.Y. On the 6th the garrison sallied forth, attacked a part of St.\r\nLeger\'s camp, and carried off five British flags. These they hoisted\r\nupside down on their ramparts, and high above them raised a new flag\r\nwhich Congress had adopted in June, and which was then for the first\r\ntime flung to the breeze.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Flag of the East India Company]\r\n\r\n%144. Our National Flag.%--It was our national flag, the stars and\r\nstripes, and was made of a piece of a blue jacket, some strips of a\r\nwhite shirt, and some scraps of old red flannel.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The flags used by the continental troops between 1775 and\r\n1777 were of at least a dozen different patterns. A colored plate\r\nshowing most of them is given in Treble\'s _Our Flag_, p. 142. In 1776,\r\nin January, Washington used one at Cambridge which seems to have been\r\nsuggested by the ensign of the East India Company. That of this company\r\nwas a combination of thirteen horizontal red and white stripes (seven\r\nred and six white) and the red cross of St. George. That of Washington\r\nwas the same, with the British Union Jack substituted for the cross of\r\nSt. George. After the Declaration of Independence, the British Jack was\r\nout of place on our flag; and in June, 1777, Congress adopted a union of\r\nthirteen white stars in a circle, on a blue ground, in place of the\r\nBritish Union. After Vermont and Kentucky were admitted, in 1791 and\r\n1792, the stars and stripes were each increased to fifteen. In 1818, the\r\noriginal number of stripes was restored, and since that time each new\r\nstate, when admitted, is represented by a star and not by a stripe.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Flag of the United Colonies]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: British Union Jack]\r\n\r\n%145. Capture of Burgoyne.%--When Schuyler heard of the siege of\r\nFort Stanwix, he sent Benedict Arnold to relieve it, and St. Leger fled\r\nto Oswego. Then was the time for the expedition from New York to have\r\nhurried to Burgoyne\'s aid. But Howe and his army were then at sea. No\r\nhelp was given to Burgoyne, who, after suffering defeats at Bemis\r\nHeights (September 19) and at Stillwater (October 7), retreated to\r\nSaratoga, where (October 17, 1777) he surrendered his army of 6000 men\r\nto General Horatio Gates, whom Congress, to its shame, had just put in\r\nthe place of Schuyler. Gates deserves no credit for the capture. Arnold\r\nand Daniel Morgan deserve it, and deserve much; for, judged by its\r\nresults, Saratoga was one of the great battles of the world. The results\r\nof the surrender were four fold:\r\n\r\n1. It saved New York state.\r\n2. It destroyed the plan for the war.\r\n3. It induced the King to offer us peace with representation in\r\nParliament, or anything else we wanted except independence.\r\n4. It secured for us the aid of France.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: %Flag of the United States, 1777%]\r\n\r\n%146. Valley Forge.%--The winter at Valley Forge marks the darkest\r\nperiod of the war. It was a season of discouragement, when mean spirits\r\ngrew bold. Some officers of the army formed a plot, called from one of\r\nthem the "Conway cabal," to displace Washington and put Gates in\r\ncommand. The country people, tempted by British gold, sent their\r\nprovisions into Philadelphia and not to Valley Forge. There the\r\nsuffering of the half-clad, half-fed, ill-housed patriots surpasses\r\ndescription.\r\n\r\nBut the darkest hour is just before the dawn. Then it was that an able\r\nPrussian soldier, Baron Steuben, joined the army, turned the camp into a\r\nschool, drilled the soldiers, and made the army better than ever. Then\r\nit was that France acknowledged our independence, and joined us in\r\nthe war.\r\n\r\n%147. France acknowledges our Independence.%--In October, 1776,\r\nCongress sent Benjamin Franklin to Paris to try to persuade the French\r\nKing to help us in the war. Till Burgoyne surrendered and Great Britain\r\noffered peace, Franklin found all his efforts vain.[1] But now, when it\r\nseemed likely that the states might again be brought under the British\r\ncrown, the French King promptly acknowledged us to be an independent\r\nnation, made a treaty of alliance and a treaty of commerce (February 6,\r\n1778), and soon had a fleet on its way to help us.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: For an account of Franklin in France, see McMaster\'s _With\r\nthe Fathers_, pp. 253-270.]\r\n\r\n%148. The British leave Philadelphia.%--Hearing of the approach of\r\nthe French fleet, Sir Henry Clinton, who in May had succeeded Howe in\r\ncommand, left Philadelphia and hurried to the defense of New York.\r\nWashington followed, and, coming up with the rear guard of the enemy at\r\nMonmouth in New Jersey, fought a battle (June 28, 1778), and would have\r\ngained a great victory had not the traitor, Charles Lee, been in\r\ncommand.[2] Without any reason he suddenly ordered a retreat, which was\r\nfortunately prevented from becoming a rout by Washington, who came on\r\nthe field in time to stop it.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: After remaining a prisoner in the hands of the British from\r\nDecember, 1776, to April, 1778, Lee had been exchanged for a\r\nBritish officer.]\r\n\r\nAfter the battle the British hurried on to New York, where Washington\r\npartially surrounded them by stretching out his army from Morristown in\r\nNew Jersey to West Point on the Hudson.\r\n\r\n%149. Stony Point.%--In hope of drawing Washington away from New\r\nYork, Clinton in 1779 sent a marauding party to plunder and ravage the\r\nfarms and towns of Connecticut. But Washington soon brought it back by\r\ndispatching Anthony Wayne to capture Stony Point, which he did (July,\r\n1779) by one of the most brilliant assaults in military history.\r\n\r\n%150. Indian Raids.%--That nothing might be wanting to make the\r\nsuffering of the patriots as severe as possible, the Indians were let\r\nloose. Led by a Tory[1] named Butler, a band of whites and Indians of\r\nthe Seneca tribe of the Six Nations[2] marched from Fort Niagara to\r\nWyoming Valley in northeastern Pennsylvania, and there perpetrated one\r\nof the most awful massacres in history. Another party, led by a son of\r\nButler, repeated the horrors of Wyoming in Cherry Valley, N.Y.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Not all the colonists desired independence. Those who\r\nremained loyal to the King were called Tories.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: By this time the Five Nations had admitted the Tuscaroras\r\nto their confederacy and had thus become the Six Nations.]\r\n\r\n%151. George Rogers Clark%.--Meantime the British commander at\r\nDetroit tried hard to stir up the Indians of the West to attack the\r\nwhole frontier at the same moment. Hearing of this, George Rogers Clark\r\nof Virginia marched into the enemy\'s country, and in two fine campaigns\r\nin 1778-1779 beat the British, and conquered the country from the Ohio\r\nto the Great Lakes and from Pennsylvania to the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n%152. Sullivan\'s Expedition%.--In 1779 it seemed so important to\r\npunish the Indians for the Wyoming and Cherry Valley massacres that\r\nGeneral Sullivan with an army invaded the territory of the Six Nations,\r\nin central New York, burned some forty Indian villages, and utterly\r\ndestroyed the Indian power in that state.\r\n\r\n%153. The South invaded%.--For a year and more there had been a lull\r\nin military operations on the part of the British. But they now began an\r\nattack in a new quarter. Having failed to conquer New England in\r\n1775-1776, having failed to conquer the Middle States in 1776-1777, they\r\nsent an expedition against the South in December, 1778. Success attended\r\nit. Savannah was captured, Georgia was conquered, and the royal governor\r\nreinstated. Later, in 1779, General Lincoln, with a French fleet to help\r\nhim, attempted to recapture Savannah, but was driven off with dreadful\r\nloss of life.\r\n\r\nThese successes in Georgia so greatly encouraged the British that in the\r\nspring of 1780 Clinton led an expedition against South Carolina, and\r\n(May 12) easily captured Charleston, with Lincoln and his army. By dint\r\nof great exertions another army was quickly raised in North Carolina,\r\nand the command given to Gates by Congress. He was utterly unfit for it,\r\nand (August 16, 1780) was defeated and his army almost destroyed at\r\nCamden by Lord Cornwallis. Never in the whole course of the war had the\r\nAmerican army suffered such a crushing defeat. All military resistance\r\nin South Carolina was at an end, save such as was offered by gallant\r\nbands of patriots led by Marion, Sumter, and Pickens.\r\n\r\n%154. The Treason of Arnold.%--The outlook was now dark enough;\r\nbut it was made darker still by the treachery of Benedict Arnold. No\r\nofficer in the Revolutionary army was more trusted. His splendid march\r\nthrough the wilderness to Quebec, his bravery in the attack on that\r\ncity, the skill and courage he displayed at Saratoga, had marked him\r\nout as a man full of promise. But he lacked that moral courage without\r\nwhich great abilities count for nothing. In 1778 he was put in command\r\nof Philadelphia, and while there so abused his office that he was\r\nsentenced to be reprimanded by Washington. This aroused a thirst for\r\nrevenge, and led him to form a scheme to give up the Hudson River to the\r\nenemy. With this end in view, he asked Washington in July, 1780, for the\r\ncommand of West Point, the great stronghold on the Hudson, obtained it,\r\nand at once made arrangements to surrender it to Clinton. The British\r\nagent in the negotiation was Major John Andr\xc3\xa9, who one day in September\r\nmet Arnold near Stony Point. But most happily, as he was going back to\r\nNew York, three Americans[1] stopped him near Tarrytown, searched him,\r\nand in his stockings found some papers in the handwriting of Arnold.\r\nNews of the arrest of Andr\xc3\xa9 reached Arnold in time to enable him to\r\nescape to the British; he served with them till the end of the war, and\r\nthen sought a refuge in England. Andr\xc3\xa9 was tried as a spy, found guilty,\r\nand hanged.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The names of these men were Paulding, Williams, and Van\r\nWart.]\r\n\r\n%155. Victory at Kings Mountain.%--After the defeat of Gates at\r\nCamden, the British overran South Carolina, and in the course of their\r\nmarauding a band of 1100 Tories marched to Kings Mountain, on the border\r\nline between the two Carolinas. There the hardy mountaineers attacked\r\nthem (Oct. 7, 1780) and killed, wounded, or captured the entire band.\r\n\r\n[Map: %CAMPAIGNS IN THE SOUTH 1778-1781%]\r\n\r\n%156. Victory at the Cowpens%.--Meantime a third army was raised for\r\nuse in the South and placed under the command of Nathanael Greene, than\r\nwhom there was no abler general in the American army. With Greene was\r\nDaniel Morgan, who had distinguished himself at Saratoga, and by him a\r\nBritish force under Tarleton was attacked January 17, 1781, at a place\r\ncalled the Cowpens, and not only defeated, but almost destroyed.\r\n\r\nEnraged at these reverses, Cornwallis took the field and hurried to\r\nattack Greene, who, too weak to fight him, began a masterly retreat of\r\n200 miles across Carolina to Guilford Courthouse, where he turned about\r\nand fought. He was defeated, but Cornwallis was unable to go further,\r\nand retreated to Wilmington, N.C., with Greene in hot pursuit. Leaving\r\nthe enemy at Wilmington, Greene went back to South Carolina, and by\r\nSeptember, 1781, had driven the British into Charleston and Savannah.\r\n\r\nCornwallis, as soon as Greene left him, hurried to Petersburg, Va. A\r\nBritish force during the winter and spring had been plundering and\r\nravaging in Virginia, under the traitor Arnold. Cornwallis took command\r\nof this, sent Arnold to New York, and had begun a campaign against\r\nLafayette, when orders reached him to seize and fortify some\r\nVirginian seaport.\r\n\r\n%157. Surrender of Cornwallis.%--Thus instructed, Cornwallis selected\r\nYorktown, and began to fortify it strongly. This was early in August,\r\n1781. On the 14th Washington heard with delight that a French fleet was\r\non its way to the Chesapeake, and at once decided to hurry to Virginia,\r\nand surround Cornwallis by land while the French cut him off by sea.\r\nPreparations were made with such secrecy and haste that Washington had\r\nreached Philadelphia while Clinton supposed he was about to attack New\r\nYork. Clinton then sent Arnold on a raid into Connecticut to burn New\r\nLondon, in the hope of forcing Washington to return. But Washington kept\r\nstraight on, hemmed Cornwallis in by land and sea, and October 19, 1781,\r\nforced the British general to surrender.\r\n\r\n%158. The War on the Sea.%--The first step towards the foundation of\r\nan American navy was taken on October 13, 1775. Congress, hearing that\r\ntwo British ships laden with powder and guns were on their way from\r\nEngland to Quebec, ordered two swift sailing vessels to be fitted out\r\nfor the purpose of capturing them. Two months later Congress ordered\r\nthirteen cruisers to be built, and named the officers to command them.\r\n\r\nMeantime some merchant ships were purchased and collected at\r\nPhiladelphia, from which city, one morning in January, 1776, a fleet of\r\neight vessels set sail. As they were about to weigh anchor, John Paul\r\nJones, a lieutenant on the flagship, flung to the breeze a yellow silk\r\nflag on which were a pine tree and a coiled rattlesnake, with this\r\nmotto: "Don\'t tread on me." This was the first flag ever hoisted on an\r\nAmerican man-of-war.\r\n\r\nIce in the Delaware kept the fleet in the river till the middle of\r\nFebruary, when it went to sea, sailed southward to New Providence in the\r\nBahamas, captured the town, brought off the governor, some powder and\r\ncannon, and after taking several prizes got safely back to New London.\r\n\r\nSoon after the squadron had left the Delaware, the _Lexington_, Captain\r\nJohn Barry in command, while cruising off the Virginia coast, fell in\r\nwith the _Edward_, a British vessel, and after a spirited action\r\ncaptured her. This was the first prize brought in by a commissioned\r\nofficer of the American navy.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: John Barry was a native of Ireland; he came to America at\r\nthirteen, entered the merchant marine, and at twenty-five was captain of\r\na ship. At the opening of the war Barry offered his services to\r\nCongress, and in February, 1776, was put in command of the _Lexington_.\r\nAfter his victory he was transferred to the twenty-eight-gun frigate\r\n_Effingham_, and in 1777 (while blockaded in the Delaware) with\r\ntwenty-seven men in four boats captured and destroyed a ten-gun schooner\r\nand four transports. When the British captured Philadelphia, Barry took\r\nthe _Effingham_ up the river; but she was burned by the enemy. In 1778,\r\nin command of the thirty-two-gun frigate _Raleigh_, he sailed from\r\nBoston, fell in with two British frigates, and after a fight was forced\r\nto run ashore in Penobscot Bay. Barry and his crew escaped, and in 1781\r\ncarried Laurens to France in the frigate _Alliance_. On the way out he\r\ntook a privateer, and while cruising on the way home captured the\r\n_Atalanta_ and the _Trepassey_ after a hard fight. As Barry brought in\r\nthe first capture by a commissioned officer of the United States navy,\r\nso he fought the last action of the war in 1782; but the enemy escaped.\r\nWhen the navy was reorganized in 1794, Barry was made senior captain,\r\nwith the title of Commodore. In 1798 he commanded the frigate _United\r\nStates_ in the war with France. He died in 1803.]\r\n\r\nIn March, 1776, Congress began to issue letters of marque, or licenses\r\nto citizens to engage in war against the enemy; and then the sea fairly\r\nswarmed with privateers.\r\n\r\nIn 1777 the American flag was seen for the first time in European\r\nwaters, when a little squadron of three ships set sail from Nantes in\r\nFrance, and after cruising on the Bay of Biscay went twice around\r\nIreland and came back to France with fifteen prizes. As France had not\r\nthen acknowledged our independence, they were ordered to depart. Two did\r\nso; but one of them, the _Lexington_, was captured by the British, and\r\nthe other, the _Reprisal_, was wrecked at sea.\r\n\r\n%159. Paul Jones.%--Meanwhile our commissioners in France, Benjamin\r\nFranklin and Silas Deane, fitted out a cruiser called the _Surprise_.\r\nShe sailed from Dunkirk on May 1, 1777, and the next week was back with\r\na British packet as a prize. For this violation of French neutrality she\r\nwas seized. But another ship, the _Revenge_, was quickly secured, which\r\nscoured the British waters, and actually entered two British ports\r\nbefore she sailed for America. The exploits of these and a score of\r\nother ships are cast into the shade, however, by the fights of John Paul\r\nJones, the great naval hero of the Revolution. He sailed from\r\nPortsmouth, N.H., November 1, 1777, refitted his ship in the harbor of\r\nBrest, and in 1778 began one of the most memorable cruises in our naval\r\nhistory. In the short space of twenty-eight days he sailed into the\r\nIrish Channel, destroyed four vessels, set fire to the shipping in the\r\nport of Whitehaven, fought and captured the British armed schooner\r\n_Drake_, sailed around Ireland with his prize, and reached France\r\nin safety.\r\n\r\nFor a year he was forced to be idle. But at last, in 1779, he was given\r\ncommand of a squadron of five vessels, and in August sailed from France.\r\nPassing along the west coast of Ireland, the fleet went around the north\r\nend of Scotland and down the east coast, capturing and destroying vessel\r\nafter vessel on the way. On the night of September 23, 1779, Jones (in\r\nhis ship, named _Bonhomme Richard_ in honor of Franklin\'s famous _Poor\r\nRichard\'s Almanac_) fell in with the _Serapis_, a British frigate. The\r\ntwo ships grappled, and, lashed side by side in the moonlight, fought\r\none of the most desperate battles in naval annals. At the end of three\r\nhours the _Serapis_ surrendered, but the _Bonhomme Richard_ was a wreck,\r\nand next morning, giving a sudden roll, she filled and plunged bow first\r\nto the bottom of the North Sea. Jones sailed away in the _Serapis_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Benjamin Franklin]\r\n\r\nIn the Revolution the British lost 102 vessels of war, while the\r\nAmericans lost 24--most of their navy.\r\n\r\n%160. Revolutionary Heroes.%--It is not possible to mention all the\r\nrevolutionary heroes entitled to our grateful remembrance. We should,\r\nhowever, remember Lafayette, Steuben, Pulaski, and DeKalb, foreigners\r\nwho fought for us; Samuel Adams and James Otis of Massachusetts, and\r\nPatrick Henry of Virginia, who spoke for freedom; Robert Morris, the\r\nfinancier of the Revolution; Putnam who fought and Warren who died at\r\nBunker Hill; Mercer who fell at Princeton; Nathan Hale, the martyr spy;\r\nHerkimer, Knox, Moultrie, and that long list of noble patriots whose\r\nnames have already been mentioned.\r\n\r\n%161. The Treaty of Peace.%--The story is told that when Lord North,\r\nthe Prime Minister of England, heard of the surrender of Yorktown, he\r\nthrew up his hands and said, "It is all over." He was right; it was all\r\nover, and on September 3, 1783, a treaty of peace (negotiated by\r\nBenjamin Franklin, John Adams, and John Jay) was signed at Paris.\r\n\r\nMeantime the British, in accordance with a preliminary treaty of peace\r\nsigned in November, 1782, were slowly leaving the country, till on\r\nNovember 25, 1783, the last of them sailed from New York.[1] Washington\r\nnow resigned his commission, and in December went home to Mt. Vernon.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: They did not leave Staten Island in New York Bay till a\r\nweek later. For an account of the evacuation of New York see McMaster\'s\r\n_With the Fathers_, pp. 271-280.]\r\n\r\n%162. Bounds of the United States.%--By the treaty of 1783 the\r\nboundary of the United States was declared to be about what is the\r\npresent northern boundary from the mouth of the St. Croix River in Maine\r\nto the Lake of the Woods, and then due west to the Mississippi (which\r\nwas, of course, an impossible line, for that river does not rise in\r\nCanada); then down the Mississippi to 31\xc2\xb0 north latitude; then eastward\r\nalong that parallel of latitude to the Apalachicola River, and then by\r\nwhat is the present north boundary of Florida to the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nBut these bounds were not secured without a diplomatic struggle. As soon\r\nas France joined us in 1778, she began to persuade Spain to follow her\r\nexample. Very little persuasion was needed, for the opportunity to\r\nregain the two Floridas (which Spain had been forced to give to England\r\nin 1763) was too good to be lost. In June, 1779, therefore, Spain\r\ndeclared war on England, and sent the governor of Lower Louisiana into\r\nWest Florida, where he captured Pensacola, Mobile, Baton Rouge, and\r\nNatchez. Made bold by this success, Spain, which cared nothing for the\r\nUnited States, next determined to conquer the region north of Florida\r\nand east of the Mississippi, the Indian country of the proclamation of\r\n1763. (See map of The British Colonies in 1764.) The commandant at St.\r\nLouis[2] was, therefore, sent to seize the post at St. Joseph on Lake\r\nMichigan, built by La Salle in 1679. He succeeded, and taking possession\r\nof the country in the name of Spain, carried off the English flags as\r\nevidence of conquest. Now when the time came to make the treaty of\r\npeace, Spain insisted that she must have East and West Florida and the\r\ncountry west of the Alleghany Mountains, because she had conquered it.\r\nFrance partly supported Spain in this demand. The country north of the\r\nOhio she proposed should be given to Great Britain, and the country\r\nsouth to Spain and the United States.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: It will be remembered that Spain now held Louisiana, or the\r\ncountry west of the Mississippi. (See Chapter VIII.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RESULTS OF THE %WAR FOR INDEPENDENCE% BOUNDARY DEFINED\r\nBY TREATY 1783. AND TERRITORY HELD BY GREAT BRITAIN 1783-1796., AND\r\nSPAIN 1783-1795]\r\n\r\nThe American commissioners, seeing in all this a desire to bound the\r\nUnited States on the west by the Alleghany Mountains, made the treaty\r\nwith Great Britain secretly, and secured the Mississippi as our\r\nwestern limit.\r\n\r\nSpain at the same time secured the Floridas from Great Britain, and\r\ninsisting that West Florida must have the old boundary given in 1764,[1]\r\nand not 31\xc2\xb0 as provided in our treaty of peace, she seized and held the\r\ncountry by force of arms; and for twelve years the Spanish flag waved\r\nover Baton Rouge and Natchez.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Chapter X.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Read Hinsdale\'s _Old Northwest_, pp. 170-191; McMaster\'s\r\n_With the Fathers_, pp. 280-292.]\r\n\r\nThe area of the territory thus acquired by the United States was 827,844\r\nsquare miles, and the population not far from 3,250,000. Apparently an\r\nera of great prosperity and happiness was before the people. But\r\nunhappily the government they had established in time of war was quite\r\nunfit to unite them and bring them prosperity in time of peace.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Washington\'s sword]\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\n1. In accordance with one of the Intolerable Acts, General Gage became\r\ngovernor of Massachusetts in 1774.\r\n\r\n2. Seeing that the people were gathering stores and cannon, he attempted\r\nto destroy the stores, and so brought on the battles of Lexington and\r\nConcord, which opened the War for Independence.\r\n\r\n3. The Congress of colonial delegates, which met in 1774 and adjourned\r\nto meet again in 1775, assembled soon after these battles, and assumed\r\nthe conduct of the war, adopted the army around Boston, and made\r\nWashington commander in chief.\r\n\r\n4. Washington reached Boston soon after the battle of Bunker Hill, which\r\ntaught the British that the Americans would fight, and he besieged the\r\nBritish in Boston. In March, 1776, they left the city by water, and\r\nWashington moved his army to the neighborhood of New York.\r\n\r\n5. There he was attacked by the British, and was driven up the Hudson\r\nRiver to White Plains. Thence he crossed into New Jersey, only to be\r\ndriven across the state and into Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\n6. On Christmas night, 1776, he recrossed the Delaware to Trenton, and\r\nthe next morning won a victory over the Hessians. Then on January 3,\r\n1777, he fought the battle of Princeton, and he spent the remainder of\r\nthe winter at Morristown.\r\n\r\n7. In July, 1777, Howe sailed from New York for Philadelphia, to which\r\ncity Washington hurried by land. The Americans were defeated at the\r\nBrandy wine, and the city fell into the hands of Howe. Washington passed\r\nthe winter of 1777-1778 at Valley Forge.\r\n\r\n8. Meantime an attempt had been made to cut the states in two by getting\r\npossession of New York state from Lake Champlain to New York city, and\r\nan army under Burgoyne came down from Canada. He and his troops were\r\ncaptured at Saratoga.\r\n\r\n9. In February, 1778, France made a treaty of alliance with us and sent\r\nover a fleet. Fearing this would attack New York, Clinton left\r\nPhiladelphia with his army. Washington followed from Valley Forge,\r\novertook the enemy at Monmouth, and fought a battle there. The British\r\nthen went on to New York, while Washington stretched out his army from\r\nMorristown to West Point.\r\n\r\n10. So matters remained till December, 1778, when the British attacked\r\nthe Southern States. They conquered Georgia in the winter of 1778-1779.\r\n\r\n11. In the spring of 1780 they attacked South Carolina and captured\r\nGeneral Lincoln. Gates then took the field, was defeated, and succeeded\r\nby Greene, who after many vicissitudes drove the British forces in South\r\nCarolina and Georgia into Charleston and Savannah, during 1781.\r\n\r\n12. Meantime a force sent against Greene under Cornwallis undertook to\r\nfortify Yorktown and hold it, and while so engaged was surrounded by\r\nWashington and the French fleet and forced to surrender.\r\n\r\nTHE WAR FOR INDEPENDENCE\r\n\r\nCAMPAIGNS OF 1775-1776\r\n\r\n_In New England_.\r\n\r\n1775.

How the Colonies became States.%--When the Continental Congress\r\nmet at Philadelphia on May 10, 1775, a letter was received from\r\nMassachusetts, where the people had penned up the governor in Boston and\r\nhad taken the government into their own hands, asking what they should\r\ndo. Congress replied that no obedience was due to the Massachusetts\r\nRegulating Act or to the governor, and advised the people to make a\r\ntemporary government to last till the King should restore the old\r\ncharter. Similar advice was given the same year to New Hampshire and\r\nSouth Carolina, for it was not then supposed that the quarrel with the\r\nmother country would end in separation. But by the spring of 1776 all\r\nthe governors of the thirteen colonies had either fled or been thrown\r\ninto prison. This put an end to colonial government, and Congress,\r\nseeing that reconciliation was impossible, (May 15, 1776) advised all\r\nthe colonies to form governments for themselves (p. 132). Thereupon they\r\nadopted constitutions, and by doing so turned themselves from British\r\ncolonies into sovereign and independent states.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: All but two made new constitutions; but Connecticut and\r\nRhode Island used their old charters, the one till 1818, the other till\r\n1842. Vermont also formed a constitution, but she was not admitted to\r\nthe Congress (p. 243).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE UNITED STATES WHEN PEACE WAS DECLARED in 1783 SHOWING\r\nTHE STATE CLAIMS]\r\n\r\n%164. Articles of Confederation.%--While the colonies were thus\r\ngradually turning themselves into the states, the Continental\r\nCongress was trying to bind them into a union by means of a sort of\r\ngeneral constitution called "Articles of Confederation." By order of\r\nCongress, Articles had been prepared and presented by a committee in\r\nJuly, 1776, but it was not till November 17, 1777, that they were sent\r\nout to the states for adoption. Now it must be remembered that six\r\nstates, Massachusetts, Connecticut, Virginia, North Carolina, South\r\nCarolina, and Georgia, claimed that their "from sea to sea" charters\r\ngave them lands between the mountains and the Mississippi River, and\r\nthat one, New York, had bought the Indian title to land in the Ohio\r\nvalley. It must also be remembered that the other six states did not\r\nhave "from sea to sea" charters, and so had no claims to western lands.\r\nAs three of them, New Jersey, Delaware, and Maryland, held that the\r\nclaims of their sister states were invalid, they now refused to adopt\r\nthe Articles unless the land so claimed was given to Congress to be used\r\nto pay for the cost of the Revolution. For this action they gave\r\nfour reasons:\r\n\r\n1. The Mississippi valley had been discovered, explored, settled, and\r\nowned by France.\r\n\r\n2. England had never owned any land there till France ceded the country\r\nin 1763.\r\n\r\n3. When at last England had got it, in 1763, the King drew the\r\n"proclamation line," turned the Mississippi valley into the Indian\r\ncountry, and so cut off any claim of the colonies in consequence of\r\nEnglish ownership.\r\n\r\n4. The western lands were therefore the property of the King, and now\r\nthat the states were in arms against him, his lands ought to be seized\r\nby Congress and used for the benefit of all the states.\r\n\r\nFor three years the land-claiming states refused to be convinced by\r\nthese arguments. But at length, finding that Maryland was determined not\r\nto adopt the Articles till her demands were complied with, they began to\r\nyield. In February, 1780, New York ceded her claims to Congress, and in\r\nJanuary, 1781, Virginia gave up her claim to the country north of the\r\nOhio River. Maryland had now carried her point, and on March 1, 1781,\r\nher delegates signed the Articles of Confederation. As all the other\r\nstates had ratified the Articles, this act on the part of Maryland made\r\nthem law, and March 2, 1781, Congress met for the first time under a\r\nform of government the states were pledged to obey.\r\n\r\n%165. Government under the Articles of Confederation.%--The form of\r\ngovernment that went into effect on that day was bad from beginning to\r\nend. There was no one officer to carry out the laws, no court or judge\r\nto settle disputed points of law, and only a very feeble legislature.\r\nCongress consisted of one house, presided over by a president elected\r\neach year by the members from among their own number. The delegates to\r\nCongress could not be more than seven, nor less than two from each\r\nstate, were elected yearly, could not serve for more than three years\r\nout of six, and might be recalled at any time by the states that sent\r\nthem. Once assembled on the floor of Congress, the delegates became\r\nmembers of a secret body. The doors were shut; no spectators were\r\nallowed to hear what was said; no reports of the debates were taken\r\ndown; but under a strict injunction to secrecy the members went on\r\ndeliberating day after day. All voting was done by states, each casting\r\nbut one vote, no matter how many delegates it had. The affirmative votes\r\nof nine states were necessary to pass any important act, or, as it was\r\ncalled, "ordinance."\r\n\r\nTo this body the Articles gave but few powers. Congress could declare\r\nwar, make peace, issue money, keep up an army and a navy, contract\r\ndebts, enter into treaties of commerce, and settle disputes between\r\nstates. But it could not enforce a treaty or a law when made, nor lay\r\nany tax for any purpose.\r\n\r\n%166. Origin of the Public Domain%.--In 1784 Massachusetts ceded her\r\nstrip of land in the west, following the example set by New York (1780),\r\nand Virginia (1781).\r\n\r\nAs three states claiming western territory had thus by 1784 given their\r\nland to Congress, that body came into possession of the greater part of\r\nthe vast domain stretching from the Lakes to the Ohio and from the\r\nMississippi to Pennsylvania.[1] Now this public domain, as it was\r\ncalled, was given on certain conditions:\r\n\r\n1. That it should be cut up into states.\r\n\r\n2. That these states should be admitted into the Union (when they had a\r\ncertain population) on the same footing as the thirteen original states.\r\n\r\n3. That the land should be sold and the money used to pay the debts of\r\nthe United States.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The strip owned by Connecticut had been offered to Congress\r\nin October, 1789, but not accepted. It still belonged to Connecticut in\r\n1785. In 1786 it was again ceded, with certain reservations, and\r\naccepted.]\r\n\r\nCongress, therefore, as soon as it had received the deeds to the tracts\r\nceded, trusting that the other land-owning states would cede their\r\nwestern territory in time, passed a law (in 1785) to prepare the land\r\nfor sale by surveying it and marking it out into sections, townships,\r\nand ranges, and fixed the price per acre.\r\n\r\n%167. Virginia and Connecticut Reserves.%--When Virginia made her\r\ncession in 1781, she expressly reserved two tracts of land north of the\r\nOhio. One, called the Military Lands, lay between the Scioto and Miami\r\nrivers, and was held to pay bounties promised to the Virginia\r\nRevolutionary soldiers. The other (in the present state of Indiana) was\r\ngiven to General George Rogers Clark and his soldiers. A third piece was\r\nreserved by Connecticut when she ceded her strip in 1786. This, called\r\nthe Western Reserve of Connecticut, stretched along the shore of Lake\r\nErie (map, p. 175). In 1800 Connecticut gave up her jurisdiction, or\r\nright of government, over this reserve in return for the confirmation of\r\nland titles she had granted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TERRITORY OF THE %UNITED STATES% NORTHWEST OF THE OHIO\r\nRIVER %1787%]\r\n\r\n%168. Ordinance of 1787; Origin of the Territories.%--Hardly had\r\nCongress provided for the sale of the land, when a number of\r\nRevolutionary soldiers formed the Ohio Land Company, and sent an agent\r\nto New York, where Congress was in session, and offered to buy 5,000,000\r\nacres on the Ohio River: 1,500,000 acres were for themselves, and\r\n3,500,000 for another company called the Scioto Company. The land was\r\ngladly sold, and as the purchasers were really going to send out\r\nsettlers, it became necessary to establish some kind of government for\r\nthem. On the 13th of July, 1787, therefore, Congress passed another very\r\nfamous law, called the Ordinance of 1787, which ordered:\r\n\r\n1. That the whole region from the Lakes to the Ohio, and from\r\nPennsylvania to the Mississippi, should be called "The Territory of the\r\nUnited States northwest of the river Ohio."\r\n\r\n2. That it should be cut up into not less than three nor more than five\r\nstates, each of which might be admitted into the Union when it had\r\n60,000 free inhabitants.\r\n\r\n3. That within it there was to be neither slavery nor involuntary\r\nservitude except in punishment for crime.\r\n\r\n4. That until such time as there were 5000 free male inhabitants\r\ntwenty-one years old in the territory, it was to be governed by a\r\ngovernor and three judges. They could not make laws, but might adopt\r\nsuch as they pleased from among the laws in force in the states. After\r\nthere were 5000 free male inhabitants in the territory the people were\r\nto elect a house of representatives, which in its turn was to elect ten\r\nmen from whom Congress was to select five to form a council. The house\r\nand the council were then to elect a territorial delegate to sit in\r\nCongress with the right of debating, not of voting. The governor, the\r\njudges, and the secretary were to be elected by Congress. The council\r\nand house of representatives could make laws, but must send them to\r\nCongress for approval.\r\n\r\nThus were created two more American institutions, the territory and the\r\nstate formed out of the public domain. The ordinance was but a few\r\nmonths old when South Carolina ceded (1787) her little strip of country\r\nwest of the mountains (see map on p. 157) with the express condition\r\nthat it _should_ be slave soil. In 1789 North Carolina ceded what is\r\nnow Tennessee on the same condition. Congress accepted both and out of\r\nthem made the "Territory southwest of the Ohio River." In that slavery\r\nwas allowed.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The only remaining land-holding state, Georgia, ceded her\r\nclaim in 1802 (p. 246).]\r\n\r\n%169. Defects of the Articles of Confederation.%--While Congress at\r\nNew York was framing the Ordinance of 1787, a convention of delegates\r\nfrom the states was framing the Constitution at Philadelphia. A very\r\nlittle experience under the Articles of Confederation showed them to\r\nhave serious defects.\r\n\r\n_No Taxing Power_.--In the first place, Congress could not lay a tax of\r\nany kind, and as it could not tax it could not get money with which to\r\npay its expenses and the debt incurred during the Revolution. Each of\r\nthe states was in duty bound to pay its share. But this duty was so\r\ndisregarded that although Congress between 1782 and 1786 called on the\r\nstates for $6,000,000, only $1,000.000 was paid.\r\n\r\n_No Power to regulate Trade_.--In the second place, Congress had no\r\npower to regulate trade with foreign nations, or between the states.\r\nThis proved a most serious evil. The people of the United States at that\r\ntime had few manufactures, because in colonial days Parliament would not\r\nallow them. All the china, glass, hardware, cutlery, woolen goods,\r\nlinen, muslin, and a thousand other things were imported from Great\r\nBritain. Before the war the Americans had paid for these goods with\r\ndried fish, lumber, whale oil, flour, tobacco, rice, and indigo, and\r\nwith money made by trading in the West Indies. Now Great Britain forbade\r\nAmericans to trade with her West Indies. Spain would not make a trade\r\ntreaty with us, so we had no trade with her islands, and what was worse,\r\nGreat Britain taxed everything that came to her from the United States\r\nunless it came in British ships. As a consequence, very little lumber,\r\nfish, rice, and other of our products went abroad to pay for the immense\r\nquantity of foreign-made goods that came to us. These goods therefore\r\nhad to be paid for in money, which about 1785 began to be boxed up and\r\nshipped to London. When the people found that specie was being carried\r\nout of the country, they began to hoard it, so that by 1786 none was in\r\ncirculation.\r\n\r\n%170. Paper Money issued.%--This left the people without any money\r\nwith which to pay wages, or buy food and clothing, and led at once to a\r\ndemand that the states should print paper money and loan it to their\r\ncitizens. Rhode Island, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, North and\r\nSouth Carolina, and Georgia did so. But the money was no sooner issued\r\nthan the merchants and others who had goods to sell refused to take it,\r\nwhereupon in some of the states laws called "tender acts" were passed to\r\ncompel people to use the paper. This merely put an end to business, for\r\nnobody would sell. In Massachusetts, when the legislature refused to\r\nissue paper money, many of the persons who owed debts assembled, and,\r\nduring 1786-87, under the lead of Daniel Shays, a Revolutionary soldier,\r\nprevented the courts from trying suits for the recovery of money owed or\r\nloaned.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Read McMaster\'s _History of the People of the United\r\nStates_, Vol. I., pp. 281-295, 304-329, 331-340; Fiske\'s _Critical\r\nPeriod of American History_, pp. 168-186.]\r\n\r\n%171. Congress proposes Amendments.%--Of the many defects in the\r\nArticles, the Continental Congress was fully aware, and it had many a\r\ntime asked the states to make amendments. One proposed that Congress\r\nshould have power for twenty-five years to lay a tax of five per cent on\r\nall goods imported, and use the money to pay the Continental debts.\r\nAnother was to require each state to raise by special tax a sum\r\nsufficient to pay its yearly share of the current expenses of Congress.\r\nA third was to bestow on Congress for fifteen years the sole power to\r\nregulate trade and commerce. A fourth provided that in future the share\r\neach state was to bear of the current expenses should be in proportion\r\nto its population.\r\n\r\nBut the Articles of Confederation could not be amended unless all\r\nthirteen states consented, and, as all thirteen never did consent, none\r\nof these amendments were ever made.\r\n\r\n%172. The States attempt to regulate Trade and fail.%--In the\r\nmeantime the states attempted to regulate trade for themselves. New York\r\nlaid double duties on English ships. Pennsylvania taxed a long list of\r\nforeign goods. Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island passed\r\nacts imposing heavy duties on articles unless they came in American\r\nvessels. But these laws were not uniform, and as many states took no\r\naction, very little good was accomplished.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: McMaster\'s _History of the People of the United States_,\r\nVol. I., pp. 246-259, 266-280; Fiske\'s _Critical Period of American\r\nHistory_, 134-137, 145-147.]\r\n\r\n%173. A Trade Convention called to meet at Annapolis,\r\n1786.%[2]--Under these conditions, the business of the whole country\r\nwas at a standstill, and as Congress had no power to do anything to\r\nrelieve the distress, the state of Virginia sent out a circular letter\r\nto her sister states. She asked them to appoint delegates to meet and\r\n"take into consideration the trade and commerce of the United States."\r\nFour (New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware) responded, and\r\ntheir delegates, with those from Virginia, met at Annapolis in\r\nSeptember, 1786.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The report of this Annapolis convention is printed in\r\n_Bulletin of Bureau of Rolls and Library of the Department of State_,\r\nNo. 1, Appendix, pp. 1-5.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nMAKING THE CONSTITUTION\r\n\r\n%174. Call for the Constitutional Convention.%--Finding that it could\r\ndo nothing, because so few states were represented, and because the\r\npowers of the delegates were so limited, the convention recommended that\r\nall the states in the Union be asked by Congress to send delegates to a\r\nnew convention, to meet at Philadelphia in May, 1787, "to take into\r\nconsideration the situation of the United States," and "to devise such\r\nfurther provisions as shall appear to them necessary to render the\r\nConstitution of the Federal government adequate to the exigencies of\r\nthe Union."\r\n\r\n%175. The Philadelphia Convention.%[1]--Early in 1787 Congress\r\napproved this movement, and during the summer of 1787 (May to September)\r\ndelegates from twelve states (Rhode Island sent none), sitting in secret\r\nsession at Philadelphia, made the Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: All we know of the proceedings of this convention is\r\nderived from the journals of the convention, the notes taken down by\r\nJames Madison, the notes of Yates of New York, and a speech by Luther\r\nMartin of Maryland. They may be found in Elliot\'s _Debates_, Vol. IV.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Independence Chamber[2]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The room where the Constitution was framed.]\r\n\r\n%176. The Virginia and New Jersey Plans%.--The story of that\r\nconvention is too long and too complicated to be told in full.[1] But\r\nsome of its proceedings must be noticed. While the delegates were\r\nassembling, a few men, under the lead of Madison, met and drew up the\r\noutline of a constitution, which was presented by the chairman of the\r\nVirginia delegation, and was called the "Virginia plan." A little later,\r\ndelegates from the small states met and drew up a second plan, which was\r\nthe old Articles of Confederation with amendments. As the chairman of\r\nthe New Jersey delegation offered this, it was called the "New Jersey\r\nplan." Both were discussed; but the convention voted to accept the\r\nVirginia plan as the basis of the Constitution.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: For short accounts, read "The Framers and the Framing of\r\nthe Constitution" in the _Century Magazine_, September, 1887, or\r\n"Framing the Constitution," in McMaster\'s _With the Fathers_, pp.\r\n106-149, or Thorpe\'s _Story of the Constitution_, Chautauqua Course,\r\n1891-92, pp. 111-148.]\r\n\r\n%177. The Three Compromises.%--This plan called, among other things,\r\nfor a national legislature of two branches: a Senate and a House of\r\nRepresentatives. The populous states insisted that the number of\r\nrepresentatives sent by each state to Congress should be in proportion\r\nto her population. The small states insisted that each should send the\r\nsame number of representatives. For a time neither party would yield;\r\nbut at length the Connecticut delegates suggested that the states be\r\ngiven an equal vote and an equal representation in the Senate, and an\r\nunequal representation, based on population, in the House. The\r\ncontending parties agreed, and so made the first compromise.\r\n\r\nBut the decision to have representation according to population at once\r\nraised the question, Shall slaves be counted as population? This divided\r\nthe convention into slave states and free (see p. 186), and led to a\r\nsecond compromise, by which it was agreed that three fifths of all\r\nslaves should be counted as population, for the purpose of apportioning\r\nrepresentation.\r\n\r\nA third compromise sprang from the conflicting interests of the\r\ncommercial and the planting states. The planting states wanted a\r\nprovision forbidding Congress to pass navigation acts, except by a\r\ntwo-thirds vote, and forbidding any tax on exports; three states also\r\nwished to import slaves for use on their plantations. The free\r\ncommercial states wanted Congress to pass navigation laws, and also\r\nwanted the slave trade stopped, because of the three-fifths rule. The\r\nresult was an agreement that the importation of slaves should not be\r\nforbidden by Congress before 1808, and that Congress might pass\r\nnavigation acts, and that exports should never be taxed.\r\n\r\n%178. The Election of President.%--Another feature of the Virginia\r\nplan was the provision for a President whose business it should be to\r\nsee that the acts of Congress were duly enforced or executed. But when\r\nthe question arose, How shall he be chosen? all manner of suggestions\r\nwere made. Some said by the governors of the states; some, by the United\r\nStates Senate; some, by the state legislatures; some, by a body of\r\nelectors chosen for that purpose. When at last it was decided to have a\r\nbody of electors, the difficulty was to determine the manner of electing\r\nthe electors. On this no agreement could be reached; so the convention\r\nordered that the legislature of each state should have as many electors\r\nof the President as it had senators and representatives in Congress, and\r\nthat these men should be appointed in such way as the legislatures of\r\nthe states saw fit to prescribe.\r\n\r\n%179. Sources of the Constitution.%--An examination of the\r\nConstitution shows that some of its features were new; that some were\r\ndrawn from the experience of the states under the Confederation; and\r\nthat others were borrowed from the various state constitutions. Among\r\nthose taken from state constitutions are such names as President,\r\nSenate, House of Representatives, and such provisions as that for a\r\ncensus, for the veto, for the retirement of one third of the Senate\r\nevery two years, that money bills shall originate in the House, for\r\nimpeachment, and for what we call the annual message.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: On the sources of the Constitution, read "The First Century\r\nof the Constitution" in _New Princeton Review,_ September, 1887,\r\npp. 175-190.]\r\n\r\nThe features based directly on experience under the Articles of\r\nConfederation are the provisions that the acts of Congress must be\r\n_uniform_ throughout the Union; that the President may call out the\r\nmilitia to repel invasion, to put down insurrection, and to maintain the\r\nlaws of the Union; that Congress shall have _sole_ power to regulate\r\n_foreign trade_ and _trade between the states._ No state can now coin\r\nmoney or print paper money, or make anything but gold or silver legal\r\ntender. Congress now has power to lay taxes, duties, and excises. The\r\nConstitution divides the powers of government between the legislative\r\ndepartment (Senate and House of Representatives); the executive\r\ndepartment (the President, who sees that laws and treaties are obeyed);\r\nand the judicial department (Supreme Court and other United States\r\ncourts, which interpret the Constitution, the acts of Congress, and the\r\ntreaties).\r\n\r\nThe new features are the definition of treason and the limitation of its\r\npunishment; the guarantee to every state of a republican form of\r\ngovernment; the swearing of state officials to support the Federal\r\nConstitution; and the provision for amendment.\r\n\r\nAmong other noteworthy features are the creation of a United States\r\ncitizenship as distinct from a state citizenship, the limitation of the\r\npowers of the states; and the provision that the Constitution, the acts\r\nof Congress, and the treaties are "the supreme law of the land."\r\n\r\n%180. Constitution submitted to the People.%--The convention ended\r\nits work, and such members as were willing signed the Constitution on\r\nSeptember 17, 1787. Washington, as president of the convention, then\r\nsent the Constitution to the Continental Congress sitting at New York\r\nand asked it to transmit copies to the states for ratification. This was\r\ndone, and during the next few months the legislatures of most of the\r\nstates called on the people to elect delegates to conventions which\r\nshould accept or reject the Constitution.\r\n\r\n%181. Ratification by the States.%--In many of these conventions\r\ngreat objection was made because the new plan of federal government was\r\nso unlike the Articles of Confederation, and certain changes were\r\ninsisted on. The only states that accepted it just as it was framed were\r\nDelaware, Pennsylvania, New Jersey, Georgia, Connecticut, and Maryland.\r\nMassachusetts, South Carolina, New Hampshire, New York, and Virginia\r\nratified with amendments. (For dates, see p. 176.)\r\n\r\n%182. "The New Roof."%--The Constitution provided that when nine\r\nstates had ratified, it should go into effect "between the states so\r\nratifying." While it was under discussion the Federalists, as the\r\nfriends of the Constitution were named, had called it "the New Roof,"\r\nwhich was going to cover the states and protect them from political\r\nstorms. They now represented it as completed and supported by eleven\r\npillars or states. Two states, Rhode Island and North Carolina, had not\r\nratified, and so were not under the New Roof, and were not members of\r\nthe new Union. Eleven states having approved, nothing remained but to\r\nfix the particular day on which the electors of President should be\r\nchosen, and the time and place for the meeting of the new Congress. This\r\nthe Continental Congress did in September, 1788, by ordering that the\r\nelectors should be chosen on the first Wednesday in January, 1789, that\r\nthey should meet and vote for President on the first Wednesday in\r\nFebruary, and that the new Congress should meet at New York on the first\r\nWednesday in March, which happened to be the fourth day of the month.\r\nLater, Congress by law fixed March 4 as the day on which the terms of\r\nthe Presidents begin and end.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The question is often asked, When did the Constitution go\r\ninto force? Article VII. says, "The ratification of the conventions of\r\nnine states shall be sufficient for the establishment of this\r\nConstitution between the states so ratifying the same." New Hampshire,\r\nthe ninth state, ratified June 21, 1788, and on that day, therefore, the\r\nconstitution was "established" between the nine.]\r\n\r\n%183. How Presidents were elected%.--It must not be supposed that our\r\nfirst presidents were elected just as presidents are now. In our time\r\nelectors are everywhere chosen by popular vote. In 1788 there was no\r\nuniformity. In Pennsylvania, Maryland, and Virginia the people had a\r\ncomplete, and in Massachusetts and New Hampshire a partial, choice. In\r\nConnecticut, Delaware, New Jersey, South Carolina, and Georgia the\r\nelectors were appointed by the legislatures. In New York the two\r\nbranches of the legislature quarreled, and no electors were chosen.\r\n\r\nAs the Constitution required that the electors should vote by ballot for\r\ntwo persons, such as had been appointed met at their state capitals on\r\nthe first Wednesday in February, 1789, made lists of the persons voted\r\nfor, and sent them signed and certified under seal to the president of\r\nthe Senate. But when March 4, 1789, came, there was no Senate. Less than\r\na majority of that body had arrived in New York, so no business could be\r\ndone. When at length the Senate secured a majority, the House was still\r\nwithout one, and remained so till April. Then, in the presence of the\r\nHouse and Senate, the votes on the lists were counted, and it was found\r\nthat every elector had given one of his votes for George Washington, who\r\nwas thus elected President. No separate ballot was then required for\r\nVice President. Each elector merely wrote on his ballot the names of two\r\nmen. He who received the greatest number of votes, if, in the words of\r\nthe Constitution, "such number be a majority of the whole number of\r\nelectors appointed," was elected President. He who received the next\r\nhighest, even if less than a majority, was elected Vice President. In\r\n1789 this man was John Adams of Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Federal Hall, New York[1]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: From an old print made in 1797.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: G Washington]\r\n\r\n%184. The First Inauguration.%--As soon as Washington received the\r\nnews of his election, he left Mount Vernon and started for New York. His\r\njourney was one continuous triumphal march. The population of every town\r\nthrough which he passed turned out to meet him. Men, women, and children\r\nstood for hours by the roadside waiting for him to go by. At New York\r\nhis reception was most imposing, and there, on April 30, 1789, standing\r\non the balcony in front of Federal Hall (p. 171), he took the oath of\r\noffice in the presence of Congress and a great multitude of people that\r\nfilled the streets, and crowded the windows, and sat on the roofs of the\r\nneighboring houses.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Full accounts of the inauguration of Washington may be\r\nfound in _Harper\'s Magazine_, and also in the _Century Magazine_, for\r\nApril, 1889.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\n1. When independence was about decided on, Congress appointed a\r\ncommittee to draft a general plan of federal government.\r\n\r\n2. This plan, called Articles of Confederation, Maryland absolutely\r\nrefused to ratify till the states claiming land west of the Alleghany\r\nMountains ceded their claims to Congress.\r\n\r\n3. New York and Virginia having ceded their claims, Maryland ratified in\r\nMarch, 1781.\r\n\r\n4. These cessions were followed by others from Massachusetts and\r\nConnecticut; and from them all, Congress formed the public domain to be\r\nsold to pay the debt.\r\n\r\n5. The sale of this land led to the land ordinance of 1785 and the\r\nordinance of 1787, for the government of the domain and the new\r\npolitical organism called the territory.\r\n\r\n6. The defects of the Articles made revision necessary, and produced\r\nsuch distress that two conventions were called to consider the state of\r\nthe country. That at Annapolis attempted nothing. That at Philadelphia\r\nframed the Constitution of the United States.\r\n\r\n7. The Constitution was then passed to the Continental Congress, which\r\nsent it to the legislatures of the states to be by them referred to\r\nconventions elected by the people for acceptance or rejection.\r\n\r\n8. Eleven having ratified, Congress in 1788 fixed a day in 1789 (which\r\nhappened to be March 4), when the First Congress under the Constitution\r\nwas to assemble.\r\n\r\n9. The date of the first presidential election was also fixed, and\r\nGeorge Washington was made our first President.\r\n\r\n\r\n                    /1776.

The States.%--What sort of a country, and what sort of people,\r\nwas Washington thus chosen to rule over? When, he was elected, the Union\r\nwas composed of eleven states, for neither Rhode Island nor North\r\nCarolina had accepted the Constitution.[1] Vermont had never been a\r\nmember of the Union, because the Continental Congress would not\r\nrecognize her as a state.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The states ratified the Constitution on the dates given below:\r\n1.  Delaware         Dec.  7, 1787\r\n2.  Pennsylvania     Dec. 12, 1787\r\n3.  New Jersey       Dec. 18, 1787\r\n4.  Georgia          Jan.  2, 1788\r\n5.  Connecticut      Jan.  9, 1788\r\n6.

Only a Part inhabited.%--Three fourths of our country was then\r\nuninhabited by white men, and almost all the people lived near the\r\nseaboard. Had a line been drawn along what was then the frontier, it\r\nwould (as the map on p. 177 shows) have run along the shore of Maine,\r\nacross New Hampshire and Vermont to Lake Champlain, then south to the\r\nMohawk valley, then down the Hudson River, and southwestward across\r\nPennsylvania to Pittsburg, then south along the Blue Ridge Mountains to\r\nthe Altamaha River in Georgia, and by it to the sea. How many people\r\nlived here was never known till 1790. The Constitution of the United\r\nStates requires that the people shall be counted once in each ten years,\r\nin order that it may be determined how many representatives each state\r\nshall have in the House of Representatives; and for this purpose\r\nCongress ordered the first census to be taken in 1790. It then appeared\r\nthat, excluding Indians, there were living in the eleven United States\r\n3,380,000 human beings, or less than half the number of people who now\r\nlive in the single state of New York.\r\n\r\n%187. How the People were scattered.%--More were in the Southern than\r\nin the Eastern States. Virginia, then the most populous, contained one\r\nfifth. Pennsylvania had a ninth, while in the five states of Maryland,\r\nVirginia, the two Carolinas, and Georgia were almost one half of the\r\nEnglish-speaking people of the United States. These were the planting\r\nstates, and, populous as they were, they had but two cities--Baltimore\r\nand Charleston. Savannah, Wilmington, Alexandria, Norfolk, and\r\nRichmond were small towns. Not one had 8000 people in it. Indeed, the\r\ninhabitants of the six largest cities of the country (Boston, New York,\r\nPhiladelphia, Baltimore, Charleston, and Salem) taken together were\r\nbut 131,000.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DISTRIBUTION OF THE POPULATION OF THE UNITED STATES FIRST\r\nCENSUS, 1790/]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Boston in 1790[1]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: From the _Massachusetts Magazine_, November, 1790.]\r\n\r\n%188. The Cities.%--And how different these cities were from those of\r\nour day! What a strange world Washington would find himself in if he\r\ncould come back and walk along the streets of the great city which now\r\nstands on the banks of the Potomac and bears his name! He never in his\r\nlife saw a flagstone sidewalk, nor an asphalted street, nor a pane of\r\nglass six feet square. He never heard a factory whistle; he never saw a\r\nbuilding ten stories high, nor an elevator, nor a gas jet, nor an\r\nelectric light; he never saw a hot-air furnace, nor entered a room\r\nwarmed by steam.\r\n\r\nIn the windows of shop after shop would be scores of articles familiar\r\nenough to us, but so unknown to him that he could not even name them. He\r\nnever saw a sewing machine, nor a revolver, nor a rubber coat, nor a\r\nrubber shoe, nor a steel pen, nor a piece of blotting paper, nor an\r\nenvelope, nor a postage stamp, nor a typewriter. He never struck a\r\nmatch, nor sent a telegram, nor spoke through a telephone, nor touched\r\nan electric bell. He never saw a railroad, though he had seen a rude\r\nform of steamboat. He never saw a horse car, nor an omnibus, nor a\r\ntrolley car, nor a ferryboat. Fancy him boarding a street car to take a\r\nride. He would probably pay his fare with a "nickel." But the "nickel"\r\nis a coin he never saw. Fancy him trying to understand the\r\nadvertisements that would meet his eye as he took his seat! Fancy him\r\nstaring from the window at a fence bright with theatrical posters, or at\r\na man rushing by on a bicycle!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Philadelphia in 1800 (Arch Street)]\r\n\r\n%189. Newspapers and Magazines.%--A boy enters the car with half a\r\ndozen daily newspapers all printed in the same city. In Washington\'s day\r\nthere were but four daily papers in the United States! On the news\r\ncounter of a hotel, one sees twenty illustrated papers, and fifty\r\nmonthly magazines. In his day there was no illustrated paper, no\r\nscientific periodical, no trade journal, and no such illustrated\r\nmagazines as _Harper\'s, Scribner\'s_, the _Century, St. Nicholas_. All\r\nthe printing done in the country was done on presses worked by hand.\r\nTo-day the Hoe octuple press can print 96,000 eight-page newspapers an\r\nhour. To print this number on the hand press shown in the picture would\r\nhave taken so long that when the last newspaper was printed the first\r\nwould have been three months old!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Franklin press]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A fire bucket [1]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Original in the Pennsylvania Historical Society.]\r\n\r\n%190. The Fire Service.%--the ambulance, the steam fire engine, the\r\nhose cart, the hook and ladder company, the police patrol, the police\r\nofficer on the street corner, the letter carrier gathering the mail, the\r\ndistrict messenger boy, the express company, the delivery wagon of the\r\nstores, have all come in since Washington died. In his day the law\r\nrequired every householder in the city to be a fireman. His name might\r\nnot appear on the rolls of any of the fire companies, he might not help\r\nto drag through the streets the lumbering tank which served as a fire\r\nengine, but he must have in his hall, or beneath the stairs, or hanging\r\nup behind his shop door, at least one leathern bucket inscribed with his\r\nname, and a huge bag of canvas or of duck. Then, if he were aroused at\r\nthe dead of night by the cry of fire and the clanging of every church\r\nbell in the town, he seized this bucket and his bag, and, while his\r\nwife put a lighted candle in the window to illuminate the street, set\r\noff for the fire. The smoke or the flame was his guide, for the custom\r\nof indicating the place by a number of strokes on a bell had not yet\r\ncome in. When at last he arrived at the scene he found there no idle\r\nspectators. Every one was busy. Some hurried into the building and\r\nfilled their sacks with such movable goods as came nearest to hand. Some\r\njoined the line that stretched away to the water, and helped to pass the\r\nfull buckets to those who stood by the fire. Others took posts in a\r\nsecond line, down which the empty buckets were hastened to the pump. The\r\nhouse would often be half consumed when the shouting made known that the\r\nengine had come. It was merely a pump mounted over a tank. Into the tank\r\nthe water from the buckets was poured, and it was pumped thence by the\r\nefforts of a dozen men.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fire engine of 1800[1]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: From an old cut]\r\n\r\n%191. The Post Office.%--Washington sees a great wagon or a white\r\ntrolley car marked United States Mail, and on inquiry is told that the\r\nmoney now spent by the government each year for the support of the post\r\noffices would have more than paid the national debt when he was\r\nPresident. He hears with amazement that there are now 75,000 post\r\noffices, and recalls that in 1790 there were but seventy-five. He picks\r\nup from the sidewalk a piece of paper with a little pink something on\r\nthe corner. He is told that the portrait on it is his own, that it is a\r\npostage stamp, that it costs two cents, and will carry a letter to San\r\nFrancisco, a city he never heard of, and, if the person to whom it is\r\naddressed cannot be found, will bring the letter back to the sender, a\r\ndistance of over 5000 miles. In his day a letter was a single sheet of\r\npaper, no matter how large or small, and the postage on it was\r\ndetermined not by weight, but by distance, and might be anything from\r\nsix to twenty-five cents.\r\n\r\nAt that time postage must always be prepaid, and as the post office must\r\nsupport itself, letters were not sent from the country towns till enough\r\npostage had been deposited at the post office to pay the expense of\r\nsending them. Newspapers and books could not be sent by mail.\r\n\r\n%192. The Franchise.%--Taking the country through, the condition of\r\nthe people was by no means so happy as ours. They had government of the\r\npeople, but it was not by the people nor for the people. Everywhere the\r\nright to vote and to hold office was greatly restricted. The voter must\r\nhave an estate worth a certain sum, or a specified number of acres, or\r\nan annual income of so many dollars. But the right to vote did not carry\r\nwith it the right to hold office. More property was required for office\r\nholding than for voting, and there were besides certain religious\r\nrestrictions. In New Hampshire, New Jersey, North Carolina, South\r\nCarolina, and Georgia, the governor, the members of the legislature, and\r\nthe chief officers of state must be Protestants. In Massachusetts and\r\nMaryland they must be Christians. All these restrictions were long since\r\nswept away.\r\n\r\n%193. Cruel Punishments.%--The humane spirit of our times was largely\r\nwanting. The debtor was cast into prison. The pauper might be sold to\r\nthe highest bidder. The criminal was dragged out into open day and\r\nflogged or branded. From ten to nineteen crimes were punishable with\r\ndeath. No such thing as a lunatic asylum, or a deaf and dumb asylum, or\r\na penitentiary existed. The prisons were dreadful places. Men came out\r\nof them worse than they went in.\r\n\r\n%194. The Condition of the Laborer; of the well to do.%--Men worked\r\nharder and for less money then than now. A regular working day was from\r\nsunrise to sunset, with an hour for breakfast and an hour for dinner.\r\nSometimes the laborer was fed and lodged by the employer, in which case\r\nhe was paid four dollars a month in winter and six in summer. Two\r\nshillings (30 cents) a day for unskilled labor was thought high wages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: %Washington\'s flute and Miss Custis\'s harpsichord at\r\nMount Vernon%]\r\n\r\nEven the houses of the well to do were much less comfortable places than\r\nare such abodes in our day. There were no furnaces, no gas, no\r\nbathrooms, no plumbing. Wood was the universal fuel. Coal from Virginia\r\nand Rhode Island was little used. All cooking was done in "Dutch ovens,"\r\nor in "out ovens," or in the enormous fireplaces to be found in every\r\nhousehold. Wood fuel made sooty chimneys, and sooty chimneys took fire.\r\nIn every city, therefore, were men known as "sweeps," whose business it\r\nwas to clean chimneys.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: %Earthenware stove--Moravian%]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: %Dutch oven%[1]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The bread, or meat, to be baked was put into the pot, and\r\nhot coals were heaped all around the sides and on the lid, which had a\r\nrim to keep the coals on it.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: a foot stove]\r\n\r\nWashington was a farmer, yet he never in his life beheld a tomato, nor a\r\ncauliflower, nor an eggplant, nor a horserake, nor a drill, nor a reaper\r\nand binder, nor a threshing machine, nor a barbed wire fence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Kitchen in Washington\'s headquarters in Morristown,\r\nN.J.[1]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This shows a fine specimen of the old-fashioned fireplace.\r\nNotice the andirons, the bellows, the lamp, the spinning wheel, the old\r\nDutch clock, and the kettles hanging on the crane over the logs.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A plow used in 1776]\r\n\r\nHis land was plowed with a wooden plow partly shod with iron. His seed\r\nwas sown by hand; his hay was cut with scythes; his grain was reaped\r\nwith sickles, and threshed on the barn floor with flails in the hands of\r\nhis slaves.\r\n\r\n%195. Negro Slavery.%--No living person under thirty years of age has\r\never seen a negro slave in our country. When Washington was President\r\nthere were 700,000 slaves. When the Revolution opened, slavery was\r\npermitted by law in every colony. But the feeling against it in the\r\nNorth had always been strong, and when the war ended, the people began\r\nthe work of abolition. In Massachusetts and New Hampshire the\r\nconstitutions of the states declared that "all men are born free and\r\nequal," and that "all men are born equally free," and this was\r\nunderstood to abolish slavery. In Pennsylvania, slavery was abolished in\r\n1780. In Rhode Island and Connecticut gradual abolition laws were passed\r\nwhich provided that all children born of slave parents after a certain\r\nday should be free at a certain age, and that their children should\r\nnever be slaves. The Ordinance of 1787 had prohibited slavery in the\r\nNorthwest Territory. But in 1790 New York, New Jersey, Delaware,\r\nMaryland, and all the states south of these were slave states. (See map\r\non the next page.)\r\n\r\nThough slaves were men and women and children, they had no civil rights\r\nwhatever. They could be bought and sold, leased, seized for a debt,\r\nbequeathed by will, given away. If they made anything, or found\r\nanything, or earned anything, it belonged not to them, but to their\r\nowners. They were property just as oxen or horses were in the North. It\r\nwas unlawful to teach them to read or write. They were not allowed to\r\ngive evidence against a white man, nor to travel in bands of more than\r\nseven unless a white man was with them, nor to quit the plantation\r\nwithout leave.\r\n\r\nIf a planter provided coarse food, coarse clothes, and a rude shelter\r\nfor his slaves, if he did not work them more than fifteen hours out of\r\ntwenty-four in summer, nor more than fourteen in winter, and if he gave\r\nthem every Sunday to themselves, he did quite as much for their comfort\r\nas the law required he should.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAP SHOWING THE AREA OF %SLAVE AND FREE SOIL IN 1790%]\r\n\r\nIf the slave committed any offense, if he stole anything, or refused to\r\nwork, or ran away, it was lawful to load him with irons, to confine him\r\nfor any length of time in a cell, and to beat him and whip him till the\r\nblood ran in streams from the wounds, and he grew too weak to stand.\r\nOld advertisements are still extant in which runaway blacks are\r\ndescribed by the scars left upon their bodies by the lash. When such\r\nlashings were not prescribed by the court, they were commonly given\r\nunder the eye of the overseer, or inflicted by the owner himself.\r\n\r\n%196. Six Days from Boston to New York.%--Our country was small when\r\nWashington was President. The people lived on the seaboard. The towns\r\nand cities were not actually very far apart; but the means of travel\r\nwere so poor, the time consumed in going even fifty miles was so great,\r\nthat the country was practically immense in extent. Now we step into a\r\nbeautifully fitted car, heated by steam, lighted by electricity, richly\r\ncarpeted, and provided with most comfortable seats and beds, and are\r\nwhirled across the continent from Philadelphia to San Francisco in less\r\ntime than it took Washington to go from New York to Boston.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Old mill at West Falmouth, Mass.[1]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In many parts of the country where there was no water\r\npower, as Cape Cod, Long Island, Nantucket, etc., flour was ground at\r\nwindmills. The windmill shown in the picture was built in 1787, and is\r\nstill in use.]\r\n\r\nIf you had lived in 1791 and started, say, from Boston, to go to\r\nPhiladelphia to see the President and the great city where independence\r\nhad been declared, you would very likely have begun by making your will,\r\nand bidding good-by to your friends. You would then have gone down to\r\nthe office of the proprietor of the stagecoach, and secured a seat to\r\nNew York. As the coach left but twice a week, you would have waited\r\ntill the day came and would then have presented yourself, at three\r\no\'clock in the morning, at the tavern whence the coach started.\r\n\r\nThe stagecoach was little better than a huge covered box mounted on\r\nsprings. It had neither glass windows, nor door, nor steps, nor closed\r\nsides. The roof was upheld by ten posts which rose from the body of the\r\nvehicle, and the body was commonly breast high. From the top were hung\r\ncurtains of leather, to be rolled up when the day was fine, and let down\r\nand buttoned when it was rainy and cold. Within were four seats. Without\r\nwas the baggage. Fourteen pounds of luggage were allowed to be carried\r\nfree by each passenger. But if your portmanteau or your\r\nbrass-nail-studded hair trunk weighed more, you would have paid for it\r\nat the rate per mile that you paid for yourself. Under no circumstances,\r\nhowever, would you be permitted to take on the journey more than 150\r\npounds. When the baggage had all been weighed and strapped on the coach,\r\nwhen the horses had been attached, and the waybill, containing the names\r\nof the passengers, made out, the passengers would clamber to their seats\r\nthrough the front of the stage and sit down with their faces toward the\r\ndriver\'s seat.\r\n\r\nOne pair of horses usually dragged the coach eighteen miles, when a\r\nfresh pair would be attached, and if all went well, you would be put\r\ndown about ten at night at some wayside inn or tavern after a journey of\r\nforty miles. Cramped and weary, you would eat a frugal supper and hurry\r\noff to bed with a notice from the landlord to be ready to start at three\r\nthe next morning. Then, no matter if it rained or snowed, you would be\r\nforced to make ready by the dim light of a horn lantern, unknown now,\r\nfor another ride of eighteen hours.\r\n\r\nIf no mishaps occurred, if the coach was not upset by the ruts, if storm\r\nor flood did not delay you at Springfield, where the road met the\r\nConnecticut, or at Stratford, where it met the Housatonic, each of which\r\nhad to be crossed on clumsy flatboats, the stage would roll into New\r\nYork at the end of the sixth day.\r\n\r\n%197. Two Days from New York to Philadelphia.%--And here a serious\r\ndelay was almost certain to occur, for even in the best of weather it\r\nwas no easy matter to cross the Hudson to New Jersey. When the wind was\r\nhigh and the water rough, or the river full of ice, the boldest did not\r\ndare to risk a crossing. Once over the river, you would again go on by\r\ncoach, and at the end of two more days would reach Philadelphia. In our\r\ntime one can travel in eight hours the entire distance between Boston\r\nand Philadelphia, a distance which Washington could not have traversed\r\nin less than eight days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Stagecoach and inn[1]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: From a print of 1798.]\r\n\r\n%198. The Roads and the Inns.%--The newspapers and the travelers of\r\nthose days complained bitterly of the roads and the inns. On the best\r\nroads the ruts were deep, the descents precipitous, and the passengers\r\nwere often forced to get out and help the driver pull the wheels out of\r\nthe mud. Breakdowns and upsets were of everyday occurrence. Yet bad as\r\nthe roads were, the travel was so considerable that very often the inns\r\nand taverns even in the large cities could not lodge all who applied\r\nunless they slept five or six in a room.\r\n\r\n%199. A Steamboat on the Delaware.%--Rude as this means of travel\r\nseems to us, the men of 1790 were quite satisfied with it, and\r\nabsolutely refused to make use of a better one. Had you been in\r\nPhiladelphia during the summer of 1790 and taken up a copy of _The\r\nPennsylvania Packet_, you could not have failed to notice this\r\nadvertisement of the first successful steamboat in the world:\r\n\r\n     %The Steam-Boat\r\n\r\n     Is now ready to take Passengers, and is intended to\r\n     set off from Arch Street Ferry in Philadelphia every\r\n     _Monday, Wednesday_ and _Friday_, for _Burlington,\r\n     Bristol, Bordentown_ and _Trenton_, to return on _Tuesdays,\r\n     Thursdays_ and _Saturdays_--Price for Passengers, 2/6 to\r\n     Burlington and Bristol, 3/9 to Bordentown, 5/. to\r\n     Trenton.  June 14. tu.th ftf.%\r\n\r\nThis boat was the invention of John Fitch, and from June to September\r\nran up and down the Delaware; but so few people went on it that he could\r\nnot pay expenses, and the boat was withdrawn.\r\n\r\n%200. To the Great West.%--From Philadelphia went out one of the\r\ngreat highways to what was then the far West, but to what we now know as\r\nthe valley of the Ohio. The traveler who to-day makes the journey from\r\nPhiladelphia to Pittsburg is whisked on a railroad car through an\r\nendless succession of cities and villages and rich farms, and by great\r\nfactories and mills and iron works, which in the days of Washington had\r\nno existence. He makes the journey easily between sunrise and sunset. In\r\n1790 he could not have made it in twelve days.\r\n\r\n%201. Towns beyond the Alleghany Mountains.%--Though the country\r\nbetween the Alleghany Mountains and the Mississippi had been closed to\r\nsettlement from 1763 to 1776 by the King\'s proclamation, it was by no\r\nmeans without population in 1790. At Detroit and Kaskaskia and Vincennes\r\nwere old French settlements, made long before France was driven out of\r\nLouisiana. But there were others of later date. The hardy frontiersman\r\nof 1763 cared no more for the King\'s proclamation than he did for the\r\nbark of the wolf at his cabin door. The ink with which the document was\r\nwritten had not dried before emigrants from Maryland and Virginia and\r\nPennsylvania were hurrying into the valley of the Monongahela.\r\n\r\nIn 1769 William Bean crossed the mountains from North Carolina, and,\r\nbuilding a cabin on the banks of Watauga Creek, began the settlement of\r\nTennessee. James Robertson and a host of others followed in 1770, and\r\nsoon the valleys of the Clinch and the Holston were dotted with cabins.\r\nIn 1769 Daniel Boone, one of the grandest figures in frontier history,\r\nbegan his exploits in what is now Kentucky, and before 1777 Boonesboro,\r\nHarrodsburg, and Lexington were founded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: %Model of Fitch\'s steamboat%[l]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Now in the National Museum, Washington.]\r\n\r\n%202. State of Franklin.%--Before the Revolution closed, emigrants\r\nunder James Robertson and John Donelson planted Nashville and half a\r\ndozen other settlements on the Cumberland, in middle Tennessee. After\r\nthe Revolution ended, so many settlers were in eastern Tennessee that\r\nthey tried to make a new state. North Carolina, following the example\r\nof her Northern sisters, ceded to Congress her claim to what is now\r\nTennessee in 1784. But the people on the Watauga no sooner heard, of it\r\nthan under the lead of John Sevier they organized the state of Franklin,\r\nwhereupon North Carolina repealed the act of cession and absorbed the\r\nnew state by making the Franklin officials her officials for the\r\ndistrict of Tennessee. In 1789 she again ceded the district, and in May\r\nof that year Tennessee became part of the public domain.\r\n\r\n%203. Squatters in Ohio.%--The cession to Congress of the land north\r\nof the Ohio led to an emigration from Virginia and Kentucky to what is\r\nnow the state of Ohio. As this territory was to be sold to pay the\r\nnational debt, Congress was forced to order the squatters away, and when\r\nthey refused to go, sent troops to burn their cabins, destroy their\r\ncrops, and drive them across the Ohio. The lawful settlement of the\r\nterritory began after the Ohio and Scioto companies bought their lands\r\nin 1787, and John C. Symmes purchased his in 1788.\r\n\r\n%204. Pittsburg in 1790.%--At Pittsburg, then the greatest town in\r\nthe United States west of the Alleghany Mountains, were some 200 houses,\r\nmostly of logs, and 2000 people, a newspaper, and a few rude\r\nmanufactories. The life of the town was its river trade. Pittsburg was\r\nthe place where emigrants "fitted out" for the West. A settler intending\r\nto go down the Ohio valley with his family and his goods would lay in a\r\nstock of powder and ball, buy flour and ham enough to last him for a\r\nmonth, and secure two rude structures which passed under the name\r\nof boats.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: %The first millstones and salt kettle in Ohio%]\r\n\r\n%205. A Trip down the Ohio in 1790.%--In the long keel boat he would\r\nput his wife, his children, and such travelers as had been waiting at\r\nPittsburg for a chance to go down the river. In the flatboat would be\r\nhis cattle or his stores. Two dangers beset the voyager on the Ohio. His\r\nboat might become entangled in the branches of the trees that overhung\r\nthe river, or be fired into by the Indians who lurked in the woods. The\r\ncabin of the keel boat, therefore, was low, that it might glide under\r\nthe trees, and the roof and sides were made as nearly bullet-proof as\r\npossible. The whole craft was steered by a huge oar mounted on a pivot\r\nat the stern.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See the boats in the pictures on next page.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Map of Ohio]\r\n\r\n%206. Towns along the Ohio.%--As the emigrant in such an ark floated\r\ndown the river, he would come first to Wheeling, a town of fifty log\r\ncabins, and then to Marietta, a town planted in Ohio in 1788 by settlers\r\nsent by the Ohio Company. Below Marietta were Belpre and Gallipolis, a\r\nsettlement made by Frenchmen brought there by the Scioto Company. Yet\r\nfarther down, on the Kentucky side, were Limestone (now Maysville) and\r\nNewport, opposite which some settlers were founding the city of\r\nCincinnati. Once past Cincinnati, all was unbroken wilderness till one\r\nreached Louisville in Kentucky, beyond which few emigrants had yet\r\nventured to go.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: %Cincinnati in 1802 (Fort Washington)%]\r\n\r\n%207. Cotton Planting.%--The South, in 1790, was on the eve of a\r\ngreat industrial revolution. The products of the states south of\r\nVirginia had been tar, pitch, resin, lumber, rice, and indigo. But in\r\nthe years following the peace the indigo plants had been destroyed year\r\nafter year by an insect. As the plant was not a native of our country,\r\nbut was brought from the West Indies, it became necessary either to\r\nimport more seed plants, or to raise some other staple. Many chose the\r\nlatter course, and about 1787 began to grow cotton.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: %Farmers\' Castle (Belpre) in 1791%]\r\n\r\n%208. Whitney and the Cotton Gin.%--The experiment succeeded, but a\r\nserious difficulty arose. The cotton plant has pods which when ripe\r\nsplit open and show a white woolly substance attached to seeds. Before\r\nthe cotton could be used, these seeds must be picked out, and as the\r\nlabor of cleaning was very great, only a small quantity could be sent to\r\nmarket. It happened, however, that a young man from Massachusetts, named\r\nEli Whitney, was then living in Georgia, and he, seeing the need of a\r\nmachine to clean cotton, invented the cotton gin.[1] Till then, a negro\r\nslave could not clean two pounds of cotton in a day. With the gin the\r\nsame slave in the same time could remove the seeds from a hundred\r\npounds. This solved the difficulty, and gave to the United States\r\nanother staple even greater in value than tobacco. In 1792 one hundred\r\nand ninety-two thousand pounds of cotton were exported to Europe; in\r\n1795, after the gin was invented, six million pounds were sent out of\r\nthe country. In 1894 no less than 4275 million pounds were raised and\r\neither consumed or exported. Of all the marvelous inventions of our\r\ncountrymen, this produced the very greatest consequences. It made\r\ncotton planting profitable; it brought immense wealth to the people of\r\nthe South every year; it covered New England with cotton mills; and by\r\nmaking slave labor profitable it did more than anything else to fasten\r\nslavery on the United States for seventy years, and finally to bring on\r\nthe Civil War, the most terrible struggle of modern times.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The word "gin" is a contraction of "engine."]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: %The cotton gin% _A_. Whitney\'s original gin. _B_. A\r\nlater form.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\n1. When Washington was inaugurated, the United States consisted of\r\neleven states, with a population of about 3,380,000.\r\n\r\n2. These people lived not far from the Atlantic coast. Few cities\r\nexisted; not one had 50,000 inhabitants. Even the largest was without\r\nmany conveniences which we consider necessaries.\r\n\r\n3. Travel was slow and difficult, and though a steamboat had been\r\ninvented and used, it was too far ahead of the times to succeed.\r\n\r\n4. West of the Alleghany Mountains a few settlements had been made\r\nbetween 1763 and 1783. But it was after 1783, when streams of emigrants\r\npoured over the mountains, that settlement really began.\r\n\r\n6. In the South cotton was just beginning to be cultivated; there all\r\nlabor was done by slaves. In the North slavery was dying out, and in\r\nfive of the states had been abolished.\r\n\r\nState of the Country in 1790\r\n\r\n- _On the Seaboard._\r\nThe population. {Number.\r\n                {Distribution.\r\n                {Movement west.\r\nThe cities      {Size.\r\n                {Absence of many conveniences known to us.\r\n                {Newspapers and magazines.\r\nCommunication between states. {Bad roads.

Organizing the New Government.%--he President having been\r\ninaugurated, and the new government fairly established, it became the\r\nduty of Congress to enact such laws as were needed immediately. The\r\nfirst act passed by Congress in 1789 was therefore a tariff act laying\r\nduties on goods, wares, and merchandise imported into the United States.\r\nCustomhouses were then established and customs districts marked out, and\r\nports of entry and ports of delivery designated; provision was made for\r\nthe support of lighthouses and beacons; the Ordinance of 1787 for the\r\ngovernment of the territories was slightly changed and reenacted; the\r\ndepartments of State, War, and Treasury were established; and a call was\r\nmade on the Secretary of the Treasury to report a plan for payment of\r\nthe old Continental debt.\r\n\r\n%210. The United States Courts.%--The Constitution declares that the\r\njudicial power of the United States shall be vested in one Supreme Court\r\nand such inferior courts as the Congress may from time to time ordain\r\nand establish. Acting under this power, Congress made provision for a\r\nSupreme Court, consisting of a Chief Justice and five Associate\r\nJustices, and marked out the United States into circuits and districts.\r\nThe circuits were three in number. In the first were the Eastern States;\r\nin the second, the Middle States; and in the third, the Southern States.\r\nTo each were assigned two Justices of the Supreme Court, whose business\r\nit was to go to some city in each state in the circuit, and there, with\r\nthe district judge of that state, hold a circuit court. The district\r\ncourts were thirteen in number, one being established in each state.[1]\r\nWashington appointed John Jay the first Chief Justice of the\r\nSupreme Court.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: For later changes, see Andrews\'s _Manual of the\r\nConstitution,_ p. 183.]\r\n\r\n%211. The Secretaries.%--During the management of affairs by the\r\nContinental Congress three great executive departments had gradually\r\ngrown up and been placed in charge of three men, called the\r\n"Superintendent of Finance," the "Secretary of the United States for the\r\nDepartment of Foreign Affairs," and the "Secretary of War." These the\r\nConstitution recognized in the expression "principal officer in each of\r\nthe executive departments." Congress by law now continued the\r\ndepartments and placed them in charge of a Secretary of the Treasury, a\r\nSecretary of State, and a Secretary of War. Washington filled the\r\noffices promptly, making Alexander Hamilton Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nThomas Jefferson Secretary of State, and General Henry Knox Secretary\r\nof War.\r\n\r\n%212. The "Cabinet."%--It has long been the custom for the President\r\nto gather his secretaries about him on certain days in each week for the\r\npurpose of discussing public measures. To these gatherings has been\r\ngiven the name "Cabinet meetings," while the secretaries have come to be\r\ncalled "Cabinet officers." The Constitution, however, never intended to\r\ngive the President a body of advisers. Indeed, a proposition to provide\r\nhim with a council was voted down in the constitutional convention. But\r\nWashington at once began to consult the Chief Justice, the Vice\r\nPresident, his three secretaries, and the Attorney-general on matters of\r\nimportance. At first he asked their opinions individually and in\r\nwriting, but toward the end of his first term he convened a general\r\nmeeting of the heads of departments, and by so doing set a custom out of\r\nwhich, in time, the "Cabinet" has grown.\r\n\r\n%213. The Origin of the National Debt.%--As soon as Hamilton was made\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, it became his duty, in accordance with an\r\norder from Congress, to prepare a plan for the payment of the debts\r\ncontracted by the Continental Congress. When that body was unexpectedly\r\ncalled on, in May, 1775, to conduct the war, it had nothing with which\r\nto pay expenses, and was forced to use all sorts of means to\r\nraise money.\r\n\r\n[Illustrations: Continental money]\r\n\r\n%214. Paper Money.%--The first resort was the issue, during 1775 and\r\n1776, of six batches of Continental "bills of credit," amounting in all\r\nto $36,000,000. These "bills" were rudely engraved bits of paper,\r\nstating on their face that "This bill entitles the bearer to receive\r\n---- Spanish milled dollars, or the value thereof in gold or silver."\r\nThey were issued in sums of various denominations, from one sixth of a\r\ndollar up, and were to be redeemed by the states. The amount assigned\r\neach state for redemption was in proportion to the supposed number of\r\nits inhabitants.\r\n\r\n%215. Loan-office Certificates.%--In 1776 Congress tried another\r\nmeans. It opened a loan office in each state and called on patriotic\r\npeople to come forward and loan it money, receiving in return pieces of\r\npaper called "loan-office certificates." Interest was to be paid on\r\nthese; but after a while Congress, having no money with which to pay\r\ninterest, was forced to resort to another form of paper, called\r\n"interest indents."\r\n\r\n%216. The Congress Lottery.%--The loan office having failed to bring\r\nin as much money as was needed, Congress, toward the close of 1776, was\r\ndriven to seek some other way, and resorted to a lottery. A certain\r\nnumber of tickets were sold, after which a drawing took place, and all\r\nwho drew prizes were given certificates payable at the end of\r\nfive years.\r\n\r\n%217. More Bills of Credit.%--But the sale of tickets went off so\r\nslowly that Congress had to go back to the issue of bills of credit. In\r\n1777, therefore, the printing press was again put to work, and issues\r\nwere made in rapid succession, till more than $200,000,000 in\r\nContinental paper were in circulation.\r\n\r\n%218. The "New Tenor".%--Then the Continental bills ceased to\r\ncirculate, and in March, 1780, Congress called in the old money and\r\noffered to exchange it for a new issue, giving one dollar of the new\r\npaper money, or "new tenor," for forty dollars of the old. But the\r\nattempt to restore credit by such means was a failure, and by the end of\r\nthe year 1781 all paper money ceased to circulate.\r\n\r\n%219. Certificates.%--Long before this time officials had been forced\r\nto pay debts contracted in the name of Congress with other kinds of\r\npaper, called certificates, and known as treasury, commissary,\r\nquartermaster, marine, and hospital certificates, according to the\r\ndepartment issuing them. To these must be added the "final settlements,"\r\nor certificates given to the soldiers at the end of the war in payment\r\nof their services.\r\n\r\n%220. Foreign Debt.%--Besides the debt thus contracted at home,\r\nCongress had borrowed a great sum in Europe.\r\n\r\n%221. The National Debt in 1790.%--Thus the debt contracted by the\r\nContinental Congress consisted of two parts. 1. The foreign debt, due to\r\nFrance, Holland, and Spain, and amounting, Hamilton found, to\r\n$11,700,000. 2. The domestic or home debt, of $42,000,000. But the\r\nstates had also fallen into debt because of their exertions in the war.\r\nJust how great the state debts were could not be determined, but they\r\nwere estimated to be $21,500,000.\r\n\r\n%222. Assumption and Funding.%--For the redemption of this debt\r\nHamilton prepared two measures,--the funding, or, as we should say, the\r\nbonding, of the foreign and Continental debt, and the assuming and\r\nfunding of the state debts. This was done, and Congress ordered stock\r\nbearing interest to be issued in exchange for the old debts, and so\r\nestablished our national debt, which in 1790 amounted to $75,000,000.\r\n\r\n%223. The National Capital.%--Funding the state debts was strongly\r\nopposed by many congressmen, and was not carried till a bargain was made\r\nby which it was agreed that if enough members from Virginia and\r\nPennsylvania would support the measure to secure its passage through the\r\nHouse of Representatives, the national government should be removed from\r\nNew York to Philadelphia for ten years, and after that to a city to be\r\nbuilt on the Potomac. This was faithfully carried out, and in the summer\r\nof 1790 the government offices were removed to Philadelphia, where they\r\nremained till the summer of 1800, when they were removed to Washington\r\nin the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\n%224. The Bank of the United States.%--The troublesome questions of\r\nfunding and assumption thus disposed of, Congress called on Hamilton for\r\na report on the further support of public credit, and when it met in the\r\nsession of 1790-91, received a plan for a great National Bank, with a\r\ncapital of $10,000,000. The United States was to raise $2,000,000; the\r\nrest was to be subscribed for by the people. The bank was to keep the\r\npublic revenues, was to aid the government in making payments all over\r\nthe country. To do this, power was given to the parent bank (which must\r\nbe at Philadelphia) to establish branches in the chief cities and towns,\r\nand to issue bank bills which should be received all over the United\r\nStates for public lands, taxes, duties, postage, and in payment of any\r\ndebt due the government. Great opposition was made; but the charter was\r\ngranted for twenty years, and in 1791 the Bank of the United States\r\nbegan business.\r\n\r\nThe effect of these two measures, funding the debt and establishing a\r\nbank, was immediate. Confidence and credit were restored. Money that the\r\npeople had long been hiding away was brought out and invested in all\r\nsorts of new enterprises, such as banks, canal companies, manufacturing\r\ncompanies, and turnpike companies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The first Bank of the United States]\r\n\r\n%225. "Federalists" and "Republicans."%--When the Constitution was\r\nbefore the people for acceptance or rejection in 1788, they were divided\r\ninto two bodies. Those who wanted a strong and vigorous federal\r\ngovernment, who wanted Congress to have plenty of power to regulate\r\ntrade, pay the debts of the country, and raise revenue, supported the\r\nConstitution just as it was and were called "Federalists."\r\n\r\nOthers, who wanted the old Articles of Confederation preserved and\r\namended so as to give Congress a revenue and only a little more power,\r\nopposed the Constitution and wanted it altered. To please these\r\n"Anti-Federalists," as they were a large part of the people, Congress,\r\nin 1789, drew up twelve amendments to the Constitution and sent them to\r\nthe states.\r\n\r\nWith the ratification of ten of these amendments, opposition to the\r\nConstitution ceased. But as soon as Congress began to pass laws,\r\ndifference of opinion as to the expediency of them, and even as to the\r\nright of Congress to pass them, divided the people again into two\r\nparties, and sent a good many Federalists into the Anti-Federalist\r\nparty.\r\n\r\nA very large number of men, for instance, opposed the funding of the\r\nContinental Congress debt at its face value, because the people never\r\nhad taken a bill at the value expressed on its face, but at a very much\r\nless value; some opposed the assumption of the state debts, because\r\nCongress, they said, had power to pay the debt of the United States, but\r\nnot state debts; others opposed the National Bank because the\r\nConstitution did not give Congress express power in so many words to\r\ncharter a bank. Others complained that the interest on the national debt\r\nand the great salary of the President ($25,000 a year) and the pay of\r\nCongressmen ($6 a day) and the hundreds of tax collectors made taxes too\r\nheavy. They complained again that men in office showed an undemocratic\r\nfondness for aristocratic customs. The President, they said, was too\r\nexclusive, and owned too fine a coach. The Justices of the Supreme Court\r\nmust have black silk gowns, with red, white, and blue scarfs. The Senate\r\nfor some years to come held its daily session in secret; not even a\r\nnewspaper reporter was allowed to be present.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1792 there were thus a very great number of men in all parts\r\nof the country who were much opposed to the measures of Congress and the\r\nPresident, and who accused the Federalists of wishing to set up a\r\nmonarchy. A great national debt, they said, a funding system, a national\r\nbank, and heavy internal taxes are all monarchical institutions, and if\r\nyou have the institutions, it will not be long before you have the\r\nmonarchy. They began therefore in 1792 to organize for election\r\npurposes, and as they were opposed to a monarchy, they called themselves\r\n"Republicans." [1] Their great leaders were Jefferson, Madison, Monroe,\r\nJohn Randolph, and Albert Gallatin.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This party was the forerunner of the present Democratic\r\nparty.]\r\n\r\n%226. The Whisky Rebellion, 1794.%--One of the taxes to which the\r\nRepublicans objected, that on whisky, led to the first rebellion against\r\nthe government of the United States. In those days, 1791, the farmers\r\nliving in the region around Pittsburg could not send grain or flour down\r\nthe Ohio and the Mississippi, because Spain had shut the Mississippi to\r\nnavigation by Americans. They could not send their flour over the\r\nmountains to Philadelphia or Baltimore, because it cost more to haul it\r\nthere than it would sell for. Instead, therefore, of making flour, they\r\ngrew rye and made whisky on their own farms. This found a ready sale.\r\nNow, when the United States collectors attempted to collect the whisky\r\ntax, the farmers of western Pennsylvania drove them away. An appeal was\r\nthen made to the courts; but when the marshal came to make arrests he,\r\ntoo, was driven away. Under the Articles of Confederation this would\r\nhave been submitted to. But the Constitution and the acts of Congress\r\nwere now "the supreme law of the land," and Washington in his oath of\r\noffice had sworn to see them executed. To accomplish this, he used the\r\npower given him by an act of Congress, and called out 12,900 militia\r\nfrom the neighboring states and marched them to Pittsburg. Then the\r\npeople yielded. Two of the leaders were tried and convicted of treason;\r\nbut Washington pardoned them.\r\n\r\nThe insurrection or rebellion was a small affair. But the principles at\r\nstake were great. It was now shown that the Constitution and the laws\r\nmust be obeyed; that it was treason to resist them by force, and that if\r\nnecessary the people would, at the call of the President, turn out and\r\nput down rebellion by force of arms.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Read McMaster\'s _History of the People of the United\r\nStates_, Vol. II., pp. 189-204; Findley\'s _History of the Insurrection\r\nin Pennsylvania_.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\n1. As soon as Washington was inaugurated, Congress proceeded to organize\r\nthe new government.\r\n\r\n2. The Supreme Court and circuit and district courts were established.\r\n\r\n3. The departments of State, War, and Treasury were formed.\r\n\r\n4. Twelve amendments to the Constitution were proposed.\r\n\r\n5. Three financial measures were adopted:\r\n    A. A tariff act was passed.\r\n    B. The debts of the states were assumed, and, with that of the\r\n       Continental Congress, funded.\r\n    C. A national bank was chartered.\r\n\r\n6. The price of funding was the ultimate location of the national\r\ncapital on the Potomac.\r\n\r\n7. The first census was taken in 1790.\r\n\r\n8. The result of the financial measures of Congress was the rise of the\r\nRepublican party (the forerunner of the present Democratic party).\r\n\r\n                    THE ORIGIN OF POLITICAL PARTIES\r\n/--------------------------------------------------------------------\\\r\n\r\n   Funding the\r\n Continental Debt.\r\n  /------------\\\r\n                 / Money borrowed in  \\ Shall it be \\\r\n  Foreign debt.  | France, Holland,   | funded at   | Yes ------+\r\n                 \\ and Spain.         / face value? /           |\r\n                                                                |\r\n                 / Bills of credit.   \\                         |\r\n                 | Loan-office        |                         |\r\n                 |   certificates.    | Shall it be \\           |\r\n                 | Lottery            | funded at   | Yes ----+ |\r\n  Domestic debt. |   certificates.    | face value  /         | |\r\n                 | Interest indents.  | or market   \\         | |\r\n                 | New tenor.         | value?      / Yes --+ | |\r\n                 | Certificates of    |                     | | |\r\n                 |   officials.       |                     | | |\r\n                 \\ Final settlements. /                     | | | \\\r\n                                                            | | | |\r\nAssumption of    / Yes ---------------------------------------+-+ |[1]\r\n  state debts.   \\ No ----------------------------------+   |   | |\r\n                                                        |   |   | /\r\nEstablishment    / Yes -----------------------------------------+\r\n  of a national  |                                      |   |\r\n  bank.          \\ No ------------------------------------+ |\r\n                                                        | | |\r\nInternal revenue / Too heavy ----------------------- \\  | | |\r\ntaxes.           \\                                   |  | | |\r\n                                                     |  | | |\r\n                 /                / President too    |  | | |\r\n                 |                |   exclusive.     |  | | | \\\r\n                 | Aristocratic   | Secret sessions  |  | | | |\r\nAdministration   | customs.       |   of the Senate. |--+-+-+ |[2]\r\nnot democratic.  |                | Gowns of the     |        |\r\n                 |                \\   justices.      |        /\r\n                 | Monarchial     / Great debt.      |\r\n                 |  institutions. | National bank.   |\r\n                 \\                \\ Heavy taxes.     /\r\n\r\n        \\             /   Leaders.\r\n  [1]---| Federalists | Washington.\r\n        /             | Adams.\r\n                      \\ Hamilton.\r\n\r\n        \\             /   Leaders.\r\n        |             | Jefferson.\r\n  [2]---| Republicans | Madison.\r\n        |             | Monroe.\r\n        |             | Randolph.\r\n        /             \\ Gallatin.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE STRUGGLE FOR NEUTRALITY\r\n\r\n%227. Trouble with Great Britain and France.%--From the congressional\r\nelection in 1792 we may date the beginning of organized political\r\nparties in the United States. They sprang from differences of opinion as\r\nto domestic matters. But on a sudden in 1793 Federalists and Republicans\r\nbecame divided on questions of foreign affairs.\r\n\r\nEver since 1789 France had been in a state of revolution, and at last\r\n(in 1792) the people established the French Republic, cut off the heads\r\nof the King and Queen (in 1793), and declared war on England and sent a\r\nminister, Genet, to the United States. At that time we had no treaty\r\nwith Great Britain except the treaty of peace. With France, however, we\r\nhad two treaties,--one of alliance, and one of amity and commerce. The\r\ntreaty of alliance bound us to guarantee to France "the possessions of\r\nthe crown of France in America," by which were meant the French West\r\nIndian Islands. When Washington heard that war had been declared by\r\nFrance, and that a French minister was on his way to America, he became\r\nalarmed lest this minister should call on him to make good the guarantee\r\nby sending a fleet to the Indies. On consulting his secretaries, they\r\nadvised him that the guarantee applied only when France was attacked,\r\nand not when she was the attacking party. The President thereupon issued\r\na proclamation of neutrality; that is, declared that the United States\r\nwould not side with either party in the war, but would treat both alike.\r\n\r\n%228. Sympathy for France; the French Craze.%--Then began a long\r\nstruggle for neutrality. The Republicans were very angry at Washington\r\nand denounced him violently. France, they said, had been our old friend;\r\nGreat Britain had been our old enemy. We had a treaty with France; we\r\nhad none with Great Britain. To treat her on the same footing with\r\nFrance was therefore a piece of base ingratitude to France. A wave of\r\nsympathy for France swept over the country. The French dress, customs,\r\nmanners, came into use. Republicans ceased to address each other as Mr.\r\nSmith, Mr. Jones, Sir, or "Your Honor," and used Citizen Smith and\r\nCitizen Jones. The French tricolor with the red liberty cap was hung up\r\nin taverns and coffeehouses, which were the clubhouses of that day.\r\nEvery French victory was made the occasion of a "civic feast," while the\r\nanniversaries of the fall of the Bastile and of the founding of the\r\nRepublic were kept in every great city.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Read McMaster\'s _History of the People of the United\r\nStates_, Vol. II., pp. 89-96; _Harpers Magazine_, April, 1897.]\r\n\r\n%229. England seizes our Ships; the Rule of 1756%.--To preserve\r\nneutrality in the face of such a public sentiment was hard enough; but\r\nGreat Britain made it more difficult yet. When war was declared, France\r\nopened the ports of her West Indian Islands and invited neutral nations\r\nto trade with them. This she did because she knew that the British navy\r\ncould drive her merchantmen from the sea, and that all trade between\r\nherself and her colonies must be carried on in the ships of\r\nneutral nations.\r\n\r\nNow the merchants of the United States had never been allowed to trade\r\nwith the French Indies to an unlimited extent. The moment, therefore,\r\nthey were allowed to do so, they gladly began to trade, and during the\r\nsummer of 1793 hundreds of ships went to the islands. There were at that\r\ntime four questions of dispute between us and Great Britain:\r\n\r\n1. Great Britain held that she might seize any kind of food going to a\r\nFrench port in our ships. We held that only military stores might be\r\nso seized.\r\n\r\n2. Great Britain held that when a port had been declared to be\r\nblockaded, a ship bound to that port might be seized even on the high\r\nseas. We held that no port was blockaded unless there was a fleet\r\nactually stationed at it to prevent ships from entering or leaving it.\r\n\r\n3. Great Britain held that our ships might be captured if they had\r\nFrench goods on board. We held that "free ships made free goods," and\r\nthat our ships were not subject to capture, no matter whose goods they\r\nhad on board.\r\n\r\n4. Great Britain in 1756 had adopted a rule that no neutral should have\r\nin time of war a trade she did not have in time of peace.\r\n\r\nThe United States was now enjoying a trade in time of war she did not\r\nhave in time of peace, and Great Britain began to enforce her rule.\r\nBritish ships were ordered to stop American vessels going to or coming\r\nfrom the French West Indies, and if they contained provisions, to seize\r\nthem. This was done, and in the autumn of 1793 great numbers of American\r\nships were captured.\r\n\r\n%230. Our Sailors impressed.%--All this was bad enough and excited\r\nthe people against our old enemy, who made matters a thousand times\r\nworse by a course of action to which we could not possibly submit. She\r\nclaimed the right to stop any of our ships on the sea, send an officer\r\non board, force the captain to muster the crew on the deck, and then\r\nsearch for British subjects. If one was found, he was seized and carried\r\naway. If none were found, and the British ships wanted men, native-born\r\nAmericans were taken off under the pretext that one could not tell an\r\nAmerican from an English sailor. Our fathers could stand a great deal,\r\nbut this was too much, and a cry for war went up from all parts of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nBut Washington did not want war, and took two measures to prevent it.\r\nHe persuaded Congress to lay an embargo for thirty days, that is, forbid\r\nall ships to leave our ports, and induced the Senate to let him send\r\nJohn Jay, the Chief Justice, to London to make a treaty of amity and\r\ncommerce with Great Britain.\r\n\r\n%231. Jay\'s Treaty, 1794.%--In this mission Jay succeeded; and though\r\nthe treaty was far from what Washington wanted, it was the best that\r\ncould be had, and he approved it.[1] At this the Republicans grew\r\nfurious. They burned copies of the treaty at mass meetings and hung Jay\r\nin effigy. Yet the treaty had some good features. By it the King agreed\r\nto withdraw his troops from Oswego and Detroit and Mackinaw, which\r\nreally belonged to us but were still occupied by the English. By it our\r\nmerchants were allowed for the first time to trade with the British West\r\nIndies, and some compensation was made for the damage done by the\r\ncapture of ships in the West Indies.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Senate ratified this treaty in the summer of 1795.]\r\n\r\n%232. Treaty with Spain.%--About the same time (October, 1795) we\r\nmade our first treaty with Spain, and induced her to accept the\r\nthirty-first degree of latitude as the south boundary of our country,\r\nand to consent to open the Mississippi to trade. As Spain owned both\r\nbanks at the mouth of the river, she claimed that American ships had no\r\nright to go in or out without her consent, and so prevented the people\r\nof Kentucky and Tennessee from trading in foreign markets. She now\r\nagreed that they might float their produce to New Orleans and pay a\r\nsmall duty, and then ship it wherever they pleased.\r\n\r\n%233. The Election of Adams and Jefferson, 1796%.--Washington had\r\nbeen re\xc3\xablected President in 1792, but he was now tired of office, and in\r\nSeptember, 1796, issued his "Farewell Address," in which he declined to\r\nbe the candidate for a third presidential term. In those days there were\r\nno national conventions to nominate candidates, yet it was well\r\nunderstood that John Adams, the Vice President, was the candidate of the\r\nFederalists, and Thomas Jefferson, of the Republicans. When the votes\r\nwere counted in Congress, it was found that Adams had 71 electoral\r\nvotes, and Jefferson 68; so they became President and Vice President.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: John Adams]\r\n\r\n%234. Trouble with France.%--Adams was inaugurated on March 4, 1797,\r\nand three days later heard that C. C. Pinckney, our minister to the\r\nFrench Republic, had been driven from France. Pinckney had been sent to\r\nFrance by Washington in 1796, but the French Directory (as the five men\r\nwho then governed France were called) had taken great offense at Jay\'s\r\ntreaty: first because it was favorable to Great Britain, and in the\r\nsecond place because it put an end for the present to all hope of war\r\nbetween her and the United States. The Directory, therefore, refused to\r\nreceive Pinckney until the French grievances were redressed.\r\n\r\nThe President was very angry at the insult, and summoned Congress to\r\nmeet and take such action as, said he, "shall convince France and the\r\nwhole world that we are not a degraded people humiliated under a\r\ncolonial spirit of fear and sense of inferiority." But the Republicans\r\ndeclared so vigorously that if a special mission were sent to France all\r\nwould be made right, that Adams yielded, and sent John Marshall and\r\nElbridge Gerry to join Pinckney as envoys extraordinary. On reaching\r\nParis, three men acting as agents for the Directory met them, and\r\ndeclared that before they could be received as ministers they must do\r\nthree things:\r\n\r\n1. Apologize for Adams\'s denunciation of the conduct of France.\r\n2. Pay each Director $50,000.\r\n3. Pay tribute to France.\r\n\r\nWhen the President reported this demand to Congress, the names of the\r\nthree French agents were suppressed, and instead they were called Mr. X,\r\nMr. Y, Mr. Z. This gave the mission the nickname "X, Y, Z mission."\r\n\r\n%235. "Millions for Defense, not a Cent for Tribute."%--As the\r\nnewspapers published these dispatches, a roar of indignation, in which\r\nthe Federalists and Republicans alike joined, went up from the whole\r\ncountry. "Millions for defense, not a cent for tribute," became the\r\nwatchword of the hour. Opposition in Congress ceased, and preparations\r\nwere at once made for war. The French treaties were suspended. The Navy\r\nDepartment was created, and a Secretary of the Navy appointed. Frigates\r\nwere ordered to be built, money was voted for arms, a provisional army\r\nwas formed, and Washington was again made commander in chief, with the\r\nrank of lieutenant general. The young men associated for defense, the\r\npeople in the seaports built frigates or sloops of war, and gave their\r\nservices to erect forts and earthworks. Every French flag was now pulled\r\ndown from the coffeehouses, and the black cockade of our own\r\nRevolutionary days was once more worn as the badge of patriotism. Then\r\nwas written, by Joseph Hopkinson of Philadelphia,[1] and sung for the\r\nfirst time, our national song _Hail, Columbia!_\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The music to which we sing _Hail, Columbia!_ was called\r\n_The President\'s March_, and was played for the first time when the\r\npeople of Trenton were welcoming Washington on his way to be inaugurated\r\nPresident in 1789. For an account of the trouble with France read\r\nMcMaster\'s _History of the People of the United States_, Vol. II, pp.\r\n207-416, 427-476.]\r\n\r\n%236. The Alien and Sedition Acts.%--Carried away by the excitement\r\nof the hour, the Federalists now passed two most unwise laws. Many of\r\nthe active leaders and very many of the members of the Republican party\r\nwere men born abroad and naturalized in this country. Generally they\r\nwere Irishmen or Frenchmen, and as such had good reason to hate England,\r\nand therefore hated the Federalists, who they believed were too friendly\r\nto her. To prevent such becoming voters, and so taking an active part in\r\npolitics, the Federalists passed a new naturalization law, which forbade\r\nany foreigner to become an American citizen until he had lived fourteen\r\nyears in our country. Lest this should not be enough to keep them\r\nquiet, a second law was passed by which the President had power for two\r\nyears to send any alien (any of these men who for fourteen years could\r\nnot become citizens) out of the country whenever he thought it proper.\r\nThis law Adams never used.\r\n\r\nFor five years past the Republican newspapers had been abusing\r\nWashington, Adams, the acts of Congress, the members of Congress, and\r\nthe whole foreign policy of the Federalists. The Federalist newspapers,\r\nof course, had retaliated and had been just as abusive of the\r\nRepublicans. But as the Federalists now had the power, they determined\r\nto punish the Republicans for their abuse, and passed the Sedition Act.\r\nThis provided that any man who acted seditiously (that is, interfered\r\nwith the execution of a law of Congress) or spoke or wrote seditiously\r\n(that is, abused the President, or Congress, or any member of the\r\nFederal government) should be tried, and if found guilty, be fined and\r\nimprisoned. This law was used, and used vigorously, and Republican\r\neditors all over the country were fined and sometimes imprisoned.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Alien and Sedition acts are in Preston\'s _Documents_,\r\npp. 277-282.]\r\n\r\n%237. Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions.%--The passage of these Alien\r\nand Sedition laws greatly excited the Republicans, and led Jefferson to\r\nuse his influence to have them condemned by the states. For this purpose\r\nhe wrote a set of resolutions and sent them to a friend in Kentucky who\r\nwas to try to have the legislature adopt them.[2] Jefferson next asked\r\nMadison to write a like set of resolutions for the Virginia legislature\r\nto adopt. Madison became so interested that he gave up his seat in\r\nCongress and entered the Virginia legislature, and in December, 1798,\r\ninduced it to adopt what have since been known as the Virginia\r\nResolutions of 1798.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Kentucky had been admitted to the Union in 1792 (see p.\r\n213).]\r\n\r\nMeantime the legislature of Kentucky, November, 1798, had adopted the\r\nresolutions of Jefferson.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: E. D. Warfield\'s _Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions_. The\r\nResolutions are printed in Preston\'s _Documents_, pp. 283-298;\r\n_Jefferson\'s Works_, Vol. IX., p. 494.]\r\n\r\nBoth sets declare 1. That the Constitution of the United States is a\r\ncompact or contract. 2. That to this contract each state is a party;\r\nthat is, the united states are equal partners in a great political firm.\r\nSo far they agree; but at this point they differ. The Kentucky\r\nResolutions assert that when any question arises as to the right of\r\nCongress to pass any law, _each state_ may decide this question for\r\nitself and apply any remedy it likes. The Virginia Resolutions declare\r\nthat _the states_ may judge and apply the remedy.\r\n\r\nBoth declared that the Alien and Sedition laws were wholly\r\nunconstitutional. Seven states answered by declaring that the laws were\r\nconstitutional, whereupon Kentucky in 1799 framed another set of\r\nresolutions in which she said that when a state thought a law to be\r\nillegal she had the right to nullify it; that is, forbid her citizens to\r\nobey it. This doctrine of nullification, as we shall see, afterwards\r\nbecame of very serious importance.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The answers of the states are printed in Elliot\'s\r\n_Debates_, Vol. IV., pp. 532-539.]\r\n\r\n%238. The Naval War with France.%--Meantime war opened with France.\r\nThe Navy Department was created in April, 1798, and before the year\r\nended, a gallant little navy of thirty-four frigates, corvettes, and gun\r\nsloops of war had been collected and sent with a host of privateers to\r\nscour the sea around the French West Indies, destroy French commerce,\r\nand capture French ships of war.[1] One of our frigates, the\r\n_Constellation_, Captain Thomas Truxton in command, captured the French\r\nfrigate _Insurgente_, after a gallant fight. On another occasion,\r\nTruxton, in the _Constellation_, fought the _Vengeance_ and would have\r\ntaken her, but the Frenchman, finding he was getting much the worst of\r\nit, spread his sails and fled. Yet another of our frigates, the\r\n_Boston_, took the _Berceau_, whose flag is now in the Naval Institute\r\nBuilding at Annapolis. In six months the little American twelve-gun\r\nschooner _Enterprise_ took eight French privateers, and recaptured and\r\nset free four American merchantmen. These and a hundred other actions\r\njust as gallant made good the patriotic words of John Adams, "that we\r\nare not a degraded people humiliated under a colonial spirit of fear and\r\nsense of inferiority." So impressed was France with this fact that the\r\nwar had scarcely begun when the Directory meekly sent word that if\r\nanother set of ministers came they would be received. They ought to have\r\nbeen told that they must send a mission to us. But Adams in this respect\r\nwas weak, and in 1800, the Chief Justice, Oliver Ellsworth, William R.\r\nDavie, and William Vans Murray were sent to Paris. The Directory had\r\nthen fallen from power, Napoleon was ruling France as First Consul, and\r\nwith him in September, 1800, a convention was concluded.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: For an account of this war, read Maclay\'s _History of the\r\nUnited States Navy_, Vol. I., pp. 155-213.]\r\n\r\n%239. The Stamp Tax; the Direct Tax and Fries\'s Rebellion,\r\n1798.%--The heavy cost of the preparations for war made new taxes\r\nnecessary. Two of these, a stamp tax very similar to the famous one of\r\n1765, and a direct tax, greatly excited the people. The direct tax was\r\nthe first of its kind in our history, and was laid on lands, houses, and\r\nnegro slaves. In certain counties of eastern Pennsylvania, where the\r\npopulation was chiefly German, the purpose of the tax was not\r\nunderstood, and the people refused to make returns of the value of their\r\nfarms and houses. When the assessors came to measure the houses and\r\ncount the windows as a means of determining the value of the property,\r\nthe people drove them off. For this some of the leaders were arrested.\r\nBut the people under John Fries rose and rescued the prisoners. At this\r\nstage President Adams called out the militia, and marched it against the\r\nrebels. They yielded. But Fries was tried for treason, was sentenced to\r\nbe hanged, and was then pardoned. Thus a second time was it proved that\r\nthe people of the United States were determined to support the\r\nConstitution and the laws and put down rebellion.\r\n\r\n%240. Washington the National Capital.%--In accordance with the\r\nbargain made in 1790, Washington selected a site for the Federal city\r\non both banks of the Potomac. This great square tract of land was ten\r\nmiles long on each side, and was given to the government partly by\r\nMaryland and partly by Virginia.[1] It was called the District of\r\nColumbia, and in it were marked out the streets of Washington city.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In 1846 so much of the District as had belonged to Virginia\r\nwas given back to her.]\r\n\r\nThough all possible haste was made, the President\'s house was still\r\nunfinished, the Capitol but partly built, and the streets nothing but\r\nroads cut through the woods, when, in the summer of 1800, the\r\nsecretaries, the clerks, the books and papers of the government left\r\nPhiladelphia for Washington. With the opening of the new century, and\r\nthe occupation of the new Capitol, came a new President, and a new party\r\nin control of the government.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The National Capitol as it was in 1825]\r\n\r\n%241. The Election of Thomas Jefferson.%--The year 1800 was a\r\npresidential year, and though no formal nomination was made, a caucus of\r\nRepublican leaders selected as candidates Thomas Jefferson for\r\nPresident, and Aaron Burr for Vice President. A caucus or meeting of\r\nFederalist leaders selected John Adams and C. C. Pinckney as their\r\ncandidates. When the returns were all in, it appeared that Jefferson had\r\nreceived seventy-three votes, Burr seventy-three votes, Adams sixty-five\r\nvotes, Pinckney sixty-four votes. The Constitution provided that the man\r\nwho received the highest number of electoral votes, if the choice of\r\nthe majority of the electors, should be President. But as Jefferson and\r\nBurr had each seventy-three, neither had the highest, and neither was\r\nPresident. The duty of electing a President then devolved on the House\r\nof Representatives, which after a long and bitter struggle elected\r\nJefferson President; Burr then became Vice President. To prevent such a\r\ncontest ever arising again, the twelfth amendment was added to the\r\nConstitution. This provides for a separate ballot for Vice President.\r\nMarch 4, 1801, Jefferson, escorted by the militia of Georgetown and\r\nAlexandria, walked from his lodgings to the Senate chamber and took the\r\noath of office.{1} He and his party had been placed in power in order to\r\nmake certain reforms, and this, when Congress met in the winter of 1801,\r\nthey began to do.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: For a fine description of Jefferson\'s personality, read\r\nHenry Adams\'s _History of the United States_, Vol. I., pp. 185-191. As\r\nto the story of Jefferson riding alone to the Capitol and tying his\r\nhorse to the fence, see Adams\'s _History_, Vol. I, pp. 196-199;\r\nMcMaster\'s _History_, Vol. II., pp. 533-534.]\r\n\r\n%242. The Annual Message.%--While Washington and Adams were\r\npresidents, it was their custom when Congress met each year to go in\r\nstate to the House of Representatives, and in the presence of the House\r\nand Senate read a speech. The two branches of Congress would then\r\nseparate and appoint committees to answer the President\'s speech, and\r\nwhen the answers were ready, each would march through the streets to the\r\nPresident\'s house, where the Vice President or the Speaker would read\r\nthe answer to the President. When Congress met in 1801, Jefferson\r\ndropped this custom and sent a written message to both houses--a\r\npractice which every President since that time has followed.\r\n\r\n%243. Republican Reforms.%--True to their promises, the Republicans\r\nnow proceeded to repeal the hated laws of the Federalists. They sold all\r\nthe ships of the navy except thirteen, they ordered prosecutions under\r\nthe Sedition law to be stopped, they repealed all the internal taxes\r\nlaid by the Federalists, they cut down the army to 2500 men, and\r\nreduced the expenses of government to $3,700,000 per year--a sum which\r\nwould not now pay the cost of running the government for three days. As\r\nthe annual revenue collected at the customhouses, the post office, and\r\nfrom the sale of land was $10,800,000, the treasury had some $7,000,000\r\nof surplus each year. This was used to pay the national debt, which fell\r\nfrom $88,000,000 in 1801 to $45,000,000 in 1812, and this in spite of\r\nthe purchase of Louisiana.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Thomas Jefferson]\r\n\r\n%244. The Purchase of Louisiana.%--When France was driven out of\r\nAmerica, it will be remembered, she gave to Spain all of Louisiana west\r\nof the Mississippi River, together with a large tract on the east bank,\r\nat the river\'s mouth. Spain then owned Louisiana till 1800, when by a\r\nsecret treaty she gave the province back to France.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Adams\'s _History of the United States, _Vol. I., pp.\r\n352-376.]\r\n\r\nFor a while this treaty was really kept secret; but in April, 1802, news\r\nthat Louisiana had been given to France and that Napoleon was going to\r\nsend out troops to hold it, reached this country and produced two\r\nconsequences. In the first place, it led the Spanish intendant (as the\r\nman who had charge of all commercial matters was called) to withdraw the\r\n"right of deposit" at New Orleans, and so prevent citizens of the United\r\nStates sending their produce out of the Mississippi River. In the second\r\nplace, this act of the intendant excited the rage of all the settlers in\r\nthe valley from Pittsburg to Natchez, and made them demand the instant\r\nseizure of New Orleans by American troops. To prevent this, Jefferson\r\nobtained the consent of Congress to make an effort to buy New Orleans\r\nand West Florida, and sent Monroe to aid our minister in France in\r\nmaking the purchase.\r\n\r\nWhen the offer was made, Napoleon was about going to war with England,\r\nand, wanting money very much, he in turn offered to sell the whole\r\nprovince to the United States--an offer that was gladly accepted. The\r\nprice paid was $15,000,000, and in December, 1803, Louisiana was\r\nformally delivered to us.\r\n\r\n%245. Louisiana.%--Concerning this splendid domain hardly anything\r\nwas known. No boundaries were given to it either on the north, or on the\r\nwest, or on the south. What the country was like nobody could tell.[1]\r\nWhere the source of the Mississippi was no white man knew. In the time\r\nof La Salle a priest named Hennepin had gone up to the spot where\r\nMinneapolis now stands, and had seen the Falls of St. Anthony (p. 63).\r\nBut the country above the falls was still unknown.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In a description of it which Jefferson sent to Congress in\r\n1804, he actually stated that "there exists about one thousand miles up\r\nthe Missouri, and not far from that river, a salt mountain. This\r\nmountain is said to be one hundred and eighty miles long and forty-five\r\nin width, composed of solid rock salt, without any trees or even\r\nshrubs on it."]\r\n\r\n%246. Explorations of Lewis and Clark.%--That this great region ought\r\nto be explored had been a favorite idea of Jefferson for twenty years\r\npast, and he had tried to persuade learned men and learned societies to\r\norganize an expedition to cross the continent. Failing in this, he\r\nturned to Congress, which in 1803 (before the purchase of Louisiana)\r\nvoted a sum of money for sending an exploring party from the mouth of\r\nthe Missouri to the Pacific. The party was in charge of Meriwether Lewis\r\nand William Clark. Early in May, 1804, they left St. Louis, then a\r\nfrontier town of log cabins, and worked their way up the Missouri River\r\nto a spot not far from the present city of Bismarck, North Dakota, where\r\nthey passed the winter with the Indians. Resuming their journey in the\r\nspring of 1805, they followed the Missouri to its source in the\r\nmountains, after crossing which they came to the Clear Water River; and\r\ndown this they went to the Columbia, which carried them to a spot where,\r\nlate in November, 1805, they "saw the waves like small mountains rolling\r\nout in the sea." They were on the shores of the Pacific Ocean. After\r\nspending the winter at the mouth of the Columbia, the party made its way\r\nback to St. Louis in 1806.\r\n\r\n%247. The Oregon Country.%--Lewis and Clark were not the first of our\r\ncountrymen to see the Columbia River. In 1792 a Boston ship captain\r\nnamed Gray was trading with the Pacific coast Indians. He was collecting\r\nfurs to take to China and exchange for tea to be carried to Boston, and\r\nwhile so engaged he discovered the mouth of a great river, which he\r\nentered, and named the Columbia in honor of his ship. By right of this\r\ndiscovery by Gray the United States was entitled to all the country\r\ndrained by the Columbia River. By the exploration of this country by\r\nLewis and Clark our title was made stronger still, and it was finally\r\nperfected a few years later when the trappers and settlers went over the\r\nRocky Mountains and occupied the Oregon country.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Barrows\'s _Oregon_; McMaster\'s _History_, Vol. II., pp.\r\n633-635.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mouth of the Columbia River]\r\n\r\n%248. Pike explores the Southwest.%--While Lewis and Clark were\r\nmaking their way up the Missouri, Zebulon Pike was sent to find the\r\nsource of the Mississippi, which he thought he did in the winter of\r\n1805-06. In this he was mistaken, but supposing his work done, he was\r\ndispatched on another expedition in 1806. Traveling up the Missouri\r\nRiver to the Osage, and up the Osage nearly to its source, he struck\r\nacross Kansas to the Arkansas River, which he followed to its head\r\nwaters, wandering in the neighborhood of that fine mountain which in\r\nhonor of him bears the name of Pikes Peak. Then he crossed the mountains\r\nand began a search for the Red River. The march was a terrible one. It\r\nwas winter; the cold was intense. The snow lay waist deep on the plains.\r\nOften the little band was without food for two days at a time. But Pike\r\npushed on, in spite of hunger, cold, and suffering, and at last saw,\r\nthrough a gap in the mountains, the waters of the Rio Grande. Believing\r\nthat it was the Red, he hurried to its banks, only to be seized by the\r\nSpaniards (for he was on Spanish soil), who carried him a prisoner to\r\nSanta F\xc3\xa9, from which city he and his men wandered back to the United\r\nStates by way of Mexico and Texas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: %EXPLORATION OF THE SOUTHWEST% BY ZEBULON M. PIKE\r\n%1806-1807%]\r\n\r\n%249. Astoria founded.%--The immediate effect of these explorations\r\nwas greatly to stimulate the fur trade. One great fur trader, John Jacob\r\nAstor of New York, now founded the Pacific Fur Company and made\r\npreparations to establish a line of posts from the upper Missouri to the\r\nColumbia, and along it to the Pacific, and supply them from St. Louis by\r\nway of the Missouri, or from the mouth of the Columbia, where in 1811 a\r\nlittle trading post was begun and named Astoria. This completed our\r\nclaim to the Oregon country. Gray had discovered the river; Lewis and\r\nClark had explored the territory drained by the river; the Pacific Fur\r\nCompany planted the first lasting settlement.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\n1. In 1793 France made war on Great Britain. The United States was bound\r\nby the treaty of alliance of 1778 to "guarantee" the French possessions\r\nin America.\r\n\r\n2. This treaty, and the coming of the French minister, forced Washington\r\nto declare the United States neutral in the war.\r\n\r\n3. His proclamation of neutrality was resented by the Republicans, who\r\nnow became sympathizers with France. The Federalists, who were strongest\r\nin the commercial states, became the anti-French or English party.\r\n\r\n4. When France declared war on England, she opened her ports in the West\r\nIndies to the merchant trade of the United States.\r\n\r\n5. England held that we should not have a trade with France when at war,\r\nfor we had not had it when France was at peace. This was an application\r\nof the "Rule of 1756." In 1793-1794, therefore, England began to seize\r\nour ships coming from the French ports.\r\n\r\n6. This so excited the Republicans that they attempted to force the\r\ncountry into war with England.\r\n\r\n7. To prevent war, Washington sent Jay to London, where he made our\r\nfirst commercial treaty with Great Britain.\r\n\r\n8. This offended the French Directory, who refused to receive our new\r\nminister and sent him out of France.\r\n\r\n9. War with France now seemed likely. But Adams, in the interest of\r\npeace, sent three commissioners to Paris to make a new treaty. They were\r\nmet with demands for tribute and came home.\r\n\r\n10. The greatest excitement now prevailed in the country. The Navy\r\nDepartment was created, a navy was built by the people, and a\r\nprovisional army raised. The old French treaties were suspended, and a\r\nnaval war began.\r\n\r\n11. The popular anger against the Republicans (the French party) gave\r\nthe Federalists control of Congress, whereupon they passed the Alien and\r\nSedition laws.\r\n\r\n12. Against these Virginia and Kentucky protested in a set of\r\nresolutions.\r\n\r\n13. In the election of 1800 the Federalists were defeated, and the\r\nRepublicans secured control of the Federal government.\r\n\r\n14. In 1800 Spain ceded Louisiana to France, whereupon the Spanish\r\nofficial at New Orleans shut the Mississippi to American commerce.\r\n\r\n15. The whole West cried out against this and demanded war. But\r\nJefferson offered to buy West Florida from France. Napoleon thereupon\r\noffered to sell all Louisiana, and we bought it (1803).\r\n\r\n16. The new territory as yet had no boundaries; but it was explored in\r\nthe northwest by Lewis and Clark, and in the southwest by Pike.\r\n\r\n17. The discovery of the Columbia River in 1792, the exploration of the\r\ncountry by Lewis and Clark, and the founding of Astoria established our\r\nclaim to the Oregon country.\r\n\r\n                   FRANCE A REPUBLIC, 1792.\r\n                   ------------------------\r\n                              |\r\n                ______________|________________\r\n                DECLARES WAR ON ENGLAND (1793).\r\n                              |\r\n        ______________________|___________________________\r\n        |                                                 |\r\n        |                                                 |\r\n   Opens her ports                                        |\r\n   to neutral trade.

France and Great Britain renew the War.%--The war between\r\nFrance and Great Britain, which had been the cause of the sale of\r\nLouisiana to us, began in May, 1803. The United States became again a\r\nneutral power, but, as in 1793, was soon once more involved in the\r\ndisputes of France.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the previous war, Great Britain had so changed her\r\nideas of neutrality that the merchants of the United States, according\r\nto her rules,\r\n\r\n1. Could trade directly between a port of the United States and the\r\nports of the French West Indies.\r\n\r\n2. Could trade directly between the United States and ports in France or\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n3. But could not trade directly between a French West India island and\r\nFrance, or a Spanish West India island and Spain, or a Dutch colony\r\nand Holland.\r\n\r\nTo evade this last restriction, by combining the voyages allowed in\r\nnumbers 1 and 2, was easy. A merchant had but to load his ship at New\r\nYork or Philadelphia, go to some port in the French West Indies, take on\r\na new cargo and bring it to Savannah, enter it at the customhouse and\r\npay the import duties. This voyage was covered by number 1. He could\r\nthen, without disturbing his cargo in the least, clear his vessel for\r\nFrance, and get back from the collector of customs all the duty he had\r\npaid except three per cent. He was now exporting goods from the United\r\nStates and was protected by number 2. This was called "the broken\r\nvoyage," and by using it thousands of shipowners were enabled to carry\r\ngoods back and forth between France and her colonies, by merely stopping\r\na few hours at an American port to clear for Europe. So universal was\r\nthis practice that in 1804 the customs revenue rose from $16,000,000 to\r\n$20,000,000.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1805, however, the British High Court of Admiralty decided that\r\ngoods which started from the French colonies in American ships and were\r\non their way to France could be captured even if they had been landed\r\nand reshipped in the United States. The moment that decision was made,\r\nthe old trouble began again. British frigates were stationed off the\r\nports of New York and Hampton Roads, and vessels coming in and going out\r\nwere stopped, searched, and their sailors impressed. Before 1805 ended,\r\n116 of our ships had been seized and 1000 of our sailors impressed.\r\n\r\n%251. Orders in Council, 1806.%--In 1806 matters grew worse. Napoleon\r\nwas master of Europe, and in order to injure Great Britain he cut off\r\nher trade with the continent. For this she retaliated by issuing, in\r\nMay, 1806, an Order in Council, which declared the whole coast of\r\nEurope, from Brest to the mouth of the river Elbe, to be blockaded. This\r\nwas a mere "paper blockade"; that is, no fleets were off the coast to\r\nkeep neutrals from running into the blockaded ports. Yet American\r\nvessels were captured at sea because they were going to those ports.\r\n\r\n%252. The Berlin Decree.%--Napoleon waited to retaliate till\r\nNovember, 1806, when he issued the Berlin Decree,[1] declaring the\r\nBritish Islands to be blockaded.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: So called because he was at Berlin when he issued it.]\r\n\r\n%253. Orders in Council, 1807.%--Great Britain felt that every time\r\nNapoleon struck at her she must strike back at him, and in January,\r\n1807, a new Order in Council forbade neutrals to trade from one European\r\nport to another, if both were in the possession of France or her allies.\r\nFinding it had no effect, she followed it up with another Order in\r\nCouncil in November, 1807, which declared that every port on the face\r\nof the earth from which for any reason British ships were excluded was\r\nshut to neutrals, unless they first stopped at some British port and\r\nobtained a license to trade.\r\n\r\n%254. The Milan Decree, 1807.%--It was now Napoleon\'s turn to strike,\r\nwhich he did in December, 1807, by issuing the Milan Decree.[1]\r\nThenceforth any ship that submitted to be searched by British cruisers\r\nor took out a British license, or entered any port from which French\r\nships were excluded, was to be captured wherever found.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: So called because he was in Milan at the time, and dated it\r\nfrom that city.]\r\n\r\nAs a result of this series of French Decrees and British Orders in\r\nCouncil,[2] the English took 194 of our ships, and the French almost\r\nas many.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: On the Orders in Council and French Decrees, read Adams\'s\r\n_History of the United States_, Vol. III., Chap. 16; Vol. IV., Chaps. 4,\r\n5, and 6; McMaster\'s _History_, Vol. III., pp. 219-223;\r\n249-250; 272-274.]\r\n\r\n%255. Jefferson\'s Policy; Non-importation Act.%--The policy by which\r\nJefferson proposed to meet this emergency consisted of three parts:\r\n\r\n1. Lay up the frigates and defend our coast and harbors by a number of\r\nsmall, swift-sailing craft, each carrying one gun in the stern. In time\r\nof peace they were to be hauled up under sheds. In time of war they were\r\nto be shoved into the water and manned by volunteers. Between 1806 and\r\n1812, 176 of these gunboats were built.\r\n\r\n2. Make a new treaty with Great Britain, because that made by Jay in\r\n1794 was to expire in 1806. Under the instructions of Jefferson,\r\ntherefore, Monroe and Pinckney signed a new treaty in December, 1806.\r\nBut it said nothing about the impressment of our sailors, or about the\r\nright of our ships to go where they pleased, and was so bad in general\r\nthat Jefferson would not even send it to the Senate.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: No treaty can become a law unless approved by the President\r\nand two thirds of the Senate.]\r\n\r\n3. The third part of his policy consisted in doing what we should call\r\n"boycotting." He wanted a law which would forbid the importation into\r\nthe United States of any article made, grown, or produced in Great\r\nBritain or any of her colonies. Congress accordingly, in April, 1806,\r\npassed what was called a "Non-importation Act," which prohibited not the\r\nimportation of every sort of British goods, wares, and merchandise, but\r\nonly a few which the people could make in this country; as paper, cards,\r\nleather goods, etc. This was to go into force at the President\'s\r\npleasure.\r\n\r\n%256. The Chesapeake and the Leopard.%--Such an attempt to punish\r\nGreat Britain by cutting off a part of her trade was useless, and only\r\nmade her more insolent than before. Indeed, just a week after the\r\nPresident signed the non-importation bill, as one of our coasting\r\nvessels was entering the harbor of New York, a British vessel, wishing\r\nto stop and search her, fired a shot which struck the helmsman and\r\nkilled him at the wheel.\r\n\r\nAbout a year later, June, 1807, an attack more outrageous still was made\r\non our frigate _Chesapeake_. She was on her way from Washington to the\r\nMediterranean, and was still in sight of land when a British vessel, the\r\n_Leopard_, hailed and stopped her and sent an officer on board with a\r\ndemand for the delivery of deserters from the English navy. The captain\r\nof the _Chesapeake_ refused, the officer returned, and the _Leopard_\r\nopened fire. To return the fire was impossible, for only a few of the\r\nguns of the _Chesapeake_ were mounted. At last one was discharged, and\r\nas by that time three men had been killed and eighteen wounded,\r\nCommander Barron of the _Chesapeake_ surrendered. Four men then were\r\ntaken from her deck. Three were Americans. One was an Englishman, and he\r\nwas hanged for desertion.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Maclay\'s _History of the Navy_, Vol. I., pp. 305-308;\r\nMcMaster\'s _History_, Vol. III., pp. 255-259.]\r\n\r\n%257. The Long Embargo.%--The attack on the _Chesapeake_ ought to\r\nhave been followed by war. But Jefferson merely demanded reparation from\r\nGreat Britain, and when Congress met in December, 1807, asked for an\r\nembargo. The request was granted, and merchant vessels in all the ports\r\nof the United States were forbidden to sail for a foreign country till\r\nthe President saw fit to suspend the law. The restriction was so\r\nsweeping and the damage done to American farmers, merchants, and\r\nshipowners so great, that the people began to evade it at once. They\r\nwould send their vessels to New Orleans and stop at the West Indies on\r\nthe way. They would send their flour, pork, rice, and lumber to St.\r\nMarys in Georgia and smuggle it over the river to Florida, or take it to\r\nthe islands near Eastport in Maine and then smuggle it into New\r\nBrunswick. Because of this, more stringent embargo laws were passed, and\r\nfinally, in 1809, a "Force Act," to compel obedience. But smuggling went\r\non so openly that there was nothing to do but use troops or lift the\r\nembargo. In February, 1809, accordingly, the embargo laws, after\r\nfourteen months\' duration, were repealed. Instead of them the\r\nRepublicans enacted a Non-intercourse law which allowed the people to\r\ntrade with all nations except England and France.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: McMaster\'s _History_, Vol. III., pp. 279-338; Adams\'s\r\n_History_, Vol. IV., Chaps. 7, 11, 13, 15.]\r\n\r\n%258. Jefferson refuses a Third Term.%--During 1806, the states of\r\nNew Jersey, Vermont,[2] Pennsylvania, New York, Rhode Island, Maryland,\r\nGeorgia, and North Carolina invited Jefferson to be President a third\r\ntime. For a while he made no reply, but in December, 1807, he declined,\r\nand gave this reason: "That I should lay down my charge at a proper\r\nperiod is as much a duty as to have borne it faithfully. If some\r\ntermination to the services of the Chief Magistrate be not fixed by the\r\nConstitution, or supplied by practice, his office, nominally four years,\r\nwill in fact become for life; and history shows how easily that\r\ndegenerates into an inheritance." This wise answer was heartily\r\napproved by the people all over the country, and with Washington\'s\r\nsimilar action established a custom which has been generally followed\r\never since.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Vermont was admitted into the Union in 1791 (p. 243).]\r\n\r\nAs Jefferson would not accept a third term, a caucus of Republican\r\nmembers of Congress met one evening at the Capitol in Washington and\r\nnominated James Madison and George Clinton. The Federalists held no\r\ncaucus, but agreed among themselves to support C.C. Pinckney and Rufus\r\nKing. Madison and Clinton were easily elected, and were sworn into\r\noffice March 4, 1809.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: James Madison]\r\n\r\n%259. The Macon Bill; Non-intercourse.%--When Congress met in 1809\r\none more effort was made to force France and England to respect our\r\nrights on the sea. Non-importation had failed. The embargo had failed.\r\nNon-intercourse had failed, and now in desperation they passed a law\r\nwhich at the time was called the "Macon Bill," from the member of\r\nCongress who introduced it. This restored trade with France and England,\r\nbut declared that if either would withdraw its Decrees or Orders, the\r\nUnited States would stop all trade with the other.\r\n\r\n%260. Trickery of Napoleon.%--And now Napoleon came forward and\r\nassured the American minister that the Berlin and Milan Decrees should\r\nbe recalled on November 1, 1810, provided the United States would\r\nrestore non-intercourse with England. To this Madison agreed, and on\r\nNovember 1, 1810, issued a proclamation saying that unless Great Britain\r\nshould, before February 1, 1811, recall her Orders in Council, trade\r\nwith her should stop on that day. Great Britain did not recall her\r\nOrders, and in February, 1811, we once more ceased to trade with her.\r\n\r\nTrade with France was resumed on November 1, 1810, and of course a great\r\nfleet of merchants went off to French ports. But they were no sooner\r\nthere than the villainy of Napoleon was revealed, for on December 25, by\r\ngeneral order, every American ship in the French ports was seized, and\r\n$10,000,000 worth of American property was confiscated. He had not\r\nrecalled his Decrees, but pretended to do so in order to get the\r\nAmerican goods and provisions which he sorely needed.\r\n\r\nIt is surprising how patient the Americans of those days were. But their\r\npatience as to Great Britain now gave out, and our minister at London\r\nwas recalled in 1811. This alarmed the British, who promptly began to\r\ntake steps to keep the peace, and offered to make amends for the\r\n_Leopard-Chesapeake_ outrage which had occurred four years before (June,\r\n1807). They agreed to replace the three American sailors on the deck of\r\nthe _Chesapeake_ and did so (June, 1812). But the day for peaceful\r\nsettlement was gone. The people were aroused and angry, and this feeling\r\nshowed itself in many ways.\r\n\r\n%261. The President and the Little Belt.%--In the early part of May,\r\n1811, a British frigate was cruising off the harbor of New York with her\r\nname _Guerri\xc3\xa8re_ painted in large letters on her fore-topsail, and one\r\nday her captain stopped an American vessel as it was about to enter New\r\nYork, and impressed a citizen of the United States. Three years earlier\r\nthis outrage would have been made the subject of a proclamation. Now,\r\nthe moment it was known at Washington, an order was sent to Captain\r\nRogers of the frigate _President_ to go to sea at once, search for the\r\n_Guerri\xc3\xa8re_, and demand the delivery of the man, Rogers was only too\r\nglad to go, and soon came in sight of a vessel which looked like the\r\n_Guerri\xc3\xa8re_; but it was half-past eight o\'clock at night before he came\r\nwithin speaking distance. A battle followed and lasted till the stranger\r\nbecame unmanageable, when the _President_ stopped firing; and the next\r\nmorning Rogers found that his enemy was the British twenty-two-gun ship,\r\n_Little Belt_.\r\n\r\n%262. The War Congress.%--Another way in which the anger of the\r\npeople showed itself was in the election, in the autumn of 1810, of a\r\nCongress which met in December, 1811, fully determined to make war on\r\nGreat Britain. In that Congress were two men who from that day on for\r\nforty years were great political leaders. One was John C. Calhoun of\r\nSouth Carolina; the other was Henry Clay of Kentucky.\r\n\r\nClay was made Speaker of the House of Representatives, and under his\r\nlead preparations were instantly begun for war, which was finally\r\ndeclared June 18, 1812. There was no Atlantic cable in those days. Had\r\nthere been, it is very doubtful if war would have been declared; for on\r\nJune 23, 1812, five days after Congress authorized Madison to issue the\r\nproclamation, the Orders in Council were recalled.\r\n\r\nThe causes of war, as set forth in the proclamation, were:\r\n\r\n1. Tampering with the Indians, and urging them to attack our citizens on\r\nthe frontier.\r\n\r\n2. Interfering with our trade by the Orders in Council.\r\n\r\n3. Putting cruisers off our ports to stop and search our vessels.\r\n\r\n4. Impressing our sailors, of whom more than 6000 were in the British\r\nservice.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\n1. One reason which led Napoleon to sell Louisiana was his determination\r\nto go to war with England. This he did in 1803.\r\n\r\n2. Renewal of war in Europe made the United States again a neutral\r\nnation, and brought up the old quarrel over neutral rights.\r\n\r\n3.In 1806, Napoleon, who was master of nearly all western Europe, cut\r\noff British trade with the continent. Great Britain in return declared,\r\nby an Order in Council, the coast from Brest to the Elbe blockaded; that\r\nis, shut to neutral trade.\r\n\r\n4. Later in the year 1806 Napoleon retaliated with the Berlin Decree,\r\ndeclaring the British Islands blockaded.\r\n\r\n5. Great Britain, by another Order in Council (1807), shut all European\r\nports, under French control, to neutrals.\r\n\r\n6. Napoleon struck back with the Milan Decree.\r\n\r\n7. Our commerce was now attacked by both powers, and to force them to\r\nrepeal their Decrees and Orders in Council, certain commercial\r\nrestrictions were adopted by the United States.\r\n\r\n   A. Non-importation, 1806.\r\n   B. Embargo, 1807-1809.\r\n   C. Non-intercourse, 1809.\r\n\r\n8. Each of them failed to have any effect, and in 1812 war was declared.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n%1803.

Fighting on the Frontier.%--"Mr. Madison\'s War," as the\r\nFederalists delighted to call our war for commercial independence,\r\nopened with three armies in the field ready to invade and capture\r\nCanada. One under Hull, then governor of the territory of Michigan, was\r\nto cross the river at Detroit, and march eastward through Canada. A\r\nsecond, under General Van Rensselaer, was to cross the Niagara River,\r\ntake Queenstown, and join Hull, after which the two armies were to\r\ncapture York, now Toronto, and go on eastward toward Montreal. Meantime,\r\nthe third army, under Dearborn, was to go down Lake Champlain, and meet\r\nthe troops under Hull and Van Rensselaer before Montreal. The three were\r\nthen to capture Montreal and Quebec, and complete the conquest\r\nof Canada.\r\n\r\nThe plan failed; for Hull was driven from Canada, and surrendered his\r\narmy and the whole Northwest, at Detroit; Van Rensselaer, defeated at\r\nQueenstown, was unable even to get a footing in Canada; while Dearborn,\r\nafter reaching the northern boundary line of New York, stopped, and the\r\nyear 1812 ended with nothing accomplished.\r\n\r\nThe surrender of Hull filled the people with indignation, aroused their\r\npatriotism, and forced the government to gather a new army for the\r\nrecapture of Detroit. The command was given to William Henry Harrison,\r\nwho hurried from Cincinnati across the wilderness of Ohio, and in the\r\ndead of winter reached the shores of Lake Erie. General Winchester, who\r\ncommanded part of the troops, was now called on to drive the British\r\nfrom Frenchtown, a little hamlet on the river Raisin, and (in January,\r\n1813) tried to do so. But the British and Indians came down on him in\r\ngreat numbers, and defeated and captured his army, after which the\r\nIndians were allowed to massacre and scalp the wounded.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Canadian Frontier and Vicinity of Washington]\r\n\r\nAnd now the British became aggressive, invaded Ohio, and attacked the\r\nAmericans under Harrison at Fort Meigs, and then at Fort Stephenson,\r\nwhere Major Croghan and 160 men, with the aid of one small cannon,\r\ndefeated and drove off 320 Canadians and Indians.\r\n\r\n%264. Battle of Lake Erie.%--Again the Americans in turn became\r\naggressive. Since the early winter, a young naval officer named Oliver\r\nHazard Perry had been hard at work, with a gang of ship carpenters, at\r\nErie, in Pennsylvania, cutting down trees, and had used this green\r\ntimber to build nine small vessels. With this fleet he sailed, in\r\nSeptember, in search of the British squadron, which had been just as\r\nhastily built, and soon found it near Sandusky, Ohio. His own ship he\r\nhad named the _Lawrence_, in honor of a gallant American captain who had\r\nbeen killed a few months before in a battle with an English frigate. As\r\nPerry saw the enemy in the distance, he flung to the breeze a blue flag\r\non which was inscribed, "Don\'t give up the ship" (the dying order of\r\nLawrence to his men), sailed down to meet the enemy, and fought the two\r\nlargest British ships till the _Lawrence_ was a wreck. Then, with his\r\nflag on his arm, he jumped into a boat, and amidst a shower of shot and\r\nbullets was rowed to the _Niagara_. Once on her deck, he again hastened\r\nto the attack, broke the British line of battle, and captured the entire\r\nfleet. His dispatch to Harrison is as famous as his victory: "We have\r\nmet the enemy, and they are ours--two ships, two brigs, one schooner,\r\nand one sloop."\r\n\r\n%265. Battle of the Thames.%--Perry\'s victory was a grand one. It\r\ngave him command of Lake Erie, and enabled him to carry Harrison\'s\r\nsoldiers over to Canada, where, on the Thames River, Harrison defeated\r\nthe British and Indians. These two victories regained all that had been\r\nlost by the surrender of Hull.\r\n\r\nAlong the New York border little was done during 1813. The Americans\r\nmade a raid into Canada, and to their shame burned York. The British\r\nattacked Sacketts Harbor and were driven off. The Americans sent an\r\nexpedition down the St. Lawrence against Montreal, but the leaders got\r\nfrightened and took refuge in northern New York.\r\n\r\n%266. Campaign of 1814.%--In 1814 better officers were put in\r\ncommand, and before winter came the Americans, under Jacob Brown and\r\nWinfield Scott, had won the battles of Chippewa and Lundys Lane, and\r\ncaptured Fort Erie. But the British returned in force, burned Black Rock\r\nand Buffalo in revenge for the burning of York, and forced the Americans\r\nto leave Canada.\r\n\r\nThe fighting along the Niagara River, by holding the army in that place,\r\nprevented the Americans from attacking Montreal, and enabled the\r\nBritish to gather a fleet on Lake Champlain, and send an army down from\r\nQuebec to invade New York state just as Burgoyne had in 1777. But the\r\nland force was defeated by General Macomb at Plattsburg, while Thomas\r\nMcDonough utterly destroyed the fleet in Plattsburg Bay. This was one of\r\nthe great victories of the war.\r\n\r\n%267. The Sea Fights.%--While our army on the frontier was\r\naccomplishing little, our war ships were winning victory after victory\r\non the sea. At the opening of the war, our navy was the subject of\r\nEnglish ridicule and contempt. We had sixteen ships; she had 1200. She\r\nlaughed at ours as "fir-built things with a bit of striped bunting at\r\ntheir mastheads." But before 1813 came, these "fir-built things" had\r\ndestroyed her naval supremacy.[1] With the details of all these\r\nvictories on the sea we will not concern ourselves. Yet a few must be\r\nmentioned because the fame of them still endures, and because they are\r\nexamples of naval warfare in the days when the ships fought lashed\r\ntogether, and when the boarders, cutlass and pistol in hand, climbed\r\nover the bulwarks and met the enemy on his own deck, man to man. During\r\n1812 the frigate _Constitution_, whose many victories won her the name\r\nof "Old Ironsides," sank the _Guerri\xc3\xa8re_; the _United States_ captured\r\nand brought to port the _Macedonian_; and the _Wasp_, a little sloop of\r\neighteen guns, after the most desperate engagement of the whole war,\r\ncaptured the British sloop _Frolic_.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: One reason for the success of the American navy was the\r\nexperience it had gained in the clash with France, and also in a war\r\nwith Tripoli in 1801-1805. At that time the Christian nations whose\r\nships sailed the Mediterranean Sea were accustomed to pay annual tribute\r\nto Tripoli and other piratical states on the north coast of Africa,\r\nunder pain of having their ships seized and their sailors reduced to\r\nslavery. A dispute with the United States led to a war which gained for\r\nour ships the freedom of the Mediterranean.]\r\n\r\nWhen these sloops were some two hundred feet apart, the _Wasp_ opened\r\nwith musketry and cannon. The sea, lashed into fury by a two days\'\r\ncyclone, was running mountain high. The vessels rolled till the muzzles\r\nof their guns dipped in the water. But the crews cheered lustily and\r\nthe fight went on. When at last the crew of the _Wasp_ boarded the\r\n_Frolic_, they were amazed to find that, save the man at the wheel and\r\nthree officers who threw down their swords, not a living soul was\r\nvisible. The crew had gone below to avoid the terrible fire of the\r\n_Wasp_. Scarcely was the battle over when the British frigate\r\n_Poictiers_ bore down under a press of sail, recaptured what was left of\r\nthe _Frolic_, and took the _Wasp_ in addition.\r\n\r\nDuring 1813 the _Constitution_ took the _Java_; the _Hornet_ sank the\r\n_Peacock_; the _Enterprise_ captured the _Boxer_ off Portland, Maine.\r\nThese and many more made up the list of American victories. But there\r\nwere British victories also. The _Argus_, after destroying twenty-seven\r\nvessels in the English Channel, was taken by the _Pelican_; the _Essex_,\r\nafter a marvelous cruise around South America, was captured by two\r\nfrigates. The _Chesapeake_ was forced to strike to the _Shannon._\r\n\r\nThe _Chesapeake_ was at anchor in Boston harbor, in command of James\r\nLawrence, when the British frigate _Shannon_ ran in and challenged her.\r\nLawrence went out at once, and after a short, fierce fight was defeated\r\nand killed. As his men were carrying him below, mortally wounded, he\r\ncried, "Don\'t give up the ship!" words which Perry, as we have seen,\r\nafterwards put on his flag, and which his countrymen have never since\r\nforgotten.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: On the naval war read Maclay\'s _History of the Navy_, Part\r\nThird; Roosevelt\'s _Naval War of 1812_; McMaster, Vol. IV., pp. 70-108.]\r\n\r\n%268. The British blockade the Coast.%--Never, in the course of her\r\nexistence, had England suffered such a series of defeats as we inflicted\r\non her navy in 1812 and 1813. The record of those years caused a\r\ntremendous excitement in Great Britain, all the vessels she could spare\r\nwere sent over, and with the opening of 1814, the whole coast of the\r\nUnited States was declared to be in a state of blockade.[1] In New\r\nEngland, Eastport (Moose Island) and Nantucket Island quickly fell. A\r\nBritish force went up the Penobscot to Hampden, and burned the _Adams_.\r\nThe eastern half of Maine was seized, and Stonington, in Connecticut,\r\nwas bombarded.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: All except New England had been blockaded since 1812; and\r\nin 1813 the coast of Chesapeake Bay had been ravaged.]\r\n\r\n%269. Burning of Washington.%--Further down the coast a great fleet\r\nand army from Bermuda, under General Ross and Admiral Cockburn, came up\r\nthe Chesapeake Bay, landed in Maryland, and marched to Washington. At\r\nBladensburg, a little hamlet near the capital, the Americans made a\r\nfeeble show of resistance, but soon fled; and about dark on an August\r\nnight, 1814, a detachment of the British reached Washington, marched to\r\nthe Capitol, fired a volley through the windows, entered, and set fire\r\nto the building. When the fire began to burn brightly, Ross and Cockburn\r\nled the troops to the President\'s house, which was sacked and burned.\r\nNext morning the torch was applied to the Treasury building and to the\r\nDepartments of State and War. Several private houses and a printing\r\noffice were also destroyed before the British began a hasty retreat to\r\nthe Chesapeake.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Adams\'s _History_, Vol. VIII., Chaps. 5, 6; McMaster\'s\r\n_History_, Vol. IV., pp. 135-148; _Memoirs of Dolly Madison_, Chap. 8.]\r\n\r\n%270. Baltimore attacked.%--Once on the bay, the army was hurried on\r\nboard the ships and carried to Baltimore, where for a day and a night\r\nthey shelled Fort McHenry.[2] Failing to take it, and Ross having been\r\nkilled, Cockburn re\xc3\xabmbarked and sailed away to Halifax.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Francis S. Key, an American held prisoner on one of the\r\nBritish ships, composed the words of _The Star-Spangled Banner_ while\r\nwatching the bombardment.]\r\n\r\n%271. The Victory at New Orleans.%--The army was taken to Jamaica in\r\norder that it might form part of one of the greatest war expeditions\r\nEngland had ever fitted out. Fifty of the finest ships her navy could\r\nfurnish, mounting 1000 guns and carrying on their decks 20,000 veteran\r\nsoldiers and sailors, had been quietly assembled at Jamaica during the\r\nautumn of 1814, and in November sailed for New Orleans.\r\n\r\nNews of this intended attack had reached Madison, and he had given the\r\nduty of defending New Orleans to Andrew Jackson of Tennessee, one of the\r\nmost extraordinary men our country has produced. The British landed at\r\nthe entrance of Lake Borgne in December, 1814, and hurried to the banks\r\nof the Mississippi. But Jackson was more than a match for them.\r\nGathering such a force of fighting men as he could, he hastened from the\r\ncity and with all possible speed threw up a line of rude earthworks, and\r\nwaited to be attacked. This line the British under General Pakenham\r\nattacked on January 8, 1815, and were twice driven back with frightful\r\nloss of life. Never had such a defeat been inflicted on a British army.\r\nThe loss in killed, wounded, and missing was 2036 men. Jackson lost\r\nseventy-one men. Five British regiments which entered the battle 3000\r\nstrong reported 1750 men killed, wounded, and missing.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Adams\'s _History_, Vol. VIII., Chaps. 12-14; McMaster, Vol.\r\nIV., pp. 182-190]\r\n\r\n%272. Peace.%--For a month after this defeat the British lingered in\r\ntheir camp. At last, in February, the army departed to attack a fort on\r\nMobile Bay. The fort was taken, and two days later the news of peace put\r\nan end to war. The treaty was signed at Ghent in December, 1814; but it\r\ndid not reach the United States till February, 1815.\r\n\r\nIn the treaty not a word was said about the impressment of our sailors,\r\nnor about the right of search, nor about the Orders in Council, nor\r\nabout inciting the Indians to attack our frontier, all of which Madison\r\nhad declared to be causes of the war. Yet we gained much. Our naval\r\nvictories made us the equal of any maritime power, while at home the war\r\ndid far more to arouse a national sentiment, consolidate the union, and\r\nmake us a nation than any event which had yet occurred.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\n1. The land war may be divided into:\r\n\r\n    A. War along the frontier.\r\n    B. War along the Atlantic coast.\r\n    C. War along the Gulf coast.\r\n\r\n2. War along the Canadian frontier resulted in a gain to neither side.\r\nIn 1812 Americans were beaten at Detroit and at Queenstown, and failed\r\nto invade Canada. In 1813 the Americans were beaten at Frenchtown, but\r\ndefeated the Canadians at Forts Meigs and Stephenson, and at the Thames\r\nRiver, and recovered Detroit. Perry won the battle of Lake Erie. The\r\nAmericans failed in the attempt to take Montreal. In 1814 the battles of\r\nChippewa and Lundys Lane were won, and Fort Erie was taken. But the\r\nBritish burned Buffalo and Black Rock and drove the Americans out of\r\nCanada. McDonough won the battle of Lake Champlain.\r\n\r\n3. During 1812-13 the British blockaded the coast from the east end of\r\nLong Island south to the Mississippi. New England was not blockaded till\r\n1814. Then depredations began, and during the year Washington was taken\r\nand partly burned, and Baltimore attacked.\r\n\r\n4. Later in the year the British, after the attack on Baltimore, went\r\nsouth, and early in 1815 were beaten by Jackson at New Orleans.\r\n\r\n5. The navy won a series of successive victories. The defeats were about\r\nhalf as numerous as the victories.\r\n\r\n6. Peace was announced in February, 1815.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n             /       /             /               / 1812.

In 1790 the United States was bounded west by the\r\nMississippi River. By 1815 Louisiana had been purchased, the Columbia\r\nRiver had been discovered, and the Oregon country had been explored to\r\nthe Pacific. In 1790 the inhabitants of the United States numbered less\r\nthan four millions. In 1815 they were eight millions. In 1790 there were\r\nbut thirteen states in the Union, and two territories. In 1815 there\r\nwere eighteen states and five territories.\r\n\r\n%274. The Three Streams of Westward Emigration.%--Sparse as was the\r\npopulation in 1789, the rage for emigration had already seized the\r\npeople, and long before 1790 the emigrants were pouring over the\r\nmountains in three great streams. One, composed of New England men, was\r\npushing along the borders of Lake Champlain and up the Mohawk valley. A\r\nsecond, chiefly from Pennsylvania and Virginia, was spreading itself\r\nover the rich valleys of what are now West Virginia and Kentucky.\r\nFurther south a third stream of emigrants, mostly from Virginia and\r\nNorth Carolina, had gone over the Blue Ridge Mountains, and was creeping\r\ndown the valley of the Tennessee River.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: For an account of the movement of population westward along\r\nthese routes, see _The First Century of the Republic_, pp. 211-238.]\r\n\r\nFor months each year the Ohio was dotted with flatboats. One observer\r\nsaw fifty leave Pittsburg in five weeks. Another estimated that ten\r\nthousand emigrants floated by Marietta during 1788. As this never-ending\r\nstream of population spread over the wilderness, building cabins,\r\nfelling trees, clearing the land, and driving off the game, the Indians\r\ntook alarm and determined to expel them.\r\n\r\n%275. The Indian War.%--During the summer of 1786 the tribes whose\r\nhunting grounds lay in eastern Tennessee and Kentucky took the warpath,\r\nsacked and burned a little settlement on the Holston, and spread terror\r\nalong the whole frontier. But the settlers in their turn rose, and\r\ninflicted on the Indians a signal punishment. One expedition from\r\nTennessee burned three Cherokee towns. Another from Kentucky crossed the\r\nOhio, penetrated the Indian country, burned eight towns, and laid waste\r\nhundreds of acres of standing corn. Had the Indians been left to\r\nthemselves, they would, after this punishment, have remained quiet. But\r\nthe British, who still held the frontier post at Detroit, roused them,\r\nand in 1790 they were again at work, ravaging the country north of the\r\nOhio. They rushed down on Big Bottom (northwest of Marietta) and swept\r\nit from the face of the earth. St. Clair, who was governor of the\r\nNorthwest Territory, sent against them an expedition which won some\r\nsuccess--just enough to enrage and not enough to cow them.\r\n\r\n%276. St. Clair; Wayne.%--Not a settlement north of the Ohio was now\r\nsafe, and had it not been for the men of Kentucky, who came to the\r\nrelief, and in two expeditions held the Indians in check till the\r\nFederal government could act, every one of them would have been\r\ndestroyed. The plan of the Secretary of War was to build a chain of\r\nforts from Cincinnati to Lake Michigan, and late in 1791 St. Clair set\r\noff to begin the work. But the Indians surprised him on a branch of the\r\nWabash River, and inflicted on him one of the most dreadful defeats in\r\nour history. Public opinion now forced him to resign his command, which\r\nwas given to Anthony Wayne, who, after two years of careful\r\npreparation, crushed the Indian power at the falls of the Maumee River\r\nin northwestern Ohio. The next year, 1795, a treaty was made at\r\nGreenville, by which the Indians gave up all claim to the soil south and\r\neast of a boundary line drawn from what is now Cleveland southwest to\r\nthe Ohio River.\r\n\r\n%277. Kentucky and Vermont become States.%--These Indian wars almost\r\nstopped emigration to the country north of the Ohio, though not into\r\nKentucky or Tennessee. For several years past the people of the District\r\nof Kentucky had been desirous to come into the Union, but had been\r\nunable to make terms with Virginia, to which Kentucky belonged. At last\r\nconsent was obtained and the application made to Congress. But the\r\nKentuckians were slave owners, were identified with Southern and Western\r\ninterests, and cared little for the commercial interests of the East,\r\nand as this influence could be strongly felt in the Senate, where each\r\nstate had two votes, it was decided to offset those of Kentucky by\r\nadmitting the Eastern state of Vermont.\r\n\r\nWhat is now Vermont was once the property of New Hampshire, was settled\r\nby people from New England under town rights granted by the governor of\r\nNew Hampshire, and was called "New Hampshire Grants." In 1764, however,\r\nthe governor of New York obtained a royal order giving New York\r\njurisdiction over the Grants on the ground that in 1664 the possessions\r\nof the Duke of York extended to the Connecticut River. Then began a\r\ncontroversy which was still raging bitterly when the Revolution opened,\r\nand the Green Mountain Boys asked recognition as a state and admission\r\ninto the Congress, a request which the other states were afraid to grant\r\nlest by so doing they should offend New York. Thereupon the people chose\r\ndelegates to a convention (in 1777), which issued a declaration of\r\nindependence, declared "New Connecticut, alias Vermont," a state, and\r\nmade a constitution. In this shape matters stood in 1791, when as an\r\noffset to Kentucky Vermont was admitted into the Union. As she was a\r\nstate with governor, legislature, and constitution, she came in at once.\r\nKentucky had to make a constitution, and so was not admitted till 1792.\r\nFour years later (1796) Congress admitted Tennessee.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE UNITED STATES AND TERRITORIES July 4, 1801.\r\nTWENTY-FIVE YEARS AFTER INDEPENDENCE]\r\n\r\n%278. The New Territories; Ohio becomes a State.%--The quieting of\r\nthe Indians by Wayne in 1794, the opening of the Mississippi River to\r\nAmerican trade by Spain in 1795, coupled with cheap lands and low\r\ntaxes, caused another rush of population into the Ohio valley. Between\r\n1795 and 1800 so many came that the Northwest Territory was cut in twain\r\nand the new territory of Indiana was organized in 1800. The acceptance\r\nby Spain in 1795 of 31\xc2\xb0 north latitude as the boundary of the Floridas,\r\ngave the United States control of the greater part of old West Florida,\r\nwhich in 1798 was organized as the Mississippi Territory. Hardly a year\r\nnow elapsed without some marked sign of Western development. In 1800\r\nCongress, under the influence of William Henry Harrison, the first\r\ndelegate from the Northwest Territory, made a radical change in its land\r\npolicy. Up to that time every settler must pay cash. After 1800 he could\r\nbuy on credit, pay in four annual installments, and west of the\r\nMuskingum River could purchase as little as 320 acres. This credit\r\nsystem led to another rush into the Ohio valley, and so many people\r\nentered the Northwest Territory, that in 1803 the southern part of it\r\nwas admitted into the Union as the state of Ohio.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Cincinnati in 1810[1]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: From an old print.]\r\n\r\nIn 1802 Georgia ceded her western lands, which were added to the\r\nMississippi Territory. From the Louisiana purchase there was organized\r\nin 1804 the territory of Orleans, and in 1805 the territory of Louisiana\r\n(see p. 247). In 1805, also, the lower peninsula of Michigan was cut off\r\nfrom Indiana and organized as Michigan Territory. In 1809 the territory\r\nof Illinois was organized (p. 247). In 1812 the territory of Orleans\r\nbecame the state of Louisiana.\r\n\r\nThe third census showed that in 1810 the population of the United States\r\nwas 7,200,000, and that of these over 1,000,000 were in the states and\r\nterritories west of the Alleghanies.\r\n\r\n%279. Indian Troubles; Battle of Tippecanoe.%--As the settlers north\r\nof the Ohio moved further westward, and as more came in, their farms and\r\nsettlements touched the Indian boundary line. In Indiana, where, save a\r\nstrip sixty miles wide along the Ohio River, and a few patches scattered\r\nover the territory, every foot of soil was owned by the Indians, this\r\ncrowding led to serious consequences. The Indians first grew restive.\r\nThen, under the lead of Tecumthe, or Tecumseh, they founded a league or\r\nconfederacy against the whites, and built a town on Tippecanoe Creek,\r\njust where it enters the Wabash. Finally, when Harrison, who was\r\ngovernor of Indiana Territory, bought the Indian rights to the Wabash\r\nvalley, the confederacy refused to recognize the sale, and gave such\r\nsigns of resistance that Harrison marched against them, and in 1811\r\nfought the battle of Tippecanoe and burned the Indian village. For a\r\ntime it was thought the victory was as signal as that of Wayne. But the\r\nIndians were soon back on the old site, and in our second war with Great\r\nBritain they sided with the British.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The United States and Territories in 1813]\r\n\r\n%280. Industrial Progress.%--In 1789 our country had no credit and no\r\nrevenue, and was burdened with a great debt which very few people\r\nbelieved would ever be paid. But when the government called in all the\r\nold worthless Continental money and certificates and gave the people\r\nbonds in exchange for them, when it began to lay taxes and pay its\r\ndebts, when it had power to regulate trade, when the National Bank was\r\nestablished and the merchants were given bank bills that would pass at\r\ntheir face value all over the country, business began to revive. The\r\nmoney which the people had been hiding away for years was brought out\r\nand put to useful purposes. Banks sprang up all over the country, and\r\ncompanies were founded to manufacture woolen cloth and cotton cloth, to\r\nbuild bridges, to construct turnpike roads, and to cut canals. Between\r\n1789 and 1795 the first carpet was woven in the United States, the first\r\nbroom made from broom corn, the first cotton factory opened, the first\r\ngold and silver coins of the United States were struck at the mint, the\r\nfirst newspaper was printed in the territory northwest of the Ohio\r\nRiver, the first printing press was set up in Tennessee, the first\r\ngeography of the United States was published, and daily newspapers were\r\nissued in Baltimore and Boston. It was during this period that a hunter\r\nnamed Guinther discovered anthracite coal in Pennsylvania; that Whitney\r\ninvented the cotton gin; that Samuel Slater built the first mill for\r\nmaking cotton yarns; that Eli Terry started the manufacture of clocks as\r\na business; that cotton sewing thread was first manufactured in the\r\nUnited States at Pawtucket, R.I.; and that the first turnpike in our\r\ncountry was completed. This extended from Philadelphia to Lancaster, a\r\ndistance of sixty-two miles.\r\n\r\n%281. The Period of Commercial and Agricultural Prosperity.%--Just at\r\nthis time came another change of great importance. Till 1793 we had\r\nscarcely any commerce with the West Indies. England would not allow our\r\nvessels to go to her islands. Neither would Spain, nor France, except to\r\na very limited degree. It was the policy of these three countries to\r\nconfine such trade as far as possible to their own merchants. But in\r\n1793 France, you remember, made war on England and opened her West\r\nIndian ports to all neutral nations. The United States was a neutral,\r\nand our merchants at once began to trade with the islanders. What these\r\npeople wanted was lumber, flour, grain, provisions, salt pork, and fish.\r\nAll this led to a demand, first, for ships, then for sailors, and then\r\nfor provisions and lumber--to the benefit of every part of the country\r\nexcept the South. New England was the lumber, fishing, shipbuilding, and\r\ncommercial section. New York and Pennsylvania produced grain, flour,\r\nlumber, and carried on a great commerce as well. So profitable was it to\r\nraise wheat, that in many parts of Virginia the people stopped raising\r\ntobacco and began to make flour, and soon made Virginia the second\r\nflour-producing state in the Union. Until after 1795 the people of the\r\nWestern States were cut off from this trade. But in that year the treaty\r\nwith Spain was made, and the people of the West were then allowed to\r\nfloat their produce to New Orleans and there sell it or ship it to the\r\nWest Indies. Kentucky then became a flour-producing state.\r\n\r\nAs a consequence of all this, people stopped putting their money into\r\nroads and canals and manufactures, and put it into farming,\r\nshipbuilding, and commerce. Between 1793 and 1807, therefore, our\r\ncountry enjoyed a period of commercial and agricultural prosperity. But\r\nwith 1807 came another change. In that year the embargo was laid, and\r\nfor more than fifteen months no vessels were allowed to leave the ports\r\nof the United States for foreign countries. Up to this time our people\r\nhad been so much engaged in commerce and agriculture, that they had not\r\nbegun to manufacture. In 1807 all the blankets, all the woolen cloth,\r\ncotton cloth, carpets, hardware, china, glass, crockery, knives, tools,\r\nand a thousand other things used every day were made for us in Great\r\nBritain. Cotton grown in the United States was actually sent to England\r\nto be made into cloth, which was then carried back to the United States\r\nto be used.\r\n\r\n%282. "Infant Manufactures."%--As the embargo prevented our ships\r\ngoing abroad and foreign ships coming to us, these goods could no longer\r\nbe imported. The people must either go without or make them at home.\r\nThey decided, of course, to make them at home, and all patriotic\r\ncitizens were called on to help, which they did in five ways.\r\n\r\nFirst, in each of the cities and large towns people met and formed a\r\n"Society for the Encouragement of Domestic Manufactures." Every\r\npatriotic man and woman was expected to join one of them, and in so\r\ndoing to take a pledge not to buy or use or wear any article of foreign\r\nmake, provided it could be made in this country.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, these societies for the encouragement of domestic\r\nmanufactures, "infant manufactures," as they were called, offered prizes\r\nfor the best piece of homemade linen, homemade cotton cloth, or\r\nwoolen cloth.\r\n\r\nIn the third place, they started "exchanges," or shops, in the cities\r\nand large towns, to which anybody who could knit mittens or socks, or\r\nmake boots and shoes or straw bonnets, or spin flax or wool, or make\r\nanything else that the people needed, could send them to be sold.\r\n\r\nIn the fourth place, men who had money came forward and formed companies\r\nto erect mills and factories for the manufacture of all sorts of things.\r\nIf you were to see the acts passed by the legislatures of the states\r\nbetween 1808 and 1812, you would find that very many of them were\r\ncharters for iron works, paper mills, thread works, factories for making\r\ncotton and woolen cloth, oilcloth, boots, shoes, rope.\r\n\r\nIn the fifth place, the legislatures of the states passed resolutions\r\nasking their members to wear clothes made of material produced in the\r\nUnited States,[1] offered bounties for the best wool, and exempted the\r\nfactories from taxation and the mill hands from militia and jury duty.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: McMaster\'s _History of the People of the United States_,\r\nVol. III., pp. 496-509.]\r\n\r\nThus encouraged, manufactures sprang up in the North, and became so\r\nnumerous that in 1810, when the census of population was taken, Congress\r\nordered that statistics of manufactures should be collected at the same\r\ntime. It was then found that the value of the goods manufactured in the\r\nUnited States in 1810 was $173,000,000.\r\n\r\n%283. Internal Improvements: Roads; Canals; Steamboats.%--But there\r\nwas yet another great change for the better which took place between\r\n1790 and 1815. We have seen how during this quarter of a century our\r\ncountry grew in area, how the people increased in number, how new states\r\nand territories were made, how agriculture and commerce prospered, and\r\nhow manufactures arose. It is now time to see how the people improved\r\nthe means of interstate commerce and communication.\r\n\r\nYou will remember that in 1790 there were no bridges over the great\r\nrivers of the country, that the roads were very bad, that all journeys\r\nwere made on horseback or in stagecoaches or in boats, and that it was\r\nnot then possible to go as far in ten hours as we can now go in one. You\r\nwill remember, also, that the people were moving westward in\r\ngreat numbers.\r\n\r\nAs the people thus year by year went further and further westward, a\r\ndemand arose for good roads to connect them with the East. The merchants\r\non the seaboard wanted to send them hardware, clothing, household goods,\r\nfarming implements, and bring back to the seaports the potash, lumber,\r\nflour, skins, and grain with which the settlers paid for these things.\r\nIf they were too costly, frontiersmen could not buy them. If the roads\r\nwere bad, the difficulty of getting merchandise to the frontier would\r\nmake them too costly. People living in the towns and cities along the\r\nseaboard were no longer content with the old-fashioned slow way of\r\ntravel. They wanted to get their letters more often, make their journeys\r\nand have their freight carried more quickly.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: McMaster\'s _History of the People of the United States,_\r\nVol. III., pp. 462-465.]\r\n\r\nAbout 1805, therefore, men began to think of reviving the old idea of\r\ncanals, which had been abandoned in 1793, and one of these canal\r\ncompanies, the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal, applied to Congress for\r\naid. This brought up the question of a system of internal improvements\r\nat national expense, and Albert Gallatin, the Secretary of the Treasury,\r\nwas asked to send a plan for such a system to Congress, which he did.\r\nCongress never approved it.\r\n\r\n%284. The National Pike.%--Public sentiment, however, led to the\r\ncommencement of a highway to the West known as the National Pike, or the\r\nCumberland Road. When Ohio was admitted into the Union as a state in\r\n1803, Congress promised that part of the money derived from the sale of\r\nland in Ohio should be used to build a road from some place on the Ohio\r\nRiver to tide water. By 1806 the money so set apart amounted to $12,000,\r\nand with this was begun the construction of a broad pike from Cumberland\r\n(on the Potomac) in Maryland to Wheeling (on the Ohio) in West\r\nVirginia.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: McMaster\'s _History_, Vol. III., pp. 469-470.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Phoenix[1]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: From an oil painting.]\r\n\r\n%285. Steamboats.%--This increasing demand for cheap transportation\r\nnow made it possible for Fulton to carry into successful operation an\r\nidea he had long had in mind. For twenty years past inventors had been\r\nexhibiting steamboats. James Rumsey had exhibited one on the Potomac.\r\nJohn Fitch had shown one on the Delaware in 1787. (See p. 190.) In 1804\r\nRobert Fulton exhibited a steamboat on the Seine at Paris in France;\r\nOliver Evans had a steam scow on the Delaware River at Philadelphia; and\r\nJohn Stevens crossed the Hudson from Hoboken to New York in a steamboat\r\nof his own construction. In 1806 Stevens built another, the\r\n_Phoenix_.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Preble\'s _History of Steam Navigation _, pp. 35-66;\r\nThurston\'s _Robert Fulton_ in Makers of America Series.]\r\n\r\nThese men were ahead of their time, and it was not till the August day,\r\n1807, when Robert Fulton made his experiment on the Hudson, that the era\r\nof the steamboat opened. His vessel, called the _Clermont_, made the\r\ntrip up the river from New York to Albany in thirty-two hours.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Model of the Clermont[2]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Made from the original drawings, and now in the National\r\nMuseum.]\r\n\r\nThen the usefulness of the invention was at last appreciated, and in\r\n1808 a line of steam vessels went up and down the Hudson. In 1809\r\nStevens sent his _Phoenix_ by sea to Philadelphia and ran it on the\r\nDelaware. Another steamboat was on the Raritan River, and a third on\r\nLake Champlain. In 1811 a boat steamed from Pittsburg to New Orleans,\r\nand in 1812 steam ferryboats plied between what is now Jersey City and\r\nNew York, and between Philadelphia and Camden.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: On the early steamboats see McMaster\'s _History of the\r\nPeople of the United States_, Vol. III., pp. 486-494.]\r\n\r\n%286. The Currency; the Mint.%--Quite as marvelous was the change\r\nwhich in five and twenty years had taken place in money matters. When\r\nthe Constitution became law in 1789, there were no United States coins\r\nand no United States bills or notes in circulation. There was no such\r\nthing as a national currency. Except the gold and silver pieces of\r\nforeign nations, there was no money which would pass all over our\r\ncountry. To-day a treasury note, a silver certificate, a national bank\r\nbill, is received in payment of a debt in any state or territory. In\r\n1789 the currency was foreign coins and state paper. But the\r\nConstitution forbade the states ever to make any more money, and as\r\ntheir bills of credit already issued would wear out by use, the time was\r\nnear when there would be no currency except foreign coins. To prevent\r\nthis, Congress in 1791 ordered a mint to be established at Philadelphia,\r\nand in 1792 named the coins to be struck, and ordered that whoever would\r\nbring gold or silver to the mint should have it made into coins without\r\ncost to him. This was _free coinage._ As both gold and silver were to be\r\ncoined, the currency was to be _bimetallic_, or of two metals.[1] The\r\nratio of silver and gold was 15 to 1. That is, fifteen pounds\' weight of\r\nsilver must be made into as many dollars\' worth of coins as one pound of\r\ngold. The silver coins were to be the dollar, half and quarter dollar,\r\ndime and half dime; the gold were to be the eagle, half eagle, and\r\nquarter eagle. Out of copper were to be struck cents and half cents. As\r\nsome years must elapse before our national coins could become abundant,\r\ncertain foreign coins were made legal tender.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The first silver coin was struck in 1794; the first gold,\r\nin 1795; the first cent and half cent, in 1793.]\r\n\r\n%287. "Federal Money."%--The appearance of the new money was followed\r\nby another change for the better. In colonial days the merchants and the\r\npeople expressed the debts they owed, or the value of the goods they\r\nsold, in pounds, shillings, and pence, or in Spanish dollars. During the\r\nRevolution, and after it, this was continued, although the Continental\r\nCongress always kept its accounts, and made its appropriations, in\r\ndollars. But when the people began to see dollars, half dollars, and\r\ndimes bearing the words "United States of America," they knew that\r\nthere really was a national coinage, or "Federal money," as they called\r\nit, and between 1795 and 1798, one state after another ordered its\r\ntreasurer to use Federal money instead of pounds, shillings, and pence;\r\nand thereafter in laying taxes, and voting appropriations for any\r\npurpose, the amount was expressed in dollars and cents. The merchants\r\nand the people were much slower in adopting the new terms; but they came\r\nat last into general use.\r\n\r\n%288. Rise of the State Banks.%--Had the people been forced to depend\r\non the United States mint for money wherewith to pay the butcher and the\r\nbaker and the shoemaker, they would not have been able to make their\r\npayments, for the machinery at the mint was worked by hand, and the\r\nnumber of dimes and quarters turned out each year was small. But they\r\nwere not, for as soon as confidence was restored, banks chartered by the\r\nstates sprang up in the chief cities in the East, and as each issued\r\nnotes, the people had all the currency they wanted.\r\n\r\nIn 1790, when Congress established the National Bank, there were but\r\nfour state banks in the whole country: one in Philadelphia, one in New\r\nYork, one in Boston, and one in Baltimore. By 1800 there were\r\ntwenty-six, in 1805 there were sixty-four, and in 1811 there were\r\neighty-eight.\r\n\r\nIn that year (1811) the charter of the National Bank expired, and as\r\nCongress would not renew it, many more state banks were created, each\r\nhoping to get a part of the business formerly done by the National Bank.\r\nSuch was the "mania," as it was called, for banks, that the number rose\r\nfrom eighty-eight in 1811, to two hundred and eight in 1814, which was\r\nfar more than the people really needed.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, all went well until the British came up Chesapeake Bay and\r\nburned Washington. Then the banks in that part of the country boxed up\r\nall their gold and silver and sent it away, lest the British should get\r\nit. This forced them to "suspend specie payments"; that is, refuse to\r\ngive gold or silver in exchange for their own paper. As soon as they\r\nsuspended, others did the same, till in a few weeks every one along the\r\nseaboard from Albany to Savannah, and every one in Ohio, had stopped\r\npaying coin. The New England banks did not suspend.\r\n\r\n%289. No Small Change.%--The consequences of the suspension were very\r\nserious. In the first place, all the small silver coins, the dimes, half\r\ndollars, and quarter dollars, disappeared at once, and the people were\r\nagain forced to do as they had done in 1789, and use "ticket money." All\r\nthe cities and towns, great and small, printed one, two, three, six and\r\none fourth, twelve and one half, twenty-five, and fifty-cent tickets,\r\nand sold them to the people for bank notes. Steamboats, stagecoaches,\r\nand manufacturing companies, merchants, shopkeepers--in fact, all\r\nbusiness men--did the same.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, as the banks would not exchange specie for their\r\nnotes, people who did not know all about a bank would not take its bills\r\nexcept at very much less than their face value. That is, a dollar bill\r\nof a Philadelphia bank was not worth more than ninety cents in paper\r\nmoney at New York, and seventy-five cents at Boston. This state of\r\nthings greatly increased the cost of travel and business between the\r\nstates, and prevented the government using the money collected at the\r\nseaports in the East to pay debts due in the West.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: McMaster\'s _History_, Vol. IV., pp. 280-318.]\r\n\r\n%290. The Second Bank of the United States.%--Lest this state of\r\naffairs should occur again, Congress, exercising its constitutional\r\n"power to regulate the currency," chartered a second National Bank in\r\n1816, and modeled it after the old one. Again the parent bank was at\r\nPhiladelphia; but the capital was now $35,000,000. Again the public\r\nmoney might be deposited in the bank and its branches, which could be\r\nestablished wherever the directors thought proper. Again the bank could\r\nissue paper money to be received by the government in payment of taxes,\r\nland, and all debts.\r\n\r\nThe Republicans had always denied the right of Congress to charter a\r\nbank. But the question was never tested until 1819, when Maryland\r\nattempted to collect a tax laid on the branch at Baltimore. The case\r\nreached the Supreme Court of the United States, which decided that a\r\nstate could not tax a corporation chartered by Congress; and that\r\nCongress had power to charter anything, even a bank.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\n1. The census returns of 1790 showed that population was going west\r\nalong three highways.\r\n\r\n2. As a result of this movement, Vermont (1791), Kentucky (1792),\r\nTennessee (1796), and Ohio (1803) entered the Union.\r\n\r\n3. The population of the country increased from 3,380,000 in 1790 to\r\n7,200,000 in 1810; and the area from about 828,000 to 2,000,000\r\nsquare miles.\r\n\r\n4. The period 1790-1810 was one of marked industrial progress, and of\r\ngreat commercial and agricultural prosperity. It was during this time\r\nthat manufactures arose, that many roads and highways and bridges were\r\nbuilt, and that the steamboat was introduced.\r\n\r\n5. A national mint had been established. The charter of the National\r\nBank had expired, and numbers of state banks had arisen to take its\r\nplace. These banks had suspended specie payment, and the government had\r\nbeen forced to charter a new National Bank.\r\n\r\nPROGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES FROM 1709 TO 1815\r\n\r\n_Territorial Changes. 1790-1812.\r\n\r\n_ Movement of Population into the West._\r\n\r\nNorthern Stream.

Monroe inaugurated.%--The administration of Madison ended on\r\nMarch 4, 1817, and on that day James Monroe and Daniel D. Tompkins were\r\nsworn into office. They had been nominated at Washington in February,\r\n1816, by a caucus of Republican members of Congress, for no such thing\r\nas a national convention for the nomination of a President had as yet\r\nbeen thought of. The Federalists did not hold a caucus; but it was\r\nunderstood that their electors would vote for Rufus King for\r\nPresident.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In 1816 there were nineteen states in the Union (Indiana\r\nhaving been admitted in that year), and of these Monroe carried sixteen\r\nand King three. The inauguration took place in the open air for the\r\nfirst time since 1789.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: on the right of the previous paragraph, with caption\r\n"James Monroe"]\r\n\r\n%292. Death of the Federalist Party.%--The inauguration of Monroe\r\nopens a new era of great interest and importance in our history. From\r\n1793 to 1815, the questions which divided the people into Federalists\r\nand Republicans were all in some way connected with foreign countries.\r\nThey were neutral rights, Orders in Council, French Decrees,\r\nimpressment, embargoes, non-intercourse acts, the conduct of England,\r\nthe insolence of the French Directory, the triumphs and the treachery of\r\nNapoleon. Every Federalist sympathized with England; every Republican\r\nwas a warm supporter of France.\r\n\r\nBut with the close of the war in 1815, all this ended. Napoleon was sent\r\nto St. Helena. Europe was at peace, and there was no longer any foreign\r\nquestion to divide the people into Federalists and Republicans. This\r\ndivision, therefore, ceased to exist, and after 1816 the Federalist\r\nparty never put up a candidate for the presidency. It ceased to exist\r\nnot only as a national but even as a state party, and for twelve years\r\nthere was one great party, the Republican, or, as it soon began to be\r\ncalled, the Democratic.\r\n\r\n%293. The "Era of Good Feeling."%--A sure sign of the disappearance\r\nof party and party feeling was seen very soon after Monroe was\r\ninaugurated. In May, 1817, he left Washington with the intention of\r\nvisiting and inspecting all the forts and navy yards along the eastern\r\nseaboard and the Great Lakes. Beginning at Baltimore, he went to New\r\nYork, then to Boston, and then to Portland; where he turned westward,\r\nand crossing New Hampshire and Vermont to Lake Champlain, made his way\r\nto Ogdensburg, where he took a boat to Sacketts Harbor and Niagara,\r\nwhence he went to Buffalo, and Detroit, and then back to Washington.\r\n\r\nWherever he went, the people came by thousands to greet him; but nowhere\r\nwas the reception so hearty as in New England, the stronghold of\r\nFederalism. "The visit of the President," said a Boston newspaper,\r\n"seems wholly to have allayed the storms of party. People _now meet in\r\nthe same room_ who, a short while since, _would scarcely pass along the\r\nsame street_". Another said that since Monroe\'s arrival at Boston "party\r\nfeeling and animosities have been laid aside, and but one great\r\n_national feeling_ has animated every class of our citizens." So it was\r\neverywhere, and when, therefore, the Boston Sentinel_ called the times\r\nthe "era of good feeling," the whole country took up the expression and\r\nused it, and the eight years of Monroe\'s administration have ever since\r\nbeen so called.\r\n\r\n%294. Trouble with the Seminole Indians.%--Though all was quiet and\r\nhappy within our borders, events of great importance were happening\r\nalong our northern, western, and southern frontier. During the war with\r\nEngland, the Creek Indians in Georgia and Alabama had risen against the\r\nwhite settlers and were beaten and driven out by Jackson and forced to\r\ntake refuge with the Seminoles in Florida. As they had been the allies\r\nof England, they fully expected that when peace was made, England would\r\nsecure for them the territory of which Jackson had deprived them. When\r\nEngland did not do this, they grew sullen and savage, and in 1817 began\r\nto make raids over the border, run off cattle and murder men, women, and\r\nchildren. In order to stop these depredations, General Jackson was sent\r\nto the frontier, and utterly disregarding the fact that the Creeks and\r\nSeminoles were on Spanish soil, he entered West Florida, took St. Marks\r\nand Pensacola, destroyed the Indian power, and hanged two English\r\ntraders as spies.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Parton\'s _Life of Jackson_, Chaps. 34-36; McMaster\'s\r\n_History_, Vol. IV., pp. 430-456.]\r\n\r\n%295. The Canadian Boundary; Forty-ninth Parallel.%--This was\r\nserious, for at the time the news reached Washington that Jackson had\r\ninvaded Spanish soil and hanged two English subjects, important treaties\r\nwere under way with Spain and Great Britain, and it was feared his\r\nviolent acts would stop them. Happily no evil consequences followed, and\r\nin 1818 an agreement was reached as to the dividing line between the\r\nUnited States and British America.\r\n\r\nWhen Louisiana came to us, no limit was given to it on the north, and\r\nfifteen years had been allowed to pass without attempting to establish\r\none. Now, however, the boundary was declared to be a line drawn south\r\nfrom the most northwestern point of the Lake of the Woods to the\r\nforty-ninth parallel of north latitude and along this parallel to the\r\nsummit of the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\n%296. Joint Occupation of Oregon.%--The country beyond the Rocky\r\nMountains, the Oregon country, was claimed by both England and the\r\nUnited States; so it was agreed in the treaty of 1818 that for ten years\r\nto come the country should be held in joint occupation.\r\n\r\n%297. The Spanish Boundary Line.%--One year later (1819) the boundary\r\nof Louisiana was completed by a treaty with Spain, which now sold us\r\nEast and West Florida for $5,000,000. Till this time we had always\r\nclaimed that Louisiana extended across Texas as far as the Rio Grande.\r\nBy the treaty this claim was given up, and the boundary became the\r\nSabine River from the Gulf of Mexico to 32\xc2\xb0, then a north line to the\r\nRed River; westward along this river to the 100th meridian; then\r\nnorthward to the Arkansas River, and westward to its source in the Rocky\r\nMountains; then a north line to 42\xc2\xb0, and then along that parallel to the\r\nPacific Ocean.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: McMaster\'s _History of the People of the United States_,\r\nVol. IV., pp. 457-480.]\r\n\r\n%298. Russian Claims on the Pacific.%--The Oregon country was thus\r\nrestricted to 42\xc2\xb0 on the south, and though it had no limit on the north\r\nthe Emperor of Russia (in 1822) undertook to fix one at 51\xc2\xb0, which he\r\ndeclared should be the south boundary of Alaska. Oregon was thus to\r\nextend from 42\xc2\xb0 to 51\xc2\xb0, and from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific. But\r\nRussia had also founded a colony in California, and seemed to be\r\npreparing to shut the United States from the Pacific coast. Against all\r\nthis John Quincy Adams, then Secretary of State, protested, telling the\r\nRussian minister that European powers no longer had a right to plant\r\ncolonies in either North or South America.\r\n\r\n%299. The Holy Allies and the South American Republics.%--This was a\r\nnew doctrine, and while the United States and Russia were discussing the\r\nboundary of Oregon, it became necessary to make another declaration\r\nregarding the rights of European powers in the two Americas.\r\n\r\nEver since 1793, when Washington issued his proclamation of neutrality\r\n(p. 206), the policy of the United States had been to take no part in\r\nEuropean wars, nor meddle in European politics. This had been asserted\r\nrepeatedly by Washington, Jefferson, and Monroe,[1] and during all the\r\nwars from 1793 to 1815 had been carefully adhered to. It was supposed,\r\nof course, that if we did not meddle in the affairs of the Old World\r\nnations, they would not interfere in affairs over here. But about 1822\r\nit seemed likely that they would interfere very seriously.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Washington\'s _Farewell Address_; Jefferson\'s _Inaugural\r\nAddress_, March 4, 1801; also his message to Congress, Oct. 17, 1803;\r\nMonroe\'s _Inaugural Address_, March 4, 1817, and messages, Dec. 2, 1817,\r\nNov. 17, 1818, Nov. 14, 1820; see also _American History Leaflets_,\r\nNo. 4.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: %NORTH AMERICA AFTER 1824%]\r\n\r\nBeginning with 1810, the Spanish colonies of Mexico and South America\r\n(Chile, Peru, Buenos Ayres, Colombia) rebelled, formed republics, and in\r\n1822 were acknowledged as free and independent powers by the United\r\nStates. Spain, after vainly attempting to subdue them, appealed for help\r\nto the powers of Europe, which in 1815 had formed a Holy Alliance for\r\nthe purpose of maintaining monarchical government. For a while these\r\npowers (Russia, Prussia, Austria, France) held aloof. But in 1823 they\r\ndecided to help Spain to get back her old colonies, and invited Great\r\nBritain to attend a Congress before which the matter was to be\r\ndiscussed. But Great Britain had no desire to see the little republics\r\ndestroyed, and in the summer of 1823, the British Prime Minister asked\r\nthe American minister in London if the United States would join with\r\nEngland in a declaration warning the Holy Allies not to meddle with the\r\nSouth American republics. Thus, just at the time when Adams was\r\nprotesting against European colonization in the Northwest, England\r\nsuggested a protest against European meddling in the affairs of Spanish\r\nAmerica. The opportunity was too good to be lost, and Adams succeeded in\r\npersuading President Monroe to make a protest in behalf of the nation\r\nagainst both forms of European interference in American affairs. Monroe\r\nthought it best to make the declaration independent of Great Britain,\r\nand in his annual message to Congress, December 2, 1823, he announced\r\nthree great guiding principles now known as the\r\n\r\n%300. Monroe Doctrine.%--\r\n\r\n1. Taking up the matter in dispute with Russia, he declared that the\r\nAmerican continents were no longer open to colonization by\r\nEuropean nations.\r\n\r\nReferring to the conduct of the Holy Allies, he said,\r\n\r\n2. That the United States would not meddle in the political affairs of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n3. That European governments must not extend their system to any part of\r\nNorth or South America, nor oppress, nor in any other manner seek to\r\ncontrol the destiny of any of the nations of this hemisphere.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: McMaster\'s _With the Fathers_, pp. 1-54; Tucker\'s _Monroe\r\nDoctrine_.]\r\n\r\nThe protest was effectual. The Holy Allies did not meddle in South\r\nAmerican affairs, and the next year (1824) Russia agreed to make no\r\nsettlement south of 54\xc2\xb0 40\'.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\n1. At the presidential election of 1816 the Federalist party, for the\r\nlast time, voted for a presidential candidate. Party politics were dead,\r\nand the "era of good feeling" opened.\r\n\r\n2. Many important matters which were not settled by the Treaty of Ghent\r\nwere disposed of:\r\n\r\n     A.

Rush into the West.%--The settlement of our boundary disputes,\r\nespecially with Spain, was most timely, for even then people were\r\nhurrying across the mountains by tens of thousands, and building up new\r\nstates in the Mississippi valley. The great demand for ships and\r\nprovisions, which from 1793 to 1807 had made business so brisk, had kept\r\npeople on the seaboard and given them plenty of employment. But after\r\n1812, and particularly after 1815, trade, commerce, and business on the\r\nseaboard declined, work became scarce, and men began to emigrate to the\r\nWest, where they could buy land from the government on the installment\r\nplan, and where the states could not tax their farms until five years\r\nafter the government had given them a title deed. Old settlers in\r\ncentral New York declared they had never seen so many teams and sleighs,\r\nloaded with women, children, and household goods, traveling westward,\r\nbound for Ohio, which was then but another name for the West.\r\n\r\nAs the year wore away, the belief was expressed that when autumn came it\r\nwould be found that the worst was over, and that the good times expected\r\nto follow peace would keep people on the seaboard. But the good times\r\ndid not return. The condition of trade and commerce, of agriculture and\r\nmanufactures, grew worse instead of better, and the western movement of\r\npopulation became greater than ever.\r\n\r\n%302. Rapid Growth of Towns.%--Fed by this never-ending stream of\r\nnewcomers, the West was almost transformed. Towns grew and villages\r\nsprang up with a rapidity which even in these days of rapid and easy\r\ncommunication would be thought amazing. Mt. Pleasant, in Jefferson\r\nCounty, Ohio, was in 1810 a little hamlet of seven families living in\r\ncabins. In 1815 it contained ninety families, numbering 500 souls. The\r\ntown of Vevay, Ind., was laid out in 1813, and was not much better than\r\na collection of huts in 1814. But in 1816 the traveler down the Ohio who\r\nstopped at Vevay found himself at a flourishing county seat, with\r\nseventy-five dwellings, occupied by a happy population who boasted of\r\nhaving among them thirty-one mechanics of various trades; of receiving\r\nthree mails each week, and supporting a weekly newspaper called the\r\n_Indiana Register_. Forty-two thousand settlers are said to have come\r\ninto Indiana in 1816, and to have raised the population to 112,000.\r\n\r\nLetters from New York describe the condition of that state west of Utica\r\nas one of astonishing prosperity. Log cabins were disappearing, and\r\nframe and brick houses taking their place. The pike from Utica to\r\nBuffalo was almost a continuous village, and the country for twenty\r\nmiles on either side was filling up with an industrious population.\r\nAuburn, where twenty years before land sold for one dollar an acre, was\r\nthe first town in size and wealth west of Utica, and land within its\r\nlimits brought $7000 an acre. Fourteen miles west was Waterloo, on the\r\nSeneca River, a village which did not exist in 1814, and which in 1816\r\nhad fifty houses. Rochester, the site of which in 1815 was a wilderness,\r\nhad a printing press, a bookstore, and a hundred houses in 1817.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: McMaster\'s _History of the People of the United States_,\r\nVol. IV., pp. 381-386.]\r\n\r\n%303. Scenes on the Western Highways.%--By 1817 this migration was at\r\nits height, and in the spring of that year families set forth from\r\nalmost every village and town on the seaboard. The few that went from\r\neach place might not be missed; but when they were gathered on any one\r\nof the great roads to the West, as that across New York, or that across\r\nPennsylvania, they made an endless procession of wagons and\r\nfoot parties.\r\n\r\nA traveler who had occasion to go from Nashville to Savannah in January,\r\n1817, declares that on the way he fell in with crowds of emigrants from\r\nCarolina and Georgia, all bound for the cotton lands of Alabama; that he\r\ncounted the flocks and wagons, and that--carts, gigs, coaches, and\r\nwagons, all told--there were 207 conveyances, and more than 3800 people.\r\nAt Haverhill, in Massachusetts, a train of sixteen wagons, with 120 men,\r\nwomen, and children, from Durham, Me., passed in one day. They were\r\nbound for Indiana to buy a township, and were accompanied by their\r\nminister. Within thirteen days, seventy-three wagons and 450 emigrants\r\nhad passed through the same town of Haverhill. At Easton, Pa., which lay\r\non the favorite westward route for New Englanders, 511 wagons, with 3066\r\npersons, passed in a month. They went in trains of from six to fifty\r\nwagons each day. The keeper of Gate No. 2, on the Dauphin turnpike, in\r\nPennsylvania, returned 2001 families as having passed his gate, bound\r\nwest, between March and December, 1817, and gave the number of people\r\naccompanying the vehicles as 16,000. Along the New York route, which\r\nwent across the state from Albany to Buffalo, up Lake Erie, and on by\r\nway of Chautauqua Lake to the Allegheny, the reports are just as\r\nastonishing. Two hundred and sixty wagons were counted going by one\r\ntavern in nine days, besides hundreds of people on horseback and\r\non foot.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: McMaster\'s _History_. Vol. IV., pp. 387, 388.]\r\n\r\n%304. Life on the Frontier.%--The "mover," or, as we should say, the\r\nemigrant, would provide himself with a small wagon, very light, but\r\nstrong enough to carry his family, provisions, bedding, and utensils;\r\nwould cover it with a blanket or a piece of canvas or with linen which\r\nwas smeared with tar inside to make it waterproof; and with two stout\r\nhorses to pull it, would set out for the West, and make his way across\r\nPennsylvania to Pittsburg, then the greatest city of the West, with a\r\npopulation of 7000. Some, as of old, would take boats and float down the\r\nOhio; others would go on to Wheeling, be ferried across the river, and\r\npush into Ohio or Indiana or Illinois, there to "take up" a quarter\r\nsection (160 acres) of government land, or buy or rent a "clearing" from\r\nsome shiftless settler of an earlier day. Government land intended for\r\nsale was laid out in quarter sections of 160 acres, and after being\r\nadvertised for a certain time was offered for sale at public auction.\r\nWhat was not sold could then be purchased at the land office of the\r\ndistrict at two dollars an acre, one quarter to be paid down, and three\r\nfourths before the expiration of four years. The emigrant, having\r\ngathered eighty dollars, would go to some land office, "enter" a quarter\r\nsection, pay the first installment, and make his way in the two-horse\r\nwagon containing his family and his worldly goods to the spot where was\r\nto be his future home. Every foot of it in all probability would be\r\ncovered with bushes and trees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Distribution of the Population of the United States\r\nFourth Census, 1820]\r\n\r\n%305. The Log Cabin.%--In that case the settler would cut down a few\r\nsaplings, make a "half-faced camp," and begin his clearing. The\r\n"half-faced camp" was a shed. Three sides were of logs laid one on\r\nanother horizontally. The roof was of saplings covered with branches or\r\nbark. The fourth side was open, and when it rained was closed by hanging\r\nup deerskin curtains. In this camp the newcomer and his family would\r\nlive while he grubbed up the bushes and cut down trees enough to make a\r\nlog cabin. If he were a thrifty, painstaking man, he would smooth each\r\nlog on four sides with his ax, and notch it half through at each end so\r\nthat when they were placed one on another the faces would nearly touch.\r\nSaplings would make the rafters, and on them would be fastened planks\r\nlaid clapboard fashion, or possibly split shingles.\r\n\r\nAn opening was of course left for a door, although many a cabin was\r\nbuilt without a window, and when the door was shut received no light\r\nsave that which came down the chimney, which was always on the outside\r\nof the house. To form it, an opening eight feet long and six feet high\r\nwas left at one end of the house, and around this a sort of bay window\r\nwas built of logs and lined with stones on the inside. Above the top of\r\nthe opening the chimney contracted and was made of branches smeared both\r\ninside and out with clay. Generally the chimney went to the peak of the\r\nroof; but it was by no means unusual for it to stop about halfway up the\r\nend of the cabin.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Log cabin[1]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The birthplace of Abraham Lincoln, restored (reproduced,\r\ntogether with the first picture on the next page, from Tarbell\'s _Early\r\nLife of Abraham Lincoln_, by permission of the publishers, S.S.\r\nMcClure, Limited).]\r\n\r\nIf the settler was too poor to buy glass, or if glass could not be had,\r\nthe window frame was covered with greased paper, which let in the light\r\nbut could not be seen through. The door was of plank with leather\r\nhinges, or with iron hinges made from an old wagon tire by the nearest\r\nblacksmith or by the settler himself. There was no knob, no lock,\r\nno bolt.\r\n\r\nIn place of them there was a wooden latch on the inside, which could be\r\nlifted by a person on the outside of the door by a leather strip which\r\ncame through a hole in the door and hung down. When this latch string\r\nwas out, anybody could pull it, lift the latch, and come in. When it was\r\ndrawn inside, nobody could come in without knocking. The floor was made\r\nof "puncheons," or planks split and hewn with an ax from the trunk of a\r\ntree, and laid with the round side down. The furniture the settler\r\nbrought with him, or made on the spot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Hand mill [1]]\r\n\r\nThe household utensils were of the simplest kind. Brooms and brushes\r\nwere made of corn husks. Corn was shelled by hand and was then either\r\ncarried in a bag slung over a horse\'s back to the nearest mill, perhaps\r\nfifteen miles away, or was pounded in a wooden hominy mortar with a\r\nwooden pestle, or ground in a hand mill. Chickens and game were roasted\r\nby hanging them with leather strings before the open fire. Cooking\r\nstoves were unknown, and all cooking was done in a "Dutch oven," on the\r\nhearth, or in a clay "out oven" built, as its name implies, out\r\nof doors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Corn-husk broom [1]]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Kitchen utensils [1]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: From originals in the National Museum, Washington.]\r\n\r\n%306. Clearing and Planting.%--The land about the cabin was cleared\r\nby grubbing the bushes and cutting down trees under a foot in diameter\r\nand burning them. Big trees were "deadened," or killed, by cutting a\r\n"girdle" around them two or three feet above the ground, deep enough to\r\ndestroy the sap vessels and so prevent the growth of leaves.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: For a delightful account of life in the West, read W. C.\r\nHowells\'s _Recollections of Life in Ohio_ (edited by his son, William\r\nDean Howells).]\r\n\r\nIn the ground thus laid open to the sun were planted corn, potatoes, or\r\nwheat, which, when harvested, was threshed with a flail and fanned and\r\ncleaned with a sheet. At first the crop would be scarcely sufficient for\r\nhome use. But, as time passed, there would be some to spare, and this\r\nwould be wagoned to some river town and sold or exchanged for\r\n"store goods."\r\n\r\nIf the settler chose his farm wisely, others would soon settle near by,\r\nand when a cluster of clearings had been made, some enterprising\r\nspeculator would appear, take up a quarter section, cut it into town\r\nlots, and call the place after himself, as Piketown, or Leesburg, or\r\nGentryville. A storekeeper with a case or two of goods would next\r\nappear, then a tavern would be erected, and possibly a blacksmith shop\r\nand a mill, and Piketown or Leesburg would be established. Hundreds of\r\nsuch ventures failed; but hundreds of others succeeded and are to-day\r\nprosperous villages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mississippi produce boat[1]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: From a model in the National Museum at Washington.]\r\n\r\n%307. The New States._--While the northern stream of population was thus\r\ntraveling across New York, northern Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, and into\r\nMichigan, the middle stream was pushing down the Ohio. By 1820 it had\r\ngreatly increased the population of southern Indiana and Illinois, and\r\ncrossing the Mississippi was going up the Missouri River. In the South\r\nthe destruction of the Indian power by Jackson in 1813, and the opening\r\nof the Indian land to settlement, led to a movement of the southern\r\nstream of population across Alabama to Mobile. Now, what were some of\r\nthe results of this movement of population into the Mississippi valley?\r\nIn the first place, it caused the formation and admission into the Union\r\nof six states in five years. They were Indiana, 1816; Mississippi, 1817;\r\nIllinois, 1818; Alabama, 1819; Maine, 1820; Missouri, 1821.\r\n\r\n%308. Slave and Free States.%--In the second place, it brought about\r\na great struggle over slavery. You remember that when the thirteen\r\ncolonies belonged to Great Britain slavery existed in all of them; that\r\nwhen they became independent states some began to abolish slavery; and\r\nthat in time five became free states and eight remained slave states.\r\nSlavery was also gradually abolished in New York and New Jersey, so that\r\nof the original thirteen only six were now to be counted as slave\r\nstates. You remember again that when the Continental Congress passed the\r\nOrdinance of 1787 for the government of the territory lying between the\r\nOhio River and the Great Lakes, Pennsylvania and the Mississippi River,\r\nit ordained that in the Northwest Territory there should be no slavery.\r\nIn consequence of this, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois were admitted into\r\nthe Union as free states, as Vermont had been. Kentucky was originally\r\npart of Virginia, and when it was admitted, came in as a slave state.\r\nTennessee once belonged to North Carolina, and hence was also slave\r\nsoil; and when it was given to the United States, the condition was\r\nimposed by North Carolina that it should remain so. Tennessee,\r\ntherefore, entered the Union (in 1796) as a slave state. Much of what is\r\nnow Alabama and Mississippi was once owned by Georgia, and when she\r\nceded it in 1802, she did so with the express condition that it should\r\nremain slave soil; as a result of this, Alabama and Mississippi were\r\nslave states. Louisiana was part of the Louisiana Purchase, and was\r\nadmitted (1812) as a slave state because it contained a great many\r\nslaves at the time of the purchase.\r\n\r\nThus in 1820 there were twenty-two states in the Union, of which eleven\r\nwere slave, and eleven free. Notice now two things: 1. That the dividing\r\nline between the slave and the free states was the south and west\r\nboundary of Pennsylvania from the Delaware to the Ohio, and the Ohio\r\nRiver; 2. That all the states in the Union except part of Louisiana lay\r\neast of the Mississippi River. As to what should be the character of our\r\ncountry west of that river, nothing had as yet been said, because as yet\r\nno state lying wholly in that region had asked admittance to the Union.\r\n\r\n%309. Shall there be Slave States West of the Mississippi\r\nRiver?%--But when the people rushed westward after the war, great\r\nnumbers crossed the Mississippi and settled on the Missouri River, and\r\nas they were now very numerous they petitioned Congress in 1818 for\r\nleave to make the state of Missouri and to be admitted into the Union.\r\n\r\nThe petitioners did not say whether they would make a slave or a free\r\nstate; but as the Missourians owned slaves, everybody knew that Missouri\r\nwould be a slave state. To this the free states were opposed. If the\r\ntobacco-growing, cotton-raising, and sugar-making states wanted slaves,\r\nthat was their affair; but slavery must not be extended into states\r\nbeyond the Mississippi, because it was wrong. No man, it was said, had\r\nany right to buy and sell a human being, even if he was black. The\r\nSouthern people were equally determined that slavery should cross the\r\nMississippi. We cannot, said they, abolish slavery; because if our\r\nslaves were set free, they would not work, and as they are very\r\nignorant, they would take our property and perhaps our lives. Neither\r\ncan we stop the increase of negro slave population. We must, then, have\r\nsome place to send our surplus slaves, or the present slave states will\r\nbecome a black America.\r\n\r\n%310. The Missouri Compromise.%--Each side was so determined, and it\r\nwas so clear that neither would yield, that a compromise was suggested.\r\nThe country east of the Mississippi, it was said, is partly slave,\r\npartly free soil. Why not divide the country west of the great river in\r\nthe same way? At first the North refused. But it so happened that just\r\nat this moment Maine, having secured the consent of Massachusetts,\r\napplied to Congress for admission into the Union as a free state. The\r\nSouth, which had control of the Senate, thereupon said to the North,\r\nwhich controlled the House of Representatives, If you will not admit\r\nMissouri as a slave state, we will not admit Maine as a free state. This\r\nforced the compromise, and after a bitter and angry discussion it\r\nwas agreed\r\n\r\n1. That Maine should come in as a free, and Missouri as a slave, state.\r\n\r\n2. That the Louisiana Purchase should be cut in two by the parallel of\r\n36\xc2\xb0 30\', and that all north of the line except Missouri should be free\r\nsoil[1]. This parallel was thereafter known as the "Missouri\r\nCompromise Line."\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Compromise was violated in 1836, when the present\r\nnorthwest corner of Missouri was taken from the free territory and added\r\nto that state. See maps, pp. 299 and 348]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AREAS OF FREEDOM AND SLAVERY IN 1820]\r\n\r\nThe admission of Maine and Missouri raised the number of states to\r\ntwenty-four.[1] No more were admitted for sixteen years. When Missouri\r\napplied for admission as a state, Arkansas was (1819) organized as a\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: For the compromise read Woodburn\'s _Historical Significance\r\nof the Missouri Compromise_ (in _Report American Historical\r\nAssociation_, 1893, pp. 251-297); McMaster\'s _History of the People of\r\nthe United States_, Vol. IV., Chap. 39.]\r\n\r\n%311. The Second Election of Monroe.%--This bitter contest over the\r\nexclusion of slavery from the country west of the Mississippi shows how\r\ncompletely party lines had disappeared in 1820. In the course of that\r\nyear, electors of a President were to be chosen in the twenty-four\r\nstates. That slavery would play an important part in the campaign, and\r\nthat some candidate would be put in the field by the people opposed to\r\nthe compromise, might have been expected. But there was no campaign, no\r\ncontest, no formal nomination. The members of Congress held a caucus,\r\nbut decided to nominate nobody. Every elector, it was well known, would\r\nbe a Republican, and as such would vote for the re\xc3\xablection of Monroe and\r\nTompkins. And this almost did take place. Every one of the 229 electors\r\nwho voted was a Republican, and all save one in New Hampshire cast votes\r\nfor Monroe. But this one man gave his vote to John Quincy Adams. He said\r\nhe did not want Washington to be robbed of the glory of being the only\r\nPresident who had ever received the unanimous vote of the electors.\r\n\r\nMarch 4, 1821, came on Sunday. Monroe was therefore inaugurated on\r\nMonday, March 5.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\n1. The dull times on the seaboard, the cheap land in the West, the love\r\nof adventure, and the desire to "do better" led, during 1814-1820, to a\r\nmost astonishing emigration westward.\r\n\r\n2. The rush of population into the Mississippi valley caused the\r\nadmission of six states into the Union between 1816 and 1821.\r\n\r\n3. The question of the admission of Missouri brought up the subject of\r\nshutting slavery out of the country west of the Mississippi, which ended\r\nin a compromise and the establishment of the line 36\xc2\xb0 30\'.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOVEMENT OF POPULATION.\r\n\r\n   _Northern Stream._\r\n\r\n      Effect of hard times in the East.--\r\n      Scenes along the highways.--Arrival\r\n      of the emigrants in the West.--The\r\n      half-faced camp.--The log cabin.--\r\n      Household utensils.--Clearing the\r\n      land.--Growth of towns.\r\n\r\n   _Middle Stream._\r\n\r\n      Moves down the Ohio valley,\r\n      across southern Ohio, Indiana,\r\n      Illinois, and pushes up\r\n      the Missouri.\r\n\r\n   _Southern Stream._\r\n\r\n      The defeat of the Creek Indians\r\n      opens their lands in\r\n      Mississippi Territory to settlement.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis settlement of the West leads to:\r\n\r\n   Admission into the Union of:\r\n\r\n      1816.

Improvement in Means of Travel%.--We have now considered two of\r\nthe results of the rush of population from the seaboard to the\r\nMississippi valley; namely, the admission of five new Western states\r\ninto the Union, and the struggle over the extension of slavery, which\r\nresulted in the Missouri Compromise. But there was a third result,--the\r\nactual construction of highways of transportation connecting the East\r\nwith the West. Along the seaboard, during the five years which followed\r\nthe war, great improvements were made in the means of travel. The\r\nsteamboat had come into general use, and, thanks to this and to good\r\nroads and bridges, people could travel from Philadelphia to New York\r\nbetween sunrise and sunset on a summer day, and from New York to Boston\r\nin forty-eight hours. The journey from Boston to Washington was now\r\nfinished in four days and six hours, and from New York to Quebec in\r\neight days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bordentown, NJ.[1]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: From an old engraving. Passengers from Philadelphia landed\r\nhere from the steamboat and took stage for New Brunswick.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: map: OLD ROUTE FROM NEW YORK TO PITTSBURG]\r\n\r\nIn the West there was much the same improvement. The Mississippi and\r\nOhio swarmed with steamboats, which came up the river from New Orleans\r\nto St. Louis in twenty-five days and went down with the current in\r\neight. Little, however, had been done to connect the East with the West.\r\nUntil the appearance of the steamboat in 1812, the merchants of\r\nPittsburg, Cincinnati, Louisville, and a host of other towns in the\r\ninterior bought the produce of the Western settlers, and floating it\r\ndown the Ohio and the Mississippi sold it at New Orleans for cash, and\r\nwith the money purchased goods at Baltimore, Philadelphia, and New York,\r\nand carried them over the mountains to the West. Some went in sailing\r\nvessels up the Hudson from New York to Albany, were wagoned to the Falls\r\nof the Mohawk, and then loaded in "Schenectady boats," which were\r\npushed up the Mohawk by poles to Utica, and then by canal and river to\r\nOswego, on Lake Ontario. From Oswego they went in sloops to Lewiston on\r\nthe Niagara River, whence they were carried in ox wagons to Buffalo, and\r\nthen in sailing vessels to Westfield, and by Chautauqua Lake and the\r\nAllegheny River to Pittsburg. Goods from Philadelphia and Baltimore were\r\nhauled in great Conestoga wagons drawn by four and six horses across the\r\nmountains to Pittsburg. The carrying trade alone in these ways was\r\nimmense. More than 12,000 wagons came to Pittsburg in a year, bringing\r\ngoods on which the freight was $1,500,000.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Boats on the Mohawk[1]]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: From an old print.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THOMAS HARPER, AGENT FOR INLAND TRANSPORTATION]\r\n\r\nWith the appearance of the steamboat on the Mississippi and Ohio, this\r\ntrade was threatened; for the people of the Western States could now\r\nfloat their pork, flour, and lumber to New Orleans as before, and bring\r\nback from that city by steamboat the hardware, pottery, dry goods,\r\ncotton, sugar, coffee, tea, which till then they had been forced to buy\r\nin the East[1].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: McMaster\'s _History of the People of the United States_,\r\nVol. IV., pp. 397-410, 419-421.]\r\n\r\nThis new way of trading was so much cheaper than the old, that it was\r\nclear to the people of the Eastern States that unless they opened up a\r\nstill cheaper route to the West, their Western trade was gone.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Erie Canal]\r\n\r\n%313. The Erie Canal.%--In 1817 the people of New York determined to\r\nprovide such a route, and in that year they began to cut a canal across\r\nthe state from the Hudson at Albany to Lake Erie at Buffalo. To us, with\r\nour steam shovels and drills, our great derricks, our dynamite, it would\r\nbe a small matter to dig a ditch 4 feet deep, 40 feet wide, and 363\r\nmiles long. But on July 4, 1817, when Governor De Witt Clinton turned\r\nthe first sod, and so began the work, it was considered a great\r\nundertaking, for the men of those days had only picks, shovels,\r\nwheelbarrows, and gunpowder to do it with.\r\n\r\nOpposition to the canal was strong. Some declared that it would swallow\r\nup millions of dollars and yield no return, and nicknamed it "Clinton\'s\r\nBig Ditch." But Clinton was not the kind of man that is afraid of\r\nridicule. He and his friends went right on with the work, and after\r\neight years spent in cutting down forests, in blasting rocks, in\r\nbuilding embankments to carry the canal across swamps, and high\r\naqueducts to carry it over the rivers, and locks of solid masonry to\r\nenable the boats to go up and down the sides of hills, the canal was\r\nfinished.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: McMaster\'s _History_, Vol. IV., pp. 415-418.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Model of a canal packet boat]\r\n\r\nThen, one day in the autumn of 1825, a fleet of boats set off from\r\nBuffalo, passed through the canal to Albany, where Governor De Witt\r\nClinton boarded one of them, and went down the Hudson to New York. A keg\r\nof water from Lake Erie was brought along, and this, when the fleet\r\nreached New York Harbor, Clinton poured with great ceremony into the\r\nbay, to commemorate, as he said, "the navigable communication opened\r\nbetween our Mediterranean seas [the Great Lakes] and the\r\nAtlantic Ocean."\r\n\r\n%314. Effect of the Erie Canal%.--The building of the canal changed\r\nthe business conditions of about half of our country. Before the canal\r\nwas finished, goods, wares, merchandise, going west from New York, were\r\ncarried from Albany to Buffalo at a cost of $120 a ton. After the canal\r\nwas opened, it cost but $14 a ton to carry freight from Albany to\r\nBuffalo. This was most important. In the first place, it enabled the\r\npeople in New York, in Ohio, in Indiana, in Illinois, and all over the\r\nWest, to buy plows and hoes and axes and clothing and food and medicine\r\nfor a much lower price than they had formerly paid for such things. Life\r\nin the West became more comfortable and easy than ever before.\r\n\r\nIn the next place, the Eastern merchant could greatly extend his\r\nbusiness. How far west he could send his goods depended on the expense\r\nof carrying them. When the cost was high, they could go but a little way\r\nwithout becoming so expensive that only a few people could buy them.\r\nAfter 1825, when the Erie Canal made transportation cheap, goods from\r\nNew York city could be sold in Michigan and Missouri at a much lower\r\nprice than they had before been sold in Pittsburg or Buffalo.\r\n\r\n%315. New York City the Metropolis.%--The New York merchant, in other\r\nwords, now had the whole West for his market. That city, which till 1820\r\nhad been second in population, and third in commerce, rushed ahead and\r\nbecame the first in population, commerce, and business.\r\n\r\nThe same was true of New York state. As the canal grew nearer and nearer\r\ncompletion, the people from other states came in and settled in the\r\ntowns and villages along the route, bought farms, and so improved the\r\ncountry that the value of the land along the canal increased\r\n$100,000,000.\r\n\r\nA rage for canals now spread over the country. Many were talked of, but\r\nnever started. Many were started, but never finished. Such as had been\r\nbegun were hurried to completion. Before 1830 there were 1343 miles of\r\ncanal open to use in the United States.\r\n\r\n%316. The Pennsylvania Highway to the West.%--In Pennsylvania the\r\nopening of the Erie Canal caused great excitement. And well it might;\r\nfor freight could now be sent by sailing vessels from Philadelphia to\r\nAlbany, and then by canal to Buffalo, and on by the Lake Erie and\r\nChautauqua route to Pittsburg, for one third what it cost to go\r\noverland. It seemed as if New York by one stroke had taken away the\r\nWestern commerce of Philadelphia, and ruined the prosperity of such\r\ninland towns of Pennsylvania as lay along the highway to the West. The\r\ndemand for roads and canals at state expense was now listened to, and\r\nin 1826 ground was broken at Harrisburg for a system of canals to join\r\nPhiladelphia and Pittsburg. But in 1832 the horse-power railroad came\r\ninto use, and when finished, the system was part railroad and\r\npart canal.\r\n\r\n%317. The Baltimore Route to the West.%--This energy on the part of\r\nPennsylvania alarmed the people of Baltimore. Unless their city was to\r\nyield its Western trade to Philadelphia they too must have a speedy and\r\ncheap route to the West. In 1827, therefore, a great public meeting was\r\nheld at Baltimore to consider the wisdom of building a railroad from\r\nBaltimore to some point on the Ohio River. The meeting decided that it\r\nmust be done, and on July 4, 1828, the work of construction was begun.\r\nIn 1830 the road was opened as far as Ellicotts Mills, a distance of\r\nfifteen miles. The cars were drawn by horses.\r\n\r\nThe early railroads, as the word implies, were roads made of wooden\r\nrails, or railed roads, over which heavy loads were drawn by horses. The\r\nvery first were private affairs, and not intended for carrying\r\npassengers.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The first was used in 1807 at Boston to carry earth from a\r\nhilltop to a street that was being graded. The second was built near\r\nPhiladelphia in 1810, and ran from a stone quarry to a dock. It was in\r\nuse twenty-eight years. The third was built in 1826, and extended from\r\nthe granite quarries at Quincy, Mass., to the Neponset River, a distance\r\nof three miles. The fourth was from the coal mines of Mauchchunk, Pa.,\r\nto the Lehigh River, nine miles. The fifth was constructed in 1828 by\r\nthe Delaware and Hudson Canal Company to carry coal from the mines to\r\nthe canal.]\r\n\r\n%318. Public Railroads.%--In 1825 John Stevens, who for ten years\r\npast had been advocating steam railroads, built a circular road at\r\nHoboken to demonstrate the possibility of using such means of\r\nlocomotion. In 1823 Pennsylvania chartered a company to build a railroad\r\nfrom Philadelphia to the Susquehanna. But it was not till 1827, when the\r\nEast was earnestly seeking for a rapid and cheap means of transportation\r\nto the West, that railroads of great length and for public use were\r\nundertaken. In that year the people of Massachusetts were so excited\r\nover the opening of the Erie Canal that the legislature appointed a\r\ncommission and an engineer to select a line for a railroad to join\r\nBoston and Albany.\r\n\r\nAt this time there was no such thing as a steam locomotive in use in the\r\nUnited States. The first ever used here for practical purposes was built\r\nin England and brought to New York city in 1829, and in August of that\r\nyear made a trial trip on the rails of the Delaware and Hudson Canal\r\nCompany. The experiment was a failure; and for several years horses were\r\nthe only motive power in use on the railroads. In 1830, however, the\r\nSouth Carolina Railroad having finished six miles of its road, had a\r\nlocomotive built in New York city, and in January, 1831, placed it on\r\nthe tracks at Charleston. Another followed in February, and the era of\r\nlocomotive railroading in our country began.\r\n\r\n%319. The Portage Railroad.%--As yet the locomotive was a rude\r\nmachine. It could not go faster than fifteen miles an hour, nor climb a\r\nsteep hill. Where such an obstacle was met with, either the road went\r\naround it, or the locomotive was taken off and the cars were let down or\r\npulled up the hill on an inclined plane by means of a rope and\r\nstationary engine.[1] When Pennsylvania began her railroad over the\r\nAlleghany Mountains, therefore, she used the inclined-plane system on a\r\ngreat scale, so that in its time the Portage Railroad, as it was called,\r\nwas the most remarkable piece of railroading in the world.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Such an inclined plane existed at Albany, where passengers\r\nwere pulled up to the top of the hill. Another was at Belmont on the\r\nSchuylkill River in Philadelphia, and another on the Paterson and Hudson\r\nroad near Paterson.]\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania line to the West consisted of a horse railroad from\r\nPhiladelphia to Columbia on the Susquehanna River; of a canal out the\r\nJuniata valley to Hollidaysburg on the eastern slope of the Alleghany\r\nMountains, where the Portage Railroad began, and the cars were raised to\r\nthe summit of the mountains by a series of inclined planes and levels,\r\nand then by the same means let down the western slope to Johnstown; and\r\nthen of another canal from Johnstown to Pittsburg.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Inclined plane at Belmont in 1835]\r\n\r\nAs originally planned, the state was to build the railroad and canal,\r\njust as it built turnpikes. No cars, no motive power of any sort, except\r\nat the inclined planes, were to be supplied. Anybody could use it who\r\npaid two cents a mile for each passenger, and $4.92 for each car sent\r\nover the rails. At first, therefore, firms and corporations engaged in\r\nthe transportation business owned their own cars, their own horses,\r\nemployed their own drivers, and charged such rates as the state tolls\r\nand sharp competition would allow. The result was dire confusion. The\r\nroad was a single-track affair, with turnouts to enable cars coming in\r\nopposite directions to pass each other. But the drivers were an unruly\r\nset, paid no attention to turnouts, and would meet face to face on the\r\ntrack, just as if no turnouts existed. A fight or a block was sure to\r\nfollow, and somebody was forced to go back. To avoid this, the road was\r\ndouble-tracked in 1834, when, for the first time, two locomotives\r\ndragging long trains of cars ran over the line from Lancaster to\r\nPhiladelphia. As the engine went faster than the horses, it soon became\r\napparent that both could not use the road at the same time; and after\r\n1836 steam became the sole motive power, and the locomotive was\r\nfurnished by the state, which now charged for hauling the cars.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: On the early railroads see Brown\'s _History of the First\r\nLocomotives in America._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The first railroad train in New Jersey (1831)]\r\n\r\nThe puffing little locomotive bore little resemblance to its beautiful\r\nand powerful successors. No cab sheltered the engineer, no brake checked\r\nthe speed, wood was the only fuel, and the tall smokestack belched forth\r\nsmoke and red-hot cinders. But this was nothing to what happened when\r\nthe train came to a bridge. Such structures were then protected by\r\nroofing them and boarding the sides almost to the eaves. But the roof\r\nwas always too low to allow the smokestack to go under. The stack,\r\ntherefore, was jointed, and when passing through a bridge the upper half\r\nwas dropped down and the whole train in consequence was enveloped in a\r\ncloud of smoke and burning cinders, while the passengers covered their\r\neyes, mouths, and noses.\r\n\r\n%320. Railroads in 1835.%--In 1835 there were twenty-two railroads in\r\noperation in the United States. Two were west of the Alleghanies, and\r\nnot one was 140 miles long. For a while the cars ran on "strap rails"\r\nmade of wooden beams or stringers laid on stone blocks and protected on\r\nthe top surface, where the car wheel rested, by long strips or straps\r\nof iron spiked on. The spikes would often work loose, and, as the car\r\npassed over, the strap would curl up and come through the bottom of the\r\ncar, making what was called a snake head. It was some time before the\r\nall-iron rail came into use, and even then it was a small affair\r\ncompared with the huge rails that are used at present.\r\n\r\n%321. Mechanical Inventions.%--The introduction of the steamboat and\r\nthe railroad, the great development of manufactures, the growth of the\r\nWest, and the immense opportunity for doing business which these\r\nconditions offered, led to all sorts of demands for labor-saving and\r\ntime-saving machinery. Another very marked characteristic of the period\r\n1825-1840, therefore, is the display of the inventive genius of the\r\npeople. Articles which a few years before were made by hand now began to\r\nbe made by machinery.\r\n\r\nBefore 1825 every farmer in the country threshed his grain with a flail,\r\nor by driving cattle over it, or by means of a large wooden roller\r\ncovered with pegs. After 1825 these rude devices began to be supplanted\r\nby the threshing machine. Till 1826 no axes, hatchets, chisels, planes,\r\nor other edge tools were made in this country. In 1826 their manufacture\r\nwas begun, and in the following year there was opened the first hardware\r\nstore for the sale of American-made hardware.\r\n\r\nThe use of anthracite coal had become so general that the wood stove was\r\nbeginning to be displaced by the hard-coal stove, and in 1827 fire\r\nbricks were first made in the United States. It was at about this time\r\nthat paper was first made of hay and straw; that boards were first\r\nplaned by machine; that bricks were first made by machinery; that\r\npenknives and pocketknives were first manufactured in America; that\r\nFairbanks invented the platform weighing scales; that chloroform was\r\ndiscovered; that Morse invented the recording telegraph; that a man in\r\nNew York city, named Hunt, made and sold the first lock-stitch sewing\r\nmachine ever seen in the world; that pens and horseshoes were made by\r\nmachine; that the reaping machine was given its first public trial (in\r\nOhio); and that Colt invented the revolver.\r\n\r\n%322. Condition of the Cities.%--Yet another characteristic of the\r\nperiod was the great change which came over the cities and towns. The\r\ndevelopment of canal and railroad transportation had thrown many of the\r\nold highways into disuse, had made old towns and villages decline in\r\npopulation, and had caused new towns to spring up and flourish.\r\nEverybody now wanted to live near a railroad or a canal. The rapid\r\nincrease in manufactures had led to the occupation of the fine\r\nwater-power sites, and to the creation of many such manufacturing towns\r\nas Lowell (in Massachusetts) and Cohoes (in New York). The rise of so\r\nmany new kinds of business, of so many corporations, mills, and\r\nfactories, caused a rush of people to the cities, which now began to\r\ngrow rapidly in size.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: New York in 1830 (St. Paul\'s Chapel, on Broadway)]\r\n\r\nThis made a change in city government necessary. The constable and the\r\nwatchman with his rattle had to give place to the modern policeman. The\r\nold dingy oil lamps, lighted only when the moon did not shine, gave\r\nplace to gas. The cities were now so full of clerks, workingmen,\r\nmechanics, and other people who had to live far away from the places\r\nwhere they were employed, that a cheap means of transportation about the\r\nstreets became necessary. Accordingly, in 1830, an omnibus line was\r\nstarted in New York.[1] It succeeded so well that in 1832 the first\r\nstreet horse-car line in America was operated in New York city.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Many did not know what the word "Omnibus" painted along the\r\ntop of the stages meant. Some thought it was the name of the man who\r\nowned them. It is, of course, a Latin word, and means "for all"; that\r\nis, the stages were public conveyances for the use of all.]\r\n\r\n%323. The Owenite Communities.%--The efforts thus made everywhere and\r\nin every way to increase the comforts and conveniences of mankind turned\r\nthe years 1820-1840 into a period of reform. Anything new was eagerly\r\ntaken up. When, therefore, a Welshman named Robert Owen came over to\r\nthis country, and introduced what he considered a social reform, numbers\r\nof people in the West became his followers. Owen believed that most of\r\nthe hardships of life came from the fact that some men secured more\r\nproperty and made more money than others. He believed that people should\r\nlive together in communities in which the farms, the houses, the cattle,\r\nthe products of the soil, should be owned not by individual men, but by\r\nthe whole community. He held that there should be absolute social\r\nequality, and that no matter what sort of work a man did, whether\r\nskilled or unskilled, it should be considered just as valuable as the\r\nwork of any other man.\r\n\r\nAll this was very alluring, and in a little while Owenite communities\r\nwere started in Indiana, Ohio, Tennessee, Pennsylvania, and New York,\r\nonly to end in failure.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Noyes\'s _History of American Socialism._]\r\n\r\n%324. The Mormons.%--But there was a social movement started at this\r\ntime which still exists. In 1827, at Palmyra, in New York, a young man\r\nnamed Joseph Smith announced that he had received a new bible from an\r\nangel of the Lord. It was written, he said, on golden plates, which he\r\nclaimed to have read by the aid of two wonderful stones; and in 1830 he\r\ngave to the world _The Book of Mormon_.\r\n\r\nAfter the book appeared, Smith and a few others organized a church. Many\r\nat once began to believe in the new religion. But the West seemed so\r\nmuch better a field that in 1831 Smith and his followers started for\r\nOhio, and at Kirtland established a Mormon community. There the Mormons\r\nlived for several years, and then went to Missouri, whence they were\r\nexpelled, partly because they were an antislavery people. In 1840 they\r\nsettled on the banks of the Mississippi in Illinois and built the town\r\nof Nauvoo. At Nauvoo they remained till 1846, when, having adopted\r\npolygamy, they were driven off by the people of Illinois, and, led by\r\nBrigham Young, marched to Council Bluffs, in Iowa. There they stopped to\r\nlook about them for a safe place of abode, and finally, in 1847, left\r\nCouncil Bluffs for Great Salt Lake, then in the dominions of Mexico.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Kennedy\'s _Early Days of Mormonism_.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\n1. The rise of the new states in the West, and the appearance of the\r\nsteamboat on the Mississippi, were the causes of a great revival of\r\npublic interest in internal improvements.\r\n\r\n2. The first to build a great western highway was New York state, which,\r\nbetween 1817 and 1825, built the Erie Canal.\r\n\r\n3. This cut down the cost of moving freight to the West, led to\r\nsettlement along the banks of the canal, and made New York city the\r\nmetropolis of the country.\r\n\r\n4. It was during this period, 1815-1830, that many inventions,\r\ndiscoveries, and improvements were made in the arts and sciences.\r\n\r\n5. The railroad was introduced, and the steam locomotive successfully\r\nused.\r\n\r\n6.

New Political Institutions.%--Of the political leaders of\r\nWashington\'s time few were left in 1825. The men who then conducted\r\naffairs had almost all been born since the Revolution, or were children\r\nat the time.[1] The same is true of the mass of the people. They too had\r\nbeen born since the Revolution, and, growing up under different\r\nconditions, held ideas very different from the men who went before them.\r\nThey were more democratic and much less aristocratic, more humane, more\r\npractical. They abolished the old and cruel punishments, such as\r\nbranding the cheeks and foreheads of criminals with letters, cutting off\r\ntheir ears, putting them in the pillory and the stocks; they partly\r\nabolished imprisonment for debt; they established free schools,\r\nreformatories, asylums, and penitentiaries. They amended their state\r\nconstitutions or made new ones, and extended the right to vote, and\r\nintroduced new political institutions, some of which were of doubtful\r\nvalue, but are still used.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: John Quincy Adams and Andrew Jackson were born in 1767;\r\nHenry Clay, in 1777; John C. Calhoun, Daniel Webster, Martin Van Buren,\r\nand Thomas H. Benton, in 1782.]\r\n\r\n%326. Political Proscription; the Gerrymander.%--One of these was the\r\ncustom of turning men out of public office because they did not belong\r\nto the party in power, or did not "work" for the election of the\r\nsuccessful candidate. As early as 1792 this vicious practice was in use\r\nin Pennsylvania, and a few years later was introduced in New York by De\r\nWitt Clinton. Jefferson resorted to it when he became President, but it\r\nwas not till 1820 that it was firmly established by Congress. In that\r\nyear William H. Crawford, who was Secretary of the Treasury and a\r\npresidential candidate, secured the passage of a "tenure of office" act,\r\nlimiting the term of collectors of revenue, and a host of other\r\nofficials, to four years, and thus made the appointments to these places\r\nrewards for political service.\r\n\r\nAnother institution dating from this time is the gerrymander. In 1812,\r\nwhen Elbridge Gerry was the Republican governor of Massachusetts, his\r\nparty, finding that at the next election they would lose the\r\ngovernorship and the House of Representatives, decided to hold the\r\nSenate by marking out new senatorial districts. In doing this they drew\r\nthe lines in such wise that districts where there were large Federalist\r\nmajorities were cut in two, and the parts annexed to other districts,\r\nwhere there were yet larger Republican majorities.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe story is told that a map of the Essex senatorial district was\r\nhanging on the office wall of the editor of the _Columbian Centinel_,\r\nwhen a famous artist named Stuart entered. Struck by the peculiar\r\noutline of the towns forming the district, he added a head, wings, and\r\nclaws with his pencil, and turning to the editor, said: "There, that\r\nwill do for a salamander." "Better say a Gerrymander," returned the\r\neditor, alluding to Elbridge Gerry, the Republican governor who had\r\nsigned the districting act. However this may be, it is certain that the\r\nname "gerrymander" was applied to the odious law in the columns of the\r\n_Centinel_, that it came rapidly into use, and has remained in our\r\npolitical nomenclature ever since. Indeed, a huge cut of the monster was\r\nprepared, and the next year was scattered as a broadside over the\r\ncommonwealth, and so aroused the people that in the spring of 1813,\r\ndespite the gerrymander, the Federalists recovered control of the\r\nSenate, and repealed the law. But the example was set, and was quickly\r\nimitated in New Jersey, New York, and Maryland. This established the\r\ninstitution, and it has been used over and over again to this day.\r\n\r\n%327. The Third-term Tradition.%--Another political custom which had\r\ngrown to have the force of law was that of never electing a President to\r\nthree terms. There is nothing in the Constitution to prevent a President\r\nserving any number of terms; but, as we have seen, when Washington\r\nfinished his second he declined another, and when Jefferson (in\r\n1807-1808) was asked by the legislatures of several states to accept a\r\nthird term, he declined, and very seriously advised the people never to\r\nelect any man President more than twice.[1] The example so set was\r\nfollowed by Madison and Monroe and had thus by 1824 become an\r\nestablished usage.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: McMaster\'s _With the Fathers,_ pp. 64-70.]\r\n\r\n%328. New Political Issues.%--The most important change of all was\r\nthe rise of new political issues. We have seen how the financial\r\nquestions which divided the people in 1790-1792 and gave rise to the\r\nFederalist and Republican parties, were replaced during the wars between\r\nEngland and France by the question, "Shall the United States be\r\nneutral?" It was not until the end of our second war with Great Britain\r\nthat we were again free to attend to our home affairs.\r\n\r\nDuring the long embargo and the war, manufactures had arisen, and one\r\nquestion now became, "Shall home manufactures be encouraged?" With the\r\nrapid settlement of the Mississippi valley and the demand for roads,\r\ncanals, and river improvements by which trade might be carried on with\r\nthe West, there arose a second political question: "Shall these internal\r\nimprovements be made at government expense?"\r\n\r\nNow the people of the different sections of the country were not of one\r\nmind on these questions. The Middle States and Kentucky and some parts\r\nof New England wanted manufactures encouraged. In the West and the\r\nMiddle States people were in favor of internal improvements at the cost\r\nof the government. In the South Atlantic States, where tobacco and\r\ncotton and rice were raised and shipped (especially the cotton) to\r\nEngland, people cared nothing for manufactures, nothing for internal\r\nimprovements.\r\n\r\n%329. Presidential Candidates in 1824.%--This diversity of opinion on\r\nquestions of vital importance had much to do with the breaking up of the\r\nRepublican party into sectional factions after 1820. The ambition of\r\nleaders in these sections helped on the disruption, so that between 1821\r\nand 1824 four men, John Quincy Adams of Massachusetts, Henry Clay of\r\nKentucky, Andrew Jackson of Tennessee, John C. Calhoun of South\r\nCarolina, were nominated for President by state legislatures or state\r\nnominating conventions, by mass meeting or by gatherings of men who had\r\nassembled for other purposes but seized the occasion to indorse or\r\npropose a candidate. A fifth, William H. Crawford, was nominated by the\r\ncongressional caucus, which then acted for the last time in our history.\r\n\r\nBefore election day this list was reduced to four: Calhoun had become\r\nthe candidate of all factions for the vice presidency.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: John Quincy Adams]\r\n\r\n%330. Adams elected by the House of Representatives.%--The\r\nConstitution provides that no man is chosen President by the electors\r\nwho does not receive a majority of their votes. In 1824 Jackson received\r\nninety-nine; Adams, eighty-four; Crawford, forty-one; and Clay,\r\nthirty-seven. There was, therefore, no election, and it became the duty\r\nof the House of Representatives to make a choice. But according to the\r\nConstitution only the three highest could come before the House. This\r\nleft out Clay, who was Speaker and who had great influence. His friends\r\nwould not vote for Jackson on any account, nor for Crawford, the\r\ncaucus candidate. Adams they liked, because he believed in internal\r\nimprovements at government expense and a protective tariff. Adams\r\naccordingly was elected President. Calhoun had been elected Vice\r\nPresident by the electoral college.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The United States July 4, 1826]\r\n\r\nThe election of John Quincy Adams was a matter of intense disappointment\r\nto the friends of Jackson. In the heat of party passion and the\r\nbitterness of their disappointment they declared that it was the result\r\nof a bargain between Adams and Clay. Clay, they said, was to induce his\r\nfriends in the House of Representatives to vote for Adams, in return for\r\nwhich Adams was to make Clay Secretary of State. No such bargain was\r\never made. But when Adams did appoint Clay Secretary of State, Jackson\r\nand his followers were fully convinced of the contrary[1].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Parton\'s _Life of Jackson_, Chap. 10; Schurz\'s _Life of\r\nClay_, Vol. I., pp. 203-258]\r\n\r\nAs a consequence, the legislature of Tennessee at once renominated\r\nJackson for the presidency, and he became the people\'s candidate and\r\ndrew about him not only the men who voted for him in 1824, but those\r\nalso who had voted for Crawford, who was paralyzed and no longer a\r\ncandidate. They called themselves "Jackson men," or Democratic\r\nRepublicans.\r\n\r\nAdams, it was known, would be nominated to succeed himself, and about\r\nhim gathered all who wanted a tariff for protection, roads and canals at\r\nnational expense, and a distribution among the states of the money\r\nobtained from the sale of public lands. These were the "Adams men," or\r\nNational Republicans.\r\n\r\n%331. Antimasons.%--But there was a third party which arose in a very\r\ncurious way and soon became powerful. In 1826, at Batavia in New York, a\r\nfreemason named William Morgan announced his intention to publish a book\r\nrevealing the secrets of masonry; but about the time the book was to\r\ncome out Morgan disappeared and was never seen again. This led to the\r\nbelief that the masons had killed him, and stirred up great excitement\r\nall over the twelve western counties of New York. The "antimasons" said\r\nthat a man who was a freemason considered his duty to his order superior\r\nto his duty to his country; and a determined effort was made to prevent\r\nthe election of any freemason to office.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Andrew Jackson ]\r\n\r\nAt first the "antimasonic" movement was confined to western New York,\r\nbut the moment it took a political turn it spread across northern Ohio,\r\nPennsylvania, New York, Vermont, and Massachusetts and Rhode Island, and\r\nwas led by some of the most distinguished men and aspiring politicians\r\nof the time[1].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Stanwood\'s _Presidential Elections_, Chap. 18]\r\n\r\n%332. The Election of Jackson.%--When the presidential election\r\noccurred in 1828, there were thus three parties,--the "Jackson men," the\r\n"Administration," and the Antimasonic. But politics had very little to\r\ndo with the result. In the early days of the republic, the mass of men\r\nwere ignorant and uneducated, and willingly submitted to be led by men\r\nof education and what was called breeding. From Washington down to John\r\nQuincy Adams, the presidents were from the aristocratic class. They were\r\nnot men of the people. But in course of time a great change had come\r\nover the mass of Americans. Their prosperity, their energy in developing\r\nthe country, had made them self-reliant, and impatient of all claims of\r\nsuperiority. One man was now no better than another, and the cry arose\r\nall over the country for a President who was "a man of the people."\r\nJackson was just such a man, and it was because he was "a man of the\r\npeople" that he was elected. Of 261 electoral votes he received 178,\r\nand Adams 83.\r\n\r\n%333. The North and the South Two Different Peoples.%--Before\r\nentering on Jackson\'s administration, it is necessary to call attention\r\nto the effect produced on our country by the industrial revolution\r\ndiscussed in Chaps. 19 and 22. In the first place, it produced two\r\ndistinct and utterly different peoples: the one in the North and the\r\nother in the South. In the North, where there were no great\r\nplantations, no great farms, and where the labor was free, the marvelous\r\ninventions, discoveries, and improvements mentioned were eagerly seized\r\non and used. There cities grew up, manufactures nourished, canals were\r\ndug, railroads were built, and industries of every sort established.\r\nSome towns, as Lynn, Lowell, Lawrence, Fall River, Cohoes, Paterson,\r\nNewark, and Pittsburg, were almost entirely given up to mills and\r\nfactories. No such towns existed in the South. In the South men lived on\r\nplantations, raised cotton, tobacco, and rice, owned slaves, built few\r\nlarge towns, cared nothing for internal improvements, and established no\r\nindustries of any sort.\r\n\r\nThis difference of occupation led of course to difference of interests\r\nand opinions, so that on three matters--the extension of slavery,\r\ninternal improvements, and tariff for protection--the North and the\r\nSouth were opposed to each other. In the West and the Middle States\r\nthese questions were all-important, and by a union of the two sections\r\nunder the leadership of Clay a new tariff was passed in 1824, and in the\r\ncourse of the next four years $2,300,000 were voted for internal\r\nimprovements.\r\n\r\nThe Virginia legislature (1825) protested against internal improvements\r\nat government expense and against the tariff. But the North demanded\r\nmore, and in 1827 another tariff bill was prevented from passing only by\r\nthe casting vote of Vice President Calhoun. And now the two sections\r\njoined issue. The South, in memorials, resolutions, and protests,\r\ndeclared a tariff for protection to be unconstitutional, partial, and\r\noppressive. The wool growers and manufacturers of the North called a\r\nnational convention of protectionists to meet at Harrisburg, and when\r\nCongress met, forced through the tariff of 1828. The South answered with\r\nanti-tariff meetings, addresses, resolutions, with boycotts on the\r\ntariff states, and with protests from the legislatures. Calhoun then\r\ncame forward as the leader of the movement and put forth an argument,\r\nknown as the South Carolina Exposition, in which he urged that a\r\nconvention should meet in South Carolina and decide in what manner the\r\ntariff acts should "be declared null and void within the limits of\r\nthe state."\r\n\r\n%334. May a State nullify an Act of Congress?%--The right of a state\r\nto nullify an act of Congress thus became the question of the hour, and\r\nwas again set forth yet more fully by Calhoun in 1831. That the South\r\nwas deeply in earnest was apparent, and in 1832 Congress changed the\r\ntariff of 1828, and made it less objectionable. But it was against\r\ntariff for protection, not against any particular tariff, that South\r\nCarolina contended, and finding that the North would not give up its\r\nprinciples, she put her threat into execution. The legislature called a\r\nstate convention, which declared that the tariffs of 1828 and 1832 were\r\nnull and void and without force in South Carolina, and forbade anybody\r\nto pay the duties laid by these laws after February 1, 1833.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Houston\'s _A Critical Study of Nullification in South\r\nCarolina_; Parton\'s _Jackson_, Vol. III., Chaps. 32-34; Schurz\'s _Life\r\nof Clay_, Vol. II., Chap. 14; Von Holst\'s _Life of Calhoun_, Chap. 4;\r\nLodge\'s _Life of Webster_, Chaps. 6, 7; Rhodes\'s _History of the United\r\nStates_, Vol. I., pp. 40-50.]\r\n\r\nJackson, who had just been re\xc3\xablected, was not terrified. He bade the\r\ncollector at Charleston go on and collect the revenue duties, and use\r\nforce if necessary, and he issued a long address to the Nullifiers. On\r\nthe one hand, he urged them to yield. On the other, he told them that\r\n"the laws of the United States must be executed.... Those who told you\r\nthat you might peacefully prevent their execution deceived you.... Their\r\nobject is disunion, and disunion by armed force is treason."\r\n\r\n%335. Webster\'s Great Reply to Calhoun.%--Calhoun, who since 1825 had\r\nbeen Vice President of the United States, now resigned, and was at once\r\nmade senator from South Carolina. When Congress met in December, 1832,\r\nthe great question before it was what to do with South Carolina. Jackson\r\nwanted a "Force Act," that is, an act giving him power to collect the\r\ntariff duties by force of arms. Hayne, who was now governor of South\r\nCarolina, declared that if this was done, his state would leave\r\nthe Union.\r\n\r\nA great debate occurred on the Force Act, in which Calhoun, speaking for\r\nthe South, asserted the right of a state to nullify and secede from the\r\nUnion, while Webster, speaking for the North, denied the right of\r\nnullification and secession, and upheld the Union and the\r\nConstitution.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Johnston\'s _American Orations_, Vol. I., pp. 196-212;\r\nWebster\'s _Works_, Vol. III., pp. 248-355, 448-505; Rhodes\'s _History\r\nof the United States_, Vol. I., pp. 50-52.]\r\n\r\n%336. The Compromise of 1833%.--Meantime, Henry Clay, seeing how\r\ndetermined each side was, and fearing civil war might follow, came\r\nforward with a compromise. He proposed that the tariff of 1832 should be\r\nreduced gradually till July, 1842, when on all articles imported there\r\nshould be a duty equal to twenty per cent of their value. This was\r\npassed, and the Compromise Tariff, as it is called, became a law in\r\nMarch, 1833. A new convention in South Carolina then repealed the\r\nordinance of nullification.\r\n\r\n%337. War on the Bank of the United States%.--While South Carolina\r\nwas thus fighting internal improvements and the tariff, the whole\r\nJackson party was fighting the Bank of the United States. You will\r\nremember that this institution was chartered by Congress in 1816; and\r\nits charter was to run till 1836. Among the rights given it was that of\r\nhaving branches in as many cities in the country as it pleased, and,\r\nexercising this right, it speedily established branches in the chief\r\ncities of the South and West. The South and West were already full of\r\nstate banks, and, knowing that the business of these would be injured if\r\nthe branches of the United States Bank were allowed to come among them,\r\nthe people of that region resented the re\xc3\xabstablishment of a national\r\nbank. Jackson, as a Western man, shared in this hatred, and when he\r\nbecame President was easily persuaded by his friends (who wished to\r\nforce the Bank to take sides in politics) to attack it. The charter had\r\nstill nearly eight years to run; nevertheless, in his first message to\r\nCongress (December, 1829) he denounced the Bank as unconstitutional,\r\nunnecessary, and as having failed to give the country a sound currency,\r\nand suggested that it should not be rechartered. Congress paid little\r\nattention to him. But he kept on, year after year, till, in 1832, the\r\nfriends of the Bank made his attack a political issue[1].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Roosevelt\'s _Life of Benton_, Chap. 6; Parton\'s _Life of\r\nJackson_, Vol. III., Chaps. 29-31; Tyler\'s _Memoir of Roger B. Taney_,\r\nVol. I., Chap. 3; Von Hoist\'s _Constitutional History_, Vol. II., pp.\r\n31-52; Schurz\'s _Clay_, Vol. L, Chap. 13; _American History\r\nLeaflets_, No. 24]\r\n\r\n%338. The First National Nominating Convention; the First Party\r\nPlatform.%--To do this was easy, because in 1832 it was well known\r\nthat Jackson would again be a candidate for the presidency. Now the\r\npresidential contest of that year is remarkable for two reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Because each of the three parties held a national convention for the\r\nnomination of candidates.\r\n\r\n2. Because a party platform was then used for the first time.\r\n\r\nThe originators of the national convention were the Antimasons. State\r\nconventions of delegates to nominate state officers, such as governors\r\nand congressmen and presidential electors, had long been in use. But\r\nnever, till September, 1831, had there been a convention of delegates\r\nfrom all parts of the country for the purpose of nominating the\r\nPresident and Vice President. In that year Antimasonic delegates from\r\ntwenty-two states met at Baltimore and nominated William Wirt and\r\nAmos Ellmaker.\r\n\r\nThe example thus set was quickly followed, for in December, 1831, a\r\nconvention of National Republicans nominated Henry Clay. In May, 1832, a\r\nnational convention of Democrats nominated Martin Van Buren for Vice\r\nPresident[1]; and in that same month, a "national assembly of young\r\nmen," or, as the Democrats called it, "Clay\'s Infant School," met at\r\nWashington and framed the first party platform. They were friends of\r\nClay, and in their platform they demanded protection to American\r\nindustries, and internal improvements at government expense, and\r\ndenounced Jackson for his many removals from office. They next issued an\r\naddress to the people, in which they declared that if Jackson were\r\nre\xc3\xablected, the Bank would "be abolished." [2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: It was not necessary to nominate Jackson. That he should be\r\nre-elected was the wish of the great body of voters. The convention,\r\ntherefore, merely nominated a Vice President]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: For party platform see McKee\'s _National Platforms of all\r\nParties._]\r\n\r\n%339. Jackson destroys the Bank.%--The friends of the Bank meantime\r\nappealed to Congress for a new charter and found little difficulty in\r\ngetting it. But when the bill went to Jackson for his signature, he\r\nvetoed it, and, as its friends had not enough votes to pass the bill\r\nover the veto, the Bank was not rechartered.\r\n\r\nThe only hope left was to defeat Jackson at the polls. But this too was\r\na failure, for he was re\xc3\xablected by greater majorities than he had\r\nreceived in 1828.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Of the 288 electoral votes, Jackson received 219, and Clay\r\n49. Wirt, the Antimason, secured 7.]\r\n\r\n%340. Jackson withdraws the Government Money from the Bank.%--This\r\nsignal triumph was understood by Jackson to mean that the people\r\napproved of his treatment of the Bank. So he continued to hurt it all he\r\ncould, and in 1833 ordered his Secretary of the Treasury to remove the\r\nmoney of the United States from the Bank and its branches. This the\r\nSecretary[1] refused to do; whereupon Jackson removed him and put\r\nanother,[2] who would, in his place. After 1833, therefore, the\r\ncollectors of United States revenue ceased to deposit it in the Bank of\r\nthe United States, and put it in state banks ("pet banks") named by the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury. The money already on deposit was gradually\r\ndrawn out, till none remained.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: William J. Duane. ]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Roger B. Taney. ]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: Parton\'s _Jackson,_ Vol. III., Chaps. 36-39; _American\r\nHistory Leaflets,_ No. 24; Sumner\'s _Jackson_, Chaps. 13, 14; Von\r\nHoist\'s _Constitutional History,_ Vol. II., pp. 52-79; Roosevelt\'s\r\n_Benton_, Chap. 6. ]\r\n\r\nFor this act the Senate, when it met in December, 1833, passed a vote of\r\ncensure on Jackson and entered the censure on its journal. Jackson\r\nprotested, and asked to have his protest entered, but the Senate\r\nrefused. Whereupon Benton of Missouri declared that he would not rest\r\ntill the censure was removed or "expunged" from the journal. At first\r\nthis did not seem likely to occur. But Benton kept at it, and at last,\r\nin 1837, the Senate having become Democratic, he succeeded[1].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: When the resolution had passed, the Clerk of the Senate was\r\nordered to bring in the journal, draw a thick black line around the\r\ncensure, and write across it "Expunged by order of the Senate, January\r\n16, 1837."]\r\n\r\n%341. Wildcat State Banks.%--As soon as the re\xc3\xablection of Jackson\r\nmade it certain that the charter of the Bank of the United States would\r\nnot be renewed, the same thing happened in 1833 that had occurred in\r\n1811. The legislature of every state was beset with applications for\r\nbank charters, and granted them. In 1832 there were but 288 state banks\r\nin the country. In 1836 there were 583. Some were established in order\r\nto get deposits of the government money. Others were started for the\r\npurpose of issuing paper money with which the bank officials might\r\nspeculate. Others, of course, were founded with an honest purpose. But\r\nthey all issued paper money, which the people borrowed on very poor\r\nsecurity and used in speculation.\r\n\r\n%342. The Period of Speculation.%--Never before had the opportunity\r\nfor speculation been so great. The new way of doing business, the rise\r\nof corporations and manufactures, drew people into the cities, which\r\ngrew in area and afforded a chance for investors to get rich by\r\npurchasing city lots and holding them for a rise in price. Railroads and\r\ncanals were being projected all over the country. Another favorite way\r\nof speculating, therefore, was to buy land along the lines of railroads\r\nbuilding or to be built. Suddenly cotton rose a few cents a pound, and\r\nthousands of people began to speculate in slaves and cotton land. Others\r\nbought land in the West from the government, at $1.25 an acre, and laid\r\nit out into town lots,[1] which they sold for $10 and $20 apiece to\r\npeople in the East. In short, everybody who could was borrowing paper\r\nmoney from the banks and speculating.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Sometimes ten such lots would be laid out on an acre]\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions, any cause which should force the banks to stop\r\nloaning money, or to call in that already loaned, would bring on a\r\npanic. And this is just what happened.\r\n\r\n%343. The Specie Circular.%--Speculation in government land was so\r\ngeneral that the annual sales rose from $2,300,000 in 1831, to\r\n$24,900,000 in 1836.[2] Finding that these great purchases were paid for\r\nnot in gold and silver, but in state bank paper money, Jackson became\r\nalarmed. Many of the banks were of doubtful soundness, and if they\r\nfailed, all their money which the government had taken for land would be\r\nlost. In 1836, therefore, Jackson issued his "Specie Circular," which\r\ncommanded all officials authorized to sell government land to receive\r\npayment in nothing but gold or silver or land scrip. A great demand for\r\nspecie and a removal of it from the banks in the East to those in the\r\nWest followed, which of course hurt the Eastern banks, because it took\r\naway some of their money, and that kind of money which they were holding\r\nfor the purpose of redeeming their paper.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Shepard\'s _Van Buren_, Chap. 8; Sumner\'s _Jackson_, pp.\r\n322-325]\r\n\r\nAnother thing which hurt the banks, by forcing them to stop loaning and\r\nto call for a settlement of debts, was the distribution of the surplus\r\nrevenue among the states.\r\n\r\n%344. The Surplus Revenue.%--What caused this surplus revenue? Many\r\nthings.\r\n\r\n1. The United States had no debt. The national debt, you remember, was\r\ncreated in 1790 by funding the foreign and Congress debt and assuming\r\nthose of the states, and amounted to $75,000,000. When Jefferson was\r\nelected President in 1801, this debt had risen to $80,000,000; but\r\nduring his administration it fell to $57,000,000. The war with England\r\nraised it to $127,000,000, after which it once more decreased year by\r\nyear till 1835, when every dollar was paid off, and the United States\r\nwas out of debt[1].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: As bonds, etc., to the value of $35,000 were never\r\npresented for payment, the United States appears to have always been in\r\ndebt. This $35,000 probably represents evidences of indebtedness lost by\r\nthe owners]\r\n\r\n2. The expenses of the government were not large.\r\n\r\n3. There was a heavy importation of foreign goods, which produced a\r\ngreat revenue under the tariff act.\r\n\r\n4. The immense speculation in government lands already described\r\nproduced a large income to the government[1].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The land sales were $4,800,000 in 1834, $14,757,000 in\r\n1835, and $24,877,000 in 1836]\r\n\r\nIn consequence of these causes, the government on June 1, 1836, had in\r\nthe banks $41,500,000 more than it needed.\r\n\r\nWhat to do with this useless money sorely puzzled Congress. It could not\r\nreduce the tariff, because that was gradually being reduced under the\r\ncompromise of 1833. Some wanted the money derived from the sale of land\r\ndistributed. But at last it was decided to take all the surplus the\r\ngovernment had on January 1, 1837, subtract $5,000,000 from it, and\r\ndivide the rest by the number of senators and representatives in\r\nCongress, and give each state as many parts as it had senators and\r\nrepresentatives[1].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: One state, New York, was to receive $4,000,000, three\r\nstates over $2,000,000, six over $1,000,000, and eight over $500,000]\r\n\r\nOn January 1, 1837, the surplus was $42,468,000, which, after\r\nsubtracting the $5,000,000, left $37,468,000 to be distributed. It was\r\nto be paid in four installments[1]; but only three of them were ever\r\npaid, for, when October 1, 1837, came, the whole country was suffering\r\nfrom a panic[2].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The days of payment were Jan. 1, April 1, July 1, and Oct.\r\n1, 1837]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Bourne\'s _History of the Surplus Revenue of 1837_]\r\n\r\n%345. The Panic of 1837.%--Now, when the banks in which the\r\ngovernment surplus was kept were suddenly called on to give it up in\r\norder that it might be distributed among the states, (as they had\r\nloaned this surplus) they were all forced to call it in. More than that,\r\nthey would make no new loans. This made credit hard to get. As a\r\nconsequence, mills and factories shut down, all buying and selling\r\nstopped, and thousands of workmen were thrown out of employment. As\r\neverybody wanted money, it followed that houses, lands, property of\r\nevery sort, was offered for sale at ridiculously low prices. But there\r\nwere no buyers. In New York the distress was so great that bread riots\r\noccurred. The merchants, unable to pay their debts, began to fail, and\r\nto make matters worse the banks all over the country suspended specie\r\npayment; that is, refused to give gold and silver in exchange for their\r\npaper bills. Then the panic set in, and for a while the people, the\r\nstates, and the government were bankrupt[1].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Shepard\'s _Van Buren_, Chap. 8.]\r\n\r\n%346. Election of Martin Van Buren; Eighth President.%--In accordance\r\nwith the well-established custom that no President shall have more than\r\ntwo terms, Jackson [Illustration: Martin Van Buren] would not accept a\r\nrenomination in 1836. So the Democratic national convention nominated\r\nMartin Van Buren and R.M. Johnson. The Whigs, as the National\r\nRepublicans called themselves after 1834, did not hold a national\r\nnominating convention, but agreed to support William Henry Harrison. Van\r\nBuren was elected, and inaugurated March. 4, 1837[1].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Ibid_., Chap. 7.]\r\n\r\n%347 The New National Debt; the Independent Treasury.%--But scarcely\r\nhad he taken the oath of office when the panic swept over the country,\r\nand his whole term was one of financial distress or hard times. The\r\nsuspension of specie payment and the failures of many banks and\r\nmerchants left the government without money, and forced Van Buren to\r\ncall an extra session of Congress in September, 1837. Before adjourning,\r\nCongress ordered the fourth or October installment of the distributed\r\nrevenue to be suspended. It has never been given to the states.\r\nCongress also authorized the Secretary of the Treasury to issue\r\n$10,000,000 in treasury notes, and so laid the foundation for the second\r\nnational debt, which one cause or another has continued ever since.\r\n\r\nThe experience the government had thus twice passed through (1814 and\r\n1837) led the people to believe it ought not to keep its money in state\r\nbanks. But just where the money should be kept was a disputed party\r\nquestion. The Whigs insisted on a third National Bank like the old one\r\nJackson had destroyed. Van Buren wanted what was called an "Independent\r\nTreasury," and after four attempts the act establishing it was passed\r\nin 1840.\r\n\r\nThe law created four "receivers general" (one each at Boston, New York,\r\nCharleston, and St. Louis), to whom all money collected by the United\r\nStates officials should be turned over, and directed that "rooms,\r\nvaults, and safes" should be provided for the safe keeping of\r\nthe money.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Shepard\'s _Van Buren,_ Chap. 9.]\r\n\r\nAs might be expected, the people laid all the blame for the hard times\r\non Van Buren and his party. The Democrats, they said, had destroyed the\r\nNational Bank; they had then removed the United States money, and given\r\nit to "pet" state banks; they had then distributed the surplus, and by\r\ntaking the surplus from the state banks had brought on the panic.\r\nWhether this was true or not, the people believed it, and were\r\ndetermined to "turn out little Van."\r\n\r\nThe campaign of 1840 was the most novel, exciting, and memorable that\r\nhad yet taken place. Three parties had candidates in the field. The\r\nAntislavery party put forward James Gillespie Birney and Thomas Earle.\r\nThe Democrats in their convention renominated Van Buren, but no Vice\r\nPresident. The Whigs nominated W.H. Harrison, and John Tyler of\r\nVirginia. The mention of the Antislavery party makes it necessary to\r\naccount for its origin.\r\n\r\n%348. The Antislavery Movement%.--The appearance of the Antislavery\r\nor Liberty party marks the beginning in national affairs of an\r\nantislavery movement which had long been going on in the states. When\r\nthe Missouri Compromise was made in 1820, many people believed that the\r\ntroublesome matter of slavery was settled. This was a mistake, and the\r\ncompromise really made matters worse. In the first place, it encouraged\r\nthe men in Illinois who favored slavery to attempt to make it a slave\r\nstate by amending the state constitution, an attempt which failed in\r\n1824 after a long struggle. In the second place, it aroused certain men\r\nwho had been agitating for freeing the slaves to redoubled energy. Among\r\nthese were Benjamin Lundy, James Gillespie Birney, and William Lloyd\r\nGarrison, who in 1831 established an abolition newspaper called the\r\n_Liberator_, which became very famous. In the third place, it led to the\r\nformation all over the North, and in many places in the South, of new\r\nabolition societies, and stirred up the old ones and made them more\r\nactive.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _James G. Birney and his Times_, Chap. 12.]\r\n\r\nFor a time these societies carried on their work, each independent of\r\nthe others. But in 1833, a convention of delegates from them met at\r\nPhiladelphia, and formed a national society called the American\r\nAntislavery Society.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Its constitution declared (1) that each state has exclusive\r\nright to regulate slavery within it; (2) that the society will endeavor\r\nto persuade Congress to stop the interstate slave trade, to abolish\r\nslavery in the territories and in the District of Columbia, and to admit\r\nno more slave states into the Union.]\r\n\r\n%349. Antislavery Documents shut out of the Mails.%--Thus organized,\r\nthe society went to work at once and flooded the South with newspapers,\r\npamphlets, pictures, and handbills, all intended to arouse a sentiment\r\nfor instant abolition or emancipation of slaves. The South declared that\r\nthese were inflammatory, insurrectionary, and likely to incite the\r\nslaves to revolt, and called on the North to suppress abolition\r\nsocieties and stop the spread of abolition papers. To do such a thing by\r\nlegal means was impossible; so an attempt was made to do it by illegal\r\nmeans. In the Northern cities such as Philadelphia, Utica, Boston,\r\nHaverhill, mobs broke up meetings of abolitionists, and dragged the\r\nleaders about the streets. In the South, the postmasters, as at\r\nCharleston, seized antislavery tracts and pamphlets going through the\r\nmails, and the people burned them. In New York city such matter was\r\ntaken from the mails and destroyed by the postmaster. When these\r\noutrages were reported to Amos Kendall, the Postmaster-General, he\r\napproved of them; and when Congress met, Jackson asked for a law that\r\nwould prohibit the circulation "in the Southern States, through the\r\nmails, of incendiary publications intended to instigate the slaves to\r\ninsurrection." From the legislatures of five Southern states came\r\nresolutions calling on the people of the North to suppress the\r\nabolitionists.[1] Congress and the legislatures of New York and Rhode\r\nIsland responded; but the bills introduced did not pass.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: South Carolina, North Carolina, Alabama, Virginia, and\r\nGeorgia.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _James G. Birney and his Times_, pp. 184-194.]\r\n\r\nThis attempt having failed, the mobs again took up the work, and began\r\nto smash and destroy the presses of antislavery newspapers. One paper,\r\ntwice treated in this manner in 1836, was the _Philanthropist_ published\r\nat Cincinnati by James Gillespie Birney. Another was the _Observer_,\r\npublished at Alton by Elijah Lovejoy, who was murdered in defending his\r\nproperty.[1] The _Pennsylvania Freeman_ was a third.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Wilson\'s _Rise and Fall of the Slave Power in America_, Vol.\r\nII., Chap. 27; _James G. Birney and his Times_, pp. 204-219, 241-255.]\r\n\r\n%350. The Gag Rule%.--Not content with attacking the liberty of the\r\npress, the proslavery men attacked the right of petition. The\r\nConstitution provides that "Congress shall make no law ... abridging ...\r\nthe right of the people ... to petition the government for a redress of\r\ngrievances." Under this right the antislavery people had long been\r\npetitioning Congress to abolish slavery in the District of Columbia, and\r\nthe petitions had been received; but of course not granted. Now, in\r\n1836, when John Quincy Adams presented one to the House of\r\nRepresentatives, a member moved that it be not received. A fierce debate\r\nfollowed, and out of it grew a rule which forbade any petition,\r\nresolution, or paper relating in any way to slavery, or the abolition of\r\nslavery, to be received. This famous "Gag Rule" was adopted by Congress\r\nafter Congress until 1844.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Morse\'s _Life of John Quincy Adams, _pp. 249-253, 306-308.]\r\n\r\n%351. The Liberty Party formed%.--The effect of these extreme\r\nmeasures was greatly to increase the antislavery sentiment. But the men\r\nwho held these sentiments were largely members of the Whig and\r\nDemocratic parties. In the hope of drawing them from their parties, and\r\ninducing them to act together, the antislavery conventions about 1838\r\nbegan to urge the formation of an antislavery party, which was finally\r\naccomplished at Albany, N.Y., in April, 1840, where James G. Birney was\r\nnominated for President, and Thomas Earle for Vice President. No name\r\nwas given to the new organization till 1844, when it was christened\r\n"Liberty party."\r\n\r\n%352. The Log Cabin, Hard Cider Campaign%.--The candidate of the\r\nDemocrats (Martin Van Buren) was a shrewd and skillful politician. The\r\ncandidate of the Whigs (Harrison) was the ideal of a popular favorite.\r\nTo defeat him at such a time, when the people were angry with the\r\nDemocrats, would have been hard, but they made it harder still by\r\nridiculing his honorable poverty and his Western surroundings. At the\r\nvery outset of the campaign a Democratic newspaper declared that\r\nHarrison would be more at home "in a log cabin, drinking hard cider and\r\nskinning coons, than living in the White House as President." The Whigs\r\ninstantly took up the sneer and made the log cabin the emblem of their\r\nparty. All over the country log cabins (erected at some crossroads, or\r\non the village common, or on some vacant city lot) became the Whig\r\nheadquarters. On the door was a coon skin; a leather latch string was\r\nalways hanging out as a sign of hospitality, and beside the door stood a\r\nbarrel of hard cider. Every Whig wore a Harrison and Tyler badge, and\r\nknew by heart all the songs in the _Log Cabin Songster_. Immense mass\r\nmeetings were held, at which 50,000, and even 80,000, people attended.\r\nWeeks were spent in getting ready for them. In the West, where\r\nrailroads were few, the people came in covered wagons with provisions,\r\nand camped on the ground days before the meeting. At the monster meeting\r\nat Dayton, O., 100,000 people were present, covering ten acres of\r\nground.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Shepard\'s _Van Buren_, pp. 323-335.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: William H. Harrison]\r\n\r\n%353. William Henry Harrison, Ninth President; John Tyler, Tenth\r\nPresident%.--Harrison was triumphantly elected, and inaugurated March\r\n4, 1841. But his career was short, for on April 4 he died,[2] and John\r\nTyler took his place. Tyler had never been a Whig. He had always been a\r\nDemocrat. Nevertheless, the Whigs, confident of his aid, tried to carry\r\nout certain reform measures.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: His death was a great shock to the people. Two vice\r\npresidents, George Clinton and Elbridge Gerry, had died in office. But\r\nnobody seems to have thought it likely that a president would die.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: John Tyler]\r\n\r\n%354. The Quarrel between Tyler and the Whigs%.--The first thing they\r\ndid was to repeal the law establishing the Independent Treasury. This\r\nTyler approved. They next attempted to re\xc3\xabstablish the Bank of the\r\nUnited States under the name of the "Fiscal Bank of the United States."\r\nTyler, who was opposed to banks, vetoed the bill, and when the Whigs\r\nsent him another to create a "Fiscal Corporation," he vetoed that also.\r\nThen every member of the cabinet save Webster resigned, and at a meeting\r\nof the great Whig leaders Tyler was formally "read out of the party."\r\n\r\n%355. The Webster-Ashburton Treaty%.--Webster was Secretary of State,\r\nand though a Whig, retained his place in order that he might complete a\r\ntreaty which determined our boundary line from the source of the St.\r\nCroix to the St. Lawrence, thus settling a long dispute between Maine\r\nand the British provinces of New Brunswick and Canada. The difficulty\r\narose over the meaning of terms in the treaty of 1783, and though twice\r\nsubmitted to a joint commission, and once to arbitration, seemed further\r\nthan ever from a peaceful settlement when Webster and Lord Ashburton\r\narranged it in 1842. The treaty ratified, Webster soon resigned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:]\r\n\r\nThe people meanwhile had recovered from the excitement of the campaign\r\nof 1840, and at the congressional election of 1842 they made the House\r\nof Representatives Democratic. There were thus a Whig Senate, a\r\nDemocratic House, and a President who was neither a Whig nor a Democrat.\r\nAs a consequence few measures of any importance were passed till 1845.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\n1. During 1789-1825 a marked change had taken place in the ideas of\r\ngovernment, and this led to new state constitutions; to an extension of\r\nthe right to vote; to the belief that no President should have more than\r\ntwo terms; to the belief that political offices should be given to\r\npolitical workers; and to the introduction of the "gerrymander."\r\n\r\n2. The disappearance of issues which divided the Federalists and\r\nRepublicans; the loss of old leaders; the appearance of a new generation\r\nwith new political issues, destroyed old party lines.\r\n\r\n3. First to disappear were the Federalists. In 1820 there was but one\r\npresidential candidate (Monroe), and but one political party (the\r\nRepublican).\r\n\r\n4. During Monroe\'s second term the new issues began to break up the\r\nRepublican party, and in the election of 1824 the people of the four\r\ngreat sections of the country presented candidates. For the second time\r\na President (John Quincy Adams) was elected by the House of\r\nRepresentatives.\r\n\r\n5. In 1828 the Republicans again supported Jackson, and his opponents\r\nunder Adams were defeated. In 1827 the antimasonic party arose.\r\n\r\n6. The issues now before the people were the tariff, the recharter of\r\nthe National Bank, and the use of the surplus revenue, and these became\r\nthe leading questions of Jackson\'s eight years (1829-1837).\r\n\r\n7. The general use of the steamboat, and the good roads, so reduced the\r\ncost of transportation that it was possible to introduce a new piece of\r\npolitical machinery--the national convention--to nominate candidates for\r\nPresident and Vice President.\r\n\r\n8. In Jackson\'s second term the antislavery movement began in earnest;\r\nthe Whig party was organized and named; the national debt was paid off,\r\nand the surplus distributed.\r\n\r\n9. Jackson was followed by Van Buren, in whose administration the great\r\npanic of 1837 occurred. Because of this and hard times a second national\r\ndebt was started. A new financial measure was the establishment of the\r\nIndependent Treasury.\r\n\r\n10. This the Whigs under Tyler destroyed. They attempted to replace it\r\nwith a third National Bank, but were prevented from doing so by\r\nTyler\'s vetoes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTHE INDUSTRIAL, MECHANICAL, AGRICULTURAL, AND SOCIAL PROGRESS\r\nOF OUR COUNTRY BETWEEN 1800 AND 1840 LEADS TO\r\n\r\n_New political ideas_\r\n\r\n   Gerrymandering.\r\n   Extension of the franchise.\r\n   No third term for a President.\r\n   No nomination by congressional caucus.\r\n\r\n_New political issues_.\r\n\r\n   Use of public lands.\r\n   Tariff.\r\n   Internal improvements.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese issues and ideas break up the Republican\r\nparty into factions led in 1824 by\r\n\r\nCrawford and Gallatin, Caucus candidates.\r\n\r\nAnti-caucus candidates.\r\n\r\n   Clay,\r\n   Calhoun,\r\n   Adams,\r\n   Jackson\r\n\r\nElected\r\n\r\n   Adams by House of Representatives.\r\n   Calhoun by electoral college.\r\n\r\nRenominated in 1828.\r\n\r\n   Adams defeated.\r\n   Jackson and Calhoun elected.\r\n\r\n   ________________________________|____________________\r\n   |                         |                       18|32\r\n   |                         |           ______________|_________________________________\r\nTariff.                      |           |               |                              |\r\nOf 1824, opposed             |     Clay defeated.

Texas secures Independence.%--The fact that Tyler now belonged\r\nto no party enabled him to commit an act which, had he belonged to\r\neither, he would not have ventured to commit at that time,--to make a\r\ntreaty of annexation with Texas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: %TERRITORY CLAIMED BY TEXAS% WHEN ADMITTED INTO THE\r\nUNION %1845%]\r\n\r\nIn 1821 Mexico, which for years past had been fighting for independence,\r\nwas set free by Spain, and soon established herself as a republic under\r\nthe name of the United States of Mexico. The old Spanish provinces were\r\nthe states, and one of these provinces was Texas. As a country Texas had\r\nbeen very attractive to Americans, and the eastern part would have been\r\nsettled early in the century if it had been definitely known who owned\r\nit. Now that Mexico owned it, a citizen of the United States, Moses\r\nAustin, asked for a large grant of land and for leave to bring in\r\nsettlers. A grant was made on condition that he should bring in 300\r\nfamilies within a given time. Moses Austin died; but his son Stephen\r\nwent on with the scheme and succeeded so well that others followed his\r\nexample till seventeen such grants had been perfected.\r\n\r\nFor some years the settlers managed their own affairs in their own way.\r\nBut about 1830 Mexico began to rule them harshly, and when they were\r\nunable to stand it any longer they rebelled against her in 1833, and in\r\n1836 set up the republic of Texas. At first the Texans were defeated,\r\nand on two memorable occasions bands of them were massacred by the\r\nMexican soldiers after they had surrendered. Money and troops and aid of\r\nevery sort, however, were sent from the United States, and at length\r\nSanta Anna, the President of Mexico, who commanded the Mexicans, was\r\ndefeated and captured and his army destroyed by the Texans under Samuel\r\nHouston at the battle of San Jacinto (1836). The victory was hailed with\r\ndelight all over our country, and the independence of Texas was\r\nacknowledged by the United States (1837), England, France, and Belgium.\r\n\r\n%357. Texas applies for Admission to the Union.%--As soon as\r\nindependence was acknowledged, the people of Texas became very anxious\r\nto have their republic become a state in our Union; but slavery existed\r\nin Texas, and the men of the free states opposed her admission.\r\n\r\nAt last in 1844 Tyler secretly negotiated a treaty of annexation with\r\nthe Texan authorities, and surprised the Senate by submitting it\r\nin April.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Senate rejected the treaty]\r\n\r\nThe politicians were very indignant, for the national nominating\r\nconventions were to meet in May, and the President by his act had made\r\nthe annexation of Texas a political issue. The Democrats, however, took\r\nit up and in their platform declared for "the reannexation of Texas,"\r\nand nominated James K. Polk of Tennessee for President and George\r\nMifflin Dallas of Pennsylvania for Vice President.\r\n\r\n%358. The Joint Occupation of Oregon is continued.%--But there was\r\nanother plank in the Democratic platform of 1844 which promised the\r\nacquisition of a great piece of free soil. We left the question of the\r\nownership of Oregon at the time when the United States and Great Britain\r\n(in 1818) agreed to hold the country in joint occupation for ten years;\r\nand when Russia, the United States, and Great Britain had (in 1824 and\r\n1825) made 54\xc2\xb0 40\' the boundary line between the Oregon country and\r\nAlaska. Before the ten-year period of joint occupation expired, Great\r\nBritain and the United States, in 1827, agreed to continue it\r\nindefinitely. Either party could end the agreement after a year\'s notice\r\nto the other.\r\n\r\n%359. Attempts to end Joint Occupation.%--Before this time the men\r\nwho came to the Oregon country were explorers, trappers, hunters,\r\nservants of the great fur companies, who built forts and trading\r\nstations, but did little for the settlement of the region. After this\r\ntime missionaries were sent to the Indians, and serious efforts were\r\nmade to persuade men to emigrate to Oregon. Some parties did go, and as\r\na result of their work, and of the labors of the missionaries, Oregon,\r\nin the course of ten years, became better known to the people of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nEfforts were then begun to persuade Congress to extend the jurisdiction\r\nof the United States over Oregon, order the occupation of the country,\r\nand end the old agreement with Great Britain. Petitions were sent\r\n(1838-1840), reports were made, bills were introduced; but Congress\r\nstood firmly by the agreement, and would not take any steps toward the\r\noccupation of Oregon. In 1842, Elijah White, a former missionary, came\r\nto Washington and so impressed the authorities with the importance of\r\nsettling Oregon that he was appointed Indian Agent for that country, and\r\ntold to take back with him as many settlers as he could. Returning to\r\nMissouri, he soon gathered a band of 112 persons and with these, the\r\nlargest number of settlers that had yet started for Oregon, he set off\r\nacross the plains in the spring of 1842. At the next session of Congress\r\n(1842-1843) another effort was made to provide for the occupation of\r\nOregon at least as far north as 49\xc2\xb0, and a bill for that purpose passed\r\nthe Senate.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a rage for emigration to Oregon broke out in the West, and in\r\nthe early summer of 1843, nearly a thousand persons, with a long train\r\nof wagons, moved out of Westport, Missouri, and started northwestward\r\nover the plains. Like the emigrants of 1842, they succeeded in reaching\r\nOregon, though they encountered many hardships.\r\n\r\n%360. "Fifty-Four Forty or Fight."%--So much attention was thus\r\nattracted to Oregon, in 1843, that the people by 1844 began to demand a\r\nsettlement of the boundary and an end of joint occupation. The Democrats\r\ntherefore gladly took up the Oregon matter. Their plan to reannex Texas,\r\nwhich was slave soil, could, they thought, be offset by a declaration in\r\nfavor of acquiring all Oregon, which was free soil. The Democratic\r\nplatform for 1844, therefore, declared that "our title to the whole of\r\nOregon is clear; that no portion of the same ought to be ceded to\r\nEngland or any other power; and that the reoccupation of Oregon and the\r\nreannexation of Texas" were great American measures, which the people\r\nwere urged to support. The people thought they were great American\r\nmeasures, and with the popular cries of "The reannexation of Texas,"\r\n"Texas or disunion," "The whole of Oregon or none," "Fifty-four forty or\r\nfight," the Democrats entered the campaign and won it, electing James K.\r\nPolk and George M. Dallas.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs were afraid to declare for or against the annexation, so they\r\nsaid nothing about it in their platform, and nominated Henry Clay of\r\nKentucky and Theodore Frelinghuysen of New Jersey. The real question of\r\nthe campaign was of course the annexation of Texas, and though the\r\nplatform was silent on that subject their leader spoke out. In a public\r\nletter which appeared in a newspaper and was copied all over the Union,\r\nClay said that he believed slavery was doomed to end at no far away day;\r\nthat the admission of Texas could neither hasten nor put off the arrival\r\nof that day, and that he "should be glad to see" Texas annexed if it\r\ncould be done "without dishonor, without war, and with the common\r\nconsent of the Union and upon just and fair terms."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: James K. Polk]\r\n\r\nLanguage of this sort did not please the antislavery Whigs; and in New\r\nYork numbers of them voted for James G. Birney and Thomas Morris,\r\ncandidates of the Liberty party. The result was that the vote for Birney\r\nin New York in 1844 was more than twice as great as he received in the\r\nwhole Union in 1840. Had half of these New Yorkers voted for Clay\r\ninstead, he would have received the electoral vote of New York and would\r\nhave been President.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: %THE OREGON COUNTRY%]\r\n\r\n%361. Texas annexed to the United States.%--Tyler, who saw in the\r\nresult of the election a command from the people to acquire Texas, urged\r\nCongress in December, 1844, to annex it at once. But in what manner\r\nshould it be acquired? Some said by a treaty. This would require the\r\nconsent of two thirds of the Senate. But the Democrats did not have the\r\nvotes of two thirds of the Senate and so could not have secured the\r\nratification of such a treaty. It was decided, therefore, to annex by\r\njoint resolution, which required but a majority for its passage. The\r\nHouse of Representatives accordingly passed such a resolution for the\r\nadmission of Texas, and with her consent for the formation of four\r\nadditional states out of the territory, those north of 36\xc2\xb0 30\' to be\r\nfree. The Senate amended this resolution and gave the President power to\r\nnegotiate another treaty of annexation, or submit the joint resolution\r\nto Texas. The House accepted the amendment. Tyler chose to offer the\r\nterms in the joint resolution. Texas accepted them, and in December,\r\n1845, her senators and representatives took their seats in Congress.\r\n\r\n%362. Oregon.%--By the admission of Texas, the Democrats made good\r\none of the pledges in their platform of 1844. They were now called on to\r\nmake good the other, which promised the whole of Oregon up to 54\xc2\xb0 40\'.\r\nTo suppose that England would yield to this claim, and so cut herself\r\noff entirely from the Pacific coast, was absurd. Nevertheless, because\r\nof the force of popular opinion, the one year\'s notice necessary to\r\nterminate joint occupation was served on Great Britain in 1846. The\r\nEnglish minister thereupon presented a treaty extending the 49th\r\nparallel across Oregon from the Rocky Mountains to the coast, and\r\ndrawing a line down the strait of Juan de Fuca to the Pacific. Polk and\r\nthe Senate accepted this boundary, and the treaty was proclaimed on\r\nAugust 5, 1846. Two years later, August 14, 1848, Oregon was made a\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\n%363. General Taylor enters Texas; War with Mexico begins.%--When\r\nTexas came into the Union, she claimed as her western boundary the Rio\r\nGrande from its mouth to its source and then a line due north to 42\xc2\xb0.\r\nNow this line was disputed by Mexico, which claimed that the Nueces\r\nRiver was the western boundary of Texas. The disputed strip of territory\r\nwas thus between the Nueces and the Rio Grande (p. 321).\r\n\r\nPresident Polk, however, took the side of Texas, claimed the country as\r\nfar as the Rio Grande, and in January, 1846, ordered General Zachary\r\nTaylor to march our army across the Nueces, go to the Rio Grande, and\r\noccupy the disputed strip. This he did, and on April 25, 1846, the\r\nMexicans crossed the river and attacked the Americans. Taylor instantly\r\nsent the news to Washington, and, May 12, Polk asked for a declaration\r\nof war. "Mexico," said he, "has passed the boundary of the United\r\nStates; has invaded our territory and shed American blood on American\r\nsoil." Congress declared that war existed, and Polk called for 50,000\r\nvolunteers (May 13, 1846).\r\n\r\nWhen the Mexicans crossed the Rio Grande and attacked the Americans at\r\nFort Brown, Taylor was at Point Isabel. Hurrying southward to the relief\r\nof the fort, he met the enemy at Palo Alto, beat them, pushed on to\r\nResaca de la Palma, beat them again, and soon crossed the river and took\r\npossession of the town of Matamoras. There he remained till August,\r\n1846, waiting for supplies, reinforcements, and means of transportation,\r\nwhen he began a march toward the city of Monterey. The Mexicans,\r\nprofiting by Taylor\'s long stay at Matamoras, had gathered in great\r\nforce at Monterey, and had strongly fortified every position. But Taylor\r\nattacked with vigor, and after three days of continuous fighting, part\r\nof the time from street to street and house to house, the Mexican\r\nGeneral Ampudia surrendered the city (September 24, 1846). An armistice\r\nof six weeks\' duration was then agreed on, after which Taylor moved on\r\nleisurely to Saltillo (sahl-teel\'-yo).\r\n\r\n%364. Scott in Mexico.%--Meantime, General Winfield Scott was sent to\r\nMexico to assume chief command. He reached the mouth of the Bio Grande\r\nin January, 1847, and called on Taylor to send him 10,000 men. Santa\r\nAnna (sahn\'-tah ahn\'-nah), who commanded the Mexicans, hearing of this\r\norder, marched at once against Taylor, who took up a strong position at\r\nBuena Vista (bwa\'-nah vees\'-tah), where a desperate battle was fought\r\nFebruary 23, 1847. The Americans won, and Santa Anna hurried off to\r\nattack Scott, who was expected at Vera Cruz. Scott landed there in\r\nMarch, and, after a siege of a few days, took the castle and city, and\r\nten days later began his march westward along the national highway\r\ntowards the ancient capital of the Aztecs. It was just 328 years since\r\nCortez with his little band started from the same point on a precisely\r\nsimilar errand. At every step of the way the ranks of Scott grew thinner\r\nand thinner. Hundreds perished in battle. Hundreds died by the wayside\r\nof disease more terrible than battle. But Scott would not turn back, and\r\nvictory succeeded victory with marvelous rapidity. April 8 he left Vera\r\nCruz. April 18 he stormed the heights of Cerro Gordo. April 19 he was at\r\nJalapa (hah-lah\'-pah). On the 22d Perote (pa-ro\'-ta) fell. May 15 the\r\ncity of Puebla (pweb\'-lah) was his. There Scott staid till August 7,\r\nwhen he again pushed westward, and on the 10th saw the city of Mexico.\r\nThen followed in rapid succession the victories of Contreras\r\n(con-tra\'-rahs), Churubusco (choo-roo-boos\'-ko), Molino del Rey\r\n(mo-lee\'-no del ra), the storming of Chapultepec (chah-pool-ta-pek\'),\r\nand the triumphal entry into Mexico, September 14, 1847. Never before in\r\nthe history of the world had there been made such a march.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: %CAMPAIGN OF GEN. SCOTT%]\r\n\r\n%365. The "Wilmot Proviso."%--In 1846 the Mexican War was very\r\nhateful to many Northern people, and as a new House of Representatives\r\nwas to be elected in the autumn of that year, Polk thought it wise to\r\nend the war if possible, and in August asked for $2,000,000 "for the\r\nsettlement of the boundary question with Mexico." This, of course, meant\r\nthe purchase of territory from her. But Mexico had abolished slavery in\r\n1827, and lest any territory bought from her should be made slave soil,\r\nDavid Wilmot of Pennsylvania moved that the money should be granted,\r\n_provided_ all territory bought with it should be free soil. The proviso\r\npassed the House, but not the Senate. Next year (1847) a bill to give\r\nPolk $3,000,000 with which to settle the boundary dispute was\r\nintroduced, and again the proviso was attached. But the Senate rejected\r\nit, and the House then gave way, and passed the bill without\r\nthe proviso.\r\n\r\n%366. Conquest of New Mexico and California.%--While Taylor was\r\nwinning victories in northeastern Mexico, Colonel Stephen W. Kearny was\r\nordered to march into New Mexico. Leaving Fort Leavenworth in June,\r\n1846, he went by the Upper Arkansas River to Bents Fort, thence\r\nsouthwest through what is now Colorado, and by the old Santa Fe trail to\r\nthe Rio Grande valley and Santa Fe (p. 330). After taking the city\r\nwithout opposition, he declared the whole of New Mexico to be the\r\nproperty of the United States, and then started to seize California. On\r\narriving there, he found the conquest completed by the combined forces\r\nof Stockton and Fr\xc3\xa9mont.\r\n\r\n%367. The Great American Desert.%--But how came Fr\xc3\xa9mont to be in\r\nCalifornia in 1846?\r\n\r\nIf you look at any school geography published between 1820 and 1850 you\r\nwill find that a large part of what is now Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado,\r\nWyoming, Oklahoma, and Texas is put down as "THE GREAT AMERICAN DESERT."\r\nMany believed it was not unlike the Desert of Sahara, and that nobody\r\nwould ever want to cross it, while there was so much fertile land to the\r\neastward. This view made people very indifferent as to our claims to\r\nOregon, so that when Thomas H. Benton, one of the senators from\r\nMissouri, and one of the far-sighted statesmen of the day, wanted\r\nCongress to seize and hold Oregon by force of arms, he was told that it\r\nwas not worth the cost. "Oregon," said one senator, "will never be a\r\nstate in the Union." "Build a railroad to Oregon?" said another. "Why,\r\nall the wealth of the Indies would not be sufficient for such a work."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROUTES OF THE %EARLY EXPLORERS% of the West]\r\n\r\n%368. The Santa F\xc3\xa9 and Oregon Trails.%--Some explorations you\r\nremember had been made. Lewis and Clark went across the Northwest to the\r\nmouth of the Columbia in 1804-1805, and Zebulon M. Pike had penetrated\r\nin 1806 to the wild mountainous region about the head waters of the\r\nPlatte, Arkansas, and Rio Grande and had probably seen the great\r\nmountain that now bears his name. Major Long followed Pike in 1820, gave\r\nhis name to Longs Peak, and brought back such a dismal account of the\r\nWest that he was largely responsible for the belief in a desert. The\r\ngreat plains from the sources of the Sabine, Brazos, and Colorado rivers\r\nto the northern boundary Were, he said, "peculiarly adapted as a range\r\nfor buffaloes, wild Goats, and other wild game," and "might serve as a\r\nbarrier to prevent too great an expansion of our population westward;"\r\nbut nobody would think of cultivating the plains. For years after that\r\nthe American Fur Trading Company of St. Louis had annually sent forth\r\nits caravans into Oregon and New Mexico. Because the way was beset by\r\nhostile Indians, these caravans were protected by large and strongly\r\narmed bands, and in time wore out well-beaten tracks across the prairies\r\nand over the mountain passes, which came to be known on the frontier as\r\nthe Santa F\xc3\xa9 and Oregon Trails. In 1832 Captain Bonneville[1] took a\r\nwagon train over the Rocky Mountain divide into the Green River Valley,\r\nand Nathaniel J. Wyeth led a party from New England to the Oregon\r\ncountry, and in 1834 established Fort Hall in what is now Idaho. Still\r\nlater in the thirties went Marcus Whitman and his party.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Bead his adventures as told by Washington Irving.]\r\n\r\n%369. %Explorations of Fr\xc3\xa9mont.%--By this time it was clear that the\r\ntide of westward emigration would soon set in strongly towards Oregon.\r\nThen at last Benton succeeded in persuading Congress to order an\r\nexploration of the far West, and in 1842 Lieutenant Fr\xc3\xa9mont was sent to\r\nsee if the South Pass of the rocky Mountains, the usual crossing place,\r\nwould best accommodate the coming emigration. He set out from Kansas\r\nCity (then a frontier hamlet, now a prosperous city) with Kit Carson, a\r\nfamous hunter, for guide, and following the wagon trails of those who\r\nhad gone before him, made his way to the pass. He found its ascent so\r\ngradual that his party hardly knew when they reached the summit. Passing\r\nthrough it to the valley beyond, he climbed the great peak which now\r\nbears his name and stands 13,570 feet above the sea.\r\n\r\nThough Fr\xc3\xa9mont discovered no new route, he did much to dispel the\r\npopular idea created by Long that the plains were barren, and the\r\nAmerican Desert began to shrink. In 1843 Fr\xc3\xa9mont was sent out again.\r\nMaking his way westward through the South Pass, where his work ended in\r\n1842, he turned southward to visit Great Salt Lake, and then pushed on\r\nto Walla Walla on the Columbia River (see map on p. 330). Thence he went\r\non to the Dalles, and then by boat to Fort Vancouver, and then, after\r\nreturning to the Dalles, southward to Sutter\'s Fort in the Sacramento\r\nvalley, and so back to the States in 1844.\r\n\r\nIn 1845 Fr\xc3\xa9mont, who had now won the name of "Pathfinder," was sent out\r\na third time, and crossing what are now Nebraska and Utah, reached the\r\nvicinity of Monterey in California. The Mexican authorities ordered him\r\nout of the country. But he spent the winter in the mountains, and in the\r\nspring was on his way to Oregon, when a messenger from Washington\r\novertook him, and he returned to Sutter\'s Fort.\r\n\r\n%370. The Bear State Republic.%--This was in June, 1846. Rumors of\r\nwar between Mexico and the United States were then flying thick and\r\nfast, and the American settlers in California, fearing they would be\r\nattacked, revolted, and raising a flag on which an image of a grizzly\r\nbear was colored in red paint, proclaimed California an independent\r\nrepublic. These Bear State republicans were protected and aided by\r\nFr\xc3\xa9mont and Commodore Stockton, who was on the California coast with a\r\nfleet, and together they held California till Kearny arrived.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: %TERRITORY CEDED BY MEXICO 1818 and 1853%]\r\n\r\n%371. Terms of Peace.%--Thus when the time came to make peace, our\r\narmies were in military possession of vast stretches of Mexican\r\nterritory which Polk refused to give up. Mexico, of course, was forced\r\nto yield, and in February, 1848, at a little place near the city of\r\nMexico, called Guadalupe Hidalgo, a treaty was signed by which Mexico\r\ngave up the land and received in return $15,000,000. The United States\r\nwas also to pay claims our citizens had against Mexico to the amount of\r\n$3,500,000. This added 522,568 square miles to the public domain.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This new territory included not only the present California\r\nand New Mexico, but also Nevada, Arizona, Utah, and parts of Colorado\r\nand Wyoming.]\r\n\r\n%372. The Gadsden Purchase.%--When the attempt was made to run the\r\nboundary line from the Rio Grande to the Gila River, so many\r\ndifficulties occurred that in 1853 a new treaty was made with Mexico,\r\nand the present boundary established from the Rio Grande to the Gulf of\r\nCalifornia. The line then agreed on was far south of the Gila River, and\r\nfor this new tract of land, 45,535 square miles, the United States paid\r\nMexico $10,000,000. It is generally called the Gadsden Purchase, after\r\nJames Gadsden, who negotiated it.\r\n\r\nMuch of this territory acquired in 1848, especially New Mexico and\r\nCalifornia, had long been settled by the Spaniards. But the acquisition\r\nof it by the United States at once put an end to the old Mexican\r\ngovernment, and made it necessary for Congress to provide new\r\ngovernments. There must be American governors, American courts, American\r\njudges, customhouses, revenue laws; in a word, there must be a complete\r\nchange from the Mexican way of governing to the American way. To do this\r\nought not to have been a hard thing; but Mexico had abolished slavery in\r\nall this territory in 1827. It was free soil, and such the\r\nanti-extension-of-slavery people of the North insisted on keeping it.\r\nThe proslavery people of the South, on the other hand, insisted that it\r\nshould be open to slavery, and that any slaveholder should be allowed to\r\nemigrate to the new territory with his slaves and not have them set\r\nfree. The political question of the time thus became, Shall, or shall\r\nnot, slavery exist in New Mexico and California?\r\n\r\n%373. The Free-soil Party.%--As a President to succeed Polk was to be\r\nelected in 1848, the two great parties did their best to keep the\r\ntroublesome question of slavery out of politics. When the Whig\r\nconvention met, it positively refused to make a platform, and nominated\r\nGeneral Zachary Taylor of Louisiana, and Millard Fillmore of New York,\r\nwithout a statement of party principles.\r\n\r\nWhen the Democratic convention met, it made a long platform, but said\r\nnothing about slavery in the territories, and nominated Lewis Cass of\r\nMichigan and William O. Butler.\r\n\r\nThis refusal of the two parties to take a stand on the question of the\r\nhour so displeased many Whigs and Wilmot-Proviso Democrats that they\r\nheld a convention at Buffalo, where the old Liberty party joined them,\r\nand together they formed the "Free-soil party." They nominated Martin\r\nVan Buren and Charles F. Adams, and in their platform made four\r\nimportant declarations:\r\n\r\n1. That Congress has no more power to make a slave, than to make a king.\r\n\r\n2. That there must be "free soil for a free people."\r\n\r\n3. "No more slave states, no more slave territories."\r\n\r\n4. That we will inscribe on our banners "Free soil, free speech, free\r\nlabor, and free men."\r\n\r\nThey also asked for cheaper postage, and for free grants of land to\r\nactual settlers.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs won the election.\r\n\r\n%374. Zachary Taylor, Twelfth President.%--Taylor and Fillmore were\r\ninaugurated on March 5,1849, because the 4th came on Sunday. Their\r\nelection and the triumph of the Whigs now brought on a crisis in the\r\nquestion of slavery extension.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: %Zachary Taylor%]\r\n\r\n%375. State of Feeling in the South.%--Southern men, both Whigs and\r\nDemocrats, were convinced that an attempt would be made by Northern and\r\nWestern men opposed to the extension of slavery to keep the new\r\nterritory free soil. Efforts were at once made to prevent this. At a\r\nmeeting of Southern members of Congress, an address written by Calhoun\r\nwas adopted and signed, and published all over the country. It\r\n\r\n1. Complained of the difficulty of capturing slaves when they escaped to\r\nthe free states.\r\n\r\n2. Complained of the constant agitation of the slavery question by the\r\nabolitionists.\r\n\r\n3. And demanded that the territories should be open to slavery.\r\n\r\nA little later, in 1849, the legislature of Virginia adopted resolutions\r\nsetting forth:\r\n\r\n1. That "the attempt to enforce the Wilmot Proviso" would rouse the\r\npeople of Virginia to "determined resistance at all hazards and to the\r\nlast extremity."\r\n\r\n2. That the abolition of the slave trade in the District of Columbia\r\nwould be a direct attack on the institutions of the Southern States.\r\n\r\nThe Missouri legislature protested against the principle of the Wilmot\r\nProviso, and instructed her senators and representatives to vote with\r\nthe slaveholding states. The Tennessee Democratic State Central\r\nCommittee, in an address, declared that the encroachments of their\r\nNorthern brethren had reached a point where forbearance ceased to be a\r\nvirtue. At a dinner to Senator Butler, in South Carolina, one of the\r\ntoasts was "A Southern Confederacy."\r\n\r\n%376. State of Feeling in the North.%--Feeling in the free states ran\r\nquite as high.\r\n\r\n1. The legislatures of every one of them, except Iowa,[1] resolved that\r\nCongress had power and was in duty bound to prohibit slavery in the\r\nterritories.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Iowa had been admitted December 28, 1846.]\r\n\r\n2. Many of them bade their congressmen do everything possible to abolish\r\nslavery and the slave trade in the District of Columbia.\r\n\r\nThe struggle thus coming to an issue in the summer of 1849 was\r\nprecipitated by a most unlooked-for discovery in California, which led\r\nthe people of that region to take matters into their own hands.\r\n\r\n%377. Discovery of Gold in California.%--One day in the month of\r\nJanuary, 1848, while a man named Marshall was constructing a mill race\r\nin the valley of the American River in California, for a Swiss immigrant\r\nnamed Sutter, he saw particles of some yellow substance shining in the\r\nmud. Picking up a few, he examined them, and thinking they might be\r\ngold, he gathered some more and set off for Sutter\'s Fort, where the\r\ncity of Sacramento now stands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: %Sutter\'s mill%]\r\n\r\nAs soon as he had reached the fort and found Mr. Sutter, the two locked\r\nthemselves in a room and examined the yellow flakes Marshall had\r\nbrought. They were gold! But to keep the secret was impossible. A Mormon\r\nlaborer, watching their excited actions at the mill race, discerned the\r\nsecret, and then the news spread fast, and the whole population went\r\nwild. Every kind of business stopped. The stores were shut. Sailors left\r\nthe ships. Soldiers defiantly left their barracks, and by the middle of\r\nthe summer men came rushing to the gold fields from every part of the\r\nPacific coast. Later in the year reports reached the East, but so slowly\r\ndid news travel in those days that it was not till Polk in his annual\r\nmessage confirmed it, that people really believed there were gold fields\r\nin California. Then the rush from the East began. Some went overland,\r\nsome crossed by the Isthmus of Panama, some went around South America,\r\nfilling California with a population of strong, adventurous, and daring\r\nmen. These were the "forty-niners."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: %San Francisco in 1847%]\r\n\r\n%378. The Californians make a Free-State Constitution.%--When Taylor\r\nheard that gold hunters were hurrying to California from all parts of\r\nthe world, he was very anxious to have some permanent government in\r\nCalifornia; and encouraged by him the pioneers, the "forty-niners," made\r\na free-state constitution in 1849 and applied for admission into\r\nthe Union.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: For an account of this movement to make California a state,\r\nsee Rhodes\'s _History of the United States_, Vol. I., pp. 111-116.]\r\n\r\n%379. Clay proposes a Compromise.%--When Congress met in 1849 there\r\nwere therefore a great many things connected with slavery to be settled:\r\n\r\n1. Southern men complained that the existing fugitive-slave law was not\r\nenforced in the free states and that runaway slaves were not returned.\r\n\r\n2. The Northern men insisted that slavery should be abolished in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia.\r\n\r\n3. Southern men demanded the right to go into any territory of the\r\nUnited States, as New Mexico or Utah or even California, and take their\r\nslaves with them.\r\n\r\n4. The Free-soilers demanded that there should be no more slave states,\r\nno more slave territories.\r\n\r\n5. The North wanted California admitted as a free-soil state. The South\r\nwould not consent.\r\n\r\nSo violent and bitter was the feeling aroused by these questions, that\r\nit seemed in 1850 as if the Union was about to be broken up, and that\r\nthere were to be two republics,--a Northern one made up of free states,\r\nand a Southern one made up of slave states.\r\n\r\nHappily this was not to be; for at this crisis Henry Clay, the\r\n"Compromiser," the "Pacificator," the "Peacemaker," as he was fondly\r\ncalled, came forward with a plan of settlement.\r\n\r\nTo please the North, he proposed, first, that California should be\r\nadmitted as a free state; second, that the slave trade--that is, the\r\nbuying and selling of slaves--should be abolished in the District of\r\nColumbia. To please the South, he proposed, third, that there should be\r\na new and very stringent fugitive-slave law; fourth, that New Mexico and\r\nUtah should be made territories without reference to slavery--that is,\r\nthe people should make them free or slave, as they pleased. This was\r\ncalled "popular sovereignty" or "squatter sovereignty." Fifth, that as\r\nTexas claimed so much of New Mexico as was east of the Rio Grande, she\r\nshould give up her claim and be paid money for so doing.\r\n\r\n%380. Clay, Calhoun, Seward, and Webster on the Compromise.%--The\r\ndebate on the compromise was a great one. Clay\'s defense of his plan was\r\none of the finest speeches he ever made.[1] Calhoun, who was too feeble\r\nto speak, had his argument read by another senator. Webster, on the "7th\r\nof March," made the famous speech which still bears that name. In it he\r\ndenounced the abolitionists and defended the compromise, because, he\r\nsaid, slavery could not exist in such an arid country as New Mexico.\r\nWilliam H. Seward of New York spoke for the Free-soilers and denounced\r\nall compromise, and declared that the territories were free not only by\r\nthe Constitution, but by a "higher law" than the Constitution, the law\r\nof justice and humanity.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Henry Clay\'s _Works_, Vol. II., pp. 602-634.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Johnston\'s _American Orations_, Vol. II., pp. 123-219, for\r\nthe speeches of Calhoun, Webster, and Clay.]\r\n\r\nAfter these great speeches were made, Clay\'s plan was sent to a\r\ncommittee of thirteen, from which came seven recommendations:\r\n\r\n1. The consideration of the admission of any new state or states formed\r\nout of Texas to be postponed till they present themselves for admission.\r\n\r\n2. California to be admitted as a free state.\r\n\r\n3. Territorial governments without the Wilmot Proviso to be established\r\nin New Mexico and Utah.\r\n\r\n4. The combination of No. 2 and No. 3 in one bill.\r\n\r\n5. The establishment of the present northern and western boundary of\r\nTexas. In return for ceding her claims to New Mexico, Texas to receive\r\n$10,000,000. This last provision to be inserted in the bill provided\r\nfor in No. 4.\r\n\r\n6. A new and stringent fugitive-slave law.\r\n\r\n7. Abolition of the slave trade, but not of slavery, in the District of\r\nColumbia.\r\n\r\nThree bills to carry out these recommendations were presented:\r\n\r\n1. The first bill provided for (a) the admission of California as a free\r\nstate; (b) territorial governments for New Mexico and Utah without any\r\n_restriction_ on slavery; (c) the present northern and western boundary\r\nfor Texas, with a gift of money. President Taylor nicknamed this "the\r\nOmnibus Bill," because of its many provisions.\r\n\r\n2. The second bill prohibited the slave trade, but not slavery, in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia.\r\n\r\n3. The third provided for the capture and delivery of fugitive-slaves.\r\n\r\nDuring three months these bills were hotly debated, and threats of\r\ndisunion and violence were made openly.\r\n\r\n%381. Death of Taylor; Fillmore becomes President.%--In the midst of\r\nthe debate, July 9, 1850, Taylor died, and Fillmore was sworn into\r\noffice. Calhoun had died in March. Webster was made Secretary of State\r\nby Fillmore. In some respects these changes helped on the measures, all\r\nof which were carried through. Two of them were of great importance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Millard Fillmore]\r\n\r\n%382. Popular Sovereignty.%--The first provided that the two new\r\nterritories, New Mexico and Utah, when fit to be admitted as states,\r\nshould come in with or without slavery as their constitutions might\r\ndetermine; meantime, the question whether slavery could or could not\r\nexist there, if it arose, was to be settled by the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\n%383. The Fugitive-Slave Law.%--The other important measure of the\r\ncompromise was the fugitive-slave law. The old fugitive-slave law\r\nenacted in 1793 had depended for its execution on state judges. This new\r\nlaw of 1850\r\n\r\n1. Gave United States commissioners power to turn over a colored man or\r\nwoman to anybody who claimed the negro as an escaped slave.\r\n\r\n2. Provided that the negro could not give testimony.\r\n\r\n3. "Commanded" all good citizens, when summoned, to aid in the capture\r\nof the slave, or, if necessary, in his delivery to his owners.\r\n\r\n4. Prescribed fine and imprisonment for anybody who harbored a fugitive\r\nslave or prevented his recapture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: %Results of the COMPROMISE of 1850%]\r\n\r\nNo sooner was this law enacted than the slave owners began to use it,\r\nand during the autumn of 1850 a host of "slave catchers" and "man\r\nhunters," as they were called, invaded the North, and negroes who had\r\nescaped twenty or thirty years before were hunted up and dragged back to\r\nslavery by the marshals of the United States. This so excited the free\r\nnegroes and the people of the North, that several times during 1851 they\r\nrose and rescued a slave from his captors. In New York a slave named\r\nHamet, in Boston one named Shadrach, in Syracuse one named Jerry, and at\r\nOttawa, Illinois, one named Jim, regained their liberty in this way. So\r\nstrong was public feeling that Vermont in 1850 passed a "Personal\r\nLiberty Law," for the protection of negroes claimed as slaves.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: On the Compromise of 1850 read Rhodes\'s _History of the\r\nUnited States_, Vol. I., pp. 104-189; Schurz\'s _Life of Clay_, Vol. II.,\r\nChap. 26. Do not fail to read the speeches of Calhoun, Clay, Webster,\r\nSeward; also Lodge\'s _Life of Webster_, pp. 264-332. For the rescue\r\ncases read Wilson\'s _Rise and Fall of the Slave Power in America_,\r\nChap. 26.]\r\n\r\nThe North was now becoming strongly antislavery. It had long been\r\nopposed to the extension of slavery, but was now becoming opposed to its\r\nvery existence. How deep this feeling was, became apparent in the summer\r\nof 1852, when Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe published her story of _Uncle\r\nTom\'s Cabin_. It was not so much a picture of what slavery was, as of\r\nwhat it might be, and was so powerfully written that it stirred and\r\naroused thousands of people in the North who, till then, had been quite\r\nindifferent. In a few months everybody was laughing and crying over\r\n"Topsy" and "Eva" and "Uncle Tom"; and of those who read it great\r\nnumbers became abolitionists.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\n1. The Mexican state of Texas revolts and in 1837 becomes independent.\r\n\r\n2. President Tyler secretly negotiates a treaty for the annexation of\r\nTexas to the United States, but this is defeated (1844).\r\n\r\n3. The labors of Elijah White and others lead to the rapid settlement of\r\nthe Oregon country.\r\n\r\n4. The annexation of Texas and the occupation of the whole of Oregon\r\nbecome questions in the campaign of 1844. The Democrats carry the\r\nelection, Texas is annexed, and the Oregon country is divided between\r\nGreat Britain and the United States.\r\n\r\n5. The question of the boundary of Texas brings on the Mexican War, and\r\nin 1848 another vast stretch of country is acquired.\r\n\r\n6. The acquisition of this new territory, which was free soil, causes a\r\nstruggle for the introduction of slavery into it.\r\n\r\n7. The refusal of the Whigs and Democrats to take issue on slavery in\r\nthe territories leads to the formation of the Free-soil party.\r\n\r\n8. The discovery of gold in California, the rush of people thither, and\r\nthe formation of a free state seeking admission into the Union force the\r\nquestion of slavery on Congress.\r\n\r\n9. In 1850 an attempt is made to settle it by the "Compromise of 1850."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEMOCRATIC PLATFORM OF 1844 CALLED FOR\r\n\r\nThe reannexation of Texas.\r\n\r\n   Texas annexed, August, 1845.\r\n   Rio Grande asserted as boundary.\r\n   Disputed territory, Nueces to Rio Grande.\r\n\r\n1845-46.

Franklin Pierce, Fourteenth President.%--Although the struggle\r\nwith slavery was thus growing more and more serious, the two great\r\nparties pretended to consider the question as finally settled. In 1852\r\nthe Democrats nominated Franklin Pierce and William E. King, and\r\ndeclared in their platform that they would "abide by and adhere to" the\r\nCompromise of 1850, and would "resist all attempts at renewing, in\r\nCongress or out of it, the agitation of the slavery question." The Whigs\r\nnominated General Winfield Scott, and declared that they approved the\r\nfugitive-slave law, and accepted the compromise measures of 1850 as "a\r\nsettlement in principle" of the slavery question, and would do all they\r\ncould to prevent any further discussion of it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Franklin Pierce]\r\n\r\nSo far as the Whigs were concerned, the question was settled; for the\r\nNorthern people, angry at their acceptance of the Compromise of 1850 and\r\nthe fugitive-slave law, refused to vote for Scott, and Pierce was\r\nelected.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Pierce carried every state except Massachusetts, Vermont,\r\nTennessee, and Kentucky.]\r\n\r\nThe Free-soilers had nominated John P. Hale and George W. Julian.\r\n\r\n%385. The Nebraska Bill.%--Pierce was inaugurated March 4, 1853. He,\r\ntoo, believed that all questions relating to slavery were settled. But\r\nhe had not been many months in office when the old quarrel was raging as\r\nbitterly as ever. In 1853 all that part of our country which lies\r\nbetween the Missouri River and the Rocky Mountains, the south boundary\r\nof Kansas and 49\xc2\xb0, was wilderness, known as the Platte country, and was\r\nwithout any kind of territorial government. In January, 1854, a bill to\r\norganize this great piece of country and call it the territory of\r\nNebraska was reported to the Senate by the Committee on Territories, of\r\nwhich Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois was chairman. Every foot of it was\r\nnorth of 36\xc2\xb0 30\', and according to the Missouri Compromise was free\r\nsoil. But the bill provided for popular sovereignty; that is, for the\r\nright of the people of Nebraska, when they made a state, to have it free\r\nor slave, as they pleased.\r\n\r\n%386. The Kansas-Nebraska Law.%--An attempt was at once made to\r\nprevent this. But Douglas recalled his bill and brought in another,\r\nproviding for two territories, one to be called Kansas[1] and the other\r\nNebraska, expressly repealing the Missouri Compromise,[2] and opening\r\nthe country north of 36\xc2\xb0 30\' to slavery.[3] The Free-soilers, led on by\r\nSalmon P. Chase of Ohio, Seward of New York, and Charles Sumner of\r\nMassachusetts, did all they could to defeat the bill; but it passed, and\r\nPierce signed it and made it law.[4]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The northern and southern boundaries of Kansas were those\r\nof the present state, but it extended westward to the Rocky Mountains.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: It declared that the slavery restriction of the Missouri\r\nCompromise "was suspended by the principles of the legislation of 1850,\r\ncommonly called the compromise measures, and is hereby declared\r\ninoperative."]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: The "true intent and meaning" of this act, said the law,\r\nis, "not to legislate slavery into any territory or state, nor to\r\nexclude it therefrom, but to leave the people thereof perfectly free to\r\nform and regulate their domestic institutions in their own way, subject\r\nonly to the Constitution of the United States." Read Rhodes\'s _History\r\nof the United States_, Vol. I., pp. 425-490.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: May 30, 1854.]\r\n\r\n%387. The Struggle for Kansas.%--Thus was it ordained that Kansas and\r\nNebraska, once expressly set apart as free soil, should become free or\r\nslave states according as they were settled while territories by\r\nantislavery or proslavery men. And now began a seven years\' struggle for\r\nKansas. "Come on, then," said Seward of New York in a speech against\r\nthe Kansas Bill; "Come on, then, gentlemen of the slave states. Since\r\nthere is no escaping your challenge, I accept it on behalf of freedom.\r\nWe will engage in competition for the virgin soil of Kansas, and God\r\ngive the victory to the side that is stronger in numbers as it is in\r\nthe right."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: %THE UNITED STATES in 1851 SEVENTY FIVE YEARS AFTER\r\nINDEPENDENCE Showing Railroads and Overland Routes]\r\n\r\nThis described the situation exactly. The free-state men of the North\r\nand the slave-state men of the South were to rush into Kansas and\r\nstruggle for its possession. The moment the law opening Kansas for\r\nsettlement was known in Missouri, numbers of men crossed the Missouri\r\nRiver, entered the territory, held squatters\' meetings,[1] drove a few\r\nstakes into the ground to represent "squatter claims," went home, and\r\ncalled on the people of the South to hurry into Kansas. Many did so, and\r\nbegan to erect tents and huts on the Missouri River at a place which\r\nthey called Atchison.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: At one of their meetings it was resolved: "That we will\r\nafford protection to no abolitionist as a settler of this country."\r\n"That we recognize the institution of slavery as already existing in\r\nthis territory, and advise stockholders to introduce their property as\r\nearly as possible."]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Called after Senator Atchison of Missouri.]\r\n\r\nBut the men of the North had not been idle, and in July a band of\r\nfree-state men, sent on by the New England Emigrant Aid Society,[1]\r\nentered Kansas and founded a town on the Kansas River some miles to the\r\nsouth and west of Atchison. Other emigrants came in a few weeks later,\r\nand their collection of tents received the name of Lawrence.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The New England Emigrant Aid Society was founded in 1854 by\r\nHon. Eli Thayer of Worcester, Mass., in order "to plant a free state in\r\nKansas," by aiding antislavery men to go out there and settle.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: After Amos A. Lawrence, secretary of the Aid Society. It\r\nwas a city of tents. Not a building existed. Later came the log cabin,\r\nwhich was a poor affair, as timber was scarce. The sod hut now so common\r\nin the Northwest was not thought of. In the early days the "hay tent"\r\nwas the usual house, and was made by setting up two rows of poles, then\r\nbringing their tops together, thatching the roof and sides with hay. The\r\ntwo gable ends (in which were the windows and doors) were of sod.]\r\n\r\nWhat was thus taking place at Lawrence happened elsewhere, so that by\r\nOctober, 1854, that part of Kansas along the Missouri River was held by\r\nthe slave-state men, and the part south of the Kansas River by the\r\nfree-state men.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The proslavery towns were Atchison, Leavenworth, Lecompton,\r\nKickapoo. The antislavery towns were Lawrence, Topeka, Manhattan,\r\nWaubunsee, Hampden, Ossawatomie.]\r\n\r\nIn November of the same year the struggle began. There was to be an\r\nelection of a territorial delegate[1] to represent Kansas in Congress,\r\nand a day or two before the time set for it the Missourians came over\r\nthe border in armed bands, took possession of the polls, voted\r\nillegally, and elected a proslavery delegate.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Each territory is allowed to send a delegate to the House\r\nof Representatives, where he can speak, but not vote.]\r\n\r\n%388. Kansas a Slave Territory.%--The election of members of the\r\nterritorial legislature took place in March, 1855, and for this the\r\nMissourians made great preparations. On the principle of popular\r\nsovereignty the people of Kansas were to decide whether the territory\r\nshould be slave or free. Should the majority of the legislature consist\r\nof free-state men, then Kansas would be a free territory. Should a\r\nmajority of proslavery men be chosen, then Kansas was doomed to have\r\nslavery fastened on her, and this the Missourians determined should be\r\ndone. For weeks before the election, therefore, the border counties of\r\nMissouri were all astir. Meetings were held, and secret societies,\r\ncalled Blue Lodges, were formed, the members of which were pledged to\r\nenter Kansas on the day of election, take possession of the polls, and\r\nelect a proslavery legislature. The plan was strictly carried out, and\r\nas election day drew near, the Missourians, fully armed, entered Kansas\r\nin companies, squads, and parties, like an invading army, voted, and\r\nthen went home to Missouri. Every member of the legislature save one was\r\na proslavery man, and when that body met, all the slave laws of Missouri\r\nwere adopted and slavery was formally established in Kansas.\r\n\r\n%389. The Topeka Free-State Constitution.%--The free-state men\r\nrepudiated the bogus legislature, held a convention at Topeka, made a\r\nfree-state constitution, and submitted it to the popular vote. The\r\npeople having ratified it (of course no proslavery men voted), a\r\ngovernor and legislature were chosen. When the legislature met, senators\r\nwere elected and Congress was asked to admit Kansas into the Union as\r\na state.\r\n\r\n%390. Personal Liberty Laws; the Underground Railroad.%--The feeling\r\nof the people of the free states toward slavery can be seen from many\r\nsigns. The example set by Vermont in 1850 was followed in 1854 by Rhode\r\nIsland, Connecticut, and Michigan, and in 1855 by Maine and\r\nMassachusetts, in each of which were passed "Personal Liberty laws,"\r\ndesigned to prevent free negroes from being carried into slavery on the\r\nclaim that they were fugitive slaves. Certain state officers were\r\nrequired to act as counsel for any one arrested as a fugitive, and to\r\nsee that he had a fair trial by jury. To seize a free negro with intent\r\nto reduce him to slavery was made a crime.\r\n\r\nAnother sign of the times was the sympathy manifested for the operations\r\nof what was called the Underground Railroad. It was, of course, not a\r\nrailroad at all, but an organization by which slaves escaping from their\r\nmasters were aided in getting across the free states to Canada.\r\n\r\n%391. Breaking up of Old Parties.%--Thus matters stood when, in 1856,\r\nthe time came to elect a President, and found the old parties badly\r\ndisorganized. The political events of four years had produced great\r\nchanges. The death of Clay[1] and Webster[2] deprived the Whigs of their\r\noldest and greatest leaders. The earnest support that party gave to the\r\nCompromise of 1850 and the execution of the fugitive-slave law estranged\r\nthousands of voters in the free states. The Kansas-Nebraska Bill,\r\nopposed as it was by every Northern Whig, completed the ruin and left\r\nthe party a wreck.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: June 29, 1852.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: October 24, 1852.]\r\n\r\nBut the Democrats had also suffered because of the Kansas-Nebraska law\r\nand the repeal of the Compromise of 1820. No anti-extension-of-slavery\r\nDemocrat could longer support the old party. Thousands had therefore\r\nbroken away, and, acting with the dissatisfied Whigs, formed an\r\nunorganized opposition known as "Anti-Nebraska men."\r\n\r\n%392. The Movement against Immigrants.%--Many old Whigs, however,\r\ncould not bring themselves to vote with Democrats. These joined the\r\nAmerican or Know-nothing party. From the close of the Revolution there\r\nhad never been a year when a greater or less number of foreigners did\r\nnot come to our shores. After 1820 the numbers who came each twelvemonth\r\ngrew larger and larger, till they reached 30,000 in 1830, and 60,000 in\r\n1836, while in the decade 1830-1840 more than 500,000 immigrants landed\r\nat New York city alone.\r\n\r\nAs the newcomers hurried westward into the cities of the Mississippi\r\nvalley, the native population was startled by the appearance of men who\r\noften could not speak our language. In Cincinnati in 1840 one half the\r\nvoters were of foreign birth. The cry was now raised that our\r\ninstitutions, our liberties, our system of government, were at the mercy\r\nof men from the monarchical countries of Europe. A demand was made for a\r\nchange in the naturalization law, so that no foreigner could become a\r\ncitizen till he had lived here twenty-one years.\r\n\r\n%393. The American Republicans or Native Americans.%--Neither the\r\nWhigs nor the Democrats would endorse this demand, so the people of\r\nLouisiana in 1841 called a state convention and founded the American\r\nRepublican, or, as it was soon called, the Native American party. Its\r\nprinciples were\r\n\r\n1. Put none but native Americans in office.\r\n\r\n2. Require a residence of twenty-one years in this country before\r\nnaturalization.\r\n\r\n3. Keep the Bible in the schools.\r\n\r\n4. Protect from abuse the proceedings necessary to get naturalization\r\npapers.\r\n\r\nAs the members would not tell what the secrets of this party were, and\r\nvery often would not say whom they were going to vote for, and when\r\nquestioned would answer "I don\'t know," it got the name of\r\n"Know-nothing" party.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Rhodes\'s _History of the United States_, Vol. II., pp.\r\n51-58; McMaster\'s _With the Fathers_, pp. 87-106.]\r\n\r\nFor a time the party flourished greatly and secured six members of the\r\nHouse of Representatives, then it declined in power; but the immense\r\nincrease in immigration between 1846 and 1850 again revived it, and.\r\nsomewhere in New York city in 1852 a secret, oath-bound organization,\r\nwith signs, grips, and passwords, was founded, and spread with such\r\nrapidity that in 1854 it carried the elections in Massachusetts, New\r\nYork, and Delaware. Next year (1855) it elected the governors and\r\nlegislatures of eight states, and nearly carried six more. Encouraged by\r\nthese successes, the leaders determined to enter the campaign of 1856,\r\nand called a party convention which nominated Millard Fillmore and\r\nAndrew Jackson Donelson. Delegates from seven states left the convention\r\nbecause it would not stand by the Missouri Compromise, and taking the\r\nname North Americans nominated N. P. Banks. He would not accept, and the\r\nbolters then joined the Republicans.\r\n\r\n%394. Beginning of the Republican Party.%--As early as 1854, when the\r\nKansas-Nebraska Bill was before Congress, the question was widely\r\ndiscussed all over the North and West, whether the time had not come to\r\nform a new party out of the wreck of the old. With this in view a\r\nmeeting of citizens of all parties was held at Ripon, Wisconsin, at\r\nwhich the formation of a new party on the slavery issue was recommended,\r\nand the name Republican suggested. This was before the passage of the\r\nKansas-Nebraska Bill.\r\n\r\nAfter its passage a thousand citizens of Michigan signed a call for a\r\nstate mass meeting at Jackson, where a state party was formed, named\r\nRepublican, and a state ticket nominated, on which were Free-soilers,\r\nWhigs, and Anti-Nebraska Democrats. Similar "fusion tickets" were\r\nadopted in Wisconsin and Vermont, where the name Republican was used,\r\nand in Iowa, Illinois, Indiana, Ohio, New Hampshire, and Connecticut.\r\n\r\nThe success of the new party in Wisconsin and Michigan in 1854, and its\r\nyet greater success in 1855, led the chairmen of the Republican state\r\ncommittees of Ohio, Pennsylvania, Massachusetts, Vermont, and Wisconsin\r\nto issue a call for an informal convention at Pittsburg on February 22,\r\n1856. At this meeting the National Republican party was formed, and from\r\nit went a call for a national nominating convention to meet (June 17,\r\n1856) at Philadelphia, where John C. Fr\xc3\xa9mont and William L. Dayton were\r\nnominated.\r\n\r\nThe Free-soilers had joined the Republicans and so disappeared from\r\npolitics as a party.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs, or "Silver Grays," met and endorsed Fillmore.\r\n\r\nThe Democrats nominated James Buchanan and John C. Breckinridge and\r\ncarried the election. The Whigs and the Know-nothings then disappeared\r\nfrom national politics.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: James Buchanan]\r\n\r\n%395. James Buchanan, Fifteenth President; the "Bred Scott\r\nDecision."%--When Buchanan and Breckinridge were inaugurated, March\r\n4, 1857, certain matters regarding slavery were considered as legally\r\nsettled forever, as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Foreign slave trade forbidden.\r\n\r\n2. Slave trade between the states allowed.\r\n\r\n3. Fugitive slaves to be returned.\r\n\r\n4. Whether a state should permit or abolish slavery to be determined by\r\nthe state.\r\n\r\n5. Squatter sovereignty to be allowed in Kansas and Nebraska, Utah and\r\nNew Mexico territories.\r\n\r\n6. The people in a territory to determine whether they would have a\r\nslave or a free state when they made a state constitution.\r\n\r\nNow there were certain questions regarding slavery which were not\r\nsettled, and one of them was this: If a slave is taken by his master to\r\na free state and lives there for a while, does he become free?\r\n\r\nTo this the Supreme Court gave the answer two days after Buchanan was\r\ninaugurated. A slave by the name of Dred Scott had been taken by his\r\nmaster from the slave state of Missouri to the free state of Illinois,\r\nand then to the free soil of Minnesota, and then back to the state of\r\nMissouri, where Scott sued for his freedom, on the ground that his\r\nresidence on free soil had made him a free man. Two questions of vast\r\nimportance were thus raised:\r\n\r\n1. Could a negro whose ancestors had been sold as slaves become a\r\ncitizen of one of the states in the Union? For unless Dred Scott was a\r\ncitizen of Missouri, where he then lived, he could not sue in the United\r\nStates court.\r\n\r\n2. Did Congress have power to enact the Missouri Compromise? For if it\r\ndid not then the restriction of slavery north of 36\xc2\xb030\' was illegal, and\r\nDred Scott\'s residence in Minnesota did not make him free.\r\n\r\nFrom the lower courts the case came on appeal to the Supreme Court,\r\nwhich decided\r\n\r\n1. That Dred Scott was not a citizen, and therefore could not sue in the\r\nUnited States courts. His residence in Minnesota had not made him free.\r\n\r\n2. That Congress could not shut slave property out of the territories\r\nany more than it could shut out a horse or a cow.\r\n\r\n3. That the piece of legislation known as the Missouri Compromise of\r\n1820 was null and void. This confirmed all that had been gained for\r\nslavery by the Kansas-Nebraska Act of 1854, and opened to slavery Oregon\r\nand Washington, which were free territories.\r\n\r\n%396. Effect of the Dred Scott Decision.%--Hundreds of thousands of\r\ncopies of this famous decision were printed at once and scattered\r\nbroadcast over the country as campaign documents. The effect was to fill\r\nthe Southern people with delight and make them more reckless than ever,\r\nto split the Democratic party in the North; to increase the number of\r\nRepublicans in the North, and make them more determined than ever to\r\nstop the spread of slavery into the territories.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: %EXPANSION OF SLAVE SOIL IN THE UNITED STATES\r\n1790-1860%]\r\n\r\n%397. Struggle for Freedom in Kansas.%--We left Kansas in 1856 with a\r\nproslavery governor and legislature in actual possession, and a\r\nfree-state governor, legislature, and senators seeking recognition at\r\nWashington. In 1857 there were so many free-state men in Kansas that\r\nthey elected an antislavery legislature. But just before the proslavery\r\nmen went out of power they made a proslavery constitution,[1] and\r\ninstead of submitting to the people the question, Will you, or will you\r\nnot, have this constitution? they submitted the question, Will you have\r\nthis constitution with or without slavery? On this the free settlers\r\nwould not vote, and so it was adopted with slavery. But when the\r\nantislavery legislature met soon after, they ordered the question, Will\r\nyou, or will you not, have this constitution? to be submitted to the\r\npeople. Then the free settlers voted, and it was rejected by a great\r\nmajority. Buchanan, however, paid no attention to the action of the free\r\nsettlers, but sent the Lecompton constitution to Congress and urged it\r\nto admit Kansas as a slave state. But Senator Douglas of Illinois came\r\nforward and opposed this, because to force a slave constitution on the\r\npeople of Kansas, after they had voted against it, was contrary to the\r\ndoctrine of "popular sovereignty." He, with the aid of other Northern\r\nDemocrats, defeated the attempt, and Kansas remained a territory\r\ntill 1861.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The convention met at the town of Lecompton; in consequence\r\nof which the constitution is known as the "Lecompton constitution."]\r\n\r\n%398. The Lincoln-Douglas Debates.%--The term of Douglas as senator\r\nfrom Illinois was to expire on March 4, 1859. The legislature whose duty\r\nit would be to elect his successor was itself to be elected in 1858. The\r\nDemocrats, therefore, announced that if they secured a majority of the\r\nlegislators, they would reelect Douglas. The Republicans declared that\r\nif they secured a majority, they would elect Abraham Lincoln United\r\nStates senator. The real question of the campaign thus became, Will the\r\npeople of Illinois have Stephen A. Douglas or Abraham Lincoln for\r\nsenator?[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Republican state convention at Springfield, June 16,\r\n1858, "resolved, that Abraham Lincoln is the first and only choice of\r\nthe Republicans of Illinois for the United States Senate as the\r\nsuccessor of Stephen A. Douglas."]\r\n\r\nThe speech making opened in June, 1858, when Lincoln addressed the\r\nconvention that nominated him at Springfield. A month later Douglas\r\nreplied in a speech at Chicago. Lincoln, who was present, answered\r\nDouglas the next evening. A few days later, Douglas, who had taken the\r\nstump, replied to Lincoln at Bloomington, and the next day was again\r\nanswered by Lincoln at Springfield. The deep interest aroused by this\r\nrunning debate led the Republican managers to insist that Lincoln should\r\nchallenge Douglas to a series of joint debates in public. The challenge\r\nwas sent and accepted, and debates were arranged for at seven towns[1]\r\nnamed by Douglas. The questions discussed were popular sovereignty, the\r\nDred Scott decision, the extension of slavery to the territories; and\r\nthe discussion of them attracted the attention of the whole country.\r\nLincoln was defeated in the senatorial election; but his great speeches\r\nwon for him a national reputation.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: One in each Congressional district except those containing\r\nChicago and Springfield, where both Lincoln and Douglas had already\r\nspoken. For a short account of their debates see the _Century Magazine_\r\nfor July, 1887, p. 386.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Rhodes\'s _History of the United States_, Vol. II., pp.\r\n308-339. Nicolay and Hay\'s _Life of Lincoln_, Vol. II., Chaps. 10-16.\r\nJohn T. Morse\'s _Life of Lincoln_, Vol. I., Chap. 6.]\r\n\r\n%399. John Brown\'s Raid into Virginia%.--As slavery had become the\r\ngreat political issue of the day, it is not surprising that it excited a\r\nlifelong and bitter enemy of slavery to do a foolish act. John Brown was\r\na man of intense convictions and a deep-seated hatred of slavery. When\r\nthe border ruffianism broke out in Kansas in 1855, he went there with\r\narms and money, and soon became so prominent that he was outlawed and a\r\nprice set on his head. In 1858 he left Kansas, and in July, 1859,\r\nsettled near Harpers Ferry, Va. (p. 360). His purpose was to stir up a\r\nslave insurrection in Virginia, and so secure the liberation of the\r\nnegroes. With this in view, one Sunday night in October, 1859, he with\r\nless than twenty followers seized the United States armory at Harpers\r\nPerry and freed as many slaves and arrested as many whites as possible.\r\nBut no insurrection or uprising of slaves followed, and before he could\r\nescape to the mountains he was surrounded and captured by Robert E. Lee,\r\nthen a colonel in the army of the United States. Brown was tried on the\r\ncharges of murder and of treason against the state of Virginia, was\r\nfound guilty, and in December, 1859, was hanged.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Harpers Ferry]\r\n\r\n%400. Split in the Democratic Party.%--Thus it was that one event\r\nafter another prolonged the struggle with slavery till 1860, when the\r\npeople were once more to elect a President.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic nominating convention assembled at Charleston, S.C., in\r\nApril, and at once went to pieces. A strong majority made up of Northern\r\ndelegates insisted that the party should declare--"That all questions in\r\nregard to the rights of property in states or territories arising under\r\nthe Constitution of the United States are judicial in their character,\r\nand the Democratic party is pledged to abide by and faithfully carry out\r\nsuch determination of these questions as has been or may be made by the\r\nSupreme Court of the United States."\r\n\r\nThis meant to carry out the doctrine laid down in the Dred Scott\r\ndecision, and was in conflict with the "popular sovereignty" doctrine of\r\nDouglas, which was that right of the people to make a slave territory or\r\na free territory is perfect and complete. The minority, composed of the\r\nextreme Southern men, rejected the former plan and insisted\r\n\r\n1. "That the Democracy of the United States hold these cardinal\r\nprinciples on the subject of slavery in the territories: First, that\r\nCongress has no power to abolish slavery in the territories. Second,\r\nthat the territorial legislature has no power to abolish slavery in any\r\nterritory, nor to prohibit the introduction of slaves therein, nor any\r\npower to exclude slavery therefrom, nor any right to destroy or impair\r\nthe right of property in slaves by any legislation whatever."\r\n\r\n2. That the Federal government must protect slavery "on the high seas,\r\nin the territories, and wherever else its constitutional\r\nauthority extends."\r\n\r\nBoth majority and minority agreed in asserting\r\n\r\n1. That the Personal Liberty laws of the free states "are hostile in\r\ntheir character, subversive of the Constitution, and revolutionary in\r\ntheir effect."\r\n\r\n2. That Cuba ought to be acquired by the United States.\r\n\r\n3. That a railroad ought to be built to the Pacific.\r\n\r\nTheir agreement was a minor matter. Their disagreement was so serious\r\nthat when the minority could not have its way, it left the convention,\r\nmet in another hall, and adopted its resolutions.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the convention then adjourned to meet at Baltimore, June\r\n18. 1860. As it was then apparent that Douglas would be nominated,\r\nanother split occurred, and the few Southern men attending, together\r\nwith some Northern delegates, withdrew. Those who remained nominated\r\nStephen A. Douglas and Herschel V. Johnson.\r\n\r\nThe second group of seceders met in Baltimore, adopted the platform of\r\nthe first group of seceders from the Charleston convention, and\r\nnominated John C. Breckinridge, of Kentucky, and Joseph Lane, of Oregon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A Lincoln]\r\n\r\n%401. The Constitutional Union Party.%--Meanwhile (May 9) another\r\nparty, calling itself the National Constitutional Union party, met at\r\nBaltimore. These men were the remnants of the old Whig and American or\r\nKnow-nothing parties. They nominated John Bell, of Tennessee, and Edward\r\nEverett, of Massachusetts, and declared for "the Constitution of the\r\ncountry, the union of the states, and the enforcement of the laws."\r\n\r\n%402. Election of Lincoln.%--The Republican party met in convention\r\nat Chicago on May 16, and nominated Abraham Lincoln, and Hannibal Hamlin\r\nof Maine. It\r\n\r\n1. Repudiated the principles of the Dred Scott decision.\r\n\r\n2. Demanded the admission of Kansas as a free state.\r\n\r\n3. Denied all sympathy with any kind of interference with slavery in the\r\nstates.\r\n\r\n4. Insisted that the territories must be kept free.\r\n\r\n5. Called for a railroad to the Pacific, and a homestead law.\r\n\r\nThe election took place in November, 1860. Of 303 electoral votes cast,\r\nLincoln received 180; Breckinridge, 72; Bell, 39; and Douglas, 12.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\n1. The Compromise of 1850 did not settle the question of slavery in the\r\nterritories, and an attempt to organize Kansas and Nebraska brought\r\nit up again.\r\n\r\n2. In the organization of these territories a new political doctrine,\r\n"popular sovereignty," was announced.\r\n\r\n3. This was applied in Kansas, and the struggle for Kansas began. The\r\nfirst territorial government was proslavery. The antislavery men then\r\nmade a constitution (Topeka) and formed a free state government.\r\nThereupon the proslavery men formed a constitution (Lecompton) for a\r\nslave state. This was submitted to Congress and rejected, and Kansas\r\nremained a territory till 1861.\r\n\r\n4. In the course of the struggle for free soil in Kansas the Whig party\r\nwent to pieces, the Democratic was split into two wings, and the\r\nKnow-nothing or Native American party and the Republican party arose.\r\n\r\n5. The Republican party was defeated in 1856, but the Dred Scott\r\ndecision in 1857 and the continued struggle in Kansas forced the\r\nquestion of slavery to the front, and in 1860 Lincoln was elected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGRESS IN THE UNITED STATES BETWEEN 1840 AND 1860\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chicago in 1832]\r\n\r\n%403. The Movement of Population.%--The twenty years which elapsed\r\nbetween the election of Harrison, in 1840, and the election of Lincoln,\r\nin 1860, had seen a most astonishing change in our country. In 1840\r\nneither Texas, nor the immense region afterwards acquired from Mexico,\r\nbelonged to us. There were then but twenty-six states and five\r\nterritories, inhabited by 17,000,000 people, of whom but 876,000 lived\r\nwest of the Mississippi River, mostly close to the river bank in\r\nMissouri, Arkansas, and Louisiana. The great Northwest was still a\r\nwilderness, and many a city now familiar to us had no existence. Toledo\r\nand Milwaukee and Indianapolis had each less than 3000 inhabitants;\r\nChicago had less than 5000; and Cleveland, Columbus, and Detroit, each\r\nless than 10,000. Yet the rapid growth of cities had been one of the\r\ncharacteristics of the period 1830 to 1840.\r\n\r\nThe effect of new mechanical appliances on the movement of population\r\nwas amazing. The day when emigrants settled along the banks of streams,\r\npushed their boats up the rivers by means of poles, carried their goods\r\non the backs of pack horses, and floated their produce in Kentucky\r\nbroadhorns down the Ohio and Mississippi to New Orleans, was fast\r\ndisappearing. The steamboat, the canal, the railroad, had opened new\r\npossibilities. Land once valueless as too far from market suddenly\r\nbecame valuable. Men grew loath to live in a wilderness; the rush of\r\nemigrants across the Mississippi was checked. The region between the\r\nAlleghanies and the great river began to fill up rapidly. During the\r\ntwenty years, 1821 to 1841, but two states, Arkansas (1836) and Michigan\r\n(1837), were admitted to the Union, and but three new territories,\r\nFlorida (1822-23), Wisconsin (1836), and Iowa (1838), were established.\r\n\r\nSo few people went west from the Atlantic seaboard states that in each\r\none of them except Maine and Georgia population increased more rapidly\r\nthan it had ever done for forty years. From the Mississippi valley\r\nstates, however, numbers of people went to Wisconsin and Iowa.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this, Iowa was admitted to the Union in 1846, and\r\nWisconsin in 1848. Minnesota and Oregon were made territories. Florida\r\nand Texas had been admitted in 1845, and the number of states was thus\r\nraised to thirty before 1850. The population of the country in 1850 was\r\n23,000,000. Two states in the Mississippi valley now had each of them\r\nmore than a million of inhabitants.\r\n\r\n%404. The First States on the Pacific.%--Until 1840 the people had\r\nmoved westward steadily. Each state as it was settled had touched some\r\nother east, or north, or south of it. After 1840 people, attracted by\r\nthe rich farming land and pleasant climate of Oregon, and after 1848 by\r\nthe gold mines of California, rushed across the plains to the Pacific,\r\nand between 1850 and 1860 built up the states of California and Oregon\r\n(1859), and the territory of Washington (1853). Minnesota was admitted\r\nin 1858. The population of the United States in 1860 was 31,000,000.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: %DISTRIBUTION OF THE POPULATION OF THE UNITED STATES\r\nSEVENTH CENSUS, 1850%]\r\n\r\n%405. Immigration to the United States since 1820.%--The people whose\r\nmovements across our continent we have been following were chiefly\r\nnatives of the United States. But we have reached the time when\r\nforeigners began to arrive by hundreds of thousands every year. From the\r\nclose of the Revolution to 1820, it is thought not more than 250,000 of\r\nthe Old World people came to us. But the hard times in Europe, which\r\nfollowed the disbanding of the great armies which had been fighting\r\nFrance and Napoleon from 1789 to 1815, started a general movement.\r\nBeginning at 10,000, in 1820, more and more came every year till, in\r\n1842, 100,000 people--men, women, and children--landed on our shore.\r\nThis was the greatest number that had ever come in one year. But it was\r\nsurpassed in 1846, when the potato famine in Ireland, and again in 1853,\r\nwhen hard times in Germany, and another famine in Ireland, sent over two\r\nimmense streams of emigrants. In 1854 no less than 428,000 persons came\r\nfrom the Old World; more than ever came again in one year till 1872.\r\n\r\n%406. Modern Conveniences.%--When we compare the daily life of the\r\npeople in 1850 with that of the men of 1825, the contrast is most\r\nstriking. The cities had increased in number, grown in size, and greatly\r\nchanged in appearance. The older ones seemed less like villages. Their\r\nstreets were better paved and lighted. Omnibuses and street cars were\r\nbecoming common. The constable and the night watch had given way to the\r\npolice department. Gas and plumbing were in general use. The free school\r\nhad become an American institution, and many of the numberless\r\ninventions and discoveries which have done so much to increase our\r\nhappiness, prosperity, and comfort, existed at least in a rude form.\r\n\r\nBetween 1840 and 1850 nearly 7000 miles of railroad were built, making a\r\ntotal mileage of 9000. This rapid spread of the railroad, when joined\r\nwith the steamboats, then to be found on every river and lake within the\r\nsettled area, made possible an institution which to-day renders\r\ninvaluable service.\r\n\r\n%407. Express Companies.%--In 1839 a young man named W.F. Harnden\r\nbegan to carry packages, bundles, money, and small boxes between New\r\nYork and Boston, and thus started the express business. At first he\r\ncarried in a couple of carpet bags all the packages intrusted to him,\r\nand went by boat from New York to Stonington, Conn., and thence by rail\r\nto Boston. But his business grew so rapidly that in 1840 a rival express\r\nwas started by P. B. Burke and Alvin Adams. Their route was from Boston\r\nto Springfield, Mass., and thence to New York. This was the foundation\r\nof the present Adams Express Company. Both companies were so well\r\npatronized that in 1841 service was extended to Philadelphia and Albany,\r\nand in 1844 to Baltimore and Washington. Their example was quickly\r\nfollowed by a host of imitators, and soon a dozen express companies were\r\ndoing business between the great cities.\r\n\r\n%408. Postage Stamps introduced.%--At that time (1840) three cents\r\nwas the postage for a local letter which was not delivered by a carrier.\r\nIndeed, there were no letter carriers, and this in large cities was such\r\nan inconvenience that private dispatch companies undertook to deliver\r\nletters about the city for two cents each; and to accommodate their\r\ncustomers they issued adhesive stamps, which, placed on the letters,\r\ninsured their delivery. The loss of business to the government caused by\r\nthese companies, and the general demand for quicker and cheaper mail\r\nservice, forced Congress to revise the postal laws in 1845, when an\r\nattempt was made to introduce the use of postage stamps by the\r\ngovernment. As the mails (in consequence of the growth of the country\r\nand the easy means of transportation) were becoming very heavy, the\r\npostmasters in the cities and important towns had already begun to have\r\nstamps printed at their own cost. Their purpose was to save time, for\r\nletter postage was frequently (but not always) prepaid. But instead of\r\nfixing a stamp on the envelope (there was no such thing in 1840), the\r\nwriter sent the letter to the post office and paid the postage in money,\r\nwhereupon the postmaster stamped the letter "Paid." This consumed the\r\ntime of the postmaster and the letter writer. But when he could go once\r\nto the post office and prepay a hundred letters by buying a hundred\r\nstamps, any one of which affixed to a letter was evidence that its\r\npostage had been paid, any man who wanted to could save his time. These\r\nstamps the postmasters sold at a little more than the expense of\r\nprinting. Thus the postmasters of New York and St. Louis charged one\r\ndollar for nine ten-cent or eighteen five-cent stamps. This increased\r\nthe price of postage a trifle: but as the use of the stamps was\r\noptional, the burden fell on those willing to bear it, while the\r\nconvenience was so great that the effort made to have the Post-office\r\nDepartment furnish the stamps and require the people to use them\r\nsucceeded in 1847.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: St. Louis postage stamp]\r\n\r\n%409. Mechanical Improvements.%--No American need be told that his\r\nfellow-countrymen are the most ingenious people the world has ever\r\nknown. But we do not always remember that it was during this period\r\n(1840-1860) that the marvelous inventive genius of the people of the\r\nUnited States began to show itself. Between the day when the patent\r\noffice was established, in 1790, and 1840, the number of patents issued\r\nwas 11,908; but after 1840 the stream poured forth increased in volume\r\nnearly every year. In 1855 there were 2012 issued and reissued; in 1856,\r\n2506; in 1857, 2896; in 1858, 3695; and in 1860, 4778, raising the total\r\nnumber to 43,431. An examination of these inventions shows that they\r\nrelated to cotton gins and cotton presses; to reapers and mowers; to\r\nsteam engines; to railroads; to looms; to cooking stoves; to sewing\r\nmachines, printing presses, boot and shoe machines, rubber goods, floor\r\ncloths, and a hundred other things. Very many of them helped to increase\r\nthe comfort of man and raise the standard of living. Three of them,\r\nhowever, have revolutionized the industrial and business world and been\r\nof inestimable good to mankind. They are the sewing machine, the reaper\r\nand the electric telegraph.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The first Howe sewing machine]\r\n\r\n%410. The Sewing Machine.%--As far back as the year 1834, Walter Hunt\r\nmade and sold a few sewing machines in New York. But the man to whose\r\ngenius, perseverance, and unflinching zeal the world owes the sewing\r\nmachine, is Elias Howe. His patent was obtained in 1846, and he then\r\nspent four years in poverty and distress trying to convince the world of\r\nthe utility of his machine. By 1850 he succeeded not only in interesting\r\nthe public, but in so arousing the mechanical world that seven rivals\r\n(Wheeler and Wilson, Grover and Baker, Wilcox and Gibbs, and Singer)\r\nentered the field. To the combined efforts of them all, we owe one of\r\nthe most useful inventions of the century. It has lessened the cost of\r\nevery kind of clothing; of shoes and boots; of harness; of everything,\r\nin short, that can be sewed. It has given employment to millions of\r\npeople, and has greatly added to the comfort of every household in the\r\ncivilized world.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Wilson sewing machine of 1850]\r\n\r\n%411. The Harvester.%--Much the same can be said of the McCormick\r\nreaper. It was invented and patented as early as 1831; but it was hard\r\nwork to persuade the farmer to use it. Not a machine was sold till\r\n1841. During 1841, 1842, 1843, such as were made in the little\r\nblacksmith shop near Steel\'s Tavern, Virginia, were disposed of with\r\ndifficulty. Every effort to induce manufacturers to make the machine was\r\na failure. Not till McCormick had gone on horseback among the farmers of\r\nKentucky, Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, and secured written orders for\r\nhis reapers, did he persuade a firm in Cincinnati to make them. In 1845,\r\nfive hundred were manufactured; in 1850, three thousand. In 1851\r\nMcCormick placed one on exhibition at the World\'s Fair in London, and\r\nastonished the world with its performance. To-day two hundred thousand\r\nare turned out annually, and without them the great grain fields of the\r\nmiddle West and the far West would be impossible. The harvester has\r\ncheapened the cost of bread, and benefited the whole human race.\r\n\r\n%412. The Telegraph.%--Think, again, what would be our condition if\r\nevery telegraph line in the world were suddenly pulled down. Yet the\r\ntelegraph, like the reaper and the sewing machine, was introduced\r\nslowly. Samuel F. B. Morse got his patent in 1837; and for seven years,\r\nhelped by Alfred Vail, he struggled on against poverty. In 1842 he had\r\nbut thirty-seven cents in the world. But perseverance conquers all\r\nthings; and with thirty thousand dollars, granted by Congress, the first\r\ntelegraph line in the world was built in 1844 from Baltimore to\r\nWashington. In 1845 New York and Philadelphia were connected; but as\r\nwires could not be made to work under water, the messages were received\r\non the New Jersey side of the Hudson and carried to New York by boat. By\r\n1856 the telegraph was in use in the most populous states. Some forty\r\ncompanies, but one of which paid dividends, competed for the business.\r\nThis was ruinous; and in 1856 a union of Western companies was formed\r\nand called the Western Union Telegraph Company. To-day it has 21,000\r\noffices, sends each year some 58,000,000 messages, receives about\r\n$23,000,000, and does seven eighths of all the telegraph business in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n%413. India Rubber.%--The same year (1844) which witnessed the\r\nintroduction of the telegraph saw the perfection of Goodyear\'s secret\r\nfor the vulcanization of India rubber. In 1820 the first pair of rubber\r\nshoes ever seen in the United States were exhibited in Boston. Two years\r\nlater a ship from South America brought 500 pairs of rubber shoes. They\r\nwere thick, heavy, and ill-shaped; but they sold so rapidly that more\r\nwere imported, and in 1830 a cargo of raw gum was brought from South\r\nAmerica for the purpose of making rubber goods. With this C. M. Chaffee\r\nwent to work and succeeded in producing some pieces of cloth spread with\r\nrubber. Supposing the invention to be of great value, a number of\r\nfactories[1] began to make rubber coats, caps, wagon curtains, of pure\r\nrubber without cloth. But to the horror of the companies the goods\r\nmelted when hot weather came, and were sent back, emitting so dreadful\r\nan odor that they had to be buried. It was to overcome this and find\r\nsome means of hardening the gum that Goodyear began his experiments and\r\nlabored year after year against every sort of discouragement. Even when\r\nthe secret of vulcanizing, as it is called, was discovered, five years\r\npassed before he was able to conduct the process with absolute\r\ncertainty. In 1844, after ten years of labor, he succeeded and gave to\r\nthe world one of the most useful inventions of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: At Roxbury, Boston, Framingham, Salem, Lynn, Chelsea, Troy,\r\nand Staten Island.]\r\n\r\n%414. The Photograph; the Discovery of Anaesthesia.%--But there were\r\nother inventions and discoveries of almost as great or even greater\r\nvalue to mankind. In 1840 Dr. John W. Draper so perfected the\r\ndaguerreotype that it could be used to take pictures of persons and\r\nlandscapes. Till then it could be used only to make pictures of\r\nbuildings and statuary.\r\n\r\nThe year 1846 is made yet more memorable by the discovery that whoever\r\ninhaled sulphuric ether would become insensible to pain. The glory of\r\nthis discovery has been claimed for two men: Dr. Morton and Dr. Jackson.\r\nWhich one is entitled to it cannot be positively decided, though Dr.\r\nMorton seems to have the better right to be considered the discoverer.\r\nBefore this, however, anaesthesia by nitrous oxide (laughing gas) had\r\nbeen discovered by Dr. Wells of Hartford, Conn., and by Dr. Long\r\nof Georgia.\r\n\r\n%415. Communication with Europe; Steamships%.--Progress was not\r\nconfined to affairs within our boundary. Communications with Europe were\r\ngreatly advanced. The passage of the steamship _Savannah_ across the\r\nAtlantic, partly by steam and partly by sail, in 1819, resulted in\r\nnothing practical. The wood used for fuel left little space for freight.\r\nBut when better machinery reduced the time, and coal afforded a less\r\nbulky fuel, the passage across the Atlantic by steam became possible,\r\nand in 1838 two vessels, the _Sirius_ and the _Great Western_, made the\r\ntrip from Liverpool to New York by steam alone. No sails were used. This\r\nshowed what could be done, and in 1839 Samuel Cunard began the great\r\nfleet of Atlantic greyhounds by founding the Cunard Line. Aided by the\r\nBritish government, he drove all competitors from the field, till\r\nCongress came to the aid of the Collins Line, whose steamers made the\r\nfirst trip from New York to Liverpool in 1850. The rivalry between these\r\nlines was intense, and each did its best to make short voyages. In 1851\r\nthe average time from Liverpool to New York was eleven days, eight\r\nhours, for the Collins Line, and eleven days, twenty-three hours, for\r\nthe Cunard. This was considered astonishing; for Liverpool and New York\r\nwere thus brought as near each other in point of time in 1851 as Boston\r\nand Philadelphia were in 1790.\r\n\r\n%416. The Atlantic Cable%.--But something more astonishing yet was at\r\nhand. In 1854 Mr. Cyrus W. Field of New York was asked to aid in the\r\nconstruction of a submarine cable to join St. Johns with Cape Ray,\r\nNewfoundland. While considering the matter, he became convinced that if\r\na cable could be laid across the Gulf of St. Lawrence, another could be\r\nlaid across the Atlantic Ocean, and he formed the "New York,\r\nNewfoundland, and London Telegraph Company" for the purpose of doing\r\nso. The first attempt, made in 1857, and a second in 1858, ended in\r\nfailure; but a third, in 1858, was successful, and a cable was laid from\r\nValentia Bay in Ireland to Trinity Bay in Newfoundland, a distance of\r\n1700 geographical miles. For three weeks all went well, and during this\r\ntime 400 messages were sent; but on September 1, 1858, the cable ceased\r\nto work, and eight years passed before another attempt was made to join\r\nthe Old World and the New.\r\n\r\n%417. Condition of the Workingman%.--Every class of society was\r\nbenefited by these improvements, but no man more so than those who\r\ndepended on their daily wages for their daily bread. Though wages\r\nincreased but little, they were more easily earned and brought richer\r\nreturns. Improved means of transportation, cheaper methods of\r\nmanufacture, enabled every laborer in 1860 to wear better clothes and\r\neat better food than had been worn or consumed by his father in 1830.\r\nNew industries, new trades and occupations, new needs in the business\r\nworld, afforded to his son and daughter opportunities for a livelihood\r\nunknown in his youth, while the free school system enabled them to fit\r\nthemselves to use such opportunities without cost to him. When our\r\ncountry became independent, and for fifty years afterwards, a working\r\nday was from sunrise to sunset, with an hour for breakfast and another\r\nfor dinner. After manufactures arose, and mills and factories gave\r\nemployment to thousands of wage earners, fourteen, fifteen, and even\r\nsixteen hours of labor were counted a day. Protests were early made\r\nagainst this, and demands raised that a working day should be ten hours.\r\nAt last, late in the thirties, the ten hours system was adopted in\r\nBaltimore, and in 1840, by order of President Van Buren, was put in\r\nforce at the navy yard in Washington and in "all public establishments"\r\nunder the Federal government. Thus established, the system spread\r\nslowly, till to-day it exists almost everywhere. Indeed, in many states,\r\nand in all departments of the Federal government, eight hours of work\r\nconstitute a day. Thus, by the aid of machinery, not only are articles,\r\nformerly expensive, made so cheaply that poor men can afford to use\r\nthem, but the wage earners who operate the machinery can make these\r\narticles so quickly that they to-day earn higher wages for fewer hours\r\nof work than ever before in the history of the world. Not only did wages\r\nincrease and the hours of labor grow shorter between 1840 and 1860, but\r\nthe field of labor was enormously expanded. In 1810, when the first\r\ncensus of manufactures in the United States was taken, the value of\r\ngoods manufactured was $173,000,000. In 1860 it was ten times as great,\r\nand gave employment to more than 1,000,000 men and women.\r\n\r\n%418. Few Manufactures in the Slave States%.--From much of the\r\nbenefit produced by this splendid series of inventions and discoveries,\r\nthe people of the slave-owning states were shut out. They raised corn,\r\ntobacco, and cotton, and made some sugar; but in them there were very\r\nfew mills or manufacturing establishments of any sort. While a great\r\nsocial and industrial revolution was going on in the free states, the\r\npeople in the slave states remained in 1860 what they were in 1800. The\r\nstream of immigrants from Europe passed the slave states by, carrying\r\ntheir skill, their thrift, their energy, into the Northwest. The\r\nresources of the slave states were boundless, but no free man would go\r\nin to develop them. The soil was fertile, but no free laborer could live\r\non it and compete with slave labor, on which all agriculture, all\r\nindustry, all prosperity, in the South depended. The two sections of the\r\ncountry at the end of the period 1840-1860 were thus more unlike\r\nthan ever.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\n1. Between 1830 and 1850 the rush of population into the West continued,\r\nbut, instead of moving across the continent, most of the people settled\r\nin the states already in existence.\r\n\r\n2. This was due to the effect of such improved means of communication as\r\nsteamboats, railroads, canals, etc.\r\n\r\n3. As a consequence, but six new states were admitted to the Union in\r\ntwenty-nine years, and one of them was annexed (Texas).\r\n\r\n4. The period is also noticeable for the number of foreigners who came\r\nto our shores.\r\n\r\n5. After 1849 the existence of gold in California brought so many people\r\nto the Pacific coast that California became a state in 1850.\r\n\r\n6. As population grew denser, and transportation was facilitated by the\r\nexpansion of railroads and steamboats and canals, business opportunities\r\nwere increased, and new markets were created.\r\n\r\n7. Labor-saving and time-saving machines and appliances became more in\r\ndemand than ever, and a long list of remarkable inventions and business\r\naids appeared.\r\n\r\n8. The South, owing to its own peculiar industrial and labor condition,\r\nwas little benefited by all these improvements, and remained much the\r\nsame as in 1800.\r\n\r\nCONDITION OF THE COUNTRY, 1840-1860.\r\n\r\n_The People_.\r\n\r\nImmigration       Causes.\r\n                  Number of immigrants.\r\n\r\nNo. of people in  1840.  17,000,000\r\nU.

South Carolina secedes%.--The only state where in 1860\r\npresidential electors were chosen by the legislature was South Carolina.\r\nWhen the legislature met for this purpose, November 6, 1860, the\r\ngovernor asked it not to adjourn, but to remain in session till the\r\nresult of the election was known. If Lincoln is elected, said he, the\r\n"secession of South Carolina from the Union" will be necessary. Lincoln\r\nwas elected, and on December 20, 1860, a convention of delegates, called\r\nby the legislature to consider the question of secession, formally\r\ndeclared that South Carolina was no longer one of the United States.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: "We the people of the state of South Carolina, in\r\nconvention assembled, do declare and ordain ... that the union now\r\nsubsisting between South Carolina and other states, under the name of\r\nthe United States of America, is hereby dissolved."]\r\n\r\n%420. The "Confederate States of America."%--The meaning of this act\r\nof secession was that South Carolina now claimed to be a "sovereign,\r\nfree, and independent" nation. But she was not the only state to take\r\nthis step. By February 1, 1861, Mississippi, Florida, Alabama, Georgia,\r\nLouisiana, and Texas had also left the Union. Three days later, February\r\n4, 1861, delegates from six of these seven states met at Montgomery,\r\nAla., formed a constitution, established a provisional government, which\r\nthey called the "Confederate States of America," and elected Jefferson\r\nDavis and Alexander H. Stephens provisional President and Vice\r\nPresident.\r\n\r\nToward preventing or stopping this, Buchanan did nothing. No state, he\r\nsaid, had a right to secede. But a state having seceded, he had no power\r\nto make her come back, because he could not make war on a state; that\r\nis, he could not preserve the Union. On one matter, however, he was\r\nforced to act. When South Carolina seceded, the three forts in\r\nCharleston harbor--Castle Pinckney, Fort Sumter, and Fort Moultrie--were\r\nin charge of a major of artillery named Robert Anderson. He had under\r\nhim some eighty officers and men, and knowing that he could not hold all\r\nthree forts, and fearing that the South would seize Fort Sumter, he\r\ndismantled Fort Moultrie, spiked the cannon, cut down the flagstaff, and\r\nremoved to Fort Sumter, on the evening of December 26, 1860.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHARLESTON HARBOR]\r\n\r\nThis act was heartily approved by the people of the North and by\r\nCongress, and Buchanan with great reluctance yielded to their demand,\r\nand sent the _Star of the West,_ with food and men, to relieve Anderson.\r\nBut as the vessel, with our flag at its fore, was steaming up the\r\nchannel toward Charleston harbor, the Southern batteries fired upon her,\r\nand she went back to New York. Anderson was thus left to his fate, and\r\nas Buchanan\'s term was nearly out, both sides waited to see what\r\nLincoln would do.\r\n\r\n%421. Why did the States secede?%--Why did the Southern slave states\r\nsecede? To be fair to them we must seek the answer in the speeches of\r\ntheir leaders. "Your votes," said Jefferson Davis, "refuse to recognize\r\nour domestic institutions [slavery], which preexisted the formation of\r\nthe Union, our property [slaves], which was guaranteed by the\r\nConstitution. You refuse us that equality without which we should be\r\ndegraded if we remained in the Union. You elect a candidate upon the\r\nbasis of sectional hostility; one who in his speeches, now thrown\r\nbroadcast over the country, made a distinct declaration of war upon our\r\ninstitutions."\r\n\r\n"There is," said Howell Cobb, of Georgia, Secretary of the Treasury of\r\nthe United States, "no other remedy for the existing state of things\r\nexcept immediate secession."\r\n\r\n"Our position," said the Mississippi secession convention, "is\r\nthoroughly identified with the institution of slavery. A blow at slavery\r\nis a blow at commerce and civilization. There was no choice left us but\r\nsubmission to the mandates of abolition, or a dissolution of the Union."\r\n\r\nAlexander H. Stephens, the Vice President of the Confederacy, asserted\r\nthat the Personal Liberty laws of some of the free states "constitute\r\nthe only cause, in my opinion, which can justify secession."\r\n\r\nThe South seceded, then, according to its own statements, because the\r\npeople believed that the election of Lincoln meant the abolition\r\nof slavery.\r\n\r\n%422. Compromise attempted%.--The Republican party in 1861 had no\r\nintention of abolishing slavery. Its purpose was to stop the spread of\r\nslavery into the territories, to stop the admission of more slave\r\nstates, but not to abolish slavery in states where it already existed. A\r\nstrong wish therefore existed in the North to compromise the sectional\r\ndifferences. Many plans for a compromise were offered, but only one,\r\nthat of Crittenden, of Kentucky, need be mentioned. He proposed that the\r\nConstitution should be so amended as to provide\r\n\r\n1. That all territory of the United States north of 36\xc2\xb0 30\' should be\r\nfree, and all south of it slave soil.\r\n\r\n2. That slaves should be protected as property by all the departments of\r\nthe territorial government.\r\n\r\n3. That states should be admitted with or without slavery as their\r\nconstitutions provided, whether the states were north or south of\r\n36\xc2\xb0 30\'.\r\n\r\n4. That Congress should have no power to shut slavery out of the\r\nterritories.\r\n\r\n5. That the United States should pay owners for rescued fugitive slaves.\r\n\r\nAs these propositions recognized the right of property in slaves, that\r\nis, put the black man on a level with horses and cattle, the Republicans\r\nrejected them, and the attempt to compromise ended in failure.\r\n\r\n%423. A Proposed Thirteenth Amendment%.--One act of great\r\nsignificance was done. A proposition to add a thirteenth amendment to\r\nthe Constitution was submitted to the states. It read,\r\n\r\n"No amendment shall be made to the Constitution which will authorize or\r\ngive to Congress the power to abolish or interfere within any state with\r\nthe domestic institutions thereof, including that of persons held to\r\nlabor or service by the laws of said states."\r\n\r\nEven Lincoln approved of this, and two states, Maryland and Ohio,\r\naccepted it. But the issue was at hand. It was too late to compromise.\r\n\r\n%424. Abraham Lincoln, Sixteenth President%.--Lincoln and Hamlin were\r\ninaugurated on March 4, 1861, and in his speech from the Capitol steps\r\nLincoln was very careful to state just what he wanted to do.\r\n\r\n1. "I have no purpose," said he, "directly or indirectly, to interfere\r\nwith the institution of slavery in the states where it exists."\r\n\r\n2. "I consider the Union is unbroken, and to the extent of my ability I\r\nshall take care ... that the laws of the Union be faithfully executed in\r\nall the states."\r\n\r\n3. "In doing this there need be no bloodshed or violence; and there\r\nshall be none, unless it be forced upon the national authority."\r\n\r\n4. "The power confided in me will be used to hold, occupy, and possess\r\nthe property and places belonging to the government and to collect the\r\nduties and imposts."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fort Sumter]\r\n\r\n%425. Civil War begins.%--One of the places Lincoln thus pledged\r\nhimself to "hold" was Fort Sumter, to which he decided to send men and\r\nsupplies. As soon as notice of this intention was sent to Governor\r\nPickens of South Carolina, the Confederate commander at Charleston,\r\nGeneral Beauregard (bo-ruh-gar\'), demanded the surrender of the fort.\r\nMajor Anderson stoutly refused to comply with the demand, and at dawn on\r\nthe morning of April 12, 1861, the Confederates fired the first gun at\r\nSumter. During the next thirty-four hours, nineteen batteries poured\r\nshot and shell into the fort, which steadily returned the fire. Then\r\nboth food and powder were nearly exhausted, and part of the fort being\r\non fire, Anderson surrendered; and on Sunday, April 14, 1861, he marched\r\nout, taking with him the tattered flag under which he made so gallant a\r\nfight.[1] The fleet sent to his aid arrived in time to see the battle,\r\nbut did not give him any help. After the surrender, one of the ships\r\ncarried Anderson and the garrison to New York.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: "Having defended Fort Sumter for thirty-four hours, until\r\nthe quarters were entirely burned, the main gates destroyed by fire, the\r\ngorge walls seriously injured, the magazine surrounded by flames, and\r\nits door closed from the effect of heat, four barrels and three\r\ncartridges of powder being available, and no provisions remaining but\r\npork, I accepted terms of evacuation offered by General Beauregard . . .\r\nand marched out of the fort on Sunday afternoon, the 14th instant, with\r\ncolors flying and drums beating . . . and saluting my flag with fifty\r\nguns."--_Major Anderson to the Secretary of War._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Battles and Leaders of the Civil War,_ Vol. I., pp.\r\n60-73.]\r\n\r\n%426. The Life of the Republic at Stake%.--Thus was begun the\r\ngreatest war in modern history. It was no vulgar struggle for territory,\r\nor for maritime or military supremacy. The life of the Union was at\r\nstake. The questions to be decided were: Shall there be one or two\r\nrepublics on the soil of the United States? Shall the great principle of\r\nall democratic-republican government, the principle that the will of the\r\nmajority shall rule, be maintained or abandoned? Shall state sovereignty\r\nbe recognized? Shall states be suffered to leave the Union at will, or\r\nshall the United States continue to exist as "an indestructible Union of\r\nindestructible States"? As Mr. Lincoln said, "Both parties deprecated\r\nwar; but one of them would make war rather than let the nation survive;\r\nand the other would accept war rather than let it perish."\r\n\r\n%427. The South better prepared%.--For the struggle which was to\r\ndecide these questions neither side was ready, but the South was better\r\nprepared than the North. The South was united as one man. The North was\r\ndivided and full of Southern sympathizers. She knew not whom to trust.\r\nOfficers of the army, officers of the navy, were resigning every day.\r\nThe great departments of government at Washington contained many men who\r\nfurnished information to Southern officials. Seventeen steam war vessels\r\n(two thirds of all that were not laid up or unfit for service) were in\r\nforeign parts. Large quantities of military supplies had been stored in\r\nSouthern forts. All the great powers of Europe save Russia were hostile\r\nto our republic, and would gladly have seen it rent in twain. The South,\r\nagain, had the advantage in that she was to act on the defensive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The United States July 1861 Showing the greatest\r\nextension of the Southern Confederacy]\r\n\r\n%428. Results of firing on the Flag.%--Not a man was killed on either\r\nside during the bombardment of Sumter. Yet the battle was a famous one,\r\nand led to greater consequences:\r\n\r\n1. Lincoln at once called for 75,000 militia to serve for three months.\r\n\r\n2. Four "border states," as they were called, thus forced to choose\r\ntheir side, seceded. They were Arkansas, North Carolina, Virginia, and\r\nTennessee.\r\n\r\n3. The Congress of the United States was called to meet at Washington,\r\nJuly 4, 1861.\r\n\r\n4. After Virginia seceded, the capital of the Confederacy, at the\r\ninvitation of the Virginia secession convention, was moved from\r\nMontgomery to Richmond, and the Confederate Congress adjourned to meet\r\nthere July 20, 1861.\r\n\r\n%429. West Virginia.%--The act of secession by Virginia was promptly\r\nrepudiated by the people of the counties west of the mountains, who\r\nrefused to secede, and voted to form a new state under the name of\r\nKanawha. They adopted a constitution and were finally admitted in 1863\r\nas the state of West Virginia[1].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A state made out of part of another state cannot be\r\nadmitted into the Union without the consent of that state first\r\nobtained. But as Congress and the people of West Virginia considered\r\nthat Virginia consisted of that part of the Old Dominion which remained\r\nloyal to the Union, the people practically asked their own consent.]\r\n\r\n%430. The Call to Arms.%--Lincoln held that no state could ever leave\r\nthe Union, and that therefore no state had left the Union. Those which\r\nhad passed ordinances of secession were to his mind states whose\r\nmachinery of government had been seized on by persons in insurrection\r\nagainst the government of the United States. When, therefore, he made\r\nhis call for 75,000 militia to defend the Union, he apportioned the\r\nnumber among all the states, slave and free, north and south, east and\r\nwest, according to their population. Those forming the Confederacy paid\r\nno attention to the call. The governors of the border slave states\r\n(Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri) returned\r\nevasive or insulting answers.\r\n\r\nBut the people of the loyal states responded instantly, and tens of\r\nthousands of troops were soon on their way to Washington. To get there\r\nwas a hard matter. Baltimore lay on the most direct railroad route\r\nbetween the Eastern and Middle States and Washington. But Baltimore was\r\nfull of disloyal men, who tore up the railroads, burned bridges, cut the\r\ntelegraph wires, and as the Massachusetts 6th regiment was passing\r\nthrough the city from one railroad station to another, attacked it,\r\nkilling some and wounding others of its soldiers. This forced the troops\r\nfrom the other states to go by various routes to Annapolis and then to\r\nWashington, so that it was late in April before enough arrived to insure\r\nthe safety of the city.\r\n\r\nThough none of the border and seceded states sent troops, the response\r\nof the loyal states to Lincoln\'s call was so hearty that more than\r\n75,000 men were furnished. The President decided to turn this outburst\r\nof patriotism to good purpose, and May 3, 1861, asked for 42,034\r\nvolunteers for three years unless sooner discharged, and ordered 18,000\r\nseamen to be enlisted, and 22,714 men added to the regular army.\r\nBaltimore was now occupied by Union troops, and communication with\r\nWashington through that city was restored and protected.\r\n\r\nOn July 1, 1861, there were 183,588 "boys in blue" under arms and\r\npresent for duty. These were distributed at various places north of the\r\nline, 2000 miles long, which divided the North and South. This line\r\nbegan near Fort Monroe, in Virginia, ran up Chesapeake Bay and the\r\nPotomac to the mountains, then across Western Virginia and through\r\nKentucky, Missouri, and Indian Territory to New Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis line was naturally divided into three parts:\r\n\r\n1. That in Virginia and along the Potomac.\r\n\r\n2. That occupied by Kentucky, a state which had declared itself neutral.\r\n\r\n3. That west of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\n%431. The Battle of "Bull Run" or Manassas%.--General Winfield Scott\r\nwas in command of the Union army. Under him, in command of the troops\r\nabout Washington, was General Irwin McDowell. Further to the west, near\r\nHarpers Ferry, was a Union force under General Patterson. In western\r\nVirginia, with an army raised largely in Ohio, was General George B.\r\nMcClellan. In Missouri was General Lyon, aided by all the Union people\r\nin the state, who were engaged in a desperate struggle to keep her in\r\nthe Union.\r\n\r\nIn northern Virginia and opposed to the Union forces under General\r\nMcDowell, was a Confederate army under General Beauregard, and these\r\ntroops the people of the North demanded should be attacked. "The\r\nConfederate Congress must not meet at Richmond!" "On to Richmond! On to\r\nRichmond!" became the cries of the hour. General McDowell, with 30,000\r\nmen, was therefore ordered to attack Beauregard. McDowell found him near\r\nManassas, some thirty miles southwest of Washington, and there, on the\r\nfield of "Bull Run," on Sunday, July 21, 1861, was fought a famous\r\nbattle which ended with the defeat and flight of the Union army[1].\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Battles and Leaders of the Civil War_, Vol. I., pp.\r\n229-239.]\r\n\r\nGeneral George B. McClellan, who had defeated the Confederate forces in\r\nwestern Virginia in several battles, was now placed in command of the\r\ntroops near Washington, and spent the rest of 1861 and part of 1862 in\r\ndrilling and organizing his army. Bull Run had taught the people two\r\nthings: 1. That the war was not to end in three months; 2. That an army\r\nwithout discipline is not much better than a mob.\r\n\r\n%432. Fort Donelson and Fort Henry%.--While McClellan was drilling\r\nhis men along the Potomac, the Union forces drove back the Confederates\r\nin the West. The Confederate line at first extended as shown by the\r\nheavy line on the map on p. 390. In order to break it, General Buell\r\nsent a small force under General Thomas, in January, 1862, to drive back\r\nthe Confederates near Mill Springs. Next, in February, General Halleck\r\nauthorized General U. S. Grant and Flag Officer Foote to make a joint\r\nexpedition against Fort Henry on the Tennessee. But Foote arrived first\r\nand captured the fort, whereupon Grant marched to Fort Donelson on the\r\nCumberland, eleven miles away, and after three days of sharp fighting\r\nwas asked by General Buckner what terms he would offer. Grant\r\npromptly answered,\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Handwritten note of Grant]\r\n\r\nNo terms excepting unconditional and\r\nimmediate surrender can be accepted.\r\nI propose to receive immediately upon\r\nyour word.\r\n           I am Sir: very respectfully\r\n                   your ** **\r\n                      U. S. Grant\r\n                        Brig. Gen.\r\n\r\nBuckner at once surrendered (February 16, 1862), and Grant won the first\r\ngreat Union victory of the war.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Battles and Leaders of the Civil War,_ Vol. I., pp.\r\n398-429; Grant\'s _Memoirs_, Vol. I., pp. 285-315.]\r\n\r\n%433. The Battle of Shiloh, or Pittsburg Landing.%--After the fall of\r\nFort Donelson, the Confederates, abandoning Columbus and Nashville,\r\nhurried south toward Corinth in Mississippi, whither Halleck\'s army\r\nfollowed in three parts. One under General S. E. Curtis moved to\r\nsouthwestern Missouri, and beat the Confederates at Pea Ridge, Ark.\r\n(March 6-8). The second, under General John Pope, co\xc3\xb6perated with Flag\r\nOfficer Foote, from the west bank of the Mississippi, in the capture of\r\nIsland No. 10 (April 7). Pope then joined Halleck in the movement\r\nagainst Corinth, while the fleet went on down the river, attacked Fort\r\nPillow three times, captured it (June 4), and two days later\r\ntook Memphis.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the third part of Halleck\'s army, under Grant, following the\r\nConfederates, had reached Pittsburg Landing, where (April 6) he was\r\nsuddenly attacked by General A. S. Johnston and driven back. But General\r\nBuell coming up with fresh troops, the battle was resumed the next day\r\n(April 7), when Grant regained his lost ground, and the Confederates\r\nfell back to Corinth.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Battles and Leaders of the Civil War,_ Vol., pp. 465-486.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Driving back the Confederate line in the West]\r\n\r\nAt this point General Henry Halleck arrived and took command, and at the\r\nend of May occupied Corinth. Memphis then fell, and the Mississippi\r\nRiver was opened as far south as Vicksburg. After the capture of\r\nMemphis, Halleck went to Washington to take command of the armies of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n%434. Bragg\'s Raid into Kentucky.%--The Confederate line which in\r\nJanuary, 1862, had passed across Kentucky had thus by June been driven\r\nsouthward to Chattanooga, Iuka, and Holly Springs. The Union line ran\r\nfrom near Chattanooga to Corinth and Memphis. Against this the\r\nConfederates now moved, with the hope of breaking through and driving it\r\nback. Gathering his forces at Chattanooga, General Bragg rushed across\r\nTennessee and Kentucky toward Louisville. But General Buell, perceiving\r\nhis purpose, outmarched him, reached the Ohio, and forced Bragg to fall\r\nback. At Perryville (October 8, 1862), Bragg turned furiously on Buell\r\nand was beaten.\r\n\r\n%435. Iuka and Corinth.%--While Bragg was raiding Kentucky, Generals\r\nPrice at Iuka and Van Dorn at Holly Springs, knowing that Grant\'s army\r\nhad been greatly weakened by sending troops to Buell, prepared to attack\r\nCorinth. But Grant, thinking he could fight them separately, sent\r\nRosecrans to Iuka (September 19). Price was not captured, but retreated\r\nto Van Dorn, and the two then fell upon Rosecrans at Corinth (October\r\n4), only to be beaten and chased forty miles.\r\n\r\n%436. Murfreesboro.%--For these successes Rosecrans (October 30) was\r\ngiven command of Buell\'s army, then centering at Nashville. Bragg went\r\ninto winter quarters at Murfreesboro, and thither Rosecrans advanced to\r\nattack him. The contest at Murfreesboro (December 31, 1862, and January\r\n2, 1863) was one of the most bloody battles of the whole war. Bragg was\r\nagain defeated, and retreated to a position farther south.\r\n\r\n%437. Arkansas%.--In January, 1862, the Confederate line west of the\r\nMississippi extended from Belmont across southern Missouri to the Indian\r\nTerritory. Against the west end of this line General Curtis moved in\r\nFebruary, 1862, and after driving the Confederates under Van Dorn and\r\nPrice out of Missouri, beat them in the desperate battle at Pea Ridge,\r\nArkansas (March 6-8, 1862), and moved to the interior of the state.\r\nPrice and Van Dorn went east into Mississippi (see \xc2\xa7 435), and when the\r\nyear closed the Union forces were in control north of the Arkansas\r\nRiver, and along the west bank of the Mississippi. On the east bank the\r\nonly fortified positions in Confederate hands were Vicksburg, Grand\r\nGulf, and Port Hudson.\r\n\r\n%438. Farragut captures New Orleans.%--While Foote was opening the\r\nupper part of the Mississippi, a naval expedition under Farragut,\r\nsupported by an army under Butler, had cleared the lower part of the\r\nriver. These forces had been sent by sea to capture New Orleans. The\r\ndefenses of the city consisted of two strong forts almost directly\r\nopposite each other on the banks of the river, about seventy-five miles\r\nsouth of the city; of two great chain cables stretched across the river\r\nbelow the forts to prevent ships coming up; and of fifteen armed vessels\r\nabove the forts. New Orleans was thought to be safe. But Farragut was\r\nnot dismayed. Sailing up the river till he came to the chains, he\r\nbombarded the forts for six days and nights, while the forts did their\r\nbest to destroy him. Then, finding he could do nothing in this way, he\r\ncut the chains, ran his ships past the forts in spite of a dreadful fire\r\n(April 24, 1862), destroyed the Confederate fleet (April 25), and took\r\nthe city. General Butler, who had been waiting at Ship Island with\r\n15,000 men, then entered and held New Orleans.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Farragut, after taking New Orleans, went up the river and\r\ncaptured Baton Rouge and Natchez.]\r\n\r\n%439. The Peninsular Campaign against Richmond.%--The signal success\r\nof Grant and Farragut in the West was more than offset by the signal\r\nfailure of McClellan in the East. The wish of the administration, and\r\nindeed of the whole North, was that Richmond should be captured. Against\r\nit, therefore, the Army of the Potomac was to move. But by what route?\r\nThe government wanted McClellan to march south across Virginia, so that\r\nhis army should always be between the Confederate forces and Washington.\r\nMcClellan insisted on moving west from Chesapeake Bay. The result was a\r\ncompromise:\r\n\r\n1. Forces under Fr\xc3\xa9mont and Banks were to operate in the Shenandoah\r\nvalley and prevent a Confederate force attacking Washington from\r\nthe west.\r\n\r\n2. An army under McDowell was to march from Fredericksburg to Richmond.\r\n\r\n3. McClellan was to take the main army from Washington by water to Fort\r\nMonroe, and then march up the peninsula to Richmond, where McDowell was\r\nto join him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Peninsula Campaign]\r\n\r\nThis peninsula, from which the campaign gets its name, lies between the\r\nYork and James rivers. Landing at the lower end of it, McClellan was met\r\nby General Joseph E. Johnston, who caused a long delay by forcing him to\r\nbesiege Yorktown. McClellan then advanced up the peninsula, fighting the\r\nbattle of Williamsburg on the way. At White House Landing he turned\r\ntoward Richmond, extending his right flank to Hanover Courthouse, where\r\nMcDowell was expected to join him. But this was not to be, for General\r\nT. J. Jackson ("Stonewall" Jackson) rushed down the Shenandoah valley,\r\ndriving Banks over the Potomac into Maryland, and retreated south before\r\nFr\xc3\xa9mont or McDowell could cut him off; during this campaign he won four\r\ndesperate battles in thirty-five days. Jackson\'s success alarmed\r\nWashington, and McDowell was held in northern Virginia. McClellan\'s\r\narmy, meanwhile, advanced on both sides of the Chickahominy River to\r\nwithin eight miles of Richmond. At Fair Oaks and Seven Pines (May 31)\r\nhis left flank was almost overwhelmed by Johnston; but the latter was\r\nwounded and his troops defeated. Johnston was then succeeded by R. E.\r\nLee, who, joined by Jackson, attacked McClellan at Mechanicsville and\r\nGames Mill, and forced him to fall back, fighting for six days (June 26\r\nto July 1, 1862)[1] as he retreated to Harrisons Landing, on the James\r\nRiver. There the army remained till August, when it was recalled to\r\nthe Potomac.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The "Seven Days\' Battles" are these and one fought June\r\n25.]\r\n\r\n%440. Lee\'s Raid into Maryland; Battle of Antietam, or\r\nSharpsburg.%--While the Army of the Potomac was at Harrisons Landing,\r\na new force called the Army of Virginia was organized, and General John\r\nPope placed in command. At the same time General Halleck was recalled\r\nfrom the West and made general in chief of the Union armies. Pope\r\nintended to move straight against Richmond. But when McClellan in\r\nobedience to orders left Harrisons Landing and took his army by water to\r\nthe Potomac, near Washington, the Confederate army was left free to act\r\nas it pleased. Seeing his opportunity, Lee moved at once against Pope\'s\r\narmy, whose line stretched along the Rappahannock and Rapidan rivers to\r\nthe Shenandoah valley in western Virginia. Near the Rapidan at Cedar\r\nMountain was General Banks. He was first attacked and beaten; after\r\nwhich Lee fell upon Pope on the old field of Bull Run, and put the army\r\nto flight. Pope fell back to Washington, where his forces were united\r\nwith those of McClellan. Pushing northward, Lee next crossed the Potomac\r\nand entered Maryland. But he was overtaken by McClellan at Antietam\r\nCreek, near Sharpsburg, where, September 17, 1862, a great battle was\r\nfought, after which Lee went back to Virginia.\r\n\r\nMcClellan was now removed and the command of the army given to General\r\nBurnside. He was as reckless as McClellan was cautious, and on December\r\n13 threw his army against the Confederates posted at Fredericksburg\r\nHeights and was beaten with dreadful slaughter. Thus at the end of 1862\r\nRichmond was not captured, and the two armies went into winter quarters\r\nwith the Rappahannock River between them.\r\n\r\n%441. Emancipation of the Slaves%.--More than two years had now\r\npassed since South Carolina had seceded, and during this time a great\r\nchange had taken place in the feeling of the North towards slavery. When\r\nLincoln was inaugurated, very few people wanted the slaves emancipated.\r\nBut two years of bloody fighting had convinced the North that the Union\r\ncould not exist part slave, part free. As Lincoln said in his speech at\r\nSpringfield in 1858, "It must be all one thing, or all the other."\r\nSeeing that the people now felt as he did, Lincoln, in 1862 (March 6),\r\nasked Congress to agree to buy the slaves of the loyal slave states, and\r\nurged the members of Congress from those states to advise their\r\nconstituents to set free their slaves and receive $300 apiece for them.\r\nThis they would not do; whereupon he decided to act upon his own\r\nauthority, and declared all slaves within the lines of the Confederacy\r\nto be freemen.\r\n\r\nFor this he had two good reasons: 1. So far the war had been one for the\r\npreservation of the Union. By making it a war for union and freedom the\r\nNorth would become more earnest than ever. 2. The rulers of England, who\r\nwanted Southern cotton, were only waiting for a pretext to acknowledge\r\nthe independence of the South. If, however, the North engaged in a war\r\nfor the abolition of slavery, the people of England would not allow the\r\nindependence of the Confederacy to be acknowledged by their rulers.\r\n\r\nThe time to make such a declaration was after some victory gained by the\r\nUnion army. When McClellan and Lee stood face to face at Antietam,\r\nLincoln therefore "vowed to God" that if Lee were defeated he would\r\nissue the proclamation. Lee was defeated, and, on September 22, 1862,\r\nthe proclamation came forth declaring that if the Confederate States did\r\nnot return to their allegiance before January 1, 1863, "all persons held\r\nas slaves" within the Confederate lines "shall be then, thenceforth, and\r\nforever free." The states of course did not return to their allegiance,\r\nand on January 1, 1863, a second proclamation was issued setting the\r\nslaves free.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Nicolay and Hay\'s _Life of Lincoln, _Vol. VI., Chaps. 6,\r\n8.]\r\n\r\nNow, there are three things in connection with the Emancipation\r\nProclamation which must be understood and remembered:\r\n\r\n1. Lincoln did not _abolish slavery_ anywhere. He _emancipated_ or _set\r\nfree the slaves_ of certain persons engaged in waging war against the\r\nUnited States government.\r\n\r\n2. The Emancipation Proclamation did not apply to any of the loyal slave\r\nstates,[1] nor to such territory as the Union army had reconquered.[2]\r\nIn none of these places did it free slaves.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Delaware, Maryland, West Virginia, Kentucky, and Missouri.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: Tennessee, thirteen parishes in Louisiana, and seven\r\ncounties in Virginia.]\r\n\r\n3. Lincoln freed the slaves by virtue of his power as commander in chief\r\nof the army of the United States, "and as a fit and necessary\r\nwar measure."\r\n\r\n%442. The Battle of Gettysburg.%--After Burnside was defeated at\r\nFredericksburg, in December, 1862, he was removed, and General Hooker\r\nput in command of the Army of the Potomac. Hooker--"Fighting Joe," as he\r\nwas called--led it against Lee, and (May 1-4, 1863) was beaten at\r\nChancellorsville and fell back. In June Lee again took the offensive,\r\nrushed down the Shenandoah valley to the Potomac, crossed Maryland, and\r\nentered Pennsylvania, with the Army of the Potomac in pursuit. On\r\nreaching Maryland, Hooker was removed and General Meade put in command.\r\nThe opposing forces met on the hills at Gettysburg, Penn., and there,\r\nJuly 1-3, Lee attacked Meade. The contest was a dreadful one; no field\r\nwas ever more stubbornly fought over. About one fourth of the men\r\nengaged were killed or wounded. But the splendid courage of the Union\r\narmy prevailed: Lee was beaten and retired to Virginia, where he\r\nremained unmolested till the spring of 1864. Gettysburg is regarded as\r\nthe greatest battle of the war, and the Union regiments engaged have\r\ntaken a just pride in marking the positions they held during the three\r\nawful days of slaughter, till the field is dotted all over with\r\nbeautiful monuments. On the hill back of the village is a great\r\nnational cemetery, at the dedication of which Lincoln delivered his\r\nfamous Gettysburg address.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Part of the battlefield of Gettysburg]\r\n\r\n%443. Vicksburg%.--The day after the victory at Gettysburg, the joy\r\nof the North was yet more increased by the news that Vicksburg had\r\nsurrendered (July 4) to Grant. After the defeat, of the Confederate\r\nforces at Iuka and Corinth in 1862, the Confederate line passed across\r\nnorthern Mississippi, touched the river from Vicksburg to Port Hudson,\r\nand then swept off to the Gulf. As the capture of these river towns\r\nwould complete the opening of the Mississippi, Grant set out to take\r\nVicksburg. Failing in a direct advance through Mississippi, Grant sent a\r\nstrong force down the river from Memphis, and later took command in\r\nperson. Vicksburg stands on the top of a bluff which rises steep and\r\nstraight 200 feet above the river, and had been so fortified that to\r\ncapture it seemed impossible. But Grant was determined to open the\r\nriver. On the west bank, he cut a canal through a bend, hoping to divert\r\nthe river and get water passage by the town. This failed, and he decided\r\nto cross below the town and attack from the land. To aid him in this\r\nattempt, Porter ran his gunboats past the town one night in April and\r\ncarried the army over the river. Landing on the east bank, Grant won a\r\nvictory at Port Gibson, and occupied Grand Gulf. Hearing that Johnston\r\nwas coming to help Pemberton, Grant pushed in between them, beat\r\nJohnston at Jackson, and turning westward, drove Pemberton into\r\nVicksburg, and began a regular siege. For seven weeks he poured in shot\r\nand shell day and night. To live in houses became impossible, and the\r\nwomen and children took refuge in caves. Food gave out, and after every\r\nkind of misery had been endured till it could be borne no longer,\r\nVicksburg was surrendered on July 4.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Vicksburg Campaign]\r\n\r\nFive days later (July 9, 1863), Port Hudson surrendered, and the\r\nMississippi, as Lincoln said, "flowed unvexed to the sea." It was open\r\nfrom its source to its mouth, and the Confederacy was cut in two.\r\n\r\n%444. Driving the Confederates eastward; Chickamauga and\r\nChattanooga%.--While Grant was besieging Vicksburg, Rosecrans by\r\nskillful work forced Bragg to retreat from his position south of\r\nMurfreesboro; then in a second campaign he forced Bragg to leave\r\nChattanooga and retire into northwestern Georgia. Bragg here received\r\nmore troops, and attacked Rosecrans in the Chickamauga valley (September\r\n19 and 20, 1863), where was fought one of the most desperate battles of\r\nthe war. So fierce was the onset of the Confederates that the Union\r\nright wing was driven from the field. But the left wing, under General\r\nGeorge H. Thomas, a grand character and a splendid officer, by some of\r\nthe best fighting ever seen held the enemy in check and saved the army\r\nfrom rout. By his firmness Thomas won the name of "the Rock of\r\nChickamauga."\r\n\r\nRosecrans now went back to Chattanooga. Bragg followed, and taking\r\nposition on the hills and mountains which surround the town on the east\r\nand south, shut in the Union army and besieged it. For a time it seemed\r\nin danger of starvation. But Hooker was sent from Virginia with more\r\ntroops; the Army of the Tennessee under Sherman was summoned from\r\nVicksburg; Rosecrans was superseded by Thomas, and Grant was put in\r\ncommand of all. Then matters changed. The forces under Thomas, moving\r\nfrom their lines, seized some low hills at the foot of Missionary Ridge,\r\neast of Chattanooga (November 23). On the 24th, Hooker carried the\r\nConfederate works on Lookout Mountain, southwest of the city, in a\r\nconflict often called the "Battle above the Clouds"; and Sherman was\r\nsent against the northern end of Missionary Ridge, but succeeded only in\r\ntaking an outlying hill. On the 25th Sherman renewed his attack, but\r\nfailed to gain the main crest, whereupon Thomas attacked the Ridge in\r\nfront of Chattanooga, carried the heights, and drove off the enemy.\r\nBragg retreated to Dalton, in northwestern Georgia, where the command of\r\nhis army was given to Joseph E. Johnston.\r\n\r\n%445. "Marching through Georgia"; "From Atlanta to the Sea."%--As the\r\nConfederates had thus been driven from the Mississippi River, and forced\r\nback to the mountains, they had but two centers of power left. The one\r\nwas the army under Lee, which, since the defeat at Gettysburg, had been\r\nlying quietly behind the Rapidan and Rappahannock rivers, protecting\r\nRichmond. The other was the army at Dalton, Ga., now under J.\r\nE. Johnston.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WAR FOR THE UNION Breaking the Confederate Line]\r\n\r\nEarly in the spring of 1864 General U.S. Grant--"Unconditional Surrender\r\nGrant," as the people called him--was made lieutenant general (a rank\r\nnever before given to any United States soldier except Washington and\r\nScott), and put in command of all the Federal armies. General Sherman\r\nwas left in command of the military division of the Mississippi.\r\n\r\nBefore beginning the campaign, Grant and Sherman agreed on a plan.\r\nGrant, with the Army of the Potomac, was to drive back Lee and take\r\nRichmond. Sherman, with the armies of Thomas, McPherson, and Schofield,\r\nwas to attack Johnston and push his way into Georgia. Each was to begin\r\nhis movement on the same day (May 4, 1864).\r\n\r\nOn that day, accordingly, Sherman with 98,000 men marched against\r\nJohnston, flanked him out of Dalton, and step by step through the\r\nmountains to Atlanta, fighting all the way. Johnston\'s retreat was\r\nmasterly. He intended to retreat until Sherman\'s army was so weakened by\r\nleaving guards in the rear to protect the railroads, over which food and\r\nsupplies must come, that he could fight on equal terms. But Jefferson\r\nDavis removed Johnston at Atlanta, and put J. B. Hood in command.\r\n\r\nHood, in July, made three furious attacks, was beaten each time;\r\nabandoned Atlanta in September, and soon after started northwestward, in\r\nhope of drawing Sherman out of Georgia. But Sherman sent Thomas and a\r\npart of the army to Tennessee, and after following Hood for a time, he\r\nreturned to Atlanta, tearing up the railroads as he went. Then, having\r\npartly burned the town, in November he started for the sea with 60,000\r\nof his best veterans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SHERMAN\'S MARCH TO THE SEA]\r\n\r\nThe troops went in four columns, covering a belt of sixty miles wide,\r\nburning bridges, tearing up railroads, living on the country as they\r\nmarched. Early in December the army drew near to Savannah; about the\r\nmiddle of the month (December 13) Fort McAllister was taken; and a few\r\ndays later the city of Savannah was occupied. During all this long march\r\nto the sea, nothing was known in the North as to where Sherman was or\r\nwhat he was doing. Fancy the delight of Lincoln, then, when on the\r\nChristmas eve of 1864, he received this telegram:\r\n\r\n                      SAVANNAH, Georgia, December 22, 1864.\r\n\r\nTo His EXCELLENCY, PRESIDENT LINCOLN, WASHINGTON, D.C.\r\n\r\nI beg to present you as a Christmas gift the city of Savannah, with one\r\nhundred and fifty heavy guns and plenty of ammunition; also about\r\ntwenty-five thousand bales of cotton.\r\n\r\n                              W. T. SHERMAN, MAJOR GENERAL.\r\n\r\nSherman had sent the message by vessel to Fort Monroe, whence it was\r\ntelegraphed to Lincoln.\r\n\r\n%446. Sherman marches northward.%--At Savannah the army rested for a\r\nmonth. Sherman tells us in his _Memoirs_ that the troops grew impatient\r\nat this delay, and used to call out to him as he rode by: "Uncle Billy,\r\nI guess Grant is waiting for us at Richmond." So he was; but he did not\r\nwait very long, for on February 1, 1865, the march was resumed. The way\r\nwas across South Carolina to Columbia, and then into North Carolina,\r\nwith their old enemy, J. E. Johnston, in their front. Hood, in a rash\r\nmoment, had besieged Thomas at Nashville; but Thomas, coming out from\r\nbehind his intrenchments, utterly destroyed Hood\'s army. This forced\r\nDavis to put Johnston in command of a new army made up of troops taken\r\nfrom the seaport garrisons and remnants of Hood\'s army. In March,\r\nSherman reached Goldsboro in North Carolina.\r\n\r\n%447. Grant in Virginia.%--Meantime Grant had set out from Culpeper\r\nCourthouse on May 4, 1864, crossed the Rapidan, and entered the\r\n"Wilderness," a name given to a tract of country covered with dense\r\nwoods of oak and pine and thick undergrowth. The fighting was almost\r\nincessant. The loss of life was frightful; but he pushed on to\r\nSpottsylvania Courthouse, and thence to Cold Harbor, part of the line of\r\nfortifications before Richmond. He would, as he said, "fight it out on\r\nthis line if it takes all summer," and went south of Richmond and\r\nbesieged Petersburg.\r\n\r\n%448. Early\'s Raid, 1864.%--Lee now sent Jubal Early with 20,000\r\nsoldiers to move down the Shenandoah valley, enter Maryland, and\r\nthreaten Washington. This he did, and after coming up to the\r\nfortifications of the city, he retreated to Virginia. A little later,\r\nEarly sent his cavalry into Pennsylvania and burned Chambersburg.\r\n\r\nGrant thought it was time to stop this, and sent Sheridan with an army\r\nto drive Early out of the Shenandoah valley. "It is desirable," said\r\nGrant, "that nothing should be left to invite the enemy to return."\r\n\r\nSheridan set out accordingly, and on September 19 he met Early in battle\r\nat Winchester, and a few days later at Fishers Hill, beat him at both\r\nplaces, and sent him whirling up the valley. Sheridan followed for a\r\ntime, and then brought his army back to Cedar Creek, after burning\r\nbarns, destroying crops, and devastating the entire upper valley.\r\n\r\n%449. Sheridan\'s Ride.%--And now occurred a famous incident. About\r\nthe middle of October Sheridan went to Washington, and while on his way\r\nback slept on the night of October 18 at Winchester. At 7 A.M. on the\r\n19th he heard guns, but paid no attention to the sounds till 9 o\'clock,\r\nwhen, as he rode quietly out of Winchester, he met a mile from town\r\nwagon trains and fugitives, and heard that Early had surprised his camp\r\nat daylight. Dashing up the pike with an escort of twenty men, calling\r\nto the fugitives as he passed them to turn and face the enemy, he met\r\nthe army drawn up in line eleven miles from Winchester. "Far away in the\r\nrear," says an old soldier, "we heard cheer after cheer. Were\r\nreinforcements coming? Yes, Phil Sheridan was coming, and he was a\r\nhost." Dashing down the line, Sheridan shouted, "What troops are these?"\r\n"The Sixth Corps," came back the response from a hundred voices. "We are\r\nall right," said Sheridan, as he swung his old hat and dashed along the\r\nline to the right. "Never mind, boys, we\'ll whip them yet. We shall\r\nsleep in our old quarters to-night." And they did.[1] Early\r\nwas defeated.\r\n\r\n[Footnote:1] Read Sheridan\'s account in his _Personal Memoirs, _Vol.\r\nII., pp. 66-92.\r\n\r\n%450. Surrender of Lee.%--At the beginning of 1865 the situation of\r\nLee was desperate, and in February, Alexander H. Stephens, Vice\r\nPresident of the Confederacy, met Lincoln and Secretary Seward on a war\r\nvessel in Hampton Roads to discuss terms of peace. Lincoln demanded\r\nthree things: 1. That the Confederate armies be disbanded and the men\r\nsent home. 2. That the Confederate States submit to the rule of\r\nCongress. 3. That slavery be abolished. These terms were not accepted,\r\nand the war went on. Sherman marched northward through the Carolinas and\r\nwas re\xc3\xabnforced from the coast; every seaport in the Confederacy was soon\r\nin Union hands; Sheridan finally dispersed Early\'s troops, and joined\r\nGrant before Petersburg; and the lines of Grant\'s army were drawn closer\r\nand closer around Petersburg and Richmond.\r\n\r\nPlainly the end was near. On April 2 Lee announced to Davis that both\r\nPetersburg and Richmond must be abandoned at once. The rams in the James\r\nRiver were immediately blown up, and on the morning of April 3 General\r\nWeitzel, hearing from a negro what was going on, entered Richmond and\r\nfound that Lee was in full retreat. Grant followed, and on April 9\r\nforced Lee to surrender at Appomattox Courthouse, seventy-five miles\r\nwest of Richmond. Grant\'s treatment of Lee was most generous. He was not\r\nrequired to give up his sword, nor his officers their side arms, nor his\r\nmen their horses, which they would need, Grant said, "to work their\r\nlittle farms." Each officer was to give his parole not to take up arms\r\nagainst the United States "until properly exchanged"; each regimental\r\ncommander was to do the same for his men; and, "this done, each officer\r\nand man will be allowed to return to his home." Immediately after this\r\nsurrender 25,000 rations were issued to Lee\'s men.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The house in which Lee and Grant arranged the surrender]\r\n\r\n%451. End of the Confederacy.%--What little was left of the\r\nConfederacy now went rapidly to pieces. On April 26 Johnston surrendered\r\nto Sherman near Raleigh, North Carolina. A few days later the victorious\r\narmy started for Richmond, and then went on over battle-scarred\r\nVirginia to Washington. May 10, Jefferson Davis was captured. When Lee\r\nfled from Richmond, Davis hurried to Charlotte, N.C., with his cabinet,\r\nhis clerks, and such gold and silver coin as was in the Confederate\r\nTreasury. But the surrender of Johnston forced Davis to retreat still\r\nfarther south, till he reached Irwinsville, Ga., where the Union cavalry\r\novertook him.\r\n\r\n%452. The Grand Army disbands.%--As this was practically the end of\r\nthe Confederacy, the great Union army of citizen soldiers, numbering\r\nmore than 1,000,000 men, was called home from the field and disbanded.\r\nBefore these veterans separated, never to meet again with arms in their\r\nhands, they were reviewed by the President, Congress, and an immense\r\nthrong of people who came to Washington from every part of the loyal\r\nstates to welcome them. During two days (May 23 and 24, 1865) the\r\nsoldiers of Grant and Sherman, forming a column thirty miles long,\r\nmarched down Pennsylvania Avenue, and then, with a rapidity and\r\nquietness that seems almost incredible, scattered and went back to their\r\nfarms, to their shops, to the practice of their professions, and to the\r\ninnumerable occupations of civil life.\r\n\r\nOf the Confederates not one was molested, not a soldier was imprisoned,\r\nnot a political leader suffered death. Davis was ordered to be\r\nimprisoned at Fort Monroe for two years, but he was soon released on\r\nbail, was never brought to trial, and died at New Orleans in 1889.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\n1. After the election of Lincoln seven states seceded from the Union,\r\nand formed the "Confederate States of America."\r\n\r\n2. Four other states joined the Confederacy later.\r\n\r\n3. The refusal of the United States to recognize the right to secede led\r\nto the refusal to give up Federal forts in Charleston harbor. The\r\nattempt to take Sumter by force led to the appeal to arms.\r\n\r\n4. The line which separated the troops of the two governments ran from\r\nChesapeake Bay, across Virginia, and through Kentucky and Missouri, to\r\nNew Mexico.\r\n\r\n5. While the Union troops held the Confederates in check on the eastern\r\nend of the line, they broke through the line in the West, and, aided by\r\nthe Union fleet, opened the Mississippi River.\r\n\r\n6. The Confederates were thus driven from the Mississippi and forced\r\nback to the mountains of Georgia. Sherman was sent against them, and in\r\n1864 marched eastward through the heart of the Confederacy to\r\nthe Atlantic.\r\n\r\n7. Marching north from Savannah, across Georgia and South Carolina, to\r\nGoldsboro in North Carolina, he was now in the rear of the Confederate\r\narmy in Virginia.\r\n\r\n8. Grant, meantime, with the Army of the Potomac, had fought a series of\r\nbattles with Lee, and had besieged Richmond and Petersburg; and\r\nSheridan had cleared out the Shenandoah valley.\r\n\r\n9. Lee was thus forced, early in 1865, to leave Richmond, and while\r\nretreating westward he was forced to surrender.\r\n\r\n               SECESSION AND THE WAR FOR THE UNION\r\n                              |\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n     _The South_                      _The North_\r\nThe cotton states secede.

State of our Navy in 1861.%--On the day our flag went down at\r\nSumter, the navy of the United States consisted of ninety vessels of\r\nevery sort. Fifty of these were sailing ships. Forty were propelled by\r\nsteam. Of the steam fleet one was on the Lakes, five were unserviceable,\r\nseventeen were in foreign parts, and nine laid up in navy yards and out\r\nof service. Eight steam vessels (one a mere tender) and five sailing\r\nvessels (a fleet of thirteen) made up the naval force of the United\r\nStates that was available for actual service on April 15, 1861.\r\n\r\n%454. The Work before the Navy.%--The duty of the navy was to\r\n\r\n1. Blockade the coast from Norfolk in Virginia to the Bio Grande in\r\nTexas.\r\n\r\n2. Capture the seaports and forts scattered along this coast.\r\n\r\n3. Acquire control of the sounds and bays, as Chesapeake, Albemarle,\r\nPamlico, Mobile, and Galveston.\r\n\r\n4. Assist the army in opening the Mississippi, Arkansas, and other\r\nrivers.\r\n\r\n5. Destroy all Confederate cruisers and protect the commerce of the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nTo accomplish this great work, most of the vessels abroad were recalled\r\n(a slow process in days when no ocean cable existed), more were hastily\r\nbuilt, and in time 400 merchantmen and river steamboats were bought and\r\nroughly adapted at the navy yards for war service.\r\n\r\n%455. %The Blockade of the Southern Coast.%--The war on sea was\r\nopened (April 19-27,1861) by two proclamations of Lincoln declaring the\r\ncoast from Virginia to Texas blockaded. This meant that armed vessels\r\nwere to be stationed off the seaports of the South, and that no ships\r\nfrom any country were to be allowed to go into or out of them. To stop\r\ntrade with the South was important for three reasons:\r\n\r\n1. The South had no ships, no great gun factories, machine shops, or\r\nrolling mills, and must look to foreign countries for military supplies.\r\n\r\n2. The South raised (in 1860) 4,700,000 bales of cotton, almost all of\r\nwhich was sold to England and the North, and if this cotton should be\r\nsent abroad, the South could easily buy with it all the guns, ships, and\r\ngoods she needed.\r\n\r\n3. England was dependent on the South for raw cotton, and would sell for\r\nit everything the South wanted in exchange.\r\n\r\nThe blockade, therefore, was to cut off the trade and supplies of the\r\nSouth, and so weaken her. But as England, a great commercial nation,\r\nwanted her cotton, it was certain that unless the blockade were rigorous\r\nand close, cotton would be smuggled out and supplies sent in.\r\n\r\n%456. Blockade Runners%.--This is just what did happen. The blockade\r\nin the course of a year was made close, by ships stationed off the\r\nports, sounds, and harbors. In some places the hulks of old whalers were\r\nloaded with stone and sunk in the channels, and to get in or out became\r\nmore difficult. As a result the price of cotton fell to eight cents a\r\npound in the South (because there was nobody to buy it) and rose to\r\nfifty cents a pound in England (because so little was to be had). Then\r\n"running the blockade" became a regular business. Goods of all sorts\r\nwere brought from England to Nassau in the West Indies, where they would\r\nbe put on board of vessels built to run the blockade. These blockade\r\nrunners were long, low steam vessels which drew only a few feet of water\r\nand had great speed. Their hulls were but a few feet out of water and\r\nwere painted a dull gray. Their smokestacks could be lowered to the\r\ndeck, and they burned anthracite coal, which made no smoke. They would\r\nleave Nassau at such a time as would enable them to be off Wilmington,\r\nN.C., or some other Southern port, on a moonless night with a high tide,\r\nand then, making a dash, would run through the blockading vessels. Once\r\nin port, they would take a cargo of cotton, and would run out on a dark\r\nnight or during a storm. During the war, 1504 vessels of all kinds were\r\ncaptured or destroyed.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Read T. E. Taylor\'s _Running the Blockade, _pp. 16-32,\r\n44-54.]\r\n\r\n%457. The Commerce Destroyers.%--While the North was thus busy\r\ndestroying the trade of the South, the South was busy destroying the\r\nenormous trade of the North. When the war opened, our merchant ships\r\nwere to be seen in every port of the world, and against these were sent\r\na class of armed vessels known as "commerce destroyers," whose business\r\nit was to cruise along the great highways of ocean commerce, keep a\r\nsharp lookout for our merchantmen, and burn all they could find. The\r\nfirst of these commerce destroyers to get to sea was the _Sumter_, which\r\nran the blockade at the mouth of the Mississippi in June, 1861, and\r\nwithin a week had taken seven merchantmen. So important was it to\r\ncapture her that seven cruisers were sent in pursuit. But she escaped\r\nthem all till January, 1862, when she was shut up in the port of\r\nGibraltar and was sold to prevent capture.\r\n\r\n%458. The Trent Affair, 1861.%--One of the vessels sent in pursuit of\r\nthe _Sumter_ was the _San Jacinto, _commanded by Captain Wilkes. While\r\nat Havana, he heard that two commissioners of the Confederate\r\ngovernment, James M. Mason and John Slidell, sent out as commissioners\r\nto Great Britain and France, were to sail for England in the British\r\nmail steamer _Trent_; and, deciding to capture them, he took his station\r\nin the Bermuda Channel, and (November 8, 1861) as the _Trent_ came\r\nsteaming along, he stopped and boarded her, and carried off Mason and\r\nSlidell and their secretaries. This he had no right to do. It was\r\nexactly the sort of thing the United States had protested against ever\r\nsince 1790, and had been one of the causes of war with Great Britain in\r\n1812. The commissioners were therefore released, placed on board another\r\nEnglish vessel, and taken to England. The conduct of Great Britain in\r\nthis matter was most insulting and warlike, and nothing but the justice\r\nof her demand prevented war.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Harris\'s _The Trent Affair._]\r\n\r\n%459. The Famous Cruisers Florida, Alabama, Shenandoah.%--The loss\r\nof the _Sumter_ was soon made good by the appearance on the sea of a\r\nfleet of commerce destroyers all built and purchased in England with the\r\nfull knowledge of the English government. The first of these, the\r\n_Florida_, was built at Liverpool, was armed at an uninhabited island in\r\nthe Bahamas, and after roving the sea for more than a year was captured\r\nby the United States cruiser _Wachusett_ in the neutral harbor of Bahia\r\nin Brazil. Her capture was a shameful violation of neutral waters, and\r\nit was ordered that she be returned to Brazil; but she was sunk by "an\r\nunforeseen accident" in Hampton Roads.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Bullock\'s _Secret Service of the Confederate States in\r\nEurope,_ Vol. I., pp. 152-224.]\r\n\r\nThe next to get afloat was the _Alabama_. She was built at Liverpool\r\nwith the knowledge of the English government, and became in time one of\r\nthe most famous and successful of all the commerce destroyers. During\r\ntwo years she cruised unharmed in the North Atlantic, in the Gulf of\r\nMexico, in the Caribbean Sea, along the coast of South America, and even\r\nin the Indian Ocean, destroying in her career sixty-six merchant\r\nvessels. At last she was found in the harbor of Cherbourg (France) by\r\nthe _Kearsarge_, to which Captain Semmes of the _Alabama_ sent a\r\nchallenge to fight. Captain Winslow accepted it; and June 19, 1864,\r\nafter a short and gallant engagement, the _Alabama_ was sunk in the\r\nEnglish Channel.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Ibid_., Vol. I., pp. 225-294. _Battles and Leaders of the\r\nCivil War,_ Vol. IV., pp. 600-625.]\r\n\r\nThe _Shenandoah_, another cruiser, was purchased in England and armed\r\nat a barren island near Madeira. Thence she went to Australia, and\r\ncruising northward in the Pacific to Bering Strait, destroyed the\r\nChina-bound clippers and the whaling fleet. At last, hearing of the\r\ndownfall of the Confederacy, she went back to England.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Bullock\'s _Secret Service of the Confederate States in\r\nEurope_, Vol. II., pp. 131-163.]\r\n\r\n%460. The Ironclads.%--To blockade the coast and cut off trade was\r\nmost important, but not all that was needed. Here and there were\r\nseaports which must be captured and forts which must be destroyed, bays\r\nand sounds, and great rivers coming down from the interior, which it was\r\nvery desirable to secure control of. The Confederates were fully aware\r\nof this, and as soon as they could, placed on the waters of their rivers\r\nand harbors vessels new to naval warfare, called ironclad rams. These\r\nwere steamboats cut down and made suitable for naval purposes, and then\r\ncovered over with iron rails or thick iron plates. The most famous of\r\nthem was the _Merrimac_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: %Remodeling the Merrimac%]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: %The U.S. steamer Merrimac%]\r\n\r\n%461. The Merrimac or Virginia.%--When Sumter was fired on and the\r\nwar began, the United States held the great navy yard and naval depot at\r\nPortsmouth, Va., where were eleven war vessels of various sorts, and\r\nimmense quantities of guns and stores and ammunition. But the officer in\r\ncharge, knowing that Virginia was about to secede, and fearing that the\r\nyard would be seized by the Confederates, sank most of the ships, set\r\nfire to the buildings, and abandoned the place. The Confederates at once\r\ntook possession, raised the vessels, and out of one of them, a steamer\r\ncalled the _Merrimac_. made an ironclad ram, which they renamed the\r\n_Virginia_ and sent forth to destroy the wooden vessels of the United\r\nStates then assembled in Chesapeake Bay.\r\n\r\nWell knowing that he could not be harmed by any of our war ships, the\r\ncommander of the _Merrimac_ went leisurely to work and began (March 8,\r\n1862) by attacking the _Cumberland_. In her day the _Cumberland_ had\r\nbeen as fine a frigate as ever went to sea; but the days of wooden ships\r\nwere gone, and she was powerless. Her shot glanced from the sides of the\r\n_Merrimac _like so many peas, while the new monster, coming on under\r\nsteam, rammed her in the side and made a great hole through which the\r\nwater poured. Even then the commander of the _Cumberland_ would not\r\nsurrender, but fought his ship till she filled and sank with her guns\r\nbooming and her flag flying. After sinking the _Cumberland_, the\r\n_Merrimac_ attacked the _Congress_, forced her to surrender, set her on\r\nfire, and, as darkness was then coming on, went back to the shelter of\r\nthe Confederate batteries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Monitor, side and deck plan]\r\n\r\n%462. The Monitor.%--Early the next day the _Merrimac_ sailed forth\r\nto finish the work of destruction, and picking out the _Minnesota_,\r\nwhich was hard and fast in the mud, bore down to attack her. When lo!\r\nfrom beside the _Minnesota_ started forth the most curious-looking craft\r\never seen on water. It was the famous _Monitor_, designed by Captain\r\nJohn Ericsson, to whose inventive genius we owe the screw propeller and\r\nthe hot-air engine. She consisted of a small iron hull, on top of which\r\nrested a boat-shaped raft covered with sheets of iron which made the\r\ndeck. On top of the deck, which was about three feet above the water,\r\nwas an iron cylinder, or turret, which revolved by machinery and carried\r\ntwo guns. She looked, it was said, like "a cheesebox mounted on a raft."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HAMPTON ROADS]\r\n\r\nThe _Monitor_ was built at New York, and was intended for harbor\r\ndefense; but the fact that the Confederates were building a great\r\nironclad at Norfolk made it necessary to send her to Hampton Roads. The\r\nsea voyage was a dreadful one; again and again she was almost wrecked,\r\nbut she weathered the storm, and early on the evening of March 8, 1862,\r\nentered Hampton Roads, to see the waters lighted up by the burning\r\n_Congress_ and to hear of the sinking of the _Cumberland_. Taking her\r\nplace beside the _Minnesota_, she waited for the dawn, and about eight\r\no\'clock saw the _Merrimac_ coming toward her, and, starting out, began\r\nthe greatest naval battle of modern times. When it ended, neither ship\r\nwas disabled; but they were the masters of the seas, for it was now\r\nproved that no wooden ships anywhere afloat could harm them. The days of\r\nwooden naval vessels were over, and all the nations of the world were\r\nforced to build their navies anew. The _Merrimac_ withdrew from the\r\nfight; when the Confederates evacuated Norfolk, they destroyed her (May,\r\n1862). The _Monitor_ sank in a storm at sea while going to Beaufort,\r\nN.C. (January, 1863).[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Battles and Leaders of the Civil War_, Vol. I., pp.\r\n719-750.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: %An encounter at close range%]\r\n\r\n%463. Capture of the Coast Forts and Waterways.%--Operations along\r\nthe coast were begun in August, 1861, by the capture of the forts at the\r\nmouth of Hatteras Inlet, N.C., the entrance to Pamlico Sound; and by the\r\ncapture of Port Royal in November. A few months later (early in 1862)\r\ncontrol of Pamlico and Albemarle sounds was secured by the capture of\r\nRoanoke Island, Elizabeth City, and Newbern, all in North Carolina, and\r\nof Fort Macon, which guarded the entrance to Beaufort harbor.\r\nMcClellan\'s capture of Yorktown in May, 1862, was soon followed by the\r\nhasty evacuation of Norfolk by the Confederate forces, so that at the\r\nend of the first year of the war most of the seacoast from Norfolk to\r\nthe Gulf was in Union hands.\r\n\r\nAlong the Gulf coast naval operations resulted in opening the lower\r\nMississippi and capturing New Orleans in April, and Pensacola in\r\nMay, 1862.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1863, a naval attack on Charleston was planned, but was\r\ncarried no farther than a severe battering of Fort Sumter. In August,\r\n1864, Admiral Farragut led his fleet past Forts Morgan and Gaines, that\r\nguarded the entrance of Mobile Bay, captured the Confederate fleet and\r\ntook the forts. Mobile, however, was not taken till April, 1865, just as\r\nthe Confederacy reached its end. Fort Fisher, which commanded the\r\nentrance to Cape Fear River, on which stood Wilmington, the great port\r\nof entry for blockade runners, fell before the attack of a combined land\r\nand naval force in January, 1865.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\n1. The naval operations of the war opened with the blockade of the coast\r\nof the Confederate States.\r\n\r\n2. This was necessary in order to prevent cotton, sugar, and tobacco\r\nbeing sent abroad in return for materials of war.\r\n\r\n3. As a result blockade running was carried on to a great extent.\r\n\r\n4. In order to destroy our commerce a fleet of cruisers was built in\r\nEngland, purchased and manned by the Confederate government. They\r\ninflicted very serious damage.\r\n\r\n5. But the great event of the war was the battle between the ironclads\r\n_Monitor_ and _Merrimac_, which marked the advent of the\r\niron-armored war ship.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COST OF THE WAR\r\n\r\n%464. The Cost in Money.%--When Fort Sumter was fired on in 1861 and\r\nLincoln made his call for volunteers, the national debt was $90,000,000,\r\nthe annual revenue was $41,000,000, and the annual expenses of the\r\ngovernment $68,000,000. As the expenses were vastly increased by the\r\noutbreak of war, it became necessary to get more money. To do this,\r\nCongress, when it met in July, 1861, began a financial policy which must\r\nbe described if we are to understand the later history of our country.\r\n\r\n%465. Power to raise Money.%--The Constitution gives Congress power\r\n\r\n1. "To lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises."\r\n\r\n2. "To borrow money on the credit of the United States."\r\n\r\n3. To apportion direct taxes among the several states according to their\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\n%466. Raising Money by Taxation; Internal Revenue.%--Exercising these\r\npowers, Congress in 1861 increased the duties on articles imported, laid\r\na direct tax of $20,000,000. and imposed a tax of three per cent on\r\nall incomes over $800. The returns were large, but they fell far short\r\nof the needs of the government, and in 1862 an internal revenue system\r\nwas created. Taxes were now imposed on spirits and malt liquors; on\r\nmanufactured tobacco; on trades, professions, and occupations; till\r\nalmost everything a man ate, drank, wore, bought, sold, or owned was\r\ntaxed. The revenue collected from such sources between 1862 and 1865 was\r\n$780,000,000.\r\n\r\n%467. Raising Money "on the Credit of the United States."%--Money\r\nraised by internal revenue and the tariff was largely used to pay\r\ncurrent expenses and the interest on the national debt. The great war\r\nexpenses were met by borrowing money in two ways:\r\n\r\n1. By selling bonds.\r\n\r\n2. By issuing "United States notes."\r\n\r\n%468. The Bonded and Interest-paying Debt.%--The bonds were\r\nobligations by which the government bound itself to pay the holder the\r\nsum of money specified in the bond at the end of a certain period of\r\nyears, as twenty or thirty or forty. Meantime the holder was to be paid\r\ninterest at the rate of five, six, or seven per cent a year. Between\r\nJuly 1, 1861, and August 31, 1865, when our national debt was greatest,\r\n$1,109,000,000 worth of bonds had been sold to the people and the money\r\nused for war purposes.\r\n\r\n%469. United States Notes.%--The United States notes were of two\r\nkinds: those which bore interest, and those which did not. Those bearing\r\ninterest passed under various names, and by 1866 amounted to\r\n$577,000,000.\r\n\r\nUnited States notes bearing no interest were the "old demand notes," the\r\n"greenbacks," the "fractional currency," and the "national bank notes."\r\n\r\nThe greenbacks (a name given them from the green color of their backs)\r\nwere authorized early in 1862, were in denominations from $1 up, bore no\r\ninterest, were legal tender in payment of all debts, public and private,\r\nexcept duties on imports and interest on the public debt. In time\r\n$450,000,000 were authorized to be issued, and in 1864, $449,000,000\r\nwere in circulation.\r\n\r\n%470. Fractional Currency.%--The issue of the demand notes in 1861,\r\nand the fact, apparent to every one, that Congress must keep on issuing\r\npaper money, led the state banks to suspend specie payment in December,\r\n1861. As a consequence, the 3, 5, 10, 25, and 50 cent silver pieces (and\r\nof course all the gold) disappeared from circulation. This left the\r\npeople without small change, and for a time they were forced to pay\r\ntheir car fare and buy their newspapers and make change with postage\r\nstamps and "token" pieces of brass and copper, which passed from hand to\r\nhand as cents. Indeed, one act of Congress, in July, 1862, made it\r\nlawful to receive postage stamps (in sums under $5) in payment of\r\ngovernment dues. But in March, 1863, another step was taken, and an\r\nissue of $50,000,000 in paper fractional currency was authorized.\r\n\r\n%471. The National Banking System.%--Yet another financial measure to\r\naid the government was the creation of national banks. In 1863 Congress\r\nestablished the office of "Comptroller of the Currency," and authorized\r\nhim to permit the establishment of banking associations. Each must\r\nconsist of not less than five persons, must have a certain capital, and\r\nmust deposit with the Treasury Department at Washington government bonds\r\nequal to at least one third of its capital. The Comptroller was then to\r\nissue to each association bank notes not exceeding in value ninety per\r\ncent of the face value of the bonds. It was supposed that the state\r\nbanks, which then issued $150,000,000 in 7000 kinds of bank notes, would\r\ntake advantage of the law, become national banks, and use this national\r\nmoney, which would pass all over the country. This would enable the\r\ngovernment to sell the banks $150,000,000 and more of bonds. But the\r\nstate banks did not do so till 1865, when a tax of ten per cent was laid\r\non the amount of paper money each state bank issued. Then, to get rid of\r\nthe tax, hundreds of them bought bonds and became national banks.\r\n\r\n%472. The National Debt and State Expenditures.%--On the 31st of\r\nAugust, 1865, the national debt thus created reached its highest figure,\r\nand was in round numbers $2,845,000,000.\r\n\r\nBesides the debt incurred by the national government, there were heavy\r\nexpenditures by the states, and we might say by almost every city and\r\ntown, amounting to $468,000,000. But even when the war ended, the outlay\r\non account of the war did not cease. Each year there was interest to\r\npay on the bonded debt, and pensions to be given to disabled soldiers\r\nand sailors, and to the widows and orphans of men killed, and claims for\r\ndamages of all sorts to be allowed. Between July 1, 1861, and June 30,\r\n1879, the expenditure of the government growing out of the war amounted\r\nto $6,190,000,000.\r\n\r\nMany men who served in the army made great personal sacrifices. They\r\nwere taken away from some useful employment, from their farms, their\r\ntrades, their business, or their professions. What they might have\r\nearned or accomplished during the time of service was so much loss.\r\n\r\n%473. The Cost in Human Life.%--While the war was raging, Lincoln\r\nmade twelve calls for volunteers, to serve for periods varying from 100\r\ndays to three years. The first was the famous call of April 15, 1861,\r\nfor 75,000 three-months men; the last was in December, 1864. When the\r\nnumbers of soldiers thus summoned from their homes are added, we find\r\nthat 2,763,670 were wanted and 2,772,408 responded. This does not mean\r\nthat 2,770,000 different men were called into service or were ever at\r\nany one time under arms. Some served for three months, others for six\r\nmonths, a year, or three years. Very often a man would enlist and when\r\nhis term was out would reenlist. The largest number in service at any\r\ntime was in April, 1865. It was 1,000,516, of whom 650,000 were fit for\r\nservice. In 1865, 800,000 were mustered out between April and October.\r\n\r\nOf those who gave their lives to preserve the Union, 67,000 were killed\r\nin battle, 43,000 died of wounds, and 230,000 of disease and other\r\ncauses. In round numbers, 360,000 men gave up their lives in defense of\r\nthe Union. How many perished in the Confederate army cannot be stated,\r\nbut the loss was quite as large as on the Union side; so that it is safe\r\nto say that more than 700,000 men were killed in the war.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: A table giving the size of the armies and the loss of life\r\nwill be found in _Battles and Leaders of the Civil War_, Vol. IV., pp.\r\n767-768.]\r\n\r\n%474. Suffering in the South.%--The South raised all the cotton,\r\nnearly all the rice and tobacco, and one third of the Indian corn grown\r\nin our country, and depended on Europe and the North for manufactured\r\ngoods. But when the North, in 1861 and 1862, blockaded her ports and cut\r\noff these supplies, her distress began. Brass bells and brass kettles\r\nwere called for to be melted and cast into cannon, and every sort of\r\nfowling piece and old musket was pressed into service and sent to the\r\ntroops in the field. As money could not be had, treasury notes were\r\nissued by the million, to be redeemed "six months after the close of the\r\nwar." Planters were next pledged to loan the government a share of the\r\nproceeds of their cotton, receiving bonds in return. But the blockade\r\nwas so rigorous that very little cotton could get to Europe. When this\r\nfailed, provisions for the army were bought with bonds and with paper\r\nmoney issued by the states.\r\n\r\nThis steady issue of paper money, with nothing to redeem it, led to its\r\nrapid decrease in value. In 1864 it took $40 in Confederate paper money\r\nto buy a yard of calico. A spool of thread cost $20; a ham, $150; a\r\npound of sugar, $75; and a barrel of flour, $1200.\r\n\r\n%475. Makeshifts.%--Thrown on their own resources, the Southern people\r\nbecame home manufacturers. The inner shuck of Indian corn was made into\r\nhats. Knitting became fashionable. Homespun clothing, dyed with the\r\nextract of black-walnut bark or wild indigo or swamp maple or\r\nelderberries, was worn by everybody. Barrels and boxes which had been\r\nused for packing salt fish and pork were soaked in water, which was\r\nevaporated for the sake of the salt thus extracted. Rye or wheat roasted\r\nand ground became a substitute for coffee, and dried raspberry\r\nleaves for tea.\r\n\r\nQuite as desperate were the shifts to which the South was put for\r\nsoldiers. At first every young man was eager to rush to the front. But\r\nas time passed, and the great armies of the North were formed, it became\r\nnecessary to force men into the ranks, to "conscript" them; and in 1862\r\nan act of the Confederate Congress made all males from eighteen to\r\nthirty-five subject to military duty. In September, 1862, all men from\r\neighteen to forty-five, and later from sixteen to sixty, were subject to\r\nconscription. The slaves, of course, worked on the fortifications, drove\r\nteams, and cooked for the troops.\r\n\r\n%476. Cost to the South%.--Thus drained of her able-bodied\r\npopulation, the South went rapidly to rack and ruin. Crops fell off,\r\nproperty fell into decay, business stopped, railroads were ruined\r\nbecause men could not be had to keep them in repair, and because no\r\nrails could be obtained. The loss inflicted by this general and\r\nwidespread ruin can never be even estimated. Cotton, houses, property of\r\nevery sort, was destroyed to prevent capture by the Union forces. On\r\nevery battlefield incalculable damage was done to woods, villages,\r\nfarmhouses, and crops. Bridges were burned; cities, such as Richmond,\r\nAtlanta, Columbia, Charleston, were well-nigh destroyed by fire;\r\nthousands of miles of railroad were torn up and ruined. The loss\r\nentailed by the emancipation of the slaves, supposing each negro worth\r\n$500, amounts to $2,000,000,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\n1. When the war opened, and the army and navy were called into the\r\nfield, Congress proceeded to raise money by three methods: A. Increasing\r\ntaxation. B. Issuing bonds. C. Issuing paper money.\r\n\r\n2. Taxation was in three forms: A. Direct tax. B. Tariff duties. C.\r\nInternal revenue, which included a vast number of taxes.\r\n\r\n3. Paper money consisted of treasury notes, United States notes\r\n(greenbacks), fractional currency.\r\n\r\n4. Besides the cost to the nation, there was the cost to the states,\r\ncounties, cities, and towns for bounties, and in aid of the war in\r\ngeneral; and the cost to individuals.\r\n\r\n6. There is again the cost produced by the war and still being paid as\r\npensions, care of national cemeteries, etc., and interest on the\r\npublic debt.\r\n\r\n6. The cost in human life was great to both North and South; there was\r\nalso a destruction of property and business, the money value of which\r\ncannot be estimated.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"_THE INDESTRUCTIBLE UNION OF INDESTRUCTIBLE STATES._"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\n\r\nRECONSTRUCTION OF THE SOUTH\r\n\r\n%477. The Re\xc3\xablection of Lincoln%.--While the war was still raging,\r\nthe time came, in 1864, for the nomination of candidates for the\r\nPresidency and Vice Presidency. The situation was serious. On the one\r\nhand was the Democratic party, denouncing Mr. Lincoln, insisting that\r\nthe war was a failure, and demanding peace at any price. On the other\r\nhand was a large faction of the Republican party, finding fault with Mr.\r\nLincoln because he was not severe enough, because he had done things\r\nthey thought the Constitution did not permit him to do, and because he\r\nhad fixed the conditions on which people in the so-called seceding\r\nstates might send representatives and senators to Congress. Between\r\nthese two was a party made up of Republicans and of war Democrats, who\r\ninsisted that the Union must be preserved at all costs. These men held a\r\nconvention, and dropping the name "Republicans" for the time being, took\r\nthat of "National Union party," and renominated Lincoln. For Vice\r\nPresident they selected Andrew Johnson, a Union man and war Democrat\r\nfrom Tennessee.\r\n\r\nThe dissatisfied or Radical Republicans held a convention and nominated\r\nJohn C. Fr\xc3\xa9mont and General John Cochrane. They demanded one term for a\r\nPresident; the confiscation of the land of rebels; the reconstruction of\r\nrebellious states by Congress, not by the President; vigorous war\r\nmeasures; and the destruction of slavery forever.\r\n\r\nThe Democrats nominated General George B. McClellan and George H.\r\nPendleton. The platform demanded "a cessation of hostilities with a view\r\nto a convention of the states," and described the sacrifice of lives and\r\ntreasure in behalf of Union as "four years of failure to restore the\r\nUnion by the experiment of war." McClellan, in his letter of acceptance,\r\nrepudiated both of these sentiments. The platform called for peace\r\nfirst, and then union if possible. McClellan said union first, and then\r\npeace. "No peace can be permanent without union." The platform said the\r\nwar was a failure. McClellan said, "I could not look in the faces of my\r\ngallant comrades of the army and navy ... and tell them that their\r\nlabors and the sacrifice of so many of our slain and wounded brethren\r\nhad been in vain."\r\n\r\nThe result was never in doubt. By September Fr\xc3\xa9mont and Cochrane both\r\nwithdrew, and in November Lincoln and Johnson were elected, and on March\r\n4, 1865, were sworn into office.\r\n\r\n%478. The Murder of Lincoln%.--By that time the Confederacy was\r\ndoomed. Sherman had made his march to the sea; Savannah and Charleston\r\nwere in Union hands, and Lee hard pressed at Richmond. April 9 he\r\nsurrendered, and on April 14, 1865, the fourth anniversary of the\r\nevacuation of Fort Sumter, Anderson, now a major general, visited the\r\nfort which he had so gallantly defended, and in the presence of the army\r\nand navy raised the tattered flag he pulled down in 1861.\r\n\r\nThat night Lincoln went to Ford\'s Theater in Washington, and while he\r\nwas sitting quietly in his box, an actor named John Wilkes Booth came in\r\nand shot him through the head, causing a wound from which the President\r\ndied early next morning. His deed done, the assassin leaped from the box\r\nto the stage, and shouting, "Sic semper tyrannis" (So be it always to\r\ntyrants), the motto of Virginia, made his escape in the confusion of the\r\nmoment, and mounting a horse, rode away.\r\n\r\nThe act of Booth was one result of a conspiracy, the details of which\r\nwere soon discovered and the criminals punished. Booth was hunted by\r\nsoldiers and shot in a barn in Virginia. His accomplices were either\r\nhanged or imprisoned for life.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The best account of the murder of Lincoln is given in "Four\r\nLincoln Conspiracies" in the _Century Magazine_ for April, 1896.]\r\n\r\n%479. Andrew Johnson, President.%--Lincoln had not been many hours\r\ndead when Andrew Johnson, as the Constitution provides, took the oath of\r\noffice and became President of the United States. Before him lay the\r\nmost gigantic task ever given to any President.\r\n\r\n%480. Reconstruction.%--To dispose of the Confederate soldiers and\r\npoliticians was an easy matter; but to decide what to do with the\r\nConfederate states proved most difficult. Lincoln had always held that\r\nthey could not secede. If they could not secede, they had never been out\r\nof the Union, and if they had never been out of the Union, they were\r\nentitled, as of old, to send senators and representatives to Congress.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Andrew Johnson]\r\n\r\nBut whether the states had or had not seceded, the old state governments\r\nof 1861, and the relations these governments once held with the Union,\r\nwere destroyed by the so-called secession, and it was necessary to\r\ndefine some way by which they might be re\xc3\xabstablished, or, as it was\r\ncalled, "reconstructed."\r\n\r\nToward the end of 1863, accordingly, when the Union army had acquired\r\npossession of Tennessee, Arkansas, and Louisiana, Lincoln issued his\r\n"Amnesty Proclamation" and began the work of reconstruction. He\r\npromised, in the first place, that, with certain exceptions, which he\r\nmentioned, he would pardon[1] every man who should lay down his arms and\r\nswear to support and obey the Constitution, and the Emancipation\r\nProclamation. He promised, in the second place, that whenever, in any\r\nstate that had attempted secession, voters equal in number to one tenth\r\nof those who in 1860 voted for presidential electors, should take this\r\noath and organize a state government, he would recognize it; that is, he\r\nwould consider the state "reconstructed," loyal, and entitled to\r\nrepresentation in Congress.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: The Constitution gives the President power to pardon all\r\noffenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment.]\r\n\r\nFollowing out this plan, the people of Arkansas, Tennessee, and\r\nLouisiana made reconstructed state governments which Lincoln recognized.\r\nBut here Congress stepped in, refused to seat the senators from these\r\nstates, and made a plan of its own, which Lincoln vetoed.\r\n\r\n%481. Johnson\'s "My Policy" Plan of Reconstruction.%--So the matter\r\nstood when Lee and Johnston surrendered, when Davis was captured, and\r\nthe Confederacy fell to pieces. All the laws enacted by the Confederate\r\nCongress at once became null and void. Taxes were no longer collected;\r\nletters were no longer delivered; Confederate money had no longer any\r\nvalue. Even the state governments ceased to have any authority. Bands of\r\nUnion cavalry scoured the country, capturing such governors, political\r\nleaders, and prominent men as could be found, and striking terror into\r\nothers who fled to places of safety. In the midst of this confusion all\r\ncivil government ended. To reestablish it under the Constitution and\r\nlaws of the United States was, therefore, the first duty of the\r\nPresident, and he began to do so at once. First he raised the blockade,\r\nand opened the ports of the South to trade; then he ordered the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury, the Secretary of the Interior, the\r\nPostmaster-general, the Attorney-general, to see that the taxes were\r\ncollected, that letters were delivered, that the courts of the United\r\nStates were opened, and the laws enforced in all the Southern States;\r\nfinally, he placed over each of the unreconstructed states a temporary\r\nor provisional governor. These governors called conventions of delegates\r\nelected by such white men as were allowed to vote, and these conventions\r\ndid four things: 1. They declared the ordinances of secession null and\r\nvoid. 2. They repudiated every debt incurred in supporting the\r\nConfederacy, and promised never to pay one of them. 3. They abolished\r\nslavery within their own bounds. 4. They ratified the Thirteenth\r\nAmendment to the Constitution, which abolished slavery forever in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n%482. The Thirteenth Amendment%.--This amendment was sent out to the\r\nstates by Congress in February, 1865, and was necessary to complete the\r\nwork begun by the Emancipation Proclamation. That proclamation merely\r\nset free the slaves in certain parts of the country, and left the right\r\nto buy more untouched. Again, certain slave states (Delaware, Maryland,\r\nWest Virginia, Kentucky, Missouri) had not seceded, and in them slavery\r\nstill existed. In order, therefore, to abolish the institution of\r\nslavery in every state in the Union, an amendment to the Constitution\r\nwas necessary, as many of the states could not be relied on to abolish\r\nit within their bounds by their own act. The amendment was formally\r\nproclaimed a part of the Constitution on December 18, 1865.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Before an amendment proposed by Congress can become a part\r\nof the Constitution, it must be accepted or ratified by the legislatures\r\nof three fourths of all the states. In 1865 there were thirty-six states\r\nin the Union, and of these, sixteen free, and eleven slave states\r\nratified the Thirteenth Amendment, and so made it part of the\r\nConstitution. When an amendment has been ratified by the necessary\r\nnumber of states, the President states the fact in a proclamation.]\r\n\r\n%483. Treatment of the Freedmen in the South%.--Had the Southern\r\nlegislatures stopped here, all would have been well. But they went on,\r\nand passed a series of laws concerning vagrants, apprentices, and\r\npaupers, which kept the negroes in a state of involuntary servitude, if\r\nnot in actual slavery.\r\n\r\nTo the men of the South, who feared that the ignorant negroes would\r\nrefuse to work, these laws seemed to be necessary. But by the men of the\r\nNorth they were regarded as signs of a determination on the part of\r\nSouthern men not to accept the abolition of slavery. When, therefore,\r\nCongress met in December, 1865, the members were very angry because the\r\nPresident had reconstructed the late Confederate states in his own way\r\nwithout consulting Congress, and because these states had made such\r\nsevere laws against the negroes.\r\n\r\n%484. Congressional Plan of Reconstruction%.--As soon as the two\r\nhouses were organized, the President and his work were ignored, the\r\nsenators and representatives from the eleven states that had seceded\r\nwere refused seats in Congress, and a series of acts were passed to\r\nprotect the freedmen.\r\n\r\nOne of these, enacted in March, 1866, was the "Civil Rights" Bill, which\r\ngave negroes all the rights of citizenship and permitted them to sue for\r\nany of these rights (when deprived of them) in the United States courts.\r\nThis was vetoed; but Congress passed the bill over the veto. Now, a law\r\nenacted by one Congress can, of course, be repealed by another, and lest\r\nthis should be done, and the freedmen be deprived of their civil rights,\r\nCongress (June, 1866) passed the Fourteenth Amendment to the\r\nConstitution, and made the ratification of it by the Southern States a\r\ncondition of readmittance to Congress.\r\n\r\nFinally, a Freedmen\'s Bureau Bill, ordering the sale of government land\r\nto negroes on easy terms, and giving them military protection for their\r\nrights, was passed over the President\'s veto, just before Congress\r\nadjourned.\r\n\r\n%485. The President abuses Congress%.--During the summer, Johnson\r\nmade speeches at Western cities, in which, in very coarse language, he\r\nabused Congress, calling it a Congress of only part of the states; "a\r\nfactious, domineering, tyrannical Congress," "a Congress violent in\r\nbreaking up the Union." These attacks, coupled with the fact that some\r\nof the Southern States, encouraged by the President\'s conduct, rejected\r\nthe Fourteenth Amendment, made Congress, when it met in December, 1866,\r\nmore determined than ever. By one act it gave negroes the right to vote\r\nin the territories and in the District of Columbia. By another it\r\ncompelled the President to issue his orders to the army through General\r\nGrant, for Congress feared that he would recall the troops stationed in\r\nthe South to protect the freedmen. But the two important acts were the\r\n"Tenure of Office Act" and "Reconstruction Act" (March 2, 1867).\r\n\r\n%486. The Reconstruction Act%.--The Reconstruction Act marked out the\r\nten unreconstructed states (Tennessee had been admitted to Congress in\r\nMarch, 1866) into five districts, with an army officer in command of\r\neach, and required the people of each state to make a new constitution\r\ngiving negroes the right to vote, and send the constitution to Congress.\r\nIf Congress accepted it, and if the legislature assembled under it\r\nratified the Fourteenth Amendment, they might send senators and\r\nrepresentatives to Congress, and not before.\r\n\r\nTo these terms six states (North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida,\r\nAlabama, Louisiana, and Arkansas) submitted, and in June, 1868, they\r\nwere readmitted to Congress. Their ratification of the Fourteenth\r\nAmendment made it a part of the Constitution, and in July, 1868, it was\r\ndeclared in force.\r\n\r\n%487. "Tenure of Office Act"; Johnson impeached%--By this time the\r\nquarrel between the President and Congress had reached such a crisis\r\nthat the Republican, leaders feared he would obstruct the execution of\r\nthe reconstruction law by removing important officials chiefly\r\nresponsible for its administration, and putting in their places men who\r\nwould not enforce it. To prevent this, Congress, in 1867, passed the\r\n"Tenure of Office Act." Hitherto a President could remove almost any\r\nFederal office holder at pleasure. Henceforth he could only suspend\r\nwhile the Senate examined into the cause of suspension. If it approved,\r\nthe man was removed; if it disapproved, the man was reinstated. Johnson\r\ndenied the right of Congress to make such a law, and very soon\r\ndisobeyed it.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1867, he asked Secretary of War Stanton to resign, and when\r\nthe Secretary refused, suspended him and made General Grant temporary\r\nSecretary. All this was legal, but when Congress met, and the Senate\r\ndisapproved of the suspension, General Grant gave the office back again\r\nto Stanton. Johnson then appointed General Lorenzo Thomas Secretary of\r\nWar, and ordered him to seize the office. For this, and for his abusive\r\nspeeches about Congress, the House of Representatives impeached him, and\r\nthe Senate tried him "for high crimes and misdemeanors," but failed by\r\none vote to find him guilty. Stanton then resigned his office.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\n1. In 1864 the Republican party was split, and one part, taking the name\r\nof National Union party, renominated Lincoln. The other or radical wing,\r\nwhich wanted a more vigorous war policy, nominated Fr\xc3\xa9mont and Cochrane.\r\nThe Democrats declared the war a failure, demanded peace, and nominated\r\nMcClellan and Pendleton.\r\n\r\n2. The gradual conquest of the South brought up the question of the\r\nrelation to the Federal government of a state which had seceded.\r\n\r\n3. Lincoln marked out his own plan of reconstruction in an amnesty\r\nproclamation. Congress thought he had no right to do this, and adopted a\r\nplan which Lincoln vetoed. His death left the question for Johnson\r\nto settle.\r\n\r\n4. Johnson adopted a plan of his own and soon came into conflict with\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\n5. Congress began by refusing seats to congressmen from states\r\nreconstructed on Johnson\'s plan. It then passed, over Johnson\'s veto, a\r\nseries of bills to protect the freedmen and give them civil rights.\r\n\r\n6. Six states accepted the terms of reconstruction offered, and their\r\nsenators and representatives were admitted to Congress (1868).\r\n\r\n7. Johnson, in 1866, traveled about the West abusing Congress. For this,\r\nand chiefly for his disregard of the Tenure of Office Act, he was\r\nimpeached by the House and tried and acquitted by the Senate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRECONSTRUCTON.\r\n\r\nLincoln\'s plan ...\r\n\r\nStates cannot secede; only some of their people were in insurrection.\r\nAmnesty proclamation.\r\nRecognizes Arkansas, Tennessee, and Louisiana.\r\nThirteenth Amendment.\r\n\r\nJohnson\'s plan ...\r\n\r\nProvisional governors.\r\nRatify Thirteenth Amendment.\r\nNew state constitutions made.\r\nCongressmen chosen.\r\n\r\nCongressional plan ...\r\n\r\nCongress refuses them seats.\r\nCivil Rights Bill.\r\nFreedmen\'s Bureau Bill.\r\nTenure of Office Act.\r\nReconstruction Act.\r\nFourteenth Amendment.\r\n\r\nJohnson _vs._ Congress ...\r\n\r\nVetoes   Civil Rights Bill.\r\n         Freedmen\'s Bureau Bill.\r\n\r\nDenounces Congress.\r\nViolates Tenure of Office Act.\r\nImpeached.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW WEST (1860-1870)\r\n\r\n%488. Discovery of Gold near Pikes Peak.%--In the summer of 1858 news\r\nreached the Missouri that gold had been found on the eastern slope of\r\nthe Rockies, and at once a wild rush set in for the foot of Pikes Peak,\r\nin what was then Kansas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Crossing the plains]\r\n\r\nDuring 1858 a party from the gold mines of Georgia pitched a camp on\r\nCherry Creek and called the place Aurania. Later, in the winter, they\r\nwere joined by General Larimer with a party from Leavenworth, Kan., and\r\nby them the rude camp at Aurania was renamed Denver, in honor of the\r\ngovernor of Kansas. In another six months emigrants came pouring in from\r\nevery point along the frontier. Some, providing themselves with great\r\nwhite-covered wagons, drawn by horses, oxen, or mules, joined forces for\r\nbetter protection against the Indians, and set out together, making\r\nlong wagon trains or caravans. All were accompanied by men fully armed.\r\nSuch as could not afford a "prairie schooner," as the canvas-covered\r\nwagon was called, put their worldly goods into handcarts.\r\n\r\nBy 1859 Denver was a settlement of 1000 people. They needed supplies,\r\nand, to meet this demand, the firm of Russell, Majors, and Waddell put a\r\ndaily line of coaches on the road from Leavenworth to Denver. This means\r\nof communication brought so many settlers that by 1860 Denver was a city\r\nof frame and brick houses, with two theaters, two newspapers, and a mint\r\nfor coining gold.\r\n\r\n%489. The Pony Express; the Overland Stage.%--By that time, too, the\r\nfirst locomotive had reached the frontier of Kansas. But between the\r\nMissouri and the Pacific there was still a gap of 2000 miles which the\r\nsettlers demanded should be spanned at once, and it was. In 1860 the\r\nsame firm that sent the first stagecoach over the prairie from\r\nLeavenworth to Denver, ran a pony express from the Missouri to the\r\nPacific. Their plan was to start at St. Joseph, Mo., and send the mail\r\non horseback across the continent to San Francisco. As the speed must be\r\nrapid, there must be frequent relays. Stations were therefore\r\nestablished every twenty-five miles, and at them fresh horses and riders\r\nwere kept. Mounted on a spirited Indian pony, the mail carrier would set\r\nout from St. Joseph and gallop at breakneck speed to the first relay\r\nstation, swing himself from his pony, vault into the saddle of another\r\nstanding ready, and dash on toward the next station. At every third\r\nrelay a fresh rider took the mail. Day and night, in sunshine and storm,\r\nover prairie and mountain, the mail carrier pursued his journey alone.\r\nThe cost in human life was immense. The first riders made the journey of\r\n1996 miles in ten days. Next came the Wells and Fargo Express, and then\r\nthe Butterfield Overland Stage Company.\r\n\r\n%490. The Union Pacific Railroad; the Land Grant Roads.%--Meantime\r\nthe war opened, and an idea often talked of took definite shape.\r\nCalifornia had scarcely been admitted, in 1850, when the plan to bind\r\nher firmly to the Union by a great railroad, built at national cost, was\r\nurged vigorously. By 1856 the people began to demand it, and in that\r\nyear the Republican party, and in 1860 both the Republican and\r\nDemocratic parties, pledged themselves to build one. The secession of\r\nthe South, and the presence at Denver of a growing population, made the\r\nneed imperative, and in 1862 Congress began the work.\r\n\r\nTwo companies were chartered. One, the Union Pacific, was to begin at\r\nOmaha and build westward. The other, the Central Pacific, was to begin\r\nat Sacramento and build eastward till the two met. The Union Pacific was\r\nto receive from the government a subsidy in bonds of $16,000 for each\r\nmile built across the plains, $48,000 for each of 150 miles across the\r\nRocky Mountains, and $32,000 a mile for the rest of the way. It received\r\nall told on its 1033 miles $27,226,000. The Central Pacific, under like\r\nconditions, received for its 883 miles from San Francisco to Ogden\r\n$27,850,000. But the liberality of Congress did not end here. Each road\r\nwas also given every odd-numbered section in a strip of public land\r\ntwenty miles wide along its entire length.\r\n\r\n%491. Land Grants for Railroads and Canals.%--Grants of land in aid\r\nof such improvements were not new. Between 1827 and 1860 Congress gave\r\naway to canals, roads, and railroads 215,000,000 acres. This magnificent\r\nexpanse would make seven states as large as Pennsylvania, or three and a\r\nhalf as large as Oregon, and is only 6000 acres less than the total area\r\nof the thirteen original states with their present boundaries.\r\n\r\nAlthough the roads were chartered in 1862, the work of construction was\r\nslow at first, and the last rail was not laid till May 10, 1869.\r\n\r\n%492. The Silver Mines; New States and Territories.%--What the\r\ndiscovery of gold did for California and Denver, silver and the railroad\r\ndid for the country east of the Sierras. In 1859 some gold seekers in\r\nwhat was then Utah discovered the rich silver mines on Mt. Davidson.\r\nPopulation rushed in, Virginia City sprang into existence, the territory\r\nof Nevada was formed in 1861, and in 1864 entered the Union as a state.\r\nIn 1861 Colorado was made a territory, and what is now North and South\r\nDakota and the land west of them to the Rocky Mountain divide became the\r\nterritory of Dakota. Hardly was this done when gold was found in a gulch\r\non the Jefferson Fork of the Missouri River. Bannock City, Virginia\r\nCity, and Helena were laid out almost immediately, and in 1864 Montana\r\nwas made a territory. In 1860 and 1862 precious metals were found in\r\nwhat was then eastern Washington; Lewiston, Idaho City, and the old\r\nHudson Bay Company\'s post of Fort Boise became thriving towns, and in\r\n1863 the territory of Idaho was formed, with limits including what is\r\nnow Montana and part of Wyoming. In 1863 Arizona was cut off from New\r\nMexico, and in 1868 Wyoming was made a territory.\r\n\r\n%493. Population in 1870.%--Thus in the decade from 1860 to 1870\r\ngold, silver, and the Pacific Railroad gave value to the American\r\nDesert, brought two states (Nevada and Nebraska) into the Union, and\r\ncaused the organization of six new territories. More than 1,000,000\r\npeople then lived along the line of the Union Pacific. Our total\r\npopulation in 1870 was 38,000,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\n1. What the discovery of gold did for California in 1849, it did for the\r\n"Great American Desert" in 1858.\r\n\r\n2. The consequences were the founding of Denver, the establishment of a\r\nstagecoach line from the Missouri to Denver, the pony express to the\r\nPacific; the overland coach; and the Pacific Railroad.\r\n\r\n3. Gold, the railroad, and the silver mines led to the organization of\r\nColorado, Nevada, Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming, and the admission of\r\nNebraska and Nevada into the Union.\r\n\r\n4. Other causes led to the organization of Arizona and Dakota.\r\n\r\nNew States (1860-1870).\r\n\r\n   Kansas, 1861.\r\n   West Virginia, 1863.\r\n   Nevada, 1864.\r\n   Nebraska, 1867.\r\n   Total number of states in 1870, 37.\r\n\r\nNew Territories (1860-1870).\r\n\r\n   Colorado, 1861.\r\n   Dakota, 1861.\r\n   Idaho, 1863.\r\n   Arizona, 1863.\r\n   Montana, 1864.\r\n   Wyoming, 1868.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_THE ECONOMIC STRUGGLE_\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICS FROM 1868 TO 1880\r\n\r\n%494. New Issues before the People.%--Five years had now passed since\r\nthe surrender of Lee, and nine since the firing on Sumter. During these\r\nyears the North, aroused and united by the efforts put forth to crush\r\nthe Confederacy, had entered on a career of prosperity and development\r\ngreater than ever enjoyed in the past. With this changed condition came\r\nnew issues, some growing out of the results of the war, and some out of\r\nthe development of the country.\r\n\r\n%495. Amnesty.%--In the first place, now that the war was over, the\r\npeople were heartily tired of war issues. Taking advantage of this,\r\ncertain political leaders began, about 1870, to demand a "general\r\namnesty" [1] or forgiveness for the rebels, and a stoppage of\r\nreconstructive measures by Congress.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In 1863, Lincoln offered "full pardon" to "all persons"\r\nexcept the leaders of the "existing rebellion." Johnson, in 1865, again\r\noffered amnesty, but increased the classes of excepted persons; and,\r\nthough in the autumn of 1867 he cut down the list, he nevertheless left\r\na great many men unpardoned.]\r\n\r\n%496. The National Finances.%--A second issue resulting from the war\r\nwas the management of the national finances. January 1, 1866, the\r\nnational debt amounted to $2,740,000,000, including (1) the bonded debt\r\nof $1,120,000,000, and (2) the unbonded or floating debt of\r\n$1,620,000,000, that part made up of "greenbacks," fractional currency,\r\ntreasury notes, and the like. Two problems were thus brought before\r\nthe people:\r\n\r\n1. What shall be done with the national bonded debt?\r\n\r\n2. How shall the paper money be disposed of and "specie payment"\r\nresumed?\r\n\r\nAs to the first question, it was decided to pay the bonds as fast as\r\npossible; and by 1873 the debt was reduced by more than $500,000,000.\r\n\r\nAs to the second question, it was decided to "contract the currency" by\r\ngathering into the Treasury and there canceling the "greenbacks." This\r\nwas begun, and their amount was reduced from $449,000,000 in 1864 to\r\n$356,000,000 in 1868.\r\n\r\nBy that time a large part of the people in the West were finding fault\r\nwith "contraction." Calling in the greenbacks, they held, was making\r\nmoney scarce and lowering prices. Congress, therefore, in 1868 yielded\r\nto the pressure, and ordered that further contraction should stop and\r\nthat there should not be less than $356,000,000 of greenbacks.\r\n\r\n%497. "The Ohio Idea"; the Greenback Party.%--But there was still\r\nanother idea current. To understand this, six facts must be remembered.\r\n1. In 1862 Congress ordered the issue of certain 5-20 bonds; that is,\r\nbonds that might be paid after five years, but must be paid in twenty\r\nyears. 2. The interest on these bonds was made payable "in coin." 3. But\r\nnothing was said in the bond as to the kind of money in which the\r\nprincipal should be paid. 4. When the greenbacks were issued, the law\r\nsaid they should be "lawful money and a legal tender for all debts,\r\npublic and private, within the United States, except duties on imports\r\nand interest as aforesaid." 5. This made it possible to pay the\r\nprincipal of the 5-20 bonds in greenbacks instead of coin. 6. Fearing\r\nthat payment of the principal in greenbacks might have a bad effect on\r\nfuture loans, Congress, when it passed the next act (March 3, 1863) for\r\nborrowing money, provided that _both_ principal and interest should be\r\npaid in coin.\r\n\r\nAt that time and long after the war "coin" commanded a premium; that is,\r\nit took more than 100 cents in paper money to buy 100 cents in gold.\r\nAnybody who owned a bond could therefore sell the coin he received as\r\ninterest for paper and so increase the rate of interest measured in\r\npaper money. The bonds, again, could not be taxed by any state or\r\nmunicipality.\r\n\r\nBecause of these facts, there arose a demand after the war for two\r\nthings--taxation of the bonds and payment of the 5-20\'s in greenbacks.\r\nThis idea was so prevalent in Ohio in 1868 that it was called the "Ohio\r\nidea," and its supporters were called "Greenbackers."\r\n\r\n%498. Opposition to Land Grants to Railroads.%--Much fault was now\r\nfound with Congress for giving away such great tracts of the public\r\ndomain. In 1862 a law known as the Homestead Act was passed. By it a\r\nfarm of 80 or 160 acres was to be given to any head of a family, or any\r\nperson twenty-one years old, who was a citizen of the United States or,\r\nbeing foreign born, had declared an intention to become a citizen,\r\nprovided he or she lived on the farm and cultivated it for five years.\r\nUnder this great and generous law 103,000 entries for 12,000,000 acres\r\nwere made between 1863 and 1870. This showed that the people wanted land\r\nand was one reason why it should not be given to corporations.\r\n\r\n%499. The Election of 1868.%--The questions discussed above (pp.\r\n437-439) became the political issues of 1868.\r\n\r\nThe Republicans nominated Grant and Schuyler Colfax and declared for the\r\npayment of all bonds in coin; for a reduction of the national debt and\r\nthe rate of interest; and for the encouragement of immigration.\r\n\r\nThe Democrats nominated Horatio Seymour and Francis P. Blair, and\r\ndemanded amnesty; rapid payment of the debt; "one currency for the\r\ngovernment, and the people, the laborer, and the office holder"; the\r\ntaxation of government bonds; and no land grants for public\r\nimprovements.\r\n\r\nThe popular vote was 5,700,000. In the electoral college Grant had 214\r\nvotes, and Seymour 80.\r\n\r\n%500. Troubles in the South; the Ku Klux Klan.%--Grant and Colfax\r\nbegan their term of office on March 4, 1869, and soon found that the\r\nreconstruction policy of Congress had not been so successful as they\r\ncould wish, and that the work of protecting the freedman in the exercise\r\nof his new rights was not yet completed. Three states (Virginia,\r\nMississippi, and Texas) had not yet complied with the conditions\r\nimposed by Congress, and were still refused seats in the House and\r\nSenate. No sooner had the others complied with the Reconstruction Act of\r\n1867, and given the negro the right to vote, than a swarm of Northern\r\npoliticians, generally of the worst sort, went down and, as they said,\r\n"ran things." They began by persuading the negroes that their old\r\nmasters were about to put them back into slavery, that it was only by\r\nelecting Union men to office that they could remain free; and having by\r\nthis means obtained control of the negro vote, they were made governors\r\nand members of Congress, and were sent to the state legislature, where,\r\nseated beside negroes who could neither read nor write, but who voted as\r\nordered, these "carpetbaggers," [1] as they were called, ruled the states\r\nin the interest of themselves rather than in that of the people.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: As the men were not natives of the South, had no property\r\nthere, and were mostly political adventurers, they were called\r\n"carpetbaggers," or men who owned nothing save what they brought in\r\ntheir carpetbags.]\r\n\r\nNow, you must remember that in many of the Southern states the negro\r\nvoters greatly outnumbered the white voters, because there were more\r\nblack men than white men, and because many of the whites were still\r\ndisfranchised; that is, could not vote. When these men, who were\r\nproperty owners and taxpayers, found that the carpetbaggers, by means of\r\nthe negro vote, were plundering and robbing the states, they determined\r\nto prevent the negro from voting, and so drive the carpetbaggers from\r\nthe legislatures. To do this, in many parts of the South they formed\r\nsecret societies, called "The Invisible Empire" and "The Ku Klux Klan."\r\nCompletely disguised by masks and outlandish dresses, the members rode\r\nat night, and whipped, maimed, and even murdered the objects of their\r\nwrath, who were either negroes who had become local political leaders,\r\nor carpetbaggers, or "scalawags," as the Southern whites who supported\r\nthe negro cause were called.\r\n\r\n%501. The Fifteenth Amendment.%--To secure the negro the right to\r\nvote, and make it no longer dependent on state action, a Fifteenth\r\nAmendment was passed by Congress in February, 1869, and, after\r\nratification by the necessary number of states, was put in force in\r\nMarch, 1870. As the Ku Klux were violating this amendment, by preventing\r\nthe negroes from voting, Congress, in 1871, passed the "Ku Klux" or\r\n"Force" Act. It prescribed fine and imprisonment for any man convicted\r\nof hindering, or even attempting to hinder, any negro from voting, or\r\nthe votes, when cast, from being counted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: U. S. Grant]\r\n\r\n%502. Rise of the Liberal Republicans.%--This legislation and the\r\nconflicts that grew out of it in Louisiana kept alive the old issue of\r\namnesty, and in Missouri split the Republican party and led to the rise\r\nof a new party, which received the name of "Liberal Republicans,"\r\nbecause it was in favor of a more liberal treatment of the South. From\r\nMissouri, the movement spread into Iowa, into Kansas, into Illinois, and\r\ninto New Jersey, and by 1872 was serious enough to encourage the leaders\r\nto call for a national convention which gathered at Cincinnati (May,\r\n1872), and, after declaring for amnesty, universal suffrage, civil\r\nservice reform, and no more land grants to railroads, nominated Horace\r\nGreeley, of New York, for President, and B. Gratz Brown, the Liberal\r\nleader of Missouri, for Vice President. The nomination of Greeley\r\ndispleased a part of the convention, which went elsewhere, and nominated\r\nW. S. Groesbeck and F. L. Olmsted. The Republicans met at Philadelphia\r\nin June, and nominated Grant and Henry Wilson. The Democrats pledged\r\ntheir support to Greeley and Brown; but this act displeased so many of\r\nthe Democratic party, that another convention was held, and Charles\r\nO\'Conor and John Quincy Adams were placed in the field.\r\n\r\n%503. The National Labor-Reform Party.%--From about 1829, when the\r\nestablishment of manufactures, the building of turnpikes and canals, the\r\ngrowth of population, the rise of great cities, and the arrival of\r\nemigrants from Europe led to the appearance of a great laboring class,\r\nthe workingman had been in politics. But it was not till the close of\r\nthe war that labor questions assumed national importance. In 1865 the\r\nfirst National Labor Congress was held at Louisville in Kentucky. In\r\n1866 a second met at Baltimore; a third at Chicago in 1867; and a fourth\r\nat New York in 1868, to which came woman suffragists and labor-reform\r\nagitators. The next met at Philadelphia in 1869 and called for a great\r\nNational Labor Congress which met at Cincinnati in 1870 and demanded\r\n\r\n1. Lower interest on government bonds.\r\n\r\n2. Repeal of the law establishing the national banks.\r\n\r\n3. Withdrawal of national bank notes.\r\n\r\n4. Issue of paper money "based on the faith and resources of the\r\nnation," to be legal tender for all debts.\r\n\r\n5. An eight-hour law.\r\n\r\n6. Exclusion of the Chinese.\r\n\r\n7. No land grants to corporations.\r\n\r\n8. Formation of a "National Labor-Reform Party."\r\n\r\nThe idea of a new party with such principles was so heartily approved,\r\nthat a national convention met at Columbus, O., in 1872, denounced\r\nChinese labor, demanded taxation of government bonds, and nominated\r\nDavid Davis and Joel Parker. When they declined, O\'Conor was nominated.\r\n\r\n%504. Anti-Chinese Movement.%--The demand in the Labor platform for\r\nthe exclusion of Chinese makes it necessary to say a word concerning\r\n"Mongolian labor."\r\n\r\nChinamen were attracted to our shore by the discovery of gold in\r\nCalifornia, but received little attention till 1852, when the governor\r\nin a message reminded the legislature that the Chinese came not as\r\nfreemen, but were sent by foreign capitalists under contract; that they\r\nwere the absolute slaves of these masters; that the gold they dug out of\r\nour soil was sent to China; that they could not become citizens; and\r\nthat they worked for wages so low that no American could compete\r\nwith them.\r\n\r\nThe legislature promptly acted, and repeatedly attempted to stop their\r\nimmigration by taxing them. But the Supreme Court declared such taxation\r\nillegal, whereupon, the state having gone as far as it could, an appeal\r\nwas made to Congress. That body was deaf to all entreaties; but the\r\nPresident through Anson Burlingame in 1868 secured some new articles to\r\nthe old Chinese treaty of 1858. Henceforth it was to be a penal offense\r\nto take Chinamen to the United States without their free consent. This\r\nwas not enough, and in order to force Congress to act, the question was\r\nmade a political issue.\r\n\r\n%505. The Prohibition Party.%--The temperance cause in the United\r\nStates dates back to 1810. But it was not till Maine passed a law\r\nforbidding the sale of liquor, in 1851, and her example was followed by\r\nVermont and Rhode Island in 1852, by Connecticut in 1854, and by New\r\nYork, New Hampshire, Michigan, and Iowa, in 1855, that prohibition\r\nbecame an issue. The war turned the thoughts of people to other things.\r\nBut after the war, prohibition parties began to appear in several\r\nstates, and in 1869 steps were taken to unite and found a national\r\nparty. In that year, the Grand Lodges of Good Templars held a convention\r\nat Oswego, N.Y., and by these men a call was issued for a national\r\nconvention of prohibitionists to form a political party. The delegates\r\nthus summoned met at Chicago in September, 1869, and there founded the\r\n"National Prohibition Reform party." The first national nominating\r\nconvention was held at Columbus, O., in 1872, when James Black of\r\nPennsylvania was nominated for President, and John Russell of Michigan\r\nfor Vice President.\r\n\r\n%506. Campaign of 1872.%--At the beginning of the campaign there were\r\nthus seven presidential candidates before the people. But some refused\r\nto run, and others had no chance, so that the contest was really between\r\nGeneral Grant and Horace Greeley, who was caricatured unmercifully. The\r\nbenevolent face of the great editor, spectacled, and fringed with a\r\nsnow-white beard, appeared on fans, on posters, on showcards, where, as\r\na setting sun, it might be seen going down behind the western hills. "Go\r\nwest," his famous advice to young men, became the slang phrase of the\r\nhour. He was defeated, for Grant carried thirty-one states, and\r\nGreeley six.\r\n\r\nIn many respects this was a most interesting election. For the first\r\ntime in our history the freedmen voted for presidential electors. For\r\nthe first time since 1860 the people of all the states took part in the\r\nelection of a President of the United States, while the number of\r\ncandidates, Labor, Prohibition, Liberal Republican, Democratic, and\r\nRepublican, showed that the old issues which caused the war or were\r\ncaused by the war were dead or dying, and that new ones were\r\ncoming forward.\r\n\r\n%507. Panic of 1873.%--Now, all these things, the immense expansion\r\nof the railroads, and the great outlay necessary for rebuilding Chicago,\r\nmuch of which had been burned in 1871, and Boston, which suffered from a\r\ngreat fire in 1872, absorbed money and made it difficult to get. Just in\r\nthe midst of the stringency a quarrel arose between the farmers and the\r\nrailroads in the West, and made matters worse. It stopped the sale of\r\nrailroad bonds, and crippled the enterprises that depended on such sale\r\nfor funds. It impaired the credit of bankers concerned in railroad\r\nbuilding, and in September, 1873, a run on them for deposits began till\r\none of them, Jay Cooke & Co., failed, and at once a panic swept over the\r\nbusiness world. Country depositors demanded their money; the country\r\nbanks therefore withdrew their deposits with the city banks, which in\r\nturn called in their loans, and industry of every kind stopped. In 1873\r\nthere were 5000 failures, and in 1874 there were 5800. Hours of labor\r\nwere reduced, wages were cut down, workingmen were discharged by\r\nthousands.\r\n\r\n%508. The Inflation Bill.%--In hope of relieving this distress by\r\nmaking money easier to get, a demand was now made that Congress should\r\nissue more greenbacks. To this Congress, in 1874, responded by passing\r\nthe "Inflation Bill," declaring that there should be $400,000,000 in\r\ngreenbacks, no more, no less. As the limit fixed in 1868 was\r\n$356,000,000, the bill tended to "inflate" or add to the paper currency\r\n$44,000,000. Grant vetoed the bill.\r\n\r\n%509. Resumption of Specie Payments.%--What shall be done with the\r\ncurrency? now became the question of the hour, and at the next session\r\nof Congress (1874-75) another effort was made to answer it, and "an act\r\nto provide for the resumption of specie payments" was passed.\r\n\r\n1. Under this law, silver 10, 25, and 50 cent pieces were to be\r\nexchanged through the post offices and subtreasuries for fractional\r\ncurrency till it was all redeemed.\r\n\r\n2. Surplus revenue might be used and bonds issued for the purchase of\r\ncoin.\r\n\r\n3. That part of an act of 1870 which limited the amount of national bank\r\nnotes to $354,000,000 was repealed.\r\n\r\n4. The banks could now put out more bills; but for each $100 they put\r\nout the Secretary of the Treasury must call in $80 of greenbacks, till\r\nbut $300,000,000 of them remained.\r\n\r\n5. After January 1,1879, he must redeem them all on demand.\r\n\r\n%510. The Political Issues of 1876.%--The currency question, the hard\r\ntimes which had continued since 1873, the rise of the Labor and\r\nProhibition parties, the reports of shameful corruption and dishonesty\r\nin every branch of the public service, the dissatisfaction of a large\r\npart of the Republican party with the way affairs were managed by the\r\nadministration, combined to make the election of 1876 very doubtful. The\r\ngeneral displeasure was so great that the Democratic party not only\r\ncarried state elections in the North in 1874 and 1875, but secured a\r\nmajority of the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\n%511. Nomination of Presidential Candidates.%--When the time came to\r\nmake nominations for the presidency, the Prohibition party was first to\r\nact. It selected Green Clay Smith of Kentucky and G.T. Stewart of Ohio\r\nas its candidates, and demanded that in all the territories and the\r\nDistrict of Columbia, the importation, exportation, manufacture, and\r\nsale of alcoholic beverages should be stopped. Two other demands--the\r\nabolition of polygamy (which was practiced by the Mormons in Utah), and\r\nthe closing of the mails to the advertisements of gambling and lottery\r\nschemes--have since been secured.\r\n\r\nNext came the Greenback or Independent National party, which nominated\r\nPeter Cooper of New York and Samuel F. Cary of Ohio, and called for the\r\nrepeal of the Resumption of Specie Payment Act, and the issue of paper\r\nnotes bearing a low rate of interest.\r\n\r\nIn June, the Republicans met in Cincinnati, and nominated Rutherford B.\r\nHayes of Ohio, and William A. Wheeler of New York. They endorsed the\r\nfinancial policy of the party, demanded civil service reform, protection\r\nto American industries, no more land grants to corporations, an\r\ninvestigation of the effect of Chinese immigration, and "respectful\r\nconsideration" of the woman\'s rights question.\r\n\r\nThe Democrats nominated Samuel J. Tilden and Thomas A. Hendricks, and\r\ncalled for reforms of every kind--in the civil service, in the\r\nadministration, in expenditures, in the internal revenue system, in the\r\ncurrency, in the tariff, in the use of public lands, in the treatment of\r\nthe South.\r\n\r\n%512. Result of the Election.%--While the campaign was going on,\r\nColorado was admitted (in August, 1876) as a state. There were then\r\nthirty-eight states in the Union, casting 369 electoral votes. This made\r\n185 necessary for a choice; and when the returns were all in, it\r\nappeared that, if the Republicans could secure the electoral votes of\r\nSouth Carolina, Florida, Louisiana, and Oregon, they would have exactly\r\n185. In these states, however, a dispute was raging as to which set of\r\nelectors, Republican or Democratic, was elected. Each claimed to be;\r\nand, as the result depended on them, each set met and voted. It was then\r\nfor Congress to decide which should be counted.\r\n\r\nNow, the framers of the Constitution had never thought of such a\r\ncondition of affairs, and had made no provisions to meet it. Congress\r\ntherefore provided for an\r\n\r\n%513. "Electoral Commission,"% to decide which of the conflicting\r\nreturns should be accepted. This commission was to be composed of five\r\nsenators, five representatives, and five justices of the Supreme Court.\r\nThe Senate chose three Republicans and two Democrats; the House, three\r\nDemocrats and two Republicans. Congress appointed two Democratic and\r\ntwo Republican justices, who chose the fifth justice, who was a\r\nRepublican. The Commission thus consisted of eight Republicans and seven\r\nDemocrats. The decision as to each of the disputed states was in favor\r\nof the Republican electors, and as it could not be reversed unless both\r\nhouses of Congress consented, and as both would not consent, Hayes was\r\ndeclared elected, over Tilden, by one electoral vote; namely, Hayes,\r\n185; Tilden, 184.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rutherford B. Hayes]\r\n\r\n%514. Financial Policy of Grant\'s Administration.%--The inauguration\r\nof Hayes was followed by a special session of Congress. In the House was\r\na great Democratic majority, pledged to a new financial measure--a\r\npledge which it soon made good.\r\n\r\nThe financial policy of Grant\'s eight years may be summed up briefly:\r\n\r\n1. (1869) The "Credit Strengthening Act," declaring that 5-20 bonds of\r\nthe United States should be paid "in coin."\r\n\r\n2. (1870) The Refunding Act, by which $1,500,000,000 in bonds bearing\r\nfive and six per cent interest were ordered to be replaced by other\r\nbonds at four, four and a half, and five per cent. In this refunding,\r\nthe 5-20\'s, whose principal was payable in greenbacks, were replaced by\r\nothers whose principal was payable "in coin."\r\n\r\n3. (1873) The act of 1873, by stopping the coinage of silver dollars,\r\nand taking away the legal tender quality of those in circulation, made\r\nthe words "in coin" mean gold.\r\n\r\n4. (1875) All greenbacks were to become redeemable in specie on January\r\n1, 1879.\r\n\r\n5. To get specie, bonds might be issued.\r\n\r\n%515. Bland Silver Bill; Silver remonetized.%--Against the\r\ncontinuance of this policy the majority of the House stood pledged.\r\nBefore the session closed, therefore, two bills passed the House. One\r\nrepealed so much of the act of 1875 as provided for the retirement of\r\ngreenbacks and the issue of bonds. The second was brought in by Mr.\r\nBland of Missouri, and is still known by his name. It provided\r\n\r\n1. That the silver dollar should again be coined, and at the ratio of 16\r\nto 1; that is, that the same number of dollars should be made out of\r\nsixteen pounds of silver as out of one pound of gold.\r\n\r\n2. That silver should be a legal tender, at face value, for all debts,\r\npublic and private.\r\n\r\n3. That all silver bullion brought to the mints should be coined into\r\ndollars without cost to the bringer. This was "free coinage of silver."\r\n\r\nThe House passed the bill, but the Senate rejected the "free coinage"\r\nprovision and substituted the "Allison" amendment. Under this, the\r\nSecretary of the Treasury was to _buy_ not less than $2,000,000, nor\r\nmore than $4,000,000, worth of silver bullion each month, and coin it\r\ninto dollars.\r\n\r\nThe House accepted the Senate amendment, and when Hayes vetoed the bill\r\nCongress passed it over his veto and the "Bland-Allison Bill" became a\r\nlaw in 1878.\r\n\r\n%516. Silver Certificates.%--Now this return to the coinage of the\r\nsilver dollar was open to the objection that large sums in silver would\r\nbe troublesome because of the weight. It was therefore provided that the\r\ncoins might be deposited in the Treasury, and paper "silver\r\ncertificates" issued against them.\r\n\r\nA few months later, January 1, 1879, the government returned to specie\r\npayment, and ever since has redeemed greenbacks in gold, on demand.\r\n\r\n%517. Foreign Relations; the French in Mexico.%--The statement was\r\nmade that with the exception of Russia the great powers of Europe\r\nsympathized with the South during the Civil War. Two of them, France and\r\nGreat Britain, were openly hostile. The French Emperor allowed\r\nConfederate agents to contract for the construction of war vessels in\r\nFrench ports,[1] and sent an army into Mexico to overturn that republic\r\nand establish an empire. Mexico owed the subjects of Great Britain,\r\nFrance, and Spain large sums of money, and as she would not pay, these\r\nthree powers in 1861 sent a combined army to hold her seaports till the\r\ndebts were paid. But it soon became clear that Napoleon had designs\r\nagainst the republic, whereupon Great Britain and Spain withdrew.\r\nNapoleon, however, seeing that the United States was unable to interfere\r\nbecause of the Civil War, went on alone, destroyed the Mexican republic\r\nand made Maximilian (a brother of the Emperor of Austria) Emperor of\r\nMexico. This was in open defiance of the Monroe Doctrine, and though the\r\nUnited States protested, Napoleon paid no attention till 1865. Then, the\r\nCivil War having ended, and Sheridan with 50,000 veteran troops having\r\nbeen sent to the Rio Grande, the French soldiers were withdrawn (1867),\r\nand the Mexican republican party captured Maximilian, shot him, and\r\nre\xc3\xabstablished the republic.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: See Bullock\'s _Secret Service of the Confederate States in\r\nEurope_.]\r\n\r\n%518. The Alabama Claims; Geneva Award.%--The hostility of Great\r\nBritain was more serious than that of France. As we have seen, the\r\ncruisers (_Alabama, Shenandoah, Florida_) built in her shipyards went to\r\nsea and inflicted great injury on our commerce. Although she was well\r\naware of this, she for a long time refused to make good the damage done.\r\nBut wiser counsel in the end prevailed, and in 1871, by the treaty of\r\nWashington, all disputed questions were submitted to arbitration.\r\n\r\nThe Alabama claims, as they were called, were sent to a board of five\r\narbitrators who met at Geneva (1872) and awarded the United States\r\n$15,500,000 to be distributed among our citizens whose ships and\r\nproperty had been destroyed by the cruisers.\r\n\r\n%519. Other International Disputes; the Alaska Purchase.%--To the\r\nEmperor of Germany was submitted the question of the true water boundary\r\nbetween Washington Territory and British Columbia. He decided in favor\r\nof the United States (1872).\r\n\r\nTo a board of Fish Commissioners was referred the claim of Canada that\r\nthe citizens of the United States derived more benefit from the fishing\r\nin Canadian waters than did the Canadians from using the coast waters of\r\nthe United States. The award made to Great Britain was $5,500,000\r\n$5,500,000 (1877).\r\n\r\nIn 1867, we purchased Alaska from Russia for $7,200,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\n\r\n_Financial History, 1868-1880_\r\n\r\n1. When the war ended, the national debt consisted of two parts: the\r\nbonded, and the unbonded or floating.\r\n\r\n2. As public sentiment demanded the reduction of the debt, it was\r\ndecided to pay the bonds as fast as possible, and contract the currency\r\nby canceling the greenbacks.\r\n\r\n3. Contraction went on till 1868, when Congress ordered it stopped.\r\n\r\n4. The payment of the bonds brought up the question, Shall the 5-20\'s be\r\npaid in coin or greenbacks?\r\n\r\n5. The Democrats in 1868 insisted that the bonds should be redeemed in\r\ngreenbacks; the Republicans that they should be paid in coin,--and when\r\nthey won, they passed the "Credit Strengthening Act" of 1869, and in\r\n1870 refunded the bonds at lower rates.\r\n\r\n6. In the process of refunding, the 5-20\'s, whose principal was payable\r\nin greenbacks, were replaced by others payable "in coin." In 1873, the\r\ncoinage of the silver dollar was stopped, and the legal-tender quality\r\nof silver was taken away. The words "in coin" therefore meant "in gold."\r\n\r\n7. In 1875 it was ordered that all greenbacks should be redeemed in\r\nspecie after January 1, 1879 (resumption of specie payment).\r\n\r\n8. In 1878 silver was made legal tender, and given limited coinage.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The South and the Negro_\r\n\r\n9. In 1869, three states still refused to comply with the Reconstruction\r\nAct of 1867 and had no representatives in Congress.\r\n\r\n10. Such states as had complied and given the negro the right to vote\r\nwere under "carpetbag" rule.\r\n\r\n11. This rule became so unbearable that the Ku Klux Klan was organized\r\nto terrify the negroes and keep them from the polls.\r\n\r\n12. Congress in consequence sent out the Fifteenth Amendment to the\r\nConstitution, and in 1871 enacted the Force Act.\r\n\r\n13. These and other issues, as that of amnesty, split the Republican\r\nparty and led to the appearance of the Liberal Republicans in 1872.\r\n\r\n14. In general, however, party differences turned almost entirely on\r\nfinancial and industrial issues.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INDUSTRIAL AND RAILROAD MAP OF THE UNITED STATES]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nGROWTH OF THE NORTHWEST\r\n\r\n%520. Results of the War.%--The Civil War was fought by the North for\r\nthe preservation of the Union and by the South for the destruction of\r\nthe Union. But we who, after more than thirty years, look back on the\r\nresults of that struggle, can see that they did not stop with the\r\npreservation of the Union. Both in the North and in the South the war\r\nproduced a great industrial revolution.\r\n\r\n%521. Effect on the South.%--In the South, in the first place, it\r\nchanged the system of labor from slave to free. While the South was a\r\nslave-owning country free labor would not come in. Without free labor\r\nthere could be no mills, no factories, no mechanical industries. The\r\nSouth raised cotton, tobacco, sugar, and left her great resources\r\nundeveloped. After slavery was abolished, the South was on the same\r\nfooting as the North, and her splendid resources began at once to be\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nIt was found that her rich deposits of iron ore were second to none in\r\nthe world. It was found that beneath her soil lay an unbroken coal\r\nfield, 39,000 square miles in extent. It was found that cotton, instead\r\nof being raised in less quantity under a system of free labor, was more\r\nwidely cultivated than ever. In 1860, 4,670,000 bales were grown; but in\r\n1894 the number produced was 9,500,000. The result has been the rise of\r\na New South, and the growth of such manufacturing centers as Birmingham\r\nin Alabama and Chattanooga in Tennessee, and of that center of commerce,\r\nAtlanta, in Georgia.\r\n\r\n%522. Rise of New Industries in the North.%--Much the same industrial\r\nrevolution has taken place in the North. The list of industries well\r\nknown to us, but unknown in 1860, is a long one. The production of\r\npetroleum for commercial purposes began in 1859, when Mr. Drake drilled\r\nhis well near Titusville, in Pennsylvania. In 1860 the daily yield of\r\nall the wells in existence was not 200 barrels. But by 1891 this\r\nindustry had so developed that 54,300,000 barrels were produced in that\r\nyear, or 14,900 a day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Scene in the oil regions of Pennsylvania]\r\n\r\nThe last thirty years have seen the rise of cheese making as a\r\ndistinctive factory industry; of the manufacture of oleo-margarine, wire\r\nnails, Bessemer steel, cotton-seed oil, coke, canned goods; of the\r\nimmense mills of Minneapolis, where 10,000,000 barrels of flour are made\r\nannually, and of the meat dressing and packing business for which\r\nChicago and Kansas City are famous.\r\n\r\n%523. The New Northwest.%--When the census was taken in 1860, so few\r\npeople were living in what are now Wyoming, Montana, and Idaho that\r\nthey were not counted. In Dakota there were less than 5000 inhabitants.\r\nThe discovery of gold and silver did for these territories what it had\r\ndone for Colorado. It brought into them so many miners that in 1870 the\r\npopulation of these four territories amounted to 59,000. Between Lake\r\nSuperior (where in the midst of a vast wilderness Duluth had just been\r\nlaid out on the lake shore) and the mining camps in the mountains of\r\nMontana, there was not a town nor a hamlet. (There were indeed a few\r\nforts and Indian agencies and a few trading posts.) Northern Minnesota\r\nwas a forest, into which even the lumbermen had not gone. The region\r\nfrom the Missouri to the Rocky Mountains was the hunting ground of the\r\nSioux, and was roamed over by enormous herds of buffalo.\r\n\r\n%524. The Northern Pacific Railroad.%--But this great wilderness was\r\nsoon to be crossed by one of the civilizers of the age. After years of\r\nvain effort, the promoters of the Northern Pacific began the building of\r\ntheir road in 1870, and pushed it across the plains till Duluth and St.\r\nPaul were joined with Puget Sound. As it went further and further\r\nwestward, emigrants followed it, towns sprang up, and cities grew with\r\nastonishing rapidity.\r\n\r\n%525. The New States.%--Idaho, which had no white inhabitants in\r\n1860, had 32,000 in 1880; Montana had 39,000 in 1880, as against none in\r\n1860. Kansas in twenty years increased her population four fold, and\r\nNebraska eight fold. This was extraordinary; but it was surpassed by\r\nDakota, whose population increased nearly ten fold in ten years\r\n(1870-1880), and in 1889 was half a million. The time had now come to\r\nform a state government. But as most of the people lived in the south\r\nend of the territory, it was cut in two, and North and South Dakota were\r\nadmitted into the Union as states on the same day (November 2, 1889);\r\nMontana followed within a fortnight, and Idaho and Wyoming within a year\r\n(July, 1890). The four territories, in which in 1860 there were but 5000\r\nwhite settlers, had thus by 1890 become the five states of North and\r\nSouth Dakota, Montana, Idaho, and Wyoming, with a population of\r\n790,000.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Colorado was admitted to the Union in 1876, Washington in\r\n1889 (November 11); and Utah, the forty-fifth state, in 1896, under a\r\nconstitution forever prohibiting polygamy.]\r\n\r\n%526. Wheat Farms and Cattle Ranches.%--Such a rush of people\r\ncompletely transformed the country. The "Great American Desert" was made\r\nproductive. The buffaloes were almost exterminated, and one now is as\r\ngreat a curiosity in the West as in the East. More than 7,000,000 were\r\nslaughtered in 1871-1872. In lieu of them countless herds of cattle and\r\nsheep, and fields of wheat and corn, cover the plains and hills of the\r\nNorthwest. In 1896 Montana contained 3,000,000 sheep, and Wyoming and\r\nIdaho each over 1,000,000. In the two Dakotas 60,000,000 bushels of\r\nwheat and 30,000,000 of corn were harvested. Many of the farms are of\r\nenormous size. Ten, twenty, thirty thousand acre farms are not unknown.\r\nOne contains 75,000 acres.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A typical prairie sod house]\r\n\r\nOver this region, the Dakotas, Montana, Kansas, and Nebraska, wander\r\nherds of cattle, the slaughtering and packing of which have founded new\r\nbranches of industry. The stockyards at Chicago make a city.[1]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: Read "Dakota Wheat-Fields," _Harper\'s Magazine,_ March,\r\n1880. Also a series of papers in _Harper\'s Magazine _for 1888.]\r\n\r\n%527. Oklahoma.%--The eagerness of the "cattle kings" to get more\r\nland for these herds to graze over had much to do with the opening of\r\nOklahoma for settlement. Originally it was part of Indian Territory, and\r\nwas sold by the Seminole Indians with the express condition that none\r\nbut Indians and freedmen should settle there. But the cattle kings, in\r\ndefiance of the government, went in and inclosed immense tracts. Many\r\nwere driven out, only to come in again. Their expulsion, with that of\r\nsmall proprietors called "boomers," caused much agitation. Congress\r\nbought a release from the condition, and in 1889 opened Oklahoma to\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\n%528. The Boom Towns.%--A proclamation that a part of Oklahoma would\r\nbe opened April 22, caused a wild rush from every part of the West, till\r\nfive times as many settlers as could possibly obtain land were lined up\r\non the borders waiting for the signal to cross. Precisely at noon on\r\nApril 22, a bugle sounded, a wild yell answered, a cloud of dust filled\r\nthe air, and an army of men on foot, on horseback, in wagons, rushed\r\ninto the promised land. That morning Guthrie was a piece of prairie\r\nland. That night it was a city of 10,000 souls. Before the end of the\r\nyear 60,000 people were in Oklahoma, building towns and cities of no\r\nmean character.\r\n\r\nWithin fifteen years Oklahoma had a population of over half a million;\r\nand Congress provided (1906) for the admission, in 1907, of a new\r\nforty-sixth state, including both Oklahoma and what was left of the old\r\nIndian Territory.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\n1. One important result of the Civil War was a great industrial\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\n2. Mining for precious metals, the Northern Pacific Railroad, and other\r\ncauses led to the admission into the Union of Colorado (1876), North and\r\nSouth Dakota, Montana, Washington (1889), Idaho, Wyoming (1890), Utah\r\n(1896), and Oklahoma (1907).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nMECHANICAL AND INDUSTRIAL PROGRESS\r\n\r\n%529. Mechanical Progress.%--The mechanical progress made by our\r\ncountrymen since the war surpasses that of any previous period. In 1866\r\nanother cable was laid across the bed of the Atlantic Ocean, and worked\r\nsuccessfully. Before 1876 the Gatling gun, dynamite, and the barbed-wire\r\nfence were introduced; the compressed-air rock drill, the typewriter,\r\nthe Westinghouse air brake, the Janney car coupler, the cable-car\r\nsystem, the self-binding reaper and harvester, the cash carrier for\r\nstores, water gas, and the tin-can-making machine were invented, and\r\nBrush gave the world the first successful electric light.\r\n\r\n%530. Uses of Electricity.%--Till Brush invented his arc light and\r\ndynamo, the sole practical use made of electricity was in the field of\r\ntelegraphy. But now in rapid succession came the many forms of electric\r\nlights and electric motors; the electric railway, the search light;\r\nphotography by electric light; the welding of metals by electricity; the\r\nphonograph and the telephone. In the decade between 1876 and 1886 came\r\nalso the hydraulic dredger, the gas engine, the enameling of sheet-iron\r\nware for kitchen use, the bicycle, and the passenger elevator, which has\r\ntransformed city life and dotted our great cities with buildings fifteen\r\nand twenty stories high.\r\n\r\nThe decade 1886-1896 gave us the graphophone, the kinetoscope, the\r\nhorseless carriage, the vestibuled train, the cash register, the\r\nperfected typewriter; the modern bicycle, which has deeply affected the\r\nlife of the people; and a great development in photography.\r\n\r\n%531. Rise of Great Corporations.%--That mechanical progress so\r\nastonishing should powerfully affect the business and industrial world\r\nwas inevitable. Trades, occupations, industries of all sorts, began to\r\nconcentrate and combine, and corporations took the place of individuals\r\nand small companies. In place of the forty little telegraph companies of\r\n1856, there was the great Western Union Company. In place of many petty\r\nrailroads, there were a few trunk lines. In place of a hundred producers\r\nand refiners of petroleum, there was the one Standard Oil Company. These\r\nare but a few of many; for the rapid growth of corporations was a\r\ncharacteristic of the period.\r\n\r\n%532. Millionaires and "Captains of Industry."%--As old lines of\r\nindustry were expanded and new ones were created, the opportunities for\r\nmoney-getting were vastly increased. Men now began to amass immense\r\nfortunes in gold and silver mining; by dealing in coal, in grain, in\r\ncattle, in oil; by speculation in stocks; in iron and steel making; in\r\nrailroading,--millionaires and multi-millionaires became numerous, and\r\nwere often called "captains of industry," as an indication of the power\r\nthey held in the industrial world.\r\n\r\n%533. Condition of Labor.%--Meanwhile, the conditions of the\r\nworkingman were also changing rapidly: 1. The chief employers of labor\r\nwere corporations and great capitalists. 2. The short voyage and low\r\nfare from Europe, the efforts made by steamship companies to secure\r\npassengers, the immense business activity in the country from 1867 to\r\n1872, and the opportunities afforded by the rapidly growing West,\r\nbrought over each year hundreds of thousands of immigrants from Europe\r\nto swell the ranks of labor. Between 1867 and 1873 the number was\r\n2,500,000. 3. Bad management on the part of some corporations;\r\n"watering" or unnecessarily increasing their stock on the part of\r\nothers, combined with sharp competition, began, especially after the\r\npanic of 1873, to cut down dividends. This was followed by reduction of\r\nwages, or by an increase in the duties of employees, and sometimes\r\nby both.\r\n\r\n%534. Labor Organizations; the Knights of Labor.%--Trades unions\r\nexisted in our country before the Constitution; but it was at the time\r\nof the great industrial development during and after the war, that the\r\nera of unions opened. At first that of each trade had no connection\r\nwith that of any other. But in 1869 an effort was made to unite all\r\nworkingmen on the broad basis of labor, and "The Noble Order of Knights\r\nof Labor" was founded. For a while it was a secret order; but in 1878 a\r\ndeclaration of principles was made, which began with the statement that\r\nthe alarming development and aggressiveness of great capitalists and\r\ncorporations, unless checked, "would degrade the toiling masses," and\r\nannounced that the only way to check this evil was to unite "all\r\nlaborers into one great body." The knights were in favor of\r\n\r\n1. The creation of bureaus of labor for the collection and spread of\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n2. Arbitration between employers and employed.\r\n\r\n3. Government ownership of telegraphs, telephones, railroads.\r\n\r\n4. The reduction of the working day to eight hours.\r\n\r\nThey were opposed\r\n\r\n1. To the hiring out of convict labor.\r\n\r\n2. To the importation of foreign labor under contract.\r\n\r\n3. To interest-bearing government bonds, and in favor of a national\r\ncurrency issued directly to the people without the intervention\r\nof banks.\r\n\r\n%535. The Workingman in Politics%.--As these ends could be secured\r\nonly by legislation, they very quickly became political issues and\r\nbrought up a new set of economic questions for settlement. From 1865 to\r\n1870 the matters of public concern were the reconstruction measures and\r\nthe public debt. From 1870 to 1878 they were currency questions, civil\r\nservice reform, and land grants to railroads. From 1878 to 1888 almost\r\nevery one of them was in some way directly connected with labor.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\n1. Great inventions founded and developed new industries.\r\n\r\n2. These in turn expanded the ranks of labor, and led to the rise of\r\ncorporations and labor organizations, and a demand for a long series\r\nof reforms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV\r\n\r\n\r\nPOLITICS SINCE 1880\r\n\r\n%536. Candidates in 1880.%--The campaign of 1880 was opened by the\r\nmeeting of the Republican national convention at Chicago, where a long\r\nand desperate effort was made to nominate General Grant for a third\r\nterm. But James Abram Garfield and Chester A. Arthur were finally\r\nchosen. The platform called for national aid to state education, for\r\nprotection to American labor, for the suppression of polygamy in Utah,\r\nfor "a thorough, radical, and complete" reform of the civil service, and\r\nfor no more land grants to railroads or corporations.\r\n\r\nThe Greenback-Labor party nominated James B. Weaver and B.J. Chambers,\r\nand declared\r\n\r\n1. That all money should be issued by the government and not by banking\r\ncorporations.\r\n\r\n2. That the public domain must be kept for actual settlers and not given\r\nto railroads.\r\n\r\n3. That Congress must regulate commerce between the states, and secure\r\nfair, moderate, and uniform rates for passengers and freight.\r\n\r\nNext came the Prohibition party convention, and the nomination of Neal\r\nDow and Henry Adams Thompson.\r\n\r\nLast of all was the Democratic convention, which nominated General\r\nWinfield S. Hancock and William H. English. The platform called for\r\n\r\n1. Honest money, consisting of gold and silver and paper convertible\r\ninto coin on demand.\r\n\r\n2. A tariff for revenue only.\r\n\r\n3. Public lands for actual settlers.\r\n\r\n%537. Election and Death of Garfield.%--The campaign was remarkable\r\nfor several reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Every presidential elector was chosen by popular vote; and every\r\nelectoral vote was counted as it was cast. This was the first\r\npresidential election in our country of which both these statements\r\ncould be made.\r\n\r\n2. For the first time since 1844 there was no agitation of a Southern\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n3. All parties agreed in calling for anti-Chinese legislation.\r\n\r\nGarfield and Arthur were elected, and inaugurated on March 4, 1881. But\r\non July 2, 1881, as Garfield stood in a railway station at Washington, a\r\ndisappointed office seeker came up behind and shot him in the back. A\r\nlong and painful illness followed, till he died on September 19, 1881.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: James A. Garfield]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Chester A. Arthur]\r\n\r\n%538. Presidential Succession%--The death of Garfield and the\r\nsuccession of Arthur to the presidential office left the country in a\r\npeculiar situation. An act of Congress passed in 1792 provided that if\r\nboth the presidency and vice presidency were vacant at the same time,\r\nthe President _pro tempore_ of the Senate, or if there were none, the\r\nSpeaker of the House of Representatives, should act as President, till a\r\nnew one was elected. But in September, 1881, there was neither a\r\nPresident _pro tempore_ of the Senate nor a Speaker of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, as the Forty-sixth Congress ceased to exist on March 4,\r\nand the Forty-seventh was not to meet till December. Had Arthur died or\r\nbeen killed, there would therefore have been no President. It was not\r\nlikely that such a condition would happen again; but attention was\r\ncalled to the necessity of providing for succession to the presidency,\r\nand in 1886 a new law was enacted. Now, should the presidency and vice\r\npresidency both become vacant, the presidency passes to members of the\r\nCabinet in the order of the establishment of their departments,\r\nbeginning with the Secretary of State. Should he die, be impeached and\r\nremoved, or become disabled, it would go to the Secretary of the\r\nTreasury, and then, if necessary, to the Secretary of War, the\r\nAttorney-general, the Postmaster-general, the Secretary of the Navy, the\r\nSecretary of the Interior.\r\n\r\n%539. Party Pledges redeemed.%--Since the Republican party was in\r\npower, a redemption of the pledges in their platform was necessary, and\r\nthree laws of great importance were enacted. One, the Edmunds law\r\n(1882), was intended to suppress polygamy in Utah and the neighboring\r\nterritories. Another (1882) stopped the immigration of Chinese laborers\r\nfor ten years. The third, the Pendleton Civil Service Act (1883), was\r\ndesigned to secure appointment to public office on the ground of\r\nfitness, and not for political service.\r\n\r\n%540. Corporations.%--These measures were all good enough in their\r\nway; but they left untouched grievances which the workingmen and a great\r\npart of the people felt were unbearable. That the development of the\r\nwealth and resources of our country is chiefly due to great corporations\r\nand great capitalists is strictly true. But that many of them abused the\r\npower their wealth gave them cannot be denied. They were accused of\r\nbuying legislatures, securing special privileges, fixing prices to suit\r\nthemselves, importing foreign laborers under contract in order to\r\ndepress wages, and favoring some customers more than others.\r\n\r\n%541. The Anti-monopoly and Labor Parties.%--Out of this condition of\r\naffairs grew the Anti-monopoly party, which held a convention in 1884\r\nand demanded that the Federal government should regulate commerce\r\nbetween the states; that it should therefore control the railroads and\r\nthe telegraphs; that Congress should enact an interstate commerce law;\r\nand that the importation of foreign laborers under contract should be\r\nmade illegal.\r\n\r\nThis platform was so fully in accordance with the views of the Greenback\r\nor National party, that Benjamin F. Butler, the candidate of the\r\nAnti-monopolists, was endorsed and so practically united the\r\ntwo parties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Grover Cleveland]\r\n\r\n%542. The Republican and Democratic Parties%.--The Republicans\r\nnominated James G. Blaine and John A. Logan, and the Democrats Stephen\r\nGrover Cleveland and Thomas A. Hendricks. The Prohibitionists put up\r\nJohn P. St. John and William Daniel. The nomination of Blaine was the\r\nsignal for the revolt of a wing of the Republicans, which took the name\r\nof Independents, and received the nickname of "Mugwumps." The revolt was\r\nserious in its consequences, and after the most exciting contest since\r\n1876, Cleveland was elected.\r\n\r\n%543. Public Measures adopted during 1885-1889.%--Widely as the\r\nparties differed on many questions, Democrats, Republicans, and\r\nNationalists agreed in demanding certain reform measures which were now\r\ncarried out. In 1885 an Anti-Contract-Labor law was enacted, forbidding\r\nany person, company, or corporation to bring any aliens into the United\r\nStates under contract to perform labor or service. In 1887 came the\r\nInterstate Commerce Act, placing the railroads under the supervision of\r\ncommissioners whose duty it is to see that all charges for the\r\ntransportation of passengers and freight are "reasonable and just," and\r\nthat no special rates, rebates, drawbacks, or unjust discriminations are\r\nmade for one shipper over another. In 1888 a second Chinese Exclusion\r\nAct prohibited the return of any Chinese laborer who had once left the\r\ncountry. That same year a Department of Labor was established and put in\r\ncharge of a commissioner. His duty is to "diffuse among the people of\r\nthe United States useful information on subjects connected with labor."\r\n\r\n%544. Political Issues since 1888%.--Thus by the end of Mr.\r\nCleveland\'s first term many of the demands of the workingmen had been\r\ngranted, and laws enacted for their relief. These issues disposed of, a\r\nnew set arose, and after 1888 financial questions took the place of\r\nlabor issues.\r\n\r\n%545. The Surplus and the Tariff.%--These financial problems were\r\nbrought up by the condition of the public debt. For twenty years past\r\nthe debt had been rapidly growing less and less, till on December 1,\r\n1887, it was $1,665,000,000, a reduction of more than $1,100,000,000 in\r\ntwenty-one years. By that time every bond of the United States that\r\ncould be called in and paid at its face value had been canceled. As all\r\nthe other bonds fell due, some in 1891 and others in 1907, the\r\ngovernment must either buy them at high rates, or suffer them to run. If\r\nit suffered them to run, a great surplus would pile up in the Treasury.\r\nThus on December 1, 1887, after every possible debt of the government\r\nwas met, there was a surplus of $50,000,000. Six months later (June 1,\r\n1888) the sum had increased to $103,000,000.\r\n\r\nUnless this was to go on, and the money of the country be locked up in\r\nthe Treasury, one of three things must be done:\r\n\r\n1. More bonds must be bought at high rates.\r\n\r\n2. Or the revenue must be reduced by reducing taxation.\r\n\r\n3. Or the surplus must be distributed among the states as in 1837, or\r\nspent.\r\n\r\n%546. The Mills Tariff Bill.%--Each plan had its advocates. But the\r\nDemocrats, who controlled the House of Representatives, attempted to\r\nsolve the problem by cutting down the revenue, and passed a tariff bill,\r\ncalled the Mills Bill, after its chief author, Mr. R. Q. Mills of Texas.\r\nThe Republicans declared it was a free-trade measure and defeated it in\r\nthe Senate.\r\n\r\n%547. The Campaign of 1888; Benjamin Harrison, Twenty-third\r\nPresident.%--In the party platforms of 1888 we find, therefore, that\r\nthree issues are prominent: (1) taxation, (2) tariff reform, (3) the\r\nsurplus. The Democrats nominated Grover Cleveland and Allen G. Thurman,\r\nand demanded frugality in public expenses, no more revenue than was\r\nneeded to pay the necessary cost of government, and a tariff for revenue\r\nonly. The Republicans nominated Benjamin Harrison and Levi P. Morton,\r\nand demanded a tariff for protection, a reduction of the revenue by the\r\nrepeal of taxes on tobacco and on spirits used in the arts, and by the\r\nadmission free of duty of foreign-made articles the like of which are\r\nnot produced at home.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Benjamin Harrison]\r\n\r\nThe Prohibitionists, the Union Labor party, and the United Labor party\r\nalso placed candidates in the field. Harrison and Morton were elected,\r\nand inaugurated March 4, 1889.\r\n\r\n%548. The Republicans in Control.%--The Republican party not only\r\nregained the presidency, but was once more in control of the House and\r\nSenate. Thus free to carry out its pledges, it passed the McKinley\r\nTariff Act (1890); a new pension bill, which raised the number of\r\npensioners to 970,000, and the sum annually spent on pensions from\r\n$106,000,000 to $150,000,000; and a new financial measure, known as\r\n\r\n%549. The Sherman Act.%--You remember that the attempt to enact a law\r\nfor the free coinage of silver in 1878 led to the Bland-Allison Act, for\r\nthe purchase of bullion and the coinage of at least $2,000,000 worth of\r\nsilver each month. As this was not free coinage, the friends of silver\r\nmade a second attempt, in 1886, to secure the desired legislation. This\r\nalso failed. But in the summer of 1890, the silver men, having a\r\nmajority of the Senate, passed a free-coinage bill (June 17), which the\r\nHouse rejected (June 25). A conference followed, and from this\r\nconference came a bill which was quickly enacted into a law and called\r\nthe Sherman Act. It provided\r\n\r\n1. That the Secretary of the Treasury should buy 4,500,000 ounces of\r\nsilver each month.\r\n\r\n2. That he should pay for the bullion with paper money called treasury\r\nnotes.\r\n\r\n3. That on demand of the holder the Secretary must redeem these notes in\r\ngold or silver.\r\n\r\n4. After July 1, 1891, the silver need not be coined, but might be\r\nstored in the Treasury, and silver certificates issued.\r\n\r\n%550. The Farmers\' Alliance%.--This legislation, combined with an\r\nagricultural depression and widespread discontent in the agricultural\r\nstates, caused the defeat of the Republicans in the elections of 1890.\r\nThe Democratic minority of 21 in the House of Representatives of the\r\nFifty-first Congress was turned into a Democratic majority of 135 in the\r\nFifty-second. Eight other members were elected by the Farmers\' Alliance.\r\n\r\nFor twenty years past the farmers in every great agricultural state had\r\nbeen organizing, under such names as Patrons of Husbandry, Farmers\'\r\nLeague, the Grange, Patrons of Industry, Agricultural Wheel, Farmers\'\r\nAlliance. Their object was to promote sociability, spread information\r\nconcerning agriculture and the price of grain and cattle, and guard the\r\ninterests and welfare of the farmer generally. By 1886 many of these\r\nbegan to unite, and the National Agricultural Wheel of the United\r\nStates, the Farmers\' Alliance and Cooperative Union of America, and\r\nseveral more came into existence. In 1889 the amalgamation was carried\r\nfurther still, and at a convention in St. Louis they were all\r\npractically united in the Farmers\' Alliance and Industrial Union.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this alliance was political, and as its stronghold was\r\nKansas, the contest began in that state in 1890. At a convention of\r\nAlliance men and Knights of Labor, a "People\'s Party" was formed, which\r\nelected a majority of the state legislature. Five out of seven\r\nCongressmen were secured, and one United States senator. Before Congress\r\nmet (in December, 1891), another member of the House was elected\r\nelsewhere, and three more senators. The support of fifty other\r\nrepresentatives was claimed. Greatly elated over this important footing,\r\nthe Alliance men marked out a plan for congressional legislation.\r\nThey demanded\r\n\r\n1. A bill for the free and unlimited coinage of silver.\r\n\r\n2. The subtreasury scheme.\r\n\r\n3. A Land Mortgage Bill.\r\n\r\n%551. The Subtreasury Plan of the Alliance Party.%--The idea at the\r\nbase of these demands was that the amount of money in circulation must\r\nbe increased, and loaned to the people without the aid of banks or\r\ncapitalists. It was proposed, therefore, that the government should\r\nestablish a number of subtreasury or money-loaning stations in each\r\nstate, at which the farmers could borrow money from the government (at\r\ntwo per cent interest), giving as security non-perishable farm produce.\r\n\r\n%552. The Land Mortgage Scheme% provided that any owner of from 10 to\r\n320 acres of land, at least half of which was under cultivation, might\r\nborrow from the government treasury notes equal to half the assessed\r\nvalue of the land and buildings.\r\n\r\n%553. The People\'s Party organized.%--That either of the old parties\r\nwould further such schemes was far from likely. A cry was therefore\r\nraised by the most ardent Alliance men for a third party, and at a\r\nconference of Alliance and Labor leaders in May, 1891, a new national\r\nparty was founded, and named "The People\'s Party of the United States\r\nof America."\r\n\r\n%554. Party Candidates in 1892.%--When the campaign opened in 1892\r\nthere were thus four parties in the field. The People\'s party nominated\r\nJames B. Weaver and James G. Field. The platform called for\r\n\r\n1. The free and unlimited coinage of silver and gold at the ratio of 16\r\nto 1.\r\n\r\n2. A graduated income tax.\r\n\r\n3. Government ownership of railroads, telegraphs, and telephones.\r\n\r\n4. The restriction of immigration.\r\n\r\n5. A national currency to be loaned to the people at two per cent\r\ninterest per annum, secured by land or produce.\r\n\r\n6. All land held by aliens, or by railroads in excess of their actual\r\nneeds, to be reclaimed and held for actual settlers.\r\n\r\nThe Prohibitionists nominated John Bidwell and J. B. Cranfill, and\r\ndeclared "anew for the entire suppression of the manufacture, sale,\r\nimportation, exportation, and transportation of alcoholic liquors as a\r\nbeverage."\r\n\r\nThe Democratic party selected Grover Cleveland for the third time and\r\nchose Adlai E. Stevenson for Vice President. The platform condemned\r\ntrusts and combines, advocated the reclamation of the public lands from\r\ncorporations and syndicates, the exclusion of the Chinese and of the\r\ncriminals and paupers of Europe, denounced "the Sherman Act of 1890,"\r\nand called for "the coinage of both gold and silver without\r\ndiscriminating against either metal or charge for mintage," with "the\r\ndollar unit of coinage of both metals" "of equal intrinsic and\r\nexchangeable value."\r\n\r\nThe Republicans nominated Benjamin Harrison and Whitelaw Reid, expressed\r\ntheir sympathy with the cause of temperance, their opposition to trusts,\r\nand called for the coinage of both gold and silver in such way that "the\r\ndebt-paying power of the dollar, whether silver, gold, or paper, shall\r\nbe at all times equal."\r\n\r\n%555. Grover Cleveland re\xc3\xablected.%--The election was a complete\r\ntriumph for the Democratic party. Mr. Cleveland was again elected, and\r\nfor the first time since 1861 the House, Senate, and President were all\r\nthree Democratic.\r\n\r\nMr. Cleveland was inaugurated March 4,1893. Never in its history had the\r\ncountry been seemingly more prosperous; the crops were bountiful;\r\nbusiness was flourishing, manufactures were thriving. But the prosperity\r\nwas not real. Business was inflated, and during the following summer an\r\nindustrial and financial panic which had long been brewing swept over\r\nthe business world, wrecking banks and destroying industrial and\r\ncommercial establishments.\r\n\r\nTo understand what now happened, two facts must be remembered:\r\n\r\n1. Under the Resumption of Specie Payment Act of 1875, the Secretary of\r\nthe Treasury was authorized to buy specie by the issue of bonds and keep\r\nit to redeem United States notes.\r\n\r\n2. In May, 1878, it was ordered that when a greenback was redeemed in\r\nspecie, it should "not be retired, canceled, or destroyed, but shall be\r\nreissued and paid out again and kept in circulation." There were then\r\n$346,681,000 in greenbacks unredeemed.\r\n\r\n%556. The Gold Reserve.%--Meantime, under the law of 1875, and before\r\nJanuary 1, 1879, the secretary issued $95,500,000 in bonds, the proceeds\r\nof which, with other gold then in the Treasury, made a fund deemed\r\nsufficient to redeem such notes as were likely to be presented. This has\r\nsince been called our gold reserve, and has been fixed by the\r\nsecretaries at $100,000,000. January 1, 1879, the reserve was\r\n$114,000,000, and though it often rose and fell, it never went below\r\nthat amount till July, 1892. By that time there were other gold\r\nobligations. The silver purchased under the law of 1890 was paid for\r\nwith notes exchangeable for "coin"; but as the secretaries always\r\nconstrued "coin" to mean gold, and as by 1893 these notes amounted to\r\n$150,000,000, our gold obligations--that is, notes exchangeable for\r\ngold--were nearly $500,000,000 (greenbacks, $346,000,000; silver\r\npurchase notes, $150,000,000). This immense and steadily increasing sum\r\ncaused a doubt of our ability to pay in gold, and a fear that we might\r\nbe forced to pay in silver. Now silver, since 1873, had fallen steadily\r\nin value from $1.30 an ounce to $0.81 an ounce in 1893, so that the\r\nbullion value of a silver dollar was about 67 cents. The fear, then,\r\nthat our debts might be paid in silver (1) led foreigners to cease\r\ninvesting money in this country, and to send our stocks and bonds home\r\nto be sold, and (2) led people in this country to draw gold out of the\r\nbanks and the Treasury and hoard it, so that in April, 1893, the gold\r\nreserve, for the first time since it was created, fell below\r\n$100,000,000 (to $97,000,000).\r\n\r\n%557. The Panic of 1893.%--Business depression and "tight money"\r\nfollowed. Over three hundred banks suspended or failed, manufactories\r\nall over the country shut down, and a period of great distress set in.\r\nPeople, alarmed at the condition of the banks, began to draw their\r\ndeposits and hoard them, thereby causing such a scarcity of bills of\r\nsmall denominations that a "currency famine" was threatened.\r\n\r\n%558. The Purchase of Silver stopped.%--Believing that the fear that\r\nwe should soon be "on a silver basis" had much to do with this state of\r\naffairs, and that the compulsory purchase of silver each month had much\r\nto do with the fear, the President assembled Congress in special\r\nsession, August 7, and asked for the repeal of that clause of the\r\nSherman Act of 1890 which required a monthly purchase of silver. After a\r\nstruggle in which both of the old parties were split, the compulsory\r\npurchase clause was repealed, November 1, 1893.\r\n\r\n%559. The Silver Movement.%--The steady fall in the bullion value of\r\nsilver was a serious blow to the prosperity of the great\r\nsilver-producing states,--Colorado, Montana, Idaho, South Dakota,\r\nWyoming, Nevada, Utah, and the territories of Arizona and New\r\nMexico,--where silver mining was "the very heart from which every other\r\nindustry receives support." In Colorado alone 15,000 miners were made\r\nidle. To the people of this section, some 2,000,000 in number, the\r\nsilver question was of vital importance; and, alarmed at the call for\r\nthe special session of Congress and the possible repeal of the\r\nsilver-purchase clause, they held a convention at Denver, with a view to\r\naffecting public sentiment. A few weeks after, the National Bimetallic\r\nLeague met at Chicago. Both opposed the repeal, and demanded that if the\r\ngovernment ceased to buy silver, the mints should be opened to free\r\ncoinage. This the friends of silver in the Senate attempted in vain to\r\nbring about.\r\n\r\n%560. The Industrial Depression; the Wilson Bill.%--The industrial\r\nrevival which it was hoped would follow the repeal of the\r\nsilver-purchase law did not take place. Prices did not rise; failures\r\ncontinued; the long-silent mills did not reopen; gold continued to leave\r\nthe country, imports fell off, and, when the year ended, the receipts of\r\nthe government were $34,000,000 behind the expenditures. With this\r\ncondition of the Treasury facing it, Congress met in December, 1893. The\r\nDemocrats were in control, and pledged to revise the tariff; and true to\r\nthe pledge, William L. Wilson of West Virginia, Chairman of the House\r\nCommittee on Ways and Means, presented a new tariff bill (the Wilson\r\nBill) which after prolonged debate passed both Houses and became a law\r\nat midnight, August 27, 1894, without the President\'s signature. As it\r\nwas expected that the revenue yielded would not be sufficient to meet\r\nthe expenses of government, one section of the law provided for a tax of\r\ntwo per cent on all incomes above $4000. This the Supreme Court\r\nafterwards declared unconstitutional.\r\n\r\n%561. The Bond Issues.%--We have seen that in April, 1893, the gold\r\nreserve fell to $97,000,000. But it did not stop there; for, the\r\nbusiness depression and the demand for the free and unlimited coinage of\r\nsilver continuing, the withdrawal of gold went on, till the reserve was\r\nso low that bonds were repeatedly sold for gold wherewith to maintain\r\nit. In this wise, during 1894-95, $262,000,000 were added to our\r\nbonded debt.\r\n\r\n%562. Foreign Relations; the Hawaiian Revolution.%--when Cleveland\r\ntook office, a treaty providing for the annexation of the Hawaiian\r\nIslands was pending in the Senate. In January, 1983, these islands were\r\nthe scene of a revolution, which deposed the Queen and set up a\r\n"provisional government." Commissioners were then dispatched to\r\nWashington, where a treaty of annexation was negotiated and (February\r\n15) sent to the Senate for approval. In the course of the revolution, a\r\nforce of men from the United States steamer _Boston_ was landed at the\r\nrequest of the revolutionary leaders, and our flag was raised over some\r\nof the buildings. When these facts became known, the President, fearing\r\nthat the presence of United States marines might have contributed much\r\nto the success of the revolution, recalled the treaty from the Senate,\r\nand sent an agent to the islands to investigate. His report set forth in\r\nsubstance that the revolution would never have taken place had it not\r\nbeen for the presence and aid of United States marines, and that the\r\nQueen had practically been deposed by United States officials. A new\r\nminister was thereupon sent, with instructions to announce that the\r\ntreaty of annexation would not be confirmed, and to seek for the\r\nrestoration of the Queen on certain conditions. But President Dole of\r\nthe Hawaiian republic denied the right of Cleveland to impose\r\nconditions, or in any way interfere in the domestic concerns of Hawaii,\r\nand refused to surrender to the Queen.\r\n\r\n%563. The Venezuelan Boundary Dispute.%--During 1895, the boundary\r\ndispute which had been dragging on for more than half a century between\r\nGreat Britain and Venezuela, reached what the President called "an acute\r\nstage," and made necessary a statement of the position of the United\r\nStates under the Monroe Doctrine. Great Britain was therefore informed\r\n"that the established policy of the United States is against a forcible\r\nincrease of any territory of a European power" in the New World, and\r\n"that the United States is bound to protest against the enlargement of\r\nthe area of British Guiana against the will of Venezuela"; and she was\r\ninvited to submit her claims to arbitration. Her answer was that the\r\nMonroe Doctrine was "inapplicable to the state of things in which we\r\nlive at the present day" and a refusal to submit her claims to\r\narbitration. The President then asked and received authority to appoint\r\na commission to examine the boundary and report. "When such report is\r\nmade and accepted," said Cleveland, "it will in my opinion be the duty\r\nof the United States to resist by every means in its power, as a willful\r\naggression upon its rights and interests, the appropriation by Great\r\nBritain of any lands, or the exercise of any governmental jurisdiction,\r\nover any territory which after investigation we have determined of right\r\nbelongs to Venezuela." For a time the excitement this message aroused in\r\nGreat Britain and our own country was extreme. But it soon subsided, and\r\non February 2, 1897, a treaty of arbitration was signed at Washington\r\nbetween Great Britain and Venezuela.\r\n\r\n%564. The Election of 1896%.--By that time the presidential election\r\nwas over. When in the spring the time came to choose delegates to the\r\nparty nominating conventions, the drift of public sentiment was so\r\nstrong against the administration, that it seemed certain that the\r\nRepublicans would "sweep the country." Little interest, therefore, was\r\ntaken by the Democrats, while the Republicans were most concerned in the\r\nquestion whether Mr. McKinley or Mr. Reed should be their presidential\r\ncandidate. But as delegates were chosen by the Democrats in the Western\r\nand Southern States, it became certain that the issue was to be the free\r\nand unlimited coinage of silver and gold at the ratio of 16 to 1.\r\n\r\nThe Republican convention met in June, nominated William McKinley and\r\nGarret A Hobart, and declared the party "opposed to the free coinage of\r\nsilver except by international agreement," whereupon thirty-four\r\ndelegates representing the silver states (Colorado, Idaho, Montana,\r\nNevada, South Dakota, and Utah) seceded from the party. The Democratic\r\nconvention assembled early in July, and after a most exciting convention\r\nchose William J. Bryan and Arthur Sewall, and declared for "the free and\r\nunlimited coinage of both silver and gold at the present legal ration of\r\n16 to 1, without waiting for the aid and consent of any other nation." A\r\ngreat defection followed this declaration, scores of newspapers refused\r\nto support the candidates, and in September a convention of "gold\r\nDemocrats," taking the name of the National Democratic party, nominated\r\nJohn M. Palmer and Simon B. Buckner, on a "gold standard" platform.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Prohibitionists, the National party (declaring for woman\r\nsuffrage, prohibition, government ownership of railroads and telegraphs,\r\nan income tax, and the election of the President, Vice President, and\r\nsenators by direct vote of the people), the Socialist Labor party, the\r\nSilver party, and the Populists, had all put candidates in the field.\r\nThe Silver party indorsed Bryan and Sewall; the Populists nominated\r\nBryan and Thomas E. Watson.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: William McKinley]\r\n\r\n%565. McKinley, President.%--An "educational campaign" was carried on\r\nwith a seriousness never before approached in our history, and resulted\r\nin the election of Mr. McKinley. He was inaugurated on March 4, and\r\nimmediately called a special session of Congress to revise the tariff, a\r\nwork which ended in the enactment of the "Dingley Tariff," on July\r\n24, 1897.\r\n\r\n%566. The Cuban Question.%--Absorbing as were the election and the\r\ntariff, there was another matter, which for two years past had steadily\r\ngrown more and more serious. In February, 1895, the natives of Cuba for\r\nthe sixth time in fifty years rebelled against the misrule of Spain and\r\nfounded a republic. A cruel, bloody, and ruinous war followed, and as it\r\nprogressed, deeply interested the people of our country. The island lay\r\nat our very doors. Upwards of $50,000,000 of American money were\r\ninvested in mines, railroads, and plantations there. Our yearly trade\r\nwith Cuba was valued at $96,000,000. Our ports were used by Cubans in\r\nfitting out military expeditions, which the government was forced to\r\nstop at great expense.\r\n\r\n%567. Shall Cuba be given Belligerent Rights?%--These matters were\r\nserious, and when to them was added the sympathy we always feel for any\r\npeople struggling for the liberty we enjoy, there seemed to be ample\r\nreason for our insisting that Spain should govern Cuba better or set her\r\nfree. Some thought we should buy Cuba; some that we should recognize the\r\nRepublic of Cuba; others that we should intervene even at the risk of\r\nwar. Thus urged on, Congress in 1896 declared that the Cubans were\r\nentitled to belligerent rights in our ports, and asked the President to\r\nendeavor to persuade Spain to recognize the independence of Cuba; and\r\nthe House in 1897 recommended that the independence of Cuba be\r\nrecognized. But nothing came of either recommendation, and so the matter\r\nstood when McKinley was inaugurated.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1897 matters grew worse. A large part of the island\r\nbecame a wilderness. The people who had been driven into the towns by\r\norder of Captain General Weyler, the "reconcentrados," were dying of\r\nstarvation, and our countrymen, deeply moved at their suffering, began\r\nto send them food and medical aid.\r\n\r\n%568. The Maine destroyed.%--While engaged in this humane work they were\r\nhorrified to hear that on the night of February 15, 1898, our battleship\r\n_Maine_ was blown up in the harbor of Havana, and 260 of her sailors\r\nkilled. Although our Court of Inquiry was unable to fix the\r\nresponsibility for the explosion, many people believed that it had been\r\nperpetrated by Spaniards, and the hope of a peaceable settlement of the\r\nCuban question rapidly waned. The sum of $50,000,000 was voted to the\r\nPresident for strengthening our defenses and buying ships and munitions\r\nof war. After declining to recognize the Cuban Republic, Congress\r\nadopted a resolution, on April 19, declaring for the freedom of Cuba,\r\ndemanding that Spain should withdraw from the island, and authorizing\r\nthe President to compel her withdrawal, if necessary, by means of our\r\narmy and navy. Spain severed diplomatic relations with us on April 21,\r\nand the war began on that date, as declared by an Act of Congress a few\r\ndays later. Two hundred thousand volunteers were quickly enlisted, out\r\nof the much larger number that wished to serve.\r\n\r\n%569. War with Spain.%--The Battle of Manila.--While one fleet which\r\nhad long been gathering at Key West went off and blockaded Havana and\r\nother parts of the coast of Cuba, another, under Commodore George\r\nDewey, sailed from Hong-kong to attack the Spanish fleet at the\r\nPhilippine Islands. Dewey found it in the Bay of Manila, where, on May\r\n1, 1898, he fought and won the most brilliant naval battle in the\r\nworld\'s history. Passing the forts at the entrance, he entered the bay,\r\nand, without the loss of a man or a ship, he destroyed the entire\r\nSpanish fleet of ten vessels, killed and wounded over 600 men, and\r\ncaptured the arsenal at Cavit\xc3\xa9 (cah-ve-ta\') and the forts at the\r\nentrance to the bay. The city of Manila was then blockaded by Dewey\'s\r\nfleet, and General Merritt with 20,000 troops was sent across the\r\nPacific to take possession of the Philippines, which had long been\r\nSpain\'s most important possession in the East. For his great victory\r\nDewey received the thanks of Congress and was promoted to be\r\nRear-Admiral, and later was given for life the full rank of Admiral.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Admiral Dewey]\r\n\r\n[Illustration Rear-Admiral Sampson]\r\n\r\n%570. The Destruction of Cervera\'s Fleet--Capture of\r\nSantiago.%--Meantime a second Spanish fleet, under Admiral Cervera,\r\nsailed from the Cape Verde Islands. Acting Rear-Admiral Sampson, with\r\nships which had been blockading Havana, and Commodore Schley, with a\r\nFlying Squadron, went in search of Cervera, and after a long hunt he was\r\nfound in the harbor of Santiago de Cuba (sahn-te-ah\'go da coo\'bah),\r\nwhich was promptly blockaded by the ships of both squadrons, with\r\nSampson in command. The narrow entrance to the harbor was so well\r\ndefended by forts and submarine mines that a direct attack on Cervera\r\nwas impossible. In an attempt to complete the blockade, Naval\r\nConstructor R. P. Hobson and a volunteer crew of seven men took the\r\ncollier _Merrimac_ to the harbor entrance, and, amid a rain of shot and\r\nshell, sank her in the channel (June 3). The gallant little band escaped\r\nwith life, but were made prisoners of war, and in time were exchanged.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: General Shafter]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Rear-Admiral Schley]\r\n\r\nThe capture of Santiago was decided upon when Cervera sought refuge in\r\nits harbor, and about 18,000 men (mostly of the regular army), under\r\nGeneral Shafter, were hurried to Cuba and landed a few miles from the\r\ncity. On July 1 the enemy\'s outer line of defenses were taken, after\r\nsevere fighting at El Caney (ca-na\') and San Juan (sahn hoo-ahn\'); and\r\non the next day the Spaniards failed in an attempt to retake them. So\r\ncertain was it that the city must soon surrender, that Cervera was\r\nordered to dash from the harbor, break through the American fleet, and\r\nput to sea. On Sunday morning, July 3, the attempt was made; a desperate\r\nsea fight followed, and, in a few hours, all six of the Spanish vessels\r\nwere sunk or stranded, shattered wrecks, on the coast of Cuba. The\r\nSpanish loss in killed and wounded was heavy, while Admiral Cervera and\r\nabout 1800 of his men were taken prisoners. Not one of our vessels was\r\nseriously damaged, and but one of our men was killed. When the battle\r\nbegan, the American war ships were in their usual positions before the\r\nharbor, as assigned them by Admiral Sampson; but Sampson himself, in his\r\nflagship, was several miles to the east on his way to a conference with\r\nGeneral Shafter. Commodore Schley\'s flagship, the _Brooklyn_, was at the\r\nwest end of the line, and as the enemy tried to escape in that\r\ndirection, she was in the thickest of the fight. Another war ship which\r\nespecially distinguished herself was the _Oregon_, a Western-built\r\nship, which had sailed from San Francisco all the way around Cape Horn\r\nin order to reach the seat of war.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: General Miles]\r\n\r\nAfter the naval battle of July 3, all hope of successful resistance by\r\nthe Spaniards vanished, and on July 17, General Toral surrendered\r\nSantiago, the eastern end of Cuba, and an army of nearly 25,000 men. A\r\nweek later General Miles set off to seize the island of Porto Rico. He\r\nlanded on the southern coast, and had occupied much of the island when\r\nhostilities came to an end.\r\n\r\n571. Peace.--On August 12, 1898, a protocol was signed by\r\nrepresentatives of the two nations, providing for the immediate\r\ncessation of hostilities, the withdrawal of Spain from the West Indies,\r\nand the occupation of Manila by the United States till the conclusion of\r\na treaty of peace, which was to be negotiated by a commission meeting in\r\nParis, and which was to provide for the disposition of the Philippines.\r\n\r\nNews of the cessation of hostilities was instantly sent to all our\r\nfleets and armies. But, on August 13, before word could reach the\r\nPhilippines, Manila was attacked by General Merritt\'s army and Dewey\'s\r\nfleet, whereupon the Spanish general surrendered the city and about\r\n7000 soldiers.\r\n\r\nA formal treaty of peace was signed at Paris December 10, 1898,\r\nproviding that Spain should relinquish her title to Cuba, and cede Porto\r\nRico, Guam (one of the Ladrones), and the Philippines to the United\r\nStates; and that the United States should pay $20,000,000 to Spain. The\r\ntreaty was then submitted to the governments of the United States and\r\nSpain for ratification; but in both countries it met some opposition. In\r\nour country objections were made especially to the taking of the\r\nPhilippines without the consent of their inhabitants, many of whom,\r\nunder the leadership of Aguinaldo, had previously rebelled against Spain\r\nand were now demanding complete independence; but the prevailing view\r\nwas that our immediate control was necessary to prevent civil war,\r\nanarchy, and foreign complications there. Accordingly, on February 6,\r\n1899, the treaty was ratified by the Senate by a vote of 57 to 27. Spain\r\nalso accepted the treaty, which was formally proclaimed April 11. The\r\n$20,000,000 was promptly paid to Spain, and ordinary diplomatic\r\nrelations were resumed.\r\n\r\n%572. The War Bonds and War Taxes.%--For the expenses of the war with\r\nSpain Congress made ample provision. The Secretary of the Treasury was\r\nauthorized to issue $400,000,000 in 3 per cent bonds,[1] and borrow\r\n$100,000,000 upon temporary certificates of indebtedness. Stamp taxes,\r\nan inheritance tax, and a duty on tea were laid, and the silver in the\r\nTreasury was ordered to be coined at the rate of $1,500,000 a month.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: $200,000,000 of the war bonds were offered for popular\r\nsubscription, and $109,000,000 were subscribed in sums under $500. All\r\nwas taken in sums under $5000.]\r\n\r\n%573. Hawaii annexed.%--But in few respects was the effect of the war\r\nso marked as in the changed sentiment of the people toward Hawaii.\r\nDuring five years the little republic had been steadily seeking\r\nannexation to the United States, and seeking in vain. But with the\r\npartial occupation of the Philippines, and the impending acquisition of\r\nPorto Rico, and perhaps Cuba, the policy of territorial expansion lost\r\nmany of its terrors, and the Hawaiian Islands were annexed by joint\r\nresolution of Congress, signed by the President July 7, 1898. The formal\r\ntransfer of sovereignty took place August 12. The islands continued\r\ntemporarily under their existing form of government, with slight\r\nmodifications, till June 14, 1900, when they were organized as a\r\nterritory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (World Map)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: General Otis]\r\n\r\n%574. The War in the Philippines.%--While the treaty with Spain was\r\nunder consideration, the city of Manila was held by General Otis,\r\nMerritt\'s successor; but native troops, under Aguinaldo, were in control\r\nof most of Luzon and several other islands. On the night of February 4,\r\n1899, the long-threatened conflict between them was begun by Aguinaldo\'s\r\nunsuccessful attack on the Americans at Manila. War now followed; but in\r\nbattle after battle the natives were beaten and scattered, till by the\r\nbeginning of the year 1900 the main army of the Filipinos had been\r\ncompletely broken up, and the only forces still opposing American\r\nauthority were small bodies of bandits and guerrillas. These held out\r\npersistently, and continued the warfare for more than a year. In 1900\r\nthe President sent a commission to the Philippines to organize civil\r\ngovernment in such localities and in such degree as it should deem\r\nadvisable; and in 1902 Congress enacted a plan of government under which\r\nthe Philippines are constituted a partly self-governing dependency.\r\n\r\n%575. Porto Rico and Cuba.%--After the close of the Spanish war, both\r\nPorto Rico and Cuba remained under the military control of the United\r\nStates for many months. For Porto Rico, which had been ceded to our\r\ncountry, Congress provided a system of civil government which went into\r\neffect May 1, 1900. This organized Porto Rico as a dependency.\r\n\r\nCuba, however, had not been ceded to the United States. It had passed\r\nunder our control only for the restoration of peace and the\r\nestablishment of a stable government there; for Congress, in its\r\nresolution of April 19, 1898, asserted its determination, after the\r\npacification of Cuba, "to leave the government and control of the island\r\nto its people." In June, 1900, the local city governments were turned\r\nover to municipal officers that had been elected by the people. In the\r\nfollowing winter a constitution was framed by a convention of delegates\r\nelected by the Cubans. Then, after certain provisions had been added to\r\nthis, to govern the future relations between Cuba and the United States,\r\nand after the first officers of the Cuban Republic had been elected, the\r\nUnited States troops were withdrawn and the new government took charge\r\nof the island, May 20, 1902.\r\n\r\n%576. Disorders in China.%--Early in 1900 a patriotic society of\r\nChinese, called the Boxers, began to massacre native Christians in the\r\nnorth of China, and to drive out or kill all missionaries and other\r\nforeigners. The disorder soon spread to Pekin, where the foreign\r\nministers and their countrymen (including some Americans) were besieged\r\nin their quarter of the city by Boxers and regular Chinese troops; for\r\nthe Chinese government, instead of suppressing the Boxers, acted in\r\nsympathy with them.\r\n\r\nPresident McKinley sent warships and soldiers to China, where they\r\nco\xc3\xb6perated with the forces of Japan and the European powers in rescuing\r\nthe imperiled foreigners in Pekin. War was not declared against China,\r\nthough she resisted the invading troops, making it necessary for them to\r\ncapture several towns and to fight several battles before Pekin was\r\ntaken. A treaty was then negotiated with the United States, Japan, and\r\nthe European powers, providing for the restoration of order and a\r\nsettlement of the various claims against China.\r\n\r\n%577%. At home during 1900 our population was counted; a President\r\nwas elected; and a currency law of much importance was enacted. In the\r\nUnited States and the territories there were found to be about\r\n76,000,000 people, and in the one state of New York more inhabitants\r\nthan there were in all the United States in 1810.\r\n\r\nBy the currency law, known as the Gold Standard Act, it is provided:--\r\n\r\n1. That the gold dollar shall be the standard unit of value.\r\n\r\n2. That all forms of money issued or coined shall be kept "at a parity\r\nof value" with this gold standard.\r\n\r\n3. That United States notes and Treasury notes shall be redeemed in gold\r\ncoin. For this purpose $150,000,000 of gold coin or bullion is set apart\r\nin the Treasury.\r\n\r\n%578%. When the time came to prepare for the election of a President\r\nand Vice President, eleven conventions were held, as many platforms were\r\nframed, and eight pairs of candidates were nominated. There were the\r\nDemocratic and Republican parties; the People\'s Party (Fusionists) and\r\nthe People\'s Party (Middle of the Road Anti-Fusionists); the\r\nProhibition, United Christian, Silver Republican, Socialist Labor,\r\nSocial Democratic, and National parties; and the Anti-Imperialist\r\nLeague. The things opposed, approved of, or demanded by these parties\r\nwere many and various; but a few should be stated as showing what the\r\npeople were thinking about: Trusts, the gold standard, the free coinage\r\nof silver, a canal across Nicaragua or the isthmus of Panama, election\r\nof United States senators by the people, repeal of the war taxes,\r\nstatehood for the territories, independence for the Filipinos, aid to\r\nAmerican shipping, irrigation of the arid lands in the West, public\r\nownership of railways and telegraphs, desecration of the Sabbath,\r\nequality of men and women, exclusion of the Asiatics, the\r\nMonroe Doctrine.\r\n\r\n%579. McKinley Re\xc3\xablected.%--The Populist (Fusionist) convention\r\nnominated William J. Bryan and Charles A. Towne. But the Democrats named\r\nBryan and Adlai E. Stevenson. Thereupon Towne withdrew, and Bryan and\r\nStevenson were made the candidates of the Populists and the Silver party\r\nas well as of the Democrats. The Democratic platform denounced\r\nimperialism and trusts, and reiterated the demand for the free coinage\r\nof silver at the ratio of 16 to 1. The Republicans renominated\r\nPresident McKinley, and nominated Theodore Roosevelt for Vice President,\r\non a platform indorsing McKinley\'s administration and favoring the gold\r\nstandard of money. McKinley and Roosevelt were elected.\r\n\r\n%580. McKinley Assassinated.% On March 4, 1901, the President began\r\nhis second term, which six months later came to a dreadful end. In May a\r\ngreat fair--the Pan-American Exposition--was opened at Buffalo, and to\r\nthis exposition the President came as a guest early in September, and\r\nwas holding a public reception on the afternoon of the 6th, when an\r\nanarchist who approached as if to shake hands, suddenly shot him twice.\r\nFor several days it was thought that the wounds would not prove fatal;\r\nbut early on the morning of the 14th, the President died, and that\r\nafternoon Mr. Roosevelt took the oath of office required by the\r\nConstitution and became President.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Theodore Roosevelt]\r\n\r\n%581. Public Measures adopted in 1901-1904.%--The events connected\r\nwith our large island possessions had directed much attention to our\r\nmilitary and naval forces. As a result, Congress passed several measures\r\nto increase the efficiency of the army, and appropriated large sums for\r\nadditions to the navy. For the reclamation of the arid parts of the Far\r\nWest an important law was enacted (1902), setting aside the money\r\nreceived from the sales of public land in that part of the country and\r\nappropriating it for the planning and construction of irrigation works.\r\nIn 1903 a ninth member was added to the President\'s cabinet in the\r\nperson of the Secretary of Commerce and Labor. The new department was\r\nmade to include the Department of Labor established fifteen years\r\nbefore, and a number of other bureaus already existing; at the same time\r\nthe Bureau of Corporations was newly established, and was given the\r\npower to investigate the organization and workings of any trust or\r\ncorporation (except railroads) engaged in interstate or foreign\r\ncommerce, and, with the President\'s approval, to publish the\r\ninformation so obtained.\r\n\r\nA long-standing dispute as to the eastern boundary of southern Alaska\r\nwas referred to a British-American tribunal, which decided chiefly in\r\nfavor of the United States (1903). By a reciprocity treaty with Cuba\r\nwhich went into effect in 1904, the duties on Cuban trade were\r\nsomewhat lowered.\r\n\r\n%582. The Isthmian Canal.%--A French company many years ago began to dig\r\na ship canal across the Isthmus of Panama, but it failed through bad\r\nmanagement before the work was half done. A United States commission\r\nmade a survey of this route and also of the Nicaragua route across\r\nCentral America, estimated the cost of building each canal, and gave\r\ncareful consideration to the advantages of each route. The owners of the\r\nFrench canal having offered to sell for $40,000,000, Congress in 1902\r\nauthorized the President to buy and complete it, provided satisfactory\r\ntitle and permanent control of the route could be secured. In all, about\r\n$200,000,000 was provided for this work. In 1903 a treaty was negotiated\r\nwith Colombia, giving the United States a permanent lease of a six-mile\r\nstrip across the isthmus, for an annual rental of $250,000 and the\r\npayment of $10,000,000, but Colombia rejected the treaty. The Colombian\r\nprovince of Panama thereupon seceded (November 3), and its independence\r\nwas recognized by the United States and other nations. A treaty was soon\r\nmade whereby the United States guaranteed the independence of Panama,\r\nand Panama ceded to the United States a ten-mile strip across the\r\nisthmus for the sums rejected by Colombia. The rights of the French\r\ncompany were then bought, and a United States commission began the work\r\nof completing the canal (1904).\r\n\r\n%583. Election of Roosevelt.%--There were almost as many parties as ever\r\nin the campaign of 1904. The Republicans indorsed the existing\r\nadministration, demanded the continuance of the protective tariff and\r\nthe gold standard, and nominated Roosevelt for President and Charles W.\r\nFairbanks for Vice President. The Democrats nominated Alton B. Parker\r\nand Henry G. Davis, and declared for a reduction of the tariff and\r\nagainst militarism and trusts, but were silent on the money question.\r\nRoosevelt and Fairbanks were elected by a large majority.\r\n\r\n%584. Interstate Commerce.%--In spite of the act of 1887 and some\r\nlater laws, favored shippers were still given various unfair advantages\r\nin the service and charges of railroads. In 1906 Congress greatly\r\nenlarged the power of the Interstate Commerce Commission to supervise\r\nrailroads, express companies, and other common carriers operating in\r\nmore than one state, and even authorized it to fix new freight and\r\npassenger rates in place of any it deemed to be unjust or unreasonable.\r\n\r\nBesides this law to regulate interstate transportation, Congress passed\r\nseveral acts to regulate the quality of goods entering into interstate\r\ncommerce. Efficient inspection of meat-packing establishments was\r\nprovided, at a cost of $3,000,000 a year. Adulteration or misbranding of\r\nany foods, drugs, medicines, or liquors manufactured anywhere for sale\r\nin another state, was forbidden under heavy penalties.\r\n\r\n%585. Intervention in Cuba.%--One of the provisions added to the\r\nCuban constitution gave the United States the right to intervene "for\r\nthe maintenance of a government adequate for the protection of life,\r\nproperty, and individual liberty." This right was first exercised in the\r\nautumn of 1906, when the Cuban government failed to suppress an\r\ninsurrection in the island. Efforts were first made, in vain, to bring\r\nabout peace in Cuba without armed intervention; then the Cuban president\r\nresigned, our envoy Secretary Taft proclaimed himself provisional\r\ngovernor of Cuba, United States troops were stationed at various points,\r\nand the insurgents peacefully disbanded. The work of completing the\r\nrestoration of order and confidence, preparatory to the holding of a new\r\nelection under the Cuban constitution, was intrusted by the President to\r\nCharles E. Magoon, who became provisional governor in October.\r\n\r\n%586. The Panic of 1907.%--For several years our country had enjoyed\r\nunusual prosperity. Never had the business of the country been better. A\r\ndistrust of banks and banking institutions, however, was suddenly\r\ndeveloped. Belief that the money of depositors was being used in a\r\nreckless way became widespread, and when a run on some banks in New York\r\ncity forced them to suspend, a panic swept over the country. People\r\neverywhere made haste to withdraw their deposits, and the banks for a\r\ntime were forced to refuse to cash checks for large sums. Business\r\ndepression and hard times followed.\r\n\r\n%587. The Currency Law.%--In the midst of the panic the Sixtieth\r\nCongress met and in the course of its session enacted (for six years) a\r\ncurrency law. This is an emergency measure by which the national banks,\r\nwhen currency is scarce, may issue more under certain conditions. The\r\ntotal amount put out by all the national banks must not be greater than\r\n$500,000,000. Those using this currency must pay a heavy tax, which it\r\nis believed will lead to its prompt recall as soon as the emergency\r\nhas passed.\r\n\r\n%588. Election of Taft.%--For the thirty-first time in our history\r\nelectors of President and Vice President were chosen in 1908. Seven\r\nparties placed candidates in the field. The Republicans nominated\r\nWilliam H. Taft and James S. Sherman; the Democrats named William J.\r\nBryan and John W. Kern. Candidates were also presented by the\r\nProhibition, Populist, Socialist Labor, Socialist, and Independence\r\nparties. In many respects the Republican and Democratic platforms were\r\nalike. Both declared for revision of the tariff, postal savings banks, a\r\nbureau of mines and mining, protection of our citizens abroad, a better\r\ncivil service, improvement of our inland waterways, preservation of our\r\nforests, and the admission of Arizona and New Mexico as separate states.\r\nThe Democratic platform called for an income tax, the publication of the\r\nnames of contributors to national campaign funds, legislation against\r\nprivate monopolies, and full control of interstate railways. Taft and\r\nSherman were elected.\r\n\r\nOne of Taft\'s first acts as President was to call a special session of\r\nCongress, which met March 15 to frame a new tariff act.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: William H. Taft]\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\n1. The political issues before the country since 1880 have been of two\r\ngeneral classes--industrial and financial.\r\n\r\n2. The industrial issues led to the formation of certain great\r\norganizations, as the Farmers\' Alliance, Knights of Labor, Patrons of\r\nIndustry, etc.; and to the enactment of certain important laws, as the\r\nInterstate Commerce Acts, the Anti-Chinese laws, the Anti-Contract Labor\r\nlaw, and the establishment of the Labor Bureau.\r\n\r\n3. The financial issues were in general connected in some way with the\r\nagitation for free coinage of silver.\r\n\r\n4. These issues seriously affected both the old parties and produced\r\nothers, as the Anti-monopoly party, the People\'s party, the Silver\r\nparty, the National, the Socialist.\r\n\r\n5. In 1893 financial questions became so serious that a panic occurred,\r\nwhich forced the repeal of the purchase clause of the Sherman Act. In\r\n1907 there was another panic.\r\n\r\n6. Among our foreign complications during this period were the question\r\nof the annexation of the Hawaiian Islands, the Venezuela boundary\r\ndispute, the Cuban question, which finally involved us in a war with\r\nSpain, and the trouble with China arising from the Boxer outbreak.\r\n\r\n7. The chief events of the war with Spain were Dewey\'s naval victory in\r\nManila Bay, May 1; the battles of El Caney and San Juan, near Santiago,\r\nJuly 1; the naval battle of July 3 off Santiago; the surrender of\r\nSantiago, July 14; the invasion of Porto Rico, near the end of July; and\r\nthe capture of Manila, August 13.\r\n\r\n8. The war resulted in the cession of Porto Rico and the Philippines to\r\nour country, and in Spain\'s withdrawal from Cuba.\r\n\r\n9. The withdrawal of Spain from the Philippines was followed by an\r\nuprising of natives led by Aguinaldo; but the insurrection was soon\r\nsuppressed and a system of civil government established.\r\n\r\n10. By peaceful negotiation a treaty was perfected giving the United\r\nStates control of the route for the Panama Canal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE--1776\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIN CONGRESS, JULY 4, 1776.\r\n\r\nTHE UNANIMOUS DECLARATION OF THE THIRTEEN UNITED STATES OF\r\nAMERICA\r\n\r\nWhen, in the course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people\r\nto dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another,\r\nand to assume, among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal\r\nstation to which the laws of nature and of nature\'s God entitle them, a\r\ndecent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should\r\ndeclare the causes which impel them to the separation.\r\n\r\nWe hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal;\r\nthat they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights;\r\nthat among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. That,\r\nto secure these rights, governments are instituted among men, deriving\r\ntheir just powers from the consent of the governed; that, whenever any\r\nform of government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the right of\r\nthe people to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new government,\r\nlaying its foundation on such principles, and organizing its powers in\r\nsuch form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their safety and\r\nhappiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that governments long\r\nestablished, should not be changed for light and transient causes; and,\r\naccordingly, all experience hath shown, that mankind are more disposed\r\nto suffer, while evils are sufferable, than to right themselves by\r\nabolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But, when a long\r\ntrain of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same object,\r\nevinces a design to reduce them under absolute despotism, it is their\r\nright, it is their duty, to throw off such government, and to provide\r\nnew guards for their future security.--Such has been the patient\r\nsufferance of these colonies; and such is now the necessity which\r\nconstrains them to alter their former systems of government. The history\r\nof the present king of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries\r\nand usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an\r\nabsolute tyranny over these States. To prove this, let facts be\r\nsubmitted to a candid world.\r\n\r\nHe has refused his assent to laws the most wholesome and necessary for\r\nthe public good.\r\n\r\nHe has forbidden his governors to pass laws of immediate and pressing\r\nimportance, unless suspended in their operation till his assent should\r\nbe obtained; and, when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to\r\nattend to them.\r\n\r\nHe has refused to pass other laws for the accommodation of large\r\ndistricts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of\r\nrepresentation in the legislature, a right inestimable to them and\r\nformidable to tyrants only.\r\n\r\nHe has called together legislative bodies at places unusual,\r\nuncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their public records,\r\nfor the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with\r\nhis measures.\r\n\r\nHe has dissolved representative houses repeatedly, for opposing, with\r\nmanly firmness, his invasions on the rights of the people.\r\n\r\nHe has refused, for a long time after such dissolutions, to cause others\r\nto be elected; whereby the legislative powers, incapable of\r\nannihilation, have returned to the people at large for their exercise;\r\nthe State remaining, in the meantime, exposed to all the dangers of\r\ninvasion from without, and convulsions within.\r\n\r\nHe has endeavored to prevent the population of these States; for that\r\npurpose obstructing the laws for naturalization of foreigners; refusing\r\nto pass others to encourage their migration hither, and raising the\r\nconditions of new appropriations of lands.\r\n\r\nHe has obstructed the administration of justice, by refusing his assent\r\nto laws for establishing judiciary powers.\r\n\r\nHe has made judges dependent on his will alone for the tenure of their\r\noffices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.\r\n\r\nHe has erected a multitude of new offices, and sent hither swarms of\r\nofficers to harass our people, and eat out their substance.\r\n\r\nHe has kept among us in times of peace, standing armies, without the\r\nconsent of our legislature.\r\n\r\nHe has affected to render the military independent of, and superior to,\r\nthe civil power.\r\n\r\nHe has combined, with others, to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to\r\nour constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his assent to\r\ntheir acts of pretended legislation:\r\n\r\nFor quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:\r\n\r\nFor protecting them, by a mock trial, from punishment for any murders\r\nwhich they should commit on the inhabitants of these States:\r\n\r\n[Transcriber\'s note: This is an excerpt.

Please see Project Gutenberg\'s\r\ncomplete text.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATE CONSTITUTIONS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen (page 155), that in 1776 the Continental Congress advised\r\nthe people of the colonies to form governments for themselves, and that\r\nthe people of the colonies accordingly adopted constitutions and became\r\nsovereign and independent states. Of the thirteen original state\r\nconstitutions, none save that of Massachusetts is now in force, and even\r\nthat has been amended. Changes in political ideas, changes in the\r\nconditions of life due to the wonderful progress of our country, have\r\nforced the people to alter, amend, and often remake their state\r\nconstitutions.\r\n\r\nAll our state constitutions now in force divide the powers of government\r\namong three departments,--legislative, executive, and judicial.\r\n\r\n_The Legislative Department_--called in some states the Legislature, in\r\nothers the General Assembly, and in still others the General Court--\r\nconsists in every state of two branches or houses, usually known as the\r\nSenate and House of Representatives. In six states the legislature meets\r\nannually, and in all the rest biennially; the members of both branches\r\nare everywhere elected by the people, and serve from one to four years.\r\nIn most states a session of the legislature is limited to a period of\r\nfrom forty to ninety days. The legislature enacts the laws (which must\r\nnot conflict with the Constitution of the United States, the treaties,\r\nthe acts of Congress, or the constitution of the state); but the powers\r\nof the two houses are not equal in all the states. In some the House of\r\nRepresentatives has the sole right to originate bills for the raising\r\nand the expenditure of money, and in some the Senate confirms or rejects\r\nappointments to office made by the Governor.\r\n\r\n_The Governor_ is the executive; is elected for a term of years varying\r\nfrom one to four; and is in duty bound to see that the laws are\r\nenforced. To him, in nearly all the states, are sent the acts of the\r\nlegislature to be signed if he approves, or vetoed if he disapproves. In\r\nsome states the Governor may veto parts or items of an act and approve\r\nthe rest. He is commander in chief of the militia; commissions all\r\nofficers whom he appoints; and in most of the states may pardon\r\ncriminals.\r\n\r\n_The Judicial Branch_ of government is composed of the state courts,\r\nwhose judges are appointed, or elected for a long term of years.\r\n\r\nThese three branches of government--the executive, the legislative, and\r\nthe judicial--are distinct and separate, and none can exercise the\r\npowers of the others. No judge can enact a law; no legislature can try a\r\nsuit; no executive can perform the duties of a judge or a legislature.\r\n\r\nWhen the thirteen colonies threw off their allegiance to the British\r\nCrown, the government set up by each was supreme within the limits of\r\nthe state. Each could coin money, impose duties on goods imported from\r\nabroad or from other states, fix the legal rate of interest, make laws\r\nregulating marriage and divorce and the descent of property, and do\r\nanything else that any supreme government could do.\r\n\r\nBut when the states united in forming a strong general government by\r\nadopting the Constitution, they did not give up all their powers of\r\ngovernment. They intrusted part of them to the Federal government, and\r\nretained the rest as before. In other words, the people of each state,\r\ninstead of continuing to have one government, adopted a double\r\ngovernment, state and Federal, according to the plan laid down in the\r\nConstitution. It is the Federal Constitution that makes the division of\r\npowers between the nation and the separate states. The Constitution, for\r\ninstance, gives the Federal government the powers of coining money and\r\nlaying import duties, and forbids these powers to the states; but the\r\nrate of interest, marriage and divorce, and the descent of property are\r\nmatters not mentioned in the Constitution, and concerning which the\r\nstates retain the power to make laws.\r\n\r\nIn many cases it is hard to decide whether a state has power to do a\r\ncertain thing. Whenever the question turns on the interpretation of the\r\nFederal Constitution, it is decided by the United States courts. The\r\nFederal Constitution and the laws and treaties made in accordance with\r\nit are supreme in case of any conflict with a state constitution or law.\r\n\r\nThe powers of government exercised by the states are more numerous, and\r\naffect the individual citizen in more ways, than those of the nation.\r\nThe force of contracts; the relations of employer and employed, husband\r\nand wife, parent and child; the administration of schools; and the\r\npunishment of most crimes, are matters controlled by the state. A much\r\nlarger amount of taxes is imposed by the states than by the nation.\r\n\r\n_Local Governments._--Moreover, the local government of counties, towns,\r\nand cities is entirely under the control of the state. State\r\nconstitutions contain many provisions in regard to this local\r\ngovernment, but the legislature can make laws affecting it more or less\r\ngreatly in the various states. In the local government of a city, town,\r\nor county there is to some extent a distribution of powers among\r\nlegislative, executive, and judicial officers. The legislative function\r\nis exercised by the city council or board of aldermen, the town trustees\r\n(or by the whole body of voters), and the county board of supervisors or\r\ncommissioners; the executive, by the city mayor, the county sheriff, and\r\nother officers; and the judicial, by various city courts, justices of\r\nthe peace, and county courts.\r\n\r\n_Political Rights and Duties._--The political rights and duties of\r\ncitizens depend chiefly on the state constitutions and laws. Elections,\r\nboth state and national, are conducted by state officers. The state\r\nprescribes who shall have the right to vote, and the various states\r\ndiffer greatly in this respect. Congress grants citizenship by a uniform\r\nrule of naturalization; but some states allow aliens to vote (on certain\r\nconditions), and some provide that a naturalized citizen can not vote\r\nuntil a certain period has elapsed after his naturalization. In some\r\nstates women may vote; in some only those men who have certain property\r\nor educational qualifications.\r\n\r\nThe right to vote is the qualification for holding most offices;\r\nadditional qualifications are prescribed for very important offices, in\r\nthe Federal and state constitutions. Thus, none but a native may be a\r\nPresident or Vice President of the United States, nor may a citizen\r\nunder thirty years of age be a member of the United States Senate.\r\nBesides voting and office holding, the most important political rights\r\nand duties of citizens are to sit on juries and to serve in the army.\r\nThe qualifications of jurors in state courts are prescribed by state\r\nauthority, and in national courts by national authority. Congress has\r\nthe exclusive power to raise armies, and in the Civil War hundreds of\r\nthousands of citizens came under national authority in connection with\r\nthe duty to bear arms. The militia, however, is commanded by state\r\nofficers, and in time of peace is under the control of the\r\nseparate states.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n%A%\r\n\r\nAbolition, laws;\r\n  societies;\r\n  opposition to;\r\n  Compromise Bill;\r\n  issue of Civil War.\r\nAcadia, extent of;\r\n  struggle for.\r\nAct, of 1870;\r\n  of 1873;\r\n  of 1875.\r\n_Adams_.\r\nAdams, Alvin.\r\nAdams, Charles F.\r\nAdams, John, defends soldiers;\r\n  Declaration of Independence;\r\n  negotiates treaty;\r\n  vice president;\r\n  president.\r\nAdams, John Quincy, opposes European colonization;\r\n  presidential nominee;\r\n  president;\r\n  opposed to slavery.\r\nAdams, John Q., vice-pres. nominee.\r\nAdams, Samuel.\r\nAdams Express Company.\r\n"Adams men".\r\n"Administration men".\r\n_Alabama_.\r\nAlabama, admitted;\r\n  secedes;\r\n  readmitted.\r\nAlabama claims.\r\nAlaska, boundaries;\r\n  purchased.\r\nAlbany, Dutch at;\r\n  colonial congress at.\r\nAlexandria.\r\nAlgonquins.\r\nAlien and Sedition laws.\r\nAllegheny River, French on.\r\nAllen, Ethan.\r\nAllison amendment.\r\nAmendments to Constitution, ten;\r\n  twelfth;\r\n  proposed thirteenth;\r\n  thirteenth;\r\n  fourteenth;\r\n  fifteenth.\r\nAmerica, discovery of;\r\n  naming of.\r\nAmerican Antislavery Society.\r\nAmerican Fur Trading Company.\r\nAmerican party.\r\nAmerican Republican party;\r\n  disappears.\r\nAmherst.\r\nAmnesty, proclamation issued;\r\n  political issue.\r\nAnaesthesia discovered.\r\nAnderson, Robert.\r\nAndr\xc3\xa9, Major John.\r\nAnnapolis, Md., founded; riot at;\r\n  trade convention at.\r\nAnnapolis, Port Royal called.\r\nAnnual message.\r\nAnti-Chinese movement.\r\nAnti-Federalists.\r\nAnti-Nebraska men.\r\nAntietam, battle of.\r\nAntimasonic party.\r\nAntislavery movement.\r\nAppomattox Courthouse.\r\nArbitration, policy;\r\n  between England and Venezuela.\r\nArgall, Governor.\r\n_Argus_.\r\nArizona, territory;\r\n  silver interests.\r\nArkansas, becomes territory;\r\n  admitted;\r\n  secedes;\r\n  Confederates in;\r\n  reconstruction;\r\n  readmitted.\r\nArmy of the Cumberland;\r\n  disbanded.\r\nArmy of the Potomac, peninsular campaign;\r\n  at Gettysburg;\r\n  in Wilderness campaign;\r\n  disbanded.\r\nArmy of Tennessee.\r\nArmy of Virginia.\r\nArnold, Benedict, attacks Quebec;\r\n  at Saratoga;\r\n  treason of;\r\n  in British service.\r\nArticles of Confederation.\r\nAshburton, Lord.\r\nAssumption of state debts.\r\nAstor, John Jacob.\r\nAstoria founded.\r\nAtchison settled.\r\nAtlanta burned.\r\nAtlantic cable.\r\nAuburn settled.\r\nAurania settled.\r\nAustin, Moses.\r\nAustin, Stephen.\r\n\r\n%B%\r\n\r\nBahama Islands.\r\nBalboa.\r\nBaltimore, founded;\r\n  in colonial times;\r\n  Congress at;\r\n  attacked;\r\n  route to the West;\r\n  convention at;\r\n  insurgents in;\r\n  labor congress in.\r\nBaltimore, Lord,\r\nBanks, United States, see National Bank;\r\n  state, see State Banks.\r\nBanks, N.

Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of\r\nelectronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers\r\nincluding obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists\r\nbecause of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\npeople in all walks of life.\r\n\r\nVolunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\nassistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\'s\r\ngoals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\nremain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\nGutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\nand permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\nTo learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\nand how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\nand the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\nEach eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook\'s\r\neBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,\r\ncompressed (zipped), HTML and others.\r\n\r\nCorrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over\r\nthe old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.\r\nVERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving\r\nnew filenames and etext numbers.\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n\r\nEBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,\r\nare filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to\r\ndownload any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular\r\nsearch system you may utilize the following addresses and just\r\ndownload by the etext year.\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.net/etext06\r\n\r\n    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,\r\n     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)\r\n\r\nEBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are\r\nfiled in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part\r\nof the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is\r\nidentical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single\r\ndigits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For\r\nexample an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234\r\n\r\nor filename 24689 would be found at:\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689\r\n\r\nAn alternative method of locating eBooks:\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.net/GUTINDEX.ALL\r\n\r\n'
