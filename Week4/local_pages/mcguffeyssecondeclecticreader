The moral tone is plain. "She is kind\r\nto the old blind man."\r\n\r\nThe exercises are still suitable, and perhaps more helpful than some\r\ncontemporary alternatives. Much is left to the teacher. Explanations given\r\nin the text are enough to get started teaching a child to read and write.\r\nCounting in Roman numerals is included as a bonus in the form of lesson\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\nThe author, not listed in the text is William Holmes McGuffey.\r\n\r\nDon Kostuch\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nECLECTIC EDUCATIONAL SERIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nMCGUFFEY\'S\xc2\xae\r\n\r\nSECOND\r\n\r\nECLECTIC READER.\r\n\r\nREVISED EDITION.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMcGuffey Editions and Colophon are Trademarks of\r\n\r\nJOHN WILEY & SONS, Inc..\r\nNew York - Chichester-Weinheim-Brisbane-Singapore-Toronto\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCopyright, 1879, by Van Antwerp, Bragg & Co.\r\nCopyright, 1896, by American Book Company\r\nCopyright, 1907 and 1920, by H. H. Vail.\r\n\r\nEP316\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPreface\r\n\r\nIn this book, as well as in the others of the Revised Series, most of the\r\nfavorite drill selections, which constituted one of the leading\r\nexcellences of MCGUFFEY\'S READERS, have been retained. New selections have\r\nbeen inserted only when they seemed manifest improvements on those\r\nformerly used.\r\n\r\nThe plan of this Reader is a continuation and extension of that pursued in\r\nthe First Reader.\r\n\r\nIf the pupil is not familiar with the diacritical marks, he should be\r\ncarefully drilled, as suggested on page 7, until the marked letter\r\ninstantly suggests the correct sound. He is then prepared to study his\r\nreading lessons without any assistance from the teacher.\r\n\r\nAll new words are given at the head of each lesson. When these are\r\nmastered, the main difficulties left for the pupil are those of\r\nexpression. In the latter portion of the book the simpler\r\nderivatives,--such as are formed by adding one or two\r\nletters,--possessives, plurals, verbal forms, etc.,--are omitted if the\r\nprimitive word has been given. In this way the pupil is gradually led to\r\nthe mastery of words as ordinarily printed.\r\n\r\nA few of the most usual abbreviations have been introduced,--such as Mr.,\r\nMrs., etc. These should be carefully explained, not only as to their\r\nmeaning and use, but as to the reason for their use.\r\n\r\nGreat care has been taken to have the illustrations worthy of the\r\nreputation MCGUFFEY\'S READERS have attained, and some of the foremost\r\ndesigners of this country have contributed to the embellishment of the\r\nbook.\r\n\r\nMany of these pictures will serve admirably for lessons in language, in\r\nextension and explanation of the text. The imagination of the artist has,\r\nin some cases, filled in details not found in the text.\r\n\r\nThe thanks of the publishers are due to very many experienced teachers,\r\nwho have contributed their valuable suggestions.\r\n\r\nJune, 1879.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTORY MATTER.\r\n\r\nARTICULATION\r\nPUNCTUATION\r\n\r\nSELECTIONS IN PROSE AND POETRY.\r\n\r\nLessons.\r\n1.

Care\r\nshould be taken that the pupils observe and practice these sounds\r\ncorrectly in their reading.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF VOCALS.\r\n\r\nLong Sounds\r\n\r\nSound   as in    Sound   as in\r\na       ate        e     err\r\na       care       i     ice\r\na       arm        o     ode\r\na       last       u     use\r\na       all        u     burn\r\ne       eve        oo    fool\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSHORT SOUNDS.\r\n\r\nSound   as in      Sound   as in\r\na        am         o      odd\r\ne        end        u      up\r\ni        in         oo     look\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDIPHTHONGS.\r\n\r\nSound   as in      Sound   as in\r\noi      oil         ou      out\r\noy      boy         ow      now\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF SUBVOCALS.\r\n\r\nSound   as in      Sound   as in\r\nb        bib         v     valve\r\nd        did         th    this\r\ng        gig         z     zin\r\nj        jug         z     azure\r\nn        nine        r     rare\r\nm        maim        w     we\r\nng       hang         y    yet\r\nl        lull\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE 0F ASPIRATES.\r\n\r\nSound   as in      Sound   as in\r\nf       fifi        t      tat\r\nh       him         sh     she\r\nk       kite        ch     chat\r\np       pipe        th     thick\r\ns       same        wh     why\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTABLE OF SUBSTITUTES.\r\n\r\nSub   for   as in      Sub   for   as in\r\na      o    what        y    i     myth\r\ne      a    there       c    k     can\r\ne      a    feint       c    a     cite\r\ni      e    police      ch   sh    chaise\r\ni      e    sir         ch   k     chaos\r\no      u    son         g    j     gem\r\no      oo   to          n    ng    ink\r\no      oo   wolf        s    z     as\r\no      a    fork        s    sh    sure\r\no      u    work        x    gz    exact\r\nu      oo   full        gh   f     laugh\r\nu      oo   rude        ph   f     phlox\r\ny      i    fly         qu   k     pique\r\nqu     kw   quit\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPUNCTUATION.\r\n\r\nPunctuation Marks are used to make the sense more clear.\r\n\r\nA Period (.) is used at the end of a sentence, and after an\r\nabbreviation; as,\r\n\r\n   James was quite sick. Dr. Jones was called to see him.\r\n\r\nAn Interrogation Mark (?) is used at the end of a question; as,\r\n\r\n   Where is John going?\r\n\r\nAn Exclamation Mark (!) is used after words or sentences expressing some\r\nstrong feeling; as,\r\n\r\n   Alas, my noble boy! that thou shouldst die!\r\n\r\nThe Comma (,), Semicolon (;), and Colon (:) are used to separate the parts\r\nof a sentence.\r\n\r\nThe Hyphen (-) is used to join the parts of a compound word; as,\r\ntext-book: it is also used at the end of a line in print or script, when a\r\nword is divided; as in the word "sentence," near the bottom of page 9.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bird perched on tree branch.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMCGUFFEY\'S\r\nSECOND READER.\r\n\r\nLESSON I.\r\n\r\nnews\'paper    cold    or\'der    seem    through\r\n\r\nstock\'ings    chat    sto\'ry    light   Har\'ry\r\n\r\nbranch\'es     kiss    burns     Mrs.    e vents\'\r\n\r\nan oth\'er     Mr.     stool     lamp    mends\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Family at evening; father reading newspaper, mother sewing,\r\nboy and girl reading.]\r\n\r\nEVENING AT HOME.\r\n\r\n1. It is winter. The cold wind whistles through the branches of the trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Mr. Brown has done his day\'s work, and his children, Harry and Kate,\r\nhave come home from school. They learned their lessons well to-day, and\r\nboth feel happy\r\n\r\n3. Tea is over. Mrs. Brown has put the little sitting room in order. The\r\nfire burns brightly. One lamp gives light enough for all. On the stool is\r\na basket of fine apples. They seem to say, "Won\'t you have one?"\r\n\r\n4. Harry and Kate read a story in a new book. The father reads his\r\nnewspaper, and the mother mends Harry\'s stockings.\r\n\r\n5. By and by, they will tell one another what they have been reading\r\nabout, and will have a chat over the events of the day.\r\n\r\n6. Harry and Kate\'s bedtime will come first. I think I see them kiss their\r\ndear father and mother a sweet good night.\r\n\r\n7. Do you not wish that every boy and girl could have a home like this?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON II.\r\n\r\nbeau\'ti ful    porch    rain\'bow    burst\r\n\r\nbub\'bling      same     biggest     sneeze    col\'ors\r\n\r\nmain           soap     wash        red       ma\'ny (men\'y)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Three children playing with bubbles and cat.]\r\n\r\nBUBBLES.\r\n\r\n1. The boys have come out on the porch to blow bubbles. The old cat is\r\nasleep on the mat by the door.\r\n\r\n2. "Ha! ha!" laughs Robert, as a bubble comes down softly on the old cat\'s\r\nback, and does not burst.\r\n\r\n3. Willie tries to make his bubble do the same. This time it comes down on\r\nthe cat\'s face, and makes her sneeze.\r\n\r\n4. "She would rather wash her face without soap," says Harry. "Now let us\r\nsee who can make the biggest bubble."\r\n\r\n5. "Mine is the biggest," says Robert. "See how high it floats in the air!\r\nI can see--ah! it has burst."\r\n\r\n6. "I can see the house and the trees and the sky in mine," says Willie;\r\n"and such beautiful colors."\r\n\r\n7.  "How many, Willie?"\r\n\r\n8. "Red, one; blue, two; there--they are all out. Let us try again."\r\n\r\n9. "I know how many colors there are," says Harry. "Just as many as there\r\nare in the rainbow."\r\n\r\n10.

James White has two dogs. One is a Newfoundland dog, and the other is a\r\nScotch terrier.\r\n\r\n2. The Newfoundland is a large, noble fellow. He is black, with a white\r\nspot, and with long, shaggy hair. His name is Sport.\r\n\r\n3. Sport is a good watchdog, and a kind playfellow. Every night he guards\r\nthe house while James and his father are asleep.\r\n\r\n4. In the daytime, James often uses Sport for his horse. He has a little\r\nwagon, and a set of small harness which just fits the dog.\r\n\r\n5. He hitches Sport to this wagon, and drives over the country. In this\r\nway, he can go almost as fast as his father with the old family horse.\r\n\r\n6. The name of James\'s Scotch terrier is Dodger. He is called Dodger\r\nbecause he jumps about so friskily. He is up on a chair, under the table,\r\nbehind the door, down cellar, and out in the yard,--all in a minute.\r\n\r\n7. Dodger has very bright eyes, and he does many funny things. He likes to\r\nput his paws up on the crib, and watch the baby.\r\n\r\n8. The other day he took baby\'s red stocking, and had great fun with it;\r\nbut he spoiled it in his play, and James had to scold him.\r\n\r\n9. Everyone likes to see James White with his two dogs. They always seem\r\nvery happy together.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON VI.\r\n\r\nbet ween\'    bu\'reau (-ro)    stairs    nee\'dle\r\n\r\na fraid\'     shad\'ow          held      stir\r\n\r\nAFRAID IN THE DARK.\r\n\r\n1.

"I\'m afraid," said Willie.\r\n\r\n4.  "Afraid of what?"\r\n\r\n5.  "It\'s dark up there."\r\n\r\n6.  "What is the dark?" asked mamma. "See! It is nothing but a shadow."\r\nAnd she held her hand between the lamp and the workbasket on the table.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mother, seated in rocking chair, kerosene lamp on table,\r\nboy standing, examining his shadow on the wall.]\r\n\r\n7. "Now it is dark in the basket; but as soon as I take my hand away, it\r\nis light."\r\n\r\n8. "Come and stand between the lamp and the wall, Willie. See! There is\r\nyour shadow on the wall. Can your shadow hurt you?"\r\n\r\n9. "Oh no, mamma! I am sure it can not hurt me."\r\n\r\n10. "Well, the dark is only a big shadow over everything."\r\n\r\n11. "What makes the big shadow, mamma?"\r\n\r\n12. "I will tell you all about that, Willie, when you are a little older.\r\nBut now, I wish you would find me a brave boy who is not afraid of\r\nshadows, to run upstairs and get my needlebook."\r\n\r\n13.

Puss, with her three kittens, had lived in the coal cellar; but one day\r\nshe thought she would carry them to the attic.\r\n\r\n2. The servant thought that was not the proper place for them; so she\r\ncarried them back to the cellar.\r\n\r\n3. Puss was certain that she wanted them in the attic; so she carried them\r\nthere again and again, five, six, seven, --yes, a dozen times; for each\r\ntime the servant took them back to the cellar.\r\n\r\n4. Poor puss was nearly tired out, and could carry them no longer.\r\n\r\n5. Suddenly she went away. Where do you think she went?\r\n\r\n6. She was gone a long time. When she returned, she had a strange cat with\r\nher that we had never seen before.\r\n\r\n7. She seemed to tell him all about her great trouble, and he listened to\r\nher story.\r\n\r\n8. Then the strange cat took the little kittens, one by one, and carried\r\nthem to the attic. After this he went away, and we have never seen him\r\nsince.\r\n\r\n9. The servant then left the kittens in the attic, for she saw how anxious\r\npuss was to have them stay there.\r\n\r\n10. Was not the strange cat kind to puss?

In the barn a little mousie\r\n     Ran to and fro;\r\n   For she heard the little kitty,\r\n     Long time ago.\r\n\r\n3. Two black eyes had little kitty,\r\n     Black as a crow;\r\n   And they spied the little mousie,\r\n     Long time ago.\r\n\r\n4. Four soft paws had little kitty,\r\n     Paws soft as snow;\r\n   And they caught the little mousie,\r\n     Long time ago.\r\n\r\n5. Nine pearl teeth had little kitty,\r\n     All in a row;\r\n   And they bit the little mousie,\r\n     Long time ago.\r\n\r\n6. When the teeth bit little mousie,\r\n     Mousie cried out "Oh!"\r\n   But she slipped away from kitty,\r\n     Long time ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON X.\r\n\r\nwashed    hours(ours)    pre\'cious    game\r\n\r\nharm      a\'ny (en\'y)    brushed      end\r\n\r\n\r\nAT WORK.\r\n\r\n1. A little play does not harm any one, but does much good. After play, we\r\nshould be glad to work.\r\n\r\n2. I knew a boy who liked a good game very much. He could run, swim, jump,\r\nand play ball; and was always merry when out of school.\r\n\r\n3. But he knew that time is not all for play; that our minutes, hours, and\r\ndays are very precious.\r\n\r\n4. At the end of his play, he would go home. After he had washed his face\r\nand hands, and brushed his hair, he would help his mother, or read in his\r\nbook, or write upon his slate.\r\n\r\n5. He used to say, "One thing at a time." When he had done with work, he\r\nwould play; but he did not try to play and to work at the same time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XI.\r\n\r\ntwit-twee    bough (bow)    twit-twit    top\'most    lock\r\n\r\nspray        mate           close\'ly     ros\'y       an\'swer (an\'ser)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Bird perched on tree branch.]\r\n\r\nWHAT A BIRD TAUGHT.\r\n\r\n1.

Susie Sunbeam was not her real name; that was Susan Brown. But every\r\none called her Susie Sunbeam, because she had such a sweet, smiling face,\r\nand always brought brightness with her when she came.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Older girls playing with younger girl. Three children\r\nstanding in background.]\r\n\r\n2. Her grandfather first gave her this name, and it seemed to fit the\r\nlittle girl so nicely that soon it took the place of her own.\r\n\r\n3. Even when a baby, Susie laughed and crowed from morning till night. No\r\none ever heard her cry unless she was sick or hurt.\r\n\r\n4. When she had learned to walk, she loved to go about the house and get\r\nthings for her mother, and in this way save her as many steps as she\r\ncould.\r\n\r\n5. She would sit by her mother\'s side for an hour at a time, and ask her\r\never so many questions, or she would take her new book and read.\r\n\r\n6. Susie was always pleasant in her play with other children. She never\r\nused an unkind word, but tried to do whatever would please her playmates\r\nbest.\r\n\r\n7. One day, a poor little girl with a very ragged dress was going by and\r\nSusie heard some children teasing her and making fun of her.\r\n\r\n8. She at once ran out to the gate, and asked the poor little girl to come\r\nin. "What are you crying for?" Susie asked.\r\n\r\n9. "Because they all laugh at me," she said.\r\n\r\n10. Then Susie took the little girl into the house. She cheered her up\r\nwith kind words, and gave her a nice dress and a pair of shoes.\r\n\r\n11. This brought real joy and gladness to the poor child, and she, too,\r\nthought that Susie was rightly called Sunbeam.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XIII.\r\n\r\nwood\'lands    di vine\'    raised     un til\'    droop\'ing    blessed\r\n\r\nwhose         seek        up\'ward    hov\'els    in\'ner       steal\r\n\r\nheav\'en       hearts      lil\'ies    die        roam\'ing\r\n\r\n\r\nIF I WERE A SUNBEAM.\r\n\r\n1.

Henry was a kind, good boy. His father was dead, and his mother was\r\nvery poor. He had a little sister about two years old.\r\n\r\n2. He wanted to help his mother, for she could not always earn enough to\r\nbuy food for her little family.\r\n\r\n3. One day, a man gave him a dollar for finding a pocketbook which he had\r\nlost.\r\n\r\n4. Henry might have kept all the money, for no one saw him when he found\r\nit. But his mother had taught him to be honest, and never to keep what did\r\nnot belong, to him.\r\n\r\n5. With the dollar he bought a box, three brushes, and some blacking. He\r\nthen went to the corner of the street, and said to every one whose boots\r\ndid not look nice, "Black your boots, sir, please?"\r\n\r\n6. He was so polite that gentlemen soon began to notice him, and to let\r\nhim black their boots. The first day he brought home fifty cents, which he\r\ngave to his mother to buy food with.\r\n\r\n7. When he gave her the money, she said, as she dropped a tear of joy,\r\n"You are a dear, good boy, Henry. I did not know how I could earn enough\r\nto buy bread with, but now I think we can manage to get along quite well,"\r\n\r\n8. Henry worked all the day, and went to school in the evening. He earned\r\nalmost enough to support his mother and his little sister.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XV.\r\n\r\ntread     whis\'per     soft\'ly     talk     cheer ful\'     care\'ful\r\n\r\n\r\nDON\'T WAKE THE BABY.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Script Exercise:\r\n\r\nBaby sleeps, so we must tread\r\nSoftly round her little bed,\r\nAnd be careful that our toys\r\nDon not fall and make a noise.\r\n\r\nWe must not talk, but whisper low,\r\nMother wants to work, we know,\r\nThat, when father comes to tea,\r\nAll may neat and cheerful be.\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XVI.\r\n\r\nfull    load     heav\'y     mid\'dle     heav\'i er\r\n\r\nslip    wrong    han\'dle    broth\'er    de ceived\'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Two boys carrying a basket on a pole between them.]\r\n\r\nA KIND BROTHER.\r\n\r\n1. A boy was once sent from home to take a basket of things to his\r\ngrandmother.\r\n\r\n2. The basket was so full that it was very heavy. So his little brother\r\nwent with him, to help carry the load.\r\n\r\n3. They put a pole under the handle of the basket, and each then took hold\r\nof an end of the pole. In this way they could carry the basket very\r\nnicely.\r\n\r\n4. Now the older boy thought, "My brother Tom does not know about this\r\npole.\r\n\r\n5. "If I slip the basket near him, his side will be heavy, and mine light;\r\nbut if the basket is in the middle of the pole, it will be as heavy for me\r\nas it is for him.\r\n\r\n6. "Tom does not know this as I do. But I will not do it. It would be\r\nwrong, and I will not do what is wrong."\r\n\r\n7. Then he slipped the basket quite near his own end of the pole. His load\r\nwas now heavier than that of his little brother.\r\n\r\n8. Yet he was happy; for he felt that he had done right. Had he deceived\r\nhis brother, he would not have felt at all happy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XVII.\r\n\r\nbus\'y (biz\'zy)    mis\'chief    looked     un\'to    glee\r\n\r\ncon triv\'ing      ring\'lets    nod\'dle    drew     nun\r\n\r\npress\'ing         fin\'gers     car\'pet    wise     lips\r\n\r\nem brace\'         pon\'der      lash\'es    climb    true\r\n\r\n\r\nMY GOOD-FOR-NOTHING.\r\n\r\n                 1.\r\n"What are you good for, my brave little man?\r\nAnswer that question for me, if you can,--\r\nYou, with your fingers as white as a nun,--\r\nYou, with your ringlets as bright as the sun.\r\nAll the day long, with your busy contriving,\r\nInto all mischief and fun you are driving;\r\nSee if your wise little noddle can tell\r\nWhat you are good for.

The kingbird is not bigger than a robin.\r\n\r\n2. He eats flies, and worms, and bugs, and berries.\r\n\r\n3. He builds his nest in a tree, near some house.\r\n\r\n4. When there are young ones in the nest, he sits on the top of a tree\r\nnear them.\r\n\r\n5. He watches to see that no bird comes to hurt them or their mother.\r\n\r\n6. If a hawk, a crow, or even an eagle comes near, he makes a dash at it.\r\n\r\n7. Though he is so small, he is brave, and he is also very active.\r\n\r\n8. He never fails to drive off other birds from his nest.\r\n\r\n9. He flies around and around the eagle, and suddenly strikes him with his\r\nsharp bill.\r\n\r\n10. He strikes at his eye, and then darts away before the eagle can catch\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n11. Or he strikes from behind, and is off again before the eagle can turn\r\nround.\r\n\r\n12. In a short time, the great eagle is tired of such hard blows, and\r\nflies away. He is very glad to get rid of his foe.\r\n\r\n13. Is not the little fellow a brave bird?\r\n\r\n14. Because he can drive off all other birds, he is called the KINGBIRD.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XIX.\r\n\r\nwatch\'ing    gath\'ers    an\'gels    be gin\'\r\n\r\ndark\'ness    a cross\'    lone\'ly    beasts\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sunset;lake in foreground, town in background.]\r\n\r\n\r\nEVENING HYMN.\r\n\r\n1.

Under a great tree in the woods, two boys saw a fine, large nut, and\r\nboth ran to get it.\r\n\r\n2. James got to it first, and picked it up.\r\n\r\n3. "It is mine," said John, "for I was the first to see it."\r\n\r\n4. "No, it is mine" said James, "for I was the first to pick it up."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Three boys standing by a fence, one older than the others.]\r\n\r\n5. Thus, they at once began to quarrel about the nut.\r\n\r\n6. As they could not agree whose it should be, they called an older boy,\r\nand asked him.\r\n\r\n7. The older boy said, "I will settle this quarrel."\r\n\r\n8. He took the nut, and broke the shell. He then took out the kernel, and\r\ndivided the shell into two parts, as nearly equal as he could.\r\n\r\n9. "This half of the shell," said he, "belongs to the boy who first saw\r\nthe nut.\r\n\r\n10. "And this half belongs to the boy who picked it up.\r\n\r\n11. "The kernel of the nut, I shall keep as my pay for settling the\r\nquarrel.\r\n\r\n12. "This is the way," said he, laughing, "in which quarrels are very apt\r\nto end."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXI.\r\n\r\ncrea\'tures    drones     in\'side    hive     i\'dle\r\n\r\nde fense\'     driv\'en    killed     cells    size\r\n\r\nwork\'ers      queen      stings     shape    wax\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BEE.\r\n\r\n1. Bees live in a house that is called a hive. They are of three\r\nkinds,--workers, drones, and queens.\r\n\r\n2. Only one queen can live in each hive. If she is lost or dead, the other\r\nbees will stop their work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Three bee-hives; wooden boxes about two feet square and four\r\nfeet high, with a sloped roof.]\r\n\r\n3. They are very wise and busy little creatures. They all join together to\r\nbuild cells of wax for their honey.\r\n\r\n4. Each bee takes its proper place, and does its own work. Some go out and\r\ngather honey from the flowers; others stay at home and work inside the\r\nhive.\r\n\r\n5. The cells which they build, are all of one shape and size, and no room\r\nis left between them.\r\n\r\n6. The cells are not round, but have six sides. 7. Did you ever look into\r\na glass hive to see the bees while at work? It is pleasant to see how busy\r\nthey always are.\r\n\r\n8. But the drones do not work. Before winter comes, all the drones are\r\ndriven from the hive or killed, that they may not eat the honey which they\r\ndid not gather.\r\n\r\n9. It is not quite safe for children to handle bees. They have sharp\r\nstings that they know well how to use in their defense.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSLATE WORK.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Script Exercise:\r\n\r\nHow doth the little busy bee\r\n  Improve each shining hour.\r\nAnd gather honey all the day\r\n  From every opening flower!\r\n]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXII.\r\n\r\nblos\'soms    drear\'y    wea\'ry       pinks       smell\'ing    toil\'ing\r\n\r\nlev\'ies      buzz       fra\'grant    this\'tle    weeds        scent\r\n\r\ntreas\'ure    yel\'low    mead\'ow      tax         sum\'mer      clo\'ver\r\n\r\ncloud\'y      dai\'sy     daf\'fo dil lies          columbine    humming\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Flowers]\r\n\r\nTHE SONG OF THE BEE.\r\n\r\n1.

Mary Armstrong was a pretty little girl, but she was heedless about\r\nsome things.\r\n\r\n2. Her way of leaving her books and playthings just where she had used\r\nthem last, gave her mother much trouble in picking them up and putting\r\nthem in their proper places.\r\n\r\n3. She had often told Mary the evil effects of being so careless. Her\r\nbooks became spoiled, and her toys broken.\r\n\r\n4. But worse than this was the growing habit of carelessness, which would\r\nbe of great harm to her all her life. It would make her unhappy, and would\r\nannoy her friends.\r\n\r\n5. One day Mary and her mother went out into their pleasant yard, to spend\r\nan hour in the open air. Mrs. Armstrong took her work with her.\r\n\r\n6. Mary ran about and played with Dash, her pet dog, and was having a\r\nhappy time.\r\n\r\n7. But in a corner of the yard she found her nicest doll all torn and\r\nbroken, and its dress covered with mud.\r\n\r\n8. She knew, at once, that Dash had done this, and she scolded him\r\nharshly.\r\n\r\n9. Carrying the broken doll to her mamma. she showed it to her, and could\r\nhardly keep from crying.\r\n\r\n10. Mrs. Armstrong asked Mary if she had not left the doll on the porch\r\nwhere Dash could easily get it; and Mary had to answer, "Yes, ma\'am."\r\n\r\n11. "Then you must not blame the dog, Mary, for he does not know it is\r\nwrong for him to play with your doll. I hope this will be a lesson to you\r\nhereafter, to put your things away when you are through playing."\r\n\r\n12. "I will try," said Mary. And her mother promised to mend the doll as\r\nwell as she could.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXIV.\r\n\r\nthor\'ough ly    month    dried    dyed    cuts     shear\'er    sheep\r\n\r\nthose   spun    dirt     oth\'er wise      wov\'en   cloth    wool    rub\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Two men shearing sheep.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSHEEP-SHEARING.\r\n\r\n1. Sheep are washed and sheared some time in the month of June. This\r\nshould be done quite early in the month, before the hot days begin.\r\n\r\n2. It is fine sport for those who look on, but not much fun for the sheep.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. It is best for the sheep to have the wool taken off; otherwise they\r\nwould suffer in the summer time.\r\n\r\n4. When the time comes for washing the sheep, they are driven to a pond or\r\na little river.\r\n\r\n5. Then they are thrown into the water, one at a time. The men who are in\r\nthe water catch them, and squeeze the wet wool with their hands to get the\r\ndirt all out of it.\r\n\r\n6. Then the wool is thoroughly dried, the sheep are taken to the shearer;\r\nand he cuts off the wool with a large pair of shears.\r\n\r\n7. It is then dyed, spun, and woven into cloth.\r\n\r\n8.

Little Patty lives in a log house near a great forest. She has no\r\nsisters, and her big brothers are away all day helping their father.\r\n\r\n2. But Patty is never lonely; for, though the nearest house is miles away,\r\nshe has many little friends. Here are two of them that live in the woods.\r\n\r\n3. But how did Patty teach them to be so tame? Patty came to the woods\r\noften, and was always so quiet and gentle that the squirrels soon found\r\nthey need not be afraid of her.\r\n\r\n4. She brought her bread and milk to eat under the trees, and was sure to\r\nleave crumbs for the squirrels.\r\n\r\n5. When they came near, she sat very still and watched them. So, little by\r\nlittle, she made them her friends, till, at last, they would sit on her\r\nshoulder, and eat from her hand.\r\n\r\n6. Squirrels build for themselves summer houses. Those are made of leaves,\r\nand sticks, and moss. They are nice and cool for summer, but would never\r\ndo for the winter cold and snow.\r\n\r\n7. So these wise little people find a hollow in an old tree. They make it\r\nwarm and snug with soft moss and leaves; and here the squirrels live all\r\nthrough the long winter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXVII.\r\n\r\nfright\'ened   int end\'    wheat       Thom\'as    com plains\'    plums\r\n\r\nchoose        shock\'ing   spar\'row    rip\'est    rob\'bing\r\n\r\nbreak\'fast    plen\'ty     share       treat      tales          wait\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Sparrow perched on snow-covered branch.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPARROW.\r\n\r\n1.

One fine summer afternoon, Sam was walking home from school. He went\r\nalong slowly, reading a book.\r\n\r\n2. Sam had spent all his money for the book, but he was a happy boy.\r\n\r\n3. At length he came into the highroad, where there was a gate. A blind\r\nman stood, holding it open.\r\n\r\n4. The poor man said, "Please give me a few cents to buy some bread!" But\r\nSam gave him nothing.\r\n\r\n5. What! did Sam give the poor blind man nothing? Yes; for, as I told you,\r\nhe had spent all his money.\r\n\r\n6. So Sam walked on, very sad. Soon after, a fine carriage came up, and in\r\nit were Harry and his mother.\r\n\r\n7. The blind man stood, and held out his hat. "Let us give the poor man\r\nsomething," said Harry to his mother.\r\n\r\n8. His mother gave him some cents. Harry took them, but did not put them\r\ninto the man\'s hat.\r\n\r\n9. He threw them into the hedge as far as he could. The poor man could not\r\nfind them, for, you know, ho was blind.\r\n\r\n10. Sam had turned back to look at the fine carriage. He saw Harry throw\r\nthe cents into the hedge; so he came back at once, and looked for the\r\nmoney until he found it all for the blind man.\r\n\r\n11. This took so long a time, that he almost lost his supper.\r\n\r\n12. Which of the boys do you think was truly kind to the poor man?\r\n\r\n13. I know which he thanked most in his heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXIX.\r\n\r\nrip\'pling    fringe    stray    thou    mill\r\n\r\nvil\'lage     brink    clear     wild    hill\r\n\r\ncourse       bathe     tiny     pool    rill\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LITTLE HILL.\r\n\r\n1.

"Sit still, children. Do not move about in the boat," said Mr. Rose to\r\nthe young folks he was taking for a trip on the water.\r\n\r\n2. The boat was a large one, and could not easily be upset. There were in\r\nit Mr. and Mrs. Rose, the boatman, and several little boys and girls.\r\n\r\n3. "Keep still, please, young gentlemen," said the boatman, when Edgar\r\nRose and Thomas Read began to move from one side to the other.\r\n\r\n4. They kept quiet for a short time only. Edgar soon wanted a stick which\r\nThomas held in his hand. He lost his balance in trying to get the stick,\r\nand fell into the water.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Overturned boat, people clinging to boat and debris.\r\nAnother boat approaching.]\r\n\r\n\r\n5. Mr. and Mrs. Rose both started up, and stretched out their arms to save\r\nhim; but in so doing, they upset the boat.\r\n\r\n6. Every one fell into the water, and all were in the greatest danger of\r\nbeing drowned.\r\n\r\n7. Another boat was near, with but one man in it. He hastened to them as\r\nquickly as possible, and saved them from drowning.\r\n\r\n8. Children should always be careful and quiet when they are in a boat on\r\nthe water, and should obey what older people tell them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXXI.\r\n\r\nMARY\'S LETTER.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Script Exercise:\r\n\r\n     Forest Hill, June 25, 1878\r\nMy  Dear Fanny:\r\n             This morning while\r\nout rowing, we all came near\r\nbeing drowned.

The boat upset and how\r\nwe were all saved I can hardly\r\ntell.

The tiger is a giant cat. His body is nearly covered with black\r\nstripes.\r\n\r\n2. Unlike the lion, he runs so fast that the swiftest horse can not\r\novertake him. He goes over the ground by making bounds or springs, one\r\nafter another.\r\n\r\n3. By night, as well as by day, the tiger watches for his prey. With a\r\nfrightful roar, he will seize a man, and carry him off.\r\n\r\n4. Have you ever thought what use whiskers are to cats? Lions have great\r\nwhiskers, and so have tigers and all other animals of the cat kind.\r\n\r\n5. Whenever you find an animal with whiskers like the cat\'s, you may be\r\nsure that animal steals softly among branches and thick bushes.\r\n\r\n6. By the slightest touch on the tiger\'s whiskers, he knows when there is\r\nanything in his road.\r\n\r\n7. A few years ago, some English officers went out to hunt. When coming\r\nhome from their day\'s sport, they found a little tiger kitten.\r\n\r\n8. They took it with them and tied it, with a collar and chain, to the\r\npole of their tent. It played about, to the delight of all who saw it.\r\n\r\n9. One evening, just as it was growing dark, they heard a sound that\r\nfrightened them greatly. It was the roar of a tiger.\r\n\r\n10. The kitten pulled at the chain, and tried to break away. With a sharp\r\ncry, it answered the voice outside.\r\n\r\n11. All at once, a large tigress bounded into the middle of the tent. She\r\ncaught her kitten by the neck, and broke the chain which bound it.\r\n\r\n12. Then turning to the door of the tent, she dashed away as suddenly as\r\nshe had come.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXXIII.\r\n\r\nthen      u\'su al    cous\'in      fire\'side    sew\'ing (so-)\r\n\r\nKa\'tie    bet\'ter    crac\'kle     knit\'ting    per haps\'\r\n\r\nJane      rea\'son    to-night\'    hap\'pi er    in struct\'ive\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FIRESIDE.\r\n\r\n1. One winter night, Mrs. Lord and her two little girls sat by a bright\r\nfire in their pleasant home. The girls were sewing, and their mother was\r\nbusy at her knitting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mother and two girls sewing under a lamp.]\r\n\r\n2. At last, Katie finished her work, and, looking up, said, "Mother, I\r\nthink the fire is brighter than usual. How I love to hear it crackle!"\r\n\r\n3. "And I was about to say," cried Mary, "that this is a better light than\r\nwe had last night."\r\n\r\n4. "My dears," said their mother, "it must be that you feel happier than\r\nusual to-night. Perhaps that is the reason why you think the fire better,\r\nand the light brighter."\r\n\r\n5. "But, mother," said Mary, "I do not see why we are happier now than we\r\nwere then; for last night cousin Jane was here, and we played \'Puss in the\r\ncorner\' and \'Blind man\' until we all were tired."\r\n\r\n6. "I know! I know why!" said Katie. "It is because we have all been doing\r\nsomething useful to-night. We feel happy because we have been busy."\r\n\r\n7. "You are right, my dear," said their mother. "I am glad you have both\r\nlearned that there may be something more pleasant than play, and, at the\r\nsame time, more instructive."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXXIV.\r\n\r\ndew\'drops    hop\'ping     la\'zi est    bends    sung\r\n\r\npa\'tience    in stead\'    dar\'ling     ought    rest\r\n\r\nslum\'ber     my self \'    re ply\'      miss     lose\r\n\r\n\r\nBIRDIE\'S MORNING SONG.\r\n\r\n1.

Two fast friends were Willie Brown and his little dog Bounce. Willie\r\ncould never think of taking a walk without Bounce. Cake and play were\r\nequally shared between them.\r\n\r\n2. Willie taught his dog many cunning tricks, and often said that Bounce\r\ncould do almost anything in the world but talk.\r\n\r\n3. There came a time, however, when Bounce really told Willie\'s father\r\nsomething, though he could not talk. Let me tell you how he did this.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Boy and dog walking through forest.]\r\n\r\n4. It was on a bright summer afternoon. Willie had strolled with Bounce\r\ndown to the river, which was not more than two blocks from his father\'s\r\nstore.\r\n\r\n5. Willie began to throw stones into the water, and to watch the ripples\r\nas they made one circle after another.\r\n\r\n6. Bounce lay on the grass, watching the flies that buzzed around his\r\nnose, and catching any that came too near.\r\n\r\n7. There were some logs floating in the river near the shore. Willie\r\njumped upon one of them, to see if he could throw a stone across the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\n8. He drew back, and sent the stone with all his might. just as it left\r\nhis hand, the log turned, and he fell into the water.\r\n\r\n9. He was very much frightened, for he did not know how to swim, and there\r\nwas no one to hear, though he called as loud as he could for help.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXXVI.\r\n\r\nyelp      loud\'ly    against    look\'ing     bark\'ing\r\n\r\nspring    clothes    o\'pened    dis\'tress    scratched\r\n\r\n\r\nWILLIE AND BOUNCE.\r\n(CONCLUDED.)\r\n\r\n1. Poor little Bounce gave a great yelp of distress. If he had been a big\r\nwater dog, he could have jumped in and brought his master out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Boy in water clinging to log. Dog yelping.]\r\n\r\n2. He ran up and down the bank two or three times, barking, looking first\r\nat Willie and then around. Then he started, as fast as he could run, up\r\nthe street to the store.\r\n\r\n3. When he got there the door was shut, but he scratched against it and\r\nbarked loudly, until some one came and opened it.\r\n\r\n4. He caught hold of Mr. Brown\'s clothes, then ran to the door, then back\r\nagain, catching at him, barking, and jumping.\r\n\r\n5. A friend who was in the store said to Mr. Brown, "Something must be\r\nwrong; I would put on my hat, and go with the dog." Bounce, seeing Mr.\r\nBrown take his hat, started for the river.\r\n\r\n6. Then Mr. Brown thought of Willie. As he came to the river, he saw\r\nWillie\'s hat floating on the water, and his small arm thrown up.\r\n\r\n7. He sprang in and caught him just as he was going down for the last\r\ntime, and quickly carried him to the bank. "Willie soon got over his\r\nfright, and no one seemed to be more delighted than Bounce.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Father carrying boy from water.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXXVII.\r\n\r\ntalk\'a tive    im prove\'    o bli\'ging    writ\'ten    tick-tock\r\n\r\nclock          truth\'ful    it self\'      kitch\'en    fear\r\n\r\nreach\'es       most\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Girl holding younger sister, both watching clock.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE KITCHEN CLOCK.\r\n\r\n1.

"Herbert, will you please peel my orange?" said Lucy. Herbert was\r\nreading his new book, but he put it down at once, and took the orange from\r\nhis little sister.\r\n\r\n2. "Shall I make a pair of scales, Lucy, for you to use when you play\r\nstore?"\r\n\r\n3. "Oh yes! but how can you do that\'!"\r\n\r\n4.  "I\'ll show you. First, we must take the peel off in two little cups,\r\none just as large as the other. While I do this, see if you can find me\r\ntwo nice sticks about ten inches long."\r\n\r\n5. Lucy ran out to the woodhouse to find the sticks.--" Will these do?"\r\n\r\n6. "No, they are too hard. Find some pine sticks if you can."\r\n\r\n7.  "Here are some."\r\n\r\n8. "These will do nicely. Now I must make a scale beam and a post. Can you\r\nfind me a little block for a post, Lucy\'!"\r\n\r\n9. "Will a ribbon block do, Herbert?"\r\n\r\n10.  "Yes, if it is not too thick."\r\n\r\n11.  "Here is one an inch thick."\r\n\r\n12. "That will be just right. Now get the little gimlet."\r\n\r\n[Footnote: gimlet: Hand tool with a spiraled shank, a screw tip, and a\r\ncross handle; used for boring holes.]\r\n\r\n13. Herbert worked away until he had made the beam and the post. Then he\r\nmade a hole in the middle of the block, and put the post in. Next, he put\r\nthe beam into a little groove at the top of the post, so that it would\r\nbalance nicely.\r\n\r\n14. "Now, Lucy, we must have a needle and some thread. We must put four\r\nthreads to each cup; then we will tie the threads to the ends of the beam.\r\n\r\n\r\n15. "There, Lucy, what do you think of that?"\r\n\r\n16. "Why, Herbert, that is just as nice as the real scales in father\'s\r\nstore; and you may have all my orange for making them."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Orange halves and other parts of the scale.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XXXIX.\r\n\r\nsmelt    hide    crept    laid    floor    inn    bear    fur\r\n\r\nyoung\'est    danced    joy\'ful ly    marched\r\n\r\nsol\'diers    bad\'ly    run\'ning     eld\'est\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Three children and a bear; surprised woman in background.]\r\n\r\nTHE BEAR AND THE CHILDREN.\r\n\r\n1. In the parlor of an inn in a small town, sat a man who had been going\r\nabout with a bear. He was waiting for his supper, and the bear was tied up\r\nin the yard.\r\n\r\n2. Up in the attic, three little children were playing together. The\r\neldest might have been six years old; the youngest, not more than two.\r\n\r\n3. Stump! stump! stump! Some one was coming up the stairs.\r\n\r\n4. The door flew open suddenly, and there stood the great, shaggy bear. He\r\nhad got tired of waiting, and had found his way to the stairs.\r\n\r\n5. The children were badly frightened. Each one crept into a corner, but\r\nthe bear found them all out, and smelt their clothes, but did not hurt\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n6. "This must be a great dog," they said, and they began to pat him.\r\n\r\n7. Then the bear lay down on the floor, and the youngest boy climbed on\r\nhis back, hid his head in the shaggy fur, and played at "hide and seek."\r\n\r\n8. The eldest boy took his drum and began to strike it, when the bear rose\r\non his hind legs and danced. At that the children gave a merry shout.\r\n\r\n9. The two younger boys took their wooden guns, and gave the bear one.\r\nAway they all marched around the room, keeping step.\r\n\r\n10. Now the frightened mother of the children came to the door. But the\r\nyoungest boy shouted, joyfully. "See, we are playing soldiers!"\r\n\r\n11. Then the bear\'s master came running up, and took the bear away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XL.\r\n\r\nfair    la\'dy    drear        cling\'ing    hare\'bell\r\n\r\nfled    ne\'er    de spair\'    nod\'ding     bloom\'ing\r\n\r\n[Footnote: harebell: Perennial with slender stems, dense clusters of\r\nleaves, and bell-shaped blue or white flowers -- bluebell.]\r\n\r\nTHE LITTLE HAREBELL.\r\n\r\n"Tell me, little harebell,\r\n   Are you lonely here.\r\nBlooming in the shadow\r\n   On this rock so drear?"\r\n\r\n"Clinging to this bit of earth,\r\n   As if in mid-air,\r\nWith your sweet face turned to me,\r\n   Looking strangely fair?"\r\n\r\n"Lady" said the harebell,\r\n   Nodding low its head,\r\n"Though this spot seem dreary,\r\n   Thought the sunlight\'s fled.\r\n\r\n"Know that I\'m not lonely\r\n   That I ne\'er despair.\r\nGod is in the shadow\r\n   God is everywhere."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Flowers on hillside.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XLI.\r\n\r\nrough (ruf)    of\'ten (of\'n)    be neath\'    fierce\'ly\r\n\r\nsea\'side       twen\'ty          tim\'id ly    com pels\'\r\n\r\nrob\'ber        breast           spots        mode\r\n\r\nos\'prey        hook\'ed\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Osprey catching fish.]\r\n\r\nTHE FISHHAWK.\r\n\r\n1. The fishhawk, or osprey, is not so large as the eagle; but he has, like\r\nthe eagle, a hooked bill and sharp claws.\r\n\r\n2. His color is a dark brown, with black and white spots, and his length\r\nis from twenty to twenty-two inches. His breast is mostly white. His tail\r\nand wings are long.\r\n\r\n3. The fishhawk is often found sitting upon a tree over a pond, or lake,\r\nor river. He is also found by the seaside.\r\n\r\n4. He watches the fish as they swim in the water beneath him; then he\r\ndarts down suddenly and catches one of them.\r\n\r\n5. When he catches a fish in his sharp, rough claws, he carries it off to\r\neat, and, as he flies away with it for his dinner, an eagle sometimes\r\nmeets him.\r\n\r\n6. The eagle flies at him fiercely with his sharp bill and claws, and\r\ncompels the hawk to drop the fish.\r\n\r\n7. Then the eagle catches the fish as it falls, before it reaches the\r\nground, and carries it off.\r\n\r\n8. The poor fish hawk, with a loud cry, timidly flies away. He must go\r\nagain to the water and catch another fish for his dinner.\r\n\r\n9. Thus you see, that the eagle is a robber. He robs fishhawks, whose only\r\nmode of getting a living is by catching fish.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XLII.\r\n\r\nleaf    task    twice       sigh\'ing     hol\'i days\r\n\r\ngay     twig    meant       stopped      dif\'fer ent\r\n\r\npuff    edge    mat\'ter     au\'tumn      hun\'dreds\r\n\r\nlead    grew    rus\'tled    Oc to\'ber    trem\'bling\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Several large trees; fence in foreground.]\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT THE LEAF SAID.\r\n\r\n1. Once or twice a little leaf was heard to cry and sigh, as leaves often\r\ndo, when a gentle wind is blowing. And the twig said, "What is the matter,\r\nlittle leaf?"\r\n\r\n2. "The wind," said the leaf, "just told me that one day it would pull me\r\noff, and throw me on the ground to die."\r\n\r\n3. The twig told it to the branch, and the branch told it to the tree.\r\nWhen the tree heard it, it rustled all over, and sent word back to the\r\ntrembling leaf.\r\n\r\n4. "Do not be afraid," it said; "hold on tight, and you shall not go off\r\ntill you are ready."\r\n\r\n5. So the leaf stopped sighing, and went on singing and rustling. It grew\r\nall the summer long till October. And when the bright days of autumn came,\r\nthe leaf saw all the leaves around growing very beautiful.\r\n\r\n6. Some were yellow, some were brown, and many were striped with different\r\ncolors. Then the leaf asked the tree what this meant.\r\n\r\n7. The tree said, "All these leaves are getting ready to fly away, and\r\nthey have put on these colors because of their joy."\r\n\r\n8. Then the little leaf began to want to go, and grew very beautiful in\r\nthinking of it. When it was gay in colors, it saw that the branches of the\r\ntree had no bright colors on them.\r\n\r\n9. So the leaf said, "O branch! why are you lead- colored while we are all\r\nbeautiful and golden?"\r\n\r\n10. "We must keep on our working clothes," said the tree, "for our work is\r\nnot yet done; but your clothes are for holidays, because your task is now\r\nover."\r\n\r\n11. Just then a little puff of wind came, and the leaf let go without\r\nthinking, and the wind took it up and turned it over and over.\r\n\r\n12. Then it fell gently down under the edge of the fence, among hundreds\r\nof leaves, and has never waked to tell us what it dreamed about.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XLIII.\r\n\r\ngold      lambs     fond\'ly    crick\'et     whirl\'ing\r\n\r\nfields    leaves    flee\'cy    fare\'well    cov\'er let\r\n\r\nglade     vale      dream      con tent\'    flut\'ter ing\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Large tree.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WIND AND THE LEAVES.\r\n\r\n                   1.\r\n"Come, little leaves," said the wind one day.\r\n"Come o\'er the meadows with me, and play;\r\nPut on your dress of red and gold\r\nSummer is gone, and the days grow cold."\r\n\r\n                   2.\r\nSoon as the leaves heard the wind\'s loud call,\r\nDown they came fluttering, one and all;\r\nOver the brown fields they danced and flew,\r\nSinging the soft little songs they knew.\r\n\r\n                   3.\r\n"Cricket, good-by, we\'ve been friends so long;\r\nLittle brook, sing us your farewell song,--\r\nSay you are sorry to see us go;\r\nAh! you will miss us, right well we know.\r\n\r\n                   4.\r\n"Dear little lambs, in your fleecy fold,\r\nMother will keep you from harm and cold;\r\nFondly we\'ve watched you in vale and glade;\r\nSay, will you dream of our loving shade?"\r\n\r\n                   5.\r\nDancing and whirling, the little leaves went;\r\nWinter had called them, and they were content.\r\nSoon fast asleep in their earthy beds,\r\nThe snow laid a coverlet over their heads.\r\n\r\n                                    George Cooper.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XLIV.\r\n\r\nwore      green    joke    Jessie      pres\'ents\r\n\r\njol\'ly    deal     trim    ex pect\'    leg\'gings\r\n\r\n\r\nMAMMA\'S PRESENT.\r\n\r\n1. Jessie played a good joke on her mamma. This is the way she did it.\r\n\r\n2. Jessie had gone to the woods with Jamie and Joe to get green branches\r\nto trim up the house for Christmas. She wore her little cap, her white\r\nfurs, and her red leggings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Three girls carrying a small Christmas tree.]\r\n\r\n3. She was a merry little girl, indeed; but she felt sad this morning\r\nbecause her mother had said, "The children will all have Christmas\r\npresents, but I don\'t expect any for myself. We are too poor this year."\r\n\r\n4. When Jessie told her brothers this, they all talked about it a great\r\ndeal. "Such a good, kind mamma, and no Christmas present! It\'s too bad."\r\n\r\n5. "I don\'t like it," said little Jessie, with a tear in her eye.\r\n\r\n6.  "Oh, she has you," said Joe.\r\n\r\n7. "But I am not something new," said Jessie.\r\n\r\n8. "Well, you will be new, Jessie," said Joe, "when you get back. She has\r\nnot seen you for an hour."\r\n\r\n9. Jessie jumped and laughed. "Then put me in the basket, and carry me to\r\nmamma, and say, \'I am her Christmas present.\' "\r\n\r\n10. So they set her in the basket, and put green branches all around her.\r\nIt was a jolly ride. They set her down on the doorstep, and went in and\r\nsaid, "There\'s a Christmas present out there for you, mamma."\r\n\r\n11. Mamma went and looked, and there, in a basket of green branches, sat\r\nher own little laughing girl.\r\n\r\n12. "Just the very thing I wanted most," said mamma.\r\n\r\n13. "Then, dear mamma," said Jessie, bounding out of her leafy nest, "I\r\nshould think it would be Christmas for mammas all the time, for they see\r\ntheir little girls every day."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XLV.\r\n\r\npur\'ple    plumes    pail       hap\'pened    coat\r\n\r\nshal\'low   wad\'ed    Charles    nap          yes\'ter day\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Two girls playing in water; two boats are beached on the\r\nsand behind them.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMARY\'S STORY.\r\n\r\n1.

Father and Charles went out a little way from the shore in a boat, and\r\nfished, while Lucy and I gathered sea mosses.\r\n\r\n3. We took off our shoes and stockings, and waded into the shallow water.\r\nWe had a pail to put our seaweeds in.\r\n\r\n4. We found such beautiful ones. Some wore purple, some pink, and some\r\nbrown. When they were spread out in the water, the purple ones looked like\r\nplumes, and the brown ones like little trees.\r\n\r\n5. Such a funny thing happened to Lucy. She slipped on a stone, and down\r\nshe went into the water. How we both laughed! But the wind and sun soon\r\ndried Lucy\'s dress.\r\n\r\n6. Then father came and took us in the boat for a row. After that we had a\r\npicnic dinner in the woods.\r\n\r\n7. Then father spread his coat on the grass, and took a nap while we\r\nchildren played on the beach.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XLVI.\r\n\r\nbid     sore     smile    Ralph     for get\'\r\n\r\nhay     stem     shone    Wick      scream\r\n\r\ntore    point    pluck    thorns    snatched\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mother and boy walking in hay field.]\r\n\r\n\r\nRALPH WICK.\r\n\r\n1. Ralph Wick was seven years old. In most things he was a fine boy, but\r\nhe was too apt to cry.\r\n\r\n2. When he could not have what. he wanted, he would cry for it and say, "I\r\nwill have it."\r\n\r\n3. If he was told that it would hurt him, and he could not have it, he\r\nwould begin to tease and cry.\r\n\r\n4. One day, he went with his mother into the fields. The sun shone. The\r\ngrass was cut. The flowers were in bloom.\r\n\r\n5. Ralph thought he was, for once, a good boy. A smile was on his face. He\r\nwished to do as he was told.\r\n\r\n6. He said, "Mother, I will be good now. I will do as you bid me. Please\r\nlet me toss this hay."\r\n\r\n7. "That I will," said his mother. So they threw the hay, as Ralph wished,\r\nand he was very happy.\r\n\r\n8. "Now you must be tired," said his mother. "Sit down here, and I will\r\nget a nice red rose for you."\r\n\r\n9. "I would like to have one," said Ralph. So his mother brought the red\r\nrose to him.\r\n\r\n10. "Thank you, mother," he said. "But you have a white one, also. Please\r\ngive me that."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mother and boy sitting in field.]\r\n\r\n11. "No, my dear," said his mother. "See how many thorns it has on its\r\nstem. You must not touch it. If you should try to pluck a rose like this,\r\nyou would be sure to hurt your hand."\r\n\r\n12. When Ralph found that he could not have the white rose, he began to\r\nscream, and snatched it. But he was soon very sorry. The thorns tore his\r\nhand. It was so sore he could not use it for some time.\r\n\r\n13. Ralph did not soon forget this. When he wanted what he should not\r\nhave, his mother would point to his sore hand. He at last learned to do as\r\nhe was told.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XLVII.\r\n\r\nslope        voic\'es      rush\'ing    beam\'ing    track        cheeks\r\n\r\nflood\'ing    laugh\'ter    health      a glow\'     coast\'ing    trudg\'ing\r\n\r\nfrost\'y      Is\'a bel     pleas\'ure   land\'scape\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Several children sledding down snowy hill.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCOASTING DOWN THE HILL.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Script Exercise:\r\n\r\nFrosty is the morning;\r\n   But the sun is bright,\r\nFlooding all the landscape\r\n   With its golden light.\r\nHark the sounds of laughter\r\n   And the voices shrill!\r\nSee the happy children\r\n   Coasting down the hill.\r\n\r\nThere are Tom and Charley,\r\n   And their sister Nell;\r\nThere are John and Willie,\r\n   Kate and Isabel,--\r\nEyes with pleasure beaming,\r\n   Cheeks with health aglow;\r\nBless the merry children,\r\n   Trudging through the snow!\r\n\r\nNow I hear them shouting,\r\n   "Ready!

On a summer day, a man sitting on the bank of a river, in the shade of\r\nsome bushes, watched a flock of ducks on the stream.\r\n\r\n2. Soon a branch with leaves came drifting among them, and they all took\r\nwing. After circling in the air for a little time, they settled down again\r\non their feeding ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fox watching ducks from a distance.]\r\n\r\n3. Soon another branch came drifting down among them, and again they took\r\nflight from the river; but when they found the branch had drifted by and\r\ndone them no harm, they flew down to the water as before.\r\n\r\n4. After four or five branches had drifted by in this way, the ducks gave\r\nlittle heed to them. At length, they hardly tried to fly out of their way,\r\neven when the branches nearly touched them.\r\n\r\n5. The man who had been watching all this, now began to wonder who had set\r\nthese branches adrift. He looked up the stream, and spied a fox slyly\r\nwatching the ducks. "What will he do next?" thought the man.\r\n\r\n6. When the fox saw that the ducks were no longer afraid of the branches,\r\nhe took a much larger branch than any he had yet used, and stretched\r\nhimself upon it so as to be almost hidden. Then he set it afloat as he had\r\nthe others.\r\n\r\n7. Right among the flock drifted the sly old fox, and, making quick snaps\r\nto right and left, he seized two fine young ducks, and floated off with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n8. The rest of the flock flew away in fright, and did not come back for a\r\nlong time.\r\n\r\n9. The fox must have had a fine dinner to pay him for his cunning, patient\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON XLIX.\r\n\r\nsaint      silk\'en    sim\'ple     pov\'er ty    plain      sin\'ner\r\n\r\nspin\'ner   splen\'dor  worth       stead\'y      mur\'der    plan\'ning\r\n\r\nsil\'ver    ten\'der    prov\'erb    re mem\'ber\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Spider spinning web.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRETTY IS THAT PRETTY DOES.\r\n\r\n1.

There once lived an old man in a snug, little cottage. It had two\r\nrooms and only two windows. A small garden lay just behind it.\r\n\r\n2. Old as the poor man was, he used to work in the fields. Often he would\r\ncome home very tired and weak, with his hoe or spade on his shoulder.\r\n\r\n3. And who do you think met him at the door! Mary and Jane, his two little\r\ngrandchildren.\r\n\r\n4. They were too young to work, except to weed in the garden, or bring\r\nwater from the spring.\r\n\r\n5. In winter, as they were too poor to buy much wood or coal, they had\r\nlittle fire; so they used to sit close together to keep warm. Mary would\r\nsit on one of the old man\'s knees, and Jane on the other.\r\n\r\n6. Sometimes their grandfather would tell them a droll story. Sometimes he\r\nwould teach them a hymn.\r\n\r\n7. He would often talk to them of their father, who had gone to sea, or of\r\ntheir good, kind mother, who was in her grave. Every night he prayed God\r\nto bless them, and to bring back their father in safety.\r\n\r\n8. The old man grew weaker every year; but the little girls were glad to\r\nwork for him, who had been so good to them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Girls and grandfather greeting father at door.]\r\n\r\n9. One cold, windy night, they heard a knock at the door. The little girls\r\nran and opened it. Oh, joy to them! There stood their father.\r\n\r\n10. He had been at sea a long time. He had saved some money, and had now\r\ncome home to stay.\r\n\r\n11. After this the old man did not have to work. His son worked for him,\r\nand his grandchildren took care of him. Many happy days they spent\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON LVII.\r\n\r\nhoe      grave    knock     ex cept\'\r\n\r\ndroll    hymn     prayed    cot\'tage\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GREEDY GIRL.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Laura English is a greedy little girl. Indeed, she is quite a glutton.\r\nDo you know what a glutton is? A glutton is one who eats too much, because\r\nthe food tastes well.\r\n\r\n2. Laura\'s mother is always willing she should have as much to eat as is\r\ngood for her; but sometimes, when her mother is not watching, she eats so\r\nmuch that it makes her sick.\r\n\r\n3. I do not know why she is so silly. Her kitten never eats more than it\r\nneeds. It leaves the nice bones on the plate, and lies down to sleep when\r\nit has eaten enough.\r\n\r\n4. The bee is wiser than Laura. It flies all day among the flowers to\r\ngather honey, and might eat the whole time if it pleased. But it eats just\r\nenough, and carries all the rest to its hive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Heavy girl eating two apples. Plate on floor with food\r\nscraps. Cat lying on footstool.]\r\n\r\n5. The squirrel eats a few nuts or acorns, and frisks about as gayly as if\r\nhe had dined at the king\'s table.\r\n\r\n6. Did you ever see a squirrel with a nut in his paws? How bright and\r\nlively he looks as he eats it!\r\n\r\n7. If he lived in a house made of acorns, he would never need a doctor. He\r\nwould not eat an acorn too much.\r\n\r\n8. I do not love little girls who eat too much. Do you, my little readers?\r\n\r\n9. I do not think they have such rosy cheeks, or such bright eyes, or such\r\nsweet, happy tempers as those who eat less.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON LVIII.\r\n\r\nlend        Sa\'rah      com\'fort    a shamed\'   your          wil\'ling\r\n\r\nthim\'ble    else\'where  us\'ing      bor\'row     of fend\'ed    de pend\'ed\r\n\r\n\r\nA PLACE FOR EVERYTHING.\r\n\r\nMary.

But if you will not lend me\r\n       yours, I can borrow one elsewhere.\r\n\r\nSarah. I am willing to lend mine to you, Mary.\r\n       But I would very much like to know why you come\r\n       to me to borrow so often.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Two girls seated, talking.]\r\n\r\nMary.  Because you never lose any of your things,\r\n       and always know where to find them.\r\n\r\nSarah. And why do I always know where to find my things?\r\n\r\nMary.  I do not know why, I am sure. If I did\r\n       know, I might sometimes find my own.\r\n\r\nSarah. I will tell you the secret. I have a place for\r\n       everything, and I put everything in its place when I\r\n       have done using it.\r\n\r\nMary.  O Sarah! who wants to run and put away a\r\n       thing as soon as she has used it, as if her life\r\n       depended upon it?\r\n\r\nSarah. Our life does not depend upon it, but our\r\n       comfort does, surely. How much more time will it\r\n       take to put a thing in its place, than to hunt for it or\r\n       to borrow whenever you want to use it ?\r\n\r\nMary.  Well, Sarah, I will never borrow of you\r\n       again, you may depend upon it.\r\n\r\nSarah. You are not offended with me, I hope.\r\n\r\nMary.  No, but I am ashamed. Before night, I will\r\n       have a place for everything, and then I will keep\r\n       everything in its place.

George Ellet had a bright silver dollar for a New-year gift.\r\n\r\n2. He thought of all the fine things he might buy with it.\r\n\r\n3. The ground was all covered with snow; but the sun shone out bright, and\r\neverything looked beautiful.\r\n\r\n4. So George put on his hat, and ran into the street. As he went skipping\r\nalong, he met some boys throwing snowballs. George soon engaged in the\r\nsport.\r\n\r\n5. He sent a ball at James Mason, but it missed him, and broke a window on\r\nthe other side of the street.\r\n\r\n6. George feared some one would come out of the house and find him. So he\r\nran off as fast as he could.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Boy throwing snowball through window.]\r\n\r\n7. As soon as he got round the next corner, George stopped, because he was\r\nvery sorry for what he had done.\r\n\r\n8. He said to himself, "I have no right to spend my silver dollar, now. I\r\nought to go back, and pay for the glass I broke with my snowball."\r\n\r\n9. He went up and down the street, and felt very sad. He wished very much\r\nto buy something nice. He also wished to pay for the broken glass.\r\n\r\n10. At last he said, "It was wrong to break the window, though I did not\r\nmean to do it. I will go and pay for it, if it takes all my money, I will\r\ntry not to be sorry. I do not think the man will hurt me if I pay for the\r\nmischief I have done."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON LXI.\r\n\r\nmer\'chant    hon\'est ly    rang    mind\r\n\r\npart\'ner     with out\'     rich    bell\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BROKEN WINDOW.\r\n(CONCLUDED.)\r\n\r\n1. George started off, and felt much happier for having made up his mind\r\nto do what was right.\r\n\r\n2. He rang the doorbell. When the man came out, George said, "Sir, I threw\r\na snowball through your window. But I did not intend to do it. I am very\r\nsorry, and wish to pay you. Here is the dollar my father gave me as a New-\r\nyear gift."\r\n\r\n3. The gentleman took the dollar, and asked George if he had no more\r\nmoney. George said he had not. "Well," said he, "this will do."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: George paying for broken window.]\r\n\r\n4. So, after asking George his name, and where he lived, he called him an\r\nhonest boy, and shut the door.\r\n\r\n5. George went home at dinner time, with a face as rosy, and eyes as\r\nbright, as if nothing had gone wrong. At dinner, Mr. Ellet asked him what\r\nhe had bought with his money.\r\n\r\n6. George very honestly told him all about the broken window, and said he\r\nfelt very well without any money to spend.\r\n\r\n7. When dinner was over, Mr. Ellet told George to go and look in his cap.\r\nHe did so, and found two silver dollars there.\r\n\r\n8. The man, whose window had been broken, had been there, and told Mr.\r\nEllet about it. He gave back George\'s dollar and another besides.\r\n\r\n9. A short time after this, the man came and told Mr. Ellet that he wanted\r\na good boy to stay in his store.\r\n\r\n10. As soon as George left school, he went to live with this man, who was\r\na rich merchant. In a few years he became the merchant\'s partner.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON LXII.\r\n\r\nline       fig\'ure       sec\'ond   grain       verse        per\'fect ly\r\n\r\nad vice\'   im pa\'tient   stud\'y    bus\'i ly    fol\'lowed    un der stand\'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mother talking to small boy. Hour-glass and flowers on\r\ntable between them.]\r\n\r\n\r\nFRANK AND THE HOURGLASS.\r\n\r\n1. Frank was a very talkative little boy. He never saw a new thing without\r\nasking a great many questions about it.\r\n\r\n2. His mother was very patient and kind. When it was proper to answer his\r\nquestions, she would do so.\r\n\r\n3. Sometimes she would say, "You are not old enough to understand that, my\r\nson. When you are ten years old, you may ask me about it, and I will tell\r\nyou."\r\n\r\n4. When his mother said this, he never teased any more. He knew she always\r\nliked to answer him when he asked proper questions.\r\n\r\n5. The first time Frank saw an hourglass, he was very much amused; but he\r\ndid not know what it was.\r\n\r\n6. His mother said, "An hourglass is made in the shape of the figure 8.\r\nThe sand is put in at one end, and runs through a small hole in the\r\nmiddle. As much sand is put into the glass as will run through in an\r\nhour."\r\n\r\n7. Frank watched the little stream of sand. He was impatient, because it\r\nwould not run faster. "Let me shake it, mother," said he; "it is lazy, and\r\nwill never get through."\r\n\r\n8. "Oh yes, it will, my son," said his mother, "The sand moves by little\r\nand little, but it moves all the time. 9. "When you look at the hands of\r\nthe clock, you think they go very slowly, and so they do; but they never\r\nstop.\r\n\r\n10, "While you are at play the sand is running, grain by grain, The hands\r\nof the clock are moving, second by second.\r\n\r\n11. "At night, the sand in the hourglass has run through twelve times. The\r\nhour hand of the clock has moved all around its great face.\r\n\r\n12. "This because they keep work every minute. They do not stop to think\r\nhow much they have to do, and how long it will take them to do it."\r\n\r\n13. Now, Frank\'s mother wanted him to learn a little hymn; but he said\r\n"Mother, I can never learn it."\r\n\r\n14. His mother said, "Study all the time. Never stop to ask how long it\r\nwill take to learn it. You will be able to say it very soon."\r\n\r\n15. Frank followed his mother\'s advice. He studied line after line, very\r\nbusily; and in one hour and a half he knew the hymn perfectly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON LXIII.\r\n\r\nsleet    cheer\'ly    cru\'el    taps    free\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Road through forest.]\r\n\r\nMARCH.\r\n\r\n1.

"It\'s of no use, Mrs. Templar; I have been trying the greater part of\r\nan hour to catch that rogue of a horse. She won\'t be caught."\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Man and boy chasing horse.]\r\n\r\n2. Such was the report the hired man brought in to Mrs. Templar one\r\npleasant May morning, when she had been planning a ride.\r\n\r\n3. "I suppose it can not be helped, but I wanted her very much," she said,\r\nas she turned away.\r\n\r\n4. "What was it you wanted, mother?" asked Jenny Templar, a bright,\r\nbrown-haired, brown-eyed girl of twelve, who had just come into the room.\r\n\r\n5. "Fanny," said the mother. "It is such a beautiful morning, I meant to\r\ndrive down to the village, get some groceries, then call for your Aunt\r\nAnn, have a nice ride up the river road, and bring her home to dinner.\r\n\r\n6. "But father is away for all day, and the men have been trying nearly an\r\nhour to catch Fanny; one of the men says she can\'t be caught."\r\n\r\n7. "Maybe she can\'t by him," said Jenny, with a merry laugh. "But, get\r\nready, mother; you shall go if you like. I\'ll catch Fanny, and harness\r\nher, too."\r\n\r\n8. "Why, my child, they say she jumped the ditch three or four times, and\r\nacted like a wild creature. You\'ll only be late at school, and tire\r\nyourself for nothing."\r\n\r\n9. "It won\'t take me long, mother. Fanny will come to me," said Jenny,\r\ncheerily. She put on her wide straw hat, and was off in a moment, down the\r\nhill, to the field where the horse was grazing.\r\n\r\n10. The moment Fanny heard the rustle of Jenny\'s dress, she pricked up her\r\nears, snorted, and, with head erect, seemed ready to bound away again.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Girl leading horse.]\r\n\r\n11. "Fanny! O Fanny!" called Jenny, and the beautiful creature turned her\r\nhead. That gentle tone she well knew, and, glad to see her friend, she\r\ncarne directly to the fence, and rubbed her head on the girl\'s shoulder.\r\nAs soon as the gate was opened, she followed Jenny to the barn.\r\n\r\n12. The men had treated her roughly, and she remembered it. But she knew\r\nand loved the voice that was always kind, and the hand that often fed and\r\ncaressed her. She gave love for love, and willing service for kindness.\r\n\r\nLESSON LXV.\r\n\r\nrung     Da\'vy     vi\'o let    re cess\'    ar range\'\r\n\r\nferns    ma\'ple    dain\'ty    lin\'gered    pret\'ti est\r\n\r\n\r\nPOOR DAVY.\r\n\r\n1. It was recess time at the village school. The bell had rung, and the\r\nchildren had run out into the bright sunshine, wild with laughter and fun.\r\n\r\n\r\n2. All but poor Davy. He came out last and very slowly, but he did not\r\nlaugh. He was in trouble, and the bright, golden sunlight did not make him\r\nglad.\r\n\r\n3. He walked across the yard, and sat down on a stone behind the old\r\nmaple. A little bird on the highest branch sang just to make him laugh.\r\n\r\n4. But Davy did not notice it. He was thinking of the cruel words that had\r\nbeen said about his ragged clothes. The tears stole out of his eyes, and\r\nran down his cheeks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Boy sitting alone under tree in schoolyard. Other children\r\nplaying in background.]\r\n\r\n5. Poor Davy had no father, and his mother had to work hard to keep him at\r\nschool.\r\n\r\n6. That night, he went home by the path that led across the fields and\r\nthrough the woods. He still felt sad.\r\n\r\n7. Davy did not wish to trouble his mother; so he lingered a while among\r\nthe trees, and at last threw himself on the green moss under them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Woman talking to boy.]\r\n\r\n8. Just then his teacher came along. She saw who it was, and stopped,\r\nsaying kindly, "What is the matter, Davy?"\r\n\r\n9. He did not speak, but the tears began again to start.\r\n\r\n10. "Won\'t you tell me? Perhaps I can help you."\r\n\r\n11. Then he told her all his trouble.  When he ended, she said, cheerily,\r\n"I have a plan, Davy, that I think will help you."\r\n\r\n12. "Oh, what is it?" he said, sitting up with a look of hope, while a\r\ntear fell upon a blue violet.\r\n\r\nl3. "Well, how would you like to be a little flower merchant?"\r\n\r\n14. "And earn money?" said Davy. "That would be jolly. But where shall I\r\nget my flowers?"\r\n\r\n15. "Right in these woods, and in the fields," said his teacher. " Here\r\nare lovely blue violets, down by the brook are white ones, and among the\r\nrocks are ferns and mosses. Bring them all to my house, and I will help\r\nyou arrange them."\r\n\r\n16. So, day after day, Davy hunted the woods for the prettiest flowers,\r\nand the most dainty ferns and mosses. After his teacher had helped to\r\narrange them, he took them to the city that was near, and sold them.\r\n\r\n17. He soon earned money enough to buy new clothes. Now the sunshine and\r\nthe bird\'s songs make him glad.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON LXVI.\r\n\r\ndeep    flour     dough      mill\'er     wheth\'er\r\n\r\ncook    a far\'    dust\'y     cra\'dles    grind\'ing\r\n\r\nglow    doth      val\'ley    reap\'ers    a-knead\'ing\r\n\r\n\r\nALICE\'S SUPPER.\r\n                   1.\r\nFar down in the valley the wheat grows deep,\r\nAnd the reapers are making the cradles sweep;\r\nAnd this is the song that I hear them sing,\r\nWhile cheery and loud their voices ring:\r\n"\'Tis the finest wheat that ever did grow!\r\nAnd it is for Alice\'s supper--ho! ho!"\r\n\r\n                   2.\r\nFar down by the river the old mill stands,\r\nAnd the miller is rubbing his dusty hands;\r\nAnd these are the words of the miller\'s lay,\r\nAs he watches the millstones grinding away:\r\n"\'Tis the finest flour that money can buy,\r\nAnd it is for Alice\'s supper--hi! hi!"\r\n\r\n                   3.\r\nDownstairs in the kitchen the fire doth glow,\r\nAnd cook is a-kneading the soft, white dough;\r\nAnd this is the song she is singing to-day,\r\nAs merry and busy she\'s working away:\r\n"\'Tis the finest dough, whether near or afar,\r\nAnd it is for Alice\'s supper--ha! ha!"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Mother serving supper to small girl seated at table.]\r\n\r\n                   4.\r\nTo the nursery now comes mother, at last,\r\nAnd what in her hand is she bringing so fast?\r\n\'Tis a plateful of something, all yellow and white,\r\nAnd she sings as she comes, with her smile so bright:\r\n"\'Tis the best bread and butter I ever did see,\r\nAnd it is for Alice\'s supper--he! he!"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON LXVII.\r\n\r\ntall    hung      storm       pick\'et\r\n\r\nfirs    north     gowns       spar\'ked\r\n\r\nroof    flakes    fair\'ies    cap\'tains\r\n\r\n\r\nA SNOWSTORM.\r\n\r\n1. Last night, the cold north wind blew great snow clouds over the sky.\r\nNot a star, not a bit of blue sky could be seen.\r\n\r\n2. Soon the tiny flakes floated softly down, like flocks of little white\r\nbirds. Faster and faster they came, till they filled the air. They made no\r\nnoise, but they were busy all night long.\r\n\r\n3. They covered all the ground with a soft, white carpet. They hung\r\nbeautiful plumes on the tall, green firs. The little bushes, they put to\r\nsleep in warm nightgowns and caps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Snow covering house, shed, and road. Children playing.]\r\n\r\n4. They hid the paths so that the boys might have the fun of digging new\r\nones. They turned the old picket fence into a row of soldiers, and the\r\ngate posts into captains, with tall white hats on.\r\n\r\n5. The old corn basket that was left out by the barn, upside down, they\r\nmade into a cunning little snow house with a round roof.\r\n\r\n6. When the busy little flakes had done their work, the sun came up to see\r\nwhat they had been about.\r\n\r\n7. He must have been pleased with what he saw, for he smiled such a\r\nbright, sweet smile, that the whole white world sparkled as if it were\r\nmade of little stars.\r\n\r\n8. Who would have thought that the black clouds could hide the little\r\nfairies that made the earth so beautiful!\r\n\r\nLESSON LXVIII.\r\n\r\ndug      roots     thump       of fense\'\r\n\r\ntoad     spool     heaped      smoothed\r\n\r\nforth    a\'pron    clos\'ets    dan\'de li ons\r\n\r\n\r\nBESSIE.\r\n\r\n1. One day, Bessie thought how nice it would be to have a garden with only\r\nwild flowers in it. So into the house she ran to find her Aunt Annie, and\r\nask her leave to go over on the shady hillside, across the brook, where\r\nthe wild flowers grew thickest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Girl planting small garden. Toad sitting in garden.]\r\n\r\n2. " Yes, indeed, you may go," said Aunt Annie; "but what will you put the\r\nroots and earth in while you are making the garden?"\r\n\r\n3. "Oh," said Bessie, "I can take my apron."\r\n\r\n4. Her aunt laughed, and said, "A basket will be better, I think." So they\r\nlooked in the closets and the attic, everywhere; but some of the baskets\r\nwere full, and some broken; not one could they find that would do.\r\n\r\n5. Then Aunt Annie turned out the spools and the bags from a nice large\r\nworkbasket, and gave that to Bessie. "You may have this for your own," she\r\nsaid, "to fill with earth, or flowers, or anything you like."\r\n\r\n6. "Oh I thank you," said Bessie, and she danced away through the garden.\r\nShe slipped through the gate, out into the field all starred with\r\ndandelions, down in the hollow by the brook, then up on the hillside out\r\nof sight among the shady trees.\r\n\r\n7. How she worked that afternoon! She heaped up the dark, rich earth, and\r\nsmoothed it over with her hands. Then she dug up violets, and\r\nspring-beauties, and other flowers,--running back and forth, singing all\r\nthe while.\r\n\r\n8. The squirrels peeped out of their holes at Bessie. The birds sang in\r\nthe branches overhead. Thump, came something all at once into the middle\r\nof the bed. Bessie jumped and upset the basket, and away it rolled down\r\nthe hill.\r\n\r\n9. How Bessie laughed when she saw a big, brown toad winking his bright\r\neyes at her, as if he would say, "No offense, I hope."\r\n\r\n10. Just then Bessie heard a bell ringing loudly. She knew it was calling\r\nher home; but how could she leave her basket? She must look for that\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\n11. "Waiting, waiting, waiting," all at once sang a bird out of sight\r\namong the branches; "waiting, Bessie."\r\n\r\n12. "Sure enough," said Bessie; "perhaps I\'m making dear mother or auntie\r\nwait; and they are so good to me. I\'d better let the basket wait. Take\r\ncare of it, birdie; and don\'t jump on my flowers, Mr. Toad."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON LXIX.\r\n\r\nvisit    soaked    o be\'di ent    ru\'ined\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Girl on couch looking out window.]\r\n\r\n\r\nBESSIE.\r\n(CONCLUDED.)\r\n\r\n1. She was back at the house in a few minutes, calling, "Mother! mother!\r\nauntie! Who wants me?"\r\n\r\n2. "I, dear," said her mother. "I am going away for a long visit, and if\r\nyou had not come at once, I could not have said good-by to my little\r\ngirl."\r\n\r\n3. Then Bessie\'s mother kissed her, and told her to obey her kind aunt\r\nwhile she was gone.\r\n\r\n4. The next morning, Bessie waked to find it raining hard. She went into\r\nher aunt\'s room with a very sad face. "O auntie! this old rain!"\r\n\r\n5, "This new, fresh, beautiful rain, Bessie! How it will make our flowers\r\ngrow, and what a good time we can have together in the house!"\r\n\r\n6. "I know it, auntie; but you will think me so careless!"\r\n\r\n7. "To let it rain?"\r\n\r\n8. "No; don\'t laugh, Aunt Annie; to leave your nice basket out of doors\r\nall night; and now it will be soaked and ruined in this--this--beautiful\r\nrain." Bessie did not look as if the beautiful rain made her very happy.\r\n\r\n9. "You must be more careful, dear, another time," said her aunt, gently.\r\n"But come, tell me all about it."\r\n\r\n10. So Bessie crept very close to her auntie\'s side, and told her of her\r\nhappy time the day before; of the squirrel, and the toad, and how the\r\nbasket rolled away down the hill; and then how the bell rang, and she\r\ncould not stop to find the basket.\r\n\r\n11. "And you did quite right," said her aunt. "If you had stopped, your\r\nmother must have waited a whole day, or else gone without seeing you. When\r\nI write, I will tell her how obedient you were, and that will please her\r\nmore than anything else I can say."\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLESSON LXX.\r\n\r\nsought    sure\'ly (shu)    wel\'come      light\'some\r\n\r\nloft\'y    maid\'en          cher\'ished    in tro duce\'\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEERFULNESS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Script Exercise:\r\n\r\nThere is a little maiden--\r\n  Who is she?

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\nLiterary Archive Foundation\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\nspread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\nincreasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\nfreely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\narray of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\nstatus with the IRS.\r\n\r\nThe Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\ncharities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\nStates.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\nconsiderable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\nwith these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\nwhere we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\nSEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\nparticular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n\r\nWhile we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\nhave not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\nagainst accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\napproach us with offers to donate.\r\n\r\nInternational donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\nany statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\noutside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.\r\n\r\nPlease check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation\r\nmethods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other\r\nways including including checks, online payments and credit card\r\ndonations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate\r\n\r\n\r\nSection 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\nworks.\r\n\r\nProfessor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\nconcept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\nwith anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\nGutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\neditions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\nunless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\nkeep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n\r\n     http://www.gutenberg.net\r\n\r\nThis Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\nincluding how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\nArchive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\nsubscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
